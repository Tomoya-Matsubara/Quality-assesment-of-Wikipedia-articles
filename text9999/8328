The '''Katyn massacre''', also known as the '''Katyn Forest massacre''' ({{lang-pl|zbrodnia katy<U+0144>ska}}, literally 'Katy<U+0144> crime'), was a mass [[execution]] of [[Poland|Polish]] citizens ordered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities in [[1940]].<ref name="Fischer">[[Benjamin B.

The term "Katyn massacre" originally referred to the [[massacre]], at [[Katyn (village)|Katyn]] Forest near the village of Gnezdovo (located 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) west of [[Smolensk]], [[Russia]]), of Polish military officers confined at the [[Kozelsk]] [[prisoner-of-war camp]].

The 1943 discovery of mass graves at Katyn Forest by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], after its armed forces had occupied the site in 1941, precipitated a rupture of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in [[London]]. The Soviet Union continued to deny responsibility for the massacres until 1990, when it acknowledged that the NKVD secret police had in fact committed the massacres of over 22,000 Polish soldiers and intelligentsia and the subsequent cover-up.<ref name="bbc161204">[[BBC News]] story : Russia to release massacre files, [[December 16]] [[2004]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4102967.stm online]</ref> The [[Russian government]] has admitted Soviet responsibility for the massacres, although it does not classify them a [[war crime]] or an act of [[genocide]], as this would have necessitated the [[wiktionary:prosecution|prosecution]] of surviving perpetrators, which is what the [[Polish government]] has requested.<ref name="Mosnews110305"/> Since "''for 50 years, the Soviet Union concealed the truth''" <ref name="Fischer"/> some, particularly in Russia, continue to believe the original Soviet explanation that it had been the Germans who had killed the Poles.

On [[September 17]] [[1939]] the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Red Army invaded the territory of Poland]] from the east. This invasion took place while Poland had already sustained serious defeats in the wake of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|attack on the country]] that started on [[September 1]] [[1939]]; thus Soviets moved to safeguard [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|their claims]] in accordance with the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].<ref name="PWN_KW">[[Encyklopedia PWN]] [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/33490_1.html 'KAMPANIA WRZE<U+015A>NIOWA 1939'], last retrieved on [[10 December]] [[2005]], Polish language</ref> In the wake of the [[Red Army]]'s quick advance that met little resistance, between 250,000<ref name="<U+041C><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432>"><U+041C><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432> <U+043D><U+0430> V <U+0441><U+0435><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0412><U+0435><U+0440><U+0445><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0421><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+0430> 31 <U+043E><U+043A><U+0442><U+044F><U+0431><U+0440><U+044F> <U+0446><U+0438><U+0444><U+0440><U+0430> <U+00AB><U+043F><U+0440><U+0438><U+043C><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+043E> 250 <U+0442><U+044B><U+0441>.<U+00BB></ref> and 454,700<ref name="<U+041E><U+0442><U+0447><U+0451><U+0442>"><U+041E><U+0442><U+0447><U+0451><U+0442> <U+0423><U+043A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0438><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0438> <U+0411><U+0435><U+043B><U+043E><U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0444><U+0440><U+043E><U+043D><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432> <U+041A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0441><U+043D><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0410><U+0440><U+043C><U+0438><U+0438> <U+041C><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C><U+0442><U+044E><U+0445><U+043E><U+0432>, <U+0441>. 367. http://www.usatruth.by.ru/c2.files/t05.html</ref> Polish soldiers had become prisoners and were [[interned]] by the Soviets.

The approximately 170,000 released were mostly soldiers of Ukrainian and Belorusian ethnicity serving in the Polish army. The 43,000 soldiers born in West Poland, now under German control, were transferred to the Germans. By [[November 19]] [[1939]], NKVD had about 40,000 Polish [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s: about 8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,500 police officers and 25,000 soldiers and NCOs who were still being held as POWs.<ref name="<U+041A><U+0430><U+0442><U+044B><U+043D><U+044C>">''<U+041A><U+0430><U+0442><U+044B><U+043D><U+044C>. <U+041F><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438> <U+043D><U+0435><U+043E><U+0431><U+044A><U+044F><U+0432><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0439><U+043D><U+044B>''. <U+0441><U+0431>.<U+0434><U+043E><U+043A>. <U+041C>., <U+041C><U+0424> "<U+0414><U+0435><U+043C><U+043E><U+043A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0442><U+0438><U+044F>": 1999, <U+0441><U+0441>.20-21, 208-210.</ref>

As early as [[September 19]] [[1939]], the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and First Rank Commissar of State Security, [[Lavrenty Beria]], ordered the NKVD to create a Directorate for Prisoners of War<ref name="Fischer"/> (or USSR NKVD Board for Prisoners of War and Internees, headed by State Security Captain Pyotr Soprunenko<ref name="Miednoje_Katyn">[http://www.coldwarhistory.us/Cold_War/Katyn_Massacre/Miednoje__Katyn.htm "The grave unknown elsewhere or any time before ...

The NKVD took custody of Polish prisoners from the Red Army, and proceeded to organize a network of reception centers and transit camps and arrange rail transport to [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s in the western USSR. The camps were located at [[Jukhnovo]] ([[Babynino]] rail station), [[Yuzhe]] (Talitsy), [[Kozelsk]], [[Kozelshchyna]], [[Oranki]], [[Ostashkov]] ([[Stolbnyi Island]] on [[Seliger Lake]] near Ostashkov), [[Tyotkino]] rail station (56&nbsp;mi/90&nbsp;km from [[Putyvl]]), [[Starobielsk]], [[Vologda]] ([[Zaenikevo]] rail station) and [[Gryazovets]].<ref name="Miednoje_Katyn"/>

Kozelsk and Starobielsk were used mainly for [[military officer]]s, while Ostashkov was used mainly for [[ZHP|Boy Scout]]s, [[gendarmerie|gendarme]]s, [[police officer]]s and [[prison|prison officers]]. Prisoners at these camps were not exclusively military officers or members of the other groups mentioned, but also included Polish [[intelligentsia]]. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5,000; Ostashkov, 6,570; and Starobelsk, 4,000. They totalled 15,570 men.<ref name="Zawodny"/>

Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers such as [[Vasily Zarubin]]. The Poles were encouraged to believe they would be released,<ref name="diary">[http://www.polandsholocaust.org/katyndiary1.html "The Katyn Diary of Leon Gladun"], last accessed on [[19 December]] [[2005]], English translation of Polish document.

On [[March 5]] [[1940]], pursuant to a note to [[Joseph Stalin]] from [[Lavrenty Beria]], the members of the Soviet [[Politburo]] &mdash; Stalin, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Mikhail Kalinin]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Anastas Mikoyan]] and [[Lavrenty Beria|Beria]] &mdash; signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish "nationalists and counterrevolutionaries" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]].<ref name="kmw_resolution"/>

==Execution==
In the period from [[April 3]] to [[May 19]] [[1940]], about 22,000 prisoners were executed: 14,700<ref name="kmw_resolution"/><U+2013>15,570<ref name="Zawodny"/> from the three camps and about 11,000<ref name="kmw_resolution"/> prisoners in western parts of Belarus and Ukraine. A 1956 memo from KGB chief [[Alexander Shelepin]] to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] confirmed 21,257 of these killings at the following sites: Katyn&ndash;4,421, Starobelsk Camp&ndash;3,820, Ostashkov Camp&ndash;6,311, other places of detention&ndash;7,305.<ref name="deaths">[http://www.holocaust-history.org/~rjg/deaths.shtml "Noncombatant Deaths in WW II"], the Holocaust History Project, last accessed on [[19 December]] [[2005]]</ref> Those who died at Katyn included an admiral, two generals, 24 colonels, 79 lieutenant colonels, 258 majors, 654 captains, 17 naval captains, 3,420 [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s, seven chaplains, three landowners, a prince, 43 officials, 85 privates, and 131 refugees. Also among the dead were 20 university professors (including [[Stefan Kaczmarz]]); 300 physicians; several hundred lawyers, engineers, and teachers; and more than 100 writers and journalists as well as about 200 pilots.

Up to 99% of the remaining prisoners were subsequently murdered. People from [[Kozelsk]] were murdered in the usual mass murder site of [[Smolensk]] country, called [[Katyn]] forest; people from [[Starobielsk]] were murdered in the inner NKVD prison of Kharkov and the bodies were buried near [[Pyatikhatki]]; and police officers from [[Ostashkov]] were murdered in the inner NKVD prison of Kalinin (Tver) and buried in [[Miednoje]] (''Mednoye''). 

[[Image:Katyn2.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Poland|Polish]] [[currency]] and [[military]] [[insignia]] from the mass graves.]]
Detailed information on the executions in the Kalinin NKVD prison was given during the hearing by [[Dmitrii S. Tokarev]], former head of the Board of the District [[NKVD]] in [[Tver|Kalinin]]. According to Tokarev, the shooting started in the evening and ended at dawn. The first transport on [[April 4]], [[1940]], carried 390 people, and the executioners had a hard time killing so many people during one night. The following transports were no greater than 250 people. The executions were usually performed with German-made [[Walther]]-type pistols supplied by Moscow.<ref name="Tokarev">{{cite book | author = Dmitri Stepanovich Tokariev | year = 1994 | title = Zeznanie Tokariewa | others = Anatoliy Ablokov, Fryderyk Zbiniewicz | pages = 71 | publisher = Warsaw, Niezale<U+017C>ny Komitet Historyczny Badania Zbrodni Katy<U+0144>skiej | location = Zeszyty Katy<U+0144>skie 1426-4064 nr 3}}, also in {{cite book | year = 1995 | title =Katy<U+0144>; dokumenty zbrodni  | editor = [[Aleksander Gieysztor]], Rudolf Germanovich Pikhoya | others = Wojciech Materski, Aleksandra Belerska | pages = 547 + 567 | publisher = Warsaw, Trio | id = ISBN 83-85660-62-3 + ISBN 83-86643-80-3}}.</ref>

The killings were methodical. After the condemned's personal information was checked, he was handcuffed and led to a cell insulated with a felt-lined door. The sounds of the  murderers were also masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. After being taken into the cell, the victim was immediately shot in the back of the head. His body was then taken out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside. The procedure went on every night, except for the [[May Day]] holiday.{{citation needed}}<!--paragraph needs sources!--> Near Smolensk, the Poles, with their hands tied behind their backs, were led to the graves and shot in the neck.

After the execution was carried out, there were still more than 22,000 of the former Polish soldiers in NKVD labor camps. According to Beria's report, by [[November 2]] [[1940]] his department had 2 generals, 39 lieutenant-colonels and colonels, 222 captains and majors, 691 lieutenants, 4022 warrant officers and NCOs and 13,321 enlisted men captured during the Polish campaign. Plus 3,300 Polish soldiers were captured during the annexation of [[Lithuania]], where they were kept interned since September 1939.<ref name="<U+0411><U+0435><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F>">Beria's letter <U+2116>4713/<U+0431> of [[November 2]] [[1940]] published in <U+041D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0438> <U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+0439><U+0448><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F>, <U+2116>2, 1993</ref>

==Discovery==
The question of the Polish prisoners' fate was first raised soon after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Germans invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, when the [[Polish government-in-exile]] and the Soviet government signed the [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]] in which they agreed to cooperate against Germany, and so that a Polish army on Soviet territory was to be formed. When the Polish general [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Anders]] began organizing this army, he requested information about the Polish officers. During a personal meeting Stalin assured him and [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sikorski]], the Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile, that all the Poles had been freed, and the fact that not all can be accounted is due to the fact that the Soviets "lost track" of them in  [[Manchuria]].<ref name=VIZH><U+0420><U+043E><U+043C><U+0443><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+0434> <U+0421><U+0432><U+044F><U+0442><U+0435><U+043A>, "<U+041A><U+0430><U+0442><U+044B><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+043B><U+0435><U+0441>", <U+0412><U+043E><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+043E>-<U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0436><U+0443><U+0440><U+043D><U+0430><U+043B>, 1991, <U+2116>9, {{ISSN|0042-9058}}</ref><ref name="Brackman">[[Roman Brackman|Brackman, Roman]], ''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life'', 2001, ISBN 0-7146-5050-1.

The fate of the missing prisoners remained unknown until April 1943 when the German [[Wehrmacht]] discovered the mass grave of more than 4,000 Polish military reserve officers in the forest on Goat Hill near Katyn. [[Joseph Goebbels]] saw this discovery as an excellent tool to drive a wedge between Poland, Western Allies, and the Soviet Union. On [[April 13]] [[Berlin Radio]] broadcast to the world that the German military forces in the Katyn forest near Smolensk had uncovered ''"a ditch ... 28 metres long and 16 metres wide [92&nbsp;ft by 52&nbsp;ft], in which the bodies of 3,000 Polish officers were piled up in 12 layers."''<ref name="Engel">[[David Engel|Engel, David]], ''Facing a Holocaust: The Polish Government-In-Exile and the Jews, 1943<U+2013>1945'', 1993, ISBN 0-8078-2069-5.

The Germans assembled and brought in a European commission consisting of twelve forensic experts and their staffs.  With the exception of a Swiss from the University of Geneva, all were from lands then occupied by Germany.  After the war, all of the experts, save for a Bulgarian and a Czech, reaffirmed their 1943 finding of Soviet guilt.''<ref name="Bauer:>[[Eddy Bauer|Bauer, Eddy]]. The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War II. Marshall Cavendish. 1985</ref>

The Katyn Massacre was beneficial to Nazi Germany, which it used to discredit the Soviet Union. Goebbels wrote in his diary on [[April 14]] [[1943]]: ''"We are now using the discovery of 12,000 Polish officers, murdered by the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]], for anti-Bolshevik propaganda on a grand style. We sent neutral journalists and Polish intellectuals to the spot where they were found. Their reports now reaching us from ahead are gruesome. The Fuehrer has also given permission for us to hand out a drastic news item to the German press. I gave instructions to make the widest possible use of the propaganda material. We shall be able to live on it for a couple weeks"''<ref name="Goebbels">[[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels, Joseph]]. The Goebbels Diaries (1942<U+2013>1943). Translated by Louis P. Lochner. Doubleday & Company. 1948</ref> The Germans had succeeded in discrediting the Soviet Government in the eyes of the world and briefly raised the spectre of a communist monster rampaging across the territories of Western civilization; moreover they had forged the unwilling General Sikorski into a tool which could threaten to unravel the alliance between the Western Allies and Soviet Union.

The Soviet government immediately denied the German charges and claimed that the Polish prisoners of war had been engaged in construction work west of Smolensk and consequently were captured and executed by invading German units in August 1941. The Soviet response on [[April 15]] to the German initial broadcast of [[April 13]], prepared by the [[Soviet Information Bureau]] stated that ''"[...]Polish prisoners-of-war who in 1941 were engaged in country construction work west of Smolensk and who [...] fell into the hands of the German-Fascist hangmen [...]."''<ref name="Zawodny"/>

The Allies were aware that the Nazis had found a mass grave as the discovery transpired, via radio transmissions intercepted and decrypted by [[Bletchley Park]]. Germans and the international commission, which was invited by Germany, investigated the Katyn corpses and soon produced physical evidence that the massacre took place in early 1940, at a time when the area was still under Soviet control.<ref name="Davies">[[Norman Davies]], "[[Europe: A History]]", HarperCollins, 1998, ISBN 0-06-097468-0, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0060974680&id=7zN4crdeEWoC&pg=PA1004&lpg=PA1004&dq=Stalin+Katyn+Sikorski+recognition&prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3DStalin%2BKatyn%2BSikorski%2Brecognition&sig=WQke9pdpKqVbZP8M6GpzJbdA9A4&auth=DQAAAHEAAAA29L6FgwjzVgscO4WQsRnPoAruwiCb8wWC54HH4QiZaim50FhX7lIyMdP8W4Wio5gWnWH7zrbq7HeeeK-jniwW-2jXBqlm3GKtcgYKjgPkRzNteDnUtcEOttKLWuznmVbFiwOpGYq4oDSqZ4H_Q6lW17zONi5CbPmSe2F74fy3cw Google Book page view]</ref>

===Actions taken by the Soviet Union===

When in September 1943 Goebbels was informed that the German Army had to withdraw from the Katyn area, he entered a prediction in his diary. His entry for [[September 29]], [[1943]] reads: ''"Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is going to cause us quite a little trouble in the future. The Soviets are undoubtedly going to make it their business to discover as many mass graves as possible and then blame it on us."''<ref name="Goebbels"/>

Indeed, having retaken the Katyn area almost immediately after the Red Army had recaptured [[Smolensk]], the Soviet Union, led by the NKVD, began a cover-up. A cemetery the Germans had permitted the Polish Red Cross to build was destroyed and other evidence removed.<ref name="Fischer"/> In January 1944, the Soviet Union sent the ''"Special Commission for Determination and Investigation of the Shooting of Polish Prisoners of War by German-Fascist Invaders in Katyn Forest,"'' (''U.S.S.R. Spetsial'naya Kommissiya po Ustanovleniyu i Rassledovaniyu Obstoyatel'stv Rasstrela Nemetsko-Fashistskimi Zakhvatchikami v Katynskom Lesu'')<ref name="Zawodny"/><!--translation differs, other variant is 'Special Commission for investigation and ascertaining of the circumstances of the shootings by the German Fascist aggressors of Polish officers'--> to investigate the incidents again. The so-called "Burdenko Commission", headed by [[Nikolai Burdenko]], the President of the [[Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR]], exhumed the bodies again and reached the conclusion that the shooting was done in 1941, when the Katyn area was under German occupation. No foreign personnel, including the [[Polish communism|Polish communists]], were allowed to join the ''Burdenko Commission'',<ref name="Fischer"/><ref name="Zawodny"/> whereas the Nazi German investigation had allowed wider access to both international press and organizations (like the Red Cross) and even used Polish workers, like [[J<U+00F3>zef Mackiewicz]].<ref name="Mackiewicz">[http://tylkoprawda.akcja.pl/teksty16a.htm online "I saw it with my own eyes..."], last accessed on [[19 December]] [[2005]], English translation of Polish document</ref>

===Response to the massacre by the Western Allies===
The Western Allies had an implicit, if unwilling, hand in the cover-up in their endeavour not to antagonise a then ally, the Soviet Union. The resulting Polish-Soviet crisis was beginning to threaten the vital alliance with the Soviet Union at a time when the Poles' importance to the Allies, essential in the first years of the war, was beginning to fade due to the entry into the conflict of the military and industrial giants, the Soviet Union and the United States. In retrospective review of records, it is clear that both British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] were increasingly torn between their commitments to their Polish ally, the uncompromising stance of Sikorski and the demands by Stalin and his diplomats.
[[Image:Katyn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The picture of [[exhumation]]s of Polish dead at Katyn Forest (1943) was distributed by the [[Propagandaministerium|Nazi German Ministry of propaganda]].]]

In private, Churchill agreed that the atrocity was likely carried out by the Soviets. According to the note taken by [[Edward Raczy<U+0144>ski (1891-1993)|Count Raczy<U+0144>ski]], Churchill admitted on [[April 15]] during a conversation with General Sikorski: ''"Alas, the German revelations are probably true.

[[Image:4691998 cebc548f71 o.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Katyn memorial in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]]]
In the [[United States]], a similar line was taken notwithstanding that two official intelligence reports into Katyn massacre were produced that contradicted the official position.

In 1944 Roosevelt assigned Navy Lieutenant Commander [[George Earle]], his special emissary to the [[Balkans]], to compile information on Katyn which he did using contacts in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. He concluded that the Soviet Union committed the massacre. After consulting with [[Elmer Davis]], the director of the [[Office of War Information]], Roosevelt rejected that conclusion, saying that he was convinced of Nazi Germany's responsibility, and ordered Earle's report suppressed. When Earle formally requested permission to publish his findings, the President gave him a written order to desist. Earle was reassigned and spent the rest of the war in [[American Samoa]].<ref name="Fischer"/>

A further report in 1945 supporting the same conclusion was produced and stifled. In 1943 two US POWs <U+2013> Lt. Col. [[Donald B. Stewart]] and Col. [[John H. Van Vliet]] <U+2013> had been taken by Nazi Germans to Katyn in 1943 for an international news conference.<ref name="archives.gov"> [[National Archives and Records Administration]], documents related to Committee to Investigate and Study the Facts, Evidence, and Circumstances of the Katyn Forest Massacre (1951<U+2013>52) [http://www.archives.gov/legislative/guide/house/chapter-22-select-katyn-forest-massacre.html online], last accessed on [[23 December]] [[2005]].

===Trials===

In 1946, the chief Soviet prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], [[Roman A.

[[Image:Katyn partout.jpg|thumb|right|250px|German WWII propaganda poster (in French) exploiting the massacre. The text reads: ''If the Soviets win the war! Katyn everywhere'']]

More specifically, presented by the Soviet charge the Burdenko report, in spite of the reserves<ref>According to the formula of Annette Wieviorka, these reserves can be interpreted like a ''tacit consent of the Soviet culpability'', "Le proc<U+00E8>s de Nuremberg", Editions Ouest-France, 1995, p. 92</ref>of the Anglo-Saxons, was accepted on grounds of the article 21<ref> Article 21: The Court will not require that the proof of a publicly known fact be provided, but will hold them for asset. It will also consider as authentic proofs the documents and official reports of the United Nations governments, including those drawn up by the commissions established in the various allied countries, for the investigations into the war crimes as well as the official reports of the hearings and the decisions of the military courts or other courts of any of the United Nations.</ref> and coded as URSS-54. The German White Book of 1943 was accepted on grounds of the article 19<ref>
Article 19: The Court will not be bound by the technical rules related to the management of the evidence. It will adopt and apply as much as possible an expeditious and nonformal procedure, and will admit any means which it estimates of a convincing value.</ref>
with, as had underlined it the president of the court,<ref>''Proc<U+00E8>s des grands criminels de guerre devant le Tribunal Militaire International de Nuremberg'', Tristan Mage, 1993-98, XVII, p.277-380 for the two sessions consecrated to the Katyn masacre</ref> a ''potential'' convincing value; the course of the debates would make this adjective pointless.
The intransigence of the Soviets to reveal Katyn in the bill of indictment was driven by the final objective: to quote it in the verdict. To this end, summoning of some witnesses was refused.<ref>Three German officers present in 1943 were accepted by the court (on six asked by defense), while prof. Neville, teaching the forensic medicine in Geneva and member of the International Commission of 1943 have been refused. The charge correlatively obtained the presentation of three witnesses, inclyding prof. Markov, Bulgarian and member of this same commission, "pesuaded" by the Soviets with the known means of pressure, as well as the president of the Soviet Commission, Burdenko, which was also the president of the medical Academy of Science of the USSR.</ref>

However, the problem to be addressed by the court was not to allot the responsibility for the massacre to Germany or the Soviet Union, but to attribute the crime to at least one of the twenty four dignitaries of the nazi state.<ref>As precisely described by  [[Iona Nikitchenko]], one of the judges and a military magistrate having been involved in Stalin's show trials, "''the fact that the Nazis chiefs are criminals was already established [by the declarations and agreements of the Allies]. The role of this court is thus limited to determine the precise culpability of each one [charged]".'' in: Nuremberg Trials, Leo Kahn, Bellantine, N.Y., 1972, p.26.</ref> The task of the charge was thus to establish a link between the reproached acts and the defendants. On hearings, however, the Soviet prosecutor proved to be unable to name the person in charge for the execution of the massacre<ref>A commander of the regiment 537, its successor and police force (the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]]) were successively indicated</ref>, as well as the supposed guilty among the defendants<ref>The question of Dr. Latermeer, lawyer of Seyss-Inquart, ''To which defendant has to be charged the murder?'', was refused to be answered.</ref>.

In spite of this bankruptcy of the charge, Nikitchenko tried to make pass in force the Soviet point of view and did not hesitate to claim the inadequacy of the statutes of the court. This failed and the name of Katyn did not appear in the verdict.

===Perception of the massacre in the Cold War===
In 1951&ndash;52, in the background of the [[Korean War]], a U.S. Congressional investigation chaired by Rep. [[Ray J. Madden]] and known as the Madden Committee investigated the Katyn massacre. It charged that the Poles had been killed by the Soviets<ref name="Fischer"/> and recommended that the Soviets be tried before the [[International World Court of Justice]]. The committee was however less conclusive on the issue of alleged American cover up.<ref name="archives.gov"/>

The question of responsibility remained controversial in the West as well as behind the [[Iron Curtain]]. For example, in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s, plans for a memorial to the victims bearing the date 1940 (rather than 1941) were condemned as provocative in the political climate of the [[Cold War]].

It has been sometimes speculated that the choice made in 1969 for the location of the [[Byelorussian SSR|BSSR's]] war memorial at the former Belarusian village named [[Khatyn]], a site of a 1943 Nazi massacre in which the entire village with its whole population was burned, have been made to cause confusion with Katyn.<ref name="Silitski">{{en icon}}Vitali Silitski, [http://www.tol.cz/look/TOL/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=4&NrIssue=115&NrSection=4&NrArticle=14025 A Partisan Reality Show]", ''Transitions Online'', [[11 May]] [[2005]], {{ISSN|1214<U+2013>1615}}</ref><ref name="LRC">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =Louis Robert Coatney | title =The Katyn Massacre (A Master of Arts Thesis)| year =1993 | editor = | pages = | publisher =[[Western Illinois University]] | location =Macomb | id = | url =http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/wwii/special.studies/katyn.massacre/katynlrc.txt}}</ref> The two names are similar or identical in many languages.<ref name="Fischer">{{en icon}} {{cite journal | author =Benjamin B.

In Poland Communist authorities covered up the matter in concord with Soviet propaganda, deliberately censoring any sources that might shed some light on the Soviet crime. Katyn was a forbidden topic in [[History of Poland (1945-1989)|postwar Poland]]. Not only did government [[censorship]] suppress all references to it, but even mentioning the atrocity was dangerous. Katyn became erased from Poland's official history, but it could not be erased from historical memory. In 1981, Polish trade union [[Solidarity]] erected a memorial with the simple inscription "Katyn, 1940" but it was confiscated by the police, to be replaced with an official monument "To the Polish soldiers <U+2013> victims of Hitlerite fascism <U+2013> reposing in the soil of Katyn". Nevertheless, every year on [[Zaduszki]], similar memorial crosses were erected at [[Pow<U+0105>zki cemetery]] and numerous other places in Poland, only to be dismantled by the police overnight. The Katyn subject remained a political [[taboo]] in Poland until the fall of the Eastern bloc in 1989.<ref name="Fischer"/>

==Revelations==
From the late 1980s, pressure was put not only on the Polish government, but on the Soviet one as well. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history.<ref name="Fischer"/> In 1989 Soviet scholars revealed that [[Joseph Stalin]] had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] admitted that the NKVD had executed the Poles<ref name="yahoo110305">[[Yahoo News]]: Russia says WW2 executions of Poles not genocide [[March 11]] [[2005]] [http://in.news.yahoo.com/050311/137/2k4ff.html online]</ref> and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoje and Pyatikhatki.

On [[30 October]] [[1989]], Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by a Polish association named ''Families of Katy<U+0144> Victims'', to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. [[National Security Advisor (United States)|national security advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]. A [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading "NKVD" on the memorial, covering the word "Nazis" in the inscription such that it read "In memory of Polish officers murdered by the NKVD in 1941." Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds.<ref name="upi301089">[[United Press International]]: Weeping Poles visit Katyn massacre site [[October 30]] [[1989]]</ref> Brzezinski commented that:
:''"It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katy<U+0144>. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here."''<ref name="bbc011189">[[BBC News]]: Commemoration of Victims of Katyn Massacre, [[November 1]] [[1989]]</ref>
Brzezinski further stated that ''"The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here &ndash; and the Soviets know my views &ndash; is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that [[perestroika]] represents.''"<ref name="ap301089">[[Associated Press]]: Brzezinski: Soviets Should Take Responsibility for Katyn Massacre [[October 30]] [[1989]]</ref> His remarks were given extensive coverage on Soviet television.

On [[13 April]] [[1990]], the forty-seventh anniversary of the discovery of the mass graves, the USSR formally expressed "profound regret" and admitted Soviet secret police responsibility.<ref name="fa1990">"CHRONOLOGY 1990; The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe."

After Poles and Americans discovered further evidence in 1991 and 1992, Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] released and transferred to the new Polish president, former Solidarity leader [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]], top-secret documents from the sealed package no. 1.<ref name="PWN_KATY<U+0143>">Encyklopedia PWN, [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/34520_1.html 'KATY<U+0143>'], last retrieved on [[10 December]] [[2005]], Polish language</ref><ref name="Fischer"/> Among the documents included [[Lavrenty Beria]]'s March 1940 proposal<ref name="Russian-scan-fberia">Beria's March 1940 proposal to shoot 25,700 Poles from Kozelsk, Ostashkov, and Starobels camps, and from certain prisons of Western Ukraine and Belarus bearing Stalin's signature (among others).

The investigations that indicted the German state rather than the Soviet state for the killings are sometimes used to impeach the [[Nuremberg Trials]] in their entirety, often in support of [[Holocaust denial]], or to question the legitimacy and/or wisdom of using the criminal law to prohibit Holocaust denial. Still, there are some who deny Soviet guilt, call the released documents fakes, and try to prove that Poles were shot by Germans in 1941.<ref name="frontpagemag">[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=3172 The Lies of Katyn] by [[Jamie Glazov]], [[FrontPageMagazine.com]], [[August 8]] [[2000]], last accessed on [[23 December]] [[2005]]</ref><ref name="fpp">[[Associated Press]], [http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/General/Russians1939.html "Russians still in Denial: Poles Reject Moscow's Statement"], [[September 15]] [[1999]], [[Andrzej Styli<U+0144>ski]], last accessed on [[23 December]] [[2005]]</ref>

On the opposing sides there are allegations that the massacre was part of wider action coordinated by Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, or that Germans at least knew of Katyn beforehand. The reason for these allegations is that Soviet Union and Nazi Germany added on [[28 September]], a secret supplementary protocol<ref name="yale">Nazi-Soviet Relations Page: Secret Supplementary Protocol [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/sesupp1.htm The Avalon Project at Yale Law School]</ref> to the [[German-Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty]], in which they stated that ''Both parties will tolerate in their territories no Polish agitation which affects the territories of the other party. They will suppress in their territories all beginnings of such agitation and inform each other concerning suitable measures for this purpose'', after which in 1939&ndash;1940 a series of conferences by NKVD and Gestapo were organised in the town of [[Zakopane]]. The aim of these conferences was to coordinate the killing and the deportation policy<ref name="jankowski">[http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/jankowski1.htm Holocaust of Non-Jewish Poles During WWII], Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski, Courtesy of Polish American Congress, Washington Metropolitan Area Division.</ref> and exchange experience. A [[University of Cambridge]] professor of history  [[George Watson (historian)|George Watson]] believes that the fate of Polish prisoners was discussed at the conference.<ref name="watson">[http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/wwii/special.studies/katyn.massacre/katynlrc.txt] THE KATYN MASSACRE: AN ASSESSMENT OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE AS A PUBLIC AND HISTORICAL ISSUE IN THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN 1940<U+2013>1993], A Thesis by Louis Robert Coatney</ref> This theory surfaces in Polish media,<ref name="saga">[http://www.saga.org.pl/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=636 Katy<U+0144> ... kto wiedzia<U+0142>?] Mariusz Ole<U+015B>kiewicz, The [[SAGA Foundation]], 2 maja 2005.</ref> where it is also pointed out that similar massacre of Polish elites ([[AB-Aktion]]) were taking place in the exact time and with similar methods in German occupied Poland.

In June 1998, Yeltsin and Polish President [[Aleksander Kwa<U+015B>niewski]] agreed to construct memorial complexes at Katyn and Mednoye, the two NKVD execution sites on Russian soil. However in September that year Russians also raised the issue of Soviet POWs death in the [[Camps for Russian prisoners and internees in Poland (1919-1924)]]. About 15,000&ndash;20,000 POWs died in those camps due to epidemic (especially [[Spanish flu]]), however some Russian officials argued that it was 'a genocide comparable to Katy<U+0144>'.<ref name="Fischer"/> Similar claim was raised in 1994; such attempts are seen by some, particularly in Poland, as a highly provocative Russian attempt to create an 'anti-Katyn' and 'balance the historical equation'.<ref name="Sanford">[[George Sanford]], ''Katyn And The Soviet Massacre Of 1940: Truth, Justice And Memory'', Routledge, 2005, ISBN 0-415-33873-5, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415338735&id=PZXvUuvfv-oC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA7&dq=Polish+independence+1920&sig=vi445g5aB6gH6AhMdWPVpJbRh1A Google Print, p.8]</ref>

During Kwa<U+015B>niewski's visit to Russia in September 2004, Russian officials announced that they are willing to transfer all the information on the Katyn Massacre to the Polish authorities as soon as it is [[declassified]].<ref name="rferl299094">[[Radio Free Europe]], [http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2004/09/1-RUS/rus-290904.asp ...DESPITE POLAND'S STATUS AS 'KEY ECONOMIC PARTNER], Newsline Wednesday, [[29 September]] [[2004]] Volume 8 Number 185, last accessed on [[2 January]] [[2006]]</ref> In March 2005 Russian authorities ended the decade-long investigation with no one charged. Russian Chief Military Prosecutor [[Alexander Savenkov]] put the final Katyn death toll at 14,540 and declared that the massacre was not a [[genocide]] <U+2013> a [[war crime]] <U+2013> or a [[crime against humanity]] but a military crime for which the 50-year term of limitation has expired and that consequently ''there is absolutely no basis to talk about this in judicial terms.''

==Katyn in fiction==

The Katyn massacre is a major plot element in many works of fiction, for example, in the [[W.E.B. Griffin]] novel ''The Lieutenants'' which is part of the [[Brotherhood of War (book series)|Brotherhood of War]] series, as well as in the novel and film ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]''. Polish poet [[Jacek Kaczmarski]] has dedicated one of his [[sung poetry|sung poems]] to this event.[http://www.kaczmarski.art.pl/tworczosc/wiersze_alfabetycznie/kaczmarskiego/k/katyn.php] The award-winning Polish film director [[Andrzej Wajda]] [http://www.wajda.pl/en/kalendarium.html] begun work on a film depicting the event in 2006, the production title of which is "Post-Mortem: The Katyn story". The film will recount the fate of some of the women - mothers, wives and daughters - of the Polish officers slaughtered by the Soviets. Some Katyn Forest scenes will be re-enacted. The screenplay is based on Andrzej Mularczyk's book of the same title. The film is produced by Akson Studio, and planned for release in the Autumn of 2007.
