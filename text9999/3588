'''All Ends''' is an [[alternative metal]] band from [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]], founded in 2003. It started as a [[side project]] of the [[In Flames]] guitarists [[Bj<U+00F6>rn Gelotte]] and [[Jesper Str<U+00F6>mblad]], but currently they are no longer playing with All Ends.

== History ==
With the initial line-up of Jesper Str<U+00F6>mblad and Bj<U+00F6>rn Gelotte handling guitars, Emma Gelotte and Tinna Karlsdotter doing vocals, and Joseph Skans<U+00E5>s playing drums, they recorded a 5-song [[demo (music)|demo]]. The demo was recorded at [[Studio Fredman]] and produced by [[Fredrik Nordstr<U+00F6>m]] and [[Patrik Jerksten|Patrick J. Sten]].

In the spring of 2005, Michael H<U+00E5>kansson took over bass duties and Fredrik Johansson took over guitar duties. In August 2005, Peter M<U+00E5>rdklint joined the band as the second guitarist.

The most notable feature of All Ends is the duet vocals provided by the two female singers in the band, Emma Gelotte and Tinna Karlsdotter, against a background of heavy melodies.

All Ends signed a worldwide contract with [[Gun Records]], a division of [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]].  On May 11, 2007, they released their debut EP, ''Wasting Life'', the new line-up also rerecorded the 5 demo songs.

On November 7, 2007, they released their self-titled debut album, which was later reissued with bonus tracks on September 2008.

All Ends took part in the [[Earthshaker Roadshock Tour]] in 2007. They played alongside [[Finntroll]], [[After Forever]], [[Tarot (band)|Tarot]], [[Die Apokalyptischen Reiter]], and [[Machine Men]]. The [[Earthshaker Roadshock Tour]] was cancelled before completion. All Ends also performed in the annual [[Sweden Rock Festival]] throughout its length, June 6<U+2013>9, 2007.

On March 3, 2009, videogame company [[Sega]] released [[Sonic and the Black Knight]]. The game features a vocal song for the final boss battle called "With Me" which features vocals by Emma Gelotte, Tinna Karlsdotter, and [[Johnny Gioeli]] of [[Crush 40]].  The song (as well as its instrumental version) was released on the CD release, "Face To Faith", a compilation of all the vocal songs from [[Sonic and the Black Knight]].

On March 17, 2009, vocalist Emma Gelotte quit the band because of personal reasons. Swedish singer Jonna Sailon joined the band as the replacement vocalist.

News on their second album has started up on All Ends' MySpace page as of October 23, 2009. They state they've completed the pre-production phase of their album and even have a new producer. Roberto Laghi, who previously helped [[In Flames]] record one of their albums, is helping All Ends with their second.<ref>{{cite news |title=Introducing our producer / Pre-production is done.... - ALL ENDS's MySpace Blog |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=22514594&blogId=515600166 |work= MySpace |date=October 23, 2009}}</ref> It is also stated on their MySpace page that they're looking to release their album in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=NEW RECORD 2010 - ALL ENDS's MySpace Blog |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=22514594&blogId=510096008 |work= MySpace |date=September 14, 2009}}</ref>
