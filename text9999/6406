'''Matthew James Bellamy''' (born 9 June 1978) is an [[English people|English]] [[musician]] and [[composer]], who is best known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, pianist, and primary songwriter of the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Muse (band)|Muse]].

==Early life==
Bellamy's father, [[George Bellamy|George]], was the [[rhythm guitarist]] in the 1960s [[rock music|rock]] group [[The Tornados]], who were the first British band to have a United States [[Chart-topper|number one song]], with "[[Telstar (song)|Telstar]]".<ref>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/gig-15352453-details/Muse/gigReview.do?reviewId=23375364 Revelation on stage| Music | This is London<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "[[Knights of Cydonia]]", a single from [[Muse (band)|Muse]]'s fourth album ''[[Black Holes & Revelations]]'', is often cited as a tribute to that song, with its space rock sound and accompanying video depicting a cowboy's quest through an alien landscape. Bellamy's mother, Marilyn, was born in [[Belfast]], and moved to England in the 1970s.  On her first day in England she met George, who was at the time working as a taxi driver in London. They moved to Cambridge, where Matthew's older brother Paul was born, followed a couple of years later by Matthew himself. Bellamy started playing the piano at age 6.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In the mid-1980s the family moved to [[Teignmouth]], [[Devon]]. After the divorce of Bellamy's parents he moved in with his grandmother, who pushed him towards learning to play the guitar at the age of fourteen.

==Muse==
{{Main|Muse_(band)|l1=Muse}}
Muse formed in Teignmouth, Devon in 1994 under the name of Rocket Baby Dolls. Still using the name Rocket Baby Dolls they won the school's battle of the bands which led them to take the band seriously, and decided to change their name to a more "professional" name, Muse. The band is composed of Matthew Bellamy, [[Christopher Wolstenholme]] (bass guitar and backing vocals) and [[Dominic Howard]] (drums and percussion). Muse met at [[Teignmouth Community College]] where Bellamy had been in a number of bands previously including Carnage Mayhem and Gothic Plague with drummer Dominic Howard. When members of Gothic Plague left due to other interests, Bellamy and Howard asked Wolstenholme to join. Muse struggled to establish themselves during their early years but have since gone on to enjoy worldwide commercial success. 

Muse blend [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[classical music]] and [[electronica]] and are well known for their energetic and visually dazzling live performances.<ref>{{cite web

==Musical equipment==
[[Image:MattBellamyToronto2004.jpg|thumb|right|Bellamy performing.]]Bellamy uses custom guitars designed by himself and [[Hugh Manson]] made in [[Exeter]], Devon. He currently has a number of Manson guitars, as well as instruments by other manufacturers including a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] 'Aloha' [[Stratocaster]], a [[Gibson Les Paul Doublecut|Gibson Les Paul DC]] Lite, a [[Gibson SG]], [[Jackson Guitars|Jackson]] ''[[Randy Rhoads]]'' (custom), a [[Parker Fly]], a [[Peavey Guitars|Peavey]] [[EVH]] Wolfgang, a Jay Turser JT-res Resonator and finally a [[Yamaha Pacifica]]. Bellamy's famous Manson shape has been compared to a Yamaha Pacifica, a [[Fender Telecaster]], a [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]] and a [[Godin (Guitar Manufacturer)|Godin]] Triumph. Bellamy stated that he loved the classic guitar that [[Jimi Hendrix]] used.

The first and most famous is his silver Manson (Named Delorean). Bellamy came up with the basic concept for this guitar and Hugh Manson helped him realize it. It has a built-in [[Z.Vex Fuzz Factory]] which gives Bellamy his distinctive sound and the ability to manipulate the pedals oscillation sounds without bending down. In addition, it has an [[MXR Phase 90]] phaser, a Roland midi pickup and uses Bare Knuckle and Kent Armstrong pickups. All of his other Mansons follow this same basic design (apart from Bellamy's 7 string which was not originally built for him but for a local jazz guitarist) with some just having different pickups and finishes, as with his mirrored Manson. Bellamy's black Manson has a MIDI strip that controls a [[Digitech Whammy|Digitech Whammy IV]], when it is connected, a Z.Vex Wah Probe and a number of other built in effects. 

For the 2006 album ''Black Holes and Revelations'', he bought a new guitar, the "Black Kaoss Manson". The guitar features two Bare Knuckle Humbuckers, a [[Fernandes Sustainer|Fernandes Sustainer System]] on the neck and a touch pad which connects to a [[Kaoss Pad|Korg Kaoss Pad]]. He also bought the M1D1, which is similar to the Black Kaoss Manson but has a Bare Knuckle Nail Bomb [[humbucker]] in the bridge position and a Fernandes Sustainer System (FSK-101 model, which is the humbucker version of the latter one) on the neck. He is also known to use an Ibanez Destroyer on stage (Hullabaloo). Bellamy uses [[Diezel]] amp heads, along with [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] Mode Four cabinets, [[Soldano]] Cabinets and [[Line 6]] digital effects. In September 2009, Bellamy has mentioned the extensive use of [http://www.dickinsonamps.com Dickinson amplifiers] on their album [[The Resistance (album)|The Resistance]].<ref>http://board.muse.mu/showpost.php?p=6355786&postcount=9</ref> Most of Bellamy's rack effects are made with Line 6 modules. On 14 April 2009, Manson Guitars announced on their website that they had brought out a line of Matthew Bellamy signature guitars, based on the Seattle, Glitterati and Delorean models. They all have the option of MIDI touch pads.

==Vocal Style==
Bellamy is known for his use of [[falsetto]] and [[vibrato]]. His vocal range spans from an A2 to an A5.<ref>http://www.musewiki.org/Matthew_Bellamy#Vocals</ref>

==Political views==
Bellamy has expressed passionate views on the ideas of [[Georgism]].<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6802083.ece Muse return with new album The Resistance ] "''Sure, he has already launched into a passionate soliloquy about Geoism (the land-tax movement inspired by the 19th-century political economist Henry George)''".</ref>

== Other appearances ==
Bellamy is featured as a playable character in the 2009 video game [[Guitar Hero 5]].

Bellamy also wrote the end credits for the 2009 film [[The International (film)]]

He wrote the song "Soaked", which appears on [[Adam Lambert]]'s d<U+00E9>but album [[For Your Entertainment (album)|For Your Entertainment]].
