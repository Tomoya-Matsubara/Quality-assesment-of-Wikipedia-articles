'''Timothy''' "'''Tim'''" '''Theodore Duncan''' (born April 25, 1976)<ref>[http://www.slamduncan.com/about-qa.php Tim Duncan Q&A], slamduncan.com, accessed January 25, 2008.</ref> is a [[Virgin Islander American]] professional [[basketball]] player for the [[San Antonio Spurs]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The 6-foot 11-inch (2.11&nbsp;m), 260-pound (118&nbsp;kg)<ref name="height">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?statsId=3173 Tim Duncan], espn.com, accessed April 18, 2007.</ref> [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]]/[[center (basketball)|center]] is a four-time NBA champion, a three-time [[NBA Finals Most Valuable Player]], and the current captain of the Spurs. He has also won the [[NBA Rookie of the Year]], [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] twice, and has been voted into 12 [[NBA All-Star Game]]s, 13 [[All-NBA Team]]s, and 13 [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive Teams]].<ref name="stats">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duncati01.html Tim Duncan], basketball-reference.com, accessed May 20, 2008.</ref>

Duncan started out as a swimmer and only began playing basketball in ninth grade, after [[Hurricane Hugo]] destroyed the only Olympic-sized pool on [[St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]]. He soon became a standout for [[St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School]], and had an illustrious college career with the [[Wake Forest University]] [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Demon Deacons]], winning the [[Naismith College Player of the Year]], [[USBWA College Player of the Year]] and [[John Wooden Award|John Wooden]] awards in his final year. Duncan graduated from college before entering the [[1997 NBA Draft]] as the number one pick, and his list of accomplishments, remarkable consistency, and leadership in the Spurs' NBA title runs in [[1999 NBA Finals|1999]], [[2003 NBA Finals|2003]], [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]], and [[2007 NBA Finals|2007]] have led basketball experts to consider him to be one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history.

Off the court, Duncan is known for his quiet and unassuming ways, as well as his active philanthropy. He holds an honors degree in psychology and created the Tim Duncan Foundation to raise general health awareness and fund education and youth sports in various parts of the United States.<ref name="nbabio">[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/tim_duncan/bio.html Tim Duncan <U+2013> Bio], nba.com, accessed August 25, 2007.</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Duncan is the only son of Ione and William Duncan, a midwife and a mason respectively, joining his two older sisters Cheryl and Tricia in a middle-class family in [[Christiansted]], a town on [[St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]], one of the main islands composing the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. In school, Duncan was a bright pupil and dreamt of becoming an Olympic-level swimmer like his sister, [[Tricia Duncan|Tricia]].<ref name="jockbio">[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Duncan/Duncan_bio.html Tim Duncan Biography], jockbio.com, accessed April 19, 2007.</ref><ref name="slamduncanP11">{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=11|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> His parents were very supportive and Duncan excelled at swimming, becoming a teenage standout in the 50, 100 and 400&nbsp;meters [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]] and aiming to make the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]] as a member of the United States Team.<ref name="jockbio" />

When [[Hurricane Hugo]] destroyed the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, forcing Duncan to swim in the ocean, he soon lost enthusiasm because of his fear of sharks.<ref name="nbabio" /> Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] and died one day before his 14th birthday.<ref name="jockbio" /> In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's reluctance to leave college early.<ref name="21Q">[http://www.slamduncan.com/news-21questions.php Questions with Tim Duncan], slamduncan.com, accessed January 13, 2008.</ref> Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.<ref name="21Q" />

Duncan initially had difficulties adapting to the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. Nancy Pomroy, the athletic director of the St. Croix Country Day School was quoted: "[Duncan] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time."<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|pages=20<U+2013>21|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> He overcame this to become a standout for the [[St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School]], averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities, despite having only picked up the game in ninth grade.<ref name="nbabio" /> [[Wake Forest University]] basketball coach [[Dave Odom]] in particular grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star [[Alonzo Mourning]] to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game.<ref name="jockbio" /> Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket.<ref name="jockbio" /> Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation.<ref name="Kernan2831">{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|pages=28<U+2013>31|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention, and discovered that he was not only athletically talented, but also a quick learner.<ref name="Kernan2831" /> Eventually, despite offers by the [[University of Hartford]], the [[University of Delaware]] and [[Providence College]], Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.<ref name="jockbio" />

===Wake Forest University===
{{See also|List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds}}
The Wake Forest Demon Deacons had previously reached the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet 16]], but lost main scorer [[Rodney Rogers]], who had entered the [[1993 NBA Draft]].<ref name="jockbio" /> Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate [[Randolph Childress]] led the Deacons to a 20<U+2013>11 win<U+2013>loss record.<ref name="jockbio" /> Duncan's style of play was simple but effective, combining an array of [[Basketball court#Low post area|low-post]] moves, mid-range [[Basketball moves#Bank shot|bank shots]] and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 [[Goodwill Games]].<ref name="jockbio" /> Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature.<ref name="Kernan2831" /> Despite focusing heavily on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best was quoted: "Tim [...] was one of my more intellectual students. [...] Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest."<ref name="Kernan2831" /> Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as "[[Mr. Spock]]", the prototypical logical, detached character from ''[[Star Trek]]''.<ref name="Kernan2831" />

In the [[1994 in basketball|1994<U+2013>95 NCAA season]], the sophomore was soon called one of the most eligible NBA prospects, along with his peers [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]], [[Rasheed Wallace]] and [[Jerry Stackhouse]].<ref name="jockbio" /> [[Los Angeles Lakers]] general manager [[Jerry West]] suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the [[1995 NBA Draft]] if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone he had no intention of [[professional sports|going pro]] until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie [[salary cap]] in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined to stay in school.<ref name="jockbio" /> In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led [[North Carolina Tar Heels]]. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]] with four seconds left in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]].<ref name="jockbio" /> In the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against [[Oklahoma State]], Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying [[Bryant Reeves]], but his team lost 71<U+2013>66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 12.5 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best [[block (basketball)|shot-blocker]] in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game.<ref name="jockbio" /> He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.<ref name="usabio" />

In the following [[1995 in basketball|1995<U+2013>96 NCAA season]], Wake Forest had to deal with the loss of Childress, who entered the NBA. This provided an opportunity for Duncan to show his leadership qualities, and his inexperienced team lost only four games in the entire ACC season.<ref name="jockbio" /> The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with flu, and his team missed the [[Final Four]] by one win. He completed another remarkable season with averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, and was again voted Defensive and ACC Player of the Year.<ref name="usabio" /> At the season's end the Wake Forest star was rumored to enter the NBA Draft early, but in the end, he stayed in college.<ref name="jockbio" />

In the [[1996 in basketball|1996<U+2013>97 NCAA season]], Duncan was helped by the addition of future NBA player [[Loren Woods]], a 7'1" player who eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket. The Demon Deacons won their first 13 games, but then got into a slump and failed to win a third ACC title.<ref name="jockbio" /> The NCAA campaign was just as frustrating, as [[Stanford University]] led by future NBA [[point guard]] [[Brevin Knight]] eliminated Duncan's team with a 72<U+2013>66 win. Duncan finished with an individually impressive season though, averaging 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.2 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] per game while shooting .606 from the [[field goal percentage|field]] and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for an unprecedented third straight season. He earned first-team [[All-America]] honors for the second time, and was a unanimous pick for both [[USBWA College Player of the Year|USWBA]] and [[Naismith College Player of the Year]].<ref name="jockbio" /> Duncan led the 1996<U+2013>97 NCAA Division I in rebounding, was 10th in blocked shots (3.3 bpg) and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg).<ref name="usabio">[http://www.usabasketball.com/biosmen/tim_duncan_bio.html USA Basketball Bio: Tim Duncan], usabasketball.com, accessed June 15, 2007.</ref> He was voted ACC Player of the Year again and won the 1997 [[John Wooden Award]] as the NCAA's best overall male player based on the votes of sportscasters and newswriters.<ref name="adid">[http://press.adidas.com/en/DesktopDefault.aspx/tabid-16/94_read-1159/ Adidas signs superstar Tim Duncan], press.adidas.com, February 7, 2003, accessed January 13, 2008.</ref>

In contrast to contemporary [[prep-to-pro]] players like [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Jermaine O'Neal]], [[Tracy McGrady]] or [[Kobe Bryant]], Duncan stayed at college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year, and an unprecedented three-time [[NABC Defensive Player of the Year]]. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997, the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997, and was named [[Most Valuable Player]] of the 1996 ACC Tournament. Further, 1996 was the year where he led the conference in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories.<ref name="usabio" /> Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97<U+2013>31 win<U+2013>loss record and finished his college career as the second-leading shot blocker in NCAA history, and remains one of only ten players with more than 2,000 career points and 1,500 career rebounds. He was also the first player in NCAA history to reach 1,500 points, 1,000 rebounds, 400 blocked shots and 200 assists. He left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks<U+2014>second in NCAA annals behind [[Colgate University|Colgate's]] [[Adonal Foyle]] and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds.<ref name="usabio" /> With his college degree in his hands, Duncan finally made himself eligible for the [[1997 NBA Draft]].

==="Twin Towers" (1997<U+2013>2003)===
In the 1997 NBA Draft, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] drafted Duncan with the first draft pick.<ref name="stats" /> The Spurs were coming off a poor [[1996<U+2013>97 NBA season|1996<U+2013>97 season]]; their best player, [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]]<U+2014>himself a number one draft pick [[1987 NBA Draft|in 1987]]<U+2014>was sidelined for most of the year with an injury, and they had finished with a 20<U+2013>62 win<U+2013>loss record.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/standings/19961997.html 1996<U+2013>97 Standings], nba.com/history, accessed April 19, 2007.</ref> However, as the [[1997<U+2013>98 NBA season|1997<U+2013>98 season]] approached, the Spurs were considered a notable threat in the NBA. With an experienced [[center (basketball)|center]] in Robinson and the number one pick in Duncan, the Spurs featured one of the best [[frontcourt]]s in the league. Duncan and Robinson became known as the "Twin Towers", having earned a reputation for their exceptional defense close to the basket, forcing opponents to take lower percentage shots from outside.<ref name="jockbio" /> From the beginning, Duncan established himself as a quality player: in his second-ever road game, he grabbed 22 rebounds against opposing [[Chicago Bulls]] power forward [[Dennis Rodman]], a multiple rebounding champion and [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=47|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> Later, when Duncan played against opposing [[Houston Rockets]] [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall-of-Fame]] power forward [[Charles Barkley]], Barkley was so impressed he said: "I have seen the future and he wears number 21 [Duncan's jersey number]."<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=13|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> In his rookie season, Duncan lived up to expectations of being the number one draft pick, starting in all 82 regular-season games, and averaging 21.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game.<ref name="stats" /> His defensive contributions ensured that he was elected to the [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive Second Team]] and was also named [[NBA Rookie of the Year]], having won the NBA Rookie of the Month award every single month that season.<ref name="nbabio" /><ref>[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Duncan/Duncan_numbers.html Facts], jockbio.com, accessed February 20, 2008.</ref> Spurs coach [[Gregg Popovich]] lauded Duncan's mental toughness, stating his rookie's "demeanor was singularly remarkable", Duncan always "put things into perspective" and never got "too upbeat or too depressed."<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=25|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> Center Robinson was equally impressed with Duncan: "He's the real thing. I'm proud of his attitude and effort. He gives all the extra effort and work and wants to become a better player."<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=44|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref>

The Spurs qualified for the [[1998 NBA Playoffs]] as the fifth [[single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seed]], but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the [[Phoenix Suns]], causing Suns coach [[Danny Ainge]] to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/PHO19980423.html San Antonio Spurs at Phoenix Suns, April 23, 1998], basketball-reference.com, accessed August 30, 2007.</ref> and recording 32 points and 10 rebounds in Game 2,<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/PHO19980425.html San Antonio Spurs at Phoenix Suns, April 25, 1998], basketball-reference.com, accessed August 30, 2007.</ref> contributing to a 3<U+2013>1 victory over the Suns.<ref name="jockbio" /> However, the Spurs lost in the second round to the eventual Western Conference Champions [[Utah Jazz]].<ref name="jazz98">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1998.html 1998 NBA Playoffs], basketball-reference.com, accessed April 19, 2007.</ref> In this series, Duncan was pitted against Hall-of-Fame power forward [[Karl Malone]]. Duncan outscored Malone in the first two games which the Spurs lost,<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/UTA19980505.html San Antonio Spurs at Utah Jazz, May 5, 1998], basketball-reference.com, accessed August 24, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/UTA19980507.html San Antonio Spurs at Utah Jazz, May 7, 1998], basketball-reference.com, accessed August 24, 2007.</ref> but as the series progressed, the more experienced Malone shut Duncan down on defense and dominated on offense, outscoring the young power forward in Games 3 to 5 with 10<U+2013>18,<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/SAS19980509.html Utah Jazz at San Antonio Spurs, May 9, 1998], basketball-reference.com, accessed August 24, 2007.</ref> 22<U+2013>34<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/SAS19980510.html Utah Jazz at San Antonio Spurs, May 10, 1998], basketball-reference.com, accessed August 24, 2007.</ref> and 14<U+2013>24.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/UTA19980512.html San Antonio Spurs at Utah Jazz, May 12, 1998], basketball-reference.com, accessed August 24, 2007.</ref>

[[Image:Duncan Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Duncan at the [[free throw]] line]]
During the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]]-shortened [[1998<U+2013>99 NBA season|1998<U+2013>99 season]], the Spurs started with a lackluster 6<U+2013>8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach, and finished the season with a 31<U+2013>5 run.<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=65|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the [[All-NBA]] and All-Defense First Teams.<ref name="stats" /> In the [[1999 NBA Playoffs]], the Spurs defeated the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] 3<U+2013>1, swept the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] 4<U+2013>0, and defeated the [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella story]] [[New York Knicks]] 4<U+2013>1 in the [[1999 NBA Finals|Finals]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/playoffs/19981999.html 1999 Playoff Results], nba.com/history, accessed April 19, 2007.</ref> In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero,<ref name="Kernan7376">{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|pages=73<U+2013>76|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the "Twin Towers" outscored their Knicks counterparts [[Chris Dudley]]/[[Larry Johnson (basketball)|Larry Johnson]] with 41 points, 26 rebounds and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds and zero blocks.<ref name="Kernan7376" /> After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three [[turnover (basketball)|turnovers]] in the last quarter, Duncan rebounded with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win,<ref name="Kernan7376" /> and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78<U+2013>77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' possession. [[Double team]]ed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks [[swingman]] [[Latrell Sprewell]] missed a last-second desperation shot,<ref name="Kernan7376" /> and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point and 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named [[NBA Finals MVP|Finals MVP]], bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship.<ref name="firsttitle">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/1999/playoffs/news/1999/06/25/spurs_knicks_game5/index.html Duncan, Robinson lead San Antonio to first NBA title], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, June 28, 1999, accessed April 29, 2007.</ref> The accolades for the Spurs soon arrived, with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' reporting that the San Antonio "monkey has been shed", and that the Spurs were no longer known as the "San Antonio softies". The magazine praised Finals MVP Duncan, who was later quoted: "This is incredible. We kept our focus and we pulled it out."<ref name="firsttitle" /> ''Sports Illustrated'' journalist and retired NBA player [[Alex English]] added: "Duncan came up big each time they went to him with that sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [in Game 5]." And Popovich later said to losing coach [[Jeff Van Gundy]]: "I've got Tim [Duncan] and you don't. That's the difference."<ref name="firsttitle" />

In the [[1999<U+2013>2000 NBA season|1999<U+2013>2000 season]], Duncan further cemented his reputation. He averaged 23.2 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.2 blocks per game, earned another pair of All-NBA and All-Defense First Team call-ups, and was co-MVP with [[Shaquille O'Neal]] of the NBA All-Star Game.<ref name="stats" /> However, the Spurs had a disappointing post-season. Duncan injured his [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] shortly before the end of the regular season and was unable to play in even one post-season game.<ref name="nbabio" /> Consequently, the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the [[2000 NBA Playoffs]], losing 3<U+2013>1 to the Phoenix Suns.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/playoffs/19992000.html 2000 Playoff Results], nba.com/history, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> Nonetheless, Duncan rebounded in the [[2000<U+2013>01 NBA season|next season]], and with strong regular-season averages of 22.2 points, 12.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.3 blocks, earned himself yet another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups.<ref name="stats" /> In the [[2001 NBA Playoffs]], the Spurs eliminated the Timberwolves 3<U+2013>1, defeated the [[Dallas Mavericks]] 4<U+2013>1, but then bowed out against the Lakers led by superstars Shaquille O'Neal and [[Kobe Bryant]], losing in four straight games.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/playoffs/20002001.html 2001 Playoff Results], nba.com/history, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> ''Sports Illustrated'' described the series as a "[m]erciless mismatch", and Duncan was criticized as "silent when the Spurs need him most".<ref>''Associated Press'', [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/2001/playoffs/news/2001/05/25/spurs_lakers_ap/ Bryant, Shaq keep Lakers rolling past], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, May 2, 2001, accessed August 24, 2007.</ref>

On the back of two consecutive playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the [[2001<U+2013>02 NBA season|2001<U+2013>02 season]]. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his cumulated 1042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both personal NBA high scores.<ref name="stats" /> Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|league's Most Valuable Player]], joining teammate David Robinson as the only Spurs members to earn the honor.<ref>Badger, T.A., [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/spurs/2002-05-09-duncan-mvp.htm "It's official: Duncan captures MVP award"], usatoday.com, May 10, 2002, accessed August 13, 2007.</ref> On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled with the fact that the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward [[Malik Rose]] had to step in more often.<ref name="jockbio" /> In the [[2002 NBA Playoffs]], the Spurs were outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4<U+2013>1 by the eventual champions.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/playoffs/20012002.html 2002 Playoff Results], nba.com/history, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref> Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: "I thought we really had a chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more than we could handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that's just the way the ball rolls sometimes."<ref name="lakers2002" /> Nevertheless, NBA.com praised Duncan as "phenomenal" and criticized his supporting cast, stating Duncan "made 11-of-23 shots and 12-of-14 free throws, adding four assists and two blocks [a]nd once again, he did not have enough help."<ref name="lakers2002">[http://www.nba.com/games/20020514/SASLAL/recap.html Lakers Roll Past Spurs, Eye Clash With Kings], nba.com, accessed January 13, 2008.</ref> Also, Robinson said "Tim [Duncan] was like Superman out there", and conceded that the Lakers were simply better, just like in the last playoffs campaign.<ref name="lakers2002" />

[[Image:Spurs White House.jpg|thumb|left|Duncan (middle) and the Spurs at the [[White House]] after winning the [[2003 NBA Finals]]]]
The [[2002<U+2013>03 NBA season|2002<U+2013>03 season]] saw Duncan enjoy another standout season in which he averaged 23.3 points, a career-high 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game, and yet another dual All-NBA and All-Defense First Team call-up, resulting in his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award.<ref name="stats" /><ref name="jockbio" /> At age 38, Robinson announced that year as his last season, and his playing time was cut by coach Popovich to save his energy for the playoffs.<ref name="jockbio" /> The Spurs qualified easily for [[2003 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], concluding the regular season as the Conference number one seed with a 60<U+2013>22 record.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/standings/20022003.html 2002<U+2013>03 Standings], nba.com/history, accessed August 28, 2007.</ref> Although San Antonio now had new offensive threats in [[Tony Parker]] and [[Manu Gin<U+00F3>bili]], during the playoffs, it was Duncan's performance in the semi-finals against the Los Angeles Lakers which was singled out for praise by Popovich, who stated: "I thought in Game 5 and Game 6, he [Duncan] was astounding in his focus. He pulled everyone along these last two games."<ref name="lakers2003">[http://www.nba.com/games/20030515/SASLAL/recap.html Spurs, Tim, Dunk Lakers, Head to Conference Finals], nba.com, May 15, 2003, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref> In the series, Duncan was matched up against forward [[Robert Horry]], dominated him the entire series<ref name="lakers2003" /> and closed out the series in style; Duncan finished Game 6 with 37 points and 16 rebounds, allowing Spurs coach Popovich to call [[sport time-out|timeout]] with 2:26 left to instruct his team not to celebrate excessively.<ref name="lakers2003" /> The Spurs made it to the [[2003 NBA Finals|finals]], and defeated the [[New Jersey Nets]] 88<U+2013>77 in Game Six to win their second ever NBA championship.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/playoffs/20022003.html 2003 Playoff Results], nba.com/history, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> Helped by an inspired Robinson, Duncan almost recorded a [[quadruple double]] in the final game,<ref name="williams">Williams, Bryan, [http://www.nba.com/finals2003/game6_030615.html "Feels Like the First Time"], nba.com, June 15, 2003, accessed August 21, 2007.</ref> and was named the NBA Finals MVP.<ref name="nbabio" /> Duncan said of the victory: "We were all confident that something would happen, that we would turn the game to our favor, and it did", but felt sad that Robinson retired after winning his second championship ring.<ref name="williams" /> Following this successful Spurs campaign, Robinson and Duncan were named ''Sports Illustrated''{{'}}s 2003 "[[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]]".<ref>''Associated Press'', [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/basketball/nba/12/08/bc.bkn.spurshonored.ap/ Duncan, Robinson share SI sportsman award], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, December 8, 2003, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref>

[[Image:Duncan Wallace.jpg|thumb|upright|Duncan backs down [[Ben Wallace]] (then of the [[Detroit Pistons|Pistons]]) in a 2005 game.]]
Before the [[2003<U+2013>04 NBA season|2003<U+2013>04 season]] began, the Spurs lost their perennial captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included [[Slovenia]]n center [[Rasho Nesterovi<U+010D>]], defensive stalwart [[Bruce Bowen]], Argentinian [[shooting guard]] Gin<U+00F3>bili and young French point guard Parker. Coming off the bench were [[clutch (sports)|clutch]] shooting power forward [[Robert Horry]], versatile [[Hedo Turkoglu]] and veterans Malik Rose and [[Kevin Willis]].<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAS/2004.html 2003<U+2013>04 San Antonio Spurs], basketball-reference.com, accessed January 13, 2008.</ref> In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant to step into the void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills.<ref name="espn2007finals">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&id=2905018 Duncan says his fourth ring finest of all], sports.espn.go.com, June 18, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007.</ref> Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks,<ref name="stats" /> he led the Spurs into the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference Semifinals]]. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2<U+2013>2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a last-second basket which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard [[Derek Fisher]] hit a [[buzzer beater]] for an upset Lakers win.<ref>''Associated Press'', [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=240513024 Spurs file protest, say clock was 'late'], sports.espn.go.com, May 13, 2004, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref><ref>''Associated Press'', [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=240513024 Box Score Lakers at Spurs 74<U+2013>73], sports.espn.go.com, May 13, 2004, accessed August 30, 2007.</ref> In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4<U+2013>2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as one of the reasons for the loss.<ref>''Associated Press'', [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=240515013 L.A. awaits Wolves-Kings winner], sports.espn.go.com, May 15, 2004, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref>

Duncan and his Spurs looked to re-assert themselves in the next [[2004<U+2013>05 NBA season|2004<U+2013>05 season]]. Despite their new captain's slight statistical slump (20.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.6 blocks per game),<ref name="stats" /> the Spurs won the second seed for the [[2005 NBA Playoffs]] by winning 59 games.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/standings/2004/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Div.html 2004<U+2013>05 Standings], nba.com, accessed September 6, 2007.</ref> In the first round, the Spurs eliminated the [[Denver Nuggets]] four games to one, and met the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in the semi-finals. After splitting the first four games, Duncan led his team to two decisive victories,<ref name="jockbio" /> setting up a meeting with the [[Phoenix Suns]], known for their up-tempo basketball. The Spurs managed to beat the Suns at their own game, defeating them 4<U+2013>1<ref name="jockbio" /> and earning a spot in the [[2005 NBA Finals]] against the [[Detroit Pistons]]. In the Finals, Duncan was pitted against Detroit's defensively strong frontcourt anchored by multiple [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year]] [[Ben Wallace]]. After two convincing Game 1 and 2 wins for the Spurs, the Pistons [[double team]]ed Duncan and forced him to play further from the basket.<ref name="jockbio" /> Detroit won the next two games and the series was eventually tied at 3<U+2013>3, but Duncan was instrumental in Game 7, recording 25 points and 11 rebounds as the Spurs defeated the Pistons.<ref name="dethrone">[http://www.nba.com/games/20050623/DETSAS/recap.html Spurs Dethrone Pistons To Take Third NBA Title], nba.com, June 23, 2005, accessed April 20, 2007.</ref> NBA.com reported that "[w]ith his unique multidimensional talent, Duncan depleted and dissected the Pistons... He was the fulcrum of virtually every key play down the stretch", and coach Popovich added: "[Duncan's] complete game is so sound, so fundamental, so unnoticed at times, because if he didn't score, people think, 'Well, he didn't do anything'. But he was incredible and he was the force that got it done for us."<ref name="dethrone" /> Detroit's center Ben Wallace remarked: "He put his team on his shoulders and carried them to a championship [...t]hat's what the great players do."<ref name="dethrone" /> Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award, joining [[Michael Jordan]], Shaquille O'Neal, and [[Magic Johnson]] as the only players in NBA history to win it three times.<ref name="nbabio" />

[[Image:TD shooting over Andrew Bynum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Duncan going up for a shot over the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers']] [[Andrew Bynum]]]]
During the [[2005<U+2013>06 NBA season|2005<U+2013>06 season]], Duncan suffered from [[plantar fasciitis]] for most of the season,<ref>Allen, Marque, [http://www.nba.com/spurs/doc/prognosis_060313.html "Prognosis Spurs: Plantar Fasciitis"], nba.com/spurs, March 13, 2006, accessed August 12, 2007.</ref> which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances.<ref name="stats" /> The big man came back strong in the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]] against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward [[Dirk Nowitzki]] 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center [[Erick Dampier]] able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense.<ref name="damp">[http://www.nba.com/games/20060522/DALSAS/recap.html Nowitzki, Mavericks Outlast and Dethrone Spurs], nba.com, May 22, 2006, accessed May 22, 2007.</ref> But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and [[Keith Van Horn]], Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center [[DeSagana Diop]], and the Spurs lost Game 7.<ref name="damp" />

The [[2006<U+2013>07 NBA season|following season]] however was another championship year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan averaged 20.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 blocks per game in the regular season,<ref name="stats" /> and was selected as a Western Conference starter for the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game]], his ninth appearance in the event. In [[2007 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], he led the Spurs to a 4<U+2013>1 series win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4<U+2013>2 win over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4<U+2013>1 win against the [[Utah Jazz]] in the Western Conference Finals, setting up a meeting with the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in [[2007 NBA Finals|the Finals]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/series/index.html At a Glance 2007], nba.com, June 14, 2007, accessed June 9, 2007.</ref> There, the Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4<U+2013>0, earning Duncan his and San Antonio's fourth ever championship.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/finals2007/series/index.html Parker, Spurs Close Out Cavs for Fourth Title], nba.com, June 15, 2007, accessed June 15, 2007.</ref> Duncan proclaimed that that championship was "the best" of his four championships, and acknowledged he played "sub-par" and thus received only one vote for NBA Finals MVP from a panel of ten.<ref name="espn2007finals">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&id=2905018 Duncan says his fourth ring finest of all], espn.com, June 18, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007.</ref> His colleagues were more appreciative of Duncan; among others, ex-teammate David Robinson referred to the Spurs titles as the "Tim Duncan era", and lauded his leadership. Coach Popovich also praised Duncan: "Tim is the common denominator. He's [had] a different cast around him [in] '99, '03 and '05. He's welcomed them all. [...] But he is that easy to play with, and his skills are so fundamentally sound that other people can fit in."<ref name="espn2007finals" /> NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] added: "[Duncan] is a player for the ages. I'm a tennis fan, and [[Pete Sampras]] is one of the greats. OK, he wasn't [[Andre Agassi]] or [[John McEnroe]]. He just happens to be one of the greatest players of all time. You take great players as you find them."<ref name="espn2007finals" />

===Chasing the fifth championship (2007<U+2013>present)===
With Duncan being healthy for 78 games and posting typical 20/10 numbers,<ref name="nbastat">[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/tim_duncan/career_stats.html Tim Duncan <U+2013> Career Stats and Totals], nba.com, accessed April 21, 2008.</ref> San Antonio concluded the [[2007<U+2013>08 NBA season|2007<U+2013>08]] regular season with a 56<U+2013>26 record, finishing behind the Lakers and [[New Orleans Hornets]] in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Suns. The Suns<U+2014>defeated by the Spurs in three of the past four seasons of playoffs<U+2014>were out for revenge and featured a new player in four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal. In Game 1, Duncan set the tone with a 40-point game and a rare [[three-pointer]] that sent the game into double overtime.<ref>White, Elizabeth, [http://www.nba.com/games/20080419/PHXSAS/recap.html Duncan Scores 40 to Lead Spurs to Game 1 Win Over Suns"], nba.com, April 19, 2008, accessed May 1, 2008.</ref> The trio of Duncan, Gin<U+00F3>bili and Parker continued playing to form for the remainder of the series, and the Spurs eliminated the Suns in five games.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2008/series/series_w1s3.html Spurs KO Rattled Suns to Close Out Series], nba.com, April 30, 2008, accessed May 1, 2008.</ref> In the first game of the next round against the [[Chris Paul]]-led Hornets, San Antonio were badly defeated 101<U+2013>82 as Duncan played one of the worst playoff games in his career, recording only 5 points and 3 rebounds.<ref>''Associated Press'', [http://www.nba.com/games/20080503/SASNOH/recap.html West, Hornets Sting Spurs in Game 1], nba.com, May 4, 2008, accessed May 5, 2008.</ref> The Spurs dropped the next game as well, but recovered in Games 3 and 4, with Duncan putting up a team-high 22 point/15 rebound/4 block performance in the game that tied the series.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20080511/NOHSAS/boxscore.html Hornets at Spurs Game Info], nba.com, May 11, 2008, accessed May 12, 2008.</ref> Duncan then recorded 20 points and 15 rebounds in Game 6,<ref>''Associated Press'', [http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280515024 Ginobili, Duncan dominate as Spurs force Game 7], scores.espn.go.com, May 15, 2008, accessed May 16, 2008.</ref> and the Spurs relied on their experience to seal the series in Game 7.<ref>''Associated Press'', [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280519003 Spurs outlast youthful Hornets, win Game 7 to advance to conference finals], sports.espn.go.com, accessed May 26, 2008.</ref> However, arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers defeated San Antonio in five games in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.<ref>''Associated Press'', [http://www.nba.com/games/20080529/SASLAL/recap.html Bryant Leads Lakers past Spurs, into NBA Finals], nba.com, May 29, 2008, accessed June 14, 2008.</ref>

Duncan started the [[2008<U+2013>09 NBA season|2008<U+2013>09 season]] with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his performance declined and he was subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee [[tendinosis]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3934515 Duncan out with quad tendinosis], sports.espn.go.com, accessed July 18, 2009.</ref> Despite Duncan having problems with his knee and the team losing the services of shooting guard Gin<U+00F3>bili for most of the season, San Antonio qualified for [[2009 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] as the third seed with a 54<U+2013>28 record.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2009.html 2008<U+2013>09 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed April 16, 2009.</ref><ref name="2009pred">Hollinger, John, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/columns/story?columnist=hollinger_john&page=PERDiem-090417 PER Diem: April 17, 2009], sports.espn.go.com, accessed April 19, 2009.</ref> Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, [[Michael Finley]] and [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] were all in their late 30s), however, the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship.<ref name="2009pred" /> As it turned out, Duncan and Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4<U+2013>1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000.<ref>Weber, Paul, [http://www.nba.com/games/20090428/DALSAS/recap.html "Mavericks oust Spurs from playoffs with 106<U+2013>93 win"], nba.com, April 29, 2009, accessed April 29, 2009.</ref>

With the Spurs looking to provide a more solid supporting cast in the [[2009<U+2013>10 NBA season|2009<U+2013>10 season]], they acquired [[Richard Jefferson]], [[Theo Ratliff]], [[Antonio McDyess]], [[DeJuan Blair]], and [[Keith Bogans]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4495600 Bogans to join 5th team in 7 seasons], sports.espn.go.com, September 23, 2009, accessed September 24, 2009.</ref> The team got off to a 5<U+2013>6 start, but a series of double double performances by Duncan gave them a 9<U+2013>6 record by the end of November.

In 1998 Duncan was selected as one of the last two players for the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States national team]] for the [[World Basketball Championship]]. However, this team was later replaced with [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA]] and college players because of the [[1998<U+2013>99 NBA lockout|NBA lockout]].<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/07/archive/main13393.shtml NBA Stars Locked Out Of Team USA], cbsnews.com, accessed August 28, 2008.</ref> Duncan's first chance at playing for the national team came in 1999 when he was called up to the Olympic Qualifying Team. He averaged 12.7 ppg, 9.1 rpg and 2.4 bpg and led the team to a 10<U+2013>0 finish en route to a qualifying berth for the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]], but a knee injury forced him to stay out of the [[Olympic Games]] themselves.<ref name="usabio" />

In 2003, Duncan was also a member of the USA team that recorded ten wins and qualified for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="usabio" /> He started all the games he played in and averaged team bests of 15.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.56 bpg, while shooting 60.7 percent from the field.<ref name="usabio" /> At the Olympics itself, the team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal.<ref name="usa2">[http://www.usabasketball.com/history/moly_2004.html USA Basketball: Men's Olympic History <U+2013> 2004], usabasketball.com, accessed April 19, 2007.</ref> The record represented more losses in a single year than in the 68 previous years combined. It was also the first time since NBA professionals became eligible that the U.S. men's basketball team returned home without gold medals.<ref name="usa2" /> After the tournament, Duncan commented, "I am about 95 percent sure my [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]] career is over. I'll try not to share my experiences with anyone."<ref>''Associated Press'', [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/olympics/2004/basketball/08/28/usa.lithuania.ap/index.html U.S. men's avenge loss to Lithuania, earn bronze], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, August 28, 2004, accessed January 13, 2008.</ref> In total, Duncan was a member of five USA Basketball teams and played in 40 international games.<ref name="usabio" />

==Player profile==
[[Image:Spurs vs. Lakers.jpg|thumb|Duncan (#21) attempts to [[block (basketball)|block]] [[Kobe Bryant|Kobe Bryant's]] shot in a game against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[Staples Center]].]]
Duncan starts at the [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] position, but can also play [[center (basketball)|center]]. With a [[double-double]] career average in points and rebounds, he is considered one of the most consistent players in the NBA.<ref name="dethrone" /> He has earned All-NBA and [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] honors every season since his rookie year in 1998 while being a perennial candidate for the [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] and [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year]] awards.<ref name="stats" /><ref>[http://www.nba.com/news/alldefensive_070430.html San Antonio Teammates Bowen and Duncan Top 2006<U+2013>07 NBA All-Defensive Team Selections], nba.com, April 30, 2007, accessed May 1, 2007.</ref> Regarded as one of the league's best interior defenders, Duncan also ranks consistently as one of the top [[point (basketball)|scorers]], [[rebound (basketball)|rebounders]] and [[block (basketball)|shot-blockers]] in the league.<ref name="stats" /> As of the 2009<U+2013>10 season, he is ranked third in regular season point-rebound double-doubles.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/fc/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&player=&match=career&is_playoffs=N&year_min=1987&year_max=2010&age_min=0&age_max=99&team_id=&opp_id=&game_location=&game_result=&is_starter=&pos=&c1stat=trb&c1comp=gt&c1val=10&c2stat=pts&c2comp=gt&c2val=10&c3stat=&c3comp=gt&c3val=&c4stat=&c4comp=gt&c4val=&order_by=pts Player Game Finder], basketball-reference.com, accessed July 2, 2009.</ref> His main weakness remains his [[free throw]] shooting, with a career average of less than 70%.<ref name="stats" />

Apart from his impressive statistics, Duncan has gained a reputation as a good clutch player, as evidenced by his three NBA Finals MVP awards and his playoff career averages being higher than his regular-season statistics.<ref name="stats" /> Eleven-time NBA champion [[Bill Russell]] further compliments Duncan on his passing ability, and rates him as one of the most efficient players of his generation,<ref name="bill">Russell, Bill, [http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/news/billrussell_postseason.html "Quality Basketball"], nba.com, May 29, 2007, accessed June 4, 2007.</ref> a view shared by 19-time NBA All-Star [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]].<ref>Hareas, John, [http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/03/10/kareem.20090310/index.html "Q&A: Kareem on teaching, the Lakers and Tim Duncan"], nba.com, March 10, 2009, accessed March 12, 2009.</ref> Because of his versatility and success, basketball experts have spoken of Duncan as one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history,<ref name="dethrone" /><ref name="PF">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2074360 ESPN.com's Greatest Power Forwards], espn.com, June 2, 2005, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref><ref>Rosen, Charley, [http://web.archive.org/web/20050719002301/http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/3747894 "Best all-time power forwards"], foxsports.com, July 18, 2005, accessed January 31, 2008.</ref><ref>DuPree, David, [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/spurs/2007-06-06-bonus-duncan_N.htm "Tim Duncan: best power forward ever?"], usatoday.com, June 7, 2007, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref><ref>Thomsen, Ian, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/magazine/specials/sportsman/2007/11/08/thomsen.duncan/index.html "My Sportsman: Tim Duncan"], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, November 15, 2007, accessed November 25, 2007.</ref> while coach Popovich and team-mates Parker and Gin<U+00F3>bili have also credited much of San Antonio's success to him.<ref>White, Elizabeth, [http://www.salisburypost.com/sports/346573904041145.php "NBA: Duncan's calm creates confidence"], salisburypost.com, June 7, 2007, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://usa.manuginobili.com/htm/especiales/temp0607/31_05_manu.htm Exclusive interview with Manu], usa.manuginobili.com, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref> Duncan's detractors, however, label him as "boring" because of his simple but effective style of play (thus earning him the nickname "The Big Fundamental"). Following his first championship ring in 1999, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' described him as a "quiet, boring MVP",<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/1999/playoffs/news/1999/06/25/duncan_boring/ Duncan: A quiet, boring MVP], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, June 28, 1999, accessed August 6, 2007.</ref> a characterization which persists today.<ref name="bill" />

Duncan himself commented on his "boring" image, stating: "If you show excitement, then you also may show disappointment or frustration. If your opponent picks up on this frustration, you are at a disadvantage."<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=23|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> Sports journalist Kevin Kernan commented on his ability to relax and stay focused, stating that having a degree in psychology, Duncan often not only outplays, but outpsychs his opponents.<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=21|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> Duncan has also stated that he especially likes his [[Basketball moves#Bank shot|bank shot]], saying: "It is just easy for me. It just feels good."<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=35|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref>

==Off the court==
Tim Duncan has two older sisters, Cheryl and [[Tricia Duncan|Tricia]].<ref name="jockbio" /> Like their younger brother, they were gifted athletes: Cheryl was a championship swimmer before she became a nurse, and Tricia swam for the U.S. Virgin Islands at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=19|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> He married his wife Amy in 2001,<ref name="nbabio" /> and the couple had their first child, daughter Sydney, in the summer of 2005,<ref name="nbabio" /> and a second child, a son, during the summer of 2007. Amy oversees the Tim Duncan Foundation, which has been established to serve the areas of health awareness/research, education, and youth sports/recreation in San Antonio, [[Winston-Salem]], and the United States Virgin Islands.<ref name="nbabio" /> The Foundation holds two major [[fundraiser]]s each year: the annual Tim Duncan Bowling for Dollar$ Charity Bowl-A-Thon and the annual Slam Duncan Charity Golf Classic.<ref name="nbabio" /> Between 2001 and 2002, the Foundation raised more than $350,000 to help fight breast and [[prostate cancer]].<ref name="adid" /> In those two years, Duncan was named by ''[[Sporting News]]'' as one of the "Good Guys" in sports.<ref name="adid" /> The Spurs captain also supports the Children's Bereavement Center, the Children's Center of San Antonio and the Cancer Therapy and Research Center.<ref name="nbabio" />

Duncan cites his late mother Ione as his main inspiration. Among other things, she taught him and his sisters the nursery rhyme "Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest / Until your Good is Better, and your Better is your Best", which he adopted as his personal motto.<ref name="21Q" /> On and off the court, he believes that the three most important values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie.<ref name="21Q" /> The Spurs captain has also stated that he chose #21 for his jersey because that was his brother-in-law's college number, since he was Duncan's main basketball inspiration, and cites Hall-of-Fame [[Los Angeles Lakers]] point guard [[Magic Johnson]] as his childhood idol.<ref name="21Q" />

For his mixture of success and low-key personality, Duncan has been honored with the St. Croix Medal of Honor, the highest award that the territorial government can bestow on a citizen, and has been celebrated in several "Tim Duncan Day" ceremonies.<ref name="slamduncanP24-26">{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|pages=24<U+2013>26|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> In 2000, St. Croix Senate president Vargrave Richards said: "He is a quiet giant. His laid-back attitude is the embodiment of the people of St. Croix, doing things without fanfare and hoopla."<ref name="slamduncanP24-26" />

Regarding his own personality, Duncan compares himself to Will Hunting of the movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', which centers around the genial and antagonistic character of Will Hunting, portrayed by [[Matt Damon]]. He stated: "I'm just a taller, slightly less hyperactive version of the Damon character in the movie. I really enjoyed how he probed people and found out their weaknesses just by asking questions and stating outlandish remarks."<ref name="slamduncanP53">{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=53|isbn=978-1582611792}}</ref> He also admitted shunning the limelight because "[fame] is not me".<ref name="slamduncanP53" /> Off the court, he has stated that his best friend is former Spurs colleague [[Antonio Daniels]], who himself describes Duncan as a cheerful, funny person off the hardwood.<ref name="slamduncanP11" />

Duncan also loves [[Renaissance fair]]s and the fantasy [[role playing game]] [[Dungeons & Dragons]].<ref name="briggs">Briggs, Jerry, "Duncan's unusual hobby and more unusual request", ''San Antonio Express-News (Texas)'', November 30, 1997.</ref> An avid [[video game]] player, he acknowledges a certain joy of playing "himself" on basketball video games. Duncan states if he had the chance, he would challenge NBA legends [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] to a one-on-one game.<ref name="21Q" />
