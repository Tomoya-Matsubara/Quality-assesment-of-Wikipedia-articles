'''''Fort Stikine''''' was a British [[Fort ship]] which was built in Canada in 1942. Owned by the American [[War Shipping Administration]], she was leased under [[bareboat charter|charter]] to the [[Ministry of War Transport]] under the [[Lend-Lease]] scheme and operated under the management of the [[Port Line]]. ''Fort Stikinne'' only had a short career, and was destroyed in [[Bombay Explosion (1944)|an explosion]] at [[Bombay]], [[British Raj|India]], in April 1944 that caused the loss of a further thirteen ships.

==Construction==
''Fort Stikine'' was {{convert|441|ft|5|in|m|2}} long, with a beam of {{convert|57|ft|2|in|m|2}}. She had a depth of {{convert|35|ft|0|in|m|2}} and a draught of {{convert|26|ft|11.5|in|m|2}}. The ship was propelled by a 505 [[nominal horsepower|NHP]] [[triple expansion steam engine]] which was built by the Dominion Engineering Works, [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. It had cylinders of 24{{frac|1|2}} inches (62&nbsp;cm)<!--{{convert|24.5|in|cm}}-->, {{convert|37|in|cm}} and {{convert|70|in|cm}} bore by {{convert|48|in|cm}} stroke.<ref name=Stikine43>{{cite web |url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=43b0370.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, NAVIRES A VAPEUR ET A MOTEURS |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref>

To replace the cargo offloaded at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw [[cotton]] were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, [[resin]], [[rice]], [[iron|scrap iron]], [[sulphur]], and [[timber]]. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of [[lubricant|lubricating oil]]. The ship's captain was concerned about having to take the flammable items but was told that they had to go. A proposal to add 750 drums of [[turpentine]] was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the [[United States Government]] had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously combust]]. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi.<ref name=EB/> ''Fort Stikine'' sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB&nbsp;74,<ref name=Port/> which had departed from [[Bandar Abbas]], Iran on 6 April.

==Loss==
{{main|Bombay Explosion (1944)}}
''Fort Stikine'' arrived at Bombay in the early morning of 12 April. Having taken on a [[maritime pilot|pilot]] shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday. The practice of flying a red flag to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels in the event of an enemy air raid on a port. Also, the practice on unloading such vessels into [[lighter (barge)|lighters]] offshore had also been discontinued due to the war. At the time, explosives were graded as Category A, B, or C. Category A explosives, such as those carried on board ''Fort Stikine'', were the most dangerous. These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters, and not directly to the quayside.<ref name=EB/>

Unloading of ''Fort Stikine'' began with the lubricating oil, followed by the fish manure. An extra gang of [[stevedore]]s were employed on this task, which continued through the night of 13<U+2013>14 April. At midday on 13 April, lighters arrived for the explosives. Minor engine repairs also started at that time, rendering the ship unable to move under her own power. At 12:30, the Chief Officer of {{SS|Fort Crevier||2}} noticed smoke issuing from the ventilators of the <U+2116> 2 hold of ''Fort Stikine''. This was also seen a short time later by a [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship|DEMS]] gunner on board {{SS|Iran|1919|2}}. Despite being seen by these (and other) witnesses, everyone assumed that the situation was under control. The alarm was not raised until 13:45. The fire pump in the ship's engine room was started and the firefighting operation began.<ref name=EB/>

With crew members and stevedores abandoning ship, it was realised by the dock authorities that there was a problem on board ''Fort Stikine''. A fire crew was sent on board and an order was given for more [[fire appliance|fire engines]] to be sent for. Due to difficulties in contacting the fire control centre, initially only two engines were sent. Those on board ''Fort Stikine'' were unable to discover the seat of the fire and water was poured blindly into the hold. With the arrival of the two fire appliances, there were now eleven hoses in use. Captain Oberst, of the [[Indian Army Ordnance Corps]] arrived a few minutes later to assess the situation. He was in charge of the explosives only after they had been landed. A meeting was held on board between the ship's officers, Oberst, and Commander Longmore of the [[Royal Indian Navy]], the Chief Salvage Officer in Bombay. It was stated by Oberst that ''Fort Stikine'' had explosives equivalent to 150 [[Blockbuster bomb]]s on board and that the ship should be [[scuttling|scuttled]]. Her captain countered that the boiler room and engine room could be flooded, but he doubted that the ship would sink in that condition. More fire appliances arrived, bringing the total number of hoses in use to 32. by 14:45, ammunition in <U+2116> 2 hold was exploding. Colonel Sadler, the General Manager of the docks at Bombay, was sent for. He arrived at 14:50 and suggested that ''Fort Stikine'' should be removed from the docks, which would have required the use of [[tugboat|tugs]] due to ''Fort Stikine'' being disabled. An argument developed and Colonel Sadler's parting remark was that the ship would probably explode before she could be taken out of port.<ref name=EB/>

[[File:Bombay-Docks-aftermath1.png|thumb|A cloud of smoke over Bombay following the first explosion on board ''Fort Stikine''.]]
Shortly after 15:00, two [[fireboat]]s, the ''Doris'' and ''Panwell'', arrived. A further nine hoses were played on the ship. Neither of the two people who could have taken overall charge of the situation were contactable, and none of those on board ''Fort Stikine'' were willing to take charge. Firefighting continued, but at 15:50 a flame erupted from the hold, reaching higher than the ship's mast. The order was given to abandon ship, with some jumping from the ship onto the quayside, and others into the water. At 16:06, an explosion occurred on board ''Fort Stikine''. The ship was split in two, with her boiler found half a mile (800m) away. The explosion caused a [[tsunami]] within the dock, which deposited one vessel on the quayside. At 16:33, a second explosion occurred. The cargo ship {{SS|Jalapadma|1926|2}} had her stern blown off. It landed about {{convert|200|yd|m}} away. This explosion also wrecked the cargo liner {{SS|Baroda||2}}.<ref name=EB/>

===Investigation===
The accident was investigated by the authorities at Bombay. The report was released on 11 September 1944 and concluded that the fire and subsequent explosion on ''Fort Stikine'' was an accident. Sabotage was ruled out. The death toll was given as 231 service and port personnel killed, with 476 injured. Civilian casualties were in excess of 500 killed, with 2,408 treated in hospital.<ref name=Times120944>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=THE EXPLOSIONS AT BOMBAY |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=12 September 1944 |page_number=3 |issue=49556 |column=E }}</ref>
