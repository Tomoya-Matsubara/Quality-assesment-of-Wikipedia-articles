[[File:Magpie lane.jpg|right|upright|thumb|200px|[[Magpie Lane, Oxford|Magpie Lane]] in [[Oxford]], once known as Gropecunt Lane]] 
'''Gropecunt Lane''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8><U+0261>ro<U+028A>pk<U+028C>nt <U+02C8>l<U+025B><U+026A>n}}) was a [[street name]] found in English towns and cities during the [[Middle Ages]], believed to be a reference to the [[prostitution]] centred on those areas; it was normal practice for a medieval street name to reflect the street's function or the economic activity taking place within it.  Gropecunt, the earliest known use of which is in about 1230, appears to have been derived as a compound of the words ''[[grope]]'' and ''[[cunt]]''.<ref name="HoltBakerpp201202">{{Harvnb|Holt|Baker|2001|pp=201&ndash;202.}}</ref>  Streets with that name were often in the busiest parts of medieval towns and cities, and at least one appears to have been an important thoroughfare.

Although the name was once common throughout England,<ref name="Harbenp164"/> changes in attitude resulted in its being replaced by more innocuous versions such as Grape Lane. Gropecunt was last recorded as a street name in 1561.

==Toponymy==
Variations include Gropecunte, Gropecountelane, Gropecontelane, Groppecountelane, and Gropekuntelane. There were once many such street names in England, but all have now been [[Expurgation|bowdlerised]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Holt|Baker|2001|pp=202&ndash;203.}}</ref> In the city of [[York]], for instance, Grapcunt Lane<U+2014>''gr<U+0101>p'' is the [[Old English]] word for grope<ref name=OEDGrope>{{citation |title=grope |series=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/ |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |edition=2 |year=1989 |accessdate=2009-04-06|postscript=.}}</ref><U+2014>was renamed as the more acceptable Grape Lane.

The first record of the word 'grope' being used in the indecent sense of sexual touching appears in 1380;<ref name=OEDGrope /> ''cunt'' has been used to describe the [[vulva|female external genital organs]] since at least 1230, and corresponds to the [[Old Norse]] ''kunta'', although its [[etymology]] is uncertain.<ref name=OEDCunt>{{citation |title=cunt |series=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/ |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2 |year=1989 |accessdate=2009-04-06|postscript=.}}</ref>

==Prostitution==

The routes of three extinct streets are highlighted in blue, Puppekirtylane on the left, "Grope Countlane" in the middle, and Bordhawlane on the right.  The location is opposite the modern-day [[Mercers' Hall]].<ref name="Holtbakerp206"/>  Little Friday Street (Pissing Alley) is visible on the left.]]
Under its entry for the word ''cunt'', the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' reports that a street was listed as Gropecuntlane in about 1230, the first appearance of that name.<ref name=OEDCunt /> Organised prostitution was well established in [[London]] by the middle of the 12th century, initially mainly confined to [[Southwark]] in the southeast, but later spreading to other areas such as [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], [[Shoreditch]], [[Clerkenwell]], and [[Westminster]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McIntyre|2006|pp=255&ndash;256.}}</ref>  The practice was often tolerated by the authorities, and there are many historical examples of it being dealt with by regulation rather than by censure: in 1393 the authorities in London allowed prostitutes to work only in Cocks Lane,<ref>In passus 5 of ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' the writer mentions a "Clarice of Cokkeslane and the Clerk of the chirche". It is unlikely that the word ''cock'' was at that time a reference to the male anatomy; the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' places the first use of the word in a sexual sense in 1618.</ref> and in 1285 French prostitutes in [[Montpellier]] were confined to a single street.<ref name="HoltBakerpp204205"/>

It was normal practice for [[Middle Ages|medieval]] street names to reflect their function, or the economic activity taking place within them (especially the commodities available for sale), hence the frequency of names such as [[The Shambles]], Silver Street, Fish Street, and Swinegate (pork butchers) in cities with a medieval history. Prostitution may well have been a normal aspect of medieval [[Urban culture|urban]] life;<ref name="HoltBakerpp204205">{{Harvnb|Holt|Baker|2001|pp=204&ndash;205.}}</ref> in {{nowrap|''A survey of London'' (1598) }} [[John Stow]] describes Love Lane as "so called of Wantons".<ref>{{Harvnb|Stow|1842|p=111.}}</ref>  The more graphic Gropecunt Lane, however, is possibly the most obvious allusion to sexual activity.<ref name="HoltBakerpp201202"/>

==Changing sensibilities==

The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' defines the word ''cunt'' as "The female external genital organs" and notes "Its currency is restricted in the manner of other taboo-words: see the small-type note s.v. FUCK v."<ref name=OEDCunt />  During the [[Middle Ages]] the word may often have been considered merely vulgar, having been in common use in its anatomical sense since at least the 13th&nbsp;century.  In ''[[The Miller's Tale]]'', [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] writes "And prively he caughte hire by the queynte" (and intimately he caught her by her crotch),<ref>{{Citation | title = The Miller's Prologue and Tale <U+2013> 3276 | url = http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/teachslf/milt-par.htm#TALE | publisher = courses.fas.harvard.edu | accessdate = 2009-05-13}}</ref> and ''Philotus'' (1603) mentions "put doun thy hand and graip hir cunt."<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|1994|p=350.}}</ref>  Gradually though the word became used more as the obscenity it is generally considered to be today.  In ''Wandring Whore II'' (1660) the word is applied to a woman, specifically a [[whore]]&mdash;"this is none of your pittiful Sneakesbyes and Raskalls that will offer a sturdy C&mdash; but eighteen pence or two shillings, and repent of the business afterwards".<ref>This publication regularly abbreviates cunt to C.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|1994|p=353.}}</ref>  [[Francis Grose]]'s ''A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue'' (1785) lists the word as "C**t.  The ''chonnos'' of the Greek, and the ''cunnus'' of the Latin dictionaries; a nasty name for a nasty thing: ''un con Miege''."<ref>{{Citation |last=Grose |first=Francis |title=1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5402 |year=1788 |publisher=gutenberg.org |accessdate=2009-04-06 |postscript=.}}</ref> Grose's implied derivation from the Greek and Latin is probably incorrect; the word more likely derives from a common Mediterranean language now unknown, evidenced by the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] ''qefen-t'' and ''ka-t'', meaning vulva.<ref>{{Harvnb|Partridge|1977|p=700.}}</ref>

Although some medieval street names such as Addle Street (stinking urine, or other liquid filth; mire<ref>{{Citation |title=addle, n. and a. |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50002480? |series=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2 |year=1989 |accessdate=2009-04-06|postscript=.}}</ref>) and Fetter Lane (once Fewterer, meaning "idle and disorderly person") have survived, others have been changed in deference to contemporary attitudes. Sherborne Lane in London was in 1272<U+2013>73 known as Shitteborwelane, later Shite-burn lane and Shite-buruelane (possibly due to nearby cess pits).<ref name="byanyothername">{{Citation |title=A street by any other name... |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2004/apr/18/property.homebuying1 |last=Partridge |first=Chris |date=2004-04-18 |publisher=Guardian|Guardian News and Media |accessdate=2009-04-06|postscript=.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Harben|1918|p=10.}}</ref>  Pissing Alley, one of several identically named streets whose names survived the [[Great Fire of London]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wall|1998|pp=124&ndash;125.}}</ref> was called Little Friday Street in 1848, before being absorbed into [[Cannon Street]] in 1853<U+2013>54.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harben|1918|p=211.}}</ref>  Petticoat Lane, the meaning of which is sometimes misinterpreted as related to prostitution, was in 1830 renamed as Middlesex Street, following complaints about the street being named after an item of [[underwear]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Glinert|2003|p=289.}}</ref>  More recently, Rillington Place, where [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]] murdered his victims, was renamed Ruston Close.<ref>{{citation |title=Christie's ghost returns |date=18&nbsp;May 1970 |periodical=[[The Times]] |page=5 |issue=57872 |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/842/399/60784594w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS84243122&dyn=3!xrn_4_0_CS84243122&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |format=subscription required |accessdate=2009-04-18 |postscript=.}}</ref>  Selous Street in London was renamed as a mark of respect for [[Nelson Mandela]], as it may have been perceived to have been named in honour of the colonialist [[Frederick Selous]], although it was actually named after the artist [[Henry Courtney Selous]].<ref name="byanyothername"/>

With the exception of [[Shrewsbury]] and possibly [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], where a Grapecuntlane was mentioned in 1588, the use of Gropecunt as a street name seems to have fallen out of favour by the 14th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holt|Baker|2001|pp=206&ndash;212.}}</ref>  The ruling [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] conservative elite's growing hostility to prostitution during the 16th century resulted in the closure of the Southwark [[Brothel|stews]] in 1546, replacing earlier attempts at regulation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Archer|2003|pp=248&ndash;250.}}</ref>

==Locations==
London had several streets named Gropecunt Lane including one in the parishes of [[St_Pancras, London|St. Pancras]] and St. Mary Colchirche, between Bordhawelane ([[bordello]]) and Puppekirty Lane (poke skirt)<ref name="Holtbakerpp207208">{{Harvnb|Holt|Baker|2001|pp=207&ndash;208.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Harben|1918|p=49.}}</ref> near present-day [[Cheapside]].

[[Image:GropeLane.jpg|right|thumb|Grope Lane in [[Shrewsbury]]]]
The name was also used in other large medieval towns across England, including [[Bristol]], [[York]], [[Shrewsbury]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Worcester]], [[Hereford]], and [[Oxford]]. [[Norwich]]'s Gropekuntelane (now Opie Street) was recorded in Latin as ''turpis vicus'', the shameful street.<ref name="HoltBakerpp201202"/> In 1230 Oxford's [[Magpie Lane, Oxford|Magpie Lane]] was known as Gropecunt Lane, renamed Grope or Grape Lane in the 13th century, and then Magpie Lane in the mid-17th century. It was again renamed in 1850 as Grove Street, before once again assuming the name Magpie Lane in the 20th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crossley|Chance|Colvin|Cooper|Day|Hassall|Jessup|Selwyn|1979|pp=475&ndash;477.}}</ref> Newcastle and Worcester each had a Grope Lane close to their public [[quay]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holt|Baker|2001|p=212.}}</ref>  In their 2001 study of medieval prostitution, using the ''Historic Towns Atlas'' as a source, historian Richard Holt and [[archaeologist]] Nigel Baker of the University of Birmingham studied sexually suggestive street names around England. They concluded that there was a close association between a street with the name Gropecunt Lane, which was almost always in the centre of town, and that town's principal market-place or high street.<ref name="Holtbakerp206">{{Harvnb|Holt|Baker|2001|p=206.}}</ref>

Streets named Gropecunt Lane are also recorded in several smaller market towns such as [[Banbury]] and [[Wells]], where a street of that name existed in 1300, regularly mentioned in legal documents of the time.<ref name="HoltBakerpp201202"/><ref name="Harbenp164"/><ref>{{Citation |title=D\P\gla.j/17/1/2 - Grant to Church of St John the Baptist of plot of land in Gropecunt Lane |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ |publisher=[[Somerset County Council]] |accessdate=2009-04-06|postscript=.}}</ref>  Parsons&nbsp;Street in Banbury was first recorded as Gropecunt Lane in 1333, and may have been an important thoroughfare,<ref name="Holtbaker210">{{Harvnb|Holt|Baker|2001|p=210.}}</ref> but by 1410 its name had been changed to Parsons Lane.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crossley|Colvin|Cooper|Cooper|Harvey|Hollings|Hook|Jessup|Lobel|Mason|Trinder|Turner|1972|pp=18&ndash;28.}}</ref>  Grape Lane in [[Whitby]] may once have been Grope Lane, or Grapcunt Lane.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sheeran|1998|p=38.}}</ref>  A street called Grope&nbsp;Countelane existed in [[Shrewsbury]] as recently as 1561, connecting the town's two principal marketplaces.  At some date unrecorded the street was renamed Grope Lane, a name which it has since retained.  In Thomas Phillips' ''History and Antiquities of Shrewsbury'' (1799) the author is explicit in his understanding of the origin of the name as "... [a place of] scandalous lewdness and venery", but Archdeacon Hugh Owen's ''Some account of the ancient and present state of Shrewsbury'' (1808) describes it as "called Grope, or the Dark Lane".  As a result of these differing accounts, some local tour guides attribute the name to "feeling one's way along a dark and narrow thoroughfare".<ref name="Holtbaker210"/>
