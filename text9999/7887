<onlyinclude>The following is a '''list of [[Governor of Kentucky|Governors]] of the [[Commonwealth (United States)|Commonwealth]] of [[Kentucky]]'''. As head of the executive branch of the state's government,{{ref|con69|[a]}} the governor is given broad appointment power, and names many state commissioners and department heads without the need for legislative approval. The governor is also empowered to reorganize the state government or reduce it in size.{{ref label|kye|b|1}} He or she serves as [[Commander-in-Chief|commander-in-chief]] of the state's [[army]], [[navy]], and [[militia]] forces.{{ref|con75|[c]}} Historically, the office has been regarded as one of the most powerful executive positions in the [[United States]].{{ref label|kye|b|2}}</onlyinclude>

Fifty-six individuals have held the office of governor of Kentucky. Prior to a 1992 amendment to the [[Kentucky Constitution|state's constitution]], the governor of Kentucky was prohibited from succeeding himself in office, though four men ([[Isaac Shelby]], [[John L. Helm]], [[James B. McCreary]], and [[Happy Chandler|A. B. "Happy" Chandler]]) served multiple non-consecutive terms. [[Paul Patton]], the first governor eligible for a second consecutive term under the amendment, won his reelection bid in 1999. [[James Garrard]] succeeded himself in 1800, before the constitutional provision existed. 

[[William Goebel]], who was elected to the office in the disputed election of 1899, remains the only governor of any U.S. state to die from assassination while in office.{{ref|kye-ass|[d]}} [[Martha Layne Collins]], who held the office from 1983 to 1987, was the first woman to serve as governor of Kentucky and was only the third woman to serve as governor of any U.S. state who was not the wife or widow of a previous governor.{{ref label|kye|b|3}}

[[Ernie Fletcher]] is the current governor, having served since 2003. He lost his [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2007|re-election bid]] to [[Steve Beshear]], who will take office on [[December 11]] [[2007]].

Kentucky was part of [[Virginia]] until 1792; see [[List of Governors of Virginia]] for that period.

==Confederate governors==
[[Image:Gwjohnson ky.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[George W. Johnson (Civil War)|George W. Johnson]], 1st Confederate Governor of Kentucky]]
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a group of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers met at the [[Russellville, Kentucky]] to form a [[Confederate government of Kentucky|Confederate government]] for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. While this government never successfully displaced the government in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]], two men were elected governor of the Confederate government: [[George W. Johnson (Civil War)|George W. Johnson]], who served from [[November 20]] [[1861]] to his death on [[April 8]] [[1862]] at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], and, on Johnson's death, [[Richard Hawes]], who served until the Confederate surrender on [[April 9]] [[1865]]. The Confederate government disbanded shortly after the end of the war in 1865.{{ref|kye-conf|[f]}}
