'''Lake Como''' (''Lago di Como'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], also known as '''Lario'''; ''Lach de Comm'' in [[Western Lombard|Insubric]]; [[Latin]]: '''Larius Lacus''') is a [[lake]] of [[Glacier|glacial]] origin in [[Lombardy]], [[Italy]]. It has an area of 146&nbsp;km<U+00B2>, making it the third largest lake in Italy, after [[Lake Garda]] and [[Lake Maggiore]]. At over 400&nbsp;m (1320 ft) deep it is one of the deepest lakes in [[Europe]] and the bottom of the lake is more than {{convert|200|m|ft|0}} below sea-level.

==Geography==
[[Image:Lago di Como & Lago di Lecco Italy aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the juncture between the three arms of Lake Como]]
The lake is shaped much like the character <U+201C>Y<U+201D>. The northern branch begins at the town of [[Colico]], while the towns of [[Como]] and [[Lecco]] sit at the ends of the southwestern and southeastern branches respectively.  The small towns of [[Bellagio]], [[Menaggio]] and [[Varenna]] are situated at the intersection of the three branches of the lake:  a triangular boat service operates between them.

Lake Como is fed in large part by the [[Adda River]], which enters the lake near Colico and flows out at Lecco. This geological conformation makes the southwestern branch a dead end, and so Como, unlike Lecco, is often flooded.

The mountainous pre-alpine territory between the two southern arms of the lake<U+2014>between Como, Bellagio and Lecco<U+2014>is known as the [[Larian Triangle]], or ''Triangolo lariano''. The source of the river [[Lambro]] is here. At the centre of the triangle, the town of [[Canzo]] is the seat of the ''[[Comunit<U+00E0> montana]] del Triangolo Lariano'', an association of the 31 [[comune|municipalities]] which represent the 71,000 inhabitants of the area.

== Name ==
[[Image:LagoBrunate.jpg|thumb|left|A view of Lake Como from the [[lighthouse]] in [[Brunate]].]]
The lake's name in [[Latin]] is ''Larius'', Italianized as ''Lario'', but this name is rarely used; it is usually called ''Lago di Como'' (literally "Lake of Como"). In guidebooks the lake may be variously described as "Lake Como", "Lake of Como", or "Como Lake."  The lake's name comes from the town of [[Como]], known to the Romans as ''Comum''.   

While the town of Como is referred to as "Como", the lake itself is never referred to solely by this name. (This is not true of another lake in Italy, [[Lake Garda]], where "Garda" may refer to either a town on its shores, or the lake).

==Lakeside villas==
[[Image:Villa Carlotta - Lake Como.jpg|thumb|Villa Carlotta.]]
[[Image:Lake Como - Villa d'Este.jpg|thumb|Villa d'Este.]]
[[Image:Villa del Balbianello.jpg|thumb|Villa del Balbianello.]]
The lake is well-known for the attractive [[villa]]s which have been built here since [[Pliny the Younger]] constructed the ''Comedia'' and the ''Tragedia''. Many have admirable gardens which benefit from the mild climate induced by the stabilising presence of 22.5&nbsp;km<U+00B3> of lake water and are able to include tropical as well as temperate plants.

The [[Villa Carlotta]] was built for the [[Milan]]ese marchese Giorgio Clerici in 1690 and occupies a site of over 70,000 m<U+00B2> at [[Tremezzo]], facing the [[Bellagio]] peninsula. An [[Italian garden]], with steps, fountains and sculpture was laid out at the same time. The villa was later sold to the banker and Napoleonic politician [[Giambattista Sommariva]]. [[Stendhal]] was his guest in 1818, and his visit is recalled at the start of ''[[La Chartreuse de Parme]]''. In 1843 it was purchased by Princess Marianne of Nassau as a wedding present for her daughter Carlotta, after whom the villa is now named. The latter, together with her husband, Georg II of Saxen-Meiningen laid out the woodland landscape park in [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style. The villa today includes a museum of agricultural implements as well as important works of sculpture by Sommariva<U+2019>s friend [[Antonio Canova]] and by [[Luigi Acquisti]].
<ref>See Infoparchi, ''Villa Carlotta''; Villacarlotta.it, ''Villa Carlotta''; Macadam, Alta</ref>

The [[Villa d'Este (Cernobbio)|Villa d'Este]], at [[Cernobbio]], was built in 1568 by Cardinal [[Tolomeo Gallio]], a native of the town. In 1816<U+2013>17 the villa was home to [[Caroline of Brunswick]], estranged wife of the Prince of Wales and shortly to become [[Queen consort|Queen Consort]] of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. The landscaped gardens in the English style are a product of this period. Later in the century it was turned into a luxury hotel. Today the Villa d<U+2019>Este is known for attracting celebrity guests. 

The [[Villa del Balbianello]], famous for its elaborate terraced gardens, lies on a promontory of the western shore of the lake near [[Isola Comacina]]. Built in 1787 on the site of a Franciscan monastery, it was the final home of the explorer [[Guido Monzino]] and today houses a museum devoted to his work.

The [[Villa Melzi]], at Bellagio was built in the [[neo-classical style]] by the architect [[Giocondo Albertolli]] in 1808<U+2013>10 as the summer residence of Francesco Melzi who had been vice-president of the Napoleonic [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]]. The park includes an [[orangery]], a chapel, statues and a [[Japanese garden]], and is planted, as often on lake Como, with huge [[rhododendron]]s. Nineteenth-century guests at the Villa included Stendhal and [[Franz Liszt]] <ref>See Infoparchi, ''Villa Melzi''.</ref>

The [[Villa Serbelloni]], also at Bellagio, houses the [[Bellagio Study and Conference Center]], a residential center set up and managed by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] since 1959, which operates a 'scholar-in-residence' program for scholars from around the world. This is believed to have been the site of Pliny the Younger<U+2019>s villa <U+2018>Tragedia<U+2019>. Its well-known park was created at the end of the eighteenth century by Alessandro Serbellon.

==Climate==
Lake Como weather is generally mild. It is known for its Mediterranean-like climate where tropical and sub-tropical plants can grow year-round. In the winter, the lake helps to maintain a higher temperature in the surrounding region (since water releases heat energy more slowly than air). Average daily maxima range from about 13 <U+00B0>C (55 <U+00B0>F) in December to 30 <U+00B0>C (85 <U+00B0>F) in July. Water temperatures can reach an average of 24<U+00B0>C (75<U+00B0>F) during the month of July. Snowfall is erratic and primarily affects the higher elevations. Rainfall is heaviest in May and lowest during the winter months.

==Ferries==
The Lake Como ferry service is a highly developed public transport system linking the dozens of small towns and villages dotted around the perimeter of the Lake. There are three main services:
* <U+2018>Motorship<U+2019> services up and down the western branch and northern end of the Lake (between Colico or Piona and Como town), with additional shuttles to the mid-lake area.
* <U+2018>Fast services<U+2019> that follow broadly the same route but use quicker hydrofoils, stop less frequently and cost extra.
* <U+2018>Ferries<U+2019> that run only between the hugely popular mid-lake villages of Menaggio, Bellagio and Varenna, plus Cadenabbia. Some of these boats carry vehicles as well as passengers.

==Sacro Monte di Ossuccio==
[[Image:Sacro Monte di Ossuccio. Cappella 5. La Disputa di Ges<U+00F9> con i Dottori nel Tempio.JPG|thumb|right|Chapel 5. Disputation with the Doctors]]
The [[Sacro Monte di Ossuccio]] (<U+2018><U+2019>Sacred Mount of [[Ossuccio]]<U+2019><U+2019>) is located on a hillside slope between olive groves and woods along the western edge of Lake Como facing [[Isola Comacina]]. Fifteen [[Baroque]] inspired [[chapels]], built between 1635 and 1710, and dedicated to the [[Rosary| Mysteries of the Rosary]] are dotted along the way that leads to the Monastery. This building is the last in the chain and is dedicated to the [[Coronation of the Virgin]].
In 2003, the [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]], including that of Ossuccio, were inserted by [[UNESCO]] in the [[World Heritage List]].

==Recreation and tourism==
Lake Como is a popular tourist destination. It is a venue for [[sailing]], [[windsurfing]] and [[kitesurfing]].<ref>[http://www.italiaspeed.com/2006/cars/fiat/06/kiteboardpro/0606.html 2006 Kiteboard Pro World Tour event, Lake Como], ''Italiaspeed.com'', [[June 6]], [[2006]]</ref> In 1818  [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] wrote to [[Thomas Love Peacock]]: <U+201C>This lake exceeds anything I ever beheld in beauty, with the exception of the arbutus islands of Killarney. It is long and narrow, and has the appearance of a mighty river winding among the mountains and the forests<U+201D>.  <ref>{{citation

==Pollution==
In 2007 it was reported that Lake Como is too polluted to swim in, with colony-forming units of bacteria at 68 times the safe limit for bathing. This pollution presents a risk of skin infections, dermatitis and even salmonella to bathers. In 2008 was reported that the upper lake is suitable for swimming. <ref>[http://www.thespec.com/News/CanadaWorld/article/224588 Italy's posh resort lakes so beautiful, so polluted], ''TheSpec.com'', [[July 27]], [[2006]]</ref>
