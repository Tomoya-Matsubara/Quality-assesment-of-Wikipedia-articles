'''P-01 ''Velebit''''' was a modified [[Una-class submarine|''Una''-class]] [[midget submarine]], the first and so far the only submarine to see service with the [[Croatian Navy]]. It was built for the [[Yugoslav Navy]] during the 1980s where it was named '''P-914 ''Zeta'''''. During the outbreak of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] P-914 was being overhauled in the BSO where it was, although stripped down of all equipment, preserved by the shipyard workers from the retreating Yugoslav forces.

With modifications that were aimed at improving the ships endurance by including a [[diesel generator]], it was launched as P-01 ''Velebit'' on January 16, 1996. Five years later it was out of service because of the need to acquire a new set of batteries, which in turn, never happened. After unsuccessful attempts of selling it to a foreign buyer,<ref name=jutarnji1>{{cite web |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/morh-prodaje-jedinu-hrvatsku-podmornicu/231744/|title=MORH prodaje jedinu hrvatsku podmornicu|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Jutarnji list]] |publisher= |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> it was offered to various museums in Croatia with a final destination still pending.

== History ==
{{Main|Una-class submarine}}
In 1993 Brodarski Institut from [[Zagreb]] started a modification program to improve the operational capabilities of P-914 ''Zeta'' captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthend by 140 cm to create space needed for the installation of a single [[MTU]] 105 kW diesel generator.<ref name=brodarski>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrbi.hr/images/files/Brodovi/Diverzantska_podmornica_Velebit_P-novo.pdf|title=Diverzantska podmornica Velebit P-01|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=hrbi.hr |publisher= |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> A new steering system which improved underwater manoeuvrability was also installed.

Because the submarine was being reconstructed during a time in which an [[arms embargo]] was imposed on Croatia, it was completed and entered service without a [[sonar]]. In the [[1990s]] ''Velebit'' was featured on several photos with a [[pennant number]] "3" painted on its side aimed at causing confusion and disinformation among potentially hostile nations.
