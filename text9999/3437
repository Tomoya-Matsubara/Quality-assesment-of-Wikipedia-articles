"'''Our Father'''" is the [[Dexter (season 3)|third season]] [[season premiere|premiere]] and twenty-fifth overall episode of the American [[television drama series]] ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', which first aired on September 28, 2008 on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] in the United States.<ref name=ign1>{{cite web| title = Dexter: "Our Father" Review| publisher = [[IGN]]| url = http://au.tv.ign.com/articles/913/913545p1.html| author = Fowler, Matt| date = September 26, 2008| accessdate = 2009-02-18}}</ref> The episode was written by [[Clyde Phillips]] and directed by [[Keith Gordon]]. In the episode, which takes place several months after the second season finale, [[Dexter Morgan]] ([[Michael C. Hall]]) mistakenly kills an innocent man but forms a friendship with the man's brother, well-known assistant district attorney [[List of Dexter characters#Miguel Prado|Miguel Prado]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]). Dexter's sister [[List of Dexter characters#Ofr./Det. Deborah "Debra" Morgan|Debra]] ([[Jennifer Carpenter]]), meanwhile, has turned over a new leaf in her life and is determined to become a detective.

To carry the remainder of the third season, ''Dexter''{{'}}s writers introduced Miguel as a new character so that his relationship with Dexter could serve as a "central arc". In order to allow them to explore Dexter's psychological and emotional reactions, the writers revealed Dexter's girlfriend [[List of Dexter characters#Rita Bennett/Rita Morgan|Rita Bennett]] ([[Julie Benz]]) to be pregnant. They also had Dexter kill an innocent person to develop the ongoing theme of rebellion despite initially rejecting the idea of Dexter killing "somebody who doesn't deserve it". Filming of the episode began in early June in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] at [[Sunset Gower Studios]], though a small crew flew to [[Miami]], [[Florida]], where the show is set, to film short pieces of Dexter, which were integrated into "Our Father" and other episodes. The episode brought in 1.22 million viewers, an improvement from second season's [[It's Alive! (Dexter)|premiere]] and finale, and attracted mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Several months after the deaths of his colleague [[List of Dexter characters#James Doakes|Sgt. James Doakes]] and his [[Narcotics Anonymous]] sponsor [[List of Dexter characters#Lila West.2F.22Lila Tournay.22|Lila Tournay]], Dexter's life has returned to normal. He looks up a drug dealer, [[List of Dexter characters#Fred "Freebo" Bowman|Fred "Freebo" Bowman]] ([[Mike Erwin]]), whom he believes to have killed two female college students. Pretending to want to buy [[black tar heroin|heroin]], Dexter visits Freebo's house, where he sees Freebo's girlfriend [[List of Dexter characters#Teegan Campbell|Teegan Campbell]] (Jelly Howie). He returns to the house at night and finds Freebo fighting with another man (Nick Hermz). When the man attacks Dexter, Dexter stabs and kills him in self-defense. Dexter flees, shocked about breaking his father [[List of Dexter characters#Harry Morgan|Harry]]'s "code" and killing an innocent person. He is called to the scene the following day and discovers that the man was [[List of Dexter characters#Oscar Prado|Oscar Prado]], the brother of well-known assistant district attorney Miguel Prado. Miguel seeks an explanation and consolation from Dexter, and invites him to Oscar's wake. Dexter attends, leaving Debra alone on their dead father's birthday. He begins to question Harry's code and whether his loyalty is necessary.

In the police department, [[List of Dexter characters#Det./Sgt. Angelo "Angel" Batista|Det. Angel Batista]] ([[David Zayas]]) is promoted to a sergeant. Debra has changed her hairstyle and given up men, alcohol and cigarettes. [[List of Dexter characters#Joseph .22Joey.22 Quinn|Det. Joey Quinn]] ([[Desmond Harrington]]), recently transferred to the department, is being investigated by Internal Affairs. [[List of Dexter characters#Yuki Amado|Sgt. Yuki Amado]] ([[Liza Lapira]]) asks Debra repeatedly to keep an eye on Quinn, but Debra declines even when she discovers that "snitching" may earn her a detective's shield. She discovers from one of Quinn's [[narc (narcotics)|informants]], [[List of Dexter characters#Anton Briggs|Anton Briggs]] (David Ramsey), that Oscar was a drug addict, but after she loudly divulges the information in Miguel's presence, Lt. [[Mar<U+00ED>a LaGuerta]] ([[Lauren V<U+00E9>lez]]) asks that Batista remove her from the case. Batista does so and instead puts her on the case of a "[[John Doe|Jane Doe]]", who Dexter recognizes as Teegan.

Dexter's personal life is going well; his relationship with Rita has become more amorous and he is bonding with her children, [[List of Dexter characters#Cody and Astor Bennett|Astor]] ([[Christina Robinson (actress)|Christina Robinson]]) and [[List of Dexter characters#Cody and Astor Bennett|Cody]] ([[Preston Bailey]]). Rita craves chocolate pudding and, recalling the last instance of this, realizes that she is [[pregnant]].

"Our Father" received mixed reviews from critics; some thought that it was dull, though others commended Smits' performance.
