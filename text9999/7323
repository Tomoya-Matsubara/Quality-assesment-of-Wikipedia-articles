'''Niobium''' ({{pronEng|na<U+026A><U+02C8>o<U+028A>bi<U+0259>m}}) ([[Greek mythology]]: ''[[Niobe]]'', daughter of ''[[Tantalus]]''), or '''columbium''' ({{IPA|/k<U+0259><U+02C8>l<U+028C>mbi<U+0259>m/}}), is the [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Nb''' and the [[atomic number]] 41. A rare, soft, grey, [[ductile]] [[transition metal]], niobium is found in the minerals [[pyrochlore]], the main commercial source for niobium, and [[columbite]].

Niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element [[tantalum]], and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish. The English chemist [[Charles Hatchett]] reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801, and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist [[Heinrich Rose]] determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. The name of the element was officially adopted as niobium in 1949.

It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. [[Brazil]] is the leading producer of niobium and [[ferroniobium]], an [[alloy]] of niobium and iron. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special [[steel]] such as that used in gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]]. Although alloys contain only a maximum of 0.1%, that small percentage of Niobium improves the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing  [[superalloy]]s is important for its use in [[jet engine]]s and [[rocket engine]]s. Niobium is used in various [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] materials. These [[Type-II superconductor|superconducting alloy]]s, also containing [[titanium]] and tin, are widely used in the [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting magnets]] of [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scanners]]. Other applications of niobium include its use in welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, [[numismatics]] and jewellery. In the last two applications, niobium's low toxicity and ability to be coloured by [[Anodizing|anodisation]] are particular advantages.

Subsequently, there was  considerable  confusion<ref name="Wolla">{{cite journal  | title =  On the Identity of Columbium and Tantalum  | pages =  246<U+2013>252 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | first = William Hyde | last = Wollaston |  authorlink = William Hyde Wollaston  | doi =   10.1098/rstl.1809.0017| url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/107264 | volume = 99 | year = 1809}}</ref> over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related [[tantalum]]. In 1809, the English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] compared  the oxides derived from both columbium<U+2014>columbite, with a density 5.918&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and tantalum<U+2014>[[tantalite]],  with a density 7.935&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and concluded that the two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum.<ref name="Wolla" /> This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist [[Heinrich Rose]], who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of [[Tantalus]]: ''niobium'' (from [[Niobe]]), and ''pelopium'' (from [[Pelops]]).<ref name="Pelop">{{cite journal  | title =  Ueber die Zusammensetzung der Tantalite und ein im Tantalite von Baiern enthaltenes neues Metall | pages =  317<U+2013>341 | journal = Annalen der Physik | authorlink  = Heinrich Rose  | language=German | first = Heinrich  | last = Rose  | doi =  10.1002/andp.18441391006 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15148n/f327.table | volume = 139  | issue = 10  | year =  1844}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | title =  Ueber die S<U+00E4>ure im Columbit von Nordam<U+00E9>rika  | language=German | pages =  572<U+2013>577 | first = Heinrich | last = Rose | journal = Annalen der Physik | doi =  10.1002/andp.18471460410 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15155x/f586.table |year=1847| volume = 146  | issue = 4  | authorlink = Heinrich Rose}}</ref>  This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium.  Both  tantalum and niobium  react with [[chlorine]] and traces of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, with niobium forming two compounds: the white volatile [[niobium pentachloride]] (NbCl<sub>5</sub>) and the non-volatile [[niobium oxychloride]] (NbOCl<sub>3</sub>).  The claimed new elements ''pelopium'', ''ilmenium'' and ''dianium''<ref name="Dianium">{{citejournal|title = Ueber eine eigenth<U+00FC>mliche S<U+00E4>ure, Dians<U+00E4>ure, in der Gruppe der Tantal- und Niob- verbindungen | first = V. | last = Kobell | journal =Journal f<U+00FC>r Praktische Chemie | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 291<U+2013>303 |doi=10.1002/prac.18600790145|year = 1860}}</ref> were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.<ref name="Ilmen" />

The differences between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by  [[Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand]],<ref name="Ilmen" /> and [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]], as well as [[Louis J.

Although de Marignac was able to produce tantalum-free niobium on a larger scale by 1866, it was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially,  in [[incandescent lamp]] filaments.<ref name="Gupta" /> This use quickly became obsolete through the replacement of niobium with [[tungsten]], which has a higher melting point and thus is preferable for use in incandescent lamps.

==Production==
[[Image:World Niobium Production 2006.svg|300px|thumb|Niobium producers in 2007]]

After the separation from the other minerals, the mixed oxides of tantalum [[tantalum pentoxide|Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]] and niobium [[Niobium pentoxide|Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]] are obtained. The first step in the processing is the reaction of the oxides with [[hydrofluoric acid]]:<ref name="ICE" />

:Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 14HF <U+2192> 2H<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>TaF<sub>7</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O, and
:Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 10HF <U+2192> 2H<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O

The first industrial scale separation, developed by [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac|de Marignac]], used the difference in solubility between the complex niobium and tantalum [[fluoride]]s, dipotassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate (K<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki><U+00B7>H<sub>2</sub>O) and dipotassium heptafluorotantalate (K<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>TaF<sub>7</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki>) in water. Newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from [[aqueous]] solution by [[organic solvents]] like [[cyclohexanone]].<ref name="ICE" /> The complex niobium and tantalum fluorides are extracted separately from the [[organic solvent]] with water and either precipitated by the addition of [[potassium fluoride]] to produce a  potassium fluoride complex, or precipitated with [[ammonia]] as the pentoxide:<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

:H<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki> + 2KF <U+2192> K<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki><U+2193> + 2HF, then
:2H<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki> + 10NH<sub>4</sub>OH <U+2192> Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub><U+2193> + 10NH<sub>4</sub>F + 7H<sub>2</sub>O 

Several methods are used for the [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] to metallic niobium. The [[electrolysis]] of a molten mixture of K<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki> and [[sodium chloride]] is one; the other is the reduction of the fluoride with [[sodium]]. With this method niobium with a relatively high purity can be obtained. In large scale production the reduction of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with hydrogen or carbon<ref name="HollemanAF"/> is used. In the process involving the [[aluminothermic reaction]] a mixture of [[iron oxide]] and niobium oxide is reacted with [[aluminium]]:

:3Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 12Al <U+2192> 6Nb + 2Fe + 6Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 

To enhance the reaction, small amounts of oxidizers like [[sodium nitrate]] are added. The result is [[aluminium oxide]] and [[ferroniobium]], an alloy of iron and niobium used in the steel production.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Progress in Niobium Markets and Technology 1981<U+2013>2001 | author = Tither, Geoffrey | url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/images/pdfs/oppening.pdf | journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA) | date = 2001 | isbn = 9780971206809 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002 | editor=Minerals,  Metals and Materials Society,  Metals and Materials Society Minerals | year = 2001 | format = pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = The Production of Ferroniobium at the Niobec mine 1981<U+2013>2001 | first = Claude | last = Dufresne | coauthor =  Goyette,  Ghislain| url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_1/images/pdfs/start.pdf | accessdate =  |  journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA) | date = 2001 | isbn = 9780971206809 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002 | editor=Minerals,  Metals and Materials Society,  Metals and Materials Society Minerals | year = 2001 | format = pdf }}</ref> The ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% of niobium.<ref name ="tesla"/> Without addition of iron oxide, aluminothermic process is used for the production of niobium.

The arc-tube seals of high pressure [[sodium vapor lamp]]s are made from niobium, or niobium with 1% of [[zirconium]], because niobium has a very similar coefficient of thermal expansion to the [[sintered]] [[alumina]] [[arc tube]] ceramic, a translucent material which resists chemical attack or [[redox|reduction]] by the hot liquid sodium and sodium vapour contained inside the operating lamp.<ref>{{cite book | title = Lamps and Lighting | first = Stanley Thomas | last = Henderson | coauthors = Marsden,  Alfred Michael; Hewitt,  Harry  | publisher = Edward Arnold Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-7131-3267-1 | pages = 244&ndash;245}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Refractory metals: crucial components for light sources | last = Eichelbr<U+00F6>nner | first = G. | year =1998 | journal = International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 5<U+2013>11 | doi = 10.1016/S0263-4368(98)00009-2  | format = PDF | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Niobium and Niobium 1% Zirconium for High Pressure Sodium (HPS)  Discharge Lamps | first = Christopher A. | last = Michaluk | coauthors =  Huber, Louis E.; Ford, Robert B.|  journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA) | date = 2001 | isbn = 9780971206809 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002 | editor=Minerals,  Metals and Materials Society,  Metals and Materials Society Minerals | year = 2001 | format =  }}</ref> The metal is also used in [[arc welding]] rods for some stabilized grades of stainless steel.<ref>{{US patent reference | number = 5254836  | y = 1993 | m = 10 | d = 19 | inventor = Okada, Yuuji; Kobayashi, Toshihiko; Sasabe, Hiroshi; Aoki, Yoshimitsu; Nishizawa, Makoto; Endo, Shunji  | title = Method of arc welding with a ferrite stainless steel welding rod}}</ref><!--<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jxmetals.com/sdp/316680/4/cp-1271725.html | publisher=Shanghai Jiangxi Metals Co.

== Precautions ==
Niobium has no known biological role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant and a potential fire hazard, elemental niobium on a larger scale is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.<ref>{{cite journal  | title = New trends in the use of metals in jewellery  | first = J.  | last = Vilaplana | coauthors =  Romaguera, C.; Grimalt, F.; Cornellana,  F.  | journal = Contact Dermatitis  | volume = 25 | issue = 3	 | pages = 145<U+2013>148  | year = 1990 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1991.tb01819.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = New developments in jewellery and dental materials | first = J. | last = Vilaplana | coauthors = Romaguera, C.| journal = Contact Dermatitis  | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 55<U+2013>57 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1998.tb05832.x }}</ref> 

Niobium-containing compounds are  rarely encountered by most people, but some are toxic and should be treated with care. The short and long term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) between 10 and 100&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name="Haley">{{cite journal  | title = Pharmacology and toxicology of niobium chloride | first =  Thomas J.  | last = Haley | coauthor = Komesu, N.;  Raymond, K. | journal =  Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology | volume = 4  | issue = 3 | pages =  385<U+2013>392  | year = 1962 | doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(62)90048-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | title = The Toxicity of Niobium Salts   | first = William L.  | last = Downs | coauthors = Scott, James K.;  Yuile, Charles L.;  Caruso, Frank S.; Wong,   Lawrence C.
