Since the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], the human rights issue of China has come to the forefront. Multiple sources, including the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department's]] annual [[People's Republic of China]] human rights reports, as well as studies from other groups such as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], have documented the PRC's abuses of [[human rights]] in violation of internationally recognized norms.

The PRC government argues that the notion of human rights should include economic standards of living and measures of health and economic prosperity,<ref name="xinhuanet humanrights">{{cite news

Controversial human rights issues in China include policies such as [[capital punishment]], the [[one-child policy]], the policy of [[Han Chinese]] cultural integration towards [[Tibet]], and lack of protections regarding freedom of press and religion.

A number of organizations work to create awareness and campaign for change with regard to human rights in China. These include [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Human Rights in China]], [[Chinese Human Rights Defenders]] (CHRD) and [[China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group]] (CHRWCG).

[http://english.people.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html]</ref> the Chinese government often uses the ''subversion of state power'' clause to imprison those who are critical of the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSPEK10194620080403|title=China jails rights activist outspoken on Tibet}}</ref> Also, there is very heavy government involvement in the media, {{CFact|with most of the largest media organizations being run directly by the government.}} Chinese law forbids the advocacy of [[independence]] or [[self-determination]] for territories Beijing considers under its jurisdiction, as well as public challenge to the CCP's monopoly in ruling China. Thus references to democracy, the Free Tibet movement, [[Taiwan]] as an independent state, certain religious organizations and anything remotely questioning the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China are banned from use in publications and [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|blocked on the Internet]].

===Freedom of movement===
{{detail|Hukou system}}

The [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] came to power in the late 1940s and instigated a [[command economy]]. In 1958, Mao set up a residency permit system defining where people could work, and classified an individual as a "rural" or "urban" worker.<ref name="autogenerated2">Macleod, Calum.

Abolition of this policy was proposed in 11 provinces, mainly along the developed eastern coast. The law has already been changed such that migrant workers no longer face summary arrest, after a widely publicised incident in 2003, when a university-educated migrant died in Guangdong province. The Beijing law lecturer who exposed the incident said it spelt the end of the [[hukou system]]: in most smaller cities, the system has been abandoned; it has "almost lost its function" in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.<ref name=rethinks/>

David Whitehouse divides what he describes as "Chinese apartheid" into three distinct phases: The first phase occurred during the [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] phase of China's economy, from around 1953 to the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976. The second "[[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]]" phase lasted from 1978 to 2001, and the third lasted from 2001 to the present. During the first phase, the exploitation of rural labor, the passbook system, and in particular the non-portable rights associated with one's status, created what Whitehouse calls "an apartheid system". As with South Africa, the ruling party made some concessions to rural workers to make life in rural areas "survivable... if not easy or pleasant". During the second phase, as China transitioned from state capitalism to market capitalism, export-processing zones were created in city suburbs, where mostly female migrants worked under oppressive [[sweatshop]] conditions. The third phase was characterized by the weakening of the ''hukou'' controls; by 2004 the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture counted over 100 million people registered as "rural" working in cities.<ref name=Whitehouse> Whitehouse, David. {{PDFlink|[http://www.ukzn.ac.za/ccs/files/Whitehouse%20China.pdf "Chinese workers and peasants in three phases of accumulation"]|73.5&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 75324 bytes -->}}, Paper delivered at the Colloquium on Economy, Society and Nature, sponsored by the Centre for Civil Society at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2 March 2006.

Au Loong-yu, Nan Shan, and Zhang Ping of the Committee for Asian Women argue this system oppresses women more severely than men,<ref>"We further identify seven elements of the repressive regime at the national, municipal and local levels, and argue that the combined results of these elements have given rise to a kind of spatial and social apartheid which systematically discriminates against the rural population, with women being the most oppressed."

# The repressive regime at the factory level;
# the paramilitary forces at local level;
# the <U+2018>local protectionism<U+2019> of local governments;
# the fiercely pro-business and pro-government attitude of the local press;
# the fiercely pro-business and pro-government attitude of the branches of [[All-China Federation of Trade Unions|ACFTU]];
# pro-government local courts; and
# the discriminatory ''hukou'' system.<ref name=Loong>Au Loong-yu, Nan Shan, Zhang Ping. {{PDFlink|[http://www.cawinfo.org/pdf/final_10.pdf Women Migrant Workers under the Chinese Social Apartheid]|2.01&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 2112402 bytes -->}}, Committee for Asian Women, May 2007, p. 20.</ref>
They agree that the gradual relaxation of some of the more repressive aspects of the ''hukou'' system since the mid-1990s has largely eliminated the spatial aspect of the apartheid; for example, workers can now buy one year permits to reside in cities, and since 2003 the police no longer jail and deport people who lack local ''hukou'' passes. However, they point out the still-hereditary nature of the ''hukou'' system, and state that the "substance of the social apartheid in general and the ''hukou'' system in particular remains intact." Migrant workers are permanently marked as outsiders and remain second-class citizens, and are denied access to good jobs or upward mobility, thus forcing their eventual return to their place of origin.<ref>"Since the middle of 1990<U+2019>s the ''hukou'' system has been gradually relaxed. First, rural residents were permitted to buy a temporary (usually one year) urban residential card, which allowed them to work legally. The fees for such permits gradually decreased to a fairly affordable level. Beginning from 1998, parents have been able to pass down their hukou either through the father<U+2019>s or the mother<U+2019>s line, hence the triple discrimination against rural women has been alleviated. In 2003, after the uproar surrounding the death of Sun Zhigang alarmed the authorities, the laws on jailing and repatriating <U+2018>undocumented<U+2019> people (those failing to produce local ''hukou'') were abolished. Thus the spatial aspect of the apartheid has now largely been eliminated. However, the substance of the social apartheid in general and the ''hukou'' system in particular remains intact. The permanent mark of being an outsider and second class citizen remains, and prevents migrant workers from achieving significant upward mobility in cities. Most decent jobs are still reserved for people who possess local ''hukou''. Migrants can only get badly paid jobs. They still have no future in the cities, and may only work there for some years and then return to their home village." Au Loong-yu, Nan Shan, Zhang Ping. {{PDFlink|[http://www.cawinfo.org/pdf/final_10.pdf Women Migrant Workers under the Chinese Social Apartheid]|2.01&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 2112402 bytes -->}}, Committee for Asian Women, May 2007, p. 11.</ref>

Whitehouse sees the analogy to South Africa's apartheid system breaking down in two areas: First, under a system called ''xia xiang'', or "sending down", individuals or even entire factories of urban workers were sometimes re-classified as rural workers and sent to live in the countryside (at lower wages and benefits). By contrast, white workers in South Africa were never sent to work in [[Bantustans]]. Second, the ideology driving China's apartheid system was [[Maoism]], not [[racism]], as is South African apartheid.<ref name=Whitehouse/> Anita Chan agrees with Whitehouse on this point, noting that while the ''hukou'' system shares many of the characteristics of the South African apartheid system, including its underlying economic logic, the racial element is not present.<ref name=Chan/>

The [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Public Security]] justified these practices on the grounds that they assisted the police in tracking down criminals and maintaining public order, and provided demographic data for government planning and programs.<ref name=Laquian>"The ''hukou'' system has been criticized in some quarters and has been called 'the equivalent of and apartheid system between rural and urban residents' (''China Labor Bulletin'', 25 February 2002). However, the Ministry of Public Security has continued to justify the ''hukou'' system as an instrument for keeping public order (the ministry said it allowed the police to track down criminals more easily) and for providing demographic data for planning and program formulation."

According to Peter Alexander and Anita Chan, China's export-oriented growth has been based on the labor of poorly paid and treated migrant workers, using a [[Pass Law|pass system]] similar to the one used in South Africa's apartheid, in which massive abuses of human rights have been observed.<ref name=Peter&Chan>Alexander, Peter, & Chan, Anita [http://general.rau.ac.za/sociology/Alexander_Chan.PDF ''Does China Have an Apartheid Pass System?''], Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 30.4 (2004)<br /> China's household registration system (HRS) maintains a rigid distinction between China's rural population, that is people who have a rural hukou (household registration), and urban residents, who have an urban hukou. Movement of rural people into the cities is restricted, and they require a permit to stay and work temporarily in any urban area. If caught without these permits, people with a rural hukou could be placed in a detention centre, fined, and deported back to their home village or home town (that is, 'endorsed out', to borrow a South African expression). Those with a rural hukou who obtain a temporary employment permit to work in an urban area are not entitled to the pensions, schooling, unemployment benefits, etc. enjoyed by those who have an urban hukou. There are, in short, some obvious and significant similarities between the two countries, but a closer examination is required before we can consider equating China's pass system with what operated in apartheid South Africa." [[...]]" The combination of these four factors may explain why China has developed a quasi-apartheid pass system. The fact that it has such a system underlines the reality that China's export-oriented economic growth has been built, in large measure, on the labour of poorly paid and appallingly treated migrant workers. In China today, as in apartheid South Africa, the pass system is associated with massive abuses of human rights, and its retention should be opposed."</ref>

An article in [[The Washington Times]], reported in 2000 that although migrant laborers play an important part in spreading wealth in Chinese villages, they are treated "like second-class citizens by a system so discriminatory that it has been likened to apartheid."<ref name="autogenerated3" />

The Chinese embassy in South Africa posted a letter to the editor of [[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]] dated 22 February 2007 , under the title ''Article on China presents racism rumours as fact'', in which a reader stated that "It's pure incitement to proclaim 'Chinese apartheid' in reference to migrant labour being kept out of the cities."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinese-embassy.org.za/eng/zt/thirdeye/t299146.htm|publisher=Embassy of The People's Republic of China in the Republic of South Africa"|title= Article on China presents racism rumours as fact}}</ref>

===Religious freedom===
{{main|Freedom of religion in the People's Republic of China}}
During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976), particularly the [[Four Olds|Destruction of Four Olds]] campaign, religious affairs of all types were persecuted and discouraged by the Communists with many religious buildings looted and destroyed. Since then, there have been efforts to repair, reconstruct and protect historical and cultural religious sites.<ref> Trevor H.B. Sofield and Li, Fung Mei Sarah:[http://www.istp.murdoch.edu.au/ISTP/casestudies/Case_Studies_Asia/tourchin/tourchin.htmlChina: Tourism Development and Cultural Policies] Annals of Tourism Research, 25 (2), 1998, pp. 362-392 </ref> The US department of state criticizes in its human rights report 2005 that not enough has been done to repair or restore damaged and destroyed sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/hr_report2005tib.html|title=Beijing usembassy-china}}</ref>

The 1982 Constitution technically guarantees its citizens the right to believe in any religion.<ref>"''Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief. No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion. The state protects normal religious activities. No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination.''"[http://english.people.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html Constitution of the PRC]", People's daily China</ref> However this freedom differs from the general concept of "[[freedom of religion]]" as recognised in the West, and is subject to restrictions.

The government tries to maintain tight control over all religions, so the only legal Christian groups ([[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] and [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]]) are those under the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] control. {{CFact|It has been claimed by many that the teachings in the state-approved Churches are at least monitored and sometimes modified by the Party.}}

==== Tibetan Buddhism ====
The government now has the power to ensure that no new living Buddha can be identified: the State Administration for Religious Affairs issued a 14-part regulation to limit the influence of the Dalai Lama. It declared that after 1 September 2007, "[no] living Buddha [may be reincarnated] without government approval, since Qing dynasty, when the live Budda system was established.".<ref name=permissiontoreincarnate>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article2194682.ece|title=China tells living Buddhas to obtain permission before they reincarnate}}</ref> When the Dalai Lama announced in May 1995 that a search inside Tibet had identified the 11th reincarnation of the [[Panchen Lama]] who died in 1989, Beijing was enraged and reinitiated the search under the supervision of a senior Politburo member.

[[Image:PrePersecutionFalunDafaPracticeinChina.jpg|thumb|right|Groups practicing Falun Gong in China before the ban in July 1999]]
{{main|History of Falun Gong|Organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China}}

On 20 July 1999, the government banned [[Falun Gong]], and began a nationwide crackdown of the practice<ref>http://china.hrw.org/search/node/Falun+Gong</ref> following seven years of widespread popularity and rapid growth of the practice.<ref name="Ownbyworld">David Ownby, "The Falun Gong in the New World," European Journal of East Asian Studies, Sep2003, Vol. 2 Issue 2, p 306</ref><ref name=ching>p. 2</ref> A series of appeals and petitions made by practitioners to the authorities in 1999, in particular the 10,000 person gathering at Zhongnanhai on 25 April, eventually led to the decision to outlaw and persecute Falun Gong.<ref name=XIX>American Asian Review, Vol. XIX, no. 4, Winter 2001, p. 12</ref> 

According to Pulitzer prize-winning journalist [[Ian Johnson]], the Communist Party mobilized every aspect of society to become involved in the persecution, including the media apparatus, police force, army, education system, families and workplaces.<ref name=wildgrass>Johnson, Ian, ''Wild Grass: three portraits of change in modern china'', Vintage (8 March 2005)</ref> An extra-constitutional body, the "6-10 Office" was created to do what Forbes describes as "<nowiki>[overseeing]</nowiki> the terror campaign."<ref name=morais>Morais, Richard C.[http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/02/09/falun-gong-china_cz_rm_0209falungong.html "China's Fight With Falun Gong"], ''Forbes'', 9 February 2006, retrieved 7 July 2006</ref> The campaign was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspaper, radio and internet.<ref name=Leung> Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 <U+2013> 784</ref> Human Rights Watch noted that families and workplaces were urged to cooperate with the government, while practitioners themselves were subject to various coercive measures to have them recant their beliefs.<ref name=dangerous>Mickey Spiegel, [http://hrw.org/reports/2002/china/ "Dangerous Meditation: China's Campaign Against Falungong"], Human Rights Watch, 2002, accessed Sept 28, 2007</ref> Amnesty International raised particular concerns over reports of torture, illegal imprisonment including forced labour, psychiatric abuses.<ref> (23 March 2000) [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA170112000 The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called ''heretical organizations''], Amnesty International</ref><ref>United Nations (4 February 2004) [http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/hrcn1073.doc.htm Press Release HR/CN/1073], retrieved 12 September 2006</ref>

Protests in Beijing were frequent for the first few years following the 1999 edict, though these protests have largely been eradicated.<ref name=wildgrass/> Practitioners have occasionally hacked into state television channels to broadcast pro-Falun Gong materials. Outside of mainland China, practitioners are active in appealing to the governments, media, and people of their respective countries about the situation in China.

Falun Gong and ''[[The Epoch Times]]'' have also alleged that the Chinese government and its agencies, including the [[People's Liberation Army]], were conducting "widespread and systematic organ harvesting of living practitioners" specifically at the Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital in [[Shenyang]]. In March 2006, two apparent eye-witness alleged that practitioners detained in the hospital's basement were being tissue-typed, their information stored on computer databases, and then matched with organ recipients and killed to order when an organ was required.<ref name=epoch2>Ji Da, [http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-3-17/39405.html New Witness Confirms Existence of Chinese Concentration Camp, Says Organs Removed from Live Victims], Epoch Times,  March 17, 2006</ref> In July 2006, [[David Kilgour]] and [[David Matas]] published a report entitled "Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China" which they say supported the allegations that large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners were victims of systematic organ harvesting whilst still alive, throughout China.<ref>Reuters, AP (July 8, 2006)[http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/falun-gong-organ-claim-supported/2006/07/07/1152240489760.html "Falun Gong organ claim supported"],''The Age'', retrieved July 7, 2006</ref> <!--''Sky News'' seemed to corroborate the findings.<ref>Sky News, [http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/video/Suspicions-Raised-Over-Donors/Video/200604314158598?lid=VIDEO_14158598_Suspicions%20Raised%20Over%20Donors&amp;lpos=searchresults Suspicions Raised Over Organ Donors], accessed 1/12/07</ref>, while the Sky News report says leading hospitals source donors from executed prisoners, nothing about Falun Gong practitioners --> The Christian Science Monitor says the report<U+2019>s evidence is "circumstantial, but persuasive".<ref>The Monitor's View (3 August 2006)[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0803/p08s02-comv.html "Organ harvesting and China's openness"], ''The [[Christian Science Monitor]]'', retrieved 6 August 2006</ref>

The Chinese government categorically denied any mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners, and rejected the report in its entirety. "No one will believe the absurd lies concocted by the Falun Gong cult followers", said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-03/29/content_4361491.htm No one will believe Falun Gong followers' lies: FM], Xinhua 29 March 2006</ref> Dissident [[Harry Wu]], commenting on Sujiatun but not the Kilgour-Matas report, said the two witnesses were "not reliable and most probably they had fabricated the story", and he rejected the totality of the allegations after sending in investigators.<ref>Harry Wu (18 July 2006) [http://www.cicus.org/info_Eng/artshow.asp?ID=6491 My viewpoint of the alleged "Sujiatun Camp" and how it is formed], China Information Center</ref>  A [[Congressional Research Service]] said that there was "insufficient evidence to support this specific allegation," without elaboration.<ref name=lum>Congressional Research Service report, http://www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL33437.pdf, page  CRS-7, paragraph 3</ref>

The Committee stated that it is concerned with the information that Falun Gong practitioners "have been extensively subjected to torture and ill-treatment in prisons and that some of them have been used for organ transplants." They called for the state to immediately conduct or commission an independent investigation of the claims of organ harvesting, and take measures to ensure that those responsible for such abuses are prosecuted and punished.<ref name=UNCAT>United Nations Committee Against Torture, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/docs/CAT.C.CHN.CO.4.pdf CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 19 OF THE CONVENTION: Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture], Forty-first session, Geneva, 3-21 November 2008</ref>

===Political freedom===
The PRC is known for its intolerance of organized dissent towards the government. Dissident groups are routinely arrested and imprisoned, often for long periods of time and without trial. Incidents of torture, forced confessions and forced labour are widely reported. Freedom of assembly and association is extremely limited. The most recent mass movement for political freedom was crushed in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square Massacre]] in 1989, the estimated death toll of which ranges from about 200 to 10,000 depending on sources.<ref>[http://www.89-64.org/html/victims155.htm List of casualties], [[Ding Zilin]], Retrieved 2007-05-21 {{zh icon}}</ref><ref name="TE">Timperlake, Edward. 1999 (1999).

===One-child policy===
[[Image:One child policy.jpg|thumb|right|Government sign stating: "For a prosperous, powerful nation and a happy family, please use birth planning."]] 
China's [[birth control]] policy, known widely as the [[one-child policy]], was implemented in 1979 by the Chinese government to alleviate the overpopulation problem. Having more than one child is illegal and punishable by fines and jail time.  Voice of America cites critics who argue that it contributes to [[forced abortions]], human rights violations, female infanticide, abandonment and [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|sex-selective abortions]], believed to be relatively commonplace in some areas of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-09/2005-09-26-voa6.cfm?CFID=17626358&CFTOKEN=49646296|title=Researchers Urge China to Relax Its One-Child Family Planning Policy|publisher=Voanews|date=26 September 2005}}</ref> This is thought to have been a significant contribution to the gender imbalance in mainland China, where there is a 118 to 100 ratio of male to female children reported.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gender imbalance in China could take 15 years to correct|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jan/24/china.international|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=China grapples with legacy of its <U+2018>missing girls<U+2019>|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5953508 |accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=China vows to halt growing gender imbalance|url= http://english.people.com.cn/200701/23/eng20070123_343739.html|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref> Forced abortions and sterilizations have also been reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9806/11/china.abortion/|publisher=Cnn.com|title=China abortion}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5094395.html|title= Chinese victims of forced late-term abortion fight back|accessdate=2007-08-30 |date= 30 August 2007 |publisher= Associated Press|author=Alexa Olesen}}</ref>

It is also argued that the one-child policy is not effective enough to justify its costs, and that the dramatic decrease in Chinese fertility started before the program began in 1979 for unrelated factors. The policy seems to have had little impact on rural areas (home to about 80% of the population), where birth rates never dropped below 2.5 children per female.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010516010636/http://www.overpopulation.com/faq/Population_Control/one_child.html|title=China's One Child Policy|author= Brian Carnell|date= 17 May 2000}}</ref><!-- who is Brian Carnell?

In 2002, the laws related to the One-child policy were amended to allow ethnic minorities and Chinese living in rural areas to have more than one child. The policy was generally not enforced in those areas of the country even before this. The policy has been relaxed in urban areas to allow people who were single children to have two children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/onechild.htm|title=Geography.about.com population}}</ref>

According to the [[United Nations Secretary-General]], between 1994 and 1999 China was ranked seventh in executions ''per capita'', behind [[Singapore]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Belarus]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Jordan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA360012004|title=SINGAPORE The death penalty: A hidden toll of executions}}</ref> Amnesty International claims that official figures are much smaller than the real number, stating that in China the statistics are considered State secrets. Amnesty stated that according to various reports, in 2005 3,400 people were executed. In March of that year, a senior member of the [[National People's Congress]] announced that China executes around 10,000 people per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/chn-summary-eng|title=Amnesty International's report on China}}</ref><br> 

A total of 68 crimes are punishable by death; capital offenses include non-violent, [[white-collar crime]]s such as [[embezzlement]] and [[tax fraud]]. The inconsistent and sometimes corrupt nature of the legal system in mainland China bring into question the fair application of capital punishment there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/deathpenalty-stats2005-eng|title=The Death Penalty in 2005}}</ref>

Amnesty International reports state that, in recent years, China has had the highest number of executions of any country.

However, Amnesty International analysts argue that this drop is only temporary since the figure includes only confirmed executions.<ref>{{cite web|title="Death Penalty: World trend down but secrecy surrounds China execution figures- new report"|url=http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17724}}</ref>

===Ethnic minorities===
:''See also: [[Racism in the People's Republic of China]]''
There are 55 [[Nationalities of China|recognized ethnic minorities]] in China. Article 4 of the Chinese constitution states "All nationalities in the People's Republic of China are equal", and the government argues that it has made efforts to improve ethnic education and increased ethnic representation in local government.

Some policies cause [[reverse racism]], where Han Chinese or even ethnic minorities from other regions are treated as second-class citizens in the ethnic region.<ref>{{cite web

However, the government is harsh toward those that argue for independence or political autonomy, mainly [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] and [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] in rural provinces in the west of China. Some groups have used [[terrorism]] to push their agenda.<ref>{{cite journal

Five Chinese Uyghur detainees from the [[United States]] [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], which was itself known for human rights abuses, were released in June, 2007, but the U.S. refused to return them to China citing the [[People's Republic of China]]'s "past treatment of the Uigur minority".<ref>{{cite news

===Tibet===
In 1951, the People's Liberation Army entered the region of Tibet. After the failed [[1959 Tibetan uprising|uprising of 1959]], the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] fled to India. In 1991 the Dalai Lama alleged that Chinese settlers in Tibet were creating "Chinese Apartheid":

<blockquote> The new Chinese settlers have created an alternate society: a Chinese apartheid which, denying Tibetans equal social and economic status in our own land, threatens to finally overwhelm and absorb us.<ref name=Dalai>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1347735.stm "Profile: The Dalai Lama"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 25 April 2006.</ref><ref>United States Congressional Serial Set, United States Government Printing Office, 1993, p. 110.</ref></blockquote>

In a selection of speeches by the Dalai Lama published in India in 1998, he referred again to a "Chinese apartheid", which he argued denied Tibetans equal social and economic status, and furthered the viewpoint that human rights were violated by discrimination against Tibetans under a policy which the Chinese called "segregation and assimilation".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Political Philosophy of His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama. Selected Speeches and Writings
|publisher=Tibetan Parliamentary and Policy Research Centre}}< /br>"Tibet is being colonized by waves of Chinese immigrants. We are becoming a minority in our own country. The new Chinese settlers have created an alternate society: a Chinese apartheid which, denying Tibetans equal social and economic status in our own land, threatens to finally overwhelm and absorb us. The immediate result has been a round of unrest and reprisal." (pp.65) [[...]]"Human rights violations in Tibet are among the most serious in the world. Discrimination is practiced in Tibet under a policy of apartheid which the Chinese call "segregation and assimilation." (pp. 248)</ref><ref>"Most Tibet Views Based On Perception, Not Fact" http://www.emorywheel.com/detail.php?n=25294</ref> 
According to the [[Heritage Foundation]]:

<blockquote>If the matter of Tibet's sovereignty is murky, the question about the PRC's treatment of Tibetans is all too clear. After invading Tibet in 1950, the Chinese communists killed over one million Tibetans, destroyed over 6,000 monasteries, and turned Tibet's northeastern province, Amdo, into a gulag housing, by one estimate, up to ten million people. A quarter of a million Chinese troops remain stationed in Tibet. In addition, some 7.5 million Chinese have responded to Beijing's incentives to relocate to Tibet; they now outnumber the 6 million Tibetans. Through what has been termed Chinese apartheid, ethnic Tibetans now have a lower life expectancy, literacy rate, and per capita income than Chinese inhabitants of Tibet.<ref>Lasater, Martin L. & Conboy, Kenneth J. [http://www.heritage.org/Research/AsiaandthePacific/EM177.cfm "Why the World Is Watching Beijing's Treatment of Tibet"], [[Heritage Foundation]], 9 October 1987.</ref></blockquote>

In 2001 representatives of Tibet exile groups succeeded in gaining accreditation at a United Nations-sponsored meeting of [[non-governmental organization]]s. On 29 August Jampal Chosang, the head of the Tibetan coalition, stated that China had introduced "a new form of apartheid" in Tibet because "Tibetan culture, religion, and national identity are considered a threat" to China.<ref>Goble, Paul. [http://www.tew.org/archived/accreditation.html "China: Analysis From Washington -- A Breakthrough For Tibet"], ''World Tibet Network News'', [http://www.tibet.ca/en/ Canada Tibet Committee], 31 August 2001.</ref> The Tibet Society of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] has called on the British government to "condemn the apartheid regime in Tibet that treats Tibetans as a minority in their own land and which discriminates against them in the use of their language, in education, in the practice of their religion, and in employment opportunities."<ref>[http://www.tibet-vigil.org.uk/wayforward.html "What do we expect the United Kingdom to do?"], Tibet Vigil UK, June 2002. Accessed 25 June 2006.</ref>

==Other human rights issues==
Worker's rights and privacy are other contentious human rights issues in China. There have been several reports of core [[International Labor Organization]] conventions being denied to workers. One such report was released by the [[International Labor Rights Fund]] in October 2006 documenting minimum wage violations, long work hours, and inappropriate actions towards workers by management.<ref>[http://laborrights.org/files/China%20Report%20Press%20Release101206.pdf Wal-Mart in China: Rolling Back Labor Rights] by [http://www.laborrights.org International Labor Rights Fund], October 2006</ref> Workers cannot form their own unions in the workplace, only being able to join State-sanctioned ones. The extent to which these organizations can fight for the rights of Chinese workers is disputed.<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/china12270.htm|title=Overview of human rights issues in china}}</ref>

Although the Chinese government does not interfere with Chinese people's privacy as much as it used to,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5389362|title=The long march to privacy}}</ref> it still deems it necessary to keep tabs on what people say in public. Internet forums are strictly monitored, as is international postal mail (this is sometimes inexplicably "delayed" or simply "disappears") and e-mail.<ref name="autogenerated4" />

The issue of refugees from [[North Korea]] is a recurring one. It is official policy to repatriate them to North Korea, but the policy is not evenly enforced and a considerable number of them stay in the People's Republic (some move on to other countries). Though it is in contravention of international law to deport political refugees, as illegal immigrants their situation is precarious. Their rights are not always protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/northkorea/norkor1102-01.htm|title=HRW: North Koreans in People's Republic of China}}</ref> Some of them are tricked into marriage or prostitution.<ref>[http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/PDF/Full%20Korea%20report%202005.pdf An Absence of Choice: The sexual exploitation of North Korean women in China] by Norma Kang Muico, Anti-Slavery International 2005.</ref>

African students in China have complained about their treatment in China, that was largely ignored until 1988-9, when "students rose up in protest against what they called 'Chinese apartheid'".<ref name=Robinson>Robinson, Thomas W. & Shambaugh, David L. ''Chinese Foreign Policy: Theory and Practice'', Oxford University Press, p. 315.</ref> African officials took notice of the issue, and the [[Organization of African Unity]] issued an official protest. The organization's chairman, [[Mali]]'s president [[Moussa Traor<U+00E9>]], went on a fact-finding mission to China.<ref name=Robinson/> According to a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' 1989 Third World Report titled ''"Chinese apartheid" threatens links with Africa'', these practices could threaten Peking's entire relationship with the continent."<ref name=Snow>Snow, Phillip. "Third World Report: 'Chinese apartheid' threatens links with Africa", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 January 1989.</ref>

In 2005 [[Manfred Nowak]] visited [[People's Republic of China|China]] as the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on [[Torture]]. After spending two weeks there, he observed that it was "on the decline, but still widespread." He also complained of Chinese officials interfering with his research, including intimidating people he sought to interview.<ref>{{cite news |title=China torture 'still widespread'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4491026.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=25 July 2005 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref>

==Counterarguments==
China's counterarguments come primarily from the idea of "Asian values"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eko-haus.de/menzius/universal.htm#_ftnref3|title=Confucian claim to universal principles}}</ref> and the need to create a "harmonious society",<ref>{{cite news 
|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200506/27/eng20050627_192495.html 
|title=Building harmonious society crucial for China's progress: Hu 
|publisher=People's Daily 
|date=27 June 2005
}}</ref> where the welfare of the collective should always be put ahead of the rights of any individual whenever conflicts between these arise. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that this is achieved and in some cases, even persuade or force individuals to make sacrifices for society. A strong and stable authority would be required in order to regulate the potentially conflicting interests of the public and enforce a compromise. Governments with curtailed authority would fail to take on such a responsibility.

China (along with a few Asian countries) often point towards the rapid social deterioration, the increasing geographic, religious and racial segregation, the alarmingly rising crime rates, family breakdown, number of industrial actions, vandalism and political extremism in Western societies, which they believe to be a direct result of an excess of individual freedom <U+2013> <U+201C>Too much freedom is dangerous.<U+201D><ref>{{cite journal 
|url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/asian-values.html 
|title="Asian Values" and Democracy in Asia 
|author=Inoguchi, T. and Newman, E.
|journal=First Shizuoka Asia-Pacific Forum: The Future of the Asia-Pacific Region 
|year=1997}}</ref> These issues they argue are all violations of human rights and should be taken into account when assessing a country's human right records. Furthermore, the government criticizes the United States, which publishes human rights reports annually, by insisting that the United States has also caused human rights abuses such as the invasion of Iraq.<ref>{{cite news

|publisher=The Age 
|date=13 March 2008
}}</ref>

The PRC government also argues that the notion of human rights should include economic standards of living and measures of health and economic prosperity.<ref name="xinhuanet humanrights"/> On cultural grounds they argue that as the economic, cultural and political situations differ substantially between countries, a universal 'one-size-fits-all' definition of human rights should not apply internationally.

===Reform===
In March 2003, an amendment was made to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], stating "The State respects and preserves human rights."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A57447-2004Mar14 China Amends Constitution to Guarantee Human Rights] By Edward Cody</ref> In addition, China was dropped from a list of top 10 human rights violators in the annual human rights report released by the U.S. State Department in 2008, while the report indicated that there were still widespread problems in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/washington/12rights.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=U.S.+drops+china&st=nyt&oref=slogin8|title=U.S. Drops China From List of top 10 Violators of Rights|publisher=NY Times}}</ref>

Since 1988, the Chinese government began direct village elections to help maintain social and political order whilst facing rapid economic change. Elections now occur in "about 650,000 villages across China, reaching 75% of the nation's 1.3 billion people," according to the Carter Center.<ref>{{cite web
