'''Texas A&M University''', often called '''A&M''' or '''TAMU''', is a [[coeducation]]al [[public university|public]] [[research]] [[university]] located in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], [[Texas]]. It is the [[flagship#University campuses|flagship]] institution of the [[Texas A&M University System]]. It opened in 1876 as the [[History of Texas A&M University|Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas]], the first public institution of higher education in that state. In 1963, the [[Texas Legislature]] renamed the school to Texas A&M University to reflect the institution's expanded roles and academic offerings. The letters "A&M" no longer have any explicit meaning but are retained as a link to the university's past. The nickname "Aggie" refers to students, [[Alumni#Related terms|alumni]]<!--Clarification: "alumni" is also defined to include "former students"-->, and sports teams of Texas A&M.

Texas A&M's designation as a [[land-grant university|land]], [[Sea Grant Colleges|sea]], and [[Space grant colleges|space-grant]] institution reflects a broad range of research with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as [[NASA]], the [[National Institutes of Health]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[Office of Naval Research]]. Working with agencies such as the [[Texas AgriLife Research]] and [[Texas AgriLife Extension Service]], Texas A&M has a direct presence in each of the 254 counties in Texas. The university offers degrees in over 150 courses of study through ten colleges and houses 18 research institutes. Texas A&M has awarded over 320,000 degrees, including 70,000 graduate and professional degrees.<!--The degree count is 320,000. Former student count is 280,000. Some students have multiple degrees (e.g. multiple undergrad degrees, Master's degree, etc.-->

As a [[senior military college]], Texas A&M is one of three public universities with a full-time, volunteer [[Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]]. It provides more commissioned officers to the [[United States Armed Forces]] than any other school outside of the [[United States Service academies|service academies]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Texas A&M University}}
[[Image:Texas A&M 1883 campus.jpg|thumb|left|Texas A&M in 1883]] 
===Beginning years===
The [[Texas Legislature]] established Texas A&M in 1871 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, then known as Texas A.M.C. The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] funded the new [[land-grant university|land-grant college]], the state's first public institution of higher education, through the [[Morrill Act]] in 1862. The act auctioned land grants of public lands to establish endowments for colleges where the "leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts... to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life".<ref name="handbook"/>

A state committee established Texas A&M in [[Brazos County]], which donated {{convert|2416|acre|sqkm|0|sp=us|lk=on}} near [[Bryan, Texas]].<ref name="handbook">{{cite web|title=Texas A&M University|publisher=[[The Handbook of Texas]]|url=http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct8.html|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> Classes began on [[October 4]], [[1876]] with 40 students and 6 faculty members.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas|publisher=Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets|url=http://www.aggiecorps.org/About/history.htm|accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref> With mandatory [[#Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]] participation and military training, enrollment climbed to 258 students before declining to 108 students in 1883, the year the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] opened in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams Jr.|first=John A.|title=Keepers of the Spirit|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|pages=16, table 1-1|date=2001|isbn=1-58544-127-9 }}</ref> Though originally envisioned as a component of the [[University of Texas System]], Texas A.M.C. had a separate Board of Directors from the [[University of Texas]].<ref name="handbook"/> 

[[Image:Sul Ross Statue.JPG|right|thumb|Statue of [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross|Lawrence Sullivan "Sully" Ross]] located in front of the Academic Building]]<!--This image is being used to illustrate the three-dimensional work of art in question (the subject and history of the subject of this statue is being described in this paragraph), and therefore is fair use-->In the late 1880s, many Texas residents saw no need for two colleges in Texas and clamored for an end of Texas A.M.C. In 1891, Texas A&M was saved from potential closure by its new president [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross]], former [[governor of Texas]] and well-respected [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Brigadier General]]. Ross made many improvements to the school and enrollment doubled to 467 cadets as parents sent their sons to Texas A&M "to learn to be like Ross". Upon his death in 1898, a statue was erected in front of what is now Academic Plaza to honor Ross and his achievements in the history of the school.<ref name="ferrell">{{cite web|last=Ferrell|first=Christopher|title=Ross Elevated College from "Reform School"|publisher=The Bryan-College Station Eagle|date=2001|url=http://www.theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1rossbio.htm|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

===World Wars era===
Many Texas A&M graduates served during [[World War I|World&nbsp;War&nbsp;I]]. By 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, more than any other school.<ref name="handbook"/> In early September 1918, the entire senior class enlisted, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year. Many of the seniors were fighting in [[France]] when the war ended two months later.<ref name="liffick">{{citation|last=Liffick|first=Brandie|title=Tradition spanning generations|newspaper=The Battalion|date=[[October 30]], [[2001]]|url=http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2001/10/03/Ams125th/Tradition.Spanning.Generations-515912.shtml|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>
Over 1,200&nbsp;former students served as commissioned officers. After the war, Texas A&M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science.<ref name="handbook"/> 

Many Aggies again served in the military during [[World War II]], with the college producing 20,229 combat troops. Of those, 14,123 Aggies served as officers, more than the combined total of the [[United States Naval Academy]] and the [[United States Military Academy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams Jr.|first=John A.|title=Keepers of the Spirit|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|date=2001|pages=160, 163|isbn=1-58544-127-9 }}</ref> Twenty-nine of its graduates reached the rank of general.<ref name="handbook"/>

Shortly after the war, in 1948, the state Legislature officially recognized Texas A&M as a separate university system from the University of Texas System. The school's Board of Directors continued to oversee the system.<ref name="system">{{cite web|title=A&M System History|publisher=Texas A&M University System|url=http://tamusystem.tamu.edu/overview/history.html|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

James Earl Rudder on main campus]]<!--This image is being used to illustrate the three-dimensional work of art in question (the subject and history of the subject of this statue is being described in this paragraph), and therefore is fair use-->

===University era===
On [[March 26]], [[1960]], [[Major General]] [[James Earl Rudder]], class of 1932, became the 16th president of the college.<ref name="dethloff184">{{cite book|last=Dethloff|first=Henry C.|title=A Pictorial History of Texas A&M University, 1876-1976|place=[[College Station, Texas]]|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=1975|pages=184 }}</ref> During his tenure, the school desegregated, began to admit women, and Corps of Cadets membership became voluntary. By his death in 1970, Rudder had overseen the growth of the school from 7,500 to 14,000 students from all 50 states and 75 nations.<ref name="rudder">{{citation|last=Ferrell|first=Christopher|coauthors=|title=Rudder's influence is evident on campus|work=|pages=|language=|newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle|date=2001|url=http://www.theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1rudderbio.htm|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

The 58th [[Legislature of Texas]] approved of Rudder's changes, and officially renamed the school from "The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas" to "Texas A&M University",<ref name="rudder"/> and specified that, the "A" and the "M" were purely symbolic, reflecting the school's past, and no longer stood for "Agricultural and Mechanical".<ref name="handbook"/> In the following 35&nbsp;years, Texas A&M more than tripled its enrollment from 14,000&nbsp;<!--Measurement of population-->students to over 45,000.<ref name="TAMUfacts"/>

Texas A&M became one of the first four universities given the designation [[sea-grant university|sea-grant]] for its achievements in [[oceanography]] and marine resources development in 1971. In 1989, the university earned the title [[space-grant college|space-grant]] by [[NASA]], to recognize its commitment to space research and participation in the Texas Space Grant Consortium.<ref name="britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Texas A&M University|encyclopedia=Britannica Concise|volume=1|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9002120/Texas-A&M-University|accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref>

[[Image:BushLibrary.JPG|thumb|left|George Bush Presidential Library]]
In 1997, the school was further honored with the establishment of the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] on the western edge of the campus. Operated by the [[National Archives and Records Administration]], it is one of twelve American [[Presidential library|presidential libraries]]. Former President [[George H.W. Bush|George Bush]] remains actively involved with the university, frequently visiting the campus and participating in special events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu|title=Bush Library|publisher=George Bush Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref><ref name="bushlibopens">{{Citation|title=George Bush Presidential Library and Museum Opens|newspaper=The Record|publisher=[[NARA]]|date=January 1998|url=http://www.archives.gov/publications/record/1998/01/bush.html}}</ref>

Texas A&M received national media attention on [[November 18]], [[1999]], when [[Aggie Bonfire]], a ninety-year-old student tradition, collapsed during construction. Fifty-eight current and former students were working on the stack, which stood {{convert|40|ft|m|-1}} high and consisted of 5000&nbsp;logs, when it fell; twelve of them died and twenty-seven others were injured. The accident was later attributed to improper design and poor construction practices, leading to "excessive internal stresses" on the logs and "inadequate containment strength", where the wiring used to tie the logs together was not strong enough. The wiring snapped after logs from upper tiers were "wedged" into lower tiers.<ref name="homeland">{{cite web  | last = Cook  | first = John Lee, Jr.   | title = Bonfire Collapse   | publisher = [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]  | date =  | url =http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/tr-133-508.pdf  | accessdate = 2007-03-03 }}</ref>  The victims' family members filed six lawsuits against Texas A&M officials, the student Bonfire leaders, and the university.

===Endowment===
The [[Texas A&M University System]] (TAMUS) receives revenue from two primary endowments which complement revenues received from both research and tuition. TAMUS holds a minority stake in the [[Permanent University Fund]] (PUF), a Texas public endowment fund contributing to eighteen institutions and six agencies in the [[University of Texas System|University of Texas]] and Texas A&M University systems. As of 2006, the PUF ending net asset value stood at $10.3&nbsp;billion, with $400.7&nbsp;million, in FY 2007 transferred to the Available University Fund for distribution to both university systems.<ref name="puf">{{cite web|url=http://www.utimco.org/funds/allfunds/2006annual/puf_return.asp|title=Permanent University Fund|accessdate=2007-05-15|publisher=The University of Texas Investment Management Company}}</ref>  The Texas A&M System receives a third of the accumulated interest from the PUF, while the University of Texas System receives the other two-thirds, due to a 1931 [[Texas Legislature]] decision.<ref name="handbookoftexas">{{cite web|url=http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/PP/khp2.htmlp|title=Permanent University Fund|accessdate=2007-05-16|publisher=The University of Texas}}</ref> Texas A&M also benefits from a private endowment, the Texas A&M Foundation, which totals over $1.17&nbsp;billion in assets.

==Traditions==
{{main|Traditions of Texas A&M University}}
Aggies have developed many traditions, some as old as the school. Changes such as admission of females, non-compulsory participation in the Corps, and growth in the university's population have led to the evolution of many traditions. Though most public events are university-sponsored and sanctioned, others are strictly student-run, non-sanctioned events.<ref name="traditionscouncil">{{cite web|title=Aggie Traditions|publisher=Texas A&M University Traditions Council|url=http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref>

===Student traditions===
[[Image:AggieRing.jpg|thumb|right|Aggie Ring for the class of 2004]]
====Aggie Ring====
The Aggie Ring promotes school spirit and camaraderie. Class rings have the same design except that of the class year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aggienetwork.com/ring/crown.aspx|title=The base or <U+201C>Crown<U+201D> of the Ring|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=The Association of Former Students}}</ref> Students cannot order a ring until completing 95 [[credit hours]] of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A&M, or until graduation. Graduate students may receive a ring after 75% of their graduate coursework is completed or after the acceptance of their dissertation or thesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aggienetwork.com/ring/csreqs.aspx|title=Aggie Ring Requirements|accessdate=2007-05-24|publisher=The Association of Former Students}}</ref> Though unsanctioned by the University, many students "dunk" their newly-acquired Aggie Rings into a pitcher of beer and [[binge drinking|quickly chug the entire pitcher]] to "earn" the ring. Some students dunk their rings in alternative substances, including ice cream or nonalcoholic beverages.

====Howdy====
Texas A&M's official greeting is the word "howdy". Aggies consider it polite to greet as many people as comfortably possible with a smile and a "howdy". "Howdy" is the preferred method for a speaker to get a large group's attention, as the members of the group are expected to return the "howdy" back to the speaker.<ref name="Howdy">{{cite web|url=http://traditions.tamu.edu/howdy.html|title=Howdy|accessdate=2006-12-31|publisher=Aggie Traditions}}</ref>

====Texas Aggie Bonfire====
{{main|Aggie Bonfire}}
Beginning in 1909, Aggie students built a bonfire each year on the grounds of the school. Though it began as a trash pile, Aggie Bonfire evolved into a massive six-tiered structure, the world record being held at {{convert|109|ft|m|-1}}. It burned before the annual football game versus the [[University of Texas]]. After the collapse of 1999, the university suspended Bonfire indefinitely, but some Aggies continue the tradition off-campus.<ref name="Bonfire">{{cite web|url=http://traditions.tamu.edu/bonfire.html|title=Bonfire|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=Aggie Traditions}}</ref><ref name="StBonfire">{{cite web|url=http://studentbonfire.com|title=Aggie Student Bonfire|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=Aggie Student Bonfire}}</ref>

[[Image:AggieMuster.jpg|right|thumb|2007 Aggie Muster at [[Reed Arena]].  The [[Texas A&M Corps of Cadets|Ross Volunteers]] stand at attention as candles are lit for the deceased.]]
Muster officially began on April 21, 1922, as a day for remembrance of fellow Aggies.  The March 1923 Texas Aggie urged, "If there is an A&M man in one-hundred miles of you, you are expected to get together, eat a little, and live over the days you spent at the A&M College of Texas."<ref name=<U+201D>Emerald">{{cite web|url=http://clubs.aggienetwork.com/emeraldcoastamc/muster.htm|title=Aggie Muster|accessdate=2006-12-17|publisher=Emerald Coast A&M Club}}</ref>  Modern muster ceremonies occur at around 320 locations globally including [[Kabul, Afghanistan]], and [[Baghdad, Iraq]]. <ref name="FindMuster"/>  The largest ceremony occurs on the A&M campus in [[Reed Arena]].

====Silver Taps====
[[Silver Taps]] began in 1898 to honor [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross]], then the president of the school. It evolved into a monthly tradition to honor current Aggie students who pass away that month. Flags fly half-staff the day of Silver Taps and notices are posted throughout campus. At 10:15 P.M. the lights around campus are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower while students and faculty collect in the Academic Plaza. Following a [[21-gun salute]] by the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad, six [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]]rs play an A&M version of the song ''[[Taps]]'', Silver Taps, three times from the dome of the school's Academic Building: once to the north, the south and to the west. The song is not played to the east symboling that the sun will never rise on that Aggie again.<ref name="SilverTaps">{{cite web|url=http://stulife.tamu.edu/co/silvertaps.htm|title=Silver Taps|accessdate=2007-01-01|date=2007|publisher=Department of Student Life}}</ref>

====The 12th Man====
{{see also|12th Man (football)}}

In [[Dallas]] on [[January 2]], [[1922]], at the [[Dixie Classic]] (the forerunner of the Cotton Bowl) A&M played defending national champion [[Centre College]] in the first post-season game in the southwest. A&M had so many injuries in the first half of the game that [[Dana X. Bible|Coach D. X. Bible]] feared he wouldn<U+2019>t have enough men to finish the game. He called into the [[Texas Aggie|Aggie]] section of the stands for E. King Gill, a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Gill volunteered and donned the uniform of injured player Heine Weir. Although he did not actually play, his readiness symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. A&M won 22-14, but E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. The 12th Man has evolved into an Aggie tradition. The student body, known as the "12th Man", stands throughout the entire game, "ready to help the team".<ref name="12thMan">{{cite web|url=http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/12thman.shtml|title=Twelfth Man|accessdate=2006-12-31|publisher=Aggie Traditions}}</ref>

Another part of the 12th man tradition is when the head coach before each game chooses a [[walk-on]] player to represent the student body. This player wears the No. 12 jersey, participates in kick-off returns, and is called "The 12th Man".<ref name="heater">{{citation|last=Heater|first=Jay|title=LaMantia A&M's Main 12th Man|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=[[December 27]], [[2006]]|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20061227/ai_n17077154|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref>

====Yells====
{{see also|Yell Leaders|Midnight Yell Practice}}
The 12th Man uses a variety of school yells, rather than cheers, to support Aggie teams. Each year the student body elects five students to serve as the Yell Leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yell.tamu.edu/|title=Texas Aggie Yell Leaders|date=2005|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=Texas A&M University}}</ref> At [[midnight]] before each home [[American football|football]] game at [[Kyle Field]] or at a predesignated location at away games, the fans gather together to practice the yells for the next day's game. Led by the Yell Leaders, and the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, the Twelfth Man files into the stadium to practice yells, sing the [[wikisource:Aggie War Hymn|War Hymn]], and joke about their opponents. One tradition at the games is when the Aggies score, Aggies kiss their dates. Close to the end of midnight yell, the lights turn off and Aggies practice this tradition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/midnight.shtml|title=Midnight Yell Practice|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=Aggie Traditions Council}}</ref>
