The '''''Moltke'' class''' was a class of two [[Dreadnought|"all-big-gun"]] [[battlecruiser]]s<ref group=A>The German navy classified the ships as ''Gro<U+00DF>en Kreuzer'' (large cruisers). These ships differed from older ''Gro<U+00DF>en Kreuzer'', such as the [[Roon class armored cruiser|''Roon'' class]], in that they carried a uniform main battery, instead of four large guns and a mixed array of smaller weapons. Ships of this type were referred to as being "all-big-gun", to distinguish them from the older ships.</ref> of the German [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]] built between 1909<U+2013>1911. Named {{SMS|Moltke|1910|6}} and {{SMS|Goeben||6}},<ref group=A>"SMS" stands for "Seiner Majest<U+00E4>t Schiff", or "His Majesty's Ship" in  German.</ref> they were similar to the previous {{SMS|Von der Tann|3=2}} unique battlecruiser, but the newer design featured several incremental improvements. The ''Moltke''{{'}}s were slightly larger, faster, and better armored, and had an additional pair of 28&nbsp;centimeter guns.

Both ships served during [[World War I]]. ''Moltke'' participated in several major battles with the rest of the [[High Seas Fleet]], including the battles of [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]] in the [[North Sea]], and the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] and [[Operation Albion]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. At the end of the war, ''Moltke'' was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at [[Scapa Flow]] while the ships' fate was being discussed during peace treaty negotiations. The ships [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|were scuttled]] on {{nowrap|21 June 1919}} to prevent their seizure by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].<!--Was it the Allies or Britain specifically? Were they actually going to be seized?-->

''Goeben'' was stationed in the Mediterranean at the start of the war; she [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|escaped from pursuing Royal Navy ships]] to Istanbul. The ship, along with the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau||2}}, was transferred to the [[Ottoman Navy]] soon after arrival. Strategically, ''Goeben'' played a very important role: she helped bring the [[Ottoman Empire]] into the war as a member of the [[Central Powers]], and by acting as a [[fleet in being]] the ship prevented Anglo-French attempts to force the [[Bosporus]], and similarly stymied a possible advance by the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]]. ''Goeben'' was retained by the new Turkish government after the war. Only slightly modified from her original configuration, the ship remained on active service until 1960. The ship was unsuccessfully offered for sale to the [[West Germany|West German]] government in 1963. Without a group willing to preserve the ship as a museum, the ship was sold for scrapping in 1971 and broken up between 1973 and 1976.

==Development==
During a May 1907 conference, the Germany Navy Office decided to follow up the [[SMS Von der Tann|''Von der Tann'']] unique<ref group=A>The ''Von der Tann'' was unique in that she was the only ship built of her design. All other German battlecruisers came from different [[Ship class|classes]].</ref> battlecruiser with an enlarged design.<ref name="Staff 11">Staff, p. 11</ref> The 44 million [[German gold mark|marks]] allocated for the 1908 fiscal year created the possibility of increasing the size of the main guns from the 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) weapons of the preceding design to 30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in). However, Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], along with the Construction Department, argued that increasing the number of guns from 8 to 10 would be preferable, as the 28&nbsp;cm guns had been deemed sufficient to engage even battleships. Tirpitz also argued that, given the numerical superiority of the Royal Navy's reconnaissance forces, it would be more prudent to increase the number of main guns, rather than increase their caliber.<ref name="Staff 11" /> The General Navy Department held that for the new design to fight in the [[Line of battle|battle line]], 30.5&nbsp;cm guns were necessary. Ultimately, Tirpitz and the Construction Department won the debate, and ''Moltke'' was to be equipped with ten 28&nbsp;cm guns. It was also mandated by the Construction Department that the new ships have armor protection equal or superior to ''Von der Tann''{{'}}s and a top speed of at least {{convert|24.5|kn|km/h}}.<ref name="Staff 11" />

During the design process, there were many weight increases due to growth in the size of the citadel, armor thickness, additions to the ammunition stores, and the rearrangement of the boiler system. It was originally planned to only build one ship of the new design, but due to the strains being put on the Navy design staff, it was decided to build two ships of the new type.<ref name="Staff 11" /> They were assigned under the contract names of "Cruiser G" and "Cruiser H". As [[Blohm + Voss|Blohm & Voss]] made the lowest bid for "Cruiser G", the company also secured the contract for "Cruiser H". The former was assigned to the 1908<U+2013>09 building year, while the latter was assigned to 1909<U+2013>10.<ref name="Gardiner 152">Gardiner and Gray, p. 152</ref>

The contract for "Cruiser G" was awarded on 17 September 1908, under building number 200. The [[keel]] was laid on 7 December 1908, and the ship was launched on 7 April 1910. "Cruiser G" was commissioned on 30 September 1911 as SMS ''Moltke''.<ref name="Staff 12" /> The ship's [[namesake]] was Field Marshall [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], the Chief of Staff of the [[Prussia]]n Army in the mid 19th century.<ref name="Staff14" /> "Cruiser H" was ordered on 8 April 1909 with the building number 201. The ship's keel was laid on 12 August 1909; the hull was launched on 28 March 1911. After [[fitting-out]], "Cruiser H" was commissioned on 2 July 1912 as SMS ''Goeben''.<ref name="Staff 12" /> The ship was named for [[August Karl von Goeben]], a Prussian general who served during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].<ref name="Staff17">Staff, p. 17</ref>

==Design==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-D0004, Gro<U+00DF>er Kreuzer "Goeben".jpg|thumb|''Goeben'']]
===General characteristics===
The ''Moltke'' class ships were 186.6 meters (612 feet) long, 29.4 m (96 ft) wide, and had a draught of 9.19 m (30.2 ft) fully loaded. The ship [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] 22,616&nbsp;tons normally, and 25,300&nbsp;tons fully loaded.<ref name="Staff14" /> The ''Moltke'' class ships had 15 [[watertight compartment]]s and a [[double bottom]] that ran for 78% of the keel of the ships. They were considered to handle well, with gentle movement even in heavy seas. However, they were slow to answer the helm and were not particularly maneuverable. The ships lost up to 60% speed and [[Sailing#Heeling|heeled]] 9&nbsp;degrees at full [[rudder]].<ref group=A>These figures are typical to the German battlecruisers of the period. The preceding battlecruiser {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}} suffered 60% speed loss and heeled up to 8&nbsp;degrees, and the subsequent {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} was similar. The later {{sclass|Derfflinger|battlecruiser|0}} lost up to 65% speed and heeled 11&nbsp;degrees. See: Gr<U+00F6>ner, pages 54, 56, and 57, respectively.</ref> The ships had a standard crew of 43 officers and 1010 men. While ''Moltke'' served as the I Scouting Squadron flagship, she was manned by an additional 13 officers and 62 men. While serving as the second command flagship, the ship carried an additional 3 officers and 25 men to the standard complement.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 54<U+2013>55</ref>

===Propulsion===
''Moltke'' and ''Goeben'' were powered by four-shaft [[Parsons turbine]]s in two sets and 24 coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft boilers, divided into four boiler rooms.<ref name="Staff 12">Staff, p12</ref> The boilers were composed of one steam drum and three water drums apiece,<ref name="Staff14" /> and produced steam at {{convert|16|atm|psi|lk=on}}. After 1916, the boilers were supplemented with tar-oil.<ref group=A>Tar oil was sprayed on the often low-quality coal available to the German navy; this increased the burning qualities of the fuel.</ref> The Parsons turbines were divided into high- and low-pressure pairs.<ref name="Staff14" /> The low-pressure turbines were the inner pair, and were placed in the aft engine room. The high-pressure turbines were on either side of the low-pressure pair, and were located in the forward wing rooms. The turbines powered four propellers, 3.74 m (12.3 ft) in diameter.<ref name="Groner54">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 54</ref>

The ships' powerplants delivered a rated {{convert|52000|shp|MW|abbr=on|lk=on}} and a top speed of 25.5 knots (47.2 km/h). However, in trials ''Moltke'' attained {{convert|85782|shp|MW|abbr=on}} and a top speed of 28.4 kts; ''Goeben''{{'}}s powerplant produced only a slightly lower horsepower and top speed.<ref name="Gardiner 152">Gardiner, Gray, and Budzbon, p. 152</ref> At 14 knots (26 km/h), the ships had a range of 4,120 nautical miles (7,630 km).<ref name="Staff14" /> The ''Moltke'' class ships were equipped with 6 turbo [[Electrical generator|generators]] that delivered 1,200 kW (1,600 hp) of power at 225&nbsp;volts.<ref name="Staff14" /> The ships were designed to carry 1,000&nbsp;tons of coal, although in practice they could store up to 3,100&nbsp;tons. Fuel consumption on the six-hour forced trial was 0.667&nbsp;kilogram per horsepower/hour at {{convert|76795|shp|MW|abbr=on}}, and .712&nbsp;kg per hp/hr at {{convert|71275|shp|MW|abbr=on}} for both ships.<ref name="Groner54"/>

===Armament===
The main armament was ten 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) SK L/50<ref group=A>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (''Schnellfeuerkanone'') denotes that the gun is quick firing, while the L/50 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/50 gun is 50 [[Calibers#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 50 times long as it is in diameter.</ref> guns in five twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. The guns were placed in Drh.L C/1908 turret mounts; these mountings allowed a maximum elevation of 13.5&nbsp;degrees.<ref name="Staff 12" /> This elevation was 7.5&nbsp;degrees less than in the preceding ''Von der Tann'', and, as a consequence, the range was slightly shorter, at 18,100&nbsp;m (19,800&nbsp;yd), than the 18,900&nbsp;m (20,700&nbsp;yd) of ''Von der Tann''{{'}}s guns. In 1916, during a refit, the elevation was increased to 16 degrees, for an increased range of 19,100&nbsp;m (20,900&nbsp;yd).<ref name="Gardiner 152"/> One turret, ''Anton'', was located fore, two aft (''Dora'' turret [[superfire|superfiring]] over ''Emil''), and two, ''Bruno'' and ''C<U+00E4>sar'', were [[Gun_turret#Wing_turrets|wing turrets]] mounted en echelon. The guns fired [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] and semi-armor-piercing shells, which both weighed 302&nbsp;kg (670&nbsp;lb). The guns could fire at a rate of 3 rounds per minute, and had a [[muzzle velocity]] of 895&nbsp;m/s (2,940&nbsp;ft/s). A total of 810 of these shells were stored aboard the ship.<ref name="Staff 12" />

The ships' secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 cm (5.9 in) SK L/45 cannon, mounted in the MPL C/06 mounts as in ''Von der Tann''. The guns had a total of 1800 shells, at 150 per gun. The 15&nbsp;cm guns had a range of 13,500&nbsp;m (14,800&nbsp;yd) at construction, although this was later extended to 18,800&nbsp;m (18,373&nbsp;yd).<ref name="Staff 12" /> Initially, twelve 8.8&nbsp;cm (3.5&nbsp;in) SK L/45 guns were also fitted to defend the ships against [[torpedo boat]]s and [[destroyer]]s, but these were later removed, with the guns in the aft superstructure replaced with four 8.8&nbsp;cm [[Flak]] L/45 guns.<ref name="Gardiner 152"/>

''Moltke'' and ''Goeben'' were also armed with four 50&nbsp;cm (20&nbsp;in) [[torpedo tube]]s; one fore, one aft, and two on the [[broadside]], with 11 [[torpedo]]es stored. The torpedoes were of the G/7 model, which weighed 1,365&nbsp;kg (3,010&nbsp;lb) and carried a warhead weighing 195 kg (430 lb). The torpedoes had a maximum range of 9,300&nbsp;m (10,200&nbsp;yd) at 27&nbsp;knots (50&nbsp;km/h), and 4,000&nbsp;m (4,400&nbsp;yd) when set at 37&nbsp;knots (69 km/h).<ref>Staff, pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref>

===Armor===
The level of armor protection for the ''Moltke'' class was increased from the ''Von der Tann'' design, to 10 cm (3.9 in) in the forward [[Belt armor|main belt]], 27 cm (11 in) in the citadel, and 10 cm (3.9 in) aft. The [[casemate]]s were protected by 15 cm (5.9 in) vertically and 3.5 cm (1.4 in) on the roofs. The forward [[conning tower]] was protected by 35 cm (14 in), and the aft tower had 20 cm (7.9 in) of armor. The turrets had 23 cm (9.1 in) on the face, 18 cm (7.1 in) on the sides, and 9 cm (3.5 in) on the roofs. The deck armor and sloping armor were both 5 cm (2.0 in), as was the torpedo bulkhead around the barbettes. The [[torpedo bulkhead]] was 3 cm (1.2 in) in other, less critical areas.<ref name="Staff13" /> As with ''Von der Tann'', the armor was [[Krupp]] [[Krupp cemented steel|cemented and nickel steel]].<ref name="Groner54"/>

==Service history==
The ''Moltke'' class ships participated in many of the major naval battles during [[World War I]]. ''Moltke'' was stationed in the [[North Sea]], while her sister ''Goeben'' operated in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] flag.

===Moltke===
{{main|SMS Moltke (1910)}}
[[File:SMS Moltke Visiting New York 1912.jpg|thumb|right|''Moltke'' in New York City in 1912]]
{{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} replaced the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Roon||2}} in the I Scouting Group on 30 September 1911. On 19 April 1912, ''Moltke'' and light cruisers {{SMS|Stettin||2}} and {{SMS|Bremen||2}} departed Germany for a goodwill visit to the United States, and arrived on 30 May. In early July, ''Moltke'' escorted [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II's]] yacht to Russia. Once the ship returned, the commander of the I Scouting Group made ''Moltke'' his flagship<U+2014>a role in which she served until Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]] transferred his flag to the newer battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} on 23 June 1914.<ref>Staff, p. 15</ref>

''Moltke'' participated in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the German Navy during the [[First World War]], including the Battles of [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]] in the North Sea, and the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] and [[Operation Albion]] in the Baltic. The ship took part in several operations to bombard the English coast, including the first [[raid on Yarmouth]], the attack on the towns of [[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby|Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby]], and the second raid on [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft|Yarmouth and Lowestoft]]. ''Moltke'' was damaged several times during the war: the ship was hit by heavy-caliber gunfire at Jutland, and torpedoed twice by British submarines while on fleet advances.<ref>Staff, pp. 15<U+2013>16</ref>

Following the end of the war in 1918, ''Moltke'', together with most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at [[Scapa Flow]] pending a decision by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end when she was [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled by her crew]], along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in 1919 to prevent them from being seized by the British [[Royal Navy]].<ref name="Staff17"/> The wreck of ''Moltke'' was raised on 10 June 1927, and scrapped at [[Rosyth]] from 1927 to 1929.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner p. 55</ref>

===Goeben===
{{main|SMS Goeben}}
Following the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]] in October 1912, the German High Command decided to create a Mediterranean Division in an attempt to exert influence in the area. The new squadron consisted of ''Goeben'' and the light cruiser {{SMS|Breslau||2}}; the two ships left [[Kiel]] on 4 November and arrived off Constantinople on 15 November. The ships visited several Mediterranean ports, including [[Venice]], [[Pula|Pola]], and [[Naples]]. The First Balkan War ended on 30 May 1913, and there was some consideration given to withdrawing the pair to German waters. However, [[Second Balkan War|the conflict reignited]] less than a month later on 29 June, meaning the ships would have to remain in the area.<ref name="Staff18">Staff, p. 18</ref>

[[File:Yavuz (Goeben) battlecruiser Istanbul April 1946 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|''Yavuz'' (former ''Goeben'') off Istanbul during the visit of the American battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} in April 1946]]
Following the assassination of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] on 28 June 1914, Rear Admiral [[Wilhelm Souchon]] recognized the imminent outbreak of war, and so immediately sailed to Pola for repair work for ''Goeben''. The ships were then ordered to steam to Constantinople. While en route, they were [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursued by British forces]], but ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' managed to evade them and reach Istanbul by 10 August 1914.<ref name="Staff18"/> ''Goeben'' was transferred to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renamed TCG ''Yavuz Sultan Selim'' after Sultan [[Selim I]]. Popularly known as ''Yavuz'', she was designated as the [[flagship]] of the [[Ottoman Navy]], but she retained her German crew. ''Goeben'', flying the Ottoman flag, bombarded the Russian port of [[Sevastopol]], captured and sank a Russian minesweeper, and damaged a [[destroyer]] on 29 October 1914. The Russian government responded by declaring war on the Ottoman Empire on 1 November; Britain and France followed suit on 5 November.<ref>Staff, p. 19</ref>  By acting as a [[fleet in being]], ''Goeben'' effectively blocked a Russian advance into the [[Bosporus]], and defended against a similar incursion of British and French [[pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnoughts]].<ref>Staff, pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref> More powerful British and French warships<U+2014>which could have dealt with ''Goeben''<U+2014>could not be risked in the heavily mined and [[U-boat]] patrolled Turkish waters.<ref>Bennett, p. 275</ref>

In 1936 she was renamed TCG ''Yavuz'' and remained the flagship of the [[Turkish Navy]] until 1950, although the ship was largely stationary in [[Izmit]] from 1948. In 1952, Turkey joined [[NATO]], and the ship was assigned the hull number "B70". ''Yavuz'' was decommissioned on 20 December 1960, and removed from the navy register on 14 November 1964. The Turkish government attempted to preserve the ship as a museum, including an offer to [[West Germany]] to sell the ship back in 1963, but none of the efforts were successful. ''Goeben'' was sold for scrapping in 1971, and was eventually broken up between 1973 and 1976<U+2014>the last remaining ship of the Imperial German Navy.<ref name="Sturton">Sturton, p. 147</ref>
