The '''Afghan National Army''' (ANA) is the main branch of the [[military of Afghanistan]] and is responsible for [[army|land-based military]] [[military operations|operations]] or [[ground warfare]] to defend the nation against foreign military incursions. It is under the [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]] in [[Kabul]] and is assembled by [[NATO]] states. The [[Kabul Military Training Center]] and the [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]] serve as the main compounds for training the new army. The [[Afghan Defense University]] (ADF), after completion, will serve as the primary educational institution for the army as well as the [[Afghan Air Force]]. The ANA is divided into six regional [[Corps]], with about 180,000 active troops as of December 2011,<ref name=ABC/> although others claim only 100,000 troops are active.<ref name=Globeandmail/> The current [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the Afghan National Army is [[Lieutenant General|Lt. Gen.]] [[Sher Mohammad Karimi]].

Afghanistan's army traces its roots to the early 18th-century when the [[Hotaki dynasty]] was established in [[Kandahar]] followed by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]]'s rise to power. It was reorganized in 1880 during [[Emir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]]'s reign.<ref name="BB">British Battles: [http://britishbattles.com/second-afghan-war/maiwand.htm Second Afghan War (Battle of Maiwand)] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQIhCZ4i|date =2011-02-11}}</ref><ref name="BB2">British Battles: [http://britishbattles.com/second-afghan-war/kandahar.htm Second Afghan War (March to Kandahar and the Battle of Baba Wali)] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQIiRliP|date =2011-02-11}}</ref><ref name="BB3">British Battles: [http://britishbattles.com/first-afghan-war/ghuznee.htm First Afghan War (Battle of Ghuznee)] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQIjiKqX|date =2011-02-11}}</ref><ref name="BB4">British Battles: [http://britishbattles.com/first-afghan-war/kabul-1842.htm First Afghan War (Battle of Kabul 1842)] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQJX5K7F|date =2011-02-11}}</ref><ref name="BB5">British Battles: [http://britishbattles.com/first-afghan-war/kabul-gandamak.htm First Afghan War (Battle of Kabul and retreat to Gandamak)] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQJXrQgz|date =2011-02-11}}</ref><ref name="BB6">British Battles: [http://britishbattles.com/first-afghan-war/siege-jellalabad.htm First Afghan War (The Siege of Jellalabad)] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQJYLMkP|date =2011-02-11}}</ref> During [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], Afghanistan remained a [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] state. From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the army of Afghanistan was equipped by the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1992, the national army fragmented into regional militias under various [[Northern Alliance|local warlords]]. This was followed by the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban government]] in the mid 1990s, which was minimally supported by the [[Pakistani Armed Forces|armed forces of Pakistan]].

After the end of the Taliban rule in late 2001, the new Afghan National Army was formed by NATO states. Billions of dollars worth of [[Military technology and equipment|military equipment]], [[military base|facilities]], and other forms of aid has been provided to the ANA. Some of the weapons arrived from the [[United States]], which included [[Humvee]]s and other trucks, [[M16 rifle|M-16]] [[assault rifle]]s, [[bulletproof vest|body armored jackets]] as well as other types of vehicles and military equipment. It also included the building of a national [[Command center#Military|military command center]], with training compounds in different parts of the country. To thwart and dissolve anti-government militant groups, the [[Karzai administration]] began offering cash and vocational training to encourage members to join the nation's security forces. NATO is expanding the Afghan armed forces to about 260,000 active personnel by 2015, a move supported and funded primarily by the [[United States Department of Defense]].<ref name="BBC NEWS">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7952085.stm|title=Obama 'mulls Afghan army boost' |author=BBC NEWS|publisher=BBC NEWS| accessdate=19 March 2009|date=2009-03-19|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wQIgfbpP |archivedate = 2011-02-11|deadurl=no}}</ref> There were more than 4,000 [[United States armed forces|American military]] trainers in late 2009 and additional numbers from other NATO member states, providing advanced warfare training to the Afghan armed forces and [[Afghan National Police|police]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/world/asia/16mullen.html?_r=1 |title=Admiral Mullen testifies before committee |publisher=New York Times |date=November 1, 2009 |first=Thom |last=Shanker |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Afghan infantry.jpg|thumb|upright|Afghan Army infantry soldier in 1890]]
The modern army has its roots to the [[Hotaki dynasty]] which was formed in April 1709, before the establishment of the [[Durrani Empire|Afghan Empire]] by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]]. In 1880 [[Emir|Amir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] established a newly equipped Afghan army with help from the [[United Kingdom|British]].<ref name="BB"/><ref name="BB2"/><ref name="BB3"/><ref name="BB4"/><ref name="BB5"/><ref name="BB6"/> The Afghan army was more modernized by King [[Amanullah Khan]] in the early 20th century just before the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]]. King Amanullah and his Afghan army fought against the British in 1919, resulting in Afghanistan becoming fully independent after the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]] was signed. The Afghan army was further upgraded during King [[Zahir Shah]]'s reign, starting in 1933.
[[File:1950s Afghanistan - Afghan Army soldiers on parade.jpg|thumb|left|Afghan army soldiers in the 1950s.]]

From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the Afghan army received training and equipment mostly from the former [[Soviet Union]]. Before the 1978 [[Saur Revolution|Marxist revolution]], according to military analyst George Jacobs, the armed forces included "some three armored divisions (570 medium tanks plus T 55s on order), eight infantry divisions (averaging 4,500 to 8,000 men each), two mountain infantry brigades, one artillery brigade, a guards regiment (for palace protection), three artillery regiments, two commando regiments, and a parachute battalion (largely grounded). All the formations were under the control of three corps level headquarters. All but three infantry divisions were facing [[Pakistan]] along a line from [[Bagram]] south to Khandahar."<ref>[[Globalsecurity.org]], [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/cs-invasion.htm The 1978 Revolution and the Soviet invasion]. Retrieved October 2007.</ref> After the [[coup]], desertions swept the force, affecting the loyalty and moral values of soldiers, there were purges on patriotic junior and senior officers, and upper class Afghan [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] in society.

Gradually the army's three armoured divisions (4th and 15th at Kabul/Bagram and 7th at Khandahar) and now sixteen infantry divisions dropped in size to between battalion and regiment sized, with no formation stronger than about 5,000 troops.<ref>Jane's Military Review 1982<U+2013>1983, Jane's Main Battle Tanks 1986<U+2013>1987, David C. Isby, Ten Million Bayonets, Orion Publishing Group Ltd, 1988</ref> During the 1980s [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], the national army of Afghanistan was involved in fighting against the [[mujahideen]] rebel groups. A big problem in the Afghan army became deserters or defectors. The Afghan army's casualties were as high as 50<U+2013>60,000 and another 50,000 deserted the armed forces. The Afghan army's defection rate was about 10,000 per year between 1980<U+2013>89, the average deserters left the Afghan army after the first five months.<ref name="organizations"/>

By 1992, after the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan and the fall of the communist regime in Kabul, the Soviet-trained army splintered between the government in Kabul and the various warring factions.<ref>See for example Anthony Davis, 'The Battlegrounds of Northern Afghanistan,' Jane's Intelligence Review, July 1994, p.323 onwards</ref> By mid 1994 for example, there were two parallel 6th Corps operating in the north. [[Abdul Rashid Dostam]]'s 6th Corps was based at [[Pul-i-Khumri]] and had three divisions. The Defence Ministry of the Kabul government's 6th Corps was based at [[Kunduz]] and also had three divisions, two sharing numbers with formations in Dostum's corps.<ref>Anthony Davies, JIR, July 1994</ref> During that time local [[militia]] forces were formed or the former Soviet era national army units 'regionalised;' both provided security for their own people living in the territories they controlled. The country was factionalized with different warlords controlling the territories they claimed, and there was no officially recognized national army in the country.

This era was followed by the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban regime]] in 1996, which removed the militia forces and decided to control the country by [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia law]]. The Taliban also began training its own army troops and commanders, some of whom were secretly trained by the intelligence agency ([[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]) or [[Pakistani Armed Forces]] in the border region on the [[Durand Line]]. After the removal of the Taliban government in late 2001, private armies or militia forces took over security around the country. Formations in existence by the end of 2002 included the 1st Army Corps ([[Nangrahar]]), 2nd Army Corps ([[Kandahar]], dominated by [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and his allies), 3rd Army Corps ([[Paktia]], where the US allegedly attempted to impose Atiquallah Ludin as commander), 4th Army Corps ([[Herat]], dominated by [[Ismail Khan]]), 6th Army Corps at Kunduz, 7th Army Corps (under [[Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor|Atta Mohammad Noor]] at [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] in Balkh Province<ref>[http://wwww.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/AllDocsByUNID/639a42fe70c4d0ca49256f1f0007f3b6 ReliefWeb <U+0165> Document <U+0165> Army develops despite militia disarmament issues] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQJaJBua|date =2011-02-11}}</ref>), 8th Army Corps (at Shiberghan, dominated by Dostum's [[National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan]]) and the Central Army Corps around Kabul.<ref>Antonio Giustozzi, 'Military Reform in Afghanistan,' in Confronting Afghanistan's Security Dilemmas, Bonn International Centre for Conversion, Brief 28, September 2003, p.23-31, and http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/militia-fac-list.htm</ref>
[[File:First ANA graduates in 2002.jpg|thumb|left|The first batch of graduates of the new Afghan National Army (ANA) in 2002.]]

The new Afghan National Army was founded with the issue of a decree by [[President of Afghanistan|President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] on December 1, 2002.<ref>[http://www.cstc-a.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200&Itemid=147.

The first new Afghan battalion was trained by [[British Army]] personnel of the [[International Security Assistance Force]], becoming 1st Battalion, Afghan National Guard.<ref>Antonio Giustozzi, 'Auxiliary Force or National Army: Afghanistan <U+2018>ANA<U+2019> and the COIN Effort,' 2002<U+2013>2006, Small Wars and Insurgencies, Vol. 18, No.1, p.48, March 2007</ref> Yet while the British troops provided high quality training, they were few in number. After some consideration, it was decided that [[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Army Special Forces]] might be able to provide the training. Thus follow-on battalions were recruited and trained by 1st Battalion, [[3rd Special Forces Group (United States)|3rd Special Forces Group]] of Ft. Bragg, NC, under the command of LTC McDonnell. 3rd SFG built the training facilities and ranges for early use, using a Soviet built facility on the eastern side of Kabul, near the then ISAF headquarters. The first training commenced in May 2002, with a difficult but successful recruitment process of bringing hundreds of new recruits in from all parts of Afghanistan. Early training was done in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Dari (Persian)]] and some Arabic due to the very diverse ethnicities.<ref name="3fsg">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/3sfg.htm 3rd Special Forces Group]. globalsecurity.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-27.</ref>

By January 2003 just over 1,700 soldiers in five ''Kandaks'' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]] for [[battalion]]s) had completed the 10-week training course, and by mid 2003 a total of 4,000 troops had been trained. Approximately 1,000 ANA soldiers were deployed in the US-led [[Operation Warrior Sweep]], marking the first major combat operation for Afghan troops. Initial recruiting problems lay in the lack of cooperation from regional warlords and inconsistent international support. The problem of desertion dogged the force in its early days: in the summer of 2003, the desertion rate was estimated to be 10% and in mid-March 2004, estimate suggested that 3,000 soldiers had deserted. Some recruits were under 18 years of age and many could not read or write. Recruits who only spoke the Pashto language experienced difficulty because instruction was usually given through interpreters who spoke Dari.

In March 2004, fighting erupted in the western city of [[Herat]] between Ismail Khan's private army and the Defense Ministry's 4th Corps militia.<ref>[[Globalsecurity.org]], [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/ismail.htm General Mohammed Ismail Khan]. Retrieved 15 August 2009.</ref> Ismail Khan's son [[Mirwais Sadiq]] was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade during the military standoff between his father and the Defense Ministry's Herat Division commander, General Abdul Zaher Nayebzadah. The death toll from the fighting was estimated at 50 to 100 people. In response to the fighting, about 1,500 Afghan National Army troops were deployed to Herat. The ANA were sent to the garrison of the 17th Herat Division of the Defense Ministry's 4th Corps <U+2013> General Abdul Zaher Nayebzadah's headquarters. The 17th Division headquarters had been overrun by Ismail Khan's private militia on 21 March.

===Kandak===

The basic unit in the Afghan National Army is the ''kandak'' (battalion), consisting of 600 troops. Kandaks may be further broken down into four ''toli'' (company-sized units).<ref>Tim Mahon. [http://www.tsjonline.com/story.php?F=4446331 Basic steps: Afghan Army and police trainers and trainees see progress]. ''Training and Simulation Journal''. February 01, 2010</ref> Although the vast majority of kandaks are infantry, at least one mechanized and one tank battalion have been formed; more may be planned. Every ANA Corps will be assigned an [[ANA Commando Brigade]] with the sixth designated as a special national unit under the Afghan Defense Ministry's purview.

{{As of|2005|09}}, 28 of the 31 Afghan National Army battalions were ready for combat operations and many had already participated in them. At least nine brigades are planned at this time, each consisting of six battalions. By March 1, 2007, half of the planned army of 70,000 ANA soldiers had been achieved with 46 of the planned 76 Afghan battalions operating in the fore or in concert with NATO forces. The size and limits of the ANA were specified in the [[Bonn]] II Agreement, signed in 2002. This agreement called for the establishment of the ANA and formal development of Afghan forces under NATO doctrine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Brigades===
A total of 14 brigades that will primarily be regionally oriented are planned for 2008. According to [[Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan]] (CSTC-A) thirteen of these brigades are to be light infantry, one will be mechanized and one will be commando.

===Corps===

[[File:Soldiers of 215th Corps in 2010.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[215th Corps (Afghanistan)|215th Corps]]]]
Currently the Afghan National Army maintains seven [[corps]]; each corps is responsible for one major area of the country. Each corps has three to four subordinate brigades, and each brigade has four infantry battalions as its basic fighting unit. Each infantry battalion is assigned a specific area for which it is responsible, the battalion's mission is to secure its area from internal and external threats. Originally, the four outlying corps were assigned one or two brigades, with the majority of the manpower of the army based in Kabul's 201st Corps. This was superseded by a buildup in which each corps added extra brigades. Establishment of the corps started when four regional corps commanders and some of their staff were appointed on 1 September 2004.

Five, plus a newly forming corps, serve as regional commands for the ANA:

===ANA Combat Support Organizations===

As the ANA has grown to almost its full size the focus has now changed to further development of the force so that it becomes self sustainable. One program is the development of the ANA Combat Support Organizations, The Corps Logistics Battalions (CLB) and the Combat Support Battalions (CSB)

====ANA Combat Support Battalions====
Combat Support Battalions (CSB) provide specialized services for infantry battalions. While most ANA Battalions have a CBS they are underdeveloped and do not fit the requirements of a growing army. The CBS role includes motor fleet maintenance, specialized communications, scouting, engineering, and long range artillery units. Eventually one fully developed CBS will be assigned to each of the 24 ANA Combat Brigades.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> 

Each CSB includes an Intelligence Company called a Cashf Tolai. Each Intelligence Company is responsible for collecting information about the surrounding area and Taliban activities.<ref>[http://www.dvidshub.net/news/80529/afghan-national-army-connects-surveys-secures-sangin#.Tue_-kyJunR DVIDS <U+2013> News <U+2013> Afghan National Army connects, surveys, secures in Sangin].

Members of the [[Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan: Allies|coalition forces in Afghanistan]] have undertaken different responsibilities in the creation of the ANA. All these various efforts are managed on the Coalition side by [[Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan]] (CSTC-A), a three-star level multi-national command headquartered in downtown [[Kabul]]. On the ANA side, {{as of|2006|07|lc=yes}} all training and education in the Army is managed and implemented by the newly formed Afghan National Army Training Command (ANATC), a two-star command which reports directly to the Chief of the General Staff. All training centers and military schools are under ANATC HQ. The coalition forces are partnered with the ANA to mentor and support formal training through [[Task Force Phoenix]]. This program was formalized in April 2003, based near the [[Kabul Military Training Center]] coordinating collective and individual training, mentoring, and Coalition Force support.

Each ANA HQ above battalion level has an embedded [[Operational Mentor and Liaison Team]] (OMLT) of NATO trainers and mentors acting as liaisons between ANA and [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]. The OMLTs co-ordinate operational planning and ensure that the ANA units receive enabling support.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090404031750/http://www.nato.int/issues/afghanistan/factsheets/omlt.html Operational Mentor and Liaison Team (OMLT) Programme]. Nato.int. September 2007</ref>

Individual [[basic training]] is conducted primarily by Afghan National Army instructors and staff at ANATC's Kabul Military Training Center, situated on the eastern edge of the capital. The ANA are still supported, however, with various levels of CSTC-A oversight, mentorship, and assistance. The [[Military of the United States|US military]] assists in the basic and advanced training of [[enlisted]] recruits, and also runs the Drill Instructor School which produces new training NCOs for the basic training courses. Basic training has been expanded to include required literacy courses for recruits who don't already know how to read.

A [[French Army]] advisory team oversees the training of officers for staff and platoon or company command in a combined commissioning/infantry officer training unit called the Officer Training Brigade, also located at Kabul Military Training Center. OTB candidates in the platoon- and company- command courses are usually older former militia and mujaheddin leaders with various levels of military experience.

The [[United Kingdom]] also conducts initial infantry officer training and commissioning at the Officer Candidate School. While OCS is administratively under OTB's control, it is kept functionally separate. OCS candidates are young men with little or no military experience. The [[British Army]] also conduct initial and advanced [[Non-Commissioned Officer]] training as well in a separate NCO Training Brigade.

The [[Canadian Forces]] supervises the Combined Training Exercise portion of initial military training, where trainee soldiers, NCOs, and officers are brought together in field training exercises at the [[platoon]], [[company (military unit)|company]] and (theoretically) [[battalion]] levels to certify them ready for field operations. In the Regional Corps, line ANA battalions have attached Coalition [[Embedded Training Teams]] that continue to mentor the battalion's leadership, and advise in the areas of intelligence, communications, fire support, logistics and infantry tactics.

Formal education and professional development is currently conducted at two main ANATC schools, both in Kabul. The [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]], located near [[Kabul International Airport]], is a four-year military university, which will produce degreed second lieutenants in a variety of military professions. NMAA's first cadet class entered its second academic year in spring 2006. A contingent of US and [[Turkish Army|Turkish military]] instructors jointly mentor the NMAA faculty and staff. The Command and General Staff College, located in southern Kabul, prepares mid-level ANA officers to serve on brigade and corps staffs. France established the CGSC in early 2004, and a cadre of French Army instructors continues to oversee operations at the school. A National Defense University will also be established at a potential site in northwestern Kabul. Eventually all initial officer training (to include the NMAA) as well as the CGSC will be re-located to the new NDU facility.

According to Lieutenant Colonel Kane Mangin of the Australian-led of the International Artillery Training Team, the Afghan National Army (ANA) Artillery Training School in Kabul is expected to train enough officers and NCOs for about 23 artillery batteries, using the D-30 howitzers of the ANA Artillery Branch.

==Operations==
[[File:Platoon of ANA soldiers at a rescue operation in 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[platoon]] of ANA soldiers at a rescue operation in February 2005.]]

Following the crash of [[Kam Air Flight 904]] on February 4, 2005, The [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) made numerous unsuccessful helicopter rescue operation attempts. But when technology failed, Afghan National Army soldiers searched for the plane. The Ministry of Defense ordered the ANA's Central Corps to assemble a team to attempt a rescue of victims presumed to be alive. The crash site was at an altitude of {{convert|11000|ft|m}} on the peak of the Chaperi Mountain, {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of the Afghan capital of Kabul.<ref>Mack Davis [http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=25895 Afghan National Army Assists in Plane Crash Aftermath].

The Afghan army caught the senior Taliban leader Mullah Mahmood near Khandahar, who was wearing a Burkha. Mahmood was suspected of organizing suicide attacks in [[Kandahar province]].<ref>[http://www.680news.com/news/international/article.jsp?content=w030725A Afghan National Army captures senior Taliban leader near Kandahar]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> More than forty-nine Taliban fighters were killed by the Afghan forces in one of the independent operations carried out by the Afghan forces.<ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/QPeriod/20070323/taliban_nato_070323/ 49 Taliban killed by Afghan forces].

===Battle of Musa Qala===
{{Main|Battle of Musa Qala}}
After 10 months in Taliban hands, the town of Musa Qala was retaken by Afghan National Army backed by ISAF and coalition support. Taliban insurgents had scattered mostly to the north.

===Operation Panther's Claw===
{{Main|Operation Panther's Claw}}
Operation Panchai Palang, or Panther's Claw, was a United Kingdom-led military operation of the War in Afghanistan in Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan. United Kingdom, Afghanistan, [[Denmark]] and [[Estonia]] contributed a total of 3,000 soldiers for the operation. The alliance targeted Afghan and Pakistani-based Taliban involved in the [[Opium production in Afghanistan|drug trade]]. The battle ran, for a period of time, simultaneously with the US-Afghan [[Operation Strike of the Sword]].

===Operation Khanjar (Strike of the Sword)===
{{Main|Operation Strike of the Sword}}
Operation Strike of the Sword or Operation Khanjar is an ongoing US-led offensive in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. About 4,000 Marines from the [[2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade]] as well as 650 Afghan soldiers are involved, supported by NATO planes. The operation began when units moved into the Helmand river valley in the early hours of July 2, 2009. This operation is the largest Marine offensive since the battle of Fallujah, [[Operation Phantom Fury]], in 2004. The operation is also the largest airlift offensive since the [[Vietnam War]].

==Equipment==
Since the early 1970s, the Afghan army has been equipped with the Russian [[AK-47]] as their main service rifle. In 2008, it slowly began replacing the AK-47s with the American [[M16 rifle]]s. They also began swapping their pick-up trucks for American [[Humvees]] as well as adopting other [[NATO]] weapons into their arsenal.<ref>[http://arsicsouth7.wordpress.com/2008/10/11/army-times-national-army-swaps-ak47s-for-m16s-pickups-for-humvees/ Army Times: National Army swaps AK47s for M16s, pickups for Humvees]. Arsicsouth7.wordpress.com (2008-10-11). Retrieved on 2011-12-27.</ref>

The Afghan National Army has a contract with International Trucks. It will provide a fleet of 2,781 trucks which can be used for transporting personnel, water, petroleum and a recovery truck. The Afghan National Army has already received 374 out of the 2,781 trucks.

According to statements made by Colonel Thomas McGrath on October 19, 2007 the coalition supporting the build-up of the ANA has seen progress and is pleased with the Afghan performance in recent exercises. McGrath estimated that the ANA should be capable of carrying out independent brigade-size operations by the spring of 2008.<ref>Jim Garamone and David Mays, American Forces Press Service [http://www.army.mil/article/5663/afghan-coalition-forces-battle-taliban-narcotics-emphasize-training/ Afghan, Coalition Forces Battle Taliban, Narcotics, Emphasize Training].

According to Marin Strmecki, a member of the Defense Policy Board and a former top Pentagon adviser on Afghanistan in a speech to the [[United States Senate]], "the Afghan Army should increase to 250,000 soldiers and the National Police Force should add more than 100,000 officers. Only when Afghan security forces reaches those numbers would they achieve the level necessary for success in counterinsurgency."<ref name="U.S. Plans Vastly Expanded Afghan Security Force "/> On March 19, 2009, American President [[Barack Obama]] called for an expansion of the Afghan National Army to 260,000 soldiers. The cost would reach $20 billion dollars and would beef up Afghan manpower as well as inject the army with more modern equipment.<ref name="U.S. Plans Vastly Expanded Afghan Security Force "/>

'Local Ownership and Security Sector Reform,' DCAF/Lit Verlag, Zurich/Berlin, 2008 <U+2018>Local Ownership.<U+2019> Portrays a varying level of vested interest/warlord subversion of reform among the various security agencies; little local ownership at the MOD/ANA despite several attempts to seize more local control and subvert the foreign process by not proving enough personnel, imposing different officers, and wanting a conscript force. The army is financially unsustainable even at 70,000 strong and not being trained for combat in small units.
