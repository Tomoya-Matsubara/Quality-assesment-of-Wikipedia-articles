'''Richard Douglas Greene Jr.''' (born January 2, 1971 in [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]]) is a former right-handed [[Major League Baseball]] relief pitcher who appeared in one game for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in 1999. He was 6'5" tall and he weighed 200 pounds.

Prior to playing professional baseball, Greene attended [[Coral Gables High School]] and then [[Louisiana State University]]. He helped lead LSU to victory in the [[1991 College World Series]].

Originally drafted by the [[New York Yankees]] in the 14th round of the [[1989 Major League Baseball Draft|1989 draft]], Greene chose not to sign. However, when he was chosen 16th overall in the [[1992 Major League Baseball Draft|1992 draft]] by the [[Detroit Tigers]], he did sign. 

He competed in the [[1992 Barcelona Olympics]], so he did not play professionally that year. He began his professional career in 1993, splitting time between the [[Lakeland Tigers]] and [[London Tigers]]. In a combined 49 relief appearances, he went 4-5 with a 6.33 ERA. In 1993, he was ranked the sixth best prospect in the Tigers organization by [[Baseball America]]. In 1994, he split the season between the Lakeland Tigers and [[Trenton Thunder]], going 1-5 with a 5.64 ERA in 39 games. That year, he started the only two games of his professional career and he was ranked the fifth best prospect in the Tigers organization by Baseball America.<ref>http://thebaseballcube.com/players/G/Rick-Greene.shtml</ref> He also earned the first save in Trenton Thunder history that season.<ref> {{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Christopher T. |title=Filling in the Seams|year=1997 |publisher=B B& A Publishers |isbn=0738513105|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y_mqBIir7TUC&pg=PA54&vq=greene&source=gbs_search_s}} </ref> He showed a marked improvement in 1995 while pitching for the [[Jacksonville Suns]]. For them he went 6-2 with a 3.49 ERA in 32 appearances. He again pitched for the Suns in 1996, going 2-7 with 30 saves and a 4.98 ERA in 57 appearances and earning an All Star berth. In 1997, he played for the [[Toledo Mud Hens]], going 6-8 with a 2.83 ERA in 57 games. On November 20, 1997, he was traded with [[Mike Myers (baseball)|Mike Myers]] and [[Santiago P<U+00E9>rez (baseball)|Santiago Perez]] to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for [[Bryce Florie]] and cash.

Greene spent only one season in the Brewers farm system - 1998. Pitching for the [[Louisville Redbirds]], he went 6-6 with a 3.51 ERA and 18 saves in 58 games. He was granted free agency on October 15.

Signed by the Reds on February 9, 1999, Greene went 5-7 with a 3.69 ERA in 61 appearances for their Triple-A minor league affiliate the [[Indianapolis Indians]]. He made his lone big league appearance on June 19 of that year, against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. Coming to relieve for [[Ron Villone]] (who lasted only 1/3 of an inning because he gave up six earned runs), Greene pitched 5 2/3 innings, allowing seven hits, four runs and three earned runs while walking one batter and striking out two. He gave up a home run to the first batter he ever faced, [[Jose Valentin]] and his ERA for the game was 4.76.

Granted free agency on October 10, 1999, Greene was signed by the [[Minnesota Twins]] and began the 2000 season with the [[Salt Lake Buzz]]. For them he went 2-2 with a 5.81 ERA in 22 appearances. He then wound up in the Reds organization again, appearing in 32 games for the [[Louisville RiverBats]], going 4-4 with a 2.82 ERA in 32 games. Overall, he went 6-6 with a 4.04 ERA. 

He wrapped up his professional career in 2001, pitching for the [[Baton Rouge Blue Marlins]] of the [[All-American Association]]. An All-Star, he led the league that year with 21 saves.
