== Childhood ==
{{main|Jim and Mary McCartney}}
McCartney was born on 18&nbsp;June 1942, in [[Walton Hospital]], [[Liverpool]], England, where his mother, Mary (n<U+00E9>e Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James ("Jim") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War&nbsp;II.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=75}}  McCartney has one younger brother, [[Mike McGear|Michael]] (born 7&nbsp;January 1944). The two boys were baptised in their mother's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] faith, but religion was not emphasised in the household, as Jim was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] turned [[agnostic]], who felt Catholic schools sacrificed the education of their students for the sake of their religious teachings.<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=4}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=1}}: (secondary source).</ref>

McCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at Stockton.<ref>{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=1}}: Transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at Stockton; {{harvnb|Carlin|2009|p=13}}: Transferred to Joseph Williams in 1949.</ref> The following year he passed the [[11-plus]] exam, with only three others out of ninety examinees, gaining admission to the [[Liverpool Institute High School for Boys|Liverpool Institute]].<ref>For his attendance at Joseph Williams Junior School see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8203923.stm|title=Beatle's schoolboy photo auction |publisher=BBC News|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=13 June 2012}}; For McCartney passing the 11-plus exam see: {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=9}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|pp=1<U+2013>2}}: (secondary source).</ref> In 1954, he met Harrison on the bus to the Institute from his suburban home in [[Speke]]. Harrison had also passed the exam, meaning he could attend a [[grammar school]] rather than a [[secondary modern]] school, where most pupils went until becoming eligible to work. The two soon became friends, although McCartney later admitted: "I tended to talk down to him, because he was a year younger."<ref>{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=2}}: The two soon became friends, "I tended to talk down to him, because he was a year younger"; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=82<U+2013>83}}: On grammar school versus secondary modern, 125: On meeting Harrison.</ref>

Mary was the family's primary wage earner, and her income as a [[Midwifery|midwife]] allowed the family to move into [[20&nbsp;Forthlin Road]] in [[Allerton, Merseyside|Allerton]], where they lived until 1964.<ref>{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=2}}: "Mary was the family's primary wage earner"; {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=340<U+2013>341}}: "where they lived through 1964".</ref> She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at "about three in the morning [the] streets&nbsp;... thick with snow".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=6}} On 31&nbsp;October 1956, when McCartney was fourteen, his mother died of an [[embolism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=2}}: On Mary's death (secondary source); {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=20}}: On Mary's death (primary source).</ref> McCartney's loss later became a point of connection with Lennon, whose mother, [[Julia Lennon|Julia]], had died when he was seventeen.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=31}}

McCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an [[upright piano]] in the front room, and he encouraged his sons to be musical.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=22}}{{refn|group=nb|Jim McCartney's father Joe played an E-flat [[tuba]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=71}} He pointed out the bass parts in songs on the radio, and often took his sons to local [[brass band]] concerts.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=23<U+2013>24}}}} He gave McCartney a [[nickel]]-plated [[trumpet]] for his fourteenth birthday, but when [[rock and roll]] became popular on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], it was traded for a <U+00A3>15 [[Framus]] Zenith (model&nbsp;17) [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]], rationalising that it would be difficult to sing while playing a trumpet.<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=21}}: Jim gave McCartney a nickel-plated trumpet which was later traded for a Zenith acoustic guitar; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=86}}: when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg.</ref> He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a [[Slim Whitman]] concert and realising that Whitman also played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=21}}
McCartney wrote his first song, "[[I Lost My Little Girl]]", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become "[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]" on the piano. Against his father's advice, he took very few piano lessons, preferring to learn [[Learning music by ear|by ear]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=22<U+2013>23}} He was heavily influenced by American [[rhythm and blues]] music, and [[Little Richard]] was his schoolboy idol.

At the age of fifteen, McCartney met Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall f<U+00EA>te in [[Woolton]] on 6&nbsp;July 1957.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=93}} The Quarrymen played an even mix of rock and roll and [[skiffle]], a type of [[popular music]] with [[jazz]], [[blues music|blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] influences.<ref>{{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=95}}: "The Quarrymen played a spirited set of songs<U+2014>half skiffle, half rock 'n roll".</ref> The group invited McCartney to join soon afterwards as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon.

The McCartney composition "[[Yesterday (song)|Yesterday]]", featuring a [[string quartet]], was released in 1965. Included on the ''[[Help! (album)|Help!]]'' LP, the song was the group's first recorded use of [[classical music]] elements and their first recording that involved only a single group member.<ref>{{harvnb|Buk|1996|p=51}}: Their first recording that involved only a single group member; {{harvnb|Gould|2007|p=278}}: The group's first recorded use of classical music elements in their music.</ref> "Yesterday" became the most covered song in popular music history.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=157<U+2013>158}}: "Yesterday" as the most covered song in history.</ref> Later that year, during recording sessions for the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the group.

In 1966, they released the album ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]''.

McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=845}} Of his first two post-Beatles tours, McCartney said, "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.'

== Musicianship ==
As a musician, McCartney is largely self-taught. [[Musicology|Musicologist]] [[Ian MacDonald]] described his approach as "by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored&nbsp;... [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... [A] natural melodist<U+2014>a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=12}}: Natural melodist, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=13}}: Perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears.</ref> McCartney commented, "I prefer to think of my approach to music as&nbsp;... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training."{{sfn|Benitez|2010|p=134}}

=== Bass guitar ===
McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other [[bassist]]s, including [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Dr. Dre]] bassist [[Mike Elizondo]], and [[Colin Moulding]] of [[XTC]].{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=8}} McCartney is known to play using a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] almost exclusively, only occasionally changing to fingerstyle.{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=28}} He does not use [[Slapping|slapping or muting]] techniques.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He was strongly influenced by [[Motown]], in particular by [[James Jamerson]], whom McCartney called a hero for his [[Melody|melodic]] style. He was also influenced by [[Brian Wilson]] "because he went to very unusual places".{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=38<U+2013>39}} Another favourite bassist is [[Stanley Clarke]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=18}}: The influence of Motown and James Jamerson, {{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=22}}: Stanley Clarke.</ref>

{{quote box|quote= "Paul is one of the most innovative bass players ... half the stuff that's going on now is directly ripped off from his Beatles period ... He's an egomaniac about everything else, but his bass playing he'd always been a bit coy about."{{sfn|Sheff|Golson|1981|p=142}} |source= ~ Lennon, ''Playboy'' magazine, January 1981|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

During McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a [[H<U+00F6>fner 500/1]] bass, though in 1965 he began sporadically using a [[Rickenbacker 4001]]S for recording. While typically using [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox amplifiers]], by 1967 he had also begun using a [[Fender Bassman]] for amplification.<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=16<U+2013>17}}: H<U+00F6>fner 500/1, {{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=44<U+2013>45}}: Rickenbacker 4001, {{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=85<U+2013>86, 92<U+2013>93, 103, 116, 134, 140, 173, 175, 187, 211}}: Vox amplifiers; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=298}}: Fender Bassman.</ref> During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a [[Wal (bass)|Wal 5-String]], which he said made him play more thick-sounding [[bassline]]s, in contrast to the much lighter H<U+00F6>fner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He changed back to the H<U+00F6>fner around 1990 for that reason.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He uses [[Mesa Boogie#Bass amps|Mesa Boogie]] bass amplifiers while performing live.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=19}}

MacDonald identified "[[She's a Woman]]" as the point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out ''Rubber Soul'' as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on "[[The Word (song)|The Word]]".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=133<U+2013>134}}: "She's a Woman"; {{harvnb|Ingham|2009|p=299}}: "began to come into its own".</ref> Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's [[Groove (music)|groove]] on the track "a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument."<ref>{{harvnb|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=10, 44}}: ''Rubber Soul'' as the starting point for McCartney's bass improvement, {{harvnb|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=98}}: "a high point in pop bass playing".</ref> MacDonald inferred the influence of [[James Brown]]'s "[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]" and Pickett's "[[In the Midnight Hour]]", American [[Soul music|soul]] tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he "delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=178<U+2013>180}}

Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]" as "an astonishing piece of playing&nbsp;... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass'&nbsp;... [choosing] the area of the neck&nbsp;... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove."{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=112<U+2013>113}} MacDonald considered the track the Beatles' best [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], stating that its "clangorously saturated texture resonates around McCartney's [bassline]", which MacDonald described as "so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track". MacDonald also indicated the influence of [[Indian classical music]] in "exotic [[melisma]]s in the bass part".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=196<U+2013>198}}: "Rain".</ref> McCartney identified ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]".{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=45<U+2013>46}}

=== Acoustic guitar ===
{{quote box|quote= "If I couldn't have any other instrument, I would have to have an acoustic guitar."{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} |source= ~ McCartney, ''Guitar Player'', July 1990|width=22%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

McCartney primarily [[Flatpicking|flatpicks]] while playing [[acoustic guitar]], though he also uses elements of [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]].{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include "Yesterday", "I'm Looking Through You", "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]", "[[Blackbird (song)|Blackbird]]", "[[I Will (The Beatles song)|I Will]]", "[[Mother Nature's Son]]" and "[[Rocky Raccoon]]".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=157<U+2013>158}}: "Yesterday", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=174<U+2013>175}}: "I'm Looking Through You", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=175<U+2013>176}}: "Michelle", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=291<U+2013>292}}: "Blackbird", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=305<U+2013>306}}: "Mother Nature's Son", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=308}}: "Rocky Raccoon", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=315}}: "I Will".</ref> McCartney singled out "Blackbird" as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: "I got my own little sort of cheating way of [fingerpicking] ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time&nbsp;... I was trying to emulate those [[Folk music|folk]] players."{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} He employed a similar technique for "[[Jenny Wren]]".{{sfn|Molenda|2005|p=79}} He played an [[Epiphone Texan]] on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a [[D-28 guitar#Models|Martin D-28]].<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=146<U+2013>147, 152, 161, 164}}: Epiphone Texan; {{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=215, 218, 222, 239}}: Martin D-28.</ref>

=== Electric guitar ===
{{quote box|quote= "Linda was a big fan of my guitar playing, whereas I've got my doubts. I think there are proper guitar players and then there are guys like me who love playing it".{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=23}} |source= ~ McCartney, ''Guitar Player'', July 1990|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

McCartney played [[Lead guitar|lead]] [[electric guitar]] on several Beatles recordings, including what MacDonald described as a "fiercely angular slide guitar solo" on "[[Drive My Car]]", which McCartney played on an [[Epiphone Casino]]. McCartney said of the instrument, "if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this."<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|p=149}}: "If I had to pick one electric guitar"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=166<U+2013>167}}: "Drive My Car", "fiercely angular slide guitar solo".</ref> He contributed what MacDonald described as "a startling guitar solo" on the Harrison composition "[[Taxman]]" and the "shrieking" guitar on "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]". MacDonald also praised McCartney's "coruscating pseudo-Indian" guitar solo on "[[Good Morning Good Morning]]".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=200<U+2013>201}}: "Taxman", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=232<U+2013>234}}: "Sgt.

It was really my first voyage into [[Audio feedback#Deliberate uses|feedback]]."{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were, he included [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[Eric Clapton]] and David Gilmour, stating, "but I still like Hendrix the best."{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} He has primarily used a [[Gibson Les Paul]] for electric work, particularly while performing live.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=19}}

=== Vocals ===
McCartney's vocals cross several [[Music genre|musical genres]]. For example, on "[[Call Me Back Again]]", according to Benitez, "McCartney shines as a [[blues]]y solo vocalist" while MacDonald called "[[I'm Down]]" "a [[Rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] classic" that "illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility".<ref>{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=68}}: "Call Me Back Again"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=156}}: "I'm Down".</ref> MacDonald described "Helter Skelter" as an early attempt at [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and "Hey Jude" as a "[[Pop music|pop]]/rock hybrid", pointing out McCartney's "use of [[Gospel music|gospel]]-style [[melisma]]s" in the song and his "pseudo-[[Soul music|soul]] shrieking in the fade-out".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=297<U+2013>298}}: "Helter Skelter", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=302<U+2013>304}}: "Hey Jude".</ref> Benitez identified "[[Hope of Deliverance]]" and "[[Put It There]]" as examples of McCartney's folk music efforts while musicologist [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] considered "[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]" and "[[Honey Pie]]" attempts at [[vaudeville]].<ref>{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=128}}: "Put It There", {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=138}}: "Hope of Deliverance"; {{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=112<U+2013>113}}: "When I'm Sixty-Four", {{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=189<U+2013>190}}: "Honey Pie".</ref> MacDonald praised the "[[Swing music|swinging]] beat" of the Beatles' [[Twelve-bar blues|twenty-four bar blues]] song, "She's a Woman" as "the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date", with McCartney's voice "at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment."{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=133<U+2013>134}} MacDonald described "[[I've Got a Feeling]]" as a "raunchy, mid-tempo rocker" with a "robust and soulful" vocal performance" and "Back in the U.S.S.R." as "the last of [the Beatles'] up-tempo rockers", McCartney's "[[Belting (music)|belting]]" vocals among his best since "Drive My Car", recorded three years earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=309<U+2013>310}}: "Back in the U.S.S.R"., {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=332}}: "I've Got a Feeling", a "raunchy, mid-tempo rocker" with a "robust and soulful" performance.</ref>

=== Tape loops ===
In the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]]'s flat in London, McCartney brought [[Magnetic tape|tapes]] he had compiled at then-girlfriend [[Jane Asher]]'s home. They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that [[Dick James]] made into a [[Demo (music)|demo]] for him.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=217<U+2013>218}} Heavily influenced by American [[avant-garde]] musician [[John Cage]], McCartney made [[tape loops]] by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a [[Brenell Engineering Ltd.|Brenell]] [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape recorder]] and splicing the various loops. He referred to the finished product as "electronic symphonies".{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=219<U+2013>220}} He reversed the tapes, and speeded them up and slowed them down to create the effects he wanted, some of which were later used on the Beatles song "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]".

Pepper'' cover, McCartney replied, "Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the King."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=727}} McCartney stated that his bassline for "[[I Saw Her Standing There]]" was taken directly from Berry's "[[I'm Talking About You]]".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=66<U+2013>67}}: "According to McCartney, the bassline was taken from&nbsp;"...I'm Talking About You"; {{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=18}}: McCartney: "I'm not gonna tell you I wrote the thing when Chuck Berry's bass player did; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=94}}: McCartney: "I played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly".</ref>

McCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose [[falsetto]] [[Vocal music|vocalizations]] inspired McCartney's own vocal technique.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=33}} McCartney said he wrote "I'm Down" as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=156}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=201}}: (primary source).</ref> In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual "Buddy Holly Week" in England.

While at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top academic accolades for his visual work. His lack of discipline prevented him from achieving the results necessary to earn admission to art college.{{sfn|Carlin|2009|pp=44<U+2013>45}} During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London [[avant-garde]] scene was through artist [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]], who introduced McCartney to art dealer [[Robert Fraser (art dealer)|Robert Fraser]].{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=307}} At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation, and during visits to Fraser's home, McCartney met [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=243}} McCartney later purchased works by [[Magritte]], using his painting of an apple for the [[Apple Records]] logo.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=256<U+2013>267}} McCartney was involved in the renovation and publicising of the [[Indica Gallery]] in Mason's Yard, London<U+2014>where Lennon first met [[Yoko Ono]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=549<U+2013>550}} McCartney's involvement with the gallery brought him into contact with [[Barry Miles]], whose underground newspaper, the ''[[International Times]]'', McCartney helped to start.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=232}} Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, ''[[Many Years From Now]]'' (1997).{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=549<U+2013>550}}

McCartney became interested in painting after watching artist [[Willem de Kooning]] work in de Kooning's [[Long Island]] studio.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=84}} McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in [[Siegen]], Germany, in 1999.

When McCartney was a child, his mother read him poems and encouraged him to read books; his father was interested in [[crosswords]] and invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve them with him, so as to increase their "word power", as McCartney said.<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=12}}: "word power" (primary source); {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=82}}: "word power" (secondary source).</ref> In 2001, McCartney published ''Blackbird Singing'', a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City.<ref name="FaberandFaber">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/mar/17/poetry.music |title=Roll over, Andrew Motion|date=14 October 2006 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=13 July 2009 | first=Michael | last=Horovitz}}</ref> In the foreword of the book, he explains: "When I was a teenager&nbsp;...

McCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' [[Hamburg]] days, when they often used [[Preludin]] to maintain their energy while performing for long periods.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66<U+2013>67}} [[Bob Dylan]] introduced them to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting "very high" and "giggling uncontrollably".{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=186<U+2013>189}} His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, the lyrics "another kind of mind" in "[[Got to Get You into My Life]]" were written specifically as a reference to cannabis.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=182}}: Habitual marijuana use by McCartney and the Beatles; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=190}}: Marijuana references in Beatles songs.</ref> During the filming of ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', McCartney occasionally smoked a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=67<U+2013>68}} Director [[Richard Lester]] overheard two physically attractive women trying to cajole McCartney into using [[heroin]], but he refused.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=67<U+2013>68}} He was introduced to [[cocaine]] by Robert Fraser, and it was readily available during the recording of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=247}} McCartney used the drug for about a year but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=384<U+2013>385}}

Initially reluctant to try [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second "[[Psychedelic experience|acid trip]]" in March 1967, with Lennon, after a ''Sgt. Pepper'' studio session.<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=379<U+2013>380}}: First LSD "trip", {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=382}}: Second LSD "trip".</ref> He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, "It opened my eyes... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society."{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=228}} He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in ''The Times'', which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=386<U+2013>387}}

In 1972, McCartney was fined <U+00A3>1,000 by a Swedish court for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for [[Cannabis cultivation|illegal cultivation]] and a <U+00A3>100 fine. Due to his drug convictions, he was repeatedly denied a US visa until December 1973.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=300<U+2013>307}}: Drugs.</ref> He was again arrested for marijuana possession in 1975 in Los Angeles. Linda took the blame, and the charges were soon dismissed. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8&nbsp;ounces (200&nbsp;g) of cannabis in his luggage, and he was arrested and taken to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, he was released without charge and deported.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=459<U+2013>461}} In 1984, while on holiday in [[Barbados]], he was arrested for possession of marijuana and fined $200.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=300<U+2013>307}} Upon his return to England, he stated that "cannabis is ... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal&nbsp;... I don't think&nbsp;... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=306}} In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: "People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=307}}

=== Activism ===
Paul and Linda were [[vegetarians]] for most of their 30-year marriage. They decided to stop eating meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were having a meal of lamb. Soon after, the couple became outspoken [[animal rights]] activists.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=880<U+2013>882}} In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999 he spent <U+00A3>3,000,000 to ensure [[Linda McCartney Foods]] remained free of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] ingredients.<ref>For McCartney's pledge to continue Linda's animal rights work see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/145974.stm |title=McCartney vows to keep animal rights torch alight |publisher=BBC News |date=5 August 1998 |accessdate=29 January 2007}}; For McCartney ensuring that Linda McCartney Foods remained GMO free, see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/365947.stm |title=GM-free ingredients |publisher=BBC News |date=10 June 1999 | accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref>

McCartney first met British actress [[Jane Asher]] on 18 April 1963, when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=101<U+2013>102}} The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street, London.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=439}} They lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to McCartney's own home in [[St. John's Wood]], in March 1966.<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=104<U+2013>107}}: Living at the Asher home, 254: McCartney's move to his home in St. John's Wood.</ref> He wrote several songs while at the Ashers', including "Yesterday", and several of them were inspired by Asher, among them "[[And I Love Her]]", "[[You Won't See Me]]" and "[[I'm Looking Through You]]".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=108}} They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered he had become involved with [[Francie Schwartz]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=27<U+2013>32}}: Jane Asher, {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=777<U+2013>778}}: Francie Schwartz.</ref>

[[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] was a music fan who once commented, "all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio." At times, she skipped school to see artists such as [[Fabian (entertainer)|Fabian]], [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=585}} She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast and I found it was Paul I liked."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=587}} The pair first properly met in 1967 at a [[Georgie Fame]] concert at [[The Bag O'Nails]] club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to&nbsp;... Pushiness worked for me that night!"<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=45}}: Paul and Linda's first meeting, {{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=587}}: "Pushiness worked for me that night!"; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=432<U+2013>434}}: Linda's UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London.</ref> Linda said this about their meeting: "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night]&nbsp;... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=587}} The pair were married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, "We had a lot of fun together&nbsp;... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment."{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=514<U+2013>515}} He added, "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married and it was nearly called off&nbsp;... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did."{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=525}}

The two collaborated musically after the Beatles' break-up, forming Wings in 1971.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=904<U+2013>910}} They faced derision from some fans and critics, who questioned her inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul, who explained, "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy."{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} Paul defended her musical ability: "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard&nbsp;... She took a couple lessons and learned some bluesy things&nbsp;... she did very well and made it look easier than it was&nbsp;... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her<U+2014>she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a [[Minimoog]], which could only be played with one finger. It was [[Monophonic synthesizer|monophonic]]."{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} He went on to say, "We thought we were in it for the fun&nbsp;... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong <U+2013> big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves."{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=84}}

They had four children<U+2014>Linda's daughter [[Heather McCartney|Heather]] (legally adopted by Paul), [[Mary McCartney|Mary]], [[Stella McCartney|Stella]] and [[James McCartney|James]]<U+2014>and remained married until Linda's death from breast cancer in 1998.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=585<U+2013>601}} After her death, Paul stated in ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]'', "I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [about wishing I'd been] perfect all the time&nbsp;... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies."{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=600<U+2013>601}}

==== Heather Mills ====
In 2002, McCartney married [[Heather Mills]], a former model and anti-[[land mine|landmines]] campaigner.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=568<U+2013>578}} In 2003, the couple had a child, Beatrice Milly, who was named in honour of Mills' late mother, and one of McCartney's aunts.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=523}} They separated in April 2006, and divorced acrimoniously in March 2008.<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2010|p=532}}: Separation, {{harvnb|Sounes|2010|p=546}}: Divorce.</ref> In 2004 he commented on media animosity toward his partners: "[the British public] didn't like me giving up on Jane Asher"&nbsp;... "I married [Linda], a New York divorcee with a child, and at the time they didn't like that".<ref name="MaccaSMH">{{cite news| url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/11/1086749891275.html | title = McCartney's lament: I can't buy your love | newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald | date = 12 June 2004}}</ref>

{{other uses-section|social and other general interactions|creative collaborations|Collaborations between ex-Beatles}}

==== John Lennon ====
McCartney had a strained relationship with [[John Lennon|Lennon]]; they briefly became close again in 1974, and [[A Toot and a Snore in '74|played music together]] on two occasions, the only times since the Beatles' break-up in 1970.{{sfn|Sandford|2006|pp=227<U+2013>229}} In later years, the two grew apart.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=587}} While McCartney would often phone, he was apprehensive about the reception he would receive, as during one call when he was told, "You're all pizza and fairytales!"{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=588}} In an effort to avoid talking only about business, they often spoke of cats, babies or baking bread.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=590}}

On 24 April 1976, the two were watching an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' together at Lennon's home in New York City, during which [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the ''SNL'' studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=504<U+2013>505}}: On 24 April 1976, the two were watching ''Saturday Night Live'', last time Lennon and McCartney spent time together; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=592}}: Lennon: "We nearly got a cab, but we were actually too tired".</ref> This event was fictionalised in the 2000 television film ''[[Two of Us (2000 television)|Two of Us]]''.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=869<U+2013>870}} His last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', was friendly; he said this about the call: "[It is] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't have any kind of blow-up."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Joan|title=Playboy Interview: Paul and Linda McCartney|journal=Playboy|volume=31, no. 12|issue=December 1984|pages=82}}</ref>

===== Reaction to Lennon's murder =====
{{main|Death of John Lennon}}

{{quote box|quote= "John is kinda like a constant&nbsp;... always there in my being&nbsp;... in my soul, so I always think of him".<ref>{{harvnb|Graff|2000|p=40}}: "John is kinda like a constant&nbsp;... always there in my being",  {{harvnb|Graff|2000|p=96}}: "in my soul, so I always think of him".</ref> |source= ~ McCartney, ''Guitar World'', January 2000 |width=18%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

On 9 December 1980, McCartney awoke to the news that Lennon had been [[Death of John Lennon|murdered]] the previous night, his death creating a [[Media circus|media frenzy]] around the surviving members of the band.{{sfn|Carlin|2009|pp=255<U+2013>257}} That evening, as he was leaving an [[Oxford Street]] recording studio, he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for a reaction. He responded "It's a drag", and was criticised for what appeared to be a superficial response.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He later explained, "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon:

<blockquote>
I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed and the first thing she said was, "John was really fond of you." The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, "it's only me." They were like a wall, you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}}
</blockquote>

In 1983, McCartney said, "I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his "mask" and have a better relationship with him."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he admitted the ex-Beatles were nervous at the time that they might also be murdered.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=594}} He told ''Mojo'' magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=506}} In June 1981, six months after the murder, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, "[[All Those Years Ago]]", which featured Starr on drums.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=20}} McCartney released "[[Here Today (Paul McCartney song)|Here Today]]" in 1982, a song Everett describes as "a haunting tribute" to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=10}}

==== George Harrison ====
Discussing his relationship with McCartney, [[George Harrison|Harrison]] said, "Paul would always help along when you'd done his ten songs<U+2014>then when he got 'round to doing one of my songs, he would help. It was silly. It was very selfish, actually&nbsp;... There were a lot of tracks, though, where I played bass&nbsp;... because what Paul would do<U+2014>if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): "Do this". He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glazer|first=Mitchell|title=Growing Up at 33<U+2153>: The George Harrison Interview|journal=Crawdaddy|issue=February 1977|pages=35<U+2013>36}}</ref>

After Harrison's death in November 2001, McCartney issued a statement outside his home in St. John's Wood, calling him "a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a wonderful sense of humour". He went on to say, "We grew up together and we just had so many beautiful times together&nbsp;<U+2013> that's what I am going to remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html |title=I'll always love him, he's my baby brother, says tearful McCartney|work=The Telegraph|last1=Poole|first1=Oliver|last2=Davies|first2=Hugh|date=1 December 2001|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> On the first anniversary of his death, McCartney played Harrison's "[[Something]]" on a [[ukulele]] at the [[Concert for George]].{{sfn|Doggett|2009|pp=332<U+2013>333}} He also performed "[[For You Blue]]" and "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]", and played the piano on [[Eric Clapton]]'s rendition of "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]".{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=138<U+2013>139}}

==== Ringo Starr ====
[[Ringo Starr|Starr]] once described McCartney as "pleasantly insincere", though the two generally enjoy each other's company, and at least once went on holiday together in Greece.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=815}} Starr recalled, "We couldn't understand a word of the songs the hotel band were playing, so on the last night Paul and I did a few rockers like "[[What'd I Say]]".{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=815}} There was at times discord between them as well, particularly during sessions for ''the White Album''. As Apple's [[Peter Brown (music industry)|Peter Brown]] recalled, "it was a poorly kept secret among Beatle intimates that after Ringo left the studio Paul would often dub in the drum tracks himself&nbsp;... [Starr] would pretend not to notice".{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=289}} In August 1968, the two got into an argument over McCartney's critique of Starr's drum part for "Back in the U.S.S.R.", which contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=816}}; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=495}}: "Paul ticked Ringo off over a fluffed tom-tom fill. They had already argued about how the drum part should be played&nbsp;... and Paul's criticisms finally brought matters to a head"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=310}}: "The ill-feeling&nbsp;... finally erupted&nbsp;... after an argument with McCartney over the drum part".</ref> He returned in September to find bouquets of flowers on his drum kit.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=296}} Starr commented on working with McCartney: "Paul is the greatest bass player in the world. But he is also very determined&nbsp;... [to] get his own way&nbsp;... [thus] musical disagreements inevitably arose from time to time."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=816}}

McCartney and Starr collaborated on several post-Beatles projects starting in 1973, when McCartney contributed instrumentation and [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] for "Six O'Clock", a song McCartney wrote for Starr's album ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]''. McCartney played a [[kazoo]] solo on another track from the album ''[[You're Sixteen]]''. In 1976, McCartney sang backing vocals on another song he wrote for Starr, "Pure Gold", from ''[[Ringo's Rotogravure]]''. In 1981, McCartney produced and performed on three songs from Starr's ''[[Stop and Smell the Roses]]'', two of which McCartney composed. Starr played drums and sang backing vocals on a song from McCartney's 1997 album, ''Flaming Pie''. The pair collaborated again in 1998, on Starr's ''[[Vertical Man]]'', which featured McCartney's backing vocals on three songs, and instrumentation on one.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|pp=279<U+2013>281}} In 2009, the pair performed "[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]" at a benefit concert for the [[David Lynch Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2009-04-05-paul-ringo_N.htm|title=McCartney, Starr reunite for Lynch Foundation benefit|date=6 April 2009|last=Gardner|first=Elysa|work=USA Today|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> They collaborated on Starr's album, ''[[Y Not]]'', in 2010.
