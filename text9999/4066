The '''Orange-headed Thrush''' (''Zoothera citrina'') is a [[bird]] in the [[thrush (bird)|thrush]] family.

It is common in well-wooded areas of [[India]], [[China]] and southeast [[Asia]].  Most populations are resident. The species shows a preference for shady damp areas, and like many ''[[Asian thrush|Zoothera]]'' thrushes, can be quite secretive.

The Orange-headed Thrush is [[omnivore|omnivorous]], eating a wide range of [[insect]]s, [[earthworm]]s and fruit. It nests in trees but does not form flocks.

The male of this small thrush has uniform grey upperparts, and a orange head and underparts. The females and young birds have browner upper parts.
==Taxonomy==
This species was first described by [[John Latham]] in 1790 as ''Turdus citrinus'', the species name meaning "citrine" and referencing the colour of the head and underparts.<ref name= Latham>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last =Latham | first = John | coauthors= |title = Index Ornithologicus, sive Systema Ornithologi<U+00E6>; complectens avium divisionem in classes, ordines, genera, species, ipsarumque varietates: adjectis synonymis, locis, descriptionibus, &c.| year = 1790 | publisher = London: Leigh & Sotheby. | isbn = | pages = volume 1, 350}}</ref> It has about 12 subspecies.<ref name= Clement >{{cite book |title=Thrushes (Helm Identification Guides)  |last= Clement |first= Peter |coauthors= Hathway, Ren;  Wilczur, Jan |publisher=Christopher Helm Publishers Ltd|year=2000 |id= ISBN | pages =229&ndash;232| isbn = 0-7136-3940-7}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Corbett View.jpg|Moist evergreen forest|thumb|left]]
The Orange-headed Thrush breeds from north [[Pakistan]] east through India and [[Sri Lanka]] to southern China, and through Southeast Asia to [[Java]].<ref name= Clement/> Its habitat is moist broadleaved evergreen woodlands, with a medium-density undergrowth of bushes and [[fern]]s, but it also utilises [[bamboo]] forests and secondary growth. ''Z. c. cyanotus'' also occurs in large  gardens and orchards.<ref name= Clement/>

This species is often found  in damp areas, near streams or in shady ravines. It occurs between 250&ndash;1830&nbsp;metres (825&ndash; 6040&nbsp;ft) in the Himalayas and up to about 1500&nbsp;metres (5000&nbsp;ft) in Malaysia, Thailand and Java. ''Z. c. aurata'' is resident between 1000&ndash;1630&nbsp;metres (3300&ndash;5400&nbsp;ft) on Mt Kinabalu and Mt Trus Madi, northern Borneo. Some of the subspecies are completely or partially migratory; their wintering habitat is similar to the breeding forests, but more likely to be at lower altitudes.<ref name = Clement/><ref name= Robson/>

==Description==
[[Image:ThrushWing.jpg|thumb|Underwing of ''Z. c. cyanotus'']]
The Orange-headed Thrush is 205&ndash;235&nbsp;milliimetres (8.1&ndash;9.25&nbsp;in) long<ref name= Robson/> and weighs 47&ndash;60&nbsp;grammes (1.7&ndash;2.1&nbsp;oz). The adult male of the nominate subspecies of this small thrush has an entirely orange head and underparts, uniformly grey upperparts and wings, and white median and undertail coverts. It has a slate-coloured bill and the legs and feet have brown fronts and pink or yellowish rears.<ref name= Clement/>

The female resembles the male but has browner or more olive upperparts and wram brown wings, but some old females are almost identical to the male. The juvenile is dull brown with buff streaks on its back, and a rufous tone  to the head and face; it has grey wings. The bill is brownish horn, and the legs and feet are brown. 

This species' orange and grey plumage is very distinctive, and it is is unlikely to be confused with any other species. Differences between the subspecies, as described above, can be quite striking, as with the strong head pattern on ''Z. c. cyanotus'', but may be less obvious variations in plumage tone, or whether there is white on the folded wing. As with other ''Zoothera'' thrushes, all forms of this species shows a distinctive underwing pattern, with a strong white band.<ref name= Clement/>

===Voice===
Calls of the Orange-headed Thrush include a soft ''chuk''  or ''tchuk'', a screeching ''teer-teer-teer'', and a thin ''tsee'' or ''dzef'' given  in flight. However, this bird is generally silent especially in winter. The song is a loud clear series of variably sweet lilting musical notes, recalling the quality of the [[Blackbird]], but with the more repetitive structure of the [[Song Thrush]]. It also includes imitations of other birds like [[bulbul]]s, [[Old World babbler|babbler]]s and [[Common Tailorbird]]. It sings from a perch in a leafy tree, mostly early morning and late afternoon.<ref name = Clement/> [[Image:Zoothera_citrina_cyanotus.ogg|thumb|Song of ''Z. c. cyanotus'']]

==Behaviour==
[[Image:Orange-headed Thrush (Zoothera citrina) in Kolkata I IMG 3224.jpg|thumb| Nominate subspecies in  [[Kolkata]]]]
The Orange-headed Thrush is a shy, secretive bird usually occurring alone or in pairs, but is comparatively more easily seen than many other ''Zoothera'' thrushes, and several birds may congregate outside the breeding season  at a good food source. It has a swift, silent flight, but when disturbed will often sit motionless until the threat has passed.<ref name= Clement/> 
===Breeding===
The nest, built by both sexes, is a wide but shallow cup of twigs, bracken and rootlets lined with softer plant material like leaves, moss and [[conifer]] needles. It is constructed at a height of up to 4.5&nbsp;metres (15&nbsp;ft)  in a small tree or bush, with [[mango]] trees and [[coffee]] bushes  being preferred. Three or four, occasionally five, eggs are laid; they are cream or tinted with pale blue, grey or green, and have pale lilac blotches and reddish brown spots. They are incubated for 13-14 days to hatching, with another 12 days until the young birds leave the nest.<ref name= Clement/> 

[[image:Clamator_jacobinus.jpg|[[Pied Cuckoo]], a [[brood parasite]]|thumb]]This species is a host of the [[Pied Cuckoo]], ''Clamator jacobinus'', a [[brood parasite]] which lay a single egg in the nest.<ref name= Clement/> Unlike the [[Common Cuckoo]], neither the hen nor the hatched chick evict the host's eggs, but the host<U+2019>s young often die because they cannot compete successfully with the [[cuckoo]] for food.<ref name= Barlow>{{cite book |title=A Field Guide to birds of The Gambia and Senegal |last= Barlow |first=Clive |coauthors= Wacher, Tim; Disley, Tony |location=Robertsbridge |publisher=Pica Press|year=1997 |isbn= 1-873403-32-1 |pages = 229}}</ref> The [[Chestnut-winged Cuckoo]], ''Clamator coromandus'', and, very rarely, the [[Common Cuckoo]], ''Cuculus canorus'' have also beeen claimed as parasites on this species.<ref name = Lowther >{{cite web|title= Host list of avian brood parasites - 2 - Cuculiformes; Cuculidae |work= |url= http://fm1.fieldmuseum.org/aa/Files/lowther/OWcList.pdf|publisher= Field Museum |accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref>

===Feeding===
The Orange-headed Thrush feeds on the ground in dense undergrowth or other thick cover. It is most active at dawn and dusk, probing the leaf litter for insect and their larvae, spiders, other [[invertebrate]]s and fruit. In Malaysia, wintering birds regularly feed on figs.<ref name= Clement/>

==Status==
The Orange-headed Thrush has an extensive range, estimated at 1&ndash;10&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometres (0.4&ndash;3.8&nbsp;million sq mi), The population size has not been quantified, but it is believed to be large as the species is described as <U+201C>frequent<U+201D> in at least parts of its range. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as [[Least Concern]].<ref name =iucn/>

It is very popular as cage-bird on Java, and numbers have severely declined in recent years owing to trapping for [[aviculture]].<ref name = Clement/> Against the trend  in Southeast Asia where loss or fragmentation of woodland poses a threat to forest birds, the Orange-headed Thrush has colonized Hong Kong, where it was first recorded in 1956,  thanks to forest maturation. <ref name= Leven>{{cite journal ||last=Leven |first= Michael R.|coauthors= Corlett, Richard T. |month= |year=2004 |title= Invasive birds in Hong Kong, China |journal= Ornithological Science |volume= 3 |issue= |pages=43&ndash;55 | }}</ref>
