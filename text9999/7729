The province extends from the mountains of the [[Annamite Range]] in the north, across a hilly plateau between the [[Tonle San]] and [[Tonle Srepok]] rivers, to tropical [[deciduous forests]] in the south. In recent years, logging and mining have scarred Ratanakiri's environment, long known for its beauty.

For over a millennium, Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland [[Khmer Loeu]], who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia. During the region's early history, its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as slaves by neighboring empires. The slave trade economy ended during the [[Colonial Cambodia|French colonial era]], but a harsh [[Khmer people|Khmerization]] campaign after Cambodia's independence again threatened Khmer Loeu ways of life.  The [[Khmer Rouge]] built its headquarters in the province in the 1960s, and bombing during the [[Vietnam War]] devastated the region. Today, rapid development in the province is altering traditional ways of life.

Ratanakiri is sparsely populated; its 150,000 residents make up just over 1% of the country's total population. Residents generally live in villages of 20 to 60 families and engage in subsistence [[shifting cultivation|shifting agriculture]]. Ratanakiri is among the least developed provinces of Cambodia. Its infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak. Health indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor, and almost one in four children die before reaching the age of five. Education levels are also low; three quarters of the population is illiterate.

==History==
Present-day Ratanakiri has been occupied since at least the [[stone age|stone]] or [[bronze age]], and trade between the region's highlanders and towns along the [[Gulf of Thailand]] dates to at least the 4th century A.D.<ref>"Settlement and agriculture in and adjacent to Virachey National Park", p. 5; Stark, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6kDm5d3cMIYC&pg=PT120&sig=DLzoOFPaihOMucJ_xRJ3f0p_fy0 p. 96].</ref> The region was invaded by [[History of Vietnam|Annamites]], the [[Champa|Cham]], the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]], and the [[History of Thailand|Thai]] during its early history, but no empire ever brought the area under centralized control.<ref name=adbhistory/> From the 13th century or earlier until the 19th century, highland villages were often raided by [[History of slavery#Southeast Asia|Khmer, Lao, and Thai slave traders]].<ref>''Indigenous Peoples: Ethnic Minorities and Poverty Reduction'', pp. 6<U+2013>7; "Settlement and agriculture in and adjacent to Virachey National Park", p. 5.</ref> The region was conquered by local [[Laos|Laotian]] rulers in the 18th century and then by the Thai in the 19th century.<ref name=boundary>"International Boundary Study No. 32", p. 4.</ref> The area was incorporated into [[French Indochina]] in 1893, and colonial rule replaced slave trading.<ref name=vnp>"Settlement and agriculture in and adjacent to Virachey National Park", p. 5.</ref>  The French built huge rubber plantations, especially in Labansiek (present-day [[Banlung]]); indigenous workers were used for construction and rubber harvesting.<ref name=adbhistory/> While under French control, the land comprising present-day Ratanakiri was transferred from Siam ([[Thailand]]) to Laos and then to Cambodia.<ref>"International Boundary Study No. 32", p. 4; Stuart-Fox, [http://books.google.com/books?id=8VvvevRkX-EC&pg=PA27&sig=8jzE879OU9KkfPhgJ-0GrTp1PrU p. 27].</ref> Although highland groups initially resisted their colonial rulers, by the end of the colonial era in 1953 they had been subdued.<ref name=vnp/>

The geography of Ratanakiri Province is diverse, encompassing rolling hills, mountains, plateaus, lowland [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s, and [[crater lake]]s.<ref>"Welcome to Ratnakiri".</ref> Two major rivers, [[Tonle San]] and [[Tonle Srepok]], flow from east to west across the province.

Government in Ratanakiri is weak, largely due to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance.<ref>Sith Samath et al., [http://books.google.com/books?id=zvf_BS4zv_AC&pg=PA349&sig=2vl2IZgm_HkXcK_K7E5YCybx4Fo pp. 349], [http://books.google.com/books?id=zvf_BS4zv_AC&pg=PA356&sig=5XXwA2v49AEiJfeZtnoq2RzyOD8 356]; Suzuki, pp. 12<U+2013>13.</ref> The provincial legal framework is poor, and the rule of law is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia.<ref name=samath356>Sith Samath et al., [http://books.google.com/books?id=zvf_BS4zv_AC&pg=PA349&sig=2vl2IZgm_HkXcK_K7E5YCybx4Fo pp. 349], [http://books.google.com/books?id=zvf_BS4zv_AC&pg=PA356&sig=5XXwA2v49AEiJfeZtnoq2RzyOD8 356].</ref> Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province.<ref name=samath351>Sith Samath et al., [http://books.google.com/books?id=zvf_BS4zv_AC&pg=PA351&sig=DIqmEYMoBLicrbrnsDvYJUwKQ3c p. 351].</ref> The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from [[Non-governmental organizations in Ratanakiri Province|NGOs in the region]].<ref name=suzuki13>Sith Samath et al., [http://books.google.com/books?id=zvf_BS4zv_AC&pg=PA351&sig=DIqmEYMoBLicrbrnsDvYJUwKQ3c p. 351]; Suzuki, p. 13.</ref>

Village government in Ratanakiri has both traditional and administrative components. Traditional forms of government, namely village [[Elder (society)|elders]] and other indigenous institutions, are dominant.<ref name=brown11>Brown, Graeme, p. 11.</ref> Members of each village designate one or more community elders to manage village affairs, mediate conflicts, and ensure that villagers follow customary laws, particularly about land and resource use.<ref>Brown, Graeme, pp. 9<U+2013>11.</ref> Elders do not play an autocratic role, and are instead primarily respected advisors and consensus builders.<ref name=brown10>Brown, Graeme, p. 10.</ref> Village elders are generally male, but women also play a role in the management of the community and its resources.<ref name=brown12>Brown, Graeme, p. 12.</ref>  A village may also have a village chief, i.e., a local government person who is appointed by a higher governmental official.<ref name=brown11/> The village chief serves as a liaison between the village and outside government officials, but lacks traditional authority.<ref name=brown11/> The role of the village chief in village governance may be poorly defined; in one Kreung village, residents told a researcher that they were "very unclear exactly what the work of the village chief entailed."<ref name=brown11/>

[[Image:Banlung market (1).jpg|Market in Banlung|thumb|alt=Outdoor market stalls on red earth, with makeshift cloth roofs]]
Most of the indigenous residents of Ratanakiri are [[subsistence farmers]], practicing [[slash and burn]] [[shifting cultivation]]. (See [[#Culture|Culture]] below for more information on traditional subsistence practices.) Many families are beginning to shift production to [[cash crops]] such as [[cashews]], [[mangoes]], and [[tobacco]], a trend that has accelerated in recent years.<ref>Levett; Suzuki, p. 10; "Untangling the Web of Human Trafficking and Unsafe Migration in Cambodia and Lao PDR".</ref> Ratanakiri villagers have traditionally had little contact with the cash economy.<ref name=bann/> Barter exchange remains widespread, and Khmer Loeu villagers tended to visit markets only once per year until quite recently.<ref name=bann/> As of 2005, monetary income in the province averaged US$5 per month per person; purchased possessions such as motorcycles, televisions, and [[karaoke]] sets have become extremely desirable.<ref name=suzuki10>Suzuki, p. 10.</ref>

Larger-scale agriculture occurs on [[rubber]], [[coffee]], and [[cashew]] plantations.<ref>"Rethinking Poverty Reduction" ([http://www.ngoforum.org.kh/Land/Docs/Indigenous/Rethinking/Part%20I.htm Part I: An Overview of the Situation of Indigenous Minorities in Ratanakiri]); 1999<U+2013>2000 Ratanakiri Provincial Development Plan, p. 170.</ref> Other economic activities in the province include gem mining and commercial logging. The most abundant gem in Ratanakiri is blue [[zircon]]. Small quantities of [[amethyst]], [[peridot]], and black [[opal]] are also produced.<ref>Austin et al.</ref> Gems are generally mined using traditional methods, with individuals digging holes and tunnels and manually removing the gems; recently, however, commercial mining operations have been moving into the province.<ref>"Bleak outlook for Cambodian gem diggers as mining firms move in"; Bou Saroeun and Phelim Kyne; Calvet ("J<U+00F3>venes pobres..."); Dobbs.</ref> Logging, particularly illegal logging, has been a problem both for environmental reasons and because of land alienation.
