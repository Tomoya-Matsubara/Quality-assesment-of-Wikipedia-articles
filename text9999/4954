'''William Dickson "W. D." Boyce''' (June 16, 1858&nbsp;<U+2013> June 11, 1929), an American [[newspaper]] man, entrepreneur, magazine publisher, and explorer, was the founder of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) and the short-lived [[Lone Scouts of America]] (LSA).<ref name="Points">{{cite web |year =2007 | url =http://www.extramile.us/honorees/boyce.cfm | title =William D. Boyce | work =Points of Light| publisher =The Extra Mile | accessdate = 2008-10-11}}</ref> Born in [[Plum, Pennsylvania|Plum Township, Pennsylvania]], he acquired a love for the outdoors early in his life. After working as a schoolteacher and a coal miner, Boyce attended [[College of Wooster|Wooster Academy]] in Ohio before moving to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and Canada. An astute businessman, Boyce successfully established several newspapers, such as ''The Commercial'' in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] and the ''Lisbon Clipper'' in [[Lisbon, North Dakota]]. With his first wife, Mary Jane Beacom, he moved to Chicago to pursue his [[entrepreneur]]ial ambitions. There he established the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company and the weekly ''Saturday Blade'', which catered to a rural audience and was distributed by thousands of newspaper boys. With his novel employment of newsboys to boost newspaper sales, Boyce's namesake publishing company maintained a circulation of 500,000&nbsp;copies per week by 1894. Boyce strongly supported worker rights, as demonstrated by his businesses' support of [[trade union|labor unions]] and his maintenance of his newsboys' [[quality of life|well-being]].

By the early years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and had taken a step back from his businesses to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer [[George R. Lawrence]] and [[cartoonist]] [[John T. McCutcheon]]. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered [[KV62|tomb]] of [[Tutankhamun|King Tutankhamun]].

Boyce learned about [[Scouting]] while passing through London, England during his first expedition to Africa in 1909. According to somewhat fictionalized legend, Boyce had become lost in the dense London fog, but was guided back to his destination by a [[Unknown Scout|young boy]], who told him that he was merely doing his duty as a [[Boy Scout]]. Boyce then read printed material on Scouting, and on his return to the United States, he formed the BSA. From its start, Boyce focused the Scouting program on teaching self-reliance, citizenship, resourcefulness, patriotism, obedience, cheerfulness, courage, and courtesy in order "to make men".<ref name="pett34"/> After clashing over the Scouting program with [[Chief Scout Executive]] [[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]], he split from the BSA and founded the LSA in January 1915, which catered to rural boys who had limited opportunities to form a troop or a patrol. In June 1924, a merger was completed between the BSA and the struggling LSA. Boyce received many awards and memorials for his efforts in the U.S. Scouting movement, including the [[Silver Buffalo Award]].

==Personal life==
[[File:William Boyce.png|thumb|right|150px|William D. Boyce circa 1912]]
Boyce was born on June 16, 1858 in [[Plum Township, Pennsylvania]] to a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] farm couple, David and Margaret Jane Bratton Boyce.<ref name="Points"/><ref name="pett4">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=2}}</ref> The Boyce's had three children: William Dickson, Mary, and John.<ref name="pett4"/> During his rural childhood, Boyce acquired a love for the outdoors. He began teaching school at the age of 16 and then worked briefly as a [[coal mining|coal miner]]. He returned to teaching before joining his sister at [[College of Wooster|Wooster Academy]] in [[Ohio]], which<U+2014>according to school records<U+2014>he attended from 1880 to 1881.<ref name="Peterson1">{{cite web | last = Peterson | first = Robert | year =2001 | url =http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0110/d-wwas.html | title =The Man Who Got Lost in the Fog | work =[[Scouting (magazine)|Scouting]]| publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2008-10-11}}</ref><ref name="Index1">{{cite book|title=The Index (College of Wooster yearbook)|publisher=College of Wooster|location=Wooster, Ohio|date=1880|pages=39, 43, 71}}</ref><ref name="Index2">{{cite book|title=The Index (College of Wooster yearbook)|publisher=College of Wooster|location=Wooster, Ohio|date=1881|pages=81}}</ref> It is uncertain if he graduated or was expelled.<ref name="pett5">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=3}}</ref> He then worked as a teacher, [[lumberjack]], secretary, and salesman in the Midwest and Canada before settling in Chicago, where he quickly became known as a persuasive and shrewd salesman and learned business quickly.<ref name="Points"/> His books on business, travel, and expeditions often used the phrase "We pushed on."<ref name="Points"/> On January 1, 1884, Boyce married Mary Jane Beacom (1865<U+2013>1959),<ref name="PSUwife">{{cite web|url=http://www.pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Boyce__William.html|title=Boyce, William Dickenson (W.

In 1903, Boyce purchased a four-story mansion on {{convert|38|acre|ha|0}} in [[Ottawa, Illinois]], which became the center of his family and social activities. Thereafter, he showed little interest in Chicago and its social activities; he would only go there on business.<ref name="pett24">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=35}}</ref> Boyce and Mary led increasingly separate lives and eventually divorced, which was reported on the front page of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' because of the prominence he had attained by that time. The divorce was finalized in a [[Campbell County, South Dakota]] court in September 1908; his wife's property settlement was close to $1&nbsp;million (USD).<ref name="pett28">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=44<U+2013>47}}</ref>

After the divorce was finalized, Boyce courted Virginia Dorcas Lee, a vocalist from [[Oak Park, Illinois]] who was 23&nbsp;years his junior and the eldest child of Virginia and John Adams Lee, a former [[Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Missouri]]. Both Virginia's parents and Boyce's son Ben opposed the relationship. In May 1910, after the planned marriage was announced, an infuriated Ben  scuffled with his father outside the [[Blackstone Hotel]] and Boyce sustained a facial wound. Ben was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $5 and court costs. Two days later, Boyce and Virginia married and went to Europe on an extended honeymoon. Almost immediately, there was speculation amongst family members and in newspapers about problems within the marriage. On April 9, 1911, Boyce and Virginia had a daughter, whom they named Virginia. A few months later, in December 1911, Boyce signed an agreement to support and educate their infant daughter. After Boyce's wife filed for divorce in March 1912, she moved to [[Santa Barbara, California]] with their daughter and her parents.  Boyce did not contest the divorce and arranged for a $100,000 settlement. Years later, the elder Virginia married Richard Roberts, a New York banker, and moved with her and Boyce's daughter to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. The younger Virginia took the surname Roberts. She did not meet her natural father, Boyce, until she was eight years old.<ref name="pett37">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=79<U+2013>80, 83<U+2013>84}}</ref>

Ben married Miriam Patterson of [[Omaha, Nebraska]] on June 11, 1912. Both Boyce and his first wife attended the ceremony. At this time Boyce's first wife, Mary, exchanged some of her Chicago property for the home in Ottawa, which sparked speculation that she and Boyce might reconcile. The next year they remarried on June 14, 1913 in Ottawa. They then departed on a honeymoon to [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], the [[Philippines]], [[Panama]], and Cuba, with their daughter Happy, son Ben, and his wife Miriam.<ref name="pett39">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=84<U+2013>88}}</ref>

==Business enterprises==
As Boyce traveled, he often started a newspaper wherever he went. His first venture into commercial publishing was compiling a city directory. He also worked briefly for a publisher in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and a newspaper publisher in [[Kensington, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Kensington, Pennsylvania]]. He then boarded a train for Chicago and worked as a secretary and salesman for ''Western'' magazine. Restless again, he moved to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] and sold advertisements for a publisher for a short time and then spent a month in [[Fargo, North Dakota]] and [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]]. In [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], he and local resident James W. Steen co-founded ''The Commercial'' in 1881, a newspaper that lasted for 70 years. He sold his share of ''The Commercial'' to his partner in 1882 and returned to Fargo where he became a reporter.<ref name="pett60">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=3<U+2013>4}}</ref> In December 1882, Boyce moved to [[Lisbon, North Dakota]], where he bought the ''Dakota Clipper''.<ref name="pett7">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=5}}</ref>

Beginning in December 1884, Boyce managed reporters and news releases at the "Bureau of Correspondence" at the six-month long [[World Cotton Centennial|World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].<ref name="Points"/> Countries from all over the world sent displays. Boyce was responsible for providing news stories on events and displays to over 1,200 newspapers around the country.<ref name="pett8">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=6}}</ref> He returned to North Dakota after the Exposition concluded, but by early 1886 he had moved back to Chicago. He often returned in North Dakota for publishing business deals and deer- and duck-hunting vacations.<ref name="pett9"/>

[[Image:Newsboys.jpg|thumb|right|Newsboys, February 1910]]
In Chicago, he founded the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company in 1886 which provided advertisements and articles to over 200 newspapers.<ref name="pett9"/><ref name="rowan">{{harvnb|Rowan, MD|2005|pp=26<U+2013>28}}</ref> In 1887, he established the weekly ''Saturday Blade'', an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboys<U+2014>an innovation at the time.<ref name="pett10">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=8<U+2013>9}}</ref><ref name="pett12">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=9<U+2013>10}}</ref> By 1892, the ''Saturday Blade'' had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States.<ref name="pett13">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=11}}</ref> Boyce's detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the ''Saturday Blade'' and were reprinted in books by [[Rand McNally]].<ref name="pett2"/> The success of the ''Saturday Blade'' spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company, which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines. In 1892 Boyce bought out the ''Chicago Ledger'', a fiction weekly.<ref name="pett13"/> In January 1903 he founded the international ''Boyce's Weekly'', which advocated worker's rights. Boyce's prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]] and [[Henry Demarest Lloyd]] as writers and editors for ''Boyce's Weekly''.<ref name="pett25">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=37}}</ref> Eight months later, ''Boyce's Weekly'' was consolidated with the ''Saturday Blade.''<ref name="pett25a">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=39}}</ref> Boyce also established the newspapers ''Farm Business'' in 1914 and ''Home Folks Magazine'' in 1922. Dwindling sales led to the 1925 merger of the ''Blade'' and ''Ledger'' into the monthly ''Chicago Blade & Ledger'', which was published until 1937.<ref name="Points"/> As Boyce's enterprises grew, he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30,000 delivery boys, who were key to his financial success. Working with them may have helped him gain an understanding of America's youth. Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite, reading human nature, and handling money.<ref name="Points"/><ref name="Peterson1"/><ref name="pett41">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=89<U+2013>90}}</ref> Boyce's focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men: "There are many obstacles to overcome, but toil, grit and endurance will help you to overcome them all. Help yourself and others will help you." and "...&nbsp;whatever trade you have selected; never swerve from that purpose a single moment until it is accomplished".<ref name="pett15">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=18}}</ref>

[[Image:BoyceBuildingFront.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Boyce Building at 500<U+2013>510 N. Dearborn, Chicago, IL]]
In 1891, Boyce began working on his own 12-story office building at 30 North Dearborn, known as the Boyce Building, it was designed by [[Henry Ives Cobb]]. Even 20&nbsp;years later, this building was recognized as the most expensive building (in terms of dollars per cubic foot) in Chicago. In 1907, Boyce consolidated his business operations into another office building, also known as the Boyce Building, at 500<U+2013>510 North Dearborn. A new four-story office building<U+2014>designed by the architectural firm of [[Daniel Burnham]]<U+2014>was built on this location in 1912 and expanded during 1913<U+2013>14 with an additional six stories.<ref name="pett40">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=89}}</ref> This building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on February 29, 1996.<ref name="Peterson1"/><ref name="pett14">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=16, 43, 151}}</ref><ref name="NRHP">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/il/Cook/state.html|title=Illinois&nbsp;<U+2014> Cook County|publisher=National Register of Historic Places|accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref><ref name="HistBuil">{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Frank Alfred|coauthors=Randall, John D. |title=History of the Development of Building Construction in Chicago |publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago, Illinois|page=286|isbn=0252024168|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gYLlF61yeYEC&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286&dq=%22boyce+building%22+history+500&source=web&ots=6yYaovSvH6&sig=C3zRwXKDpRZN5NJFdwjh-vEKihU&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA286,M1|accessdate=2008-11-02|date=1999|edition=2nd}}</ref>

At a time when women had trouble finding work and workers were often oppressed, Boyce felt their rights were important: his businesses employed many women and he supported labor unions. His newspapers often carried stories about the "nobility of labor". His businesses were able to pay out wages and benefits during the [[Panic of 1893]], a time when many businesses were laying off workers and cutting wages.<ref name="Panic1893">{{cite web|url=http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/p/PANIC1893.html|title=The Panic of 1893|last=Walker|first=Ronald W.|work=Utah History Encyclopedia|publisher=University of Utah|accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref> During the [[Pullman Strike]] of the [[Pullman Company|Pullman Palace Car Company]] in 1894, which spread to 20 companies in over half the states, Boyce called [[Eugene V. Debs]], the socialist labor leader of the [[American Railway Union]], a "great labor leader" and [[George Pullman]], inventor of the [[sleeping car]], the man "who caused all the trouble".<ref name="pett16">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=19<U+2013>20}}</ref> In 1901 when the Boyce Paper Manufacturing Company in [[Marseilles, Illinois]] burned down, he paid the workers immediately and then hired them as construction workers to rebuild the paper mill so they would not lose income.<ref name="pett23">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=34<U+2013>35}}</ref><ref name="LeadingMen">{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=John W.|title=The Book of Chicagoans: A Biographical Dictionary of Leading Living Men of the City of Chicago|publisher=A.

In late 1894, when two of his workers were injured by a fallen smokestack and won $2,000 each in a court judgment, Boyce appealed the case all the way to the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]], and lost.<ref name="pett17">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=21}}</ref> He was also persistent in getting what he wanted; in 1902 he sued the Marseilles Land and Power Company for not supplying enough water power to his mills and won a $65,300 judgment. In 1903 the Marseilles Land and Power Company fell into receivership and Boyce bought the company.<ref name="pett23"/>

Boyce hired his son, Ben, when he was 20 years old, giving him high-level positions in his water and power businesses in and around Marseilles and Ottawa.<ref name="pett27">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=41<U+2013>44}}</ref> However, their relationship was often strained by Boyce's high expectations and Ben's carelessness with his funds in activities such as betting on horse races.<ref name="pett29">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=6, 47}}</ref>

During June<U+2013>August 1906, the government proposed quadrupling the postage rate for second-class mail, which included newspapers, from one cent to four cents per pound. In response, Boyce proposed buying the postal service for $300&nbsp;million (USD), claiming that he would reduce postal rates by half, eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations, establish a rural postal express, pay rent to the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] for postal buildings, and return profits over seven percent. This offer was rejected by the government, but it did halt their planned second-class postage rate increase.<ref name="pett26">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=42<U+2013>43}}</ref>

Boyce was a multi-millionaire by the early 1900s and by 1909 became more interested in civic affairs and less in finance.<ref name="Peterson1"/><ref name="pett11">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=47}}</ref> He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions.<ref name="Points"/> He leased hunting lodges at [[Lake City, South Dakota|Fort Sisseton, South Dakota]], where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted friends and relatives, especially his son, for activities such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor.<ref name="pett30">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=48}}</ref><ref name="pett52">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=119<U+2013>123}}</ref> These changes may have been in part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement that he and his wife, Mary Jane, were separating.

In 1914 Boyce bought two more newspapers, the ''Indianapolis Sun'', which he renamed the ''Indianapolis Daily Times'', and the ''Inter Ocean Farmer'', which he renamed ''The Farming Business''.<ref name="pett42">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=91}}</ref> By 1920, the majority of Americans lived in cities instead of rural areas. ''Lone Scout'', ''Saturday Blade'', and ''Chicago Ledger'' all focused on rural customers and began to falter. Boyce launched ''Home Folks Magazine'' in an attempt to regain customers.<ref name="pett54">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=133<U+2013>135}}</ref> By June 1925, sales had slipped so much that he merged the latter two titles into the ''Blade and Ledger'', which caused sales to rise again. This encouraged Boyce to start ''Movie Romances'', one of the first tabloid magazines about movie star romances.<ref name="pett55">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=141}}</ref>

Boyce's success in the publishing business lay in his ability to organize the administration of a business and delegate details to subordinates. He eventually amassed a fortune of about $20&nbsp;million USD.<ref name="pett2">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=xii}}</ref><ref name="pett">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=viii<U+2013>ix}}</ref> Boyce's life paralleled [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s in many ways: Both men were products of the [[Progressive Era]], internationally prominent, had concern for children, supported Scouting, were adventurers and outdoorsmen, and were interested in civic reform. Although Boyce admired and sought to surpass Roosevelt, his only foray into politics was the 1896 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] primary for congressman<U+2014>a bitterly fought campaign which he lost to first-term incumbent [[George E. Foss]].<ref name="pett19">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=22<U+2013>28}}</ref> In all likelihood, Boyce met Roosevelt at the [[Union League|Union League Club of Chicago]], of which the former had become a member in 1891.<ref name="pett1">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=xi, 11}}</ref> His ambivalent attitude towards government was a common one of the general public during the [[Progressive Era]].<ref name="pett"/> However, Boyce's Republican credentials and monetary contributions earned him an invitation to the [[President of the United States|presidential]] [[inauguration]] and ball of [[William Howard Taft]] in March 1909.<ref name="pett11"/>

==Expeditions==
Boyce financed an expedition of the explorer [[Frederick Schwatka]] to Alaska in 1896. Schwatka discovered gold near [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and Boyce reported this success in his newspapers, which led him to finance other Schwatka expeditions as well as those of other adventurers, including a failed expedition to the [[Yukon River]] in 1898.<ref name="pett22">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=31}}</ref> Boyce soon began to carry out his own expeditions.<ref name="pett12"/> When the United States entered the [[Spanish-American War|Spanish<U+2013>American War]] in 1898, Boyce set sail for [[Cuba]]n waters aboard the ship ''Three Friends''. The nature of the activities of Boyce and this ship are unknown.<ref name="pett21">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=30}}</ref>

In March 1909, Boyce embarked on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a visit to his daughters, who were in Rome.<ref name="pett11"/> On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with [[safari]] organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence's son Raymond were part of the expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]] and was in [[Nairobi]] by September. After hiring local [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and [[Lake Victoria]]. The expedition was a failure because a [[telephoto lens]] was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of [[East Africa]], and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away.<ref name="pett31">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=49<U+2013>62}}</ref> The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi.<ref name="Scott">{{cite journal|last=Scott| first=David C.| year=2006| title=The Origins of BSA's 1910 Handbook| journal=International Scouting Collectors Association Journal (ISCA Journal) | volume=6| issue=4| pages=pp. 6<U+2013>13}}</ref> The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals.<ref name="pett31"/>

In December 1910, Boyce led a nine-month, {{convert|50000|mi|km|sing=on}} expedition to South America that was extensively reported in his newspapers.<ref name="pett38">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=81<U+2013>82}}</ref> In late January 1915, Boyce sailed to England because of his concern over World War I.<ref name="pett2"/><ref name="pett43">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=93<U+2013>94}}</ref> He received permission from the American Legation in Switzerland to travel into Germany and Austria for six weeks to report on the industrial and commercial effects of the war on those countries. He sent extensive reports to his newspapers and returned home around April<U+2013>May.<ref name="pett44">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=95}}</ref>

In late 1922, Boyce departed on another expedition to Africa, this time for six months. [[Morocco]] reminded him of the Dakotas, [[Kansas]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]], and [[Arizona]]. In [[Egypt]] he visited the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], which had been discovered just a few months earlier. His expedition then went to [[Luxor]] and sailed up the [[Nile|Nile River]] to [[Edfu]], where the houses had no roofs and while he was there it rained and hailed for the first time in decades. Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa, he had shot at least one of every game animal.<ref name="pett53">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=128<U+2013>131}}</ref>

==Scouting==
As Boyce's interest in [[philanthropy]] grew, he turned to his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while ''en route'' to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots.<ref name="pett"/> Many youth organizations such as the [[Woodcraft Indians]] and [[Sons of Daniel Boone]] formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes.<ref name="pett32">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=63<U+2013>64}}</ref> By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in [[Algeria]] saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.<ref name="pett53"/>

===Unknown Scout legend===
{{details|Unknown Scout}}
According to legend, Boyce was lost on a foggy street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout came to his aid, guiding him back to his destination.<ref name="Peterson1"/> The boy then refused Boyce's tip, explaining that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout. Soon thereafter, Boyce met with [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], who was the head of the [[The Scout Association|Boy Scout Association]] at that time. Boyce returned to America, and, four months later, founded the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. He intended to base the program around [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] lore. This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines. There are several variations of it, including ones that claim Boyce knew about Scouting before this encounter and that the Unknown Scout took him to Scout headquarters.<ref name="rowan"/><ref name="Scott"/><ref name="pett32"/>

In actuality, Boyce stopped in London ''en route'' to a safari in [[British East Africa]].<ref name="rowan"/> It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street to a hotel; he did not take him to the Scout headquarters and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of ''Scouting For Boys'' and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via [[San Francisco]], he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention the fog, a 1928 account recounts that he did say there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.<ref name="rowan"/><ref name="pett32"/><ref name="WDBletter">

[[Image:BSA War Service Uniforms 1917 18.jpg|thumb|right|BSA uniforms, 1917<U+2013>18]]
The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on February 8, 1910, but it struggled from shortages of cash and leadership in the beginning.<ref name="WDBletter"/> Boyce had enough political influence to get the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]], of Illinois,<ref name="pett33">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=65}}</ref> to introduce House Bill 24747 in 1910 to attain a national charter for the BSA, but the bill was not passed.<ref name="rowan"/><ref name="Scott"/><ref name="WDBletter"/><ref name="fedcharter">{{usctc|36|309|}} Federal charter, Boy Scouts of America</ref> Subsequent competition from the LSA caused [[James E. West (Scouting)|James West]], the BSA's Chief Scout Executive, to seek a federal charter for the BSA. This federal charter for the BSA was granted on June 15, 1916.<ref name="pett48">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=110<U+2013>111}}</ref><ref name="36C309">{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/36C309.txt|title=Patriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, and Organizations&nbsp;<U+2014> Boy Scouts of America|date=2006-01-02|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref> Boyce personally donated $1,000 a month to keep the organization running on the condition that boys of all races and creeds be included,<ref name="WDBletter"/> which was at odds with his own expressed belief in the superiority of whites.<ref name="pett35">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=69}}</ref> He was not interested in directing the organization, and turned over the running of the organization to [[Edgar M. Robinson]] of the [[YMCA]], who proceeded to recruit the permanent executive board of the BSA. The much-needed leadership and management arrived when the Sons of Daniel Boone and Woodcraft Indians merged with the BSA.<ref name="Points"/>

Boyce felt that Scouting's emphasis on outdoor activity was crucial in producing the type of leaders that America needed because youth reared in cities had too much done for them, whereas those from the country had to learn to do things for themselves. Scouting was focused on teaching self-reliance, citizenship, resourcefulness, patriotism, obedience, cheerfulness, courage, and courtesy in order "to make men".<ref name="pett34">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=66}}</ref>

===Lone Scouts of America===
[[Image:WilliamDBoyceLSAplaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on the Boyce Building honoring Boyce and his founding of the Lone Scouts of America]]
Boyce clashed with West,<ref name="WDBletter"/><ref name="pett47">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=108<U+2013>110}}</ref> the BSA's Chief Scout Executive, over a program for boys who lived too far from town to join a troop. Boyce offered to publish a magazine for the BSA, as long as it was published in Chicago. The National Executive Board of the BSA turned this offer down and shortly thereafter Boyce ceased being active in administrative activities of the BSA, though he remained a staunch supporter of the program.<ref name="pett36">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=73<U+2013>76}}</ref> West even had Boyce's name erased from the BSA records for years.<ref name="Points"/> As a result of this and his desire to serve boys who had limited opportunities as he himself did when he was young, Boyce started a new Scouting-related venture: the Lone Scouts of America (LSA) on January 9, 1915.<ref name="Peterson1"/> Reliance on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] themes gave LSA a distinct Native American flavor: Lone Scouts could from small groups known as "tribes", the tribe's treasurer was known as the "[[wampum]]-bearer", and LSA taught boys to respect the environment.<ref name="Peterson1"/> Boyce's annual contribution to the LSA grew to $100,000.<ref name="Points"/> In both the BSA and the LSA, Boyce was a manager and had little direct contact with the Boy Scouts.<ref name="Peterson1"/> Upon his return from reporting on World War I, Boyce immediately began expanding the LSA by starting ''Lone Scout'' magazine and hiring Frank Allan Morgan, a noted Chicago Scoutmaster, to lead the LSA. By November 1915, the LSA had over 30,000 members. Warren conferred upon Boyce the title ''Chief Totem''. Youths could join the LSA simply by mailing in some coupons and five cents.<ref name="pett46">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=102<U+2013>103}}</ref> By 1916, the BSA and the LSA were in direct competition for members.<ref name="pett47"/>  In the summer of 1917, during his annual Dakota hunt, the [[Gros Ventres]] Indian tribe made Boyce a honorary chief with the name "Big Cloud" during a three-day ceremony.<ref name="pett49">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=112<U+2013>113}}</ref> With America at war, Boyce agreed to the creation of a Lone Scout uniform in late 1917. Though he had a uniform made for himself, he stipulated that no Lone Scout was required to purchase one.<ref name="pett50">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=115}}</ref>

Boyce felt that ''Lone Scout'' was the best magazine he had ever done.<ref name="pett45">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=95<U+2013>100}}</ref> ''Lone Scout'' was so popular that it could not handle all the material that was submitted, so many local and regional ''Tribe Papers'' were started.<ref name="pett61">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=104}}</ref><ref name="Tribes">{{cite web|url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0209/d-wwas.html|title=Where the Past Is Ever Present|last=Peterson|first=Robert|date=September 2002|work=The Way It Was|publisher=''Scouting''|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> By 1922, Boyce's newspaper business was suffering and ''Lone Scout'' was losing money<U+2014>it switched from a weekly to a monthly.<ref name="pett54"/> Boyce's racial prejudice was revealed when the racial tensions in Chicago increased in the 1920s.<ref name="rowan"/> The LSA issued a formal proclamation in late 1920 that it would only accept whites and in 1922 changed the masthead of ''Lone Scout'' from "A Real Boys' Magazine" to "The White Boys Magazine".<ref name="pett51">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=116<U+2013>117}}</ref>

The fortunes of the LSA had begun to decline by 1920 when Boyce hired the first professional editor for ''Lone Scout'', George N. Madison. Madison discovered that the LSA's membership roster was wildly inaccurate: it was full of duplications and inactive members.<ref name="pett54"/> The reported 490,000 Lone Scouts in 1922 was a vastly inflated number.<ref name="rowan"/> Boyce finally accepted West's annual offer to merge with the BSA in April 1924, with the merger formalized on June 16, 1924.<ref name="pett54a">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|pp=135<U+2013>136}}</ref><ref name="rowan1">{{harvnb|Rowan, MD|2005|p=103}}</ref> Most Lone Scouts did not transfer to the BSA, though the BSA carried on a Lone Scout program for another 10 years. The program served boys who could not take part in a nearby troop or pack on a regular basis because of such factors as distance, weather, time, disability or other difficulties.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-515.aspx | title = BSA Fact Sheet: What Is the Lone Scout Plan? | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =Peterson | first =Robert | year =2001 | url =http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0110/a-lone.html | title =Scouting Alone | work =Scouting | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-06}}</ref>

Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 of a heart [[embolism]]. His father did not arrive home until after his son's death. Boyce was so saddened over his son's death that his own health suffered. One of Boyce's last efforts was to publish his son's letters from his South Seas expeditions: ''Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea''.<ref name="pett55"/> Boyce died from bronchial [[pneumonia]] on June 11, 1929 in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa, Illinois on June 13, 1929 in the [[Ottawa Avenue Cemetery]], with West delivering the eulogy.<ref name="rowan2">{{harvnb|Rowan|2005|p=113}}</ref> Boy Scouts maintained a honor guard with an American flag in a heavy rainstorm in two-hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers.

Boyce's daughter Virginia, from his second wife, had three children. One of them, William Boyce Mueller, was an acknowledged homosexual. In the early 1990s, without knowing the controversy that would engulf the BSA over its [[Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies#Position_on_homosexuals|stand on homosexuals]] in the 2000s, he founded a group of gay former scouts called Forgotten Scouts from his California home in 1991. He stated that the BSA needed to be "realistic about gay Scouts" and that his grandfather "would not have wanted to see me excluded from Scouting because of my sexual orientation".<ref name="pett58">{{harvnb|Petterchak|2003|p=148}}</ref><ref name="Forgotten">{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/forgotten_scouts.html|title=Unwelcome at the Campfire&nbsp;<U+2014> Gays, still Boy Scout pariahs, turn up the heat for change|last=Adams|first=Jane Meredith|date=1991-11-12|publisher=''Boston Globe'' via BSA-Discrimination.org|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>
