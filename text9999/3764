'''Aramaic''' is a group of [[Semitic languages]] with a [[History of the Aramaic language|3,000-year history]]. It has been the language of administration of empires and the language of divine worship. It is the original language of large sections of the [[Bible|biblical]] books of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], and is the main language of the [[Talmud]]. Aramaic was the [[first language|native language]] of [[Jesus]] (see [[Aramaic of Jesus]]).<ref>{{cite book

The language is considered to be [[endangered language|endangered]].

Aramaic belongs to the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[Language families and languages|language family]]. Within that diverse family, it belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] subfamily. Aramaic is a part of the [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] group of languages, which also includes the [[Canaanite languages]] (such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]). It is also related to [[Arabic language|Arabic]], being part of the more diverse [[Central Semitic languages]]; one possible source for the [[Arabic alphabet]] is [[Nabataean]] Aramaic script.

==Geographic distribution==
During the [[12th century BC|twelfth century BC]], [[Aramaeans]], the native speakers of Aramaic, began to settle in great numbers in modern-day [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and eastern [[Turkey]]. As the language grew in importance, it came to be spoken throughout the [[Mediterranean]] coastal area of the [[Levant]], and spread east of the [[Tigris]]. [[Jew]]ish settlers took the language with them into [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]], and Christian missionaries brought it into [[Iran|Persia]], [[India]] and even [[China]]. From the [[7th century|seventh century AD]] onwards, Aramaic was replaced as the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Middle East]] by [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. However, Aramaic remains a literary and liturgical language among Jews, [[Mandaeans]] and some Christians, and is still spoken by small isolated communities throughout its original area of influence. The turbulence of the last two centuries has seen speakers of first-language and literary Aramaic dispersed throughout the world.

===Aramaic languages and dialects===
Aramaic is really a group of related languages, rather than a single monolithic language. Its long history, extensive literature, and use by different religious communities are all factors in the diversification of the language. Some Aramaic dialects are mutually intelligible, whereas others are not. Some Aramaic languages are known under different names; for example, ''[[Syriac language|Syriac]]'' is particularly used to describe the Eastern Aramaic of Christian communities. Most dialects can be described as either "Eastern"' or "Western," the dividing line being roughly the [[Euphrates]], or slightly west of it. It is also helpful to draw a distinction between those Aramaic languages that are modern living languages (often called ''Neo-Aramaic''), those that are still in use as literary languages, and those that are extinct and are only of interest to scholars. Although there are some exceptions to this rule, this classification gives "Modern," "Middle" and "Old" periods, alongside "Eastern" and "Western" areas, to distinguish between the various languages and dialects that are Aramaic.

==Writing system==
{{main article|Aramaic alphabet}}

[[Image:Syriac Sert<U+00E2> book script.jpg|left|thumb|320px|11th century book in [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac Serto]].]]

The earliest Aramaic alphabet was based on the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician script]]. In time, Aramaic developed its distinctive 'square' style. The ancient Israelites and other peoples of [[Canaan]] adopted this alphabet for writing their own languages. Thus, it is better known as the [[Hebrew alphabet]] today. This is the writing system used in [[Biblical Aramaic]] and other Jewish writing in Aramaic.

The other main writing system used for Aramaic was developed by Christian communities: a cursive form known as the [[Syriac alphabet]] (one of the varieties of the Syriac alphabet, Serto, is shown to the left).

A highly modified form of the Aramaic alphabet, the [[Mandaic alphabet]], is used by the [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]]s.

In addition to these writing systems, certain derivatives of the Aramaic alphabet were used in ancient times by particular groups: [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]] in [[Petra]], for instance, or [[Palmyrenean alphabet|Palmyrenean]] in [[Palmyra]]. In modern times, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] (see [[#Modern East Aramaic|below]]) has sometimes been written in an adapted [[Latin alphabet]].

Here follows a comprehensive history of Aramaic. The history is broken down into three broad periods:
* [[#Old Aramaic|Old Aramaic]] (1100 BCE<U+2013>200 CE), including:
** The [[Biblical Aramaic]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].
** The [[Aramaic of Jesus]].
* [[#Middle Aramaic|Middle Aramaic]] (200<U+2013>1200), including:
** Literary [[Syriac language|Syriac]].
** The Aramaic of the [[Talmud]]s, [[Targum]]im, and [[Midrash]]im.
* [[#Modern Aramaic|Modern Aramaic]] (1200<U+2013>present), including:
** Various modern vernaculars.

This classification is based on that used by Klaus Beyer[[#References|*]].

==Old Aramaic==
Old Aramaic covers over thirteen centuries of the language. This vast time span is chosen as it includes all Aramaic that is now effectively extinct. The main turning point for Old Aramaic is around 500 BCE, when the Ancient Aramaic (the language of Aramaeans) moves into Imperial Aramaic (the language of powerful empires). The various spoken dialects of Old Aramaic come to prominence when [[Greek language|Greek]] replaces Aramaic as the language of power in the region.

===Ancient Aramaic===
Ancient Aramaic refers to the Aramaic of the [[Arameans|Aramaeans]] from its origin until it becomes the official 'lingua franca' of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. It was the language of the city-states of [[Damascus]], [[Hamath]] and [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]].

====Early Ancient Aramaic====
There are quite extensive inscriptions that evidence the earliest use of the language, dating from the [[10th century BC|tenth century BCE]]. These inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The orthography of Aramaic at this early period seems to be based on [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that, in time, a more refined orthography, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. Oddly, the dominance of [[Assyria]]n Empire of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] over Aram in the middle of the eighth century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a [[lingua franca]].

====Late Ancient Aramaic====
[[Image:Bar-rakib.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Silver ingot of Bar-Rakib son of Panammu, king of Sam'al (modern [[Zincirli]])]]

From 700 BCE, the language began to spread in all directions, but lost much of its homogeneity. Different dialects emerged in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Babylonia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. However, the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-influenced Aramaic of Assyria, and then [[Babylon]], started to come to the fore. As described in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 18:26, [[Hezekiah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], negotiates with Assyrian ambassadors in Aramaic so that the common people would not understand. Around 600 BCE, Adon, a [[Canaan]]ite king, uses Aramaic to write to the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]].

'Chaldee' or 'Chaldean Aramaic' used to be common terms for the Aramaic of the Chaldean dynasty of [[Babylonia]]. It was used to describe [[Biblical Aramaic]], which was, however, written in a later style. It is not to be confused with the modern language [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]].

===Imperial Aramaic===
Around 500 BCE, following the [[Achaemenid]] conquest of Mesopotamia under [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], Aramaic (as had been used in that region) was adopted by the conquerors as the "vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed Official Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|title=Aramaic<!-- pp 250<U+2013>261 --><!-- section:Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire pp 251<U+2013>252-->|last=Shaked|first=Saul|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=250<U+2013>261}} p. 251</ref> In 1955, Richard Frye questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an 'official language', noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Frye|first=Richard N.|title=Review of G. R. Driver's "Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B. C."|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=18|issue=3/4|year=1955|pages=456<U+2013>461}} p. 457.</ref> Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought.

Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect, and the inevitable influence of Persian gave the language a new clarity and robust flexibility. For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (in 331 BCE), Imperial Aramaic <U+2014> or near enough for it to be recognisable <U+2014> would remain an influence on the various native [[Iranian languages]]. Aramaic script and <U+2014> as ideograms <U+2014> Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the [[Pahlavi|Pahlavi writing system]].<ref>{{citation|author1-link=Wilhelm Geiger|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Geiger|first2=Ernst|last2=Kuhn|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I. Abteilung 1|location=Boston|publisher=Adamant|pages=249ff}}.</ref>

One of the largest collections of Imperial Aramaic texts is that of the [[Persepolis]] fortification tablets, which number about five hundred.<ref>{{citation|first=John A. Matthew|last=Stolper|title=What are the Persepolis Forti<U+FB01>cation Tablets?|journal=The Oriental Studies News & Notes|issue=winter|year=2007|pages=pp. 6<U+2013>9|url=http://persepolistablets.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-are-persepolis-fortication.html|accessdate=February 13, 2007}}</ref> Many of the extant documents witnessing to this form of Aramaic come from [[Egypt]], and [[Elephantine]] in particular. Of them, the best known is the ''Wisdom of Ahiqar'', a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical [[book of Proverbs]]. Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loan word from a local language.

A group of thirty Aramaic documents from [[Bactria]] have been recently discovered. An analysis was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the fourth-century-BCE Achaemenid administration of Bactria and Sogdiana.<ref>{{citation|title=Ancient Aramaic Documents from Bactria|series=Studies in the Khalili Collection|last1=Naveh|first1=Joseph|last2=Shaked|first2=Shaul|isbn=1-874-78074-9|publisher=Khalili Collections|location=Oxford|year=2006}}</ref>

===Post-Achaemenid Aramaic===
[[Image:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of Alexander bearing an Aramaic language inscription.]]

The conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] did not destroy the unity of Aramaic language and literature immediately. Aramaic that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the [[5th century BC|fifth century BCE]] can be found right up to the early [[2nd century BC|second century]]. The [[Seleucid]]s imposed [[Greek language|Greek]] in the administration of [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]] from the start of their rule. In the [[3rd century BC|third century]], Greek overtook Aramaic as the common language in Egypt and Syria. However, a post-Achaemenid Aramaic continued to flourish from [[Judaea]], through the Syrian Desert, and into [[Arabia]] and [[Parthia]]. 

[[Image:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|260px|Bilingual inscription (Greek and Aramaic) by the Indian king [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]], 3rd century BCE.]]

[[Biblical Aramaic]] is the Aramaic found in four discrete sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:
* [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 4:8<U+2013>6:18 and 7:12<U+2013>26 <U+2014> documents from the Achaemenid period ([[5th century BC|fifth century BCE]]) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem.
* [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 2:4b<U+2013>7:28 <U+2014> five subversive tales and an apocalyptic vision.
* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 10:11 <U+2014> a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry.
* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 31:47 <U+2014> translation of a Hebrew place-name.
Biblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. Some Biblical Aramaic material probably originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. During [[Seleucid]] rule, defiant Jewish propaganda shaped Aramaic [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]. These stories probably existed as oral traditions at their earliest stage. This might be one factor that led to differing collections of Daniel in the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] and the [[Masoretic Text]], which presents a lightly [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-influenced Aramaic.

Under the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official language of [[Hasmonean|Hasmonaean]] Judaea (142<U+2013>37 BCE). It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the [[Qumran]] texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major [[Targum]]s, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]], although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.

Babylonian [[Targum]]ic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the [[Targum Onkelos|Targum Onqelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan]], the 'official' targums. The original, Hasmonaean targum had reached Babylon sometime in the [[2nd century|second]] or [[3rd century|third]] centuries CE. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.

[[Image:Targum.jpg|right|thumb|320px|11th century [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Targum]].]]

Galilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of [[Galilee]]. The Hasmonaean targum reached Galilee in the second century CE, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was not considered an authoritative work by other communities, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended. From the [[11th century|eleventh century CE]] onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.

Babylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the third century CE onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the [[12th century|twelfth century]], all Jewish private documents in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps due to the fact that many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.

[[Nabataean]] Aramaic is the language of the Arab kingdom of [[Petra]]. The kingdom (''c.'' 200 BCE<U+2013>106 CE covered the east bank of the [[Jordan River]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to [[Old North Arabic]]. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: 'l' is often turned into 'n', and there are a few Arabic loan words. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries CE. The language is written in a [[cursive]] script that is the precursor to the modern [[Arabic alphabet]]. The number of Arabic loan words increases through the centuries, until, in the [[4th century|fourth century]], Nabataean merges seamlessly with [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

Palmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the city of [[Palmyra]] in the Syrian Desert from 44 BCE to 274 CE. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive [[Estrangela]]. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a lesser degree.

[[Arsacid]] Aramaic was the official language of the [[Parthian Empire]] (247 BCE<U+2013>224 CE). It, more than any other post-Achaemenid dialect, continues the tradition of [[Darius I]]. Over time, however, it came under the influence of contemporary, spoken Aramaic, [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. After the conquest of the Parthians by the Persian-speaking [[Sassanids]], Arsacid exerted considerable influence on the new official language.

===Late Old Eastern Aramaic===
[[Image:Mandaic.jpg|left|thumb|320px|[[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] magical 'demon trap']]

The dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside these, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, these regional dialects became written languages in the [[2nd century BC|second century BCE]]. These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic, and shows a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.

In the East, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. Much later, Arsacid became the liturgical language of the [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] religion, [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]].

In the kingdom of [[Osrhoene]], centred on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and founded in 132 BCE, the regional dialect became the official language: Old [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. On the upper reaches of the [[Tigris]], East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from [[Hatra]], [[Assur]] and the [[Tur Abdin]]. [[Tatian]], the author of the gospel harmony the [[Diatessaron]] came from Assyria, and perhaps wrote his work (172 CE) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (from ''c.'' 70 CE). This everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.

===Late Old Western Aramaic===
The western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Aramaic came to coexist with Canaanite dialects, eventually displacing [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in the 1st century BCE and [[Hebrew language#Aramaic displaces Hebrew as a spoken language|Hebrew]] around the turn of the 4th century CE.

The form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of [[Caesarea Philippi]]. This is the dialect of the oldest manuscript of [[1 Enoch|Enoch]] (''c.'' 170 BCE). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean into the second century CE. Old Judaean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the [[Talmud]] and receipts from [[Qumran]]. [[Josephus]]' first, non-extant edition of his ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]]'' was written in Old Judaean.

The Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the first century CE by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see [[Peshitta]]).

====Languages during Jesus' lifetime====
{{see|Aramaic of Jesus}}
During Jesus' lifetime, in the first century CE of Israel's Roman Period, Jews are believed to have spoken [[Hebrew language#Classic Hebrew|Hebrew]]{{Fact|date=February 2008}} and Aramaic. Additionally, [[Koine Greek]] was an international language of the Roman administration and trade, and was widely understood by those in the urban spheres of influence. [[Latin]] was spoken in the Roman army, but had almost no impact on the linguistic landscape.

In addition to the formal, literary dialects of Aramaic based on Hasmonaean and Babylonian there were a number of colloquial Aramaic dialects. Seven dialects of [[Aramaic#Old Late Western Aramaic|Western Aramaic]] were spoken in the vicinity of the land of Israel in [[Jesus]]' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judaean was the prominent dialect of [[Jerusalem]] and Judaea. The region of [[Ein Gedi|Engedi]] had the South-east Judaean dialect. [[Samaria]] had its distinctive Samaritan Aramaic, where the consonants '[[he (letter)|he]]', '{{semxlit|[[heth (letter)|<U+1E25>eth]]}}' and '[[ayin|<U+2018>ayin]]' all became pronounced as '[[aleph (letter)|aleph]]'. Galilean Aramaic, the dialect of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: [[diphthong]]s are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of [[Damascus]] and the mountain range of [[Anti-Lebanon]], Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as [[Aleppo]], the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.

The three languages mutually influenced each other, especially Hebrew and Aramaic. Hebrew words entered Jewish Aramaic (mostly technical religious words but also everyday words like ''{{semxlit|<U+2018><U+0113><U+1E63>}}'' 'wood'). Vice versa, Aramaic words entered Hebrew (not only Aramaic words like ''m<U+0101>mm<U+00F4>n'' 'wealth' but Aramaic ways of using words like making Hebrew ''r<U+0101><U+2019><U+00FB>i'', 'seen' mean 'worthy' in the sense of 'seemly', which is a loan translation of Aramaic ''{{semxlit|<U+1E25><U+0101>z<U+00EA>}}'' meaning 'seen' and 'worthy').

The Greek of the [[New Testament]] often preserves non-Greek ''semiticisms'', including transliterations of [[Semitic]] words:
* Some are Aramaic like ''talitha'' (<U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03B8><U+03B1>) that can represent the noun ''{{semxlit|<U+1E6D>aly<U+0115><U+1E6F><U+0101>}}<U+2019>' (Mark 5:41).
* Others can be either Hebrew or Aramaic like ''Rabbounei'' (<U+03A1><U+03B1><U+03B2><U+03B2><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03B9>), which stands for 'my master/great one/teacher' in both languages (John 20:16).

The 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' is notable for its use of much dialogue in Aramaic only, specially reconstructed by a  scholar, but not an Aramaic specialist, [[William Fulco]]. However, rather than basing his reconstruction on what is known of first-century Aramaic, he used the Aramaic of Daniel, fourth-century Syriac and Hebrew as the basis for his work.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.langmaker.com/db/Aramaic|title=Langmaker: Aramaic}}</ref> Modern Aramaic speakers found the language stilted and unfamiliar.

==Middle Aramaic==
The [[3rd century|third century CE]] is taken as the threshold between Old and Middle Aramaic. During that century, the nature of the various Aramaic languages and dialects begins to change. The descendants of Imperial Aramaic ceased to be living languages, and the eastern and western regional languages began to form vital, new literatures. Unlike many of the dialects of Old Aramaic, much is known about the vocabulary and grammar of Middle Aramaic.

===Eastern Middle Aramaic===
Only two of the Old Eastern Aramaic languages continued into this period. In the north of the region, Old Syriac moved into Middle Syriac. In the south, Jewish Old Babylonian became Jewish Middle Babylonian. The post-Achaemenid, Arsacid dialect became the background of the new [[Mandaic language]].

====Middle Syriac====
{{main|Syriac language}}

[[Image:Estrangela.jpg|right|thumb|320px|9th century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]] manuscript of [[John Chrysostom]]'s ''Homily on the [[Gospel of John]]'']]

Middle Syriac is the classical, literary and liturgical language of [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] to this day. Its golden age was the [[4th century|fourth]] to [[6th century|sixth]] centuries. This period began with the translation of the Bible into the language: the [[Peshitta]] and the masterful prose and poetry of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. Middle Syriac, unlike its forebear, is a thoroughly Christian language, although in time it became the language of those opposed to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] leadership of the church in the east. Missionary activity led to the spread of Syriac through [[Iran|Persia]] and into [[India]] and [[China]].
{{listen|filename=aboun.ogg|title=Abun dbashmayo|description=The [[Lord's Prayer]], ''Abun dbashmayo'', sung in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]}}

====Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic====<!-- This section is linked from [[Halakha]] -->
{{main|Jewish Babylonian Aramaic}}
Jewish Middle Babylonian is the language employed by Jewish writers in Babylonia between the 4th century and the 11th century CE. It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian [[Talmud]] (which was completed in the [[7th century|seventh century]]) and of post-Talmudic ([[Geonim|Geonic]]) literature, which are the most important cultural products of Babylonian Jewry. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of Aramaic magic bowls written in the Jewish script.

====Mandaic====
{{main|Mandaic language}}
Mandaic is a sister dialect to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, though it is both linguistically and culturally distinct. Classical Mandaic is the language in which the Mandaean's religious literature was composed. It is characterized by a highly phonetic orthography.

===Western Middle Aramaic===
The dialects of Old Western Aramaic continued with Jewish Middle Palestinian (in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew 'square script']]), Samaritan Aramaic (in the [[Phoenician alphabet|old Hebrew script]]) and Christian Palestinian (in cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]]). Of these three, only Jewish Middle Palestinian continued as a written language.

====Jewish Middle Palestinian Aramaic====
In 135, after [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]], many [[Jew]]ish leaders, expelled from [[Jerusalem]], moved to [[Galilee]]. The Galilean dialect thus rose from obscurity to become the standard among Jews in the west. This dialect was spoken not only in Galilee, but also in the surrounding parts. It is the linguistic setting for the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (completed in the [[5th century|fifth century]]), Palestinian [[targum]]im (Jewish Aramaic versions of scripture), and [[midrash]]im (biblical commentaries and teaching). The standard [[niqqud|vowel pointing]] for the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Tiberian system ([[7th century|seventh century]]), was developed by speakers of the Galilean dialect of Jewish Middle Palestinian. Classical Hebrew vocalisation, therefore, in representing the Hebrew of this period, probably reflects the contemporary pronunciation of this Aramaic dialect. 

[[Middle Judaean Aramaic|Middle Judaean]], the descendant of [[Old Judaean Aramaic|Old Judaean]], is no longer the dominant dialect, and was used only in southern Judaea (the variant Engedi dialect continued throughout this period). Likewise, [[Middle East Jordanian Aramaic|Middle East Jordanian]] continues as a minor dialect from [[Old East Jordanian Aramaic|Old East Jordanian]]. The inscriptions in the synagogue at [[Dura-Europos]] are either in Middle East Jordanian or Middle Judaean.

====Samaritan Aramaic====
{{main|Samaritan Aramaic language}}
The Aramaic dialect of the [[Samaritan]] community is earliest attested by a documentary tradition that can be dated back to the fourth century. Its modern pronunciation is based on the form used in the tenth century.

====Christian Palestinian Aramaic====
The language of Western-Aramaic-speaking Christians is evidenced from the sixth century, but probably existed two centuries earlier. The language itself comes from Christian Old Palestinian, but its writing conventions were based on early Middle Syriac, and it was heavily influenced by Greek. The name Jesus, although ''Ye<U+0161><U+00FB>`'' in Aramaic, is written ''Yes<U+00FB>s'' in Christian Palestinian.

==Modern Aramaic==
{{main|Neo-Aramaic languages}}
Over 400,000 people of various communities from across the [[Middle East]], and recent [[Emigration|emigrants]] who have moved out of these communities, speak one of several varieties of Modern Aramaic (also called ''Neo-Aramaic'') natively, including by religious adherence; [[Christian]]s, [[Jew]]s, [[Mandaean]]s and [[Muslim]]s. Having lived in remote areas as insulated communities, the remaining modern speakers of Aramaic dialects escaped the linguistic pressures experienced by others during the large scale [[language shift]]s that saw the proliferation of other tongues among those who previously did not speak them, most recently the [[Arabization]] of the Middle East and North Africa by [[Muslim]] [[Arabia]]ns during their spread of [[Islam]]. Most of the people of that region who converted to Islam, and many from the remaining unconverted population, also adopted Arabic as their first language. The Aramaic speakers have preserved their traditions with printing presses and now with electronic media.

The Neo-Aramaic languages are now farther apart in their comprehension of one another than perhaps they have ever been. The last two-hundred years have not been good to Aramaic speakers. Instability throughout the Middle East has led to a worldwide diaspora of Aramaic-speakers. The year 1915 is especially prominent for Aramaic-speaking Christians who experienced the [[Assyrian Genocide]] (''Sayfo'' or ''Sayp<U+0101>''; literally meaning ''sword'' in [[Syriac]]), and all Christian groups living in eastern [[Turkey]] in general (see also [[Armenian_Genocide]], [[Pontic_Greek_Genocide]]) who were the subjects of the genocide that marked the end of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. For Aramaic-speaking Jews 1950 is a watershed year: the founding of the state of [[Israel]] and consequent [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]], including [[Iraq]], led most Iraqi Jews, both Aramaic-speaking and Arabic-speaking Iraqi Jews, to emigrate to Israel. However, immigration to Israel has led to the Jewish Neo-Aramaic (and Jewish Iraqi Arabic) being replaced by Modern Hebrew among children of the migrants. The practical extinction of many Jewish dialects seems imminent.

===Modern Eastern Aramaic===
Modern Eastern Aramaic exists in a wide variety of dialects and languages. There is significant difference between the Aramaic spoken by [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]]s.

The Christian languages are often called Modern [[Syriac language|Syriac]] (or Neo-Syriac, particularly when referring to their literature), being deeply influenced by the literary and liturgical language of Middle Syriac. However, they also have roots in numerous, previously unwritten, local Aramaic dialects, and are not purely the direct descendants of the language of [[Ephrem the Syrian]].

Modern Western Syriac (also called Central Neo-Aramaic, being in between Western Neo-Aramaic and Eastern Neo-Syriac) is generally represented by [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]], the language of the [[Tur Abdin]]. A related language, [[Mlahs<U+00F4> language|Mlahs<U+00F4>]], has recently become extinct.

The eastern Christian languages (Modern Eastern Syriac or Eastern Neo-Aramaic) are often called ''Sureth'' or ''Suret'', from a native name. They are also sometimes called ''[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]]'' or ''[[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]]'', but these names are not accepted by all speakers. The dialects are not all mutually intelligible. East Syriac communities are usually members of either the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] or [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

The [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Jewish Modern Aramaic languages]] are now mostly spoken in [[Israel]], and most are facing extinction (older speakers are not passing the language to younger generations). The Jewish dialects that have come from communities that once lived between [[Lake Urmia]] and [[Mosul]] are not all mutually intelligible. In some places, for example [[Urmia]], Christians and Jews speak unintelligible dialects of Modern Eastern Aramaic in the same place. In others, the plain of Mosul for example, the dialects of the two faith communities are similar enough to allow conversation.

A few Mandaeans living in the province of [[Khuzestan]] in [[Iran]] speak Modern [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. It is quite distinct from any other Aramaic dialect.

===Modern Western Aramaic===
{{main|Western Neo-Aramaic}}
Very little remains of Western Aramaic. It is still spoken in the Christian village of [[Ma`loula]] in Syria and the Muslim villages of [[Bakh`a]] and [[Jubb`adin]] in [[Syria]]'s side of [[Anti-Lebanon]], as well as by some people who migrated from these villages to [[Damascus]] and other larger towns of Syria. All these speakers of Modern Western Aramaic are fluent in Arabic, which has now become the main language in these villages.

==Sounds==
Each dialect of Aramaic has its own distinctive pronunciation, and it would not be feasible here to go into all these properties. Aramaic has a phonological palette of 25 to 40 distinct phonemes. In general, older dialects tended to have a richer phonology than more modern ones. In particular, some modern Jewish Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of 'emphatic' consonants. Other dialects have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

===Vowels===
As with most Semitic languages, Aramaic can be thought of as having three basic sets of vowels:
* Open ''a''-vowels
* Close front ''i''-vowels
* Close back ''u''-vowels
These vowel groups are relatively stable, but the exact articulation of any individual is most dependent on its consonantal setting.

The cardinal open vowel is an open near-front unrounded vowel ('short' ''a'', somewhat like the first vowel in the English 'batter', {{IPA2|a}}). It usually has a back counterpart ('long' ''a'', like the ''a'' in 'father', {{IPA|[<U+0251>]}}, or even tending to the vowel in 'caught', {{IPA|[<U+0254>]}}), and a front counterpart ('short' ''e'', like the vowel in 'head', {{IPA|[<U+025B>]}}). There is much correspondence between these vowels between dialects. There is some evidence that Middle Babylonian dialects did not distinguish between the short ''a'' and short ''e''. In West Syriac dialects, and possibly Middle Galilean, the long ''a'' became the ''o'' sound. The open ''e'' and back ''a'' are often indicated in writing by the use of the letters 'alaph' (a [[glottal stop]]) or 'he' (like the English ''h'').

The cardinal close front vowel is the 'long' ''i'' (like the vowel in 'need', {{IPA|[i]}}). It has a slightly more open counterpart, the 'long' ''e'', as in the final vowel of 'caf<U+00E9>' ({{IPA|[e]}}). Both of these have shorter counterparts, which tend to be pronounced slightly more open. Thus, the short close ''e'' corresponds with the open ''e'' in some dialects. The close front vowels usually use the consonant ''y'' as a [[matres lectionis|mater lectionis]].

The cardinal close back vowel is the 'long' ''u'' (like the vowel in 'school', {{IPA|[u]}}). It has a more open counterpart, the 'long' ''o'', like the vowel in 'low' ({{IPA|[o]}}). There are shorter, and thus more open, counterparts to each of these, with the short close ''o'' sometimes corresponding with the long open ''a''. The close back vowels often use the consonant ''w'' to indicate their quality.

Two basic [[diphthong]]s exist: an open vowel followed by ''y'' (''ay''), and an open vowel followed by ''w'' (''aw''). These were originally full diphthongs, but many dialects have converted them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively.

The so-called 'emphatic' consonants (see the next section) cause all vowels to become mid-centralised.

===Consonants===
The various alphabets used for writing Aramaic languages have twenty-two letters (all of which are consonants). Some of these letters, though, can stand for two or three different sounds (usually a [[Stop consonant|plosive]] and a [[fricative]] at the same point of articulation). Aramaic classically uses a series of lightly contrasted plosives and fricatives:
* Labial set: ''p''/''f'' and ''b''/''v'',
* Dental set: ''t''/''<U+03B8>'' and ''d''/''<U+00F0>'',
* Velar set: ''k''/''x'' and ''g''/{{Unicode|''<U+0263>''}}.
Each member of a certain pair is written with the same letter of the alphabet in most writing systems (that is, ''p'' and ''f'' are written with the same letter), and are near [[allophone]]s.

A distinguishing feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) is the presence of 'emphatic' consonants. These are consonants that are pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted, with varying degrees of [[pharyngealization]] and [[Velar consonant|velar]]isation. Using their alphabetic names, these emphatics are:
* {{unicode|<U+1E24><U+00EA><U+1E6F>}}, a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]], {{IPA|/<U+0127>/}} (like the sound made breathing on glass),
* {{unicode|<U+1E6C><U+00EA><U+1E6F>}}, a pharyngealized ''t'', {{IPA|/t<U+02C1>/}},
* {{unicode|<U+02BD>Ayn}}, a pharyngealized [[glottal stop]] (sometimes considered to be a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]]), {{IPA|[<U+0295>]}}/ or {{IPA|[<U+0294><U+02C1>]}},
* {{unicode|<U+1E62><U+0101><U+1E0F><U+00EA>}}, a pharyngealized ''s'', {{IPA|/s<U+02C1>/}},
* {{unicode|Q<U+00F4>p<U+0304>}}, an [[uvular]] ''k'' (a [[voiceless uvular plosive]]), {{IPA|/q/}}.
{{listen|filename=Aramaic_emphatics.ogg|title=The emphatic consonants of Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Ancient Aramaic may have had a larger series of emphatics. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.

Overlapping with the set of emphatics are the 'guttural' consonants. They include {{unicode|<U+1E24><U+00EA><U+1E6F>}} and {{unicode|<U+02BD>Ayn}} from the emphatic set, and add {{unicode|<U+02BC><U+0100>lap<U+0304>}} (a [[glottal stop]]) and {{unicode|H<U+00EA>}} (as the English 'h').

Aramaic classically has a set of four [[sibilant consonant|sibilants]] (Ancient Aramaic may have had six):
* /s/ (as in English 'sea'),
* /z/ (as in English 'zero'),
* {{IPA|/<U+0283>/}} (as in English 'ship'),
* {{IPA|/s<U+02C1>/}} (the emphatic {{unicode|<U+1E62><U+0101><U+1E0F><U+00EA>}} listed above).

In addition to these sets, Aramaic has the [[nasal consonant]]s ''m'' and ''n'', and the [[approximant consonant|approximants]] ''r'' (usually an [[alveolar trill]]), ''l'', ''y'' and ''w''.

===Historical sound changes===
Six broad features of sound change can be seen as dialect differentials:
# Vowel change <U+2014> This occurs almost too frequently to document fully, but is a major distinctive feature of different dialects.
# Plosive/fricative pair reduction <U+2014> Originally, Aramaic, like [[Tiberian Hebrew]], had fricatives as conditioned [[allophone]]s for each plosive. In the wake of vowel changes, the distinction eventually became phonemic; still later, it was often lost in certain dialects. For example, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] has mostly lost /p/, using /f/ instead; other dialects (for instance, standard [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]) have lost /<U+03B8>/ and /<U+00F0>/ and replaced them with /t/ and /d/. In most dialects of Modern Syriac, /f/ and /v/ become /w/ after a vowel.
# Loss of emphatics <U+2014> Some dialects have replaced emphatic consonants with non-emphatic counterparts, while those spoken in the [[Caucasus]] often have [[glottal consonant|glottalized]] rather than [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] emphatics.
# Guttural assimilation <U+2014> This is the main feature of Samaritan pronunciation, also found in [[Samaritan Hebrew]]: all the gutturals are reduced to a simple glottal stop. Some Modern Aramaic dialects do not pronounce ''h'' in all words (the third person masculine pronoun 'hu' becomes 'ow').
# Proto-Semitic */<U+03B8>/ */<U+00F0>/ are reflected in Aramaic as */t/, */d/, whereas they became sibilants in Hebrew (the number three in Hebrew is '<U+0161><U+0101>l<U+00F4><U+0161>', but '{{unicode|tl<U+0101><U+1E6F>}}' in Aramaic). Dental/sibilant shifts are still happening in the modern dialects.
# New phonetic inventory <U+2014> Modern dialects have borrowed sounds from the surrounding, dominant languages. The usual inventory is /{{IPA|<U+0292>}}/ (as the first consonant in 'azure'), /{{IPA|<U+02A4>}}/ (as in 'jam') and /{{IPA|<U+02A7>}}/ (as in 'church'). The [[Syriac alphabet]] has been adapted for writing these new sounds.

==Grammar==
As with other Semitic languages, Aramaic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the way words are put together) is based on the [[triliteral]] root. The root consists of three consonants and has a basic meaning, for example, ''k-t-b'' has the meaning of 'writing'. This is then modified by the addition of vowels and other consonants to create different nuances of the basic meaning:
* ''{{unicode|K<U+1E6F><U+0101><U+1E07><U+00E2>}}'', handwriting, inscription, script, book.
* ''{{unicode|K<U+1E6F><U+0101><U+1E07><U+00EA>}}'', the Scriptures.
* ''{{unicode|K<U+0101><U+1E6F><U+00FB><U+1E07><U+00E2>}}'', secretary, scribe.
* ''{{unicode|K<U+1E6F><U+0101><U+1E07>e<U+1E6F>}}'', I wrote.
* ''{{unicode|E<U+1E35>t<U+00FB><U+1E07>}}'', I shall write.
{{listen|filename=kthovo.ogg|title=Aramaic words based on the triliteral root ''k-t-b''|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Aramaic has two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine. Nouns can be either singular or plural, but an additional 'dual' number exists for nouns that usually come in pairs. The dual number gradually disappeared from Aramaic over time and has little influence in Middle and Modern Aramaic.

Aramaic nouns and adjectives can exist in one of three states; these states correspond in part to the role of cases in other languages. The 'absolute' state is the basic form of a noun (for example, ''{{unicode|k<U+1E6F><U+00E2><U+1E07><U+00E2>}}'', 'handwriting'). The 'construct' state is a truncated form of the noun used to make possessive phrases (for example, ''{{unicode|k<U+1E6F><U+0101><U+1E07>a<U+1E6F> malk<U+1E6F><U+00E2>}}'', 'the handwriting of the queen). The 'emphatic' or 'determined' state is an extended form of the noun that functions a bit like a definite article (which Aramaic lacks; for example, ''{{unicode|k<U+1E6F><U+0101><U+1E07>t<U+00E2>}}'', 'the handwriting'). In time, the construct state began to be replaced by other possessive phrases, and the emphatic state became the norm in most dialects. Most dialects of Modern Aramaic use only the emphatic state.

The various forms of possessive phrases (for 'the handwriting of the queen') are:
# ''{{unicode|K<U+1E6F><U+0101><U+1E07>a<U+1E6F> malk<U+1E6F><U+00E2>}}'' <U+2014> The oldest construction: the possessed object is in the construct state.
# ''{{unicode|K<U+1E6F><U+0101><U+1E07>t<U+00E2> d(<U+00EE>)-malk<U+1E6F><U+00E2>}}'' <U+2014> Both words are in the emphatic state and the relative particle ''d(<U+00EE>)-'' is used to mark the relationship.
# ''{{unicode|K<U+1E6F><U+0101><U+1E07>t<U+0101>h d(<U+00EE>)-malk<U+1E6F><U+00E2>}}'' <U+2014> Both words are in the emphatic state, and the relative particle is used, but the possessed is given an anticipatory, pronominal ending (literally, 'her writing, that (of) the queen').
In Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common. In Biblical Aramaic, the last form is virtually absent.{{listen|filename=kthovath malktho.ogg|title=Different variations of the possessive construction in Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The Aramaic verb has six 'conjugations' or stems: alterations to the verbal root that can mark the [[grammatical voice|passive voice]] (''{{unicode|e<U+1E6F>k<U+1E6F>e<U+1E07>}}'', 'it was written'), intensive (''{{unicode|katte<U+1E07>}}'', 'he decreed (in writing)'), the extensive (''{{unicode|a<U+1E35>te<U+1E07>}}'', 'he composed') or a combination of these. Aramaic also has two proper [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: the perfect and the imperfect. In Imperial Aramaic, the [[participle]] began to be used for a [[historic present]]. Perhaps under influence from other languages, Middle Aramaic developed a system of composite tenses (combinations of forms of the verb with pronouns or an [[auxiliary verb]]), allowing for narrative that is more vivid.

The syntax of Aramaic (the way sentences are put together) usually follows the order verb-subject-object (VSO).  Imperial (Persian) Aramaic, however, tended to follow a S-O-V pattern (similar to Akkadian), which was the result of Persian syntactic influence.

==Aramaic word processors==

The World's first Aramaic language [[word processor|word processing software]] was developed in 1986<U+2013>87 in [[Kuwait]] by a young information technology professional named Sunil Sivanand, who is now Managing Director and Chief Technology Architect at [[Acette]]. Sunil Sivanand did most of the character generation and programming work on a first generation twin disk drive [[IBM PC]]. The project was sponsored by Daniel Benjamin, who was a patron of a group of individuals working worldwide to preserve and revive the Aramaic language.
