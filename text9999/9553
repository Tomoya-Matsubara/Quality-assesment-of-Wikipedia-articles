{{wikiquote}}
'''Eric John Ernest Hobsbawm''', [[Companion of Honour|CH]], [[British Academy|FBA]], [[FRSL]] (9 June 1917 <U+2013> 1 October 2012) was a British [[Marxist]] historian of the rise of industrial capitalism. His best-known works include his  trilogy about the [[long 19th century]] (''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789<U+2013>1848]]'', ''[[The Age of Capital: 1848<U+2013>1875]]''; ''[[The Age of Empire: 1875<U+2013>1914]]''), ''[[The Age of Extremes]]'' on the [[short 20th century]]; and an edited volume which introduced the influential idea of "[[invented traditions]]".
	
Hobsbawm's family, which was Jewish, was living in Egypt when Hobsbawm was born. They moved to [[Vienna]], Austria two years later, and from there to [[Berlin]], Germany. Following the death of his parents and the rise to power of [[Hitler]], Hobsbawm moved to [[London]], England, with his adoptive family and obtained his [[PhD]] in History at the [[University of Cambridge]], before serving in [[World War II]]. In 1947 he secured a job lecturing at [[Birkbeck College, London]], but was not promoted till 1970, a lag he attributed to his political views. In 2008, the historian [[Tony Judt]] summed up Hobsbawm's career this way:<blockquote>Eric J. Hobsbawn was a brilliant historian in the great English tradition of narrative history. On everything he touched he wrote much better, had usually read much more, and had a broader and subtler understanding than his more fashionable emulators. If he had not been a lifelong Communist he would be remembered simply as one of the great historians of the 20th century.<ref name="nytobit">William Grimes, [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/arts/eric-hobsbawm-british-historian-dies-at-95.html "Eric J. Hobsbawm, Historian With a Communist Resolve, Dies at 95"], ''New York Times, October 1, 2012.</ref></blockquote>'''

==Early life and education==
Hobsbawm was born in 1917 at [[Alexandria]], Egypt, to Leopold Percy Hobsbaum (''n<U+00E9>'' '''Obstbaum'''), a merchant from the East End of London who was of [[Russian Poland|Polish]] [[British Jews |Jewish descent]],<ref>William Grimes, ''New York Times'' (Oct. 1, 2012)</ref> and Nelly (Gr<U+00FC>n), who was from a middle-class [[Austrian Jews|Austrian Jewish]] family background. His early childhood was spent in [[Vienna]], Austria, and [[Berlin]], Germany. A clerical error at birth altered his surname from Hobsbaum to Hobsbawm.<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/> Although the family lived in German-speaking [[German-speaking Europe|countries]], his parents spoke to him and his younger sister Nancy in English.

In 1929, when Hobsbawm was 12, his father died, and he started contributing to his family's support by working as an ''[[au pair]]'' and English tutor. Upon the death of their mother two years later (in 1931), he and Nancy were adopted by their maternal aunt, Gretl, and paternal uncle, Sidney, who married and had a son named Peter. Hobsbawm was a student at the Prinz Heinrich-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] Berlin (today Friedrich-List-School) when [[Hitler]] came to power in 1933; that year the family moved to London, where Hobsbawm enrolled in [[St Marylebone Grammar School]] (now defunct).<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/> 

Hobsbawm attended [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he was elected to the [[Cambridge Apostles]]. He received a [[doctorate]] (PhD) in History from [[Cambridge University]] for his dissertation on the [[Fabian Society]]. During World War II, he served in the [[Royal Engineers]] and the [[Royal Army Educational Corps]].

==Personal life==
Hobsbawm's first marriage to Muriel Seaman in 1943 ended in divorce in 1951.<ref name="nytobit" /> His second marriage was to Marlene Schwarz, with whom he had two children, Julia Hobsbawm and [[Andy Hobsbawm]]. Julia is chief executive of Hobsbawm Media and Marketing and a Visiting Professor of [[Public Relations]] at the [[London College of Communication|College of Communication]], [[University of the Arts London]].<ref name="My Life In Media"/><ref name="Author profile: Julia Hobsbawm"/> He also had a son, Joshua Bennathan,<ref name="nytobit" /> from a previous relationship.

Hobsbawm was President of [[Birkbeck, University of London]] for ten years until his death.<ref name="Officers of the College"/> In 1998 he was appointed to the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]], a UK national honour bestowed for outstanding achievement in the arts, literature, music, science, politics, industry or religion<ref name="Companions of Honour"/> (fellow recipients included in 2011 [[Douglas Hurd]], former British Foreign Secretary, [[Norman Tebbit]], former Secretary of State of Employment under [[Margaret Thatcher]], and former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[John Major|Sir John Major]]). In 2003 he was the recipient of the [[Balzan Prize]] for European History since 1900, "For his brilliant analysis of the troubled history of twentieth-century Europe and for his ability to combine in-depth historical research with great literary talent."

==Death==
In the early hours of 1 October 2012, at the age of 95, Hobsbawm died at the [[Royal Free Hospital]], [[London]] after a long illness.<ref name="Historian Eric Hobsbawm dies, aged 95"/> His daughter Julia confirmed that he died of [[pneumonia]]. She said, {{quote|He'd been quietly fighting [[leukemia]] for a number of years without fuss or fanfare. Right up until the end he was keeping up what he did best, he was keeping up with current affairs, there was a stack of newspapers by his bed."<ref name="Historian Eric Hobsbawm dies at 95"/>}}

==Works==
Hobsbawm wrote extensively on many subjects as one of Britain's most prominent historians. As a [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historiographer]] he has focused on analysis of the "[[dual revolution]]" (the political [[French Revolution]] and the [[Industrial Revolution|British industrial revolution]]). He saw their effect as a driving force behind the predominant trend towards [[liberal capitalism]] today. Another recurring theme in his work was [[social bandits|social banditry]], a phenomenon that Hobsbawm tried to place within the confines of relevant societal and historical context, thus countering the traditional view of it being a spontaneous and unpredictable form of primitive rebellion.<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/><ref name="nationalismproject"/><ref name="DeLong AoE review"/><ref name="UCLA 2004"/><ref name="The Age of EJH"/><ref name="Book Reviews: Eric Hobsbawm"/><ref name="Author profile: Eric Hobsbawm"/> He also coined the term "[[long nineteenth century]]", which begins with the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 and ended with the start of [[World War I|The Great War]] in 1914.

Outside his academic historical writing, Hobsbawm wrote a regular column (under the pseudonym Francis Newton', taken from the name of [[Billie Holiday]]'s communist trumpet player, [[William Frank Newton|Frankie Newton]]) for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' as a [[jazz]] critic, and time to time over popular music such as with his "Beatles and before" article.<ref name="Beatles and before"/> He published numerous essays in various intellectual journals, dealing with subjects such as [[barbarity]] in the [[modern age]], the troubles of [[labour movement]]s, and the conflict between [[anarchism]] and communism. Among his final publications were ''Globalisation, Democracy and Terrorism'' (2007), ''On Empire'' (2008), and the collection of essays ''How to Change the World: Marx and Marxism 1840<U+2013>2011'' (2011).

==Academia==
In 1947, he became a [[Lecturer]] in [[History]] at Birkbeck. He became [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in 1959, [[Professor#Most_English-speaking_countries|Professor]] between 1970<U+2013>82 and an [[Emeritus Professor]] of History 1982. He was a Fellow between 1949<U+2013>55 of King's College, Cambridge.<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/> Hobsbawm spoke of the weaker version of [[McCarthyism]] that took hold in Britain and affected Marxist academics: "you didn't get promotion for 10 years, but nobody threw you out".<ref name = "Ascherson 1994"/> Hobsbawm was also denied a lectureship at Cambridge by political enemies, and, given that he was also blocked for a time from a professorship at Birkbeck for the same reasons, spoke of his good fortune at having got a post at Birkbeck in 1948 before the Cold War really started to take off.<ref name = "Ascherson 1994"/> [[David Pryce-Jones]] has questioned the existence of such career obstacles.<ref name = "DPJ Jan2003"/>

Hobsbawm helped found the academic journal ''[[Past & Present]]'' in 1952.<ref name = "Ascherson 1994"/> He was a Visiting Professor at [[Stanford]] in the 1960s. In 1970, he was appointed Professor and in 1978 he became a Fellow of the [[British Academy]]. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Science]]s in 1971 and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 2006.<ref name="AAAS"/>

He retired in 1982 but stayed as Visiting Professor at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[Manhattan]] between 1984<U+2013>97. He was,  until his death, President of Birkbeck (from 2002) and [[Professor Emeritus]] in The New School for Social Research in the [[Political Science]] Department. A most proficient linguist, he spoke German, English, French, Spanish and Italian fluently, and read [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]].<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/>

==Politics==
Hobsbawm joined the ''{{lang|de|Sozialistischer Sch<U+00FC>lerbund}}'' (Association of Socialist Pupils), an offshoot of the [[Young Communist League of Germany]], in Berlin in 1931,<ref name = "Ascherson 1994"/> and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] in 1936. He was a member of the Communist Party Historians Group from 1946 to 1956. The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] in 1956 led most of its members to leave the British Communist Party. Hobsbawm, uniquely among his notable colleagues, remained in the Party. He denounced the USSR's crimes and abuses as early as 1956 and characterised the [[Pozna<U+0144> 1956 protests|Polish]] and the Hungarian uprisings as "revolts of workers and intellectuals against bureaucracies and pseudo-communist political systems".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} He signed a historians' letter of protest against the Soviet invasion of Hungary and was strongly in favour of the [[Prague spring]].<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/>

Hobsbawm was later a leading light of the [[Eurocommunism|Eurocommunist]] faction in the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|CPGB]] that began to gather strength after 1968, when the CPGB criticised the Soviet crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] and the [[French Communist Party|French CP]] failed to support the [[May 1968 in France|May students]] in Paris.<ref name = "LLT 56"/> In "The Forward March of Labour Halted?" (originally a Marx Memorial Lecture, "The British Working Class One Hundred Years after Marx", that was delivered to a small audience of fellow Marxists in March 1978 before being published in ''[[Marxism Today]]'' in September 1978), he argued that the working class was inevitably losing its central role in society, and that left-wing parties could no longer appeal only to this class; a controversial viewpoint in a period of trade union militancy.<ref name = "LLT 56"/><ref name="The Forward March of Labour Halted?"/> Hobsbawm supported [[Neil Kinnock]]'s transformation of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] from 1983 (the party received just 28% of the vote in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|that year's elections]], just 2% more than than the Social Democratic Party/Liberal Alliance), and, though not close to Kinnock, came to be referred to as "Neil Kinnock's Favourite Marxist".<ref name = "LLT 56"/> His interventions in Kinnock's remaking of the Labour Party helped prepare the ground for the [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]], [[New Labour]], and [[Tony Blair]],<ref name = "LLT 56"/> whom Hobsbawm later derisively referred to as "Thatcher in trousers".<ref name="Man of the extreme century"/> Until the cessation of publication in 1991, he contributed to the magazine ''Marxism Today''. A third of the 30 reprints of ''Marxism Today''s feature articles that appeared in ''The Guardian'' during the 1980s were articles or interviews by or with Hobsbawm, making him by far the most popular of all contributors.<ref name="LLT 56"/> From the 1960s, his politics took a more moderate turn, as Hobsbawm came to recognize that his hopes were unlikely to be realized, and no longer advocated "socialist systems of the Soviet type".<ref name="Socialism has failed. Now capitalism is bankrupt. So what comes next?"/> Until the day of his death, however, he remained firmly entrenched on the Left, and maintaining that the long-term outlooks for humanity were 'bleak'.<ref name="Interview with Eric Hobsbawm on his 90th birthday"/><ref name="Eric Hobsbawm: Observer special"/><ref name="Eric Hobsbawm and the working class"/><ref name="The lion of the Left"/><ref name="Diary"/>

===Miscellaneous views===
Regarding [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], Hobsbawm stated that constitutional monarchy in general has "proved a reliable framework for liberal-democratic regimes" and "is likely to remain useful".<ref name="Prospect 181"/> On [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the nuclear attacks on Japan]] in WWII, he adhered to the view that "there was even less sign of a crack in Japan's determination to fight to the end [compared with that of Nazi Germany], which is why nuclear arms were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to ensure a rapid Japanese surrender",<ref name="extremes"/> though believed there was an ancillary political, non-military reason for the bombings: "perhaps the thought that it would prevent America's ally the USSR from establishing a claim to a major part in Japan's defeat was not absent from the minds of the US government either."<ref name="extremes1"/>

==Praise and criticism==
In 1994, [[Neal Ascherson]] said of Hobsbawm: "No historian now writing in English can match his overwhelming command of fact and source. But the key word is 'command'. Hobsbawm's capacity to store and retrieve detail has now reached a scale normally approached only by large archives with big staffs."<ref name="Ascherson 1994"/> In 2002, Hobsbawm was described by right-leaning magazine ''[[The Spectator]]'' as "arguably our greatest living historian<U+2014>not only Britain's, but the world's",<ref name="Spectator 19 October 2002"/> while [[Niall Ferguson]] wrote: "That Hobsbawm is one of the great historians of his generation is undeniable. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His quartet of books beginning with ''The Age of Revolution'' and ending with ''The Age of Extremes'' constitute the best starting point I know for anyone who wishes to begin studying modern history. Nothing else produced by the British Marxist historians will endure as these books will."<ref name="Ferg review"/> In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as "one of the great British historians of his age, an unapologetic Communist and a polymath whose erudite, elegantly written histories are still widely read in schools here and abroad."<ref name="WSJ 20 August 2011"/> [[James Joll]] wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that "Eric Hobsbawm's nineteenth century trilogy is one of the great achievements of historical writing in recent decades."<ref name="extremes2"/> [[Ian Kershaw]] said that Hobsbawm's take on the twentieth century, his 1994 book, ''[[The Age of Extremes]]'', consisted of "masterly analysis".{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=597, note 1}} Meanwhile, [[Tony Judt]], while praising Hobsbawm's vast knowledge and graceful prose, cautioned that Hobsbawm's bias in favour of the [[USSR]], [[communist state]]s and communism in general, and his tendency to disparage any nationalist movement as passing and irrational, weakened his grasp of parts of the 20th century.<ref name="NYRB "/>

With regard to the impact of his Marxist outlook and sympathies on his scholarship, [[Ben Pimlott]] saw it as "a tool not a straitjacket; he's not dialectical or following a party line", although Judt argued that it has "prevented his achieving the analytical distance he does on the 19th century: he isn't as interesting on the Russian revolution because he can't free himself completely from the optimistic vision of earlier years. For the same reason he's not that good on fascism."<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/>

British historian [[David Pryce-Jones]] conceded that Hobsbawm was "no doubt intelligent and industrious, and he might well have made a notable contribution as a historian", but also charged that, as a professional historian who has "steadily corrupted knowledge into propaganda, and scorns the concept of objective truth", he was "neither a historian nor professional."<ref name="DPJ Jan2003"/> [[J. Bradford DeLong|Brad DeLong]] strongly criticised ''Age of Extremes'': "The remains of Hobsbawm's commitment to the religion of World Communism get in the way of his judgment, and twist his vision. On planet Hobsbawm, for example, the fall of the Soviet Union was a disaster, and the Revolutions of 1989 a defeat for humanity. On planet Hobsbawm, Stalin planned multi-party democracies and mixed economies for Eastern Europe after World War II, and reconsidered only after the United States launched the Cold War."<ref name="DeLong AoE review"/> After reading ''Age of Extremes'', Kremlinologist [[Robert Conquest]] concluded that Hobsbawm suffers from a "massive reality denial" regarding the USSR,<ref name="WSJ 20 August 2011"/> and [[John N. Gray|John Gray]], though praising his work on the nineteenth century, has described Hobsbawm's writings on the post-1914 period as "banal in the extreme. They are also highly evasive. A vast silence surrounds the realities of communism, a refusal to engage which led the late Tony Judt to conclude that Hobsbawm had 'provincialised himself'. It is a damning judgement".<ref name="NS 20 January 2011"/>

Conquest has claimed that in 1994, in an interview with Canadian author and politician [[Michael Ignatieff]] on British television, Hobsbawm responded in the affirmative to the question of whether 20 million deaths may have been justified had the proposed communist [[utopia]] been created.<ref name="Times 23 July 2004"/> The following year, when asked the same question on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'', that is if "the sacrifice of millions of lives" would have been worth a communist utopia, he replied: "That's what we felt when we fought the Second World War".<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/> Hobsbawm has similarly argued that, "In a period in which, as you might imagine, mass murder and mass suffering are absolutely universal, the chance of a new world being born in great suffering would still have been worth backing".<ref name="WashTimes 31 March 2003"/>

Tony Judt opined that Hobsbawm "clings to a pernicious illusion of the late Enlightenment: that if one can promise a benevolent outcome it would be worth the human cost. But one of the great lessons of the 20th century is that it's not true. For such a clear-headed writer, he appears blind to the sheer scale of the price paid. I find it tragic, rather than disgraceful."<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/> Neil Ascherson believes that, "Eric is not a man for apologising or feeling guilty. He does feel bad about the appalling waste of lives in Soviet communism. But he refuses to acknowledge that he regrets anything. He's not that kind of person."<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/> Hobsbawm himself, in his autobiography, wrote that he desires "historical understanding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not agreement, approval or sympathy".<ref name="Interesting Times"/>

Hobsbawm stressed that since the utopia had not been created, the sacrifices were in fact not justified<U+2014>a point he emphasised in ''Age of Extremes'':
{{blockquote|Still, whatever assumptions are made, the number of direct and indirect victims must be measured in eight rather than seven digits. In these circumstances it does not much matter whether we opt for a "conservative" estimate nearer to ten than to twenty million or a larger figure: none can be anything but shameful and beyond palliation, let alone justification. I add, without comment, that the total population of the USSR in 1937 was said to have been 164 millions, or 16.7 millions less than the demographic forecasts of the Second Five-Year Plan (1933<U+2013>38).<ref name="Hobs_1994 p_393"/>}}

Elsewhere he has insisted:{{quote|I have never tried to diminish the appalling things that happened in Russia, though the sheer extent of the massacres we didn't realise.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the early days we knew a new world was being born amid blood and tears and horror: revolution, civil war, famine<U+2014>we knew of the Volga famine of the early '20s, if not the early '30s. Thanks to the breakdown of the west, we had the illusion that even this brutal, experimental, system was going to work better than the west. It was that or nothing.<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002" />}} With regard to the 1930s, he has written that{{quote|It is impossible to understand the reluctance of men and women on the left to criticise, or even often to admit to themselves, what was happening in the USSR in those years, or the isolation of the USSR's critics on the left, without this sense that in the fight against fascism, communism and liberalism were, in a profound sense, fighting for the same cause. Not to mention the more obvious fact .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that, in the conditions of the 1930s, what Stalin did was a Russian problem, however shocking, whereas what Hitler did was a threat everywhere.<ref name="Hobs_2011 p_268"/>}} Gina Herrmann, in her 2010 study of Spanish communists' memoirs,{{sfn|Herrmann|2010|p=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qfL06dTmHyYC&pg=PR9&dq=%22of+the+many+myths+that+western+communists+lived+by+perhaps+the+most+abiding+is+that+of+communist+anti-fascism+of+the+1930s+and+1940s%22+%22one+that+was+consolidated+in+Spain's+civil+war%22 ix]}} claimed that "of the many myths that Western Communists lived by, perhaps the most abiding is that of Communist anti-Fascism of the 1930s and 1940s<U+2014>one that was consolidated in Spain's Civil War of 1936<U+2013>1939." However, the profound fascist/anti-fascist schism of the period described by Hobsbawm was real enough, as [[Yale]] historian [[Timothy Snyder]] notes:{{quote|For many Europeans and Americans, the show trials were simply trials, and confessions were reliable evidence of guilt. Some observers who were sympathetic to the Soviet Union saw them as a positive development: the British socialist Beatrice Webb, for example, was pleased that Stalin had "cut out the dead wood." Other Soviet sympathizers no doubt suppressed their suspicions, on the logic that the USSR was the enemy of Nazi Germany and thus the hope of civilization. European public opinion was so polarized by 1936 that it was indeed difficult to criticize the Soviet regime without seeming to endorse fascism and Hitler.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=74}}}} Nevertheless, Snyder also claimed that "The Spanish Civil War revealed that Stalin was determined, despite the Popular Front rhetoric of pluralism, to eliminate opposition to his version of socialism", and that his determination was knowable and known even contemporaneously (Snyder cites [[George Orwell]]'s analysis of, and dismay at, communist actions in Spain).{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=75}} On the communist role in Spain, Hobsbawm writes simply that "its pros and cons continue to be discussed in the political and historical literature",<ref name="Hobs_2004 p_76"/> and refers to Orwell, not by his literary name, but as "an upper-class Englishman called Eric Blair".<ref name = "DPJ Jan2003"/><ref name="Hobs_2002 p_86"/> He also claimed that the demise of the USSR was "traumatic not only for communists but for socialists everywhere",<ref name="Hobs_2011 p_386"/> a statement that led journalist [[Francis Wheen]] to retort: "Speak for yourself, comrade. I, like many other socialists, greeted the fall of the Soviet model with unqualified rejoicing; and I don't doubt that Karl Marx would have been celebrating. His favourite motto, ''de omnibus disputandum'' ('everything should be questioned'), was not one that had any currency in the realm of 'actually existing socialism'<U+2014>a hideous hybrid of mendacity, thuggery and incompetence."<ref name="Wheen FT"/>

The 1930s aside, Hobsbawm was criticised for never relinquishing his Communist Party membership. Whereas people like [[Arthur Koestler]] left the Party after seeing the friendly reception of Nazi foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in Moscow during the years of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (1939-1941),{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BQ1HKmG9xZ8C&pg=PA116 116]}} Hobsbawm stood firm even after the Soviet invasions of [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary]] and [[Prague Spring|Czechoslovakia]], though he was against them both.<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/><ref name="WSJ 20 August 2011"/> In his review of Hobsbawm's 2002 memoirs, ''Interesting Times'', Niall Ferguson wrote:

{{quote|The essence of Communism is the abnegation of individual freedom, as Hobsbawm admits in a chilling passage: "The Party .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had the first, or more precisely the only real claim on our lives. Its demands had absolute priority. We accepted its discipline and hierarchy. We accepted the absolute obligation to follow 'the lines' it proposed to us, even when we disagreed with it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We did what it ordered us to do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whatever it had ordered, we would have obeyed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If the Party ordered you to abandon your lover or spouse, you did so."

Consider some of the "lines" our historian dutifully toed. He accepted the order to side with the Nazis against the Weimar-supporting Social Democrats in the great Berlin transport strike of 1932. He accepted the order to side with the Nazis against Britain and France following the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact of 1939. He accepted the excommunication of Tito. He condoned the show trials of men like Laszlo Rajk in Hungary.

In 1954, just after Stalin's death, he visited Moscow as one of the honoured members of the Historians' Group of the British Communist Party. He admits to having been dismayed when, two years later, Khrushchev denounced Stalin's crimes at the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. When Khrushchev himself ordered the tanks into Budapest, Hobsbawm finally spoke up, publishing a letter of protest. But he did not leave the Party.<ref name = "Ferg review"/>}}Hobsbawm let his membership lapse not long before the party's dissolution in 1991.<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/> In his review of Hobsbawm's memoirs, David Pryce-Jones accuses him of actually supporting the invasion of Hungary:

{{quote|[H]e carefully makes sure not to quote the letter he published on 9 November 1956 in the Communist ''Daily Worker'' defending the Soviet onslaught on Hungary: "While approving, with a heavy heart, of what is now happening in Hungary, we should therefore also say frankly that we think the USSR should withdraw its troops from the country as soon as this is possible." Which is more deceitful, the spirit of this letter, or the omission of any reference to it [in his memoirs]?<ref name = "DPJ Jan2003"/>}}

In those memoirs, Hobsbawn wrote: "The dream of the October Revolution is still there somewhere inside me &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have abandoned, nay, rejected it, but it has not been obliterated. To this day, I notice myself treating the memory and tradition of the USSR with an indulgence and tenderness."<ref name="Hobs_2002 p_56"/> Reviewing the book, [[David Caute]] wrote: "One keeps asking of Hobsbawm: didn't you know what Deutscher and Orwell knew? Didn't you know about the induced famine, the horrors of collectivisation, the false confessions, the terror within the Party, the massive forced labour of the gulag? As Orwell himself documented, a great deal of evidence was reliably knowable even before 1939, but Hobsbawm pleads that much of it was not reliably knowable until Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956."<ref name="Spectator 19 October 2002"/>

Reviewing Hobsbawm's 2011 ''How to Change the World'' in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[Michael C. Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]] argued:{{quote|When the bloody history of 20th-century communism intrudes upon Mr. Hobsbawm's disquisitions, it's quickly dismissed. Of the countries occupied by the Soviet Union after World War II<U+2014>"the Second World War," he says with characteristic slipperiness, "led communist parties to power" in Eastern and Central Europe<U+2014>he explains that a "possible critique of the new [postwar] socialist regimes does not concern us here." Why did communist regimes share the characteristics of state terror, oppression and murder? "To answer this question is not part of the present chapter." Regarding the execrable pact between Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, which shocked many former communist sympathizers into lives of anticommunism, Mr. Hobsbawm dismisses the "zig-zags and turns of Comintern and Soviet policy," specifically the "about-turn of 1939<U+2013>41," which "need not detain us here." In one sense, Mr. Hobsbawm's admirers are right about his erudition: He possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of Marxist thought, specifically Italian communism and pre-Soviet socialist movements. But that knowledge is wasted when used to write untrustworthy history.<ref name="WSJ 20 August 2011" />}} Reviewing the same book, Francis Wheen argued in a similar vein: "When writing about how the anti-fascist campaigns of the 1930s brought new recruits to the communist cause, he cannot even bring himself to mention the Hitler-Stalin pact, referring only to 'temporary episodes such as 1939<U+2013>41'. The Soviet invasion of Hungary and the crushing of the Prague Spring are skipped over."<ref name = "Wheen FT"/>

David Evanier, in an article published in the American conservative magazine ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', called Hobsbawm "Stalin's cheerleader," writing: "One can learn almost nothing about the history of communism from Hobsbawm's ''Interesting Times''<U+2014>nothing about the show trials, the torture and execution of millions, the Communist betrayal of Spain."<ref name="WeekStan 19 May 2003"/>
