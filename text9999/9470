In contemporary research and clinical practice, [[Robert Hare (psychologist)|Robert D. Hare's]] '''Psychopathy Checklist-Revised''' ('''PCL-R''') is the psycho-diagnostic tool most commonly used to assess [[psychopathy]].<ref>Leam Craig, Kevin Browne, Anthony R. Beech (2008) [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ey6wg5PieSsC&pg=PA117 ''Assessing Risk in Sex Offenders''] p. 117 John Wiley and Sons, ISBN 0470018984</ref> Because an individual's score may have important consequences for his or her future, and because the potential for harm if the test is used or administered incorrectly is considerable, the test should only be considered valid if administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under controlled conditions.<ref name=hare1>Hare, R. D. (2003). Manual for the Revised Psychopathy Checklist (2nd ed.). Toronto, ON, Canada: Multi-Health Systems.</ref><ref name=hare2>Hare, R. D., & Neumann, C. N. (2006).

==PCL-R Model of psychopathy==
The PCL-R is a clinical rating scale (rated by a psychologist or other professional) of 20 items. Each of the items in the PCL-R is scored on a three-point scale according to specific criteria through file information and a [[semi-structured interview]]. A value of 0 is assigned if the item does not apply, 1 if it applies somewhat, and 2 if it fully applies. In addition to lifestyle and criminal behavior the checklist assesses glib and [[superficial charm]], [[grandiosity]], need for stimulation, pathological lying, conning and manipulating, lack of remorse, callousness, poor behavioral controls, impulsivity, irresponsibility, failure to accept responsibility for one's own actions and so forth.  The scores are used to predict risk for criminal re-offence and probability of rehabilitation.  

The current edition of the PCL-R officially lists four factors (1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b), which summarize the 20 assessed areas via [[factor analysis]]. The previous edition of the PCL-R<ref>The Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised by Robert D. Hare, 1991. Multi-Health Systems, 908 Niagara Falls Blvd, North Tonawanda, New York, USA, 14120-2060</ref> listed two factors. Factor 1 is labelled "selfish, callous and remorseless use of others".  Factor 2 is labelled as "chronically unstable, antisocial and socially deviant lifestyle".  There is a high risk of recidivism and currently small likelihood of rehabilitation for those who are labelled as having "psychopathy" on the basis of the PCL-R ratings in the manual for the test, although treatment research is ongoing.

PCL-R Factors 1a and 1b are correlated with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and [[histrionic personality disorder]]. It is associated with extroversion and positive affect. Factor 1, the so-called core personality traits of psychopathy, may even be beneficial for the psychopath (in terms of nondeviant social functioning).

PCL-R Factor 2a and 2b are particularly strongly correlated to [[antisocial personality disorder]] and criminality and is associated with reactive anger, criminality, and impulsive violence. The target group for the PCL-R is convicted criminals.  The quality of ratings may depend on how much background information is available and whether the person rated is honest and forthright.

==Hare's Checklist and  other mental disorders==
Psychopathy, as measured on the PCL-R, is negatively correlated with all [[DSM-IV]] Axis I disorders except [[substance abuse]] disorders. Psychopathy is most strongly correlated with DSM-IV [[antisocial personality disorder]]. 

'''Factor1: Personality  "Aggressive narcissism"'''

*Glibness/[[superficial charm]] 
*[[Grandiosity|Grandiose]] sense of self-worth 
*Pathological [[Lie|lying]] 
*Conning/[[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] 
*Lack of [[remorse]] or [[guilt]] 
*Shallow affect 
*Callous/lack of [[empathy]] 
*Failure to accept responsibility for own actions 

'''Factor2: Case history "Socially deviant lifestyle"'''

*Need for stimulation/proneness to boredom 
*Parasitic lifestyle 
*Poor behavioral control 
*Promiscuous sexual behavior 
*Lack of realistic, long-term goals 
*Impulsivity 
*Irresponsibility 
*Juvenile delinquency 
*Early behavior problems 
*Revocation of conditional release

'''Traits not correlated with either factor'''

*Many short-term marital relationships 
*Criminal versatility 

The official stance of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] as presented in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] is that psychopathy and sociopathy are obsolete synonyms for [[antisocial personality disorder]]. The [[World Health Organization]] takes a similar stance in its [[ICD|ICD-10]] by referring to psychopathy, sociopathy, antisocial personality, asocial personality, and amoral personality as synonyms for [[dissocial personality disorder]].

Among laypersons and professionals, there is much confusion about the meanings and differences between psychopathy, sociopathy, antisocial personality disorder, and the [[ICD-10]] diagnosis, dissocial personality disorder.  
Hare takes the stance that psychopathy as a syndrome should be considered distinct from the DSM-IV's antisocial personality disorder construct,<ref>Hare, R. D. [http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p960239.html Psychopathy and Antisocial Personality Disorder: A Case of Diagnostic Confusion, Psychiatric Times, February 1996, XIII, Issue 2] Accessed June 26, 2006</ref>  even though ASPD and psychopathy were intended to be equivalent in the DSM-IV. However, those who created the DSM-IV felt that there was too much room for [[subjectivity]] on the part of [[clinicians]] when identifying things like remorse and guilt; therefore, the DSM-IV panel decided to stick to observable behaviour, namely socially [[deviant]] behaviours.  

As a result, the diagnosis of ASPD is something that the "majority of criminals easily meet."<ref>Hare, Robert D.  ''Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of Psychopaths Among Us,'' (New York: Pocket Books, 1993) pg 25.</ref>  Hare goes further to say that the percentage of incarcerated criminals that meet the requirements of ASPD is somewhere between 80 to 85 percent, whereas only about 20% of these criminals would qualify for a diagnosis of what Hare's scale considers to be a psychopath.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rutherford MJ, Cacciola JS, Alterman AI |title=Antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy in cocaine-dependent women |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=156 |issue=6 |pages=849<U+2013>56 |year=1999 |pmid=10360122 |doi=}}</ref>  This twenty percent, according to Hare, accounts for 50 percent of all the most serious crimes committed, including half of all serial and repeat [[rape|rapists]].  According to [[FBI]] reports, 44 percent of all police officer murders in 1992 were committed by psychopaths.<ref>Hare, Robert D.  ''Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of Psychopaths Among Us,'' (New York: Pocket Books, 1993) pg 25-30.</ref>

Another study using the PCL-R to examine the relationship between antisocial behaviour and [[suicide]] found that suicide history was strongly correlated to PCL-R Factor 2 (reflecting antisocial deviance) and was not correlated to PCL-R factor 1 (reflecting affective functioning).  Given that ASPD relates to Factor 2, whereas psychopathy relates to both factors, this would confirm Hervey Cleckley's assertion that psychopaths are relatively immune to suicide. People with ASPD, on the other hand, have a relatively high suicide rate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Verona E, Patrick CJ, Joiner TE |title=Psychopathy, antisocial personality, and suicide risk |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=110 |issue=3 |pages=462<U+2013>70 |year=2001 |pmid=11502089 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.110.3.462}}</ref>

Since psychopaths frequently cause harm through their actions, it is assumed that they are not emotionally attached to the people they harm; however, according to the [[PCL-R Checklist]], psychopaths are also careless in the way they treat themselves.  They frequently fail to alter their behavior in a way that would prevent them from enduring future discomfort.

In practice, mental health professionals rarely treat psychopathic personality disorders as they are considered untreatable and no interventions have proved to be effective.<ref>[http://www.ramas.co.uk/report3.pdf The Treatment of Psychopathic and Antisocial Personality Disorders: A Review - Jessica H Lee, BSc., MSc., M.Phil.] Clinical Decision Making Support Unit, Broadmoor Hospital</ref> In [[England]] and [[Wales]] the diagnosis of [[dissocial personality disorder]] is grounds for detention in secure [[psychiatric hospital]]s under the [[Mental Health Act 1983|Mental Health Act]] if they have committed serious crimes, but since such individuals are disruptive for other patients and not responsive to treatment this alternative to [[prison]] is not often used.<ref>{{cite book

Because an individual's scores may have important consequences for his or her future, the potential for harm if the test is used or administered incorrectly is considerable. The test can only be considered valid if administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under controlled conditions. <ref name=hare1>Hare, R. D. (2003).

Hare wants the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' to list psychopathy as a unique disorder, saying psychopathy has no precise equivalent<ref name=hare1>Hare, R. D. [http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=192300193 Psychopathy and Antisocial Personality Disorder: A Case of Diagnostic Confusion, Psychiatric Times, February 1996, XIII, Issue 2] Accessed June 26, 2006</ref> in either the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]]'', where it is most strongly correlated with the diagnosis of [[antisocial personality disorder]], or the ''[[ICD|ICD-10]]'', which has a partly similar condition called dissocial personality disorder. Both organizations view the terms as synonymous. But only a minority of what Hare and his followers would diagnose as psychopaths who are in institutions are violent offenders.<ref>Belmore, M.

==PCL-R Factors==
Early [[factor analysis]] of the ''[[PCL-R]]'' indicated it consisted of two factors.<ref name=factorstructure>{{cite journal|author=Harpur, T. J., Hare, R. D., & Hakstian, A. R.|title=Two-factor conceptualization of psychopathy: Construct validity and assessment implications.|journal=Psychological Assessment|volume=1|issue=1|pages=6<U+2013>17|year=1989|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.1.1.6}}</ref> Factor 1 captures traits dealing with the interpersonal and affective deficits of psychopathy (e.g. shallow affect, superficial charm, manipulativeness, lack of empathy) whereas Factor 2 dealt with symptoms relating to antisocial behaviour (e.g. criminal versatility, impulsiveness, irresponsibility, poor behaviour controls, [[juvenile delinquency]]).<ref name=factorstructure/> 

The two factors have been found by those following this theory to display different correlates. Factor 1 has been correlated with [[narcissistic personality disorder]],<ref name=factorstructure/> low anxiety,<ref name=factorstructure/> low empathy,<ref name=zagon>{{cite journal|author=Zagon, I.

Recent statistical analysis using [[confirmatory factor analysis]] by Cooke and Michie<ref name=cookemichie>{{cite journal|author=Cooke, D. J., & Michie, C. (2001)|title=Refining the construct of psychopathy: Towards a hierarchical model|journal=Psychological Assessment|volume=13|issue=2|pages=171<U+2013>188|year=2001|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.13.2.171}}</ref> indicated a three-factor structure, with those items from factor 2 strictly relating to antisocial behaviour (criminal versatility, juvenile delinquency, revocation of conditional release, early behavioural problems and poor behavioural controls) removed from the final model. The remaining items are divided into three factors: Arrogant and Deceitful Interpersonal Style, Deficient Affective Experience and Impulsive and Irresponsible Behavioural Style.<ref name=cookemichie/> 

In the most recent edition of the ''PCL-R'', Hare adds a fourth antisocial behaviour factor, consisting of those Factor 2 items excluded in the previous model.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hare, R. D.|title=Manual for the Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Revised.|publisher=Multi-Health Systems|year=2003}}</ref> Again, these models are presumed to be hierarchical with a single unified psychopathy disorder underlying the distinct but correlated factors.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cooke, D.

The Cooke & Michie hierarchical <U+2018>three<U+2019>-factor model has severe statistical problems<U+2014>i.e., it actually contains ten factors and results in impossible parameters (negative variances)<U+2014>as well as conceptual problems.

== Diagnostic criteria and PCL-R assessment ==
Psychopathy is most commonly assessed with the ''[[PCL-R]]'', <ref>Hare, 1991</ref> which is a clinical rating scale with 20 items. Each of the items in the PCL-R is scored on a three-point (0, 1, 2) scale according to two factors. ''PCL-R'' Factor 2 is associated with reactive [[anger]], [[anxiety]], increased risk of suicide, [[crime|criminality]], and impulsive violence. 

''PCL-R'' Factor 1, in contrast, is associated with [[extroversion]] and positive affect. Factor 1, the so-called core personality traits of psychopathy, may even be beneficial for the psychopath (in terms of nondeviant social functioning).  A psychopath will score high on both factors, whereas someone with APD will score high only on Factor 2.<ref>Davison, G.C., Neale, J.M., Blankstein, K.R., & Flett, G.L. (2002). ''Abnormal Psychology.'' (Etobicoke: Wiley)</ref>

Both case history and a semi-structured interview are used in the analysis.
