:''This article is about the film. For other uses of the term, see [[Jaws]]''.

'''''Jaws''''' is a [[1975 in film|1975]] [[Horror film|horror]]/[[thriller]] [[film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]],   based on [[Peter Benchley|Peter Benchley's]] best-selling novel of the [[Peter Benchley#Jaws|same name]]. The novel was inspired by actual shark attack events in American history, namely the [[Jersey Shore Shark Attacks of 1916]]. 

In the film, the police chief of [[Amity Island]], a summer resort town, tries to protect beachgoers from the predations of a huge [[great white shark]] by closing the beach, only to be overruled by the  money-grubbing town council. After several attacks, the police chief proceeds to enlist the help of a [[marine biology|marine biologist]] and later a professional shark hunter to kill the [[shark]]. The film stars [[Roy Scheider]] as police chief Martin Brody, [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as marine biologist Matt Hooper, [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as the shark hunter [[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]], [[Lorraine Gary]] as Brody's wife Ellen, and [[Murray Hamilton]] as the greedy Mayor Vaughn.  

''Jaws'' is regarded as a watershed film in motion picture history, as it is the father of the summer [[blockbuster movie]].<ref>{{cite web | work=BBC News Online|title=Rise of the blockbuster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1653733.stm| accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> Due to the film's success in advanced screenings, studio executives decided to distribute it in a much wider release than ever before. ''[[The Omen]]'' followed suit a year later in the summer of 1976, and then ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' two years later in 1977, cementing the notion for [[movie studios]] to distribute their big-release action and adventure pictures (commonly referred to as ''tentpole pictures'') during the summer season. It is thought to be the first film that advanced Steven Spielberg's directorial career.<ref>{{cite web | author=Schatz, Thomas | work=thenation.com | title=The Last Mogul |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20030630/schatz/2| accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref> The film was followed by three sequels, generally regarded as increasingly poor in quality when compared to the original: ''[[Jaws 2]]'' ([[1978 in film|1978]]),  ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]) and ''[[Jaws: The Revenge]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]). 

==Synopsis== 
{{spoiler-about|"Jaws"}}<!--Please do not add any info on Brody's fear of water!-->
The film begins at a late night beach party on Amity Island. A young woman leaves the party to go for a swim in the ocean; while in the water, she is suddenly jerked around by an unseen force and then pulled under. The next morning, Chief of Police Martin Brody (Scheider) is notified that the woman is missing, and heads out to the beach. Brody and his deputy find the girl's mangled remains, and Brody comes to the conclusion that it was a [[shark attack]]. Before he can close the beaches he is intercepted and overruled by the town's mayor, Larry Vaughn (Hamilton), who tells Brody that the girl was killed by a boat propeller. Vaughn is concerned about the incident hurting the summer tourist season, especially the upcoming 4th of July celebration, as it is the town's major source of income. After the town medical examiner backs up the mayor's story, Brody reluctantly goes along with him.  
[[image:Jaws11.jpg|left|265px|thumb|Panic on the beach.]]
A few days later, a young boy is killed by a [[shark]] while swimming at the beach, and his mother places a $3,000 [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on the animal.  The bounty sparks an amateur [[shark#Shark fishery|shark hunting]] frenzy, but it also attracts the local [[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]] (Shaw), a professional shark hunter. Quint interrupts a town meeting to offer his services, but is rejected because of his high price and/or general attitude. Marine biologist Matt Hooper (Dreyfuss) then arrives at the town harbor amidst the shark hunting frenzy and introduces himself to Brody. Hooper conducts an autopsy of the first victim, where he quickly concludes that she was killed by a shark. However, a large [[tiger shark]] is caught by a group of novice fishermen, leading the townspeople to believe that the killer is dead. Hooper is unconvinced, and asks to examine the contents of the fish's stomach to determine if it is the correct shark. Vaughn refuses to make a public spectacle of the "operation", so Brody and Hooper return after dark. They learn that the captured shark does not have human remains inside it, so they venture out in Hooper's state-of-the-art boat to scout around for the real killer. They come across a half-sunken wreckage of a local fishing vessel, and after donning [[scuba]] gear to check the hull, Hooper discovers another victim. Nevertheless, Vaughn refuses to close the beaches.

On the Fourth of July, the beaches are mobbed, and surrounded by a cordon of police boats. While a [[prank]] triggers a false alarm and draws off the authorities' attention, the real shark enters an [[estuary]] and kills another man, nearly getting one of Brody's sons as well. Brody forces the stunned mayor to close the beaches and hire Quint. Brody and Hooper join the hunter on his boat, the ''Orca'', and the trio set out to track down the man-eater. 
[[Image:Jaws photo.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]] ([[Robert Shaw]])'s fishing vessel, ''The Orca''.]]
The [[aquaphobia|aquaphobic]] Chief Brody is given the task of chumming, or shoveling a mixture of fish parts and blood into the sea to attract the shark. While Brody is engaged in the task, the enormous shark suddenly looms up behind the boat; watching it circle the ''Orca'', Quint and Hooper estimate the beast is at least 20&nbsp;ft (6&nbsp;m) long. Quint manages to harpoon it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, designed to simultaneously weigh the fish down and track it on the surface, but the shark swims away and disappears. Night falls without another sighting and the men retire to the boat's cabin, where they compare scars and Quint tells of his experience with sharks as a survivor of the World War II sinking of the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. The shark reappears, damages the boat, and slips away before the men can harm it. In the morning, the men make repairs to the engine, and Quint destroys the radio to keep Brody from calling the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] for help. The shark attacks again, and after a long chase Quint harpoons it with two more barrels. The men tie the barrels to the stern, but the shark tows the ship backwards through the water, overflooding the engine and finally ripping free.

With the ''Orca'' dead in the water, the trio try a desperate new approach. Hooper dons his scuba gear and enters the ocean inside a [[shark proof cage]]: he intends to stab the shark inside the mouth with a hypodermic needle filled with a powerful poison. The monster shark instead destroys the cage, and Hooper flees to the seabed. As Quint and Brody raise the remnants of the cage, the shark throws itself onto the boat, crushing the stern. Quint slides into its mouth, slashing at it in vain with a machete before being pulled under and devoured. Brody retreats to the boat's cabin, now partly submerged, and throws a pressurized [[Diving cylinder|air tank]] into the shark's mouth when the killer rams its way inside. Brody takes Quint's rifle and climbs the mast of the rapidly-listing boat, where he temporarily fends off the attacker with a harpoon. The shark circles around and charges one last time at Brody, who starts firing the rifle at the tank still jammed in the shark's mouth. He finally scores a hit, blowing the shark's head to pieces and sending the rest of its body to the bottom of the ocean in a cloud of blood. Hooper bobs to the surface alive and reunites with Brody, and the two survivors swim to shore using the flotation barrels as a raft.<!--Please do not add any info on Brody's fear of water-->

== Production history == 
The film was produced by [[Richard Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], who had purchased the film rights to Peter Benchley's novel in 1973 for approximately $250,000.<ref>{{cite web | work=boxoffice.com|title=Jaws (1975) |url=http://www.boxoffice.com/cgi/getclassic.pl?where=Name&terms=JAWS&searchpage=classic.html| accessdate=2006-08-07}}</ref> His novel was loosely based on a [[Jersey Shore Shark Attacks of 1916|real-life event]] in the summer of 1916 when a series of shark attacks killed four people along the New Jersey coast and triggered a media frenzy.  Though he was not their first choice as a director, the producers signed Spielberg to direct prior to the release of his first theatrical film, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'' (also a Zanuck/Brown production).

Part of the deal that Benchley struck with the producers when they purchased the rights to his novel guaranteed that the author would get to write the first draft of the screenplay.  All in all, Benchley wrote three drafts before deciding to bow out of the project.<ref name="Films of SS">Brode, Douglas. (2000) ''The Films of Steven Spielberg''. ISBN 0-8065-1951-7</ref> Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright [[Howard Sackler]] happened to be in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite, and since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchley's drafts they quickly accepted his offer.<ref name="Jaws"> ''Spotlight on Location: The Making of Jaws'', ''Jaws'' 30th Anniversary DVD documentary, [2005]</ref>  Spielberg sent the script to [[Carl Gottlieb]] (who appears in a supporting acting role in the film as Meadows, the politically connected reporter), asking for advice.<ref name="Jaws"/> Gottlieb rewrote most scenes during principal photography, and [[John Milius]] contributed dialogue polishes. Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear if the other screenwriters drew on his material. The authorship of Quint's monologue about the fate of the cruiser USS ''Indianapolis'' has caused substantial controversy as to who deserves the most credit for the speech. Spielberg tactfully describes it as a collaboration among John Milius, Howard Sackler and actor Robert Shaw. Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius' contribution.<ref>Gottlieb, Carl. (2001) ''The Jaws Log''. ISBN 0-571-20949-1</ref>

[[Image:Mechashark.JPG|thumb|210px|right|The full model mechanical shark, attached to special rigging]]
Three mechanical sharks were made for the production: a full model, for underwater shots; one that turned from left to right, with the left side completely exposed to the internal machinery; and a similar right to left model, with the right side exposed.<ref name="Films of SS"/> Their construction was supervised by production designer Joe Alves and special effects artist Bob Mattey. After the sharks were completed, they were shipped to the shooting location, but unfortunately they had not been tested in water, and when placed in the ocean the full model sank straight to the ocean floor.<ref name="Jaws"/> A team of divers was sent to retrieve it. 

Location shooting occurred on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], Massachusetts, chosen because the ocean had a sandy bottom while 12 miles out at sea.<ref name="Jaws"/> This helped the mechanical sharks to operate smoothly and still provide a realistic location. Still, the film had a troubled shoot and went considerably over budget. Shooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras were soaked, and even ''The Orca'' began to sink with the actors onboard. The mechanical shark frequently malfunctioned, due to the [[hydraulic]] innards being brutalized by [[Sea water|salt water]].<ref name="Jaws"/> The three mechanical sharks were collectively nicknamed "Bruce" by the production team after Spielberg's lawyer, and Spielberg called one of the sharks "the Great White turd".<ref name="Jaws"/> Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname "Flaws".<ref name="Filmsite">{{cite web | author=Dirks, Tim | work=filmsite.org | title=Jaws (1975) | url=http://www.filmsite.org/jaws.html| accessdate=2006-08-07}}</ref>

To some degree, the delays in the production proved serendipitous. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot most of the scenes with the shark only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt its location is represented by floating yellow barrels that have been tied to it during the hunt. This enforced restraint is widely thought to have increased the suspense of these scenes, giving it a [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] tone.<ref>{{cite web | author=Stephenson, John-Paul | work=jawsmovie.com | title=Essay on Jaws |url=http://www.jawsmovie.com/fans/essay.html| accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

The scene where Hooper discovers a body in the hull of the wrecked boat was added after an initial screening of the film.  Spielberg mentions that after he saw everyone's reaction, he got so greedy for "one more scream" that he financed this addition with $3,000 of his own money after he was denied funding from Universal Studios.<ref name="Jaws"/> Their thought was that there was nothing wrong with the film the way it was and that it should be left alone. Ironically, this added scene could be considered a continuity error; Brody later tries to convince the mayor to close the beaches but never thinks of mentioning a confirmed kill to bolster his argument.

Footage of real sharks was shot by [[Ron & Valerie Taylor|Ron and Valerie Taylor]] in the waters off Australia, using a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] in a miniature shark cage to create the illusion that the sharks were incredibly enormous.<ref name="Jaws"/> Originally, the script had the shark killing Hooper in the shark cage, but while filming, one of the sharks became trapped in the girdle of the cage, and proceeded to tear the cage apart.<ref name="Jaws"/> Luckily, the dwarf used was not in the cage at the time, so the script was changed to allow Matt Hooper to live and the cage to be empty. Despite this rare footage of violent great white sharks, only a handful of these shots were used in the finished film.

The role of Quint was originally offered to actors Lee Marvin and Sterling Hayden, both whom passed.<ref name="Jaws"/> Producers Zannuck and Brown had just finished working with Robert Shaw on ''The Sting'', and suggested him to Spielberg as a possible Quint. Roy Scheider became interested in the project after overhearing a screenwriter and Spielberg at a party talking about having the shark jump up onto a boat.<ref name="Jaws"/> Richard Dreyfuss initially passed on the role of Matt Hooper, but after seeing a screening of a film he had just done called ''The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz'', he thought his performance in that film was awful.<ref name="Jaws"/> He immediately called Spielberg back and accepted the Matt Hooper role (fearing that no one would want to hire him once ''Kravitz'' was released.) The first person actually cast for the film was Lorraine Gary.<ref name="Jaws"/>

====Box Office Performance====
When ''Jaws'' was released on June 20, 1975, it had a limited release and opened at 409 theaters. It got a wider release on July 25, 1975 at 675 theaters. On its first weekend it managed to gross over $7 million, and was the top grosser for the following five weeks.<ref name="Boxoffice"/> During its run in theaters, the film beat the then-$85 million domestic rentals of the reigning box-office champion, ''[[The Godfather]]'', becoming the first film to reach more than $100 million in theatrical rentals,<ref>{{cite web | work=idsfilm.com | title=Top 5 Box Office Hits, 1939 to 1988 |url=http://www.ldsfilm.com/misc/lds_Top5_boxoffice.html| accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> the money paid to the studio distributors out of the total box office gross. Eventually, ''Jaws'' would go on to gross over $470 million worldwide and become the highest grossing box-office hit for two years,<ref name="Boxoffice"/> securing Steven Spielberg's spot in cinema history. This feat was not surpassed until ''Star Wars'' debuted two years later, in 1977.

====Awards and Critical Reception====
''Jaws'' won [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Film Editing|Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Music (Original Score)]] and [[Academy Award for Sound|Sound]].  It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], although Steven Spielberg was not nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director.]] The film is consistently on the [[Internet Movie Database]]'s list of top 250 films.<ref>{{cite web | work=imdb.com | title=Top 250 Films |url=http://www.imdb.com/chart/top| accessdate=2006-08-04}}</ref> ''Jaws'' was #48 on [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|100 Years... 100 Movies]]'', a list of the greatest American films of all time, and #2 on a similar list for thrillers, ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills|100 Years... 100 Thrills]]''. It was #1 in the Bravo network's five-hour miniseries ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]'' (2004).<ref>{{cite web | work=bravotv.com|title=The 100 Scariest Movie Moments |url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments//index.shtml| accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> The shark was anointed #18 on AFI's ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|100 Years, 100 Heroes and Villains]]'', opposite [[Robin Hood]].  In 2001 the United States Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally significant" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. In 2005, the American Film Institute voted Roy Scheider's line "You're gonna need a bigger boat" as number 35 on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|top 100 movie quotes]]. [[John Williams]]'s score was ranked at #7 on [[AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores]].

The film received mostly positive reviews. In his original review, [[Roger Ebert]] called it "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings".<ref>{{cite web| author=Ebert, Roger | title=Jaws | work=rogerebert.suntimes.com |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750101/REVIEWS/501010332/1023| accessdate = 2006-08-03}}</ref> [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'s A.D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance "absolutely magnificent".<ref>{{cite web| author=Murphy, A.D. | work=variety.com|title=Jaws |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792123?categoryid=31&cs=1&query=jaws&display=jaws| accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref> [[Pauline Kael]] called it "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made... [with] more zest than an early [[Woody Allen]] picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way".<ref>{{cite news  |first = Pauline |last = Kael |title = Jaws | work = The New Yorker |date = [[8 November]] 1976}} Reprinted in {{cite book |last= Kael|first=Pauline |title= When the Lights Go Down|year= 1980|publisher= Wadsworth |id= ISBN 0030568420|pages= 195-6|chapter= Notes on Evolving Heroes, Morals, Audiences}}</ref>

Nevertheless, the film was not without its detractors. [[Vincent Canby]], of ''[[The New York Times]]'', said "It's a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims...In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like "Jaws," characters are simply functions of the action. They're at its service. Characters are like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary.." but also noted that "It's the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun".<ref>{{cite web| author=Canby, Vincent| work=nytimes.com|title=Entrapped by 'Jaws' of Fear|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/21/movies/moviesspecial/21JAWS.html| accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Charles Champlin]] disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that  "''Jaws'' is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age." He goes on to say: "It is a coarse-grained and exploitive work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written".<ref>{{cite web | author=Champlin, Charles | work=latimes.com | title=Don't Go Near the Water |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/cl-ca-125reviews21may21,0,5582323.htmlstory| accessdate=2006-8-31}}</ref> The only widespread criticism of the film is the artificiality of the mechanical shark,<ref name="Reelviews">{{cite web | author=Berardinelli, James | work=reelviews.net | title=Jaws |url=http://reelviews.net/movies/j/jaws.html| accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> although it is only seen in the final moments of the film, and is often brushed over by reviewers.

== Inspirations and influences ==
''Jaws'' bears similarities to several literary and artistic works, most notably ''[[Moby Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]]. The character of Quint strongly resembles [[Moby Dick#Ahab|Captain Ahab]], the insane captain of the ''Pequod'' who devotes his life to hunting a great white whale. Quint's monologue reveals his similar vendetta against sharks, and even his ship, ''The Orca'', is named after the only enemy of sharks. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to Ahab's death in Melville's novel.<ref>{{cite web | work=imdb.com | title=Trivia for Jaws |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0073195/trivia| accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in the original screenplay, which introduced Quint by showing him watching the film version of ''Moby Dick''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Benchley, Peter | work=jawsmovie.com | title=Jaws Final Draft Screenplay |url=http://www.jawsmovie.com/1/benchscript2.htm| accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> His laughter throughout makes people get up and leave the theater (it should be noted that Wesley Strick's screenplay for ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'' features a similar scene). However, ''Moby Dick'' could not be licensed from Gregory Peck, the rights' owner.<ref>{{cite web | author=Woelfel, Jay | work=ez-entertainment.net | title="Tribute to Gregory Peck" |url=http://www.ez-entertainment.net/features/Gregory_Peck.htm| accessdate=2006-08-11}}</ref> The final scenes of the film, in which the men chase the shark and try to harpoon it with flotation barrels, parallel the chase for Moby Dick in the novel.

The first half of the film, where Brody tries and fails to convince the townspeople of the appearance of a great white shark off their beaches, resembles [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s classic 1882 play, ''[[An Enemy of the People]]''. In the play, an ordinary citizen tries to stop a small coastal town from proprieting a new group of medicinal baths. He has discovered that the baths have become toxic, but he is met with scathing anger and rejection after presenting his findings. Some have also noticed the influences of two 1950s horror films, ''[[The Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''The Monster That Challenged the World''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Carpenter, Gerry | work=scifilm.org | title=Creature from the Black Lagoon |url=http://www.scifilm.org/reviews/blacklagoon.html| accessdate=2006-08-28}}</ref><ref name="Filmsite"/>

''Jaws'' was a key film in establishing the benefits of a wide national release backed by heavy media advertising, rather than a progressive release that let a film slowly enter new markets and build support over a period of time.<ref>{{cite web | work=pbs.org | title=Jaws - The monster that ate Hollywood |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/hollywood/business/jaws.html| accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> Rather than let the film gain notice by word-of-mouth, Hollywood launched a successful television marketing campaign for the film, which added another $700,000 to the cost.<ref name="Filmsite"/> The wide national release pattern would become standard practice for high-profile movies in the late 1970s and afterwards.

The film conjured up so many scares that beach attendance was down in the summer of 1975 due to its profound impact.<ref name="Reelviews" /> Though a horror classic (its opening sequence was voted the scariest scene ever by a Bravo Halloween TV special),<ref>{{cite web | work=imdb.com | title=Trivia for "The 100 Scariest Movie Moments" |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450892/trivia| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> the film is widely recognized as being responsible for fearsome and inaccurate stereotypes about sharks and their behavior. Benchley has said that he never would have written the original novel had he known what sharks are really like in the wild.<ref>{{cite web | author=Metcalf, Geoff | work=geoffmetcalf.com | title=Great white shark, the fragile giant |url=http://www.geoffmetcalf.com/qa/19634.html| accessdate=2006-08-04}}</ref> He later wrote ''Shark Trouble'', a non-fiction book about shark behavior and ''Shark Life'', another non-fiction book describing his dives with sharks. Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to convince the public that sharks (who, as macro-predators, constitute an important part of the [[aquatic ecosystem|ocean's ecosystem]]) should be protected.<ref>{{cite web | work=iemanya.org | title=Why Sharks? |url=http://www.iemanya.org/mediaperception.htm| accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Chapple, Mike | work=icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk | title=Great white hope, page 3 |url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/entertainment/previewsandreviews/tm_objectid=15919800%26method=full%26siteid=50061%26page=3%26headline=great%2dwhite%2dhope-name_page.html| accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref>

''Jaws'' has been spoofed and referred to in other films, such as in the opening sequence of ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', directed by Spielberg himself. Other references are to be found in ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' (1979), ''[[Airplane!]]'' (1980), ''[[E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982), ''[[Clerks]]'' (1994), ''[[Mallrats]]''  (1995),  ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997), ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980) and ''[[Shark Tale]]'' (2004). In ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (executive produced by Steven Spielberg), a movie theater sports an animated holographic shark over a marquee that reads "Jaws 19: This time it's ''really really'' personal" and "Directed by Max Spielberg". The film has been adapted into a video game called [[Jaws Unleashed]] and even a musical, titled "Giant Killer Shark: The Musical", which premiered in the summer of 2006 at the [[Toronto Fringe Festival]].

== Music ==
[[John Williams]] contributed the Academy-Award winning [[film score]], which was ranked #7 on [[AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores]]. The main "shark" theme, a simple alternating pattern of two [[notes]], F and F sharp,<ref name="Overture">{{cite web | author=Tylski, Alexandre | work=filmscoremonthly.com | title=A Study of Jaws' Incisive Overture To Close Off the Century |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/1999/14_Sep---A_Study_of_Jaws_Incisive_Overture.asp| accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref> became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger. When the piece was first played for Spielberg, he was said to have laughed at John Williams, thinking that it was a joke. Spielberg  later said that without Williams' score, the film would have been only half as successful, and Williams acknowledges that the score jumpstarted his career.<ref name="Jaws"/> He had previously scored Spielberg's feature film debut ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', and went on to collaborate with him on almost all of his films. 

The score contains echoes of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''The Rite of Spring'', particularly the opening of "The Adoration of the Earth".<ref>{{cite web | author=Scheurer, Timothy E. | work=findarticles.com | title=John Williams and film music since 1971 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2822/is_n1_v21/ai_20633217| accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> Another influence may have been Ed Plumb's score for Walt Disney's ''[[Bambi]]'', which uses a low, repeating musical motif to suggest imminent danger from the off-screen threat of Man. The music has drawn comparisons to [[Bernard Herrman]]'s score for Alfred Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', in which the music enhances the presence of an unseen terror, in this case the shark.<ref name="Overture"/>

There are various interpretations on the meaning and effectiveness of the theme. Some have thought the two-note expression is intended to mimic the shark's heartbeat, beginning slow and controlled as the killer hunts, and rising to a frenzied, shrieking climax as it approaches its prey.<ref>{{cite web | work=filmtracks.com | title=Jaws |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/jaws.html| accessdate=2006-08-25}}</ref> One critic believes the true strength of the score is its ability to create a "harsh silence", abruptly cutting away from the music right before it climaxes.<ref name="Overture"/> Also, it has been noted that the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme, since the score is never used as a [[red herring]]; it only plays when the real shark appears. This is later exploited when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction. Regardless of the meaning behind it, the theme is widely acknowledged as one of the most recognized scores of all time.<ref name="Reelviews"/>

====Soundtrack====
{{Main|Jaws (soundtrack)}}
The original soundtrack for ''Jaws'' was released by MCA in 1975, and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that John Williams redid for the album. In 2000, the score underwent two rushed soundtrack releases: one in a re-recording of the entire ''Jaws'' score performed by the Royal Scottish Orchestra and conducted by Joel McNeely; and another to coincide with the release of the 25th anniversary DVD by Decca/Universal, featuring the entire 51 min. of the original score. Fans prefer the Decca release over the Var<U+00E8>se Sarabande re-recording.<ref>{{cite web | author=Dursin, Andy | work=filmscoremonthly.com | title=Thoughts on the Anniversary Video & CD Releases of JAWS |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2000/25_Jul---What_Lies_Beneath_the_X_Men.asp| accessdate=2006-08-25}}</ref> The latter version has been criticized for changing the original tempo and instrumentation, although it is complimented for its improved sound quality.<ref>{{cite web | author=Donga, Roy | work=musicfromthemovies.com | title=Jaws |url=http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=1532| accessdate=2006-08-25}}</ref>

==30th anniversary and DVD release==
''Jaws'' was first released on DVD as an anniversary collector's edition in 2000 for the film's 25th anniversary. It featured a 50 min. documentary on the making of the film, with interviews from Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and various other cast and crew members. Other extras included deleted scenes, outtakes, production photos, and storyboards.

In June 2005, on the 30th anniversary of the film's release, a festival named [[Jawsfest|JawsFest]] was held in [[Martha's Vineyard]].<ref>{{cite web | work=mvy.com | title=JawsFest |url=http://www.mvy.com/jaws/| accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> ''Jaws'' was then re-released on DVD, this time including the full two-hour documentary produced by Laurent Bouzereau for the LaserDisc. As well as containing the same bonus features the previous DVD contained, it included a previously unavailable interview with Spielberg conducted on the set of ''Jaws'' in 1975.

==Differences from the novel== 
The film remains quite faithful to the book, with the only significant change being the absence of an affair between Ellen and Matt Hooper. In the novel, Brody is a native of Amity while his wife, Ellen, was previously a member of the wealthy New York summer holiday set before she married him. Ellen's despair with her life in Amity leads to a short sexual encounter between her and Hooper. In the film, Brody moved to Amity Island from New York with his family to take up the position of the chief of police, and the relationship between Ellen and Hooper is removed. 

There are several other minor differences as well:

* The film shows that Brody has two sons, eleven-year-old Michael and four-year-old Sean. In the novel, the children were: Billy (aged 13), Martin Jr (aged 11) and Sean (aged 10).

* In the novel, Hooper is killed by the shark during the dive to examine it, with the intention of killing it with a [[bangstick]]. 

* In the novel, the real reason for Larry Vaughn keeping the beaches open is because of his Mafia ties, not the welfare of the town.

* All events in the final reel of the film aboard the boat occur in one unbroken trip at sea, while in the novel the men safely return to Amity's harbor several times.

* Quint's monologue about the USS ''Indianapolis'' is absent from the novel and the original screenplay.

* In the novel, the shark dies as a result of injuries from the bullets, stab wounds, and harpoons embedded in it. For the film, something with more visual impact was deemed necessary. Benchley was not happy with this change, claiming that the airtank explosion was unbelievable.<ref name="Jaws"/>

== Sequels ==
''Jaws'' spawned three sequels, each of which failed to match the success of the original. Spielberg declined a chance to do a sequel, and went on to make ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' with Richard Dreyfuss. ''Jaws 2'' was directed by [[Jeannot Szwarc]], and had Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary, and Murray Hamilton reprise their roles from the original film. The next film, ''Jaws 3-D'', was released in the then-popular [[3-D film|3-D]] format, although the effect does not transfer to television or home video, where it was renamed to ''Jaws 3''. ''Jaws: The Revenge'', directed by Joseph Sargent, featured the return of Lorraine Gary, and is considered one of [[films considered the worst ever|the worst movies ever made]], with a rank at number 50 on the [[Internet Movie Database]]'s Bottom 100.<ref>{{cite web | work=imdb.com | title=IMDB Bottom 100 |url=http://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom| accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> While all three sequels made a profit at the box office (''Jaws 2'' and ''Jaws 3-D'' are among the top 20 highest-grossing films of their respective years), critics and audiences were generally dissatisfied with the films.
