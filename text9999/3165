==Biography==

===Early life===
Solomon began her interest in science as a child watching ''[[The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau]]''.<ref name="WIC" /> In high school she placed third in a national science fair, with a project that measured the percent of oxygen in a gas mixture.<ref name="WIC" />

Solomon received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in 1977.<ref name="Meet">{{cite web| url = http://www.chemheritage.org/EducationalServices/FACES/env/readings/solomon.htm| title = Meet Susan Solomon| accessdate = 2007-02-20| year = 2001
| work = Faces in the Environment| publisher = Chemical Heritage Foundation}}</ref> She received her Ph.D.  in chemistry from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1981, where she specialized in atmospheric chemistry.<ref name="Meet" />

===Marriage===
Solomon married Barry Sidwell in 1988.<ref name="WIC" />

===Work===
Solomon was formerly the head of the Chemistry and Climate Processes Group of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] Chemical Sciences Division until 2011. In 2011, she joined the faculty of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

====Books====
* ''The Coldest March: Scott's Fatal Antarctic Expedition'', Yale University Press, 2002 ISBN 0-300-09921-5 - Depicts the tale of Captain [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s failed 1912 [[Antarctic]] expedition, specifically applying the comparison of modern meteorological data with that recorded by Scott's expedition in an attempt to shed new light on the reasons for the demise of Scott's polar party.
* ''Aeronomy of the Middle Atmosphere: Chemistry and Physics of the Stratosphere and Mesosphere'', 3rd Edition, Springer, 2005 ISBN 1-4020-3284-6 - Describes the atmospheric chemistry and physics of the middle atmosphere from 10&nbsp;km to 100&nbsp;km altitude.

====The ozone hole====
Solomon, working with colleagues at the NOAA [[Earth System Research Laboratory]], postulated the mechanism that the Antarctic ozone hole was created by a [[heterogeneous reaction]] of ozone and chlorofluorocarbons free radicals on the surface of ice particles in the high altitude clouds that form over Antarctica. In 1986 and 1987 Solomon led the National Ozone Expedition to [[McMurdo Sound]], where the team gathered the evidence to confirm the accelerated reactions.<ref name="NAS" />  Her team measured levels of [[chlorine oxide]] 100 times higher than expected in the atmosphere, which had been released by the decomposition of chlorofluorocarbons by [[ultraviolet radiation]].<ref name="Meet" />

Solomon also showed that [[volcanoes]] could accelerate the reactions caused by chlorofluorocarbons, and so increase the damage to the ozone layer.<ref name="Meet" /> Her work formed the basis of the U.N. Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to protect the ozone layer by regulating damaging chemicals.<ref name="WIC" />
