In 2000, Joli was working in a store called Sexcessories at the [[Glendale Galleria]] when she was noticed by porn director [[Kris Kramski]] and asked if she was interested in doing some modeling. Joli claims that Kramski's alterior motive was to get her into a [[threesome]] with he and his girlfriend, but that she was only interested in the girlfriend and not him.<ref name="erosny"/><ref name=hardcoregossip>[http://www.hardcoregossip.com/justine.html "Justine Interview"], ''HardcoreGossip.com'', October 31, 2003.</ref><ref>[http://podnography.com/2005/09/09/podnography-6-justine-joli-the-seduction-king-and-katrina/ "Justine Joli, The Seduction King and Katrina"] by Sam Sugar, ''Podnography'' #6 (podcast), September 9, 2005.
