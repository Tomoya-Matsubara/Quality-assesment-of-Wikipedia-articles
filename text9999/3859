The '''''Toronto Star''''' is [[Canada]]'s highest-circulation newspaper, though its print edition is distributed almost entirely within the province of [[Ontario]]. It is owned by [[Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.]], a division of [[Star Media Group]], a subsidiary of [[Torstar]] Corporation.

== History==
The ''Star'' (originally known as The ''Evening Star'' and then The ''Toronto Daily Star'') was created in [[1892 in Canada|1892]] by striking ''Afternoon News'' printers and writers. The paper did poorly in its first few years. But it prospered under [[Joseph E. Atkinson|Joseph "Holy Joe" Atkinson]], editor from [[1899 in Canada|1899]] until his death in [[1948 in Canada|1948]]. 

Atkinson had a strong social conscience. He championed many causes that would come to be associated with the modern [[welfare state]]: old age [[pension]]s, [[unemployment insurance]], and [[health care]]. The Government of Canada Digital Collections website describes Atkinson as "a <U+2018>radical<U+2019> in the best sense of that term<U+2026>. The ''Star'' was unique among North American newspapers in its consistent, ongoing advocacy of the interests of ordinary people. The friendship of Atkinson, the publisher, with [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]], the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], was a major influence on the development of Canadian social policy."

But Atkinson was also a shrewd businessman who became the controlling shareholder of The ''Star'' and amassed a considerable personal fortune. The ''Toronto Daily Star'' was frequently criticized for practising the [[yellow journalism]] of its era. For decades, the paper included heavy doses of crime and sensationalism, along with crusading zeal for social change.

Its early opposition and criticism of the Nazi regime saw the paper become the first North American paper to be banned in Germany by its government.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

Beginning in the mid-1950s, the ''Star'' sought increased respectability by elevating professional standards and avoiding the sensational excesses of the past. It hired some of the country's most respected journalists and advocated expansion of the welfare state. 

In  1971, the ''Toronto Daily Star'' was re-named the ''Toronto Star'' and moved to a modern office tower at [[One Yonge Street]] and Queens Quay. The original ''Star'' Building at [[Old Toronto Star Building|80 King Street West]] was demolished.  The new building originally housed the paper's presses. The printing plant was moved outside the city to [[Vaughan]] in 1992. During the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003|2003 blackout]], the Star printed the paper at a press in [[Welland, Ontario]].

On May 28, 2007, The ''Star'' unveiled a redesigned paper<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/News/article/218300 TheStar.com | News | You spoke, we listened: Here are the changes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that features larger type, narrower pages, fewer and shorter articles, renamed sections,  more prominence to local news, and less prominence to international news, columnists, and opinion pieces.  '''''Star P.M.''''', a free newspaper in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format that could be downloaded from the newspaper's website each weekday afternoon, was discontinued in October 2007, thirteen months after its launch.

== Atkinson Principles ==
[[Image:Toronto Star Building.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[One Yonge Street]] - Current newspaper offices]]
Shortly before his death in 1948, Atkinson transferred ownership of the paper to a charitable organization given the mandate of continuing the paper's liberal tradition. Ontario's Conservative government passed a law barring charitable organizations from owning large parts of profit-making businesses. The law required the'' Star'' to be sold. The five trustees of the charitable organization circumvented the law by buying the paper themselves and swearing before The Ontario Supreme Court to continue the Atkinson Principles:
* A strong, united and independent Canada
* Social justice
* Individual and civil liberties
* Community and civic engagement
* The rights of working people
* The necessary role of government

Descendants of the original owners, known as "the five families",  still control the voting shares of [[Torstar]], and The Atkinson Principles continue to guide the paper to this day. Recent editorials have been headlined "Fairness for the deaf" and "Public policy fuelling poverty." In February, 2006, ''Star'' media columnist [[Antonia Zerbisias]] wrote on her [[blog]]: "we all have the Atkinson Principles<U+2014>and its multi-culti values<U+2014>tattooed on our butts. Fine with me. At least we are upfront about our values, and they almost always work in favour of building a better Canada."

== Editorial position ==
The Star is proudly liberal in the Canadian context. Its precise position in the political spectrum <U+2014> especially in relation to one of its principal competitors, [[The Globe and Mail]] <U+2014> is hotly disputed. Long a voice of Canadian nationalism, the paper opposed [[free trade]] with the United States in the 1980s and has recently{{When|date=March 2009}} expressed concern about U.S. takeovers of Canadian firms.  

Editorial positions sometimes surprise readers. The ''Star'' was an early opponent of the [[Iraq War]] and sharply criticizes most policies of [[George W. Bush]], but supported Canadian participation in U.S. continental missile defense. Recent editorials have denounced [[political correctness]] at Canadian universities, opposed [[proportional representation]], and yet called for more restrictive [[Copyright|copyright laws]].

The paper usually endorses the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] federally. The ''Star'' was the only major daily to do so in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006]] and the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal elections]] while [[Newspaper endorsements in the Canadian federal election, 2006|many of the other major papers endorsed the Conservatives]]. The ''Star'' endorsed the social democratic [[New Democratic Party]] leader [[Ed Broadbent]] in 1979 and [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] leader [[Robert Stanfield]] in 1972. The paper endorsed the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] in many of the provincial elections from the 1940s to the 1980s, and endorsed strategic voting to defeat [[Mike Harris]] in 1999. 

That said, today few major North American dailies are further to the left than the ''Star''. But the paper's editorialists and columnists usually avoid strident advocacy of radical social change. They prefer incremental reform, fueled by earnest exhortation and appeals to compassion. Recent series on news pages have focused on poverty and multiculturalism. Supporters praise the ''Star'' 's continuing commitment to its founding principles, applauding its ability to attract a large readership for many stories unlikely to be printed elsewhere. 

Detractors{{Who|date=March 2009}} call the newspaper  "the only paper in the world edited by a dead man" (a derisive reference to The Atkinson Principles), or target formulaic "sob sister" stories that focus on the plight of the poor and downtrodden.

== Features ==
The ''Star'' is the only Canadian newspaper that employs a public editor ([[ombudsman]]).  Other notable features include:
*  a community editorial board, whose members write opinion articles that sometimes criticize the paper
*  an immigration/diversity reporter
*  charitable campaigns that solicit contributions from readers 
*  a full page of letters from readers every day
*  results of daily online polls and comments about them
*  an annual competition honouring Toronto's best employers
*  a full colour comics page every day (with half of a page of "Saturday Strips" on Sundays, and one section consisting of "Sunday Strips" on Saturdays)
*  one page of puzzles, such as crosswords, riddles, jumble, and [[Sudoku]], daily (with two pages of puzzles in the comics section on Saturday and three Sudoku puzzles from easy to hard on Sundays)

The ''Star'' says it favours an inclusive, "big tent" approach, not wishing to attract one group of readers at the expense of others. It publishes special sections for [[Chinese New Year]] and [[Gay Pride Week]], along with regular features on condominiums and shopping.  In recent years, the newspaper has promoted "a new deal for cities."

==Competitive position==
With four conventional dailies and two free commuter papers in a greater metropolitan area of about 5.5 million inhabitants, Toronto is one of the most competitive newspaper cities in North America. The advent of ''[[The National Post]]'' in 1998 shook up the market. In the upheaval that followed, editorial spending increased and there was much hiring and firing of editors and publishers. Readers, advertisers and reporters benefited from the fierce competition; shareholders arguably did not.  Toronto newspapers have yet to undergo the large-scale layoffs that have occurred at most other newspapers in Canada and the United States.   

Unlike some of its competitors, The ''Toronto Star'' has been profitable in most recent years. The residual strength of the ''Star'' is its  commanding circulation lead in Ontario. The paper remains a "must buy" for most advertisers. Some competing papers consistently lose money, are only marginally profitable, or do not break out earnings in a way that makes comparison possible. However, the ''Star'' has long been criticized for inflating circulation through bulk sales at discount rates.

But margins have declined and some losses have been recorded. In 2006, several financial analysts expressed dissatisfaction with  The ''Star'''s performance and downgraded their recommendations on the stock of its parent company, Torstar. In October 2006, the publisher and editor-in-chief of The ''Star'' were replaced amid reports of boardroom battles about the direction of the company.  A redesigned paper launched in May, 2007. It features 17% less space for editorial content and a greater emphasis on local coverage.

==Superman and the Star==
[[Joe Shuster]], one of the two creators of [[Superman]], worked for the ''Star'' as a paperboy in the 1920s. Shuster named Clark Kent's paper The ''[[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]]'' in honour of The ''Toronto Daily Star.'' The name of Kent's paper was later changed to ''The [[Daily Planet]]''.
