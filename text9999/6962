'''Beowulf''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|b|e<U+026A>|.|<U+0275>|w|<U+028A>|l|f}}; [[Old English language|Old English]]: {{IPA-ang|<U+02C8>be<U+02D0>o<U+032F>w<U+028A>lf|}}) is a legendary [[Geat]]ish hero and later turned king in the epic poem [[Beowulf|named after him]], one of the oldest surviving pieces of literature in the English language.

==Etymology and origins of the character==
A number of origins have been proposed for the name ''Beowulf''.

===Bee-Wolf===
[[Henry Sweet]], a philologist and early linguist specializing in [[Germanic languages]], proposed that the name ''Beowulf'' literally means in [[Old English]] "bee-wolf" or "bee-hunter" and that it is a [[kenning]] for "bear".<ref name=SWEETPROS>Sweet, Henry. (1884) ''Anglo-Saxon Reader in Prose and Verse''  The Clarendon Press, page 202.</ref> This etymology is mirrored in recorded instances of similar names. ''Biuuuwulf'' is recorded as a name in the AD 1031 ''Liber Vitae''. The name is attested to a monk from [[Durham]] and literally means ''bee wolf'' in [[Northumbria]]n.<ref name=BEULFORIGIN>Chadwick, Hector Munro (1983) ''The Origin of the English Nation'', page 294. ISBN 0-941694-09-7</ref> The 11th century English ''[[Domesday Book]]'' contains a recorded instance of the name ''Beulf''.<ref name=BEULFORIGIN/> A scholar named Sarrazin also suggested that the name ''Beowulf'' was derived from a mistranslation of ''B<U+00F6><U+00F0>varr'' where -''varr'' was interpreted as ''vargr'' meaning "wolf".<ref name="Olsen">[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14878 ''The Relation of the Hrolfs Saga Kraka and the Bjarkarimur to Beowulf'' by Olson, 1916, at Project Gutenberg].</ref> However, this etymology was questioned by [[Sophus Bugge]], who instead suggested that the personage B<U+00F6><U+00F0>varr Bjarki was derived from Beowulf.<ref name="Olsen"/>

===Beow-Wolf===
In 2005, Andy Orchard theorized an etymology on the basis of the common [[Old Norse]] name ''<U+00DE><U+00F3>r<U+00F3>lfr'' (which literally translates to "[[Thor]] Wolf"), stating in parallel that a "more likely" meaning for the name would be the "wolf" of the Germanic god [[Beowa|Beow]].<ref name=BEOBEOW>Orchard, Andy. (2003) ''A Critical Companion to Beowulf'' ISBN 1-84384-029-4</ref>

===Biewolf===
English philologist [[Walter William Skeat]] proposed an etymological origin in a term for "[[Woodpecker]]" citing the [[Old Dutch]] term ''biewolf'' for the bird. Skeat states that the [[black woodpecker]] is common in Norway and Sweden and further reasons that the "indominatable nature" and that the "bird fights to the death" could have potentially influenced the choice of the name.<ref name=SKAETACADEMY>Skaet, Walter William. (1877) "The Name Beowulf" from ''The Academy'' 24 February 1877, page 163.</ref> This etymological origin has been criticized as not being in accordance to [[Grimm's law]] and Skeat may have recanted the proposal at a later date.<ref name=CRITHERI>Shippey, Tom A. ''Beowulf: The Critical Heritage'' Page 387-388. ISBN 0-415-02970-8</ref>

===Beado-Wulf (war wolf)===
The editors of Bosworth's monumental dictionary of Anglo-Saxon propose that Beowulf is a variant of beado-wulf meaning "war wolf" and that it is cognate with the Icelandic Bodulfr which also means "war wolf".<ref>The Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, the posthumous dictionary by [[Joseph Bosworth]] (1898), see [http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/html/oe_bosworthtoller/b0087.html beorne - Be<U+00F3>-wulf].</ref>

===Origins in Geatland===
As told in the surviving epic poem, Beowulf was the son of [[Ecgtheow]], a warrior of the  [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedish]] [[W<U+00E6>gmunding]]s. Ecg<U+00FE>eow had slain [[Hea<U+00F0>olaf]], a man from another clan named the [[Wulfing]]s (according to [[Scandinavia]]n sources, they were the ruling dynasty of the [[Geat]]ish [[petty kingdom]] of [[<U+00D6>sterg<U+00F6>tland]]). Apparently, because the victim was from a prominent family the ''[[weregild]]'' was set too high, and so Ecg<U+00FE>eow was banished and had to seek refuge among the [[Daner|Danes]]. The Danish king [[Hro<U+00F0>gar]] generously paid the ''[[weregild]]'', and had Ecg<U+00FE>eow swear an oath.

Ecg<U+00FE>eow was in the service of the [[Geatish king]] [[Hre<U+00F0>el]], whose daughter he married. They had Beowulf, who grew up with the [[Geats]]. Beowulf's childhood friend was [[Breca the Bronding]] "supposed to be the inhabitants of the island [[Br<U+00E4>nn<U+00F6>]], lying off the coast of [[V<U+00E4>sterg<U+00F6>tland|West Gothland]] in the [[Kattegatt|Cattegat]]".<ref>The Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, the posthumous dictionary by [[Joseph Bosworth]] (1898), see [http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/html/oe_bosworthtoller/b0127.html br<U+00F3>c - brot].</ref> This would be a realistic location for a childhood friend of Beowulf, and the poem describes a swimming contest between them.

===Zealand and Grendel===
When king [[Hro<U+00F0>gar]], his wife [[Wealh<U+00FE>eow]], and his court were terrorized by the monstrous [[Grendel]], Beowulf left [[G<U+00F6>taland|Geatland]] ([[West G<U+00F6>taland]]) and sailed to [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] with fourteen warriors in order to pay his father's debt. During the night, Grendel arrived to attack the sleeping men. Beowulf attacked him without his sword and tore the arm off the beast. Grendel returned to the bog to die and his arm was attached to the wall of [[Heorot]]. The next day, Beowulf was lauded and a [[skald]] ([[scop]]) sang and compared Beowulf with the hero [[Sigmund]].

However, during the following night [[Grendel's Mother (Beowulf)|Grendel's Mother]] arrived to avenge the death of Grendel and collect ''[[weregild]]''. As Beowulf slept in a different building he could not stop her. He resolved to descend into the bog in order to kill her. They fought beside Grendel's corpse, and Beowulf finally won with the aid of an enchanted [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] sword stolen from the lair's plunder.

===Return to Geatland, Kingdom, and Death===
Having returned to Geatland, Beowulf took part in a historic raid against the [[Franks]] with his king [[Hygelac|Higlac]]. Higlac died during the raid, and Beowulf swam home in full armour. Back in Geatland, queen [[Hygd]] offered Beowulf the throne but Beowulf declined in favour of the young prince [[Heardred]]. However, Heardred received two Swedish princes, [[Eadgils]] and [[Eanmund]] who reported that they had fled their uncle [[Onela]] who had usurped the Swedish throne. This led to a Swedish invasion in which Heardred was killed. Beowulf was proclaimed king and decided to avenge Heardred and to help Eadgils become king of Sweden.

The event when [[Onela]] was slain was probably a historic event. Even though it is only briefly mentioned in [[Beowulf]], it occurs extensively in several Scandinavian sources where it is called the ''[[Battle on the Ice of Lake V<U+00E4>nern]]''. For example, [[Snorri Sturluson]] wrote: <blockquote>''Onela rode Raven, as they rode to the ice, but a second one, a grey one, hastened, wounded by spears, eastwards under Eadgils.'' [...] ''In this fight Onela died and a great many of his people. Then king Eadgils took from him his helmet Battle-boar and his horse Raven.''{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} <!-- Whole paragraph --></blockquote>(Although, in Snorri's text the names are in their corresponding [[Old Norse]] forms).

Beowulf ruled the Geats for 51 years, until his realm was terrorized by a [[The Dragon(Beowulf)|dragon]] whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacked the dragon with his ''[[thegn]]s'', but they did not succeed. Beowulf decided to follow the dragon into its lair, at [[Earnan<U+00E6>s]], but only his young Swedish relative [[Wiglaf]] dared join him. Beowulf finally slew the dragon by cutting him in half with a [[seax]], but was mortally wounded by being stabbed with the poisonous horn of the dragon and was carried out by Wiglaf. He was buried in a [[tumulus|barrow]] by the sea.
