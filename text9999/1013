'''Keansburg''' (prounounced ''''kEEns-burg'''') is a [[Borough (New Jersey)|Borough]] in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]. As of the [[United States 2000 Census]], the borough population was 10,732.

Keansburg was formed as a Borough by an Act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] on [[March 26]], [[1917]], from portions of both [[Middletown Township, New Jersey|Middletown Township]] and [[Hazlet, New Jersey|Raritan Township]] (now Hazlet), based on the results of a referendum held on [[April 17]], [[1917]].<ref name=Story>"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968", John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 180.</ref>

Keansburg is part of the [[Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan]], an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area's economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, dense residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural beauty of the [[Raritan Bay]] coastline.

==History==
The land that is now Keansburg was originally home to the [[Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].
[[Image:Keansburg Boardwalk 2.jpg|280px|thumb|left|An early morning view of the boardwalk in Keansburg Amusement Park]]

On [[September 3]], [[1609]], the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', captained by [[Henry Hudson]] is said to have landed on the shores of present-day Keansburg (though some historians argue that the landing and forth-coming explained events took place at the tip of [[Sandy Hook (New Jersey)|Sandy Hook]]). Crewmen of the ship were attacked by the Native Americans when they departed the ship, and one man, John Coleman, was killed.<ref>[http://www.keansburg-historical.org/ Keansburg Historical Society], accessed [[April 10]], [[2007]].</ref> He is reputed to be the first European to be felled by a Native American arrow. It is said that he was buried on the land, in the area that is today the intersection of Carr Avenue and Beachway. It is referred to as "Coleman's Point"

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Keansburg Condos.jpg|180px|thumb|RIGHT|Condominiums being built in Keansburg]] -->
In the time between 1609 and the early 1700s, the land was gradually purchased from the Lenni-Lenape with other surrounding areas. The area was inhabited by Dutch, English, and Scottish settlers. In the 1700s, farming proved to be successful on Keansburg's land, with specialties being pears, apples and corn (maize).
[[Image:Keansburg Beach.jpg|280px|thumb|right|An early morning view of the beach in Keansburg circa [[August 2005]]]]

In this time, the town took on the name of Waackaack, pronounced "Way-kay-ack." This is a [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] term, originally "Wakioak" meaning "Land of Plenty".<ref>Harnes, John A. [http://www.injersey.com/day/story/0,2379,591068,00.html "Of Wakioak and 'clam diggers'"], ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'', [[July 18]], [[2002]]. Accessed [[April 10]], [[2007]]. "Since the Lenni-Lenape Indians called the area Wakioak, which meant "land of plenty," this area of Monmouth County south of Raritan Bay has been called many names, including: Colman's Point, Middletown, Granville, Raritan and finally Keansburg, when the community's first post office was created through the efforts of Rep. John Kean and the Rev. William Ramsay."</ref> The area was also widely known as Tanner's Landing from the early 1700s until approximately 1820, so named for the pier at the end of what was Tanner's Landing Road (now Main Street). Tanner's Landing was a principal port for the area for many years.<ref>[http://www.keansburg.k12.nj.us/khs/Keansburg/chapter_5.htm "Keansburg High School History of Keansburg, at Chapter 5 (Story of the Seas)"]. Accessed [[July 23]], [[2007]]. "In the early days TANNER'S LANDING, now Main Street Beach, was at the foot of TANNERS LANDING ROAD (Main Street). This was a principle (sic) road going through Monmouth County, as it attached to the "KINGS HIGHWAY", the Landing itself being a Major freight port of the countryside. The first steamboat that came into Monmouth County was to use this landing, it was a sidewheel boat which was commanded by Captain Pennoyer. The Tanner's landing was used as a principal port as late as 1820...Tanners landing was a bee-hive of activity around the Revolutionary War period, due to the fact that it was a Major port." Also see the map at:[http://www.keansburg-historical.org/images/1851%20Lightfoot.jpg "Map of Tanner's Landing, 1851"], Keansburg Historical Society].</ref>

Though the source of this information does not state exactly when, the land took on its second official name of Granville. The name originated from the importance of the Phillips Mill, and the grain producing farms in the region. The name held until 1880s.

During the century, Granville became home to its own church, two lighthouses and small businesses. Roadways were beginning to form from repeated use of horse and buggies. The beach was already a favorite to visitors. Population was about 300 people, who mostly farmed and clammed for a living.

On Sunday, [[March 22]], [[1877]], at "half past 9 o'clock," Granville welcomed the newly assigned pastor of the Granville Methodist Episcopal Church, William W. Ramsay. At 19 years of age, Ramsay was slated to serve in the church for one year. His success at the helm of church led to another year in Granville, after which he decided to make the village his permanent home.

Ramsay and his wife, Eliza S Wood, purchased the land that is 69 Church Street and opened a general store in 1881. In the coming years, Ramsay took greater and greater interest in Granville and eventually arranged a petition to establish a post office. The list of 132 names was passed on to [[John Kean (New Jersey)|John Kean]] of Elizabeth, a candidate for Congress. His efforts led to the opening of the post office in 1884, with Mrs. Ramsay serving as its first postmaster. That year, the name Keansburg was adopted.

Further development continued with the creation of postcards depicting the village and land purchases, including some key buys by William A. Gehlhaus and the Keansburg Beach Company. A school was built at the cost of $30,000 in 1890 and sat on what is today the corner of Ramsay Avenue and Church Street (now Fallon Manor).

After the town's decline, small beach houses were cheaply sold and converted into year-round housing. Efforts to reduce crime seem to be working, slowly but surely, in many areas. Further evidence of a possible comeback include the Keansburg beautification project, building of new condominiums across the street from the boardwalk, the construction of a skateboard park, the hiring of a part-time recreation program director and the opening of the first free-standing public library in the borough. The Keansburg Waterfront Public Library, founded in 2004, is the result of a concerted effort on the part of townspeople and the borough government to provide a high quality library with resources that address the needs and interests of the community. Currently, the library is open on a limited basis and is staffed by a part-time library director, library assistant and two additional part-time pages. In spite of this, the library has seen an overwhelmingly positive response from patrons in the community.
