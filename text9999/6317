===Newcastle United===
LuaLua had been brought to the attention of Newcastle manager, [[Bobby Robson]], by [[Mick Wadsworth]], head coach at Newcastle United, who was a former manager of Colchester.<ref name=nufc /> Robson watched LuaLua before deciding to negotiate the transfer, and said, ''"I see [LuaLua] as a special talent. He has to learn how to play with the other players but he's a special new talent. He has to be nursed and cherished and taught. But we are buying long-term a very promising talent, a very promising player."''<ref name=nufc /> LuaLua signed a five-year contract with the club.<ref name=nufc />
LuaLua made his first-team debut in a 1-0 home defeat to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]] in September 2000 and went on to make a total of 23 league and cup appearances for Newcastle in the 2000-01 season without scoring.<ref name=sbase /> He scored twice in Newcastle's [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] campaign at the beginning of the 2001-02 season but his first Premiership goal did not come until April 2002, when he scored a last-minute winner in a 3-2 away win against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Lua Lua breaks his duck| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/africans_abroad/1929272.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = [[2002-04-14]]| accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref> He scored a further two goals in the remaining four games of the season.<ref name=sbase /> LuaLua's goalscoring form continued to the beginning of the 2002-03 season when he scored three goals in his first four games.<ref name=sbase /> Competition for a first-team place meant that LuaLua made only 22 appearances in this season.<ref name=sbase /> In January 2003, LuaLua urged manager Bobby Robson to select some of the younger players for the first-team, saying, ''"I think I deserve a chance now, as do many of the lads on the fringes of the team. Although some people might have the idea that those of us not in the team like sitting on the bench and getting paid good money, nothing could be further from the truth. I'm not in this for the money, I want to play for the first team and show what I can do on a regular basis."''<ref>{{cite news | title = LuaLua lashes out|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/2637915.stm | publisher = BBC Sport| date = [[2003-01-08]]| accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref> LuaLua also spent much of the beginning of the 2003-04 season on the bench and in November 2003, complained about his lack of first-team football and indicated that he would consider leaving Newcastle.<ref>{{cite news | title = LuaLua considers Newcastle future |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/3263227.stm | publisher = BBC Sport| date = [[2003-11-12]]| accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref> Bobby Robson responded, saying would not take advice from a player about how to manage the side.<ref>{{cite news | title = Robson lambasts LuaLua |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/3270385.stm | publisher = BBC Sport| date = [[2003-11-14]]| accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref> In February 2004, after returning from the [[2004 African Cup of Nations]], he joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a three-month loan deal with a view to a permanent deal at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news | title = Pompey land LuaLua |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/3452281.stm | publisher = BBC Sport| date = [[2004-02-02]]| accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref>  LuaLua had made 88 league and cup appearances for Newcastle, scoring nine goals, having started 21 games and made 67 appearances as substitute.<ref name=sbase />
