'''Yauco''' ({{IPA-es|<U+02C8><U+029D>auko}}) is a city (''ciudad'') and [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] in southwestern [[Puerto Rico]], centered on the city of the same name. Although the city is inland, the municipality stretches to a southern coast facing the Caribbean. Yauco is south of [[Maricao, Puerto Rico|Maricao]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]] and [[Adjuntas, Puerto Rico|Adjuntas]]; east of [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico|Sabana Grande and]] [[Gu<U+00E1>nica, Puerto Rico|Gu<U+00E1>nica]]; and west of [[Guayanilla, Puerto Rico|Guayanilla]]. The municipality has 20 wards and the main city ''Yauco zona urbana'' (Yauco Urban Zone). It is both a principal city of the [[Yauco Metropolitan Statistical Area]] and the [[Ponce-Yauco-Coamo, PR CSA|Ponce-Yauco-Coamo Combined Statistical Area]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]] the population of Yauco in the year 2000 was 46,384 persons, decreasing to 42,043 persons in [[2010 United States Census|2010]], a net loss of 4,341 people or 9.36% of its population. Its land area is 176.5 square kilometers with a population density of 238.2. The urban zone accounted for 17,186 of its inhabitants in the 2010 census.<ref>http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1</ref>

Founded by Fernando Pacheco on February 29, 1756, Yauco was a center for [[Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico]] in the 19th century due to its geographical similarity to their homeland. Corsicans have contributed to many areas of life in Yauco, particularly its coffee-producing agriculture. This has contributed to its nicknames of''El Pueblo del Caf<U+00E9>'' (City of Coffee), and ''Los Corsos'' (The Corsicans). It is also known as ''La Capital Ta<U+00ED>na'' ([[Ta<U+00ED>no]] Capital) after the native peoples of Puerto Rico.

==History==
[[File:Agueybana3.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cacique]] [[Ag<U+00FC>eyban<U+00E1> II|Ag<U+00FC>eyban<U+00E1>]]]]
The city of '''Yauco''' was named after the river [[R<U+00ED>o Yauco|Yauco]] which was originally known as ''coayuco'' by the [[Ta<U+00ED>nos]], meaning "[[yucca]] plantation".<ref>[http://welcome.topuertorico.org/city/yauco.shtml Yauco, Puerto Rico]. Welcome.topuertorico.org.</ref>

The area of Yauco was considered as the capital of "Boriken" (Ta<U+00ED>no name of Puerto Rico) and was governed by [[Ag<U+00FC>eyban<U+00E1> and Ag<U+00FC>eyban<U+00E1> II|Ag<U+00FC>eybana]], the most powerful Ta<U+00ED>no "cacique" (chief) in the island. All the other Caciques were subject to and had to obey Ag<U+00FC>eyban<U+00E1>, even though they governed their own tribes. Upon Ag<U+00FC>eyban<U+00E1>'s death in 1510, his nephew, G<U+00FC>eyban<U+00E1> (also known as Ag<U+00FC>eyban<U+00E1> II), became the most powerful Cacique in the island. Ag<U+00FC>eyban<U+00E1> II had his doubts about the "godly" status of the Spaniards. He came up with a plan to test these doubts; he and [[Urayo<U+00E1>n]] (cacique of [[A<U+00F1>asco, Puerto Rico|A<U+00F1>asco]]) sent some of their tribe members to lure a Spaniard by the name of [[Diego Salcedo (soldier)|Diego Salcedo]] into a river and drown him. They watched over Salcedo's body to make sure that he would not resuscitate. Salcedo's death was enough to convince him and the rest of the Ta<U+00ED>no people that the Spaniards were not gods. This in turn led to the failed Ta<U+00ED>no rebellion of 1511.<ref name="Rebellion">{{cite web|url= http://www.pcmle.org/EM/article.php3?id_article=258|title= LA REBELI<U+00D3>N DEL CACIQUE AGUEYBANA II}}</ref><ref name="Cacique">{{cite web|url= http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~onsrud/Landtenure/CountryReport/PuertoRico.pdf|title= Land Tenure Development In Puerto Rico}}</ref>

In 1755, the Spanish settlers of the region built a small chapel and named it "Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora del Sant<U+00ED>simo Rosario" (Our Lady of the Rosary). The settlers sent Fernando Pacheco as their representative to the Spanish Government, to request the establishment of a municipality, since one of the requisites to such a request, the establishment of a place of worship, had been met. On February 29, 1756, the King of Spain granted the settlers their request and the town of Yauco was established. Fernando Pacheco was named First Lieutenant of War of the new town.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ortizal.com/yauco.html|title= historia de Yauco}}</ref>

===19th century Corsican immigration===
[[File:Yauco Coffee Plantation.gif|250px|left|thumb|Early Yauco Coffee Plantation (Pre-1920)]]
{{main|Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico}}
The island of Puerto Rico is very similar in geography to the island of Corsica and therefore appealed to the many Corsicans who wanted to start a "new" life. Under the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815|Spanish Royal Decree of Graces]], the Corsicans and other immigrants were granted land and initially given a "Letter of Domicile" after swearing loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Catholic Church. After five years they could request a "Letter of Naturalization" that would make them Spanish subjects.<ref name="Graces2">{{cite web|url= http://www.icp.gobierno.pr/galeria/archivogeneral/documentos/index.htm|title= Archivo General de Puerto Rico: Documentos|accessdate= August 3, 2007}}</ref> Hundreds of Corsicans and their families immigrated to Puerto Rico from as early as 1830, and their numbers peaked in the 1850s. The first Spanish settlers settled and owned the land in the coastal areas, the Corsicans tended to settle the mountainous southwestern region of the island, primary in the towns of [[Adjuntas]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Utuado, Puerto Rico|Utuado]], [[Ponce, PR|Ponce]], [[Coamo, Puerto Rico|Coamo]], Yauco, [[Guayanilla, Puerto Rico|Guayanilla]] and [[Gu<U+00E1>nica, Puerto Rico|Gu<U+00E1>nica]]. However, it was Yauco whose rich agricultural area attracted the majority of the Corsican settlers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.elyunque.com/coffee.htm|title= A Little History of Coffee and Agriculture in Puerto Rico}}</ref> The three main crops in Yauco were coffee, [[sugar cane]] and tobacco. The new settlers dedicated themselves to the cultivation of these crops and within a short period of time some were even able to own and operate their own grocery stores. However, it was with the cultivation of the coffee bean that they would make their fortunes. Cultivation of coffee in Yauco originally began in the Rancheras and Diego Hern<U+00E1>ndez sectors and later extended to the Aguas Blancas, Frailes and Rubias sectors. The Mariani family created a machine out of a [[cotton gin]] in the 1860s, which was used in the dehusking of coffee. This represented a significant improvement in Puerto Rico's coffee appearance and an opportunity to stand out in the international coffee market.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.yscoffee.com/essays-and-docs/company.htm|title= Caf<U+00E9> Yauco Selecto|accessdate= October 4, 2008}}</ref> By the 1860s the Corsican settlers were the leaders of the coffee industry in Puerto Rico and seven out of ten coffee plantations were owned by Corsicans.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rootsweb.com/~prsanjua/mis-022.htm|title= Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico|accessdate= July 31, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070211135814/http://www.rootsweb.com/~prsanjua/mis-022.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 11, 2007}}</ref>

===Intentona de Yauco===
[[File:Intentona de Yauco.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Flag flown by Fidel V<U+00E9>lez and his men during the "Intentona de Yauco" revolt]]
{{main|Intentona de Yauco}}
The second and last major revolt against Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico, by Puerto Rico's pro-independence movement, known as the [[Intentona de Yauco]] a.k.a. the "Attempted Coup of Yauco", was staged in Yauco. The revolt, which occurred on of March 26, 1897, was organized by [[Antonio Mattei Lluberas]], Mateo Mercado and Fidel V<U+00E9>lez and was backed up by leaders of "[[El Grito de Lares]]", the first major independence attempt, who were in exile in New York City as members of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee. It was during this uprising that Fidel Velz unfurled the current [[flag of Puerto Rico]] on Puerto Rican soil for the first time. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.<ref name="HMPR">"Historia militar de Puerto Rico"; by [[H<U+00E9>ctor Andr<U+00E9>s Negroni]] (Author); Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; ISBN 84-7844-138-7; ISBN 978-84-7844-138-9</ref>

===Spanish-American War===
[[File:Yauco Battlefield 1898.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Part of the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, where the Battle of Yauco took place in 1898]]
{{main|Puerto Rico Campaign}}
In 1898, upon the outbreak of the [[Spanish-American War]], [[Gu<U+00E1>nica]] was a small [[barrio]] within the jurisdiction of the town of Yauco. It had 60 houses in all and its only defense was eleven members of the 4th Volante de Yauco, a Puerto Rican militia unit, under the command of Lieutenant Enrique M<U+00E9>ndez L<U+00F3>pez. When the convoy with General Nelson Miles, approached the "barrio", [[Gu<U+00E1>nica Light|Gu<U+00E1>nica lighthouse]] keeper Robustiano Rivera immediately gave the alert to the residents of the barrio. All of the residents, with the exception Agust<U+00ED>n Barrenechea, Vicente Ferrer, Juan Mar<U+00ED>a Morciglio, Sim<U+00F3>n Mejil, Salvador Mu<U+00F1>oz, Cornelio Serrano and Pascual Elena who welcomed the invaders, abandoned their homes and joined Rivera on his journey to Yauco where he broke the news of the invading forces to the city's mayor.<ref name="EDG">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-02

P. Huse and Wood, departed from the SS Gloucester on rafts and landed on the beach, occurred when Lt. M<U+00E9>ndez L<U+00F3>pez and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the ''Gloucester'' began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. M<U+00E9>ndez L<U+00F3>pez and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco. Yauco was also the place where the first major land battle between Spanish/Puerto Rican and American armed forces was fought in Puerto Rico during the war. On July 26, 1898, Spanish forces and Puerto Rican volunteers, led by Captain Salvador Meca and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Puig fought against the American forces led by Brigadier General George A. Garretson. The Spanish forces engaged the 6th Massachusetts in a firefight at the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, in what became known as the [[Battle of Desideria|Battle of Yauco]] of the [[Puerto Rico Campaign]]. Puig and his forces suffered 2 officers and 3 soldiers wounded and 2 soldiers dead. The Spanish forces were ordered to retreat.<ref name="BY">{{cite web|url= http://www.spanamwar.com/puertoland2.htm|title= Battle of Yauco|accessdate= July 30, 2008}}</ref>

==Economy==
Yauco's main crops are coffee, plantains, oranges and tobacco. Yauco coffees are a revived specialty origin that, at best, display the qualities that made Jamaica Blue Mountain famous: A deep, vibrant, yet restrained acidity and balanced, gently rich flavor. However, this potentially finest of Caribbean coffees is often marred by inconsistency.<ref>{{cite web | title = Yauco, Yauco Selecto, Puerto Rico Yauco | url = http://www.coffeeglossary.net/Y/yauco-yauco-selecto-puerto-rico-yauco.html | accessdate = September 8, 2010}}</ref>
