Mammoth Mammoth were banned from performing at two music venues in Melbourne.

==History==

===Background and name===

Couzens had been in Melbourne rock band Furious Dragon Love with Trobbiani, but was jamming with his friend and bassist Gareth Sweet (Gash) on the side in the original two piece line up of Mammoth Mammoth. They enlisted Tucker, whose band Black Fang was folding, as lead singer and Trobbiani on drums to form the original line up.

Couzens and Sweet originally started Mammoth Mammoth because they were tired of the Melbourne rock scene, which they described as being full of <U+201C>shoe-gazing indie-rock bands doing very little to entertain or commit.<U+201D><ref name= "hammer">Thesses, Frank. "Dickes Fell" [[''Metal Hammer Germany Magazine'']], 2012.</ref>

The band take their name from the wooly mammoth, because it was the <U+201C>biggest<U+201D> name they could think of.

<blockquote><U+201C>We wanted a name that was big, hairy, sweaty and a bit stupid. So what<U+2019>s bigger than a mammoth? A mammoth mammoth!<U+201D></blockquote>

===''Volume I: Mammoth Mammoth EP'' (2008)===

In 2008, the band recorded their debut EP before they even played live together.<ref name="mayfair" />

<blockquote><U+201C>Then when we finally played live we took no prisoners. For all of us it was about giving people a real show and apologising for nothing.<U+201D></blockquote>  
- Frank Trobbiani <ref name= "hammer"/>
&nbsp;

At their earlier live shows, the audience and the press weren<U+2019>t sure if they were serious or joking when performing.<ref name= "hammer"/>

The band are known for their hands-on approach when creating their videos and concert posters as well as their album artwork<ref>Weller, Phil.

The song Weapon of Mass Self-Destruction from their EP features a video that was banned from YouTube due to its explicit content of 70s vintage porn images, so they posted it on porn site tube8, where it received millions of views in its first few days.

===''Volume II: Mammoth and line up changes'' (2009-2011)===

In 2010 on the back of the release of their self-titled debut album, the band toured Australia with fellow Melbourne hard rock band Airbourne. On returning from touring, Gash left the band,<ref name= "hammer"/> and was replaced by Simon Jauney (Spiff), before the band settled on Pete Bell as the band<U+2019>s permanent bass player.

&nbsp;

===''Volume III: Hell<U+2019>s Likely'' (2012 <U+2013> Present)===

Mammoth Mammoth created the basic outline for Volume III over a continuous three day jamming session.<ref name= "burrn"/>  They later recorded the album at Toyland and Goatsounds Studios in Melbourne, Australia, over a two-week period.  They enlisted producer Jason Fuller, bassist for Australian metal band Blood Duster, to work with them on the album.<ref name= "shoot">Staff writers.

<blockquote> <U+201C>We just played around with a bunch of jams. Generally Mikey will say to me, <U+201C>Hey, play a dark riff kinda like this...<U+201D> Then I ignore him and play something different and he<U+2019>ll be too drunk to realise and start singing his lyrics anyway. Then Pete joins in on bass and Bones comes back from taking a shit and gives it some heavy weight - before you know it we have new song.<U+201D></blockquote>

In 2012, after the Australian release of Volume III: Hell<U+2019>s Likely, Mammoth Mammoth were approached by Napalm Records and signed an international recording contract.<ref name= "may"/> The album was re-released Internationally to positive reviews and was supported by their European tour in 2013.
