The '''House of Stuart''', which emerged from the [[House of Stewart]] was an important European [[royal house]]. Founded by [[Robert II of Scotland]], the Stewarts first became monarchs of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] during the late 14th century. Their direct ancestors (from [[Brittany]]) had held the title [[High Steward of Scotland]] since the 12th century, after arriving by route of [[Norman England]]. The dynasty  inherited further territory by the 17th century which covered the entire [[British Isles]], including the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]], also upholding a claim to the [[Kingdom of France]].

In total, nine Stuart monarchs ruled just Scotland from 1371 until 1603. After this there was a [[Union of the Crowns]] under [[James I of England|James VI & I]] who had become the senior genealogical claimant to all of the holdings of the extinct [[House of Tudor]]. Thus there were five Stuart monarchs who ruled both England and Scotland as well as Ireland (although the Stuart era was interrupted by an [[English Interregnum|interregnum]] lasting from 1649-1660, as a result of the [[English Civil War]]). Additionally at the foundation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] after the [[Acts of Union]], which politically united England and Scotland, the first monarch was [[Anne of Great Britain]]. However, she died without issue and all the holdings passed to the [[House of Hanover]], under the terms of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].

During the reign of the Stuarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, fairly modern and centralized state. They ruled during a time in European history of transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]]. Monarchs such as [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] were known for sponsoring exponents of the [[Northern Renaissance]] such as poet [[Robert Henryson]]. After gaining control of all of Great Britain the arts and sciences continued to develop; [[William Shakespeare]]'s best known plays were authored during the [[Jacobean era]], while institutions such as the [[Royal Society]] and [[Royal Mail]] were established during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].
==Origins==
===Etymology===
The name Stewart derives from the political position of office similar to a governor, known as a ''[[Steward (office)|steward]]''. It was originally adopted as the family surname by [[Walter Stewart, 3rd High Steward of Scotland]], who was the third member of the family to hold the position. Prior to this, their family name was defined through immediate ancestors and changed from generation to generation; for example the first two High Stewards were known as ''[[Fitz]]''Alan and FitzWalter respectively. During the 16th century the name underwent a development and the [[French language|French]] spelling ''Stuart'' was adopted. It was [[Mary Queen of Scots]] who adopted the change while living in [[Kingdom of France|France]]; this was to ensure that the [[Scots Language|Scots]] name ''Stewart'' was pronounced correctly.

===Background===
{{see also|Clan Stewart}}
[[Image:Blason Famille Stuart.svg|120px|thumb|High Steward arms.]]
The ancestral origins of the Stewart family are quite obscure <U+2014> what is known for certain is that they can trace their ancestry back to [[Alan FitzFlaad]], who came over to the island of [[Great Britain]] not long after the [[Norman conquest]].<ref name="stewartorigins">{{cite web |title=J.H. Round: The Origin of the Stewarts: Part 1|url=http://www.medievalgenealogy.org.uk/sources/round/stewarts1.shtml|publisher=MedievalGenealogy.org.uk}} Retrieved on 13&nbsp;November 2008.</ref> Alan had been the hereditary steward of the [[Bishop of Dol|Bishop]] of [[Dol-de-Bretagne|Dol]] in the [[Duchy of Brittany]];<ref name="bartlett">Bartlett, ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings, 1075-1225'', 544.</ref> though scholars are divided as to whether he himself was [[Normans|Norman]] or [[Breton]].<ref name="stewartorigins"/>  Alan had a good relationship with the ruling [[Norman Dynasty|House of Normandy]] monarch [[Henry I of England]] who awarded him with lands in [[Shropshire]].<ref name="bartlett"/> The FitzAlan family quickly established themselves as a prominent [[Anglo-Norman]] noble house, with some of its members serving as [[High Sheriff of Shropshire]].<ref name="bartlett"/><ref>Lieber, ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Americana'', 30.</ref> It was the great-grandson of Alan named [[Walter FitzAlan]] who became the first hereditary [[High Steward of Scotland]], while his brother William's family would go on to become [[Earl of Arundel|Earls of Arundel]].

When the civil war in the [[Kingdom of England]] broke out known as [[The Anarchy]], between legitimist claimant [[Empress Matilda|Matilda, Lady of the English]] and her cousin who had usurped her; king [[Stephen of England|Stephen]], Walter had sided with Matilda.<ref name="king">King, '' The Anarchy of King Stephen's Reign'', 249.</ref> Another supporter of Matilda was her uncle [[David I of Scotland]] from the [[House of Dunkeld]].<ref name="king" /> After Matilda was pushed out of England into the [[Count of Anjou|County of Anjou]], essentially failing in her legitimist attempt for the throne, many of her supporters in England fled also. It was then that Walter had followed David up to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], where he was granted lands at [[Renfrewshire]] and the title life peerage of the Lord High Steward.<ref name="king" /> The next monarch of Scotland, [[Malcolm IV of Scotland|Malcolm IV]] made the High Steward title a hereditary arrangement. While High Stewards the family were based at [[Dundonald]], Ayrshire between the 12th and 13th centuries.

==History==
The sixth High Steward of Scotland, Walter Stewart (1293-1326), married [[Marjorie Bruce|Marjorie]], daughter of [[Robert the Bruce]], and also played an important part in the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] currying further favour. Their son [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert]] was heir to the [[House of Bruce]], the Lordship of Cunningham and the Brucean lands of [[Bourtreehill]]; he eventually inherited the Scottish throne when his uncle [[David II of Scotland|David II]] died childless in 1371. 

In 1503, [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] attempted to secure peace with [[Kingdom of England|England]] by marrying [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]]'s daughter, [[Margaret Tudor]]. The birth of their son, later [[James V of Scotland|James V]], brought the House of Stewart into the line of descent of the [[House of Tudor]], and the English throne.  Margaret Tudor later married [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus]], and their daughter, [[Margaret Douglas]], was the mother of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]. In 1565, Darnley married his half-cousin [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary]], the daughter of [[James V of Scotland|James V]]. Darnley's father was [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox]], a member of the [[Stewart of Darnley]] branch of the House. Lennox was a descendant of [[Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland]], also descended from [[James II of Scotland|James II]], being Mary's [[heir presumptive]]. Therefore Darnley was also related to Mary on his father's side and at the time of their marriage.  Because of this connection, Mary's heirs remained part of the House of Stewart.  Because of the long French residence at [[Aubigny-sur-N<U+00E8>re|Aubigny]], held by Darnley's branch in the [[Auld Alliance]], the surname was altered to ''Stuart''.  

Both Mary Queen of Scots and Lord Darnley had strong claims on the English throne, through their mutual grandmother, Margaret Tudor.  This eventually led to the accession of the couple's only child [[James VI of Scotland|James]] as King of Scotland, England, and Ireland in 1603.  However, this was a [[Personal Union]], as the three Kingdoms shared a monarch, but had separate governments, churches, and institutions. Indeed the personal union did not prevent an armed conflict, known as the [[Bishops<U+2019> Wars]], breaking out between England and Scotland in 1639.  This was to become part of the cycle of political and military conflict that marked the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I of England, Scotland & Ireland]], culminating in a series of conflicts know as the [[English Civil War]] (which, despite its name, impacted on all three Kingdoms).  The trial and execution of Charles I by the English Parliament in 1649 began 11 years of republican government knows as the [[English Interregnum]].  Scotland initially recognised the late King's son, also called [[Charles II of England|Charles]], as their monarch, before being compelled to enter a republican system.  During this period, the principle members of the House of Stuart lived in exile in [[mainland Europe]].  The younger Charles returned to Britain to assume his three thrones in 1660 as "[[Charles II of England|Charles II of England, Scotland & Ireland]]", but would date his reign from his father's death 11 years before.

In feudal and dynastic terms, the Scottish reliance on French support was revived during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], whose own mother was French. His sister [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta]] married into the French Royal family. Charles II left no legitimate children, but his numerous illigitemate descendants included the [[Duke of Lennox|Dukes of Lennox]] and [[Duke of Aubigny|Dukes of Aubigny]], and [[Duke of Richmond|Dukes of Richmond]]. 

These French and Roman Catholic connections proved unpopular and resulted in the downfall of the Stuarts, whose mutual enemies identified with the emergent Protestant nationalism and urban [[mercantilism]], as opposed to Catholic feudalism and rural [[manorialism]].  The [[Glorious Revolution]] caused the deposition of [[James II of England|James II]] in favor of his son-in-law and his daughter, [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]].  James continued to claim the thrones of England and Scotland, and encouraged [[Jacobite rising|revolts]] in his name, and his grandson [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles]] led an ultimately [[Jacobite rising#The 'Forty-Five'|unsuccessful rising in 1745]], becoming ironic symbols of [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Radicalism (historical)|rebellion]] and [[Romanticism]].  Due to the identification of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the Stuarts, [[Catholic Emancipation]] was not passed until Jacobitism (as represented by direct Stuart heirs) was extinguished.  Despite the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] intentions of tolerance to be extended to [[Kingdom of Ireland|Irish subjects]], this was not the preference of Georgian Tories and their failure at compromise played a subsequent role in the present division of [[Ireland]].

The direct male line of the Royal branch of the House of Stuart is assumed to be extinct, after the deaths of [[Charles Edward Stuart]],  and his brother [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart]] (although the male line continues through the descendants of several illegitimate sons of Charles II). The current British Royal family descend from the House of Stuart in the female line. Other, technically more senior [[List of Descendants of Charles I of England|female line]] descendants through [[Henrietta Anne Stuart]] survived and continue to this day, in the form of the current Bavarian [[House of Wittelsbach]], who are excluded from the British throne as Roman Catholics. This '[[Jacobite succession|Jacobite]]' branch have attracted some historical support, but have made no claim on the British throne for generations.

At least three [[cadet branch]]es of the House of Stuart survive amongst the titled British aristocracy; the [[Clan Stuart of Appin]], the [[Earl Castle Stewart|Earls Castle Stewart]], and the [[Earl of Galloway|Earls of Galloway]].
