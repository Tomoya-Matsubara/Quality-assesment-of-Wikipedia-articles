In [[developmental economics]], the '''Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle''' (also called the '''Growth-Inequality-Poverty Triangle''' or '''GIP Triangle''') refers to the idea that a country's change in poverty can be fully determined by its change in income growth and income inequality.  According to the model, a development strategy must then also be based on income growth and income inequality.  <ref name = "ReferenceF">{{cite web|last=Gelaw|first=Fekadu|title=The Relationship between Poverty, Inequality, and Growth in the Rural Ethiopia: Micro Evidence|date=August 2009|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/51915/2/648,%20Fekadu%20G%20-%203.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|last=Bourguignon|first=Fran<U+00E7>ois|title=The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPGI/Resources/342674-1206111890151/15185_ICRIER_paper-final.pdf|date= February 2004|work=World Bank Website|accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref>  The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model was created by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Bourguignon]], the former [[Chief Economist]] (2003-2007) of the [[World Bank]].

==Background==

The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle was originally introduced by Bourguignon in a paper presented at the Conference on Poverty, Inequality and Growth in Paris on November 13, 2003.  A modified version of the paper was presented at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations in New Delhi on February 4, 2004. <ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Economists working for international organizations like the World Bank use the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle to create poverty reduction strategies that include both steps to reduce inequality and stimulate growth.  Economists have used the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle to study poverty in both [[developing countries]] and [[developed countries]], including China, Egypt, India, Mexico, and Nigeria.<ref name = "ReferenceD">{{cite web|title=The Growth-Inequality-Poverty Triangle Implication for the Development Strategy in Developing Countries|date=December 2004|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/84797-1104785060319/Cairo_ECES_1210final.pdf|work=Egyptian Center for Economic Studies|accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref> <ref name="ReferenceA"/> <ref name = "ReferenceJ">{{cite web|title=Growth, Inequality, and Poverty in Nigeria|last=Aigbokhan|first=Ben E.|date=February 2008|url=http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/publications/growthinequalitypoverty.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, a study of the 138 countries over the period 2005 to 2010 found that the basic ideas of Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle hold and that both growth and inequality impact absolute poverty as Bourguignon described.<ref name = "ReferenceI">{{cite web|last1=Khan|first=Muhammad Azhar|last2=Khan|first2=Muhammad Zahir|last3=Zaman|first3=Khalid|last4=Hassan|first4=Umar|last5=Umar|first5=Sobia|title=Global estimates of growth<U+2013>inequality<U+2013>poverty (GIP) triangle: evidence from World Bank<U+2019>s classification countries|date=July 2013|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11135-013-9912-7|accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>

==Model==

[[File:Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle.png|Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle|left|thumb|x150px|''The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle, by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Bourguignon]].'']]

The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle can be drawn as a triangle with arrows pointing out of each corner.  At the top of the triangle is "absolute poverty."  This refers to the percent of the population below the income [[poverty line]].  At the bottom left of the triangle is "inequality" or "distribution."  This refers to differences in income across a population.  At the bottom right of the triangle is "growth."  This refers to the change in income for a population (for example, a change in [[GDP]]). <ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The arrows pointing out of "absolute poverty," "growth," and "inequality" in the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle represent cause and effect.  In the model, inequality and growth affect each other and both of them affect absolute poverty. <ref name="ReferenceA"/>  

Bourguignon defines the change in poverty as a function of growth, distribution, and changes in distribution: <U+0394> poverty <U+2261> F(growth, distribution, <U+0394> distribution). This equation assumes small changes in poverty.<ref name="ReferenceD"/>  Bourguignon uses per capita income ([[GDP]] per capita) as the measure of growth and the [[Gini Index]] as the measure of inequality in his model. <ref name = "ReferenceH">{{cite web|last=Lopez|first=J.

==Significance==

The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model differs from previous models of poverty in that it looks at the the interactions between growth and inequality, rather than considering the two separately.  On the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle, the bottom points of the triangle are boxed together under the heading of "development strategy," because Bourguignon believed the mix of policies to reduce poverty should depend on that relationship between growth and inequality. <ref name = "ReferenceA"/>

The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model implies that reducing poverty requires a combination of country-wide policies focused on growth and country-wide policies focused on reducing inequality.  Development strategies that focus on only one of these miss opportunities to reduce absolute poverty.  The model describes that a change in inequality affects absolute poverty in two ways.  First, a change in relative poverty affects absolute poverty by immediately changing the number of people below the poverty line.  Second, a change in relative poverty changes the [[growth elasticity of poverty]]. A redistribution of income means more poverty reduction for a given amount of growth.  The consequence of this is that policies that focus only on growth without considering distribution limit poverty reduction in two ways.<ref name = "ReferenceB">{{cite web|last=Grammy|first=Abbas|last2=Assane|first2=Djeto|title=The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle Hypothesis: An Empirical Examination|date=November 2006|url=http://www.econmodels.com/upload7282/a77f04149bbad14085ce30ac170e7da0.pdf|work=Journal of Policy Model|accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref> <ref name = "ReferenceC">{{cite web|title=Inequality Matters|last=Kapoor|first=Radhicka|url=http://www.gdn.int/admin/uploads/editor/files/2013Conf_Papers/RadickaKapoor_ppt.pdf|work=ICRIER|accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref>  Economists theorize that for this reason sub-Saharan Africa and other less developed countries will not be able to meet poverty goals like the [[Millennium Development Goals]] through growth alone. <ref name = "ReferenceK">{{cite web|last=Naschold|first=Felix|title=Inequality Briefing|url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/3876.pdf|date=March 2002|work=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>

==Controversy==

Critics argue that the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle looks at aggregate concepts in a way that ignores the processes behind those concepts.  Critics say terms like "poverty," "inequality," and "growth" are too broad.  Instead, critics suggest that poverty should be traced back to individual behavior.  <ref name = "ReferenceG">{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=Francisco H.G. |editor-last=Jefferson |editor-first=Philip N. |title=The Oxford Handbook of the Economics of Poverty|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=November 2012 |pages=427<U+2013>462 |chapter=Distributions in Motion: Economic Growth, Inequality, and Poverty Dynamics}}</ref>  Developmental economists [[Abhijit Banerjee]] and [[Esther Duflo]] argue that cross-country data cannot be used to give any meaningful insight on topics like poverty and inequality.  <ref name = "ReferenceG"/>  

Critics also argue that the simplified nature of the model means that it misses factors that affect absolute poverty.  Poverty itself can be considered a barrier for economic growth, meaning that the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle would need to consider the effect of poverty on growth.<ref name = "ReferenceI"/>  Other economists argue that the triangle should include financial instability, crises, the business cycle, and their effects on poverty. Finally, many economists believe that there is a strong link between education, literacy rates, and poverty, and that the focus on decreasing poverty should lie in targeting these areas in addition to inequality and growth. <ref name = "ReferenceE">{{cite web|last=Chemili|first=Leila|last2=Smida|first2=Mourir|title=Interaction between Poverty, Growth, and Inequality during the Crisis: A Panel Data Study|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijef/article/view/26709/0|date=May 2013|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>
