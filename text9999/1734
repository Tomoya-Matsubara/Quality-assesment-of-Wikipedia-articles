'''Michele Stefano de Rossi''' (30 October 1834, [[Rome]] - 23 October 1898, [[Rocca di Papa]]) was an Italian [[seismologist]]. He was a younger brother to [[archaeologist]] [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi]] (1822-1894). 

He received his education at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], and during his subsequent career conducted research in the fields of [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[geology]], [[vulcanology]] and seismology. He studied the [[topography]] of [[catacombs]], and collaborated with his brother on ''La Roma sotterranea cristiana'' (1864-1877).

In the 1870s he developed a "seismic scale" to reflect varying levels of [[earthquake]] intensity. Meanwhile in Switzerland, independent of Rossi, [[limnologist]] [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Alphonse Forel]] (1841-1912) created a similar seismic scale. When the two scientists became aware of each other's work, a combined effort resulted in the [[Rossi<U+2013>Forel scale]] for determining the intensity of earthquakes.

In 1874 he founded the ''Bullettino del Vulcanismo Italiano'', a journal dedicated to the study of [[volcanoes]] and earthquakes.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=d-08AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=%22Michele+Stefano+de+Rossi%22+1834&source=bl&ots=K1Iks0BED1&sig=mmD9EL63LA3NhJN0ukGlSLYMaXU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sq1zUNiOPMHlqgHTl4DwCQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Michele%20Stefano%20de%20Rossi%22%201834&f=false Google Books] The founders pf seismology</ref>
