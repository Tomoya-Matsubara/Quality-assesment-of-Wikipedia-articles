'''Alitena''' is a town in northern [[Ethiopia]], located in the [[Misraqawi Zone|Misraqawi (Eastern) Zone]] of the [[Tigray Region]]. Alitena was the administrative center of [[Irob (woreda)|Irob]] [[woreda]] until [[Dawhan]] was made the new center prior to 2003.

== Overview ==
Alitena is connected by a 35 kilometer road to [[Zalambessa]], which was constructed under the inspiration and leadership of the local [[Roman Catholicism in Ethiopia|Roman Catholic]] priests, and opened 5 December 1974.<ref>[http://www.strebel-consulting.com/wasser/stories/images/buch_ass.pdf "Adrigat Diocesian Development Action"], pp. 11f (accessed 9 April 2011)</ref>

Alitena has been an important Roman Catholic center in northern Ethiopia as early as 1845, when disciples of [[Justin de Jacobis]] converted some of the local residents from the [[Ethiopian Church]].<ref>Donald Crummey, ''Priests and Politicians'' (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2007), p. 79</ref> At Easter 1847 the Catholic missionaries de Jacobis and [[Guglielmo Massaia]], together with four Ethiopian priests recently ordained by them, celebrated mass there in 1847. Although lacking churches, de Jacobis was fond of the people there, and considered Alitena as a possible place of refuge if there should be persecutions against the Catholics. Since 1934 the [[Lazarist]] Mission in Tigray had its main center at Alitena.<ref>[http://www.nai.uu.se/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/A/ORTAK05.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"] The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 6 April 2011)</ref>
