==Plot==
The [[Simpson family]] are busy preparing for [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s birthday party. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that can be used to tap into localized radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a [[label maker]], and a new [[Suit (clothing)|suit]]. At first he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating [[practical joke]]s, such as tricking the [[Flanders family|Flanders]] children into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Janey Powell|Janey]]'s conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that aliens have invaded Earth.

Bart throws a radio down a well and speaks through it with the microphone, tricking the townspeople into thinking an orphan named Timmy O'Toole has fallen down the well. Although they are unable to get "Timmy" out, as the well is too small for any adult to fit in, the entire town offers moral support and do everything they can to give him hope. [[Krusty the Klown|Krusty]] even gets musician [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] to join other celebrities in recording a [[charity single]], "We're Sending Our Love Down the Well". However, Bart<U+2014>after realizing that his name is on the radio thanks to his label-maker<U+2014>falls into the well while trying to retrieve it. When the townspeople find out, he confesses that Timmy O'Toole does not exist. Angry at being tricked, the townspeople leave Bart in the well. At the same time, "We're Sending Our Love Down The Well" dramatically falls off the number one spot to be replaced by "I Do Believe We're Naked" by Funky See, Funky Do.

Despite efforts by Homer and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] to mobilize a rescue operation, the entire town remains outraged at Bart and refuse to help. Finally, Homer has had enough<U+2014>he decides to dig a tunnel and rescue Bart himself. [[Groundskeeper Willie]] sees this and joins Homer. With a little help from Sting, and several residents who put their anger aside, an excavation operation is started. A regretful Bart is finally rescued and Willie puts up a small warning sign near the well the next morning to prevent future incidents.

"Radio Bart" was written by [[Jon Vitti]] and directed by [[Carlos Baeza]], though series creator [[Matt Groening]] came up with the idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film ''[[Ace in the Hole (film)|Ace in the Hole]]'', which sees the story of a former journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Radio Bart"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; "[Groening] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story."<ref name="Vitti">{{cite video | people=Vitti, Jon|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Radio Bart"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by [[Billy Wilder]], so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find."<ref name="Vitti"/>

The producers approached singer [[Bruce Springsteen]] to appear in the episode because he had participated to the charity song "[[We Are the World]]", which "We're Sending Our Love Down The Well" is based on. Springsteen declined so the producers offered the role to American musician Sting instead.<ref name="Jean"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,485288,00.html|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season|last=Ross|first=Darlon|date=September 19, 2003|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Life - Arts Etc.

The television commercial for the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that Homer watches was inspired by a popular [[Ronco]] commercial from the late 1980s, in which a boy becomes popular and "scores with the girls" by using his microphone to be on the radio. Both commercials feature a boy passing by two women and saying, "Hey, good-looking, I'll pick you up later," a line the staff thought was "hilarious".<ref name="Jean"/> In the Superstar Celebrity Microphone commercial, the boy sings the 1975 song "[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]" by [[C. W. McCall]] into the microphone. The producers originally wanted him to sing "[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald]]" by [[Gordon Lightfoot]], a song about the sinking of the [[bulk carrier]] [[S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald|S.S. ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']] on [[Lake Superior]]. Vitti said the reason the song was not used was because Lightfoot had made it so that in order to clear the copyrights for song, they would have to get permission from the families of the twenty-nine passengers who died on the ship.<ref name="Vitti"/> In another scene, Bart uses his radio to make Homer believe aliens are invading Earth; Homer was originally supposed to create a [[Punch (drink)|punch]] made from [[Kool-Aid]] and rat poison so that he and the family could commit suicide before the aliens arrived. The writers thought this scene was "too dark" and changed it to Homer getting a shotgun and going after the aliens, before finding out that Bart is playing a trick on him.<ref name="Reiss"/>

Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict gave the episode a less positive review, commenting that it "is always considered a fan favorite, but there is a real dated feel to this entire child down the well narrative. Maybe it's the labeling gun gift Bart uses. Maybe it's the Chuck-e-Cheese style theme restaurant Bart has his birthday party in. Maybe it's the appearance of long since dried up Sting and the whole 'We Are the World' idealism which is all but dead now (thankfully). Whatever it is, it robs this episode of a great deal of its initial impact, leaving us with a funny, but not fabulous, offering."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason3.php|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season|last=Gibron|first=Bill|date=December 15, 2003|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 3/5 rating and said it is "unbalanced, with some clever dialogue and a fantastic climax (featuring Sting), but the overall pacing of the plot leaves too many lulls for this to be a standout episode."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=6129|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season|last=Meyers|first=Nate|date=June 23, 2004|publisher=Digitally Obsessed|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>
