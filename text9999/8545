==Professional career==
Prior to the [[2002]] NFL Draft, Goodman ran an impressive 4.36 40-yard dash. However, post-season [[shoulder]] surgery hurt his stock, and he was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the third round (68th overall) of the draft.

===2002===
As a rookie in 2002, Goodman appeared in 14 regular season games including six starts. He missed the team's first two games with an [[ankle]] injury.

He saw his first regular season against the [[Green Bay Packers]] on [[September 22]], finishing with four tackles. He had a pass breakup in the end zone and five solo tackles, including one for a loss, in his first career start against the [[New Orleans Saints]] the following week. Against the Packers on [[November 10]], Goodman registered two pass breakups and five tackles (four solo) before being forced out of the game with a [[thumb]] injury. The injury would force him to wear a cast on his right hand for the rest of the season.

Ankle and [[knee]] injuries to Dolphins cornerback [[Travis Daniels]] allowed Goodman to see significant playing time throughout the season. Goodman started 13 of the 15 games in which he appeared in 2006, accumulating 41 tackles (26 solo), a forced fumble, two fumble recoveries and nine passes defensed. He recovered a [[Bo Scaife]] fumble against the [[Tennessee Titans]] on [[September 24]] and [[Justin Gage]] fumble against the Chicago Bears on [[November 5]]. His lone forced fumble came against [[running back]] [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] and the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] on [[December 3]].

While he did not nab an interception on the year and the Dolphins' secondary struggled as a unit, Goodman was the team's most consistent downfield cover corner in 2006. He suffered a shoulder injury against the [[New York Jets]] on [[December 25]], and was placed on season-ending Injured Reserve the following day. It would be the second time during the season a shoulder injury had permanently forced him out of a contest against the rival Jets, with the first such occasion taking place more than two months prior on [[October 15]].

===2007===
Goodman's shoulder problems from the previous year plagued him during the [[2007]] offseason. He underwent [[arthroscopic]] [[debridement]] on his left shoulder on [[January 18]]. After being unable to participate in the team's first [[May]] minicamp, Goodman underwent further tests and had more surgery on the shoulder on [[May 11]]. On July 23, he was placed on the [[Physically Unable to Perform]] list.
