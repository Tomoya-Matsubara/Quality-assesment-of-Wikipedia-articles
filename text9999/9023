The '''Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major''' ({{lang-it|Basilica Papale di Santa Maria Maggiore}}, {{lang-la|Basilica Sanctae Mariae Majoris ad Nives}}<ref name="cathency">{{CathEncy| wstitle=Our Lady of the Snow| title =Our Lady of the Snow| first =Michael | last = Ott | authorlink = | accessdate =2008-12-27}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gcatholic.com/dioceses/romancuria/dx2.htm Major Basilica of St. Mary Major,] [http://www.roma2000.it/zschmar.html St. Mary Major Basilica,] [http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/SaintOfDay/default.asp?id=1098 Dedication of St. Mary Major Basilica,] [http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/our_man_in_rome/ Boston Magazine.] Other names in the [[Italian language]] are '''Basilica di Santa Maria della Neve''' and '''Basilica Liberiana''', in [[English language|English]] '''Our Lady of the Snow''' and the '''Liberian Basilica'''. In Latin it is called [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11361c.htm ''Basilica Sanctae Mariae'' or ''Mariae Majoris'' or ''ad Neves''], that is the Basilica of Saint Mary or of Mary Major or of the Snows.</ref>), is an [[Ancient Rome|ancient]] [[Roman Catholic Marian church|Roman Catholic Marian basilica]] of Rome. It is one of the [[Basilica#The major basilicas|four major]] or [[Basilica#Papal and (formerly) patriarchal basilicas in Rome|four papal basilicas]],<ref>[http://www.gcatholic.com/churches/data/basITX.htm#aaa Basilicas]</ref> which, together with [[Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura|St. Lawrence outside the Walls]], were formerly referred to as the five "patriarchal basilicas" of Rome <ref>The [[Benedict XVI]]<U+2019>s theological act of renouncing the title of "[[Patriarch of the West]]" has a consequence that the basilica changed its name to become the [[Papal basilica]] of Saint Mary Major, as its official websites states.</ref>, associated with the five ancient [[patriarch]]al sees of Christendom (see [[Pentarchy]]). The other three papal or major basilicas are [[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano|St. John Lateran]], [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|St. Paul outside the Walls]]. The Liberian Basilica (another title for the church) is one of the ''[[titulus|tituli]]'', presided over by a patron<U+2014>in this case [[Pope Liberius]]<U+2014>that housed the major congregations of early Christians in Rome. Santa Maria Maggiore is the only Roman basilica that retained the core of its original structure, left intact despite several additional construction projects and damage from the [[earthquake of 1348]].

The name of the church reflects two ideas of greatness ("major"), that of a major (or papal) basilica and that of the largest (major) church in Rome dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

After the [[Avignon papacy]] formally ended and the Papacy returned to Rome, the Basilica became a temporary [[Palace of the Popes]] due to the deteriorated state of the [[Lateran Palace]]. The papal residence was later moved to the [[Palace of the Vatican]] in what is now [[Vatican City]].

== History ==

Santa Maria Maggiore stands on the site of a temple to the goddess [[Cybele]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

According to the tradition, [[Pope Liberius]] commissioned circa 360 the construction of the '''Liberian Basilica''' on the summit of the [[Esquiline Hill]]<ref name="offwebsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/various/sm_maggiore/en/storia/interno.htm|title=History of the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore | publisher   =  Basilica Papale Santa Maria Maggiore| location= Vatican City|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref>. According to the founding legend, which cannot be traced further back than the thirteenth century,<ref>Margaret R. Miles, "Santa Maria Maggiore's Fifth-Century Mosaics: Triumphal Christianity and the Jews" ''The Harvard Theological Review'' '''86'''.2 (April 1993:155-175), "Santa Maria Maggiore and its legend", pp 157-59</ref> the pope wanted a [[shrine]] built at the site where an [[Marian apparitions|apparition]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] appeared in identical dreams shared by a local patrician Giovanni Patrizio and his wife and by the pope.  According to tradition, the outline of the church was physically laid out on the ground of the nobleman's property by Liberius himself under a miraculous but predicted snowfall that took place on the night of 4<U+2013>5 August 352 (or 358).<ref>Or 358 (Miles 1993:157).</ref>

Archaeological evidence, on the other hand, indicates that the church was probably first built in the early 400s and completed under Pope Sixtus III (432<U+2013>440){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. During this period churches dedicated to Mary were beginning to spring up all over the [[Roman Empire]], owing to the increasing popular devotion to the Virgin and the official acceptance of her title "[[Theotokos]]" (Mother of God) at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431.

The church has had many names over the years: first Santa Maria della Neve ({{lang-en|St. Mary of the Snow}}) after the snowfall, then Santa Maria Liberiana after Pope Liberius. After the basilica obtained a relic of the Holy Crib, it was called Santa Maria Del Presepe (St. Mary of the Crib). It was finally named Santa Maria Maggiore (St. Mary Major) because it is the largest of the 26 churches in Rome dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

Santa Maria Maggiore was fully restored and renovated in the 18th century; the fa<U+00E7>ade and most of the interior decorations date from this period. Today, the basilica is served by Redemptorist and Dominican fathers and remains very popular with pilgrims and tourists alike.

The legendary ''Miracle  of the Snow'' was depicted by [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]] around 1423 in a triptych commissioned for the basilica by a member of the [[Colonna family]]; it is now conserved in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]], Naples.<ref>Paul  Joannides, "The Colonna Triptych by Masolino and Masaccio," ''Arte Cristiana'' no 728 (1988:339-46).</ref> In it is depicted the witnessing of the miracle by a crowd of holy men and women, Jesus and the Virgin Mary observing from above. Local Roman Catholics commemorate the [[miracle]] on each anniversary by dropping white [[rose]] petals from the [[dome]] during the [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] of the feast.

== Architecture ==

The precise location of that first church has been lost. The present building dates from the time of [[Pope Sixtus III]] (432 - 440) and contains many ancient [[mosaic]]s from this period. Its form so exactly follows the conventions of an imperial basilica it has at times been taken for one.<ref>Miles 1993:158.</ref> The Athenian marble columns supporting the nave are even older, and either come from the first basilica, or from another antique Roman building; thirty-six are marble and four granite, pared down, or shortened to make them identical  by Ferdinando Fuga, who provided them with identical gilt-bronze capitals.<ref>Roloff Beny and Peter Gunn, ''The Churches of Rome (New York) 1981:106.</ref> The fourteenth century [[campanile]], or bell tower, is the highest in Rome, at 240 feet, (about 75 m.). The basilica's 16th-century coffered ceiling, to a design by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], is said to be gilded with Inca gold presented by [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] to the Spanish pope, initially brought by [[Christopher Columbus]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] (something which factually is erroneous, since the Inca empire was conquered during the reign of Charles V).  The apse mosaic, the Coronation of the Virgin, is from 1295, signed by the [[Franciscan]] friar, [[Jacopo Torriti]]. The Basilica also contains frescoes by [[Giovanni Baglione]], in the Cappella Borghese.

[[Image:Santamariamaggiore2b.jpg|thumb|right|The Borghese (or Pauline) Chapel]]

The 12th-century fa<U+00E7>ade has been masked by a reconstruction, with a screening loggia, that were added by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743, to designs by [[Ferdinando Fuga]] that did not damage the mosaics of the fa<U+00E7>ade. The wing of the ''canonica'' ([[sacristy]] to its left and a matching wing to the right (designed by [[Flaminio Ponzio]]) give the basilica's front the aspect of a palace facing '''Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore'''.  To the right of the Basilica's fa<U+00E7>ade is a memorial representing a column in the form of an up-ended cannon barrel topped with a cross: it was erected by [[Pope Clement VIII]] immediately after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of Protestants, though today it is reputed to celebrate the end of the [[French Wars of Religion]]  [http://members.tripod.com/romeartlover/Vasi48.html].

The Marian column erected in 1614, to designs of [[Carlo Maderno]] is the model for numerous [[Marian column]]s erected in Catholic countries in thanksgiving for remission of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during the [[Baroque]] era. (An example is the [[Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc]], the Czech Republic). The column itself is the sole remaining from Constantine's [[Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine]] in ''[[Roman Forum|Campo Vaccino]]'', as the Roman Forum was called until the 18th century [http://members.tripod.com/romeartlover/Vasi48.html]; Maderno's fountain at the base combines the armorial eagles and dragons of Paul V.

=== Restoration ===
In the centuries that have passed, the weather has been Santa Maria Maggiore's biggest rival.  The pollution of a modern city combined with humidity puts at risk the old churches and the artwork they hold. Centuries before the first vehicle spewed exhaust into the city, during the late sixteenth century, a number of the Vatican's churches were renovated and redecorated. The basilica itself was restored and extended by various popes, including [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]] (1145<U+2013>1153), [[Pope Nicholas IV|Nicholas IV]] (1288<U+2013>92), [[Pope Clement X|Clement X]] (1670<U+2013>76), and [[Pope Benedict XIV|Benedict XIV]] (1740<U+2013>58), who in the 1740s commissioned [[Ferdinando Fuga]] to build the present [[fa<U+00E7>ade]] and to modify the interior. The interior of the Santa Maria Maggiore underwent a broad renovation encompassing all of its altars between the years 1575 and 1630.

=== The Capella Sistina and the Crypt of the Nativity ===

Below the sanctuary of Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore is the '''Crypt of the Nativity''' or the ''Bethlehem Crypt'', which is the burial place for prominent Catholics, including  [[Saint Jerome]], the 4th century [[Doctor of the Church]] who translated the Bible into the [[Latin|Latin language]] (the [[Vulgate]]); popes; and [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]]. [[Saint Ignatius of Loyola]] presided over his first mass as a priest on this altar on 25 December 1538 (previously below the central main altar).

The decoration of the ''Sistine chapel'' of Santa Maria Maggiore, which should not be confused with the more famous [[Sistine chapel]] of the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], was commissioned by the administration of [[Pope Sixtus V]]. The architect [[Domenico Fontana]] was called to design the chapel to house the presumptive relics of the Nativity crib. The original Nativity Oratory, with the ''presepe'' built in the XIII century by [[Arnolfo di Cambio]], is below the chapel. The chapel contains the tombs of Sixtus V and his early patron [[Pius V]] (design by [[Domenico Fontana|Fontana]] and statue by [[Leonardo Sarzana]]). The statue of Sixtus V was sculpted by [[Giovanni Antonio Paracca]], called ''il Valsoldo''. The main altar in the Chapel has four gilded bronze angels by [[Sebastiano Torregiani]], along the [[ciborium]].

The [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] interior decoration was completed (1587-9) by a large team of artists, directed by [[Cesare Nebbia]] and [[Giovanni Guerra]]. While the art biographer, [[Giovanni Baglione]] allocates specific works to individual artists, recent scholarship finds that the hand of Nebbia drew preliminary sketches for many, if not all, of the frescoes. Baglione also concedes the roles of Nebbia and Guerra could be summarized as "Nebbia drew, and Guerra supervised the teams".

== Salus Populi Romani ==
[[Image:Virgin salus populi romani.jpg|left|thumb|140px| [[Salus Populi Romani]], perhaps the oldest [[Roman Catholic Marian art|Marian image]] in Rome.]]
The column in the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore celebrates the famous [[icon]] of the Virgin Mary in the Borghese or Pauline Chapel of the Basilica. It is known as ''[[Salus Populi Romani]],'' or ''Health of the Roman People'', due to a miracle in which the icon helped keep plague from the city. The icon is at least a thousand years old, and tradition holds that it was painted from life by [[Luke the Evangelist|St Luke the Evangelist]]. (According to published material {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} at the Basilica, radiocarbon dating establishes the age of the icon to be approximately 2,000 years, thus reinforcing its sacred tradition.)

The [[Salus Populi Romani]] has been a favorite of several Popes and acted as a key [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] symbol. Roman born [[Pope Pius XII]] (Eugenio Pacelli) celebrated his first Holy Mass there on 1 April 1899. In 1953, the icon was carried through Rome to initiate the first Marian year in Church history. In 1954, the icon was crowned by Pope Pius XII as he introduced a new Marian feast [[Queenship of Mary]]. [[Pope Paul VI]], [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]] all honoroured the Salus Populi Romani with personal visits and liturgical celebrations.

== Papal basilica ==

As papal basilica, Santa Maria Maggiore is often personally used by the [[pope]].  Most notably, the pope presides over the annual [[Feast of the Assumption of Mary]], celebrated on 15 August each year at the basilica.  The [[baldachin|canopied]] high [[altar]] is used by the pope alone&nbsp;<U+2014> except for a choice few [[priest]]s including the [[archpriest]].  The pope gives charge of Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore to an archpriest, usually an [[archbishop]] made [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in [[consistory]]. The archpriest was formerly the titular [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch]], a title abolished in 1964.

The current archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore is Cardinal [[Bernard Francis Law]]; [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] assigned Law to this position after his resignation as [[Archbishop of Boston]] on 13 December 2002, in an act that elicited much criticism, given the fact that Law was arguably one of the most controversial Church officials in the [[United States]]. It was in his archdiocese that the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal|2002 scandal]] initially erupted.

In addition to the archpriest and his servant priests, a chapter of canons are resident in Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. In addition, [[Redemptorist]] and [[dominican order|Dominican]] priests serve the church daily&nbsp;<U+2014> hearing [[confession]]s and administering other [[sacrament]]s.
