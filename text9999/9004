'''Gil <U+00C1>lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Egidio Albornoz''; [[1310]] - [[1367]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and ecclesiastical leader.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Albornoz was born at [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]] early in the [[14th century]]. He was the son of Gil <U+00C1>llvarez de Albornoz and of Do<U+00F1>a Teresa de Luna, sister of Jimeno de Luna, [[archbishop of Toledo]]. He was educated at [[Zaragoza, Spain|Zaragoza]], while his uncle was bishop of that see, and studied law at [[Toulouse]].

The powerful influence of his family opened him a public career early in life.  He was made archdeacon of [[Calatrava]], and became a member of the king's council while young. In [[1338]] he was chosen [[archbishop]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in succession to his uncle by the favour of the king, [[Alfonso XI of Castile]]. At the [[battle of Tarifa]] he fought against a great invasion from [[Africa]] in 1340, and at the taking of Algeciras in 1344 he led the armed levy of his archbishopric.

In [[1343]] he had been sent to [[Pope Clement VI]] at [[Avignon]] to negotiate a grant of a tax on the revenues of the Church for the Crusade. His military and diplomatic ability became known to the pope, who made him a cardinal in 1350.  Albornoz left [[Spain]] on the death of the king Alfonso XI in that year, and never returned. It has been said, but not on contemporary evidence, that he fled from fear of [[Pedro of Castile]].

===First campaign in Italy===
In [[1353]] [[Pope Innocent VI|Innocent VI]] sent him as a legate into [[Italy]], with a view to the restoration of the papal authority in the states of the Church, at the head of a small mercenary army. After received the support of the archbishop of Milan, [[Giovanni Visconti]], and of those of Pisa, Florence and Siena, he started a campaign against [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of [[Viterbo]], who had usurped much of the Papal territories in the Latium and Umbria. Giovanni was defeated in the battle of Viterbo of [[March 10]] [[1354]] and signed a treaty of submission. 

Albornoz then moved to the [[Marche]] and [[Romagna]] against the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] of [[Rimini]] and the [[Ordelaffi]] of [[Forl<U+00EC>]]. The Papal commander [[Ridolfo da Varano]], lord of [[Camerino]], defeated [[Galeotto I Malatesta|Galeotto Malatesta]], forcing his family to become a loyal ally of the Pope. This was followed by the submission of the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the [[da Polenta]] of [[Ravenna]], and of the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. Towards the end of 1355 Albornoz was appointed as bishop of [[Sabina]].

Only [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of [[Faenza]] and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forl<U+00EC> were at that point resisting the Papal reconquest. Albornoz had managed to submit only the former when he was being recalled in 1357, being replaced by [[Androin de la Roche]], abbot of [[Cluny]]. Before leaving, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars held on [[April 29]] [[1357]], Albornoz issued the ''[[Constitutiones Sanct<U+00E6> Matris Ecclesi<U+00E6>]]'', which regulated all the matters of the Papal States and its division into provinces. They remained effective until 1816.

===Second campaign in Italy===
The Cardinal was honoured as ''Pater Ecclesi<U+00E6>'' at his arrival in Avignon. His sojourn there was to be short, however, as Giovanni di Vico and Francesco Ordelaffi (who had hired the famous [[condottiero]] [[Konrad von Landau]]'s "Grand Company") were menacing the fragile balance of his last conquests. Returned to Italy, Albornoz found an agreement with Landau, forcing Ordelaffi to surrender on [[July 4]] [[1359]].

Albornoz missed only [[Bologna]] to complete his rebuilding of the Papal States. When that city was attacked by [[Bernab<U+00F2> Visconti]] of [[Milan]], its ruler, [[Giovanni d'Olleggio]], decided to hand it over to Albornoz. In the meantime, Innocent died: the Spanish cardinal refused the tiara, and [[Urban V]] was elected. Under him Albornoz started the military campaign agaisnt Visconti and, when all attacks failed, Urban proclaimed a crusade against him.

As Urban's greatest desire was that of a crusade against the Turks, the two parts signed a hasty peace, which was highly favourable to Visconti. The relentless work of Albornoz had anyway paved the [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]] to [[Rome]] (1367).

As legate, Albornoz showed himself to be an astute manager of men and effective fighter. He began by making use of [[Cola di Rienzo]] (former leader of the citizenship freedom in Rome), whose release from prison at Avignon he secured. After the murder of the tribune in [[1354]] Albornoz pursued his task of restoring the pope's authority by intrigue and force with remarkable success. As a mark of gratitude the pope appointed him legate at [[Bologna]] in [[1367]], but he died at Viterbo the same year. According to his own desire his remains were carried to Toledo, where Henry of Castile had them to be entombed with almost royal honours.

The college of St Clement at Bologna was founded by Albornoz for the benefit of Spanish students.
