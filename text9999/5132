Sir '''William Jumper''', {{circa|1660}} &ndash; 12 March 1715, was an Irish naval officer born in [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]], [[County Cork]]. His exact year of birth is unknown, but he had obtained a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] as a [[second lieutenant]] on 29 November 1688. Within six years, his reputation had earned him command of [[HMS Weymouth]]. ''A Compendium of Irish Biography'' states:

{{quote|"Besides other important services, he captured off the coast of Ireland several French privateers, and in 1695 some French vessels in the Channel. He served under Sir George Rooke in the expedition against Cadiz, was instrumental in the reduction of Gibraltar, and signalized himself in a naval engagement off Malaga. Returning from the Straits with Sir Cloudesley Shovel in 1707, he arrived at Falmouth in safety on the 22nd October, the same day that Sir Cloudesley and part of his fleet were lost on the Scilly Isles. He was knighted, and in 1714 was appointed resident Navy Commissioner at Plymouth, and died 12th March 1715."}}
