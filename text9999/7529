==Career==
===Early years===
Crawford's father died when he was one year old, leaving an impoverished wife and mother, placed the baby in an [[orphanage]] asylum near [[Woodland, California]].  He taught himself music there. By age nine, he was playing a [[cornet]] in the orphanage band. At age 14 he left the orphanage to play piano in a small dance band, and then took a job playing piano in a ten-cent-admission silent film house. 

His early theatre organ experience was at Washington's Spokane Gem Theater in 1911 and at the Clemmer-owned Casino Theatre (on an eight-rank Estey organ).<ref>http://pstos.org/instruments/wa/spokane/casino.htm</ref><ref>http://theatreorgans.com/southerncross/Journal/More%20about%20Jesse%20Crawford%20-%20Foort.htm <U+2014> sourced from "Cinema Organ Herald, May 1933</ref> He next played briefly at theatres in [[Billings, Montana]], [[Spokane, Washington]] and [[Seattle]]. When he met [[Oliver Wallace]], Crawford learned about the then-new types of [[theatre organ]] sounds. Crawford<U+2019>s next jobs were playing at the Strand in [[San Francisco]] and the Mission Theatre in [[Los Angeles]].

===1920s: silent movie organist===
In the 1920s, Crawford began forming a fan base and was dubbed the of "Poet of the Organ" for his style of playing ballads in Chicago. In 1921, he was employed by the [[Balaban and Katz]] theatre chain playing its 29-rank [[Wurlitzer]] in the [[Chicago Theatre]]. Likewise, Crawford was hired to play a large Wurlitzer organ in [[Million Dollar Theatre|Grauman's Million Dollar Theatre]] in Los Angeles. 

From 1926 to 1933, he performed at [[New York City]]'s [[Paramount Theater (New York City)|Paramount Theater]], with his wife Helen (also an organist) playing a twin organ console. 

After some recordings for the small local [[Autograph Records]] label, Crawford made a series of [[gramophone record]]s for the [[Victor Records]] label which proved very popular with record buyers.  He had hits such as "Rose Marie", "Valencia" and "Russian Lullaby". Other popular songs included "At Dawning" and "Roses Of Picardy".

===1930s: Hammond organist===
With the end of the silent film era, work for theatre organists in movie houses dried up. Crawford played a [[Kilgen]] organ at Chicago's [[Century of Progress]] World's Fair in 1934, and in 1936 he got a job as staff organist in [[NBC]] studios in Chicago. In the 1930s, Crawford switched to the [[Hammond organ]], and began playing engagements across the United States. In addition to his numerous sound recordings, Crawford recorded player organ rolls on the Wurlitzer "R Rolls" system. His own compositions included "Vienna Violins", "Louisiana Nocturn", "Harlem Holiday", and "Hawaiian Honeymoon".

===Teaching and instruction book author===
In 1940, the self-taught Crawford undertook his first formal music study with Joseph Schillinger,  whose other students included [[George Gershwin]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Glenn Miller]], and movie score composers [[Leith Stevens]] and [[Nathan Van Cleave]]. He recorded Hammond organ [[LP album|LP]]s for [[Decca Records]] and worked and began writing, producing [[sheet music]] song arrangements for Hammond organ and instruction books. He also taught organ students, both in one-on-one lessons and in class style lessons, where he mostly lectured. He recorded his last two  LPs on the Simonton Wurlitzer organ.
