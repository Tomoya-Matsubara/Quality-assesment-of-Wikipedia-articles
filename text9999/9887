{{otheruses|Lumia (disambiguation)}}
The '''lumia''' (''Citrus <U+00D7> limon'' var. 'Lumia') is also called the '''pear lemon''' (''Citrus x lumia'' 'pyriformis'), remarking it's shape that resembles a [[pear]]. It is also called '''French lime''' and sometimes '''sweet lemon''', even-though it is not necessarily sweet. The fruit resembles a pear in shape, has a thick peel and is not very juicy. It can grow to a formidable size.

==Origin and Genetics==
The most known origin for the Lumia is from the Mediterranean basin. 
{{Citron varieties}}
A group of scientists working in the [[University of Catania]], [[Italy]] has shown by studying its chromosomes that the Pear lemon was first a hybrid of [[pommelo]] and citron, which then hybridized with regular lemon. Pear lemon is sometimes classified as a [[citron]] hybrid, thanks to it's thick peel and dryness of pulp. 

In [[University of California, Riverside]] they call it ''Citrus <U+00D7> limon'' L. Burm.f., with conflicting reports if it's acidic or not.
==Varieties==
The Lumia is also classified as: ''Citrus limon var. lumia''  Swingle and ''Citrus medica L. var. lumia''.

There is variety of Lumia called [[Forbidden fruit|Adam's apple]] or Pomme D'Adammo, and is also included under the name Citrus lumia, according to Risso & Poit, the variety name is ''pomum adami''. Pomme D'Adammo is of the same kind but a more rounded form.

Cultivated varieties includes: Born<U+00E9>o (Indonesia), Balaingue, Bitrouni and Otrodj (Iran).

==Chemistry==
According to a Japanese study of 1996, the [[Fruit_anatomy#Mesocarp|albedo]] extract of the Lumia, was shown to possess the highest inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase (IC50 = 24 <U+03BC>g/mL), among other citrus studies. Flavedo extract of ripe Lumia inhibited cyclooxygenase to the same degree as the albedo, more than the pulp extract.<ref>[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jf9505077 Screening for Inhibitory Activity of Citrus Fruit Extracts against Platelet Cyclooxygenase and Lipoxygenase]</ref>
