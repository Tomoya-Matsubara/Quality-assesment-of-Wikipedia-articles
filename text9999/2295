{{Biological classification}} 
'''Biological classification''', or ''scientific classification in biology'', is a method by which [[biologist]]s group and categorize [[organism]]s by [[biological type]], such as [[genus]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy|scientific taxonomy]], but should be distinguished from [[folk taxonomy]], which lacks scientific basis. Modern biological classification has its root in the work of [[Carolus Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]]. [[Molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so. Biological classification belongs to the science of [[systematics|biological systematics]].

==Taxonomic ranks==
{{Main|Taxonomic rank}}

In biological classification, '''rank''' is the level (the relative position) in a [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] hierarchy. There are 8 main [[taxonomic rank]]s: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species.

The most basic rank is that of [[species]], the next most important is [[genus]], and then [[family (biology)|family]]. Sometimes (but only rarely) the term "taxonomic category" is used instead of "rank".  

The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' defines rank, in the nomenclatural sense, as:
<blockquote>The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily). The ranks of the family group, the genus group, and the [[species]] group at which nominal taxa may be established are stated in Articles 10.3, 10.4, 35.1, 42.1 and 45.1.<ref>International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (1999) ''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Fourth Edition''. - International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature, XXIX + 306 pp.</ref></blockquote>

There are slightly different ranks for zoology and for botany, including subdivisions such as [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]].

== Early systems ==
===Ancient through medieval times=== 
Current systems of classifying forms of [[life]] descend from the thought presented by the Greek philosopher  [[Aristotle]], who published in his [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] works the first known classification of everything whatsoever, or "being". This is the scheme that gave such words as 'substance', 'species' and 'genus' and was retained in modified and less general form by [[Linnaeus]].

Aristotle also studied animals and classified them according to method of reproduction, as did Linnaeus later with plants. Aristotle's animal classification was eventually made obsolete by additional knowledge and was forgotten.

The philosophical classification is in brief as follows:<ref>''Categories'' Section 5 and ''Metaphysics'' Book 6, but the terms are used in many places throughout the writings of Aristotle.</ref> Primary substance is the individual being; for example, Peter, Paul, etc. Secondary substance is a [[predicate]] that can properly or characteristically be said of a class of primary substances; for example, man of Peter, Paul, etc. The characteristic must not be merely in the individual; for example, being skilled in grammar. Grammatical skill leaves most of Peter out and therefore is not characteristic of him. Similarly man (all of mankind) is not in Peter; rather, he is in man.

Species is the secondary substance that is most proper to its individuals. The most characteristic thing that can be said of Peter is that Peter is a man. An identity is being postulated: "man" is equal to all its individuals and only those individuals. Members of a species differ only in number but are totally the same type.

Genus is a secondary substance less characteristic of and more general than the species; for example, man is an animal, but not all animals are men. It is clear that a genus contains species. There is no limit to the number of Aristotelian genera that might be found to contain the species. Aristotle does not structure the genera into [[phylum]], class, etc., as the Linnaean classification does.

The secondary substance that distinguishes one species from another within a genus is the specific difference. Man can thus be comprehended as the sum of specific differences (the "differentiae" of biology) in less and less general categories. This sum is the definition; for example, man is an animate, sensate, rational substance. The most characteristic definition contains the species and the next most general genus: man is a rational animal. Definition is thus based on the unity problem: the species is but one yet has many differentiae.

The very top genera are the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]]. There are ten: one of substance and nine of "accidents", universals that must be "in" a substance. Substances exist by themselves; accidents are only in them: quantity, quality, etc. There is no higher category, "being", because of the following problem, which was only solved in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Thomas Aquinas]]: a specific difference is not characteristic of its genus. If man is a rational animal, then rationality is not a property of animals. Substance therefore cannot be a ''kind'' of being because it can have no specific difference, which would have to be ''non''-being.

The problem of being occupied the attention of scholastics during the time of the Middle Ages. The solution of St. Thomas, termed the analogy of being, established the field of [[ontology]], which received the better part of the publicity and also drew the line between philosophy and experimental science. The latter rose in the Renaissance from practical technique. Linnaeus, a classical scholar, combined the two on the threshold of the neo-classicist revival now called the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

===Renaissance through Age of Reason===
An important advance was made by the Swiss professor, [[Conrad von Gesner]] (1516<U+2013>1565). Gesner's work was a critical compilation of life known at the time. 

The exploration of parts of the [[New World]] by Europeans produced large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. The old systems made it difficult to study and locate all these new specimens within a collection and often the same plants or animals were given different names simply because there were too many species to keep track of. A system was needed that could group these specimens together so they could be found; the binomial system was developed based on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] with groups having similar appearances. In the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced, which, directed first to familiar kinds, was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. Advances in using this knowledge to classify living beings bear a debt to the research of medical anatomists, such as [[Hieronymus Fabricius|Fabricius]] (1537<U+2013>1619), [[Petrus Severinus]] (1580<U+2013>1656), [[William Harvey]] (1578<U+2013>1657), and [[Edward Tyson]] (1649<U+2013>1708). Advances in classification due to the work of [[entomologist]]s and the first [[microscopist]]s is due to the research of people like [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628<U+2013>1694), [[Jan Swammerdam]] (1637<U+2013>1680), and [[Robert Hooke]] (1635<U+2013>1702). [[Lord Monboddo]] (1714<U+2013>1799) was one of the early abstract thinkers whose works illustrate knowledge of species relationships and who foreshadowed the theory of [[evolution]].

=== Early methodists ===
Since late in the 15th century, a number of authors had become concerned with what they called ''methodus,'' (method). By method authors mean an arrangement of minerals, plants, and animals according to the principles of logical division. The term ''Methodists'' was coined by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in his ''Bibliotheca Botanica'' to denote the authors who care about the principles of classification (in contrast to the mere ''collectors'' who are concerned primarily with the description of plants paying little or no attention to their arrangement into genera, etc). Important early Methodists were Italian philosopher, physician, and botanist [[Andrea Caesalpino]], English naturalist [[John Ray]], German physician and botanist [[Augustus Quirinus Rivinus]], and French physician, botanist, and traveller [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]].

[[Andrea Caesalpino]] (1519<U+2013>1603) in his ''De plantis libri XVI'' (1583) proposed the first methodical arrangement of plants. On the basis of the structure of [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] and [[fructification]] he divided plants into fifteen "higher genera".

[[John Ray]] (1627<U+2013>1705) was an English naturalist who published important works on plants, animals, and natural theology. The approach he took to the classification of plants in his [[Historia Plantarum]] was an important step towards modern taxonomy. Ray rejected the system of dichotomous division by which species were classified according to a pre-conceived, either/or type system, and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation. 

Both Caesalpino and Ray used traditional plant names and thus, the name of a plant did not reflect its taxonomic position (e.g. even though the [[apple]] and the [[peach]] belonged to different "higher genera" of John Ray's ''methodus'', both retained their traditional names ''Malus'' and ''Malus Persica'' respectively). A further step was taken by Rivinus and Pitton de Tournefort who made [[genus]] a distinct rank within taxonomic hierarchy and introduced the practice of naming the plants according to their genera.

[[Augustus Quirinus Rivinus]] (1652<U+2013>1723), in his classification of plants based on the characters of the [[flower]], introduced the category of [[Order (biology)|order]] (corresponding to the "higher" genera of John Ray and Andrea Caesalpino). He was the first to abolish the ancient division of plants into [[herb]]s and [[tree]]s and insisted that the true method of division should be based on the parts of the [[fructification]] alone. Rivinus extensively used [[dichotomous key]]s to define both orders and genera. His method of naming plant species resembled that of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort. The names of all plants belonging to the same genus should begin with the same word (generic name). In the genera containing more than one species the first species was named with generic name only, while the second, etc were named with a combination of the generic name and a modifier (''differentia specifica'').

[[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] (1656<U+2013>1708) introduced an even more sophisticated hierarchy of class, section, genus, and species. He was the first to use consistently the uniformly composed species names that consisted of a generic name and a many-worded diagnostic phrase ''differentia specifica.'' Unlike Rivinus, he used ''differentiae'' with all species of polytypic genera.

==Modern systems==
===Linnaean===
{{Main|Linnaean taxonomy}}
[[Carolus Linnaeus]]' great work, the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1st ed. 1735), ran through twelve editions during his lifetime. In this work, nature was divided into three kingdoms: mineral, vegetable and animal. Linnaeus used five ranks: class, order, genus, species, and variety.

He abandoned long descriptive names of classes and orders and two-word generic names (e. g. ''Bursa pastoris'') still used by his immediate predecessors (Rivinus and Pitton de Tournefort) and replaced them with single-word names, provided genera with detailed diagnoses (''characteres naturales''), and reduced numerous varieties to their species, thus saving botany from the chaos of new forms produced by [[horticulturalist]]s.

Linnaeus is best known for his introduction of the method still used to formulate the [[scientific name]] of every species. Before Linnaeus, long many-worded names (composed of a generic name and a ''differentia specifica'') had been used, but as these names gave a description of the species, they were not fixed. In his ''Philosophia Botanica'' (1751) Linnaeus took every effort to improve the composition and reduce the length of the many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetorics, introducing new descriptive terms and defining their meaning with an unprecedented precision. In the late 1740s Linnaeus began to use a parallel system of naming species with ''nomina trivialia.'' ''Nomen triviale'', a trivial name, was a single- or two-word epithet placed on the margin of the page next to the many-worded "scientific" name. The only rules Linnaeus applied to them was that the trivial names should be short, unique within a given genus, and that they should not be changed. Linnaeus consistently applied ''nomina trivialia'' to the species of plants in ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1st edn. 1753) and to the species of animals in the 10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'' (1758).

By consistently using these specific epithets, Linnaeus separated nomenclature from taxonomy. Even though the parallel use of ''nomina trivialia'' and many-worded descriptive names continued until late in the eighteenth century, it was gradually replaced by the practice of using shorter proper names combined of the generic name and the trivial name of the species. In the nineteenth century, this new practice was codified in the first Rules and Laws of Nomenclature, and the 1st edn. of ''Species Plantarum'' and the 10th edn. of ''Systema Naturae'' were chosen as starting points for the Botanical and Zoological Nomenclature respectively. This convention for naming species is referred to as [[binomial nomenclature]].

Today, nomenclature is regulated by [[Nomenclature Codes]], which allows names divided into [[taxonomic rank]]s.

===Evolutionary===
Whereas Linnaeus classified for ease of identification, it is now generally accepted that classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of [[common descent]]. 

Since the 1960s a trend called [[Cladistics|cladistic]] taxonomy (or [[cladistics]] or cladism) has emerged, arranging taxa in an [[evolutionary tree]]. If a [[taxon]] includes all the descendants of some ancestral form, it is called [[monophyletic]], as opposed to [[paraphyletic]]. Other groups are called [[polyphyletic]].

A new formal code of nomenclature, the ''International Code of [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|Phylogenetic Nomenclature]]'', or ''[[PhyloCode]]'' for short, is currently under development, intended to deal with names of [[clade]]s. [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] ranks will be optional under the ''PhyloCode'', which is intended to coexist with the current, rank-based codes.

[[Domain (biology)|Domains]] are a relatively new grouping. The [[three-domain system]] was first invented in 1990, but not generally accepted until later. Now, the majority of biologists accept the domain system, but a large minority use the five-kingdom method. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called [[Monera]]). Consequently, the three domains of life are conceptualized as Archaea, Bacteria, and [[Eukaryota]] (comprising the [[Nucleus (biology)|nuclei-bearing]] eukaryotes).<ref>See especially pp. 45, 78 and 555 of Joel Cracraft and Michael J. Donaghue, eds. (2004). ''Assembling the Tree of Life''. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.</ref> A small minority of scientists add Archaea as a sixth kingdom, but do not accept the domain method.

[[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], who has published extensively on the classification of protists, has recently proposed that the [[Neomura]], the clade that groups together the [[Archaea]] and [[Eukarya]], would have evolved from [[Bacteria]], more precisely from [[Actinobacteria]].

==Authorities (author citation)==
The name of any taxon may be followed by the "authority" for the name, that is, the name of the author who first published a valid description of it. These names are frequently abbreviated: the abbreviation "L." is universally accepted for Linnaeus, and in botany there is a regulated list of standard abbreviations (see [[list of botanists by author abbreviation]]). The system for assigning authorities is slightly different in different branches of biology: see [[author citation (botany)]] and [[author citation (zoology)]]. However, it is standard that if a name or placement has been changed since the original description, the first authority's name is placed in parentheses and the authority for the new name or placement may be placed after it (usually only in botany).

==Globally Unique Identifiers for Names==
There is a movement within the [[Biodiversity Informatics|biodiversity informatics]] community to provide [[GUID|Globally Unique Identifiers]] in the form of [[LSID|Life Science Identifiers]] (LSID) for all biological names. This would allow authors to cite names unambiguously in electronic media and reduce the significance of errors in the spelling of names or the abbreviation of authority names. Three large nomenclatural databases (referred to as nomenclators) have already begun this process, these are [[Index Fungorum]], [[IPNI|International Plant Names Index]] and [[Zoo Bank]]. Other databases, that publish taxonomic rather than nomenclatural data, have also started using LSIDs to identify '''taxa'''. The key example of this is [[Catalogue of Life]]. The next step in integration will be when these taxonomic databases include references to the nomenclatural databases using LSIDs.
