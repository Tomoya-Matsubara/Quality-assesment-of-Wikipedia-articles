'''ZAD 2''' or '''Zahrat adh-Dhra<U+02BB> 2''' is an early [[Neolithic]] [[archeological]] site {{convert|1|mi|km}} north of the village of edh-Dhra on the [[Lisan Peninsula]], in modern-day [[Jordan]]. 

The site is a low, small [[tell]] mound at an altitude of {{convert|650|ft|m}} below sea level. Excavations were carried out to a depth of {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} in 1999 by Phillip C. Edwards of [[La Trobe University]].<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/25067020 Phillip C. Edwards and Emily House, The Third Season of Investigations at the Pre-Pottery Neolithic a Site of Zahrat adh-Dhra<U+02BF> 2 on the Dead Sea Plain, Jordan, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 347 (Aug., 2007), pp. 1-19, Published by: The American Schools of Oriental Research]</ref> Several rounded stone buildngs were found with [[plaster]] floors although lime-firing pyrotechnology was probably not used in their preparation. A large number of flint tools were found including [[sickle]]s, picks, [[axe]]s, drills, [[arrowheads]] and scrapers made from local flint sources. A few examples of stone tools made from other materials such as [[quartz]], [[obsidian]] and [[quartzite]] were discovered. Other discoveries included a [[ceramic]] figure, greenstone, some [[copper ore]] and two incised fragments of burnt [[limestone]] suggesting early neolithic use of [[art]] and [[symbols]].<ref name="NegevGibson2005">{{cite book|author1=Avraham Negev|author2=Shimon Gibson|title=Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&pg=PA552|accessdate=10 July 2011|date=July 2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9780826485717|pages=552<U+2013>}}</ref> [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon dates]] for the site range between 9140 and 8470 BC. This has suggested occupation during the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and possibly during the transitional phase into the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] between 8800 and 8600 BC that was identified in 2002 by [[Danielle Stordeur]] and [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Abb<U+00E8>s]].
