'''Cleopatra''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+039A><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03B1> <U+03A6><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03C1>; January [[69 BC]]<U+2013>[[November 30]] [[30 BC]]) was a [[Hellenistic]] co-ruler of Egypt with her father ([[Ptolemy XII of Egypt|Ptolemy XII Auletes]]) and later with her brothers/husbands [[Ptolemy XIII of Egypt|Ptolemy XIII]] and [[Ptolemy XIV of Egypt|Ptolemy XIV]]. She later became the supreme ruler of Egypt, consummated a liaison with [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], that solidified her grip on the throne, and, after Caesar's assassination, aligned with [[Mark Antony]], with whom she produced twins. In all, Cleopatra had four children, one by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] ([[Caesarion]]) and three by Antony ([[Cleopatra Selene II]], [[Alexander Helios]], [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]]). Her unions with her brothers produced no children: it is possible that they were never consummated; in any case, they were not close. Her reign marks the final end of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic Era]] and the beginning of the Roman Era in the eastern Mediterranean. She was the last [[Pharaoh]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] (her son by Julius Caesar, [[Caesarion]], ruled in name only before [[Augustus]] had him executed.).

After Antony's rival and Caesar's legal heir, Gaius Julius Caesar [[Augustus|Octavian]] (who later became the first [[Roman Emperor]], [[Augustus]]), brought the might of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] against Egypt, it is said that Cleopatra took her own life on [[November 30]], [[30 BC]], allegedly by means of an [[asp (reptile)|asp]]. Her legacy survives in the form of numerous dramatizations of her story, including [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', several modern [[Cleopatra (film)|film]]s and the HBO series [[Rome (TV series)|Rome]].

Cleopatra was a direct descendant of Alexander's general, [[Ptolemy I Soter]], son of Arsinoe and Lacus, both of Macedon. A Greek by language and culture, Cleopatra is reputed to have been the first member of her family in their 300-year reign in Egypt to have learned the [[Egyptian language]].
{{TOCleft}}
==Early years==
===Childhood===
Cleopatra is a Greek name, frequently used in Macedonia in the time of [[Philip II of Macedon]], and was borne by several members of the Hellenistic dynasties; hence the number, a modern device to distinguish her from other Ptolemaic Cleopatras.  She was the third daughter of the king [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]], probably also of her father's sister. Her nickname means "Loving her Father."

Little is known about Cleopatra's childhood, but she would have observed the disordered events and loss of public affection for the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] under the reign of her father. It is said that her father survived two assassination attempts when a servant found a deadly [[puff adder]] in his bed, and a servant who tasted his wine died afterward. Her eldest sister [[Cleopatra VI of Egypt|Tryphaena]] also tried to poison her, so she began using food-tasting servants. This disloyalty occurred for many reasons, including the physical and moral degeneration of the sovereigns, [[Centralized government|centralization of power]] and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. This led to uprising in and loss of [[Cyprus]] and of [[Cyrenaica]], making Ptolemy's reign one of the most calamitous of the dynasty.  When Ptolemy made a journey to Rome with Cleopatra, Tryphaena seized the Crown of Egypt.  Shortly after arrangements for a Roman assistance in Egypt, Ptolemy's followers assassinated Tryphaena and killed her guard.  Berenice's guards in turn killed those followers. 

In 58&nbsp;BC Cleopatra's older sister, [[Berenice IV of Egypt|Berenice IV]] seized power from her father. With the assistance of the [[Roman empire|Roman]] governor of [[Syria]], [[Aulus Gabinius]], [[Ptolemy XII]] overturned his eldest daughter in 55&nbsp;BC and had her [[Capital punishment|executed]]. This left Cleopatra with her husband and younger brother, [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator|Ptolemy XIII]], joint heirs to the throne.

===Accession to the throne===
[[Ptolemy XII]] died in March 51&nbsp;BC, making the 18-year-old Cleopatra and the 12-year-old [[Ptolemy XIII]] joint monarchs. The first three years of their reign were difficult, due to economic difficulties, famine, deficient floods of the [[Nile]], and political conflicts. Although Cleopatra was married to her young brother, she quickly showed indications that she had no intentions of sharing power with him.

In August 51&nbsp;BC, relations between the sovereigns completely broke down. Cleopatra dropped Ptolemy's name from official documents and her face appeared alone on coins, which went against Ptolemaic tradition of female rulers being subordinate to male co-rulers. This resulted in a cabal of courtiers, led by the [[eunuch]] [[Pothinus]], removing Cleopatra from power and making Ptolemy sole ruler in circa 48&nbsp;BC (or possibly earlier, as a decree exists from 51&nbsp;BC with Ptolemy's name alone). She tried to raise a rebellion around [[Pelusium]], but she was soon forced to flee Egypt with her only surviving sister, [[Arsinoe IV|Arsino<U+00EB>]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age | author=[[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]] | year=1990 |pages=661<U+2013>664 | id=ISBN 0-520-05611-6 | location= Berkeley | publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>

==Cleopatra and Julius Caesar==
===Assassination of Pompey===
While Cleopatra was in exile, Ptolemy became embroiled in the [[Caesar's civil war|Roman civil war]]. In the autumn of 48&nbsp;BC, [[Pompey]] fled from the forces of [[Julius Caesar]] to [[Alexandria]], seeking sanctuary. Ptolemy, only fifteen years old at that time, had set up a throne for himself on the harbour from where he watched as on [[July 28]] [[48 BC]] Pompey was murdered by one of his former officers, now in Ptolemaic service.  He was beheaded in front of his wife and children, who were on the ship he had just disembarked from. Ptolemy is thought to have ordered the death as a way of pleasing [[Julius Caesar]] and thus become an ally of Rome, to which Egypt was in debt. This was a catastrophic miscalculation on Ptolemy's part. When Caesar arrived in Egypt two days later, Ptolemy presented him with Pompey's severed, pickled head. Caesar was enraged. This was probably due to the fact that, although he was Caesar's political enemy, [[Pompey]] was a [[List of Republican Roman Consuls|Consul of Rome]] and the [[widower]] of Caesar's only daughter, [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]] (who died in childbirth with their son).  Caesar seized the Egyptian capital and imposed himself as arbiter between the rival claims of Ptolemy and Cleopatra.

===Caesar and Caesarion===
[[Image:Cleopatra VII coin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Contemporary coin of Cleopatra VII'']]Eager to take advantage of [[Julius Caesar]]'s anger with Ptolemy, Queen Cleopatra returned to the palace rolled into a [[Persian carpet]] and had it presented to Caesar by her servants: when it was unrolled, Cleopatra tumbled out. It is believed that Caesar was charmed by the gesture, and she became his mistress.Nine months after their first meeting, Cleopatra gave birth to their baby. It was at this point Caesar abandoned his plans to annex Egypt, instead backing Cleopatra's claim to the throne. After a short civil war, Ptolemy XIII was drowned in the [[Nile]] and Caesar restored Cleopatra to her throne, with another younger brother [[Ptolemy XIV of Egypt|Ptolemy XIV]] as new co-ruler.

Despite the thirty year age difference, Cleopatra and Caesar became lovers during his stay in Egypt between 48&nbsp;BC and 47&nbsp;BC. On [[23 June]] [[47 BC|47&nbsp;BC]] Cleopatra gave birth to a child, [[Caesarion|Ptolemy Caesar]] ([[nicknamed]] "Caesarion" which means "little Caesar"). Cleopatra claimed Caesar was the father and wished him to name the boy his heir, but Caesar refused, choosing his grand-nephew [[Augustus|Octavian]] instead. Ceasarion was the intended inheritor of Egypt and Rome, uniting the East and the West.

Cleopatra and Caesarion visited Rome between 47&nbsp;BC and 44&nbsp;BC and were probably present when Caesar was assassinated on [[15 March]], [[44 BC]]. Before or just after the assassination she returned to Egypt. When Ptolemy XIV died due to deteriorating health. Cleopatra made [[Caesarion]] her co-regent and successor.

===Cleopatra and Mark Antony===
[[Image:Lawrence Alma-Tadema- Anthony and Cleopatra.JPG|thumb|left|300px|''Anthony and Cleopatra'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].]]

In 42 BC, [[Mark Antony]], one of the [[Second Triumvirate|triumvirs]] who ruled Rome in the power vacuum following Caesar's death, summoned Cleopatra to meet him in [[Tarsus in Cilicia|Tarsus]] to answer questions about her loyalty. Cleopatra arrived in great state, and so charmed Antony that he chose to spend the winter of 41 BC<U+2013>40 BC with her in Alexandria. On [[25 December]] [[40 BC]] she gave birth to [[twin]]s, who were named [[Alexander Helios]] and [[Cleopatra Selene II]].

Four years later, in 37&nbsp;BC, Antony visited Alexandria again en route to make war with the [[Parthians]]. He renewed his relationship with Cleopatra, and from this point on Alexandria would be his home. He married Cleopatra according to the Egyptian rite (a letter quoted in [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] suggests this), although he was at the time married to [[Octavia Minor]], sister of his fellow triumvir [[Augustus|Octavian]]. He and Cleopatra had another child, [[Ptolemy_Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]]. At the Donations of Alexandria in late 34 BC, following Antony's conquest of [[Kingdom of Armenia|Armenia]], Cleopatra and Caesarion were crowned co-rulers of [[Egypt]] and [[Cyprus]]; [[Alexander Helios]] was crowned ruler of Armenia, [[Medes|Media]], and [[Parthia]]; Cleopatra Selene II was crowned ruler of [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Libya]]; and Ptolemy Philadelphus was crowned ruler of [[Phoenicia]], [[Syria]], and [[Cilicia]]. Cleopatra also took the title of Queen of Kings.

There are a number of unverifiable but famous stories about Cleopatra, of which one of the best known is that, at one of the lavish dinners she shared with Antony, she playfully bet him that she could spend ten million [[sestertius|sesterces]] on a dinner. He accepted the bet. The next night, she had a conventional, unspectacular meal served; he was ridiculing this, when she ordered the second course <U+2014> only a cup of strong vinegar. She then removed one of her priceless pearl earrings, dropped it into the vinegar, allowed it to dissolve, and drank the mixture.  The earliest report of this story comes from [[Pliny the Elder]] and dates to about 100 years after the banquet described would have happened.  The [[calcium carbonate]] in pearls does dissolve in vinegar, but slowly unless the pearl is first crushed.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ullman | first = Berthold L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleopatra's Pearls | journal = The Classical Journal | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 193-201 | publisher = | date = 1957 | url = }}</ref>

Antony's behavior was considered outrageous by the Romans, and Octavian convinced the Senate to levy war against Egypt. In 31 BC Antony's forces faced the Romans in a naval action off the coast of [[Battle of Actium|Actium]]. Cleopatra was present with a fleet of her own. Popular legend tells us that when she saw that Antony's poorly equipped and manned ships were losing to the Romans' superior vessels, she took flight and that Antony abandoned the battle to follow her, but no contemporary evidence states this was the case.

Following the [[Battle of Actium]], Octavian invaded Egypt. As he approached Alexandria, Antony's armies deserted to Octavian on [[August 12]] [[30 BC]]

===Suicide===
[[Image:The Death of Cleopatra arthur.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Death of Cleopatra'' by [[Reginald Arthur]]]]

Antony committed suicide, having been told Cleopatra was dead. According to the doctor Olympus (an eye-witness), he was brought to Cleopatra's tomb and died in her arms. A few days later, on [[November 30]], Cleopatra also died by snakebite. The ancient sources generally agree that she had two [[Asp (reptile)|asps]] hidden in a fig basket so as she was eating she would never know when she would die. Her two handmaidens died with her. Octavian, waiting in a building nearby, was informed of her death, and went to see for himself.<ref>{{cite book | title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]| author=[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith, William]] (ed.)| year=1867 |pages=802 | location= Boston | publisher=Little, Brown & Company}}</ref> 

Cleopatra's son by Caesar, Caesarion, was proclaimed pharaoh by Egyptians, but Octavian had already won. Caesarion was captured and executed, his fate reportedly sealed by Octavian's famous phrase: "Too many Caesars." This ended not just the Hellenistic line of Egyptian pharaohs, but the line of all Egyptian pharaohs. The three children of Cleopatra and Antony were spared and taken back to Rome where they were taken care of by Antony's wife, Octavia Minor, who was also Octavian's sister.

===Cleopatra in art, film, TV, and literature===
Cleopatra's story has fascinated scores of writers and artists through the centuries. While she was a powerful political figure in her own right, it is likely that much of her appeal lay in her legend as a great [[seductress]] who was able to ally herself with two of the most powerful men (Julius Caesar and Marc Antony) of her time.

===Ancient art<U+2014>triumph painting, sculpture===
The most famous painting of Cleopatra is one that almost certainly no longer exists now. Because the queen died in Egypt well before Augustus' triumph could be put on in Rome, in which she would have walked in chains, Augustus commissioned a large painting of her, which was carried in his triumphal procession, and which may have represented her being poisoned by an asp. The sources for the story are [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#86 Plut. Ant.&nbsp;86] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/2*.html App. Civ. II.102], although the latter may well refer to a statue, and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#22.3 Cass. Dio&nbsp;LI.21.3] reports that the "image" was of gold, and thus not a painting at all. A painting purported to be this work was engraved in the early 19th century: it was said to be in a private collection near [[Sorrento]]. Since then, this painting is said to have formed part of a collection in [[Cortona]], but there no longer appears to be any trace of it; its quiet disappearance is almost certainly due to its being a fake. For comprehensive details on the entire question, see the external links at the end of this article.

===Paintings, Renaissance onwards===
Cleopatra and her death have inspired hundreds of paintings from the [[Renaissance]] to our own time, none of them of any historical value of course, and most misleadingly depict her as a young woman at the time of her death; the subject appealing in particular to [[France|French]] academic painters.
