'''''A Bug's Life''''' (stylized as '''''a bug's life''''') is a 1998 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[adventure film]] produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]]. Directed by [[John Lasseter]] and co-directed by [[Andrew Stanton]], the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for "tough warriors" to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers. Flik recruits a group of bugs that turn out to be an inept circus troupe. [[Randy Newman]] composed the music for the film, which stars the voices of [[Dave Foley]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], [[Hayden Panettiere]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Joe Ranft]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Jonathan Harris]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Brad Garrett]], and [[Mike McShane]].

The film is a retelling of [[Aesop]]'s fable ''[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]''.<ref name="gore">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview |title=A Bug's Life (1998) |first=Chris |last=Gore |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref> Production began shortly after the release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw. The ants in the film were re-designed to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed new technical innovations in computer animation. During production, the filmmakers became embroiled in a public feud with [[DreamWorks]] due to a similar film, ''[[Antz]]''.

''A Bug's Life'' was released to theaters on November 25, 1998 by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and was a box office success, surpassing competition and grossing $363,398,565 in receipts.<ref name="mojo"/> The film received positive reviews from film critics, who commended the storyline and animation. The film has been released multiple times on home video.

==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->
Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, lives in a colony of ants. The ants are led by Princess Atta and her mother, the Queen, and they live on Ant Island, which is a small island in the middle of a dried creek. Flik is different and always unappreciated because of his problematic inventions. The colony is oppressed by a gang of marauding grasshoppers led by Hopper who arrive every season demanding food from the ants. When the annual offering is inadvertently knocked into a stream by Flik's latest invention, a harvester device, the grasshoppers demand twice as much food as compensation.

Given a temporary reprieve by the grasshoppers, the ants trick Flik into accepting his plan to recruit "warrior bugs" to fight off the grasshoppers. While Flik actually believes in the plan, the other ants see it as a fool's errand to get rid of Flik and save themselves trouble. Making his way to the "big city" (a heap of trash under a trailer), Flik mistakes a group of circus bugs, who have recently been fired by their money-hungry ringmaster, P.T. Flea, for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and agree to travel with him back to Ant Island.

After they arrive, the circus bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings. The circus bugs then attempt to leave, but are forced back by a bird. They save Princess Dot, Atta's younger sister, from the bird as they flee, gaining the ants' trust in the process. At Flik's insistence, they continue the ruse of being "warriors" so the troupe can continue to enjoy the attention and hospitality of the ants. The bird encounter inspires Flik into creating an artificial bird to scare away Hopper (who is deeply afraid of birds) and the other grasshoppers. While the bird is being built, Hopper reveals to the other grasshoppers how greatly the ants outnumber them and is afraid that the ants will eventually stand up against them.

The bird is constructed, but the circus bugs are exposed when P.T. Flea arrives searching for them, having had a change of heart. The ants exile Flik and desperately attempt to pull together enough food for a new offering to the grasshoppers. When the grasshoppers discover a meager offering upon their arrival, they take control of the entire colony and begin eating the ants' winter store of food. After overhearing Hopper's plan to kill the queen, Dot leaves in search of Flik and convinces him to return and save the colony with the bird model. The model nearly works, but P.T. Flea, mistaking it for a real bird, lights it on fire, causing it to crash and be exposed as a fake. Hopper has Flik beaten in retaliation, saying that ants are meant to serve grasshoppers. However, Flik defies Hopper and inspires the entire colony along with the circus bugs to stand up to the grasshoppers and drive them out of Ant Island.

Before Hopper can be disposed of, it begins to rain and during the chaos, he kidnaps Flik and flees. In the ensuring pursuit, Atta eventually rescues Flik after the circus bugs fail to save him. As Hopper viciously pursues them, Flik leads him to an actual bird's nest. Mistaking the real bird for another fake one, Hopper attracts its attention by taunting it. Hopper is picked up by the bird, who then feeds him to her chicks. Some time later, Flik has been welcomed back to the colony, and he and Atta are now a couple. As the troupe departs with the last grasshopper, Molt, as an employee, Atta is crowned the new Queen, while Dot gets the princess's crown. When the bugs say goodbye and leave Ant Island, Heimlich comes out of his cocoon and changes into, in his own words, a "beautiful butterfly". Unable to actually fly on his own, the other circus bugs assist Heimlich as they fly off the island.

===Development===
[[File:JohnLasseterOct2011.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[John Lasseter]], the director of ''A Bug's Life'', at the Austin Film Festival in October 2011.]]
During the summer of 1994, Pixar's story department began turning its thought to their next film.<ref name="PixarTouch01">Price, p. 157</ref> The storyline of ''A Bug's Life'' originated in a lunchtime conversation between [[John Lasseter]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]], the studio's head story team.<ref name="PixarTouch02">Price, p. 158</ref> Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn to the idea of insects as characters. Insects, like toys, were within the reach of computer animation at the time due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable ''The Ant and the Grasshopper''.<ref name="PixarTouch02"/> [[Walt Disney]] had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]]''. In addition, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] had considered producing a film in the late 1980s entitled "Army Ants", that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony but it never fully materialized.<ref name="bw">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm|title=''Antz'' vs. ''Bugs''|work=Business Week |date=November 23, 1998}}</ref>

As Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaption, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise.<ref name="PixarTouch02"/> Lasseter liked the idea and offered suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest.<ref name="PixarTouch02"/> At an early test screening for ''[[Toy Story]]'' in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]]. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early July under the title ''Bugs''.<ref name="PixarTouch02"/> Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7, 1995 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar.<ref name="PixarTouch03">Price, p. 159</ref> Lasseter assigned Stanton the job of co-director; the two men worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had found that the workday of a sole-director on a computer-animated feature was dangerous while working on ''Toy Story''.<ref name="PixarTouch03"/> In addition, Lasseter felt it would relieve stress and the role would groom Stanton for a lead directing position of his own.<ref name="PixarTouch04">Price, p. 160</ref>

===Writing===
In ''The Ant and the Grasshopper'', a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing  while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away.<ref name="PixarTouch02"/> Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just ''take'' the food.<ref name="PixarTouch02"/><ref name="inspiration">Pixar Animation Studios, official website, feature films, ''A Bugs Life'', The inspiration</ref> After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars - that the circus bugs who had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight.<ref name="PixarTouch04"/> He felt the circus bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. There was also no particularly good reason for circus bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act.<ref name=commentary>''A Bugs Life'', DVD Commentary</ref> Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.<ref name="PixarTouch04"/>

Stanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the [[red ant]], and changed him into the character that would become Flik.<ref name="commentary"/> The circus bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding about what Flik was recruiting them for. Lasseter agreed with this new approach and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a couple of months at Pixar working with Stanton on further polishing.<ref name="PixarTouch05">Price, p. 161</ref> The characters of "Tuck and Roll" were inspired by a drawing that Andrew Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in second grade.<ref name="inspiration"/> Lasseter had come to envision the film as an [[epic film|epic]] in the tradition of [[David Lean]]'s 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.<ref name="commentary"/><ref name="PixarTouch06"/>

===Casting===
The voice cast was heavy with television [[Sitcom|situation-comedy]] stars of the time: Flik was [[Dave Foley]] (who later stars in ''[[Monsters University]]'') of ''[[NewsRadio]]''; Princess Atta was [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] of ''[[Seinfeld]]''; Molt was [[Richard Kind]] (who later appeared in ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', and ''[[Cars 2]]'') of ''[[Spin City]]''; Slim was [[David Hyde Pierce]] of ''[[Frasier]]''; and Dim, the rhino beetle, was [[Brad Garrett]] (who would later star in ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'') of ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''.<ref name="PixarTouch07"/> Joe Ranft, member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track.<ref name="PixarTouch07"/>

The casting of Hopper proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice was [[Robert De Niro]], who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors.<ref name="PixarTouch07"/> [[Kevin Spacey]] met John Lasseter at the 1995 [[Academy Award]]s and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.<ref name=commentary/>

===Art design and animation===
Production was harder and more difficult for animators during production of ''A Bug's Life'' than ''Toy Story'', as computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models.<ref name="PixarTouch11"/> Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation, Rich Quade and [[Glenn McQueen]].<ref name="PixarTouch11"/> The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's "Flaming Wall of Death." Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he judged it was least likely to change.<ref name="PixarTouch11"/> Lasseter believed it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on [[Lego]] wheels, which they dubbed the Bugcam.<ref name="PixarTouch04"/><ref name="behind the scenes">''A Bugs Life'', DVD Behind the Scenes</ref> Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a [[stained-glass]] ceiling.<ref name="PixarTouch04"/> The team would also later seek inspiration from ''[[Microcosmos (film)|Microcosmos]]'' (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.<ref name="PixarTouch04"/>

The transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where ''Toy Story'' focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, ''A Bug's Life'' required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters.<ref name="PixarTouch05"/> Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the art department and animators studied insects closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs.<ref name="PixarTouch06">Price, p. 162</ref> The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive.<ref name="PixarTouch06"/> The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants.<ref name="PixarTouch06"/> The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800 ants. It was impractical for animators to control these ants individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically.<ref name="PixarTouch06"/> Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants.<ref name="PixarTouch06"/> The animators would only animate 4<U+2013>5 groups of approximately 8 individual ''universal ants''. Each one of these ''universal ants'' would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different eye color, different skin color, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same.<ref name="behind the scenes"/> It was partly based on Reeves's invention of a decade and a half earlier, particle systems, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.<ref name="PixarTouch07">Price, p. 163</ref>

The animators also employed [[subsurface scattering]]<U+2014>developed by Pixar co-founder [[Edwin Catmull]] during his graduate student days at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s<U+2014>to render surfaces more lifelike. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation.<ref name="PixarTouch12">Price, p. 173</ref> Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, ''[[Geri's Game]]'' (1997), was attached alongside ''A Bug's Life'' in its theatrical release.<ref name="PixarTouch12"/>

==Rivaling DreamWorks and ''Antz''==
During the production of ''A Bug's Life'', a public feud erupted between [[DreamWorks]]' [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], and Pixar's [[Steve Jobs]] & John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[David Geffen]] and planned to rival Disney in animation.<ref name="Isaacson307">{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|accessdate=August 3, 2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=307|isbn=1-4516-4853-7}}</ref> After DreamWorks' acquisition of [[Pacific Data Images]] (PDI)<U+2014>long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation<U+2014>Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called ''[[Antz]]''.<ref name="PixarTouch09">Price, p. 170</ref> By this time, Pixar's project was well-known within the animation community.<ref name="PixarTouch10">Price, p. 171</ref> Both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'' center on a young male, a drone with oddball tendencies who struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society.<ref name="PixarTouch13"/> Whereas ''A Bug's Life'' relied chiefly on visual gags, ''Antz'' was more verbal and revolved more around [[satire]]. The script of ''Antz'' was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.<ref name="PixarTouch13"/>

It was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg.<ref name="bw"/><ref name="Isaacson307"/> Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on ''Toy Story'' at the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] lot's [[Technicolor]] facility in [[Universal City, California|Universal City]], where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton.<ref name="Isaacson307"/><ref name="PixarTouch08"/> When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become ''A Bug's Life'' in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas.<ref name="PixarTouch08">Price, p. 169</ref> Lasseter had high hopes for ''Toy Story'', and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. "If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''" for computer-animation companies, he told various friends.<ref name="bw"/> "I should have been wary," Lasseter later recalled. "Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released."<ref name="Isaacson307"/>

When the trades indicated production on ''Antz'', Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true.<ref name="bw"/> Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed ''Antz'' came from a 1991 story pitch by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994.<ref name="bw"/> Another source gives [[Nina Jacobson]], one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the ''Antz'' pitch.<ref name="PixarTouch10"/> Lasseter, who normally did not use coarse language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone.<ref name="Isaacson308">{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|accessdate=August 3, 2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=308|isbn=1-4516-4853-7}}</ref> Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was "out to get him" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney.<ref name="bw"/><ref name="PixarTouch10"/> In truth, Katzenberg was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything.<ref name="PixarTouch10"/> Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled ''Bugs'' to open the same week as ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release.<ref name="PixarTouch10"/><ref name="Isaacson308"/> Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.<ref name="PixarTouch10"/>

Katzenberg moved the opening of ''Antz'' from March 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release.<ref name="PixarTouch10"/><ref name="ap">{{cite news|url=http://laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/october02/ants.htm|title=Of Ants, Bugs, and Rug Rats: The Story of Dueling Bug Movies|agency=AP  |date=October 2, 1998}}</ref> David Price writes in his 2008 book ''The Pixar Touch'' that a rumor, "never confirmed", was that Katzenberg had given PDI "rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have ''Antz'' ready first, despite Pixar's head start".<ref name="PixarTouch10"/><ref name="Isaacson308"/> Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of ''Antz'' if Jobs and Disney would move ''A Bug<U+2019>s Life'' so that it did not compete with ''The Prince of Egypt''. Jobs believed it "a blatant [[Extortion|extortion attempt]]" and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date.<ref name="bw"/><ref name="Isaacson308"/> Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for ''Toy Story'', as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time.<ref name="PixarTouch07"/> "I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you<U+2019>re allowing them to use you to screw me," Katzenberg said.<ref name="Isaacson308"/> He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on ''A Bug<U+2019>s Life'' without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put ''Antz'' on hold.<ref name="bw"/> Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.<ref name="PixarTouch11">Price, p. 172</ref>

As the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed ''Antz'' as a "schlock version" of ''A Bug's Life''.<ref name="PixarTouch12"/> Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen ''Antz'', told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it.<ref name="bw"/><ref name="PixarTouch13">Price, p. 174</ref> Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. "The bad guys rarely win," Jobs told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. In response, DreamWorks<U+2019> head of marketing Terry Press suggested, <U+201C>Steve Jobs should take a pill."<ref name="Isaacson308"/> Despite the successful box office performance of both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'', tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for ''A Bug's Life'', reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so.<ref name="Isaacson309">{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|accessdate=August 3, 2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=309|isbn=1-4516-4853-7}}</ref> Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation.<ref name="PixarTouch11"/>
