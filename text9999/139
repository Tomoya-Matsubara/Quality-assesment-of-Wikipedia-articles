'''''Guitar Hero Smash Hits''''' (titled '''''Guitar Hero Greatest Hits''''' in Europe and Australia) is a [[music video game]] and the fourth expansion game to the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]].  The game features 48 songs originally featured in five previous games in the series&mdash;''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]''&mdash;redesigning the songs to be based on [[master recording]]s and to include support for full band play first introduced to the series in ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]''.  The game was developed by [[Beenox]] and published by [[Activision]] for release on the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], and [[Xbox 360]] systems and was released around the world in the second half of June 2009.

The game reuses many elements from previous titles in the series, including ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Metallica]]''. Beenox designed the game around playing the greatest songs of the series at venues located in the greatest places on Earth, and created venues based on various [[Wonders of the World]] for the game. While the game's soundtrack and expansion into a four-player band were well received by reviewers, the game was highly criticized for being a full-cost standalone title instead of being [[downloadable content]] for existing games in the series.

{{See also|Guitar Hero#Gameplay|Guitar Hero World Tour#Gameplay|Guitar Hero: Metallica#Gameplay||l1=Common gameplay elements in the Guitar Hero series|l2=Gameplay in Guitar Hero World Tour|l3=Gameplay in Guitar Hero: Metallica}}
''Guitar Hero: Smash Hits'' plays similar to ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'', featuring support for a four-instrument band: [[lead guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[drums]], and [[vocal]]. In addition to using [[master recording]]s for each song, the songs have been charted to use gameplay features introduced in ''World Tour'' including the open bass strumming & slider sections for intense solos using the touchpad on the guitar bundled with World Tour.<ref name="ign hands-on"/> Certain songs have been recharted or remixed to be more accessible to the full band; for example, "[[I Love Rock N Roll]]" includes a drum and vocals solo without guitar portions that were omitted in the original ''Guitar Hero'', while the piano introduction in "[[Killer Queen]]" is tapped out by the lead guitar player.<ref name="gi preview"/> The game borrows gameplay and graphical elements from ''[[Guitar Hero: Metallica]]'', including the "Expert+" difficulty level using two bass drum pedals and the rearrangement of on-screen meters for band mode.<ref name="ign hands-on"/><ref name="gi preview"/> ''Smash Hits'' includes a Music Studio creation mode and is compatible with the "[[Guitar Hero World Tour#Custom songs|GHTunes]]" custom song sharing service present in ''World Tour'' and ''Metallica''. ''Smash Hits'' also includes all the game modes  present in ''World Tour'', including single player and band career modes, and the eight-player "Battle of the Band" mode.<ref name="ign hands-on">{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/971/971633p1.html | title = Guitar Hero Smash Hits Hands-On | first = Hilary | last = Goldstein | publisher = [[IGN]] | date=  2009-04-09 | accessdate = 2009-04-09}}</ref>

The game presents a story sequence that ties in with the Career mode, as has been present in more recent ''Guitar Hero'' games. In ''Smash Hits'', the players are challenged by the "God of Rock" to play at venues at various [[Wonders of the World]] in order to charge a power artifact; it is revealed later that the God of Rock is actually Lou the Devil in disguise seeking the power of the artifact, the real God trapped by Lou. The player's band is able to discover Lou's deception and free the God of Rock; the band then rejects the God of Rock's offer of ascention to immortality, instead wanting to return to Earth to continue to rock. After completing each venue, the players earn venue-specific clothing to customize their avatars.<ref name="gi preview">{{Cite web | url = http://gameinformer.com/News/Story/200904/N09.0410.1142.53447.htm?Page=1 | title = Encore!

==Development==
[[File:Ghsm venue.jpg|right|thumb|Beenox Studios developed venues for ''Smash Hits'' at various [[wonders of the world]], including the Amazon [[rain forest]].]]
''Guitar Hero: Smash Hits'' was one of three new titles for the Guitar Hero series announced in early 2009.<ref name="activision 2009 games">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/57203 | title = Three New Guitar Hero Games Coming This Year, Activision Planning 'Major Restage' of Franchise | date = 2009-02-11 | accessdate = 2009-02-11 | first = Chris | last = Faylor | publisher = [[Shacknews]]}}</ref> Though the game was initially called ''Guitar Hero: Greatest Hits'', cover art for the game in North America had shown the title had changed to ''Guitar Hero: Smash Hits''.<ref>{{cite web | url  = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58022 | title = Guitar Hero Greatest Hits Renamed | first = Nick | last =  Breckon | date = 2009-04-03 | accessdate = 2009-04-03 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}</ref> The game was still released as ''Guitar Hero: Greatest Hits'' in Europe and Australia.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/guitar-hero-greatest-hits-unveiled | title = Guitar Hero: Greatest Hits unveiled  | date = 2009-03-05 | accessdate= 2009-06-27 | first = Tom | last = Bramwell | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref>

Paul Gadbois, developer at Beenox Studios, identified that their goal for the game was to focus on the music from the past games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, and that the selection of the soundtrack was one of the core features they focused on first.<ref name="ign reveal"/> Songs were selected based on several factors, including songs that were not formerly available to Wii and PlayStation 3 owners, and songs that played well in both single player and band modes.<ref name="teamxbox q&a"/> They also thought of playing the "greatest songs" in the "greatest places", and developed eight new venues based on Wonders of the World, including "Amazon Rain Forest", "The Polar Ice Caps" and "The Grand Canyon".<ref name="ign reveal"/> The team opted to reuse the original ''Guitar Hero'' characters instead of attempting to bring in musical celebrities as was done in ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' and ''Guitar Hero: Metallica'', fearing that the star power would have outshone the music selection.<ref name="ign reveal"/> Beenox performed all of the major development efforts, including designing the venues, selecting the songs, and creating the note tracks, though Neversoft provided their own development tools and provided Beenox with their own insight from developing the other ''Guitar Hero'' games in the series.<ref name="teamxbox q&a">{{cite web | url = http://interviews.teamxbox.com/xbox/2425/Guitar-Hero-Smash-Hits-Developer-QA/p1/ | title = Guitar Hero Smash Hits Developer Q&A | date = 2009-05-29 | accessdate = 2009-07-08 | publisher = [[Team Xbox]]}}</ref> While the Beenox developers were provided with the note charts from the songs in their original games, they only looked at these after developing new charts for the songs on their own, and modified their new charts to accommodate sections from the originals that made them fun to play in the first place.<ref name="teamxbox q&a"/> The game's full setlist was revealed over the course of April and May 2009 by allowing users to vote on the order of the remastered tracks from the four previous games.<ref name="pr announce"/>

In North America, various retailers provided pre-order incentives for those who reserved ''Smash Hits''. [[Gamestop]] and [[EB Games]] gave away a pair of branded drumsticks with the game. [[Best Buy]] provided a discount towards any ''Guitar Hero World Tour''-related product with pre-orders of the game, and provided a limited supply of extra drum bass pedals for the "Expert+" mode with purchase of the game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=pcmcat184200050019&type=category | title= Free Kick Pedal | publisher = [[Best Buy]] | accessdate= 2009-06-27}}</ref> [[Game Crazy]] offered exclusive [[cheat code]]s as their incentive.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2009/05/27/pick-your-poison-with-guitar-hero-smash-hits-preorder-bonuses/ | title= Pick your poison with Guitar Hero: Smash Hits pre-order bonuses | date = 2009-05-27 | accessdate=  2009-06-27 | first = Dan | last=  Hickle | publisher = [[Joystiq]]}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
All 48 tracks in the game are master recordings of songs previously featured in the first five published games of the ''Guitar Hero'' series: ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'', and ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]''. "[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]" is a re-recording performed by [[Living Colour]] for ''Guitar Hero III'', while two other songs are taken from live concert recordings; all other songs are based on original studio recordings.  Although the game supports user-created songs through the "GHTunes" service (common to ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' and ''Guitar Hero: Metallica''), other existing downloadable content does not work with ''Smash Hits''.<ref name="ign reveal"/> Songs in either the Career single player or band mode are arranged in tiers roughly in order of difficulty for the particular instrument, with different orders for each of the five Career paths. However, all songs are playable from the game's "Quickplay" mode without completing any Career goals.<ref name="ign review"/> The songs included in the game are as follows.<ref name="ign reveal">{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/959/959442p1.html | title =Guitar Hero Compilation Revealed | publisher = [[IGN]] | first= Erik | last = Brudvig | date = 2009-03-04 | accessdate = 2009-03-04}}</ref><ref name="pr announce">{{cite web | url = http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/04-09-2009/0005003874&EDATE= | title = Activision Empowers Fans to Reveal Guitar Hero(R) Smash Hits Set List | publisher = [[PR Newswire]] | date = 2009-04-09 | accessdate = 2009-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/973/973171p1.html | title = Guitar Hero Smash Hits: Track Reveal Part 1 | publisher = [[IGN]] | first = Mark | last = Bozon | date = 2009-04-15 | accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/975/975486p1.html | title = Guitar Hero Smash Hits: Track Reveal Part 2 | first = Mark | last = Bozen | date = 2009-04-22 | accessdate = 2009-04-22 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/978/978058p1.html | title = Guitar Hero Smash Hits: Track Reveal Part 3 | publisher = [[IGN]] | first = Mark | last = Bozen | date = 2009-04-29 | accessdate = 2009-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://ps2.ign.com/articles/979/979822p1.html | title = Guitar Hero Smash Hits: The Full Track List | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2009-05-05 | accessdate = 2009-05-05 | first = Mark | last = Bozen }}</ref> Initially, twenty-one of these songs will be exportable to both ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]'' and ''[[Band Hero]]'' for a small fee, with music licensing limited which songs can be exported, with the possibility of more songs in the future.<ref name="ign gh5 hands-on">{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/101/1011988p1.html | title = Guitar Hero 5 Hands-on | first = Erik | last = Brudvig | date = 2009-08-07 | accessdate = 2009-08-07 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://guitarhero.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/guitarhero.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=24672&p_created=1251305800&p_sid=sg1eGSGj&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MTMsMTMmcF9wcm9kcz0wJnBfY2F0cz0mcF9wdj0mcF9jdj0mcF9zZWFyY2hfdHlwZT1hbnN3ZXJzLnNlYXJjaF9ubCZwX3BhZ2U9MSZwX3NlYXJjaF90ZXh0PWltcG9ydA!!&p_li=&p_topview=1 | title = Which songs are available for import into Guitar Hero 5? | publisher = Activision | accessdate = 2009-09-02 }}</ref>

''Guitar Hero: Smash Hits'' received moderate praise from reviews, many of which cited that the game itself demonstrates the over-saturation of the music game market and the sheer number of titles with the ''Guitar Hero'' series that Activision has marketed. Chris Roper of [[IGN]] summarized that the game "is the definition of 'milking'", noting that, save for the PlayStation 2 version, all of the songs in the game could have been distributed as [[downloadable content]] or reused within other compatible titles.<ref name="ign review"/> [[Jeff Gerstmann]] of [[Giant Bomb]] commented that "something about the game's full [...] price tag doesn't quite feel right" and reaffirmed that being able to select a handful of the songs to play again would have been a preferred method of distribution.<ref name="giant bomb review"/> Tom Bramwell of [[Eurogamer]] further suggested that a simultaneous release of both the retail product and the same songs as downloadable content would have been an improvement.<ref name="eurogamer review"/> Chris Kohler of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' listed ''Smash Hits'' on a list of "raw deals" for gamers, citing Activision's approach that results in "players end up paying more for segregated song lists", and contrasted the approach to that of the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series, in which downloadable content is integrated into existing games.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/06/gaming-ripoffs/ | title = Top 10 Raw Deals for Gamers | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date= 2009-06-26 | accessdate = 2009-06-27 | publisher = ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''}}</ref> ''[[Game Informer]]'''s Matt Helgeson noted that, ultimately, the cost per song was still cheaper than current prices for downloadable content, but he still felt the game's purpose was solely for "creating revenue for Activision".<ref name="gi review"/>

The song selection, use of master recordings, and expansion to the full-band experience were praised.<ref name="teamxbox review"/> Dan Amrich of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' called the selection an "excellent selection of material" that avoided the most popular songs in favor of those that "are the most fun to play".<ref name="oxm review"/> Addition of full band tracking for the songs was considered helpful to avoid making the game's material feel like "warmed-over leftovers from the series' past", according to Gerstmann.<ref name="giant bomb review"/> The mixing of some of the songs was also considered to be off, with Roper specifically noting a too-loud bass and too-soft vocals for "No One Knows".<ref name="ign review"/><ref name="g4 tv"/> Roper noted that the PlayStation 2 version of the game suffered from graphics "stuttering", making it difficult to hit notes even after refining the game's controller calibration, considering the impact as "crippling the game".<ref name="ign review">{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/996/996145p1.html | title = Guitar Hero: Smash Hits Review | first = Chris | last = Roper | date = 2009-06-17 | accessdate =2009-06-27 | publisher = [[IGN]]}}</ref>

The game's note tracks were particularly analyzed and compared with the songs' previous versions in the older games. While the note-tracking has generally been improved to avoid "walls of notes"&mdash;long sections of fast-moving notes requiring significant skill to surpass<ref name="mtv aaron">{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.ca/news/article.jhtml?id=8367 | title = 'Guitar Hero: Aerosmith' Lowdown - Why The Boston Band Is Getting Its Own Game | date = 2008-04-17 | accessdate = 2008-04-17 | publisher = MTV Canada | first = Stephan | last = Tolito }}</ref>&mdash;these patterns are significantly different from their previous incarnation and may take some getting used to.<ref name="ign review"/><ref name="giant bomb review"/> Roper also noted that the new features of ''Guitar Hero World Tour'', particularly the use of "slider notes" that use either the ''World Tour'' touchpad or simple tapping without strumming on any other guitar controller's frets, makes many of the more difficult parts of the songs easily passed, requiring less technical skill to complete; Roper cited his ability to easily pass the first solo in what is considered to be the series' most difficult song, "[[Through the Fire and Flames]]" in ''Smash Hits'' while he could not pass this section on ''Guitar Hero III''.<ref name="ign review"/> In contrast, Abbie Heppe of [[G4 TV]] found the recreation of the note tracking to have "varying degrees of success", noting that while some of the guitar solos are more manageable, there were questionable sections in other songs arising from the nature of Star Power phrases when it was changed in ''Guitar Hero III''.<ref name="g4 tv">{{cite web | url = http://g4tv.com/games/ps2/62409/Guitar-Hero-Smash-Hits/review/ | title = Guitar Hero Smash Hits Review | publisher  = [[G4 TV]] | date = 2009-06-29 | accessdate = 2009-06-29 | first = Abbie | last = Heppe }}</ref> Gerstmann said that the difficulty of the non-lead guitar portions of the game was not as high as that of the lead guitar, primarily due to these songs' having been selected originally for being played by guitar controllers and not by a full band.<ref name="giant bomb review"/> Heppe suggests that some of these problems may be due to the farming out of the series to a different developer with no previous experience in the series.<ref name="g4 tv"/> However, Bramwell was careful to note that Beenox Studios' effort on the game was strong, particularly with following the ''Guitar Hero: Metallica'' model, and their effort should not be dismissed due to how Activision chose to release the title.<ref name="eurogamer review"/>
