'''<U+00C1>lvaro Carlos Alsogaray''' (June 22, 1913 &ndash; April 1, 2005) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] politician and businessman. [[Minister of Economy (Argentina)|Minister of Economy]] during much of the 1959-62 period, he was one of the principal proponents of [[neoliberalism|economic conservatism]] in modern Argentina.
==Biography==
===Early career===
Alsogaray was born in [[Esperanza, Santa Fe]], in 1913, to a prominent local military family. A graduate of Argentina's Military Academy as an infantry officer, Alsogaray learned [[military engineering]] in the Army's technical academy and [[civil engineer|civil]] and [[aeronautical engineering|aeronautical engineer]] in [[Universidad Nacional de C<U+00F3>rdoba|C<U+00F3>rdoba University]].

He retired from the army with the rank of [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] and with two [[engineer]]ing degrees, which led to his being called ''el capit<U+00E1>n ingeniero''. He entered business, becoming an important contractor for [[State enterprise]]s such as FAMA, a predecessor of [[flag carrier]] [[Aerol<U+00ED>neas Argentinas]]; in this capacity, he briefly held public office during the presidency of [[Juan Per<U+00F3>n]], whose populist politics and policies would later be anathema to Alsogaray's thinking.<ref name=scarecrow>''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978.</ref>

After the [[revoluci<U+00F3>n libertadora|coup that removed Per<U+00F3>n]] in 1955, he held the posts of Under-secretary of Commerce and Minister of Industry, and founded the Independent Civic Party in 1956; the party fared modetly in the [[Argentine general election, 1958|1958 elections]].

===President Frondizi and the two "winters"===

To placate powerful agrarian interests and other [[conservative]]s, the otherwise progressive [[Arturo Frondizi]] named Alsogaray Minister of the Economy in early 1959.  Inheriting large trade deficits, Alsogaray sharply devalued the [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|peso]] and imposed severe credit controls on Argentina's large public banks.<ref name=p12>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-49222-2005-04-02.html ''P<U+00E1>gina/12'' :: El pa<U+00ED>s :: Alsogaray no lleg<U+00F3> al invierno {{es}}]</ref> Declaring that the economy "must go through winter",<ref>[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/frondizi/1959.htm Todo Argentina: 1959 {{es}}]</ref> the austerity measures were a boon to exporters; but, caused consumer prices to double in 1959, and real wages and construction to fall by about 20%.<ref>Lewis, Paul. ''The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990.</ref>  The resulting trade surplus and pro-growth policies pursued by Frondizi's unofficial point man on the economy, [[Rogelio Frigerio]], both contributed to a robust recovery in 1960 and 1961.<ref name=scarecrow/><ref name=todofr>[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/frondizi/index.html Todo Argentina: Frondizi {{es}}]</ref><ref name=came>[http://www.redcame.org.ar/index.php/came/noticia/1165 Cornide, Osvaldo. ''A 50 a<U+00F1>os de la asunci<U+00F3>n de Arturo Frondizi''. {{es}}]</ref>

Marginalized in favor of Frigerio after the 1959 [[recession]] and deeply unpopular, Alsogaray resigned early in 1961.  Indeed, Frigerio had been President [[Arturo Frondizi]]'s first choice for the critical Economy Ministry, an appointment thwarted by the military; Frondizi and Frigerio later founded a political party centered around the need for accelerated development.<ref name=todofr/><ref name=came/>

Unfortunately, Frondizi's efforts to mediate differences between the [[United States]] and [[Cuba]] resulted in a March, 1962, [[coup d'etat]] and Alvaro Alsogaray was able to use the influence of his brother Gen. [[Julio Alsogaray]] to secure several ministerial and planning posts under Frondizi's military-appointed successor, Senate President [[Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Guido]]. Reintroducing many of his restrictive 1959 policies, as well as nearly worthless "Ninth of July" bonds, which were issued in lieu of cash payments to public emloyees and government contractors, the economy again slipped into severe recession and, at the cost of depressed business investment, the trade balance again improved.<ref name=scarecrow/><ref name=todofr/> 

===Later career and the rise of Mar<U+00ED>a Julia===
Out of power after the election of Dr. [[Arturo Illia]] in 1963, Alsogaray devoted himself to undermining the new administration, even during the vigorous economic recovery that followed. Finding allies in conservative business and media interests, the powerful [[Church-state relations in Argentina|Roman Catholic Church]], and his influential brother Julio, Alsogaray was successful.<ref name=rock>Rock, David. ''Authoritarian Argentina''. University of California Press, 1992.</ref><ref>[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/illia/index.htm Todo Argentina: Arturo Illia {{es}}]</ref>  Following the 1966 coup against President Illia (who narrowly prevented a bloodbath), he was designated [[United States-Argentina relations|Ambassador to the United States]], a post he held until 1968.<ref name=rock/>

Alsogaray founded the New Force in 1972, though like the Independent Civic party, it fared poorly in the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|1973 elections]] that returned Per<U+00F3>n to power. A supporter of the [[National Reorganization Process]] that deposed the [[Peronist]] government in 1976,<ref name=p12/> he founded the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Argentina)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] (UCeD<U+00E9>) in 1982. Running as a right-wing, economically [[neoliberalism|conservative]] candidate on the latter ticket, he stood for the [[President of Argentina|Presidency]] in 1983 and 1989. Alsogaray received two million votes (10%) in his [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989 presidential bid]], behind only major party candidates [[Carlos Menem]] and [[Eduardo Angeloz]].

Continuing to enjoy a measure of support in [[Buenos Aires]]' affluent [[Barrio Norte, Buenos Aires|northside]], he and his daughter [[Mar<U+00ED>a Julia Alsogaray]] were elected the only two national [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|deputies]] for the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Argentina)|UCeD<U+00E9>]] in [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983]], and he served until 1999. A vehement anti-Peronist and anti-socialist, Alsogaray forged an alliance with the late Juan Per<U+00F3>n's [[Justicialist Party]] in 1989, following their nomination of pro-market Governor [[Carlos Menem]], and endorsed Justicialist candidate Eduardo Vaca that year in a tightly-contested seat in the [[Argentine Senate]] representing the City of Buenos Aires; Alsogaray's endorsement in the electoral college gave Vaca the seat, despite the latter's coming in second to centrist [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]] candidate [[Fernando de la R<U+00FA>a]].<ref name=ln>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=692635 ''La Naci<U+00F3>n'' (April 2, 2005) {{es}}]</ref>

A vocal supporter of the era's [[privatization]]s, he prevailed on President Menem to appoint his daughter, Mar<U+00ED>a Julia, Secretary of the Environment, in which post she served from 1991 to 1999, and himself served in numerous consultative posts during the Menem presidency, endorsing the populist-turned-conservative president in his [[Argentine general election, 1995|1995 re-election bid]].<ref name=p12/> Among his most notable roles in this era was as director of a feasibility study in 1995-96 for the replacement of Buenos Aires' two international airports for an island terminal on the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]]; opposed by de la R<U+00FA>a, who had been elected Mayor (and would later be President), the project never materialized.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/96/08/22/t-04201d.htm ''Clar<U+00ED>n'' (August 22, 1996) {{es}}]</ref> His UCed<U+00E9> party languished despite his renewed influence as much due to public mistrust of his policies, as because of rivalries in the party itself &ndash; notably between his daughter and Adelina D'Alessio de Viola (whom he had Menem appoint as head of the [[Banco Hipotecario|National Mortgage Bank]]). Commenting on the dispute, he remarked that ''"would it be that one's political party could do without affiliates...or women!"''<ref name=ln/>

===Legacy===
Alsogaray, who perennially sought [[television]] airtime, lived out his last few years in seclusion, and died in [[Buenos Aires]] in 2005 at the age of 91.  Adamantly [[conservative]], he was of the opinion that, if anything, the 1976-83 dictatorship was too moderate.  He felt that some of the most brutal torturers during [[Dirty War]], such as [[Alfredo Astiz]], were "heroes," and even once attempted to use his influence over the Menem administration to have a monument built in their honor.<ref name=p12/> In 1985 [[Universidad Francisco Marroqu<U+00ED>n]] granted Alsogaray with an *[https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees honorary doctoral degree]<ref>[https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees Honorary Doctoral Degrees at [[Universidad Francisco Marroqu<U+00ED>n]]]</ref>
