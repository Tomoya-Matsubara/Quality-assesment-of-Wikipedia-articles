'''''Freedom of Expression<U+00AE>''''' is a book about [[freedom of speech]] issues with respect to concepts of [[intellectual property]], written by [[Kembrew McLeod]]. The paperback edition includes a foreword by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. The book was first published in 2005 by Doubleday as ''Freedom of Expression<U+00AE>: Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity'', and in 2007 by University of Minnesota Press as ''Freedom of Expression<U+00AE>: Resistance and Repression in the Age of Intellectual Property''. The author recounts a history of the usage of counter-cultural artistry, illegal art, and the use of copyrighted works in art as a form of fair use and creative expression. The book encourages the reader to continue such usages, in art and other forms of creative expression.

The book received a positive reception, and Kembrew McLeod was recognized by the Intellectual Freedom Round Table of the [[American Library Association]] with the [[Eli M. Oboler]] Memorial Award,<ref name="alaaward" /><ref name="obolerbookaward" /> which honors the "best published work in the area of intellectual freedom."<ref name="idaho" /> A review in ''[[The American Scholar]]'' noted, "Kembrew McLeod ... delivers a lively, personal account of the ways intellectual property messes with people--and how he messes with intellectual property."<ref name="siva" /> ''[[American Book Review]]'' characterized the work as "a clever compendium of examples" for those familiar with its subject matter.<ref name="davis" /> The ''[[Journal of Popular Culture]]'' characterized the book as "an informative, thought-provoking, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny examination of specific ways the privatization of ideas suppresses creativity in contemporary culture. "<ref name="popular" /> ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' noted that McLeod's views echo prior comments about intellectual property by academics including Lawrence Lessig.<ref name="publishers" />

McLeod discusses the concept of [[freedom of expression]] with regard to cultural norms and the manner in which society allows corporations to influence discourse.<ref name="siva" /> The author places himself within the context of the book, including a discussion of his own pranks such as the 1998 registration of "freedom of expression", and subsequent cease and desist letter to AT&T.<ref name="siva" /> 

''Freedom of Expression&reg;'' delves into the history of counter-cultural artistry, including recounting episodes such as [[Dadaist]] art styles, and an incident where [[Vanna White]] initiated a lawsuit against a [[robot]] likeness for [[copyright infringement]].<ref name="davis" /> McLeod presents an exploration of [[fair use]] and encourages the reader to utilize copyrighted works in alternative forms of artwork.<ref name="davis" /> He gives chronological background on the song "[[Happy Birthday to You]]", and information behind the use of sampling in the music industry, as well as a discussion of illegal art.<ref name="popular" /> The author emphasizes that the threat of a lawsuit from a company is not necessarily indication of actual criminal activity, and these threats against artistry and creativity can be overcome through determination.<ref name="davis" />

==Reception==
''Freedom of Expression&reg;'' was recognized in 2006 by the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) with the [[Eli M. Oboler]] Memorial Award,<ref name="alaaward">{{cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/newspresscenter/news/pressreleases2006/may2006/mcleodgetsoboleraward.cfm|title=Kembrew McLeod receives Eli M.

In its place, the author wittily exposes a stifling shift of copyright law into an instrument of commercial interests."<ref name="alaaward" /> The award was given to McLeod on behalf of the Intellectual Freedom Round Table (IFRT), a committee of the ALA.<ref name="alaaward" /> Kembrew McLeod was the only recipient of the Eli M.

In a review of the book for ''[[The American Scholar]]'', [[Siva Vaidhyanathan]] of [[New York University]] wrote "Kembrew McLeod ... delivers a lively, personal account of the ways intellectual property messes with people--and how he messes with intellectual property."<ref name="siva">{{cite journal|issn=0003-0937|journal=[[The American Scholar]]|title=Celestial Jukebox|first=Siva |last=Vaidhyanathan |date=Spring 2005|pages=131<U+2013>135|volume=74|issue=2}}</ref> Vaidhyanathan commented on the author's writing style, "McLeod is ironic and witty, writing with a hip-hop-influenced youth-savvy diction that demonstrates his confidence and engagement with the material and the culture that means so much to him."<ref name="siva" /> [[Davis Schneiderman]] wrote positively of the work, in a review for ''[[American Book Review]]''.<ref name="davis">{{cite journal|journal=[[American Book Review]]|volume=27|issue=3|date=March 2006|page=11|issn=0149-9408|title=A Sample of Fair Use}}</ref> Schneiderman compared the book to similar works on the subject matter, including ''No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies'' (2000) by Naomi Klein, and writings of [[Michael Moore]] and [[Al Franken]].<ref name="davis" /> 

A review by [[Eric Anderson]] of [[Bowling Green State University]] writing in the ''[[Journal of Popular Culture]]''  praised the author's use of interviews throughout the book, "''Freedom of Expression&reg;'' shines with McLeod's broad use of interviews. From legendary music engineer and producer Steve Albini to hip-hop pioneer Kool D. J. Herc, from film archivist Rick Prelinger to famed film director John Waters, McLeod records and reports the voices of creative people who have been encumbered by the contemporary intellectual property regime. The incorporation of these interviews, demonstrating as they do specific examples of creativity obstructed in specific ways, is this book's most important contribution."<ref name="popular">{{cite journal|journal=[[Journal of Popular Culture]]|last=Anderson|first=Eric|volume=39|issue=1|date=February 2006|pages=152<U+2013>153|issn=0022-3840|title=Freedom of Expression&reg;}}</ref> Anderson characterized the book as "an informative, thought-provoking, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny examination of specific ways the privatization of ideas suppresses creativity in contemporary culture. "<ref name="popular" /> Anderson noted the uncommon tactic by McLeod and the book's publisher of making the book freely available via [[Creative Commons]] license.<ref name="popular" /> 

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed the book and compared McLeod's tactic of following his trademarked phrase with "&reg;" as a satire of the registration of "[[fair and balanced]]" as a trademark by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]].<ref name="publishers">{{cite journal|journal=[[Publishers Weekly]]|volume=251|issue=51|date=December 20, 2004|issn=0000-0019}}</ref> The review commented of the author's argumentation, "While McLeod's arguments aren't original, his entertaining examples and punchy writing nicely amplify the concerns voiced by an increasing number of intellectual property scholars, such as Lawrence Lessig."<ref name="publishers" /> The review noted regarding the author's writing style, "Although he evokes dark, almost Orwellian images throughout, McLeod manages an upbeat spin, citing the 'egalitarian' nature of the new technologies and a growing awareness of the need to return to a place where 'freedom of expression' is once again 'a meaningful concept that guides our political, social and creative lives.'"<ref name="publishers" />
