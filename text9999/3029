'''King's Highway 64''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 64''', is a [[Highways in Ontario|provincially maintained highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]], connecting [[Ontario Highway 69|Highway&nbsp;69]] north of the [[French River (Ontario)|French River]] with [[Ontario Highway 11|Highway&nbsp;11]] at [[Marten River, Ontario|Marten River]], via [[Ontario Highway 17|Highway&nbsp;17]] west of [[Sturgeon Falls, Ontario|Sturgeon Falls]]. The route serves several communities along the north shore of the French River and west shore of [[Lake Nipissing]] as it travels from Highway&nbsp;69 to Highway&nbsp;17. North of Sturgeon Falls, the highway provides a shortcut between Highway&nbsp;17 and Highway&nbsp;11 northwest of [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]].

Highway&nbsp;64 was first assumed in 1937, the year that the Ontario [[Department of Highways]] (DHO) merged with the Department of Northern Development (DND) and began assigning route numbers in northern Ontario. It initially connected only Highway&nbsp;17 and Highway&nbsp;11, as Highway&nbsp;69 was not completed through French River until after [[World War II]]. In 1956, the route was extended southwest to [[Rutter, Ontario|Rutter]] via [[No<U+00EB>lville, Ontario|No<U+00EB>lville]] to meet Highway&nbsp;69, establishing the route as it exists today.

== Route description ==
The southern terminus of Highway&nbsp;64 is an intersection with Highway&nbsp;69 in [[Sudbury District, Ontario|Sudbury District]] at Rutter. The highway travels east for approximately {{convert|26|km|0}}, where it intersects with [[Ontario Highway 528|Highway&nbsp;528]]. At that intersection, Highway&nbsp;528 continues east, while Highway&nbsp;64 turns north for four kilometres to No<U+00EB>lville, where it intersects with [[Ontario Highway 535|Highway&nbsp;535]]. Highway&nbsp;535 continues north, while Highway&nbsp;64 heads east again for six kilometres to the community of [[Chartrand Corner, Ontario|Chartrand Corner]].<ref name="2010 mapart">{{cite map

The highway continues, alternating in northward and eastward segments around the west arm of [[Lake Nipissing]], crossing into [[Nipissing District]] just north of [[Mashkinonje Provincial Park]], and eventually intersecting with Highway&nbsp;17 at [[Verner, Ontario|Verner]]. It then shares the routing of Highway&nbsp;17 eastward for {{convert|15|km|0}}, to Sturgeon Falls, where it again heads northward for 57 kilometres to its northern terminus, intersecting Highway&nbsp;11 at Marten River.<ref name="2010 mapart" />

The [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario]] routinely performs traffic analysis on provincial highways, generating an average vehicle count per day over the course of a year at various sections along the routes. In 2010, the busiest section of Highway&nbsp;64 was between Highway&nbsp;69 and [[Ontario Highway 607|Highway&nbsp;607]], carrying an average of 1,850 vehicles per day. Likewise, the least busy section is at the opposite end of the highway, between Highway&nbsp;539 and Highway&nbsp;11, carrying an average of 750 vehicles per day.<ref name="km" />

== History ==
The Sturgeon Falls Road was first assumed by the DHO as Highway&nbsp;64 on August&nbsp;25, 1937, shortly after the merger with the DND. The route was {{convert|53.6|km|1}} long when it was first established, connecting Highway&nbsp;11 and Highway&nbsp;17.<ref name="assumed">{{cite report

 | section   = Appendix 3 - Schedule of Assumptions and Reversions
 | page      = 80}}</ref>
As Highway&nbsp;69 did not exist between Parry Sound and Sudbury until the 1950s, there was no need for a second highway connection through the French River area.<ref name="1949 map">{{cite map

However, on January&nbsp;25, 1956 the highway was extended south through Nipissing District, followed on February&nbsp;8, 1956 with an extension through Sudbury District to the now-completed Highway&nbsp;69.<ref>{{cite report

This brough Highway&nbsp;64 to its current length. Since then, aside from paving and minor realignments, Highway&nbsp;64 has remained unchanged.<ref name="2010 mapart" />
