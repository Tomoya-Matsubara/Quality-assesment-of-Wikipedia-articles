The '''Luxembourg film industry''' is quite small, but this is unsurprising given that the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] has a population of only about 400,000 people. However, many films have been made in the country, both by native filmmakers and by people from other countries.

In 1993, ''[[Dammentour]]'' by [[Paul Scheuer]] (AFO-Productions) and ''[[Hochz<U+00E4>itsnuecht]]'' (Paul Cruchten) won awards at the [[Max Oph<U+00FC>ls Festival]] in [[Saarbr<U+00FC>cken]].
