'''''Disembowelment''''' is a compilation of all the recorded material by the [[Australia]]n [[death/doom]] band [[Disembowelment (band)|Disembowelment]]. It was released on 28 June 2005 by [[Relapse Records]] as a two-CD set in a gatefold package with the band's logo embossed on the cover. Included with the album was a booklet featuring an extensive biography of the band written by [[drum]]mer Paul Mazziotta. A limited edition of the album contained a third CD comprising four tracks, one of which is a cover of the Necrovore song "Slaughtered Remains". It was also issued as a triple LP by 3XM Productions in a limited edition of 500. Disc One of this collection is the band's 1993 album ''[[Transcendence Into The Peripheral]]'' in its entirety. Disc Two is composed of the 1992 EP ''Dusk'' (tracks 1 - 3), an early version of the song "Excoriated" titled "Extracted Nails" that featured only on a compilation album called ''Pantalgia'' from 1991 and the remainder is the complete 1990 demo "Mourning September".
