'''Ronald Wilson Reagan''' (February 6, 1911 <U+2013> June 5, 2004) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|40th]] [[President of the United States]] (1981<U+2013>1989) and the [[List of Governors of California|33rd]] [[Governor of California]] (1967<U+2013>1975).<ref name="Reeves">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_50.shtml Richard Reeves] "My Years with Ronald Reagan," ''American Heritage'', Feb./March 2006.</ref>

Born in [[Tampico, Illinois]], Reagan moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1937. He began a career as an [[actor]], first in films and later television, appearing in over fifty movie productions and gaining enough success to become a famous man. Some of his most notable roles are in ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]'' and ''[[Kings Row]]''. Reagan served as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], and later spokesman for [[General Electric]] (GE); his start in politics occurred during his work for GE. Originally a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in 1962. After delivering a [[A Time for Choosing|rousing speech]] in support of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|two years later]] and [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|again in 1970]]. He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] as well as [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], but won both the nomination and election in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]].

As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", advocated controlling the money supply to reduce inflation, and spurring economic growth by reducing [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981|tax rates]], government regulation of the economy, and certain types of government spending. In his first term he survived an [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]], [[Air traffic controllers' strike of 1981|took a hard line against labor unions]], and ordered [[Invasion of Grenada|military actions]] in [[Grenada]]. He was reelected in a [[United States presidential election, 1984|landslide in 1984]], proclaiming it was "[[Morning in America]]". His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the [[Cold War]], the [[bombing of Libya]], and the revelation of the [[Iran-Contra affair]]. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an "[[evil empire]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2008/4/2008_4_18.shtml|title=The Evil Empire|publisher=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|date= Spring/Summer 2008|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> he [[Reagan Doctrine|supported anti-Communist movements worldwide]] and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of [[d<U+00E9>tente]] by ordering a massive military buildup in an arms race with the USSR. Reagan negotiated with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], culminating in the [[INF Treaty]] and the decrease of both countries' nuclear arsenals.

Reagan left office in 1989.

Reagan began his political career as a liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], admirer of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and active supporter of [[New Deal Coalition|New Deal policies]], but in the early 1950s he shifted to the right and endorsed the presidential candidacies of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1952 and 1956 as well as [[Richard Nixon]] in 1960 while remaining a Democrat.<ref>Pemberton (1998) pp 29<U+2013>31; Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 132</ref> His many GE speeches<U+2014>which he wrote himself<U+2014>were non-partisan but carried a conservative, pro-business message; he was influenced by [[Lemuel Boulware]], a senior GE executive.

Reagan endorsed the campaign of conservative presidential contender [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964. Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. He revealed his ideological motivation in a famed speech delivered on October 27, 1964: "The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose.

Shortly after the beginning of his term, Reagan tested the [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential waters in 1968]] as part of a "Stop Nixon" movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's Southern support<ref name="Stormy">Fischer, Klaus (2006), pp. 241<U+2013>243</ref> and be a compromise candidate<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899963,00.html|title=The New Rules of Play|work=Time|date=March 8, 1968 |accessdate=2007-10-16 }}</ref> if neither Nixon nor second-place [[Nelson Rockefeller]] received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the [[1968 Republican National Convention|Republican convention]].

Reagan was involved in high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era. On May 15, 1969, during the [[People's Park (Berkeley)#"Bloody Thursday" and Its Aftermath|People's Park protests]] at UC Berkeley, Reagan sent the [[California Highway Patrol]] and other officers to quell the protests, in an incident that became known as "Bloody Thursday."<ref name="Cannon50">Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 50</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904149,00.html |accessdate=2007-12-09 |date=February 16, 1970|title=Postscript to People's Park|work=Time}}</ref> Reagan then called out 2,200 [[United States National Guard|state National Guard]] troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks in order to crack down on the protesters.<ref name="Cannon50"/> When the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] kidnapped [[Patty Hearst]] in Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor, Reagan joked, "It's just too bad we can't have an epidemic of [[botulism]]."<ref>{{cite news|title=Reagan Raps Press on Botulism Quote|date=March 14, 1974|work=The Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, California}}</ref>

Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was beginning. Democratic California state senator [[Anthony Beilenson]] introduced the "Therapeutic Abortion Act," in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California.<ref name="Cannon50"/> The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it.<ref name="Cannon51">Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 51</ref> About two million abortions would be performed as a result, most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.<ref name="Cannon51"/> Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and stated that had he been more experienced as governor, it would not have been signed. After he recognized what he called the "consequences" of the bill, he announced that he was [[pro-life]].<ref name="Cannon51"/> He maintained that position later in his political career, [[wikiquote:Ronald Reagan#Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation (1983)|writing extensively about abortion]].<ref>Reagan, Ronald.

Despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in 1968,<ref>''[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/13/local/me-history13]''</ref> Reagan was re-elected in 1970, defeating "Big Daddy" [[Jesse Unruh]]. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned [[capital punishment]], which he strongly supported.<ref name="Rest of Me"/> His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued its ''[[California v. Anderson|People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California prior to 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when [[Aaron Mitchell]]'s sentence was carried out by the state in [[San Quentin|San Quentin's]] gas chamber.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Seneker, Carl J|title=Governor Reagan and Executive Clemency|journal=California Law Review|volume=55|issue=2|pages=412<U+2013>418 |publisher=JSTOR |month=May |year=1967|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0008-1221(196705)55%3A2%3C412%3AGRAEC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-M|doi=10.2307/3479351|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref>

Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending "the welfare bums back to work," he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M}}</ref>

In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] in a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the [[American Conservative Union]] which became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html|title=Biography of Gerald R.

American peacekeeping forces in [[Beirut]], a part of [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|a multinational force]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] who had been earlier deployed by Reagan, were attacked on October 23, 1983. The [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|Beirut barracks bombing]] resulted in the deaths of 241 American servicemen and the wounding of more than 60 others by a suicide truck bomber. Reagan sent a White House team to the site four days later, led by his Vice President, George H.W. Bush.

[[File:ElectoralCollege1984.svg|thumb|right|1984 presidential electoral votes by state. Reagan (red) won every state except for Mondale's home state of [[Minnesota]] (and [[Washington, D.C.]])]]

Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], on a wave of positive feeling. He proclaimed that it was "[[Morning in America|morning again in America]]",<ref name="agpi"/> regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U.S. athletes at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]] that summer, among other things. He became the first American president to open an Olympic Games held in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sok.se/inenglish/losangeles1984.4.18ea16851076df63622800011008.html|title=Los Angeles 1984|publisher=Swedish Olympic Committee|accessdate=March 7, 2007}}</ref>

Reagan's opponent in the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]] was former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]]. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, it was questioned whether he was capable to be president for another term.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/editors200410040912.asp|title=The Debate: Mondale vs. Reagan|work=National Review|date=October 4, 2004|accessdate=May 25, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/newshour/84_1stprez-analysis.html|title=Reaction to first Mondale/Reagan debate |publisher=PBS |date=October 8, 1984 |accessdate=December 31, 2007}}</ref> Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign.

===Second term, 1985<U+2013>1989===
Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the [[White House]]. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] the following day. January 21 was one of the [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|coldest days on record]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol.

[[File:President Reagan being sworn in for second term in the rotunda at the U.S. Capitol 1985.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan is sworn in for a second term as president in the Capitol Rotunda]]
In 1985, Reagan visited a German military cemetery in [[Bitburg]] to lay a wreath with West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of 49 members of the [[Waffen-SS]]. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery "victims", which ignited a stir over whether he had equated the SS men to [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victims; [[Pat Buchanan]], Director of Communications under Reagan, argued that the notion was false.<ref>{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Pat.|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|title=Pat Buchanan's Response to Norman Podhoretz's OP-ED|publisher=The Internet Brigade|year=1999|accessdate=September 3, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927193354/http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,<ref>Reeves, Richard (2005), p. 249</ref> the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl.

The disintegration of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] on January 28, 1986 proved a pivotal moment in Reagan's presidency.

====War on Drugs====
Midway into his second term, Reagan declared more militant policies in the [[War on Drugs]]. He said that "drugs were menacing our society" and promised to fight for drug-free schools and workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lamar, Jacob V., Jr|title=Rolling Out the Big Guns|work=Time|date=September 22, 1986|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962371-1,00.html|accessdate=August 20, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/crime09.htm |title=The Drug War as Race War|accessdate=April 11, 2007|author=Randall, Vernellia R.|date=April 18, 2006|publisher=The University of Dayton School of Law}}</ref>

Relations between [[Libya]] and the U.S. under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|Gulf of Sidra incident]] in 1981.

====Immigration====
Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] in 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit [[illegal immigrants]], required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted [[amnesty]] to approximately 3 million illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously. Critics argue that its contention subjecting employers to sanctions were without teeth and that it failed to stem illegal immigration.<ref>{{cite news|author=Graham, Otis|date=January 27, 2003|url=http://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham_writings/art_ronald_reagans_big_mistake.html |title=Ronald Reagan's Big Mistake|work=The American Conservative|accessdate=August 15, 2007}}</ref> Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished [[Statue of Liberty]], Reagan said, "The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society.

==Legacy==
[[File:President Reagan speaking in Minneapolis 1982.jpg|thumb|Ronald Reagan at a rally for Senator [[David Durenberger]] in Bloomington, Minnesota 1982]]
Reagan's legacy is mixed, but his historical reputation has risen steadily from the time he left office. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy<ref>Hayward (2009) pp 635<U+2013>38</ref> and a peaceful end to the Cold War.<ref>Beschloss, Michael (2007), p. 324</ref> Critics argue that his economic policies caused huge budget deficits, quadrupling the United States national debt,<ref name="Cannon128"/> and that the Iran-Contra affair lowered American credibility.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilman, Larry|url=http://www.espionageinfo.com/Int-Ke/Iran-Contra-Affair.html|title=Iran-Contra Affair|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}</ref> As time has passed, he has generally come to be viewed in a more positive light, and ranks highly among presidents in many public opinion polls.<ref name="abc polls"/> In presidential surveys he has consistently been ranked in the first and second quartiles, with more recent surveys generally ranking Reagan in the first quartile of U.S. presidents.

[[Edwin Feulner]], President of the [[Heritage Foundation]], said that Reagan "helped create a safer, freer world" and said of his economic policies: "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny."<ref>{{cite web|author=Feulner, Edwin J., Ph.D.|url=http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|title=The Legacy of Ronald Reagan|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=June 9, 2004 |accessdate=August 23, 2007}}</ref> However, [[Mark Weisbrot]], co-Director of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], said that Reagan's "economic policies were mostly a failure",<ref>{{cite web |author=Weisbrot, Mark.|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0607-09.htm|title=Ronald Reagan's Legacy|publisher=Common Dreams News Center|date=June 7, 2004 |accessdate=August 23, 2007}}</ref> and [[Howard Kurtz]] of ''The Washington Post'' stated that Reagan was "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest".<ref>{{cite news |last=Kurtz |first=Howard |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21671-2004Jun7.html |title=Reagan: The Retake |work=The Washington Post |date=June 7, 2004 |accessdate=August 25, 2005}}</ref>

Many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics. "As of this writing, among academic historians, the Reagan revisionists<U+2014>who view the 1980s as an era of mixed blessings at worst, and of great forward strides in some renditions<U+2014>hold the field", reports Rossinow (2007).<ref>Doug Rossinow, "Talking Points Memo", in ''American Quarterly'' 59.4 (2007) p. 1279. For more historiographical support see: Troy (2009); Hayward (2009); Wilentz (2008); also Charles L. Ponce de Leon, "The New Historiography of the 1980s" in ''Reviews in American History,'' Volume 36, Number 2, June 2008, pp. 303<U+2013>314; Whitney Strub, "Further into the Right: The Ever-Expanding Historiography of the U.S. New Right", ''Journal of Social History,'' Volume 42, Number 1, Fall 2008, pp. 183<U+2013>194; Kim Phillips-Fein, "Ronald Reagan: Fate, Freedom, and Making of History", ''Enterprise & Society,'' Volume 8, Number 4, December 2007, pp. 986<U+2013>988.</ref>

The first generation of writing about Reagan comprised studies on the right that approached [[hagiography]], and on the left a devil theory, all relying on popular journalism for their facts. A second generation has emerged, based on newly available documents from the archives, that provides a much more sophisticated and complex view. The scholars of the second generation have reached a consensus,<ref>David Henry in ''Journal of American History'' December 2009 v. 96#3 p. 934</ref> as summarized by British historian M. J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American self respect, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.<ref>M.J. Heale in Cheryl Hudson and Gareth Davies, eds. ''Ronald Reagan and the 1980s: Perceptions, Policies, Legacies'' (2008) p. 250</ref>

===Cold War===
