'''Tyler Heath Slocum''' (born [[February 3]], [[1974]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional golfer]] and current player on the [[PGA Tour]].

Slocum was born in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. He learned the game of [[golf]] from his dad, a former [[Mississippi]] club pro who participated in the [[Magnolia State Classic]] nine times. Slocum played on the same high school golf team in [[Milton, Florida]] as fellow PGA Tour player [[Boo Weekley]], and later attended the [[University of South Alabama]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. While a student there, he earned many amateur [[golf]] honors including three-time All-American. He turned pro in [[1996]] and joined the PGA Tour in [[2001]].

Slocum began his career on the [[Nationwide Tour]]. He was the second person to earn a promotion to the PGA Tour by winning three Nationwide Tour events in the same season (this is commonly referred to as a "battlefield promotion"). He is only the second player in Nationwide Tour history to complete 72 holes without a bogey. In November [[1997]], Slocum developed [[ulcerative colitis]] which caused his weight to drop from 150 pounds to 122 pounds. He wasn't able to play for a year and one-half.

Slocum has won twice so far on the PGA Tour. His first win was in [[2004]] at the [[Chrysler Classic of Tucson]]. His second win came at the [[Southern Farm Bureau Classic]] in [[2005]]. His best finish in a major has been a 22nd at the [[2002]] [[PGA Championship]] and he has featured in the top 100 of the [[Official World Golf Rankings]]. Slocum represented the United States at the [[2007 OMEGA Mission Hills World Cup]] with [[Boo Weekley]] and finished in 2nd place.
