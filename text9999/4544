'''''Tintin in the Congo''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''Tintin au Congo'''}}) is the second volume of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the comics series by Belgian cartoonist [[Herg<U+00E9>]]. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|''[[Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle]]''}} as [[colonialism|colonialist]] propaganda for its children's supplement {{lang|fr|''[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]''}}, it was [[serial (literature)|serialised]] weekly from May 1930 to June 1931. The story tells of young Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], who are sent to the [[Belgian Congo]] to report on events in the country. Amidst various encounters with the native Congolese and wild animals, Tintin unearths a criminal diamond [[smuggling]] operation run by the American gangster [[Al Capone]].

Following on from ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' and bolstered by publicity stunts, ''Tintin in the Congo'' was a commercial success, appearing in book form shortly after the serial's conclusion. Herg<U+00E9> continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[Tintin in America]]'' in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]]. In 1946, Herg<U+00E9> re-drew and coloured ''Tintin in the Congo'' in his distinctive ''[[Ligne claire|ligne-claire]]'' style for republication by [[Casterman]], with further alterations made for a 1975 edition. In the late 20th century, ''Tintin in the Congo'' came under criticism for its perceived [[racism|racist]] attitude to the Congolese and glorification of big-game hunting, and attempts were made in Belgium and the United Kingdom to restrict its availability to children.

==Synopsis==
Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his fox terrier [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] travel to the [[Belgian Congo]], where a cheering crowd of native Congolese greet them.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2005|pp=1<U+2013>11}} Tintin hires a native boy, Coco, to assist him in his travels, and shortly after Tintin rescues Snowy from a [[crocodile]]. A criminal stowaway attempts to kill Tintin, but monkeys throw coconuts at him that knock him unconscious. A monkey kidnaps Snowy, but Tintin saves him.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2005|pp=11<U+2013>18}}

The next morning, Tintin, Snowy, and Coco crash their car into a train, which the reporter fixes and tows to the village of the Babaorum tribe.  He meets the king, who accompanies him on a hunt the next day. A lion knocks Tintin unconscious, but Snowy rescues him by biting off its tail. Tintin gains the admiration of the natives, making the Babaorum witch-doctor Muganga jealous. With the help of the criminal stowaway, he accuses Tintin of destroying the tribe's sacred idol. The enraged villagers imprison Tintin, but then turn against Muganga when Coco shows them footage Tintin had made of the witch-doctor and the stowaway conspiring to destroy the idol. Tintin becomes a hero in the village, and a local woman bows down to him, saying, "White man very great! Has good spirits&nbsp;... White mister is big [[juju]] man!"{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2005|pp=19<U+2013>28}}

Angered, Muganga starts a war between the Babaorum and their neighbours, the M'Hatuvu, whose king leads an attack on the Babaorum village. Tintin outwits them, and the M'Hatuvu cease hostilities and come to idolise Tintin. Muganga and the stowaway plot to kill Tintin and make it look like a [[leopard]] attack, but Tintin survives and saves Muganga from a [[boa constrictor]]; Muganga pleads mercy and ends his hostilities. The stowaway attempts to capture Tintin again and eventually succeeds disguised as a Catholic missionary. They fight across a waterfall, and the stowaway is eaten by crocodiles.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2005|pp=44}} After reading a letter from the stowaway's pocket, Tintin finds that someone called "A.C." has ordered his elimination. Tintin captures a criminal who tried to rendezvous with the stowaway and learns that "A.C." is the American gangster [[Al Capone]], who is trying to gain control of African diamond production. Tintin and the colonial police arrest the rest of the diamond smuggling gang and Tintin and Snowy return to Belgium.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2005|pp=44<U+2013>52}}

==History==

===Background===
Georges Remi<U+2014>best known under the pen name [[Herg<U+00E9>]]<U+2014>was employed as editor and illustrator of {{lang|fr|''[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]''}} ("''The Little Twentieth''"),{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1pp=31<U+2013>32|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=24<U+2013>25}} a children's supplement to {{lang|fr|''[[Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle]]''}} ("''The 20th Century''"), a staunchly Roman Catholic, [[social conservatism|conservative]] Belgian newspaper based in Herg<U+00E9>'s native [[Brussels]].  Run by the [[Abb<U+00E9>]] [[Norbert Wallez]], the paper described itself as a "Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information" and disseminated a far-right, fascist viewpoint.{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1pp=20<U+2013>32|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=24<U+2013>25|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=38}} According to Tintinologist [[Harry Thompson]], such political ideas were common in Belgium at the time, and Herg<U+00E9>'s milieu was permeated with conservative ideas revolving around "patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline, and naivety".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=24}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="For ''the Congo'' as with ''Tintin in the Land of the Soviets'', the fact was that I was fed on the prejudices of the bourgeois society in which I moved&nbsp;... It was 1930. I only knew things about these countries that people said at the time: 'Africans were great big children&nbsp;... Thank goodness for them that we were there!' Etc. And I portrayed these Africans according to such criteria, in the purely paternalistic spirit which existed then in Belgium."|source=Herg<U+00E9>, talking to [[Numa Sadoul]]{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} }}

In 1929, Herg<U+00E9> began ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic strip for {{lang|fr|''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me''}}, about the exploits of a fictional Belgian reporter named Tintin. Following the success of ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', [[serial (literature)|serialised]] weekly in ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' from January 1929 to May 1930, Herg<U+00E9> wanted to send Tintin to the United States.  However, Wallez insisted he write a story set in the Belgian Congo, then a [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian colony]] and today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=26|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=24|3a=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=45}} Belgian children learned about the Congo in school, and Wallez hoped to encourage colonialist and missionary zeal in his readership.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=26}} He believed that the Belgian colonial administration needed promotion at a time when memories "were still fairly fresh" of the 1928 visit to the colony by the Belgian [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876<U+2013>1965)|Queen Elisabeth]].{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=21}} He also hoped that some of his readers would be inspired to work in the Congo.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=46}}

Herg<U+00E9> characterised Wallez's instructions in a sarcastic manner, saying Wallez referred to the Congo as "our beautiful colony which has great need of us, tarantara, tarantaraboom".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=33}} He already had some experience in illustrating Congolese scenes; three years previously, Herg<U+00E9> had provided two illustrations for the newspaper that appeared in an article celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s expedition to the Congo. In one of these, Herg<U+00E9> depicted a native Congolese bowing before a European, a scene that he repeated in ''Tintin in the Congo''.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=27}}

As in ''Land of the Soviets'', where Herg<U+00E9> had based his information about the Soviet Union almost entirely on a single source, in ''Tintin in the Congo'' he used limited source material to learn about the country and its people. He based the story largely on literature written by missionaries, with the only added element being that of the diamond [[smuggling|smugglers]], possibly adopted from the "''[[Jungle Jim]]''-type serials".{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=25}} Herg<U+00E9> visited the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa|Colonial Museum]] of [[Tervuren]], examining their ethnographic collections of Congolese artefacts, including costumes of the [[Leopard Society|Leopard Men]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=27|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=46}} He adopted hunting scenes from [[Andr<U+00E9> Maurois]]'s novel ''The Silence of Colonel Bramble'', while his animal drawings were inspired by [[Benjamin Rabier]]'s prints.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=27}} He also listened to tales of the colony from some of his colleagues who had been there, but disliked their stories, later claiming: "I didn't like the colonists, who came back bragging about their exploits. But I couldn't prevent myself from seeing the Blacks as big children, either."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=46}}

===Original publication, 1930<U+2013>31===
''Tintin in the Congo'' was serialised under the French title of ''Tintin au Congo'' in ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' from 5 May 1930 to 11 June 1931; it was [[print syndication|syndicated]] to the French Catholic newspaper ''[[C<U+0153>urs Vaillants]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=28|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=24}} Drawn in black and white, it followed the same formula employed in ''Land of the Soviets'', remaining "essentially plotless" according to Tintinologist Michael Farr, and consisting of largely unrelated events that Herg<U+00E9> improvised each week.{{sfn|Farr|2001|pp=21<U+2013>22}} Herg<U+00E9> later commented on the process of writing these early adventures, stating, "The {{lang|fr|''Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me''}} came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning how I was going to get Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=33}} The strip's visual style was similar to that of ''Land of the Soviets''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=26}} In the first instalment of ''Tintin in the Congo'', Herg<U+00E9> featured [[Quick and Flupke]], two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' comic strip, in the crowd of people saying goodbye to Tintin.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=27|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=21}}

Like ''Land of the Soviets'', ''Tintin in the Congo'' was popular in Belgium. On the afternoon of 9 July 1931, Wallez repeated the publicity stunt he had used when ''Soviets'' ended by having a young actor, Henry de Doncker, dress up as Tintin in colonial gear and appear in Brussels and then [[Li<U+00E8>ge]], accompanied by 10 African bearers and an assortment of exotic animals hired from a zoo. Co-organised with the [[Bon March<U+00E9>]] department store, the event attracted 5,000 spectators in Brussels.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=28|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=47|3a1=Thompson|3y=1991|3p=41}} In 1931, Brussels-based <U+00C9>ditions de Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me collected the story together into a single volume, and [[Casterman]] published a second edition in 1937.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=28|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=24}} The series' success led Wallez to renegotiate Herg<U+00E9>'s contract, giving him a higher salary and the right to work from home.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=47}}

===Second version, 1946===
[[File:Opening of Tintin in the Congo.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|The opening frames from the 1931 and 1946 versions of the book. In the crowd of the original are [[Quick and Flupke]]; they are joined by Herg<U+00E9>, E.&nbsp;P. Jacobs, and Thomson and Thompson in the latter.|alt=Two comic book frames; the same basic scene of a young man being seen off at a railway station is depicted, but one image is in black and white while the other is in colour.]]
In the 1940s, after Herg<U+00E9>'s popularity increased, he redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin stories in colour using the ''{{lang|fr|[[ligne claire]]}}'' ("clear line"){{efn|Herg<U+00E9> himself did not use the term ''ligne claire'' to describe his drawing style; the Dutch cartoonist [[Joost Swarte]] first used the term in 1977.{{sfn|Pleban|2006}} }} drawing style he had developed, so that they fitted in visually with the newer ''Adventures of Tintin'' that he had produced. ''Tintin in the Congo'' was re-drawn, and the new version was published in 1946. As a part of this modification, Herg<U+00E9> cut the page length from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and [[colonial rule]]. For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about [[geography]], he states in the 1930<U+2013>31 version that "My dear friends, today I'm going to talk to you about your country: Belgium!" whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a [[mathematics]] lesson.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=25}} Herg<U+00E9> also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white "supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe."{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=25}}

In the 1946 colour version, Herg<U+00E9> added a cameo appearance from [[Thomson and Thompson]], the two detectives that he had introduced in the fourth Tintin story, ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'' (1932<U+2013>34), which was chronologically set after the Congolese adventure. Adding them to the first page, Herg<U+00E9> featured them in the backdrop, watching a crowd surrounding Tintin as he boards a train and commenting that it "Seems to be a young reporter going to Africa..."{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=21}} In the same frame, Herg<U+00E9> inserted depictions of himself and his friend [[Edgar P. Jacobs]] (the book's colourist) into the crowd seeing Tintin off.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=42}}

===Later alterations and releases===
When ''Tintin in the Congo'' was first released by the series' Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live [[rhinoceros]], fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Herg<U+00E9> to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Herg<U+00E9> agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin's gun.{{sfn|Farr|2001|pp=23, 25}}

Although publishers worldwide had made it available for many years, English publishers refused to publish ''Tintin in the Congo'' because of its alleged racist content. In the late 1980s, Nick Rodwell, then agent of [[Studios Herg<U+00E9>]] in the United Kingdom, told reporters of his intention to finally publish it in English and stated his belief that publishing the original 1931 black and white edition would cause less controversy than releasing the 1946 colour version.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=42}} After more delay, in 1991<U+2014>sixty years after its original 1931 publication<U+2014>it was the last of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' to see publication in English.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} The 1946 colour version appeared in English in 2005, published by [[Egmont Publishing|Egmont]].{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2005|loc=inset}}

==Critical analysis==
Herg<U+00E9> biographer [[Pierre Assouline]] believed that Herg<U+00E9>'s drawing became more assured throughout the first version of the story without losing any of its spontaneity.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=27}} He thought that the story began in "the most inoffensive way", and that throughout the story Tintin was portrayed as a [[Scout (Scouting)|Boy Scout]], something he argued reflected Herg<U+00E9>'s "moral debt" to Wallez.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=27}} Biographer [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] opined that ''Tintin in the Congo'' was "nothing spectacular", with some "incredibly cumbersome" monologues, but he thought the illustrations "a bit more polished" than those in ''Land of the Soviets''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=46<U+2013>47}} Believing the plot to be "extremely simple", he thought that Tintin's character was like a child  manipulating a world populated by toy animals and lead figurines.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=47}}
Michael Farr felt that, unlike in the previous Tintin adventure, some sense of a plot emerges at the end of the story with the introduction of the American diamond-smuggling racket.{{sfn|Farr|2001|pp=21<U+2013>22}} [[Philippe Goddin]] thought the work to be "more exciting" than ''Land of the Soviets'' and argued that Herg<U+00E9>'s depiction of the native Congolese was not mocking but a parody of past European militaries.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=75}}
By contrast, Tintinologist [[Harry Thompson]] believed that "''Congo'' is almost a regression from ''Soviets''", in his opinion having no plot or characterisation; he described it as "probably the most childish of all the Tintin books."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=40}} Simon Kuper of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' criticised both ''Land of the Soviets'' and ''Tintin in the Congo'' as the "worst" of the ''Adventures'', opining that they were "poorly drawn" and "largely plot-free".{{sfn|Kuper|2011}}

Farr saw the 1946 colour version as poorer than the black and white original; he said it had lost its "vibrancy" and "atmosphere", and that the new depiction of the Congolese landscape was unconvincing and more like a European zoo than the "parched, dusty expanses of reality".{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} Peeters took a more positive attitude towards the 1946 version, commenting that it contained "aesthetic improvements" and "clarity of composition" because of Herg<U+00E9>'s personal development in draughtsmanship, as well as an enhancement in the dialogue, which had become "more lively and fluid."{{sfn|Peeters|1989|pp=30<U+2013>31}}

In his [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] study of the series, Tintinologist [[Jean-Marie Apostolid<U+00E8>s]] highlighted that in the Congolese adventure, Tintin represented progress and the Belgian state as a model for the natives to imitate. In doing so, he argued, they could become more European and thus civilised from the perspective of Belgian society, but that instead they ended up appearing as parodies.{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|pp=12<U+2013>15}}  Opining that Tintin was imposing his own view of Africa onto the Congolese, Apostolid<U+00E8>s remarked that Tintin appeared as a god-figure, with evangelical overtones in the final scene.{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|pp=15<U+2013>16}} Literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (writer)|Tom McCarthy]] concurred that Tintin represented the Belgian state, but also suggested that he acted as a Christian missionary, even being "a kind of god" akin to the character of [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]] in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899).{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=51}} McCarthy compared the scene where Tintin exposes Muganga as a fraud to that in which the character of [[Prospero]] exposes the magician in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=51}}

==Criticism==

===Racism===
[[File:Angry King in Tintin.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A comics strip panel.  A heavily-caricatured African king jumps in the air angrily, saying, "Curses! ... Our artillery done for! ... By my ancestors, me myself kill miserable white man!" |The King of the M'Hatuvu angry at his failure in battle against Tintin, from the 1946 version of the book; such depictions have widely been labelled racist.]]
In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several campaigners and writers characterised ''Tintin in the Congo'' as [[racism|racist]] due to its portrayal of the Congolese as infantile and stupid.{{sfn|Cendrowicz|2010}} According to Tom McCarthy, Herg<U+00E9> depicted the Congolese as "good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery."{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=37}} There had been no such controversy when originally published,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=28}} because it was only following the [[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]] and [[decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]], which occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, that Western attitudes towards indigenous Africans shifted.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} Tintinologist Harry Thompson argued that one must view ''Tintin in the Congo'' in the context of European society in the 1930s and 1940s, and that Herg<U+00E9> had not written the book to be "deliberately racist". He argued that it reflected the average Belgian view of Congolese people at the time, one that was more "patronising" than malevolent.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=40}} Tintinologist Jean-Marie Apostolid<U+00E8>s supported this idea,{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=14}} as did biographer Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters, who asserted, "Herg<U+00E9> was no more racist than the next man."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=46}} After meeting Herg<U+00E9> in the 1980s, Farr commented, "You couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist."{{sfn|Smith|2010}}

Contrastingly, biographer Pierre Assouline stated that in 1930s Belgium, Herg<U+00E9> would have had access to literature by the likes of [[Andr<U+00E9> Gide]] and [[Albert Londres]] that was critical of the colonial regime. Assouline claimed that Herg<U+00E9> instead chose not to read such reports because they conflicted with the views of his conservative milieu.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=29<U+2013>30}} Laurence Grove<U+2014>President of the International Bande Dessinee Society and an academic at the [[University of Glasgow]]<U+2014>concurred, remarking that Herg<U+00E9> adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that "[w]hen it was fashionable to be a colonial racist, that's what he was."{{sfn|Smith|2010}}

Farr and McCarthy stated that ''Tintin in the Congo'' was the most popular Tintin adventure in Francophone Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=27|2a1=McCarthy|2y=2006|2p=37}} According to Thompson, the book remained hugely popular in the Congo even after the country achieved independence in 1960.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=41<U+2013>42}} Nevertheless, government figures in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC) have criticised the book. In 2004, after the Belgian [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Belgium)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Karel De Gucht]] described President [[Joseph Kabila]]'s provisional DRC government as incompetent, Congolese Information Minister Henri Mova Sakanyi accused him of "racism and nostalgia for colonialism", remarking that it was like "''Tintin in the Congo'' all over again." De Gucht refused to retract his statement.{{sfnm|1a1=Cendrowicz|1y=2010|2a1=BBC News staff|2y=2004}}

[[File:Humanzoogermany.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A poster depicting two black African faces.|''Tintin in the Congo'' fitted widely held stereotypes about black Africans found in early 20th century Europe. This is a poster for a [[human zoo]] in [[Stuttgart]] in 1928.]]
In July 2007, British human rights lawyer David Enright complained to the United Kingdom's [[Commission for Racial Equality]] (CRE) that he came across the book in the children's section of [[Borders Group|Borders]] bookshop while shopping with his wife and two sons. The CRE called on bookshops to remove the comic, stating that it contained "hideous racial prejudice" by depicting Congolese who "look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles." Responding that it was committed to letting its "customers make the choice", Borders moved the book to an area reserved for adult graphic novels. Another British retailer, [[W H Smith]], said that the book was sold on its website but with a label that recommended it for readers aged 16 and over.{{sfnm|1a1=BBC News staff|1y=2007|2a1=Fernandez|2y=2007|3a1=Beckford|3y=2007|4a1=Anon|4y=2007|4p=14}} The CRE's attempt to ban the book was criticised by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician [[Ann Widdecombe]], who remarked that the organisation had more important things to do than regulate the availability of historical children's books.{{sfn|Beckford|2007}} The media controversy increased interest in the book, and Borders reported that its sales of ''Tintin in the Congo'' had been boosted 4,000%, while it also rose to eighth on the [[Amazon.com]] bestseller list.{{sfn|Anon|2007|p=14}} In November 2011, UK bookseller [[Waterstones|Waterstone's]] removed the book from its children's section lest it "fall into the wrong hands".{{sfn|Bunyan|2011}} Publisher Egmont UK also responded to racism concerns by placing a protective band around the book with a warning about its content and writing an introduction describing its historical context.{{sfn|Bunyan|2011}} ''Tintin in the Congo'' also came under criticism in the United States; in October 2007, in response to a complaint by a patron, the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] in [[New York City]] placed the graphic novel in a locked back room, only permitting access by appointment.{{sfn|Leigh Cowan|2009}}

In August 2007, Congolese student Bienvenu Mbutu Mondondo filed a complaint in [[Brussels]], claiming that the book was an insult to the Congolese people and required banning. Public prosecutors investigated and initiated a criminal case. The matter was eventually transferred to a civil court in April 2010.{{sfnm|1a1=Samuel|1y=2011|2a1=BBC News staff|2y=2012}} Mondondo's lawyers argued that ''Tintin in the Congo'' amounted to "a justification of colonisation and of white supremacy", and Mondondo called it "racist and xenophobic".{{sfnm|1a1=Samuel|1y=2011|2a1=BBC News staff|2y=2012}} Alain Berenboom, lawyer for both [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation|Moulinsart]], the company which controls Herg<U+00E9>'s estate, and Casterman, the book's publisher, argued that the cartoonist's depiction of the Congolese "wasn't racism but kind paternalism". He said that banning it would set a dangerous precedent for the availability of works by other historical authors, such as [[Charles Dickens]] or [[Jules Verne]], which contain similar stereotypes of non-white ethnicities.{{sfnm|1a1=Samuel|1y=2011|2a1=BBC News staff|2y=2012}} The court ruled in February 2012 that the book would not be banned, deciding that it was "clear that neither the story, nor the fact that it has been put on sale, has a goal to&nbsp;... create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, or humiliating environment", and that it therefore did not break Belgian law.{{sfnm|1a1=Samuel|1y=2011|2a1=BBC News staff|2y=2012}} Belgium's Centre for Equal Opportunities warned against "over-reaction and hyper [[political correctness]]".{{sfn|Vrielink|2012}}

The South African comic writer [[Anton Kannemeyer]] has parodied the perceived racist nature of the book to highlight what he perceives as the continuing racist undertones of South African society. In his ''Pappa in Afrika'' (2010), a satire of ''Tintin in the Congo'', he portrays Tintin as an Afrikaner with racist views of indigenous Africans.{{sfnm|1a1=Mail & Guardian staff|1y=2010|2a1=Heller|2y=2011}}

=== Hunting and animal cruelty ===
''Tintin in the Congo'' shows Tintin taking part in what Michael Farr described as "the wholesale and gratuitous slaughter" of animals; over the course of the ''Adventure'', Tintin shoots several [[antelope]], kills an ape to wear its skin, rams a rifle vertically into a crocodile's open mouth, injures an elephant for ivory, stones a buffalo, and (in earlier editions) drills a hole into a rhinoceros before planting dynamite in its body, blowing it up from the inside.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} Such scenes reflect the popularity of big-game hunting among whites and affluent visitors in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1930s.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} Herg<U+00E9> later felt guilty about his portrayal of animals in ''Tintin in the Congo'' and became an opponent of [[blood sports]]; when he wrote ''Cigars of the Pharaoh'' (1934), he had Tintin befriend a herd of elephants living in the Indian jungle.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=41}}

Tintinologist Philippe Goddin stated that the scene in which Tintin shoots a herd of antelope was "enough to upset even the least ecological reader" in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=70}} When [[India Book House]] first published the book in India in 2006, that nation's branch of the [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] issued a public criticism, and chief functionary Anuradha Sawhney stated that the book was "replete with instances that send a message to young minds that it is acceptable to be cruel to animals."{{sfn|Chopra|2006}}
