'''''Eucalyptus tereticornis''''' is a species of tree native to eastern [[Australia]].

It has a great many common names, of which '''Forest Red Gum''' is perhaps the most widely known. Other common names include '''Bastard Box''', '''Blue Gum''', '''Flooded Gum''', '''Grey Gum''', '''Mountain Gum''', '''Queensland Blue Gum''', '''Red Gum''', '''Red Ironbark''', '''Red Irongum''' and '''Slaty Gum'''.<ref name="APCND">{{cite web | title = Australian Plant Common Name Database | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/common.names/ | accessdate = 2007-07-15 | publisher = [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]]}}</ref>

==Description==
It grows to a height of from 20 to 50 metres, and a girth of up to 2 metres [[diameter at breast height|dbh]]. The trunk is straight,  and is usually unbranched for more than half of the total height of the tree. Thereafter, limbs are unusually steeply inclined for a ''Eucalyptus'' species. The bark is shed in irregular sheets, resulting in a smooth trunk surface coloured in patches of white, grey and blue, corresponding to areas that shed their bark at different times.<ref name="Boland 1984">{{cite book | author = Boland, D. J. ''et al'' | year = 1984 | title = Forest Trees of Australia | edition = 4th Edition | isbn = 0-643-05423-5}}</ref>

It has narrow, [[lanceolate]] green leaves, from 10 to 20 centimetres long, and one to nearly three centimetres wide. Flowers occur in [[inflorescence]]s of seven to 11 flowers.<ref name="Boland 1984"/>

==Taxonomy==
Specimens of ''E.&nbsp;tereticornis'' were first collected by [[First Fleet]] surgeon and naturalist [[John White (surgeon)|John White]] from [[Port Jackson]] in 1793, and published later that year by [[James Edward Smith]] in ''[[Zoology and Botany of New Holland]]''.<ref name="Boland 1984"/> It was later republished by Smith in his 1795 edition of ''[[A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland]]''.<ref name="Smith 1793">{{cite book | first = James Edward | last = Smith | authorlink = James Edward Smith | year = 1793 | title = [[A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland]] | location = London | publisher = [[James Sowerby]]}}</ref> Smith gave it the specific epithet ''tereticornis'' from the [[Latin]] ''teretus'' ("terete", meaning circular in transverse cross-section) and ''cornu'' ("horn"), in reference to the horn-shaped bud cap.<ref name="Boland 1985">{{cite book | author = Boland, D.

''mediana'']] and the [[autonym]] [[Eucalyptus tereticornis subsp. tereticornis|''E.&nbsp;tereticornis'' subsp. ''tereticornis'']]. Some hybrids have been reported.<ref name="APNI"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
This species has a wide distribution, occurring over the widest range of [[latitude]]s of any ''Eucalyptus'' species: from southern [[Papua New Guinea]] at latitude 15<U+00B0>S, to southeastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] at latitude 38<U+00B0>C.<ref name="Boland 1985"/>

==Uses==
''E.&nbsp;tereticornis'' has a strong, hard and durable heartwood, with a density of about 1100 kg m<sup>-3</sup>. It is used for construction in heavy engineering, such as for railway sleepers.<ref name="Boland 1984"/>
