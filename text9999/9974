'''Ian AR Stewart''' ([[18 July]], [[1938]] <U+2013> [[12 December]], [[1985]]) was a Scottish [[rock music|rock musician]].

Stewart played [[piano]] in the original line-up of [[The Rolling Stones]]. He predates both [[Bill Wyman]] and [[Charlie Watts]] as members of the band. Because the band's manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] did not think Stewart's looks were good enough for publicity purposes, Stewart officially "left the group" but continued until his death as their road manager and pianist. Whereas other of the band's members, chiefly [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Brian Jones]], were known for their flashy apparel, for over thirty years the pianist kept the same style of shabby jeans and a highly unfashionable haircut. His presence added a down-to-earth depth of reality to the decadent rock and roll madness that the band purveyed. Because of his ambiguous role within the group, he is often referred to as "the Sixth Stone".

==Biography==
=== Role in the band (1962-1985) ===
Born in [[Pittenweem]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], Stewart, or "Stu", played keyboards on most of the Stones' essential albums from the [[1960s]] until the [[1980s]], though his work was often supplemented by such guests as session pianist [[Nicky Hopkins]], soul musician [[Billy Preston]], [[Phil Spector]] and [[Neil Young]] associate [[Jack Nitzsche]] and [[Ian McLagan]] of [[The Faces]]. As the Stones' career progressed and their keyboardist stable increased, Stewart became far more selective of the material he contributed to, favoring blues and country rockers in major keys. Some of Stewart's most evocative work at the piano from the group's fabled 1968&ndash;1972 peak is featured in the songs "Let It Bleed", "Dead Flowers", "Sweet Virginia", and the covers of Chuck Berry's "Carol" and "Little Queenie" from the live ''[[Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert|Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!]]''. 

Stu's most enduring moment in Stones history occurred in 1969, when the band was recording at Muscle Shoals Studios in Alabama on a tour break shortly before the Altamont disaster. Characteristically, Stewart refused to play on the ballad "Wild Horses" because he objected to the lilting minor key of the song. It was this staunch dedication to roots music forms, namely [[Boogie-woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] jazz and early rhythm and blues (jump blues) that earned the pianist so much respect among his former bandmates. To quote [[Mick Jagger]] shortly after Stewart's untimely death, "I'm going to miss him a lot. He really helped this band swing on 'Honky-Tonk Women' and loads of others. Stu was the one guy we tried to please. We wanted his approval when we were writing or rehearsing a song. We'd want him to like it."

He often berated [[Brian Jones]] for his destructive behavior and was believed to be instrumental in having the guitarist removed from the band and replaced by [[Mick Taylor]], who coincidentally was a prominent figure in the traditional blues and jazz circles Stewart frequented, having previously played with the legendary [[John Mayall]]. Stewart and Jones had been the musical leaders in the first incarnation of the Stones but distinct stylistic differences &mdash; the former's love of the jazzier [[boogie-woogie]] R&B of the Forties, the latter's penchant for the electric blues of the Fifties &mdash; nearly led to the group breaking apart. It wasn't until the addition of Jagger and Richards, who came from a more [[soul music|soul]]/[[rock and roll]] background, that a compromise was reached.

He took the news of his ejection without fuss or bother. He agreed to stay on, loading the gear into the battered pink VW bus and driving from Lowestoft to Aberystwyth in a day, for instance, or setting off for Germany with a broken starter motor before replacing frayed guitar strings or doggedly setting up Charlie<U+2019>s drums the way he himself would play them. "I never ever swore at him," Watts says, with rueful amazement. In the later chapters in the band history, Stu was happy to be in the band's background and according to Jagger and Richards, he didn't want to join at all, although he had been requested numerous times.

Later on, as [[Keith Richards]] and many of the band's associates became drug addicts in the early Seventies, Stewart withdrew from the band's musical affairs to a large extent, preferring to tend to his administrative duties. "I think he looked upon it as a load of silliness," Mick Taylor, who replaced Jones as the group<U+2019>s lead guitarist, said. "I also think it was because he saw what had happened to Brian. I could tell from the expression on his face when things started to get a bit crazy during the making of Exile on Main Street. I think he found it very hard. We all did." For example, he only plays on three tracks on the epochal double album ''[[Exile On Main Street]]'': the blues covers "Shake Your Hips" and "Stop Breaking Down" and "Sweet Virginia". (Interestingly, "Good Time Woman" was a Stewart showcase, though by the time the song transformed into the hit single "[[Tumbling Dice]]" [[Nicky Hopkins]] was manning the piano bench). 

Stewart accompanied the band on all of their tours until 1982, working in various capacities. In the early days, he served as road manager and ferried the Stones and their instruments in his van. By the late 1960s, he had become the "corporate secretary" of the band's organization, managing their rehearsal hall and mobile recording truck (both often rented out to contemporaries including [[The Faces]] and [[Bob Marley]]) and serving as advance man when the band was on the road. An avid golfer in his spare time, Stewart was notorious for booking the group into desolate hotels near the best country clubs. Thus, despite their bad boy aura, the Stones never acquired the hotel-wrecking bacchanalian infamy of [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[The Who]]. With the exception of their [[The Rolling Stones UK Tour 1971|1971 English Tour]] and the [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American Tour]] (in which Nicky Hopkins alone played keyboards), Stewart always sat in on piano with the group, though usually only playing on the numbers he enjoyed or had already recorded with the Stones.

By and large, Stewart's best recorded contributions are with the [[Rolling Stones]], however he did play many other sessions. He contributed to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]" from the group's [[Led Zeppelin IV|1971 release]] and "[[Boogie With Stu]]" from the 1975 ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'', two numbers in the traditional rock and roll vein, both featured Stu's intensely rhythmic [[Boogie-woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] style; another notable non-Stones release for Stewart was [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s 1971 ''[[London Sessions]]'' album, an all-star recording featuring [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]], Beatles hanger-on/Plastic Ono Band bassist [[Klaus Voorman]], B-3 organ player [[Steve Winwood]], and Stones bandmates Wyman and Watts in addition to Stewart. 

There was also the commercially obscure back-to-the-roots fun band [[Rocket 88 (band)|Rocket 88]], a late-seventies early-eighties venture which included [[Charlie Watts]], [[Alexis Korner]] (the founding father of the British blues/trad jazz scene in the early sixties), [[Cream (band)|Cream]] frontman [[Jack Bruce]] on stand-up acoustic bass, and Stu  and Bob Hall on piano, as well as a horn and brass section taken from a pool of what he called "British Jazz Legends", which included Colin Smith, John Picard, [[Dick Morrissey]] and Don Weller, among others. Though they only released one album, recorded live in Germany, with Rocket 88 Stewart was finally able to play the [[boogie-woogie]] music that he so loved and championed.

===Death and posthumous recognition (1985-present) ===
Though Stewart's last contributions to a Rolling Stones-album were included on 1983's ''[[Undercover (album)|Undercover]]'', he was still present during the problematic sessions for 1986's ''[[Dirty Work (album)|Dirty Work]]''. In early December 1985, Stewart began having respiratory problems. On December 12th, he went to a clinic to have the problem examined; however, he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died while in the waiting room.<ref>http://www.beggarsbanquetonline.com/decades.htm Accessed: 6 February 2007</ref> He was to meet with Keith Richards after the visit to discuss the plan behind the projected album that turned into ''Dirty Work''. 

The Stones paid tribute to their loyal road manager and piano player by playing a tribute gig for him with Rocket 88 in February 1986, and by including a 30-second boogie-woogie piano solo played by Ian Stewart on the fadeout of the ''Dirty Work'' album.

==Basis for fictional detective Rebus==
According to a [[Sunday Herald]] [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20060305/ai_n16180326 article] in March 2006, Ian Stewart was taken as the basis for a famous fictional detective:
{{cquote|but Scottish crime writer Ian Rankin has revealed that John Rebus, the star of 15 novels set in the grimy underbelly of the nation's capital, may have more to do with the Rolling Stones than any detective could have surmised. The award-winning novelist admits during a new Radio 4 series exploring the relationships between crime writers and their favourite music that he took some of his inspiration for the unruly inspector from the "sixth Stone", Ian Stewart.}}
