"'''Mothers of the Disappeared'''" is a song by [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. It is the eleventh and final track on their 1987 album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''. The song was inspired by lead singer [[Bono]]'s experiences in Nicaragua and El Salvador in July 1986, following U2's involvement on Amnesty International's [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour. He learned of the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo|Madres de Plaza de Mayo]], a group of women whose children had been [[forced disappearance|"disappeared"]] by the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentinean]] and [[Military government of Chile (1973<U+2013>1990)|Chilean dictatorships]].<ref name="McGee98" /> While in Central America, he met members of [[COMADRES]], a similar organization whose children had been disappeared by the government in El Salvador.<ref name="John185" /> Bono sympathized with the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to their cause.

The song was written on a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]], and the melody lifted from a piece Bono composed in Ethiopia in 1985 to help teach children basic forms of hygiene. The lyrics contain an implicit criticism of the Reagan Administration, which backed two South American regimes that seized power during coup d'<U+00E9>tats and which provided financial support for the military regime in El Salvador.<ref name="John192" /> Thematically it has been interpreted as an examination of failures and contradictions in [[Foreign policy of the United States|US foreign policy]].<ref name="Garrett" /><ref name="Hand" />

"Mothers of the Disappeared" was played seven times on the 1987 [[Joshua Tree Tour]], and some recordings were considered for the ending sequence of the 1988 film ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''. It was revived for four concerts on the 1998 [[PopMart Tour]] in South America, and the Madres joined the band onstage for the performance on two of those occasions, one of which was broadcast on television in Chile. Bono used the opportunity to ask General Pinochet to reveal to the Madres the locations of their children's bodies. The song was played a further three times on the [[U2 360<U+00B0> Tour]]; one performance was dedicated to Fehmi Tosun, an ethnic Kurd who was forcibly disappeared in Turkey in 1995. The track was favourably received by critics, who variously described it as "powerful",<ref name="Morse" /> "a moving tribute",<ref name="Dallas" /> and containing "stunning beauty and sadness".<ref name="Thrills" /> Bono re-recorded the song [[a cappella]] in 1998 for the album ''<U+00A1>Ni Un Paso Atras!''.

==Inspiration, writing, and recording==
Recording sessions for ''The Joshua Tree'' began in January 1986 in [[Danesmoate House]] in Dublin, Ireland, and continued throughout the year.<ref name="McGee93" /> U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join [[Amnesty International]]'s [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer [[Bono]] met Ren<U+00E9> Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]-led [[Military government of Chile (1973<U+2013>1990)|regime]] that seized power in 1973 during a [[1973 Chilean coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup d'<U+00E9>tat]].<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 76</ref> Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]] that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina.<ref name="Film" /> He also learned of the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo|Madres de Plaza de Mayo]], a group of women whose children were [[forced disappearances|forcibly disappeared]] by the Argentinian government.<ref name="McGee98">McGee (2008), p. 98</ref> The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the [[Dirty War]], and the coup d'<U+00E9>tat that brought [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] into power.<ref name="Graham">Graham (2004), p. 35</ref> The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.<ref>Stokes (2005), p. 77</ref><ref name="U2byU2" />

Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, travelling to [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] with his wife, [[Ali Hewson|Alison Hewson]], to see firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention. While there, they worked with the Central American Mission Partners (CAMP), a human rights and economic development organization.<ref>Luerssen (2010), pp. 183<U+2013>184</ref> In El Salvador they met members of the Comit<U+00E9> de Madres Monsignor Romero ([[COMADRES]]: Committee of the Mothers Monsignor Romero), an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the El Salvadoran government during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] because they opposed the military regime that was in power.<ref name="John185">Luerssen (2010), p. 185</ref><ref name="John192">Luerssen (2010), pp. 192<U+2013>193</ref> At one point during the trip, Bono, Alison, and a member of CAMP were shot at by government troops while on their way to deliver aid to a group of farmers. The shots were a warning and, according to author John Luerssen, the incident made Bono realize that "they didn't care for their intrusion and they could kill them if they felt compelled."<ref name="John185" />

In 2006, Bono recounted another experience he had in El Salvador, where he had seen a body thrown from a van into the road. He remarked, "People would just disappear. If you were part of the opposition, you might find an SUV with the windows blacked out parked outside your house.... If that didn't stop you, occasionally they would come in and take you and murder you; there would be no trial."<ref name="U2byU2">McCormick (2006), p. 184</ref><ref>Assayas (2005), p. 182</ref> Bono understood the cause of the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to it.<ref name="U2byU2" /> His experiences in Central America inspired the lyrics of "Mothers of the Disappeared" and another track from ''The Joshua Tree'', "[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]".<ref name="westwon">{{cite journal |title=How the West Was Won |magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |date=8 September 2003}}</ref><ref>Cogan (2008), p. 125</ref>

All of them face right.|John Tower (left), Ronald Reagan (centre), and Edmund Muskie (right); the Reagan Administration's backing of the regimes in Central and South America was a thematic influence on the song.]]

In December 1986, Bono stated that he had a love<U+2013>hate relationship with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, "There's no question in my mind of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]]'s involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make."<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Enduring Chill: Bono and the Two Americas |date=December 1986 |journal=Propaganda |issue=4}}</ref> In 2007, Clayton noted "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under [[Margaret Thatcher]] who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as [[The Clash]] but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America."<ref>{{cite news |title=It's a miracle of a record... much better than the band who made it at the time <U+2013> Bono |first=Simon |last=Cosyns |newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |page=74 |date=30 November 2007}}</ref> He said "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government",<ref name="album notes2007" /> and described Bono's vocals as "prehistoric", saying "it connects with something very primitive."<ref name="U2byU2" />

Greg Garrett, an English professor at [[Baylor University]], saw the song as an effort to "[respond] to growing interests in doing justice<U+2014>and calling to attention American failures in that regard", noting that the regimes in South America had been supported by the United States because of their anti-communist positions, even though their tactics were in opposition to the democratic values that "America claims to champion around the world".<ref name="Garrett">Garrett (2009), p. 97</ref> Lisa Hand of the ''[[Sunday Independent]]'' noted the influence of America on the track, remarking, "[it] does not confine itself simply to the music, but also extends to some of the lyrics. However, far from being a tribute to the star-spangled banner, the words highlight the political untruths and ambiguities which exist within the U.S. 'Mothers of the Disappeared' and 'Bullet the Blue Sky' both take a hard look at the American involvement in South America".<ref name="Hand">{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Hand |newspaper=[[Sunday Independent]] |title='Joshua Tree' Blooms |date=8 March 1987}}</ref> Richard Harrington of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the song as "a simple lament of great beauty and sadness pleading for the realization that ideological battles about right and left obscure the more important issue of right and wrong."<ref name="WP" /> Author David Kootnikoff described it as a "[portrait] of the American Dream gone rancid".<ref>Kootnikoff (2010), p. 63</ref>

==Live performances==
U2 debuted "Mothers of the Disappeared" on 14 April 1987 in San Diego, California, on the first leg of the [[Joshua Tree Tour]], where it closed the concert in place of the band's long-time finale "[[40 (song)|40]]".<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 97</ref> It was performed three more times on the leg; twice to open the encore and once to conclude the main set.<ref>de la Parra (2003), pp. 99<U+2013>100, 102</ref> U2 revived the song seven months later on the third leg, playing it in the encore at three of the final four concerts on the tour.<ref name="Film">de la Parra (2003), pp. 119<U+2013>121</ref>

The final two performances, in Tempe, Arizona, on 19 and 20 December 1987, were filmed for the 1988 film ''[[Rattle and Hum#Film|Rattle and Hum]]''.<ref name="Film" /> U2 sang the refrain "el pueblo vencer<U+00E1>", which means "a people united will overcome" in Spanish, at the conclusion of the song. Bono noted that the Madres use the phrase for motivation. The Edge said "we're so close to a Spanish speaking part of the world, we felt that maybe people at the concert might pick up on this lyric."<ref name="Film" /> Bono added that they had closed every concert since 1983 with the song "40", and so they were looking to replace it with "Mothers of the Disappeared" from that point on. He explained, "If the people of Arizona sing this, and if it goes into the film and onto the record, wherever we go in a way for the next few years, that will be taken up again. It'll be an interesting experiment...".<ref name="Film" /> The footage was considered for the closing sequence of the film, but the band eventually decided against including it.<ref name="Film" /> "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" was used as the final live song, and "[[All I Want Is You (song)|All I Want Is You]]" was chosen to play over the credits.<ref>{{cite video |people=U2, [[Phil Joanou]] (Director) |title=[[Rattle and Hum]] |medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |date=27 October 1988}}</ref>

Following the seven performances on the Joshua Tree Tour, U2 did not perform "Mothers of the Disappeared" until 1998, on the fourth leg of the [[PopMart Tour]]. It was played at three concerts in Argentina and once in Chile, concluding all four shows. Bono sang "el pueblo vencer<U+00E1>" at the end of each performance.<ref name="PopMart" /> The first rendition was on 5 February 1998 in Buenos Aires, where it was performed with the Madres accompanying them on stage.<ref name="PopMart">de la Parra (2003), pp. 218<U+2013>219</ref> The song was played by just Bono and The Edge and was set against footage of the Madres on the video screen. At the conclusion of the song, the band members faced the Madres and applauded, an act in which the rest of the audience joined. Part of the performance was later included on the television documentary ''Classic Albums: The Joshua Tree''.<ref name="ClassicAlbum" />

The cost of the tickets was too high for many fans in South America, so the band broadcast the 11 February concert in Chile live on television.<ref name="ChilePOP">McCormick (2006), p. 282</ref> Knowing that many people in the country would be watching, they played "Mothers of the Disappeared" in place of "Wake Up Dead Man".<ref name="PopMart" /><ref name="ChilePOP" /> The stadium in which the concert was held had been used as a prison camp by Pinochet's regime following the coup d'<U+00E9>tat.<ref name="Global">{{cite web |title=U2: Local Act, Global Horizon (Part II) |first=Justin |last=Kavanagh |work=[[The Globalist]] |date=12 September 2009 |url=http://www.theglobalist.com/storyid.aspx?StoryId=7994 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> Again it was performed solely by Bono and The Edge against footage of the Madres, and they invited the women to join them on stage a second time.

Bono made a plea to Pinochet, asking him to "tell these women where are the bones of their children."<ref name="ChilePOP" /><ref name="Global" />

Reflecting on the applause given to the Madres during the PopMart concert in Buenos Aires, the U2 magazine ''Propaganda'' called the result "about the most moving thing I've ever seen on a rock stage. It was one of those ideas that really could have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment."<ref>{{cite journal |title='Click.' Inside PopMart. 'Click.'|date=July 1998 |journal=Propaganda |issue=28/29}}</ref> Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv&nbsp;... anywhere music meant more than entertainment".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The World Put Its Arms Around Us |author=Bono |magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date=February 1999|issue=149}}</ref> He added "to be able to address General Pinochet from the stage on live television in Chile and say give the dead back to the living. Please, General Pinochet, tell these women where the bones of their sons and daughters are. That was an extraordinary moment&nbsp;... certainly in my life and U2's."<ref name="Andora">{{cite video |title=Exclusive interview with Bono |people=[[Bono]]; Adora Mills |publisher=[[WWWQ-HD2|99X Atlanta]] |medium=Radio broadcast |date=8 May 1998}}</ref> When asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band Bono said it had not, stating "it's proof to me that a rock 'n' roll audience are not lemmings.... If they don't agree with you, they will let you know <U+2014> but that doesn't mean they're not fans.... I was flattered that we weren't just playing to people who agreed with us."<ref name="ChilePOP" /> U2's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the Chilean Parliament against Pinochet, who was in the process of becoming a [[Senator for life]] after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces. The opposition party brought in the Madres, who again held pictures of their disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies.<ref name="ChilePOP" /><ref name="Andora" />
