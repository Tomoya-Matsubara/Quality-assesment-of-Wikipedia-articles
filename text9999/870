The '''Rhodes Scholarship''' named after [[Cecil Rhodes]] is an international award for study at the [[University of Oxford]] and was the first large-scale programme of international [[scholarship]]s.<ref>The American Rhodes Scholarships: A Review of the First Forty Years, Review author[s]: Harvie Branscomb, The American Historical Review <U+00A9> 1947 American Historical Association</ref> Rhodes Scholars may study any full-time postgraduate course offered by the University<ref>Periodically the Rhodes Trustees include or exclude the MBA from the courses offered.</ref> <U+2013> whether a taught Master<U+2019>s programme, a research degree, or a second undergraduate degree (senior status). 

The Scholarship is for two years in the first instance, though may be held for one year only; applications for a third year are considered during the course of the 2nd year.

University and College fees are paid by the Rhodes Trust. In addition, Scholars receive a monthly maintenance stipend to cover accommodation and living expenses.  Although all scholars become affiliated with a [[residential college]] while at Oxford, they also enjoy access to [[Rhodes House]], an early 20th century mansion with numerous public rooms, gardens, a library, study areas, and other facilities.

The scholarships are administered and awarded by the [[Rhodes Trust]] which was established in 1902 under the terms and conditions of the will of [[Cecil John Rhodes]], and funded by his estate. Scholarships have been awarded to applicants annually since 1904 on the basis of academic achievement and strength of character. There have been more than 7,000 Rhodes Scholars since the inception of the Trust. More than 4,000 are still living.<ref name=BriefHistory>[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/history.htm Brief history of the Rhodes Trust]</ref> In 1925, the [[Commonwealth fund fellowship|Commonwealth Fund Fellowships]] (later renamed the [[Harkness Fellowship]]s) were established to reciprocate the Rhodes Scholarships by enabling British graduates to study in the United States.<ref name=History of the Harkness Fellowships>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms9258 History of the Harkness Fellowships]</ref>

== Standards ==

Rhodes' legacy specified four standards by which applicants were to be judged:
* literary and scholastic attainments;
* energy to use one's talents to the full, as exemplified by fondness for and success in sports;
* truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship;
* moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one's fellow beings.

This legacy originally provided for scholarships for the [[British Empire|British colonies]], the [[United States]], and [[Germany]].  These three were chosen so that "an understanding between the three [[great power]]s will render war impossible."

Rhodes, who attended Oxford University, chose his ''alma mater'' as the site of his great experiment because he believed its [[residential college]]s provided the ideal environment for intellectual contemplation and personal development.

== Rhodes' original aim with the Scholarship, and subsequent changes ==

There has been some controversy over the [[Cecil Rhodes#Rhodes' will and the Rhodes Scholarship|original aim of the scholarships]], as it is clear from Rhodes' writings that he held views, which at that time had some currency, about the superiority of the [[Anglo]] race,{{Fact|date=November 2008}} and it has been postulated{{by whom}} that his intention was to use the scholarships to educate future foreign leaders in [[UK|Britain]] so that they could help spread British influence when they returned to their home countries.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

The Secretary of the Rhodes Trust 1925-1939 was [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian]] who was a progressive imperialist, and an ex-member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]].''[relevance?]'' 

An early change was the elimination of the scholarships for [[Germany]] during World Wars [[World War I|I]] and [[World War II|II]].  No German scholars were chosen from 1914 to 1932,<ref>[[Adam von Trott zu Solz]] was Germany's Rhodes Scholar in 1931. He was executed by the Nazis in 1944.</ref> nor from 1939 to 1970. Also, between the wars, for political and propaganda reasons [[Erich Vermehren]] was prevented by the German government from taking up a Rhodes Scholarship.

Rhodes' bequest was whittled down considerably in the first decades after his death, as various scholarship trustees were forced to pay taxes upon their own deaths.  A change occurred in 1929, when an [[Act of Parliament]] established a fund separate from the original proceeds of Rhodes's will.   This made it possible to expand the number of scholarships.  For example, between 1993 and 1995, scholarships were extended to other countries in the [[European Community]].

Because the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]] in the United Kingdom did not affect wills, it took another Act of Parliament to change the Rhodes' will to extend selection criteria in 1977 to include women.  

For at least its first 75 years, scholars usually studied for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.  While that remains an option, more recent scholars usually study for an [[Degrees of Oxford University|advanced degree]].

== Allocations ==

There were originally 52 scholarships. During the ensuing 100 years, the Trustees added at one time or another approximately another 40 scholarships, though not all have continued. Some of these extended the scheme to Commonwealth countries not mentioned in the Will.<ref name=BriefHistory/> A more detailed allocation by region by year can be found at [[Rhodes Scholarship Allocations]]. Very brief summaries of some of the terms and conditions can be found on the Trust's web site.<ref>[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/faq.htm Rhodes Scholarship FAQ]</ref><ref>[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/infoscholar.htm Information about the Scholarships]</ref> Complete details can be obtained from the nominating countries.<ref>[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/countries_complete.htm Country Websites and Information]</ref>

Currently, scholars are selected from citizens of 14 specified geographic constituencies,<ref>[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/countrysites.htm Rhodes Scholarship constituencies]</ref><ref>[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/infoscholar.htm Countries from which Rhodes Scholars are selected]</ref> namely: Australia; Bermuda; Canada; Germany; Hong Kong; India; Jamaica & Commonwealth Caribbean; Kenya; New Zealand; Pakistan; Southern Africa (South Africa and neighbours Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia and Swaziland); USA; Zambia; and Zimbabwe.

From 2006, 11 scholarships were suspended for a period of 5 years.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} The scholarships for [[Hong Kong]] were abolished in July 1997 following its withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] (due to the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the [[People's Republic of China]]). However, with the benefaction from the [[Lee Hysan]] Foundation (described by the Rhodes Trust as "substantial and generous"{{Fact|date=December 2007}}), the Rhodes Scholarships for Hong Kong were reintroduced in late 2006.<ref>[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/documents/HongKongMemorandumfor2007_000.pdf The Rhodes Scholarship for Hong Kong - Memorandum for 2007]</ref>
