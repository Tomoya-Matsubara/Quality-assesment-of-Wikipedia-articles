[[Air Chief Marshal]] '''Sir Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham''',<ref>Brooke-Popham's surname at birth was Brooke. On 6 May 1904 he assumed the additional surname of Popham by [[Royal Warrant]] which was the name of a much admired ancestor.</ref> [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]], [[Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]], (18 September 1878 <U+2013> 20 October 1953) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Air Force]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]] he served in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] as a wing commander and senior staff officer.  Remaining in the new [[Royal Air Force]] after the War, Brooke-Popham was the first commandant of its [[RAF Staff College, Andover|Staff College at Andover]] and later held high command in the Middle East.  He was [[List of colonial heads of Kenya|Governor of Kenya]] in the late 1930s. Most notably, Brooke-Popham was Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Far East Command]] only months before [[Singapore]] [[Battle of Singapore|fell]] to [[Japan]]ese troops.

==Family life and education==
Brooke-Popham was born in [[England]] in the [[Suffolk]] village of [[Mendlesham]] on 18 September 1878.<ref>{{cite web

Brooke-Popham's education was not atypical of a man entering the British officer class. After his school years at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]] and his officer training at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], he was commissioned into the [[British Army]] in 1898.<ref name="air of auth">{{cite web

In January 1926, Brooke-Popham married Opal Mary, the daughter of Edgar Hugonin. They later had a son and a daughter.<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Early military career==
After graduating from Sandhurst in May 1898, Brooke-Popham was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] to the [[Oxfordshire Light Infantry]] in the rank of [[second lieutenant]].<ref name="air of auth"/> As a [[subaltern]] he saw active service in the [[Second Boer War]] during 1899 and 1900 and on 26 April 1902 he was seconded for further duty in [[South Africa]]. During his time there he served in the [[Orange Free State]], the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], the [[Orange River Colony]], and [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]].<ref name="Liddell Hart">{{cite web | title =Summary Guide - ACM Sir (Henry) Robert (Moore) (1878-1953) | work =Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives | publisher = [[King's College London]] | url =http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/lhcma/collection/a-e/br65-001/ | accessdate = 2007-09-12}}</ref> He was promoted [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 9 November 1904.<ref name="LG 24 January 1905">{{London Gazette |issue=27758 |date=24 January 1905 |startpage=580 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref> By 1910 Brooke-Popham had returned to Great Britain.<ref name="Liddell Hart" /> From 22 January 1910, he attended the [[Staff College, Camberley|Army Staff College at Camberley]].<ref name="LG 8 February 1910">{{London Gazette |issue=28337 |date=8 February 1910 |startpage=951 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref>

==Military aviation before the First World War==
Brooke-Popham was attached to [[Air Battalion Royal Engineers]] during its manoeuvres of 1911, after which he decided to learn to fly. He attended the flying school at [[Brooklands]] and gained [[Royal Aero Club]] certificate number 108 in July 1911.<ref name="ODNB"/> He returned to his regiment, the [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]], on 28 February 1912.<ref name="LG 15 March 1912">{{London Gazette |issue=28590 |date=15 March 1912 |startpage=1919 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref> However, in early 1912 he transferred to the Air Battalion, taking up duties as a pilot in March.<ref name="air of auth"/> The next month, Brooke-Popham was appointed Officer Commanding of the Battalion's Aeroplane Company.<ref name="air of auth"/>

With the creation of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) from the Air Battalion on 13 May 1912, Brooke-Popham was transferred to the RFC.<ref name="air of auth"/> He was appointed the first Officer Commanding of [[No. 3 Squadron RAF|No. 3 Squadron]].<ref name="air of auth"/> In a letter to the editor of ''Flight'' magazine, dated 23 January 1949, he wrote, "I see from an old log book that though I was seconded to the Air Battalion at the end of March 1912, it was not till the 6th May that I flew to Larkhill to take over command of No.2 (Aeroplane) Co." No. 3 Squadron was the successor unit to the Air Battalion's No. 2 (Aeroplane) Company which had been stationed at Larkhill, on Salisbury Plain, since its creation in April 1911 and thus became the oldest British, Empire or Commonwealth independent military unit to operate heavier-than-air machines.

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], Brooke-Popham went to France as the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster-General in the headquarters of the Royal Flying Corps,<ref name="air of auth"/> where he was responsible for the administrative and technical support to the squadrons deployed in the field. His understanding of the importance of air power and its support to land forces led him to criticize the lack of adequate air support to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]].<ref name="ODNB"/>

On 20 November 1914 Brooke-Popham was appointed Officer Commanding No. 3 Wing of the RFC.<ref name="air of auth"/> At this time the wing consisted of [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No. 1]] and [[No. IV Squadron RAF|No. 4]] squadrons, and on the same day as his appointment, Brooke-Popham received a temporary promotion to [[lieutenant colonel]].<ref name="air of auth"/> During the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]], Brooke-Popham directed his Wing's operations and was later awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his part in the Battle.<ref name="ODNB"/>

By 1915, Brooke-Popham was too senior an officer to take part in much operational flying, and he also had limited experience of air combat. Rather, his energies were directed into administrative and organizational activities, as he served in several staff posts at the RFC's headquarters in France. In May 1915 Brooke-Popham was appointed the RFC's Chief Staff Officer,<ref name="air of auth"/> and in March 1916 he was the Corps' Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster-General,<ref name="air of auth"/> which saw him granted the temporary rank of [[brigadier general (United Kingdom)|brigadier-general]].<ref name="air of auth"/>

[[File:Brigadier-General H R M Brooke-Popham.jpg|thumb|right|Brooke-Popham as Director of Aircraft Research in 1919]]
With the establishment of the [[Royal Air Force]] in April 1918, Brooke-Popham was transferred to the newly created [[Air Ministry]] in [[London]]. He served as the Controller of Aircraft Production for the remainder of the War and for some months afterwards.<ref name="air of auth"/>  In 1919 he served as Director of Aircraft Research.<ref name="air of auth"/>

==RAF service during the inter-war years==
===Post War honours===
Following the end of the First World War, Brooke-Popham was decorated for his contributions to the war effort. In January 1919 he was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] and made a [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]]. Later in the same year he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] and was given a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force as a [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]]. He was rapidly promoted to [[air commodore]] when the Air Force introduced its own rank system.<ref name="air of auth"/>

===Career progression===
[[File:The first RAF Staff College course at Andover.jpg|thumb|right|The first RAF Staff College course at Andover. Brooke-Popham (Commandant) is seated in the front and centre with dog on lap.]]
From 1919 to 1921, Brooke-Popham served as Director of Research at the Air Ministry and in November 1921 he was tasked with establishing the [[RAF Staff College, Andover|RAF Staff College at Andover]] and he became its first commandant on 1 April 1922.<ref name="air of auth"/>

In 1925 the [[Air Defence of Great Britain]] had been created and it was charged with defending the United Kingdom from aerial attack. The following year, Brooke-Popham was posted as [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) the Fighting Area within the Air Defence of Great Britain and he served in this capacity for the next two years.<ref name="air of auth"/> During his time as AOC Fighting Area, Brooke-Popham oversaw the establishment of a chain of huge concrete mirrors which were designed for acoustic early warning and he received a knighthood in 1927.<ref name="air of auth"/>

On 1 November 1928, Brooke-Popham was appointed AOC [[RAF Iraq Command|Iraq Command]].<ref name="air of auth"/> This high profile position put him in charge of all British forces in [[Iraq]] and, when the post of high commissioner was vacant, he acted in that capacity as well. The start of 1931 saw Brooke-Popham promoted to [[air marshal]]<ref name="air of auth"/> and then posted as the first RAF officer to serve as [[Commandant Royal College of Defence Studies|Commandant of the Imperial Defence College]].<ref name="air of auth"/> Two years later in 1933, he returned to the Air Defence of Great Britain, this time in the senior post of [[Air Officer Commander-in-Chief]].<ref name="air of auth"/> Later that year Brooke-Popham received the honorary appointment of Principal [[Aide-de-Camp]] to the King.<ref name="air of auth"/> In 1935 he left the Air Defence of Great Britain to become the [[Inspector-General of the RAF]].<ref name="air of auth"/> This was, however, a short-lived appointment and he was posted later that year.

===Commander-in-Chief RAF Middle East===
In late 1935, Brooke-Popham took up the post of Air Officer Commander-in-Chief [[RAF Middle East]]<ref name="air of auth"/> with his headquarters in [[Cairo]]. His appointment took place not long after the outbreak of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] in October 1935 and his principal aim was to deter the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' from attacking British territory in north east Africa. In 1937, Brooke-Popham relinquished his command and returned to Great Britain, retiring from the RAF on 6 March.<ref name="air of auth"/>

==Governor of Kenya==
Following [[Italy]]'s [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|occupation]] of [[Ethiopia]], the British Government wanted a military man to hold the post of [[Governor of Kenya]]. Brooke-Popham was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Kenya in 1937<ref name="air of auth"/> and his military expertise was useful in helping the colony prepare for a possible war with Italy.<ref name="ODNB"/> Under his direction, a plan was devised which concentrated defensive resources on the strategically important port of [[Mombasa]] which was judged to be the most likely Italian target.<ref name="ODNB"/> Although this left [[Nairobi]] and the highlands with only limited defences, the barren regions of northern Kenya meant that the inland settlements were geographically protected from the Italian threat further to the north.<ref name="ODNB"/> Eventually, as the Italian occupation of Ethiopia was characterized by strife and unrest, the threat to Kenya dissipated.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Brooke-Popham's governorship was also marked by improved relations with the settlers.<ref name="ODNB"/> His predecessor had sought to dominate the political and economic life of the colony which had aroused repeated opposition from some of the settlers' leaders.<ref name="ODNB"/> However, in courting settler opinion, some historians have criticized Brooke-Popham for failing to deal with those settlers who wanted to limit African and Asian freedoms in Kenya.<ref name="ODNB"/>

In 1939 on the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Brooke-Popham ordered the internment of all Germans in Kenya, directed that all aircraft be commandeered, and devised a plan to keep the colony's farms running. On 30 September 1939 he relinquished the governorship and returned to Great Britain.<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Second World War==
===Commonwealth Air Training Plan===
Brooke-Popham rejoined the RAF shortly after his return to Great Britain and only weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War. He was first appointed as head of the RAF's training mission to [[Canada]]<ref name="air of auth"/> where he worked on the establishment of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Commonwealth Air Training Plan]]. In 1940 Brooke-Popham was made head of the training mission to [[South Africa]]<ref name="air of auth"/> where he continued work on the Plan.

===Commander-in-Chief Far East Command===
====Command arrangements====
On 18 November 1940, at the age of 62, Brooke-Popham was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Far East Command]]<ref name="No prisoners">{{cite web
  | title =Timeline - Follow the sequence of events in the Japanese campaign leading to the fall of Singapore

This was a considerably more demanding undertaking than any of Brooke-Popham's many previous appointments. The [[Command (military formation)|Command]] had been newly created and Brooke-Popham was the first RAF officer to be appointed Commander-in-Chief of a joint command during a major world conflict.<ref name="ODNB"/> Additionally, there was a significant gap between the Commander-in-Chief's responsibility and his authority, as Brooke-Popham was nominally responsible for all defence matters in the British Far East colonies but the [[Royal Navy]] units in these waters did not come under his command; rather they reported to their own naval commander-in-chief in London. Furthermore, the civil servants in the Far East also did not report to the Commander-in-Chief, working instead for ministers in London.<ref name="ODNB"/>

====Insufficient defences====
With the Japanese threatening in south-east Asia, Brooke-Popham knew he had to build up the defences of the region. Those defences which already existed were primarily directed towards an attack from the sea and everywhere sufficient forces were lacking.<ref name="ODNB"/> The Command's aerial defences were particularly deficient and the priority attached to operations in the [[Middle East]] meant that British resources were directed elsewhere.<ref name="ODNB"/> During the following year, Brooke-Popham struggled without much success to build up defences, get the much-needed reinforcements and rectify the unsound command arrangements. {See [[SS Automedon]] incident}

====Operation ''Matador''====
{{main|Operation Matador (1941)}}
In August 1941 Brooke-Popham submitted a plan for the defence of Malaya to London for approval. This plan, code-named ''Matador'', worked on the basis that the Japanese would land on the east coast of [[Thailand]] and then advance south. The essence of Operation ''Matador'' was that Allied forces would advance into Thailand and fight the Japanese there. However, the plan relied upon force levels not available to Brooke-Popham and involved violating neutral Thailand with whom a non-aggression pact had been signed the previous year.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Concern regarding the situation prompted the government in London to send [[Duff Cooper]] as a special [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] envoy. Cooper's arrival in September 1941, did not help to maintain Brooke-Popham's authority in a difficult situation.<ref name="ODNB"/>

On 22 November, with the Japanese establishing sea and air bases in southern [[Indo-China]], Brooke-Popham urged London that Operation ''Matador'' should be put into effect, granting him permission to advance into southern Thailand. Brooke-Popham did eventually receive permission on 5 December although many conditions were attached.<ref name="ODNB"/> The plan was reworked to take account of the limited forces available and on 8 December the war with Japan began.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Although it had been agreed in London that Brooke-Popham should be replaced as commander-in-chief on 1 November 1941, the change was not made because of the critical situation. However, with the war with Japan now unfolding, many believed that Brooke-Popham was near to a nervous collapse. The cabinet envoy Duff Cooper urged his replacement and London agreed. On 27 December, at the height of the [[Battle of Malaya|battle for Malaya]], Brooke-Popham handed over command to [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Henry Pownall|Sir Henry Pownall]].<ref name="ODNB"/>

Brooke-Popham's return to Great Britain was closely followed by the [[fall of Singapore]] on 15 February 1942. Inevitably, Brooke-Popham was associated with the collapse and he was publicly attacked by some in Britain as the man chiefly responsible for the defeat.<ref name="ODNB"/>

===Later War years===
In May 1942, Brooke-Popham retired from active service in the RAF for the second time. His reputation severely damaged by the events in the Far East, he nevertheless continued to serve where he could. At some stage in 1942, Brooke-Popham became Inspector-General of the [[Air Training Corps]], a position he continued in until 1945. From 1944 to 1946, he served as President of the [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes]] Council.<ref name="air of auth"/>

==Later years==
After Brooke-Popham relinquished his role as President of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes Council, he lived in retirement. Brooke-Popham died in the hospital at [[RAF Halton]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] on 20 October 1953.  His funeral took place at St. Edburg's Church in [[Bicester]] and he was buried privately in [[Somerset]].<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1953/1953%20-%201450.html Sir Robert Brooke-Popham] Flight International, 30 October 1953</ref>
