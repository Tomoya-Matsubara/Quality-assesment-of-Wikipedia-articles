'''Theodore Garland, Jr.''' (born 28 November 1956) is a [[biologist]] specializing in [[evolutionary physiology]].  He was on the faculty at the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]] for 14 years, served at the [[National Science Foundation]] for one year, and is currently Professor of Biology at the [[University of California, Riverside]].  He earned his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Zoology]] and [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in [[Biology]] at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], working with William Glenn Bradley, a [[mammalogist]], and his [[Ph.D.]] in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the [[University of California, Irvine]] under Albert F. Bennett in the comparative physiology group that also included [[Grover C. Stephens]].  While in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], he served as President of the Southern Nevada Herpetology Association.  During his Ph.D. work, he recorded the speed of the world's fastest lizard, ''[[Ctenosaura similis]]''.  Subsequently, he completed postdoctoral training at the [[University of Washington]] with [[Raymond B. Huey]], which included attending a course in [[quantitative genetics]] taught by [[Joe Felsenstein]].

His major scientific contributions have been in the areas of:

* [[lizard]] locomotor [[physiology]] and [[ecology]];

* [[allometry]]

* [[phylogenetic comparative methods]] (e.g., [http://mesquiteproject.org/pdap_mesquite/index.html Mesquite:PDAP:PDTree]);

* the application of [[artificial selection]] experiments to understand the correlated [[evolution]] of [[physiology]] and [[behavior]], as well as the physiological, neurobiological, and [[genetics|genetic]] bases of voluntary activity levels ([[physical exercise]]).

==Awards==
In 1983-84, he was a Visiting [[Fulbright Scholar]] at the [[University of Wollongong]], [[Australia]], hosted by Anthony J. Hulbert.  In 1991, he received a [http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=9157268 Presidential Young Investigator Award] from the [[National Science Foundation]].
