The '''Israeli<U+2013>Palestinian conflict in Hebron''' is the site of frequent incidents within the wider [[Israeli<U+2013>Palestinian conflict]]. [[Hebron]] is home to 160,000 Palestinians and 500-800 Israeli settlers. The Israeli settlers live in close proximity to the city boundary and require a constant Israeli military presence.<ref>[[William B.

[[File:Desecrated synagogue, Hebron 1929.jpg|thumb|200px|Synagogue desecrated during the 1929 Hebron massacre]]In the mid-19th century, Hebron was small town with a population of around 10,000, the majority of whom were Muslims.<ref name="p.88">Robinson, [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa&cc=moa&idno=afg7241.0002.001&q1=hebron&frm=frameset&view=image&seq=106 p.88]</ref>
From December 1917, during World War I, the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British occupied]] [[Hebron]], a move sanctioned by the [[League of Nations]]. During the [[1929 Hebron massacre]], 67 Jews were killed by Arab rioters, and many incidents of rape, mutilation, and torture were reported.<ref name=segev>{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Segev |title=One Palestine, Complete |year=2000 |publisher=Metropolitan Books |isbn=0-8050-4848-0 |pages=314<U+2013>327 }}</ref> As a result, the Jewish community of 750 people was disbanded.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In 1931, 160 Jews returned to the town,<ref>Tom Segev (2000) p 347</ref> but after further [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab unrest]], the British Government decided to move all Jews out of Hebron "to prevent another massacre".

At the beginning of the [[1948 Arab<U+2013>Israeli War]], Egypt took control of Hebron. By late 1948 part of the Egyptian forces had been isolated around Hebron and Bethlehem, [[John Bagot Glubb|Pasha Glubb]] sent 350 [[Arab Legion]]naires and established a Jordanian presence in Hebron.<ref>Wilson, Mary Christina.

==Israeli rule and Jewish re-settlement==

Following the June 1967 [[Six Day War]], Hebron came under Israeli control with the rest of the [[West Bank]]. The vacillations in the Israeli cabinet after the Six Day War, over annexation and the political realism in wanting to maintain the majority Jewish demographic of Israel left the Israeli leadership in a quandary in ways to deal with the newly occupied territories.<ref>Golda Meir (2007) ISBN 978-1-906142-13-1 p. 293</ref> Israel's position was that parts of the [[West Bank]] be [[land for peace|traded for peace]] with Jordan.<ref>[[Chaim Herzog]] ''Heroes of Israel'' p.253.</ref> In what was called the [[Allon Plan]], Israel was to annex 45% of the West Bank and Jordan the remainder.<ref>''He [Allon] proposed that Israel annex a strip of land 6<U+2013>9 miles wide along the Jordan River, most of the sparsely populated Judean desert along the Dead Sea, and a wide swath of land around Greater Jerusalem. The Heart of the West bank - its great Arab cities and most densely populated towns - could be returned to Jordan.'' Elinor Burkett  (2007) Golda Meir; The Iron Lady of the Middle East ISBN 978-1-906142-13-1 pp 295<U+2013>296</ref>

In an interview with the ''[[BBC]]'' on July 12, 1967, Former Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] declared that:

<blockquote>''....in the cause of peace, Israel should take nothing in the conquered territories, with the exception of Hebron, which 'is more Jewish even than Jerusalem'.'' According to Randolph Churchill, he [Ben-Gurion] argued that ''"Jerusalem became Jewish three thousand years ago under King David. but Hebron became Jewish four thousand years ago under Abraham and included a number of settlements that were destroyed two days before Israel was established."''<ref>Randolph Churchill and Winston S. Churchill, ''The Six Day War,''1967 p.199 citing 'The World at One' BBC radio, July 12, 1967</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>The government was caught by surprise. Internally divided, depending for its survival on the votes of the [[National Religious Party]], and reluctant to forcibly evacuate the settlers from a city whose Jewish population had been massacred thirty-nine years earlier, the [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|Labor government]] backed away from its original prohibition against civilian settlement in the area and permitted this group to remain within a military compound. After more than a year and a half of agitation and a bloody Arab attack on the Hebron settlers, the government agreed to allow Levinger's group to establish a town on the outskirts of the city.<ref>Ian S.

Beginning in 1979, some Jewish settlers moved from Kiryat Arba to found the [[Committee of The Jewish Community of Hebron]] in the former Jewish neighbourhood near the [[Abraham Avinu Synagogue]], and later to other Hebron neighborhoods including [[Tel Rumeida]]. They took over the former [[Hadassah Hospital]], Daboya Hospital, now Beit Hadassah in central Hebron, founding the [[Committee of The Jewish Community of Hebron]].

The sentiments of Jews who fled the [[1929 Hebron massacre]] and their descendants are mixed.

The city of Hebron has been a major friction point, with Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups accusing the hard-line religious settlers of attacking the Palestinian population with impunity.
