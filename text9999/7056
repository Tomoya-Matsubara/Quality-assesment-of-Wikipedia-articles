There are nine '''castles in Greater Manchester''', a [[metropolitan county]] in [[North West England|North West]] [[England]]. Four are [[motte-and-bailey]]s, three are fortified [[manor house]]s, a [[ringwork]], and a possible [[shell keep]]. A motte-and-bailey castle has two elements, the [[motte]] is an artificial conical mound with a wooden [[stockade]] and stronghold on top, usually a stone [[keep]] or tower;<ref>Friar (2003), p.&nbsp;54,&nbsp;214.</ref> a [[bailey]] is a defended enclosure below the motte, surrounded by a ditch.<ref>Friar (2003), p.&nbsp;22.</ref> Motte-and-bailey castles were the most common type of castle in England following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].<ref>Rowley (1997), p.&nbsp;71.</ref> Ringworks are similar to motte-and-baileys although lack the characteristic motte;<ref>Friar (2003), p.&nbsp;246.</ref> they are an uncommon form of fortification &ndash; though contemporary with [[motte-and-bailey]]s &ndash; a ringwork may have been built rather than a motte-and-bailey because the soil was too thin to provide a proper motte.<ref>Grimsditch, Nevell, and Redhead (2007), p.&nbsp;10.</ref> A shell keep was a motte with a stone wall rather than a wooden stockade on top; there would have been no tower within the walls.<ref>Friar (2003), p.&nbsp;259.</ref> Five of Greater Manchester's castles are [[Scheduled Monuments in Greater Manchester|Scheduled Ancient Monuments]]: [[Buckton Castle|Buckton]], [[Bury Castle|Bury]], [[Radcliffe Tower]], [[Stockport Castle|Stockport]], and Watch Hill. A Scheduled Ancient Monument is a "nationally important" [[archaeological site]] or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Schedule of Monuments |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1369 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk |accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>

The purpose of a castle was not simply militaristic, but was a stamp of authority over the population of an area and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a [[manorialism|manor]].<ref>Friar (2003), p.&nbsp;186,&nbsp;193.</ref> The earliest castles in Greater Manchester are Dunham and Watch Hill in Trafford, Ullerwood in Manchester, and Stockport Castle in Stockport. They were first recorded in 1173 as belonging to [[Revolt of 1173<U+2013>1174|barons who had rebelled]] against [[Henry II of England|Henry II]],<ref>Arrowsmith (1997), p.&nbsp;31.</ref> and at least three were motte-and-bailey castles, probably because of the speed and ease with which they could be erected.<ref name="Watch Hill"/> [[Hamon de Massey]], who owned the Trafford castles and Ullerwood, and [[Geoffrey de Constentyn]], who owned Stockport Castle, were two of the three rebels from Cheshire; the other was the [[Earl of Chester]], the owner of [[Chester Castle]].<ref>Arrowsmith (1997), p.&nbsp;31.</ref> Castles continued to be built in the area, although the last to be built in Greater Manchester were two fortified manor houses near [[Bury]], built more for comfort than as utilitarian military structures. [[Bury Castle]] and [[Radcliffe Tower]] followed the national trend in the 13th century; they would most likely have acted as the centre of the manor they served.<ref>Friar (2003), p.&nbsp;186-7.</ref>
