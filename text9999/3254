"Strawberry Bubblegum" begins with the sound of a [[stylus]] dropping on a [[vinyl record]], which Gregory Hicks of ''[[The Michigan Daily]]'' felt evoked a characteristic sound from [[Christina Aguilera]]'s 2006 album ''[[Back to Basics (Christina Aguilera album)|Back to Basics]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/arts/03justin-timberlake-%E2%80%93-2020-experience18 |title=Timberlake introduces a seductive, new generation of R&B for 'The 20/20 Experience' |publisher=The Michigan Daily |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref> The line "Hey, pretty lady" is declared by a deep voice, and Timberlake sings "This goes out to you!".<ref name="ABC NEWS"/> [[ABC News]] reporter Allan Raible wrote that "such a move seems engineered to make gullible teen girls in the audience scream".<ref name="ABC NEWS">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/03/review-justin-timberlakes-the-2020-experience/|title=Review: Justin Timberlake's 'The 20/20 Experience'|publisher=[[ABC News]].
