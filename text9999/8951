The '''first season of ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''''' originally aired in the United States on the [[NBC]] television network between April&nbsp;9 and May&nbsp;14, 2009. Produced by [[Deedle-Dee Productions]] and [[Universal Media Studios]], the series was created by [[Greg Daniels]] and [[Michael Schur]], who served as executive producers with [[Howard Klein]].

The comedy series focuses on [[Leslie Knope]] ([[Amy Poehler]]), the deputy director of the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, [[Indiana]]. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the show when NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of his comedy series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', on which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, though it would share the [[mockumentary]] style of ''The Office''. Like that show, ''Parks and Recreation'' encouraged improvisation among its cast members.

Early test screenings were poor, and many critics and industry observers were skeptical about the show's chances of success. The first season received generally mixed to negative reviews, and several commentators found it too similar to ''The Office''. The [[Pilot (Parks and Recreation)|premiere episode]] was watched by 6.77&nbsp;million households, but the viewership declined almost every week in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. A season low of 4.25&nbsp;million households watched the final episode, "[[Rock Show (Parks and Recreation)|Rock Show]]". Despite the low rating, "Rock Show" received the best reviews of the season and convinced some critics that the series had finally found the right tone.

Immediately after [[Ben Silverman]] was named co-chairman of [[NBC]]'s entertainment division in 2007, he asked Greg Daniels to create a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''The Office'', the half-hour comedy Daniels adapted from the [[The Office (UK TV series)|British comedy of the same name]], created by [[Ricky Gervais]].<ref name="NYT0326" /><ref name="Leitch0405">{{Cite news |last=Leitch |first=Will |author-link=Will Leitch |title=The Poehler Effect |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2009-04-05 |url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/55851/ |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> Daniels co-created ''Parks and Recreation'' with Michael Schur, who had been a writer on ''The Office''. Like Daniels, Schur had previously worked on the NBC sketch comedy show ''Saturday Night Live''.<ref name="Martin1118" /> The two spent months considering ideas for the new series and debating whether to make it a stand-alone show rather than a spin-off.<ref name="NYT0326" /> According to Daniels, they eventually abandoned the original spin-off plan because they "couldn't find the right fit".<ref name="Leitch0405" /> After Poehler agreed to play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government.<ref name="NYT0326" /> The idea was partly inspired by the portrayal of local politics on the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[The Wire]]'', as well as the renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]].<ref name="Martin1118" /><ref name="Weiner1202">{{Cite news |last=Weiner |first=Jonah |title=You really should be watching NBC's ''Parks and Recreation'' |publisher=[[Slate.com]] |date=2009-12-02 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2237077/ |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>

Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with ''The Office'', particularly the [[mockumentary]] approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with ''The Office'', the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.<ref name="NYT0326" />

The series was scheduled as a mid-season replacement<ref name="Martin1118" /> and rushed into production to meet the premiere date of April 9, 2009.<ref name="Sepinwall0409" /> As a result, when the series was featured at a panel during the January 2009 television critics press tour, NBC did not have a finished episode to screen, only a copy of the pilot script available for review.<ref name="Sepinwall0409" /> Some of the parts were still not cast and the series, which did not yet have a name, was refered to as ''The Untitled Amy Poehler Project'' or ''TUAPP''.<ref name="Sepinwall0917" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Bentley |first=Rick |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2009-04-08 |title=Like pal Tina Fey, ex-SNL'-er Amy Poehler gets her own NBC sitcom |url=http://www.nj.com/newsflash/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-0/1239200680261080.xml&storylist=entertainment |accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> The name ''Public Service'' was considered, but ultimately rejected because network officials did not want to be accused of mocking the idea.

===Writing===
The show's writers spent time researching local California politics and attending [[Los Angeles City Council]] meetings.<ref name="Martin1118" /> Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This confirmed his existing impression: "I've been to some community meetings in my life, and it is often this feeling of utter sparseness. That nobody cares."<ref name="PilotCommentary" /> The depiction of public hearings in several ''Parks and Recreation'' episodes was inspired by this perspective, which was also the basis for the entire "Canvassing" episode.<ref name="CanvassingCommentary" /> Schur asked urban planners in [[Claremont, California]], whether efforts to turn a construction pit into a park could realistically take several months or longer. They told him that was entirely plausible, and that they had recently broken ground on a park that had been in various planning stages for 18 years.<ref name="Leitch0405" />

The Pawnee residents vocally opposed to Leslie's park proposal were based on real-life California residents the show's producers encountered who fought the construction of parks in their hometowns. One such group, the Committee for a Better Park, was actually opposed to parks in general, and the deceptiveness of their name and mission inspired the producers' writing for those characters.<ref>{{Cite video | people=Goor, Daniel J. |date=2009|title=Parks and Recreation: Season One: "[[Canvassing (Parks and Recreation)|Canvassing]]" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> The ''Parks and Recreation'' staff worked with a number of consultants familiar with local government work, including Scott Albright, a California city planner who provided feedback for the Mark Brendanawicz character.<ref>{{Cite video | people=[[Michael Schur|Schur, Michael]]|date=2009|title=Parks and Recreation: Season One: "Rock Show" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Inspiration for Ron Swanson came from an encounter Schur had in Burbank with an elected official, a Libertarian who favored minimal government and admitted, "I don't really believe in the mission of my job."<ref name="Martin1118" />

Daniels and Schur wrote the script for the pilot episode in mid-2008.<ref name="NYT0326" /> The original script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to [[greenlight]] the park because he is inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings.<ref name="Sepinwall0514"/> When the season concluded, the writers had not decided what would happen with the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Mark and Ann.<ref name="BanquetCommentary" />

''Parks and Recreation'' involves a mixture of written dialogue and comedic improvisation. In one example from the pilot episode, Aziz Ansari's character attempts to flirt with Rashida Jones's when she speaks at a parks and recreation public forum. Ansari continued to improvise long after completing his scripted dialogue.<ref name="PilotCommentary" /> In the season's final episode, "Rock Show", Andy goes through a list of the previous names of his rock band. About half the band names used in the episode came directly from the script, but after actor Chris Pratt made up one on the spot, the directors encouraged him to keep improvising. Pratt said he went through about 200 fake band names during the take.<ref name="Fowler"/>

===Filming===
''Parks and Recreation'' faced early production delays because Poehler was pregnant when she signed on; filming had to be postponed until she gave birth.<ref name="Martin1118" /><ref name="Sepinwall0917" /> Principal photography began on February 18, 2009.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dos Santos |first=Kristin |title=Amy Poehler's New Show Starts Today |publisher=[[E!]] |date=2009-02-18 |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b81079_amy_poehlers_new_show_starts_today.html |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> The show was filmed in Southern California, and the construction pit featured throughout the season was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys]], a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for the dig.<ref name="DanielsPilotCommentary" /> The pit was guarded 24&nbsp;hours a day,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tan |first=Jennie |title=Parks and Recreation set |date=2009-04-09 |work=OfficeTally |url=http://www.officetally.com/parks-and-recreation-set-visit/2 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref> and [[paparazzi]] regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, and several of the hallway scenes, were shot at [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] City Hall.<ref name="DanielsPilotCommentary" /> The parks and recreation department interiors, as well as the Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons.<ref name="PilotCommentary" /><ref name="BoysClubCommentary" /> Scenes set in playgrounds and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles,<ref name="DanielsPilotCommentary" /><ref name="CanvassingCommentary" /> and the public forum scenes in the premiere episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools.<ref name="DanielsPilotCommentary" />

Schur said the ''Parks and Recreation'' producers approach each episode as if they are filming a real documentary. They typically shoot enough for a 35- or 40-minute episode, then cut it down to 22 minutes, using the best material.<ref name="ReporterCommentary">{{Cite video | people=[[Michael Schur|Schur, Michael]]|date=2009|title=Parks and Recreation: Season One: "The Reporter" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Due to the improvisational acting and hand-held camerawork, a great deal of extra footage is shot that must be discarded for the final cut.<ref name="PilotCommentary" /><ref name="BanquetCommentary">{{cite video | people=[[Amy Poehler|Poehler, Amy]]|date=2009|title=Parks and Recreation: Season One: "The Banquet" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> According to Poehler, "For every show, there could probably be a second show of stuff we've edited out."<ref name="BanquetCommentary" /> The original cut of the 22-minute pilot was 48 minutes long.<ref name="PilotCommentary" /> The producers film about nine pages of the script each day, a large amount by U.S. television standards.<ref name="BanquetCommentary" />

Although the series shares a mockumentary style with ''The Office'', Daniels and Schur sought to establish a slightly different tone in the camerawork of the pilot episode. The one-on-one interviews, for example, sometimes feature two separate camera angles on the same person; the footage is intercut to create the final version of the scene. This technique was inspired by ''[[The Five Obstructions]]'', a 2003 experimental documentary directed by [[Lars Von Trier]] and [[J<U+00F8>rgen Leth]], which Daniels watched at the suggestion of actor Paul Schneider.<ref name="DanielsPilotCommentary">{{cite video | people=[[Greg Daniels|Daniels, Greg]]|date=2009|title=Parks and Recreation: Season One: "Pilot" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> ''Parks and Recreation'' also makes frequent use of the [[jump cut]] technique. For instance, one scene in the pilot episode repeatedly jump cuts between brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project.<ref name="DanielsPilotCommentary" /> Early in the season, editor Dean Holland developed a technique that would be used throughout the series. During a scene in "[[The Reporter (Parks and Recreation)|The Reporter]]" in which Leslie reacts to quotes read to her by the journalist, Poehler improvised a number of jokes, many of which were ultimately going to be cut from the episode. Holland thought they were all funny, so he created a brief montage intercutting several of the lines.<ref name="ReporterCommentary"/> The producers sought to lend authenticity to the fictional Pawnee setting by incorporating real-life Indiana elements. They contacted the [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]<U+2013>based [[Upland Brewing Company]] and asked for empty beer bottles and labels to be used as background props.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Upland beer makes it on national TV |work=[[The Herald-Times]] |date=2009-05-01 |url=http://www.heraldtimesonline.com/stories/2009/05/01/business.qp-2383661.sto |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=195px |align=right | quote = Since the show is from the very people who brought you ''The Office'', it's starting to look like a one-trick pony outfit that's gonna keep dressing that horse up in new saddles, hoping that no one will guess it's been around the track so many times, it's worn a ditch in the dirt. | source = '''Linda Stasi<br>''[[New York Post]]'''''<ref name="NYPost0409" />}}
The first season of ''Parks and Recreation'' started to receive criticism before the premiere episode aired. According to a March 18, 2009, report that was leaked to television journalist [[Nikki Finke]], focus groups responded poorly to a rough-cut version of the pilot.<ref name="Martin1118" /><ref name="Finke">{{Cite news |last=Finke |first=Nikki |author-link=Nikki Finke |title=NBC's Bad Sitcom, Lionsgate's Badass Battle and Iatse's Badly Handled Contract |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=2009-03-25 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-03-26/news/nbc-39-s-bad-sitcom-lionsgate-39-s-bad-ass-battle-and-iatse-39-s-badly-handled-contract/ |accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> Many focus group members felt the show was a "carbon copy" of ''The Office''. Some found it predictable, slow paced and lacking in character development, and felt the beginning of the episode needed to better explain the setting and plot. Some viewers said the show lacked strong male characters, particularly a "datable" lead. On the other hand, viewers said the show's portrayal of government bureaucracy was "very believable" and had the potential to generate amusing situations. While Poehler's character drew mixed comments, the actress herself was "well liked".<ref name="Finke" /> The early feedback left many critics and industry observers skeptical about the show's chances of success.<ref name="Martin1118" /><ref name="NYPost0409">{{Cite news |last=Stasi |first=Linda |title=Amy Poehler quit "SNL" for "Parks and Recreation" |work=[[New York Post]] |date=2009-04-09 |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/04092009/tv/raiders_of_the_lost_park_163556.htm |accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> In response to the leak, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, said the feedback on rough cuts is usually negative, even with ultimately successful shows.<ref name="NYPost0409"/> Schur said that the pilot had been completely re-edited at least four times since the focus group described in the report were held.<ref name="Leitch0405" />

===Ratings===
''Parks and Recreation''{{'}}s premiere was seen in 6.77 million households.<ref name="PilotRating"/> Media outlets described this as a solid result, comparable to the average [[Nielsen ratings]] for ''[[30 Rock]]'', another Thursday-night show on NBC.<ref name="PilotRating"/><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ryan |first=Joal |title=Parks and Rec's Solid Approval Rating" |publisher=[[E!]] |date=2009-04-10 |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b118103_parks_recs_solid_approval_rating.html |accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> However, viewership declined almost every week over the rest of the season,<ref name="Martin1118" />{{#tag:ref|The Nielsen ratings for the second episode, "Canvassing", dropped to 5.92 million households.<ref name="CanvassingRating"/> The subsequent ratings were 5.24 million households for "The Reporter",<ref name="ReporterRating"/> 5.29 million for "Boys' Club",<ref name="BoysClubRating"/> 4.64 million for "The Banquet",<ref name="BanquetRating"/> and 4.25 million for "Rock Show".<ref name="RockShowRating" />|group="nb"}} culminating in a season low of 4.25 million households for the final episode.<ref name="RockShowRating" /> ''The Office'' experienced similarly poor ratings during its first season and later became a success. However, the low viewership presented a greater challenge for ''Parks and Recreation'' because NBC now trailed [[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the ratings, and the move of comedian [[Jay Leno]] from ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' to [[The Jay Leno Show|a variety show]] in NBC's 10 p.m. weeknight slot left less room on the network's primetime schedule.<ref name="NYT0326" />

==DVD release==
The first season of ''Parks and Recreation'' was released on DVD in the United States on September 8, 2009. The DVD included all six episodes, as well as an "Extended Producer's Cut" of the season finale, "Rock Show". The disc also included cast and crew commentary tracks for each episode, as well as about 30&nbsp;minutes of deleted scenes.<ref name="Murray"/>
