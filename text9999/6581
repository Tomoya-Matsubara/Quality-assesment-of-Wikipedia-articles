{{Campaignbox Croatian War of Independence}}

The '''Battle of the Barracks''' ({{lang-hr|Bitka za vojarne}}) was a series of engagements between the [[Croatian National Guard]] (''Zbor narodne garde'' <U+2013> ZNG, later renamed the [[Croatian Army]]) and the [[Law enforcement in Croatia|Croatian police]] on one side and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' <U+2013> JNA) on another in September&ndash;November 1991. The battle took place around numerous JNA posts throughout [[Croatia]], starting with Croatian forces blockading the JNA barracks, weapons storage depots and other facilities. It formally began on 14 September, and its objective was to neutralise the JNA positions in the ZNG-held territory and secure arms and ammunition to the poorly equipped ZNG.

The Battle of the Barracks was an escalation of the conflict between Croatian authorities and the [[Croatian Serb]]s who [[Log Revolution|openly revolted]] in August 1990 and the JNA efforts to preserve the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]]. At the same time,  Croatia made moves towards [[Independence of Croatia|achieving its independence]] from Yugoslavia. The Battle of the Barracks briefly preceded the start of the [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|JNA's campaign in Croatia]]&mdash;itself amended in early September to add relief of the blockaded barracks to the operation plans. However, the JNA's advance was largely curbed by the ZNG, and it relieved only few JNA facilities.

The ZNG and the police captured small and isolated JNA posts, as well as a number of large weapons depots and barracks, including the entire 32nd ([[Vara<U+017E>din]]) Corps of the JNA. The move provided the Croatian forces with a sizable stock of weapons, including 250 tanks, hundreds of artillery pieces and large supply of [[small arms]] and ammunition&mdash;proving crucial in defence against the JNA advances in the early stage of the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Some of the JNA facilities surrendered without any fight, while others put up armed resistance to the takeover. In some places, this caused civilian casualties as the barracks were situated in urban areas. Legal charges of abuse or killing of captured JNA personnel, as well as charges with war crimes against civilian population were filed in Croatia, but most defendants remain at large.

In November, the JNA and Croatia reached several agreements to end the blockade and pull out the JNA out of Croatia. The pullout was completed by 4 January 1992, except in areas around [[Dubrovnik]], and on the islands of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] and [[Lastovo]]. The JNA maintained its presence there until the summer of 1992. As the JNA withdrew from the areas it controlled in Croatia, it was replaced by the [[UNPROFOR|UN peacekeepers]] agreed upon by the [[Vance plan]].

==Background==
In 1990, following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|electoral defeat]] of the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], ethnic tensions worsened. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' <U+2013> JNA) confiscated Croatia's [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] (''Teritorijalna obrana'' <U+2013> TO) weapons to minimize resistance.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=117}}</ref> On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]],<ref name=Hoare118>{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=118}}</ref> centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around [[Knin]], (approximately {{convert|60|km|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Split, Croatia|Split]]),<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|19 August 1990}}</ref> parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] and [[eastern Croatia]].<ref name=MarticICTY>{{harvnb|ICTY|12 June 2007}}</ref> [[Republic of Serbia (1990<U+2013>2006)|Serbia]], supported by [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Serbia's provinces of [[Vojvodina]] and [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]] unsuccessfully tried to obtain [[Yugoslav Presidency]]'s approval of a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|pp=118<U+2013>119}}</ref> The denied request, and [[Pakrac clash|a bloodless skirmish]] between Serb insurgents and [[Lu<U+010D>ko Anti-Terrorist Unit|Croatian special police]] in March,<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|pp=384<U+2013>385}}</ref> prompted the JNA itself to ask the federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies, the JNA was denied on 15 March. Serbian President [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]], preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>'s control.<ref name=Hoare119>{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=119}}</ref> By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated to [[Plitvice Lakes incident|the first fatalities]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 March 1991}}</ref> In early April, leaders of Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention of integration of the area under their control, viewed by the [[Government of Croatia]] as a breakaway region, with Serbia.<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}</ref>

In the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was 3,000-strong special police deployed in twelve [[battalion]]s adopting military organization of the units. In addition there were 9,000&ndash;10,000 regionally organized reserve police. The reserve police was set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but the reserve force lacked weapons.<ref name=BB86>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=86}}</ref> As a response to the deteriorating situation, the Croatian government established the [[Croatian National Guard]] (''Zbor narodne garde'' <U+2013> ZNG) in May.<ref name=EECIS272>{{harvnb|EECIS|1999|pp=272<U+2013>278}}</ref> This was achieved by [[wikt:Amalgamation|amalgamation]] of the special police battalions into four all-professional guards brigades consisting at that point of approximately 8,000 troops combined, and their subordination to the [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Ministry of Defence]] headed by retired JNA [[General]] [[Martin <U+0160>pegelj]]. The regional police, expanded to 40,000 by then, was also attached to the ZNG and reorganized in 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions. However the guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully armed with [[small arms]], while heavier weapons, as well as a command and control structure were lacking throughout the ZNG.<ref name=BB86/> The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to use of [[World War II]] weapons taken from museums and film studios.<ref name=Ramet400>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=400}}</ref> At the time, Croatian stockpile of weapons consisted of 30,000 small arms purchased abroad in addition to 15,000 previously owned by the police. A new 10,000-strong special police was established then to replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades.<ref name=BB86/>

==Prelude==
Croatian view of the JNA's role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved in the January&ndash;September 1991. The initial plan of [[Croatian President]] [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man]] was to win support from the [[European Community]] (EC) and the [[United States]] for Croatia, and dismissed advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Capturing the JNA barracks and storage depots was first advocated by <U+0160>pegelj in late 1990. He urged Tu<U+0111>man again to adopt the plan in early 1991, and in summer of that year while the JNA fought [[Slovenia]]'s TO in the [[Ten-Day War]] in June&ndash;July 1991. His calls were echoed by [[<U+0160>ime <U+0110>odan]], who replaced <U+0160>pegelj as the Defence Minister in July. <U+0160>pegelj remained in command of the ZNG though.<ref name=BB91>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=91}}</ref>

Tu<U+0111>man's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA. The ZNG was limited to defence even though actions of the JNA appeared coordinated with the Croatian Serb military.<ref name=BB91/> The impression was reinforced by [[buffer zone]]s the JNA established after armed conflicts between the Croatian Serb militia and the ZNG&mdash;the JNA intervened after the ZNG lost ground, leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of territory they captured before the JNA arrived. Furthermore, the JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although the bulk of the weaponry was provided from the Serbia's TO and [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] stocks.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=92}}</ref>

In July 1991, <U+0160>pegelj and <U+0110>odan's demands were backed up by a number of [[Croatian Parliament]] members during a parliamentary debate. This led Tu<U+0111>man to sack <U+0110>odan the same month he was appointed the Defence Minister, and <U+0160>pegelj resigned his post on 3 August. Nonetheless, deteriorating situation in the east of Croatia,<ref name=BB91/> including JNA forces removing the ZNG from [[Baranja]] and intermittent fighting around [[Osijek]], [[Vukovar]] and [[Vinkovci]],<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=93}}</ref> as well as increasing losses and growing conviction that the JNA actively supports the Croatian Serb revolt, forced Tu<U+0111>man to act. On 22 August, he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the JNA to withdraw to its barracks by the end of the month. The ultimatum stated if the JNA failed to comply, Croatia would consider the JNA an army of occupation and take corresponding action.<ref name=BB91/> On 1 September, the EC proposed a cease-fire and a peace conference was accepted by Tu<U+0111>man, despite his ultimatum demanding the JNA to return to its barracks by 31 August, and by the Yugoslav Presidency. The conference started on 7 September, but only four days later, the Croatian member and chair of the presidency, [[Stjepan Mesi<U+0107>]], ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=94}}</ref> The move was motivated by Tu<U+0111>man's impression that the conference would drag endlessly while the ZNG loses ground. Even though the order was disputed by other members of the body, it gave Croatia a justification to openly confront the JNA.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=94<U+2013>95}}</ref>

===October===
[[File:JNA offensive plan 1991.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|1991 JNA campaign in Croatia]] plan]]
On 3 October, the Croatian forces captured "Jo<U+017E>a Vlahovi<U+0107>" JNA barracks in Koprivnica, and a communications post and a border post near the city.<ref name=Skvorc123/> The next day, JNA barracks in Sinj and its nearby [[land mine]] storage facility were abandoned after a negotiated agreement.<ref>{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|16 January 2012}}</ref> In early October, two JNA artillery regiments based in "<U+0160>epurine" barracks near Zadar broke through a siege laid around their base and joined JNA attack on the city.

In the wake of the [[bombing of Banski dvori]] of 7 October, Croatian authorities instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in Zagreb area if commanders on the ground considered that possible. The instructions resulted in no attacks in Zagreb itself,<ref name=VL-150112>{{harvnb|Ve<U+010D>ernji list|15 January 2012}}</ref> but JNA barracks in [[Samobor]] were captured by the Croatian forces on the day of the bombing.<ref>{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|September 2011}}</ref> The declaration of the [[independence of Croatia]] came into force the next day.<ref name=VL-150112/>

On 13 October, O<U+0161>tarije JNA barracks were largely destroyed by the JNA and abandoned,<ref name=Ogulin/> and a JNA weapons storage facilities in Rijeka were damaged in a fire caused by a thunderstorm. Nonetheless, some weapons were taken away by the ZNG while the firefighters were called in to save individual storage structures. The next day, the JNA was moving the remaining weapons from the damaged storage elsewhere in the city. While a convoy of 18 trucks was moving through Rijeka, 15 vehicles carrying weapons were diverted and captured by the ZNG.<ref name=NL10/> At the same time, "Borongaj" JNA barracks in Zagreb were allowed to evacuate in return for free passage of a [[humanitarian aid]] carrying convoy to Vukovar, where the [[Battle of Vukovar|battle to control the city]] was in progress.<ref>{{harvnb|Delo|14 October 1991}}</ref>

===November===
After a period of siege with little or no activity, the JNA forces in "Logori<U+0161>te" barracks in Karlovac area broke through the blockade towards the JNA-held territory to the east of the city on 4&ndash;6 November. Even though the Croatian forces besieging the barracks were more numerous, the JNA had superiority in armour and artillery supporting the operation.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2011|p=477}}</ref> After it was abandoned by the JNA, the barracks still contained weapons which were taken away by the Croatian troops until November 13.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2011|pp=472<U+2013>473}}</ref> The [[Croatian Army]] (''Hrvatska vojska'' &ndash; HV), as the ZNG was renamed in early November, captured "Jamadol" barracks and storage facility in Karlovac on 4 November, while the fighting around the "Logori<U+0161>te" was in progress,<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2011|p=476}}</ref> and the following day, the HV captured JNA barracks and several weapons storage facilities in [[Delnice]].<ref>{{harvnb|Delnice|6 November 2011}}</ref> The attacks were ordered to capture ammunition needed by the HV as its stockpile was running low.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2011|p=461}}</ref>

On 8 November, [[Davorin Rudolf]], representing Croatian authorities, and the JNA [[Lieutenant Colonel General]] [[Marijan <U+010C>ad]], commanding officer of the 13th (Rijeka) Corps, made an agreement to evacuate the corps personnel and equipment from Croatia. The agreement, made after negotiations supervised and supported by the [[European Community Monitor Mission]] (ECMM) would later serve as a model for subsequent similar agreements elsewhere in Croatia.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|loc=note 85}}</ref> <U+010C>ad made the agreement at his own initiative, with support of the JNA Fifth Military District, after receiving an order from the [[Chief of the General Staff (Yugoslavia)|JNA Chief of Staff]] [[Colonel General]] [[Blagoje Ad<U+017E>i<U+0107>]] to destroy the JNA facilities in Rijeka and attack industrial plants and infrastructure in or near the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Novosti|14 May 2010}}</ref> The agreement was not affected by the HV capture of "Draga" barracks and weapons stored there on 9 November. The JNA 13th (Rijeka) Corps started to evacuate by sea to [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] ports on 18 November.<ref name=NL10/>

Following negotiations, the JNA evacuated [[Jastrebarsko]] barracks on 13 November. The garrison left, under ECMM escort, to Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>{{harvnb|Radio Jaska|13 November 2010}}</ref> The next day, an agreement was made in village of <U+017D>itni<U+0107> near [[Drni<U+0161>]] regarding evacuation of the JNA from <U+0160>ibenik.<ref name=Brigovic436>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|p=436}}</ref> Yugoslav Navy bombardment of Split, <U+0160>olta and Bra<U+010D> of 15 November, in response to loss of ''Mukos'' (P<U+010C>-176) patrol boat, and the subsequent [[Battle of the Dalmatian channels]] appeared to have derailed the <U+017D>itni<U+0107> agreement.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|p=437}}</ref>

Another agreement was signed in <U+017D>itni<U+0107> on 21 November by Rudolf and the JNA Maritime-Military District commanding officer, [[Major General]] Nikola Mladeni<U+0107> regarding evacuation of the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy from the <U+0160>ibenik&ndash;Split area and surrender of the confiscated TO weapons stored there. It was followed by another agreement to the same effect in Split two days later by Mladeni<U+0107> and Croatian [[Admiral]] [[Sveto Letica]], defining that the pullout should be completed within 30 days. The agreement also provided for a cease-fire in the northern Dalmatia and lifting of Yugoslav Navy blockade of the Croatian coast. The agreement did not include evacuation of the Yugoslav Navy from its bases on the islands of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] and [[Lastovo]] though.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|pp=438<U+2013>439}}</ref> Throughout the process, tensions remained high, and the JNA made contingency plans to break through from Knin to <U+0160>ibenik and Split and relieve siege of its forces there&mdash;[[codename]]d Operation Coast-91 (''Operacija Obala-91'') and Operation Hurricane-91 (''Operacija Orkan-91'') respectively.<ref name=Brigovic436/>

On 22 November, Croatian authorities and the JNA signed an agreement on evacuation of all remaining JNA forces from Croatia. The agreement was signed in Zagreb, by HV [[Colonel]] [[Imra Agoti<U+0107>]] and Lieutenant Colonel General [[Andrija Ra<U+0161>eta]] in presence of the ECMM monitors. The agreement was confirmed the next day in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], when the [[Vance plan#Geneva Accord|Geneva Accord]] was signed by Tu<U+0111>man, Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> and the Yugoslav defence minister, JNA General [[Veljko Kadijevi<U+0107>]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|p=440}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The ZNG quickly captured isolated JNA facilities and the depots, as well as several major posts, seizing large quantities of weapons. Those included the entire stocks of the JNA 32nd (Vara<U+017E>din) Corps and nearly all the weapons previously confiscated from the Croatia's TO.<ref name=BB95/> The JNA lost control of eight brigades, including one armoured and two mechanized brigades, and three artillery regiments, while additional forces in the JNA Fifth Military District and the Military-Maritime District remained pinned down by the blockade.<ref name=BB96>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=96}}</ref> Significance of the Battle of the Barracks was reinforced by introduction of a [[United Nations]] (UN) [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 713|arms embargo]] on 25 September.<ref>{{harvnb|The Independent|10 October 1992}}</ref> The Battle of the Barracks resulted in a very large increase of ZNG/HV capabilities&mdash;allowing complete arming of its existing units, raising of additional 40&ndash;42 brigades and fielding 200,000 troops in addition to 40,000 police by the end of the year.<ref name=BB96/> In the battle, the ZNG/HV captured 250 tanks, 400&ndash;500 heavy artillery pieces, 180,000 small arms and 2&nbsp;million tonnes of ammunition. In addition, 3,000 officers left the JNA and joined the HV.<ref>{{harvnb|Oberschall|2007|p=107}}</ref>

While there are is no information on the total number of troops or casualties involved on either side, the JNA garrisons in Croatia were significantly undermanned at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2002|p=68}}</ref> The JNA [[order of battle]] developed in 1980s specified a handful of battalions at full [[combat readiness]] in Croatia. Those were elements of the 140th Mechanised Brigade in Zagreb, the 31st Armoured Brigade in [[Dugo Selo]], just to the east of Zagreb, the 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade in Osijek, the 11th Marine Infantry Brigade in <U+0160>ibenik and the 139th Marine Infantry Brigade in Pula.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2003|loc=note 20}}</ref> In 1990, the "A" classification, requiring 60&ndash;100% troop levels,<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2003|loc=note 21}}</ref> was assigned to the 4th Armoured Brigade in Jastrebarsko, a battalion of the 622nd Motorised Brigade in [[Petrinja]],<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2003|p=44}}</ref> the 13th Proletarian Motorised Brigade in Rijeka, and the 265th Mechanised Brigade in Bjelovar and Koprivnica.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2003|pp=41<U+2013>42}}</ref> The 221st Motorised Brigade, based in Knin was reinforced with "A" class armoured and mechanised battalions.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2003|pp=42<U+2013>43}}</ref> In addition, an armoured battalion was added to the 622nd Mechanised Brigade, and a mechanised battalion to JNA garrisons in Vinkovci and Vukovar each in May 1991.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2005|p=302}}</ref> Likewise, Croatian forces were strained between the blockade and manning the positions held against the JNA and Croatian Serb militias elsewhere.<ref name=Brigovic425/> Surrendered JNA troops were either transported to Serbia, exchanged for [[prisoners of war]] captured elsewhere, or provided civilian clothing and released.<ref>{{harvnb|Hrastovi<U+0107>|2006|p=130}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Karaula|2007|p=22}}</ref>

Both in 1991 and years later, <U+0160>pegelj criticised Tu<U+0111>man's decision to disregard his advice to attack the JNA barracks earlier than September&mdash;specifically during the Ten-Day War in Slovenia in June&ndash;July 1991. He argued that an earlier move, preempting deterioration of strategic situation in Croatia, would serve Croatian defensive needs the best. Furthermore, he claimed that the JNA would be unable to respond in force because it would need two months to mobilise required forces and that all prerequisites for a [[decisive victory]] against the JNA were met.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2005|pp=124<U+2013>125}}</ref> Tus thought that Tu<U+0111>man kept postponing the blockade because of the international community exerted a pressure against confrontation with the JNA,<ref>{{harvnb|Sadkovich|2008|p=191}}</ref> while [[Zdravko Tomac]], deputy [[Prime Minister of Croatia|prime minister]] of a [[national unity government]] at the time, and later an opposition leader, stated that while <U+0160>pegelj's view was militarily correct, Tu<U+0111>man's position was politically better.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadkovich|2008|loc=note 42}}</ref> Kadijevi<U+0107> conversely claimed that the JNA would have fared better if Croatian forces confronted it earlier on because JNA capabilities declined during the summer of 1991.<ref>{{harvnb|Kadijevi<U+0107>|1993|p=129}}</ref>

===Vance plan===
{{main|Vance plan}}
The JNA campaign in Croatia ended in a stalemate, leading the belligerents to accept an internationally supervised ceasefire,<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=108}}</ref> formulated as the [[Vance plan]]&mdash;a result of a diplomatic mission by the [[Special Envoy]] of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Cyrus Vance]], aided by United States diplomat [[Herbert Okun]],<ref>{{harvnb|Armatta|2010|pp=194<U+2013>196}}</ref> and [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations]] for Special Political Affairs [[Marrack Goulding]],<ref name=Trbovich299>{{harvnb|Trbovich|2008|p=299}}</ref> to [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] aimed at a negotiated end of hostilities in Croatia. The plan proposed a ceasefire, the protection of civilians in specific areas designated as [[United Nations Protected Area (UNPROFOR)|UN Protected Areas]] and deployment of a UN force to Croatia. The Vance plan provided for the end of the Croatian blockade of the JNA barracks, the withdrawal of all JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of delivery of humanitarian aid.<ref name=Armatta196>{{harvnb|Armatta|2010|p=196}}</ref> The parties to the accord also agreed to the deployment of a [[UNPROFOR|UN peacekeeping mission in Croatia]], later initiated through the subsequent [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 721]] of 27 November.<ref name=Trbovich299/>  As a consequence of organizational problems and breaches of the last ceasefire agreement, the UN peacekeepers only started to deploy on 8 March 1992.<ref>{{harvnb|Trbovich|2008|p=300}}</ref>

===Evacuation of the JNA===
The JNA continued to evacuate following the Geneva Accord. The remaining seven JNA facilities in Rijeka area were evacuated throughout November, and the last barracks evacuated were those in [[Trsat]] on 10 December.<ref name=NL10/> In <U+0160>ibenik, the JNA evacuated two barracks and four depots from 25 November until 24 December, turning the confiscated Croatian TO weapons over to the HV on 10 December&mdash;but the weapons remained in a sealed storage under ECMM supervision until 25 December, as required by the <U+017D>itni<U+0107> agreement. The bulk of the evacuation took place by rail via Knin, and a part of the force was moved by sea to Montenegro. The evacuation agreement required, as in case of Zadar evacuation, removal of the evacuated units from Croatian soil, but the JNA fulfilled that commitment only in a part.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|pp=440<U+2013>441}}</ref> The "Divulje" base of the JNA near [[Trogir]] started to evacuate by sea on 4 December, after an additional agreement signed by Rudolf and Mladeni<U+0107> regulating surrender of the TO weapons to the HV and evacuation from "Lora" naval base in Split.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|pp=444<U+2013>445}}</ref>

The evacuation was halted once again when it was determined that some of the TO weapons are missing from the JNA facilities in Split. The issue was resolved through an agreement of 18 December made between Ra<U+0161>eta and Agoti<U+0107>, stipulating that the JNA would provide the HV with the missing weapons from its own stocks, and the evacuation resumed. Since the JNA did not have sufficient weapons to achieve that in Split, a Yugoslav Navy ship delivered {{convert|250|t|abbr=off}} of weapons and ammunition from [[Kumbor]] in Montenegro to Split on 1 January 1992.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|pp=448<U+2013>449}}</ref> The last JNA forces left the area of Split on 4 January.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|p=449}}</ref>

Elsewhere in Croatia, the JNA also evacuated its facilities. Pullout from "Mar<U+0161>al Tito" and "Kerestinec" barracks in Zagreb started on 30 November,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|30 November 1991}}</ref> and was completed by the end of 1991.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|Mikulan|2006|p=51}}</ref> [[Istria]] was evacuated by the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy on 15 December, turning over the Croatian TO weapons to the HV. Quantity of the TO weapons turned over in Istria, where the JNA evacuated 78 facilities, was sufficient to arm two combat brigades.<ref>{{harvnb|Glas Istre|15 December 2012}}</ref> In December 1991, only minor clashes occurred around the JNA facilities that were still under the HV blockade, including a minor and unsuccessful HV attack on "Meku<U+0161>je" barracks in Karlovac.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2012|p=109}}</ref> Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment,<ref name=Armatta196/> the JNA stayed behind for seven to eight months.<ref name=Armatta197>{{harvnb|Armatta|2010|p=197}}</ref> When its troops eventually pulled out from Croatia, JNA left their equipment to the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]],<ref name=Armatta197/> established in the JNA-held areas of Croatia on 19 December.<ref>{{harvnb|Ahrens|2007|p=110}}</ref> The JNA and the Yugoslav Navy kept their bases on Vis and Lastovo until early June 1992 before pulling out unilaterally.<ref>{{harvnb|Bethlehem|Weller|1997|p=542}}</ref> The JNA maintained positions near [[Dubrovnik]] until July,<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=157<U+2013>158}}</ref> while the naval blockade of the city was lifted on 26 May 1992.<ref>{{harvnb|Jelavi<U+0107>|2010|p=178}}</ref>

==War crimes==
Croatian authorities charged deputy head of the Bjelovar police Operations department and three special police force members with death of five JNA prisoners and shooting of a civilian in the aftermath of the Bjelovar barracks surrender. They were acquitted after 12 years of legal proceedings, after the [[Supreme Court of Croatia|Supreme Court]] ordered their trial repeated twice.<ref>{{harvnb|Novi list|6 July 2012}}</ref> Head of Bjelovar crisis centre was also charged with war crimes in 2012, but {{as of|2013|lc=yes}} his trial is still pending.<ref>{{harvnb|Ve<U+010D>ernji list|15 November 2010}}</ref> Croatia also charged numerous JNA officers who held posts in the blockaded garrisons. In Osijek alone, 13 JNA officers were charged with war crimes against civilian population, including causing death of 307 and severe injuries to 171 persons, but none were arrested {{as of|2013|lc=yes}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Jutarnji list|17 November 2008}}</ref>

There were war crime charges brought against JNA commander of the 32nd (Vara<U+017E>din) Corps, General [[Vladimir Trifunovi<U+0107>]]. He was charged by Croatia with deaths of six and wounding of 37 people. After a trial [[in absentia]], he was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1991.<ref name=VL-Trifunovic-HR>{{harvnb|Ve<U+010D>ernji list|9 April 2013}}</ref> Three years later, in 1994, Trifunovi<U+0107> was charged in Yugoslavia with treason because he surrendered the entire JNA corps to the ZNG. He was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison. In early 1996, Trifunovi<U+0107> was pardoned and released,<ref>{{harvnb|Nacional|21 October 2003}}</ref> and the Yugoslav authorities paid him 62,000 [[Euro]] compensation for spending nearly two years in a prison.<ref>{{harvnb|Ve<U+010D>ernji list|10 May 2011}}</ref> In 2013, Trifunovi<U+0107> formally requested re-trial in Croatia.<ref name=VL-Trifunovic-HR/>
