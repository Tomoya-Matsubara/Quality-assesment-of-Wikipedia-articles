On January 19, 2012 at an education-focused special event in New York City, Apple announced the free release of iBooks 2, which can operate in landscape mode and allows for interactive reading. In addition, a new application, [[iBooks Author]], was announced for the [[Mac App Store]], allowing anyone to create interactive textbooks for reading in iBooks; and the [[#iBookstore|iBookstore]] was expanded with a [[textbook]] category.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399075,00.asp|title = Apple Targets Educators Via iBooks 2, iBooks Author, iTunes U App|author = Chloe Albanesius|publisher = PCMag.com|date = January 19, 2012<!-- 11:32am EST-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57360688-37/apple-unveils-ibooks-2-for-digital-textbooks-self-pub-app-live-blog/|title = Apple unveils iBooks 2 for digital textbooks, self-pub app (live blog)|author = Josh Lowensohn|date = January 19, 2012<!-- 8:20 AM PST-->|publisher = CNET}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:IBooks user-interface on the iPhone and iPod Touch (screenshot).png|thumb|The iBooks user interface on the iPhone and iPod touch.]]

iBooks was announced alongside the iPad at a press conference in January 2010. The store itself, however, was released in America three days before the iPad with the introduction of iTunes 9.1.  This was supposedly to prevent too much traffic on Apple's servers, as they have been overloaded with previous releases of the iPhone. On the day of its launch, on 31 March 2010, the iBookstore collection comprised some 60,000 titles.<ref>{{cite web|last=King|first=Sammy|title=Survey of Kindle, Nook, iPad, Sony and OverDrive eBook Store Collection Size|url=http://www.ebookreaderguide.com/2011/03/13/kindle-nookcolor-ipad2-sony-overdrive-which-ebookstore-has-most-ebook-titles/|publisher=eBookReaderGuide.com|accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>

On April 8, 2010, Apple announced that iBooks would be updated to support the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] with [[iOS]] 4.  As a result, iBooks will not be supported on first-generation iPhones and iPod Touches.<ref name="4.0">{{cite web|title=Get a sneak peak into the future of iPhone OS.|publisher=Apple|date=2010-04-08|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5oqYO6thc|archivedate=2010-04-08}}</ref>

On June 8, 2010 at the WWDC Keynote it was announced that iBooks would be updated that month to read PDF files as well as have the ability to annotate both [[PDFs]] and eBooks.

As of July 1, Apple expanded iBooks availability to Canada.

Upon its release for older devices running iOS 4, such as the [[iPhone 3GS]] and [[iPod Touch]], iBooks received criticism for its slow performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=iBooks on iPhone 3GS&nbsp;<U+2014> app review|url=http://www.tipb.com/2010/06/21/ibooks-on-iphone-3gs-app-review/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobiputing.com/2010/06/apple-ibooks-now-available-for-iphone-ipod-touch/ |title=Apple iBooks now available for iPhone, iPod touch |publisher=Mobiputing.com |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}</ref> However, a July 19 update from Apple offered several improvements.<ref>{{cite web|author=balandin |url=http://www.iphoneheat.com/2010/07/download-ibooks-1-1-1-iphone-ipad/ |title=Download iBooks 1.1.1 for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch |publisher=iPhoneHeat |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}</ref>

On 27 September 2011, Apple expanded the premium store to the Republic of Ireland.

On January 19, 2012, Apple announced the release of the iBooks 2 app, allowing users to purchase and download [[textbooks]] to the iPad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/01/19Apple-Reinvents-Textbooks-with-iBooks-2-for-iPad.html |title=Apple Reinvents Textbooks with iBooks 2 for iPad |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> The new app will support digital textbooks that can display interactive diagrams, audio and video on the [[iPad]].<ref>Brian Chen and Nick Wingfield, The New York Times.

Retrieved January 19, 2012.</ref> Apple also released a free tool called [[iBooks Author]]. The software allows users to create these interactive textbooks themselves.

On 23 October 2012, Apple announced iBooks 3.

The [[USA|US]], [[UK]], Canada, Australia and Ireland are some of the only countries that have premium iBookstore stores. On 1 January 2013, [[Nikkei]] reported that Apple is preparing to lauch the premium iBookstore store to Japan.

== Features ==
[[File:1st-Gen-iPad-WiFi-iBooks.jpg|thumb|The iPad displaying an e-book on iBooks.]]

As of version 3, iBooks renders text written in 18 different languages. Users of the application are able to change the font and text size displayed. Available English fonts are [[Baskerville]], [[Cochin (typeface)|Cochin]], [[Georgia (typeface)|Georgia]], [[Palatino]], [[Times New Roman]],  [[Verdana]], Athelas, Charter, Iowan and Seravek.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple iPad Typography: Fonts We Actually Want|first=Joel|last=Friedlander|publisher=TheBookDesigner.com|date=2010-03-01|url=http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2010/03/apple-ipad-typography-fonts-we-actually-want/}}</ref>

Users can adjust screen brightness from within the application, with greater range than available from the Settings app and the multitasking bar.

Words can be selected and searched throughout the book. Definitions of words can also be found upon clicking on the word and selecting 'define' which will give the reader a brief description of what the word means and if there isn't a definition available, the reader can opt to either search on Wikipedia or the web for a definition, an option available even if there is a definition for the word. Readers can also highlight passages and when this is done, the part of the
Ebook which deals with the chapters and notes will automatically save the words or sentences which were highlighted, as well as revealing any notes made after highlighting a certain passage, another feature.

There are three viewing themes to choose from, available for all books except PDFs. The themes are:<ref>[http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/ Built-In Apps: iBooks.] Apple.

* '''Sepia''': [[Sepia (color)|sepia]] text on an off-white background
* '''Night''': light grey text on a black background

There are three page layouts: Book, Full Screen, and Scroll. In Book or Full Screen layout, pages are turned by tapping or dragging the page, animated to imitate the appearance of a paper book. In Scroll, there is no page turning, and the book appears as continuous text, read vertically like a web browser.

Until May 2011<ref>{{cite web|title=Winnie the Pooh goes MIA from NZ iBookstore, demands money from other territories|url=http://www.iphonewzealand.co.nz/2011/all/winnie-the-pooh-goes-mia-from-nz-ibookstore-demands-money-from-other-territories/}}. iPhonewzealand. 26 May 2011</ref> each copy of iBooks used to provide a free copy of ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'', the 1926 book by [[A. A. Milne]], in order to get the user's library started.

=== Formats ===
The supported [[e-book]] formats by iBooks are [[ePub]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4059 |title=iBooks: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Apple |date=June 8, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-27}}</ref> As of version 2.0, iBooks also supports a proprietary iBook format (IBA), generated with the [[iBooks Author]] tool. This format is based upon the ePub format but depends upon custom widget code in the iBooks app to function.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.macrumors.com/2012/01/19/new-ibooks-not-technically-in-epub-format/ | title=New ibooks not technically in epub format| publisher=MacRumors  | author=Arnold Kim | date=January 19, 2012}}</ref>

== iBookstore ==
The iBookstore is an [[ePub]] content sales and delivery system that delivers ebooks to any [[iDevice|iOS device]] (namely the iPad, [[iPhone]], and [[iPod Touch]]) running [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] 4.x&nbsp;<U+2013> 6.x. It does not currently support either the downloading or reading of [[IBooks#Trademark_dispute|iBooks]] directly on any type of computer; whether Mac, Windows, or Linux.

The iBooks shelf turns around to reveal the iBookstore. From here users can purchase various books from Apple. iBooks can sync between devices, so one could start reading a [[book]] on one device and continue from where one left-off on another.<ref>[http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/ibooks.html "Apple - iPad - Buy and read books like never before"], ''Apple.com'', accessed December 3, 2010.</ref>

Prior to the unveiling of the iPad, publishers [[Penguin Books]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Simon & Schuster]], [[Macmillan Publishers]], and [[Hachette Book Group USA]] committed to producing content for the iBookstore. Additional publishers were invited to participate on the day of the product announcement, January 27, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/01/28/ipad_ibooks_app_us_only_mcgraw_hill_absent_from_apple_event.html|title=iPad iBooks app US-only, McGraw-Hill absent from Apple event|work=[[AppleInsider]]|date=January 28, 2010|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}</ref> The iBookstore also provides access to the 30,000+ free books available from [[Project Gutenberg]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/03/25/apple_loads_up_new_ibooks_store_with_free_public_domain_ipad_titles.html |title=Apple pre-loading iBook Store with 30,000 free eBooks |publisher=Appleinsider.com |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}</ref> and it provides content channeled through [[Smashwords]], allowing independent authors and publishers to self-publish.<ref>{{cite web|last=Foresman |first=Chris |url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/03/self-published-authors-to-get-in-ibookstore-via-smashwords.ars |title=Self-published authors to get in iBookstore via Smashwords |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}</ref>

The day before the [[iPad]] event, [[Harold McGraw III|Terry McGraw]], the CEO of [[McGraw-Hill]], appeared to divulge information to Erin Burnett on [[CNBC]] about the upcoming iPad release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1396376379&play=1 |title=McGraw-Hill's Q4 Earnings |publisher=CNBC |date=2001-09-16 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}</ref> This was quickly picked up and disseminated by rumor sites and eventually mainstream media outlets as revelation of features of the iPad. McGraw Hill was not included in the iPad presentation at the Apple media event and there was speculation that the exclusion was in response to this release of information.<ref>[http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/specialevent0110/ Apple Special Event January 2010] [[Apple Inc.]] January 27, 2010</ref> However, McGraw-Hill has stated that the information disclosed by McGraw was not privileged, and that the company had not intended to participate in the event.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20100128/mcgraw-hill-no-we-didnt-confirm-ipad-launch/| title = McGraw-Hill: We Didn<U+2019>t Get Booted From the iPad Launch, Because We Weren<U+2019>t Part of It| author =  John Paczkowski| authorlink = John Paczkowski| date = January 28, 2010| accessdate = January 28, 2010| work = All Things Digital}}</ref>

In 2011, an Apple spokesperson announced that "We are now requiring that if an app offers customers the ability to purchase books outside of the app, that the same option is also available to customers from within the app with in-app purchase."<ref>Yarow, Jay. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/02/01/businessinsider-apple-kindle-2011-2.DTL "Apple Just Declared War On Amazon Kindle."] ''Business Insider'', 1 February 2011.</ref> Due to the 30% revenue share that Apple receives from the in-app purchase mechanism, the financial viability of competing bookstore apps run by other book retailers is uncertain, even though in many countries, the iBookstore still does not provide consumers access to any books at all except for free out-of-copyright works.

== Controversy ==

Some have claimed that the iBooks interface is a near exact replica of Classics by Andrew Kaz & Phill Ryu, released over a year prior and even featured in Apple's own TV commercials. Apple has made no acknowledgement of this.<ref>Chen, Brian. [http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/01/apple-tablet-ebook/ "Apple<U+2019>s Tablet E-Book App Rips off Indie Dev<U+2019>s Creation"] "Wired", 27 January 2010</ref><ref>Carnoy, David.

Documents created by [[iBooks Author]] in the .ibooks format may be sold for a fee only if they are accepted by and exclusively distributed by Apple.<ref name="applefaq">{{cite web | url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5071#2 | title=Apple iBooks Author FAQ| publisher=Apple | date=March 23, 2012| accessdate=April 26, 2012 | author=Apple }}</ref><ref name="latimesrelease">{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2012/01/apple-ibooks-author.html | title=If you publish with iBooks Author, does Apple 'own' you? | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=January 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name="">{{cite web | url=http://www.techradar.com/news/software/hands-on-ibooks-author-review-1056368 | title=Hands on: iBooks Author review | publisher=TechRadar.com | date=2012-01-20 | author=Gary Marshall}}</ref><ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/productivity_apps/232500227 Apple's iBooks Author Software: Just Say No - Software]</ref> These restrictions do not apply to documents created in other formats like exported as PDF or text files. As Apple officially mentions the ePub format,<ref name=applefaq /> documents renamed to .epub may not be affected. But this is left unclear and such documents are not fully compatible with the EPUB standard.

== Trademark dispute ==

In June 2011, Apple was sued by New York publisher John T. Colby over the use of the term "iBook".
<ref>{{cite web|url = http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/06/apples-ibooks-trademark-under-fire-from-independent-book-publisher.ars
|
title = Apple iBooks trademark under fire from independent book publisher

Colby claims to be the owner of a trademark on the term 'ibooks' as applied to published books, after acquiring the assets of publisher [[Byron Preiss]], who had published a series of sci-fi and fantasy books under the term.  Apple had previously used the term '[[iBook]]' to refer to a line of laptops that it sold until 2006, but Colby claims exclusive right to the term as applied to published books, including e-books.  Apple began using the term 'iBooks' in 2010 to refer to e-books sold for the iPad.  Byron Preiss published more than 1,000 books under the "ibooks" brand starting in 1999.<ref name="cnet2011jun">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20071694-37/apple-sued-over-its-use-of-ibook/?tag=mncol;txt | title=Apple sued over its use of 'iBook' | publisher=CNET.com | date=June 16, 2011 | accessdate=January 19, 2012 | author=Musil, Steven}}</ref>
