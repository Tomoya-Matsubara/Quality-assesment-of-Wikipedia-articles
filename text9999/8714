'''Robert George Dylan Willis''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]], born '''Robert George Willis''' and known as '''Bob Willis''' (30 May 1949 &ndash; ) is a former [[England|English]] [[cricket]]er who played for [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]], [[Northerns cricket team|Northern Transvaal]] and [[English cricket team|England]]. A right-handed and aggressive [[fast bowler]] with a notably long run-up, Willis spearheaded several England bowling attacks between 1971 and 1984, across 90 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] in which he took 325 wickets at 25.20 [[bowling average|runs per wicket]], at the time second only to [[Dennis Lillee]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Playfair Cricket Annual|publisher=Queen Anne Press|date=1985|page=228|isbn=0356107418}}</ref> He is currently behind only [[Ian Botham]] as  England's leading wicket taker. He took 899 [[first-class cricket|first-class wickets]] overall, although from 1975 onwards he bowled with constant pain, having had surgery on both knees. He nevertheless continued to find success, taking a career best eight wickets for 43 runs in the [[1981 Ashes series]] against [[Australia cricket team|Australia]], one of the all-time best Test bowling performances, in the famous 1981 Ashes series against Australia.<ref name="scattered stumps and hexed batsmen">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus/content/story/214570.html|title=Scattered stumps and hexed batsmen|last=Miller|first=Andrew|date=July 29, 2009|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> He was ''Wisden'' Cricketer of the Year for 1978.<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154492.html|title=Bob Willis - Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1978|work=Wisden Almanack|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref>

In addition to the Test arena, Willis played 64 [[One Day International]] matches for his country, taking 80 wickets, and was a prolific [[List-A]] (one day) cricketer with 421 wickets overall at 20.18. With the bat, Willis made little impression as a tail-ender with a best Test score of 28 [[Not out (cricket)|not-out]] (*); however, he managed two half-centuries at first-class level and for a time held a record number of Test not-outs.<ref name="an assessment" /> Willis captained the England team in 18 Tests and 28 ODI matches between June 1982 and March 1984. Under Willis' captaincy England won seven, lost five and drew six Tests, and won 16 of the ODIs. Botham recalled Willis as "a tremendous trier.. a great team-man and an inspiration",<ref name="botham370">Botham, p. 370.</ref> as well as the "only world-class fast bowler in my time as an England player."<ref name="botham376">Botham, p. 376.</ref> The editor of [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|''Wisden'']] wrote of him in similar terms: "His indomitable service to England is handsomely reflected in his great collection of Test wickets. Although often beset with aches and pains, he never spared himself when bowling for his country."<ref>{{cite book|title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|date=1985|page=51|isbn=0947766006}}</ref> 

Retiring in 1984 following a Test series against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], Willis found later work as a commentator with [[Sky Sports]]. He formed a noted commentary partnership with Botham; however, Willis' relatively low-key style, in contrast to Botham's ebullience, meant that from 2006 onwards Willis tended to be used as a second string commentator.<ref name="cricpro">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/22462.html|title=Player Profile: Bob Willis|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref><ref name="zombies">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/story/216377.html|title='Death seems a better option than listening to those zombies'|date=August 18, 2005|publisher=CricInfo and ''Wisden''|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> He remains an often-heard broadcaster, a published writer and an occasional critic of the modern game.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buckland|first=William|title=Pommies: England Cricket Through An Australian Lens|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|date=2008|pages=179|isbn=1906510326}}</ref><ref name="Ex-players call for reform">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/2420392/Ex-players-call-for-reform.html|title=Ex-players call for reform|last=Biggs|first=Simon|date=September 3, 2003|work=Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref>

==Early life==

Willis was born in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[Durham]],<ref name="cricpro" /> and grew up in the [[Surrey]] village of [[Stoke d'Abernon]] near [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]], having moved there at the age of six.<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" /> His father was an employee of the [[BBC]], and Willis had an elder brother named David with whom he played cricket in the garden, and an elder sister.<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" /> He adopted his third name "Dylan" by [[deed poll]] in honour of [[United States|American]] musician [[Bob Dylan]], of whom he is a fan.<ref name="superstitions: bob willis">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/cricket/article5576716.ece|title=Superstitions: Bob Willis, former cricketer|date=January 24, 2009|work=The Times|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Willis was educated at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]],<ref name="cricpro" /> playing  his early cricket for Stoke d'Abernon Cricket Club, where he later became Vice President and Life Member,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sdacc.play-cricket.com/home/aboutUs.asp|title=Membership Lists|publisher=Stoke D'Abernon Cricket Club|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> and two seasons for the Cobham Avorians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avorianscc.co.uk/history.htm|title=History of the Avorians  |publisher=Cobham Avorians Cricket Club|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> He was also an avid schoolboy footballer,<ref name="superstitions: bob willis" /> but was not a natural athlete and loathed [[Rugby football|rugby]], which was the school's dominant sport. Willis recalled in 2009 that during his school years "in the winter when the muscled brethren were playing, I used to play football with the school old boys. This taught me how to drink cider and vomit it up on Surbiton station, and other life-altering lessons."<ref name="fat lady sing">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/page2/content/story/423583.html|title=Watching the fat lady sing|last=John|first=Emma|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Willis' bowling potential was rewarded with selection for Surrey Schools and Surrey Colts, under the directorship of [[Watcyn Evans]], who would become a close friend.<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" />

==Playing career==
===County debut===

In 1968, Willis accepted an invitation to join Middlesex and Surrey Young Cricketers on tour in Pakistan, and used this opportunity to further hone his skills.<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" /> Upon his return he made early appearances for Surrey's Second XI, his first being on 26 August against [[Worcestershire CCC|Worcestershire]]'s Seconds. Willis, 19 years of age, took one wicket for 48 runs in the first innings, and bowled four wicketless overs in the second. He was not called on to bat at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/29/29725.html|title=Worcestershire Second XI v Surrey Second XI - Second Eleven Championship 1968|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Two days later, he faced Glamorgan and took three wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/29/29733.html|title= Glamorgan Second XI v Surrey Second XI - Second Eleven Championship 1968|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> He played several further Second XI matches through May and June 1969,<ref name="2ndXI match list">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1366/Second_Eleven_Championship_Matches.html|title=Second Eleven Championship Matches played by Bob Willis|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> before his first-class debut on August 6.<ref name="fc match list">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1366/First-Class_Matches.html|title=First-Class Matches played by Bob Willis|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]] was touring England that season and had already beaten [[Warwickshire CCC|Warwickshire]]. Willis took three wickets for 13 runs from 13 overs in his first innings, and two for 37 in his second, to help Surrey to victory by an innings and 97 runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/30/30375.html|title=Surrey v Scotland - Scotland in England 1969|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Willis went on to take 22 first-class wickets that season at 17.22 from six matches,<ref name="First-class Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1366/f_Bowling_by_Season.html|title=First-class Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> placing him 15th in the national averages for that season's County Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/County_Championship_1969/Bowling_by_Average.html|title=Bowling in County Championship 1969 (Ordered by Average)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Surrey came third in the competition that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1969.html|title=County Championship 1969 Table|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Willis also played two List-A games, but took only one wicket at 52.00.<ref name="ListA Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1366/a_Bowling_by_Season.html|title=ListA Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref>

 | quote =Only Bob Willis' height ever encouraged any sort of belief that he would become an international fast bowler. His run-up was intimidating but slightly absurd... Yet irrespective of the low marks for aesthetic quality in his action, that long right arm, which came down and across at such an unlikely angle, propelled the ball at a hot pace, with steep bounce and unusually threatening movement in towards the batsman.<ref name="an assessment" />

Willis had thus earned a second season at Surrey, and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches, taking 40 first-class wickets at 28.37,<ref name="First-class Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis" /> and 31 one day wickets at 14.65.<ref name="ListA Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis" /> Surrey came fifth in the Championship that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1970.html|title=County Championship 1970 Table|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> He achieved a noteworthy performance in the [[Friends Provident Trophy|Gillette Cup]] quarter-final against Middlesex. In a high-scoring match, Surrey made 280 for the loss of five wickets. Middlesex appeared to be coasting to victory when they reached 240-3, but Willis turned the game, and they collapsed and finished on 272-9. Willis took 6-49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1971 edition|pages=704}}</ref> Despite this, Surrey's preference for [[Geoff Arnold]] and [[Robin Jackman]] kept Willis out of the side on occasions. He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for local football clubs. However, [[Ray Illingworth]] and [[Colin Cowdrey]], captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via [[telephone]] to ask him to travel to [[Australia]] and join the current England tour there.  Willis, who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited his call up to the influence of senior member of the touring party [[John Edrich]], Willis' long-term friend, mentor, and Surrey team-mate.<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" />

===International beginnings===

Willis joined [[English cricket team in Australia in 1970<U+2013>71|England's 1970-71 tour of Australia]]  as a replacement for the injured [[Alan Ward]], and played several warm-up matches for the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] in December. ''Wisden'' records that his "infectious enthusiasm and team spirit played no small part in Australia's downfall" as England won [[The Ashes]] in the subsequent Test series. Willis' first Test, on January 9, 1971 &ndash; the fourth Test of the series, played when the series stood level after two draws and an abandonment &ndash; saw him score 15 not out as England batted first and reached 332. In the Australian first innings he bowled an economical nine overs for 26 runs, while [[Derek Underwood]] took four wickets to reduce Australia to 236. Subsequently, an unbeaten 142* from [[Geoffrey Boycott]] set Australia 416 to win. With [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]] routing Australia with 7/40, Willis was only given three overs to bowl on a pitch "without pace",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150245.html|title=Boycott and Snow combine to bring England victory|date=January 14, 1971|work=Wisden|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> but he managed to take his first Test wicket &ndash; [[Ashley Mallett]], caught by [[Alan Knott]] for six.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63062.html|title=The 1970/71 Ashes - 4th Test  Australia v England |publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> 

Willis remained in the team for the fifth Test at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], and rewarded the selectors with 3/73 in the first innings and 1/42 in the second as the match was drawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63063.html|title=The Ashes 1970/71 - 5th Test  Australia v England |publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Of the final two matches, Willis took three wickets in the drawn [[Adelaide Oval]] Test,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63064.html|title=The Ashes 1970/71 - 6th Test  Australia v England |publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> and four more in the final match of the series, a victory at [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] which gave England a 2:0 series victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63065.html|title=The Ashes 1970/71 - 7th Test  Australia v England |publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Willis finished his first Test series with 12 wickets at 27.41, and had also taken several "crucial catches".<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" /> He was retained for the second match of the two-Test series against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in [[Auckland]] in March, where he took two wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63072.html|title=England in New Zealand Test Series 1971 - 2nd Test  New Zealand v England |publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref>

Willis returned in early 1971 to help Surrey win the 1971 County Championship title. However, friction was developing between the club and himself. During that season Willis took 31 Championship wickets at 28.83,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/County_Championship_1971/Bowling_by_Average.html|title=Bowling in County Championship 1971 (Ordered by Average)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> but found himself unable to accept the contract offered to him by the club. Though the county was reluctant to lose him, Willis sought another club. He took two wickets in his final match for Surrey against [[Hampshire CCC|Hampshire]] on September 11, 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/32/32034.html|title=Hampshire v Surrey - County Championship 1971|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> After turning down [[Leicestershire CCC|Leicestershire]] and [[Lancashire CCC|Lancashire]] he signed for [[Warwickshire CCC|Warwickshire]], for whom he had immediate success, with 25 wickets at 29.28, including one five-wicket haul (taking five wickets in one innings).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/County_Championship_1972/Bowling_by_Average.html|title=Bowling in County Championship 1972 (Ordered by Average)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Willis, who under rules then applying was banned from playing for his new county before July, helped Warwickshire win the 1972 Championship, thus achieving the unusual feat of winning the Championship in consecutive years with two different counties.<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" /> In his final match of the season, he took 8/44 to dismantle [[Derbyshire CCC|Derbyshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/32/32870.html|title=Warwickshire v Derbyshire - County Championship 1972|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> His new team won nine of their 20 matches, drew 11 and lost none.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1972.html|title=County Championship 1972 Table|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> He was not selected for the [[1972 Ashes series]] in England, and travelled to [[South Africa]] as part of [[Derrick Robins]]' invitation XI in January.<ref name="fc match list" /> On the tour Willis took 13 wickets from the six matches.<ref name="First-class Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis" />

Willis spent part of the 1973 season injured with one of what would become several recurring complaints.<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" /> He nevertheless managed 43 wickets in the Championship at 18.95,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/County_Championship_1973/Bowling_by_Average.html|title=Bowling in County Championship 1973 (Ordered by Average)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> though his injury barred him from all but one Test against the [[West Indies cricket team]]. The West Indies amassed 652/8 declared.

Willis then returned to England, to face [[India cricket team|India]] and [[Pakistan cricket team|Pakistan]], playing in one Test against each. Against India he took 4/64 &ndash; a career best against that team &ndash; and made a Test best 24 with the bat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/34/34267.html|title=England v India - India in British Isles 1974 (1st Test)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> Pakistan toured in early August, and Willis featured in one Test.

===Injury and operation===

Willis returned to England in January 1975 with a recurring knee injury which had caused him to collapse at a county game early that season, and underwent several operations to correct it. He had surgery on both knees, and suffered a post-operative [[blood clot]]. He was forced to use crutches for most of the season, and reflected in 1978 that it was "similar to a 50,000-mile service."<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" /> His recovery was particularly tortuous, requiring daily runs around the cricket field and an intensive gym program under the supervision of Dr. Arthur Jackson, an advocate of slow running therapy to build stamina.<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" /> He played no part in the international arena in 1975, and managed only four first-class appearances, though these returned a healthy 18 wickets at 18.77.<ref name="First-class Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis" /> He was not to return to the Test game until 1976, where he faced the West Indies in two matches in July and August.

That year, he had made a comfortable return to the county game from injury &ndash; taking 16 Championship wickets at 26.12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/County_Championship_1976/Bowling_by_Average.html|title=Bowling in County Championship 1976 (Ordered by Average)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> He had also scored a career best 43 with the bat.<ref name="First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Bob Willis">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1366/f_Batting_by_Season.html|title=First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Bob Willis|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> After coming fit from injury, Willis was brought into the squad for the fourth Test against the West Indies on July 22 as part of wholesale bowling changes that saw [[Brian Close]], Edrich, [[Mike Hendrick]], [[Mike Selvey]] and [[Pat Pocock]] replaced with [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]], Ward, [[Bob Woolmer]], [[David Steele (cricketer)|David Steele]] and Willis.

===Revival in India and the 1977 Ashes===

Over the winter of 1976/77, England toured India in a five Test series through December to February, and it proved to be a revival for Willis.

''Wisden'' noted Willis' achievements against Australia in 1977, stating that "the new-ball fire power of Bob Willis, which yielded 27 wickets, was of special significance in England's high summer of success. No England bowler of authentic speed can boast a comparable record in a home series against Australia".<ref name="wisden cricketer of the year" /> In continued: "It was singularly appropriate that team and personal triumph should go hand in hand, for few players have given such loyal and unstinted service to England as the wholehearted Willis... Happily determination is one virtue Willis does not lack, and his re-emergence as a top ranking fast bowler was well and truly deserved." Across all first-class matches that year, Willis had taken 65 wickets at 18.41, the most of any season of his career.<ref name="First-class Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis" /> His 35 List-A wickets was also the second highest he would achieve for a season behind the 45 of 1983.<ref name="ListA Bowling in Each Season by Bob Willis" /> ''Wisden'' also praised him for refusing to partake in [[Kerry Packer]]'s [[World Series cricket]], and proclaimed him a [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]] along with Botham, Hendrick, [[Alan Jones (cricketer)|Alan Jones]] and [[Ken McEwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/Overall/Wisden_Cricketers_of_the_Year.html|title=Wisden Cricketers of the Year|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref>

===1980, Australia and the West Indies===

The winter of 1979/80 and the followed summer saw difficult tours for Willis: the Benson and Hedges World Series Cup and a Test tour in Australia followed by a home series against the West Indies. Willis partook in all seven of England's matches for the World Series Cup, however he struggled with six wickets at 41.00.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Benson_and_Hedges_World_Series_Cup_1979-80/England_Bowling.html|title=Bowling for England Benson and Hedges World Series Cup 1979/80|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> England did secure the highest number of points however they were beaten in both finals by the West Indies.

Two ODI matches back in England commenced the West Indies tour, with Willis being included only in the team for the second match, here he took two wickets and two catches in a three-wicket England victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/40/40169.html|title=England v West Indies - Prudential Trophy 1980 (2nd ODI)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> Wills then faced the West Indies Test team across four matches, the first on June 5.

===1981 Ashes===
{{Main|Australian cricket team in England in 1981}}

Australia arrived in England for the 51st Ashes series in 1981. Willis, who was selected to play in all six Test matches, came into the series on a run of good county form. He had played four county matches, commencing with 5/61 against [[Yorkshire CCC|Yorkshire]] on May 6,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/41/41058.html|title=Warwickshire v Yorkshire - Schweppes County Championship 1981|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> and 3/58 against Lancashire on June 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/41/41232.html|title=Lancashire v Warwickshire - Schweppes County Championship 1981|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> The first Test took place at [[Trent Bridge]], [[Nottingham]], on June 18. England, batting first, were cut down for 185 all out thanks to four wickets for [[Terry Alderman]] and three a-piece for [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Rodney Hogg]]. Only [[Mike Gatting]] passed fifty, and Willis was dismissed for a first-ball [[duck (cricket)|duck]]. Willis, however, combined with Dilley, Hendrick and Botham to reduce Australia to 179 all out, with three wickets for Willis. England could not take advantage, however, as Lillee and Alderman shared the host nation's ten wickets equally between them to leave Australia only 132 to win. Dilley took four wickets and Willis snatched [[Graeme Wood]] for eight to reach 200 Test wickets,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/41/41274.html|title=England v Australia - Australia in British Isles 1981 (1st Test)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> however the tourists won the match with four wickets to space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63289.html|title=1981 Ashes 1st Test|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152211.html|title=1st Test report, 1981 Ashes|last=Whiting|first=Steve|date=June 21, 1981|work=Wisden|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref>

Willis, who was struggling for fitness and had a chest infection, was dropped from the side. He sat out a Warwickshire county match and after speaking to [[Alec Bedser]] was given back his place in the team on the condition that he played in a 40-over match, played a Second XI game, and bowled 12 overs in the nets.

The third Test &ndash; Willis' 60th &ndash; came on July 16,<ref name="scattered stumps and hexed batsmen" /> and England were able to level the series 1:1 thanks to Botham's Man of the Match winning seven wickets, century and half century. Willis bowled 30 wicketless overs in Australia's first innings, and made one one and two with the bat, before returning to bowl with Australia requiring 130 runs.

England then moved into the fourth Test 1:1 in the series. Again batting first, Alderman's five-for took England to 189 all out, with Willis making 13 runs. He then bowled a wicketless but "stormy" 19 overs "as if the devil were at his heels" and, after England had set Australia a final target of 151 runs, took two wickets which along with Botham's five-wicket haul dismissed the Australians for 121 and handed England a 29-run victory and a series lead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63292.html|title=4th Test 1981 Ashes|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152214.html|title=1981 Ashes 4th Test report|last=Hodgson|first=Derek|date=August 2, 1981|work=Wisden|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> Willis played for his county against Middlesex between the fourth and fifth Tests, taking one wicket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/41/41545.html|title=Middlesex v Warwickshire - Schweppes County Championship 1981|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref> He then rejoined his team for the fifth Test at [[Old Trafford cricket ground|Old Trafford]].

Another century from Botham took England to 404, setting the tourists 506 runs to win.

==Commentary==
After retiring from playing cricket, Willis established himself as a television commentator on [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]]. He began a television career in 1985, and was initially in partnership with Botham in the commentary box, "his laconic style did not suit all" and he was dropped from the "front-line commentary duties".<ref name="cricpro"/> Willis appeared on ''BBC TV Cricket'' between 1989 and 1999 as a summariser before joining [[Sky Sports]] in 2000. He also appeared on [[David Tomlinson]]'s ''[[This is Your Life]]'' in 1991, ''[[A Question of Sport]]'' in 2004 and ''[[20 to 1]]'' in 2005.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1303569/|title=Bob Willis Profile|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref>

Willis has continued to work for Sky Sports, largely commentating in the county game, where he has been vocal on the need for changes in English cricket, particularly through a group of former players known as the Cricket Reform Group.<ref name="Ex-players call for reform"/> He was critical of [[Michael Atherton]] during the England tour of Zimbabwe in 1997.<ref name=" Cricket: `We need to play better when we go abroad' ">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket-we-need-to-play-better-when-we-go-abroad-1281336.html|title= Cricket: 'We need to play better when we go abroad' |date=January 2, 1997|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref> In 2006 he criticised the then England coach [[Duncan Fletcher]]'s practices,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/272309.html|title=Willis attacks England's methods|date=December 12, 2006|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-30}}</ref> England's performance in the [[2006-07 Ashes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/275396.html|title=Former captains slam England|date=January 6, 2009|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-30}}</ref> and was vocal in calling for the retirement of out-of-form national captain [[Michael Vaughan]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/291056.html|title=Willis calls for Vaughan to be axed|date=April 18, 2007|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-10-30}}</ref>

Willis has attracted detractors due to his somewhat melancholy style. ''[[The Independent]]'' commentated on the 1995 [[Texaco Trophy]] that Willis had "trenchant content, dismal delivery. As a player Willis had trouble getting to sleep. As a commentator he struggles to stay awake. His voice remains on one note &ndash; the drone of your neighbour's mower."<ref name=" Botham will have to get better">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/botham-will-have-to-get-better-he-has-a-good-face-for-television-but-commentators-are-heard-not-seen-and-his-voice-is-not-so-compelling-1621929.html|title=Botham will have to get better.
