'''Edward Purcell''' (1689<U+2013>1740) was born in [[Westminster]], [[London]], the only surviving son of the [[United Kingdom|English]] [[Baroque]] master, [[Henry Purcell]]. When his mother Frances died in February 1706, she stated in her will, and apparently in accordance with her husband's wishes, that she had given him a good education.<ref name"Grove">Holman, Peter, and Thompson, Robert 'Edward Purcell' in ''Grove Music Online'' (ed. L. Macy), <http://www.grovemusic.com>, accessed 15 March 2008</ref> She also bequeathed to him music and instruments: "the organ, the double spinnet, the single spinnet"; possibly the instruments her husband had used.<ref name"Holman">Holman, Peter (1994) ''Henry Purcell'' (Series: Oxford Studies of Composers). Oxford: Oxford University Press. 98.</ref> 

Edward became organist of [[St Clement Eastcheap]], in [[London]] at the end of 1711, a position he retained for the rest of his life. He was unsuccessful in his attempts to succeed his uncle [[Daniel Purcell]] as organist of [[St Andrew, Holborn| St Andrew's, Holborn]], on 19 February 1718 and again on 3 April 1719.<ref name"Dawe">Dawe, Donovan 'Edward Purcell' in ''Organs and Organists of the City of London''.

He eventually became organist at [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]], on 8 July 1726, concurrent with his post at Eastcheap.<ref name"Dawe">Dawe, Donovan 'Edward Purcell' in ''Organs and Organists of the City of London''. Padstow: Dawe. 136</ref>  

In 1739, the year before his death, he was one of the founder-members of the London-based musicians' benevolent society then known as the Society of Musicians (later to become the [[Royal Society of Musicians]]).<ref name"Matthews">Matthews, Betty (1985) ''Members of the Royal Society of Musicians: 1738-1984''.

Edward Purcell published two songs, though the psalm chants often attributed to him seem to be by an earlier namesake, perhaps his uncle Edward.<ref name"Grove">Holman, Peter, and Thompson, Robert 'Edward Purcell' in ''Grove Music Online'' (ed.
