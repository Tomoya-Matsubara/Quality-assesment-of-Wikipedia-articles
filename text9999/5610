'''Michael Faraday''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ([[September 22]], [[1791]] <U+2013> [[August 25]], [[1867]]) was an [[England|English]] [[chemist]] and [[physicist]] (or ''[[natural philosopher]]'', in the [[terminology]] of that time) who contributed significantly to the fields of [[electromagnetism]] and [[electrochemistry]]. 

Faraday studied the [[magnetism|magnetic]] [[field (physics)|field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a DC [[electric current]], and established the basis for the magnetic field concept in physics. He discovered [[electromagnetic induction]], [[diamagnetism]] and [[electrolysis]]. He established that [[magnetism]] could affect [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]] and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena.<ref name="EncBrit">[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Michael_Faraday Michael Faraday] entry at the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica hosted by LovetoKnow  Retrieved January 2007.</ref> <ref name="IEEUK">[http://www.iee.org/TheIEE/Research/Archives/Histories&Biographies/Faraday.cfm Institution of Engineering and Technology, London] Archives , Michael Faraday</ref> 

His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology. 

As a chemist, Faraday discovered [[chemical substance]]s such as [[benzene]], invented an early form of the [[bunsen burner]] and the system of [[oxidation number]]s, and popularized terminology such as [[anode]], [[cathode]], [[electrode]], and [[ion]].  

Although he received little formal education and thus higher [[mathematics]] like calculus was always out of his reach, he went on to become one of the most influential [[scientist]]s in history. Some historians<ref>{{cite book | last =Russell | first = Colin | authorlink = | coauthors = | title= Michael Faraday: Physics and Faith | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2000 | location=New York | pages= | url = | doi = | id =  }}</ref> of science refer to him as the best [[experimentalist]] in the history of science.<ref>[http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/2006/10/25/gulp-ford251006.html "best [[experimentalist]] in the history of science."] Quoting Dr Peter Ford, from the University of Bath<U+2019>s Department of Physics . Accessed January 2007.</ref> It was largely due to his efforts that [[electricity]] became viable for use in technology. The [[SI]] unit of [[capacitance]], the [[farad]], is named after him, as is the  [[Faraday constant]], the charge on a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of [[electron]]s (about 96,485 [[coulomb]]s). [[Faraday's law of induction]] states that a [[magnetic field]] changing in time creates a proportional [[electromotive force]].

He was ''Fullerian Professor of Chemistry'' at the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]], the first, and most famous, holder of this position to which he was appointed for life.

Michael Faraday was born in [[Newington Butts]], near present-day [[Elephant and Castle]] in [[South London]], [[England]].His family was not well off. His father, James, was a blacksmith and a member of the [[Sandemanian]] sect of Christianity. James Faraday had come to London in the 1780s from North-West England. The young Michael Faraday, one of ten children, had the most basic of school educations, had to largely educate himself.<ref>"Michael Faraday." History of Science and Technology. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. Answers.com 04 Jun. 2007. http://www.answers.com/topic/michael-faraday</ref> At fourteen he became apprenticed to a local bookbinder and bookseller [[George Riebau]] and, during his seven-year apprenticeship, he read many books, including [[Isaac Watts]]' ''The Improvement of the Mind'', the principles and suggestions contained therein he enthusiastically implemented. He developed an interest in science and specifically electricity. In particular, he was inspired by the book ''[[Conversations in Chemistry]]'' by [[Jane Marcet]].<ref>[http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi744.htm Jane Marcet's Books ] John H. Lienhard , University of Houston, Accessed January 2007.</ref>
 
At the age of twenty, in 1812, at the end of his apprenticeship, Faraday attended lectures by the eminent English [[chemist]] and [[physicist]] [[Humphry Davy]] of the [[Royal Institution]] and [[Royal Society]], and [[John Tatum]], founder of the [[City Philosophical Society]]. Many tickets for these lectures were given to Faraday by [[William Dance]] (one of the founders of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]]). Afterwards, Faraday sent Davy a three hundred page book based on notes taken during the lectures. Davy's reply was immediate, kind, and favorable. When Davy damaged his eyesight in an accident with [[nitrogen trichloride]], he decided to employ Faraday as a secretary. When John Payne, one of the Royal Institution's assistants, was sacked, the now Sir Humphry Davy was asked to find a replacement. He appointed Faraday as Chemical Assistant at the Royal Institution on [[March 1]].<ref name="EncBrit"/>

In the class-based English society of the time, Faraday was not considered a gentleman. When Davy went on a long tour to the continent in 1813-5, his valet did not wish to go. Faraday was going as Davy's scientific assistant, and was asked to act as Davy's valet until a replacement could be found in Paris. Davy failed to find a replacement, and Faraday was forced to fill the role of valet as well as assistant throughout the trip. Davy's wife, [[Jane Apreece]], refused to treat Faraday as an equal (making him travel outside the coach, eat with the servants, etc.) and generally made Faraday so miserable that he contemplated returning to England alone and giving up science altogether. The trip did, however, give him access to the European scientific elite and a host of stimulating ideas.<ref name="EncBrit"/>

His sponsor and mentor was [[John 'Mad Jack' Fuller]], who created the [[Fullerian Professorship of Chemistry]] at the Royal Institution.  

Faraday was a devout Christian and a member of the small [[Sandemanian]] denomination, an offshoot of the [[Church of Scotland]]. He later served two terms as an elder in the group's church.

Faraday married Sarah Barnard (1800-1879) on June 2, 1821, although they would never have children. They met through attending the Sandemanian church.

He was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1824, appointed director of the laboratory in 1825; and in 1833 he was appointed Fullerian professor of chemistry in the institution for life, without the obligation to deliver lectures.

===Chemistry===

Faraday's earliest chemical work was as an assistant to Davy. He made a special study of [[chlorine]], and discovered two new chlorides of [[carbon]]. He also made the first rough experiments on the diffusion of gases, a phenomenon first pointed out by [[John Dalton]], the physical importance of which was more fully brought to light by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] and [[Joseph Loschmidt]]. He succeeded in liquefying several gases; he investigated the alloys of [[steel]], and produced several new kinds of glass intended for optical purposes. A specimen of one of these heavy glasses afterwards became historically important as the substance in which Faraday detected the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light when the glass was placed in a magnetic field, and also as the substance which was first repelled by the poles of the magnet. He also endeavoured, with some success, to make the general methods of chemistry, as distinguished from its results, the subject of special study and of popular exposition.

He invented an early form of what was to become the [[Bunsen burner]], which is used almost universally in science laboratories as a convenient source of heat.<ref>{{cite journal  | last =Jensen  | first =William B.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =The Origin of the Bunsen Burner | journal = Journal of Chemical Education  | volume = 82  | issue = 4 | pages =  | publisher =  | date =2005  | url = http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/HS/Journal/Issues/2005/Apr/clicSubscriber/V82N04/p518.pdf  | doi =  | id =  | accessdate =}}</ref>

Faraday worked extensively in the field of [[chemistry]], discovering chemical substances such as [[benzene]] (which he called bicarburet of hydrogen), inventing the system of [[oxidation number]]s, and liquefying gases such as chlorine. He obtained a composition of the chlorine [[clathrate hydrate]] discovered by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810 (Makogon, 1997).  Faraday also discovered the laws of [[electrolysis]] and popularized terminology such as [[anode]], [[cathode]], [[electrode]], and [[ion]], terms largely created by [[William Whewell]].  For these accomplishments, many modern chemists regard Faraday as one of the finest experimental scientists in history.

===Electricity===
His greatest work was with electricity. The first experiment which he recorded was the construction of a [[voltaic pile]] with seven halfpence pieces, stacked together with seven disks of sheet zinc, and six pieces of paper moistened with salt water. With this pile he decomposed sulphate of magnesia (first letter to Abbott, July 12, 1812).  [[Image:Michael Faraday statue.JPG|thumb|''Michael Faraday'' - statue in Savoy Place, London. <br><small>Sculptor [[John Henry Foley]] RA </small>]]
In [[1821]], soon after the Danish physicist and chemist, [[Hans Christian <U+00D8>rsted]] discovered the phenomenon of [[electromagnetism]], Davy and  British scientist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] tried but failed to design an [[electric motor]]. <ref name="IEEUK"/> Faraday, having discussed the problem with the two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called electromagnetic rotation: a continuous circular motion from the circular magnetic force around a wire and a wire extending into a pool of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] with a magnet placed inside would rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery. The latter device is known as a [[homopolar motor]]. These experiments and inventions form the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology.  Faraday published his results without acknowledging his debt to Wollaston and Davy, and the resulting controversy caused Faraday to withdraw from electromagnetic research for several years.
At this stage, there is also evidence to suggest that Davy may have been trying to slow Faraday<U+2019>s rise as a scientist (or natural philosopher as it was known then). In 1825, for instance, Davy set him onto optical glass experiments, which progressed for six years with no great results. It was not until Davy's death, in 1829, that Faraday stopped these fruitless tasks and moved on to endeavors that were more worthwhile. Two years later, in [[1831]], he began his great series of experiments in which he discovered [[electromagnetic induction]]. (  [[Joseph Henry]] likely discovered [[Electromagnetic induction|self-induction]] a few months earlier and both may have been anticipated by the work of [[Francesco Zantedeschi]] in Italy in 1829 and 1830.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Francesco_Zantedeschi  |title=Francesco Zantedeschi article at at the Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=2007-06-16 |last=Brother Potamian |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=1913  |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Wikisource  |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Faraday's breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary current was induced in the other coil.<ref name="IEEUK"/> This phenomenon is known as [[mutual induction]].  The iron ring-coil apparatus is still on display at the Royal Institution. In subsequent experiments he found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, an electric current flowed in the wire. The current also flowed if the loop was moved over a stationary magnet.  [[Image:Faraday title page.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]'' (1861)]]  His demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field. This relation was mathematically modelled by [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], which subsequently went on to become one of the four [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]]. These in turn have evolved into the generalization known today as [[field theory]]. 

Faraday later used the principle to construct the electric [[Electrical generator#Dynamo|dynamo]], the ancestor of modern power generators.

In [[1839]] he completed a series of experiments aimed at investigating the fundamental nature of electricity.  Faraday used "[[Electrostatics|static]]",  [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], and "[[Bioelectromagnetism|animal electricity]]" to produce the phenomena of electrostatic attraction, [[electrolysis]], [[Electromagnetism|magnetism]], etc.  He concluded that, contrary to scientific opinion of the time, the divisions between the various "kinds" of electricity were illusory.  Faraday instead proposed that only a single "electricity" exists, and the changing values of quantity and intensity (voltage and charge) would produce different groups of phenomena.<ref name="IEEUK"/>

Near the end of his career Faraday proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor.  This idea was rejected by his fellow scientists, and Faraday did not live to see this idea eventually accepted. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields.  That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which dominated engineering and industry for the remainder of the 19th century.

In 1845 he discovered the phenomenon that he named [[diamagnetism]], and what is now called the [[Faraday effect]]: The plane of [[polarization]] of linearly polarized light propagated through a material medium can be rotated by the application of an external magnetic field aligned in the propagation direction. He wrote in his notebook, "I have at last succeeded in ''illuminating a magnetic curve'' or ''line of force'' and in ''magnetising a ray of light''". This established that magnetic force and light were related. 

In his work on static electricity, Faraday demonstrated that the charge only resided on the exterior of a charged conductor, and exterior charge had no influence on anything enclosed within a conductor.  This is because the exterior charges redistribute such that the interior fields due to them cancel. This shielding effect is used in what is now known as a [[Faraday cage]].

Despite his excellence as an experimentalist, his mathematical ability did not extend so far as trigonometry or any but the simplest algebra. However, his experimental work was consolidated by the able [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who developed his equations which lie at the base of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena. Faraday, nevertheless, was able to convey his ideas in clear and simple language.

== Later life==
[[Image:Faraday-signature.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Michael Faraday's signature]]
In 1848, as a result of representations by the [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Consort]], Michael Faraday was awarded a [[Grace and favour]] house in  [[Hampton Court]], [[Surrey]] free of all expenses or upkeep. This was the Master Mason's House, later called Faraday House, and now No.37 Hampton Court Road. In 1858 he retired to live there.<ref> http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/detail.asp?ContentID=197 Twickenham Museum on Faraday and Faraday House , Accessed June 2006 </ref>

During his lifetime, Faraday rejected a [[knighthood]] and twice refused to become [[President of the Royal Society]].

He died at his house at [[Hampton Court]] on [[August 25]], [[1867]]. He has a memorial plaque in [[Westminster Abbey]], near [[Isaac Newton]]'s tomb, but he turned down burial there and is interred in the Sandemanian plot in [[Highgate Cemetery]].

== Miscellaneous ==
[[Image:Faraday_Michael_grave.jpg|thumb|right|Michael Faraday's grave at [[Highgate Cemetery]]]]

Faraday gave a successful series of lectures on the chemistry and physics of flames at the [[Royal Institution]], entitled ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]''. This was the origin of the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas lectures]] for young people, which are still given there every year and bear his name. 

Faraday and [[William Whewell]] were responsible for coining many familiar words including 'electrode', 'cathode', and 'ion'.

Faraday refused to participate in the production of chemical weapons for the [[Crimean War]] citing ethical reasons.

A statue of Faraday stands in Savoy Place, London, outside the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]].

A recently built hall of accommodation at [[Brunel University]] is named after Faraday.

A hall at [[Loughborough University]] was named after Faraday in [[1960]]. Near the entrance to its dining hall is a bronze casting, which depicts the symbol of an electrical [[transformer]], and inside there hangs a portrait, both in Faraday's honour.  

Faraday's picture was printed on British <U+00A3>20 [[British banknotes|banknotes]] from 1991 until 2001.<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/withdrawn_notes.htm Bank of England, ''Withdrawn Notes'']</ref>

In the [[video game]] [[Chromehounds]] there is a ThermoVision Device named the Faraday.

The former UK [[Faraday Atmospheric Research Station in Antarctica (GALINDEZ ISLAND - 65.15S/64.16W)|Faraday Atmospheric Research Station]] in Antarctica  was named after him.
