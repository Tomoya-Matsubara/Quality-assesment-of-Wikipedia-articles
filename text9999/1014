'''New York State Route 49''' ('''NY Route 49''' or '''NY 49''') is a [[state highway (US)|state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]]. It runs from [[NY Route 3]] east of [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]] to [[Interstate 790 (New York)|Interstate 790]], [[NY Route 5]], [[NY Route 8]] and [[NY Route 12]] in [[Utica (NY)|Utica]]. A portion of it between [[Rome (NY)|Rome]] and Utica is known as the '''Utica-Rome Expressway'''.

== Route description ==
New York State Route 49 begins at an interchange with [[New York State Route 3]] in Volney.<ref name="nymap07">{{cite map|title=1977-2007 I love New York state map|date=[[2007]]|publisher=[[I Love New York]]|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref> The route begins going eastward, intersecting with [[New York State Route 264]] just outside of Pennellville. The route crosses some local and county roads before entering [[Central Square, New York|Central Square]], where it intersects with [[U.S. Route 11]]. It is not long after that Route 49 interchanges with [[Interstate 81 in New York|Interstate 81]] at Exit 32. Route 49 leaves Central Square and heads into region of [[Oneida Lake, New York|Oneida Lake]].<ref name="nymap07"/> 

[[Image:NY 49 Eastern Terminus map.svg|thumb|left|290px|Diagram of the interchange between I-790, NY 5, NY 8, NY 12 and NY 49]]
The highway begins to parallel the shore of Oneida Lake after the town of [[Constantia, New York|Constantia]].<ref name="nymap07"/> Route 49 enters Oneida County and intersects with [[New York State Route 13]] after Oneida Lake ends in [[Vienna, New York|Vienna]]. The highway then parallels the [[Erie Canal]] on its journey eastward. Just north of Stacy Basin, [[New York State Route 46]] intersects and becomes concurrent with 49.<ref name="nymap07"/> 

Routes 49 and 46 head to the northeast and enter the city of [[Rome, New York|Rome]].<ref name="nymap07"/> There, [[New York State Route 69]] becomes concurent. Route 46 turns off, and Routes 49 and 69 head to [[New York State Route 365]]. The road becomes concurrent and becomes a freeway. Route 49 leaves 365 and 69 behind and becomes known as the Utica-Rome Expressway for the rest of its length. Route 49 interchanges with [[New York State Route 825]] first, then [[New York State Route 291]].

===Utica Area===
The freeway continues eastward, entering Utica about a mile from the eastern terminus. The highway is unusual in that its westbound lanes run parallel to the [[New York State Thruway|Thruway]] to the latter's north, with the eastbound lanes to the south. Route 49 terminates at a complex interchange for [[New York State Route 5]], [[New York State Route 8]], [[New York State Route 12]], and [[Interstate 790]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

== History ==
Route 49 was assigned in [[1926]] from [[Central Square, New York|Central Square]] to [[Rome, New York|Rome]]. The parts from Volney to Central Square and Rome to Utica were unnumbered. In [[1930]], Route 49 was extended over both alignments and then stretched from Volney to Utica.<ref>{{cite news|author=Leon A. Dickinson|title=New Signs for State Highways|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1930-01-12]]|page=136}}</ref> Route 49 was later realigned onto the Utica-Rome Expressway.
