"'''Love the Way You Lie'''" is a song by the American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist [[Eminem]] from his seventh studio album ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' (2010). [[Skylar Grey]], a singer-songwriter, wrote and recorded the [[demo (music)|demo]] alongside the producer [[Alex da Kid]] when she felt she was in an abusive romantic relationship with the music industry. Eminem wrote the verses and chose the Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] to sing the chorus; their past experiences in difficult relationships influenced the collaboration. Recording sessions were held in [[Ferndale, Michigan]], and [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Backed by guitar, piano and violin, the track is a [[Tempo (music)|midtempo]] hip hop [[ballad]] with a [[Pop music|pop]] refrain and describes two lovers who refuse to separate despite being in a dangerous [[love<U+2013>hate relationship]].

[[Interscope Records]] released the song in August 2010 as the second single from ''Recovery''. Critics praised its melody but were divided on thematic aspects such as poignancy and accuracy. Eminem promoted the single with performances at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010|2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo]], the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]] and [[music festival|festivals]]. The music video, directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], stars [[Dominic Monaghan]] and [[Megan Fox]] in a violent relationship and shows Eminem and Rihanna in front of a burning house. The clip had a mixed reception due to scenes of [[domestic violence]]. Reporters suggested that the song and its accompanying video were influenced by Eminem's and Rihanna's relationships with their respective ex-lovers Kimberly Scott and [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]]. 

Critics listed "Love the Way You Lie" among the best tracks of 2010 and of Eminem's career. The song won many awards and received five [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations. It is Eminem's best-selling single and was number one on twenty-six [[record chart]]s, including the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for seven&nbsp;weeks. The single sold more than five&nbsp;million copies in the US and was the [[List of best-selling singles by year (UK)|best-selling song of 2010 in the United Kingdom]]. Musical acts such as [[Cher Lloyd]] and [[The Band Perry]] performed [[cover versions]]. Rihanna has said that the theme of domestic violence, a topic on which she claims many people do not have insight, is what makes the song effective. She later recorded "[[Love the Way You Lie (Part II)]]", narrated mostly from her perspective.

Noveck questioned whether the lyrics are "a treatise against (or apology for) domestic violence, or an irresponsible glorification of it? Or, is it something uncomfortable in between?"<ref name=asspress/> Marjorie Gilberg, executive director of the anti-teenage violence group Break the Cycle, commented that "Love the Way You Lie" can teach listeners about the dangers of abusive relationships if interpreted correctly. She believed that because popular culture often depicts what is socially acceptable, people may accept such violence more easily. She added, "One problem, though,&nbsp;... is that the song reflects myths about domestic violence<U+2014>myths that lead to blaming the victim."<ref name=asspress/> Gilberg said the victim is often accused of being as guilty as the partner but wants to be loved, not abused.<ref name=asspress/>

Rihanna sings the chorus in front of a burning house, while an interspersing scene shows fire on a woman's (Fox) palms. In another scene, the woman is asleep with her lover (Monaghan) and wakes up.

The man then pushes her onto the wall and aims his fist at her, puncturing the wall instead.
