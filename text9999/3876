==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
A large part of the story unfolds in Calcutta (now [[Kolkata]]). Apu (played by [[Soumitra Chatterjee]]) is an unemployed graduate living in a rented room in Calcutta. He is working on a novel based on his life and hopes to get it published some day. Incidentally, one day he meets his old friend Pulu, who coaxes him to join him on a trip to his village to attend a cousin, Aparna's (played by 14 year old [[Sharmila Tagore]]) marriage. On the day of the marriage it turns out that the bridegroom is mentally challenged and the marriage is cancelled. But the villagers believe that the young bride must be wedded off during this certain auspicious hour or she will have to remain unmarried all her life. Apu, after initially refusing when requested by his friend, comes to the rescue of the bride and agrees to marry her. He returns to his apartment in Calcutta after the wedding with Aparna. He takes up a clerical job, and a loving relationship begins to bloom between them. Yet the young couple's blissful days are cut short when Aparna dies while giving birth to their son, Kajal. Apu is overcome with grief and holds the child responsible for his wife's death. He shuns his worldly responsibilities and becomes a recluse, while the child is left with his maternal grandparents. At last, Apu decides to come back to reality and reunites with his son. They return to Calcutta together to start life afresh.
