'''''Dryandra'' ser. ''Niveae''''' is an obsolete series within the former genus ''Dryandra'' (now [[Banksia ser. Dryandra|''Banksia'' ser. ''Dryandra'']]). It was first published by [[George Bentham]] in 1870, and was given a new circumscription by [[Alex George]] in 1996, but was ultimately discarded in 2007 when [[Austin Mast]] and [[Kevin Thiele]] sunk ''Dryandra'' into ''[[Banksia]]''.

==According to Bentham==
Bentham's definition of ''D.''&nbsp;ser. ''Niveae'' was "Flowering stems from a creeping trunk very short, with one or few ovoid flower-heads surrounded by long floral leaves. Leaves pinnate with numerous rigid segments white underneath except in D. nana." Four species were included; the placement and circumscription of the series may be summarised as follows:<ref name="Bentham 1870">{{cite encyclopedia | author = [[George Bentham|Bentham, George]] | year = 1870 | title = Dryandra | encyclopedia = [[Flora Australiensis]] | volume = 5 | pages = 562<U+2013>584 | location = London | publisher = L.

==According to George==
With the passage of time following the publication of Bentham's arrangement, ''D.''&nbsp;ser. ''Niveae'' was gradually abandoned. As the flowers and fruit are highly similar across all species in the series, it is difficult to distinguish individual species. For this reason the name ''Dryandra nivea'' began to be used in a broad sense, to refer to the entire group, and the other species names fell into disuse.

When [[Alex George]] published [[George's taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra|his revision]] of ''Dryandra'' in 1996, he recognised that there were several taxa in the series, and that these could be distinguished by their leaf shape. He resurrected a number of abandoned names, and published some new species and varieties. A new circumscription was given for the series: essentially the series was defined as containing those species in which the flowers of a flower head form a cicle about a central hole.

==Recent developments==
Since 1998, [[Austin Mast]] has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for the subtribe [[Banksiinae]]. His analyses have provided compelling evidence of the [[paraphyly]] of ''[[Banksia]]'' with respect to ''[[Dryandra]]''; that is, it seems that ''Dryandra'' arose from within the ranks of ''Banksia''.<ref name="Mast 1998">{{cite journal | author = Mast, Austin R. | year = 1998 | title = Molecular systematics of subtribe Banksiinae (''Banksia'' and ''Dryandra''; Proteaceae) based on cpDNA and nrDNA sequence data: implications for taxonomy and biogeography | journal = Australian Systematic Botany | volume = 11 | pages = 321<U+2013>342 | doi = 10.1071/SB97026}}</ref><ref name="Mast 2002">{{cite journal | author = Mast, Austin R. and Thomas J.
