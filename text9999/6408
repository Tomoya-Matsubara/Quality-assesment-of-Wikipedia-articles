"'''Girl Gone Wild'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] from her twelfth studio album, ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]'' (2012). She co-wrote the song with [[Benny Benassi]], his cousin [[Allessandro Benassi|Alle Benassi]] (known together as the [[Benassi Bros.]]), and songwriter Jenson Vaughan, while the Benassi Bros. co-produced the track with Madonna. Vaughan had worked on the lyrics before sending them to Madonna, who developed the demo into the final version of "Girl Gone Wild". The song was confirmed by Madonna as the second single from the album and was released on March 2, 2012, by [[Interscope Records]].

Musically, "Girl Gone Wild" is a mid-tempo [[synthpop|electropop]] party track that draws influence from [[Four-on-the-floor (dance)|four-on-the-floor]]. The song opens with a prayer and features [[electronic dance music|electronic]] and [[house music|house]] elements. After the song was released, [[Joe Francis]], the creator of [[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]] franchise, threatened to sue Madonna for [[copyright infringement]] if she sang the song during her performance at [[Super Bowl XLVI]]. Madonna's representatives stated that she was not aware of either Francis or the lawsuit, and that several songs with the same name had already been released by other artists.

The song received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its composition as a return to dance music for Madonna, but criticized its lyrics and believed it failed as album opener on ''MDNA''. "Girl Gone Wild" was a minor commercial success, reaching the top-ten of the charts in Hungary, Israel, Italy, Russia, South Africa, South Korea and Spain, along with the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' digital charts in Greece. It debuted and peaked at number 38 on US [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] due to radio airplay. On the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart, "Girl Gone Wild" became Madonna's 42nd chart topper, extending her record as the artist with the highest number-one hits on that chart.

A black-and-white [[music video]] for the song, directed by [[Mert and Marcus]], was released on March 20, 2012. The video features Madonna and a number of male [[model (person)|models]] in different looks, dancing with Ukrainian group [[Kazaky]]. It received critical acclaim for the editing and the visuals, while reviewers noted that it took inspiration from several past videos released by Madonna, such as "[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]", "[[Justify My Love (video)|Justify My Love]]", "[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]" and "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]". "Girl Gone Wild" was performed as the opening song during [[The MDNA Tour]] (2012), in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedral]] setting showing religious iconography, and Madonna and her dancers executing choreography in high-heels.

==Background and release==

In December 2010, Madonna posted a message on her [[Facebook]] page exclaiming that she was on the lookout for "maddest, sickest, most badass people" as collaborators for making new dance music.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1654515/madonna-tells-fans-i-need-make-new-music.jhtml|title=Madonna Tells Fans: 'I Need To Make New Music!'|first=James|last=Dinh|publisher=[[MTV News]]. [[Viacom]]|date=December 17, 2010|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> On July 4, 2011, her manager [[Guy Oseary]] announced that the singer had entered the studio for recording her then unnamed twelfth studio album.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/469373/madonna-starts-recording-12th-studio-album |title=Madonna Starts Recording 12th Studio Album|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|first=Jason|last=Lipshutz|date=July 5, 2011|accessdate=January 11, 2012}}</ref> Among the collaborators enlisted for the project was Italian record producer [[Benny Benassi]], who at that time was working on the release of his fourth studio album ''[[Electroman (album)|Electroman]]''. His label [[Ultra Records]]' head Patrick Moxey felt that the producer's "aggressive" sounds would "work well with some of the major American superstar artists". Moxey asked for some additional tracks from him, and his longtime production partner and cousin, [[Allessandro Benassi|Alle (Allessandro) Benassi]].<ref name=conception/>

A few [[demo (music)|demos]] produced by them were sent to songwriter Jenson Vaughan, who liked the lyrics and the "bass-driven" sound. Vaughan added the top-line on a demo and returned it to Moxey, who shared it with Benassi's European co-manager Paul Sears, who in-turn shared the demo with Oseary.<ref name=conception>{{cite journal|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1098781/how-madonnas-second-mdna-single-girls-gone-wild-came-together|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=February 13, 2012|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|last=Mason|first=Kerri|title=How Madonna's Second 'MDNA' Single 'Girl Gone Wild' Came Together}}</ref> Upon listening, Madonna was impressed with the demos and requested the [[Benassi Bros.]] to come to London for a recording session. Moxey commented that the singer "loved [the producer]. Benny is such a quality person; I think that made it all flow so much easier." Two tracks from those sessions, "Girl Gone Wild" and "[[I'm Addicted]]", were included on the final track list of the album, named ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]''.<ref name=conception/> Madonna spoke about her experience of collaborating with the Benassi Bros.:
<blockquote>
Benny was a tricky one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It was a little bit frustrating at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they<U+2019>re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/6229452/madonna-cried-mdna|title=Madonna 'Almost Cried' While Recording 'MDNA'|last=Daw|first=Robbie|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2014|work=|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]].

==Controversy==
On February 4, 2012, controversy arose surrounding the song's title, initially called "Girls Gone Wild". [[Joe Francis]], the creator of the [[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]] franchisee, threatened to sue Madonna if she sang the song during her halftime show performance. His representatives claimed that "[Madonna] violated Federal and State trademark laws by making unauthorized use of Mr. Francis' trademark Girls Gone Wild in not only the title, but subject line of her various advertisements in order to lure potential consumers to purchase her latest musical effort." However, the [[National Football League]] (NFL) revealed in their magazine that the song would not be performed at the Super Bowl.<ref name=eonline>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/291746/joe-francis-warns-madonna-with-cease-and-desist-letter-concerning-girls-gone-wild-song|title=Joe Francis Warns Madonna With Cease and Desist Letter Concerning "Girls Gone Wild" Song|last2=Machado|first2=Baker|last1=Nessif|first1=Bruna|publisher=[[E!]]. [[NBCUniversal]]|date=February 4, 2012|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> On hearing about the allegations, Moxey commented that Francis only wanted attention from the press, adding: "When I looked at [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]], I noticed there were approximately 50 records called 'Girls Gone Wild'. This guy just thinks too much of himself."<ref name=conception/>

The song title was slightly modified to the singular "Girl Gone Wild" to which Francis again commented: "Clearly her label was trying to avoid legal action surrounding the song... But [the new title] is still infringement as far as the law is concerned, and we have been in touch with Madonna's people in an effort to resolve this issue."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/madonna/62302|title=Madonna threatened with legal action over new single|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|work=[[NME]]|date=February 27, 2012|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> He added that he would pursue new legal action if more changes were not made to the track.

==Recording and composition==
"Girl Gone Wild" was [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] at [[MSR Studios]], [[New York City]] and [[Sarm West Studios]], [[Notting Hill]], [[London]]. It was written by Madonna, Vaughan and the Benassi Bros., and was produced by the Benassis and Madonna. [[Demo Castellon|Demacio "Demo" Castellon]] recorded and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] the track.

Together they fixed the production of the song, including the layering and stacking of the track. They added more vocals to the composition and during the [[refrain|chorus]], decided on how many voices should be duplicated. According to Alle Benassi, Madonna "has clear idea. She knows very well what she wants: where put something, how, why. It's surreal but impressive."<ref name="epk">{{cite video|people=[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]|title=Madonna&nbsp;<U+2013> MDNA Electronic Press Kit Featuring William Orbit, Martin Solveig, Benny Benassi|time=3:48<U+2013>4:58|publisher=[[Interscope Records]]|medium=[[Streaming media|Streaming]], [[Music download|Digital download]]|year=2012}}</ref>

"Girl Gone Wild" is as a mid-tempo party track, drawing influence from [[Four-on-the-floor (dance)|four-on-the-floor]] and has a similar sound to tracks from the singer's tenth studio album, ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005). Kerri Mason of ''Billboard'' described it as mostly a [[Electronic dance music|dance]] track with more of [[Electronic music|electro]] influence in it rather than [[house music|house]].<ref name=conception/> Jason Lipshutz from the same publication relegated it in the [[synthpop|electropop]] genre, adding that it has a "driving beat" and "propulsive [[hook (music)|hook]]" reminiscent of Madonna's 2005 single, "[[Hung Up]]".<ref name=ggwlisten>{{cite news|last=Lipshitz|first=Jason|title=Madonna Gets 'Fired Up' in 'Girl Gone Wild' Single: Listen|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/503956/madonna-gets-fired-up-in-girl-gone-wild-single-listen|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=February 28, 2012|date=February 27, 2012}}</ref> The song opens with a prayer, and Madonna uttering "Oh my God, I'm heartily sorry", which was a spoken rendition of the last track, "Act of Contrition", from Madonna's fourth studio album, ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'' (1989).<ref name="att1"/><ref name="mtvtrack"/> During the [[Thirty-two-bar form#middle eight|middle eight]], Madonna talks about how "good girls" should not misbehave. ''[[NME]]'' contributor Ailbhe Malone noted that the composition featured elements from the singer's previous singles, "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]" (2000) and "[[Jump (Madonna song)|Jump]]" (2006).<ref name="nme"/> As she sings "forgive me", the beat drops completely with the music disintegrating.<ref name=guardian/> Madonna's vocals are processed to appear thin and stretched out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muumuse.com/2012/03/madonna-mdna-album-review.html/|title=Madonna "MDNA" (Album Review)|publisher=[[MuuMuse]]|date=March 26, 2012|accessdate=June 8, 2014|last=Stern|first=Bradley}}</ref>

According to the sheet music of the song published online by [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], "Girl Gone Wild" is set in the time signature of [[time signature|common time]], with a moderate [[tempo]] of 127 beats per minute. It is composed in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[A minor]] with Madonna's vocals ranging from Gm to Dm. The song follows a sequence of G{{music|sharp}}m<U+2013>C{{music|sharp}}m<U+2013>E during the opening prayer verse and Am<U+2013>Em<U+2013>G<U+2013>F for the rest as its [[chord progression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pianosheetmusiconline.com/girl-gone-wild-madonna/|title=Sheet Music&nbsp;<U+2013> Madonna "Girl Gone Wild"|publisher=Piano Sheet Music Online. [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]]|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}</ref> Mike Senior from ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' magazine found that along with the predominant synth sounds, there was "a lot" of [[double tracking]] present in the song which made the vocals unclear. He felt that this was not pose a problem in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo sound]], but with [[Monaural|mono]] sounds the combined vocals appeared double tracked while the vocal level decreased. The mixing for "Girl Gone Wild" was done mainly for stereo speakers and around the 1:45<U+2013>2:00 mark, the vocal levels fluctuate with the backing music being dwarfed. Senior also observed that Madonna put the stresses of the words on the beats of the song, hence some of the enunciation are lost with the drum sounds, especially on the title hook.<ref name="sos"/>

Lyrically, the song addresses a "good girl gone wild" singing about her "burning hot desire" to have some fun.<ref name=mdnatt/> It contains references to singer [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]" (1983), with lyrics like "Girls, they just wanna have some fun" and "The room is spinning / It must be the [[Tanqueray]] / I'm about to go astray / My inhibitions gone away".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/02/27/madonna-new-single-girl-gone-wild/|title=Madonna releases lyric video for new song 'Girl Gone Wild': Watch it here|last=Rahman|first=Ray|date=February 27, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc}}</ref> In the intermediate verses, Madonna utters "forgive me", which is a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] term used as a sexual reference. The lyrics, once placed in the context of Madonna's career "attains a new meaning" according to Josh Haigh from ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'' magazine. Explaining it, he said that the meaning behind the lyrics was how Madonna, being a Catholic girl herself, decided that she would not be tied down by anyone else's rules, and consequently became one of the most recognizable musical artists.<ref name="att1"/>

==Critical reception==
The song has received mixed reviews from music critics. Keith Caulfied of ''Billboard'' deemed it as a "very dance-by-the-numbers with Madonna" song, and further assessed that the chorus made "Girl Gone Wild" a memorable song.<ref name=mdnatt>{{cite news|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|title=Madonna, 'MDNA': Track-By-Track Review|url=http://www.billboard.com/new-releases/madonna-mdna-track-by-track-review-1006416552.story|accessdate=April 17, 2012|journal=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=March 9, 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120312000854/http://www.billboard.com/new-releases/madonna-mdna-track-by-track-review-1006416552.story|archivedate=March 3, 2012}}</ref> Robbie Daw from [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] said that "Madge [is] doing  what she does best: turning up the heat on the dance floor," but that "the song is packed with tried-but-true sexual pop cliches."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/6199121/madonnas-girl-gone-wild-lyric-video-watch|title=Madonna's Girl Gone Wild|date=February 27, 2012|accessdate=February 27, 2012|publisher=Idolator.

The second look portrayed was called "rockstar" for which designer Michael Smith created t-shirts out of metal [[mesh]], while Lecompte cut the singer's hair short, so that it would resemble her early look.

===Release and synopsis===
A 30 second teaser video was released on March 9, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/6212802/madonna-girl-gone-wild-video-preview|title=Madonna's "Girl Gone Wild" Video: Watch A Preview|last=Daw|first=Robbie|date=March 9, 2012|accessdate=March 11, 2012|publisher=Idolator.

March 20|date=March 16, 2012|accessdate=March 19, 2012|publisher=Madonna.com}}</ref> Shot completely in [[black-and-white]], the music video is polar opposite to the colorful, football-themed video for previous single "Give Me All Your Luvin'".<ref name="nyvideo"/> Instead of having a plot, the video is an assortment of imagery referring to the singer's early works.<ref name="nods"/>

The video opens with Madonna in the "platinum bombshell" look uttering the opening prayers of the song. As the music starts she is shown in the other looks, performing yoga poses, while intercepting scenes show the male models in provocative poses. Other scenes show Madonna dancing against a wall, smoking a cigarette, and being bound to a chain. Kazaky appears during the first chorus and perform a dance routine in the heels. While Madonna sings the second verse, she is surrounded by the male models, who are almost nude. The singer joins Kazaky during the chorus emulating the choreography with them. Interspersed are scenes of Madonna playing with a [[fog machine]] billowing smoke.

During the intermediate break, one of the male models is shown nude and wearing a crown of thorns on his head, while Madonna gets caressed by the others. The final sequence of the video shows the singer dancing energetically with Kazaky, with the fog machine and the male models who grind against each other. "Girl Gone Wild" ends with Madonna dropping the fog machine and a final scene showing the singer's face with black colored tears pouring from her eyes.

===Analysis and reception===

John Mitchell from MTV News observed five main influences from Madonna's past behind the video. He explained that references from the singer's music video for the 1992 song "[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]" are present with Madonna's "platinum bombshell" look as well as scenes of leather-underwear wearing men and [[sadomasochism|S&M]]. The choreography had direct references to the "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" (1990) music video, and the gay eroticism was also displayed in both of them. For Mitchell, the video for "[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]" (1995) is referenced with Madonna's latex clothing and portions showing the singer against a white background. The "[[Justify My Love]]" (1990) video had scenes of [[orgy]] in it, similar to the scenes of Madonna being caressed by her dancers in "Girl Gone Wild", towards the end. Mitchell concluded by saying that the crown of thorns directly referenced the religious iconography in the singer's "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]" (1989) video.<ref name="nods">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1681501/madonna-girl-gone-wild/|title=Madonna's 'Girl Gone Wild' Video: Five Key Nods To Her Past|last=Mitchell|first=John|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2014|work=|publisher=MTV News.

According to the website, the video was labeled explicit because of the "raunchy" and "orgy" scenes, thereby blocking it from getting uploaded to the singer's [[Vevo]] account. YouTube also asked Madonna's representative to upload a more PG-rated version. Madonna later commented, "What's wrong with... what grinding?

Madonna's first performance of "Girl Gone Wild" was on [[The MDNA Tour]] (2012) as the concert's opening track. The performance was choreographed by Jason Young and Alison Faulk, along with dancer Derrell Bullock, who assisted as supervisor. According to Faulk, Madonna asked Bullock to experiment with the concept of "girl gone wild", and come up with a routine and style of his own. He wanted to find a story with the dancing and presented his moves to Madonna the next day. The singer also wanted to experiment with the concept of Catholic church, along with [[monk]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. Her message behind it was that of freedom, "people getting to do whatever they wanted to". Four dancers from Brooklyn, adept at [[Flexing (dance)|bone breaking]] dance, were enlisted as backup crew for the performance. Young recalled that they could "create these abstract, very animalistic shapes. What they can do with their arms is unbelievable. Anything that most people can do in front of their bodies, they do it behind their bodies." The dancing required the boys to put on heels like Kazaky in the music video. Most of them refused to abide by it, resulting in Madonna giving them a choice to put the heels and dance or leave the show. The dancers complied and learned the choreography.<ref>{{cite AV media |first=Jason|last= Young |first2=Alison |last2=Faulk|date= September 12, 2013|title=Madonna&nbsp;<U+2013> Girl Gone Wild&nbsp;<U+2013> The Edge |trans_title= |medium=Streaming |language= |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE_4621S8pE|accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |time= 9:05|location= New York City|publisher=[[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|DanceOn]].

The show began with a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] [[cathedral]] setting, which was developed by Tait Towers, a production management company.
