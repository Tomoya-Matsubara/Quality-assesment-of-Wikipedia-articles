'''Urmuz''' ({{IPA-ro|ur<U+02C8>muz}}, pen name of '''Demetru Dem. Demetrescu-Buz<U+0103>u''', also known as '''Hurmuz''' or '''Cirivi<U+015F>''', born '''Dimitrie Dim. Ionescu-Buzeu'''; March 17, 1883 <U+2013> November 23, 1923) was a [[Romania]]n writer, lawyer and civil servant, who became a cult hero in Romania's [[avant-garde]] scene. His scattered work, consisting of [[Absurdism|absurdist]] short prose and poetry, opened a new genre in [[Romanian literature|Romanian letters]] and [[Romanian humor|humor]], and captured the imagination of [[Modernist literature|modernists]] for several generations. Urmuz's ''Bizarre'' (or ''Weird'') ''Pages'' were largely independent of European modernism, even though some may have been triggered by [[Futurism]]; their valorization of [[nonsense verse]], [[black comedy]], [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] tendencies and exploration into the [[unconscious mind]] have repeatedly been cited as influential for the development of [[Dada]]ism and the [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. Individual pieces such as "The Funnel and Stamate", "Isma<U+00EF>l and Turnavitu", "Algazy & Grummer" or "The Fuchsiad" are [[parody]] fragments, dealing with monstrous and [[shapeshifting]] creatures in mundane settings, and announcing techniques later taken up by [[Surrealism]]. 

Urmuz's biography between his high school eccentricity and his public suicide remains largely mysterious, and some of the sympathetic accounts have been described as purposefully deceptive. The abstruse imagery of his work has produced a large corpus of diverging interpretations. He has notably been read as a satirist of public life in the 1910s, an unlikely conservative and nostalgic, or an emotionally distant [[Esotericism|esotericist]].

In Urmuz's lifetime, his stories were only acted out by his thespian friend [[George Ciprian]] and published as samples by ''[[Cuget Rom<U+00E2>nesc]]'' newspaper, with support from modernist writer [[Tudor Arghezi]]. Ciprian and Arghezi were together responsible for creating the link between Urmuz and the emerging avant-garde, their activity as Urmuz promoters being later enhanced by such figures as [[Ion Vinea]], [[Geo Bogza]], [[Lucian Boz]], [[Sa<U+015F>a Pan<U+0103>]] and [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Ionesco]]. Beginning in the late 1930s, Urmuz also became the focus interest for the elite critics, who either welcomed him into [[20th century in literature|20th-century literature]] or dismissed him as a buffoonish impostor. By then, his activity also inspired an eponymous avant-garde magazine edited by Bogza, as well as Ciprian's drama ''[[The Drake's Head]]''.

==Name==
Urmuz's birth name was, in full, ''Dimitrie Dim. Ionescu-Buzeu'' (or ''Buz<U+0103>u''), changed to ''Dimitrie Dim. Dumitrescu-Buzeu'' when he was still a child, and later settled as ''Demetru Dem.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Mitic<U+0103> was the eldest son of a middle class nuclear family: his father, described by Ciprian as "short and mean" (''om scund <U+015F>i ciufut''),<ref>Ciprian, p.40. According to Sandqvist (p.224), the man was "extremely authoritarian".</ref> worked as a physician. In his spare time, Ionescu-Buzeu Sr. was a classical scholar, folklorist and active [[Freemasonry in Romania|Freemason]].<ref name="rcargumente"/> His wife, the writer's mother, was Eliza n<U+00E9>e Pa<U+015F>cani, sister of the doctor, chemist and [[University of Paris]] professor Cristien Pascani.<ref name="rcargumente"/><ref name="ts224">Sandqvist, p.224</ref> Urmuz had numerous other siblings ("a multitude", according to Ciprian),<ref name="gc40"/> of whom most were daughters. One of Urmuz's sisters, Eliza (married Vorvoreanu) was later a main source of information on the author's childhood and adolescence.<ref name="rcargumente"/><ref name="vainnovator"/><ref>Blaga, p.324, 326; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.91<U+2013>92, 339<U+2013>340, 352</ref>

The future Urmuz was born in the northern [[Muntenia]]n town of [[Curtea de Arge<U+015F>]], and, at age five, spent one year in Paris with his parents.<ref name="rcargumente"/><ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.888; Deligiorgis edition, p.5</ref> The family eventually settled in Romania's capital, [[Bucharest]], where his father was hygiene teacher at [[Matei Basarab National College]],<ref name="rcargumente"/><ref name="ts224"/> later city [[health inspector]], and rented houses in [[Antim Monastery]] quarter.<ref name="gc40"/> Young Mitic<U+0103> was described by his sister as mainly unpretentious and introverted, fascinated by scientific discovery and, in his childhood years, a passionate reader of [[Jules Verne]]'s science fiction books.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.340; Sandqvist, p.224<U+2013>225</ref> At a later stage, he was also possibly familiarized with and influenced by [[German idealism]] and by the philosophical views of 19th-century poet [[Mihai Eminescu]].<ref name="pc340">Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.340</ref><ref name="pceretic">{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Urmuz-un-conservator-eretic*articleID_9525-articles_details.html "Urmuz: un conservator eretic?"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 193, November 2003</ref> A more evident influence on the future writer was [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], the main figure in early 20th-century [[Romanian humor|Romanian comediography]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.340; Sandqvist, p.209</ref><ref name="caragialeazi">{{ro icon}} [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/ANCHETAf.htm "Anchet<U+0103>.

A patra putere: Caragiale'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2011, p.87.  ISBN 978-973-50-2954-8</ref> 

Ionescu-Buz<U+0103>u's family had artistic interests, and Urmuz grew up with a fascination for classical music and [[fine art]], learning to play the piano and taking up amateur [[oil painting]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.340, 341; Ciprian, p.40<U+2013>42</ref> He got along best with his mother, who was also a pianist. The devout daughter of an [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest, she was unable to instill in her young son the same respect for the Church.<ref name="ts224"/>

Urmuz's arrival to literary history took place in the atmosphere of Bucharest [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]]. It was at this junction that he became a mate of Ciprian, who later described their encounter as momentous: "I don't much believe in destiny. [...] Yet I find it such an odd incident that my bench mate, from my failing grade year through to my high school graduation, was [...] this tiny man of a rare originality, who had a massive say on how my life would turn up."<ref name="gc40"/> Ciprian describes what follows as his own "initiation in artistic matters": he recalls conversations with "Cirivi<U+015F>" where they debated the "perfection" of [[Ancient Greek sculpture]], and mentions that young Urmuz, unlike himself, regarded theater as a "minor art".<ref>Ciprian, p.40<U+2013>42</ref> Instead, Urmuz preferred to attend concerts at the [[Romanian Atheneum]], and, Ciprian writes, had an advanced understanding of [[absolute music]] even at age thirteen.<ref>Ciprian, p.42</ref> Reportedly, the young man was also in the attendance at lectures given by [[Titu Maiorescu]], a philosopher and aesthete who had influenced both Eminescu and Caragiale.<ref name="pceretic"/>

===''Pahuci'' brotherhood===
[[File:Gheorghe Lazar - High School.JPG|thumb|330px|[[Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r National College (Bucharest)|Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r National College]]]]
Some years later, while enrolled at the [[Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r National College (Bucharest)|Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r National College]], Urmuz turned his interest toward mocking the severity of his teachers and challenging the dominance of artistic traditionalism. One such early episode is attested by Ciprian: amused by the creation of a ''Vivat Dacia'' ("Long Live [[Dacia]]") association of nationalist students, Urmuz subverted its meetings, and, with [[deadpan]] snark, suggested that membership fees should be paid in duck heads.<ref>Ciprian, p.47<U+2013>49</ref> Also according to Ciprian, these events soon lost their shock value, leading him and Urmuz to "take to the streets", where they began their activity as pranksters. Their initial experiment was to pressure law-abiding and credulous passers-by into presenting their identity papers for inspection, and the apparent success earned Urmuz an unexpected following in school (his fans even heckled ''Vivat Dacia'' into accepting poultry heads as means of payment, before the society dissolved itself with ceremony).<ref>Ciprian, p.49</ref> Another colleague, future traditionalist poet [[Vasile Voiculescu]], recalled young Urmuz as "genially knavish", his humor being "cerebral, harder to detect and appreciate".<ref name="pc344">Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.344</ref> 

The core group of Urmuzian disciples, organized as a [[secret society]], comprised Ciprian (nicknamed "Macferlan" by Urmuz), Alexandru "B<U+0103>l<U+0103>l<U+0103>u" Bujoreanu and Costic<U+0103> "Pentagon" Grigorescu, together known as the ''pahuci''. Allegedly, the obscure word originated from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "yawns".<ref name="rcargumente"/> Their activity centered on daring pranks: Urmuz and the other three young men once made an impromptu visit to the isolated [[C<U+0103>ld<U+0103>ru<U+015F>ani Monastery]], in [[Ilfov County]], where the deposed and disgraced [[Ghenadie Petrescu|Metropolitan Ghenadie]] was living in banishment. Passing themselves off as newspaper editors, they demanded (and received) honored guest treatment, tested the monks' patience, and were later introduced to a well-disposed Ghenadie.<ref>Ciprian, p.50<U+2013>57</ref> Ciprian also recalls that Urmuz's philosophical musings or deadpan [[surreal humor]] were a direct inspiration for other pranks and experiments. He describes how Cirivi<U+015F> acted out sadness for the plight of a screechy sledge (declaring "my heart is at one with all things in existence"), but then duped onlookers into believing that the squeaks came from a woman somehow trapped under the vehicle.<ref>Ciprian, p.59<U+2013>60</ref> Reportedly, Urmuz also approached his seniors training at [[Seminary|seminaries]] or other traditionalist institutions, earned their attention by claiming to share the nationalist agenda, and then began reciting them nonsense lyrics such as an evolving draft of his mock-[[fable]] "The Chroniclers".<ref>Ciprian, p.61<U+2013>62</ref> 

Outside school, the young man was still introverted, and, Sandqvist notes, "extremely shy, especially with girls."<ref name="ts225">Sandqvist, p.225</ref> Ciprian recalls Cirivi<U+015F>'s engrossing [[pick-up line]]s: he acted familiar to the any young woman who caught his eye, assuring her that they had met once before, and, having stirred her curiosity, falsely recounting how they both used to kill [[Flesh-fly|flesh-flies]] for sport.<ref>Ciprian, p.63<U+2013>64</ref>

The ''pahuci'' welcomed their graduation with one final act of defiance against the school principal, whom they visited in his office, where they began hopping about in circles.<ref>Ciprian, p.71<U+2013>72</ref> Even though their group did not survive once its members took different career paths, they had regular reunions at the Spiru Godelea [[tavern]], where they earned notoriety for their rude and unconventional behavior.<ref>Ciprian, p.72<U+2013>73, 373</ref> Urmuz enrolled at the [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy|Bucharest Medical School]], allegedly after pressures from his stern father.<ref>Sandqvist, p.224<U+2013>225</ref> According to Ciprian, this training did not agree with his friend, who would complain of being "unable to make himself understood by the cadavers."<ref>Ciprian, p.73. See also Sandqvist, p.225</ref> This was probably a sign that the young man could not bear to witness [[dissection]].<ref name="vainnovator"/> He eventually entered the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Law, which was to be his ''alma mater'',<ref>Ciprian, p.77; Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.570<U+2013>571; Deligiorgis edition, p.5</ref> while also taking lectures in composition and [[counterpoint]] at the [[National University of Music Bucharest|Music and Declamation Conservatory]].<ref name="ts225"/> Additionally, he completed his first service term in the [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Infantry]].<ref name="ts225"/>

Urmuz became head of his family in 1907. That year, his father and two younger brothers died, and his sister Eliza was married.<ref name="ts225"/> He also continued to take the initiative in daring acts of ''[[<U+00E9>pater le bourgeois]]''. Ciprian recalls the two of them renting a carriage which Urmuz would order around, making a right at every junction, and effectively going around in circles around the [[Palace of Justice (Bucharest)|Palace of Justice]]. Urmuz then proceeded to pester the street vendors, stopping over to buy a random assortment of useless items: [[pretzel]]s, a pile of charcoal, and an old hen which he impaled on his walking cane.<ref name="rcargumente"/><ref>Ciprian, p.73<U+2013>77; Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.571. See also Sandqvist, p.19</ref>

===Dobrujan career and military life===
Having passed his law examination in 1904, Urmuz was first appointed judge in the rural locality of [[Cocu, Arge<U+015F>|Cocu (R<U+0103>chi<U+0163>ele)]], in [[Arge<U+015F> County]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.225, 227</ref> It is probable that at around this stage (ca. 1908), he was committing to paper the first fragments in his collection ''Bizarre Pages'', some of which were reportedly written during a family reunion in Cocu.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.9, 91<U+2013>92</ref> According to Eliza Vorvoreanu, he was doing this mainly to entertain his mother and sisters,<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.91<U+2013>92, 339<U+2013>340, 352<U+2013>353</ref> but Urmuz also amused local potentates, one of whom even offered his daughter's hand in marriage (Urmuz refused).<ref name="ts227">Sandqvist, p.227</ref> At the time, Mitic<U+0103> also discovered his passion for [[modern art]]: he was an admirer of [[Primitivism|primitivist]] sculptor [[Constantin Br<U+00E2>ncu<U+015F>i]], fascinated by his 1907 work ''The Wisdom of the Earth''.<ref name="pc340"/>

Eventually, Urmuz was made a [[justice of the peace]] in the remote [[Dobruja]] region: for a while, he was in [[Casimcea]] village.<ref name="ts225"/><ref name="dmdobrogean">{{ro icon}} Doru Mare<U+015F>, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/TEATRU.-Teatru-dobrogean*articleID_6924-articles_details.html "Teatru. Teatru dobrogean"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 7, April 2000</ref> Later, he was dispatched closer to Bucharest, at [[R<U+0103>cari|Ghergani]], [[D<U+00E2>mbovi<U+0163>a County]].<ref name="ts225"/> These assignments were interrupted in 1913, when Urmuz was called under arms, in the [[Second Balkan War]] against [[Bulgaria]].<ref name="ts227"/>

Ciprian mentions having lost touch with his friend "for a long time", before receiving a letter in which the latter complained about the provincial apathy and the lack of musical entertainment; attached was a draft of the "Algazy & Grummer" story, which Ciprian was supposed to read to the "seminary brethren", informing them "about the progresses registered in young literature".<ref>Ciprian, p.77<U+2013>78. See also Sandqvist, p.227</ref> Ciprian tells of having discovered the writer in Urmuz, and popularizing this and other stories in his own circle of intellectuals.<ref>Ciprian, p.78<U+2013>79, 82</ref> He also mentions that, in his budding acting career, he was basing some of his performances at Blanduzia Garden on Urmuz's letters.<ref name="gc114">Ciprian, p.114</ref> 

These developments coincided with the outbreak of World War I. Between 1914 and summer 1916, when Romania was still neutral territory, Ciprian's efforts of circulating the ''Bizarre Pages'' may have reached a peak. Urmuz's texts were probably spread around in handwritten copies, becoming somewhat familiar to Bucharest's [[bohemian society]], but Urmuz himself was still an anonymous figure.<ref name="gumartie"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.9, 269, 340, 342, 343. See also Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.55</ref> Both Ciprian and fellow actor [[Grigore M<U+0103>rculescu]] are said to have given public readings from the ''Bizarre Pages'' at [[Casa Cap<U+015F>a]] restaurant.<ref name="gumartie"/><ref>Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.571<U+2013>572</ref> According to literary historian [[Paul Cernat]], if rumors about Ciprian's early performances of Urmuz's texts are true, it would constitute one of the first samples of [[Experimental theatre|avant-garde shows]] in [[Theater of Romania|Romanian theatrical tradition]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.269, 342</ref>

Around 1916, Urmuz had obtained a relocation, as judge in the Muntenian town of [[Alexandria, Romania|Alexandria]]. It was there that he met with poet and schoolteacher [[Mihail Cruceanu]], also on assignment. As Cruceanu later recalled, Urmuz was captivated by the artistic revolt carried out in [[Italy]] by the [[Futurism|Futurist]] group, and in particular by the poetry of Futurist leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.91</ref> According to literary historian [[Tom Sandqvist]], Urmuz may have first read about the Italian intitiatives in the local newspaper ''[[Democra<U+0163>ia]]'', which had covered them in early 1909.<ref>Sandqvist, p.22</ref> As a result of this or another encounter, he decided to include, as a subtitle to one of his manuscripts, the words: ''Schi<U+0163>e <U+015F>i nuvele... aproape futuriste'' ("[[Sketch story|Sketches]] and Novellas... almost Futuristic").<ref>Blaga, p.323; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.91, 340, 381; Sandqvist, p.22, 237</ref>

Having reached the rank of Lieutenant,<ref name="ts227"/> Demetrescu-Buz<U+0103>u was again called under arms when Romania joined the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. In one account, he saw action against the [[Central Powers]] in [[Moldavia]], following the Army's [[Romania in World War I|northward retreat]].<ref name="sded5"/> However, this is partly contradicted by his correspondence from Moldavia, which shows that his new office was as a [[quartermaster]], and which records his frustration at not having been allowed to fight in the trenches.<ref name="vainnovator"/> According to another account, he was mostly bedridden with [[malaria]], and therefore unable to perform any military duty.<ref name="ts227"/>

===Debut===
Urmuz was again in Bucharest, working as ''grefier'' (registrar or [[court reporter]]) at the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice]]; sources disagree on whether this appointment dated from 1918 or earlier.<ref name="gscursa"/><ref name="gumartie"/><ref name="ipcalatoriile">{{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/4b4c11681f0b2175_175.pdf " 'C<U+0103>l<U+0103>toriile' avangardei rom<U+00E2>ne<U+015F>ti (I)"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 175, December 2009, p.10<U+2013>11</ref><ref name="ctinainte">{{ro icon}} C.

The year 1922 brought Urmuz's debut in print. Fascinated by the (then unnamed) ''Bizarre Pages'', poet and journalist [[Tudor Arghezi]] included two of them in ''[[Cuget Rom<U+00E2>nesc]]'' newspaper. Arghezi reportedly made efforts to persuade his more serious fellow editors of ''Cuget'', and possibly intended to undermine their attempt of putting out a [[newspaper of record]].<ref name="gscursa"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.340, 356; Sandqvist, p.221</ref> The gazette had also published a manifesto by Arghezi, in which he had outlined the goal of combating "sterile literature", and his intention of cultivating the "[[will to power]]" in post-war literary culture.<ref name="gscursa"/> Urmuz was thus the first avant-garde writer popularized by Arghezi, in a list which, by 1940, also came to include a large section of the younger Romanian modernists.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.48, 340</ref>

Arghezi later wrote that his relationship with Urmuz was difficult, especially since the ''grefier'' panicked that the establishment would discover his other career: "he feared that the Cassation Court would better detect him as ''Urmuz'' than under his own name".<ref name="gumartie"/> The memoirist refers to Demetrescu-Buz<U+0103>u's perfectionism and unease, enhanced in the week before publication: "He would wake up in the middle of the night and would send a very urgent letter, asking me if the comma after a 'that' should be moved before. I found him wandering around my house at night, shy, restless, fainthearted or in a hopeful trance, that something of substance may or may not be found in his prose, that perhaps there's an error, asking me to publish it, and then again to destroy it; to publish it together with an eulogistic note, and then again to curse him. He bribed [the printers] to change phrases and words that I had to put back into place, as previous editorial interventions were for sure better than his."<ref name="ctinainte"/><ref name="oc571">Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.571</ref> The letters they exchanged show that the ''grefier'' was not enthusiastic about even seeing his texts and his pseudonym in print, to which Arghezi was replying: "from among the few we'll be cooperating with, you were my first choice".<ref name="gscursa"/> 

By May 1922, Urmuz had grown more confident in his strength as a writer. He sent Arghezi a copy of the "Algazy & Grummer" story, which, he joked, needed to be published for "the nation's benefit".<ref name="gscursa"/> He also proposed headlining it with the additional title ''Bizarre Pages''.<ref name="gscursa"/> The work was never published by ''Cuget'', probably because of a change in priorities: around that date, the paper hosted traditionalist editorials by culture critic [[Nicolae Iorga]], which were incompatible with Arghezi's fronde.<ref name="gscursa"/>

===Suicide===
On November 23, 1923, Urmuz shot himself, an event which remains shrouded in mystery. His death occurred in a public location, described as being close to [[<U+015E>oseaua Kiseleff|Kiseleff Road]] in northern Bucharest.<ref name="gscursa"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.340; Pan<U+0103>, p.71; Sandqvist, p.233</ref> Some early sources suggest that he may have been suffering from an incurable disease,<ref name="rcargumente"/><ref name="gscursa"/><ref name="ts233">Sandqvist, p.233</ref> but he is also argued to have been fascinated with guns and their destructive potential. In 1914 for instance, he wrote down in his papers a homage to revolvers, crediting them with a magical power over the suicidal brain.<ref name="ts233"/><ref name="svgrummer">{{ro icon}} Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/dupa_masa_lui_grummer "Dup<U+0103> masa lui Grummer"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 46/2008</ref> Reports also show that he was theorizing the purposelessness and hollowness of life, addressing his fears on the subject to family members during the funeral of his brother Constantin (also in 1914).<ref name="ts233"/> Researcher [[Geo <U+015E>erban]] wrote about Demetrescu-Buz<U+0103>u's well-hidden disappointment, assessing that, during his final year, the writer continued to act cheerful and relaxed, but that a "devastating" tension was building up inside him.<ref name="gscursa"/> At around that time, Urmuz took his one real trip as an adult civilian, visiting the [[Budaki Lagoon]] in [[Bessarabia]].<ref name="vainnovator"/> 

Writing in 1927, Arghezi publicized his regret at not having cultivated the friendship: "I never saw him again and I am weighed down by the irreparable grief of never seeking him out. I believe my optimism could have rekindled in his cerebral chaos those candid and pure things that were beginning to die."<ref name="gscursa"/> Several Urmuz exegetes have traditionally seen the suicide intrinsically linked to Urmuz's artistic attitude. For scholar Carmen Blaga, it was the "dissolution of [his] faith" in Romania's intellectual class, along with economic decline and "an existential void", that prompted the writer to opt himself out.<ref>Blaga, p.325<U+2013>326</ref> This resonates with claims by the first-generation followers of Urmuz: [[Geo Bogza]] suggests that his mentor killed himself once the deconstructive process, performed by his "sharp intellect", reached a natural conclusion;<ref name="cgtraim">{{ro icon}} Cezar Gheorghe, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Traim-intr-o-lume-urmuziana*articleID_21560-articles_details.html "Tr<U+0103>im <U+00EE>ntr-o lume urmuzian<U+0103>"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 469, April 2009</ref> [[Sa<U+015F>a Pan<U+0103>]] claims that Urmuz was tired of merely amusing the "cretins" and "profiteers" who held sway over Bucharest's literary scene, and, determined to turn his literary persona into "stardust", took the risk of destroying his physical self.<ref>Pan<U+0103>, p.70<U+2013>71</ref> Additionally, academic [[George C<U+0103>linescu]] argued that there was a philosophical rationale "very in tune with his century": "he wanted to die in some original way, 'without any cause'."<ref name="gc888">C<U+0103>linescu, p.888</ref> 

Kept at the city morgue, the body was assigned to Urmuz's brother-in-law and fellow clerk C. Stoicescu, who stated that the writer had been suffering from [[neurosis]].<ref name="gscursa"/><ref name="ts233"/> Urmuz was buried on November 26, in his family plot at [[Bellu cemetery]].<ref name="gscursa"/> On the day, the event was publicized by a small obituary in ''[[Diminea<U+0163>a]]'' daily, signed with the initial ''C'' (presumably, for Ciprian).<ref name="pc342">Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.342</ref> Both this and other press notices failed to mention that the ''grefier'' and the published author were one and the same, and the general public was for long unaware of any such connection.<ref name="gscursa"/> Story goes that an anonymous woman visited the family shortly after the burial, inquiring as to whether the deceased had left any letters.<ref>Sandqvist, p.234</ref>

In its manuscript form, Urmuz's definitive corpus of works covers only 40 pages, 50 at most.<ref name="spsolitary">[[Simona Popescu]], [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_urmuz-the-solitary.html "Urmuz, the Solitary"], in ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine]'', Nr. 19/2003</ref><ref name="pc340"/> Various other manuscripts survive, including diaries and hundreds of [[aphorism]]s, but have for long been unknown to researchers.<ref name="pceretic"/><ref>Blaga, ''passim''; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.381; Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.570, 571</ref>

==Urmuz's ideas and stylistic affinities==
===The avant-garde herald vs. the conservative===
Shortly after his death, Urmuz's work was linked to the emergence of avant-garde rebellion throughout Europe, and in particular to the rise of Romania's own modernist scene: writing in 2007, Paul Cernat describes this version of events as a "[[Myth of origins|founding myth]]" of Romanian avant-garde literature.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.339, 346</ref> A literary critic and modernist enthusiast, [[Lucian Boz]], assessed that Urmuz, like [[Arthur Rimbaud]] before him, embodied the "lyrical [[nihilism]]" of avant-garde currents.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.334, 347</ref> In the 1960s, literary historian [[Ovid Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu]] wrote of his being "the world's first pre-[[Dada]] exercises".<ref name="oc55">Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.55</ref> In 2002 however, scholar Adrian L<U+0103>c<U+0103>tu<U+015F> revised this thesis, arguing that it had created a "blockage" in critical reception, and that the actual Urmuz had more complex views on the avant-garde.<ref name="pceretic"/> Others have emphasized that Urmuz's unusual revolt ran contemporary with the revival of intense traditionalism of Romanian literature (the ''[[S<U+0103>m<U+0103>n<U+0103>torul]]'' moment), which would make his pre-Dada inspiration a moment of special significance.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.352, 374, 386; {{ro icon}} [[Bogdan Cre<U+0163>u]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Avangarda-prudenta*articleID_16647-articles_details.html " 'Avangarda prudent<U+0103>' "], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 350, December 2006</ref><ref name="agrmecanic">{{ro icon}} Adrian G. Romil<U+0103>, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/ROMILAm.htm "Universul mecanic al lui Urmuz"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March 2002</ref>

The contact with [[Futurism]], although acknowledged by Urmuz, is judged by many of his commentators as superficial and delayed. Literary historian [[Nicolae Balot<U+0103>]] first proposed that the Romanian had merely wanted to show his sympathy for (and not a like-mindedness with) Futurism; that the works in question date back before the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', to the [[Cocu, Arge<U+015F>|Cocu]] period; and that the ''Bizarre Pages'' have more in common with [[Expressionism]] than with Marinetti.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.91, 361<U+2013>362</ref> According to Cernat: "By the looks of it, [the ''Bizarre Pages''] were completed largely independent of influence from the European avant-garde movements [...]. We do not know, however, how many of these were already completed in 1909, the year when European Futurism was 'invented'."<ref name="pc340"/> Emilia Drogoreanu, a researcher of Romanian Futurism, stresses: "The values and representations of [the] world celebrated through Futurism exist within the Urmuzian text, but are entirely uprooted from the significance offered them by [the Futurists]".<ref>{{ro icon}} Dan Gulea, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Perspective-asupra-futurismului*articleID_11411-articles_details.html "Perspective asupra futurismului"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 231, July 2004</ref> Although she finds various similarities between Urmuz and Marinetti, Carmen Blaga notes that the former's jadedness was no match for the latter's militancy.<ref>Blaga, p.325<U+2013>328, 330</ref> 

Various authors have also suggested that Urmuz was actually a radical conservative, whose vehemence against platitude in art only camouflaged a basic conventionalism. This perspective found its voice with L<U+0103>c<U+0103>tu<U+015F>, who sees Urmuz as a conservative heretic, equally annoyed by [[bourgeois]] and [[anti-bourgeois]] discourses.<ref name="pceretic"/> Writing in 1958, Ciprian also reflected on the possibility that Cirivi<U+015F> was actually "teasing" the avant-garde tendencies emerging in his day, but concluded: "I would rather assume that under these various experiments was smoldering the lust for shaking the individual out of his skin, of tearing him away from himself, of disassembling him, of making him doubt the authenticity of accumulated knowledge."<ref>Ciprian, p.62<U+2013>63</ref> He writes that Urmuz's work lashed out at "human nature in its most intimate creases."<ref name="pc342; gc82">Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.342; Ciprian, p.82</ref> Accordingly, some authors have even considered Urmuz the inheritor of late-19th-century [[Decadent movement|Decadence]]<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Futurism-si-interculturalitate*articleID_11410-articles_details.html "Futurism <U+015F>i interculturalitate"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 231, July 2004</ref> or of a matured [[alexandrine]] purity.<ref>{{ro icon}} Alexandru Ruja, [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/iulie2007.pdf "Cultur<U+0103> <U+015F>i sens"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 7/2007, p.9</ref> In other such readings, Urmuz appears to lend his backing to the [[Sexism|sexist]]<ref name="ipmisogini">{{ro icon}} [[Ioana P<U+00E2>rvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/erau_interbelicii_misogini "Erau interbelicii misogini?"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 6/2010</ref> or [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]<ref name="pceretic"/> viewpoints of his contemporaries. Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu also writes: "the musings comprised in his manuscript notebooks [...] are restrained, flat, commonplace, as if the work of a different man."<ref name="oc571"/>

Much debate surrounds the issue of Urmuz's connection to an [[Absurdism|absurdist]] streak in earlier [[Romanian literature]] and [[Folklore of Romania|folklore]]. In the 1940s, [[George C<U+0103>linescu]] discussed in detail an Urmuzian tradition, of as being characteristic for the literary culture of Romania's southern, [[Wallachia]]n, cities. He noted that Urmuz was one of "the great grimacing sensitive" Wallachians, a "[[Balkans|Balkan]]" succession which also includes [[Pitarul Hristache|Hristache the Baker]], [[Anton Pann]], [[Ion Minulescu]], [[Mateiu Caragiale]], [[Ion Barbu]] and Arghezi.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.53, 814; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.351, 352, 357</ref> In his definition, the source of Arghezi and Urmuz is in the folkloric tradition of self-[[parody]], where the ''[[doina]]'' songs degenerate into spells or "grotesque whines".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.351<U+2013>352</ref> The image of a folkloric Urmuz was soon after taken up by other critics, including [[Eugenio Co<U+015F>eriu]] and Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu.<ref>Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.184. See also Sandqvist, p.228, 230, 248</ref>

===The buffoon vs. the professional writer===
A section among Urmuz's commentators tends to classify him as a genial but superficial prankster, a buffoon rather than a serious author. Although sympathetic to Urmuz's work, George C<U+0103>linescu called the ''Bizarre Pages'' "an intelligent literary game" of "witty teenagers".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.340, 350, 352<U+2013>355</ref> The goal, C<U+0103>linescu suggested, was "purely epic", "seeming to tell a story without in fact recounting anything".<ref name="pc353">Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.353</ref> Another verdict of this kind belongs to aesthetician [[Tudor Vianu]], who also believed that Urmuz was a satirist of [[automatic behavior]], and fundamentally a sarcastic realist.<ref name="pc353"/> More severe in tone, [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]] assessed that Urmuz was superficial, chaotic and amateurish, interesting to researchers only because of defying "the bourgeois platitude".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.349<U+2013>350</ref> Contrarily, another [[interwar]] exegete, [[Perpessicius]], made ample efforts to rehabilitate Urmuz as a thoughtful literary figure with "great creative verve", on the same level as Arghezi and poet [[Adrian Maniu]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.322, 329</ref>

Ciprian noted that Urmuz was unlike the "cheeky, daring, disorganized" pranksters whom he superficially resembled, that nothing in Urmuz's exterior gave the impression that he was in any way "spoiled".<ref>Ciprian, p.60<U+2013>61</ref> Time, he suggests, did not alter Urumuz's "attitude on life": "Only now the about-turns were more daring and the tightrope acts was much more savvy."<ref>Ciprian, p.77</ref> In 1925, commenting on Urmuz's flair for depicting the "overall pointlessness of [human] existence", Ciprian also argued: "For the mediocre mindset, [Urmuz] may seem incoherent and unbalanced<U+2014>which is why his work is not addressed to the masses."<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.343</ref> Critic Adrian G. Romil<U+0103> writes that the new "paradigm" in Urmuz's literary universe appears significant and laborious, but adds: "That which we do not know is if the writer [...] wasn't purely and simply playing around."<ref name="agrmecanic"/> However, [[Ioana P<U+00E2>rvulescu]] assessed that Urmuz, an author of "extreme originality",<ref name="ipdrumuri">{{ro icon}} [[Ioana P<U+00E2>rvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/drumuri_care_se_bifurc "Drumuri care se bifurc<U+0103>"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 44/2004</ref> "put his own life into play and games [...] and that is why his work is more tragic than comedic or is nested in that no man's land where tragedy and comedy overlap."<ref name="ip87"/> 

Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu sees in the ''Bizarre Pages'' indication of a "singular" and tragic experience,<ref>Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.570<U+2013>571</ref> while [[Geo <U+015E>erban]] argues that Urmuz's "verve" comes from destructive pressures on his own psychology.<ref name="gscursa"/> Reviewer Simona Vasilache also suggests that the ''Bizarre Pages'' hide a "long digested" rage, with serious and even dramatic undertones.<ref name="svgrummer"/> Other essayists have spoken about Urmuz's "cruelty" in depicting anguishing situations, in criticizing social life and in using language stripped of its [[metaphor]]s; they call him "one of the cruelest authors I ever did read" ([[Eug<U+00E8>ne Ionesco]]) and "cruel in a primitive sense" (Irina Ungureanu).<ref name="cgtraim"/> As Ciprian reports, Urmuz was also self-deprecatory, amused by the others' attention, and claiming that his own ''elucubra<U+0163>ii'' ("phantasmagorias") could only still be used to "trip the seminary brethren".<ref>Ciprian, p.78<U+2013>79</ref> One of his aphorisms hints to his internal drama and its role in creation: "There are cases when God can only help you by giving you more and more suffering."<ref name="vainnovator"/> 

===Kafka, Jarry and "antiliterature"===
Among those who describe Urmuz as more of an individual rebel than an avant-garde hero, several have come to regard him as the Romanian parallel of solitary intellectuals who likewise made an impact on [[20th century in literature|20th-century literature]].

A major disagreement among critics relates to Urmuz's ambiguous positioning, between literature, [[Anti-art|antiliterature]] and [[metafiction]]. In reference to the ''Bizarre Pages'', Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu introduced the term "antiprose".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.382<U+2013>383; Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.570<U+2013>576</ref> In Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu's view, the antiliterary "device" Urmuz invented is impersonal and regulated, in the manner of Dada "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]", but as such ingenious and therefore inimitable.<ref>Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.56<U+2013>57, 570<U+2013>576</ref> Authors such as [[Adrian Marino]], [[Eugen Negrici]], [[Lucian Raicu]] and [[Mircea Scarlat]] have spoken about Urmuz as a revolutionist of language, who liberated texts from coherence and even [[semantics]]; whereas others<U+2014>[[Livius Cioc<U+00E2>rlie]], [[Radu Petrescu]], [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [[Marin Mincu]], [[Mihai Zamfir]]<U+2014>have regarded him as mainly a textualist, interested in reusing and redefining the limits of poetry or narration, but creating a coherent, if personal, universe.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.370<U+2013>372, 375<U+2013>377, 383<U+2013>384, 390<U+2013>391</ref> According to Vasile Andru, Urmuzian literature is by definition open to all these associations, its antiliterary aspects illustrating the modern gap between "[[Nature versus nurture|nature and nurture]]".<ref name="vainnovator"/> Critic C. Trandafir, who sees Urmuz's apparent textualism as canceled out by deeper meanings in his prose, writes: "The man who wrote the 'bizarre pages' had a clear critical awareness of the transformations needed within literary discourse."<ref name="ctinainte"/>

===Esoteric layers===
As [[Vasile Voiculescu]] recalls, Urmuz had was genuinely "tormented by [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] matters".<ref name="pc344"/> Some of Urmuz's commentators therefore discussed him as a reader of the [[unconscious mind]] or propagator of [[Esotericism|esoteric]] knowledge, suggesting that a hidden layer of mystical symbolism can be discerned in all his activities. According to Perpessicius, the ''Bizarre Pages'' as a whole carry a [[subtext]] of [[Mythopoeia (genre)|mythopoeia]], or "fragments of a new [[mythology]]".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.321<U+2013>322, 349</ref> Boz also drew a comparison between Urmuz and the morose poems of [[George Bacovia]], arguing that they both send the reader on "tragic explorations" and "journeys to the underworld".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.334, 348</ref> In Boz's interpretation, Urmuz was not at all a humorist, but rather one who issued a solitary "call to order" and, creating a "magical phenomenon", elevated his reader above the realities of the flesh.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.347</ref> He first discussed the connection between the ''Bizarre Pages'' and 1930s [[Surrealism]], which likewise turned its attention to the [[abnormal psychology]], to "[[psychosis]]" and "[[dementia]]".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.335</ref> The theoretical proto-Surrealism of such works, which places less importance on their topical humor, has generated a long debate between scholars later in the 20th century: some have denied Urmuzian Surrealism, whereas others have continued to identify him as the earliest Romanian Surrealist.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.359<U+2013>366, 368, 376<U+2013>377, 382, 387<U+2013>388</ref>

[[Simona Popescu]], the poet-essayist, presumes that Urmuz's inner motivation was his "psycho-mania", which holds no respect for either convention or posterity, but only for committing one's own "abyssal obsessions" to paper: "death, [[Eros (concept)|the Eros]], creation, and destruction."<ref name="spsolitary"/> Adrian L<U+0103>c<U+0103>tu<U+015F> also makes note of Urmuz's ambiguous allusions to [[autoeroticism]], [[incest]], [[bisexuality]] or [[paraphilia]].<ref name="pceretic"/> Additionally, various commentators suggest that Urmuz's creative spark hides an unresolved conflict with his father. According to Cernat, Urmuz was in conflict with "paternal authority" and more attached to his mother, an "[[Oedipus complex]]" also found in some other literary figures of the pre-modernist generation.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.18, 385</ref> Others too see in Cirivi<U+015F>'s pranks a planned revenge against parental and social pressures.<ref name="cgtraim"/><ref>Blaga, p.324</ref> His sister Eliza credited such accounts, by noting: "You can tell he failed in life because he obeyed his parents blindly, and perhaps also in part due to his lack of will, his shyness, his fear of the public."<ref name="vainnovator"/>

Urmuz the aphorist genuinely trusted that the "Soul" of the world was a [[unity of opposites]], and, inspired by the philosophy of [[Henri Bergson]], also spoke of a "[[<U+00C9>lan vital|universal vital flux]]".<ref>Blaga, p.326<U+2013>327</ref> L<U+0103>c<U+0103>tu<U+015F> and others suggest that Urmuz's worldview is the modern correspondent of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Manichaeism]]: in one of the manuscripts he left behind, Urmuz speculates about there being two Gods, one good and one evil.<ref name="pceretic"/> A distinct, and disputed,<ref>{{ro icon}} [[<U+015E>tefan Borb<U+00E9>ly]], [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=1444 "Luciferism <U+015F>i literatur<U+0103>"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 5/2011; Ioana Bot, "Maledic<U+0163>iunea omniefabilei confuzii masonice", in ''[[Dilemateca]]'', June 2011, p.62</ref> interpretation was put forth by researcher Radu Cern<U+0103>tescu, who believes that Urmuz's life and work reflected the doctrine of [[Freemasonry in Romania|Freemasonry]]. Cern<U+0103>tescu reads indications of Masonic "awakening" throughout Urmuz's stories, and notes that the ''pahuci'' brotherhood was probably the junior or parody version of a Romanian [[Masonic Lodge]].<ref name="rcargumente"/>

==Works==
===Early prose===
Definitions vary in respect to the exact nature and species of Urmuz's [[Experimental literature|experimental]] works, which are prose-like in content. Ciprian simply assessed that Urmuz's pieces "do not belong to any literary genre."<ref name="pc342; gc82"/> In line with his comments about the mythological layer of Urmuz's work, Perpessicius suggested that Urmuz created "new [[fairy tale]]s" and "[[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] sketches".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.321, 349</ref> This intuition was given endorsement by other scholars, who included the ''Bizarre Pages'' in anthologies of Romanian fantasy literature.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.349, 363<U+2013>365</ref> Contrarily, Boz found that Urmuz was "the poet of transcendental absurdity", "the reformer of Romanian poetry", and the counterpart of Romania's [[national poet]], [[Mihai Eminescu]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.330<U+2013>331</ref> The Eminescu-Urmuz comparison, which put aside all their differences in style and vision, was a favorite of avant-garde authors, and, late in the century, served to inspire sympathetic academics such as [[Marin Mincu]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.331, 346, 359<U+2013>360, 373</ref>

According to Ciprian, one of Urmuz's earliest prose fragments was composed, with "The Chroniclers", during ''pahuci'' escapades. Its opening words, Ciprian recalls, were: "The deputy arrived in a brick and tile cart. He was bringing no news, but offered his friends, upon arrival, a few [[Leclanch<U+00E9>]] batteries".<ref>Ciprian, p.62</ref> The same author suggests that these drafts were much inferior to Urmuz's published works, beginning with "Algazy & Grummer".<ref>Ciprian, p.78</ref>

In its definitive version, the Algazy piece offers a glimpse into the strange life and [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] death of its storekeeper characters: Algazy, "a nice old man" with his beard "neatly laid out on a grill [...] surrounded by barbed wire", "does not speak any [[Languages of Europe|European languages]]" and feeds on municipal waste; Grummer, who has "a [[Humorism|bilious temper]]" and "a beak of aromatic wood", spends most time lying under the counter, but sometimes assaults customers in the middle of conversations about sports or literature. When Algazy discovers that his associate has digested, without giving a thought to sharing, "all that was good in literature", he takes his revenge by consuming Grummer's rubbery bladder. A race begins as to who can eat the other first. Their few remains are later discovered by the authorities, and one of Algazy's many wives sweeps them up into oblivion.<ref>Deligiorgis edition, p.54<U+2013>63. See also Sandqvist, p.19<U+2013>20, 230</ref> A different, early variant is quoted "from memory" and commented in Ciprian. In this account, Algazy the storekeeper is persuaded by his domineering wife to make their only son a magistrate. Grummer prepares the boy for his unexpected [[novitiate]], strapping him down to the floor of a cave that must have the scent of [[Colt (horse)|colts]].<ref>Ciprian, p.77<U+2013>78</ref>

From its very title, "Algazy & Grummer" references a defunct firm of suitcase manufacturers. Urmuz's own note to the text apologizes for this, explaining that the names' "musicality" is more suited to the two fictional characters than to their real-life models, and suggesting that the company should change name (or that its patrons must adapt their physical shape accordingly).<ref name="gchowto">{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Cr<U+0103>ciun]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/How-to-Do-Characters-with-Words*articleID_5486-articles_details.html "''How to Do Characters with Words''"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 24, August 2000</ref><ref>Blaga, p.327; Deligiorgis edition, p.54<U+2013>55</ref><ref name="svcotcari">{{ro icon}} Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/doi_cotcari "Doi co<U+0163>cari"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 27/2010</ref> The narrative may hint to the everyday tensions between these entrepreneurs, and perhaps to the boredom of a career in sales;<ref name="svcotcari"/> according to philologist Simona Constantinovici, it is also the confrontation of an entrepreneurial [[Turks of Romania|Turk]] (Algazy) and an intellectual [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jew]] (Grummer), represented as a fight between the [[ostrich]] and the [[platypus]].<ref name="scpersonaj">{{ro icon}} Simona Constantinovici, [http://www.romlit.ro/eveniment_festivalul_zile_si_nopti_de_literatura "Eveniment: Festivalul 'Zile <U+015F>i nop<U+0163>i de literatur<U+0103>'.

==="Isma<U+00EF>l and Turnavitu"===
[[File:Antoniu - Lipscani.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Lipscani]] shops around 1900. Photograph by Alexandru Antoniu]]
In "Isma<U+00EF>l and Turnavitu", Urmuz further explores the bizarre in its everyday settings. This was noted by Ciprian: "[Urmuz] waged war on nature, he created besides nature and against its laws. He was a solitary summit defying heaven and asking: That's all? [...] Always the same slopes? the same [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]]? the same people? the same beards?"<ref>Ciprian, p.82. See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.343</ref> The result, Sandqvist writes, is "breakneck, absurd, and inordinately grotesque."<ref>Sandqvist, p.223</ref> C<U+0103>linescu singled out the work: "The best of his absurd pieces is 'Isma<U+00EF>l and Turnavitu', the solemnly academic portraiture and parody of bourgeois mannerisms, where there's always a confusion being made between the three kingdoms, the animal, the vegetal and the mineral".<ref name="gc888"/>

Isma<U+00EF>l "is made up of eyes, sideburns, and a dress", tied with rope to a badger and stumbling down Arionoaia Street. Protected from "legal responsibility" in the country ("a seed-bed at the bottom of a hole in [[Dobruja]]"), the creature raises an entire badger colony: some he eats raw, with lemon; the others, once they have turned sixteen, he rapes "without the smallest qualm of conscience." The seed-bed is where Isma<U+00EF>l also interviews job applicants, received on the condition that they hatch him "four eggs each". The process is supported by his "[[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]]" Turnavitu, who exchanges love letters with the applicants. Isma<U+00EF>l's actual residence is kept a secret, but it is presumed that he lives, sequestered from "the corruption of electoral mores", in an attic above the home of his grotesquely disfigured father, only to emerge in a [[ball gown]] for the yearly celebration of [[plaster]]. He then offers his body to the workers, in hopes of thus resolving "the labor issue". Whereas Isma<U+00EF>l has once worked as an air fan for "dirty [[Greeks of Romania|Greek]] coffee houses" in the [[Lipscani]] quarter, Turnavitu has a past in "politics": he was for long the government-appointed air fan at the fire precinct kitchen. Isma<U+00EF>l has spared Turnavitu a life of near constant rotation, remunerating his services: the seed-bed interviews, the ritualized apologizes to the leashed badgers, the praise of Isma<U+00EF>l's fashion sense, and the swabbing of [[canola]] over Isma<U+00EF>l's gowns. Their relationship breaks down as Turnavitu, returning from the [[Balearic Islands]] in the form of a [[jerrycan]], passes the [[common cold]] to Isma<U+00EF>l's badgers. Sacked from his job, he contemplates suicide ("not before seeing to the extraction of four [[Canine tooth|canines]] in his mouth"), and hurls himself into a pyre made up of Isma<U+00EF>l's dresses; the patron falls into depression and "decrepitude", retreating to his seed-bed for the rest of his own life.<ref>Deligiorgis edition, p.23<U+2013>29. A short variant, quoted "from memory" and commented upon, in Ciprian, p.78<U+2013>79. See also Sandqvist, p.20, 223</ref>

Like "Algazy & Grummer", "Isma<U+00EF>l and Turnavitu" probably has a skeletal structure borrowed from real life: Turnavitu was a distinguished clan within Bucharest's Greek nobility, tracing its origin back to the [[Phanariote]] era.<ref>{{ro icon}} Mihai Sorin R<U+0103>dulescu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/genealogii-discretia-unui-bucurestean-de-altadata-3180248/ "Genealogii: Discre<U+0163>ia unui bucure<U+015F>tean de alt<U+0103>dat<U+0103>"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', August 29, 2008</ref> The semi-fictional world is populated by other symbols of Romania's connection to the Orient, that are meant to evoke "the banality of a distinctively Balkan scenery" (Carmen Blaga).<ref>Blaga, p.330</ref> Other interpretations have seen in the two protagonists caricatures of political corruption and ''[[parvenu]]'' morals.<ref name="gumartie"/>

==="The Funnel and Stamate"===
"The Funnel and Stamate" insists on the geographical setting of Urmuzian misadventures. Stamate's townhouse is a haven for objects or beings, their presence inventoried over several rooms. Only accessible through a tube, the windowless first room holds together a sample of the [[Noumenon|thing-in-itself]], the statue of a [[Transylvania]]n priest and grammarian, and two humans always "in the process of [[Human evolution|descending from the ape]]". The second room, decorated in "[[Ottoman architecture|Turkish style]]" and "eastern luxury", is painted once a day and carefully measured, by compass, to prevent shrinkage. A third section, under the "Turkish" room, houses a limitless canal, a tiny room and a stake "to which the entire Stamate family is tethered." The "dignified" and "[[Ellipse|elliptical]]" head of the clan spits chewed-up [[celluloid]] on his fat boy Bufty, who "pretends not to notice". For relaxation, the Stamates contemplate [[Nirvana]], located over the canal and "in the same precinct" as them. Old Stamate's musings are interrupted by the provocative intrusion of a [[siren]], who lures him into the deep by presenting him with "an innocent and too decent looking funnel." Stamate returns "a better and more tolerant man", deciding to use the funnel for both the pleasures of sex and those of science. Neglecting his family duties, he goes on nightly expeditions into the funnel, until he discovers in horror that Bufty uses the funnel for a similar purpose. Stamate then decides to part with his wife (sewing her in a bag, to "preserve the cultural traditions of his family") and with Bufty: trapped in the funnel, the boy is sent over to Nirvana, where Stamate makes sure he becomes a "bureau sub-chief". Stamate is left alone to contemplate his plight, wandering to and fro at great speed, and submerging "into micro-infinity."<ref>Deligiorgis edition, p.6<U+2013>21. See also Ciprian, p.79<U+2013>82; Sandqvist, p.221<U+2013>223</ref>

As an early supporter of Urmuz, Ciprian spoke of "The Funnel and Stamate" as "without parallel" in its satire of family life, suggesting that the scene were all the Stamates are tied to a single stake is "more evocative than hundreds of pages from a novel"<ref>Ciprian, p.82</ref> (part of the story has also been read as a sexist joke on fashionable [[androgyny]], since Stamate has a "tonsured and legitimate wife").<ref name="ipmisogini"/> Urmuz's original version in fact carries the subtitle "A Four-Part Novel", in which Paul Cernat reads the intention of parodying the staple genres of traditional literature;<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.195</ref> according to Ioana P<U+00E2>rvulescu, the definition needs to be taken seriously, and makes the text ("perhaps the shortest [novel] in [[European literature]]") a "microscopic" Romanian equivalent of modernist works by [[James Joyce]].<ref name="ipdrumuri"/> Linguist Anca Davidoiu-Roman notes: "Urmuz's [[antinovel]] [...] apparently preserves the structures of the novelistic genre, but undermines them from the inside, cultivating the absurd, the black humor, [...] the nonsensical and the [[zeugma]]."<ref>{{ro icon}} Anca Davidoiu-Roman, [http://arhiva.revistafamilia.ro/2009/Familia_9_2009_web.pdf "Masc<U+0103> <U+015F>i clon<U+0103>. Despre atitudinile parodiei"], in ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 9/2009, p.102</ref> The core theme is believed to be sexual: a paraphrase of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', with Stamate as the ridiculously abstract thinker falling for the debased stand-in of [[femininity]];<ref name="ipdrumuri"/> or even the detailed creation of "an aberrant mechanism for erotic gratification."<ref name="agrmecanic"/> Stamate himself is also described as standing in for "the unimaginative bourgeois".<ref name="gumartie"/>

==="The Fuchsiad"===
[[File:Theodor Fuchs.jpg|thumb|230px|Photograph of [[Theodor Fuchs (composer)|Theodor Fuchs]], ca. 1900]]
Another one of Urmuz's prose creations is "The Fuchsiad", subtitled "An Heroic-Erotic Musical Poem in Prose". Among the scholars, [[Perpessicius]] was first to argue that the subtext here is a direct reference to [[Greek mythology]] and [[Norse paganism]], re-contextualized "with the sadistic pleasure of children who take apart their dolls".<ref name="gscursa"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.321<U+2013>322</ref> The protagonist Fuchs is an eminently musical creature, who came into the world not out of his mother's womb, but through his grandmother's ear. At the conservatory, he turns into "the perfect [[Chord (music)|chord]]", but out of modesty spends most of his education hiding at the bottom of a piano. Puberty comes and he grows "some kind of genitalia"<U+2014>in fact a "[[fig leaf]]" which keeps rejuvenating. The actual story begins on the one night Fuchs spends in the open air: under the spell of its mysteries, the composer finds his way into Traian Street (Bucharest's [[red-light district]]). 

There, a group of "[[Vestal Virgin|vestals]]" whisks him away, praying to be shown the beauty of "immaterial love" and begging him to play a [[sonata]]. His music is heard by the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and she is instantly "defeated by passion", asking Fuchs to join her on [[Mount Olympus]]. The act of lovemaking between clueless, overanxious Fuchs and the giant goddess is a disaster, particularly after the former decides to enter his whole body into Venus' ear. The embarrassed and angered audience humiliates the guest and banishes him to [[Venus|the planet Venus]]; merciful [[Athena]] allows him to return home, but on condition he does not reproduce. However, Fuchs still decides to spend some of his time practicing his lovemaking on Traian Street, hoping that Venus will grant him a second chance, and believing that he and the goddess could breed a race of [[<U+00DC>bermensch|Supermen]]. In the end, the prostitutes also reject his advances, deeming him a "dirty [[satyr]]", no longer capable of immaterial love. The story ends with Fuchs' flight to into "boundless nature", whence his music "has been beaming away with equal force in all directions", fulfilling his destiny as an enemy of inferior art.<ref>Deligiorgis edition, p.72<U+2013>91. See also Sandqvist, p.230<U+2013>233</ref>

Urmuz's story has been variously described as his praise of [[artistic freedom]],<ref name="gumartie"/> and more precisely as an ironic take on his own biography as a failed musician.<ref name="spsolitary"/><ref>Sandqvist, p.230<U+2013>233</ref> On a more transparent level, it references classical composer [[Theodor Fuchs (composer)|Theodor Fuchs]], depicted by posterity as a "puberal" and "clumsy" man, and known as a disgraced favorite of [[List of Romanian consorts|Romanian Queen-Consort]] [[Elisabeth of Wied]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.231<U+2013>233</ref> "The Fuchsiad" may also contain [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] nods to ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.<ref name="spsolitary"/>

==="Emil Gayk" and "Going Abroad"===
The "Emil Gayk" sketch was the only one which is precisely dated to the early stages of World War I, focusing its satire on the debates of neutralists and interventionists.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.343. According to Sandqvist (p.230), the story "indirectly refers to the author's own experiences
during the war".</ref> Gayk, the ever-vigilant, gun-tauting, bird-like civilian, who sleeps in his [[tailcoat]] but otherwise wears only a [[festoon]]ed drape, swims about in just one direction ("for fear of coming out of his neutrality") and gets inspired by the military muses. His career is in foreign relations, which he revolutionizes with such novel ideas as the negotiated annexation of a [[One-dimensional space|unidimensional]], arrow-like, territory at [[N<U+0103>s<U+0103>ud]]<U+2014>pointed toward [[Luxembourg]], in memory of the [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War I|1914 invasion]]. Gayk has an adoptive daughter, educated on his behalf by waiters, who makes her home in the fields and eventually demands access to the sea. Angered by this claim, Gayk begins a large-scale war against her; the conflict ends in a stalemate, as Gayk can no longer accessorize his marshal's uniform, and the girl has lost her supplies of gasoline and beans. The father is placated with regular gifts of [[feed grain]], whereas the daughter is allowed a two-centimeter-wide littoral.<ref>Deligiorgis edition, p.30<U+2013>37. See also Sandqvist, p.20, 230</ref> 

In its subtext, "Emil Gayk" teases the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] ambitions of the interventionist camp, in respect to [[Transylvania]] province. Urmuz quotes a humorous slogan, circulated as a lampoon of nationalist attitudes: "Transylvania without the Transylvanians". This probably references the fact that, although Romanian by culture or ethnicity, many Transylvanian intellectuals were primarily the loyal subjects of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Adrian Marino]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Nationalismul-provincial*articleID_959-articles_details.html "Na<U+0163>ionalismul provincial"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 88, October 2001</ref> According to Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, the actual purpose is to overturn "ossified" constructs, as in the case of territorial demands which cover no real surface.<ref>Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.56</ref> Similarly, <U+015E>erban speaks about "Emil Gayk" as a piece in which magnified "paltry aspects" and "anomalies" are supposed to send the reader into a "state of vigil".<ref name="gscursa"/>

The plot of "Going Abroad" depicts someone's convoluted attempt to leave the country for good. The unnamed seven-year-old "he" in the story settles his scores with the assistance of "two old ducks" and embarks for the voyage, only to be pulled back in by "paternal feelings"; he consequently isolates himself in a tiny room, where he converts to Judaism, punishes his servants, celebrates his [[Silver Jubilee]], and rethinks his escape. His wife, jealous of his contacts with a seal, decides against it, but offers him various parting gifts: [[flatbread]], a [[kite]], and a sketchbook by art teacher Borgovanu. This results in a quarrel, and the protagonist finds himself tied by the cheekbones, "delivered unceremoniously on dry land." For a third attempt at leaving, the husband relinquishes wealth and titles, strips down and, bound with a bark rope, gallops to another town, joining the [[bar association]].<ref>Deligiorgis edition, p.38<U+2013>42</ref> The story ends with a rhyming "moral":

"Going Abroad" is possibly about Urmuz's own difficulties in deciding his own fate, transposed into a faux sample of [[travel literature]], an example of what Balot<U+0103> calls the failed ''homo viator'' ("human pilgrim") in Urmuz.<ref name="ipcalatoriile"/>

===Unclassified prose===
Two samples of Urmuz's prose have been traditionally seen as his secondary, less relevant, contributions. These are "After the Storm" and the posthumous "A Little Metaphysics and Astronomy".<ref name="svgrummer"/> In the former, an unnamed cavalier makes his way into a grim monastery, his heart moved at the sight of a pious hen; the repentant man then finds "ecstasy" in nature, leaping through the trees or releasing captive flies. Agents of the [[revenue service]] make efforts to confiscate his tree, but the protagonist is still able to squat on one of the branches after he gives proof of [[naturalization]], and then<U+2014>swimming his way through an "infected pond"<U+2014>shames his adversaries into giving up their claim. Born-again as a cynic, strengthened by his affair with the hen, he heads back to his "native village" to train folks in the "art of [[midwifery]]."<ref>Deligiorgis edition, p.64<U+2013>69. See also Sandqvist, p.223<U+2013>224</ref> According to critics, "After the Storm" should be seen as a caricature of minor [[Romanticism]], of conventional fantasy, or of travel literature.<ref name="svgrummer"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.383</ref> Simona Vasilache likens it to "an ''[[Odyssey]]'' covering some twenty lines", "a misalliance of heroism and pilferage" with echoes from Urmuz's hero [[Ion Luca Caragiale]].<ref>{{ro icon}} Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/mica_odisee "Mica Odisee"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 22-23/2010</ref>

"A Little Metaphysics and Astronomy", which is structured like a treatise, opens with a pun on the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation narrative]], postulating that God created [[fingerspelling]] before "the Word", and venturing to suggest that "the heavenly bodies", like abandoned children, are in fact nobody's creation, that their spin is really a form of [[attention seeking]]. Here, Urmuz questions the possibility of a single cause in the universe, since God's interest is in unnecessary duplications or multitudes in stars, men and fish species.<ref>Deligiorgis edition, p.92<U+2013>95</ref> Beyond the jokes on scientific pretense, Vasilache reads "A Little Metaphysics..." as a clue to Urmuz's own disillusioned worldview, which she traces back to the suicidal warnings in Urmuz's notebooks. She argues that such a melancholy and lonely diarist is in contrast with Urmuz's literary persona, as known from the ''Bizarre Pages''.<ref name="svgrummer"/> Likewise, Carmen Blaga describes the text as a sober meditation on "the tragic sense of history" and "the fall into [[temporality]]".<ref>Blaga, p.326</ref>

Among the last Urmuzian works to be discovered is "Cotadi and Dragomir". The first in the duo is a muscular but short and insect-like merchant, who wears dandruff, [[Tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]] combs, a [[lath]] armor which greatly hiders his movements, and a piano lid screwed to his buttocks. The descendant of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] nobility, Cotadi feeds on ant eggs and excretes [[Carbonated water|soda water]], except when he corks himself to solve the "[[Land reform in Romania|agrarian question]]". For fun, he lures his clients into angry conversations<U+2014>these end with him banging the piano lid, which is also a urinating wall, on the shop's floor. Dragomir is long, crooked, brownish and kind-hearted; he intervenes in the disputes between Cotadi and the more stubborn customers, imposing respect with his main prop: a cardboard contraption that extends upwards from his neck. Cotadi rewards such attentions with servings of octopus, [[Sorbus domestica|sorb-pears]] and paint, granting Dragomir the right to nest inside his gate wall. They plan to be buried together, "in the same hole", with French oil as a daily supply. From such an oily grave, Cotadi hopes, an olive tree plantation may spring up, to benefit of his descendants.<ref>Deligiorgis edition, p.44<U+2013>53. See also Sandqvist, p.20<U+2013>21, 230</ref> Like "Algazy & Grummer", "Cotadi and Dragomir" can be read as alluding to the triteness of business life.<ref name="gumartie"/>

==="The Chroniclers"===
Written in the manner of [[fable]]s, but lacking any directly interpretable message, Urmuz's "The Chroniclers" referenced [[Aristotle]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and the turn-of-the-century [[Balkans|Balkan]] insurgent [[Boris Sarafov]] (''Sarafoff''). Its opening lines suggest that the eponymous chroniclers, for lack of baggy pants, approach someone with the surname "[[Rapaport]]" and demand to be issued passports.<ref>Ciprian, p.62; Deligiorgis edition, p.96, 97</ref> The lyrical convention breaks down toward the end, which states:
{| width="40%"

Ciprian simply discussed the piece as "Urmuz's idiotic lyrics",<ref name="gc114"/> while C<U+0103>linescu found it a "pure fable, on the classical canon, but nonsensical".<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.888; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.353</ref> Cernat also described its "moral" as "empty" and "[[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]]",<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.191</ref> but other critics see a hidden layer of meaning in the seemingly random cultural imagery. [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], commenting on Urmuz's [[hypertextuality]], assumes that the "pelican and pouchbill" motif comes from a book once used as teaching aid.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.391</ref> He also suggests that the passion and hunger which ties together the various characters is in fact the thirst for freedom, for movement and for exotic settings: "Rapaport" is the [[Wandering Jew]], Aristotle is the mentor of [[Alexander the Great|a great conqueror]], and Galilei is invoked for his remark "[[Eppur si muove|And yet it moves]]".<ref name="ipcalatoriile"/> The mention of "Sarafoff" has been read as an indirect homage to Caragiale<U+2014>whose humorous sketches helped give Sarafov a Romanian fame.<ref name="ipcalatoriile"/><ref name="ipromeur">{{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=16&nr=325 "Avangarda rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>, avangarda european<U+0103>"], in ''[[Cuv<U+00E2>ntul (literary magazine)|Cuv<U+00E2>ntul]]'', Nr. 325</ref><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.372, 390</ref>

==Legacy==
===''Contimporanul'' circle===
Paul Cernat notes that the Cirivi<U+015F>'s "posthumous destiny", leading to an unexpected glorification, was itself an "Urmuzian" affair.<ref name="pc340"/> Cernat also cautions that the image of Urmuz as an absolute predecessor of Romanian modernism is "erroneous", since the experiments of Jarry, [[Charles Cros]], [[Jules Laforgue]], [[Edward Lear]] and others were just as important in its formative process.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.341</ref> He concludes that the avant-garde "apologetes" were projecting their own expectations into the ''Bizarre Pages'', in which they read the antithesis of "High Romanticism", and into the writer, who became Romanian version of a ''[[po<U+00E8>te maudit]]''.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.341<U+2013>342, 346</ref> Ion Pop also suggests: "In [Urmuz's] human destiny, and in his writing too, [the avant-garde writers] find issues which trouble them as well in prefiguring their own destinies. He satisfies the pride of those who carry on with an uncertain and anxious existence, endlessly in conflict with the world..."<ref name="viieri&azi"/> According to Andru: "Enthusiastic, ingenious, skeptical, rhetorical, or indecent words have been uttered about [the ''Bizarre Pages'']. People used terms having to do with the literary revolutions of the 20th century [...]. In his pages people found themes present in all the innovating actions that gained momentum especially since 1922<U+2013>1924".<ref name="vainnovator"/>

Cernat describes the growth of Urmuz's myth as similar to [[Early Christianity]]: Ciprian as a "prophet", Arghezi as a "baptist", the modernist aficionados as "apostles" and "converts".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.342<U+2013>351, 357</ref> Over time, various exegetes have noted that the modernist aspects of Arghezi's prose, written after 1923, show his debt to Urmuz's absurdism and [[Surreal humour|nonsense humor]].<ref name="gscursa"/><ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.690, 815; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.334, 345, 348, 351, 377; Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.57; {{ro icon}} Loredana Ilie, [http://www.philologica-jassyensia.ro/upload/VI_2_Ilie%20L..pdf "Hipotextul caragialian <U+00EE>n opera lui Tudor Arghezi"], in the [[University of Ia<U+015F>i]]'s ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Nr. 2/2010, p.87, 90</ref> Arghezi's ''[[Bilete de Papagal]]'' review was also a promotional instrument for the ''Bizarre Pages'': in 1928, continuing the ''Cuget Rom<U+00E2>nesc'' project, it circulated "Algazy & Grummer".<ref name="gscursa"/><ref name="ctinainte"/><ref name="oc55"/><ref name="svcotcari"/>

While his role as a pre-Dadaist is up for debate, Urmuz is thought by many to have been a considerable influence on a Romanian founder of Dada, [[Tristan Tzara]].<ref name="ipromeur"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.110, 128<U+2013>129, 341, 343, 346, 367<U+2013>368; Sandqvist, p.209, 227, 234<U+2013>235, 248</ref><ref name="lgredescop">{{ro icon}} [[Liviu Gr<U+0103>soiu]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/GRASOIUdec7.html "Redescoperire"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', December 2007</ref> During its first years, the Romanian avant-garde would generally not mention Urmuz outside Arghezi's circle, but a surge in popularity came in stages after the European-wide impact of Dadaism, and especially after Tzara alienated some of his Romanian partners. This was the case of poet [[Ion Vinea]] and painter [[Marcel Janco]], who together founded a modernist art magazine called ''[[Contimporanul]]''. Late in 1924, ''Contimporanul'' teamed up with Ciprian, who gave a public reading from Urmuz during the ''Contimporanul'' International Art Exhibit.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.156</ref> 

The following year, Ciprian's eponymous text "Hurmuz", published in ''Contimporanul'', listed the main claims about Urmuz's pioneering role.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.342<U+2013>343</ref> Also then, the Futurist journal ''[[Punct (magazine)|Punct]]'', a close ally of Vinea and Janco, gave exposure to various unknown Urmuzian pages.<ref name="gscursa"/><ref>Sandqvist, p.230</ref> In December 1926, a ''Contimporanul'' editorial signed by Vinea announced to the world that Urmuz was "the discreet revolutionist" responsible for the reshaping of Europe's literary landscape: "Urmuz-Dada-Surrealism, these three words create a bridge, decipher a parentage, clarify the origins of the world's literary revolution in the year 1918."<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.128<U+2013>129, 343; {{ro icon}} [[Cornel Ungureanu]], [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/mai2007.pdf "Ion Vinea <U+015F>i iubirile paralele ale poe<U+0163>ilor"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 5/2007, p.2</ref> In its coverage of the international scene, the journal continued to suggest that the suicidal author had anticipated the literary fronde, for instance calling [[Michel Seuphor]] a writer "<U+00E0> la Urmuz".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.217</ref> In addition to republishing some of the ''Bizarre Pages'' in its own issues, it took the initiative in making Urmuz known to an international audience: the Berlin-based magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'' included samples from Urmuz in its special issue Romania (August<U+2013>September 1930), reflecting a ''Contimporanul'' who's who list.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.221, 362, 367; Grigorescu, p.389</ref> At around the same time, poet [[Jen<U+0151> Dsida]] completed the integral translation of the ''Bizarre Pages'' into [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].<ref>{{ro icon}} Drago<U+015F> Varga-Santai, [http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/arhiva/2006/pdf/numarul11-12/p56-57.pdf "Poezia maghiar<U+0103> din Ardeal <U+00EE>n traducerea lui Kocsis Francisko"], in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 11-12/2006, p.57</ref>

Its main contributors, including Pan<U+0103>, [[Geo Bogza]], [[Ilarie Voronca]], [[Ion C<U+0103>lug<U+0103>ru]], [[Moldov]] and [[Stephan Roll]], were all Urmuz enthusiasts from the far left.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.889; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.322, 331, 335, 339, 344, 345<U+2013>346, 347, 348, 349, 382, 404; {{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna166.pdf "Moldov, pe urmele lui Urmuz"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 166, August 2009, p.11, 15</ref> In 1930, Pan<U+0103> collected and published as a volume the complete works of Urmuz: titled ''Algazy & Grummer'', it notably included "The Fuchsiad".<ref name="ctinainte"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.343, 344; Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.55, 570, 640</ref> Pan<U+0103> and Bogza visited the unpublished archive, which gave them a chance to acknowledge, but also to silence, the more conventional and antisemitic Urmuz revealed through the aphorisms.<ref name="pceretic"/> These manuscripts were kept in possession by the Pan<U+0103> family, and exhibited in 2009.<ref name="cgtraim"/>

Bogza was previously editor of a short-lived magazine named ''Urmuz'', published in [[C<U+00E2>mpina]] with support from poet [[Alexandru Tudor-Miu]], and keeping contact with other Urmuzian circles: it was saluted by Arghezi and published a drawing portrait of Urmuz (probably Marcel Janco's).<ref name="pc344"/> Bogza's first editorial piece proclaimed: "Urmuz lives.

===''The Drake's Head''===
By the late 1930s, Ciprian had also established himself as a leading modernist dramatist and director, with plays such as ''[[The Man and His Mule]]''. Although his work in the field is described as the product of 1920s [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionist theater]],<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.271; Grigorescu, p.423<U+2013>424</ref> he was sometimes branded a [[Plagiarism|plagiarist]] of his dead friend's writings. This claim was traced back to Arghezi, and was probably a [[publicity stunt]] meant to increase Urmuz's exposure,<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.342, 344<U+2013>345. See also C<U+0103>linescu, p.921</ref> but taken with seriousness by another opinion maker, journalist [[Constantin Beldie]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/dezvluirile_lui_constantin_beldie "Dezv<U+0103>luirile lui Constantin Beldie"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 46/2000</ref> The ensuing scandal was amplified by the young Dadaists and Surrealists, who took the rumor to be true: Avramescu-Uranus, himself accused of plagiarizing Urmuz, made an ironic reference to this fact in a 1929 contribution to ''Bilete de Papagal''.<ref name="mvbariergarda"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.344<U+2013>345</ref> Unwittingly, Arghezi's allegations cast a shadow of doubt on Ciprian's overall work for the stage.<ref name="rcargumente"/>

''[[The Drake's Head]]''<ref>Summarized in Ciprian, p.373<U+2013>411</ref> was Ciprian's personal homage to the ''pahuci'': it shows a grown-up Cirivi<U+015F>, the main protagonist, returning from a trip abroad and reuniting with his cronies during an overnight party. The ''Drake's Head'' brotherhood spends the small hours of the morning bullying passers-by, chasing them "like birds of prey" and pestering them with absurd proposals. Quite jaded and interested in wrecking the very "pillars of logic", Cirivi<U+015F> convinces his friends to follow him on a more daring stunt: trespassing private property, they take over an apple tree and treat it as a new home. Claiming that land ownership only covers the actual horizontal plane, they even strike out an agreement with the stupefied owner. Nevertheless, a pompous and indignant "Bearded Gentleman" takes up the cause of propriety and incites the [[Romanian Police]] to intervene. The play premiered in early 1940. The original cast included [[Nicolae B<U+0103>lt<U+0103><U+0163>eanu]] as Cirivi<U+015F> and [[Ion Finte<U+015F>teanu]] as Macferlan, with additional appearances by [[Ion Manu (actor)|Ion Manu]], [[Eugenia Popovici]], [[Chiril Economu]].<ref>Ciprian, p.261<U+2013>261, 408<U+2013>410</ref> 

Cernat sees ''The Drake's Head'' as a sample of Urmuzian mythology: "Cirivi<U+015F> [...] is shown as a quasi-mythological figure, the boss of a parodic-subversive fellowship which seeks to rehabilitate a poetic, innocent, apparently absurd freedom".<ref name="pc342"/> According to Cernat, it remains Ciprian's only truly "nonconformist" play, particularly since it is indebted to "the absurd Urmuzian comedy".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.271</ref> Some have identified the "Bearded Gentleman" as [[Nicolae Iorga]], the traditionalist culture critic<U+2014>the claim was later dismissed as mere "innuendo" by Ciprian, who explained that his creation stood for all "[[demagogue]]" politicians of the day.<ref>Ciprian, p.408, 410<U+2013>411</ref>

===Communist ban and diaspora recovery===
Upon the end of World War II, Romania came under [[Communist Romania|communist rule]], and a purge of interwar modernist values followed: Urmuz's works were among the many denied imprimatur by the 1950s. Before [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] became complete, Urmuz still found disciples in the last wave of the avant-garde. Cited examples include [[Geo Dumitrescu]],<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.381<U+2013>382</ref> [[Dimitrie Stelaru]]<ref>{{ro icon}} Veronica-Alina Const<U+0103>nceanu, [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/noiembrie2009.pdf "Dimitrie Stelaru, dramaturg"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 11/2009, p.11</ref> and [[Constant Tonegaru]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Daniel Vighi]], [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/noiembrie2010.pdf "Constant Tonegaru <U+00EE>n note de curs"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 11/2010, p.21</ref> Also at the time, writer [[Dinu Pillat]] donated a batch of Urmuz's manuscripts to the [[Romanian Academy Library]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.381</ref>

The anti-Urmuzian current, part of a larger [[Socialist realism in Romania|anti-modernist campaign]], found an unexpected backer in George C<U+0103>linescu, who became a [[fellow traveler]] of communism. In his new interpretation, the ''Bizarre Pages'' were depicted as farcical and entirely worthless.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.354<U+2013>356</ref> For a while, the ''Bizarre Pages'' were only cultivated by the [[Romanian diaspora]]. Having discovered the book in interwar Romania, the dramatist and culture critic [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Ionesco]] made it his mission to highlight the connections between Urmuz and European modernism. Ionesco's work for the stage, a major contribution to the international [[Theater of the Absurd]] movement, consciously drew upon various sources, including the Romanians [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and Urmuz. The contextual importance of such influences, which remain relatively unknown to Ionesco's international audience, has been assessed differently by the various exegetes,<ref name="gscursa"/><ref name="caragialeazi"/><ref name="ctinainte"/><ref name="scpersonaj"/><ref>[[Lucian Boia]], ''Romania: Borderland of Europe'', [[Reaktion Books]], London, 2001, p.261.

===From Onirism to the ''Optzeci<U+015F>ti''===
In the 1950s and '60s, a literary underground, reacting against the communist worldview, began to emerge at various locations in Romania.

Although the ban on Urmuz was still in place, George Ciprian made a daring (and possibly subversive) gesture by publishing his affectionate memoirs in 1958.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.356</ref> A few years later, the episodic relaxation of communist censorship allowed for the republication of the ''Bizarre Pages'', mistakenly included in a complete edition of Ciprian's literary works (1965).<ref name="rcargumente"/> Such events heralded a revival of scholarly interest in proto-Dadaism, beginning with a 1970 monograph on Urmuz, by the [[Sibiu Literary Circle]] member [[Nicolae Balot<U+0103>]].<ref>Blaga, p.323; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.346, 357, 365<U+2013>366</ref> Also then, Pan<U+0103> was free to circulate a new revised edition of his interwar anthology, reissued in collaboration with [[Editura Minerva]].<ref name="svgrummer"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.357; Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.640</ref><ref name="ibltrei">{{ro icon}} [[Ion Bogdan Lefter]], [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=1130 "Urmuz <U+00EE>n trei tipuri de edi<U+0163>ii"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 4/2010</ref> It was later completed by an Urmuz corpus, which notably hosted the scattered diaries, as recovered by critic Gheorghe Glodeanu.<ref name="ibltrei"/> In 1972, Iordan Chimet also included "The Chroniclers" in a nonconformist anthology of [[Children's literature|youth literature]].<ref>{{ro icon}} Marina Debattista, [http://www.romlit.ro/subversiunea_inocenei "Subversiunea inocen<U+0163>ei"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 22/2007</ref> In those years, the ''Bizarre Pages'' also inspired critically acclaimed illustrations by [[Nestor Ignat]]<ref>{{ro icon}} Daria Ghiu, [http://www.revista22.ro/articol-10025.html "Nestor Ignat: realitatea <U+00EE>ntoars<U+0103> pe dos"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1094, February 2011</ref> and Ion Mincu,<ref name="svgrummer"/><ref name="ibltrei"/> and the multimedia event ''Cump<U+0103>n<U+0103>'' ("Watershed") by composer [[Anatol Vieru]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.389</ref>

With the 1960s, a [[National communism|national-communist]] ideology was officially established in Romania, and this encouraged the rise of "[[Protochronism]]" as a cultural phenomenon. The Protochronists exaggerated past Romanian achievements, and magnified previous claims about the folkloric roots of Urmuz's literature. Some Protochronists also described a positive, jocular, "[[village idiot]]" Urmuz, more presentable than Europe's misanthropic avant-garde.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.357<U+2013>358, 369, 372<U+2013>377, 385<U+2013>388, 404</ref> A leading representative of this trend was literary theorist [[Edgar Papu]], who exaggerated Vinea and Ionesco's homage to Urmuz and Caragiale to argue that Romania was the actual origin of Europe's avant-garde movements.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.358<U+2013>359, 373, 387; Mih<U+0103>ilescu, p.145<U+2013>146</ref> The idea proved popular beyond Protochronism, and was arguably found in essays by Nichita St<U+0103>nescu<ref name="pc385-386"/><ref name="ointgrns"/> and [[Marin Mincu]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.359, 360, 373<U+2013>376</ref> Many [[Europeanism|Europeanist]] intellectuals rejected Protochronism, but, in their bid of making Urmuz palatable to cultural officials, often interpreted him strictly through the grid of [[Marxist humanism]] (as used by Balot<U+0103>, [[Matei C<U+0103>linescu]] or [[Nicolae Manolescu]]).<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.364<U+2013>366, 377, 385, 404</ref> A third camp, comprising more or less vehement opponents of Urmuz, joined the literary debates after 1970; it includes [[Alexandru George]], [[Gelu Ionescu]], [[Alexandru Piru]] and [[Marin Ni<U+0163>escu]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.361, 378<U+2013>382</ref>

Some years later, Romania witnessed the birth of the ''[[Optzeci<U+015F>ti]]'' generation, whose interest was in recovering Caragiale, Urmuz and the 1930s avant-garde as its models to follow, and who reactivated corrosive humor as a way of fighting oppression.<ref>Mih<U+0103>ilescu, p.215, 234</ref> Among the individual ''Optzeci<U+015F>ti'' who took special inspiration from the ''Bizarre Pages'' are [[Mircea C<U+0103>rt<U+0103>rescu]],<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Octavian Soviany]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=6&nr=327 "A doua carte a nostalgiei"], in ''[[Cuv<U+00E2>ntul (literary magazine)|Cuv<U+00E2>ntul]]'', Nr. 327</ref> [[Nichita Danilov]],<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Adina Dini<U+0163>oiu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Goana-dupa-metafizica-literaturii*articleID_19248-articles_details.html "Goana dup<U+0103> metafizica literaturii"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 411, February 2008; [[Horia G<U+00E2>rbea]], [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=88&editie=10 "Monolog politic <U+00EE>n tramvaiul 5"], in ''[[Luceaf<U+0103>rul (magazine)|Luceaf<U+0103>rul]]'', Nr. 7/2008; [[Alex. <U+015E>tef<U+0103>nescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nichita_danilov_poet_i_prozator "Nichita Danilov, poet <U+015F>i prozator"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 10/2008; [[Eugenia <U+0162>ar<U+0103>lung<U+0103>]], [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/53_viata-romaneasca-8-9-2008/30_miscellanea/118_miscellanea.html "Miscellanea.

===Postmodern Urmuzianism===
A noted rise in interest for Urmuzian literature followed in the wake of the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]]. In 2011, a poll among Romanian literati, organized by ''[[Observator Cultural]]'' review, listed "The Funnel and Stamate" as the 22nd-best Romanian novel; this rekindled polemics about whether the work should even be considered a novel.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/150-de-romane*articleID_3918-articles_details.html "150 de romane"], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Clasamente-si-comentarii-%28IV%29*articleID_5684-articles_details.html "Clasamente <U+015F>i comentarii (IV)"], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Clasamente-si-comentarii-%28V%29*articleID_5685-articles_details.html "Clasamente <U+015F>i comentarii (V)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 45-46, January 2001; [[<U+015E>tefan Agopian]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Se-putea-si-mai-bine*articleID_3384-articles_details.html "Se putea <U+015F>i mai bine"], in ''Observator Cultural'', Nr. 54, March 2001</ref> With the appearance of new "alternative" schoolbooks during the 1990s, Urmuz earned more exposure as an optional addition to the [[Education in Romania|standard curriculum]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.381; {{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Ofensiva-manualelor-alternative-%28II%29*articleID_5005-articles_details.html "Ofensiva manualelor alternative (II)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 31, September 2000; [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INVATAMINT.-Referinte-critice-despre-proza-romaneasca*articleID_1438-articles_details.html "<U+00CE>nv<U+0103><U+0163><U+0103>m<U+00E2>nt.
