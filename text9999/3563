'''Marzemina bianca''' is a white [[Italian wine]] [[grape variety]] that is grown in the [[Veneto (wine)|Veneto]] region of northeastern Italy. [[Ampelographers]] believe that the grape is a natural [[crossing (plant)|crossing]] of the [[Trentino wine]] grape [[Marzemino]] and the [[Soave wine]] grape [[Garganega]]. This parent-offspring relationship between Marzemina bianca and Marzemino makes the variety distinct from grapes like [[Pinot blanc]] and [[Grenache blanc]] which are other color [[mutation]]s of [[Pinot noir]] and [[Grenache]], respectively. [[DNA analysis]] has confirmed that the Veneto grape [[Raboso Veronese]] is the offspring of Marzemina bianca and [[Raboso Piave]].<ref name="Wine Grapes">J. Robinson, J. Harding and J.

Despite having the synonyms ''Champagna'' and ''Champagne''<ref name="VIVC">[[Vitis International Variety Catalogue]]: [http://www.vivc.de/datasheet/dataResult.php?data=16944 Marzemina bianca], accessed April 23rd, 2013</ref> Marzemina bianca is not grown in the [[French wine]] region of [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]] and is not used in the production of [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] nor does the grape appear to have any known relation to the traditional Champagne wine grapes of [[Chardonnay]], Pinot noir and [[Pinot Meunier]]. While the grape is usually used as a blending component in still wines and [[late harvest (wine)|late harvest]] ''[[passito]]'' style wines, one producer in the Veneto does make a lightly [[sparkling (wine)|sparkling]] ''frizzante'' version of the grape under the synonym ''Sampagne'' that is classified as a ''[[vino da tavola]]''.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==History==
[[File:Uva Garganega.jpg|left|thumb|Garganega, one of the parent varieties of Marzemina bianca.]]
For many years the exact origins of Marzemina bianca were unknown. The grape was first mentioned in 1679 when the Italian writer [[Giacomo Agostinetti]] described Marzemina bianca growing around the town of [[Breganze]] in the [[province of Vicenza]] in Veneto. It was speculated by early ampelographers that the grape may have originated in the [[Burgundy wine]] region and found its way to Italy via [[Germany (wine)|Germany]] and [[Switzerland (wine)|Switzerland]]. However, in 2008 DNA evidence showed that there was a parent-offspring relationship between Marzemina bianca and the Trentino grape Marzemino. As Marzemino was first documented growing in the Veneto in 1553, more than a hundred years before Marzemina bianca, ampelographers now believe that Marzeminia bianca is the offspring with further DNA profiling showing that the Soave grape Garganega (described by the Italian writer [[Pietro de' Crescenzi]] in the 13th century) likely being the other parent.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Viticulture and winemaking==
Marzemina bianca is a [[ripeness (wine)|mid-ripening]] variety that is often allowed to hang on the vine long after [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] have fully accumulated to allow [[Desiccation|water from the grapes to evaporate]] and make [[sweet (wine)|sweet]] [[late-harvest wines]]. To further concentrate the sugars, after [[harvest (wine)|harvest]] the grapes are laid out on straw mats or hung in well ventilated drying rooms to produce the [[straw wine]] style known as ''passito''.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Wine regions==
[[File:Torcolato Breganze DOC, Firmino Miotti.jpg|right|thumb|Marzemina is a permitted grape variety allowed to be blended with Vespaiola in the ''passito'' straw wine of the Breganze DOC known as ''Torcolato''.]]
Marzemina bianca was once widely planted throughout the Veneto region but its numbers took a toll when the [[phylloxera epidemic]] hit Italy in the late 19th century. In 2000, there were 83 [[hectare]]s (205 acres) of the grape reported in Italy, most of it in found in the [[Padova (province)|Padova]], Vicenza and [[Treviso province]]s.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

It is a permitted grape variety in the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) wines of [[Breganze (DOC)|Breganze]] in the Vicenza province where it is blended with [[Vespaiola]] in late-harvest ''Torcolato'' wines. In the province of Treviso it is used in the ''passito'' wines of the [[Colli di Conegliano DOC]] where it is blended with [[Glera (grape)|Glera]], [[Verdiso]] and [[Verdicchio]].<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Styles==
Though Marzemina bianca is most often used in the production of sweet late-harvest wines, it can also be produced as dry [[varietal]] or slightly-sparkling ''frizzante'' wine. These wines are usually produced as ''vino da tavola''. According to [[Master of Wine]] [[Jancis Robinson]], wines made from Marzemina bianca tend to be [[body (wine)|light bodied]] with [[aroma]] notes of hay and apple that can sometimes have a slightly bitter aftertaste.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Relationship and confusion with other grapes==
In addition to the parent-offspring relationship with Marzemino and Garganega, DNA evidence has shown that Marzemina bianca likely crossed with the Veneto grape Raboso Piave to make Raboso Veronese.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

Marzemina bianca has several synonyms such as ''Champagne'' and ''Champagna''<ref name="VIVC"/> that would suggest some relationship to the French wine region or the grapes used to make the notable French sparkling wine of the same name. But currently DNA evidence has shown no such relationship nor is there a historical connection to the region and its grape varieties. Marzemina bianca is also sometimes confused with [[Chasselas]] which originated in Switzerland but is grown in many European wine regions and has the name ''Marzemina bianca'' as a synonym. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest a relationship between the two varieties.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Synonyms==
Over the years Marzemina bianca has been known under various synonyms including: Berzemina di Breganze, Champagna, Champagne, Sampagne and Sciampagna.<ref name="VIVC"/><ref name="Wine Grapes"/>
