'''Jean-Marie Bienaim<U+00E9> Bonnassieux''' (1810<U+2013>1892) was a [[France|French]] [[sculptor]].

The son of a [[cabinet maker]] from [[Lyon]], Bonnassieux showed talent as a boy and was educated at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]], Paris, under [[Augustin-Alexandre Dumont]].  In 1836 he was the co-winner (with [[Auguste Ottin]]) of the ''[[Prix de Rome]]''.  Bonnassieux subsequently taught at the Ecole, and among his students in the 1880s was the young [[United States|American]] [[Lorado Taft]], and the British-American sculptor [[Henry Hudson Kitson]]. Bonnassieux is set in the context of rigid French academic training in the 19th century in a study of the careers of seventeen winners of the ''Prix de Rome'' by A. Le Normand, ''La Tradition Classique et l'Esprit Romantique: Les sculpteurs de l'acad<U+00E9>mie de France <U+00E0> Rome de 1824 <U+00E0> 1840'' (Rome, 1991).   

Bonnassieux is buried at [[Montparnasse Cemetery]].
