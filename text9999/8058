"'''Burns' Heir'''" is the eighteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 5)|fifth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on April 14, 1994. In the episode, [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] has a near-death experience which prompts him to find an heir to inherit his wealth after he dies. Although [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is initially rejected, Burns soon decides to choose him after seeing him as "a creature of pure malevolence". Marge convinces Bart to go spend some time with Burns, and soon becomes more disruptive than normal to his own family and decides to go live with Mr. Burns.

"Burns' Heir" was written by [[Jace Richdale]], his only writing credit. [[David Silverman]] was originally going to direct the episode, but he was so swamped with his work as supervising director that it was re-assigned to [[Mark Kirkland]]. While the Simpsons are at a movie, there is a parody of the [[THX]] sound [[Deep Note]]. The THX executives liked the parody so much that the scene was made into an actual THX movie trailer, with the scene being redone for the [[widescreen]] aspect ratio. A deleted scene from the episode sees Mr. Burns release a "Robotic [[Richard Simmons]]" as a way of getting rid of Homer. The scene was cut, but later included in the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]] clip show "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]".

==Plot==
[[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] almost drowns while taking a bath and he later realizes that no one will carry on his legacy when he dies. He decides to try to find an heir that will inherit his vast fortune. He holds an audition and many of the boys in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] try out, including [[Nelson Muntz]], [[Martin Prince]] and [[Milhouse Van Houten]]. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] also try out and fail; Lisa [[Sexism|because she is a girl]] (with Milhouse abandoning his plan to return to the stage dressed as a girl after overhearing Mr. Burns) and Bart because he read [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s badly-worded proposal, allegedly claiming that Bart is sick and needs "money now" with Burns spelt as "Curns". Angry and humiliated after the audition ends, only made worse by Burns kicking him up the "[[Anus|butt]]" with a mechanical boot, which makes Homer burst into hysterics, Bart vandalizes Mr. Burns's house. Mr. Burns approves of Bart's [[malevolence]] and decides to accept him as his heir.

[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] sign a legal document which officially names Bart as Mr. Burns' heir. Marge suggests that Bart should spend some time with Mr. Burns. While initially repelled by Mr. Burns' coldness, Bart begins to take a liking to him after Burns promises to give Bart whatever he wants out of life. Bart decides to abandon his family because Mr. Burns allows him to do anything he likes. His family becomes angry and wants Bart back, so they decide to sue Mr. Burns, but the case does not turn out in their favor. The Simpsons get a deprogrammer to kidnap Bart, but the deprogrammer takes [[Hans Moleman]] instead and brainwashes him into thinking he's a part of the Simpson family.

Meanwhile, Bart becomes lonely and wants to go back to his family. Mr. Burns does not want him to leave and tricks him into thinking that his family hates him, using a falsified video with actors playing the Simpson family. Bart decides that Burns is his true father and the two celebrate by firing employees at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. However, one of the employees is Homer and Mr. Burns then tries to break Bart's ties with his family by forcing him to fire Homer. Bart instead "fires" Burns and drops him through a trap door. He decides that he loves his family, and moves back in with them.

"Burns' Heir" was the episode in which [[Jace Richdale]] received a writers' credit, although he was a part of the show's staff for several seasons. When he was starting out as a writer on the show, Richdale was told to come up with some story ideas and he came up with the basic plot off the top of his head.<ref name="Richdale">Richdale, Jace.

A deleted scene from the episode sees Mr. Burns release a "Robotic [[Richard Simmons]]" as a way of getting rid of Homer, which dances to a recording of [[K.C. and the Sunshine Band]]'s "[[(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty|Shake Your Booty]]". Simmons was originally asked to guest star, according to [[David Mirkin]], he was "dying to do the show", but declined when he found out he would voice a robot.<ref name="Mirkin"/> It was fully animated, but was cut from "Burns' Heir" because it often did not get a good reaction during table reads.<ref name="Mirkin"/> According to [[Bill Oakley]], there was a "significant division of opinion amongst the staff as to whether Richard Simmons was a target ''The Simpsons'' should make fun of" because it was "well-trod territory."<ref name="Oakley"/> They also felt it distracted viewers from the story.<ref name="Mirkin"/>  To the production staff's surprise, the scene would make the audience "erupt with laughter" when screened at animation conventions and college presentations, so they decided to insert it in the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]] clip show "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]".<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that, "the episode lacks the emotional punch of others in which members of the family are separated."<ref name="BBC"/> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that the episode was "such a great concept that it<U+2019>s a surprise no [one] went for it earlier." He felt that it "occasionally veers on the edge of mushiness, but it avoids becoming too sentimental. It's a blast to see Burns<U+2019> world from Bart<U+2019>s point of view.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-05-05|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonfive.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season (1993)  |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=2004-12-21 |author=Jacobson, Colin }}</ref> [[DVD Talk]] gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-05-05|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13784/simpsons-the-complete-fifth-season-the/ |title=The Simpsons - The Complete Fifth Season |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] |date=2004-12-21 |author=Gibron, Bill }}</ref> while DVD Verdict gave the episode a Grade B score.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-05-05 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason5.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=2005-02-23 |author=Bromley, Judge Patrick }}</ref> Paul Campos of ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' described the Robotic Richard Simmons scene as "a level of surreal comedy that approaches a kind of genius."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Simpsons' charm is in telling truth|author=Campos, Paul|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|date=2000-01-11}}</ref>
