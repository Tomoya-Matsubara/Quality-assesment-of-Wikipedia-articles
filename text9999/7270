Timur was in his lifetime a controversial figure, and remains so today. He sought to restore the Mongol Empire,<ref>Beatrice Forbes Manz, ''Tem<U+00FC>r and the Problem of a Conqueror's Legacy'', '''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society''', Third Series, Vol. 8, No. 1 (Apr., 1998), 25; "''In his formal correspondance Temur continued throughout his life as the restorer of Chinggisid rights.

He was more at home in an urban environment than on the [[steppe]]. He styled himself a [[ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]] while conducting wars that severely affected some Muslim states, in particular the [[Sultanate of Delhi]].

==Early history==
Timur was born in [[Transoxiana]], in the City of Kesh (an area now better known as [[Shahrisabz]], "the green city"), some 50 miles south of [[Samarkand]] in modern [[Uzbekistan]], then part of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. His father, Taraqai, was a small-scale landowner and belonged to the [[Barlas]] tribe. The Barlas was a [[Turko-Mongol]] tribe<ref>"Central Asia, history of [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-73545 Timur]", in [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]], Online Edition, 2007.

Timur was a Muslim, but while his chief official religious counsellor and advisor was the [[Hanafite]] scholar 'Abdu 'l-Jabbar Khwarazmi, his particular persuasion is not known. In Tirmidh, he had come under the influence of his spiritual mentor [[Sayyid Barakah]], a Shiite leader from [[Balkh]] who is buried alongside Timur in [[Gur-e Amir]].<ref>The Descendants of Sayyid Ata and the Rank of Naq<U+012B>b in Central Asia by Devin DeWeese Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 115, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1995), pp. 612-634</ref><ref>Four studies on the history of Central Asia, Volume 1 By Vasilij Vladimirovi<U+010D> Bartold p.19</ref><ref>Islamic art By Barbara Brend p.130</ref> Despite his Hanafi background, Timur was known to hold [[Ali]] and the [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Shia Imams]] in high regard and has been noted by various scholars for his "pro-[[Shia Islam|Alid]]" stance. Despite this, Timur was noted for attacking Shi<U+2019>is on Sunni grounds and therefore his own religious inclinations remain unclear.<ref>Virani, Shafique N.

==Military leader==
[[Image:Timurid Dynasty 821 - 873 (AH).png|thumb|350px|right|Map of the [[Timurid Empire]]]]
In about 1360 Timur gained prominence as a military leader whose troops were mostly Turkic tribesmen of the region.<ref name="Chaliand"/><ref name="columbia">[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ti/Timur.html Timur] in The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001-2005. "Tamerlane, c.1336<U+2013>1405, Turkic conqueror, b. Kesh, near Samarkand. He is also called Timur Leng (Faisal R.). The son of a tribal leader, in 1370 Timur became an in-law of a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, when he destroyed the army of Husayn of Balkh. After the battle, he took Husayn of Balkh's widow, Saray Mulk-khanum (daughter of Qazan, the last Chaghatai Khan of Mawarannah, into his harem as his fourth wife. For the rest of his life he called himself Temur Gurgan - son-in-law- of the Great Khan Khan <Tamerlame, by Justin Marozzi>. Timur spent his early military career subduing his rivals in what is now Turkistan; by 1369 he controlled the entire area from his capital at Samarkand."</ref> He took part in campaigns in Transoxiana with [[Chagatai Khan|the Khan]] of [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]], a fellow descendant of Genghis Khan. His career for the next ten or eleven years may be thus briefly summarized from the ''Memoirs''. Allying himself both in cause and by family connection with Kurgan, the dethroner and destroyer of [[Volga Bulgaria]], he was to invade [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] at the head of a thousand horsemen. This was the second military expedition which he led, and its success led to further operations, among them the subjugation of [[Khorezm]] and [[Urgench|Urganj]].

After the murder of Kurgan the disputes which arose among the many claimants to [[sovereign]] power were halted by the invasion of the energetic Jagataite [[Tughlugh Temur]] of [[Kashgar]], another descendant of Genghis Khan. Timur was dispatched on a mission to the invader's camp, the result of which was his own appointment to the head of his own tribe, the [[Barlas]], in place of its former leader, [[Hajji Beg]].

The exigencies of Timur's quasi-sovereign position compelled him to have recourse to his formidable patron, whose reappearance on the banks of the [[Syr Darya]] created a consternation not easily allayed. The Barlas were taken from Timur and entrusted to a son of Tughluk, along with the rest of [[Mawarannahr]] (Transoxiana); but he was defeated in battle by the bold warrior he had replaced at the head of a numerically far inferior force.

==Rise to power==
[[File:Timur during attack on Balkh 1370.jpg|thumb|right|Timur commanding the [[Siege of Balkh]].]]
Tughlugh's death facilitated the work of reconquest, and a few years of perseverance and energy sufficed for its accomplishment, as well as for the addition of a vast extent of territory. It was in this period that Timur reduced the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai khans]] to the position of figureheads, who were deferred to in theory but in reality ignored, while Timur ruled in their name. During this period Timur and his brother-in-law Husayn, at first fellow fugitives and wanderers in joint adventures full of interest and romance, became rivals and antagonists. At the close of 1369 Husayn was assassinated and Timur, having been formally proclaimed sovereign at [[Balkh]], mounted the throne at Samarkand, the capital of his dominions. This event was recorded by Marlowe in his famous play ''Tamburlaine the Great'':<ref>[http://www.oxuscom.com/timursam.htm#timur The Timurid Dynasty]</ref>
{{quote|Then shall my native city, [[Samarqand]]...<br>Be famous through the furthest continents,<br>For there my palace-royal shall be placed,<br>Whose shining turrets shall dismay the heavens,<br>And cast the fame of lion's tower to hell.}}
A legendary account of Timur's rise to leadership, recorded among the [[Tatars#Siberian Tatars|Tatar]] descendants of the [[Golden Horde|Q<U+0131>pchaq Khanate]] in [[Tobolsk|Tobol]], goes as follows:<br>
One day Aksak Tem<U+00FC>r<ref>Lame Timur, Tamerlane</ref> spoke thusly:
{{quote|"Khan Z<U+00FC>dei (in China) rules over the city. We now number fifty to sixty men, so let us elect a leader."  So they drove a stake into the ground and said: "We shall run thither and he who among us is the first to reach the stake, may he become our leader". So they ran and Aksak Timur (since he was lame) lagged behind, but before the others reached the stake he threw his cap onto it. Those who arrived first said: "We are the leaders".  (But) Aksak Timur said: "My head came in first, I am the leader". In the meanwhile an old man arrived and said: "The leadership should belong to Aksak Timur; your feet have arrived but, before then, his head reached the goal". So they made Aksak Timur their prince.<ref>Sinor, D., "''XIV The Making of a Great Khan''", page 242, Studies in Medieval Inner Asia, Variorum, 1997. ISBN 0-86078-632-3</ref><ref>Radloff, W., ''Proben der Volkslitteratur der t<U+00FC>rkischen st<U+00E4>mme S<U+00FC>d-Sibiriens'', IV. St Petersburg, page 308</ref>}}
It is notable that Timur never claimed for himself the title of [[Khan (title)|khan]], styling himself [[amir]] and acting in the name of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] ruler of Transoxania. Timur was a military genius, but was sometimes lacking in political sense. He tended not to leave a government apparatus behind in lands he conquered and was often faced with the need to reconquer such lands after inevitable rebellions had taken place.

==Period of expansion==
[[File:Timur orders campaign against Georgia.jpg|thumb|upright|Timur orders [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|campaign]] against [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]

Timur spent the next 35 years in various [[List of wars|wars]] and expeditions. He not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him to the lands near the [[Caspian Sea]] and to the banks of the [[Ural River|Ural]] and the [[Volga]]. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in [[Persia]], including [[Baghdad]], [[Karbala]] and Northern Iraq.

One of the most formidable of Timur's opponents was another Mongol ruler, a descendant of Genghis Khan named [[Tokhtamysh]]. After having been a refugee in Timur's court, [[Tokhtamysh]] became ruler both of the eastern [[White Horde|Kipchak]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. After his accession, he then quarrelled with Timur over the possession of [[Khiva|Khwarizm]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. However, Timur still supported him against the Russians and in 1382 Tokhtamysh invaded the Muscovite dominion and burned [[Moscow]].<ref name="">Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 93</ref>

After the death of [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]], ruler of the [[Ilkhanid Dynasty]], in 1335, there was a power vacuum in [[Persia]]. In 1383 Timur started the military conquest of Persia. He captured [[Herat]], Khorasan and all eastern Persia by 1385 and captured almost all of Persia by 1387. These conquests were characterised by exceptional brutality. For example, when [[Isfahan]] surrendered to Timur in 1387, he initially treated it with relative mercy as he commonly did with cities that surrendered without resistance. However, after the city revolted against Timur's punitive taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur's soldiers, Timur ordered the complete massacre of the city, killing a reported 70,000 citizens. An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers, each constructed of about 1,500 heads.<ref>Fisher, W.B.; Jackson, P.; Lockhart, L.; Boyle, J.A. : The Cambridge History of Iran, p55.</ref>

In the meantime, Tokhtamysh, now khan of the [[Golden Horde]], turned against his patron and invaded [[Azerbaijan]] in 1385. This action would cause a counter by Timur that would become the [[Tokhtamysh<U+2013>Timur war]]. In the initial stage of the war, Timur won a victory at the [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]], however Tokhtamysh and some of his army were allowed to escape. After Tokhtamysh's initial defeat, Timur then invaded Muscovy to the north of Tokhtamysh's holdings. Timur's army burned [[Ryazan|Raizan]] and advanced upon Moscow, only to be pulled away before reaching the Oka River by Tokhtamysh's renewed campaign in the south.<ref name="">Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 94</ref>

In the first phase of the conflict with Tokhtamysh, Timur led an army of over 100,000 men north for more than 700 miles into the uninhabited steppe, then west about 1,000 miles, advancing in a front more than 10 miles wide. The [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] army almost starved, and Timur organized a great hunt where the army encircled vast areas of steppe to get food. It was then that Tokhtamysh's army was boxed in against the east bank of the Volga River in the [[Orenburg]] region and destroyed at the previously mentioned [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]]. During this march, Timur's army got far enough north to be in a region of [[midnight sun|very long summer days]], causing complaints by his Muslim soldiers about keeping a long schedule of [[salat|prayers]] in such northern regions.

It was in the second phase of the conflict that Timur took an easier route against the enemy, invading the realm of Tokhtamysh via the Caucasus region. The year 1395, saw the [[Battle of the Terek River]], when Tokhtamysh's power was finally broken, concluding the titanic struggle between the two monarchs.

Tokhtamysh was not able to restore his power or prestige. He was killed about a decade after the Terek River battle in the area of present day [[Tyumen]], by agents of an emir named [[Edigu]].

Timur during the course of his campaigns destroyed [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], the capital of the Golden Horde, and [[Astrakhan]], subsequently wrecking the Golden Horde's economy based on [[Silk Road]] trade. The Golden Horde saw political disintegration after such losses, with Mongol unity in the region shattered permanently.

In May 1393 Timur invaded the [[Anjudan]], crippling the [[Ismaili]] village only one year after his assault on the Ismailis in [[Mazandaran]]. The village appears to have been prepared for attack, as it contained a fortress and an intricate system of underground tunnels. These devices were, however, unsuccessful in thwarting Timur<U+2019>s soldiers, who flooded the tunnels by cutting into a channel overhead. Timur<U+2019>s reasons for attacking this village are not yet well-understood, however it has been suggested that his [[Timur#Personal life|religious persuasions]] and view of himself as an [[Timur#Indian campaign|executor of divine will]] may have contributed to his motivations.<ref name="Virani, Shafique N 2007, p. 116">Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p. 116.</ref>  The Persian historian [[Khwandamir]] explains that an Ismaili presence was growing more politically powerful in Persian [[Iraq]]. A group among the locals in this region was dissatisfied with this. Khwandamir writes that some of these locals assembled and brought up their complaint with Timur, possibly provoking his attack on the Ismailis there.<ref name="Virani, Shafique N 2007, p. 116"/>

His campaign was officially justified by claims that the Muslim Delhi Sultanate was too tolerant toward its [[Hindu]] subjects, but was motivated greatly by the considerable wealth to be gained. By all accounts, Timur's campaigns in India were marked by systematic slaughter and other atrocities on a truly massive scale inflicted mainly on the subcontinent's Hindu population.<ref>[http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/timurid.html The Islamic World to 1600: The Mongol Invasions (The Timurid Empire)]</ref>

Timur crossed the [[Indus River]] at [[Attock]] (now [[Pakistan]]) on September 24, 1398, but Timur's [[invasion]] did not go unopposed and he did meet some resistance during his march to Delhi, by the [[Governor]] of [[Meerut]]. Timur was able to continue his relentless approach to Delhi, arriving in 1398 to combat the armies of Sultan Mehmud, already weakened by a succession struggle within the royal family.

The Sultan's army was easily defeated on December 17, 1398. On this day the army of Sultan Mahmud Khan had prepared 120 war elephants armored with chain mail. He had put poison on the tusks, which put fright into the Tatar lines. Timur took action and the Tatars dug out a trench in front of their positions. Timur then took his camels and placed all the wood and hay he could on their backs. When the war elephants charged he lit the camels on fire and then prodded them with iron sticks. They charged at the elephants howling in pain: Timur had understood that elephants were easily panicked. Faced with the strange spectacle of the burning camels flying straight at them with flames leaping from their backs, the elephants turned around and stampeded back toward their own lines. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed 100,000 captives:<ref name="EI"/><ref name=packhum389/>

<blockquote>"At this Court Am<U+00ED>r Jah<U+00E1>n Sh<U+00E1>h and Am<U+00ED>r Sulaim<U+00E1>n Sh<U+00E1>h, and other am<U+00ED>rs of experience, brought to my notice that, from the time of entering Hindust<U+00E1>n up to the present time, we had taken more than 100,000 infidels and prisoners, and that they were all in my camp. On the previous day, when the enemy's forces made the attack upon us, the prisoners made signs of rejoicing, uttered imprecations against us, and were ready, as soon as they heard of the enemy's success, to form themselves into a body, break their bonds, plunder our tents, and then to go and join the enemy, and so increase his numbers and strength. I asked their advice about the prisoners, and they said that on the great day of battle these 100,000 prisoners could not be left with the baggage, and that it would be entirely opposed to the rules of war to set these idolaters and foes of Isl<U+00E1>m at liberty. In fact, no other course remained but that of making them all food for the sword. When I heard these words I found them in accordance with the rules of war, and I directly gave my command for the Taw<U+00E1>ch<U+00ED>s to proclaim throughout the camp that every man who had infidel prisoners was to put them to death, and whoever neglected to do so should himself be executed and his property given to the informer. When this order became known to the gh<U+00E1>z<U+00ED>s of Isl<U+00E1>m, they drew their swords and put their prisoners to death. 100,000 infidels, impious idolaters, were on that day slain. Maul<U+00E1>n<U+00E1> N<U+00E1>siru-d d<U+00ED>n 'Umar, a counsellor and man of learning, who, in all his life, had never killed a sparrow, now, in execution of my order, slew with his sword fifteen idolatrous Hindus, who were his captives."</blockquote>

The alleged "Memoirs" of Timur, or [[Tuzk-e-Taimuri]], relate the sack of [[Delhi]]:<ref name="EI"/><ref name=packhum389/><ref>{{Cite book|title=History of India |first=Stanley |last=Lane-Poole |year=1907 |publisher=The Grolier Society |chapter=Chapter IX: Timur's Account of His Invasion }} {{google books|4a1jSn1oQxkC|Full text}}</ref><ref>http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#Timur Death toll in wars from various sources</ref>

<blockquote>"On the 16th of the month some incidents occurred which led to the sack of the city of Delh<U+00ED>, and to the slaughter of many of the infidel inhabitants. One was this. A party of fierce Turk soldiers had assembled at one of the gates of the city to look about them and enjoy themselves, and some of them laid violent hands upon the goods of the inhabitants. When I heard of this violence, I sent some am<U+00ED>rs, who were present in the city, to restrain the Turks. A party of soldiers accompanied these am<U+00ED>rs into the city. Another reason was that some of the ladies of my harem expressed a wish to go into the city and see the palace of Haz<U+00E1>r-sut<U+00FA>n (thousand columns) which Malik Jaun<U+00E1> built in the fort called Jah<U+00E1>n-pan<U+00E1>h. I granted this request, and I sent a party of soldiers to escort the litters of the ladies. Another reason was that Jal<U+00E1>l Isl<U+00E1>m and other d<U+00ED>w<U+00E1>ns had gone into the city with a party of soldiers to collect the contribution laid upon the city. Another reason was that some thousand troopers with orders for grain, oil, sugar, and flour, had gone into the city to collect these supplies. Another reason was that it had come to my knowledge that great numbers of gabrs, with their wives and children, and goods, and valuables, had come into the city from all the country round, and consequently I had sent some am<U+00ED>rs with their regiments (kush<U+00FA>n) into the city and directed them to pay no attention to the remonstrances of the inhabitants, but to seize and bring out these fugitives. For these several reasons a great number of fierce Turk<U+00ED> soldiers were in the city. When the soldiers proceeded to apprehend the Hindus and gabrs who had fled to the city, many of them drew their swords and offered resistance. The flames of strife were thus lighted and spread through the whole city from Jah<U+00E1>n-pan<U+00E1>h and S<U+00ED>r<U+00ED> to Old Dehl<U+00ED>, burning up all it reached. The savage Turks fell to killing and plundering. The am<U+00ED>rs who were in charge of the gates prevented any more soldiers from going into the place, but the flames of war had risen too high for this precaution to be of any avail in extinguishing them. On that day, Thursday, and all the night of Friday, nearly 15,000 Turks were engaged in slaying, plundering, and destroying. When morning broke on the Friday, all my army, no longer under control, went off to the city and thought of nothing but killing, plundering, and making prisoners. All that day the sack was general. The following day, Saturday, the 17th, all passed in the same way, and the spoil was so great that each man secured from fifty to a hundred prisoners, men, women, and children. There was no man who took less than twenty. The other booty was immense in rubies, diamonds, garnets, pearls, and other gems; jewels of gold and silver; ashraf<U+00ED>s, tankas of gold and silver of the celebrated 'Al<U+00E1><U+00ED> coinage; vessels of gold and silver; and brocades and silks of great value. Gold and silver ornaments of the Hindu women were obtained in such quantities as to exceed all account. Excepting the quarter of the saiyids, the 'ulam<U+00E1>, and the other Musulm<U+00E1>ns, the whole city was sacked. The pen of fate had written down this destiny for the people of this city. Although I was desirous of sparing them I could not succeed, for it was the will of Allah that this calamity should fall upon the city."</blockquote>

Timur left Delhi in December 1398 and marched on [[Meerut]]. Then he rode up to [[Haridwar]] and sacked the holy city on January 23, 1399. Before he crossed the Ganges, he faced stiff resistance from natives at [[Bhokarhedi]]. In April he had returned to his own capital beyond the [[Oxus]] (Amu Darya). Immense quantities of spoils and slaves were taken from India. According to [[Ruy Gonz<U+00E1>les de Clavijo]], 90 captured [[elephants]] were employed merely to carry precious stones looted from his conquest, so as to erect a [[mosque]] at Samarkand{{spaced ndash}}what historians today believe is the enormous [[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]].

==Last campaigns and death==
[[File:Chlebowski-Bajazyt w niewoli.jpg|thumb|right|Painting by [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Chlebowski]], ''Sultan [[Bayezid I|Bayezid]] imprisoned by Timur'', 1878.]]
Before the end of 1399, Timur started a war with [[Bayezid I]], sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[Mamluk]] sultan of [[Egypt]] ''Nasir-ad-Din Faraj''. Bayezid began annexing the territory of Turkmen and Muslim rulers in [[Anatolia]]. As Timur claimed sovereignty over the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] rulers, they took refuge behind him. Timur invaded Syria, sacked [[Aleppo]] and captured [[Damascus]] after defeating the Mamluk army. The city's inhabitants were massacred, except for the artisans, who were deported to Samarkand. This led to Timur's being publicly declared an enemy of Islam, as he was no longer killing only non-Muslims. However, [[Ibn Khaldun]] praises Timur for having unified much of the Muslim world when other conquerors of the time could not.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Frances Carney Gies |title=The Man Who Met Tamerlane |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197805/the.man.who.met.tamerlane.htm |journal=Saudi Aramco World |volume=29 |number=5 |date=September/October 1978}}</ref>

In a form of rectification, in 1400 Timur [[Timur's invasions of Georgia |invaded]] Christian [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Of the surviving population, more than 60,000 [[Peoples of the Caucasus|of the local people]] were captured as slaves, and many districts were depopulated.<ref>[http://rbedrosian.com/atmi4.htm The Turco-Mongol Invasions]</ref>

He invaded [[Baghdad]] in June 1401. After the capture of the city, 20,000 of its citizens were massacred. Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him. (Many [[warrior]]s were so scared they killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign just to ensure they had heads to present to Timur.){{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the meantime, years of insulting letters had passed between Timur and Bayezid. Finally, Timur invaded Anatolia and defeated Bayezid in the [[Battle of Ankara]] on July 20, 1402. Bayezid was captured in battle and subsequently died in captivity, initiating the 12-year [[Ottoman Interregnum]] period. Timur's stated motivation for attacking Bayezid and the Ottoman Empire was the restoration of [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] authority. Timur saw the Seljuks as the rightful rulers of [[Anatolia]] as they had been granted rule by Mongol conquerors, illustrating again Timur's interest with Genghizid legitimacy.

After the Ankara victory, Timur's army ravaged Western Anatolia, with Muslim writers complaining that the Timurid army acted more like a horde of savages than that of a civilized conqueror. But Timur did take the city of Smyrna, a stronghold of the Christian [[Knights Hospitalers]], thus he referred to himself as ''[[ghazi warriors|ghazi]]'' or "Warrior of Islam".

Timur was furious at the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] whose ships ferried the Ottoman army to safety in [[Thrace]]. As [[Lord Kinross]] reported in ''The Ottoman Centuries'', the Italians preferred the enemy they could handle to the one they could not.

By 1368, the new Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] had driven the [[Yuan Dynasty|Mongols]] out of [[China]]. The first [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] Emperor [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu]], and his successor [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] demanded, and received, homage from many Central Asian states as the political heirs to the former House of [[Kublai]]. The Ming emperor's attempts to treat Timur as a [[vassal]] did not go well: when in 1394 Hongwu's ambassadors presented Timur with a letter addressing him in this way, he had the ambassadors [[Fu An]], Guo Ji, and Liu Wei detained, and their 1,500 guards executed.<ref name=tsai188>{{citation

Timur eventually planned to conquer China. To this end, Timur made an alliance with the [[Mongols]] of the [[Northern Yuan Dynasty]] and prepared all the way to Bukhara. The Mongol leader [[Engke Khan, Emperor Xingyuan of Northern Yuan|Enkhe Khan]] sent his grandson [[<U+00D6>ljei Tem<U+00FC>r Khan|<U+00D6>ljei Tem<U+00FC>r]], also known as Buyanshir Khan. In December 1404, Timur started military campaigns against the Ming Dynasty and detained the Ming envoy, but he was attacked by fever and plague when encamped on the farther side of the Sihon ([[Syr-Daria]]) and died at Atrar ([[Otrar]]) on February 17, 1405,<ref>[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/timur.shtml Tamerlane (1336 - 1405) - ''The Last Great Nomad Power'']</ref> without ever reaching the Chinese border.<ref name=tsai161>{{harvnb|Tsia|2002|p=161}}</ref> Only after that were the Ming envoys released.<ref name=tsai188/>

Although he preferred to fight his battles in the spring, Timur died enroute during an uncharacteristic winter campaign against the ruling Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]]. It was one of the bitterest winters on record; his troops are recorded as having to dig through five feet of ice to reach drinking water. Records indicate though, that for part of his life at least, he was a surreptitious Ming [[vassal]] and that his son [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]] visited [[China]] in 1420.<ref name="Needham volume 4 part 2 554">Needham, Joseph (1971).

Of Timur's four sons, two (Jahangir and Umar Shaykh) predeceased him. His third son, [[Miran Shah]], died soon after Timur, leaving the youngest son, Shah Rukh. Although his designated successor was his grandson [[Pir Muhammad]] b. Jahangir, Timur was ultimately succeeded in power by his son Shah Rukh. His most illustrious descendant [[Babur]] founded the Islamic [[Mughal Empire]] and ruled over most of [[Afghanistan]] and [[North India]]. Babur's descendants [[Humayun]], [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]], [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Aurangzeb]], expanded the Mughal Empire to most of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Markham, in his introduction to the narrative of Clavijo's embassy, states that his body "was embalmed with musk and rose water, wrapped in linen, laid in an ebony coffin and sent to [[Samarkand]], where it was buried." His tomb, the [[Gur-e Amir]], still stands in Samarkand, though it has been heavily restored in recent years.

==Contributions to the arts==
[[File:Registan - Samarkand - 15-10-2005.jpg|thumb|right|150px|View of the Registan]]

[[File:Amir_Timur_in_Samarkand.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of Timur in [[Samarkand]]]]

Timur became widely known as a patron to the arts. Much of the architecture he commissioned still stands in [[Samarkand]], now in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]. He was known to bring the most talented artisans from the lands he conquered back to Samarkand, and is credited with often giving them a wide latitude of artistic freedom to express themselves. He also constructed one of his finest buildings at the tomb of [[Ahmed Yesevi]], an influential Turkic [[Sufi]] [[saint]] who spread [[Sufi]] [[Islam]] among the nomads.

According to legend, Omar Aqta, Timur's court [[arabic calligraphy|calligrapher]], transcribed the [[Qur'an]] using letters so small that the entire text of the book fit on a [[signet ring]]. Omar also is said to have created a Qur'an so large that a [[wheelbarrow]] was required to transport it. [[Bookbinding|Folios]] of what is probably this larger Qur'an have been found, written in gold lettering on huge pages.

Timur was also said to have created [[Tamerlane Chess]], a variant of [[shatranj]] (also known as [[medieval]] [[chess]]) played on a larger board with several additional pieces and an original method of pawn promotion. These pieces included the camel, siege-weapon, giraffe, and several others as well as boasting a complicated system involving the ability to exchange pawns for certain pieces should they reach the other side of the board.

Timur's mandating of [[Kurash]] wrestling for his soldiers ensured for it a lasting and legendary legacy. Kurash is now a popular international sport and part of the [[Asian Games]].

==Exchanges with Europe==
{{Main|Timurid relations with Europe}}
[[File:Letter of Tamerlane to Charles VI 1402.jpg|thumb|upright|Letter of Timur to [[Charles VI of France]], 1402, a witness to [[Timurid relations with Europe]].]]
Timur had numerous epistolary and diplomatic exchanges with Western, especially Spanish and French, rulers. There was the possibility of an alliance between Timur and the European states, against the Ottoman Turks that were attacking Europe. Therefore, there was a clear motive for Timur, who wanted to surround his Ottoman and Mamluk enemies in this offensive alliance.

The relations between the courts of [[Henry III of Castile]] and that of Timur constituted the most important episode of the medieval Spanish [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] diplomacy. In 1402, the time of the Battle of Ankara, two Spanish ambassadors were already with Timur: Pelayo de Sotomayor and Fernando de Palazuelos. Later, Timur sent to the court of  [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n|Le<U+00F3>n]] a [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatay]] ambassador named [[Hajji Muhammad al-Qazi]] with letters and gifts.

In return, the King Henry III of Castile sent a famous embassy to Timur's court in [[Samarkand]] in 1403-06, led by [[Ruy Gonzales de Clavijo]], with two other ambassadors, Alfonso Paez and Gomez de Salazar. On their return, Timur affirmed that he regarded the king of Castile "as his very own son".

According to Clavijo, Timur's good treatment of the Spanish delegation contrasted with the disdain shown by his host toward the envoys of the "lord of [[Cathay]]" (i.e., the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Yongle Emperor]]), the Chinese ruler. Clavijo's visit to Samarkand allowed him to report to the European audience on the news from [[Cathay]] (China), which few Europeans had been able to visit directly in the century that had passed since the travels of [[Marco Polo]].

Timur's legacy is a mixed one. While Central Asia blossomed under his reign, other places such as [[Baghdad#Early invaders|Baghdad]], [[Damascus#Timurlank|Damascus]], [[Delhi]] and other Arab, [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|Georgian]], Persian and Indian cities were sacked and destroyed and their populations massacred. He was responsible for the effective destruction of the Christian Church in much of Asia. Thus, while Timur still retains a positive image in [[Muslim]] [[Central Asia]], [[Persia]], and [[Arab countries]], he is vilified by many in [[India]], where some of his greatest atrocities were carried out. In the Islamic world at the time, he was variously considered both as a [[ghazi warriors|ghazi]] (or "Warrior for Islam") by some, and as an enemy of Islam by others.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Timur's military talents were unique. He planned all his campaigns years in advance, even planting barley for horse feed two-years ahead of his campaigns. He used [[propaganda]], in what is now called [[information warfare]], as part of his tactics. His campaigns were preceded by the deployment of spies whose tasks included collecting information and spreading horrifying reports about the cruelty, size, and might<!-- OK here: don't correct it-->  of Timur<U+2019>s armies. Such psychological warfare eventually weakened the morale of threatened populations and caused panic in the regions that he intended to invade.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Although Timur's uncharacteristic (for the time) concern for his troops inspired fierce loyalty, he did not pay them. Their only incentives were from looting captured territory <U+2014> a bounty that included horses, women, precious metals and stones; in other words whatever they, or their newly captured slaves, could carry away from the conquered lands.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Timur's short-lived empire also melded the [[Turko-Persian tradition]] in [[Transoxiania]], and in most of the territories which he incorporated into his [[fiefdom]], [[Persian language|Persian]] became the primary [[language]] of administration and literary culture (''[[divan|diwan]]''), regardless of [[ethnicity]].<ref>Manz, Beatrice Forbes (1999).

"In Tem<U+00FC>r's government, as in those of most nomad dynasties, it is impossible to find a clear distinction between civil and military affairs, or to identify the Persian bureaucracy as solely civil or the Turko-Mongolian solely with military government. In fact, it is difficult to define the sphere of either side of the administration and we find Persians and Chaghatays sharing many tasks. (In discussing the settled bureaucracy and the people who worked within it I use the word Persian in a cultural rather than ethnological sense. In almost all the territories which Tem<U+00FC>r incorporated into his realm Persian was the primary language of administration and literary culture. Thus the language of the settled 'diwan' was Persian and its scribes had to be thoroughly adept in Persian culture, whatever their ethnic origin.) Tem<U+00FC>r's Chaghatay emirs were often involved in civil and provincial administration and even in financial affairs, traditionally the province of Persian bureaucracy."</ref> In addition, during his reign, some contributions to Turkic literature were penned, with Turkic cultural influence expanding and flourishing as a result. A literary form of [[Chaghatai language|Chagatai Turkic]] came into use alongside Persian as both a cultural and an official language.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new Central Asia |last=Roy |first=Olivier |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=184511552X |pages=7 }}</ref>

Timur became a relatively popular figure in Europe for centuries after his death, mainly because of his victory over the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid. The Ottoman armies were at the time invading Eastern Europe and Timur was ironically seen as a sort of ally.

Timur has now been officially recognized as a national hero of newly independent [[Uzbekistan]]. His monument in Tashkent now occupies the place where [[Marx]]'s statue once stood.<ref>Mark Dickens, [http://www.oxuscom.com/phoenix.htm A Phoenix Rises in the Desert]</ref>

===Biographies===
[[File:Emir_Timur_statue_-_Tashkent.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Timur in [[Tashkent]].]]
Timur's generally recognized biographers are Ali Yazdi, commonly called [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi|Sharaf ud-Din]], author of the ''[[Zafar-Nameh|Zafarn<U+0101>meh]]'' ({{lang-fa|<U+0638><U+0641><U+0631><U+0646><U+0627><U+0645><U+0647>}}), translated by Petis de la Croix in 1722, and from [[French language|French]] into [[English language|English]] by J. Darby in the following year; and Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abdallah, al-Dimashiqi, al-Ajami (commonly called [[Ahmad Ibn Arabshah]]) translated by the Dutch Orientalist Colitis in 1636. In the work of the former, as [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] remarks, "the Tatarian conqueror is represented as a liberal, benevolent and illustrious prince", in that of the latter he is "deformed and impious, of a low birth and detestable principles."  But the favourable account was written under the personal supervision of Timur's grandson, Ibrahim, while the other was the production of his direst enemy.

Among less reputed biographies or materials for biography may be mentioned a second ''[[Zafar-Nameh|Zafarn<U+0101>meh]]'', by Nizam al-Din Shami, stated to be the earliest known history of Timur, and the only one written in his lifetime. Timur's purported autobiography, the ''[[Tuzk-e-Taimuri]]'' ("Memoirs of Temur") is a later fabrication, although most of the historical facts are accurate.<ref name="EI" />

===Exhumation===
Timurlane's body was [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] from his tomb in 1941 by the [[USSR|Soviet]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail M. Gerasimov]]. From his bones it was clear that Timur was a tall and broad chested man with strong cheek bones. Gerasimov reconstructed the likeness of Timur from his [[Human skull|skull]]. His height was 5 feet 8 inches (1.73  meters), very tall for his era. He also confirmed Timur's lameness due to a hip injury. Gerasimov also found that Timur's facial characteristics conformed to general Mongoloid features.<ref>http://www.silk-road.com/artl/timur.shtml</ref>
