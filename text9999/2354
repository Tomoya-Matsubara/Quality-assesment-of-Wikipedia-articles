==History==
Horbling is the site of a probable [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] settlement, centred around the present Fen Drove and Fen Farm, on Horbling [[Fen]] to the east, where has been found [[Earthwork (archaeology)|earthwork]] evidence of rectilinear [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosures]], and watercourses.<ref>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=350870|mname= |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> Large quantities of Roman [[Terra sigillata|Samian ware]] and roof tiles have also been discovered.<ref>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=350862|mname= |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> ''Cox'' noted that on the right hand side of road from Billingborough to Horbling is a [[tumulus]], probably of [[Prehistory|pre-historic]] origin.<ref name=Cox>Cox, J. Charles (1916) ''Lincolnshire'' pp. 168, 169, 170; Methuen & Co. Ltd.</ref>

In the ''[[Domesday Book|Domesday]]'' account the village is written as <U+201C>Horbelinge<U+201D>. It consisted of 9 [[Serfdom#Villeins|villagers]], 8 [[Serfdom#Freemen|freemen]] and one [[Smallholding#Smallholdings in Britain|smallholder]], land for 4 plough teams, a {{convert|20|acre|km2}} meadow and a church. Before the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest]] Thorkill the Dane was lord of the manor, in 1086 lordship was transferred to [[Walter D'Aincourt]].<ref>{{OpenDomesday|OS=TF1135|name=horbling|display=Horbling|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7585461&queryType=1&resultcount=5  "Documents Online: Horbling, Lincolnshire"],  Folio: 340r, ''Great Domesday Book''; [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]].

A hamlet of Horbling, Bridge End, (previously also Holland Brigg) {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} to the east, is the site of the small [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertine]] [[priory]] of [[Jesus|St Saviour]], founded in 1199 by Godwin the Rich of Lincoln.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38039&strquery=bridgend%20priory "The Priory of St Saviour, Bridgend in Horbling"]; [[British History Online]].

The priory had been taken down 45 years previously (c.1770), and its materials used for a large farmhouse virtually on the same site. Two miles to the east of the Bridge End was built a chapel where prayers were said for the safety of travellers.<ref name=Marrat/>

The Medieval [[Stow Fair, Lincolnshire|Stow Fair]] was held {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} to the west of the village at the junction of Mareham Lane and Stow Lane from 1233, and lasted until 1954.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40424&startPage=3 ''Lincolnshire, Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs in England and Wales to 1516''] (2005); [[British History Online]].

In 1885 ''[[Kelly's Directory]]'' noted that the village was on the Bourne and Sleaford branch of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]], and that the principal dwellings were supplied by the Billingborough and Horbling Gas Company. Agricultural production in a parish of {{convert|2620|acre|km2}} was chiefly wheat, barley, beans and oats. Its population in 1881 was 501. The [[Lord of the Manor]] was a George Shaw, and chief landowners were Edward Nathaniel Conant, George Shaw and Captain Henry Smith [[Justice of the Peace#England and Wales|JP]]. A school for boys and girls was originally established by Edward Brown of Horbling (d.1692) with endowments provided by income from his lands at [[Wigtoft]]. A new [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] schoolhouse was erected in 1865 for the free education of 11 boys and 9 girls.<ref name=Kellys>''Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull'' 1885, pp. 483, 484</ref>

Between 1939 and 1948 an area on the south side of Sandygate Lane was used to accommodate a prisoner of war camp. As Camp 80, it held German prisoners who were used as local labourers. Housing now occupies the camp site.<ref>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=1472902|mname= Prisoner of War Camp 80|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref>

Billingborough and Horbling Railway Station closed in 1964, after ceasing to be a passenger carrier over 30 years previously. It was built in 1872 through an act of Parliament of 1865. After closure the line to the north of the station was used to store the [[British Royal Train|Royal Train]].<ref>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=498482|mname= Billingborough and Horbling Station|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> The remains of the line just to the west of the village has become a [[nature reserve]] for small wildlife under the [[Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust]].<ref>[http://lincstrust.org.uk/reserves/nr/reserve.php?mapref=72 "Horbling Line"]; Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust.
