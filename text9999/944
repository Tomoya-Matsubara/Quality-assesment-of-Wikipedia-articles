'''Gateshead International Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium|multi-purpose]], [[all-seater]] arena in [[Felling, Tyne and Wear|Felling]], [[Tyne and Wear]], England. Originally known as the '''Gateshead Youth Stadium''', the venue was built in 1955 at a cost of <U+00A3>30,000. It has since been extensively re-developed on three occasions.

The main arena is principally used for [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]]. The inaugural athletics competition at the redeveloped venue, the 1974 "Gateshead Games", was instigated by [[Brendan Foster]], a Gateshead Council employee at that time. By breaking the world record in the [[3000 metres|mens 3,000&nbsp;m]], Foster brought international publicity to the new stadium and began a tradition of athletics competitions at the venue, which has since hosted the [[British Grand Prix (athletics)|British Grand Prix]] (2003&ndash;10) and the [[European Team Championships]] in 1989 and 2000. The stadium was selected to host the latter event for a third time<U+2014>the only venue to have done so<U+2014>in 2013. Five world records have been set at the stadium, including two by [[pole vault]]er [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] and a tied [[100 metres]] record by [[Asafa Powell]] in 2006.

Although the venue primarily caters for athletics, it is currently home to teams in several sports. [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead football club]] have played their home games at the stadium since they reformed in 1974 though the club plans to vacate the site when their [[Gateshead F.C. new stadium|own purpose-built ground]] is built. Gateshead International Stadium was home to the [[Gateshead Thunder]] [[rugby league]] club during their spell in the [[Super League]] and the current version of the club play home games in the main arena, which is known as the '''Thunderdome''' when used by that team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gateshead Thunder end two-and-a-half year wait for win|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/19422254|publisher=[[BBC|the BBC]]|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> Gateshead Harriers Athletic Club, which includes Foster and [[Jonathan Edwards (athlete)|Jonathan Edwards]] among its life members, are the oldest tenants, having used the site since 1956. The stadium has been used as a concert venue by numerous musical artists including [[Bon Jovi]], [[Bryan Adams]] and [[Tina Turner]].

==History and development==

During the 19th&nbsp;century, Felling became an important industrial town in the north east of England. At its north-western fringe, at Felling Shore, two large chemical works opened in 1827 and 1834.<ref name="chroniclelive1">{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/communities/felling/2012/01/01/ten-interesting-facts-about-felling-72703-30939585/|title=Ten interesting facts about Felling|work=[[Evening Chronicle|Newcastle Evening Chronicle]]|date=1 January 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref><ref>Lewis, 1848: 227</ref> These initially thrived, but by the early part of the 20th century both were in terminal decline,<ref>Hewitt (part three), 1990: 1 at para. 5</ref> and were demolished in 1932 to leave behind a 2-million-tonne heap of spoil.<ref name="chroniclelive1"/><ref name="powell8">Powell, 2010: 8</ref> This land, approximately {{convert|2|mi}} east of the centre of Gateshead,<ref>Powell, 2010: 7</ref> was cleared in 1942 but continued to lie derelict until the mid-1950s.<ref name="powell8"/>

In early 1955, Gateshead Council began work on transforming this land.

[[File:Gateshead 1975.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of Gateshead and Felling (1975). The rebuilt stadium is prominent (top centre).]]According to author Thomas Telfer, by the turn of the 1970s, the town of Gateshead was suffering from "the classic symptoms of decay in its inner-city areas". The response during the 1960s had been a programme of systematic derelict land reclamation and environmental improvement.<ref>Telford, 1988: 79</ref> While these measures did not have an immediate positive impact on the perception of the town, Gateshead Council pressed ahead by looking to develop existing infrastructure with a view to overall regeneration.<ref>Telford, 1988: 80</ref> One such opportunity was identified at the Gateshead Youth Stadium, where the council believed that investment might raise the region's profile and bring international recognition.<ref>Moore, Fox and Elliot, 2003: 107</ref> In April 1974, Gateshead Council inaugurated a "Sport and Recreation" department.<ref name="ICN"/> In July 1974, the council appointed [[Brendan Foster]]<U+2014>a former schoolteacher turned athlete and a native of [[Tyne and Wear]]<U+2014>as the Council's sport and recreation manager.<ref name="Gibson 2004:1"/><ref name="Freedom">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3761364.stm|title=Foster given Freedom of Gateshead|publisher=the BBC|date=20 October 2004|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> Foster, who according to Gibson became "the father of Gateshead athletics",<ref name="Gibson 2004:1">{{cite web|url=http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/0200sport/0600athletics/tm_objectid=14208798%26method=full%26siteid=50081%26headline=face-to-face--brendan-foster-name_page.html|title=Face to Face: Brendan Foster|first=John|last=Gibson|work=[[Newcastle Evening Chronicle]]|date=4 May 2004|accessdate=28 December 2012}} at p.1</ref> had been forced to train in [[Edinburgh]] during 1973 as a result of the poor condition of the Youth Stadium track.<ref name="UKA">{{cite web|url=http://www.uka.org.uk/e-inspire/hall-of-fame-athletes/brendan-foster/|title=Brendan Foster|publisher=[[UK Athletics]]|year=2011|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> In December 1973, he had been invited to a civic reception to celebrate his breaking of the two-mile world record earlier that year at Crystal Palace. At this reception, Foster was told that a new [[all-weather running track|synthetic track]] was being laid at Gateshead Youth Stadium. His response was a promise that, if the Council was serious, he would run at the stadium and break a world record (Foster later offered an explanation of that promise: "You know how it is when you've had a few drinks&mdash;you promise the world!").<ref name="ICN"/> When the track was laid in early&nbsp;1974, Foster became convinced of the Council's sincerity.<ref name="ICN"/> He was interviewed for the managerial position<ref name="ICN"/> and, upon appointment, became the "driving force"<ref name="Freedom"/> behind the programme of improvements to the Youth Stadium, which included the building of the main, covered Tyne and Wear stand in 1981<ref name="blue"/> and three accompanying stands; the venue was renamed the Gateshead International Stadium.<ref name="gateshead1"/><ref name="Freedom"/> This first tranche of improvements cost around <U+00A3>8&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-424000-561000/page/2|title=Domesday Reloaded: Gateshead International Stadium|publisher=[[BBC|the BBC]]|year=2011|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> and Foster's proposal to commemorate the re-opening with an athletic event was approved, allowing for the first "Gateshead Games" to be held in 1974.<ref name="Gibson 2004:1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090986/2/index.htm|title=Howay, Big Bren!

The first major athletic event held at the stadium was the Vaux Breweries International Athletics meet in July 1961. According to its sponsors, the highlight of this meet was the team three-mile race, won by the Blackpool and Fylde Athletic club who were awarded a gold tankard as their prize.<ref name="BGR"/> Attracted by a prize fund of <U+00A3>500 and the imminent  [[AAA Championships]] in London, the event attracted several athletes from New Zealand, including [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's 5000 metres|reigning 5000m metre Olympic champion]] [[Murray Halberg]] and [[Peter Snell]], the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's 800 metres|reigning 800m Olympic champion]].<ref name="McGuirk"/> Watched by a capacity crowd of 10,000 spectators, the men won their respective races; Halberg placed first in the [[Mile run|mile]] with a time of 4:03:70 and Snell led a [[New Zealand]] one-two in the 880 yard event, finishing ahead of teammate Gary Philpott in 1:50:40.<ref name="McGuirk"/>

When the comprehensive refurbishment of the stadium was completed more than a decade later, Brendan Foster (by this time a Gateshead Council employee) proposed an international athletics meet. On 3 August 1974, the first "Gateshead Games" were staged in front of around 10,000 spectators.<ref name="Gibson 2004:1"/><ref name="UKA"/> Four weeks before he won the European 3000m title at the [[1974 European Athletics Championships]] in [[Rome]], Foster kept his earlier promise to run in the men's 3000m and won the race in a new world-record time of 7:35:20. According to journalist John Gibson, Foster's performance gave the meet, broadcast live by [[Tyne Tees Television]], "landmark status".<ref name="Gibson 2004:1"/><ref name="UKA"/> A plaque commemorating the record was later placed at the entrance to the stadium.<ref name="ICN"/>

The Gateshead Games became an annual event, which gave the stadium credibility as a major sporting venue.<ref name="ICN"/><ref name="Gibson 2004:1"/> In his managerial capacity with Gateshead Council, Foster was increasingly able to attract athletes to the games. In 1977, Foster had to intervene when [[BBC Radio Newcastle]] provided the wrong [[Ethiopian national anthem]] which, when played, offended [[Miruts Yifter]] sufficiently that he and his teammates started off towards [[Newcastle International Airport]]. The intervention worked<U+2014>in the end, Foster asked Yifter and his teammates if they would sing the anthem themselves, which they did in the middle of the stadium<U+2014>and Yifter returned to outclass a field including [[Steve Ovett]] over 5000m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/0200sport/0600athletics/tm_objectid=14208798%26method=full%26siteid=50081%26headline=face-to-face--brendan-foster-name_page.html|title=Face to Face: Brendan Foster|first=John|last=Gibson|work=[[Newcastle Evening Chronicle]]|date=4 May 2004|accessdate=28 December 2012}} at p.3</ref> The track was resurfaced by Regisport in 1982<ref name="TrackDir">{{cite web|url=http://www.runtrackdir.com/details.asp?track=gateshead&country=uk|title=Gateshead International Stadium|publisher=Running Track Directory|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=30 August 2012}} This site is a redirect from the UK Athletics website.</ref> and the venues' profile was further raised in the summer of 1983, when Gateshead-born athlete [[Steve Cram]]{{refn|group=nb|UK Athletics state that Cram was born in Gateshead,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uka.org.uk/e-inspire/hall-of-fame-athletes/steve-cram/|title=Hall of Fame Athletes &ndash; Steve Cram|publisher=[[UK Athletics]]|year=2012|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> as does an interview with Cram by ''Track and Field News'' in September 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/archive/Interviews/Steve%20Cram.pdf|title=T & F N &ndash; Interview, Steve Cram|work=Track and Field News|first=Steve|last=Powell|date=12 September 1985|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> Other sources, including an article from the [[University of Sunderland]] website, claim he was born in [[Jarrow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://services.sunderland.ac.uk/universitysport/newsevents/news/news/index.php?nid=500|title=News Story &ndash; Steve Cram named new Chancellor|publisher=[[University of Sunderland]]|date=23 May 2008|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>}} faced Sebastian Coe over 800m in the Gateshead Games. In front of a reported crowd of 15,000 who were "shoehorned into the bowl" and millions more watching on BBC's [[Sunday Grandstand]], Cram prevailed to spark "pandemonium" in his final race before winning the gold medal at the [[1983 World Championships in Athletics|1983 World Athletics Championships]] in [[Helsinki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/0200sport/0600athletics/tm_headline=face-to-face-steve-cram%26method=full%26objectid=17020775%26page=1%26siteid=50081-name_page.html|title=Face to Face: Steve Cram|first=John|last=Gibson|work=[[Newcastle Evening Chronicle]]|date=2 May 2006|accessdate=28 December 2012}} at p.1</ref>

In 1989, Gateshead hosted the [[1989 European Cup (athletics)|Europa Cup]]. The men's competition was won for the first time by a Great Britain team captained by [[Linford Christie]] and which included [[Kriss Akabusi]] and [[Jack Buckner]]; the event was described a decade later as having had an "invigorating effect" on those who were in attendance.<ref name="Europa1"/> Four years later, on 30 July 1993, a stadium-record crowd of 14,797<ref name="McGuirk"/> watched Christie, by this time [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's 100 metres|the reigning 100m Olympic champion]], in action again &ndash; this time against his old rival [[Carl Lewis]] in a race where both men were reportedly paid <U+00A3>100,000 irrespective of the result.<ref name="Rowbottom">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/athletics-climate-and-form-point-to-a-christie-victory-world-and-olympic-champions-play-down-the-implications-of-tonights-gateshead-showdown-for-world-championships-in-stuttgart-1488119.html|title=Athletics: Climate and form point to a Christie victory: World and Olympic champions play down the implications of tonight's Gateshead showdown for World Championships in Stuttgart|first=Mike|last=Rowbottom|work=[[The Independent]]|date=30 July 1993|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> Christie won in a time of 10.07 seconds, ahead of [[Jon Drummond]] in second and Lewis, who finished "a distant third".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/jamaican-sprinters-yohan-blake-and-usain-bolt-refuse-to-race-headtohead-8092692.html|title=Jamaican sprinters Yohan Blake and Usain Bolt refuse to race head-to-head |first=Simon|last=Turnbull|work=[[The Independent]]|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> The 100m race was the highlight of the "high profile" Vauxhall Invitational meet, which was televised in the UK by [[ITV]] and watched by around 10 million viewers.

In August 1998, Gateshead was selected to host the [[2000 European Cup (athletics)|2000 Europa Cup]] after the [[European Athletic Association]] switched the event from original host venue [[Martinique]] to avoid athletes travelling long distances in an Olympic year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/athletics-gatesheads-european-cup-1173824.html|title=Athletics: Gateshead's European Cup|work=[[The Independent]]|date=24 August 1998|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> This made Gateshead the first venue to host the event twice.<ref name="Diamond">{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondleague.com/News/News-Archive/An-athletics-snapshot-of-GATESHEAD/|title=An athletic snapshot of Gateshead|first=David|last=Powell|publisher=Diamond League.com|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> On 16&ndash;17 July 2000, spectators at Gateshead once again saw Great Britain's men's team take the title, this time by half a point from Germany in second place; the British victory came despite missing ten first-choice team members.

Isinbayeva's achievement in the last event of the meet was so unexpected that only 1,000 of the 10,000 spectators witnessed it, the rest having left early. For her achievement, she was given a bonus cheque for $50,000.<ref name="autogenerated2003"/> On 27 June 2004, Isinbayeva returned to Gateshead. This time the event organisers decided to schedule the pole vault event earlier and were rewarded when Isinbayeva defied extremely windy conditions to post a new record mark of 4.87m.<ref name="IAAF"/> Isinbayeva was the second woman to set a world record in the pole vault at Gateshead; [[Daniela Bartova]] did so in 1995.<ref name="Diamond"/> In 2006, a crowd of 8,500 saw [[Asafa Powell]] equal the world record of 9.77 seconds in the [[100 metres|men's 100m]].

Having won eight of their nine games in the regular season, the team won the Division One North title and advanced to the end-of-season playoffs. After beating the Merseyside Nighthawks 43&ndash;0 in the quarter-finals, the Senators defeated the [[Essex Spartans]] 33&ndash;19 in the semi-finals to reach the championship final. At the [[Saffron Lane sports centre|Saffron Lane Stadium]] in [[Leicester]], the Senators faced the [[Bristol Aztecs (American football)|Bristol Aztecs]].
