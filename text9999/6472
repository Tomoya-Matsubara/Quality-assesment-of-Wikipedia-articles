After school, Wai enlisted in the [[Hawaii National Guard]] and was called into active duty before the United States' entrance into World War II. He received a commission as an officer through [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Army)|Officer Candidate School]] in 1941.<ref name=Sterner-135>Sterner, ''op. cit.'' p 135</ref> His commission was rare at the time because few Asian-Americans were allowed to serve in combat leadership roles.<ref name="hero"/><ref name=Sterner-135/>
He was eventually assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment of the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] with the rank of Captain.<ref name="hero"/> The 24th Division, based at [[Schofield Barracks]], Oahu, was among the first American units to be involved in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] as they exchanged fire with Japanese aircraft during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After almost two years guarding Hawaii from Japanese invasion, the division moved to Australia for training, then attacked and captured the Hollandia Airdrome on the northwest coast of [[New Guinea]]. Wai's regiment landed on nearby [[Biak]] Island, where it helped the [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st Infantry Division]] secure three other Japanese airfields.

In 1944, Wai was posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for valor during the invasion of Leyte, Philippines where he led an [[amphibious assault]] on a Japanese [[pillbox]] in which he was subsequently killed. After the war, his remains were interred at the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in Hawaii.<ref name="cemetery">

==DSC upgraded to Medal of Honor==
[[Image:Army Medal of Honor.jpg|thumb|100px|right|The Medal of Honor. The highest decoration for valor in the United States Armed Forces.]]
In 1996, Congress directed [[Secretary of the Army]], [[Louis Caldera]] to conduct a review of military records to determine whether or not Asian Americans who fought in uniform during World War II were treated unfairly due to prejudice.<ref name="review1"/>.<ref name="review2"/> The review concluded that 22 Asian Americans including Wai, were not given full consideration for the Medal of Honor. In 2000, Wai's Distinguished Service Cross was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. Of those whose medals were upgraded, Wai was one of only two who did not belong to the predominantly [[Japanese American]] [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]]/[[100th Infantry Battalion (United States)|100th Infantry Battalion]]; the other being [[Rudolph B. Davila]] of the 7th Infantry.<ref name="pentagon">

'''Citation:'''
:Captain Francis B. Wai distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action, on 20 October 1944, in Leyte, Philippine Islands. Captain Wai landed at Red Beach, Leyte, in the face of accurate, concentrated enemy fire from gun positions advantageously located in a palm grove bounded by submerged rice paddies. Finding the first four waves of American soldiers leaderless, disorganized, and pinned down on the open beach, he immediately assumed command. Issuing clear and concise orders, and disregarding heavy enemy machine gun and rifle fire, he began to move inland through the rice paddies without cover. The men, inspired by his cool demeanor and heroic example, rose from their positions and followed him. During the advance, Captain Wai repeatedly determined the locations of enemy strong points by deliberately exposing himself to draw their fire. In leading an assault upon the last remaining Japanese pillbox in the area, he was killed by its occupants. Captain Wai's courageous, aggressive leadership inspired the men, even after his death, to advance and destroy the enemy. His intrepid and determined efforts were largely responsible for the rapidity with which the initial beachhead was secured. Captain Wai's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.<ref name="homeofheroes">
