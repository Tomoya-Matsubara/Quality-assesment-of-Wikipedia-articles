'''Safe Road Trains for the Environment''' (SARTRE), is an [[European Commission]] funded project to investigate and trial technologies and strategies for the safe [[Platoon (automobile)|platooning]] of road vehicles, a transportation concept in which several vehicles are electronically linked together in a '[[road train]]', with only the lead driver in active control. The three year project was launched in 2009. A first practical test successfully took place in January 2011.

==Project aims==
The aim of the project is to develop prototype systems to aid the development of platooning for eventual use on unmodified public [[motorway]]s, interacting with non-platooned traffic.<ref name=AboutSARTRE/> The project was formally launched in September 2009, with an intended duration of three years.<ref name=SARTRERelease22Oct2009/> The EU hopes the use of platooning on European roads would cut fuel consumption, journey times and congestion.<ref name=BBCNews9Nov2009/>

==Proposed system==
The SARTRE platooning system envisages a platoon of up to eight vehicles linked electronically, with the lead vehicle controlled by a professional driver, controlling in turn those following, as [[Master/slave (technology)|slave vehicles]]. Aimed at commuters in cars, but also possibly commercial vehicles and buses, drivers would be able to join and leave the platoon at will. To keep costs down, the technology for the system is to be achieved through off the shelf components, and specifically without requiring expensive changes to highway infrastructure.<ref name=BBCNews9Nov2009/>

==Funding and participants==
The SARTRE project is run as a [[consortium]], funded by the [[European Commission]] under their [[Seventh Framework Programme]].<ref name=AboutSARTRE/> The consortium is led by the British company [[Ricardo plc|Ricardo UK Ltd]].<ref name=BBCNews18Jan2011/> Other participating organisations are:<ref name=SARTREPartners/>

* Institut for Kraftfahrwesen Aachen (IKA) (Germany)
* Robotiker-Tecnalia (Spain)
* [[SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden]]
* [[Volvo Cars|Volvo Car Corporation]] (Sweden)
* [[Volvo Technology]] (Sweden)

==Trials==
Test track trials of SARTRE platooning are to take place in the UK, Spain and Sweden, with an eventual public road trial in Spain.<ref name=BBCNews9Nov2009/> In January 2011 the first successful trial took place at Volvo's test track in Sweden, in which a single car was slaved behind a rigid truck. With control being taken by the truck, the driver of the slaved car was able to take their hands off the wheel, read a newspaper, and sip coffee.<ref name=BBCNews18Jan2011/>
