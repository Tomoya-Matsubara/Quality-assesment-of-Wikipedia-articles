'''Alain Marie Pascal Prost''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born [[February 24]], [[1955]] in [[Saint-Chamond]], [[France]]) is a retired [[France|French]] racing driver and four-time [[Formula One]] World Champion. In terms of World Drivers' Championship titles, only [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] and [[Michael Schumacher]] have been more successful in the sport's history. He held the record for most Grand Prix victories from 1987 to 2001, when it was broken by Schumacher.

Prost discovered [[karting]] at the age of 14 during a family holiday. He won the French and European [[Formula Three|F3]] championships before joining [[McLaren]] in [[1980 Formula One season|1980]] at the age of 25. He finished in the points on his Formula One debut and took his first of 51 race victories at his home Grand Prix in France a year later, while he was driving for the [[Renault F1|Renault Factory team]].

Prost employed a smooth, relaxed style behind the wheel, deliberately modelling himself on personal heroes like [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Jim Clark]].<ref>Roebuck, Nigel (1986) ''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0850597927/sr=1-2/qid=1160731859/ Grand Prix Greats]'' p.131 Book Club Associates ISBN 0850597927</ref> He was very skilled at, and focused on, setting up his car for race conditions. He would often start races conservatively, managing the wear on his brakes and tyres, leaving himself in a position to challenge at the end of the race. As a result of this approach he was nicknamed 'The Professor'.<ref>''Hall of Fame - Alain Prost'' [http://www.formula1.com/archive/halloffame/driver/36.html Formula1.com] Paragraph 6. Retrieved 16 August 2006</ref> During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Prost formed a fierce rivalry with [[Ayrton Senna]], who joined him at [[McLaren]] in 1988. The two had a series of controversial races, including a collision at the [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix]] that gave Prost his third Drivers' championship win. A year later at the same venue they collided again and Senna won the title. After a dismal 1991 with Ferrari and a [[sabbatical]] in 1992, Prost joined [[WilliamsF1|Williams]], where he dominated the season before finally retiring at the end of the season. In 1997 Prost took over the French [[Ligier]] team, running it as [[Prost Grand Prix]] until it went bankrupt in  2001. In 2006, Prost started his fourth year in the [[Andros Trophy]], which is an [[Ice Racing]] competition.

[[Denis Jenkinson]], a well respected journalist, describes Prost as "a very warm and uncomplicated man who doesn't rely on passion or inspiration. Nor does he indulge in showmanship or bullshit. He is capable of a level of mental discipline beyond the comprehension of most people."<ref>''8W - Who? - Alain Prost'' [http://www.forix.com/8w/prost.html Forix.com] Paragraph 24.

==Driving career==
===Pre-Formula One===
Prost won several karting championships in his teens. In 1974 he left school to become a full-time racer, supporting himself by tuning engines and a becoming a kart distributor. His prize for winning the 1975 French senior karting championship was a season in [[Formula Renault]],<ref name="GP Encyclopedia">''GP Encyclopedia > Drivers > Alain Prost'' [http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-proala.html GrandPrix.com]. Retrieved October 2006</ref> a category in which he went on to win two driving titles before moving to [[Formula Three]]. In 1978 and 1979 he won both the French and European F3 championships, by which time he was on the shopping lists of several Formula One teams.<ref name="GP Encyclopedia" /> After carefully considering his options he chose to sign with [[McLaren]] for [[1980 Formula One season|1980]], although he surprised them by declining their offer of a race drive in a third car at the final race of the [[1979 Formula One season|1979 season]] - reasoning that the token effort would benefit neither him or the team.<ref>Roebuck, Nigel ''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0850597927/sr=1-2/qid=1160731859/ Grand Prix Greats]'' (1986) p.126.

===Formula One===
====1980: McLaren====

''Related article: [[McLaren]]''

Alain Prost began his career with [[McLaren]] in [[1980 Formula One season|1980]] alongside Ulsterman [[John Marshall Watson|John Watson]]. On his debut in [[1980 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]] he finished in sixth place, earning one point on his F1 debut, an achievement only a handful of drivers had achieved. Prost managed to add four more points to his tally during the rest of the season, scoring points in [[1980 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]]; [[1980 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and the [[1980 Dutch Grand Prix|Netherlands]]. Prost finished the year 15th in the driver's championship, equalling points with former world champion [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist in one of them and suffering a concussion in another. It appeared that mechanical failures were to blame for certain crashes and Prost also wasn't comfortable with the way the McLaren team was handling the drivers and the cars, so despite having a two-year contract he left McLaren and signed with Renault.

====1981-1983: Renault====

[[Image:Prost Renault Paris.jpg|thumb|200px|Prost's 1983 [[Renault F1|Renault]], in which he came close to winning his first championship.]]

;1981
Prost was partnered with fellow Frenchman [[Ren<U+00E9> Arnoux]] for [[1981 Formula One season|1981]]. Prost didn't finish the first two Grand Prix, due to collisions with [[Andrea de Cesaris]] in [[1981 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach]] and [[Siegfried Stohr]] in [[1981 Brazilian Grand Prix|Jacarepagu<U+00E1>]], but scored his first podium finish in [[1981 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]]. He retired in the next four races before winning his first Grand Prix, finishing two seconds ahead of his old teammate [[John Marshall Watson|John Watson]] at his home Grand Prix in France. For Prost, his debut on the top step of the podium was memorable mostly for the change it made in his mindset. "Before, you thought you could do it," he said. "Now you know you can."<ref name=HOF>Hall of Fame - Alain Prost [http://www.formula1.com/archive/halloffame/driver/36.html www.formula1.com] Retrieved 7 October 2006</ref> Prost enjoyed two more victories during the season, as well as his first pole position in [[1981 Dutch Grand Prix|Holland]] and finished fifth in the drivers' championship, seven points behind champion, [[Nelson Piquet]].

;1982
[[1982 Formula One season|1982]] was another reasonably successful season for Prost, winning the first two Grand Prix in [[1982 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]] and [[1982 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], but those would be the only two victories for Prost during the season. He retired seven times and, excluding his two wins, finished in the points on four other occasions. Prost improved on his drivers' championship position, finishing in fourth, but scoring nine points less than the previous year.

;1983
Arnoux left Renault in [[1983 Formula One season|1983]] and Prost was partnered with [[United States of America|American]] [[Eddie Cheever]]. Prost earned a further four victories for Renault during the season and finished second in the drivers' championship, two points behind [[Nelson Piquet]]. Prost and Renault were overhauled by Piquet and the [[Brabham]] team in the last few races of the season. Prost found himself increasingly at odds with Renault's management, who made him the [[Scapegoat#Scapegoating in sports|scapegoat]] for failing to win a championship. In addition to that, the French fans who recalled the bitter fight that had caused their favourite, Arnoux, to leave the team. This climaxed in Prost moving with his wife Anne-Marie and their son Nicolas to [[Switzerland]] in order to rejoin the [[McLaren]] team in [[1984 Formula One season|1984]].

====1984-1989: McLaren====

[[Image:ProstAlain McLarenMP4-2B 1985.jpg|thumb|200px|Alain Prost driving the McLaren MP4/2B at the [[1985 German Grand Prix]].]]

;1984
The Frenchman joined [[Austria|Austrian]] [[Niki Lauda]] at McLaren in [[1984 Formula One season|1984]], driving the [[McLaren MP4/2]]. He lost the world championship to Lauda in the final race by half a point, despite winning seven races to Lauda's five. The half point was scored when the [[1984 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] was stopped at half distance due to heavy rain, meaning the top six drivers would only receive half scores. Prost won, but took only 4.5 points.

;1985
In [[1985 Formula One season|1985]], using [[Techniques d'Avant Garde|TAG-Porsche]] engines, he became the first French Formula One [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Champion]]. Prost won five of the sixteen Grand Prix during the season. He also won on the road at the [[1985 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], but was disqualified after his car was found to be underweight in post-race scrutineering.<ref>{{cite web | title = 1985 San Marino Grand Prix | url = http://www.gpracing.net192.com/races/reports/407.cfm | work = www.gpracing.net192.com | accessdate = 2006-10-07 }}</ref> Prost finished 23 points ahead of his closest rival, [[Michele Alboreto]]. Prost's performance in 1985 earned him the [[Legion d'Honneur]] award in France.

;1986
Niki Lauda retired in [[1986 Formula One season|1986]], and was replaced by [[1982 Formula One season|1982]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Champion]], [[Keke Rosberg]]. Prost successfully defended his '85 title, despite his car struggling against the Honda-powered Williams of [[Nelson Piquet]] and [[Nigel Mansell]].<ref>{{cite web | title = 1986 Australian Grand Prix | url = http://www.gpracing.net192.com/races/reports/436.cfm | work = www.gpracing.net192.com | accessdate = 2006-10-07 }}</ref> In fact it appeared up to the latter stages of the final race of the 1986 season, in [[1986 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], that Prost was going to finish third in the Championship, behind Mansell and Piquet. However, Mansell dramatically blew a tyre at high speed, while leading, and the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team called Piquet in for a pit stop to change tyres as a safety precaution, thus handing the race victory - and Championship - to Prost, who had pitted earlier. Another memorable race that year for Prost was at the [[1986 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], when, while running in 4th position, his car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd. The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was classified 6th in the race, as the 7th-placed car was a lap behind.<ref>{{cite web | title = Grand Prix Results: German GP, 1986 | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr430.html | publisher = GrandPrix.com | accessdate = 2006-11-07 }}</ref>

;1987
With Rosberg going into temporary retirement for [[1987 Formula One season|'87]], [[Stefan Johansson]] filled the seat thanks to his [[Marlboro]] connections.<ref>{{cite web | title = 8W - Who? - Alain Prost | url = http://www.forix.com/8w/prost.html | work = Forix.com Paragraph 18 | accessdate = 2006-08-16 }}</ref> Even though Prost was driving an obsolete McLaren he managed to challenge Piquet and Mansell almost until the end, winning three races and notably breaking [[Jackie Stewart]]'s record by claiming his 28th Grand Prix victory. Prost considers the [[1987 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] as his best and most rewarding race ever. The [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-[[Honda]]s had been dominant during qualifying and Prost started fifth on the grid. He had worked on his race set-up and with everyone else going for a high-downforce set-up the Frenchman went the other way. The set-up meant less tyre wear, thanks to slower speeds in the corners while going fast down the straights. Only one stop was necessary and Prost won the race by 40 seconds. He later said: "When you win a race like this the feeling is very, very good. There have been times when I have been flat-out to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In [[1980 Formula One season|1980]] I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact the only thing you can judge in this sport is the longterm. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race."<ref>{{cite web | title = 8W - Who? - Alain Prost | url = http://www.forix.com/8w/prost.html | work = Forix.com Paragraph 19 & 20 | accessdate = 2006-08-16 }}</ref> Prost finished the '87 season in fouth; 30 points behind champion, Nelson Piquet.

;1988
Despite Nelson Piquet winning the Drivers' Championship and Williams winning the Constructors' Championship, [[Honda]] decided not to supply Williams with their engines and insteead supplied the McLaren team for [[1988 Formula One season|1988]]. Mclaren Honda dominated the season winning 15 out of 16 races. Prost won seven and outscored his new teammate [[Ayrton Senna]] by 11 points, despite Senna winning one more race than Prost. However only the 11 best results from the season counted toward the championship total, and this gave Senna the title by 3 points. This began the sensational rivalry that conspired to push two of the sport's greatest drivers to unprecedented heights of success and controversy.

;1989
McLaren's domination continued throughout [[1989 Formula One season|1989]] and the Prost-Senna struggle for supremacy put them on a collision course. Mutual admiration turned to all-out hatred, with the Frenchman accusing his Brazilian team mate of "''dangerous driving''"<ref>{{cite web | title = Hall of Fame - Alain Prost | url = http://www.formula1.com/archive/halloffame/driver/36.html | work = Formula1.com Paragraph 7 | accessdate = 2006-08-16 }}</ref> and of receiving more than a fair share of attention from both McLaren and Honda. Their embittered season ended in what a lot of pundits feared might happened during the race,<ref>{{cite web | title = F1 Prost v Senna | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpzo6QY8x3U | publisher = [[YouTube]] | accessdate = 2006-08-16 }}</ref> At the end of lap 46 Senna made his move at the chicane. Prost turned into his teammate's path. The two interlocked McLarens slid up the chicane escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his car. To separate the cars the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards on to the track. They put the car into a dangerous position and so had to push it forwards again. As they did so Senna bump-started the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of his car was damaged and he had to pit but he rejoined only five seconds behind [[Alessandro Nannini]]. Senna's chase was furious and merciless. On lap 50 Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the podium. Senna had been excluded for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna $100,000 and gave him a suspended six month ban.<ref>{{cite web | title = Grand Prix Resulrs: Japanese GP, 1989 | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr483.html | work = GrandPrix.com | accessdate = 2006-08-16 }}</ref> So Prost had clinched his third driving title in controversial circumstances, the Frenchman quickly moved from McLaren to join his new employers: [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].

====1990-1991: Ferrari====

[[Image:AlainProst Ferrari 1991.jpg|thumb|200px|Prost driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] on the first lap of the [[1991 United States Grand Prix]].]]

;1990
The Frenchman replaced [[Gerhard Berger]] at Ferrari and was partnered with Britain's [[Nigel Mansell]] for [[1990 Formula One season|1990]]. Prost won five races for Ferrari that year, in [[1990 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], [[1990 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]], [[1990 French Grand Prix|France]], [[1990 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and [[1990 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]]. Notable among these was the Mexican Grand Prix, where he won after starting in 13th position. In both the Mexican and Spanish races he led Mansell to Ferrari 1-2 finishes. The championship once again came to the penultimate round of the season in [[1990 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] with Prost trailing his McLaren adversary, Ayrton Senna, by nine points. Like the year before, the race was settled in a controversial collision between the two. At the first corner Senna intentionally drove his race car into Prost's, taking them both out of the race and sealing the title for Senna. "What he did was disgusting," Prost said. "He is a man without value."<ref name=HOF/> Prost finished the season seven points behind Senna, and his Ferrari team were also runners-up to McLaren.

;1991
In [[1991 Formula One season|1991]], Mansell left the Scuderia, due to his unstable relasionship with Prost,<ref>Murray Walker & Simon Taylor ''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852279184 Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes]'' Page 108, Paragraph 2 Virgin Books, ISBN 1-85227-918-4</ref> to join his previous employers, [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]. Mansell's replacement was Frenchman [[Jean Alesi]], who had been impressive during the previous two years at [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]]. Ferrari couldn't cope with the other teams and that season, Prost wasn't able to win a race, only getting onto the podium five times. He took it out on the Italian team blaming them for his failures; went public with his criticism and was fired prior to the end of the season, right before the [[1991 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]].<ref>Murray Walker & Simon Taylor ''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852279184 Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes]'' Page 115, Line 6-9 Virgin Books, ISBN 1-85227-918-4</ref> Prost was replaced by [[Italy|Italian]] [[Gianni Morbidelli]].

====1993: Williams====
{{see also|WilliamsF1}}
Prost went onto a [[sabbatical year]] in [[1992 Formula One season|1992]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Hall of Fame - Alain Prost | url = http://www.formula1.com/archive/halloffame/driver/36.html | work = Formula1.com Paragraph 9 | accessdate = 2006-08-16 }}</ref> which was dominated by [[Nigel Mansell]] in a [[Williams F1|Williams]]-[[Renault]]. But after hearing that Prost would, once again, be his teammate, Mansell left Williams to race in the [[IndyCar]] series. The Frenchman was part of a new-look driver line-up at Williams, with rookie [[Damon Hill]] coming in to replace [[Riccardo Patrese]], who had left to join [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]].

Prost clinched his fourth, and final, title, but in a year where he was regularly challenged by Ayrton Senna in an inferior car. Shortly before the [[1993 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]] in October 1993, Alain Prost announced he would not defend his world title and instead opted to retire as the most successful driver in the sport's history<ref>{{cite web | title = Grand Prix Results: Portuguese GP, 1993 | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr546.html | publisher = GrandPrix.com | accessdate = 2006-11-07 }}</ref> - a record which stood for almost a decade. On the podium in [[1993 Australian Grand Prix|Adelaide]] in 1993, Prost's last race, he and Ayrton Senna embraced, and it was as if, now that Prost was no longer a rival, Ayrton saw no reason for any more hostility. Prost was surprised by the gesture.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ayrton Senna by Alain Prost | url = http://www.prostfan.com/senna2.htm | work = ProstFan.com Paragraph 50 | accessdate = 2006-10-12 }}</ref> Prost's performances earned him on [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]].

Prost's record for most Grand Prix wins, 51, was broken during the [[2001 Formula One season|2001 season]] by [[Germany|German]] [[Michael Schumacher]]. However, two of his records still stand, which are the most Grand Prix starts using [[Turbo charger|turbo]] powered cars, which is 126 and most wins at home Grand Prix, in Prost's case it is the [[French Grand Prix]], which he won six times.

====Rivalry with Ayrton Senna====
Alain Prost is noted for his battles with Ayrton Senna. The rivalry originated in [[1988 Formula One season|1988]], when Senna joined Prost at the [[McLaren]] team. The most notable event during the season between the two occurred during the [[1988 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]], where Senna tried to block Prost from taking the lead by forcing the Frenchman to run close to the pitwall; Prost managed to edge Senna outwards, taking the lead as they went into the first corner. Prost was not happy with Senna's manoeuver. <ref>''Grand Prix Results: Portuguese GP, 1988'' [http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr465.html GrandPrix.com]. Retrieved 17 August 2006</ref> The rivalry intensified after the [[1989 San Marino Grand Prix]], where the two drivers had an agreement that neither would get in each other's way to the first corner. At the start Senna got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in Senna's way. The race was stopped on lap four due to a crash by [[Gerhard Berger]]. At the restart, it was Prost this time that got away the better of the two but Senna forced his way past Prost in the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement at the start of the race, leaving the Frenchman furious with Senna.<ref>{{cite book | first = Mark | last = Hughes | title = The Unofficial Complete Encyclopedia Of Formula One | pages = Page 72, Line 13-27 | publisher = Hermes House | id = ISBN 1-84309-864-4 }}</ref> The rivalry then reached its peak at the end of 1989, when the title was to be decided between Senna and Prost at [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Suzuka]]. The two McLarens collided at a chicane when Prost blocked an attempted pass by Senna. Prost walked away and Senna returned to the track by illegally cutting the chicane -- a maneuver that resulted in a disqualification after the race had finished. Prost admitted years later that he had knowingly not let Senna through despite Senna having the inside line at the chicane. 

[[1990 Formula One season|1990]], saw the two drivers collide again. Senna led Prost, now in a [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], in the world drivers' championship. Prost had qualified second for the final race of the season in [[1990 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] and Senna was on pole. Prior to the race Senna had complained that his side of the grid was dirty, meaning he would get less grip and therefore a slower start compared to Prost who was on the clean side of the grid. The Brazilian's appeal was rejected.<ref>{{cite book | first = Mark | last = Hughes | title = The Unofficial Complete Encyclopedia Of Formula One | pages = Page 75, Line 8-17 | publisher = Hermes House | id = ISBN 1-84309-864-4 }}</ref> At the start of the race, Prost got the better start of the two, but whilst braking for the first corner,Senna  and Prost collided forcing them both to retire and leaving Senna as champion.<ref>{{cite book | first = Mark | last = Hughes | title = The Unofficial Complete Encyclopedia Of Formula One | pages = Page 75, Line 18-29 | publisher = Hermes House | id = ISBN 1-84309-864-4 }}</ref> A year later, Senna admitted  that the move was premeditated, in retalitation for Prost taking the two out of the race at the chicane on the same course the previous year when in a similar postion.<ref>''Ayrton Senna attacks Jean-Marie Balestre'' [http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00090.html GrandPrix.com]. Retrieved 11 October 2006</ref> 

After Prost returned for the [[1993 Formula One season|1993 season]], he and Senna continued their rivalry. Prost was escorted by Police to the Interlagos circuit for the [[1993 Brazilian Grand Prix]] due to the hostilility of Brazilians towards him.<Ref>{{cite book | first = Derick | last = Allsop | title = Designs on Victory: On the Grand Prix Trail With Benetton | publisher = Hutchinson | id = ISBN 0-09-178311-9 }}</ref> The two continued their on-track battles at [[1993 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]] where Senna aggressively defended his position against the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] of Prost.<ref>{{cite web | title = Grand Prix Results: British GP, 1993 | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr541.html | publisher = GrandPrix.com | accessdate = 2006-11-07 }}</ref> 

On [[May 1]], [[1994]], Ayrton Senna died at the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]]. Prost was a [[pallbearer]] at the Brazilian's funeral. Speaking four years after the Brazilian's death, Prost told [[Nigel Roebuck]] that he had "always refused to speak about him." But when Senna died, Prost stated that "a part of himself had died also", because their careers had been so bound together.<ref>''Ayrton Senna - By Alain Prost'' [http://www.prostfan.com/senna2.htm ProstFan.com] Paragraph 3. Retrieved 16 August 2006</ref> 

Senna had also felt the same when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he admitted to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Alain Prost. Only a couple of days before his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel [[TF1]], he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: "I'd like to welcome back my friend Alain - we all miss you...'

Alain Prost uses a helmet design based on the three colours of the [[Flag of France|French Flag]], those being blue, red and white, along with his name along the side. During his early career however, Prost used a basic design of white all over with some blue detail around the visor.<ref>''Grande Pr<U+011B>mio da Argentina de 1980'' [http://www.lookweb.com.br/medaglia/f1/80/8001arg/8001arg.html LookWeb.com.br]. Retrieved 12 October 2006</ref> During Prost's time at Renault, he used more blue details, most notably around the rear of his helmet.<ref>''Picture: Alain Prost Renault F1'' [http://www.flagworld.com/1978-79-80-81/1981_15AlainProstRenault2.jpg Flagworld.com]. Retrieved 12 October 2006</ref> Prost kept the similar design for his second spell at McLaren the only varient being the change in sponsor logos. Prost's helmet changed when he moved to Ferrari, as his helmet now had the blue detail around the front; surrounding the visor.<ref>''Alain Prost Helmet'' [http://www.jmjauto.com/New%20Photos%204-08-03/Prost%201990%20helmet.jpg JmJauto.com]. Retrieved 12 October 2006</ref> The helmet design didn't change when Prost moved to Williams, like his move from Renault to McLaren in 1984, the only change to his helmet was the change in sponsor logos.

The sponsors on Alain's helmet have been [[Hugo Boss|Boss]], [[Canon (company)|Canon]], [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]], [[Ferrari]], [[Honda]], KicKers, [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]], [[Michelin]], [[Mo<U+00EB>t et Chandon|Mo<U+00EB>t]], [[Sega]], Segafredo Zanetti and [[Renault]].

==Later life==
During 1994 and 1995, Prost worked as TV pundit for the French TV channel, [[TF1]].<ref name="Later Life">''Alain Prost Information - Alain's career year by year, 1973 - 2006'' [http://www.prostfan.com/infos.htm ProstFan.com]. Retrieved 11 October 2006</ref> He also worked for [[Renault]] as a [[Public Relations|PR man]].<ref name="Later Life" /> Prost went back to his old team [[McLaren]], working as a Technical Advisor; he also compteted in the [[L'Etape du Tour]], which is a bicycle race held in France.<ref name="Later Life" /> more than 5000 other riders took part, Prost himself finished 12th in his category; 42nd overall.<ref name="Later Life" />

===Prost Grand Prix===

[[Image:Olivier_Panis_1998.jpg|Prost Grand Prix, 1998|thumb|200px|left|[[Olivier Panis]] driving for the Prost Grand Prix team at the [[1998 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]
During 1989, Prost had an idea to start his own team, as his relationship with his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and his race engineer, [[John Barnard]], came close to founding a team in 1990 but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after extensive negotiations with [[Guy Ligier]], head of the [[Ligier]] team, had failed Prost decided to join Williams.<ref name="Prost Renault">''Team Prost - a dream or reality?'' [http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00198.html GrandPrix.com]. Retrieved 12 October 2006</ref>

It wasn't until 1995, when Prost was working for [[Renault]], that people began to assume that a Prost-Renault team would be formed in the near future. Renault refused to Prost's request to supply engines for his team and ending speculation that a Prost-Renault team would be formed. <ref name="Prost Renault" />

On [[February 13]] [[1997]], Alain Prost bought the [[Ligier]] team from [[Flavio Briatore]] and renamed it "''Prost Grand Prix''".<ref name="Prost GP">''GrandPrix.com > GP Encyclopedia > Constructor > Prost Grand Prix [http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/con-prost.html GrandPrix.com]. Retrived September 8 2006</ref> The day after he bought the team, Prost signed a three-year deal with French car manufacturer, [[Peugeot]], who would supply the team for the [[1998 Formula One season|1998 season]] through to the [[2000 Formula One season|2000 season]].<ref name="Prost GP" /> For the team's first season, Prost kept one of Ligier's 1996 drivers, [[Olivier Panis]], who had won the [[1996 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] the previous year; [[Japan|Japanese]] driver [[Shinji Nakano]], was signed to partner Panis. The team raced with the [[Mugen Motorsports|Mugen]]-[[Honda]] engines used by the Ligier team the previous season. Things looked promising at the start of the season, as the team had picked up two points on its Grand Prix debut in [[1997 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], Olivier Panis scoring the points after he finished fifth. The team scored a further 13 points until Panis had a collision during the [[1997 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]], Panis was replaced by [[Minardi]]'s [[Jarno Trulli]]. From there, things started to go downhill slightly, the team scored five points during Panis' recovery. The Frechman came back at the end of the season to race the final three Grand Prix. Prost GP finished sixth in the Contructors' championship in its first season, scoring 21 points.

Prost became the president of Prost Grand Prix at the start of [[1998 Formula One season|1998]]. With Peugeot supplying the engines for Prost GP, Mugen-Honda decided to supply the [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] team. Prost GP scored a single point during the season, Jarno Trulli scoring the only point after he finished sixth in [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]]. 

[[1999 Formula One season|1999]] was a crucial year for Prost GP,<ref>Jean-Michel Desnoues; Patrick Camus & Jean-Marc Loubat <u>Formula 1 99</u> . Queen Anne Press. ISBN 1852916060</ref> Prost hired [[John Barnard]] as a technical consultant.<ref name="Prost GP" /> Barnard's B3 Technologies helping Loic Bigois and the design of the AP02. Panis and Trulli agreed to stay on with the team for the season; the car itself didn't prove to be the team's major concern, it was the Peugeot engine that proved to be unreliable and too heavy.

Peugeot's final year of Prost's engine supplier in [[2000 Formula One season|2000]] would see some optimism, Prost hiring his 1991 Ferrari team mate [[Jean Alesi]] to drive the lead car and he hired [[Germany|German]] [[Nick Heidfeld]], who had won the Formula 3000 championship the previous year. The season proved to be yet another disastrous one, with newly hired technical director, Alan Jenkins, fired midway through the season. Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team's new technical director.<ref name="Prost GP" />

[[2001 Formula One season|2001]] saw some much needed optimism for the team as [[Ferrari]] agreed to be the team's engine supplier for the season, the team now moving in the right direction.<ref name="Prost GP" /> But the money ran out at the start of the [[2002 Formula One season|2002]] season and Prost was out of business, leaving debts of around $30 million.<ref name="Prost GP" />

===After Prost Grand Prix===
During 2002, Prost spent time with his family and competed in eight bicycle races, finishing third in the ''Granite - Mont Loz<U+00E8>re''.<ref>''Alain Prost 2002 Bicycle Racing'' [http://www.prostfan.com/2002.htm ProstFan.com].
