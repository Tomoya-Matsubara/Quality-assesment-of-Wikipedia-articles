'''''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan''''' (often shortened to '''''Borat''''') is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[mockumentary]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Larry Charles]]. It stars the [[British people|British]] comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] in the [[Borat Sagdiyev|title role]] of a fictitious [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] journalist, traveling through the [[United States]] recording real-life interactions with Americans. It is the second film built around one of Cohen's characters from ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'', following ''[[Ali G Indahouse]]'', which also featured a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by Borat.

It was a critical and commercial success, despite an initially limited release in the [[United States]]. Cohen won the [[64th Golden Globe Awards|2007 Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor: Musical or Comedy]] as Borat while the film was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]] in the same category.<ref name="Globe">[http://www.hfpa.org/nominations/index.html "Nominations & winners"], ''[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]'', [[2006]]. Retrieved on 2007-03-17.</ref> ''Borat'' was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] at the [[79th Academy Awards]] but lost to ''[[The Departed]]''.

Controversy surrounded the film even before its release. It has been criticised for having a protagonist who is [[Sexism|sexist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] (although Cohen is [[Jew]]ish himself), and some who have appeared in the film have criticised and even sued its creators. All [[Arab world|Arab countries]], except for [[Lebanon]], banned it,<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=The Guardian|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1961870,00.html |work=Guardian Unlimited Film|date=[[2006-12-01]]|title= Arab countries ban Borat|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> and the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] successfully discouraged cinemas there from showing it.<ref name="Russiaban">{{cite news|work= International Herald Tribune|publisher= [[New York Times]]|date=[[2006-11-09]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/09/news/borat.php|title=Moscow gives 'Borat' a thumb's down: Satirical film fails to get certification"|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> It was released on [[DVD]] [[March 5]], [[2007]] (a day later in [[DVD region code|Region 1]] countries).

==Plot==
[[Image:boratmoi.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Borat and Azamat meet with the fictitious Kazakh Ministry of Information, which commissions them to make a documentary]]

[[Borat|Borat Sagdiyev]] (Sacha Baron Cohen), a popular Kazakh [[television personality]], leaves his homeland for the 'Greatest Country in the World,' the "[[United States|US and A]]" to make a [[documentary film|documentary]] at the behest of the fictitious Kazakh Ministry of Information. He leaves behind his mother, his sister, his wife Oksana and the town rapist, bringing along his producer Azamat Bagatov ([[Ken Davitian]]). Much of the movie features unscripted [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] of Borat interviewing and interacting with Americans who believe he is a foreigner with no understanding of [[Culture of the United States|American customs]].<ref name="Salon">Marchese, David and Paskin, Willa.

While in [[New York City|New York]], he sees an episode of ''[[Baywatch]]'' on television and immediately falls in love with [[Pamela Anderson]]. He questions the [[Veteran Feminists of America]], learning her name and that she lives in [[California]]. He receives a telegram and learns, much to his delight, that his violent wife has been violated and killed by a bear. He resolves to go to California to 'have' Anderson's "[[Vagina|vazh<U+00EF>n]]" and make her his new wife. Borat and Azamat were supposed to remain in New York, but Borat justifies the trip by telling the skeptical producer that "[[Pearl Harbor]] is there (California) and so is [[Texas]]". As Azamat is afraid to fly there for fear of a repetition of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], which he believes were [[9/11 conspiracy theories#Claims related to Jews and Israel|the work of the Jews]], Borat takes driving lessons and buys a dilapidated [[Ice cream van|ice cream truck]] for the journey.

During the cross-country trip, Borat acquires a ''Baywatch'' television show booklet at a [[yard sale]], and continues gathering [[footage]] for his documentary. He meets [[gay pride parade]] participants, [[politician]]s (including [[Alan Keyes]] and [[Bob Barr]]) and [[African American]] youths playing [[Cee-lo]]. He is also interviewed on live television and proceeds to disrupt the weather report. Visiting a [[rodeo]], the reporter, after first exciting the crowd with [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] pro-U.S. remarks, sings a fictional Kazakhstan [[national anthem]] to the tune of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", which receives a strong negative reaction. Staying at a [[bed and breakfast]], Borat and his producer are stunned to learn that their hosts are [[Jews|Jewish]]. Fearful of death (or worse) at the hands of their hosts, the two "escape" after throwing money toward [[cockroach]]es which they believe are their Jewish hosts [[shapeshifting|self-transformed]]. While Azamat advises a return to New York (where at least, he believes, there are no Jews), Borat attempts to purchase a [[handgun]] to defend himself against Jews. When told he cannot buy a gun because he is not an [[United States nationality law|American citizen]], Borat purchases a [[bear]], which he names after his late wife, for protection.

Borat later attends a private dinner at an eating club in the [[Southern United States|South]], at which he (unintentionally) insults or otherwise offends the other guests, and visits an [[antique]] shop with a display of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] heritage items, breaking glass and [[Dishware|crockery]].

The journey is interrupted when Borat, just out of the bathtub, exits the bathroom of his hotel room and sees Azamat [[masturbation|masturbating]] over a picture of Pamela Anderson in the ''Baywatch'' book. Borat becomes enraged and discloses his real reason for traveling to California. Things escalate into a fully nude brawl, with what have been described as homoerotic undertones,<ref>Rabin, Nathan. [http://www.avclub.com/content/node/54822 Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan.] A.V. Club, 2006-11-2. Retrieved on 2007-04-09.</ref> which spills out into the hallway, a crowded elevator, and ultimately into a packed [[ballroom]] filled with mortgage brokers at a convention. The two are finally separated by security guards.

As a result, Azamat abandons Borat, taking his [[passport]], all of their money, and their bear, whose head is later seen inside a motel [[refrigerator]]. Borat begins to [[hitchhiking|hitchhike]] to California, but is soon picked up by Anthony, Justin and David, drunken [[University of South Carolina]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] brothers. On learning the reason for his trip, they show him the ''Pam and Tommy'' sex video, revealing that she is not the virgin he thought she was. After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the ''Baywatch'' booklet and, by mistake, his return [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] to Kazakhstan. He regains his faith after attending a [[United Pentecostal Church|United Pentecostal]] camp meeting, at which [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Chip Pickering]] and current [[Supreme Court of Mississippi|Mississippi Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[James W. Smith, Jr.]] are present. He learns to forgive Azamat and Pamela. He accompanies church members on a bus to [[Los Angeles]] and disembarks to find Azamat dressed as [[Oliver Hardy]] (though Borat thinks that he is dressed as [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]). The two reconcile and Azamat tells Borat where to find Pamela Anderson.

Borat finally comes face-to-face with Anderson at a book signing at a [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin Megastore]]. After showing Anderson his "[[Bride kidnapping|traditional marriage sack]]," Borat pursues her throughout the store in an attempt to abduct her until he is tackled and handcuffed by security guards. Afterwards, Borat seeks out and marries a [[prostitute]] named [[Luenell]], whom he had befriended earlier in the film, and returns to Kazakhstan with her. The final scene shows the changes that Borat's observations in America have brought to his village, including the apparent conversion of the people to [[Christianity]] (the Kazakh version of which includes [[crucifixion]] of Jews) and the introduction of computer-based technology, such as [[iPod]]s, [[laptop]] computers and a high-definition, [[LCD]] television.

== Deleted scenes ==
The DVD included several deleted scenes from the film, including Borat being questioned by police officers at a traffic stop, visiting an animal shelter to get a dog to protect him from Jews, getting a massage at a hotel, and visiting an American doctor. There is also a montage of scenes cut from the film, including Borat taking a job at [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]] and taking part in a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[American Civil War reenactment|reenactment]]. The deleted scenes menu also includes an actual local TV news report about Borat's rodeo singing and a final "happy ending" scene about Borat appearing in a Kazakh show entitled "''Sexydrownwatch''', a ''[[Baywatch]]'' clone which also starred Azamat, Luenell, and [[Alexandra Paul]].

A scene in which Borat was apparently imprisoned was also filmed, but removed under the threat of legal action by prison officials when they caught on to the "documentary's" true nature.<ref name="prison">Perry, Tony.

[[Dan Mazer]] confirmed in an interview that there was a scene cut in which Borat took part in the shooting of an actual pornographic film. He claimed the scene was cut for fears of excess alongside the naked hotel fight, although he had then anticipated it may be included on the DVD release.<ref name="Mazer">[http://www.fantasymoguls.com/Video.aspx?bcpid=326858045&bclid=323642767&bctid=353579070 "Porn Scene Cut from Borat"], FantasyMoguls.com.

=== Scaled-back U.S. release ===
In late October 2006, less than two weeks before the film's debut, [[Twentieth Century Fox]] scaled back its American release from about 2,000 to 800 cinemas after marketing-survey data showed unexpectedly poor levels of audience awareness. The move surprised industry professionals, who could not recall such a move being made so close to a film's release.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=412814 |work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=[[2006-10-26]]|title=American cinemas close doors on new Borat movie|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Despite this move, the film opened at number one in the box office, maintaining first place for two weeks straight. The film actually earned more in the second week ($28,269,900) than in the first ($26,455,463), due to an expansion onto 2,566 screens.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443453/business |work=[[IMDB]]|title=Box Office and Business for Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>

== Reception ==
=== Critical ===
''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'' was exceptionally well received by critics. In an article about the changing face of comedy, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' (which does not review films) said that it "may be the funniest film in a decade".<ref>{{cite journal| last = Hirschorn | first = Michael | title = Thank You, YouTube: DIY video is making merely professional television seem stodgy, slow, and hopelessly last century | journal = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] |date= November 2006 | pages = 147}}</ref> [[Michael Medved]] gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it "..simultaneously hilarious and cringe-inducing, full of ingenious bits that you'll want to describe to your friends and then laugh all over again when you do."<ref>[http://images.michaelmedved.com/images/pdf/borat.doc Borat].

One negative review came from British critic [[Mark Kermode]], who noted that he was the only one not laughing at his screening. He claimed that the film had a rampant undertone of [[anti-Americanism]] and that it failed to get beyond just laughing at the average [[blue-collar]] American.<ref name="MarkArchive">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/entertainment/kermode_archive_b.shtml BBC Film Live - Mark Kermode Film Reviews archive].

After the movie's release, Dharma Arthur, a news producer for [[WAPT]] television in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], wrote a letter to ''Newsweek'' saying that Borat's appearance on the station had led to her losing her job: "Because of him, my boss lost faith in my abilities and second-guessed everything I did thereafter... How upsetting that a man who leaves so much harm in his path is lauded as a comedic genius." Although Arthur has said she was fired from the show, she told the AP that she left the station.<ref>Carlson, Erin (November 13, 2006), [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/13/AR2006111300329.html 'Borat' Victims Upset at Being Duped], ''washingtonpost.com''</ref> She claims to have checked a public relations website that Borat's producers gave her before booking him.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,226960,00.html | title=Dharma and <U+2026> Borat?

In news coverage that aired in January 2005 of the filming of the rodeo scene, Bobby Rowe, producer of the [[Salem, Virginia]] rodeo depicted in the movie, provided background on how he had become the victim of a [[hoax]].

Etiquette expert Cindy Streit of Birmingham, Alabama said that prior to Borat's visit, she thought it would be a "wonderful opportunity to display some of our positive strengths. I'm proud to be an American, so I wanted to show this man our gracious [[Southern hospitality]]"; instead, the visit became "the dinner party from hell."

There are conflicting reports regarding the feelings of the participants of the scenes in which Borat and Azamat stay at a guest house owned by a Jewish couple. The British newspaper ''[[The Sun]]'' claims that a scene depicting cockroaches running around in their home has hurt Mariam and Joseph Behar's business in [[Newton, Massachusetts]].

=== Censorship ===
The State Movie Commission of Russia (''[[Goskino]]'') recommended that Russian theaters not show ''Borat'', citing "insulting remarks toward some ethnic groups and religions" as the reason. Russia contains some 650,000 ethnic Kazakhs in addition to thousands of Jews and Romas (Gypsies). Most Russian theaters will not show a film that hasn't been certified by Goskino. The movie became the first non-pornographic movie so treated in [[Russia]] since the fall of the Soviet Union.<ref name="Russiaban"/>

The film was [[Ban (law)|banned]] in the entire Arab world except for [[Lebanon]]. Yousuf Abdul Hamid, a film censor for [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]], called the film <U+201C>vile, gross and extremely ridiculous." The censor also noted he and his colleagues had actually walked out on their screening before it had ended, and that only half an hour of the movie would be left once all the offensive scenes were removed.<ref>

* [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as [[Borat|Borat Sagdiyev]]. Borat is a fictional journalist from [[Kazakhstan]], distinguished by exaggeratedly strong [[misogyny]], [[anti-Semitism]] and [[antiziganism]], which is apparently the norm in his homeland. Borat was originally created as a character for ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' and had appeared in every episode of the show.
* [[Ken Davitian]] as Azamat Bagatov. The producer of Borat's documentary. Azamat was a new character created for the film. Davitian, as "The fat guy from Borat", was included at #2 on a list of "The 100 Unsexiest Men" by the [[The Phoenix (newspaper)|Boston Phoenix]].<ref>[http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid37418.aspx The 100 unsexiest men 2007: 10-1.] The Boston Phoenix, 2007-04-14.

* [[Luenell]] as Luenell the prostitute. Luenell is the third and last completely fictional character in the film. She is first seen when Borat calls her to come to the Southern dinner, the climax of his effective destruction of the event.
* [[Pamela Anderson]]. Pamela Anderson plays a central role in the film as the reason for the journalist's cross country journey. She also appears in person at the end of the film, as herself, in a (staged) botched abduction attempt by Borat.<ref name="postpam"/>

The soundtrack for ''Borat'' was released on [[October 24]], [[2006]] on [[iTunes Store]], and [[October 31]], [[2006]] in shops. The album included music from the film, five tracks consisting of and titled "Dialoguing excerpt from moviefilm", as well as the controversial anti-Semitic song "[[In My Country There Is Problem]]" from ''Da Ali G Show''.<ref>[http://www.spin.com/features/news/2006/10/061012_borat/ Don't Throw 'Borat' Soundtrack Down the Well.] SPIN.com, 2006-10-12.

== DVD release ==
[[Image:Borat DVD.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The ''Borat'' DVD in faux-pirate style. The region-1 release lacked the rating symbols and company logos. DVDs in other regions lessened the effect by adding various symbols.<ref name="dvd"/>]]

The region 2 DVD was released [[March 5]], [[2007]], with the region 1 release the following day.<ref>[http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/59/16859.php Borat DVD to Be Released As Is on March 6.] Movieweb.com, 2007-01-09. Retrieved on 2007-03-11.</ref><ref>[http://www.allocine.co.uk/film/disponibledvd_gen_cfilm=109678.html Borat: In DVD!]. Allocine.co.uk. Retrieved on 2007-03-11.</ref> Special features include [[deleted scenes]], faux advertisements for the soundtrack album, and a complete [[Russian language]] translation audio track using a professional dubbing cast, in addition to the [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language]] tracks common on Region 1 (US/Canada) DVDs. There is also a choice of Hebrew as well, but this is merely a joke. Choosing the Hebrew language option results in a warning screen appears reading "You have been trapped, Jew!" which warns the viewer not to change his shape and keep his claws where they can be seen, again playing on the anti-Semitism supposedly prevalent in Borat's version of Kazakhstan. It also includes footage of Borat's publicity tour for the film, with Cohen in character as Borat on the ''[[Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Late Night With Conan O'Brien]]'', the [[Toronto Film Festival]], and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Also, there is a section of [[WSLS-TV|a news story from Virginia]], about Borat and the rodeo he visited with the Rodeo owner (Bobby Rowe) being interviewed

As a play on the intellectual property piracy common in the former [[Soviet Union]], the packaging of the Region 1 (United States/Canada), 2 (Europe/Japan/South Africa/Middle East) and 4 (Latin America/Oceania) editions mimics a foreign bootleg DVD. The slipcover is in English but the case itself has all-Cyrillic text (a majority of which is in legitimate Russian, not faux Cyrillic) and is made to look poorly photocopied. The disc itself is made to look like a "Demorez" [[DVD-R]] (a parody of [[Memorex]], with the similar slogan "Is life? No. Demorez.") with the word "BO<U+042F>AT" appearing to be crudely written in marker and the "R" [[Ya (Cyrillic)|written backwards]].<ref name="dvd">Couture, John.   [http://videoeta.com/news/2236 'Borat' DVD gets pirated... NOT!] VideoETA.com, 2007-03-02. Retrieved on 2007-03-11.</ref> Backwards R is actually a Russian vowel in the same way the Russian D is used for an A.  The UMD version is similar to the DVD, even being labelled a "UMD-R" (which do not actually exist). Even the Fox in-cover advertising is written in broken English that appears poorly printed, indicating that there are "More movie discs available from us&a" and "Also legal to own in Kazakhstan".

There are further jokes within the DVD itself. The menus are styled as a worn, static-laden film on an erratically functioning projector, with more Cyrillic writing accompanied with translations in broken English. The DVD is described as a "prerecorded moviedisc for purpose domestic viewing of moviefilm" and the viewer is warned that "selling piratings of this moviedisc will result in punishment by [[crushing]]." The DVD's collection of trailers promises these films are "coming Kazakhstan in 2028."
