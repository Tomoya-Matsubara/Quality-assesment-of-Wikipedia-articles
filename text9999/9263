{{seealso|Economic History of Hamilton, Ontario|Economy of Hamilton, Ontario|}}

''Burlington Street's'' original name was ''Industrial Road''. It derives its name from its proximity to Hamilton Harbour, which used to be called [[Burlington Bay]]. After [[World War II]], when Hamilton was at its industrial peak, ''Burlington Street'' was the address of some of the city's most prestigious manufacturing companies. In the 1950s, the Canadian head offices of [[Stelco]], [[Dofasco]], [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], [[International Harvester]], [[Procter & Gamble]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] were situated on or close to ''Burlington Street''. <ref name=HAMNAMES>{{cite book|title=Hamilton Street Names: An Illustrated Guide|first=Margaret |last=Houghton|publisher=James Lorimer & Co.
