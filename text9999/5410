'''Midway High Lakes Area''', also known as '''High Lakes Area''' is a [[United States Forest Service]] designated area located in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]<U+2019>s [[Cascade Mountains]]. It lies on a high plateau on [[Mount Adams (Washington) | Mount Adams]]' northwestern flank. It is between the [[Goat Rocks]] on the north and [[Mount Hood]] to the south and contains '''[[Takhlakh Lake]]''' along with several other lakes. The area offers five scenic high elevation lakes all within a seven mile radius. It is administered by the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]]. While even the most visited areas at Mount Adams pale in comparison to nearby [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]] or [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]], it is by its own standards one of the most popular recreational areas around [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]]. Some of the lakes offers photogenic views of Mount Adams from across the lake.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gifford Pinchot National Forest: Midway High Lakes|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/giffordpinchot/about-forest|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Trail #116 High Lakes|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recreation/recarea/?recid=31296&actid=24|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref>

The Midway High Lakes Area lies below the volcanic peak of {{Convert|12276|ft|m|0}} [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]], and [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]] cascading from the summit in a series of [[icefall|icefalls]]. It is the second largest glacier in the [[State of Washington]], after [[Carbon Glacier]] on [[Mount Rainier]]. The area is characterized by several volcanic features in addition to Mount Adams, such as the Takh Takh Lava Flow, the Muddy Fork Lava Flows, and Potato Hill, a small 200 foot tall cinder cone below the Muddy Fork Lava Flows. There are some meadows and marshes, with Takh Takh Meadows being the most well known. Muddy Meadows is another named meadow in the High Lakes Area, near Riley Horse Camp and Muddy Meadows Trail accessing the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] and the [[Mount Adams Wilderness]].<ref>{{cite web|title=High Lakes Area Map|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/PA_WIDConsumption/wid/EnlargeImage.jsp?param5=null&param1=PA_WIDConsumption&param2=STELPRDB5172079&param3=A%20map%20depicting%20trails%20in%20the%20High%20Lakes%20area%20within%20the%20Cowlitz%20Valley%20vicinity.&param4=/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5172079.jpg&pname=Forest%20Service|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref>
