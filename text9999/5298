'''Fajsz''' ({{IPA-hu|f<U+0252>js}}), also '''Falicsi''', was [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]] from about 950 to around 955. All information on him comes from ''[[De administrando imperio]]'', a book written by the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]]. No other contemporary source or later Hungarian chronicle preserved his name, suggesting that he did not take an active role in the politics of the [[Hungarian tribes]]' confederation. 

==Life==
Fajsz was the only known son of Jutotzas, the third son of [[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d]] who led the [[Hungarian tribes]]' confederation at the time of [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|their conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] between around 895 and 907.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|pp=18<U+2013>22}} After <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d's death,{{sfn|Moln<U+00E1>r|2001|p=17}} fundamental changes happened in the government of the tribal confederation.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=189}} Although the various tribes could even thereafter act in concert for raids, they did not obey a strong central authority any more.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=20}}

Even so, as the historian Mikl<U+00F3>s Moln<U+00E1>r emphasizes, "the supremacy of the [[House of <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d]] seems to have remained unshaken."{{sfn|Moln<U+00E1>r|2001|p=17}} For instance, Hungarian visitors to [[Constantinople]]{{spaced ndash}}including Termatzus, a great-grandson{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|ps=, Appendix 1.}} of <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d{{spaced ndash}} informed Emperor Constantine VII around 948 that the "first chief" of the Hungarians "comes by succession of <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d's family".<ref>''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 40), p. 179.</ref>{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=20}} [[Constantine VII]] also mentions that Fajsz was the head of the confederation of the Hungarian tribes around 950. The historian Gyula Krist<U+00F3> proposes that Fajsz abdicated after the Hungarians' catastrophic defeat by the [[Germans]] in the [[battle of Lechfeld]] in 955.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=23}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=20}}

==Name and legacy==
Fajsz's name, which was preserved in two forms{{spaced ndash}}"Phalitzi" and "Phalis"{{spaced ndash}}{{sfn|Kord<U+00E9>|1994|p=207}} may be connected either to the Hungarian word for "half" ''(f<U+00E9>l)'' or to the verb ''fal'' ("to gobble up").{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=22}} Historian [[Gy<U+00F6>rgy Gy<U+00F6>rffy]] proposes that the villages named Fajsz in the [[Carpathian Basin]]{{spaced ndash}}for instance, [[Fajsz, Hungary|the one]] in [[B<U+00E1>cs-Kiskun County]] ([[Hungary]]){{spaced ndash}}were named after him.{{sfn|Kord<U+00E9>|1994|p=207}} Based on the recorded Phalitzi form of Fajsz's name, Gyula Krist<U+00F3> rejects this hypothesis.{{sfn|Kord<U+00E9>|1994|p=207}}
