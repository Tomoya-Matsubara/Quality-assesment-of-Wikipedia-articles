{{Other|Lorne}}
'''Lorne''' was an electoral district that existed in the [[District of Saskatchewan]], [[Northwest Territories]] from 1880 until 1888. The district was one of the first three created by Royal Proclamation in 1880. Of the first three electoral districts proclaimed it was the only one to actually have an election held in it. 

Under the ''Northwest Territories Act 1880'' the district was mandated at its inception to return a single member to the Northwest Territories Legislature under the [[First Past the Post]] electoral system. The district was named in the honor of former [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], the [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]]. Lorne would tour the through the Northwest Territories just after the electoral district was created in 1881.

The electoral district ceased to exist at the drop of the writ for the [[Northwest Territories general election, 1888|1888 Northwest Territories general election]]. This was due to a population boom in the area caused by an influx of settlers. The electoral district was redistributed and split between the electoral districts of [[Batoche (N.W.T. electoral district)|Batoche]] and the [[Prince Albert (N.W.T. electoral district)|Prince Albert]] electoral district. During the nine years the district existed, it returned three members through three elections who served roughly three year terms.
== Overview==
The electoral district was one of three royally proclaimed by [[Lieutenant-Governors of Northwest Territories|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[David Laird (19th Century politician)|David Laird]] on [[November 13]], [[1880]]<ref name=proclo>{{cite book|title=Ordinances of the Northwest Territories 1881 | date = 1882 | publisher = P. G. Laurie, Printer to the Government of the Northwest Territories | pages= 6}}</ref> The other two electoral districts were '''Salisbury''', named after the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] and '''Kimberley''' name after the Lord of Kimberley. Kimberley's contribution to the Northwest Territories was transferring the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] to [[Canada]] on [[September 1]], [[1880]]. <ref name="transfer">{{cite web| url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic14-1-53.pdf | author = Gordon W. Smith | title=The Transfer of Arctic Territories from Great Britain to Canada in 1880 |pages=63 |publisher=University of Calgary | accessdate = 2007-10-06}}</ref> 

The electoral district was created with the provision to cover an area of 1000 square miles and have a population of 1000 electors. The major population centres in the electoral district at the time of creation were [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]], and [[Fort Carlton]].<ref name=proclo/> The land around the district boomed due to a high rate of settlement in that period. The cause of this was due to the possibility of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific]] transcontinental railway line being built through the area.

The Northwest Territories political system used at this time was run by an early form of [[consensus government]]. Candidates stood for election independent of the political parties that exist in other provinces and territories and the federal level within Canada.<ref name="consensus">{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.gov.nt.ca/_live/pages/wpPages/publicinformationfactsheets.aspx | title = Consensus Government | publisher = The Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories | accessdate= 2007-11-08}}</ref> The government had not yet developed to the point of being a [[Responsible government]] as the majority of members were appointed and not elected.<ref name="oldresults"/> The district was served by three representatives during its eight year history.<ref name="oldresults"/>

===1881 election===
The 1881 by-election held on [[March 23]], [[1881]] was a pivotal milestone towards [[Responsible Government]] being attained in the [[Northwest Territories]]. The election marked the first time the provision of the ''North-West Territories Act 1880'' that allowed for a electoral district to be proclaimed if an area the size of 1000 square miles had 1000 residents had been activated.

The election was conducted by voice vote, a qualified elector would tell the returning officer at a polling station who he was going to vote for and the results would be tallied. Under the terms of the Act eligible electors were males who had reached the age of majority, which was 21 years of age at that time. The act specifically specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens and unenfranchised Indians. Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.<ref name=qual>{{cite book|title=Ordinances of the Northwest Territories 1881 | date = 1882 | publisher = P. G. Laurie, Printer to the Government of the Northwest Territories | pages= 53}}</ref>

The election commenced when [[Lieutenant-Governors of Northwest Territories|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[David Laird (19th Century politician)|David Laird]] dropped the writ on 1881. The election was contested by two candidates, Lawrence Clarke who was a fur trader and Chief Factor of the [[District of Saskatchewan]] for the [[Hudsons Bay Company]].<ref name="clarke">{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=39559 | publisher = Library and Archives Canada | title = Lawrence Clarke Biography| accessdate = 2007-10-06}}</ref> Clarke's opponent was Henry Stewart Moore a local French speaking businessman from [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] who had been operating a flower mill since 1875.<ref name="moore">{{cite web| url=http://fransaskois.sk.ca/communaute/community/pa/chapitre1.htm | language = French | title= Chapitre un Les d<U+00E9>buts | publisher = Assembl<U+00E9>e communautaire fransaskoise | accessdate = 2007-10-06}}</ref>

Clarke held a big advantage in the campaign as he was supported by the [[M<U+00E9>tis]] who had been looking for someone to locally represent them in the Legislature since the territory was formed in 1870.<ref name="proof"/> Clarke had also built his popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader. On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory. He defeated Moore winning nearly 64% of popular vote.<ref name="oldresults"/> His resounding win would make him the first elected member in Northwest Territories history.

===1883 election===
Nearing the end of his term in office Clarke decided not to run for re-election in 1883. He was losing to much support due to his ties with the [[Hudson Bay Company]]. The electorate suspected him of working under the influence of his office to locate important government offices on the land owned by the company.<ref name="clarke"/> Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election, Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter.

Porter was famous for being the first registered private practicing medical doctor in the history of the Northwest Territories. He originally settled in Prince Albert in 1878.<ref name="porter">{{cite web|url =http://members.shaw.ca/bcsk/primsrcf/letters/porter_railway.htm | title = Andrew Porter letter | publisher = University of Saskatchewan Libraries | accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>
MacDowall campaigned by appealing to the concerns of the M<U+00E9>tis who comprised the largest demographic in the district. He promised them that he would go to the Federal Government with their demands for better representation. He also helped win support by donating $1,100 out of pocket towards the construction of a new church for the community of [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]].<ref name="proof">{{cite web|url =http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Batoche/docs/proof_en_why_did_the_1885_res.pdf | title = Why did the 1885 Resistance Happen? | publisher = Virtual Museum of Canada | accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> MacDowall's campaign efforts proved to be very popular. 

MacDowall's appeal for representation translated into a landslide victory on election day. On [[June 5]], [[1883]] he defeated Andrew Porter capturing nearly 70% of the popular vote. His win was the largest majority of the three elections held in the electoral district.<ref name="oldresults"/>

===1885 election===
The 1885 election in this district was held on [[September 15]], [[1885]] as part of the [[Northwest Territories election, 1885|1885 Northwest Territories election]]. This was the first major election held in the Northwest Territories. The election grouped together a number of old districts that had been coming up for renewal on their three year cycle and by-elections in new districts that were created by a population boom of settlers moving into the territory.

Incumbent MacDowall, had played a major role in subduing the [[North-West Rebellion]] at the end of his term in office.<ref name="MacDowall">{{cite web|url=http://www.kylesociety.org/Kyle_chiefmcdowall.htm|title=Chief Fergus Hort Day Macdowall of Garthland | publisher = Kyle Family Society | accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> He would not run for re-election instead choosing to campaign for a seat in the [[Canadian House of Commons]].<ref name="macdhocprofile">{{cite web | url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=a956d6f0-b2b4-477f-a37e-3e7d8acef076&Language=E|title=Day Hort MacDowall Federal Political Experience |publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> Dr. Porter attempted to win a seat by running for office a second time. Porter was challenged by Captain Owen Hughes, a business man from [[Duck Lake, Saskatchewan|Duck Lake]]. Hughes gained fame after he had participated in the rebellion earning the rank of Captain. He commanded a unit that drove loyalist forces back at the [[Battle of Fish Creek]], after it had been disbanded by [[Louis Riel]].<ref name="phoenix">{{cite book|publisher=Saskatoon Star Phoenix | title= Gabriel Dumont: A Rebel Who Won Deepest Respect | pages = 13 | last = McCook | first = James}}</ref>

On election day, despite increasing his popular share of the vote over the 1883 election, Porter was defeated by Hughes. The race was very tight and hotly contested nearly ending in a tie vote. Hughes captured the electoral district by a margin of eight votes winning just over 51% of the popular vote.<ref name="oldresults"/>
