Smith, the founder of that movement, said he obtained the plates on [[September 22]], [[1827]] on [[Cumorah|Cumorah hill]] in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]], [[New York]], where they were hidden in a buried box and protected by an [[angel Moroni|angel named Moroni]]. After dictating a translation and obtaining signed statements by eleven other witnesses, he said he returned the plates to the angel in 1829.

According to the ''Book of Mormon'', the golden plates were engraved by a [[pre-Columbian]] prophet-warrior named [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] and his son [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]] (who after death protected the buried plates as the [[angel Moroni]]) in about the year 400 CE. These men said they had abridged earlier historical records from other sets of metal plates in a language they called "[[reformed Egyptian]]."<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1830|538}}.</ref> Part of the plates were said to have been sealed, and thus could not be translated. The golden plates are the most significant of a number of metallic plates important to Latter Day Saint history and theology.

As a youth, [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] lived on his parents' farm near [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra, New York]] a place and time noted for its participation in the [[Second Great Awakening]] and a "craze for treasure hunting."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1893}}.

==Obtaining the plates==
Smith said that he first learned about the golden plates on the eve of [[September 22]]<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>[[September 22]] was listed in a local [[almanac]] as the [[autumn equinox|autumnal equinox]], which has led to the suggestion that the date had astrological significance according to Smith's worldview ({{Harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=144}}; {{Harvnb|Owens|1995}}).

FOOTNOTE--><ref>Smith's first mention of the angel in later histories is an appearance on the eve of [[September 22]] [[1823]] {{Harv|Smith|1839<U+2013>1843|p=4}}; however, other accounts say or infer that the angel may have appeared a year earlier in 1822. Smith's first history in 1832 said the angel's first visit was on [[September 22]] [[1822]], although he also said he was "seventeen years of age" {{Harv|Smith|1832|p=3}}, which would have made the year 1823 (he turned 17 in December 1822). In 1835, after [[Oliver Cowdery]] initially dated the angel's visit to the "15th year of our brother J. Smith Jr's, age," he corrected the statement to read the 17th year of his age (16 years old, or 1822) <U+2014>but he said this visit in Smith's "17th year" occurred in 1823 {{Harv|Cowdery|1835a|p=78}}. [[Joseph Smith, Sr.|Smith's father]] is quoted by an inquirer who visited his house in 1830 as saying that the first visit by the angel took place in 1822 but that he did not learn about it until 1823 {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=305}}. A Smith neighbor who said Smith told him the story in 1823 said the angel appeared "a year or two before" the death of Joseph's brother Alvin in November 1823.</ref><!--

--> After his arrival in Palmyra in January 1827, Smith visited the hill and returned to tell his parents that the angel had severely chastised him for not being "engaged enough in the work of the Lord."<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=99}}. Smith's father is cited as stating Smith was late one year and missed the date for visiting the hill, and therefore was chastised by the angel {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=307}}.</ref><!--

--> The next annual visit on [[September 22]] [[1827]] would be his last chance to receive the plates.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Knight|1833|p=3}}.</ref>

According to Brigham Young, as the scheduled date to obtain the plates approached, several Palmyra residents expressed concern "that they were going to lose that treasure" and sent for a skilled necromancer from 60 miles away, encouraging him to make three separate trips to Palmyra to find the plates.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1855|p=180}}.</ref><!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1855|pp=180<U+2013>81}}.</ref><!--

--> A few days prior to the [[September 22]] [[1827]] visit to the hill, Smith's loyal treasure-hunting friends Josiah Stowell and [[Joseph Knight, Sr.]] traveled to Palmyra, in part, to be there during Smith's scheduled visit to the hill.<!--

Another of Smith's former treasure-hunting associates, Samuel T. Lawrence, was also apparently aware of the approaching date to obtain the plates, and Smith was concerned he might cause trouble.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Knight|1833|p=3}} (saying Lawrence was a seer, had been to the hill, and knew what was there).</ref><!--

--> Therefore, on the eve of [[September 22]] [[1827]], the scheduled date for retrieving the plates, Smith dispatched his father to spy on Lawrence's house until dark. If Lawrence attempted to leave, the elder Joseph would have informed him that his son would "thrash the stumps with him" if he found him at the hill, but Lawrence never left his home.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Knight|1833|p=3}}</ref><!--

--> While Emma stayed in the wagon kneeling in prayer,<ref>{{Harv|Harris|1853|p=164}}.</ref> Joseph walked to what he said was the site of the Golden Plates. Some time in the early morning hours, he said he retrieved the plates and hid them in a hollow log on or near Cumorah.<!--

--> At the same time, Joseph said he received a pair of large spectacles he called the "[[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]]" or "Interpreters", with lenses consisting of two [[Seer stones and the Latter Day Saint movement|seer stones]], which he showed [[Lucy Mack Smith|his mother]] when he returned in the morning.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=101}}. Smith's friend Joseph Knight said Smith was even more fascinated by the Interpreters than the plates {{Harv|Knight|1833|p=3}}.</ref>

Over the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby [[Macedon (town), New York|Macedon]] to obtain money to buy a solid lockable chest in which he said he would put the plates.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=101}}.</ref><!--

==Translating the plates==
{{main|Life of Joseph Smith, Jr. from 1827 to 1830}}

Most of the translation of the golden plates took place in [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Harmony, Pennsylvania]] (now located in [[Oakland Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Oakland Township]]), where Smith and Emma moved in October 1827 with the financial assistance from a prominent, though superstitious, Palmyra landowner [[Martin Harris]].<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>The local Presbyterian minister, Jesse Townsend, described Harris as a "visionary fanatic." A acquaintance, Lorenzo Saunders, said "There can't anybody say word against Martin Harris...a man that would do just as he agreed with you. But he was a great man for seeing spooks." Quoted in "Ronald W. Walker, "Martin Harris: Mormonism's Early Convert," ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', 19 (Winter 1986): 34-35.</ref><!--

--> Harmony was Emma's home town. The work of translation took place in two phases: the first was a period from December 1827 to June 1828 in which Smith [[Anthon transcript|transcribed some of the characters]] and then dictated a translation to [[Martin Harris]]. The [[Lost 116 pages|116 manuscript pages]] from this period, however, were lost. The second phase of translation began sporadically in early 1829, and then in earnest in April 1829 with the arrival of [[Oliver Cowdery]], a schoolteacher willing to work full-time as his scribe. In June 1829, Smith and Cowdery moved to [[Fayette, New York]] and finished the translation around the beginning of July 1829. 

===Location of the plates during translation===
When Joseph and Emma traveled to Pennsylvania in October 1827, the golden plates were said to be transported in a glass box hidden in a barrel of beans.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=113}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|1859|p=170}}.</ref><!--

--> In Harmony, the couple stayed for a time in the home of Emma's father [[Isaac Hale]], but when Smith refused to show Hale the plates, only allowing him to heft the containing box, Hale banished the concealed object from his house.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Hale|1834|p=264}}; {{Harvnb|Knight|1833|p=3}}.</ref><!--

--> Afterwards, the plates were said to be hidden for much of the time in the woods nearby,<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Hale|1834|p=264}}; {{Harvnb|Knight|1833|p=3}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=115}}.</ref><!--

--> although Emma said that for at least part of the time, Joseph kept the plates in the house, on a table, wrapped in a linen tablecloth, which she moved from time to time when it got in the way of her chores.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1879}}.</ref><!--

--> In one instance, the plates were said to be in a trunk on Emma's bureau.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=124}}.</ref><!--

--> Smith did not require the physical presence of the plates in order to translate.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Stevenson|1882}}; {{Harvnb|Hale|1834|pp=264<U+2013>65}}; {{Harvnb|Van Horn|1881}}.</ref>

In April 1828, Harris' wife [[Lucy Harris|Lucy]] visited Harmony with her husband and demanded to see the plates. When Smith refused, she searched the Smith house and grounds for the plates, but they had been hidden in the nearby woods, and were protected by a large black snake that frightened her and reportedly prevented her from digging them up.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|pp=115<U+2013>116}}.</ref><!--

--> Lucy was soon allegedly involved in the loss of the [[lost 116 pages|loss of 116 pages]] of translation manuscript in July 1828, which had been loaned to Martin so that he could prove to his friends and family that the plates were real.

Because of the lost 116 pages, Smith said that between July and September 1828, the [[angel Moroni]] took back possession of the plates and the [[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]] as a penalty for "delivering the manuscript into the hands of a wicked man."<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=125}} (stating that the angel took back the Urim and Thummim, but referring to the revelation that stated the plates were taken too); {{Harvnb|Smith|1832|p=5}} (referring only to the plates); {{Harvnb|Phelps|1833|loc=9:1, p. 22}} (a revelation referring only to the plates and to Smith's "gift" to translate).</ref><!--

--> The angel is said to have returned them to Smith in Harmony again on [[September 22]], [[1828]], the [[autumn equinox]] and the anniversary of the day he first received the plates.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=126}}.</ref>

In March 1829, Martin Harris visited Harmony and asked to see the plates firsthand. Smith did not show him the plates directly, but told him that he "would go into the woods where the Book of Plates was, and that after he came back, Harris should follow his tracks in the snow, and find the Book, and examine it for himself"; after following these directions, however, Harris could not find the plates.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Hale|1834|pp=264<U+2013>265}}.</ref>

In early June 1829, the unwanted attentions of Harmony locals necessitated a move to [[Fayette, New York]], to the home of [[David Whitmer]] and his parents. As they traveled, the golden plates were reportedly transported by the [[angel Moroni]], who received the plates in Harmony and then placed them in the garden of the Whitmer house in Fayette, where Smith found them.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=137}}; {{Harvnb|Salisbury|1895|p=16}}.</ref>

After translation was completed, Smith said he returned the plates to the angel,<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Harvnb|Van Horn|1881}};{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=141.}}.</ref><!--

--> although the angel periodically brought them, as needed, to show [[Book of Mormon witnesses|several witnesses]]. Many [[Latter Day Saints]], including [[Brigham Young]], have believed the plates were returned to [[Hill Cumorah]] and that other ancient records lie buried there, including the [[Sword of Laban]] and the special spectacles given to aid the translation process.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>[http://journalofdiscourses.org/Vol_19/JD19-036.html ''Journal of Discourses'' 19: 38], July 17, 1877. According to Oliver Cowdery's account, when the angel instructed Smith to return the plates to the hill [[Cumorah]], [[Oliver Cowdery]] accompanied him.  The hill opened and they walked into a cave where there was a spacious room with wagon loads of metallic plates and the [[Sword of Laban]], unsheathed on a large table. Joseph and Oliver placed the plates on this table.</ref>

===Translation process===

Smith said he copied characters from the golden plates and translated them through the use of "[[Urim and Thummim]]" found with the plates.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>''Joseph Smith-History'' 1:62. Early followers of Smith seem to have called both the Urim and Thummim and the seer stone "interpreters." Smith's father-in-law, Isaac Hale, said that the "manner in which he pretended to read and interpret was the same as when he looked for the money-diggers, with the stone in his hat, and his hat over his face, while the Book of Plates were at the same time hid in the woods!" "Mormonism," ''Susquehanna Register, and Northern Pennsylvanian'' 9 (1 May 1834), 1 in ''EMD'', 4: 287.''Joseph Smith-History'' 1:62.</ref><!--

--> Emma Smith later recalled that when she took dictation from her husband, she "frequently wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him, he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us.... The plates often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth, which I had given him to fold them in. I once felt of the plates as they thus lay on the table tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book."<ref>D&C 25:4; Joseph Smith III, Notes of Interview with Emma Smith Bidamon, February 1879, Miscellany, RLDS Church Library-Archives, Independence, Missouri, in ''EMD'', 1: 536-40. </ref> 

Usually, however, the golden plates were not even in the same room. Michael Morse, Smith's brother-in-law, said that he watched Smith on several occasions:"The mode of procedure consisted in Joseph's placing the Seer Stone in the crown of a hat, then putting his face into the hat, so as to entirely cover his face." [[David Whitmer]] said that "the plates were not before Joseph while he translated, but seem to have been removed by the custodian angel."  [[Isaac Hale]] said that while Joseph was translating, the plates were "hid in the woods."  [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] said they were "hid in the mountains."<ref>Grant H. Palmer, ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 2-5. In  March 1829, [[Martin Harris]] returned to Harmony and asked to see the plates. Smith reportedly told Harris that Smith "would go into the woods where the Book of Plates was, and that after he came back, Harris should follow his tracks in the snow, and find the Book, and examine it for himself"; after following these directions, however, Harris could not find the plates {{Harv|Hale|1834|pp=264<U+2013>65}}.</ref> During the translation process a curtain or blanket was placed between Smith and his scribe or between the living area and the area where Smith and his scribe worked.<ref>Lyndon W. Cook, ''David Whitmer Interviews: A Restoration Witness'' (Orem, UT: Grandin, 1991), 173.</ref> Sometimes Smith dictated to [[Martin Harris]] from upstairs or from a different room.<ref>{{Harv|Howe|1834|p=14}}</ref>

Smith used a number of assistants during the process of translating the ''Book of Mormon'', including [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma Smith]], [[Martin Harris]], and most notably, [[Oliver Cowdery]]. Nevertheless, Smith's translation process did not involve his understanding of an ancient script. As he looked into the seer stone, the words of the text appeared to him in English.<ref>"Although in the same room, a thick curtain or blanket was suspended between them, and Smith concealed behind the blanket, pretended to look through his spectacles, or transparent stones, and would then write down or repeat what he saw, which when repeated aloud, was written down by Harris." Martin Harris Interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 & 1828, in ''EMD'' 2: 268. "Oliver Cowdery, one of the three witnesses to the book, testified under oath, that said Smith....translated his book [with] two transparent stones, resembling glass, set in silver bows.  That by looking through these, he was able to read in English, the reformed Egyptian characters, which were engraved on the plates." Abram W. Benton Reminiscence, March 1831, in ''EMD'' 4: 97.</ref> When in mid-1828, Smith loaned the manuscript pages to Martin Harris, and Harris lost them, Smith said that opponents would try to see if he could "bring forth the same words again." Smith did not explain why he believed different translations of a text should not be different or why a fraudulent version with different handwriting would not be obvious.<ref>D&C 10: 17-18, 31. Smith seems to have assumed that a second transcription of the [[lost 116 pages]] should be identical to the first rather than be filled with the natural variants that would occur if one was translating, and not merely transcribing, a text from one language into another. Palmer, 7.</ref>

===Plates returned to Moroni===

Once the translation was complete, about July 1829, Smith said that he returned the plates to the angel.<ref>{{Harv|Van Horn|1881}};{{Harv|Smith|1853|p=141.}}</ref> Many [[Latter Day Saints]], including [[Brigham Young]], have believed the plates were returned to [[Hill Cumorah]] and that other ancient records lie buried there, including the [[Sword of Laban]] and the Urim and Thummim given to aid the translation process.<ref>[http://journalofdiscourses.org/Vol_19/JD19-036.html ''Journal of Discourses'' 19: 38], July 17, 1877.

The hill opened and they walked into a cave where there was a spacious room with wagon loads of metallic plates and the [[Sword of Laban]], unsheathed on a large table. Joseph and Oliver placed the plates on this table.</ref>

==Witnesses to the plates==
{{main|Book of Mormon witnesses}}

As Smith finished the translation of the plates, he revealed that witnesses would be asked to testify to their existence. In June 1829, two sets of witnesses, the [[Three Witnesses]]<ref>The [[Three Witnesses]] were selected soon after a visit by [[Martin Harris]] to the Whitmer home in Fayette, accompanied by Smith's parents {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=138}}, to inquire about the translation {{Harv|Roberts|1902|p=51}}. According to Smith's mother, this trip was prompted by news that Smith had completed the translation of the plates{{Harv|Smith|1853|p=138}}. When Harris he arrived, he joined with [[Oliver Cowdery]] and [[David Whitmer]] to request that the three be named as the [[Three Witnesses]] referred to in the much earlier revelation directed to Harris, and also referred to in a recently-translated portion of the plates called the [[Book of Ether]] (2:2<U+2013>4) {{Harv|Roberts|1902|p=51}}. In response, Smith dictated a revelation that the three of them would see the Golden Plates {{Harv|Roberts|1902|pp=51<U+2013>53}}. Thus, Smith took the three of them to the woods near the Whitmer home and they had a shared vision in which they all claimed to see (with their "spiritual eyes", Harris reportedly said {{Harv|Gilbert|1892}}) an angel holding the Golden Plates and turning its leaves ({{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|pp=54<U+2013>55}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1830b|loc=appendix}}). The four of them also said they heard "the voice of the Lord" telling them that the translation of the plates was correct, and commanding them to testify of what they saw and heard ({{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|pp=54<U+2013>55}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1830b|loc=appendix}}).[[David Whitmer]] later stated that the angel showed them "the breast plates, the [[Liahona|Ball or Directors]], the [[Sword of Laban]] and other plates" ({{Harvnb|Van Horn|1881}}; {{Harvnb|Kelley|Blakeslee|1882}}; see also {{Harvnb|Smith|1835|p=171}}).</ref> and a separate group of [[Eight Witnesses]],<ref>The [[Eight Witnesses]] were selected a few days later when Smith traveled to [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] with the males of the Whitmer home, including [[David Whitmer]]'s father Peter, his brothers Christian, Jacob, and John, and his brother-in-law [[Hiram Page]]. Smith took this group, along with his father [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] and his brothers [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] and [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel]] to a location near Smith's parent's home in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] {{Harv|Smith|1853}}. Because of a foreclosure on their [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] property, the Smith family was then living in a log cabin technically in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] ({{Harvnb|Smith|1883|p=14}}; {{Harvnb|Berge|1985}}) where Smith said he showed them the Golden Plates {{Harv|Roberts|1902|p=57}}. Like the [[Three Witnesses]], the [[Eight Witnesses]] later signed an affidavit for inclusion at the end of the ''Book of Mormon'' {{Harv|Smith|1830b|appendix}}. Though the Eight Witnesses did not refer, like the Three, to an angel or the voice of God, they said that they had hefted the plates and seen the engravings on them {{Harv|Smith|1830b|appendix}}.</ref> signed joint statements, written by Smith, which were subsequently published with the text of the [[Book of Mormon]].<ref>Bushman, 76-79. A comparison of "The Testimony of Three Witnesses" to ''Doctrine and Covenants'' 17, written in 1829, shows "the marks of common authorship." Grant Palmer, ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 195-96.See Oliver Cowdery to Hyrum Smith dated [[June 14]] [[1829]], quoting the language of this revelation. Joseph Smith letterbook (22 Nov. 1835 to 4 Aug. 1835), 5-6. Commentators generally agree that this letter refers to the revelation. See Larry C. Porter, "Dating the Restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood," ''Ensign'' (June 1979), 5. A revelation by Smith commanded Cowdery and Whitmer to seek out twelve "disciples", who desired to serve, and who would "go into all the world to preach my gospel unto every creature", and who would be ordained to baptize and to ordain priests and teachers {{Harv|Phelps|1833|p=37}}. Soon thereafter in the second half of  June 1829 {{Harv|Van Horn|1881}}, a group of [[Three Witnesses]] and a separate group of [[Eight Witnesses]] were selected, in addition to Smith himself, to testify that Smith had the Golden Plates.</ref> The Three Witnesses &mdash; [[Oliver Cowdery]], [[David Whitmer]], and [[Martin Harris]] &mdash; affirmed that an angel had descended from heaven and presented the plates, which they saw but did not touch. Then they heard a voice from heaven declaring that the book was translated by the power of God and that they should bear record of it. The Eight Witnesses were members of the Joseph Smith and David Whitmer families. Like the Three Witnesses, the Eight signed a joint statement that they had seen and, in their case, hefted the plates.<ref>"The translator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship."</ref>

In March 1838, disillusioned church members said that [[Martin Harris]], who had given many specific descriptions of the plates, had now publicly denied having seen them at all.<ref>Their accounts state that Harris publicly denied that either he or the other Witnesses to the ''Book of Mormon'' had ever seen or handled the golden plates<U+2014>although he had not been present when Whitmer and Cowdery first claimed to have viewed them. Harris's recantation, made during a period of crisis in early Mormonism, induced five influential members, including three Apostles, to leave the Church. (Stephen Burnett to Luke S. Johnson, 15 April 1838, in Joseph Smith's Letterbook, ''Early Mormon Documents'' 2: 290-92. Warren Parrish also wrote in August 11, 1838: "Martin Harris, one of the subscribing witnesses, has come out at last, and says he never saw the plates, from which the book purports to have been translated, except in vision, and he further says that any man who says he has seen them in any other way is a liar, Joseph not excepted." ''EMD'', 2: 289.)</ref> Near the end of his long life, Harris also said that he had seen the plates only in "a state of entrancement."<ref>Metcalf in ''EMD'', 2: 347.</ref> Nevertheless, in 1871 Harris testified that no one had "ever heard me in any way deny the truth of the Book of Mormon [or] the administration of the angel that showed me the plates."<ref>"No man heard me in any way deny the truth of the Book of Mormon, the administration of the angel that showed me the plates; nor the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints under the administration of Joseph Smith, Jr." Letter of Martin Harris, Sr., to Hanna B. Emerson, January 1871, Smithfield, Utah Territory, ''Saints' Herald'' 22 (15 October 1875):630, in ''EMD'' 2: 338. See also Richard Lloyd Anderson, ''Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1981), 118</ref> Yet even after Smith had returned the plates to the angel, other early LDS Church members testified that an angel had also showed them the plates.<ref>For instances of people testifying to having seen the Golden Plates ''after'' Smith returned them to the angel, see the affirmations of John Young and Harrison Burgess in Grant Palmer, ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 201. In 1859, Brigham Young referred to one of these "post-return" testimonies: "Some of the witnesses of the Book of Mormon, who handled the plates and conversed with the angels of God, were afterwards left to doubt....One of the Quorum of the Tweleve, a young man full of faith and good works, prayed, and the vision of his mind was opened, and the angel of God came and laid the plates before him, and he saw and handled them, and saw the angel." ''Journal of Discourses'', June 5, 1859, 7: 164.</ref>

==Physical description of the plates==
===Format, binding, and dimensions===
[[Image:GoldenPlates.JPG|300px|right|thumb|Full-scale model of the Golden Plates based on Joseph Smith's description.]]

The plates were said to be in the format of a book, bound at one edge by a set of rings. [[Martin Harris]], one of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]'s early scribes, is reported to have said in 1828 that he understood the plates were "fastened together in the shape of a book by wires"<ref>{{Harvnb|Anthon|1834|p=270}}.</ref> After saying that he saw the plates in 1829, Harris said in 1859 that the plates "were seven inches wide by eight inches in length, and were of the thickness of plates of tin; and when piled one above the other, they were altogether about four inches thick; and they were put together on the back by three silver rings, so that they would open like a book."<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1859|p=165}}.</ref> [[David Whitmer]], another [[Three Witnesses|1829 witness]], was quoted in a 1831 Palmyra newspaper as saying the plates were "the thickness of tin plate; the back was secured with three small rings...passing through each leaf in succession."<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|1831}}.</ref> Anomalously, [[Joseph Smith, Sr.|Smith's father]] is quoted as saying the plates were only half an inch thick <ref>{{Harvnb|Lapham|1870|p=307}}.</ref> [[Lucy Mack Smith|Smith's mother]], who said she had "seen and handled" the plates, is quoted as saying they were "eight inches long, and six wide,... all connected by a ring which passes through a hole at the end of each plate."<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1842b|p=27}}.</ref>

[[Hyrum Smith]] and [[John Whitmer]], also [[Eight Witnesses|witnesses in 1829]], are reported to have stated that the rings holding the plates together were, in Hyrum's words, "in the shape of the letter D, which facilitated the opening and shutting of the book".<ref>Statement by Hyrum Smith as reported by William E. McLellin in the ''Huron Reflector'', Oct. 31, 1831. See also {{Harvnb|Poulson|1878|}}.</ref> Joseph Smith's wife [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma]], and his younger brother [[William Smith (Mormonism)|William]] said they examined the plates while they were wrapped in fabric. Emma said she "felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book".<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1879}}.</ref> William agreed that the plates could be rustled with one's thumb like the pages of a book.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1884}}.</ref>

Joseph Smith did not provide his own published description of the plates until 1842, when he said in a letter that "each plate was six inches [150 mm] wide and eight inches [200 mm] long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They were...bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the whole.  The volume was something near six inches [150 mm] in thickness."<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1842}}.</ref>

===Composition and weight===
The plates were first described as "gold." Beginning about 1827, the plates were widely called the "gold bible".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1859|p=167}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1853|pp=102, 109, 113, 145}}; {{Harvnb|Grandin|1829}}.</ref> When the book was published in 1830, [[Eight Witnesses|eight witnesses]] described the plates as having "the appearance of gold."<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1830|loc=appx.}}</ref> The ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' itself describes the plates as being made of "ore."<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1830|loc=Mormon 8:5}}.</ref> In 1831, a Palmyra newspaper quoted [[David Whitmer]], another [[Three Witnesses|witness to the plates]], as saying the plates were a "''whitish yellow'' color," with "three small rings of the same metal."<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|1831}}.</ref>

[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]'s first published description of the plates agreed that the plates "had the appearance of gold."<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1842}}.</ref> but gave no further information about their composition. Late in life, [[Martin Harris]] stated that the rings holding the plates together were made of silver,<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1859|p=165}}.</ref> and he said the plates themselves, based on their heft of "forty or fifty pounds,"<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1859|p=166}}</ref> "were lead or gold."<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1859|p=169}}.</ref> Joseph's brother [[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William Smith]], who said he felt the plates inside a pillow case in 1827, said in 1884 that he understood the plates to be "a mixture of gold and copper...much heavier than stone, and very much heavier than wood."<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1884}}</ref>

Different people estimated the weight of the plates differently. According to Smith's one-time-friend Willard Chase, Smith told him in 1827 that the plates weighed between forty and sixty pounds, most likely the latter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chase|1833|p=246}}.</ref> Smith's father [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], who was one of the [[Eight Witnesses]], reportedly weighed them and said in 1830 that they "weighed thirty pounds."<ref>{{Harvnb|Lapham|1870}}.</ref> Joseph Smith's brother, William, said that he lifted them in a pillowcase and thought they "weighed about sixty pounds according to the best of my judgment."<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1883}}.</ref> Others who lifted the plates while they were wrapped in cloth or enclosed in a box thought that they weighed about sixty pounds. Martin Harris said that he had "hefted the plates many times, and should think they weighed forty or fifty pounds." <ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1859|pp=166, 169}}.</ref> Joseph Smith's wife [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma]] never estimated the weight of the plates but said they were light enough for her to "move them from place to place on the table, as it was necessary in doing my work".<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1879}}.</ref> Had the plates been made of 24-karat gold (which Smith never claimed), they would have weighed about 140 pounds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vogel|2004|loc=p. 600, n. 65}}.</ref>

The plates might have been made from tin or various gold alloys. They might have been made of a gold and copper Mesoamerican alloy, called [[tumbaga]] by the Spanish, which would have weighed between 50 and 70 pounds.<ref>Tumbaga was the name given by the Spanish to an Mesoamerican alloy of Gold and Copper.{{Harvnb|Putnam|1966}}.</ref> Plates of roughly similar dimensions and weight might also have been made of tin, which was readily available in the Palmyra area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vogel|2004|loc=p. 600, n. 65}}; {{Harvnb|Vogel|2004|p=98}}.</ref>

==="Sealed" portion===

According to Joseph Smith and others, the book of Golden Plates contained a "sealed" portion
<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1842|p=707}}.</ref> containing "a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof."<ref>''Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 27:7. The "sealing" of apocalyptic revelations in a book has precedents in the ''[[Bible]]''. See, for example, Isaiah 29:11, Daniel 12:4, and Revelation 5:1<U+2013>5.</ref> Although Smith never personally described the nature or extent of the seal, witnesses have offered several descriptions. The language of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' is interpreted by many to describe a sealing of the plates that was spiritual, metaphorical,<ref>i.e. that the book was "sealed" in the sense that its contents were hidden or kept from public knowledge</ref> physical, or any combination of these elements. 

The ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' refers to other documents and plates being "sealed" by being buried to come forth at some future time. For example, the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' says the entire set of plates was "sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord",<ref>{{Harv|Smith|1830|loc=title page}}</ref> and that a separate record of [[John the Apostle]] was "sealed up to come forth in their purity" in the [[end times]].<ref>''Book of Mormon'', 1 Nephi 14:26</ref> One set of plates referred to in the ''Book of Mormon'' was "sealed up" in the sense that "no one can interpret them," because they were written "in a language that they cannot be read."<ref>''Book of Mormon'', Ether 3: 22.</ref>

Smith may also have understood the sealing as a [[supernatural]] or spiritual sealing of the plates "by the power of God" (2 Nephi 27:10).<ref>{{Harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=195<U+2013>196}}.</ref> This idea is supported by a reference in the ''Book of Mormon'' to the "interpreters" ([[Seer stones and the Latter Day Saint movement|Urim and Thummim]]) with which Smith said they were buried or "sealed."<ref>Book of Mormon, Ether 4:5<!--This didn't seem relevant to this sentence/note: "According to [[Martin Harris]], anyone who looked into the "interpreters" "except by the command of God" would "perish" {{Harv|Harris|1859|p=166}}."</ref> Oliver Cowdery also stated that when Smith visited the hill, he was stricken by a supernatural force because the plates were "sealed by the prayer of faith".<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowdery|1835b|p=198}}.</ref>

A physical "sealing" placed on part of the plates by Mormon or Moroni has been described by several witnesses. [[David Whitmer]] said that an angel showed him the plates in 1829, and that "a large portion of the leaves were so securely bound together that it was impossible to separate them."<ref>David Whitmer interview, Chicago Tribune, 24 January 1888, in David Whitmer Interviews, ed. Cook, 221.  Near the end of his life, Whitmer said that one section of the book was "loose, in plates, the other solid."{{Harvnb|Storey|1881}}</ref> He also said that the "sealed" part of the plates were held together as a solid mass that was "stationary and immovable,"<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|1831}}</ref> it "appeared as solid to my view as wood",<ref>{{Harvnb|Poulson|1878}}.</ref> and it had "perceptible marks where the plates appeared to be sealed".<ref>{{Harvnb|Storey|1881}}</ref>. Whitmer also stated that the leaves "were so securely bound that it was impossible to separate them".<ref>{{Harvnb|Whitmer|1888}}. [[Orson Pratt]], who said he had spoken with many witnesses of the plates,{{Harv|Pratt|1859|p=30}}, assumed that Joseph Smith could "break the seal" if only he had been "permitted" {{Harv|Pratt|1877|pp=211<U+2013>12}}.</ref> [[Lucy Mack Smith]] said in 1842 that "some of [the plates] are sealed together and are not to be opened, and some of them are loose".<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1842b|p=27}}.</ref> The testimony of the [[Eight Witnesses]] states that they saw the plates in 1829 and handled "as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated," implying that they did not examine un-translated parts of the book such as the sealed portion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1830|loc=appx.}}</ref>

David Whitmer said that "about half" the book was sealed in one interview,<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|1831}}; {{Harvnb|Poulson|1878}}.</ref> and in 1881 said that "about one-third" of the book was un-sealed, and the remainder sealed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Storey|1881}}</ref> Whitmer's 1881 statement is consistent with a 1856 statement by [[Orson Pratt]], an associate of Smith's who never saw the plates himself, but who said he had spoken with the witnesses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pratt|1859|p=30}}.</ref> According to Pratt, "about two-thirds" of the plates were "sealed up".<ref>{{Harvnb|Pratt|1856|p=347}}.</ref>

The sealed portion of the plates is said to contain "a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof."<ref>''Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 27:7.</ref> The ''Book of Mormon'' states that this vision was originally given to the [[Brother of Jared]], recorded by Ether on a set of 24 plates later found by [[Limhi]] and then "sealed up."<ref>''Book of Mormon, Ether 1:2.</ref> According to this account, [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]] copied the plates of Limhi onto the sealed portion of the Golden Plates.<ref>''Book of Mormon'', Ether 4:4. In the 1980s, Christopher Marc Nemelka claimed to have received the gold plates from Joseph Smith and translated some of the sealed portion. ''Salt Lake City Weekly'', December 27, 2001 [http://rickross.com/reference/mormon/mormon241.html].</ref>
<!--This is a tough sentence to cite... any ideas?: "Many [[Latter Day Saint]]s expect that this prophecy will be eventually revealed."-->

===Engravings===
{{main|Reformed Egyptian}}
[[Image:Caractors large.jpg|300px|right|thumb|A transcription by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] of characters he said were engraved on the Golden Plates.]]

The Golden Plates were said to contain engravings in an ancient language that the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' describes as [[Reformed Egyptian]].<ref>{{Harv|Smith|1830|loc=Mormon 9:32}}.</ref> Smith later described them as "Egyptian characters...small, and beautifully engraved," exhibiting "much skill in the art of engraving."<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1842}}.</ref>

According to [[John Whitmer]], one of the [[Eight Witnesses]] who said he saw the plates in 1829, the plates had "fine engravings on both sides".<ref>{{Harv|Roberts|1906|p=307}}.</ref> [[Orson Pratt]], who did not see the plates himself, who had spoken with the witnesses, understood that there were engravings on both sides of the plates, "stained with a black, hard stain, so as to make the letters more legible and easier to be read."<ref>{{Harvnb|Pratt|1859|p=30-31}}.</ref>

==Metal plates in Latter Day Saint theology and history==
===Other metal plates mentioned in the Book of Mormon===
In addition to the Golden Plates, the Book of Mormon refers to several other sets of books written on metal plates: 
*The [[brass plates]] originally in the custody of [[Laban (Book of Mormon)|Laban]], containing the writings of Old Testament prophets before the [[Babylonian Exile]], as well as the otherwise unknown prophets [[Zenos]] and [[Zenoch]], and possibly others.
*The [[plates of Nephi|large plates of Nephi]], the source of the text abridged by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] and engraved on the Golden Plates.
*The [[Plates of Nephi|small plates of Nephi]], the source of the [[First Book of Nephi|first]] and [[Second Book of Nephi|second]] books of Nephi, and the books of [[Book of Jacob|Jacob]], [[Book of Enos|Enos]], [[Book of Jarom|Jarom]] and [[Book of Omni|Omni]], which replaced the [[lost 116 pages]].
* A set of twenty-four plates found by the people of [[Limhi]] containing the record of the [[Jaredite]]s, translated by [[Mosiah|King Mosiah]], and abridged by Moroni as the [[Book of Ether]].

===Other metal plates in the Latter Day Saint Tradition===
*In 1843, Smith acquired a set of six small bell-shaped plates, known as the [[Kinderhook Plates]], found in Kinderhook, Pike County, Illinois.  Smith said that they contained information about a descendant of Ham "through the loins of Pharaoh," but he never produced a translation.  After Smith's assassination, the Kinderhook Plates were presumed lost, but for decades [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] published facsimiles of them in its official ''History of the Church'' as evidence that ancient Americans wrote on metal plates.  In 1980 the Kinderhook Plates were proved to have been manufactured in the nineteenth century, probably in an attempt to catch Smith in a fraud.  Today the LDS Church acknowledges the plates as a hoax and makes no attempt to defend their authenticity.<ref>Richard Bushman, ''Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 489-90.</ref> 

*[[James J. Strang]], one of the rival claimants to succeed Smith, also claimed to have discovered and translated a set of plates known as the [[Voree Plates]]. Strang likewise produced witnesses to their authenticity. Although Strang's movement was short-lived, Joseph Smith's mother, [[Lucy Mack Smith]], and all living witnesses to the [[Book of Mormon]], including the three Whitmers and [[Martin Harris]] (although perhaps excluding [[Oliver Cowdery]]), accepted "Strang's leadership, angelic call, metal plates, and his translation of these plates as authentic."<ref>Palmer, 208-13. Cowdery's father converted to Strang's movement in the summer of 1846, and a year later Oliver Cowdery was living in [[Elkhorn, Wisconsin|Elkhorn]], Wisconsin, twelve miles from Strang's headquarters and may have been associated in some way with his church.  Stanley R. Gunn, ''Oliver Cowdery: Second Elder and Scribe'' (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1962), 189. Lucy Mack Smith's acceptance of Strang's leadership was short-lived; until her death, she made her home in Nauvoo with her daughter-in-law Emma and Emma's non-Mormon husband.</ref> 

===Metal plates outside the Latter Day Saint tradition===
[[Image:Lamine Pyrgi.jpg|thumb|300px|the [[Pyrgi Tablets]] ]]

Mormons often treat inscribed metal plates outside the Latter Day Saint tradition as evidence that the Golden Plates were actual historical artifacts. Some ancient European and Mesopotamian cultures did keep short records on metal plates, but those found to date have been extremely thin to facilitate being engraved with a pointed tool. In 500 BCE, [[Darius the Great]] of Persia inscribed a history on a gold plate and sealed it in a stone box in the temple at Persepolis.<ref>[http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/MUS/PA/IRAN/PAAI/IMAGES/PER/MF/5A2_4.html],
[http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/MUS/PA/IRAN/PAAI/IMAGES/PER/MF/5A3_4.html]</ref> A six-page, 24-[[Carat (purity)|carat]] gold book, written in Etruscan, was found in Bulgaria;<ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2939362.stm BBC news report] "The six sheets are believed to be the oldest comprehensive work involving multiple pages," said Elka Penkova, who heads the museum's archaeological department. "There are around 30 similar pages known in the world," Ms Penkova said, "but they are not linked together in a book."</ref>and in 2005, an eight-page golden codex, said to be from the [[Achaemenid]] period, was recovered from smugglers by the Iranian police. The [[Pyrgi Tablets]] (now at the [[National Etruscan Museum]], Rome) are gold plates with a bilingual Phoenician-Etruscan text.  Gold [[Lamina|Laminae]] [[funerary text]]s similar to [[Book of the Dead|Books of the Dead]] have also been found in Italy. In the caves where the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] had been found, archeologists later discovered the aptly-named [[Copper Scroll]], two rolled sheets of copper that may describe locations where treasures of the [[Second Temple]] of Jerusalem may have been hidden.<ref>A summary of information about the Copper Scroll from the [http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/dead_sea_scrolls/copperscroll.shtml  West Semitic Research Project, University of Southern California.]</ref> Nevertheless, there is no known extant example of writing on metal plates longer than the eight-page Persian codex.
