"'''Eyes of the Insane'''" is a 2006 single by [[Music of the United States|American]] [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]], taken from their 2006 album ''[[Christ Illusion]]''. The lyrics explore an American soldier's mental anguish following his return home from [[2003 invasion of Iraq|the second Gulf War]], and is based on an article entitled "Casualty of War" which was featured in ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' magazine. Penned by vocalist [[Tom Araya]] during pre-production for the album, the song was generally well received by critics.

The accompaning [[music video]] was shot by the Iranian director Tony Petrossian in the Los Angeles area during August 2006. The film is presented as a close up of the soldier's [[pupil]] and [[iris]], which reflect disconcerting images of war-themed horrors, flashbacks of his home, wife and children, and ultimately images of his death. "Eyes of the Insane" was featured on the [[Saw III soundtrack|soundtrack]] to ''[[Saw III]]'', and won an award for Best Metal Performance at the [[49th Grammy Awards]].
 
==Origins==
[[Image:March_2006_Texas_Monthly.jpg|thumb|left|March 2006 issue of [[Texas Monthly]] magazine, whose article entitled "Casualty of War" directly inspired "Eyes of the Insane".]] 

While walking through an airport, vocalist Tom Araya came across a March 2006 issue of ''Texas Monthly'' magazine which featured a soldier's helmet on the front cover. Picking up the magazine and sifting through it, he stumbled on the article "Casualty of War", and was interested enough to purchase a copy.<ref name="Claes">{{cite web|title = "Slayer"|author =Claes, Sean|publisher = Blistering.com|date=2006|url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/12020/tempidx/5/menuid/3|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> The issue explored the Texas military's involvement in the [[Iraq War]], and contained an article which ran an entire list of Texan soldiers who had died in the combat.<ref name="Atkinson2">{{cite web|title=Songs About God and Satan - Part 2: An Interview With Slayer's Tom Araya|author=  Atkinson, Peter|publisher=KNAC.com|[[date=2006-05-03]]|url=http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=4576|accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref><ref name="Harris">{{cite web|title = "New Slayer album might be their fastest yet"|author =Harris, Chris|publisher = MTV.com|date=[[2006-04-20]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1529092/20060419/slayer.jhtml?headlines=true|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> The feature was accompanied by photographs of some of the deceased, while a further article dealt with these soldiers anguish on their return home.<ref name="Atkinson2"/> Araya later admitted that the article "blew his mind".<ref name="Harris"/>

Araya read the article during his plane journey back to Los Angeles. Pre-production for Slayer's ninth studio album ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' had just begun, and the band was about to undertake a three-day rehearsal with producer [[Josh Abraham]]. Araya left his baggage at the hotel to attend the rehearsals, and when he returned re-read the article. Finding the article to be "very profound", Araya woke up in the middle of the night and wrote down the song's lyrics.<ref name="Claes"/> He said that his treatment of the topic is "sincere", and that he believes it to be "one that the military doesn't want you to know. They sweep it under the rug, but it's a story that needs to be told."<ref name="Claes"/> Guitarist [[Kerry King]] has stated that "these new songs [from the ''Christ Illusion'' album] aren't political at all: '[[Jihad (song)|Jihad]]', 'Eyes of the Insane' <U+2014> it's what's spewing out at us from the TV."<ref>{{cite web|title=After 25 years, Slayer keeps casting metal|author=Beck, Aaron|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|date=[[2007-02-10]]|url=http://www.columbusdispatch.com/features-story.php?story=dispatch/2007/02/10/20070210-B1-02.html|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>

Some reviewers paid particular attention to Araya's vocal contribution. Zach Hothorn of [[Prefix Magazine]] said the song "allows Araya to show his vocal range, deepening to build up tension and creating a wonderfully chilling 3 and a half minutes,"<ref name="Prefix">{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Hothorn, Zach|publisher=[[Prefix Magazine]]|date=[[2006-08-16]]|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/cds/S/Slayer/Christ-Illusion/2445|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> while Ian Robinson of [[musicOMH.com]] felt the track "is a distinct but welcome change of pace, Dave Lombardo's machine-gun rhythms forming the backbone for Tom Araya's impressively intact scream."<ref name="MusicOMH">{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Robinson, Ian|publisher=[[MusicOMH.com]]|date=[[2006-08-21]]|url= http://www.musicomh.com/albums/slayer_0806.htm|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref>

Casting company Tolley Casparis Casting sought a male Caucasian between the ages of 18 and 26 to feature in the clip, with auditions held on [[August 10]] [[2006]]. Official project notes deemed that "This guy must be a serious actor, capable of emoting everything through his eyes. He was innocent a few months ago, now he is scarred by seeing so much fighting. Strong eyebrows that do not overpower the face.

The video was shot as "first-person narrative about the horrors leading up to the final moments of a soldier at war", and was described as "a single, long and tight [[close-up]] of the soldier's eye with images clearly reflected within his pupil and iris and perfectly choreographed with the rhythm of the music.

==Critical reception==
Critics were generally positive when reviewing "Eyes of the Insane". ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'''s Cosmo Lee described the track as "a dark, midpaced exploration of a soldier's psyche", and remarked that "it's memorable and would be a good breather between the usual barnburners."<ref>{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Lee, Cosmo|publisher=[[Stylus Magazine]]|date=|url= http://stylusmagazine.com/reviews/slayer/christ-illusion.htm|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> Peter Atkinson of ''KNAC.com'' felt that "'Eyes of the Insane' offers a post-traumatic sequel to 'Mandatory Suicide', again with a soundtrack that recalls the original, but boasting a couple truly mammoth hooks that do shake things up."<ref name="KNACReview">{{cite web|title =KNAC Review - Christ Illusion|author = Atkinson, Peter|publisher=KNAC.com|date=[[2006-07-24]]|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=4789|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> Don Kaye of ''[[Blabbermouth]]'' made a  comparison to a different Slayer track than Atkinson, and commented that "'Eyes of the Insane' and 'Catatonic' both have that slow, grinding feeling of doom that the band has done so well before on classics like '[[Dead Skin Mask]]'."<ref name="BlabbermouthReview">{{cite web|title = Blabbermouth Review - ''Christ Illusion''|author=Kaye, Don|publisher = Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=817|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy."<ref name="GrammyWin"/> King disagreed, deeming the song "one of the poorest representations of us [Slayer] on the record [''Christ Illusion'']". He further stated that if given the decision, he would have personally chosen the controversial track "[[Jihad (song)|Jihad]]" to represent Slayer from their ninth album ''Christ Illusion''. Critical of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|Recording Academy]], King said, "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are."<ref name="Piccoli">{{cite news | last = Piccoli| first = Sean| title =Grammy for Slayer's 11th album shows metal legends are now a household name| work =| pages =| publisher = Sun-Sentinel.com  | date = 2007-02-21  | url =|accessdate=}}</ref>

The [[Saw III soundtrack|soundtrack]] to the 2006 horror film ''[[Saw III]]'' featured "Eyes of the Insane", and was released on [[October 24]] [[2006]] via [[Warcon Enterprises]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Slayer, Eighteen Visions, Lamb of God, Mastodon Featured On 'Saw III' Soundtrack|author= |publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=[[2006-09-14]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=58414|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>
The track was one of six songs performed by Slayer during their first US network television appearance on [[ABC-TV]]'s ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'' (January 19, 2007), and was the only song broadcast in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web|title=Slayer on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!': 'Eyes Of The Insane' performance posted online|author=|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=[[2007-01-20]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=65652|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>
