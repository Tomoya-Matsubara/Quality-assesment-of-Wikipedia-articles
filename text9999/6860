'''''Acela Express''''' (often simply '''''Acela''''') is [[Amtrak]]'s [[high-speed rail]] service along the [[Northeast Corridor]] (NEC) in the [[Northeast U.S.|Northeast United States]] between [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] via [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City|New York]].  It uses [[tilting train|tilting]] technology which allows the train to travel at higher speeds on the sharply curved NEC without disturbing passengers, by lowering lateral [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal forces]],<ref name=tilt/> based on the concept of [[banked turn]]s.

''Acela Express'' trains are the only true high-speed [[Rail_terminology#T|trainsets]] in North America; the highest speed they attain is {{convert|150|mph|abbr=on}}, though they average less than half of that. ''Acela'' has become popular with business travelers and by some reckoning has captured over half of the market share of air or train travelers between Washington and New York.<ref>Goldberg, Bruce.

The ''Acela'' gets top billing as Amtrak's premier route, and carries over 3 million passengers annually.  However, the busiest Amtrak route is the somewhat slower ''[[Northeast Regional]]'', which had 6.9 million riders in 2009 due to its lower fares and greater number of stops than the ''Acela''. The Acela Express is one of the few Amtrak lines to operate at a profit; the two train lines generate more than half of Amtrak's total revenue.<ref name="FY2009"/>

==Origins and history==
===Development===
On March 9, 1999, Amtrak unveiled its plan for a true high-speed rail service, the ''Acela Express''.<ref name>{{cite web |publisher = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date = March 10, 1999 |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6680582.html |title = Amtrak unveils high-speed shuttle trains for busy travelers - Service between Boston, Washington is designed to compete with airlines |accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref> Twenty new trains were to be purchased and operated on the busy [[Northeast Corridor]].<ref name = 'overview'>{{cite web |publisher = Associated Press |date = March 9, 1999 |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-23407520.html |title = Amtrak To Unveil High-Speed Service |accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref>  Several engineering changes were made to the corridor to make it suitable for the trains' operation. Besides straightening curves, it was necessary to infill electrification along the entire 470-mile-long route as the Acela is an entirely electric train.<ref name = 'overview'/> Several grade crossings were also upgraded or removed in the interest of public safety.<ref>{{cite news |publisher = Railway Track and Structures |date = June 01, 1999 |url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31928865_ITM |title = At-grade crossings: Innovation, safety, sophisticated new technology |accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref>

The ''Acela'' service can be largely considered a success; by 2005 Amtrak's share of the transport market between New York and Boston had reached 40% from 18% pre-Acela.<ref>{{cite journal |publisher = Japan Railway & Transport Review |date = March 2005 |url = http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr40/pdf/f18_bla.pdf |title = The Acela Express |author = R.

At that time, there were three classes of trains on the Northeast Corridor (and its extension south to [[Newport News, Virginia]])<U+2014>the hourly Philadelphia-New York ''[[Clocker (Amtrak)|Clocker]]s'', the express ''[[Metroliner (Amtrak)|Metroliner]]s'', and the [[umbrella term]] ''[[NortheastDirect]]'', applied to all other local trains on the corridor (in addition to unique names assigned to each departure). ''[[Empire Service (Amtrak)|Empire Service]]'' trains used the [[Empire Corridor]] from New York City to [[Niagara Falls (NY)|Niagara Falls]], and ''[[Keystone Service]]'' ran along the [[Keystone Corridor]] from Philadelphia to [[Harrisburg (PA)|Harrisburg]]. Other named trains also used the corridors, branching off or continuing beyond their stations.

The original plan included renaming the ''Empire'', ''Keystone'', and ''NortheastDirect'' services to ''Acela Regional'', while the Metroliners would be replaced with the new ''Acela Express'' service. However, the ''Empire'' and ''Keystone'' services retained their original names.

The ''Acela Regional'' name was first applied to ''NortheastDirect'' trains 130<U+2013>133 on January 31, 2000.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB735098C4CB57B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title= Amtrak begins Phila-Boston service that's 45 minutes faster "Acela Regionals" go into service as the first step in improvements on the Northeast Corridor line |work= Philadelphia Inquirer |date= February 1, 2000 |accessdate=2009-08-30}}</ref> Those trains, 130 and 131 running weekdays only and 132 and 133 running every day, were the first [[railway electrification|electrified]] trains to run on the full Northeast Corridor.<ref>Bob Johnston, Amtrak opens Boston electrification, ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]'' April 2000</ref><ref>Ron Newman, [http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.rail.americas/tree/browse_frm/thread/38f5c6f8dff03082/16fb3d8c572994e1?rnum=1&hl=en&q=%22acela+commuter&_done=%2Fgroup%2Fmisc.transport.rail.americas%2Fbrowse_frm%2Fthread%2F38f5c6f8dff03082%2F1d1a78d58b014820%3Flnk%3Dst%26q%3D%22acela+commuter%26rnum%3D29%26hl%3Den%26#doc_16fb3d8c572994e1 Acela Regional starts January 31, 2000], misc.transport.rail.americas January 27, 2000</ref> As more trains were electrified, they too were rebranded. In 2003, due to confusion between the lower-speed ''Acela Regional'' trains and the ''Acela Express'', the ''Acela'' branding was removed from the ''NortheastDirect'' service (now the ''[[Northeast Regional]]'') and the ''Acela Commuter'' had its name changed back to the ''Clocker'' for a similar reason and ultimately discontinued on October 28, 2005.<ref>{{cite news | title=Amtrak will use name 'Acela' to describe high-speed trains only | work=Associated Press | date=2003-03-05 | accessdate=2006-11-13 | author=Laurence Arnold}}</ref>

==Engineering==
===Train design===
[[Image:Acela overhead view.jpg|thumb|right|Overhead view of the power car; an [[MBTA]] [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] train is also visible]]
The ''Acela'' trainset is a unique train designed specifically to satisfy very specific U.S. governmental rolling stock requirements. These requirements are significantly different from anywhere else in the world, including countries that have a highly functional high speed rail network. Most manufacturers who bid on the ''Acela'' were unable to meet these requirements, bringing up cost and complication for the manufacture of the trains, leaving only one manufacturer, and requiring that manufacturer to make significant engineering changes to their standard designs. These specifications are not a result of specific Northeast Corridor track conditions. Although the design of the trains, with identical 6,000 horsepower (4,470&nbsp;kW) [[High Speed Electric Locomotive|power cars]] at each end which operate on a voltage of 11,000 volts [[alternating current|AC]], and either 25 or 60 [[hertz]] (cycles per second) frequency, resemble France's [[TGV]], the only components directly derived from the TGV are the 4 asynchronous AC traction electric motors (per power car).

The tilting carriages are based upon Bombardier's earlier [[LRC (train)|LRC]] trains used on [[VIA Rail]] rather than the TGV's articulated trailers, and the locomotives and passenger cars are much heavier than those of the TGV in order to meet the United States [[Federal Railroad Administration]]'s different approach to rail crash standards.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ebbc.org/rail/fra.html |title = How the FRA is Regulating Passenger Rail Out of Existence |publisher = ''East Bay Bicycle Coalition'' |author = McCaughrin, Eric |date = March 5, 2007}}</ref> The Tier II crash standards, adopted in 1999, have also resulted in the passenger cars being designed without steps and trapdoors, which means that the trainsets can only serve stations with high-level platforms<U+2014>this currently restricts them to lines with high-level platforms such as the Northeast Corridor. Acela trains are semi-permanently coupled and are referred to as trainsets. Bombardier later used the ''Acela Express'''s carriage design and a [[diesel engine|diesel]]/[[gas turbine]] variant of the power car for their experimental [[JetTrain]].<ref>{{cite news |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_11_42/ai_99569317/ |title = Bombardier unveils new JetTrain locomotive |publisher = ''International Railway Journal'' |date=November 2002}}</ref>

===Operating speeds and limitations===
[[File:High-speed train warning sign at Kingston, RI, train station.jpg|thumb|left|Warning sign at [[Kingston Railroad Station (Rhode Island)|Kingston Station]] in Rhode Island, a two-track station in the middle of one of the Acela's {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} zones]]

With a top speed of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} the ''Acela Express'' is the only service in North America that exceeds the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]]'s {{convert|125|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} definition of high speed rail.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The ''Acela'' achieves an average speed of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} between Washington and New York, which is comparable to the ''[[Denver Zephyr]]'' service that ran at an average speed of {{convert|77|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} between Chicago and Denver in the early 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The highest speed attained by ''Acela Express'' is {{convert|150|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on two sections of track in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]. There are also many miles of track, especially east of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], that have been upgraded to allow maximum speeds in excess of {{convert|110|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. South of New York, Acela Express is limited to {{convert|135|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, even though several stretches of track there are straight enough to allow {{convert|150|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} speeds. The limiting factor is stated to be the [[overhead catenary]] support system which was constructed prior to 1935 and lacks the constant-tension features of the new catenary east of New Haven, although in the late 1960s the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] did run ''[[Metroliner (Amtrak)|Metroliner]]'' test trains as fast as {{convert|164|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and briefly intended to run the ''Metroliner'' service at speeds reaching {{convert|150|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Although the ''Acela Express'' trainsets are capable of {{convert|165|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} operation, [[Federal Railroad Administration|FRA]] regulations do not permit any speeds above {{convert|150|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on tracks that are shared with freight and slower passenger trains regardless of circumstances, and for ''Acela Express'' trains to run above {{convert|150|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} it would require purpose-built dedicated track in a separate right of way.

The slowest section of the electrified NEC is the portion owned by [[Metro-North Railroad]] and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] between [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]] and [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle, NY]]. Trains here are limited to only {{convert|90|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on a {{convert|4|mi|km}} stretch in New York State, and to {{convert|75|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} between the New York state line and New Haven. Additionally, tilting is not allowed anywhere on Metro-North or ConnDOT (Connecticut Dept. of Transportation) property. At a maximum 4.2<U+00B0> tilt,<ref name=tilt>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/travel/features/acelaflash.htm|title=All Aboard Amtrak's Acela|date=Click on "Continue", then on "Staying Steady"|publisher=Washington Post (2000)|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> the ''Acela Express'' trainset would pass other trains on parallel tracks only {{convert|10|in|cm}} away, which is too close for FRA-mandated clearances. ConnDOT has a number of projects either planned or underway that will upgrade the catenary system,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31942034_ITM |title = High wire to efficiency |publisher = Railway Age |date = March 01, 1992 |accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref> replace outdated bridges, and straighten certain sections of the New Haven Line to eventually enable the ''Acela'' trains to run at their {{convert|150|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} top speed.

The scheduled transit time for the 5:00 a.m. departure from Washington, D.C., (the quickest stopping pattern) to Boston's South Station on ''Acela Express'' service is roughly 6&nbsp;hours 36&nbsp;minutes. Allowing for the fifteen-minute scheduled layover in New York City, the average speed is {{convert|72|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} for the {{convert|456|mi|km}} trip. For the {{convert|225|mi|km}} journey between Washington, D.C., and New York's Penn Station, the transit time is 2&nbsp;hours 48&nbsp;minutes, an average speed of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. If the infrastructure supporting the Acela were upgraded to allow for an average speed of {{convert|125|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, the current 6.5 hour journey between Boston and Washington would be just under four hours and 45&nbsp;minutes.

On July 9, 2007, Amtrak introduced two limited-stop trains. Train 2105 left New York Penn Station at 6:50 a.m, made only one stop, in Philadelphia, and arrived in Washington at 9:25 a.m. Northbound, train 2120 departed Washington at 3:55 p.m., stopped in Philadelphia, and arrived in New York at 6:30 p.m. This shortened the trip between the two cities to just 2 hours 35 minutes, making the trip roughly an hour faster than some of the ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' train services. These trains were an experiment on Amtrak's part to find ways to expedite travel time on the Acela despite the speed restrictions on certain parts of the line. Amtrak has since dropped these two limited-stop trains. In the Amtrak Northeast Corridor 1 train schedule effective August 4, 2008, trains 2105 and 2120 are not listed.<ref name="Amtrak Northeast Corridor 1 train schedule effective August 4, 2008">{{cite web| publisher=[[Amtrak]]| date=2008-08-04| url=http://www.amtrak.com/timetable/aug08/W02.pdf| format=PDF| title=Northeast Corridor timetable| accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref>

===High speed issues===

The dense population of the northeastern United States makes the [[Northeast Corridor]] the most heavily traveled portion of the American passenger rail system.

In order to compete with [[airliner]]s, Amtrak needed to increase the speed of trains in the region. However, the former [[Shore Line Railway (Connecticut)|Shore Line]], from [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], is burdened by sharp turns and [[grade crossing]]s, the crossings being especially of concern in regard to high-speed rail.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/40117741.html?dids=40117741:40117741&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+29%2C+1999&author=JANE+E.+DEE%3B+Courant+Staff+Writer&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=RAIL+CROSSINGS+SAFETY+ISSUE+FOR+AMTRAK&pqatl=google |title=Rail crossings safety concern for Amtrak |author=Jane Dee |work=Hartford Courant |date=March 29, 1999 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53008353.html |title=U.S. DOT: America's first "smart" highway-rail crossing is dedicated in Groton, Connecticut |work=M2 Presswire |date=August 27, 1998 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> There was little support for building an entirely new railway as had been done for Japan's [[Shinkansen]] ("Bullet Train"), Spain's [[AVE]], France's [[TGV]] and Germany's [[Intercity-Express]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  A former "high speed rail" alignment from New Haven to Boston was built in the 1880s, but was gradually abandoned in sections ending in 1955, eventually becoming [[Airline State Park]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

[[tilting train|Tilting]] enables passengers to ride more comfortably on curved sections of track faster than would otherwise be possible, by leaning into the bend. The technology has been implemented on other service lines such the [[British Rail Class 390]] trains which run at a speed of {{convert|125|mph|km/h}} on [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Victorian era]] rail lines.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5369808.stm |publisher = BBC News |title = Virgin train breaks speed record |accessdate = 2009-08-29 | date=2006-09-22}}</ref> ''Acela'' trainsets tilt above 60&nbsp;mph on most of the system, but some segments of track in the Northeast Corridor are too close together for the carriages to safely tilt while maintaining [[Federal Railroad Administration|FRA]] minimum space between trains on parallel tracks. Furthermore, Metro-North Railroad restricts tilting on the segment of track north of New York owned by them. While the system was originally designed for a 6.8<U+00B0> tilt, the cars were redesigned 4&nbsp;inches wider to accommodate wider seats and aisles that reduced allowable tilt to a more modest 4.2<U+00B0> to fit within the clearance constraints of the existing tracks.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite news |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/travel/features/acelaflash.htm |title = Inside the Acela |publisher = Washington Post |accessdate = 2009-08-29 | date=2000-11-30}}</ref><ref name="Railfan Europe Acela Article">{{Cite web |url = http://www.railfaneurope.net/tgv/acela.html |publisher = railfaneurope.net |title = Acela Article |accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref> Traveling at higher than 135&nbsp;mph also requires constant-tension catenary, which is only implemented on the more modern catenary system north of New York.

''Acela'' service was originally expected in late 1999, but various problems appeared. The catenary system was not able to support the speeds originally intended between Washington and New York, but the more modern system between New York and Boston allows the higher speeds. A brief political controversy drew attention to the decreased 4.2<U+00B0> tilt, but this was not to be the root of the speed problem, as the tracks from New York to Boston are similar to those between New York and Washington, and the tilt mechanism is not the factor that allows the high speeds.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/><ref name="Railfan Europe Acela Article"/><ref name="bedeviled">{{cite news |last = Dao |first = James |title = Acela, Built to Be Rail's Savior, Bedevils Amtrak at Every Turn |publisher = [[The New York Times]] |date = 2005-04-24 |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/national/24acela.html&OQ=_rQ3D1&OP=dcc795Q2FzmQ5DQ23zVcQ7BTjccQ22DzDBBQ60zBHzDHzxQ7DQ22Q3CcxQ7D.zDHQ7DQ7BQ5D.Q7DiQ5BQ22Q20. |accessdate = 2008-03-04}}</ref> After a series of delays, the first Acela Express service began on December 11, 2000, a year behind schedule.<ref>{{cite news | title=Fast train begins service with Washington-Boston roundtrip | author=Laurence Arnold | work=Associated Press | date=2001-12-11 | accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref>

With the completion of electrification between New Haven and Boston, all trains on the line have become faster. ''Acela'' travels between Boston and New York in about three and a half hours (an improvement of half an hour). New York to Washington runs take two hours and forty-five minutes (still slightly longer than [[Penn Central]]'s ''[[Metroliner (Amtrak)|Metroliner]]'' trains ran in the late 1960s before [[Amtrak]] took over). These schedules, as well as the relative convenience of rail as opposed to air travel especially after [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], and direct downtown-to-downtown service have made the ''Acela Express'' more competitive with the Northeast [[air shuttle]]s.

==Service==
===Composition===
The ''Acela Express'' trainset consists of two [[power car]]s, a cafe car, a first class car, and four business class cars, semi-permanently coupled together. The train has newer seats than regional service counterparts. The first class car has 43 seats and there are 260 business class seats on each trainset. Business class cars have 4 seats across (2 seats across on each side) and four-seat tables. First class has 3 seats across (1 on one side, 2 on the other side) and four seat tables. The car adjacent to first class is designated as the quiet car, where passengers are asked to refrain from loud talking and mobile phone conversations.

Automatic sliding doors provide access between cars throughout the length of the train and reduce noise. Baggage may be stowed in overhead luggage compartments, or underneath the passenger's seat. Reservations guarantee seating but seats themselves are not assigned. ''Acela'' trains are also wheelchair-[[accessible]].

===Staffing and operation===
Generally Amtrak train crews consist of an engineer, a conductor, and at least one assistant conductor. ''Acela'' trains also have an on-board service crew consisting of two First Class attendants and a Cafe Car attendant. In addition to the buffet service provided in the Cafe Car, on some trains, a cart attendant will also provide a steward service, serving refreshments throughout the train. First Class passengers are served meals at their seats on all services.

At Amtrak, the On Board Service is considered separate and subordinate to the Train and Engine crews. Acela maintenance is generally taken care of at the Ivy City facility in Washington, DC, Sunnyside Yard in Queens, NY or Southampton St. Yard in Boston, MA. 

The Acela trainsets are currently being refurbished at the Penn Coach Yard, next to 30th Station in Philadelphia, PA. These refurbishments include new blue leather seats throughout the trainset and eventually totally remodeled cafe cars with more seating than the previous configuration allowed. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===2002===
In August 2002, shortly after their introduction, ''Acela Express'' trainsets were briefly removed from service when the brackets that connected truck ([[bogie]]) dampers (shocks) to the powerunit carbodies ("yaw dampers") were found to be cracking.<ref>{{cite news |publisher = USA Today |date = August 20, 2002 |accessdate = 2009-08-29 |url = http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2002/2002-08-20-acela-woes.htm |title = Discovery of hairline cracks causes more problems for Amtrak's Acela Express}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher = Boston Globe |date = August 14, 2002 |accessdate = 2009-08-29 |url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8810199_ITM |title = Flaws Shut Down Amtrak's Acela Express Line | first=Mac | last=Daniel}}</ref> The trains were returned to service when a program of frequent inspections was instituted. The damper brackets have since been redesigned and the old brackets replaced with the newer design.

===2008===
The ''Acela Express'' between New York and Boston was taken offline June 16<U+2013>19, 2008 when Amtrak replaced the drawbridge span of the 90-year-old [[Thames River Bridge (Amtrak)|Thames River Bridge]] with a new vertical lift span to improve the reliability of the bridge, reduce the chance of operational failures, and minimize train delays.<ref>{{cite press release| publisher = Amtrak| url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/News_Release_Page&c=am2Copy&cid=1178294166689 |title=Thames River Bridge to be Closed to Rail Traffic June 14<U+2013>17 for Replacement of 90-Year-Old Vertical Lift Span| date=2008-05-28| accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> The outage was extended by two days due to complications with the removal of the bridge's counterweight.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.theday.com/re.aspx?re=e68454c8-7184-4e05-9d45-8b9828a3f4b5 |title = Archived Newstory on Thames River Bridge replacement |publisher = theday.com  |accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref>

==Incidents==
===2005===
On September 28, 2005, a southbound train became the first ''Acela'' involved in a collision at a [[grade crossing]] when it struck a car at Miner Lane in [[Waterford, Connecticut]],<ref name="High-Tech Gates Fail to Avert Car-Train Crash">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/nyregion/30acela.html?_r=1&oref=slogin| author=McGeehan, Patrick, and Wald, Matthew L.| date=2005-09-30| title=High-Tech Gates Fail to Avert Car-Train Crash| work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> one of the few remaining grade crossings on the Northeast Corridor (and one of the few on high-speed rail systems anywhere in the world).

The driver, a 62-year-old woman, and her 8-year-old grandson, were killed instantly; a 4-year-old girl survived and was airlifted to a hospital where she died nine days later.
