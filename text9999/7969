{{nihongo|'''Tidus'''|<U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30FC><U+30C0>|T<U+012B>da}} is the [[protagonist]] in the [[Square Enix]] [[console role-playing game|role-playing game]] ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''. As the lead character, the player controls Tidus through the game, manipulating his actions through the unfolding storyline in traditional ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' style. Similar to the rest of the characters in ''Final Fantasy X'', Tidus' abilities are built around a classic ''Final Fantasy'' job class<U+2014>in his case a [[Final Fantasy character classes#Warrior|Fighter]], a balanced melee class. However, he also features many abilities from the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Time Mage|Time Mage]] class in the form of supportive spells for himself and his group. Tidus is one of three characters able to fight underwater.

The storyline of ''Final Fantasy X'' revolves around Tidus, a rising [[Minigames of Final Fantasy#Blitzball|Blitzball]] star player from [[Locations in Spira#Zanarkand Ruins|Zanarkand]]. After a mysterious creature called "[[Spira (Final Fantasy)#History|Sin]]" attacked his hometown, Tidus was seemingly transported to the world of [[Spira (Final Fantasy)|Spira]]. Lost, confused, and feeling out of place, Tidus soon meets a newly fledged [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|summoner]], [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]], and her [[Spira (Final Fantasy)#Militant factions|guardians]]. The summoner is soon to set out on a pilgrimage in an attempt to put an end to the very creature that attacked Tidus' city, and by joining them, Tidus hopes he will find his way home.

==Character design==
The game's scenario writer, [[Kazushige Nojima]], has expressed the relationship between the player and the main character in a ''Final Fantasy'' title is always something he's concerned with, and when penning ''Final Fantasy X'', he wanted to try something new. He wanted to attempt establishing a connection between the player and character such that<U+2014>since both are finding themselves in a new world<U+2014>the player's progress through that world and growing knowledge about it would be reflected in Tidus' own ever-developing understanding, a connection allowed to the player through Tidus' first-person narration of most of ''Final Fantasy X'', in which the player advances that narration.<ref name="interviews">{{cite web| author=Square Enix North America Site Staff| date=2001| title=Behind The Game The Creators| url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1| publisher=Square Enix North America| accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref> Nojima created a brief description for Tidus to give the character designer, [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a rough scenario to work with. Nomura used the description to create a sketch to get input from Nojima and other staff members.<ref name=StratGuide-Interviews">{{cite book| author=Birlew, Dan| date=2001| title=Final Fantasy X Official Strategy Guide| chapter = Interviews| pages=266<U+2013>267| publisher=[[BradyGames]] Publishing| language=English| id=ISBN 0-7440-0140-4}}</ref>

Nomura has expressed after designing serious and moody main characters for ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''Final Fantasy VIII'', he wanted to give Tidus a cheerful attitude and appearance, which is reflected in the name Kazushige Nojima chose for him (''Tidaa'' is the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word for "Sun").<ref name="sun">{{cite book| year=2001| editor=Sam Kennedy and Gary Steinman| title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August, 2001| pages=96| language=English| publisher=Ziff Davis Media}}</ref><ref name="FlareG">{{cite web| author=Khosla, Sheila| date=2003| title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s| url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1| publisher=FLAREgamer| accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref> He's also explained he wanted his clothing and accessories to suggest a relationship with the sea. For example, his outfit bears a distinctive blue theme, and the symbol of Tidus' Blitzball team on his clothing is designed after a fishing hook. The symbol is designed as an amalgamation of the letters "J" and "T" (the first letters of Tidus' name and that of his father, [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Jecht|Jecht]]).<ref name="FlareG"/>

Nomura has also mentioned a contrast between the lead male and female protagonists was established by Yuna's name meaning "night" in Okinawan.<ref name="FlareG"/> This contrast is also represented with the items required to empower their Celestial Weapons; the Sun Sigil and the Sun Crest for Tidus', and the Moon Sigil and Moon Crest for Yuna's.<ref name=StratGuide-Secret">{{cite book| author=Birlew, Dan| date=2001| title=Final Fantasy X Official Strategy Guide| chapter = Secrets| pages=178| publisher = [[BradyGames]] Publishing| language=English| id=ISBN 0-7440-0140-4}}</ref> Due to the player having the option to change his default name, Tidus is never directly referred to by name during audible dialogue. The only in-game appearance of his name is on a name plate on an Auroch locker in the Luca stadium as "Tidu", written in the fictional script used in Spira.<ref>{{cite book| publisher=[[Square Enix]]| editor=Studio BentStuff| title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania <U+03A9>| pages=238 & 243| year=2001}}</ref> Because his name is never spoken out loud in ''Final Fantasy X'', its intended pronunciation has been a subject of debate among fans.

===''Final Fantasy X''===
In ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', Tidus is introduced ''[[in medias res]]'' via an in-game [[cut scene]] showcasing the main characters around a campfire back dropped by the wreckage of a city, Zanarkand. He narrates most of the game events, revealing his thoughts on certain aspects of his journey. Tidus recounts how events have led to the present, starting at his life in Zanarkand where he was a sports celebrity in [[Blitzball]], a fictional sport that combines elements of [[Hockey]], [[Soccer]], and [[Water Polo]]. <!--ref name="jecht3">'''Yuna:''' What would you do if you found him? / '''Tidus:''' Who knows? I thought he died ten years ago. Well... I'd probably just smack him one. After everything he put Mom and me through. And because he was famous, I was always... Well, you should know, Yuna. Your father's famous, too. Everyone in Spira knows him, right? Ain't it tough? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref><ref name="jecht4">'''Tidus:''' I think I just figured something out. / '''Yuna:''' What? / '''Tidus:''' Why I hate my old man. / ... / '''Tidus:''' Whenever my old man was around, my mother wouldn't even look at me. Maybe that's when I started to resent him, even hate him. When he left us... Mom just lost her energy. / ... / '''Tidus:''' The old lady next door told me... when a lovebird dies, the one left behind... It just gives up living so it can join its mate. It was just like that. I hated my old man even more. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref--> During a Blitzball tournament, Zanarkand is attacked by an immense creature shrouded in water known as Sin. The city is destroyed in its path, and Tidus is taken by Sin to the world Spira.

After arriving in Spira, Tidus encounters an eccentric salvager race, the [[Spira (Final Fantasy)#Creatures and races|Al Bhed]], and learns from a young Al Bhed girl named [[Rikku]] that [[millennium|1000 years]] have passed since the destruction of Zanarkand. After another attack by Sin, Tidus is separated from the Al Bhed and drifts to the island Besiad. While on the island he meets [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]], a summoner who planning a pilgrimage to destroy Sin, along with her guardians: [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Lulu|Lulu]], [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Wakka|Wakka]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Kimahri Ronso|Kimahri]].<ref name="IGN-Bio">{{cite web| url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14212110_biography.html| title = Tidus (Final Fantasy X) Biography| publisher = [[IGN]]| accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> Tidus navigates his way throughout Spira in the hope of finding his way home. Auron further reveals to Tidus that Yuna's father, Lord [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Braska|Braska]]; Tidus's father, Jecht; and Auron made the same pilgrimage and defeated Sin ten years ago.<ref name="sin">'''Tidus:''' Hey man, there's no way. That's just impossible. / '''Auron:''' "Nothing impossible about it. Jecht, Braska, and I... Together we defeated Sin, ten years ago. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> However, Sin returns every time it is destroyed and the current Sin is Jecht.<ref name="sin2">'''Yuna:''' Sin dies and is reborn. / '''Tidus:''' I get it! I thought it was weird. Yuna's dad defeated Sin ten years ago, right? But Sin's still here!

He is no longer human. But then... I felt something of Jecht there in that shell, couldn't you? You must have felt him when you came in contact with Sin. / '''Tidus:''' It can't be... / '''Auron:''' It is. Sin is Jecht. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> As the party approaches Zanarkand, Tidus learns he is not an ordinary human being. He and the Zanarkand he hails from, are the cumulative dreams of the [[Spira (Final Fantasy)#Aeons and fayth|fayth]].<ref name="dream">'''Tidus:''' Wait... this is a dream. / '''Fayth:''' Precisely. / '''Tidus:''' A dream? Are you crazy? I don't have time to be dreaming now! / '''Fayth:''' "You're wrong. It's not that you're dreaming. You ''are'' a dream. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Their city, Dream Zanarkand, was created at the same time as the destruction of the original Zanarkand, when Sin was created in the war between Zanarkand and [[Locations in Spira#Bevelle|Bevelle]]. The fayth of the aeon [[Bahamut#Final Fantasy series|Bahamut]] reveals to Tidus that they would like him to find a means to permanently defeat Sin, so that they can all finally rest. However, the fayth also reveals to him that if he does that, the summoning of Dream Zanarkand and all its people&mdash;including Tidus&mdash;will disappear.<ref name="rest">'''Fayth:''' Yes, you're a dream of the fayth. You, your father, your mother, everyone. All dreams. And if the fayth stop dreaming... / '''Tidus:''' No! So what if I'm a dream! I... I like being here. / '''Fayth:''' We've been dreaming so long... we're tired. Would you and your father... Would you let us rest? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>

Tidus reaches Zanarkand's ruins with Yuna and her other guardians. Inside Zanarkand, they learn from [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Zanarkand unsent|Lady Yunalesca]] that Yuna must choose one of her guardians to become her fayth for the Final Summoning. Tidus argues with the others that they must find another way to destroy Sin forever. Yuna refuses to undergo the rite of the Final Aeon after learning that it can never defeat Sin, and the party fights and defeats Yunalesca. The group then attacks Sin directly and enter its shell. Eventually, they find Jecht and Tidus is reunited with his estranged father, who transforms into his Final Aeon form and is defeated by the party. The party engages Yu Yevon in a final battle and destroys him, ridding the world of Sin permanently, as well as allowing the fayth to depart and the summoning of Dream Zanarkand to end. Tidus says goodbye on top of their airship and starts to walk away knowing that he will soon vanish. Yuna runs after him and, tells him that she loves him (in the Japanese version of the game, she says "Thank you" instead). Tidus hugs her and then dives off the airship into the clouds below, reuniting with the spirits of Auron, Jecht, and Braska in the [[Locations in Spira#Farplane|Farplane]].

===''Final Fantasy X-2''===
Tidus figures prominently into the plot of ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', though his appearances in the sequel are few. Also, because players have the option of renaming Tidus in ''Final Fantasy X'', he is exclusively referred to with pronouns ("he" and "him") just like in the first game, and Rikku calls him "you-know-who" in ''Final Fantasy X-2''. Two years after the events of ''Final Fantasy X'' end, Rikku shows Yuna a [[Spira (Final Fantasy)#Spheres|sphere]] found by Kimahri on Mt. Gagazet displaying a young man who looks like Tidus trapped in a prison. This compels Yuna to join the [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Gullwings|Gullwings]], a sphere-hunting group, and travel around Spira in the hopes of finding more clues that Tidus may be alive. The individual seen in the sphere is eventually revealed to be [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Lenne and Shuyin|Shuyin]] instead, but if the player presses the "X" button during the final scene in the Farplane, the player will be rewarded with an extra scene that features Tidus being revived by the fayth in gratitude of Yuna saving the world a second time. He is then reunited with her (the "swimming upwards" clip from the ending of the previous game is shown, and it is shown that he has been returned to Besaid) and allowed to live out a natural lifespan, so long as the Fayth can maintain it. In the ending, Yuna also begins narrating the events of the game to Tidus. If the player can manage to complete the game with 100% completion rate (doing not only the main storyline missions, but many other optional tasks), there is another final scene with Tidus and Yuna, at the Zanarkand ruins, in which he reveals the nature of his return.

===Other appearances===
[[Image:Tidus Kingdom Hearts.jpg|thumb|150px|Tidus, as he appears in ''Kingdom Hearts'']]
Tidus has also appeared in games outside of the ''Final Fantasy X'' continuity. A more youthful version of Tidus on the Destiny Islands as friends of Sora and Riku appear in [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]. In the first ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', he appears with younger versions of [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Wakka|Wakka]] and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''{{'}}s [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Selphie|Selphie Tilmitt]].<ref name="KH-StrategyGuide">{{cite book| last= Birlew| first= Dan| year = 2003| title = Kingdom Hearts Official Strategy Guide| publisher = [[BradyGames]] Publishing| language = English| isbn= 0-7440-0198-6}}</ref> In the sequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he does not actually appear within the storyline, but is briefly mentioned by Selphie.<ref>'''Selphie:''' Hey, do you feel like going out to the island?

==Reception and legacy==
[[Image:Tidus32zk.jpg|thumb|left|A Tidus [[action figure]] standing before the cover of ''The Art of Final Fantasy X'']]
Tidus has received an overall positive reception. He has been featured on the covers of the North American version of ''Final Fantasy X'' and related books. Tidus has also had various types of merchandise modeled after his likeness; for example, [[action figure]]s and [[jewelry]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.square-enix-shop.com/usa/list_product.cfm?game_cat_id=7| title = Square Enix Official Online Merchandise Store| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> [[GameSpot]] commented players might not initially like the character, but would eventually find him "suitably endearing". They stated he had the "surprising depth" characterized by past ''Final Fantasy'' protagonists, and called the ending involving Tidus "emotionally charged and satisfying".<ref name="GS-FFX-Review">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy10/review.html| title = Final Fantasy X GameSpot Review| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| first = Greg| last = Kasavin| authorlink = Greg Kasavin| date = 2001-12-14| accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> [[Eurogamer]] stated Tidus and the other characters "make much more dignified and believable decisions than those made by their predecessors in other ''Final Fantasy'' games."<ref name="EG-FFX-Review">{{cite web| url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=3204| title = Final Fantasy X Eurogamer Review| first = Tom| last = Bramwell| publisher = [[Eurogamer]]| date = 2002-06-16| accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> The relationship between Tidus and Yuna was listed by GameSpot as one of the "Great Loves" in video games. They referred to their relationship as "one of the best (and ultimately saddest) examples" of a mature romance in games and cited the progression of the romance throughout the story as one of the game's best elements. GameSpot called the story revolving around their relationship "interesting" and "tender".<ref name="GreatLove">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/6144012/p-5.html| title = Great Loves - Features at GameSpot| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| date = 2006-02-14| accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref>

Tidus was also compared to [[Squall Leonhart]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''. [[IGN]] noted the differences in appearances between the two protagonists, citing Squall's darker colored outfit and "permanent mope" and Tidus' brighter outfit and weapon along with "an indelible grin".<ref name="IGN-FFX-Review">{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/164/164008p1.html| title = Final Fantasy X IGN Review| author = IGN Staff| publisher = [[IGN]]| date = 2001-12-18| accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> Because of his English-language voice work, GameSpot commented they would have preferred "an almost-mute lead character, a la Squall from ''Final Fantasy VIII''."<ref name="GreatLove"/> Regarding the character's English-language voice work, IGN stated the character "has a tendency to speak a little too high and a little too fast when he gets excited."<ref name="IGN-FFX-Review"/> GameSpot referred to Tidus as "annoyingly whiny",<ref name="GreatLove"/> and Eurogamer echoed similar statements by referring to his voice acting as "whiny" and "detestable".<ref name="EG-FFX-Review"/>
