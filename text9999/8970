'''"Down Town"''' was the final release of [[1987]] by [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] (better known as [[The KLF]]). The song is [[gospel music]] driven by [[house music]] rhythms, incorporating a [[sampler (musical instrument)|sample]] of [[Petula Clark|Petula Clark's]] [[1964]] single "[[Downtown (song)|Downtown]]".

==Origins==
In 1987, [[Bill Drummond]] and [[Jimmy Cauty]] formed The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), and busily released provocatively [[sampling (music)|sample-heavy]] electronic music with [[beatbox]] rhythms and Drummond's socially aware [[rapping|raps]].  Their debut single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs)|All You Need Is Love]]" and album ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]'' were both investigated by the [[Mechanical Copyright Protection Society]],<ref>See for example Davage, I., letter from the [[Mechanical Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] to [[The JAMs]], reproduced in "The KLF 1987 Completeist List", an insert to ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'', [[KLF Communications]] JAMS LP2, 1988.</ref> who ordered The JAMs to recall and destroy all unsold copies of ''1987''.  A new single, "[[Whitney Joins The JAMs]]", followed, along with a satirically edited version of the album, ''[[1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits)]]'', and the debut release from spinoff project [[Disco 2000]], "[[I Gotta CD]]".  By the time of the release of "Whitney Joins The JAMs", the duo's [[independent record label]] had been renamed [[KLF Communications]], and in the coming year The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu would mutate into [[The KLF]].  In the meantime, "Down Town" was The JAMs' and KLF Communications' final release of 1987, a [[7-inch single|7"]] and [[12-inch single|12"]] single release of [[30 November]].<ref name="discog">Longmire, Ernie et al. [http://www.klf.de/discography/ KLF discography] Compiled by Ernie Longmire, this has been the authoratative KLF discography on the internet for some 10 years or more and has been the subject of long-term scrutiny and peer review by KLF fans and collectors. It is now maintained by the fan site klf.de. Retrieved 19 June 2006.</ref>  It did not enter the [[UK Singles Chart]], but made inroads into the UK independent chart.<ref>"Downtown Ancients head up the indie chart", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 19 December 1987.</ref><!--http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=54-->

In an interview with ''[[NME]]'', Drummond and Cauty maintained that the record was originally intended to be sample-free, but, quoting the [[Book of Proverbs]], Drummond admitted that "as a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his folly".<ref name="Smith">Smith, M. E., "The Great TUNE Robbery", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 12 December 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=52 link]).</ref>  In addition to Petula Clark's "Downtown", "Down Town" used elements of the distinctive bassline to [[Harold Faltermeyer|Harold Faltermeyer's]] 1984 # 1 single "[[Axel F]]".  Indeed, the labels of the record claimed that: "All sounds on this recording have been captured by The KLF. In the name of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], we hereby liberate these sounds from all copyright restrictions, without prejudice".<ref>Sleevenotes, "Down Town", KLF Communications JAMS 27T, November 1987.</ref>  Although The JAMs sought permission from [[Tony Hatch]], who wrote Clark's "Downtown", Drummond admitted in [[KLF Communications]] newsletter: "We were surprised to read in the papers that Pet Clarke [sic] had given her permission for us to sample her classic 'Downtown' on our record of the same name. When we attempted to contact her, at her [[Switzerland|Swiss]] home, to do just this thing, we didn't get further than her refusing to accept our [[collect call|transfer charge]]."<ref>[[Bill Drummond|Drummond, B.]], KLF Information Sheet, [[KLF Communications]], 22 January 1988 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=501 link]).</ref>

The inclusion of Petula Clark's "Downtown" was claimed by Drummond to be a striking coincidence: {{cquote|One day I was in the studio and I just started humming the chorus of 'Downtown' over the intro. I thought 'That's funny I wonder what [[key (music)|key]] it's in?' I dug out the record that night and found that it was in the same key. I took it into the studio the next day and found out that it was absolutely the same number of [[beats per minute]] (bpm)<U+2014>118. Most pop songs are between 80 and 160 bpm so that's 80 times 12, so it was a one in 960 chance that it would be the right bpm ''and'' the right key, so we couldn't resist it.<ref name="Smith" />}}

"Down Town" was not included on either of The JAMs' albums, instead featuring on their 1988 [[compilation album|compilation]] and [[remix album]], ''[[Shag Times]]'', along with an instrumental remix credited to The KLF.

{{multi-listen end}}
{{sample box end}}"Down Town" is, like most of Drummond and Cauty's work of 1987, a social critique of [[Great Britain]] realised as [[house music]].  Its central theme is [[social exclusion]], poverty and homelessness, in which snatches of Clark's "Downtown"<U+2014>an awestruck ode to [[hedonism|hedonistic]] city [[nightlife]]<U+2014>are juxtaposed with raps by Drummond, wailing sirens and original choral [[gospel music|gospel]] vocals full of optimism provided by the [[London Community Gospel Choir]].<ref name="review">"Down Town" review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 28 November 1987.</ref>  These disparate elements are held together by a beatbox rhythm, a bassline borrowed from "Axel F", and an accompaniment of piano and [[Hammond organ]].

During one verse, Drummond raps: "Downtown, down and out, dying in the dead of night, with your [[Special Brew]] and your special view of a world that could be right".  Joined by the gospel choir's refrain of "''Glory!''", Drummond continues "[''Glory!''] What glory? [''Glory!''] In a winebar world? [''Glory!''] in a [[tenement]] block? [''Glory!''] OK, let's hear it!".

==Reviews==
"Down Town" was, after "All You Need Is Love", the second of The JAMs' three 1987 singles to become ''NME'' "single of the week".<ref name="review" />  ''NME'' called it "One massive hell-hating holler of a song", and concluded: "[The JAMs] may not be the hippest, sanest or sweetest band to stalk the Earth this year but they're certainly the most imaginative.... [T]hey've fired a musical trail so shocking they couldn't have kept you more on your toes if they'd stuffed a handgrenade up your ass and sent you out to [[tap dance]] in a pair of [[stiletto heel|stilettos]]".<ref name="review" />

The following week, ''NME'' journalist James Brown interviewed June Montana and Cressida Cauty (Jimmy Cauty's wife), vocalists for [[Disco 2000]], a KLF Communications side-project produced by Drummond and Cauty.  Brown noted the accomplished dance music production of recent KLF Communications releases:
{{cquote|When I broadcasted ["Down Town"] throughout the ''NME'' offices last week everyone present from [[Punk ideology|punk]], to [[yuppie]], to [[club scene|club basher]], to [[Alexander O'Neal]] fan gathered round to ask what it was.  The same reactions had greeted "Whitney Joins The JAMs" but none of the writers had gone off and ordered a copy immediately.  Likewise the accessibility of [Disco 2000's] "[[I Gotta CD]]" can't go ignored.  And although [The JAMs] only produced it, the surprising dance-awareness ... has come as a surprise to both the KLF and myself.  If they were prepared to destroy their abstract political ideas the KLF could quite rapidly become something akin to Kingboy, Rockman, and [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Waterman]].<ref>Brown, J., "2000 OD", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 5 December 1987.</ref>}}

However, ''[[Record Mirror]]'' did not approve of The JAMs' comparatively sample-free offering, calling "Down Town" "a creature tamed" and wondering "without outlaw credentials what's left?"<ref>"Down Town" review, ''[[Record Mirror]]'', 6 December 1987.</ref><!--http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=51-->
