'''Guy Fawkes Night''', also known as '''Guy Fawkes Day''' and '''Bonfire Night''', is an annual commemoration observed on or about 5&nbsp;November, primarily in Great Britain.  Its history begins with the events of 5&nbsp;November 1605, when [[Guy Fawkes]], a member of the [[Gunpowder Plot]], was caught guarding explosives placed beneath the [[House of Lords]] and arrested.  Celebrating the fact that [[James I of England|King James I]] had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London, and months later the introduction of the [[Observance of 5th November Act 1605|Observance of 5th November Act]] enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.

Within a few decades Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was known, became the predominant English state commemoration, but as it carried strong religious overtones it also became a focus for anti-Catholic sentiment.  [[Puritans]] delivered sermons regarding the perceived dangers of [[popery]], while during increasingly raucous celebrations common folk burnt [[effigy|effigies]] of popular hate-figures, such as the [[pope]].  Towards the end of the 18th century reports appear of children begging for money with effigies of Guy Fawkes and 5&nbsp;November gradually became known as Guy Fawkes Day.  Towns such as [[Lewes]] and [[Guildford]] were in the 19th century scenes of increasingly violent class-based confrontations, fostering traditions those towns celebrate still, albeit peaceably.  In the 1850s changing attitudes eventually resulted in the toning down of much of the day's anti-Catholic rhetoric, and in 1859 the original 1606 legislation was repealed.  Eventually, the violence was dealt with, and by the 20th century Guy Fawkes Day had become an enjoyable social commemoration, although lacking much of its original focus.  The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at large organised events, centred around a bonfire and extravagant firework displays.

{{Anchor||Pope_Day}}Settlers exported Guy Fawkes Night to overseas colonies, including some in North America, where it was known as Pope Day.  Those festivities died out with the onset of the [[American Revolution]], although celebrations continue in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations.  Claims that Guy Fawkes Night was a Protestant replacement for older customs like [[Samhain]] are disputed, although another old celebration, [[Halloween]], has lately increased in popularity, and according to some writers, may threaten the continued observance of 5&nbsp;November.

==Origins and history in England==

Guy Fawkes Night originates from the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605, a failed conspiracy by a group of provincial English [[Catholics]] to assassinate the [[Protestant]] King [[James I of England]] and replace him with a Catholic head of state.<!-- not cited here -->  In the immediate aftermath of the arrest of [[Guy Fawkes]], caught guarding a cache of explosives placed beneath the [[House of Lords]], James's Council allowed the public to celebrate the king's survival with bonfires, so long as they were "without any danger or disorder",<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=207}}</ref> making 1605 the first year the plot's failure was celebrated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=351<U+2013>352}}</ref>  Days before the surviving conspirators were executed in January 1606, Parliament passed the [[Observance of 5th November Act 1605]], commonly known as the "Thanksgiving Act".  It was proposed by a Puritan Member of Parliament, [[Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton|Edward Montagu]], who suggested that the king's apparent deliverance by divine intervention deserved some measure of official recognition, and kept 5&nbsp;November free as a day of thanksgiving while in theory making attendance at Church mandatory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|pp=78<U+2013>79}}</ref>  A new form of service was also added to the [[Church of England]]'s [[Book of Common Prayer]], for use on 5&nbsp;November.<ref>Edward L. Bond, ''Spreading the gospel in colonial Virginia'' (Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, 2005), p. 93</ref>

Little is known about the earliest celebrations.  In settlements such as [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Norwich]] and [[Nottingham]], corporations provided music and artillery salutes.  [[Canterbury]] celebrated 5&nbsp;November 1607 with 106&nbsp;pounds of gunpowder and 14&nbsp;pounds of match, and three years later food and drink was provided for local dignitaries, as well as music, explosions and a parade by the local militia.  Even less is known of how the occasion was first commemorated by the general public, although records indicate that in Protestant [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] a sermon was read, the church bells rung, and bonfires and fireworks lit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=87}}</ref>

===Religious significance===
According to historian and author [[Antonia Fraser]], a study of the earliest sermons preached demonstrates an anti-Catholic concentration "mystical in its fervour".<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=352}}</ref>  Delivering one of five 5&nbsp;November sermons printed in ''A Mappe of Rome'' in 1612, [[Thomas Taylor (clergyman)|Thomas Taylor]] spoke of the "generality of his [a papist's] cruelty," which had been "almost without bounds".<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=88}}</ref>  Such messages were also spread in printed works like Francis Herring's ''Pietas Pontifica'' (republished in 1610 as ''Popish Piety''), and John Rhode's ''A Brief Summe of the Treason intended against the King & State'', which in 1606 sought to educate "the simple and ignorant ... that they be not seduced any longer by papists".<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|pp=88<U+2013>89}}</ref>  By the 1620s 5&nbsp;November was honoured in market towns and villages across the country, though it was some years before it was commemorated throughout England.  Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was then known, became the predominant English state commemoration.  Some parishes made the day a festive occasion, with public drinking and solemn processions.  Concerned though about James's pro-Spanish foreign policy, the decline of international Protestantism, and Catholicism in general, Protestant clergymen who recognised the day's significance called for more dignified and profound thanksgivings each 5&nbsp;November.<ref name="Cressyp73">{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|p=73}}</ref><ref name="Huttonpp394395">{{Harvnb|Hutton|2001|pp=394<U+2013>395}}</ref>

What unity English Protestants had shared in 1606 began to fade when in 1625 James's son, the future [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], married the Catholic [[Henrietta Maria of France]].  Puritans reacted to the marriage by issuing a new prayer to warn against rebellion and Catholicism, and on 5&nbsp;November that year, effigies of the pope and the devil were burnt, the earliest such report of this practice and the beginning of centuries of tradition.<!-- the latter part of this sentence taken from Cressy pp74-75, as Sharpe has found an earlier example of effigy-burning and Cressy's point would therefore seem to be out of date.  See the "Whore of Babylon".-->{{#tag:ref|Nationally, effigies of Fawkes were subsequently joined by those of contemporary hate figures such as the pope, the [[sultan of Turkey]], the [[tsar of Russia]] and the Irish leader [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].  In 1899 an effigy of the [[South African Republic]] leader [[Paul Kruger]] was burnt at [[Ticehurst]], and during the 20th century effigies of militant [[suffragist]]s, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]] were similarly burnt.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=83<U+2013>84}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=356<U+2013>357}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Nicholls | first = Mark | contribution = The Gunpowder Plot | format = {{ODNBsub}} | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/92749 | accessdate = 4&nbsp;November 2010}}</ref>|group="nb"}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=89}}</ref>  During Charles's reign Gunpowder Treason Day became increasingly partisan.  Between 1629 and 1640 he ruled without Parliament, and he seemed to support [[Arminianism]], regarded by Puritans like [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]] as a step toward Catholicism.  By 1636, under the leadership of the Arminian Archbishop of Canterbury [[William Laud]], the English church was trying to use 5&nbsp;November to denounce all seditious practices, and not just popery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=90}}</ref>  Puritans went on the defensive, some pressing for further [[Protestant Reformation|reformation]] of the Church.<ref name="Cressyp73"/>

[[File:Lewes photograph by heather buckley from flickr.jpg|right|thumb|Revellers in [[Lewes]], 5&nbsp;November 2010]]
Bonfire Night, as it was occasionally known,<ref name="Huttonp395"/> assumed a new fervour during the events leading up to the [[English Interregnum]].  Although [[Cavalier|Royalists]] disputed their interpretations, [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]] began to uncover or fear new Catholic plots.  Preaching before the House of Commons on 5&nbsp;November 1644, [[Charles Herle]] claimed that Papists were tunnelling "from Oxford, Rome, Hell, to Westminster, and there to blow up, if possible, the better foundations of your houses, their liberties and privileges".<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|p=74}}</ref>  A display in 1647 at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] commemorated "God's great mercy in delivering this kingdom from the hellish plots of papists", and included fireballs burning in the water (symbolising a Catholic association with "infernal spirits") and fireboxes, their many rockets suggestive of "popish spirits coming from below" to enact plots against the king.  Effigies of Fawkes and the pope were present, the latter represented by [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], Greek god of the underworld.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=92}}</ref>

Following Charles I's execution in 1649, the country's new republican regime remained undecided on how to treat 5&nbsp;November.  Unlike the old system of religious feasts and State anniversaries, it survived, but as a celebration of parliamentary government and Protestantism, and not of monarchy.<ref name="Huttonp395"/>  Commonly the day was still marked by bonfires and miniature explosives, but formal celebrations resumed only with the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] became king.  Courtiers, [[High Church|High Anglicans]] and [[Tories]] followed the official line, that the event marked God's preservation of the English throne, but generally the celebrations became more diverse.  By 1670 London apprentices had turned 5&nbsp;November into a fire festival, attacking not only popery but also "sobriety and good order",<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|p=75}}</ref> demanding money from coach occupants for alcohol and bonfires.  The burning of effigies, largely unknown to the [[Jacobean era|Jacobeans]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=70<U+2013>71}}</ref> continued<!-- see above comment re Sharpe and Cressy --> in 1673 when Charles's brother, the [[James II of England|Duke of York]], converted to Catholicism.  In response, accompanied by a procession of about 1,000 people, the apprentices fired an effigy of the [[Whore of Babylon]], bedecked with a range of papal symbols.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=74<U+2013>75}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|pp=96<U+2013>97}}</ref>  Similar scenes occurred over the following few years.  In 1677 elements of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s [[Accession Day tilt|Accession Day celebration]] of 17&nbsp;November were incorporated into the Fifth, with the burning of large bonfires, a large effigy of the pope<U+2014>his belly filled with live cats "who squalled most hideously as soon as they felt the fire"<U+2014>and two effigies of devils "whispering in his ear".  Two years later, as the [[Exclusion Bill|exclusion crisis]] was reaching its zenith, an observer noted the "many bonfires and burning of popes as has ever been seen".  Violent scenes in 1682 forced London's militia into action, and to prevent any repetition the following year a proclamation was issued, banning bonfires and fireworks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|pp=98<U+2013>100}}</ref>

Fireworks were also banned under [[James II of England|James II]], who became king in 1685.  Attempts by the government to tone down Gunpowder Treason Day celebrations were, however, largely unsuccessful, and some reacted to a ban on bonfires in London (born from a fear of more burnings of the pope's effigy) by placing candles in their windows, "as a witness against Catholicism".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hutton|2001|p=397}}</ref>  When James was deposed in 1688 by [[William III of England|William of Orange]]<U+2014>who importantly, landed in England on 5&nbsp;November<U+2014>the day's events turned also to the celebration of freedom and religion, with elements of anti-[[Jacobitism]].  While the earlier ban on bonfires was politically motivated, a ban on fireworks was maintained for safety reasons, "much mischief having been done by squibs".<ref name="Huttonp395">{{Harvnb|Hutton|2001|p=395}}</ref>

===Guy Fawkes Day===
William's birthday fell on 4&nbsp;November, and for orthodox [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] the two days therefore became an important double anniversary.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pratt|2006|p=57}}</ref>  He ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5&nbsp;November be amended to include thanks for his "happy arrival" and "the Deliverance of our Church and Nation".<ref>{{Citation | last = Schwoerer | first = Lois G. | title = Celebrating the Glorious Revolution, 1689-1989 | work = Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies, number 1 | volume = 22 | date = Spring 1990 | page = 3 | publisher = The North American Conference on British Studies, hosted at jstor.org | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/4050254}}</ref>  As one of 49&nbsp;official holidays, for the ruling class, 5&nbsp;November became overshadowed by events such as the birthdays of [[Admiral]] [[Edward Vernon]], or [[John Wilkes]], and under [[George II of England|George II]] and [[George III of England|George III]], with the exception of the [[Jacobite Rising of 1745]], it was largely "a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving".<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|p=77}}</ref>  For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry.  This theme continued into the 19th century, with reports in [[Lewes]] of annual rioting, intimidation of "respectable householders"<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|p=79}}</ref> and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels.  In [[Guildford]], gangs of revellers who called themselves "guys" terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=76<U+2013>79}}</ref>  Similar problems arose in [[Exeter]], originally the scene of more traditional celebrations.  In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter [[Henry Phillpotts]], a [[High Church]] [[Anglican]] and [[High Tory]] who opposed [[Reform Act 1832|Parliamentary reform]], and who was also suspected of being involved in "creeping popery".  A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|pp=157<U+2013>159}}</ref>  

[[File:Punch guy fawkes pope 1850.jpg|right|upright|thumb|The restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 provoked a strong reaction.  This sketch is from an issue of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', printed in November that year.]]
At some point in the 18th century and for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope.  Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day had turned into Guy Fawkes Day.  In 1790 ''The Times'' reported instances of children "...begging for money for Guy Faux",<ref name="Cressypp7980">{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=79<U+2013>80}}</ref> and a report of 4&nbsp;November 1802 described how "a set of idle fellows&nbsp;... with some horrid figure dressed up as a ''Guy Faux''" were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as "idle and disorderly persons".<ref>{{Citation | title = The great annoyance occasioned to the public by a set of idle fellows | format = {{ODNBsub}} | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/465/752/94416257w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS51520356&dyn=11!xrn_5_0_CS51520356&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | publisher = The Times, hosted at infotrac.galegroup.com | date = 4&nbsp;November 1802 | page = 3 | issue = 5557 | column = D | accessdate = 7&nbsp;November 2010}}</ref>  The Fifth had become "a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent cross-referencing, meaning all things to all men".<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|p=76}}</ref>

On several occasions during the 19th century ''[[The Times]]'' reported that the tradition was in decline, being "of late years almost forgotten", but in the opinion of historian David Cressy, such reports reflected "other Victorian trends" and not general observance of the Fifth.<ref name="Cressypp7980"/>  Civil unrest brought about by the union of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1800 resulted in Parliament passing the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]], which afforded Catholics greater civil rights, continuing the process of [[Catholic Emancipation]] in the two kingdoms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|pp=114<U+2013>115}}</ref>  The traditional denunciations of Catholicism had been in decline since the early 18th century,<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|pp=110<U+2013>111}}</ref> and were thought by many, including [[Queen Victoria]], to be outdated,<ref name="Huttonp401"/> but the pope's [[Universalis Ecclesiae|restoration in 1850]] of the English Catholic hierarchy gave renewed significance to 5&nbsp;November, as demonstrated by the burnings of effigies of the new Catholic Archbishop of Westminster [[Nicholas Wiseman]], and the pope.  At [[Farringdon Market]] 14&nbsp;effigies were processed from the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and over [[Westminster Bridge]] to [[Southwark]], while extensive demonstrations were held throughout the suburbs of London.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=150}}</ref>  Effigies of the twelve new English Catholic bishops were paraded through Exeter, already the scene of severe public disorder on each anniversary of the Fifth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=159}}</ref>  Gradually, however, such scenes became less popular.<!-- not specifically cited, however most sources indicate that anti-catholic sentiment became less popular during the latter half of the 19th century -->  The thanksgiving prayer of 5&nbsp;November contained in the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]] was abolished, with little resistance in Parliament, and in March 1859 the [[Anniversary Days Observance Act 1859|Anniversary Days Observance Act]] repealed the original 1606 Act.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=82<U+2013>83}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=354<U+2013>356}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Anon|1859|p=4}}</ref>  As the authorities dealt with the worst excesses, public decorum was gradually restored.  The sale of fireworks was restricted,<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=84<U+2013>85}}</ref> and the Guildford "guys" were neutered in 1865, although this was too late for one constable, who died of his wounds.<ref name="Huttonp401">{{Harvnb|Hutton|2001|p=401}}</ref>  Violence continued in Exeter for some years, peaking in 1867, when incensed by rising food prices and banned from firing their customary bonfire, a mob was twice in one night driven from [[St Martin's Church, Exeter|Cathedral Close]] by armed infantry.<!-- fixed bayonets at first, not sure about second -->  Further riots occurred in 1879, but there were no more bonfires in Cathedral Close after 1894.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bohstedt|2010|p=252}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|pp=159<U+2013>160}}</ref>  Elsewhere, [[Mischief night|sporadic instances]] of public disorder persisted late into the 20th century, accompanied by large numbers of firework-related accidents, but a national Firework Code and improved public safety has in most cases brought an end to such things.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hutton|2001|pp=405<U+2013>406}}</ref>

[[File:6 november bonfire from flickr user sjnikon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Colour photograph|Spectators gather around a bonfire at [[Himley Hall]] near [[Dudley]], on 6&nbsp;November 2010]]
Organised entertainments became popular in the late 19th century, and 20th-century pyrotechnic manufacturers renamed Guy Fawkes Day as Firework Night.  Sales of fireworks dwindled somewhat during the First World War, but resumed in the following peace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=85<U+2013>86}}</ref>  At the start of the Second World War celebrations were again suspended, resuming in November 1945.<ref>{{Citation | title = Guy Fawkes' Day | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ukgEAAAAMBAJ | page = 43 | work = Time Magazine, number 24 | publisher = Time Inc | date = 10&nbsp;December 1945 | volume = 19 | issn = 00243019}}</ref>  For many families Guy Fawkes Night became a domestic celebration, and children often congregated on street corners, accompanied by their own effigy of Guy Fawkes.  This was sometimes ornately dressed and sometimes a barely-recognisable bundle of straw and rags,<!-- state of dress not cited here but obvious from contemporary photographs --> but the custom of begging for a "penny for the Guy" has lately almost completely disappeared.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=157}}</ref>  In contrast, some older customs still survive; in [[Ottery St Mary]] men chase each other through the streets with lit tar barrels,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hutton|2001|pp=406<U+2013>407}}</ref> and since 1679 Lewes has been the setting of some of England's most extravagant 5&nbsp;November celebrations, the [[Lewes Bonfire]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|pp=147<U+2013>152}}</ref>

Generally, modern 5&nbsp;November celebrations are run by local charities and other organisations, with paid admission and controlled access.  Author [[Martin Kettle]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', bemoaned an "occasionally nannyish" attitude to fireworks which discourages people from holding firework displays in their back gardens, and an "unduly sensitive attitude" toward the anti-Catholic sentiment once so prominent on Guy Fawkes Night.<ref>{{Citation | last = Kettle | first = Martin | title = The real festival of Britain | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/nov/05/comment.martinkettle | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 5&nbsp;November 2003 | accessdate = 10&nbsp;May 2011}}</ref>  David Cressy summarised the modern celebration with these words: "the rockets go higher and burn with more colour, but they have less and less to do with memories of the Fifth of November&nbsp;...it might be observed that Guy Fawkes' Day is finally declining, having lost its connection with politics and religion.  But we have heard that many times before."<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=86<U+2013>87}}</ref>{{-}}

===Similarities with other customs===
[[File:Spectators watching fireworks display from Flickr user KSDigital.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A fireworks display on 5&nbsp;November 2010]]
Historians have often suggested that Guy Fawkes Day served as a Protestant replacement for the ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] festivals of [[Samhain]], [[pagan]] events that the church absorbed and transformed into [[All Hallow's Eve]] and [[All Souls' Day]].  In ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', the Scottish anthropologist [[James George Frazer]] suggested that Guy Fawkes Day exemplifies "the recrudescence of old customs in modern shapes".  [[David Underdown]], writing in his 1987 work ''Revel, Riot, and Rebellion'', viewed Gunpowder Treason Day as a replacement for Hallowe'en: "just as the early church had taken over many of the pagan feasts, so did Protestants acquire their own rituals, adapting older forms or providing substitutes for them".<ref>{{Harvnb|Underdown|1987|p=70}}</ref>  While the use of bonfires to mark the occasion was most likely taken from the ancient practice of lighting celebratory bonfires, the idea that the commemoration of 5&nbsp;November 1605 ever originated from anything other than the safety of James I is, according to David Cressy, "speculative nonsense".<ref>{{Harvnb|Cressy|1992|pp=69<U+2013>71}}</ref>  Citing Cressy's work, [[Ronald Hutton]] agrees with his conclusion, writing, "There is, in brief, nothing to link the Hallowe'en fires of North Wales, Man, and central Scotland with those which appeared in England upon 5&nbsp;November."<ref name="Huttonp394">{{Harvnb|Hutton|2001|p=394}}</ref>  Further confusion arises in [[Northern Ireland]], where some communities celebrate Guy Fawkes Night; the distinction there between the Fifth, and Halloween, is not always clear.<ref>{{Citation | last = Santino | first = Jack | title = Light up the Sky: Halloween Bonfires and Cultural Hegemony in Northern Ireland | work = Western Folklore, number 3 | volume = 55 | date = Summer 1996 | pages = 213<U+2013>2311 | publisher = Western States Folklore Society, hosted at jstor.org | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/1500482}}</ref>  Despite such disagreements, in 2005 [[David Cannadine]] commented on the encroachment into British culture of late 20th-century American Hallowe'en celebrations, and their effect on Guy Fawkes Night:

{{quote|Nowadays, family bonfire gatherings are much less popular, and many once-large civic celebrations have been given up because of increasingly intrusive health and safety regulations.  But 5&nbsp;November has also been overtaken by a popular festival that barely existed when I was growing up, and that is Halloween&nbsp;... Britain is not the Protestant nation it was when I was young: it is now a multi-faith society.  And the Americanised Halloween is sweeping all before it<U+2014>a vivid reminder of just how powerfully American culture and American consumerism can be transported across the Atlantic.<ref>{{Citation | last = Cannadine | first = David | authorlink = David Cannadine | title = Halloween v Guy Fawkes Day | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4408078.stm | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uCARQLE1 | archivedate = 12&nbsp;November 2010 | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | date = 4&nbsp;November 2005 | accessdate = 7&nbsp;November 2010}}</ref>}}

Another celebration involving fireworks, the five-day [[Hindu]] festival of [[Diwali]] (normally observed between mid-October and November), in 2010 began on 5&nbsp;November.  This led ''[[The Independent]]'' to comment on the similarities between the two, its reporter Kevin Rawlinson wondering "which fireworks will burn brightest".<ref>{{Citation | last = Rawlinson | first = Kevin | title = Guy Fawkes vs Diwali: Battle of Bonfire Night | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/guy-fawkes-vs-diwali-battle-of-bonfire-night-2125672.html | publisher = independent.co.uk | date = 5&nbsp;November 2010 | accessdate = 22&nbsp;March 2011}}</ref>

==In other countries==
[[File:South end forever North end forever.jpg|upright|left|thumb|1768 colonial commemoration of 5&nbsp;November 1605]]
Gunpowder Treason Day was exported by settlers to colonies around the world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=192}}</ref>  Although initially the commemoration was paid scant attention, the arrest of two boys caught lighting bonfires on 5&nbsp;November 1662 in [[Boston]] suggests, in historian James Sharpe's view, that "an underground tradition of commemorating the Fifth existed".<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=142}}</ref>  In parts of North America it was known as Pope Day, celebrated mainly in colonial [[History of New England|New England]], but also as far south as [[History of Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].  In Boston, founded in 1630 by Puritan settlers led by [[John Winthrop]],<!-- not cited here as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged --> an early celebration was held in 1685, the same year that James II assumed the throne.  Fifty years later<!-- 1735 -->, again in Boston, a local minister wrote "a Great number of people went over to Dorchester neck where at night they made a Great Bonfire and plaid off many fireworks", although the day ended in tragedy when "4 young men coming home in a Canoe were all Drowned."  Ten years later the raucous celebrations were the cause of considerable annoyance to the upper classes and a special Riot Act was passed, to prevent "riotous tumultuous and disorderly assemblies of more than three persons, all or any of them armed with Sticks, Clubs or and kind of weapons, or disguised with vizards, or painted or discolored faces, on in any manner disgused, having any kind of imagery or pageantry, in any street, lane, or place in Boston."  With inadequate resources, however, Boston's authorities were powerless to enforce the Act.  In the 1740s gang violence became common, with groups of Boston residents battling for the honour of burning the pope's effigy.  By the mid-1760s the riots had subsided, and as colonial America moved towards [[American Revolution|revolution]], the class rivalries featured during Pope Day gave way to anti-British sentiment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tager|2001|pp=45<U+2013>50}}</ref>

The passage in 1774 of the [[Quebec Act]], which guaranteed French Canadians free practice of Catholicism in the [[Province of Quebec (1763<U+2013>1791)|Province of Quebec]], provoked complaints from some Americans that the British were introducing "Popish principles and French law" to Quebec.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaufman|2009|p=99}}</ref>  These fears were bolstered by the opposition from the Church in Europe to American independence, threatening a revival of Pope Day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fuchs|1990|p=36}}</ref>  Commenting in 1775, [[George Washington]] was less than impressed by the thought of any such resurrections, forbidding any under his command from participating:<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=145}}</ref>

{{Imagequote2| As the Commander in Chief has been apprized of a design form'd for the observance of that ridiculous and childish custom of burning the Effigy of the pope<U+2014>He cannot help expressing his surprise that there should be Officers and Soldiers in this army so void of common sense, as not to see the impropriety of such a step at this Juncture; at a Time when we are solliciting, and have really obtain'd, the friendship and alliance of the people of Canada, whom we ought to consider as Brethren embarked in the same Cause. The defence of the general Liberty of America: At such a juncture, and in such Circumstances, to be insulting their Religion, is so monstrous, as not to be suffered or excused; indeed instead of offering the most remote insult, it is our duty to address public thanks to these our Brethren, as to them we are so much indebted for every late happy Success over the common Enemy in Canada.<ref>{{Citation | editor = John C.

Generally, following Washington's complaint, American colonists stopped observing Pope Day, although according to [[The Bostonian Society]] some citizens of Boston celebrated it on one final occasion, in 1776.<ref>{{Citation | title = George Washington Expresses Surprise | url = http://display.5thofnovember.us/2007/10/george-washington-tries-to-stop.html | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1289322198021170 | publisher = display.5thofnovember.us | archivedate = 9&nbsp;November 2010 | accessdate = 9&nbsp;November 2010}}</ref>  The tradition continued in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] as late as 1817,<ref>{{Harvnb|Berlant|1991|p=232&nbsp;n.58}}, see also {{Citation | last = Robotti | first = Frances Diane | title = Chronicles of Old Salem | publisher = Kessinger Publishing, LLC | year = 2009}}</ref> and was still observed in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], in 1892.<ref>{{Citation | last = Albee | first = John | title = Pope Night in Portsmouth, N.
