'''Conwy Castle''' (formerly anglicised as '''Conway Castle''') is a [[castle]] in [[Conwy]], on the north coast of [[Wales]].  It was built between [[1283]] and [[1289]] as part of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I's]] second campaign in north Wales. Like many of the castles in the area, it was designed by [[James of St. George]], although [[Richard of Chester]] was responsible for the initial stages. The castle is divided into two wards, with the outer ward and inner ward surrounded by four towers each, with [[turret]]s. An estimated [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]15,000 was spent building the castle and the town's defenses.

Conwy superficially resembles a [[concentric castle]], but more accurately it is [[linear castle|linear]]. Like [[Caernarfon Castle]], it is built on a rock outcrop, to reduce the possibility of [[undermining]]. It also takes advantage of other geographical features.

Nearby [[Bodysgallen Hall]] was built in the 13th century as a [[watchtower]] for Conwy Castle to lookout for attack from a northerly exposure not easily watched from Conwy itself.  Some of the stone used in construction of Conwy Castle has been linked to a [[quarry]] at the Bodysgallen property (C.M. Hogan, ''History of Bodysgallen Hall'', July, 2004, Aberdeen Municipal Library Archives, Aberdeen, United Kingdom).  

The castle is a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] and part of the [[World Heritage Site]] "Castles and Town Walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd".
