'''''Oryzomys gorgasi''''', also known as '''Gorgas's Oryzomys'''<ref name=MC1148>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1148</ref> or '''Gorgas's Rice Rat''',<ref name=iucn/> is a [[rodent]] in the genus ''[[Oryzomys]]'' of family [[Cricetidae]]. First collected as a living animal in 1967, it is known from only a few localities, including a freshwater swamp in the lowlands of northwestern [[Colombia]] and a mangrove islet in northwestern [[Venezuela]]. It formerly occurred on the island of [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]] off northwestern Venezuela; this extinct population has been described as a separate species, ''Oryzomys curasoae'', but does not differ [[morphology (anatomy)|morphologically]] from mainland populations.

''Oryzomys gorgasi'' is a medium-sized, brownish species with large, [[semiaquatic]]ally specialized feet. It differs from other ''Oryzomys'' species in several features of its skull. Its diet includes [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, and plant material, and parasitic [[nematode]]s infect it. The species is listed as "Endangered" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] due to destruction of its habitat and competition with the introduced [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus'').

==Taxonomy==
''Oryzomys gorgasi'' was first found in [[Antioquia Department]] of northwestern Colombia in 1967 during an expedition by the [[U.S. Army Medical Department]] and the [[Gorgas Memorial Laboratory]]. In 1971, [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]] zoologist [[Philip Hershkovitz]] described a new species, ''Oryzomys gorgasi'', on the basis of the single known specimen, an old male. He named the animal after physician [[William Crawford Gorgas]], the namesake of the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory.<ref name=H700>Hershkovitz, 1971, p.&nbsp;700</ref> Hershkovitz considered the new species most closely related to ''Oryzomys palustris'', which at the time included North and Central American populations now divided into several species, including the [[marsh rice rat]]  (''O.&nbsp;palustris'') and ''[[Oryzomys couesi|O.&nbsp;couesi]]''.<ref>Hershkovitz, 1971, p.&nbsp;707; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;116</ref> The species was not recorded again until 2001, when Venezuelan zoologist J. S<U+00E1>nchez H. and coworkers reported on 11 specimens collected in coastal northwestern Venezuela in 1992, 700&nbsp;km (400&nbsp;mi) from the Colombian locality.<ref name=Sea206>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;206</ref> They confirmed that ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' is a distinct species related to the ''O.&nbsp;palustris'' group.<ref name=Sea210>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;210</ref>

In 2001, Donald McFarlane and Adolphe Debrot described a new ''Oryzomys'' species from the [[Netherlands Antilles|Netherlands Antillean]] island of [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]] off northwestern Venezuela. For their description, they used [[subfossil]] material from [[pellet (ornithology)|owl pellets]], including two partial [[skull]]s and several hemi[[mandible]]s. They referred the species to ''[[Oecomys]]'',<ref name=McFD184>McFarlane and Debrot, 2001, p.&nbsp;184</ref> a group of [[arboreal]] (tree-living), mainly South American rodents related to ''Oryzomys''.<ref>Weksler, 2006</ref> ''O.&nbsp;curasoae'' has also been known as the "Cura<U+00E7>ao Rice Rat"<ref name=L08>Lamoreux, 2008</ref> and the "Cura<U+00E7>ao Oryzomys".<ref name=MC1148/>

Marcelo Weksler and colleagues removed most of the species then placed in ''Oryzomys'' from the genus in 2006, retaining only the marsh rice rat and related species, including ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi''. They also kept ''O.&nbsp;curasoae'' in the genus and suggested that it may not be distinct from ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi''.<ref name=Wt1e>Weksler et al., 2006, table 1, footnote e</ref> In a 2009 paper, R.S. Voss and Weksler examined the two and concluded that they represented the same species on the basis of direct comparisons and a [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] analysis.<ref name=VW78>Voss and Weksler, 2009, p.&nbsp;78</ref> The resultant [[phylogenetic tree|tree]] placed ''O.&nbsp;curasoae'' and ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' sister to each other and closer to ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' than to the marsh rice rat.<ref name=WVf1>Voss and Weksler, 2009, fig.&nbsp;1</ref> Accordingly, they placed ''O.&nbsp;curasoae'' as a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier described ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi''.<ref name=VW73>Voss and Weksler, 2009, p.&nbsp;73</ref>

''Oryzomys gorgasi'' is the southeasternmost representative of the genus ''Oryzomys'', which extends north into the eastern [[List of mammals of the United States|United States]] (marsh rice rat, ''O.&nbsp;palustris'').<ref name=CAC106>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;106</ref> ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' is further part of the ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' section, which is centered around the widespread Central American ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions.<ref name=CAC117>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;117</ref> Many aspects of the [[systematics]] of the ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group.<ref name=CAC107>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;107</ref> ''Oryzomys'' is classified in the tribe [[Oryzomyini]], a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species,<ref name=W3>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;3</ref> and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily [[Sigmodontinae]] of family [[Cricetidae]], along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.<ref name=MC05>Musser and Carleton, 2005</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Oryzomys palustris in vegetation.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A rat, grayish above and pale below, seen from above and from the front, among reed and leaf litter.|The [[marsh rice rat]] (''Oryzomys palustris'') is closely similar to ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi''.<ref name=Sea208>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;208</ref>]]
''Oryzomys gorgasi'' is a medium-sized [[Oryzomyini|oryzomyine]]<ref name=H701>Hershkovitz, 1971, p. 701</ref> with small ears and large feet,<ref name=H702>Hershkovitz, 1971, p.&nbsp;702</ref> and is similar to the marsh rice rat in general appearance.<ref name=Sea208/> The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below.<ref name=H702/> At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other ''Oryzomys'', the hindfeet exhibit specializations for [[semiaquatic|life in the water]]. The plantar (lower) surface of the [[metatarsus]] is naked. Two of the [[Paw#Common characteristics|pads]] are very small. [[Ungual tuft]]s, tufts of hair at the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. [[Interdigital webbing]] is present, but extends along less than half of the first [[phalange]]s.<ref name=Sea208/>

In specimens from El Caimito, total length is 220 to 290&nbsp;mm (8.7 to 11&nbsp;in), averaging 259&nbsp;mm (10.2&nbsp;in) (measured in 6 specimens); tail length is 116 to 138&nbsp;mm (4.6 to 5.4&nbsp;in), averaging 130&nbsp;mm (5.1&nbsp;in) (measured in 8 specimens); hindfoot length is 30 to 32&nbsp;mm (1.18 to 1.26&nbsp;in), averaging 31&nbsp;mm (1.22&nbsp;in) (measured in 10 specimens); ear length is 15 to 17&nbsp;mm (0.59 to 0.67&nbsp;in), averaging 16&nbsp;mm (0.63&nbsp;in) (measured in 7 specimens); and [[condylo-incisive length]] (a measure of total skull size) is 26.9 to 31.4&nbsp;mm (1.06 to 1.24&nbsp;in), averaging 29.6&nbsp;mm (1.17&nbsp;in) (measured in 5 specimens). In the [[holotype]] from Colombia, an old male, total length is 240&nbsp;mm (9.4&nbsp;in); tail length is 125&nbsp;mm (4.9&nbsp;in); ear length is 19&nbsp;mm (0.75&nbsp;in); and condylo-incisive length is 32.1&nbsp;mm (1.26&nbsp;in).<ref name=Seat1>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, table&nbsp;1</ref> The collector recorded the holotype's hindfoot as being 34&nbsp;mm (1.34&nbsp;in) long, but S<U+00E1>nchez and colleagues remeasured it as 33&nbsp;mm (1.30&nbsp;in).<ref name=Sea207>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;207</ref>

The rostrum (front part of the [[skull]]) is short. The broad [[zygomatic plate]] develops a prominent notch, but not a spine, on its front end, and its back margin is in front of the first molars. The [[interorbital region]], located between the eyes, is narrowest towards the front and is flanked by beadings along its margins. The [[interparietal bone]] is relatively long. The [[incisive foramen|incisive foramina]], perforations of the [[palate]] between the [[incisor]]s and the [[molar (tooth)|molars]], are narrow and long and taper towards the end. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the molars, and includes prominent [[posterolateral palatal pits]] near the third molars, which are excavated into deep [[wikt:fossa|fossae]]. The roof of the [[mesopterygoid fossa]], the opening behind the palate, is not perforated by [[sphenopalatine vacuities]]. ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' lacks an [[alisphenoid strut]]; in some other oryzomyines, this extension of the [[alisphenoid bone]] separates two openings in the skull, the [[masticatory<U+2013>buccinator foramen]] and the [[foramen ovale accessorius]]. The [[squamosal bone]] lacks a suspensory process that contacts the [[tegmen tympani]], the roof of the [[tympanic cavity]],<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, pp.&nbsp;208-209; Voss and Weksler, 2009, p.&nbsp;75</ref> a defining character of oryzomyines.<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;40</ref> The [[subsquamosal fenestra]], an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is almost absent.<ref name=Sea209>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;209</ref>

In the [[mandible]] (lower jaw), the upper and lower [[masseteric ridge]]s come close together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The back end of the lower incisor root is in a [[capsular process]], a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are [[opisthodont]], with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are [[brachydont]] (low-crowned) and [[bunodont]] (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They are similar to those of the marsh rice rat in structural details. The upper and lower first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;209; Voss and Weksler, 2009, pp.&nbsp;75, 77</ref>

''Oryzomys gorgasi'' is distinguished from other ''Oryzomys'' species by its short rostrum, the form of its incisive foramina, the absence of sphenopalatine vacuities, and the near absence of a subsquamosal fenestra.<ref name=Sea210/> Within the species, the Colombian specimen differs from the Venezuelan animals in being larger in some measurements, but having smaller teeth, and in having oddly shaped wear facets of the incisors. The Colombian animal was probably kept in captivity for some time after it was caught, which would explain its large size and odd wear facets.<ref name=Sea208/> There are no substantial differences between mainland ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' and material from Cura<U+00E7>ao.<ref name=VW77>Voss and Weksler, 2009, p.&nbsp;77</ref>

==Distribution and ecology==
As far as known, ''Oryzomys gorgasi'' has a disjunct distribution in northwestern South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, and Cura<U+00E7>ao.<ref>Voss and Weksler, 2009, pp.&nbsp;74, 78</ref> In a 2009 paper, Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales speculated that its distribution may extend into Central America.<ref>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;113</ref> The Colombian population is known from the holotype only, caught at [[Loma Teguerre]] (7<U+00B0>54'N, 77<U+00B0>W) in Antioquia Department, northwestern Colombia, near the [[R<U+00ED>o Atrato]], at about 1&nbsp;m above sea level.<ref name=H700/> The location is apparently a freshwater swamp,<ref name=Sea210/> and Hershkovitz suggested that ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' probably occurred throughout the swamp forests in the R<U+00ED>o Atrato basin.<ref name=H701/> On Cura<U+00E7>ao, it is known from cave faunas at [[Tafelberg Santa Barbara]], Noordkant, Ser'i Kura, and [[Hermanus (Cura<U+00E7>ao)|Hermanus]]. At Tafelberg Santa Barbara, it was found in association with [[introduced species|introduced]] [[black rat]]s (''Rattus rattus''), indicating that the population persisted at least until the first European contact in 1499.<ref name=McFD182>McFarlane and Debrot, 2001, p.&nbsp;182</ref>

In Venezuela, it was found on [[El Caimito]], a small (57&nbsp;ha, 140&nbsp;acres) islet just east of the outlet of [[Lake Maracaibo]] in the state of [[Zulia]],<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;210; Voss and Weksler, 2009, p.&nbsp;74</ref> where the only other native non-flying mammal is the [[opossum]] ''[[Marmosa robinsoni]]''.<ref name=Sea211>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;211</ref> El Caimito is separated from the mainland by a narrow, brackish channel and contains sand banks with [[xerophytic]] vegetation surrounded by marshy lagoons with ''[[Rhizospora mangle]]'' [[mangrove]]s.<ref name=Sea210/> ''Oryzomys gorgasi'' was caught in all habitats on the islet, but has not been found in other similar sites in northwestern Venezuela, where the introduced black rat is the only rodent collected. Analysis of [[stomach]] contents of El Caimito specimens indicates that the species is an [[omnivore]], with a diet including [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, plant [[seed]]s, and other plant material. The crustaceans may include [[fiddler crab]]s (''Uca'') and a mangrove tree crab of the genus ''[[Aratus pisonii|Aratus]]''; the insects include [[fly|flies]] (Diptera); and the plants include [[grass]] seeds. Two [[parasitic worm|parasitic]] [[nematode]]s, ''[[Litomosoides sigmodontis]]''<!--erroneously spelled ''sygmodontis'' in the source--> (family [[Onchocercidae]]) and an undetermined species of ''[[Pterygodermatites]]'' (family [[Rictulariidae]]), are known to infect ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi''.<ref name=Sea211/> The 2009 [[IUCN Red List]] tersely indicates that the species has been found in second Venezuelan locality.<ref name=iucn/>

==Conservation status==
On the 2009 IUCN Red List, ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' is currently listed as "endangered"<ref name=iucn/> and ''O.&nbsp;curasoae'' as "extinct".<ref name=L08/> The species may be threatened by [[interspecific competition|competition]] with introduced black rats<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;211; Ochoa et al., 2008</ref> and [[habitat destruction|destruction of its habitat]],<ref name=Sea205>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;205</ref> but does occur in at least one [[protected area]]. Displacement by the black rat has caused the species to become locally extinct in parts of its Venezuelan range.<ref name=iucn/> Suitable habitats for ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' exist in inland Venezuela, and further study is needed to determine whether it is present there.<ref name=Sea211/> The extinction of the Cura<U+00E7>ao population may also have been caused by competition with the black rat, which has been found together with ''Oryzomys'' in subfossil deposits.<ref name=VW78/>
