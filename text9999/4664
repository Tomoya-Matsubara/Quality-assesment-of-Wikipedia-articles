"'''A Night of Neglect'''" is the seventeenth episode of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] of the American musical television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and the 39th episode overall. It was written by [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]], directed by Carol Banker, and aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on April 19, 2011. It features the McKinley High [[glee club]], New Directions, fundraising for a fellow [[extracurricular activity]] group by holding a benefit concert, while cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) attempts to thwart them.

Thirteen guest stars appeared in the episode, including [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] in her final season two appearance. Several cast members returned after extended absences: [[Jessalyn Gilsig]], [[Cheyenne Jackson]] and [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as members of Sue's anti-New Directions "League of Doom", and [[Charice]] as student [[Sunshine Corazon]]. Four songs were [[Cover version|covered]] and released as singles, and a fifth featured as a dance performance.

Upon its initial airing, the episode was viewed by 9.80&nbsp;million American viewers, and garnered a 3.8/11 [[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|Nielsen rating/share]] in the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|18<U+2013>49 demographic]]. Critical commentary was mixed to negative. Reviewers generally disliked the storyline centered on the under-appreciation of student [[Mercedes Jones]] ([[Amber Riley]]), though commended her performance of [[Arethra Franklin]]'s "[[Ain't No Way]]". The episode's comedy moments attracted some praise, though the guest stars and League of Doom plot were ill-received, as was the cutting short of a solo by [[Jenna Ushkowitz]], and a rendition of [[Adele (singer)|Adele]]'s "[[Turning Tables]]" by Paltrow, which critics found inferior to the original.

==Plot==
[[File:Heather Morris by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The intellectual skills of Brittany (Heather Morris, ''pictured'') are highlighted in this episode.]]
Low on funds for an upcoming competition trip, glee club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) suggests that the club members sell saltwater taffy to raise money. New Directions members [[Mike Chang]] ([[Harry Shum, Jr.]]), [[Artie Abrams]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) and [[Tina Cohen-Chang]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]) reveal they are on the academic decathlon team, which is also having funding problems. [[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris]]) is the fourth, stand-in member, and proves surprisingly knowledgeable about cat diseases. Will's girlfriend, substitute teacher [[Holly Holliday]] ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]), suggests holding a benefit concert for the decathlon team instead of selling additional taffy. Former McKinley student [[Sunshine Corazon]] ([[Charice]]), who defected to rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, is awarded the closing number at the concert after promising to bring her six hundred [[Twitter]] followers.

Cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) creates a "League of Doom"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/playblog/2011/04/sue-sylvesters-league-of-doom-created-in-new-glee-episode-video/|title=Sue Sylvester<U+2019>s "League of Doom" Created in New "Glee" Episode (Video)|date=April 15, 2011|first=Michael C.|last=Gioia|work=[[Playbill]]|publisher=Philip S Birsh|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref> to destroy the glee club, including Will's ex-wife [[Terri Schuester]] ([[Jessalyn Gilsig]]), Vocal Adrenaline coach [[Dustin Goolsby]] ([[Cheyenne Jackson]]), and former McKinley High teacher [[Sandy Ryerson]] ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]). Tasked with breaking up Will and Holly, Dustin makes a failed attempt at seducing her. The targeted relationship begins to crumble anyway, when Will helps his former love [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]) with her stress-worsened [[OCD]], after she reveals that her husband [[Carl Howell]] ([[John Stamos]]) has asked for an annulment.

Former New Directions member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) attends the concert, accompanied his boyfriend [[Blaine Anderson]] ([[Darren Criss]]). They are confronted by closeted homophobic bully [[Dave Karofsky]] ([[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]]), who is forced to back down by [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]), in retribution for previously throwing a [[Slush (beverage)|slushie]] in her face. Sunshine and her followers pull out of the concert on Dustin's orders, and Sandy and McKinley students [[Jacob Ben Israel]] ([[Josh Sussman]]), Azimio (James Earl) and [[Becky Jackson]] ([[Lauren Potter]])<U+2014>the only other members of the audience<U+2014>heckle the glee club. Tina is reduced to tears by their booing; Mike does better as the hecklers are given taffy to keep their mouths full. During the intermission, Holly talks with the three students about the hidden cost of insults and suggests they cheer instead of jeer, but they opt to leave instead. Holly performs Adele's "[[Turning Tables]]" to Will. [[Mercedes Jones]] ([[Amber Riley]]), who has spent the lead-up to the concert making outrageous demands on her fellow club members to gain greater respect from them, performs the final number. She wows a stoned Sandy, who donates some of his drug profits to fund the academic decathlon team.

Holly takes a job in [[Cleveland]], leaving Will free to pursue Emma, while Sue decides to bring Terri into the game. The episode ends on the academic decathlon final's tiebreaker question, which is in the category "[[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|hermaphrodite Nazi sympathizers]]", a topic earlier taught in an irreverent history lesson by Holly.

===Critical response===
"A Night of Neglect" received mixed to negative reviews. Erica Futterman of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' deemed it a "very predictable episode", which neglected to take risks with its musical numbers and left her with a "stale feeling".<ref name="RS">{{Cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/glee-recap-the-long-awaited-utterly-predictable-night-of-neglect-20110420|title={{-'}}Glee Recap: 'A Night of Neglect'|date=April 20, 2011|first=Erica|last=Futterman|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Wenner Media]]|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> Sandra Gonzalez of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was confused by the message presented.

For example, the show doesn't address the fact that the three cast members selected for solos on "The Night of Neglect" were all visible minorities, and what that 'neglect' might mean to the series' racial diversity; addressing this would require subtlety the show can't muster, three-dimensionality these characters lack, and consistency that seems futile at this stage in the series development"

[[CNN]]'s Lisa Respers France said the episode failed to meet her expectations. She was concerned that Mercedes' plot may lead towards the character becoming unlikeable, and criticized Holly's sudden departure. Though she enjoyed Sunshine's return, seeing Kurt and Blaine at McKinley and Mercedes' solo, she noted "all of those moments were fleeting and only contributed to the uneven feel of the show."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/20/it-was-a-night-of-neglect-on-glee/|title=It was a night of neglect on 'Glee'|first=Lisa|last=Respers France|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref> Amy Reiter of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it a "quirky mixed bag, packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional (or musical) oomph.".<ref name="AR">{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/04/glee-recap-no-more-neglect-but-a-lot-of-heckling.html?cid=6a00d8341c630a53ef014e611598fb970c|title='Glee' recap: No more neglect (but a lot of heckling)|first=Amy|last=Reiter|date=April 20, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref> Myles McNutt of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' graded the episode "C". He suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of the show: the under-use of its supporting cast members, and the "maniacal behavior" of Sue. McNutt wrote, "not only was the execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst, but the growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary. This episode was not a step in the right direction so much as it was an escalator to nowhere: A week from now, the chances of any of this resonating in the show itself is slim to none." He felt that Mercedes has become a prop, rather than a character, and criticized the episode for attributing her blame for the marginalization the writers have subjected her to.<ref name="MM">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/a-night-of-neglect,54700/|title="A Night Of Neglect"|first=Myles|last=McNutt|work=[[The A.V.

[[MTV]]'s Aly Semigran enjoyed the comedy and conclusion of Holly's plot, in what she deemed a "pretty decent" episode, though found Charice's appearance extraneous.<ref name="AS"/> [[IGN]]'s Robert Canning gave "A Night of Neglect" 8.5/10, and called it "a bright and funny installment". He too praised the comedy storylines, particularly the League of Doom plot and the academic decathalon scenes, as: "it's this type of off-topic shenanigans (read: not about fitting in or [[Rachel Berry]] becoming a star) that breathes refreshing life into ''Glee'' and keeps reminding us how funny and entertaining this series can be." He was less impressed with the benefit concert, which he felt harmed the episode's pacing, and as with Gonzalez, found the nature of Mercedes' storyline repetitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/116/1162908p1.html|title=Glee: "A Night of Neglect" Review|first=Robert|last=Canning|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref>

Musical performance in the episode, which ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'s}} Emily Exton observed failed to fit the "neglected" criteria,<ref name="EE"/> also attracted mixed reviews.

Critics disapproved of the continuing trend for cutting short Tina's solos. Gonzalez gave her rendition of "I Follow Rivers" a "B" and commented: "Will Tina ever get to finish a song?

Holly's performance of "Turning Tables" was considered inferior to the original. Futterman named it her least-favorite of Paltrow's covers to date and said that her vocals "lacked the texture that made Adele's version so heartbreaking."<ref name="RS"/> Gonzalez gave it her lowest grade of the episode, a "B<U+2013>",<ref name="EW"/> and Semigran opined that while Paltrow is "a nice enough singer," she "in no way has the chops" the song requires.<ref name="AS"/> While Flandez called it a "scene-stealing turn" and commended it visually and vocally, he noted that Paltrow lacks Adele's veracity.<ref name="RF"/> 

Mercedes' "Ain't No Way" was named the best performance of the episode by both Futterman, who enjoyed her "powerhouse vocals",<ref name="RS"/> and the ''[[New York Post]]''{{'s}} Jarett Wieselman, who called it "unbelievable", and praised the focus placed on Mercedes following a season which failed to showcase her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/encore_of_the_week_amber_riley_N9NVjYknmwXdRJgt9hnw1O|title=Encore of The Week: Amber Riley|first=Jarett|last=Wieselman|work=[[New York Post]]|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref> Flandez described the number as being "glamorously sung like [the] star she is", and hoped that she would be better used in future.<ref name="RF"/> In contrast, Reiter called it "a restrained rendition", but "prettily sung nonetheless",<ref name="AR"/> and Gonzalez struggled to connect with the "uncharacteristically average" song, though noted that for Mercedes that is "still 10 times better than a normal person" and awarded it a "B+".<ref name="EW"/>
