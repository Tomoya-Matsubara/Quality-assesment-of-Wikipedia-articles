'''Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein''' ({{Lang-ar|<U+0643><U+0645><U+0627><U+0644> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062F><U+064A><U+0646> <U+062D><U+0633><U+064A><U+0646>}}) (20 December 1874 <U+2013> 6 August 1932) was the son of [[Sultan of Egypt|Sultan]] [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] of [[Egypt]].

==Renunciation of succession rights==
Several otherwise reliable sources mistakenly assert that Kamal el Dine Hussein held the position of heir during his father's three-year reign.<ref>{{cite journal |date=27 December 1914|title=New Ruler of Egypt Is a Dancing Sultan |journal=[[The New York Times]] |pages=SM6 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B02E0D7153FE233A25754C2A9649D946596D6CF |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=2009-08-09 |quote=Sultan Hussein's son, Kemal Eddine, now becomes Crown Prince and next heir to the throne.}}</ref> In reality, Hussein Kamel had agreed with the British government upon his ascension to the throne to postpone the establishment of new rules of succession for the sultanate, meaning that the position of heir to the throne remained vacant. The succession issue was discussed between Hussein Kamel and British High Commissioner [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]] in May 1915 in the wake of the failed assassination attempt against the sultan. Hussein Kamel preferred to be succeeded by his son Kamal el Dine, but also recommended his half-brother [[Fuad I of Egypt|Ahmed Fouad]] and his cousin [[Prince Youssef Kamal|Youssef Kamal]] in case Kamal el Dine was unwilling to assume the position of heir.<ref name="Rizk">{{cite journal |last=Rizk |first=Yunan Labib |title=<U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0643><U+0627><U+0646><U+0629> <U+0628><U+064A><U+0646> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0627><U+062D><U+062A><U+0644><U+0627><U+0644> <U+0648><U+0627><U+0644><U+062D><U+0645><U+0627><U+064A><U+0629> |trans_title=Status Between the Occupation and the Protectorate |journal=AlMussawar |publisher=Egypt State Information Service |url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/Ar/egyptparl/intro/190100000000000009.htm |language=Arabic |format=Reprint |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> For his part, Kamal el Dine wrote a letter to his father in which he expressly and voluntarily renounced the succession.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Montgomery-Massingberd |editor-first=Hugh |editor-link=Hugh Massingberd |title=Burke's Royal Families of the World |volume=Volume II: Africa & the Middle East |year=1980 |publisher=Burke's Peerage |location=London |isbn=9780850110296 |oclc=18496936 |page=25 |chapter=The Royal House of Egypt |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=bnsUAQAAIAAJ&q=renounced+succession#search_anchor |format=snippet view |accessdate=2009-08-16 |quote=His childless only son renounced the succession, which passed to his half-brother Fuad}}</ref> This was the only time in Egyptian history that an eligible heir gave up his rights to the throne of his own free will.<ref name="Rizk"/>

On 21 September 1917, three weeks before Hussein Kamel's death, the British chose Ahmed Fouad as his successor. However, they first requested that Kamal el Dine make a formal renunciation of the throne, in order for the United Kingdom not to appear in the eyes of the Egyptian public as having deprived him of his legitimate rights. Although there were rumours that Kamel el Dine had declined the succession under the influence of his wife Nimet Allah (who did not recognize the legitimacy of her brother [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas Hilmi II]]'s dethronement), most historians explain his decision by his unwillingness to reign under a British protectorate which he strongly opposed.<ref name="Rizk"/> Others give more mundane reasons, pointing out that the prince asked to be relieved of responsibility in order to be able to pursue an exciting life of discovery and travel.<ref>{{cite journal |last=El-Hebeishy |first=Mohamed |date=4 <U+2013> 10 May 2006 |title=Into the heart of mystery |journal=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |issue=793 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/793/tr1.htm |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> Kamal el Dine Hussein was indeed an avid explorer, traveler and collector of oriental antiquities and works of art.

A famous reference to Kamal el Dine Hussein occurs in the opening pages of [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]] laureate [[Naguib Mahfouz]]'s novel ''[[Palace Walk]]'' (1956), where one of the protagonists states: "What a fine man Prince Kamal al-Din Husayn is! Do you know what he did? He refused to ascend the throne of his late father so long as the British are in charge."<ref>{{cite book |last=Mahfouz |first=Naguib |authorlink=Naguib Mahfouz |others=trans. William M.
