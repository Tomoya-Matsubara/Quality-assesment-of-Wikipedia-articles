The state capital is [[Kolkata]]. West Bengal encompasses two broad [[natural region]]s: the [[Gangetic Plain]] in the south and the sub-Himalayan and [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] area in the north.

Ancient [[Bengal]] was the site of several major [[janapadas|Vedic kingdoms]]. [[Bengal]] region was part of large Indian empires such as the [[Maurya empire]] (second century BC) and [[Gupta Empire]] (fourth century AD); and part of the regional [[Pala Empire]] (eighth to 11th century) and [[Sena dynasty]] (11th<U+2013>12th century). From the 13th century onward, the region was ruled by several [[Sultanate of Bengal|sultans]], Hindu kings and [[Baro-Bhuyan]] landlords, until the beginning of [[British Raj|British rule]] in the 18th century. The [[British East India Company]] cemented their hold on the region following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, and Calcutta served for many years as the capital of [[British India]]. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in expansion of Western education, culminating in development in science, institutional education, and social reforms of the region, including what became known as the [[Bengal Renaissance]]. A hotbed of the [[Indian independence movement]] through the early 20th century, [[Bengal]] [[1947 Partition of Bengal|was divided]] during India's independence in 1947 along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal<U+2014>a state of India<U+2014>and [[East Bengal]]<U+2014>a part of the newly created [[Pakistan]]<U+2014>later becoming [[Bangladesh]] in 1971.

A major [[Agrarianism|agricultural producer]], West Bengal is the sixth-largest contributor to India's [[net domestic product]].<ref name=rbinsdpstat/> Noted for its [[political activism]], the state was ruled by democratically elected communist government for three decades. West Bengal is noted for its cultural activities and presence of cultural and educational institutions; the state capital Kolkata is known as the "cultural capital of India". The state's cultural heritage, besides varied folk traditions, ranges from stalwarts in literature including Nobel-laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] to scores of musicians, film-makers and artists. West Bengal is also distinct from most other Indian states in its appreciation and practice of playing [[Association Football|Football]] besides the national favourite sport cricket.<ref name="dineo foot">{{cite book|title=Soccer in South Asia: empire, nation, diaspora |year=2001 |publisher= Frank Cass Publishers|location=London |isbn=978-0-7146-8170-2 |page=71 |last=Dineo |first= Paul |last2=Mills |first2= James}}</ref><ref name="bose foot">{{cite book|title=The magic of Indian cricket: cricket and society in India|year=2006 |publisher= Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-35691-6 |page=240 |last=Bose|first= Mihir}}</ref><ref name="das foot">{{cite journal |last= Das Sharma|first=Amitabha |year=2002 |title=Football and the big fight in Kolkata |journal=Football Studies |volume= 5|issue=2 |page=57 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/FootballStudies/2002/FS0502g.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name of the region [[Bengal]] (<big><U+09AC><U+09BE><U+0982><U+09B2><U+09BE></big> ''Bangla'' and <big><U+09AC><U+0999><U+09CD><U+0997></big> ''Bongo'' in [[Bengali language]]) is of unknown origins. One theory suggests that the word derives from "Bang", a [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] tribe that settled the region around 1000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+bd0014%29|title= Bangldesh: early history, 1000&nbsp;B.C.<U+2013>A.D. 1202 |month=September |year=1988 |work= Bangladesh: A country study|publisher=Library of Congress |location= Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2 March 2012|quote=Historians believe that Bengal, the area comprising present-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, was settled in about 1000 B.C. by Dravidian-speaking peoples who were later known as the Bang. Their homeland bore various titles that reflected earlier tribal names, such as Vanga, Banga, Bangala, Bangal, and Bengal.}}</ref> The word might have been derived from the ancient [[Vanga Kingdom|kingdom of ''Vanga'']] (or ''Banga''). Although some early [[Sanskrit literature]] mentions the name, the region's early history is obscure.

At times of [[British Raj|British Rule]] over the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Bengal]] region was [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partitioned in 1947]] along religious lines into east and west. The east came to be known as [[East Bengal]] ''(which later succeeded as an independent nation of [[Bangladesh]])'' and the west came to known as West Bengal which remained as an [[States of India|Indian state]]. In 2011, the [[Government of West Bengal]] proposed a change in the official name for the state to ''Poschimbongo'' ({{lang-bn|<U+09AA><U+09B6><U+09CD><U+099A><U+09BF><U+09AE><U+09AC><U+0999><U+09CD><U+0997>}} ''P<U+00F4>shchimb<U+00F4>ngg<U+00F4>'')<ref>http://promotebangla.blogspot.in/2011/09/paschim-banga-is-new-name-why-not.html#.UffNdtJM-So</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=West Bengal may be renamed PaschimBanga |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2373155.ece |newspaper= [[The Hindu]]|location=Chennai, India|date= 19 August 2011|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> which reflects the native name of the state, literally meaning western Bengal in the native [[Bengali language]].

One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention of a land named [[Gangaridai]] by the [[Ancient Greeks]] around 100 BC. The word is speculated to have come from ''Gangahrd'' (Land with the [[Ganges]] in its heart) in reference to an area in Bengal.<ref name=Gangaridai>{{cite web

Later, occasional Muslim raiders reinforced the process of conversion by building mosques, [[madrassas]] and Sufi [[Khanqah]].

Although he failed to bring Bengal under his control, the expedition managed to defeat [[Lakshman Sen]] and his two sons moved to a place then called [[Munshiganj District|Vikramapur]] (present-day [[Munshiganj District]]), where their diminished dominion lasted until the late 13th century.

[[File:Raja Ram Mohan Roy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]] is widely regarded as the "Father of the [[Bengal Renaissance]]".]]
During the 14th century, the former kingdom became known as the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], ruled intermittently with the [[Sultanate of Delhi]] as well as powerful [[Hindu Rashtra|Hindu states]] and [[Landlord|land-lords]]-[[Baro-Bhuyan]]s. The Hindu [[Deva dynasty|Deva Kingdom]] ruled over eastern Bengal after the collapse [[Sena Empire]]. The [[Sultanate of Bengal]] was interrupted by an uprising by the Hindus under [[Raja Ganesha]]. The Ganesha dynasty began in 1414, but his successors converted to Islam. Bengal came once more under the control of Delhi as the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] conquered it in 1576. There were several independent Hindu states established in Bengal during the [[Mughal period]] like those of [[Pratapaditya|Maharaja Pratap Aditya]] of [[Jessore]] and [[Raja Sitaram Ray]] of [[Burdwan]]. These kingdoms contributed greatly to the economic and cultural landscape of Bengal. Extensive land reclamations in forested and marshy areas were carried out and  trade as well as commerce were highly encouraged. These kingdoms also helped introduce new music, painting, dancing and sculpture into Bengali art-forms as well as many temples were constructed during this period. Militarily, they served as bulwarks against Portuguese and Burmese attacks. [[Koch dynasty|Koch Bihar Kingdom]] in the northern Bengal, flourished during the period of 16th and the 17th centuries as well as weathered the Mughals and survived till the advent of the British.

European traders arrived late in the fifteenth century. Their influence grew until the [[British East India Company]] gained taxation rights in Bengal ''[[subah (province)|subah]]'', or province, following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, when [[Siraj ud-Daulah]], the last independent Nawab, was defeated by the British.<ref name=sirajbanglaped>{{cite web

West Bengal is governed through a [[parliamentary system]] of [[representative democracy]], a feature the state shares with other Indian states. [[Universal suffrage]] is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the [[West Bengal Legislative Assembly]], consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The [[judiciary]] is composed of the [[Calcutta High Court]] and a system of lower courts. [[executive (government)|Executive authority]] is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the [[Chief Minister of West Bengal|Chief Minister]], although the titular head of government is the [[Governor of West Bengal|Governor]]. The Governor is the [[head of state]] appointed by the [[President of India]]. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister.

Several government-owned organisations operate substandard bus services in the state, including the [[Calcutta State Transport Corporation]], the [[North Bengal State Transport Corporation]], the [[South Bengal State Transport Corporation]], the [[West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation]], and the Calcutta Tramways Company, thus leading to mismanagement. There are also private bus companies. The railway system is a nationalised service without any private investment. Hired forms of transport include metered taxis and [[auto rickshaw]]s which often ply specific routes in cities. In most of the state, [[cycle rickshaw]]s, and in Kolkata, [[Pulled rickshaw#India|hand-pulled rickshaws]], are also used for short-distance travel. Large-scale transport accidents in West Bengal are common, particularly the sinking of transport boats and train crashes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11679012 |work=BBC News | title=India ferry disaster kills scores | date=2 November 2010}}</ref>

The [[Bengali language]] boasts a rich literary heritage, shared with neighbouring [[Bangladesh]]. West Bengal has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by the ''[[Charyapada]]'', ''[[Mangalkavya]]'', ''[[Shreekrishna Kirtana]]'', ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'', and stories related to [[Gopal Bhar]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth
century, [[Bengali literature]] was modernised in the works of authors such as [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], [[Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Jibananda Das]] and [[Manik Bandyopadhyay]]. In modern times [[Jibanananda Das]], [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]], [[Tarashankar Bandopadhyay]], [[Manik Bandopadhyay]], [[Ashapurna Devi]], [[Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay]], [[Buddhadeb Guha]], [[Mahashweta Devi]], [[Samaresh Majumdar]], [[Sanjeev Chattopadhyay]] and [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]] among others are well known.

===Music and dance===
[[File:394 baul-singers-sml.jpg|thumb|left|Baul singers at [[Basanta-Utsab]], [[Shantiniketan]]]]

The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bengali folk music, which has also been influenced by regional music traditions.<ref name=baulbengalonline>{{cite web
|url=http://bengalonline.sitemarvel.com/bengali-folklore.asp?art=baul
|title=The Bauls of Bengal|accessdate=26 October 2006|work=Folk Music|publisher=BengalOnline
}}</ref> Other folk music forms include [[Gombhira]] and [[Bhawaiya]]. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], a one-stringed instrument. West Bengal also has a heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]]. "[[Rabindrasangeet]]", songs composed and set into tune by Rabindranath Tagore and "[[List of works of Kazi Nazrul Islam|Nazrul geeti]]" (by Kazi Nazrul Islam) are popular. Also prominent are other musical forms like [[Dwijendralal Ray|Dwijendralal]], [[Atulprasad Sen|Atulprasad]] and [[Rajanikanta Sen|Rajanikanta]]'s songs, and ''"adhunik"'' or modern music from films and other composers. 
[[File:Dance with Rabindra Sangeet - Kolkata 2011-11-05 6669.JPG|thumb|right|Dance with Rabindra From the early 1990s, there has been an emergence of [[Indian rock#Rock scenes|new genres]] of music, including the emergence of what has been called Bengali ''Jeebonmukhi Gaan'' (a modern genre based on realism)..]] Bengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance traditions. [[Chau dance]] of Purulia is a rare form of mask dance.

===Films===
Mainstream [[Bollywood|Hindi films]] are popular in [[Bengal]], and the state is home to a [[Bengali cinema|thriving cinema industry]], dubbed "Tollywood". [[Tollygunj]] in [[Kolkata]] is the location of numerous Bengali movie studios, and the name "Tollywood" (similar to Hollywood and [[Bollywood]]) is derived from that name. The Bengali film industry is well known for its [[art film]]s, and has produced acclaimed directors like [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Mrinal Sen]], [[Tapan Sinha]] and [[Ritwik Ghatak]]. Prominent contemporary directors include veterans like [[Buddhadev Dasgupta]], [[Tarun Majumdar]], [[Goutam Ghose]], [[Aparna Sen]], [[Rituparno Ghosh]] and a newer pool of directors like [[Kaushik Ganguly]] and [[Srijit Mukherji]].

===Fine arts===
Bengal had been the harbinger of modernism in fine arts. [[Abanindranath Tagore]], called the father of Modern Indian Art had started the Bengal School of Art which was to create styles of art outside the European realist tradition which was taught in art colleges under the colonial administration of the British Government. The movement had many adherents like [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Ramkinkar Baij]], [[Jamini Roy]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. After Indian Independence, important groups like the [[Calcutta Group]] and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal which dominated the art scene in India.

===Reformist heritage===
The capital, [[Kolkata]], was the workplace of several social reformers, like [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]], [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]], and [[Swami Vivekananda]]. These social reforms have eventually led to a cultural atmosphere where practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination or untouchability, the evils that crept into the Hindu society, were abolished.The region was also home to several religious teachers, such as [[Chaitanya]], [[Ramakrishna]], [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Prabhupada]] and [[Paramahansa Yogananda]].

|publisher=Aqua KE Government|format=PDF}}</ref> Bengal's vast repertoire of fish-based dishes includes [[hilsa]] preparations, a favourite among Bengalis. There are numerous ways of cooking fish depending on the texture, size, fat content and the bones.  Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. It is an ancient custom among both Hindu and Muslim Bengalis to distribute sweets during festivities. The confectionery industry has flourished because of its close association with social and religious ceremonies. Competition and changing tastes have helped to create many new sweets. Bengalis make distinctive [[confectionary|sweetmeats]] from milk products, including ''[[Rasgulla|R<U+00F4>shogolla]]'', ''Ch<U+00F4>mch<U+00F4>m'', ''Kalojam'' and several kinds of ''[[Sandesh (confectionery)|sondesh]]''. [[Pitha]], a kind of sweet cake, bread or dimsum are specialties of winter season. Sweets like coconut-naru, til-naru, moa, payesh, etc. are prepared during the festival of Lakshmi puja.

The variety of fruits and vegetables that Bengal has to offer is incredible. A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, plantain, broad beans, okra, banana tree stems and flowers, green jackfruit and red pumpkins are to be found in the markets or anaj bazaar as popularly called. ''[[Panta bhat]]'' (rice soaked overnight in water)with onion & green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are [[cumin]], [[ajmoda]] (radhuni), [[bay leaf]], [[Mustard seed|mustard]], [[ginger]], [[Chili pepper|green chillies]], [[turmeric]], etc. People of erstwhile [[East Bengal]] use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut and mustard in their cooking; while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly without onion and garlic.

[[File:Durga Puja celebration.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A ''Murti'' (representation) of [[Durga|Maa Durga]]]]

===Costumes===
Bengali women commonly wear the ''[[sari|sha<U+0157>i]]'', often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear Western attire. Among men, western dressing has greater acceptance. Men also wear traditional costumes such as the ''[[kurta|panjabi]]'' with ''[[dhoti|dhuti]]'', often on cultural occasions.
