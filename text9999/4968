'''Stephen William Hawking''',  {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]]}} (born 8 January 1942) is a British [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and author. His significant scientific works to date have been a collaboration with [[Roger Penrose]] on [[Penrose<U+2013>Hawking singularity theorems|theorems on gravitational singularities]] in the framework of [[general relativity]], and the theoretical prediction that [[black hole]]s should emit radiation, often called [[Hawking radiation]].

He is an [[Honorary Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce|Royal Society of Arts]], a lifetime member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], and a recipient of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian award in the United States. Hawking was the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009. Subsequently, he became research director at the university's Centre for Theoretical Cosmology.

Hawking has achieved success with works of [[popular science]] in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' stayed on the British ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' best-sellers list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking has a [[motor neurone disease]] related to [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], a condition that has progressed over the years. He is now almost entirely paralysed and communicates through a [[speech generating device]]. He married twice and has three children.

== Early life and education ==

Stephen Hawking was born on 8&nbsp;January 1942 to Frank Hawking, a research [[biologist]], and Isobel Hawking.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x<U+2013>xix}} He has two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=3<U+2013>5}} Hawking's parents were living in [[North London]], but moved to [[Oxford]] shortly before his birth, while London was [[the Blitz|under attack]] during the Second World War.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 3}}

In 1950, when his father became head of the division of [[parasitology]] at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]],{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x<U+2013>xix}} Hawking and his family moved to [[St Albans]], Hertfordshire.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 3}}  Hawking attended [[St Albans High School for Girls]] from 1950 to 1953; at that time, boys could attend the girls' school until the age of 10.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=3<U+2013>5}} From the age of 11, he attended [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]], where he was an average, but not exceptional student.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 3}} He maintains his connection with the school, giving his name to one of the four [[House system|houses]] and to an extracurricular science lecture series.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> and originally wanted to study the subject at university. However, Hawking's father wanted him to apply to [[University College, Oxford]], which his father had attended. As University College did not have a mathematics fellow at that time, they did not accept applications from students who wished to study that discipline. Therefore, Hawking applied to study natural sciences with an emphasis in physics. University College accepted Hawking, and he gained a scholarship.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 3}}  While at Oxford, he [[Coxswain (rowing)|coxed]] a rowing team, which helped ease his immense boredom at the university.{{sfn|Hawking|1992|loc=p. 44}} His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said "It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it.&nbsp;... his mind was completely different from all of his contemporaries".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 3}}

Hawking's unimpressive study habits resulted in a final examination score on the borderline between first and second class honours, making an oral examination necessary.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 3}} Berman commented:
"the examiners then were intelligent enough to realize they were talking to someone far more clever than most of themselves".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 3}} After receiving his B.A. degree at Oxford in 1962, he left for graduate work at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 3}}

== Career ==
=== 1962<U+2013>75 ===

Hawking started developing symptoms of [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] upon his arrival at Cambridge. He did not distinguish himself in his first two years at the institution. With the help of his doctoral tutor, [[Dennis William Sciama]], he returned to working on his PhD after the disease had stabilised{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 4}} and graduated with his doctorate in 1966,{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x<U+2013>xix}} before starting a four-year research fellowship at Cambridge.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 4}}

When Hawking began his graduate studies in the 1960s, there was much debate in the physics community about the opposing theories of the creation of the universe: [[big bang]], and [[Steady State theory|steady state]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 4}} Hawking and his Cambridge friend and colleague, [[Roger Penrose]], showed in 1970 that if the universe obeys general relativity and fits any of the [[Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann|Friedmann models]], then it must have [[Penrose<U+2013>Hawking singularity theorems|begun as a singularity]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 6}}  This work showed that, far from being mathematical curiosities which appear only in exceptional circumstances, singularities are a fairly common feature of general relativity.<ref>{{Cite journal

In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created 'Fellowship for Distinction in Science' to remain at Cambridge.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 5}} In the early 1970s, Hawking's work with [[Brandon Carter]], [[Werner Israel]] and D. Robinson strongly supported [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]]'s [[no-hair theorem]]&nbsp;<U+2013> that any black hole can be fully described by the three properties of mass, [[angular momentum]], and [[electric charge]].{{sfn|Hawking|Israel|1989|loc=p. 278}} With Bardeen and Carter, he proposed the four [[laws of black hole mechanics]], drawing an analogy with [[thermodynamics]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=38}} In 1974, he calculated that black holes should emit [[radiation]], known today as [[Hawking radiation|Hawking or Bekenstein<U+2013>Hawking radiation]], until they exhaust their energy and [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporate]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 6}}

Hawking was elected one of the youngest Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] in 1974,{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=44}} and in the same year he accepted the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) to work with his friend on the faculty, [[Kip Thorne]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 7}} He continues to maintain ties to Caltech, having spent a month each year there since 1992.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 8}}

The mid to late 1970s were a period of growing popularity and success for Hawking. His work was now much talked about; he was appearing in television documentaries, and in 1979 he became the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the University of Cambridge, a position he held for 30 years until his retirement in 2009.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 8}}<ref>{{cite news

In collaboration with [[James Hartle|Jim Hartle]], Hawking developed a model in which the [[universe]] had no boundary in space-time, replacing the initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there&nbsp;<U+2013> it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end.{{sfn|Baird|2007|loc=p. 234}} While initially the no-boundary proposal predicted a [[Shape of the Universe|closed universe]], discussions with [[Neil Turok]] led to the realisation that it is also compatible with an open universe.{{sfn|Yulsman|2003|loc=pp.&nbsp;174<U+2013>176}} Later work by Hawking appeared to show that, if this no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards (Hawking famously used the example of broken teacups reassembling).{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 14}} However, work by [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]], a former student of Hawking, led to Hawking withdrawing this concept.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 14}}

Along with Thomas Hertog at [[CERN]], in 2006 Hawking proposed a theory of "top-down cosmology", which says that the universe had no unique initial state, therefore, it is inappropriate for physicists to attempt to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state.<ref>{{cite web

Since this contradicted  the [[quantum mechanics]] of microcausality, quantum mechanics would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.<ref>

</ref> The winner of the bet was to receive an encyclopedia of the loser's choice, from which information may be accessed.<ref name="concedbet" />

In 2004, Hawking announced that he was conceding the bet because he now believed that black hole horizons should [[quantum fluctuation|fluctuate]] and leak information, and gave Preskill a copy of ''[[Total Baseball]]''.  Comparing the useless information obtainable from a black hole to "burning an encyclopedia", Hawking commented, "I gave John an encyclopedia of baseball, but maybe I should just have given him the ashes".<ref name="concedbet" />

== Personal life ==
According to Hawking, when he was diagnosed with ALS during an early stage of his graduate work, he did not see much point in obtaining a doctorate, since he expected to die soon after. Hawking later said that the real turning point was his 1965 marriage to Jane Wilde, a language student.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|loc=Chapter 3}} Jane cared for him until 1990 when the couple separated.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x<U+2013>xix}} They had three children: Robert, [[Lucy Hawking|Lucy]], and Timothy.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x<U+2013>xix}} Hawking married his [[personal care assistant]], Elaine Mason, in 1995;{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x<U+2013>xix}} the couple divorced In October 2006<ref>{{cite news

Hawking has a [[motor neurone disease]] that is related to [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), a condition that has progressed over the years. As of 2012, he is almost completely paralysed and communicates through a [[speech generating device]]. Hawking's illness has progressed more slowly than typical cases of ALS: survival for more than 10 years after diagnosis is uncommon.{{sfn|Mitsumoto|Munsat|2001|loc=p. 36}}<ref>{{cite web

Symptoms of the disorder first appeared while he was enrolled at the University of Cambridge, when he lost his balance and fell down a flight of stairs, hitting his head.{{sfn|Hawking|1992|loc=p. 44}}  The diagnosis of motor neurone disease came when Hawking was 21, shortly before his first marriage, and doctors said he would not survive more than two or three years.  By 1974, he was unable to feed himself or get out of bed. His speech became slurred so that he could be understood only by people who knew him well. During a visit to CERN in Geneva in 1985, Hawking contracted [[pneumonia]], which in his condition was life-threatening as it further restricted his already limited respiratory capacity. He had an emergency [[tracheotomy]], losing what remained of his ability to speak.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=72<U+2013>81}} A [[speech generating device]] was built in Cambridge, using software from an American company, that enabled Hawking to operate a computer keyboard with small movements of his body, and then have a [[voice synthesiser]] speak what he typed.<ref name="als" />

The particular [[speech generating device|voice synthesiser]] hardware he uses, which has an American English accent, is no longer being produced. Asked why he has still kept the same voice after so many years, Hawking stated that he has not heard a voice he likes better and that he identifies with it even though the synthesiser is both large and fragile by current standards.  For lectures and media appearances, Hawking appears to speak fluently through his synthesiser, but when he prepares answers, his system produces words at a rate of about one per minute.<ref name="tech">{{cite news

The real challenge is to work out what aliens might actually be like".<ref name="alien" /> He believes alien life not only certainly exists on planets but perhaps even in other places, like within stars or even floating in outer space. He has also warned that a few of these species might be intelligent and threaten Earth:<ref>

At Google's [[Zeitgeist]] Conference in 2011, Hawking said that "philosophy is dead." He believes philosophers "have not kept up with modern developments in science" and that scientists "have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge." He said that [[List of unsolved problems in philosophy|philosophical problems]] can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which "lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it".<ref>{{cite news

A collection of essays titled ''[[Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays|Black Holes and Baby Universes]]'' (1993) was also popular. His book, ''[[A Briefer History of Time (Hawking and Mlodinow book)|A Briefer History of Time]]'' (2005), co-written by [[Leonard Mlodinow]], updated his earlier works to make them accessible to a wider audience. In 2007 Hawking and his daughter, [[Lucy Hawking]], published ''[[George's Secret Key to the Universe]]'', a children's book focusing on science that Lucy Hawking described as "a bit like Harry Potter but without the magic."<ref>{{cite news
