'''<U+00C6>thelwig''' (d. 16 February in either 1077 or 1078) was an [[Abbot of Evesham]] in and around the time of the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. Born sometime around 1010 or 1015, he was elected abbot in 1058. Known for his legal expertise, he administered estates for [[Ealdred (archbishop)|Ealdred]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]] prior to his election as abbot. After his election, he appears to have acted as Ealdred's deputy, and was considered as a possible sucessor when Ealdred was elected [[Archbishop of York]]. <U+00C6>thelwig worked during his abbacy to recover estates that had been lost to Evesham, as well as acquiring more estates.

After the Norman Conquest, in 1066, <U+00C6>thelwig was one of the few Englishmen trusted by the new King [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], and was given authority over parts of western England. As part of his duties, he was a royal judge and held important prisoners. During the [[Harrying of the North]] in 1069-1070, <U+00C6>thelwig  gave aid to refugees from the north of England. He also helped the king in the [[Revolt of the Earls|rebellion of 1075]], preventing one of the rebels from joining the others. <U+00C6>thelwig died on 16 February in either 1077 or 1078, and was memorialized in a work on his life that was later incorporated in the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham]]'', a 13th century history of the abbey and its abbots.

==Early life and election as abbot==

He was probably born about 1010 to 1015,<ref name=Monastic74n>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 74 footnote 4</ref> and inherited a large amount of land from his family.<ref name=Monastic423>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 423</ref> He served as an administrator of the estates of Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester, as well as those of [[Evesham Abbey]]. <U+00C6>thelwig  was also known as a legal expert.<ref name=Monastic76>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 76</ref> He was elected abbot in 1058, and was blessed on 23 April 1058,<ref name=Heads47>Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses'' p. 47</ref> by Ealdred, who was the diocesan bishop for Evesham. He replaced the previous abbot, Mannig, who had become paralyzed. One story has it that Ealdred asked King [[Edward the Confessor]] to give the abbacy to <U+00C6>thelwig,<ref name=ChurchA87/> another, in the ''Chronicon de Abbatiae Evesham'', a history of Evesham Abbey, states that it was Mannig who asked the king to make the appointment. The ''Chronicon'' also states that the blessing took place at Gloucester, and that Ealdred was Archbishop at the time, although Ealdred did not become Archbishop of York until 1060.<ref name=Darlington3>Darlington ''<U+00C6>thelwig, Abbot of Evesham Part I" ''English Historical Review'' p. 3</ref> 

During his abbacy, he appears to have acted as the deputy for Ealdred, as bishop of Worcester.<ref name=ChurchA87>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 87 footnote 6</ref> In 1062, he was one of the candidates to succeed Ealdred as bishop, when Ealdred was promoted to [[Archbishop of York]], but [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]] was chosen instead.<ref name=ChurchA92>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 92</ref> <U+00C6>thelwig also served as a judge for King Edward the Confessor, at one point hearing a case at the royal court along with Wulfstan and [[Regenbald]], the chancellor.<ref name=ChurchA129>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 129</ref> The abbot also led military forces in battle,<ref name=Harold80>Walker ''Harold'' p. 80</ref> and served King Edward as an advisor.<ref name=Monastic407>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 407</ref>

<U+00C6>thelwig's relationship with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was acting as the abbot's diocesan bishop, appears to have been tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during <U+00C6>thelwig's abbacy, <U+00C6>thelwig was not there.<ref name=ChurchA323>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 323</ref> Although in legal matters Wulfstan and <U+00C6>thelwig  were in conflict, personally, <U+00C6>thelwig  is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as the abbot's confessor.<ref name=Cox281>Cox "St Oswald" ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' p. 281</ref> The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 in order to gloss over embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of <U+00C6>thelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.<ref name=Cox283>Cox "St Oswald" ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' pp. 283<U+2013>284</ref>

During Edward's reign, <U+00C6>thelwig worked to recover some of the abbey's estates that had been granted to others in the past but had not been returned to the abbey's custody. He managed to restore the abbey's possession of a number of these lost estates.<ref name=Confessor330>Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' p. 330</ref> A large section of the description of the abbot's life in the ''Chronicon'' is concerned with a listing of estates that <U+00C6>thelwig acquired or recovered. The estates listed were in the counties of [[Worcestershire]], [[Warwickshire]], and [[Gloucestershire]].<ref name=Darlington6>Darlington ''<U+00C6>thelwig, Abbot of Evesham Part I" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 6<U+2013>10</ref>

==After the Conquest==

After the Norman Conquest, <U+00C6>thelwig was trusted by the new king, William the Conqueror, and given some administrative duties.<ref name=ChurchB57>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 57</ref> <U+00C6>thelwig was one of a very small number of native Englishmen trusted by the king, which group included Ealdred and Wulfstan.<ref name=Bates156>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 156</ref> Probably in 1069, <U+00C6>thelwig was given authority in the former lands of the [[Mercia|Mercian kingdom]].<ref name=Williams24>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 24</ref> After the deposition of [[Godric of Winchcombe|Godric]], the abbot of [[Winchcombe Abbey]] in 1070, <U+00C6>thelwig served as his jailor.<ref name=Unification105>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 105</ref> In 1072, <U+00C6>thelwig was acting as a royal judge in the western part of England.<ref name=Douglas306>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 306</ref> During the rebellion of 1075, <U+00C6>thelwig kept [[Roger de Breteuil]], the [[Earl of Hereford]], one of the rebels, from joining up with the other rebels. In this action, <U+00C6>thelwig  was assisted by Wulfstan,<ref name=Douglas232>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 232</ref> as well as the sheriff of Worcestershire, [[Urse d'Abetot]].<ref name=Williams60>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 60 footnote 67</ref> <U+00C6>thelwig also took the opportunity after the Norman Conquest to acquire more lands, obtaining 36 estates by redeeming loans.<ref name=Williams10>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 10</ref> <U+00C6>thelwig used his knowledge of English law not only on his own account, but to aid the new Norman ecclesiasitcs, such as [[Lanfranc]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and Serlo, the [[Abbot of Gloucester]].<ref name=Williams144>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 144</ref> A number of English landowners commended themselves into <U+00C6>thelwig's care after the Conquest, and this led to conflicts over who owned the lands after <U+00C6>thelwig's death.<ref name=Williams148>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 148</ref>

Although <U+00C6>thelwig was known for his loyalty to King William, he had an uncle who held land at Witton who died fighting for King [[Harold II of England|Harold Godwinson]], probably at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]].<ref name=Harold158>Walker ''Harold'' p. 158</ref> While abbot, even after the Conquest, <U+00C6>thelwig continued to build and ornament his abbey in the [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon style]], not the Norman [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] which was being used in many of the other churches and abbeys.<ref name=Monastic120>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 120</ref> Besides his administrative and legal duties, <U+00C6>thelwig was known for his care for the sick and the poor, as well as lepers. After the [[Harrying of the North]] by King William in 1069-1070, <U+00C6>thelwig offered shelter to refugees from the ravaged areas.<ref name=Monastic162/> The ''Chronicon'' states that <U+00C6>thelwig offered aid to the refugees because of his charitable nature, but it is possible that it was also part of his royal duties in western England.<ref name=Darlington179>Darlington ''<U+00C6>thelwig, Abbot of Evesham Part II" ''English Historical Review'' p. 179</ref> 

<U+00C6>thelwig also administered Winchcombe Abbey for a number of years,<ref name=Monastic162>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' pp. 162<U+2013>163</ref> at first from 1066 to 1069 when a Norman monk was appointed abbot, and then again from 1075 until <U+00C6>thelwig's death.<ref name=Williams17>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 17 and footnote76</ref> [[Hemming (monk)|Hemming]], a medieval monastic writer from [[Worcester Priory]], wrote of <U+00C6>thelwig that he "surpassed everyone by his intelligence, his shrewdness and his knowledge of worldly law".<ref name=QWilliams148>Quoted in Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 148</ref> The ''Chronicon'' reports that <U+00C6>thelwig suffered from [[gout]], and states that it was the cause of his death.<ref name=Darlington2>Darlington ''<U+00C6>thelwig, Abbot of Evesham Part I" ''English Historical Review'' p. 2</ref>

<U+00C6>thelwig died in either 1077 or 1078.<ref name=Heads47/><ref name=Heads248>Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses'' p. 248</ref> The ''Chronicon'' gives his death date as 16 February 1077,<ref name=Darlington5>Darlington ''<U+00C6>thelwig, Abbot of Evesham Part I" ''English Historical Review'' p. 5</ref> but it is unclear if the ''Chronicon'' began its years on 1 January or in March, so the date could be 1077 or 1078.<ref name=Heads248/>

==Writing about <U+00C6>thelwig==

A near-contemporary account of his life is included in the ''Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham'', the monastic chronicle for Evesham Abbey.<ref name=Monastic704/> This was a 13th century work by [[Thomas of Marlborough]], which was written to bolster the Evesham's case for exemption from the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Worcester, in whose diocese Evensham was. In order to do this, Thomas incorporated earlier works dealing with Evesham's history, including the work on <U+00C6>thelwig. However, because of Thomas' purpose in composing the ''Chronicon'', he probably altered some of the texts he included, and it appears that the life of <U+00C6>thelwig was first incorporated into a complete history of the abbey and then that composit work was adapted by Thomas into his ''Chronicon''. The main evidence for this is internal stylistic evidence, where the <U+00C6>thelwig material is stylistic uniform with other material dating to prior to 1077, with information after 1077 forming a separate writing style.<ref name=Grandsen111>Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 111<U+2013>112</ref>

The historian R. R. Darlington argued that it was written right after <U+00C6>thelwig's death, but another historian, [[David Knowles]], wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, [[Dominic of Evesham|Dominic]].<ref name=Monastic704>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' pp. 704<U+2013>705</ref> [[Antonia Gransden]], another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it more likely to have been written shortly after <U+00C6>thelwig's death.<ref name=Grandsen89>Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 89 and footnote 171</ref> The work itself is not a [[hagiography]], in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to <U+00C6>thelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on <U+00C6>thelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by <U+00C6>thelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.<ref name=Grandsen90>Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref>
