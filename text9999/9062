Rampur is 65&nbsp;km north east from the headquarter city [[Tansen]]. The valley is bounded by [[Syangja District]] in the north, [[Tanahun District]] in the north east and [[Nawalparasi District]] in the east. The popular religious river Kaligandaki disconnects the boundary in northern part.

==Tourism==
[[Kali Gandaki]] river flows through some villages of Rampur such as ''Gaudan, Dhakaldanda, Pyakluk at the edge of Talpokhara ''. Kali Gandaki itself is very famous for rafting. Many tourists visit Rampur each year for rafting. Tourist can go for trekking as Rampur is surrounded by hills on all sides. The view of mountain [[Makalu]] and [[Annapurna]] has added more beauty to Rampur. The tourism industry has not yet been developed because of the lack of resources. However people are aware about it and hopefully, in next 10 years there will be great changes in arrival of tourists and tourism industry. By the point of view of visiting tourist in Rampur there is widely known and famous place which is known as Talpokhara. Talpokhara is the historical place by the point of view for tourism. In Talpokhara there is a temple and different parks to visit. If the temple and other resources will built in time that will be good for Rampur and as well as Nepal for economical development. At that temple lord Shiva is worshiped in [[Mahashivaratri]] most of the people go there to worship lord Shiva as well as to visit Talpokhara.

==Political Situation==
Rampur is surrounded by [[Kali Gandaki]] at northern side, [[Walamalang|Wakamalang]] from east, [[Haklang]] from west and [[Sahalkot]], [[Galgha|Galdha]], [[Siluwa]], [[Ringneraha]] & [[Birkot]] at south. Bejhad is its headquarter. ''Talpokhara Temple'' (known as the second heaven by the locals) is situated at the northern side of Rampur Municipality which is near from Kaligandaki river. It lies in ward number 9 of Rampur Municipality.
