'''Harvey Alexander Logan''' (1867 - June 17, 1904), also known as '''Kid Curry''', was an [[United States|American]] [[outlaw]] and [[gunfighter|gunman]] who ran with [[Butch Cassidy]] and the [[Sundance Kid]]'s infamous [[Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch|Wild Bunch]] gang. Despite being less well known than his counterparts, he has since been referred to as "the wildest of the Wild Bunch".<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://hometown.aol.com/Gibson0817/KidCurry.htm Kid Curry, the Wildest of the Bunch<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He killed at least nine law enforcement officers in five different shootings, and another two men in other instances, and was involved in several shootouts with posses and civilians during his outlaw days.

==Early life==
Kid Curry was born in Richland Township, [[Tama County]], [[Iowa]]. His mother died in 1876, and his brothers, Hank, Johnny and Lonny, moved to [[Dodson, Missouri]], to live with their aunt Lee Logan. Until at least 1883, Curry made his living breaking horses on the Cross L [[ranch]], near [[Rising Star, Texas]]. While there, he met and befriended a man named "Flat Nose" [[George Curry (Wild Bunch)|George Curry]], from whom he took his new last name. His brothers soon adopted the same last name. The three brothers were known as hard workers until they got paid. Money didn't stay in their pockets for long. They all had a taste for alcohol and women. Kid Curry would often return from a train or bank robbery, get drunk and lay up with prostitutes until his share of the take was gone. After Kid Curry became famous, the prostitutes would frequently name him as the father when they became pregnant. The bastard children were referred to as "Curry Kids." It is believed that Kid Curry was credited with as many as eighty-five children. The number of children he actually fathered was probably less than five. Descendants of the "Curry Kids" remain scattered throughout Eastland County and the surrounding areas to this day.      

He rode as a [[cowboy]] on a cattle drive to [[Pueblo, Colorado]], in 1883. While in Pueblo, he was involved in a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] brawl. To avoid arrest, he fled, settling in southern [[Wyoming]]. In Wyoming, Curry worked for the "Circle C" and the "Circle Diamond" ranches. By all accounts, when sober, Curry was mild-mannered, likable, and loyal to both friends and his brothers.

==Outlaw life==
{{WikiProject AOW WildBunch

The events that changed the course of his life began when his brother Hank and friend Jim Thornhill bought a ranch at Rock Creek, in [[Chouteau County, Montana]]. The ranch was near the site of a mine strike made by local miner/lawman Powell "Pike" Landusky. Landusky, according to some reports of the day, confronted Curry and attacked him, believing Curry was involved romantically with Landusky's daughter, Elfie. Landusky then filed assault charges against Curry, who was arrested and beaten. 

Two friends of Curry's, A.S. Lohman and Frank Plunkett, paid a $500 bond for Curry's release. Landusky's daughter, Elfie,  later claimed it was Curry's brother, Lonny, with whom she had been involved. However, the confession came much too late. On December 27, 1894, Curry caught Landusky at a local saloon, and hit Landusky, stunning him. Curry, evidently believing the fight was over, began walking away. Landusky pulled his pistol and began threatening Curry, who was unarmed. Curry's friend and his brother's partner, Jim Thornhill, gave Curry his pistol. Landusky's gun jammed and Curry shot him dead. 

Curry was arrested and at an inquest was released when it was judged that he acted in [[self defense]]. However, a formal trial was set. Curry believed he would not get a fair trial, because the judge was close friends with Landusky. For this reason, Curry left town.

==Riding with the Black Jack Ketchum gang==
He started riding with outlaw [[Tom Ketchum|"Black Jack" Ketchum]]. [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] detectives began trailing Curry shortly after his departure from [[Montana]]. In January 1896, Curry received word that an old friend of Landusky's, rancher James Winters, had been spying on him, for the reward offered in his arrest. Curry and two of his brothers, Johnny and Lonny, went to Winters' ranch to confront him. However, a shootout erupted. Johnny was killed, while Curry and Lonny escaped. Shortly after, Curry and Lonny argued with Black Jack Ketchum over the take in a [[train robbery]]. The two brothers left the gang.

==Forming his own gang==
They both received employment on a cattle ranch, arranged by their cousin, Bob Lee, near [[Sand Gulch, Colorado]]. Pinkerton agents trailing Curry gave up his trail briefly. Curry, Lonny, Walt Putnam and George Curry formed their own gang around this time. He temporarily left Colorado, intending to scout good targets for potential robberies. Around April 1897, Curry was reportedly involved in the killing of Deputy [[Sheriff]] William Deane of [[Powder River, Wyoming]], as he and his gang gathered fresh horses on a ranch in the [[Powder River Basin]]. After this, he returned to Colorado to the ranch where he was working. 

By June 1897, the cowboy job had ended, and Curry ventured north with the rest of the gang. They robbed a bank in [[Belle Fourche, South Dakota]], and met resistance outside the bank from the townspeople. One of their friends, Tom O'Day, was captured when his horse spooked and ran away without him. The others escaped, but while planning a second robbery a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] from the town caught up with them in [[Fergus County, Montana]]. During a shootout, Curry was shot through the wrist, and his horse was shot from under him, resulting in his capture. George Curry and Walt Putnam were also captured. All three were held in the [[Deadwood, South Dakota]] jail, but only briefly; they overpowered the jailer and escaped. They headed back into Montana and robbed two post offices.<ref>[http://genforum.genealogy.com/wy/messages/2863.html Deputy Sherriff William Deane-killed April 1897 {Powder River}<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=6276 Sheriff Josiah Hazen, Converse County Sheriff's Office<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Riding with Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch==
It was during this time that he began riding with the Wild Bunch gang under [[Butch Cassidy]]. It is believed that Kid Curry was considered the "fastest gun in the West" and that he was based on the [[Sundance Kid]], who was not actually a gunman like Logan. On June 2, 1899, the gang robbed a [[Union Pacific Railroad]] overland flyer near [[Wilcox, Wyoming]], a robbery that became famous. Many notable lawmen of the day took part in the hunt for the robbers, but they were not captured. 

During one shootout with lawmen following that robbery, both Kid Curry and George Curry shot and killed [[Converse County, Wyoming|Converse County]] Sheriff Joe Hazen.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  Noted killer-for-hire and contract employee of the Pinkerton Agency, [[Tom Horn]], obtained information from explosives expert Bill Speck that revealed that George Curry and Kid Curry had shot Hazen, which Horn passed on to Pinkerton detective [[Charlie Siringo]]. The gang escaped into the [[Hole-in-the-Wall]], an area that the gang used as its hideout. Curry and the Sundance Kid used a [[log cabin]] at [[Old Trail Town]] as a hideout before they robbed a bank in [[Red Lodge, Montana]]. Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and other desperados met at another cabin brought to Old Trail Town from the [[Hole-in-the-Wall]] country in north central Wyoming. It was built in 1883 by Alexander Ghent.<ref>[http://www.codywyomingnet.com/attractions/old_trail_town.php Cody Wyoming: Old West Trail Town, History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Siringo had been assigned the task of bringing in the outlaw gang. He became friends with Elfie Landusky. Effie was using the last name of Curry, alleging that Lonny Curry had gotten her pregnant. Through her, Siringo intended to locate the gang. Siringo changed his name to Charles L. Carter, disguised himself as an on-the-run gunman, and began mingling with people that might know the Currys, becoming friends with Jim Thornhill. 

However, Kid Curry was in a place referred to as "[[Robbers Roost]]", in [[Utah]]. Curry then went to [[Alma, New Mexico]], with Cassidy and others, intending to hide for a while. On July 11, 1899, while working at the W.S. Ranch, Curry robbed a train near [[Folsom, New Mexico]], with gang members [[Elzy Lay]] and Sam Ketchum. A posse led by [[Huerfano County, Colorado|Huerfano County (Colorado)]] Sheriff Ed Farr<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/officer/4738-sheriff-edward-j-farr Sheriff Edward J. Farr, Huerfano County Sheriff's Department<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> cornered the gang near an area called Turkey Creek, which resulted in two gun battles over a period of four days. Lay and Ketchum were both wounded and later captured, with Lay killing the sheriff and wounding [[Colfax County, New Mexico|Colfax County]] Deputy Henry Love in the process. He received a life sentence for the murders. Ketchum died from his wounds days later while in custody, and deputy Love died from wounds he received.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/officer/15714-posseman-henry-m-love Posseman Henry M. Love, Colfax County Sheriff's Department<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Curry escaped, but he, Cassidy, and other members of the gang were forced to leave [[New Mexico]]. Sam Ketchum was the brother of Tom "Black Jack" Ketchum. Curry traveled to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], where he stayed briefly. While there he met prostitute [[Della Moore]] (also known as Annie Rogers or Maude Williams), with whom he became romantically involved. At the time of their meeting, she was working in [[Fannie Porter|Madame Fannie Porter]]'s [[brothel]], which was a regular hideout for the Wild Bunch gang.

==Moab revenge gunfight, other killings to avoid capture==
On February 28, 1900, lawmen attempted to arrest Lonny Curry at his aunt's home. Lonny was killed in the shootout that followed, and his cousin Bob Lee was arrested for [[rustling]] and sent to prison in Wyoming. Kid Curry was now the last surviving brother. In March 1900, Curry was identified in [[St. Johns, Apache County, Arizona]] as he was passing notes suspected of being from the Wilcox robbery. Local [[Apache County, Arizona|Apache County]] Sheriff Edward Beeler gathered a posse and began tracking Curry, who was accompanied by Bill Carver. The posse shot it out with Curry and Carver on March 28. 
Curry and Carver killed Deputy Andrew Gibbons and Deputy Frank LeSeuer. On May 26, Kid Curry rode into Utah and killed [[Grand County, Utah]] Sheriff [http://www.odmp.org/officer/13524-sheriff-jesse-tyler Jesse Tyler] and Deputy Sam Jenkins in a brazen shootout in [[Moab, Utah|Moab]].<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/officer/7094-deputy-sheriff-samuel-jenkins Deputy Sheriff Samuel Jenkins, Grand County Sheriff's Department<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Both killings were in retaliation for them killing George Curry and his brother Lonny. 

Curry then returned with the Wild Bunch. They robbed a train near [[Tipton, Wyoming]], which newspaper stories claiming the gang got more than $55,000. The gang again split up, with Kid Curry and Ben Kilpatrick heading south to [[Fort Worth, Texas]], while Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and Bill Carver immediately pulled off another robbery in [[Winnemucca, Nevada]]. 

Siringo, still working the case for the Pinkertons, was in [[Circleville, Utah]], where Butch Cassidy had been raised. Curry rejoined the gang, and they hit another Union Pacific train near [[Wagner, Montana]]. This time, they took over $60,000 in cash. Gang member [[William Carver (Wild Bunch)|Will Carver]] was killed in [[Sonora, Texas]] by [[Sutton County, Texas|Sutton County]] Sheriff Elijah Briant during the pursuit following that robbery. 

Again the gang split up. In October 1901, Della Moore was arrested in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] for passing money tied to an earlier robbery involving Curry. On December 12, gang members [[Ben Kilpatrick]] and [[Laura Bullion]] were captured in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. On December 13, Kid Curry shot Knoxville policemen William Dinwiddle<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/officer/16704-patrolman-william-dinwiddie Patrolman William Dinwiddie, Knoxville Police Department<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and Robert Saylor<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/officer/16703-patrolman-robert-saylor Patrolman Robert Saylor, Knoxville Police Department<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in a shootout and escaped. Curry, despite being pursued by Pinkerton agents and other law enforcement officials, returned to Montana, where he shot and killed rancher James Winters, who was responsible for the killing of his brother Johnny years before.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

==Capture, escape, death==
Curry then traveled back to Knoxville. In a pool hall on November 30, 1902, Curry was captured after a lengthy physical fight with lawmen. He was convicted of robbery because facts in the murder of the two policemen were not definite and no witnesses would testify, and he received a sentence of 20 years at hard labor and a $5,000 fine. However, on June 27, 1903, Curry escaped. Rumors that a deputy had received an $8,000 bribe to allow his escape spread, but nothing could be proven.

On June 7, 1904, Kid Curry was tracked down by a posse outside of [[Parachute, Colorado]].  Curry and two others had robbed a train outside of Parachute. As they escaped, they stole fresh horses owned by Roll Gardner and a neighbor. The next morning, when they discovered their horses had been stolen, Gardner and the neighbor set out in pursuit of the gang. They joined up with a posse and continued tracking the outlaws. The gang shot Gardner and his neighbor's horses from under them. Gardner found cover while his neighbor started running. Kid Curry took aim at the neighbor and Gardner shot Curry. Curry decided to end it at that time, and fatally shot himself in the head to avoid capture. The other two robbers escaped.<ref>Fishell, Dave. 1983. [[Grand Junction Daily Sentinel]]. May 22. Page 9.</ref><ref>The Westerners Brand Book. 1960. July. Page 33.</ref> The rifle Gardner used is still in the family today.

Curry is buried in Linwood Cemetery overlooking [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]], a short distance from fellow gunfighter [[Doc Holliday]]'s memorial.

==Appearance in literature and cinema==
Curry appears as the primary villain in Gerald Kolpan's critically acclaimed 2009 novel, ETTA ([http://www.ettathenovel.com www.ettathenovel.com]) The book tells the story of the Wild Bunch and Butch and Sundance through the eyes of  Etta Place, Sundance's alleged lover.

Curry appears as a character in ''[[Mr American]]'' by [[George MacDonald Fraser]]. The novel, set in 1909, uses the controversy surrounding Curry's death to portray him as surviving the shootout near Parachute and later tracking the novel's protagonist, Mark Franklin, to England, where Curry attempts to kill Franklin.

[[Ted Cassidy]] played Kid Curry / Harvey Logan in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.

[[Ben Murphy]] portrayed a fictionalized Kid Curry in the 1970s television show ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]''.

The [[Mythbusters]] tested the [[MythBusters_(2006_season)#Gunslinger_Myths|claim]] that Logan could drop a silver dollar off his hand and then draw and fire five shots from his revolver before it hit the ground. They found the claim to be highly unlikely.
