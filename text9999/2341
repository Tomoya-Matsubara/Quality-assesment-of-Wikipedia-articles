== Etymology ==
The color pink is named after the flowers called [[Dianthus|pinks]], [[flowering plant]]s in the genus ''[[Dianthus]].'' The name derives from the frilled edge of the flowers<U+2014>the [[verb]] "to pink" dates from the 14th century and means "to decorate with a perforated or punched pattern" (possibly from German "pinken" = to peck).<ref>Collins Dictionary</ref>  As noted and referenced above, the word "pink" was first used as a noun to refer to the color known today as pink in the 17th century.  The verb sense of the word "pink" continues to be used today in the name of the hand tool known as [[pinking shears]].

== History, art and fashion ==

=== From the ancient world to the Renaissance ===
The color pink has been described in literature since ancient times;  In the [[Odyssey]], written in about 800 BCE, [[Homer]] wrote "Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn appeared...<ref>The Odyssey, Book XII, translated by Samuel Butler.</ref>
Roman poets also described the color.  ''[[wikt:roseus|Roseus]]'' is the [[Latin]] word meaning "[[Rose (color)|rosy]]" or "pink." [[Lucretius]] used the word to describe the [[dawn]] in his [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''On the Nature of Things'' (''[[De rerum natura]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ablemedia.com/ctcweb/glossary/glossaryr.html |title=CTCWeb Glossary: R (ratis to ruta) |publisher=Ablemedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>

Pink was not a common color in the fashion of the Middle Ages;  nobles usually  preferred brighter reds, such as crimson.  However,  it did appear sometimes in women's fashion, and in religious art. In the 13th and 14th century,  in works by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio]], the Christ child was sometimes portrayed dressed in pink, the color  associated with the body of Christ.

In the high Renaissance painting the [[Madonna of the Pinks]] by [[Raphael]], the Christ child is presenting a [[pink (flower)|pink flower]] to the [[Virgin Mary]]. The pink was a symbol of marriage, showing a spiritual marriage between the mother and child. <ref> http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6596 ''The Madonna of the Pinks'' on the official National Gallery website </ref>
 
During the Renaissance, pink was mostly used for the flesh color of faces and hands. The pigment commonly used for this was called light cinabrese; it was a mixture of the red earth pigment called [[sinopia]], or [[Venetian red]], and a white pigment called ''Bianco San Genovese'', or lime white. In his famous 15th century manual on painting, ''Il Libro Dell'Arte'', [[Cennino Cennini]] described it this way: "The color is made of the hansomest and lightest sinoper obtainable, and it is mixed and worked up with lime white; and this white is made from very white and well-purified lime. And when these two colors are well worked up together, that is, two parts cinabrese and the third lime white, make little cakes of it, like halves of nuts, and let them dry. Whenever you need some, take what you think fit; for this color does you credit in painting countenances, hands, and nudes on the wall." <ref>Cennino Cennini, ''The Craftsman's Handbook - Il Libro dell'Arte'', pg. 23-24.</ref>

=== The 18th century ===
The golden age of the color pink was the [[Rococo]] Period (1720<U+2013>1777) in the 18th century, when  pastel colors became very fashionable in all the courts of Europe.   Pink was particularly championed by [[Madame de Pompadour]] (1721<U+2013>1764), the mistress of King [[Louis XV of France]].  who  wore combinations of pale blue and pink, and had a particular tint of pink made for her by the [[Sevres porcelain]] factory, created by adding nuances of blue, black and yellow.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', pp. 182-83</ref>

While pink was quite evidently the color of seduction in the portraits made of by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] of  [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]],  the future mistress of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]], in the late 18th century, it had the completely opposite meaning in the portrait of Sarah Barrett Moulton painted by [[Thomas Lawrence]] in 1794.  In this painting, it symbolized childhood, innocence and tenderness.  Sarah Moulton was just eleven years old when the picture was painted, and died tragically the following year.

===The 19th century===
In 19th century England, pink ribbons or decorations  were often wore by small boys;  boys were simply considered small men, and while men in England wore red uniforms, boys wore pink.  In fact the clothing for children in the 19th century was almost always white, since, before the invention of chemical dyes,  clothing of any color  would quickly fade when washed in boiling water.  Queen Victoria was painted in 1850 with her seventh child and third son, Prince Arthur, who wore white and pink.

=== The 20th century ===
In the 20th century, pinks became bolder, brighter and more assertive,  in part because of the invention of chemical dyes which did not fade. The pioneer in the creation of the new wave of pinks was the Italian  designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]], (1890-1973) who was aligned with the artists of the [[surrealist]] movement, including [[Jean Cocteau]].  In 1931 she created a new variety of the color, called [[Shocking pink]], made by mixing [[magenta]] with a small amount of white.  She also created a scandal by launching a perfume of the same name, sold in a bottle in the shale of a woman's bust.  Her fashions, co-designed with artists such as Cocteau, featured the new pinks.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques'', p. 184.</ref>

In [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1930s and 1940s, inmates of [[concentration camps]] who were accused of [[homosexuality]] were forced to wear a [[pink triangle]].<ref>''The Pink Triangle: The Nazi War Against Homosexuals'' (1986) by Richard Plant (New Republic Books). ISBN 0-8050-0600-1.</ref> Because of this, the pink triangle has become a symbol of the modern [[gay rights movement]].

In 1973, [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] created "Pink," a broadside meant to explore the notions of gender as associated with the color pink, for an American Institute of Graphic Arts exhibition about color. This was the only entry about the color pink. Various women including many in the Feminist Studio Workshop at the [[Woman's Building]] submitted entries exploring their association with the color. De Bretteville arranged the squares of paper to form a "quilt" from which posters were printed and disseminated throughout Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moca.org/wack/?p=276 |title=WACK!

In 1993, artist Gioia Fonda created a conceptual piece in the form of a week long holiday called ''pink week.'' The intention of pink week is to liberate the color pink from all dogma and simply celebrate the color pink as a color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkweek.org |title=Pink Week-when Pink means Pink: |publisher=Pinkweek.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>

===Why cooked beef, cured ham and steamed shrimp are pink===
Raw [[beef]] is red, because the muscles of [[vertebrate]] animals, such as cows and pigs, contain a [[protein]] called [[myoglobin]], which binds oxygen and [[iron]] atoms.  When beef is cooked, the myoglobin proteins undergo oxidation, and gradually turn from red to pink to brown; that is, from rare to medium to well-done. Pork contains less myoglobin than beef and therefore is less red; when heated it changes from pinkish-red to less pink to tan or white.

[[Ham]], though it contains myoglobins like beef, undergoes a different transformation.  Traditional hams, such as [[prosciutto]], are made by taking the hind leg or thigh of a pig, covering it with sea salt, which removes the moisture content, and then letting it dry or cure for as long as two years. The salt ([[sodium nitrate]]) permits the ham to retain its original pink color, even when dried out.  Supermarket hams are made by a different and faster process;  they are brined, or infused with a salt-water solution, containing [[sodium nitrite]], which transfers [[nitric oxide]], which bonds with the  myoglobin to form the traditional pink cured ham color.

===Plants and flowers ===
Pink is one of the most common colors of flowers;  it serves to attract the insects and birds necessary for [[pollination]] and perhaps also to deter predators.  The color comes from natural pigments called [[anthocyanins]], which also provide the pink in [[raspberries]].

=== Pigments - Pinke ===
{{Main|Pinke (color)}}
In the 17th century, the word ''pink'' or ''pinke'' was also used to describe a yellowish pigment, which was mixed with blue colors to yield greenish colors. Thomas Jenner's ''A Book of Drawing, Limning, Washing'' (1652) categorizes "Pink & [[Blue|blew]] [[bice]]" amongst the [[green]]s (p. &nbsp;38),<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenner|first=Thomas |title=A Book of Drawing, Limning, Washing|publisher=M. Simmons |location=London |year=1652 |page=38 |url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp20532}}</ref> and specifies several admixtures of greenish colors made with pink<U+2014>e.g. "Grasse-green is made of Pink and Bice, it is shadowed with [[Indigo]] and Pink <U+2026> French-green of Pink and Indico [shadowed with] Indico" (pp.&nbsp;38<U+2013>40). In [[William Salmon]]'s ''Polygraphice'' (1673), "Pink yellow" is mentioned amongst the chief [[yellow]] pigments (p.&nbsp;96), and the reader is instructed to mix it with either [[Saffron (color)|Saffron]] or [[Venetian ceruse|Ceruse]] for "sad" or "light" shades thereof, respectively.

== Pink in symbolism and world culture ==

===Pink in other languages===
In most European languages, the color pink as the name of the [[rose]] flower;  ''rose'' in French and Dutch;  ''rosa'' in German, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian; ''rozoviy'' in Russian;  and ''rozowy'' in Polish.  In Finnish it is called ''pinkki''.

In the Japanese language, the traditional word for pink, {{nihongo|'''''Momo-iro'''''|<U+3082><U+3082><U+3044><U+308D>}}'',  takes its name from the peach blossom. There is a separate word for the color of the cherry blossom:  ''sakura-iro''.  In recent times a word based on the American  version, {{nihongo|'''''Pinku'''''|<U+30D4><U+30F3><U+30AF>}}, has begun to be used.

===Idioms and expressions===
*'''In the pink'''.  To be in top form, in good health, in good condition.  In Romeo and Juliet, Mercutio says;  "I am the very pink of courtesy."  Romeo: Pink for flower?  Mercutio: Right.   Romeo: Then my pump is well flowered.".<ref>Romeo and Juliet, Act 2, Scene 4</ref>
*'''To see pink elephants''' means  to hallucinate from alcoholism.  The expression was used by American novelist [[Jack London]] in his book ''John Barleycorn'' in 1913.
*'''Pink slip'''. To be given a pink slip means to be fired or dismissed from a job. It was first recorded in 1915 in the United States.

* '''Tickled pink''' means extremely pleased.

===Architecture===
Early pink buildings are usually built of brick or  [[sandstone]],  which takes its pale red color from hematite, or iron ore.   In the 18th century, the golden age of pink and other pastel colors,  pink mansions and churches, were built all across Europe. More modern pink buildings usually take that color to appear exotic or to attract attention.

=== Gender ===
In Europe and the United States, pink is often associated with girls, while blue is associated with boys.  This distinction is relatively recent, usually dated to early in the 20th century.<ref>Jo B. Paoletti, ''Pink and Blue: Telling the Girls From the Boys in America'' (Indiana University Press, 2012), 87</ref>  Before the 20th century, European countries varied, with some assigning colors based on the baby's complexion, and others assigning pink sometimes to boys and sometimes to girls.<ref>{{cite news|title=Is pink for girls or boys?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8422000/8422225.stm|accessdate=1 October 2012|newspaper=BBC Radio|date=19 December 2009}}</ref>

By the 1950s, pink was strongly associated with femininity" but to an extent that was "neither rigid nor universal" as it later became.<ref>Paoletti, 92</ref>

An article in the trade publication ''Earnshaw's Infants' Department'' in June 1918 said:

Orenstein writes: "When colors were first introduced to the nursery in the early part of the 20th century, pink was considered the more masculine hue, a pastel version of red. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness, was thought to be dainty. Why or when that switched is not clear, but as late as the 1930s a significant percentage of adults in one national survey held to that split."</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28832 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080228111428/http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28832 | archivedate = 2008-02-28 | title = Pink is for Boys: cultural history of the color pink | author = Jude Stewart| work = Step Inside Design Magazine | year = 2008 }}</ref>
{{quote|The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls.<!--No, this is not a typo. The citation confirms this was the case --> The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.}}
* One study by two neuroscientists in ''Current Biology'' examined color preferences across cultures and found significant differences between male and female responses. Both groups favored blues over other hues, but women had more favorable responses to the reddish-purple range of the spectrum and men had more favorable responses to the greenish-yellow end of the spectrum. Despite the fact that the study used adults, and both groups preferred blues, and responses to the color ''pink'' were never even tested, the popular press represented the research as an indication of an innate preference by girls for pink. The misreading has been often repeated in market research, reinforcing American culture's association of pink with girls on the basis of imagined innate characteristics.<ref>Paoletti, 97-8</ref>

* In the [[France|French]] [[academic dress]] system, the five traditional fields of study (Arts, Science, Medicine, Law and Divinity) are each symbolized by a distinctive color, which appears in the [[academic dress]] of the people who graduated in this field.

=== The press ===
Pink is used for the newsprint paper of several important newspapers devoted to business and sports, and the color is also connected with the press aimed at the gay community.

Since 1893 the London ''[[Financial Times]]'' newspaper has used a distinctive [[salmon pink]] color for its newsprint, originally because pink dyed paper was less expensive than bleached white paper.<ref>Cited by Stephen Fidler of the Wall Street Journal, formerly a correspondent for the Financial Times.</ref>   Today the color is used to distinguish the newspaper  from competitors on a press kiosk or news stand. In some countries, the ''salmon press'' identifies economic newspapers or economics sections in "white" newspapers.  Some sports newspapers, such as [[La Gazzetta dello Sport]] in Italy, also use pink paper to stand out from other newspapers.  It awards a pink jersey to the winner of Italy's most important bicycle race, the [[Giro d'Italia]]. (See [[#Sports]]).

* Carl Surely's short story "Dinsdale's Pink" is a [[coming of age]] tale of a young man growing up in [[Berlin]] in the 1930s, dealing with issues of gender, sexuality and politics.

=== Politics ===
* Pink, being a 'watered-down' red, is sometimes used in a derogatory way to describe a person with mild [[communism|communist]] or [[socialism|socialist]] beliefs (see [[Pinko]]).

=== Religion ===

It is used for the Third Sunday of [[Advent]] and the Fourth Sunday of [[Lent]] (see [[Laetare Sunday]]) to mark the halfway point in these seasons of penance. For this reason, one of the candles in an [[Advent wreath]] may be pink, rather than purple. 
* Pink is the color most associated with Indian spiritual leader [[Meher Baba]], who often wore pink coats to please his closest female follower, Mehera Irani, and today pink remains an important color, symbolizing love, to Baba's followers.

=== Toys ===
* [[Toy]]s aimed at girls often display pink prominently on packaging and the toy themselves.  This caused concern among some fans of ''My Little Pony:  Friendship Is Magic'' when Princess Celestia, white-coated in the show itself, had a toy released with her colored pink instead.
* In its 1957 catalog, [[Lionel Trains]] offered for sale a pink model [[freight train]] for girls.  The [[steam locomotive]] and [[coal car]] were pink and the freight cars of the freight train were various [[pastel colors]]. The [[caboose]] was [[baby blue]]. It was a marketing failure because any girl who was enough a [[tomboy]] to want a [[model train]] would want a real train and not a pink train, and boys in the 1950s did not want to be seen playing with a pink train.  However, today it is a valuable collector's item.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionel-train-set.com/ |title=Lionel's 1957 pink train for girls: |publisher=Lionel-train-set.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}}</ref>
