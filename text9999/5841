"'''What Have You Done for Me Lately'''" is the [[lead single]] from [[Janet Jackson]]'s third studio album, ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' (1986), and her first smash hit on both the pop and R&B charts.

==Song information==
The song was written by Jackson and [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] and produced by Jam and Lewis. Jackson helped with the lyrics of the song and was credited as a "co-producer", although she is not given official credit as a producer. The song deals with a relationship that has gone bad because the man is not doing enough to please Jackson, prompting her to ask the title question. It received nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1987|1987 Grammy Awards]], where Jackson performed the song live. Jackson has performed the song on all five of her concert tours, [[Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour]], [[janet. Tour]], [[The Velvet Rope Tour]], [[All for You Tour]], and [[Rock Witchu Tour]].

==In popular culture==
The song, in particular its title, is referenced in the 1987 film ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw]]'', as a common question that women ask their partners prior to breaking up.

It should be noted that the famous "LatelyBass" preset on the [[Yamaha TX81Z]] (used extensively on [[house music|house]] and [[techno]] songs of the late '80s and '90s) was based on the bass tone of this song, and subsequently named after it as well.

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] [[interpolation (music)|interpolated]] the song in performances of his top twenty hit "[[Partyman]]" during his 1990 [[Nude Tour]].

The song was interpolated for a medley sung in the 1993 comedy ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]'', and was [[cover version|covered]] by the American [[soul music|soul]]-[[funk]] band [[Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings]] in 2002 for their debut album, ''[[Dap Dippin' with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings]]''.

"What Have You Done for Me Lately" ranked number three hundred and forty-one on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'''s list of The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born.<ref>[http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1757]</ref>

The song is featured in the 1989 made for television Disney Movie ''[[The Parent Trap III]]''.

==Chart performance==
Released in February 1986, "What Have You Done for Me Lately" is known as the breakthrough single for Jackson; it was her first big hit after several years of minor success on the R&B chart, and helped her to establish an artistic identity separate from that of her brother, [[Michael Jackson]].

The single debuted on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart at number ninety-five the week of February 22, 1986, and checked into the top forty of the chart a month later, advancing from number forty-eight to number thirty-nine. Eight weeks later, the week of May 17, 1986, "What Have You Done for Me Lately" reached its peak position of number four. It also spent two weeks atop the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. On the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' year-end charts of 1986, it was ranked number forty-three on the Hot 100 singles, number thirteen on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] singles, and number twenty-eight on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] singles. The single was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] on November 12, 1990<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&title=What%20Have%20You%20Done%20For%20Me%20Lately&artist=Janet%20Jackson&perPage=25 |title=RIAA <U+2013> Gold & Platinum |accessdate=2009-02-22 |date=November 12, 1990 |work=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]}}</ref> and silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] on May 1, 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=19486 |title=BPI Certified Awards |accessdate=2009-02-23 |date=May 1, 1986 |work=[[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]]}}</ref>

"What Have You Done for Me Lately" was also an international hit and one of Jackson's biggest hits outside of the United States. It peaked at number one in the Netherlands, and made the top five in Canada and the United Kingdom and the top ten in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Ireland.

==Music video==
[[Image:Whydfmlvid3.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Jackson dances for the camera in the "What Have You Done for Me Lately" video.]]
In the [[music video]], directed by Brian Jones and Piers Ashworth, Jackson goes to a funky diner with her friends to talk about her relationship problems. Her boyfriend shows up with his friends, and Jackson decides to give him a piece of her mind. In the video, Jackson's reality is a dark world with faded colors. In a more dreamscape world, the colors are vibrant and everything is 2-D. The "What Have You Done for Me Lately" video won a [[Soul Train Music Award]] for [[Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video|Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video]] in 1987. The video's choreographer was [[Paula Abdul]], who appears in the video as Jackson's friend. It was made available on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] on February 1, 2007.

Music video actor-dancer Rudy Huston played Jackson's boyfriend in the video and was also in numerous other videos of the era including [[Perri "Pebbles" Reid|Pebbles]]' top ten hits "[[Girlfriend (Pebbles song)|Girlfriend]]" and "[[Mercedes Boy]]". Jackson met Huston on the set of the television series ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]'' starring [[Debbie Allen]], in which Jackson had a co-starring role and Huston was a featured dance student along with [[Jasmine Guy]], before the latter's ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]'' fame.
