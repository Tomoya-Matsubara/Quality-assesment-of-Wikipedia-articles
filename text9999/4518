Vigils and marches were organized all across the United States.<ref>[http://www.rememberinglawrence.org rememberinglawrence.org]</ref> An estimated 1,000 people marched in Oxnard, California the weekend following the murder to pay their respects to King and raise public awareness of [[homophobia|homophobic]] violence.<ref>[http://www.queerty.com/1000-march-for-officially-dead-lawrence-king-20080218 "1000 March For Officially Dead Lawrence King"], ''Queerty'', February 18, 2008</ref>

{{cquote2|<U+201C>I was deeply saddened by the recent death of 15-year-old Lawrence King who was killed at his school in Oxnard, CA.

{{cquote2|It was heartbreaking to learn about Lawrence King<U+2019>s death, and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family. King<U+2019>s senseless death is a tragic example of the corrosive effect that bigotry and fear can have in our society. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s also an urgent reminder that we need to do more in our schools to foster tolerance and an acceptance of diversity; that we must enact a federal hate crimes law that protects all [[LGBT]] Americans; and that we must recommit ourselves to becoming active and engaged parents, citizens and neighbors, so that bias and bigotry cannot take hold in the first place. We all have a responsibility to help this nation live up to its founding promise of equality for all.<U+201D><ref name="QW" />|Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] in a released statement.}}

====California Diversity Bill====
The introduction of a new diversity education bill by California Assemblyman [[Mike Eng]] was introduced on behalf of King. The new bill would require mandatory classes on diversity and tolerance in California school districts. "We need to teach young people that there's a curriculum called tolerance education that should be in every school. We should teach young people that diversity is not something to be assaulted, but diversity is something that needs to be embraced because diversity makes California the great state that it is," Eng said.<ref>[http://medianewsgroup.a.mms.mavenapps.net/mms/rt/1/site/medianewsgroup-lang-sangabriel-pub01-live/current/launch.html?maven_playerId=videos&maven_referralObject=13a7db9f-9daa-46a8-9faf-01a14ba07a9c "Mike Eng announces tolerance-promoting Bill"] (streaming video)</ref>
