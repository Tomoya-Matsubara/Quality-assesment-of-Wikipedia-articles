{{Planet Infobox/Earth}}
'''Earth''' (often referred to as "The Earth") is the third [[planet]] in the [[solar system]] in terms of distance from the [[Sun]], and the fifth in order of size. It is the largest of its [[planetary system]]'s [[terrestrial planet]]s and the only place in the [[universe]] currently known to support [[life]]. The Earth was formed around 4.57 [[billion]] (4.57{{e|9}})<ref>G.B. Dalrymple, 1991, "The Age of the Earth", ''Stanford University Press'', California, ISBN 0-8047-1569-6.</ref> [[year]]s ago (see [[Age of the Earth]]) and its largest [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], was orbiting it shortly thereafter, around 4.533 billion years ago.   
Since it formed, the Earth has evolved through geologic and biological processes so that any traces of the original conditions have been virtually eliminated. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several [[tectonic plate]]s that gradually migrate across the surface over geologic time spans. The interior of the planet remains active, with a thick layer of molten [[mantle]] and an iron core that generates a [[magnetic field]].  The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered by the presence of life forms, which create an ecological balance that modifies the surface conditions. About 70% of the surface is presently covered in salt water [[ocean]]s, and the remainder consists of [[continents]] and [[islands]].  

There is significant interaction between the Earth and the space environment. The relatively large Moon provides ocean [[tide]]s and has gradually modified the length of the planet's rotation period. A [[comet]]ary bombardment during the early history of the planet is believed to have formed the oceans. Later, [[asteroid]] impacts are understood to have caused significant changes to the surface environment. Changes in the orbit of the planet may also be responsible for the [[ice age]]s that have covered significant portions of the surface in glacial sheets.

The Earth does not have another natural orbiting body other than the Moon, although [[3753 Cruithne|Cruithne]] has been erroneously described as such. Cruithne was discovered in 1986 and follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun at about the same average orbital radius as the Earth. However, from the point of view of the moving Earth, Cruithne follows a horseshoe orbit around the Sun that avoids close proximity with the Earth.

==Lexicography==
Terms that refer to the Earth can use the [[Latin (language)|Latin]] root ''terra-'', such as the word ''terrestrial''. There is also the alternative Latin root ''tellur-'', as used in words such as [[telluric]], [[tellurian]], [[tellurion]] and [[Tellurium]]. Both terms derive from the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Terra (mythology)|Terra Mater]], who was also called by the presumably more ancient name Tell<U+016B>s Mater. Scientific terms such as [[geography]], [[geocentric]] and [[geothermal]] use the [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix ''geo-'', derived from Terra Mater's [[Greek mythology|Greek]] counterpart [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].

The English word "earth" has [[cognate]]s in many modern and ancient languages. Examples in modern tongues include ''aarde'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and ''Erde'' in [[German language|German]]. The root also has cognates in extinct languages such as ''ertha'' in [[Old Saxon]] and ''ert'' (meaning "ground") in [[Middle Irish]], derived from the [[Old English]] ''eor&#0240;e''. All of these words are derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] base *er-. Given [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]], we can find cognates of "earth" between ''terra'' and the modern [[Romance languages]], for instance ''tierra'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or ''terra'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Several [[Semitic languages]] have words for "earth" similar to those in [[Indo-European languages]], although evidence of a link is not overwhelming. Arabic has ''aard''; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], ''irtsitu''; [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], ''araa''; [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]], ''erets'' (which appears in the [[Mesha Stele]]); and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], <U+05D0><U+05E8><U+05E5> (''arets'', or ''erets'' when followed by a [[Hebrew grammar#Nouns|noun modifier]]).

===Symbol===
The [[astrology|astrological]] and [[astronomical symbol]] for Earth consists of a circled cross, the arms of the cross representing a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] and the [[equator]] (<big>{{unicode|&#x2295;}}</big>). A variant puts the cross atop the circle (<big>{{unicode|&#x2641;}}</big>).

==History==
{{main|History of Earth}}

Based on the available evidence, scientists have been able to reconstruct detailed information about the planet's past. Earth is believed to have formed around 4.55 billion years ago out of the [[solar nebula]], along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed soon afterwards. Initially molten, the outer layer of the planet cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity produced the primordial atmosphere; condensing [[water vapor]], augmented by [[ice]] delivered by [[comet]]s, [[Origin of the world's oceans|produced the oceans]].<ref>A. Morbidelli ''et al'', 2000, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000M&PS...35.1309M Source Regions and Time Scales for the Delivery of Water to Earth]", ''Meteoritics & Planetary Science'', vol. 35, no. 6, pp. 1309-1320.</ref> The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half a billion years later, the [[last universal common ancestor|last common ancestor of all life]] lived.<ref>W. Ford Doolitte,  "Uprooting the Tree of Life", ''Scientific American'', Feb. 2000.</ref>

The development of [[photosynthesis]] allowed the sun's energy to be harvested directly; the resultant [[oxygen]] accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the [[ozone layer]]. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the [[endosymbiotic theory|development of complex cells]] called [[eukaryotes]].<ref>L. V. Berkner, L. C. Marshall, 1965, "On the Origin and Rise of Oxygen Concentration in the Earth's Atmosphere", ''Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences'', Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 225<U+2013>261.</ref> Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful [[ultraviolet radiation]], life colonized the surface of Earth.

Over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke up as the surface of Earth continually reshaped itself. The continents have migrated across the surface of the Earth, occasionally combining to form a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], 600-540 [[Mya (unit)|mya]], then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart 180 mya.<ref>J.B. Murphy, R.D. Nance, "[http://scienceweek.com/2004/sa040730-5.htm How do supercontinents assemble?]", ''American Scentist'', vol. 92, pp. 324-333.</ref>

Since the 1960s it has been hypothesized that a severe [[Glacier|glacial]] action between [[1 E16 s|750 and 580 million years ago]], during the [[Neoproterozoic]], covered much of the planet in a sheet of ice. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] when multi-cellular lifeforms began to proliferate.<ref> J.L. Kirschvink, 1992, "Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth", ''The Proterozoic Biosphere'', pp 51-52.</ref>

Since the [[Cambrian explosion]], about 535 million years ago, there were 5 distinct [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]].<ref>D. Raup & J. Sepkoski, 1982, "Mass extinctions in the marine
fossil record", ''Science'', vol. 215, pp. 1501<U+2013>1503.</ref> The last one occurred 65 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the (non-avian) [[dinosaur]]s and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as [[mammal]]s, which then resembled shrews. Over the last 65 million years, mammalian life diversified, and several million years ago, a small African ape gained the ability to stand upright. As [[brain]] size increased, these hominids developed the use of tools and language. The development of agriculture, and then civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth in a short timespan like no other life form had before, affecting both the nature and quantity of other life forms as well as global climate.

==Physical characteristics== [[Image:Earth.PNG|300px|right]]
When viewed from [[outer space]], much of the Earth has a deep blue and white appearance, caused by the oceans and clouds in the atmosphere. It has an [[albedo]] of 36.7%, which is exceeded only by [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] among the inner planets of the [[solar system]]. It is also the largest and densest of the inner planets.

===Atmosphere===
{{main|Earth's atmosphere}}
The [[atmospheric pressure]] on the surface of the Earth averages 101.3 [[Pascal|kPa]], with a [[scale height]] of about 6 km. It is 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], with trace amounts of other gaseous molecules such as water vapor. The atmosphere protects the Earth's life forms by absorbing [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], moderating temperature extremes, transporting water vapor, and providing useful gases.

<!-- This section has been moved to the article '''[[Structure of the Earth]]'''. A new 30-line summary section must be written from this main article to this "Physical characteristics" section. Help is welcome. -->
The Earth's shape is that of an [[oblate]] [[spheroid]], with an average diameter of approximately 12,742 km (~ 40,000 km / [[pi|<U+03C0>]]).<ref>"Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80)", ''XVII General Assembly'', International Association of Geodesy.</ref> The planet's curvature is visible from some regions on the surface such as the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in the [[United States]]. The Earth consists of several [[atmospheric]], [[hydrologic]], and many [[geologic]] layers. Its components are the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], and its [[core]]. The [[biosphere]] is a tiny layer in this composition and is usually not considered part of the physical layers of the Earth.

==Earth in the solar system==
[[Image:Rotating earth (small).gif|thumb|left|150px|An animation showing the rotation of the Earth.]]
It takes the Earth, on average, 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.091 seconds ([[sidereal day|1 sidereal day]]) to rotate around the [[Axis_of_rotation|axis]] connecting the [[north pole]] and the [[south pole]]. From Earth the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in the sky (except [[meteor]]s which are within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites) is the movement to the west at a rate of 15 &deg;/h = 15'/min, i.e., a Sun or Moon diameter every two minutes.

Earth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days ([[sidereal year|1 sidereal year]]). From Earth, this gives an apparent movement of the Sun with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1 &deg;/day, i.e., a Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours, eastward. The orbital speed of the Earth averages about 30 km/s (108,000 km/h), which is enough to cover one Earth diameter (~12,600 km) in 7 minutes, and one distance to the Moon (384,000 km) in 4 hours.

Earth has one [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], which revolves with the Earth around a common [[barycenter]], from fixed star to fixed star, every 27.32 days. When combined with the Earth-Moon system's common revolution around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. The [[Hill sphere]] (sphere of influence) of the Earth is about 1.5 Gm (930,000 miles) in radius.

Viewed from Earth's north pole, the motion of Earth, its moon and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]]. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.5 degrees against the Earth-Sun plane (which causes the [[season]]s); and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted about 5 degrees against the Earth-Sun plane (otherwise there would be an eclipse every month).

In an inertial reference frame, the Earth's axis undergoes a slow [[precession]]al motion with a period of some 25,800 years, as well as a [[nutation]] with a main period of 18.6 years. These motions are caused by the differential attraction of Sun and Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge, due to its oblateness. In a reference frame attached to the solid body of the Earth, its rotation is also slightly irregular due to [[polar motion]]. The polar motion is quasi-periodic, containing an annual component and a component with a 14-month period called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Also, the rotational velocity varies, a phenomenon known as [[Day|length of day]] variation.

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] is always about [[January 3]], and [[aphelion]] is about [[July 4]] (near the [[solstice]]s, which are on about [[December 21]] and [[June 21]]). For other eras, see [[precession]] and [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The Earth is sometimes referred to as the '''Third Planet from the Sun''' because, of the nine planets of our solar system, Earth is the third closest planet to the sun.

===Magnetic field===
{{main|Earth's magnetic field}}
The [[Earth's magnetic field]] is shaped roughly as a [[magnetic dipole]] with the poles currently located proximate to the planet's geographic poles. The field forms the [[Magnetosphere]] that deflects particles in the [[solar wind]]. The [[bow shock]] is located approximately 13.5 R<sub>E</sub>. The collision between the magnetic field and the solar wind forms the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, a pair of concentric, [[torus]]-shaped regions of energetic [[charged particle]]s. When the [[plasma]] enters the Earth's atmosphere at the magnetic poles, it forms [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]].

The Moon, sometimes called 'Luna', is a relatively large terrestrial planet-like satellite, whose diameter is about one-quarter of the Earth's. With the exception of [[Pluto|Pluto's]] [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], it is the largest moon in the Solar system relative to the size of its planet. The [[natural satellite]]s orbiting other planets are called "moons", after Earth's Moon.

The gravitational attraction between the Earth and Moon cause the [[tides]] on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: Its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit the Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s: The dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].

Due to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 [[Millimetre|mm]] per year. The Earth's day also lengthens by about 17 [[Microsecond|<U+00B5>s]] every year. Over millions of years these tiny modifications can add up to significant changes. So for example, during the [[Devonian]] period there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.

[[Image:Earth-moon.jpg|thumb|right|''Earthrise'' as seen from lunar orbit on ''[[Apollo 8]]'', [[24 December]] [[1968]]. Due to [[tidal locking]], from any point on the Moon's surface, the Earth does not rise or set, but is always located in the same position in the sky.]]
The Moon may dramatically affect the development of life by taming the weather. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's [[axial tilt]] is stabilised by tidal interactions with the Moon.<ref>Laskar, J., Robutel, P., Joutel, F., Gastineau, M., Correia, A.C.M., Levrard, B., 2004, "[http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/aa/abs/2004/46/aa1335/aa1335.html A long term numerical solution for the insolation quantities of the Earth]", ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', 428, pp. 261-285.</ref> Some theorists believe that, without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to the Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, as it appears to be with [[Mars (planet)|Mars]]. If Earth's axis of rotation were to approach the [[ecliptic|plane of the ecliptic]], extremely severe [[weather]] could result, as this would make seasonal differences extreme. One pole would be pointed directly toward the Sun during ''summer'' and directly away during ''winter''. [[Planetary science|Planetary scientists]] who have studied the effect claim that this might kill all large animal and higher plant life.<ref>Williams, D.M., J.F. Kasting, 1997, "Habitable planets with high obliquities", ''Icarus'' 129, 254-268.</ref> This remains a controversial subject, however, and further studies of Mars&mdash;which shares Earth's [[sidereal day|rotation period]] and [[axial tilt]], but not its large moon or liquid core&mdash;may provide additional insight.

The Moon is just far enough away to have, when seen from Earth, very nearly the same apparent angular size as the Sun (the Sun is 400 times larger, but the Moon is 400 times closer). This allows total [[eclipse]]s and annular eclipses to occur on Earth.

<div style="clear: both" />
[[Image:Earth-Moon.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The relative sizes of and distance between Earth and Moon, to scale.]]

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant impact theory]], states that it was formed from the collision of a Mars-size [[protoplanet]] with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements, and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of the Earth's crust.

Earth also has at least two [[co-orbital satellite|co-orbital satellites]], the [[asteroid|asteroids]] [[3753 Cruithne]] and [[2002 AA29|2002 AA<sub>29</sub>]].

==Plate tectonics==
{{main|Plate tectonics}}[[Image:Plate tectonics map.gif|thumb|right|380px|A map pointing out the Earth's major plates.]] 
'''Plate tectonics''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "one who constructs and destroys", <U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD>, ''tektoon'') is a [[theory]] of [[geology]] developed to explain the phenomenon of [[continental drift]] and is currently the theory accepted by the vast majority of scientists working in this area. In the theory of plate tectonics the outermost part of the [[Earth]]'s interior is made up of two layers: the [[lithosphere]] comprising the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the solidified uppermost part of the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]]. Below the lithosphere lies the [[asthenosphere]] which comprises the inner viscous part of the mantle. The mantle behaves like a superheated and extremely viscous liquid.


The lithosphere essentially ''floats'' on the asthenosphere. The lithosphere is broken up into what are called [[tectonic plate]]s. These plates move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: [[Convergent boundary|convergent]], [[Divergent boundary|divergent]], and [[Transform fault|transform]]. [[Earthquake]]s, [[volcano|volcanic activity]], [[mountain]]-building, and [[oceanic trench]] formation occur along plate boundaries. 

<br clear="all">
{|align="center"
|[[Image:Oceanic-continental convergence Fig21oceancont.svg|thumb|Oceanic / Continental]]
|[[Image:Continental-continental convergence Fig21contcont.gif|thumb|Continental / Continental]]
|[[Image:Oceanic-oceanic convergence Fig21oceanocean.gif|thumb|Oceanic / Oceanic]]
|}

Plate tectonic theory arose out of two separate geological observations: [[continental drift]], noticed in the early 20th century, and [[seafloor spreading]], noticed in the 1960s. The theory itself was developed during the late 1960s and has since been universally accepted by virtually all scientists. The theory has revolutionized the [[earth science]]s comparable in its unifying and explanatory power for diverse geological phenomena as was the development of the [[periodic table]] for [[chemistry]], the discovery of the [[genetic code]] for [[biology]], and [[quantum mechanics]] in [[physics]].

== Environment and ecosystem ==
{{main|Biosphere}}

The planet's lifeforms are sometimes said to form a "[[biosphere]]". This biosphere is generally believed to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about 3.5 billion (3.5{{e|9}}) years ago. Earth is the only place in the universe where life is absolutely known to exist, and  some scientists believe that [[Rare Earth hypothesis|biospheres might be rare]].

The biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]]. On land, biomes are separated primarily by [[latitude]]. Terrestrial biomes lying within the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle]]s are relatively barren of [[plant]] and [[animal]] life, while most of the more populous biomes lie near the [[Equator]].
[[Image:90 mile beach.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A familiar [[beach|scene]] on Earth which simultaneously shows the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.]]

=== Climate ===
{{main|Climate}}

The most prominent features of the earth's climate are its two large polar regions, two narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial [[tropical]] to [[subtropical]] region. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] patterns vary widely, ranging from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre.

Ocean currents are important factors in determining climate, particularly the spectacular [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.

=== Terrain ===
The Earth's [[terrain]] can vary greatly from place to place. Covered with about 70% water, much of the Earth's [[continental shelf]] is below sea level. If all of the land on Earth were spread evenly, then water would rise higher than the [[Statue of Liberty]].<ref>The average depth is, in fact, significantly greater than the statue of liberty. Letting the average depth be approximately equal to water volume divided by the Earth's surface area: the total volume of water is about 1.4 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> km<sup>3</sup>; the total area of Earth is about 5.1 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> km<sup>2</sup>. So the average depth would be roughly 2.8 km, whereas the statue of liberty is only 0.093 km, including the pedestal.</ref> The remaining 30% that is dry land has [[mountains]], [[deserts]], [[plain|plains]], [[plateau]]s, etc.

Currently the total arable land is 13.31% of the land surface, with only 4.71% supporting permanent crops.<ref name="cia" /> Close to 40% of the Earth's land surface is presently used for cropland and pasture, or an estimated 3.3 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> [[acre]]s of cropland and 8.4 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> acres of pastureland pastureland.<ref>FAO, 1995, "United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization Production Yearbook", 49.</ref>

=== Natural resources ===
{{main|Natural resource}}

* Earth's crust contains large deposits of [[fossil fuel]]s: ([[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[methane clathrate]]). These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production.
* Mineral [[ore]] bodies have been formed in Earth's crust by the action of [[erosion]] and [[plate tectonics]]. These bodies form concentrated sources for many [[metal]]s and other useful [[chemical element|element]]s.
* Earth's [[biosphere]] produces many useful biological products, including (but far from limited to) [[food]], [[wood]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends upon [[topsoil]] and fresh water, and the oceanic [[ecosystem]] depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.

Some of these resources, such as [[fossil fuel|mineral fuel]]s, are difficult to replenish on a short time scale, called [[non-renewable resources]]. The exploitation of non-renewable resources by human [[civilization]] has become a subject of significant controversy in modern [[environmentalism]] movements.

=== Natural and environmental hazards ===

Large areas are subject to extreme [[weather]] such as (tropical [[cyclone]]s), [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas. Many places are subject to [[earthquake]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], [[tornado]]es, [[sinkhole]]s, [[blizzard]]s, [[flood]]s, [[drought]]s, and other calamities and [[disaster]]s.

Large areas are subject to human-made [[pollution]] of the air and water, [[acid rain]] and toxic substances, loss of vegetation ([[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]]), loss of [[wildlife]], [[species]] [[extinction]], [[soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], soil depletion, [[erosion]], and introduction of [[invasive species]].

Long-term [[climate]] [[global warming|alteration]] due to enhancement of the [[greenhouse effect]] by human industrial [[carbon dioxide]] emissions is an increasing concern, the focus of intense study and debate.

=== Human geography ===

Projections indicate that the [[world population|world's human population]] will reach seven billion in 2013 and 9.1 billion in 2050 (2005 [[United Nations|UN]] estimates). Most of the growth is expected to take place in [[developing nations]]. Human [[population density]] varies widely around the world.

It is estimated that only one eighth of the surface of the Earth is suitable for [[human]]s to live on &mdash; three-quarters is covered by [[ocean]]s, and half of the land area is [[desert]], high [[mountain]]s or other unsuitable terrain.

The northernmost settlement in the world is [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]], [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Canada]]. The southernmost is the [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]], in [[Antarctica]], almost exactly at the [[South Pole]].

There are 267 administrative divisions, including nations, dependent areas, other, and miscellaneous entries. Earth does not have a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[government]] with planet-wide authority. Independent sovereign [[nation]]s claim all of the land surface except for some segments of [[Antarctica]]. There is a worldwide general [[international organization]], the [[United Nations]]. The United Nations is primarily an international discussion forum with only limited ability to pass and enforce [[international law|law]]s.

In total, about four hundred people have been outside the Earth's atmosphere as of [[2004]], and of these, twelve have walked on the [[Moon]]. ''See [[space exploration]].''

== Descriptions of Earth ==

Earth has often been personified as a [[deity]], in particular a [[goddess]] (''see [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and [[Mother Earth]]''). The [[China|Chinese]] Earth goddess [[Hou-Tu]] is similar to Gaia, the deification of the Earth. As the patroness of fertility, her element is Earth. In [[Norse mythology]], the Earth goddess [[Jord]] was the mother of [[Thor]] and the daughter of [[Annar]].  Ancient Egyptian mythology is different than that of other cultures because Earth is male, [[Geb]], and sky is female, [[Nut]].

Although commonly thought to be a sphere, the earth is actually an [[oblate spheroid]]. It bulges slightly at the equator and is slightly flattened at the poles. In the past there were varying levels of belief in a [[flat Earth]], but ancient [[Greek philosophers]] and, in the [[Middle Ages]], thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] believed that [[Spherical Earth|it was spherical]].

A 19th-century organization called the [[Flat Earth Society]] advocated the even-then discredited idea that the Earth was actually [[disc]]-shaped, with the [[North Pole]] at its center and a 150-[[foot]] (50 [[meter]]) high wall of ice at the outer edge. It and similar organizations continued to promote this idea, based on religious beliefs and [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], through the 1970s. Today, the subject is more frequently treated [[tongue-in-cheek]] or with mockery.

Prior to the introduction of [[space flight]], these inaccurate beliefs were countered with deductions based on observations of the secondary effects of the Earth's shape and parallels drawn with the shape of other planets. [[Cartography]], the study and practice of mapmaking, and vicariously [[geography]], have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting the Earth. [[Surveying]], the determination of locations and distances, and to a somewhat lesser extent [[navigation]], the determination of position and direction, have developed alongside cartography and geography, providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information.

The technological developments of the latter half of the 20th century are widely considered to have altered the public's perception of the Earth. Before space flight, the popular image of Earth was of a green world. [[Science fiction]] artist [[Frank R. Paul]] provided perhaps the first image of a cloudless ''blue'' planet (with sharply defined land masses) on the back cover of the July 1940 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', a common depiction for several decades thereafter.

</ref> [[Apollo 17]]'s 1972 "[[The Blue Marble|Blue Marble]]" photograph of Earth from [[cislunar space]] became the current iconic image of the planet as a marble of cloud-swirled blue ocean broken by green-brown continents. A photo taken of a distant Earth by ''[[Voyager 1]]'' in 1990 inspired [[Carl Sagan]] to describe the planet as a "[[Pale Blue Dot]]".

Earth has also been described as a massive [[spaceship]], with a [[life support system]] that requires maintenance, or as having a [[biosphere]] that forms one large [[organism]]. ''See [[Spaceship Earth]] and [[Gaia theory]].''

In the fictional ''[[Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy]]'', Earth's entire entry consists of a single word <U+2014> "harmless" <U+2014> emphasizing its insignificance in the cosmos. Later in the eponymous science fiction series, this humbling consideration is alleviated slightly when the entry is updated to read "mostly harmless". The Earth is also a computer to search for the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.

==Earth's future==
<!-- Red giants can have different diameters depending on their mass and the stage of evolution. -->
[[Image:redgiants.jpg|thumb|200px|Comparison between the red giant [[Antares]] and the Sun. The black circle is the size of the orbit of Mars.]]
The most probable cause for the Earth's destruction will take place when the [[Sun]] as part of its solar lifespan, expands to a [[Red Giant]]. Current models predict that the Sun will expand out to about 99% of the distance to the Earth's present orbit (1 [[Astronomical Unit]], or AU). However by that time the orbit of the Earth will expand to about 1.7 [[Astronomical Unit|AUs]] due to mass loss by the Sun, and so the planet will escape envelopment.<ref name="sun_future">I.J. Sackmann, A.I. Boothroyd, K.E. Kraemer, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1993ApJ...418..457S Our Sun. III. Present and Future.]", ''Astrophysical Journal'', vol. 418, pp. 457.</ref> This event is estimated to take place in 5 billion years. (5&nbsp;[[Gigayear|Gyr]]).

Before reaching the Red Giant stage, however, the [[Solar luminosity|luminosity of the Sun]] will continue to steadily increase. It will grow from the current luminosity by 10% in 1.1 Gyr and up to 40% in 3.5 Gyr.<ref name="sun_future" /> Climate models show that a steady increase in radiation reaching the Earth are likely to have dire consequences, including possible loss of the oceans.<ref>J.F. Kasting, 1988, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988Icar...74..472K Runaway and Moist Greenhouse Atmospheres and the Evolution of Earth and Venus]", ''Icarus'', 74, pp. 472-494.</ref>
