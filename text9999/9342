'''Hurricane Grace''' was a short-lived [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2]] hurricane that contributed to the formation of the powerful [[1991 Perfect Storm]]. Forming on October 26, Grace initially had [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical origins]], meaning it was partially [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] and partially [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] in nature. It became a tropical cyclone on October 27, and ultimately peaked with winds of {{convert|85|kn|mph km/h|-1}}. The storm had minor effects on the island of [[Bermuda]] as it passed to the south. A developing [[extratropical storm]] to the north turned Grace eastward; the hurricane was eventually absorbed into the large circulation of the larger low pressure system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Maa|first1=Jerome P.

==Meteorological history==
[[File:Grace and H8 1991 track.png|200px|left|thumb|Respective tracks of Hurricane Grace, bottom, and the subsequent nor'easter, top|alt=Map of the western Atlantic Ocean depicting two storm tracks]]
The origins of Grace go back to a [[cold-core low|mid-level area of low pressure]] that formed on October 23 to the south of [[Bermuda]]. Reports from a nearby ship indicated that the low had become a [[surface weather analysis|surface feature]] by October 25. The storm system initially contained [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical characteristics]], and the center of circulation lacked deep [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] for several days. The system was designated a subtropical storm on October 26. An area of clouds near Bermuda became increasingly convective, and gradually became entrained into the expanding and developing circulation of the subtropical storm. Thunderstorm activity persisted near the center, and on October 27, the storm attained [[tropical cyclone|tropical storm status]] and was named Grace.<ref name="TCR1">{{cite web|author=Edward Rappaport|title=Hurricane Grace Preliminary Report Page 1|date=November 13, 1991|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991-prelim/grace/prelim01.gif}}</ref>

Grace continued to organize and intensify; based on satellite intensity estimates and [[reconnaissance]] reports, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane, the lowest level on the [[Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale]].<ref name="TCR2">{{cite web|author=Edward Rappaport|title=Hurricane Grace Preliminary Report Page 2|date=November 13, 1991|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991-prelim/grace/prelim02.gif}}</ref> Grace reached its peak intensity with winds of {{convert|85|kn|mph km/h|-1}} and a minimum central [[barometric pressure]] of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg), ranking as a Category 2.<ref name="TCR4"/> Operationally, however, the peak intensity was thought to have been 65 knots (75 mph; 120 km/h), which would have made it a mere Category 1 at its peak strength.<ref>{{cite web|author=Harold Gerrish|title=Hurricane Grace Discussion Number 3|date=October 27, 1991|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991/grace/tropdisc/nal1191.003}}</ref> The hurricane tracked generally northwestward until October 28, when an [[extratropical cyclone]] formed along an approaching [[weather front|cold front]] off the [[New England]] coast. This storm rapidly intensified and influenced Grace's steering currents, turning the hurricane sharply east.<ref name="history">{{cite news|author=|title=Ingredients for a real 'perfect storm'|date=October 30, 2000|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/movies/ps/perfectstorm.htm}}</ref> At around the same time, an [[eye (cyclone)|eye feature]] associated with Hurricane Grace became apparent on satellite imagery, despite a lack of strong convective activity around the storm's center.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch|title=Hurricane Grace Discussion Number 5|date=October 28, 1991|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991/grace/tropdisc/nal1191.005}}</ref> Grace accelerated as it continued eastward, and reached its peak intensity of Category 2 status on October 29. However, the storm's rapid forward movement led to an asymmetrical circulation. The center passed approximately {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Bermuda without significantly affecting the island.<ref name="TCR2"/>

Hurricane Grace turned northeast later that day, as the rapidly approaching cold front undermined the storm's lower-level center. The system became overtaken by the front and subsequently lost its status as a tropical system.<ref name="TCR3"/> It moved north along the front and merged with the large cyclone to the north.<ref name="history"/> The remnants of Grace became completely indistinguishable by the next day as it was completely absorbed by the passing [[extratropical storm]] on October 30.<ref name="history2">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|title=The Perfect Storm|date=November 13, 1991|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/satellite/satelliteseye/cyclones/pfctstorm91/pfctstorm.html}}</ref> The nor'easter significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity associated with the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low-pressure system continued deepening as it drifted southeastward and then southwestward towards the United States. The cyclone attained its peak intensity 390 miles (630&nbsp;km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, with winds of up to {{convert|60|kn|mph km/h|-1}}. The storm became known as the [[1991 Perfect Storm]], or more commonly, the "Perfect Storm".<ref name="history"/><ref name="history2"/>

In advance of Hurricane Grace, a [[tropical storm warning]] was issued for Bermuda on October 27. The following day, about 10 hours before the storm's closest approach to the island, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a [[hurricane warning]]. On October 29, the hurricane warning was lowered to a tropical storm warning, which was amended to a [[gale warning]] shortly thereafter.<ref name="TCR4">{{cite web|author=Edward Rappaport|title=Hurricane Grace Preliminary Report Page 4|date=November 13, 1991|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991-prelim/grace/prelim04.gif}}</ref><ref name="TCR7">{{cite web|author=Edward Rappaport|title=Hurricane Grace Preliminary Report Page 7|date=November 13, 1991|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991-prelim/grace/prelim07.gif}}</ref> The island experienced [[rainband|bands]] of squally weather in association with the storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Bermuda Braces for Brush with Hurricane Grace|date=October 29, 1991|publisher=''St. Paul Pioneer Press''|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB5DB42D312BD55&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM}}</ref> Precipitation peaked at {{convert|3.21|in|mm|abbr=on}}.{{Tropical Cyclone Point Maxima}} However, no significant damage was reported.<ref name="TCR3"/> A yacht traveling from Bermuda to New York encountered strong winds and {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} seas well off the [[Virginia]] coast; its nine occupants were rescued by [[Coast Guard]] helicopters.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Crew of New Bedford boat rescued; 13 others taken from yachts hit by Grace|date=October 29, 1991|publisher=''Providence Journal''|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/579224131.html?dids=579224131:579224131&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+29%2C+1991&author=Journal-Bulletin+Staff+and+Wire+Reports&pub=The+Providence+Journal&desc=Crew+of+New+Bedford+boat+rescued%3B+13+others+taken+from+yachts+hit+by+Grace&pqatl=google}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Grace Bypasses Bermuda, Heads Out Into the Atlantic|date=October 30, 1991|publisher=''Orlando Sentinel''|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/89037365.html?dids=89037365:89037365&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+30%2C+1991&author=Associated+Press&pub=Orlando+Sentinel&desc=GRACE+BYPASSES+BERMUDA%2C+HEADS+OUT+INTO+THE+ATLANTIC&pqatl=google}}</ref>

Because of its large size, Grace generated large swells along the [[U.S. East Coast|East Coast]] of the United States;<ref name="TCR3">{{cite web|author=Edward Rappaport|title=Hurricane Grace Preliminary Report Page 3|date=November 13, 1991|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 13, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1991-prelim/grace/prelim03.gif}}</ref> combined with abnormally high tides, these waves reached at least {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

Despite the light impacts from Hurricane Grace, the resultant nor'easter caused extensive coastal damage, high seas, and powerful winds. Hurricane-force wind gusts were reported in New England. The storm churned the ocean for several days; a wave {{convert|101|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height was reported by an offshore buoy. Extensive coastal flooding occurred along the coast of the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[Northeast U.S.|Northeastern]] U.S., with effects as far north as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and as far south as [[Jamaica]]. The nor'easter eventually transitioned into another [[1991 unnamed hurricane|hurricane]] that made landfall in [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name="history"/> A ship known as the ''[[Andrea Gail]]'' was lost, along with her six crew members, during the storm. The story of the ''Andrea Gail'' inspired [[Sebastian Junger]]'s 1997 book, ''[[The Perfect Storm (book)|The Perfect Storm]]'', and a [[The Perfect Storm (film)|2000 motion picture film]].<ref name="history2"/>
