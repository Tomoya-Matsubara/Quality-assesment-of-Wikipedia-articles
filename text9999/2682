The city is notable for its rich [[Ancient Greece|Greek history]], [[Greek culture|culture]], [[amphitheatre]]s, [[architecture]], and as the birthplace of the preeminent [[mathematician]] and [[engineer]] [[Archimedes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/archimedes.shtml|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/archimedes.shtml}}</ref>  This 2,700-year-old city played a key role in ancient times, when it was one of the major powers of the [[Mediterranean]] world.  Syracuse is located in the southeast corner of the island of [[Sicily]], right by the Gulf of Syracuse next to the [[Ionian Sea]].

The city was founded by [[Ancient Greek]] [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]ians and [[Tenea]]ns<ref name=stra /> and became a very powerful [[city-state]]. Syracuse was allied with [[History of Sparta|Sparta]] and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] and exerted influence over the entirety of [[Magna Graecia]], of which it was the most important city.

After this [[Palermo]] overtook it in importance, as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Eventually the kingdom would be united with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] to form the [[Two Sicilies]] until the [[Italian unification]] of 1860.

In the modern day, the city is listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] along with the [[Necropolis of Pantalica]]. In the central area, the city itself has a population of around 125,000 people. The inhabitants are known as ''Siracusans''. Syracuse is mentioned in the [[Bible]] in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] book at 28:12 as [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] stayed there.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://members.datafast.net.au/sggram/f763.htm|publisher=SimplyBible.com|title=Acts Facts: Syracuse|date=8 January 2008}}</ref> The [[patron saint]] of the city is [[Saint Lucy]]; she was born in Syracuse and her feast day, [[Saint Lucy's Day]], is celebrated on 13 December.

Syracuse and its surrounding area have been inhabited since ancient times, as shown by the findings in the villages of Stentinello, Ognina, Plemmirio, Matrensa, Cozzo Pantano and ''Thapsos'', which already had a relationship with [[Mycenaean Greece]].

Syracuse was founded in 734 or 733&nbsp;BC by Greek settlers from [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] and [[Tenea]], led by the ''oecist'' (colonizer) [[Archias of Corinth|Archias]].There are many attested variants of the name of the city including {{lang|grc|<U+03A3><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B9>}} Syrakousai, {{lang|grc|<U+03A3><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B9>}} Syrakosai and {{lang|grc|<U+03A3><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03CE>}} Syrako.<ref name=SyrakousaiLSJ/> A possible origin of the city's name was given by [[Vibius Sequester]] citing<ref name=VibiusS>{{cite book|title=De Fluminibus Fontibus Lacubus Nemoribus Paludibus Montibus Gentibus quorum apud poeta mentio fit|author=Vibius Sequester|url=http://archive.org/stream/vibiussequester00sequgoog#page/n313/mode/2up|page=287|chapter=Tyraca|publisher=apud Amandum K<U+00F6>nig}}</ref> first [[Stephanus Byzantius]]<ref name=SyrakousaiLSJ/><ref name=SBEthnika>''Ethnika'' 592.18-21,593.1-8, i.e. [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Stephanus Byzantinus]]' ''Ethnika'' (kat'epitomen), lemma {{lang|grc|<U+03A3><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B9>}} {{cite book|title=Stephani Byzantii Ethnicorvm quae svpersvnt|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MMZiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA592#v=onepage&q&f=false|editor-last=Meineke|editor-first=Augustus|editor-link=Augustus Meineke|pages=592<U+2013>593|publisher=Impensis G. Reimeri|volume=Prior}}</ref> in that there was a Syracusian marsh ({{lang|grc|<U+03BB><U+03AF><U+03BC><U+03BD><U+03B7>}}) called ''Syrako'' and secondly [[Marcian of Heraclea|Marcian's]] ''Periegesis'' wherein Archias gave the city the name of a nearby marsh; hence one gets ''Syrako'' (and thereby ''Syrakousai'' and other variants) for the name of Syracuse, a name also attested by [[Epicharmus]].<ref name=SyrakousaiLSJ/><ref name=EpicharmusFr>{{cite book|title=Epicharmi Fragmenta|url=http://ia700509.us.archive.org/15/items/fragmenta00epic/fragmenta00epic.djvu|page=111|publisher=apud Vincentium Loosjes}}</ref> The nucleus of the ancient city was the small island of ''Ortygia''. The settlers found the land fertile and the [[Sicels|native tribes]] to be reasonably well-disposed to their presence. The city grew and prospered, and for some time stood as the most powerful Greek city anywhere in the [[Mediterranean]]. Colonies were founded at [[Palazzolo Acreide|Akrai]] (664&nbsp;BC), [[Kasmenai]] (643&nbsp;BC), [[Akrillai]] (7th century&nbsp;BC), [[Helorus]] (7th century&nbsp;BC) and [[Kamarina, Sicily|Kamarina]] (598&nbsp;BC).

The descendants of the first colonists, called ''Gamoroi'', held power until they were expelled by the ''Killichiroi'', the lower class of the city. The former, however, returned to power in 485&nbsp;BC, thanks to the help of [[Gelo]], ruler of [[Gela]]. Gelo himself became the despot of the city, and moved many inhabitants of Gela, Kamarina and Megera to Syracuse, building the new quarters of Tyche and Neapolis outside the walls. His program of new constructions included a new theatre, designed by [[Damocopos]], which gave the city a flourishing cultural life: this in turn attracted personalities as [[Aeschylus]], Ario of [[Metimma]], Eumelos of Corinth and [[Sappho]], who had been exiled here from [[Mytilene]]. The enlarged power of Syracuse made unavoidable the clash against the [[Carthaginian]]s, who ruled western Sicily. In the [[Battle of Himera (480&nbsp;BC)|Battle of Himera]], Gelo, who had allied with Theron of [[Agrigento]], decisively defeated the African force led by [[Hamilcar]]. A [[temple]] dedicated to [[Athena]] (on the site of today's Cathedral), was erected in the city to commemorate the event

Syracuse grew considerably during this time. Its walls encircled {{convert|120|ha}} in the fifth century, but as early as the 470's&nbsp;BC the inhabitants started building outside the walls. The complete population of its territory approximately numbered 250,000 in 415&nbsp;BC and the population size of the city itself was probably similar to Athens.<ref name=morr />

Gelo was succeeded by his brother [[Hiero I of Syracuse|Hiero]], who [[Battle of Cumae|fought]] against the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] at [[Cumae]] in 474&nbsp;BC. His rule was eulogized by poets like [[Simonides of Ceos]], [[Bacchylides]] and [[Pindar]], who visited his court. A democratic regime was introduced by [[Thrasybulus of Syracuse|Thrasybulos]] (467&nbsp;BC).{{fact|date=April 2014}} The city continued to expand in [[Sicily]], fighting against the rebellious [[Siculi]], and on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], making expeditions up to [[Corsica]] and [[Elba]]. In the late 5th century&nbsp;BC, Syracuse found itself at war with [[Athens]], which sought more resources to fight the [[Peloponnesian War]]. The Syracusans enlisted the aid of a general from [[Sparta]], Athens' foe in the war, to defeat the Athenians, destroy their ships, and leave them to starve on the island (see [[Sicilian Expedition]]). In 401&nbsp;BC, Syracuse contributed a force of 3,000 [[hoplites]] and a general to [[Cyrus the Younger]]'s [[Army of the Ten Thousand]].

Then in the early 4th century&nbsp;BC, the [[tyrant]] [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius the Elder]] was again at war against [[Carthage]] and, although losing Gela and Camarina, kept that power from capturing the whole of Sicily. After the end of the conflict Dionysius built a massive fortress on the [[Ortygia]] island of the city and 22&nbsp;km-long walls around all of Syracuse. Another period of expansion saw the destruction of [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]], [[Catania]] and [[Lentini]]; then Syracuse entered again in war against Carthage (397&nbsp;BC). After various changes of fortune, the Carthaginians managed to besiege Syracuse itself, but were eventually pushed back by a pestilence. A treaty in 392&nbsp;BC allowed Syracuse to enlarge further its possessions, founding the cities of Adrano, Tindari and [[Taormina|Tauromenos]], and conquering [[Reggio Calabria|Rhegion]] on the continent. In the [[Adriatic]], to facilitate trade, [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius the Elder]] founded [[Ancona]], [[Adria]] and [[Vis (island)|Issa]]. Apart from his battle deeds, Dionysius was famous as a patron of art, and [[Plato]] himself visited Syracuse several times.

His successor was [[Dionysius II of Syracuse|Dionysius the Younger]], who was however expelled by [[Dion (tyrant of Syracuse)|Dion]] in 356&nbsp;BC. But the latter's despotic rule led in turn to his expulsion, and Dionysius reclaimed his throne in 347&nbsp;BC. A democratic government was installed by [[Timoleon]] in 345&nbsp;BC. The long series of internal struggles had weakened Syracuse's power on the island, and Timoleon tried to remedy this, defeating the Carthaginians in the [[Battle of the Crimissus]] (339&nbsp;BC). But the struggle among the city's parties restarted after his death and ended with the rise of another tyrant, [[Agathocles]], who seized power with a coup in 317&nbsp;BC. He resumed the war against Carthage, with alternate fortunes. However he scored a moral success, bringing the war to the Carthaginians' native African soil, inflicting heavy losses to the enemy. The war ended with another treaty of peace which did not prevent the Carthaginians from interfering in the politics of Syracuse after the death of Agathocles (289&nbsp;BC). The citizens called [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] for help. After a brief period under the rule of Epirus, [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]] seized power in 275&nbsp;BC.

Hiero inaugurated a period of 50 years of peace and prosperity, in which Syracuse became one of the most renowned capitals of Antiquity. He issued the so-called ''[[Lex Hieronica]]'', which was later adopted by the Romans for their administration of Sicily; he also had the theatre enlarged and a new immense [[altar]], the "Hiero's Ara", built. Under his rule lived the most famous Syracusan, the mathematician and [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] [[Archimedes]]. Among his many inventions were various military engines including the [[claw of Archimedes]], later used to resist the [[Siege of Syracuse (214<U+2013>212&nbsp;BC)|Roman siege]] of 214&nbsp;BC<U+2013>212&nbsp;BC. Literary figures included [[Theocritus]] and others.

Hiero's successor, the young [[Hieronymus of Syracuse|Hieronymus]] (ruled from 215&nbsp;BC), broke the alliance with the Romans after their defeat at the [[Battle of Cannae]] and accepted [[Carthage]]'s support. The Romans, led by consul [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], [[Siege of Syracuse (214<U+2013>212&nbsp;BC)|besieged the city]] in 214&nbsp;BC. The city held out for three years, but fell in 212&nbsp;BC. The successes of the Syracusians in repelling the Roman siege had made them overconfident. In 212&nbsp;BC, the Romans received information that the city's inhabitants were to participate in the annual festival to their goddess Artemis. A small party of Roman soldiers approached the city under the cover of night and managed to scale the walls to get into the outer city and with reinforcements soon took control, killing Archimedes in the process, but the main fortress remained firm. After an eight-month siege and with parleys in progress, an Iberian captain named Moeriscus is believed to have let the Romans in near the Fountains of Arethusa. On the agreed signal, during a diversionary attack, he opened the gate. After setting guards on the houses of the pro-Roman faction, Marcellus gave Syracuse to plunder.

===Imperial Roman and Byzantine period===

[[File:Sicilia Siracusa1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Piazza Duomo.]]
Though declining slowly by the years, Syracuse maintained the status of capital of the Roman government of Sicily and seat of the [[praetor]]. It remained an important port for trade between the Eastern and the Western parts of the Empire. [[Christianity]] spread in the city through the efforts of [[Paul of Tarsus]] and Saint Marziano, the first bishop of the city, who made it one of the main centres of [[proselytism]] in the West. In the age of persecutions massive [[catacomb]]s were carved, whose size is second only to those of Rome.

After a period of [[Vandal]] rule, Syracuse and the island was recovered by [[Belisarius]] for the [[Byzantine Empire]] (31 December 535). From 663 to 668 Syracuse was the seat of Emperor [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]], as well as metropolis of the whole Sicilian Church.

The city was [[Siege of Syracuse (827<U+2013>828)|besieged]] by the [[Aghlabids]] for almost a year in 827<U+2013>828, but Byzantine reinforcements prevented its fall. It remained the center of Byzantine resistance to the gradual [[Muslim conquest of Sicily]] until it fell to the Aghlabids after [[Siege of Syracuse (877<U+2013>878)|another siege]] on 20/21 May 878. During the two centuries of [[Islam|Muslim]] rule, the capital of the [[Emirate of Sicily]] was moved from Syracuse to [[Palermo]]. The Cathedral was converted into a [[mosque]] and the quarter on the Ortygia island was gradually rebuilt along Islamic styles. The city, nevertheless, maintained important trade relationships, and housed a relatively flourishing cultural and artistic life: several Arab poets, including [[Ibn Hamdis]], the most important [[Siculo-Arabic|Sicilian Arab]] poet of the 12th century, flourished in the city.

In 1038, the Byzantine general [[George Maniakes]] reconquered the city, sending the relics of St. Lucy to [[Constantinople]]. The eponymous castle on the cape of Ortygia bears his name, although it was built under the [[Hohenstaufen]] rule. In 1085 the [[Normans]] entered Syracuse, one of the last [[Arab]] strongholds, after a summer-long siege by [[Roger I of Sicily]] and his son [[Jordan of Hauteville]], who was given the city as count. New quarters were built, and the cathedral was restored, as well as other churches.

===High medieval period===
In 1194, [[Emperor Henry VI]] occupied the Sicilian kingdom, including Syracuse. After a short period of [[Genoa#Middle Ages and Renaissance|Genoese]] rule (1205<U+2013>1220) under the notorious admiral and pirate [[Alamanno da Costa]], which favoured a rise of trades, royal authority was re-asserted in the city by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. He began the construction of the [[Castello Maniace]], the Bishops' Palace and the Bellomo Palace. Frederick's death brought a period of unrest and feudal anarchy. In the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]] between the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] dynasties for control of Sicily, Syracuse sided with the Aragonese and expelled the Angevins in 1298, receiving from the Spanish sovereigns great privileges in reward. The preeminence of baronal families is also shown by the construction of the palaces of [[Abela]], [[Chiaramonte]], Nava, Montalto.

===From the 16th century to the 20th century===
The city was struck by two ruinous earthquakes in 1542 and [[1693 Sicily earthquake|1693]], and a plague in 1729. The 17th century destruction changed forever the appearance of Syracuse, as well as the entire [[Val di Noto]], whose cities were rebuilt along the typical lines of [[Sicilian Baroque]], considered one of the most typical expressions of art of Southern Italy. The spread of [[cholera]] in 1837 led to a revolt against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] government. The punishment was the move of the province capital seat to [[Noto]], but the unrest had not been totally choked, as the Siracusani took part in the [[Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848]].

After the [[Unification of Italy]] of 1865, Syracuse regained its status of provincial capital. In 1870 the walls were demolished and a bridge connecting the mainland to Ortygia island was built. In the following year a railway link was constructed.

===Modern history===
Heavy destruction was caused by the Allied and the German bombings in 1943. ''Operation Husky'', the codename for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], was launched on the night of 9/10 July 1943 with British forces attacking the west of the island. [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|General Montgomery's]] [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] captured Syracuse on the first day of the invasion almost unopposed. The port was then used as a base for the Royal Navy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olive-drab.com/od_history_ww2_ops_battles_1943sicily.php|title=Operation Husky, Sicily 1943|publisher=olive-drab.com|date=12 April 2008}}</ref> To the west of the city is a [[Syracuse Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery|Commonwealth War Graves cemetery]] where about 1,000 men are buried. After the end of [[World War II]] the northern quarters of Syracuse experienced a heavy, often chaotic, expansion, favoured by the quick process of industrialization.

Syracuse today has about 125,000 inhabitants and numerous attractions for the visitor interested in historical sites (such as the [[Ear of Dionysius]]). A process of recovering and restoring the historical centre has been ongoing since the 1990s. Nearby places of note include [[Catania]], [[Noto]], [[Modica]] and [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]].

==Climate==
Syracuse experiences a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') with mild, wet winters and warm to hot, dry summers.

Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 18.87 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 16.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Syracuse resident is 40 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Syracuse declined by 0.49 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The reason for decline is a population flight to the suburbs, and [[northern Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/bil2002/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> The current birth rate of Syracuse is 9.75 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

As of 2006, 97.9% of the population was of [[Italian people|Italian]] descent. The largest immigrant group came from other European nations (particularly those from Poland, and the United Kingdom): 0.61%, [[North Africa]] (mostly [[Demographics of Tunisia|Tunisian]]): 0.51%, and [[South Asia]]: 0.37%.

Since 2005, the entire city of Syracuse, along with the [[Necropolis of Pantalica]] which falls within the [[province of Syracuse]], were listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. This programme aims to catalogue, name and conserve sites of outstanding [[cultural]] or [[natural]] importance to the common heritage of [[World population|humanity]]. The deciding committee which evaluates potential candidates described their reasons for choosing Syracuse because "monuments and archeological sites situated in Syracuse are the finest example of outstanding architectural creation spanning several cultural aspects; [[Culture of Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Baroque]]", following on that Ancient Syracuse was "directly linked to events, ideas and literary works of outstanding universal significance".<ref name="unesco">{{cite news|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1200|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|title=Syracuse and the Rocky Necropolis of Pantalica|date=8 January 2008}}</ref>

===Buildings of the Greek period===
* The ''{{Ill|it|Temple of Apollo (Syracuse)|Tempio di Apollo (Siracusa)}}'', Piazza Pancali, adapted to a church in Byzantine times and to a mosque under Arab rule.
* The ''[[Arethuse|Fountain of Arethusa]]'', in the Ortygia island. According to a legend, the [[nymph]] [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]], hunted by Alpheus, took shelter here.
* The ''[[Greek Theatre of Syracuse|Greek Theatre]]'', whose [[cavea]] is one of the largest ever built by the ancient Greeks: it has 67 rows, divided into nine sections with eight aisles. Only traces of the scene and the [[orchestra]] remain. The edifice (still used today) was modified by the Romans, who adapted it to their different style of spectacles, including also circus games. Near the theatre are the ''latom<U+00EC>e'', stone quarries, also used as prisons in ancient times. The most famous ''latom<U+00EC>a'' is the ''[[Ear of Dionysius|Orecchio di Dionisio]]'' ("Ear of Dionysius").
* The ''Amphitheatre'', of Roman Imperial age. It was partly carved out from the rock. In the centre of the area is a rectangular space which was used for the scenic machinery.
* The ''Tomb of Archimede'', in the Grotticelli Nechropolis. Decorated with two Doric columns.
* The ''Temple of Olympian [[Zeus]]'', about {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=off}} outside the city, built around 6th century BC.

===Buildings of the Christian period===
* The [[cathedral]] ({{lang-it|Duomo}}) was built by bishop Zosimo in the 7th century over the great ''Temple of [[Athena]]'' (5th century BC), on Ortygia island. This was a [[Doric columns|Doric]] edifice with six columns on the short sides and 14 on the long ones: these can still be seen incorporated in the walls of the current church. The base of the Greek edifice had three steps. The interior of the church has a nave and two aisles. The roof of the nave is from Norman times, as well as the mosaics in the apses. The fa<U+00E7>ade was rebuilt by [[Andrea Palma]] in 1725<U+2013>1753, with a double order of [[Corinthian column]]s, and statues by Ignazio Marabitti. The most interesting pieces of the interior are a font with marble basin (12th<U+2013>13th century), a silver statue of ''St. Lucy'' by Pietro Rizzo (1599), a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]], and a statue of the ''Madonna della Neve'' ("Madonna of the Snow", 1512) by [[Antonello Gagini]].
* Basilica of ''Santa Lucia [[Extra moenia|extra Moenia]]'', a Byzantine church built, according to tradition, in the same place of the martyrdom of the saint in 303 AD. The current appearance is from the 15th-16th centuries. The most ancient parts still preserved include the portal, the three half-circular apses and the first two orders of the belfry. Under the church are the ''Catacombs of St. Lucy''. For this church [[Caravaggio]] painted the [[Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)|Burial of St. Lucy]], now housed in the Church of ''Santa Luc<U+00EC>a alla Bad<U+00EC>a''.

* Church of St. Benedict (16th century, restored after 1693). It houses a painting of the ''Death of Saint Benedict'' by the [[Caravaggisti]] [[Mario Minniti]].
* Chiesa della Concezione (14th century, rebuilt in the 18th century), with the annexed Benedictine convent.
* Church of San Francesco all'Immacolata, with a convex fa<U+00E7>ade intermingled by columns and pilaster strips. It housed and ancient celebration, the Svelata ("Revelation"), in which an image of the Madonna was unveiled at dawn of 29 November.
* Basilica of St. John the Evangelist, built by the Normans and destroyed in 1693. Only partially restored, it was erected over an ancient crypt of the martyr San Marciano, later destroyed by the Arabs. The main altar is Byzantine. It includes the ''Catacombs of San Giovanni'', featuring a maze of tunnels and passages, with thousands of tombs and several frescoes.
