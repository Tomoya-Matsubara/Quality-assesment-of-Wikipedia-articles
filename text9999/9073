The '''St. Johns River''' is the longest river in the U.S. state of [[Florida]] and its most significant for commercial and recreational use. At {{convert|310|mi|km}} long, it winds through or borders twelve counties, three of which are the state's largest. The drop in elevation from the headwaters to the mouth is less than {{convert|30|ft|m}}; like most Florida waterways, the St. Johns has a very slow flow rate at a third of a mile an hour (0.2&nbsp;km/h), and is often described as "lazy".<ref name="whitney215">Whitney, p. 215.</ref> It is one of the few rivers in the United States to run north. Numerous lakes are formed by the river or flow into it, but as a river its widest point is {{convert|3|mi|km}} across, spanning several miles between [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], the latter being the largest urban area on the river. The narrowest point is in the headwaters, an unnavigable marsh in [[Indian River County, Florida|Indian River County]]. In all, 3.5 million people live within the various watersheds that feed into the St. Johns River.<ref>Belleville, p. xxi.</ref>

Comprising a drainage basin of {{convert|8840|sqmi|km2}}, the St. Johns is one of the major interior wetlands of Florida.<ref name="epa1">[http://www.epa.gov/rivers/plan/stjohn1.pdf The St. Johns River: Nominated as an American Heritage River], Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved on July 17, 2009.</ref><ref>Whitney, p. 136.</ref> It is separated into three major basins and two associated watersheds for [[Lake George (Florida)|Lake George]] and the [[Ocklawaha River]], all managed by the [[St. Johns River Water Management District]]. Like all waterways in Florida, the St. Johns is fed primarily by rainfall, most of which is immediately deposited into the river and its tributaries as stormwater runoff. Much of the water flowing into the St. Johns also comes from the [[Floridan Aquifer]], a natural underground reservoir that serves as the fresh water source for populations living north of [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. The St. Johns itself is being considered as a potential fresh water source for 2020 as populations continue to grow, taxing the Floridan Aquifer.

A vast variety of people have lived on or near the St. Johns, including [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic people]], [[Timucua]]n, French and Spanish settlers, [[Seminole]]s, slaves and freemen, [[Florida cracker]]s, land developers, tourists, and retirees. It has been the subject of [[William Bartram]]'s journals, [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]]' books, and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s letters home. Although Florida was the location of the first permanent European colony in what would become the United States, it was the last U.S. territory on the east coast to be developed, and it remained a wilderness frontier into the 20th century. When attention was turned to the state, however, much of the land was rapidly overdeveloped in a national zeal for progress. The St. Johns, like many Florida rivers, was altered to make way for agricultural and residential centers and suffered severe pollution and human interference that has diminished the natural order of life in and around the river. It was named one of 14 [[American Heritage River]]s in 1998 but was included on a list of America's Ten Most Endangered Rivers in 2008.<ref name="ball">Ball, David (April 14, 2008).[http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=49854 St. Johns River Makes <U+2018>Endangered<U+2019> List], Jacksonville Financial and Daily Record. Retrieved on July 17, 2009.</ref> Restoration efforts are underway for the basins around the St. Johns as Florida continues to deal with population increases in the river's vicinity.

== Geography and ecology ==

Starting in Indian River County and meeting the Atlantic Ocean at [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], the St. Johns is Florida's primary commercial and recreational waterway. It flows north<U+2014>which is unusual in North America<U+2014>from its headwaters from the direction of the Lake Wales Ridge, which is only slightly elevated at {{convert|30|ft|m}} above sea level. Furthermore, barrier islands and land between the St. Johns and the Atlantic Ocean affect its slow discharge: the river ebbs and flows with tides.<ref>McCarthy, p. 2.</ref> Uniquely, it shares the same regional terrain as the parallel [[Kissimmee River]], although the Kissimmee flows south.<ref name="whitney215"/>

===Upper basin===
The St. Johns River is separated into three basins and two associated watersheds managed by the [[St. Johns River Water Management District]]. Because the river flows in a northerly direction, the upper basin is located in the headwaters of the river at its southernmost point.<ref name="bigpicture">[http://sjr.state.fl.us/publications/pdfs/fs_sjrbigpicture.pdf "Fact Sheet: A Story of the St. Johns River: The Big Picture"], St. Johns River Water Management District (May 3, 2007).</ref> Indian River County is where the river begins as a network of marshes, at a point west of [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]] aptly named the St. Johns Marsh in central Florida. The St. Johns River is a [[blackwater river|blackwater stream]], meaning it is fed primarily by swamps and marshes lying beneath it; water seeps through the sandy soil and collects in a slight valley.<ref>Whitney, p. 216.</ref> The upper basin measures approximately {{convert|2000|sqmi|km2}}; the St. Johns transforms into a navigable waterway one county north of Indian River in [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]]. The river touches on the borders of [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola]] and [[Orange County, Florida|Orange Counties]], and flows through the southeast tip of [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole County]], transitioning into the middle basin a dozen miles (19&nbsp;km) or so north of [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]].<ref name="bigpicture"/> The length of the river through the upper basin measures about {{convert|75|mi|km}}.

The river is at its narrowest and most unpredictable in this basin. Channel flows are not apparent and usually unmarked. The most efficient way to travel on this part of the river is by [[airboat]]. Approximately 3,500 lakes lie within the overall St. Johns watershed and all of them are shallow, with maximum depths between {{convert|3|and|10|ft}}.<ref>Belleville, p. 14.</ref><ref name="benke100"/> The river flows into many of them that further confuse navigation. Eight larger lakes and five smaller ones lie in the upper basin; one of the first is named [[Lake Hell 'n Blazes]] (sometimes polished to read as Lake Helen or Hellen Blazes)<ref> Cabell, p. 10.</ref> referencing the oaths boatmen and fishermen at the beginning of the 19th century yelled, frustrated when trying to navigate through floating islands of [[macrophyte]]s, or muck and weeds, as the islands moved with the creeping flow.<ref>McCarthy, p. 5<U+2013>6.</ref> [[Lake Washington (Florida)|Lakes Washington]], [[Lake Winder|Winder]], and [[Lake Poinsett|Poinsett]]<U+2014>named for [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], a diplomat who brought the [[poinsettia]] to the United States<U+2014>are also located further along this stretch of the river. The northernmost points of the upper basin contain the [[Tosohatchee Wildlife Management Area]], created in 1977 to assist with filtration of waters flowing into the larger St. Johns.<ref>McCarthy, p. 10<U+2013>11.</ref>

[[File:Cypress trees Tosohatchee.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=A swamp dominated by tall trees with buttressed trunks standing in water, their bark gray. As the trunks get closer to the water the color gradually becomes more brown|Cypress trees in the [[Tosohatchee Wildlife Management Area]] showing dark water marks on the flared trunks, evidence of water level flux]]

Wetlands in the upper and middle basin are fed by rainwater, trapped by the structure of the surrounding land. It is an oxygen and nutrient-poor environment; what grows usually does so in [[peat]] which is created by centuries of decaying plant material.<ref name="whitney128-130">Whitney, p. 128<U+2013>130.</ref> Water levels fluctuate with the subtropical wet and dry seasons. Rain in central and north Florida occurs in seasons during the summer and winter, but farther south rain in winter is rare.<ref>Whitney, p. 156.</ref> All plants that live in these basins must be tolerant of water fluctuations, both flooding and drought. Sweetbay (''[[Magnolia virginiana]]''), cypress (''[[Taxodium]]''), and swamp tupelo (''[[Nyssa biflora]]'') trees often find the greatest success in this region on raised land called [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]].<ref name="whitney128-130"/>  Trees that live in water for long periods usually have buttressed trunks, tangled, braided roots, or protrusions like cypress knees to obtain oxygen when underwater, but the majority of plant life is aquatic. Wetland staples include the American white waterlily (''[[Nymphaea odorata]]''), [[pitcher plant]]s, and Virginia iris (''[[Iris virginica]]''). In the southernmost points of the river, ''[[Cladium]]'', or sawgrass, grows in vast swaths of wet prairies that at one time extended into the [[Everglades]].<ref>Belleville, p. 11<U+2013>12.</ref> These wetland flora are remarkably successful in filtering pollutants that may otherwise find their way into the river.<ref>Whitney, p. 132<U+2013>133.</ref>

===Middle basin===
[[File:St Johns River Middle Basin.JPG|thumb|alt=The river as a shallow and ill-defined channel dominated by grasses and weeds with few trees; white birds are present in the foreground|The St. Johns immediately south of [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] shows a narrow channel with large areas of aquatic plants and wetlands.]]

For {{convert|37|mi|km}} the river passes through a {{convert|1200|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} basin fed primarily by springs and stormwater runoff. This basin, spreading throughout Orange, [[Lake County, Florida|Lake]], [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]], and Seminole Counties, is home to the greater [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] metropolitan area, where 2 million people live and major tourist attractions are located.<ref>[http://sjr.state.fl.us/publications/pdfs/fs_msjrb.pdf The Middle St. Johns River Basin] St. Johns River Water Management District Projects in Central Florida, St. Johns River Water Management District (February 2009).</ref> The topography of the middle basin varies between clearly distinguishable banks along the river and broad, shallow lakes. Two of the largest lakes in the middle basin are created by the river: [[Lake Harney]] and Lake Monroe. The shallow {{convert|9|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} Lake Harney is fed by the long narrow [[Puzzle Lake]]; immediately north is the [[Econlockhatchee River]], which joins to increase the volume of the St. Johns where larger boat traffic navigation becomes easier. The river veers west, touching on [[Lake Jesup]] before it empties into [[Lake Monroe (Florida)|Lake Monroe]], passing the town of [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]]. Lake Monroe is a large lake at {{convert|15|sqmi|km2}}, with an average depth of {{convert|8|ft|m}}, draining a surrounding watershed of {{convert|2420|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name="McCarthy, p. 20">McCarthy, p. 20.</ref> Sanford has adapted to the lake by building some of its downtown area on the waterfront; citizens are able to use boat transportation and Sanford's public dock to commute into town.<ref>McCarthy, p. 22.</ref> 

Broadening more into an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} deep channel about {{convert|100|yards|m}} wide, after leaving Lake Monroe, the St. Johns meets its most significant [[tributary]] in the middle basin, the spring-fed [[Wekiva River]], discharging approximately {{convert|42000000|USgal|L}} a day into the St. Johns.<ref>Cabell, p. 11<U+2013>12.</ref> Near this confluence are the towns of [[DeBary, Florida|DeBary]] and [[Deltona, Florida|Deltona]]. The forests surrounding the Wekiva River are home to the largest black bear (''[[Ursus americanus]] floridanus'') population in Florida, and several troops of Rhesus monkeys (''[[Macaca mulatta]]'') have adapted to the live near the river as well. The monkeys' introduction to Florida is unclear; they were reportedly brought to Florida either to serve in backdrop scenes of [[Tarzan]] movies filmed around the [[Silver River (Florida)|Silver River]] in the 1930s, or to lend an air of authenticity to "jungle cruises", provided by an enterprising boat operator around the same time.<ref>McCarthy, p. 26.</ref><ref>Hamaker, Elaine (January 6, 1989). "Silver Springs' Monkey Colony Will Remain", ''The Ocala Star-Banner'', p. 2B.</ref><ref>Belleville, p. 71<U+2013>72.</ref> 

[[File:St Johns River.jpg|thumb|alt=The river is smooth as glass and lined by oak and other mixed forest trees, drooping over and reflected in the water; its width is approximately a dozen yards (11 m).|left|St. Johns River near [[Blue Spring State Park]] showing more distinct banks and trees instead of marshes]]

Of the most vital importance to marshes are invertebrate animals, which are the foundation of [[food webs]]. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (''[[Pomacea paludosa]]''), [[crayfish]], and [[Palaemonetes|grass shrimp]] consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller [[copepod]]s and [[amphipod]]s that live in microscopic [[algae]] and [[periphyton]] formations.<ref>Whitney, p. 158.</ref> [[Mosquito]]s are born in water; they are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of [[dragonflies]] and 44 species of [[damselflies]] in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next, or through drought and flood cycles.<ref name="whitney159">Whitney, p. 159.</ref>

Of vertebrates, numerous species of frogs, salamanders, snakes, and turtles, and alligators (''[[Alligator mississippiensis]]'') proliferate in marsh waters. Most of these animals are active at night. Choruses of frogs are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in.<ref name="whitney159"/> The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin are teeming with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month nesting or feeding in the upper basin.<ref name="epa2">[http://www.epa.gov/rivers/plan/stjohn2.pdf The St. Johns River: Nominated as an American Heritage River], Environmental Protection Agency (Part 2). Retrieved on July 17, 2009.</ref> Wading and water birds like the white ibis (''[[Eudocimus albus]]''), wood stork (''[[Mycteria americana]]''), and purple gallinule (''[[Porphyrio martinica]]'') depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.<ref>Whitney, p. 160.</ref>

The river turns north again as it rolls through a {{convert|46000|acre|km2|adj=on}} basin spreading across [[Putnam County, Florida|Putnam]], Lake, and [[Marion County, Florida|Marion Counties]], and the western part of Volusia County. Slightly north of the Wekiva River is Blue Spring, the largest [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] on the St. Johns, producing over {{convert|64000000|USgal|L}} a day.<ref>McCarthy, p. 28.</ref> Florida springs stay at an even temperature of {{convert|72|F|C}} throughout the year. Because of this, Blue Spring is the winter home for West Indian manatees (''[[Trichechus manatus]] latirostris''), and they are protected within [[Blue Spring State Park]]. Manatees are large, slow-moving herbivorous aquatic mammals whose primary threats are human development and collisions with swiftly moving watercraft. Many parts of the St. Johns and its tributaries are [[wake|no-wake zones]] to protect manatees from being critically or fatally injured by boat propellers.<ref>[http://myfwc.com/docs/WildlifeHabitats/Manatee_MgmtPlan.pdf Florida Manatee Management Plan] Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (December 2007).</ref> Human interaction with manatees in Blue Spring State Park is forbidden.<ref>[http://www.floridastateparks.org/bluespring/ Blue Spring State Park], Florida Division of Recreation and Parks (2008). Retrieved on July 9, 2009.</ref> 

Bordering to the north of Blue Spring State Park is [[Hontoon Island State Park]], accessible only by boat. In 1955 an extremely rare [[Timucua]] [[totem]] representing an owl was found buried and preserved in the St. Johns muck off of Hontoon Island.<ref>Belleville, p. 89.</ref> Representing different clans of the Timucua, two more totems<U+2014>in all, the only totems in North America to have been found outside of the [[Pacific Northwest]]<U+2014>shaped like a [[pelican]] and otter were found in 1978 after being snagged by a barge at the bottom of the river. River otters (''[[Lutra canadensis]]'') can be found through the length of the St. Johns and its tributaries, living in burrows or in the roots of trees bordering waterways. They eat crayfish, turtles, and small fish, and are active usually at night, playful but shy of human contact.<ref>[http://www.myfwc.com/WILDLIFEHABITATS/SpeciesInfo_RiverOtter.htm River Otter], Florida Wildlife Commission.

Larger land animals such as wild turkeys (''[[Meleagris gallopavo]]''), sandhill cranes (''[[Grus canadensis]]''), and the largest population of southern bald eagles (''[[Haliaeetus leucocephalus]] leucocephalus'') in the contiguous U.S, find it easier to live in the flatwoods.<ref>McCarthy, p. 58.</ref> Typical mammals that live in these ecosystems, such as raccoons (''[[Procyon lotor]]''), opossums (''[[Didelphis virginiana]]''), bobcats (''[[Lynx rufus]]''), and white tailed-deer (''[[Odocoileus virginianus]]''), are ones that prefer dry, flat areas with good ground cover and available nesting sites.<ref>Whitney, p. 55<U+2013>65.</ref>

===Ocklawaha River ===
{{main|Ocklawaha River}}

The [[Ocklawaha River]] joins the St. Johns as the largest tributary, and one of significant historical importance. The Ocklawaha (also printed as Oklawaha) drainage basin expands through Orange, Lake, Marion, and [[Alachua County, Florida|Alachua]] Counties, comprising a total of {{convert|2769|sqmi|km2}}. [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], and the northern suburbs of the Orlando metropolitan area are included in this basin. There are two headwaters for the Ocklawaha: a chain of lakes, the largest of which is [[Lake Apopka]] in Lake County, and the Green Swamp near [[Haines City, Florida|Haines City]] in [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]]. The Silver River, fed by one of Florida's most productive springs expelling {{convert|54000000|USgal|L}} daily, is located about midway along the {{convert|96|mi|km|adj=on}} Ocklawaha.<ref>[http://www.protectingourwater.org/watersheds/map/ocklawaha/ Learn About Your Watershed: Ocklawaha River Watershed], Florida's Water: Ours to Protect, [[Florida Department of Environmental Protection]] (2009). Retrieved on July 19, 2009.</ref> Like the St. Johns, the Ocklawaha also flows north.

Paddlewheel boats made the journey from the mouth of the river at [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to [[Silver Springs, Florida|Silver Springs]]<U+2014>the source of the Silver River<U+2014>at the turn of the 20th century, popularizing the Ocklawaha. Georgia-born poet [[Sidney Lanier]] called it "the sweetest waterlane in the world" in a travel guide he published in 1876.<ref>Noll and Tegeder, p. 12.</ref><ref>Cabell, p. 15.</ref> The river gave [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]] access to the St. Johns from her homestead at [[Orange Lake, Florida|Orange Lake]]. The region served as a major fishing attraction until a decline in water quality occurred in the 1940s, and since then further degradation of the river and its sources have occurred. In particular, Lake Apopka earned the designation of Florida's most polluted lake following a chemical spill in 1980 that dumped [[DDT]] in it.<ref>Marino, G. (August 13, 1994). "Lake Apopka Pollution Hurts Bass Population", ''Science News'', '''146''' (7), p. 102.</ref>  It has experienced chronic [[algal bloom]]s caused by citrus farm fertilizer and wastewater runoff from nearby farms.<ref name="apopka">[http://www.sjrwmd.com/publications/pdfs/fs_lapopka.pdf Lake Apopka], St. Johns River Water Management District (April 2008).

The proliferation of largemouth bass (''[[Micropterus salmoides]]''), black crappie (''[[Pomoxis nigromaculatus]]''), and bluegill (''[[Lepomis macrochirus]]'') in central Florida is a major attraction for fishermen from all over the country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern tessellated darter (''[[Ethestoma omstedi]]'') is found only in the Ocklawaha.<ref>Whitney, p. 225.</ref> Some are marine species that either migrate upriver to spawn or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of southern stingrays (''[[Dasyatis americana]]'') that live in Lake Washington in the upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs (''[[Rhithropanopeu harrisii]]'') have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare.<ref>Belleville, p. 36<U+2013>37.</ref> In contrast, American eels (''[[Anguilla rostrata]]'') live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the [[Sargasso Sea]] in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them [[fish migration|find their way back]] to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey to spawn and die.<ref>Belleville, p. 92<U+2013>93.</ref>

===Lower basin===

From the intersection of the Ocklawaha River, {{convert|101|mi|km}} to the Atlantic Ocean, the St. Johns lies within the lower basin, draining a total area of {{convert|2600|sqmi|km2}} in Putnam, [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns]], [[Clay County, Florida|Clay]], and Duval Counties. Twelve tributaries empty into the river in the lower basin. The St. Johns River widens considerably on the north end of Lake George; between Lake George and Palatka the river ranges between {{convert|600|and|2640|ft|m}} wide. Between Palatka and Jacksonville, that widens further to between {{convert|1|and|3|mi|km}}. This portion of the river is the most navigable and shipping is its primary use. The [[Army Corps of Engineers]] maintains shipping channels at least {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep and {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide. North of Palatka, the channels are expanded to {{convert|40|ft|m}} deep and between {{convert|400|and|900|ft|m}} wide.<ref name="spechler">Spechler, R.M.

The towns and cities along the lower basin of the river are some of the oldest in Florida, and their histories have centered on the river. Both Palatka and Green Cove Springs have been popular tourist destinations in the past. Several smaller locations along the river sprang up around ferry landings, but when rail lines and then [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highway]]s were constructed closer to the Atlantic Coast, many of the towns experienced significant economic decline, and ferry landings were forgotten.<ref>McCarthy, p. 88<U+2013>100.</ref> 

The final {{convert|35|mi|km}} of the river's course run through the city of Jacksonville, the largest in area in Florida, with a population of more than a million. Much of the economic base of Jacksonville depends on the river: {{convert|18000000|ST|MT}} of goods are shipped in and out of Jacksonville annually. Exports include paper, phosphate, fertilizers, and citrus, while major imports include oil, coffee, limestone, cars, and lumber.<ref name="bourgerie">Bourgerie, Richard.

Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an [[estuarine]] ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge.<ref>Whitney, p. 303<U+2013>304.</ref> Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees.

Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, [[zooplankton]] and [[phytoplankton]] take that role in the estuarine habitat. [[Mollusks]] gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding on the bottom of the river and ocean floors.<ref>Whitney, p. 313<U+2013>319.</ref> The abundance and importance of oysters (''[[Crassostrea virginica]]'') is apparent in the many [[midden]]s left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high.

== Formation and hydrology ==
[[File:Florida Platform.jpg|thumb|alt=Cross section illustration of the Florida Peninsula showing the current shape of the state as is known today, and the platform created by lower ocean levels 20,000 years ago, extending the west coast <!--CheckT-->{{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=off}} to the west, and portions of the east coast <!--CheckT-->{{convert|50|to|100|mi|km|abbr=off}} east of what it currently is|250 px|Florida platform (outer boundary) as it appeared the first time humans inhabited the peninsula]]

Lying within a [[coastal plain]], the St. Johns River passes through an area that was at one time barrier islands, coastal dunes, and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created primarily by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a [[Basement rock|basement]] of [[igneous]] [[granite]] and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the [[Paleozoic era]] 542 to 251 million years ago. During the [[Cretaceous period]] (145 to 65 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by [[calcium carbonate]] and formations left by the evaporation of water called [[evaporites]].<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 13<U+2013>25.</ref> What covers the peninsula is the result of simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather.<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 1<U+2013>3.</ref> As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into [[limestone]]; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]]. As ocean water retreated, [[lagoon]]s formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water.<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 4.</ref> [[Barrier island]]s, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.<ref name="benke100">Benke and Cushing, p. 100.</ref>

The majority of rivers in the Northern Hemisphere tend to flow south towards the [[equator]], probably caused by the force of the Earth's rotation. The St. Johns River is a notable exception.<ref name="benke100"/> From its origins to approximately the area of Sanford, the St. Johns flows north.<ref name="randazzo12">Randazzo and Jones, p. 12.</ref> It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles<U+2014>which is referred to as the ''St. Johns River offset'', but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late [[Tertiary]] or early [[Pleistocene]] era 65 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset.<ref name="randazzo12"/> Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by [[Pangaea]]n [[rifting]].<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 217.</ref>

===Springs and aquifers===
[[File:Florida groundwater cycle.gif|alt=Cross section illustration of the hydrologic cycle in Florida, including the Floridan aquifer and formation of springs and sinkholes|thumb|left|350 px|The hydrologic cycle in Florida, showing the [[Floridan aquifer]] and formation of springs and sinkholes]]

All of Florida's abundant fresh water is the result of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called [[evapotranspiration]] that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers.<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 69.</ref> However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in [[aquifers]]. A [[surficial aquifer]] comprised mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content.<ref name="spechler"/> Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The [[Floridan Aquifer]], underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible in the northern part of Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] north to Jacksonville and [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 82.</ref> 

Acidic rainwater erodes the limestone and can form underground caverns. When the overlay of these caverns is particularly thin<U+2014>less than {{convert|100|ft|m}}<U+2014>[[sinkhole]]s can form. Where the limestone or sand/clay overlay dissolves over the aquifer and the pressure of the water pushes out, springs form. The upper and middle basins of the St. Johns River are located in a portion of the peninsula where the aquifer system is thinly confined, meaning springs and sinkholes are abundant. Springs are measured in magnitude of how much water is discharged, which is dependent upon season and rainfall. The greatest discharge is from first magnitude springs that emit at least {{convert|100|cuft|m3}} of water per second. There are four first magnitude springs that feed the St. Johns River: [[Silver Springs, Florida|Silver Springs]] in Marion County, emitting between {{convert|250|and|1290|cuft|m3}}/second;<ref>[http://sjr.state.fl.us/springs/marion/silver.html Marion County: Silver Springs], St. Johns River Water Management District.

The St. Johns River lies within a [[humid subtropical]] zone. In summer months, the temperature ranges from {{convert|74|and|92|F|C}}, and between {{convert|50|and|72|F|C}} in the winter, although drops may occur in winter months to below freezing approximately a dozen times. Water temperatures in the river correlate to the air temperatures. The average range of water temperatures is between {{convert|50|and|95|F|C}}, rising in the summer months.<ref name="kroening"/> Where the river widens between Palatka and Jacksonville, wind becomes a significant factor in navigation, and both [[Wind wave|whitecap waves]] and calm surface waters are common.<ref>Young, p. 71.</ref>

Rain occurs more frequently in late summer and early fall.<ref name="bourgerie"/> [[Tropical storm]]s and [[nor'easter]]s are common occurrences along the Atlantic coast of Florida; the St. Johns River lies between {{convert|10|and|30|mi|km}} inland, so any storm striking the counties of Indian River north to Duval produces rain that is drained by the St. Johns River. [[Tropical Storm Fay (2008)|Tropical Storm Fay]] in 2008 deposited {{convert|16|in|cm}} of rain in a 5-day period, most of it located near [[Melbourne, Florida|Melbourne]]. The St. Johns near [[Geneva, Florida|Geneva]] in Seminole County rose {{convert|7|ft|m}} in four days, setting a record. The river near Sanford rose {{convert|3|ft|m}} in 36 hours.

=== Flow rates and water quality ===
[[File:St Johns Fog.jpg|thumb|alt=A calm, flat river surface with clouds and fog obscuring the horizon line|upright|Fog on a calm St. Johns River at the [[Shands Bridge]] near [[Green Cove Springs, Florida|Green Cove Springs]]]]

The entire river lies within the nearly flat Pamlico terrace, giving it an overall gradient of {{convert|0.8|in|cm}} per mile (km); it is one of the flattest major rivers on the continent.<ref name="benke100"/> Its proximity to the ocean in the lower basin affects its rise and fall with tides and salinity. Tides regularly affect water levels as far south as Lake George; when combined with extreme winds, the river's tidal effects can extend to Lake Monroe {{convert|161|mi|km}} away and have on occasion reached Lake Harney.<ref name="bourgerie"/> Tides typically raise the river level about {{convert|1.2|ft|m}} at Jacksonville, decreasing some to {{convert|0.7|ft|m}} at [[Orange Park, Florida|Orange Park]] where the river widens, and increasing back to {{convert|1.2|ft|m}} at Palatka as it narrows. As a result of tidal effects, discharge measurements in the lower basin are often inaccurate. However, the estimated rate of discharge between the Ocklawaha River and the center of Jacksonville ranges from {{convert|4000|to|8300|cuft|m3}} per second.<ref name="spechler"/> The nontidal discharge at the mouth at Mayport averages {{convert|15000|cuft|m3}} per second, but with tides it exceeds {{convert|50000|cuft|m3}} per second, and following heavy rains combined with tides can top {{convert|150000|cuft|m3}} per second.<ref name="bourgerie"/> Farther upriver, the discharge rate ranges from {{convert|1030|cuft|m3}} per second near Lake Poinsett to {{convert|2850|cuft|m3}} per second near DeLand. The confluence of numerous springs, the Econlockhatchee River, and the Wekiva River causes the average discharge to increase by {{convert|940|cuft|m3}} per second between Lake Harney and DeLand, representing the greatest annual average increase of streamflow along the St. Johns.<ref name="kroening"/>

As distance between the mouth of the St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the [[salinity]] in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35&nbsp;parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2&nbsp;ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40&nbsp;ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9&nbsp;ppt and falls again to 0.81&nbsp;ppt at the [[Shands Bridge]] near [[Green Cove Springs, Florida|Green Cove Springs]].<ref>[http://www.stjohnsriveralliance.com/waterwithdrawl.pdf "Environmental Protection"] (Power Point Presentation, slide 8), St. Johns River Water Management District, hosted at stjohnsriveralliance.com.

[[Oxygen saturation|Dissolved oxygen]] in fresh water is measured to indicate the health of plant and animal life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5&nbsp;mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of [[Christmas, Florida|Christmas]], and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek.<ref name="kroening"/> Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.<ref name="coj"/>

Like all blackwater streams in Florida, the color of most of the St. Johns is black, owing to the [[tannin]]s in leaf litter and decaying aquatic plants. Spring fed streams, on the other hand, are remarkably clear and visibility is very high, even when the river bottom is dozens of feet below.<ref>[http://sjr.state.fl.us/minimumflowsandlevels/bluespring/index.html Blue Spring, Volusia County: Minimum flow regime], St. Johns River Water Management District.

== Human history ==
{{main|History of Florida}}
===Pre-Columbian people===

Humans arrived on the Florida Peninsula about 12,000 years ago when the ocean was about {{convert|350|ft|m}} lower than today, and the peninsula was double its current size.<ref>Gannon, p. 1.</ref> These earliest people are called [[Paleo-Indian]]s. They were primarily hunter<U+2013>gatherers who followed large game, such as [[mastadon]]s, horses, camels, and bison. Much of the land was far from water<U+2014>most fresh water was contained in glaciers and polar ice caps. As a result, Florida was an arid landscape with few trees, dominated by grasslands and scrub vegetation.<ref>Gannon, p. 2.</ref> Around 9,000 years ago, the climate warmed, melting many of the polar ice caps and glaciers, creating a wetter environment and submerging half the peninsular shelf. As Paleo-Indians did not have to travel as far to find water, their camps became more permanent, turning into villages. With evidence of a wide variety of tools constructed around this time, archeologists note the transition into [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic people]].

[[File:Timucua owl totem.jpg|thumb|alt=A tall, wooden figure representing an owl on display indoors|upright|left|An extremely rare [[Timucua]] [[totem]] of the owl clan, found buried in muck near [[Hontoon Island]], on display at [[Fort Caroline National Monument]]]]

The Archaic people made tools from bone, animal teeth, and antlers. They wove fibers from plants such as cabbage palms and saw palmettos. A few burial sites have been excavated<U+2014>including the [[Windover archaeological site]] in Brevard County near [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]]<U+2014>that provide evidence of burial rituals. Archaic peoples interred their dead in shallow [[bogs|peat marshes]], which preserved much of the human tissue.<ref>Gannon, p. 3<U+2013>4.</ref> Further climate change between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago led to the Middle Archaic period; evidence suggests that human habitation near the St. Johns River first occurred during this era. Populations of indigenous people increased significantly at this time, and numerous settlements near the St. Johns have been recorded from this era; the banks of the St. Johns and its arteries are dotted with [[midden]]s filled with thousands of shells, primarily those of ''[[Viviparus georgianus]]''<U+2014>a freshwater snail<U+2014>and oysters.<ref>McCarthy, p. 30<U+2013>31.</ref><ref>Miller, p. 68.</ref>

The advent of regional types of pottery and stone tools made of flint or limestone marked further advancements around 500 [[Common Era|BCE]]. The Archaic people transitioned into settled groups around Florida. From the central part of the state north, along the Atlantic Coast lived people in the [[St. Johns culture]], named for the most significant nearby natural formation. Around 750 [[Common Era|CE]], the St. Johns culture learned to cultivate corn, adding to their diet of fish, game, and gourds. Archeologists and anthropologists date this agricultural advancement to coincide with a spread of archeological sites, suggesting that a population increase followed.<ref>Gannon, p. 6.</ref> When European explorers arrived in north Florida, they met a tribe speaking [[Timucua]]n, numbering about 14,000, the largest group of indigenous people in the region.<ref name="tebeau16">Tebeau, p. 16.</ref> The Timucua people called the river ''Welaka'' (or ''Ylacco''), meaning "chain of lakes", referring not only the numerous lakes that border or are formed by the river, but the slow discharge and tidal effects on it.<ref>Cabell, p. 4.</ref>

===Colonial era===
[[File:Ft Caroline French monument.jpg|thumb|alt=A cement monument, a pentagon-shaped column with bronze plaques adorned with the fleur-de-lis, surrounded by oak trees in the foreground, palmettos to the left all overlooking the river|upright|Replica of the French monument at [[Fort Caroline]] overlooking the St. Johns River]]

Though the first European contact in Florida came in 1513 when [[Juan Ponce de Le<U+00F3>n]] arrived near [[Cape Canaveral]], not until 1562 was the north Atlantic coast of the peninsula settled. Early Spanish explorers named the river ''Rio de Corientes'' (River of Currents).<ref name="epa2"/> The St. Johns River became the first place colonized and the first battleground: when French explorer [[Jean Ribault]] erected a monument south of the river's mouth to make French presence known, it alarmed the Spanish who had been exploring the southern and western coast of the peninsula for decades.<ref name="gannon41-46">Gannon, p. 41<U+2013>46.</ref><ref name="tebeau29-35">Tebeau, p. 29<U+2013>35.</ref> Ribault was detained after he returned to Europe; in 1564 [[Ren<U+00E9> Goulaine de Laudonni<U+00E8>re]] arrived to build [[Fort Caroline]] at the mouth of the St. Johns River; they called the river ''Rivi<U+00E8>re de Mai'' because they settled it on May 1.<ref>Gannon, p. 42.</ref> An artist named [[Jacques LeMoyne]] documented what he saw among the Timucuan people in 1564, portraying them as physically powerful and not lacking for provisions.<ref name="tebeau16"/> Fort Caroline did not last long; though relations with the local [[Timucua]] and [[Mocama]]s were friendly, the colony was unable to support itself. Some of the French deserted. Those who remained were killed by the Spanish in 1565.<ref name="gannon41-46"/><ref name="tebeau29-35"/> 

The French and Spanish continued to spar over who would control the natural resources and native peoples of the colony, foreshadowing a history during which eight different countries would control the river. The Timucua, who had initially befriended the French, were not encouraged to make the Spanish allies because of colonial governor [[Pedro Men<U+00E9>ndez de Avil<U+00E9>s]]' distaste of [[Huguenot|French Protestantism]] and his view that the Timucuan beliefs were "Satanic".<ref>Gannon, p. 49.</ref> By 1573, the Timucua were in outright rebellion, testing the governor's patience and forcing Spanish settlers to abandon farms and garrisons in more interior parts of Florida; the Spanish could not persuade the Timucua to keep from attacking them.<ref>Gannon, p. 57.</ref> Over a hundred years later, missionaries had more success, setting up posts along the river. Spanish Franciscan missionaries gave the river its current name based on ''[[San Juan del Puerto, Florida|San Juan del Puerto]]'' (St. John of the door or harbor), the mission established at the river's mouth following the demise of the French fort. The name first appeared on a Spanish map created between 1680 and 1700.<ref>Cabell, p. 8.</ref>  

The Timucua, as other groups of indigenous people in Florida, began to lose cohesion and numbers by the 18th century. In 1717, some of the groups were reorganized by the colonial governor; 248 Timucua were counted. The restructuring also included [[Yamasee]], Mocama, [[Apalachee]], and [[Guale]]: in total no more than 1,500 Indians remained in north Florida. Disease and violent conflicts with the Spanish and other tribes continued to decrease their numbers, and by 1763, 100 of the last remaining indigenous people of Florida chose to be relocated to Cuba with the Spanish.<ref>Gannon, p. 94.</ref> A tribe located in modern-day Georgia and Alabama called the [[Creek (people)|Creek]]s assisted with this; in 1702, they joined with the Yamasee and attacked some of the Timucua, forcing them to seek protection from the Spanish who forced them into slavery.<ref>Gannon, p. 186.</ref> The Creeks began assimilating other people and spread farther south until they were known by 1765 as [[Seminole]]s by the British, a term adapted from ''cimarrones'' that meant "runaways" or "wild ones".<ref>Gannon, p. 183.</ref> The Seminoles employed a variety of languages from the peoples the Creeks had assimilated: [[Hitchiti]], [[Muskogee language|Muskogee]], as well as Timucua. Between 1716 and 1767, the Seminoles gradually moved into Florida and began to break ties with the Creeks to become a cohesive tribe of their own.<ref>Gannon, p. 187.</ref> The St. Johns provided a natural boundary to separate European colonies on the east bank and indigenous lands west of the river.<ref>Miller, p. 152<U+2013>153.</ref>

After Florida came under the United Kingdom's jurisdiction in 1763, [[Quaker]] father and son naturalists [[John Bartram|John]] and [[William Bartram]] explored the length of the river while visiting the southeastern United States from 1765 to 1766. They published journals describing their experiences and the plants and animals they observed. They were charged by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to find the source of the river they called the Picolata or San Juan, and measured its widths and depths, taking soil samples as they traveled southward.<ref name="bartram">Bartram, John and Harper, Francis (December 1942).

Michaux was followed by [[William Baldwin (botanist)|William Baldwin]] between 1811 and 1817. Subsequent explorers, including [[John James Audubon]], have carried William's ''Travels Through North & South Carolina, Georgia, East & West Florida'' with them as a guide.<ref name="bartram"/><ref>Belleville, p. xiv.</ref>

In 1795, Florida was transferred back to Spain which lured Americans with cheap land. A former loyalist to Britain who left [[South Carolina]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], a planter and slave trader named [[Zephaniah Kingsley]] seized the opportunity and built a plantation named Laurel Grove near what is now [[Doctors Lake]], close to the west bank of the St. Johns River, south of where [[Orange Park, Florida|Orange Park]] is today.<ref>Schafer, p. 21.</ref> Three years later, Kingsley took a trip to Cuba and purchased a 13-year-old [[Wolof people|Wolof]] girl named [[Anna Kingsley|Anna Madgigine Jai]]. She became his common-law wife, and managed Laurel Grove while Kingsley traveled and conducted business.<ref>Schafer, p. 23<U+2013>27.</ref> The plantation grew citrus and sea island cotton (''[[Gossypium barbadense]]''). In 1814, they moved to [[Kingsley Plantation|a larger plantation]] on [[Fort George Island]], where they lived for 25 years, and owned several other plantations and homesteads in what is today Jacksonville and another on [[Drayton Island]] at the north end of Lake George. Kingsley later married three other freed women in a polygamous relationship;<ref name="may">May, Philip S. (January 1945).

=== Territorial Florida and statehood ===
[[File:St johns map.jpg|thumb|alt=A 19th century map of the lower basin of the river from Palatka to the mouth, showing towns and landings that were populated at the time|upright|Map of the lower St. Johns printed in 1876]]

The first years following Florida's annexation to the United States in 1821 were marked with violent conflicts between white settlers and Seminoles, whose bands often included runaway African slaves. The clashes between American and Seminole forces during the establishment of the Florida territory are reflected in the towns and landmarks along the St. Johns named for those who were directly involved. Even before Florida was under U.S. jurisdiction, Major General [[Andrew Jackson]] was responsible for removing the Alachua Seminoles west of the [[Suwannee River]], either killing them or forcing them farther south towards Lake County, in 1818. Jackson's efforts became the [[First Seminole War]], and were rewarded by the naming of a cattle crossing across a wide portion of the St. Johns near the Georgia border<U+2014>previously named Cowford<U+2014>to Jacksonville. The result of Jackson's offensive was the transfer of Florida to the U.S.<ref>Gannon, p. 191<U+2013>192.</ref><ref group=note>Lake Monroe on the St. Johns was named for President [[James Monroe]], who persuaded the U.S. government to finance the First Seminole War. As American settlers trickled in to farms and homesteads in north and central Florida, they came into increased conflict with several Seminole bands for food and sometimes to take the Seminoles as slaves. The [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]] in 1823 placed Seminoles on a reservation near Lake Okeechobee, but further U.S. policy strongly encouraged them to leave Florida for [[Indian Territory]] in what would become Oklahoma. (Tebeau, p. 156.) By 1835, the Seminoles rebelled, inspired and led by [[Osceola]], whose name is one of the most widely used for landmarks and structures in the state. (McCarthy, p. 17.) Lake Jesup's namesake is the American military leader in Florida, Major General [[Thomas Jesup]], who captured Osceola in 1837. Lake Harney was named for Brigadier General [[William S. Harney]], who led several raids against Seminoles in west and south Florida. (McCarthy, p. 12.)</ref> Following the Seminole Wars, a gradual increase in commerce and population occurred on the St. Johns, made possible by steamship travel. [[Steamboat]]s heralded a heyday for the river, and preceding railroads they were the only way to reach interior portions of the state. They also afforded the citizens of Jacksonville a pastime to watch competing races.<ref>Cabell, p. 237<U+2013>250.</ref> By the 1860s, weekly trips between Jacksonville, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] were made to transport tourists, lumber, cotton, and citrus. The soil along the St. Johns was considered especially successful for producing sweeter oranges.<ref>Cabell, p. 242.</ref>

[[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida's involvement]] in the [[U.S. Civil War]] was limited compared to other [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] because it had a fraction of the populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the ''[[USS Columbine (1862)|USS Columbine]]'', a Union [[paddle steamer]] used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces captured and then burned the ''USS Columbine'' and sank her, making it perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy.<ref>McCarthy, p. 75<U+2013>76.</ref><ref>Cabell, p. 213<U+2013>215.</ref> The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sunk a Union boat named the ''[[Maple Leaf (shipwreck)|Maple Leaf]]'', that struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into the muck near [[Julington Creek]], south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War era artifacts, including [[daguerreotype]]s and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.<ref>McCarthy, p. 111<U+2013>112.</ref>

Although the Spanish had colonized Florida for two centuries, the state remained the last part of the east coast of the United States to be developed and explored.<ref name="McCarthy, p. 20"/> Following the Civil War, the State of Florida was too far in debt to build roads and rail lines to further its progress. Florida Governor [[William Bloxham]] in 1881 appealed directly to a Pennsylvania-based industrialist named [[Hamilton Disston]], initially to build canals to improve steamboat passage through the [[Caloosahatchee River]], and drain lands in the central part of the state to turn into agriculturally productive tracts. Disston was furthermore persuaded to purchase {{convert|4000000|acre|km2}} of land in central Florida for $1 million, which at the time was reported to be the largest purchase of land in human history. Disston was ultimately unsuccessful in his drainage attempts, but his investment sparked the tourist industry and made it possible for railroad magnates [[Henry Morrison Flagler]] and [[Henry Bradley Plant]] to construct rail lines down the east coast of Florida, and another connecting Sanford to Tampa. Disston was responsible for creating the towns of Kissimmee, St. Cloud, and several others on the west coast of Florida.<ref>Lemar, L. Stephan (January 1944).

A ''[[New York Times]]'' story reporting on Disston's progress in 1883 stated that before Disston's purchase and the subsequent development, the only places worth seeing in Florida were Jacksonville and St. Augustine, with perhaps an overnight trip on the St. Johns River to Palatka; by 1883 tourist attractions had extended {{convert|250|mi|km}} south.<ref>"The Future of Florida", ''New York Times'', (May 6, 1883), p. 3.</ref> More attention was paid to the St. Johns with the increasing population. Florida was portrayed as an exotic wonderland able to cure failing health with its water and citrus, and the region began to be highlighted in travel writings. To relieve his bronchitis, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] stayed briefly in St. Augustine, calling north Florida "a grotesque region" that was being swarmed by land speculators. Emerson poignantly disliked the public sale of slaves, adding to his overall distaste.<ref>Cabell, 159<U+2013>160.</ref> Following the Civil War, however, famed author [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] lived near Jacksonville and traveled up the St. Johns, writing about it with affection: "The entrance of the St. Johns from the ocean is one of the most singular and impressive passages of scenery that we ever passed through: in fine weather the sight is magnificent."<ref>Stowe, p. 14<U+2013>15.</ref> Her memoir ''[[Palmetto Leaves]]'', published in 1873 as a series of her letters home, was very influential in luring northern residents to the state.<ref>Cabell, p. 232<U+2013>233.</ref>

One unforeseen aspect of more people coming to Florida proved to be an overwhelming problem. A woman living in a winter home near Palatka introduced water hyacinths (''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'') to the St. Johns in an attempt to beautify her backyard. Ten years later, the purple-flowered hyacinths had grown to reside in {{convert|50000000|acre|km2}} of the river and its arteries, becoming a serious [[invasive species]]. Hyacinths grow so densely that they prevent the navigation of watercraft, fishing, and sunlight from reaching the depths of the river, affecting both plant and animal life. Domestic cattle ate the plants and began wasting away; only later was it discovered the hyacinth has no nutritional value. The government of Florida found the plants to be so vexing that they spent almost $600,000 between 1890 and 1930 to rid the creeks and rivers of north Florida of them, but they were unsuccessful.<ref>McCarthy, p. 4.</ref><ref>Cabell, p. 13<U+2013>14.</ref>

An Englishman named [[Nelson Fell]], persuaded by Disston's advertisements to make his fortunes in Florida, arrived in the 1880s. An engineer by trade, Fell purchased {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} near [[Lake Tohopekaliga]] to create a town named [[Narcoossee, Florida|Narcoossee]], which had a population of more than 200 English immigrants by 1888. A spate of poor luck and tense British-American relations followed, prompting Fell to spend some years investing in infrastructure in [[Siberia]], but he returned in 1909 with ideas of developing wetlands in central Florida. He was further encouraged by the political promises of Governor [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]] to [[Draining and development of the Everglades|drain the Everglades]] during his 1904 campaign. In 1910 Fell purchased {{convert|118000|acre|km2}} of land for $1.35 an acre and started the Fellsmere Farms Company to drain the St. Johns Marsh in 1911 and send water into the [[Indian River Lagoon]], promoting the engineered canals and other structures as wondrously efficient in providing land to build a massive metropolis.<ref>Belleville, p. 15.</ref> Some progress was made initially, including the establishment of the town of [[Fellsmere, Florida|Fellsmere]] in which land was sold for $100 an acre, but sales lagged because of a scandal regarding land sale fraud and faulty draining reports from the Everglades. The company then found itself short of funds due to mismanagement. Torrential rains ruptured the newly constructed levees and dikes and forced the company by 1916 to go into receivership. Fell left Florida for Virginia in 1917.<ref>Patterson, Gordon (Summer, 1997).

[[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]] used the St. Johns as a backdrop in her books ''[[South Moon Under]]'' and ''[[The Yearling]]'', and several short stories. In 1933 she took a boat trip along the St. Johns with a friend. In the upper basin, she remarked on the difficulty of determining direction due to the river's ambiguous flow, and wrote in a chapter titled "Hyacinth Drift" in her memoir ''[[Cross Creek (book)|Cross Creek]]'' that she had the best luck in watching the way the hyacinths floated.<ref>Rawlings, p. 354<U+2013>370.</ref> Rawlings wrote, "If I could have, to hold forever, one brief place and time of beauty, I think I might choose the night on that high lonely bank above the St. Johns River."<ref>Rawlings, p. 362.</ref><ref group=note>When Rawlings and her friend stopped in Sanford to purchase gasoline, a yacht owner offered to have his crew take her to town to buy it, but he was interrupted when his wife, resplendent in a "pink spectator sports costume", demanded he take her to church instead.

Florida in the 20th century experienced a massive migration into the state. Undeveloped land sold well and draining to reclaim wetlands has often gone unchecked, but was encouraged by government. The St. Johns headwaters experienced a decrease in size from {{convert|30|sqmi|km2}} to one between 1900 and 1972.<ref>Belleville, p. 4.</ref> Much of the land was reclaimed for urban use, but agricultural needs took their toll as fertilizers and runoff from cattle ranching washed into the St. Johns. Without wetlands to filter the pollutants, the chemicals stayed in the river and flushed into the Atlantic Ocean. Boaters destroyed the floating islands of muck and weeds in the upper basin with dynamite, causing the lakes to drain completely.<ref>Belleville, p. 21.</ref>

The most egregious impact humans have attempted on nature in central Florida is the [[Cross Florida Barge Canal]], an attempt to connect the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the state by channeling the Ocklawaha River, first authorized in 1933.<ref group=note>Author and University of Florida professor Kevin McCarthy characterized the Cross Florida Barge Canal as "probably the single most dangerous threat to the water resources of the state in the twentieth century". (McCarthy, p. 76.)</ref> The canal was intended to be {{convert|171|mi|km}} long and cut a channel {{convert|250|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|ft|m}} deep.<ref>Noll and Tegeder, p. 21<U+2013>22.</ref> Most of the 20th century Florida experienced development to offset the years it remained pristine. Canal construction was top among the engineering priorities in the state, and by 1964 the Cross Florida Barge Canal was under construction, the work undertaken by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. Reasoning and feasibility for the canal had been tenuous, but by the 1960s, flood control was the primary impetus behind its construction. The Army Corps of Engineers was also constructing hundreds of miles of canals in the Everglades at the same time and by the 1960s was being accused of wasting tax money through its unnecessary construction projects.<ref>Noll and Tegeder, p. 29.</ref> In 1969 the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] filed suit in federal court to stop construction on the canal, citing irreparable harm that would be done to Florida waterways and the Floridan Aquifer, central and north Florida's fresh water source.<ref>Noll and Tegeder, p. 34<U+2013>35.</ref>

When steamboats were phased out for railroads, that were in turn replaced by [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]] that meets the St. Johns once in Jacksonville, the river lost much of its significance to the state. The influx of immigrants to Florida settled primarily south of Orlando, adversely affecting the natural order of wetlands there. Yet the call to [[Restoration of the Everglades|save the Everglades]] has been celebrated much more than restoration to the St. Johns River.<ref>Belleville, p. xxv<U+2013>xxvi.</ref> Within the past 50 years, however, urban areas in the northern and central parts of the state have grown considerably. In the upper basin, population increased by 700 percent between 1950 and 2000, and is expected to rise another 1.5 million by 2020.<ref name="upperbasin">[http://www.protectingourwater.org/watersheds/map/upper_st_johns/  Upper St. Johns River Watershed].

[[Nitrates]] and [[phosphorus]] used as lawn and crop fertilizers wash into the St. Johns. Broken septic systems and seepage from cattle grazing lands create pollution that also finds its way into the river. Storm water washes from street drains directly to the river and its tributaries: in the 1970s, the Econlockhatchee River received {{convert|8000000|USgal|L}} of treated wastewater every day.<ref>[http://www.protectingourwater.org/watersheds/map/middle_st_johns/ Middle St. Johns River Watershed]. Florida Department of Environmental Protection (2009). Retrieved on July 19, 2009.</ref> Wetlands were drained and paved, unable to filter pollutants from the water, made worse by the river's own slow discharge. Algal blooms, fish kills, and deformations and lesions on fish occur regularly in the river from Palatka to Jacksonville. Although most of the pollutanats in the river are washed from the southern parts of the river, the Jacksonville area produces approximately 36 percent of them found in the lower basin.<ref>[http://www.protectingourwater.org/watersheds/map/lower_st_johns/ Lower St. Johns River Watershed].

The State of Florida implemented a program named Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) in 1987 to assist with river cleanups, particularly with [[nonpoint source pollution]], or chemicals that enter the river by soaking into the ground, as opposed to direct piped dumping.<ref>[http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/watersheds/swim.htm Surface Water Improvement and Management Program (SWIM)], Florida Department of Environmental Protection (July 9, 2008).

The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) is charged by the [[Florida Department of Environmental Protection]] (DEP) with restoring the river. The first step in restoration, particularly in the upper basin, is the purchase of public lands bordering the river; ten different reserves and conservation areas have been implemented for such use around the St. Johns headwaters.<ref name="upperbasin"/> Around [[Lake Griffin]] in the Ocklawaha Chain of Lakes, the SJRWMD has purchased {{convert|6500|acre|km2}} of land that was previously used for muck farming.<ref>[http://www.sjrwmd.com/publications/pdfs/fs_lgriffin.pdf Lake Griffin], St. Johns River Water Management District (March 2003).

To assist with river cleanup and the associated funds for improving water quality in the St. Johns, Mayor [[John Delaney]] of Jacksonville waged a campaign to get it named as an [[American Heritage River]], beginning in 1997. The designation by the Environmental Protection Agency is intended to coordinate efforts among federal agencies to improve natural resource and environmental protection, economic revitalization, and historic and cultural preservation.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/rivers/eo13061.html Executive Order 13061: Federal Support of Community Efforts Along American Heritage Rivers], Environmental Protection Agency (September 11, 1997).

The continuing increase of population in Florida has caused urban planners to forecast that the Floridan Aquifer will no longer be able to sustain the people living in north Florida.
