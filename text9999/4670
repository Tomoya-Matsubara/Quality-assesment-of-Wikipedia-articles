Around 650 AD, the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] captured Lhasa.  The Tibetans managed to capture Chang'an in 763 during the midst of the [[Anshi Rebellion]], which saw Tang China devastated by a massive Turkic uprising. However, the incursion was soon defeated.<ref name="TibetPastAndPresent">{{cite book

The [[Old Book of Tang]] recorded the first ever embassy from Tibet arrived in China from Songts<U+00E4>n Gampo in the 8th Zhenguan year or 634 CE.<ref name="Lee6 7">Lee 1981, pp. 6-7</ref>  Tang dynasty chronicles describe this as a tribute mission, but it brought an ultimatum demanding a marriage alliance, not subservient rituals.  After this demand was refused, Tibet launched victorious military attacks against Tang affiliates in 637 and 638.<ref name="Powers 31">Powers 2004, pg. 31</ref>

There is some confusion as to whether Central Tibet conquered [[Zhang Zhung]] during the reign of Songts<U+00E4>n Gampo or in the reign of [[Trisong Dets<U+00E4>n]], (r. 755 until 797 or 804 CE).<ref>Karmey, Samten G. (1975). "'A General Introduction to the History and Doctrines of Bon", p. 180. ''Memoirs of Research Department of The Toyo Bunko'', No, 33. Tokyo.</ref> The records of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Annals do, however, seem to clearly place these events in the reign of Songts<U+00E4>n Gampo for they say that in 634, Yangtong (Zhang Zhung) and various [[Qiang people|Qiang]] tribes "altogether submitted to him." Following this he united with the country of Yangtong to defeat the 'Azha or [[Tuyuhun Kingdom|Tuyuhun]], and then conquered two more tribes of Qiang before threatening Songzhou with an army of (according to the Chinese) more than 200,000 men (100,000 according to Tibetan sources).<ref name="Powers168 9">Powers 2004, pp. 168-9</ref> He then sent an envoy with gifts of gold and silk to the Chinese emperor to ask for a Chinese princess in marriage and, when refused, attacked Songzhou.  According to the ''[[Tang Annals]]'', he finally retreated and apologised and later the emperor granted his request,<ref name="Lee7 9">Lee 1981, pp. 7-9</ref><ref name="Pelliot3 4">Pelliot 1961, pp. 3-4</ref>
