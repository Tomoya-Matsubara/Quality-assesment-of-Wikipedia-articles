{{cuisine}}
'''French cuisine''' is characterized by its extreme diversity. French cuisine is considered to be one of the world's most refined and elegant styles of cooking, and is renowned for both its classical ("haute cuisine") and provincial styles. Many of the world's greatest chefs, such as [[Taillevent]], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne]], [[Marie-Antoine Car<U+00EA>me|Car<U+00EA>me]], [[Auguste Escoffier|Escoffier]], and [[Paul Bocuse|Bocuse]], are or were masters of French cuisine. Additionally, French cooking techniques have been a major influence on virtually all Western cuisines, and almost all culinary schools use French cuisine as the basis for all other forms of Western cooking. 


==Diversity==

Traditionally, each region of [[France]] has its own distinctive cuisine:
*Cuisine from northwest France uses [[butter]], [[cream]], and [[apple]]s; 
*Cuisine from southwest France uses [[duck]] fat, [[foie gras]], [[porcini]] [[mushroom]]s, and [[gizzard]]s;
*Cuisine from southeast France uses [[olive oil]], [[herb]]s, and [[tomato]]es, and shows deep influences from [[Spanish cuisine]], [[Catalan cuisine]] and [[Italian cuisine]] . 
*Cuisine from northern France uses [[potatoes]], [[pork]], [[endive]]s and [[beer]], and shows [[Flemish cuisine]] influences.
*Cuisine from eastern France uses [[lard]], [[sausage]]s, [[beer]], and [[sauerkraut]], and shows [[German cuisine]] influences. 

Besides these five general areas, there are many more local cuisines, such as [[Loire Valley]] cuisine, [[Basque cuisine]] and the cuisine of [[Roussillon]], which is similar to [[Catalan cuisine]]. With the movements of population of contemporary life, such regional differences are less noticeable than they used to be, but they are still clearly marked, and one traveling across France will notice significant changes in the ways of cooking and the dishes served. Moreover, recent focus of French consumers on local, countryside food products means that the regional cuisines are experiencing a strong revival in the early [[21st century]], especially as the [[slow food]] movement is gaining popularity.

What is often known outside of France as French cuisine is the traditionally elaborate [[haute cuisine]], served in restaurants for high prices. This cuisine is mostly influenced by the regional cuisines of [[Lyon]] and northern France, with a marked touch of refinement. Average French people do not eat or prepare this cuisine in their everyday life. As a general rule, elderly people tend to eat the regional cuisine of the region where they are located, while younger people will be more inclined to eat dishes from other regions and foreign dishes.  Exotic cuisines, particularly [[Chinese cuisine]] and [[Vietnamese cuisine]] and some dishes from former colonies in Northern Africa have made inroads.

[[French wine]] and [[French cheese]] are an integral part of French cuisine, both as ingredients and accompaniments. France is known for its large ranges of wines and cheeses.

</div>
Fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as fish and meat, are purchased either from [[supermarket]]s and grocery stores or smaller markets Street markets are held on certain days in most localities; towns of a certain importance generally have a more permanent covered market in which food shops, especially meat and fish retailers, have better shelter than the periodic street markets. Generally, a street market for vegetables takes places on certain days outside such covered markets.

==Present-day food and drink in France==
For French people, cooking is a part of culture, and cooking good food is well appreciated. The French generally take a high pride in the cuisine of their country, and some, particularly in the older generations, are reluctant to experiment with foreign dishes.

===Structure of meals===

====Breakfast====
The normal day begins with a light [[breakfast]] in the morning, generally consisting of:
* [[bread]] with jam and spreads, often replaced nowadays by [[breakfast cereal]]s,
* a hot drink such as [[coffee]], [[tea]] or [[chocolate]] flavored milk,
* [[viennoiseries]] (not as a rule, see below),
* some fruit or fruit juice.
Hotel breakfasts often contain [[croissant]]s, but it is uncommon for french people to eat croissants at every breakfast. Indeed, they are mainly eaten on weekends, when people have time to go to their baker's and buy fresh viennoiseries before eating breakfast. Croissants may be replaced with other kinds of viennoiserie such as [[pain au chocolat|pains au chocolat]], [[madeleine]]s etc.

====Typical lunch and dinner====
[[Lunch]] is had at some point between noon and 2 p.m., and dinner in the evening after 7:00 p.m. However there are large variations depending on the local regional cultures. The dinner is usually between 7:30 p.m and 8:30 p.m in northern France for example while it is usually after 8:30 p.m in southern France. Younger metropolitan populations tend to have dinner later, around 9:00 to 11:00pm. It is light in the North and rather heavy and important in the South.
A normal complete meal consists of:
* appetizers, often consisting of [[crudit<U+00E9>s]], or a salad
* a main dish, usually meat or fish with a side of vegetables, pasta, rice, or fries
* salad (absolutely not compulsory)
* some [[cheese]] 
* dessert: yogurt, fruit or cake 
Meals, particularly lunch, are often followed by a tiny cup of [[coffee]].

Alcoholic products may be consumed as follows:
* The meal may be preceded by an [[ap<U+00E9>ritif]], for example some dose of flavoured [[Vermouth]] or region-specific drinks and cocktails such as [[Pastis]] (south) or [[Kir]] (north).
* Wine is often drunk with the meal. Occasionally, people consume beer though the frequency depends on the region of the country. Typically, wine or beer is chosen to match with the food; festive meals will typically accompany each dish with a different wine.
* The meal may be followed by a digestif <U+2014> some small dose of [[liqueur]] or other high alcoholic spirit.

In most cities, street markets sell fresh vegetables, meat and fish, and evening or weekend meals are very often cooked with fresh ingredients.

====Variations====
Festive meals may include several main dishes. Some meals incorporate a trou normand <U+2014> some small dose of a highly alcoholic liquor or [[sorbet]], perhaps [[calvados]], which props up appetite for what follows.

In large cities a majority of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school [[cafeteria]], which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is therefore not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. It is common for [[white-collar worker]]s to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and delis; however workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time considerations. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch, generating four rush hours during the day. Finally, an also popular alternative especially among [[blue-collar worker]]s is to lunch on a [[sandwich]] possibly followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.

===Drink===
Traditionally, France has been a culture of [[wine]] consumption. While this characteristic has lessened with time, even today, many French people drink wine daily. The consumption of low-quality wines during meals has been greatly reduced. [[Beer]] is especially popular with the youth. Other popular alcoholic drinks include [[pastis]], an [[aniseed]] flavoured beverage drunk diluted with cold water, or [[cider]].

The legal alcohol purchase age is 16.  Usually, parents tend to prohibit their children from consuming alcohol before these children reach their early teens. Students and young adults are known to drink heavily during parties, but usually drunkenness is not displayed in public. Public consumption of alcohol is legal, but driving under the influence can result in severe penalties.

==Divisions of Restaurant Cuisine==
Schematically, French [[restaurant]] cuisine can be called as
Cuisine bourgeoise, which includes all the classic French dishes which are not or no longer specifically regional, and which have been adapted over the years to suit the taste of the affluent.
