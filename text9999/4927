'''Ion Victor Antonescu''' (June 15, 1882 <U+2013> June 1, 1946) was a [[Romania]]n soldier, [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politician and convicted [[War crime|war criminal]]. The [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] and ''[[Conduc<U+0103>tor]]'' during most of [[World War II]], he presided over two successive [[Romania during World War II|wartime dictatorships]]. A [[Romanian Army]] career officer who made his name during the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 peasants' revolt]] and the [[World War I]] [[Romania during World War I|Romanian Campaign]], the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] Antonescu sympathized with the [[far right]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] [[National Christian Party|National Christian]] and [[Iron Guard]] groups for much of the [[interwar period]]. A [[military attach<U+00E9>]] to [[France]] and later [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]], he briefly served as [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Defense Minister]] in the National Christian cabinet of [[Octavian Goga]]. During the late 1930s, his political stance brought him into conflict with [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] and led to his detainment. Antonescu nevertheless rose to political prominence during the political crisis of 1940, and established the [[National Legionary State]], an uneasy partnership with the Iron Guard's leader [[Horia Sima]]. After entering Romania into an alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and ensuring [[Adolf Hitler]]'s confidence, he eliminated the Guard during the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]] of 1941. In addition to leadership of the executive, he assumed the offices of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs]] and Defense Minister. Soon after Romania joined the Axis in [[Operation Barbarossa]], recovering [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]], Antonescu also became [[Marshal of Romania]].

An atypical figure among [[Holocaust]] perpetrators, Antonescu enforced policies independently responsible for the deaths of as many as 400,000 people, most of them [[Bessarabian Jews|Bessarabian]], [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jews]], as well as [[Roma minority in Romania|Romani Romanians]]. The regime's [[Holocaust in Romania|complicity in the Holocaust]] combined [[pogrom]]s and [[mass murder]]s such as the [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]] with [[ethnic cleansing]], systematic deportations to occupied [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]] and widespread [[criminal negligence]]. The system in place was nevertheless characterized by singular inconsistencies, prioritizing plunder over killing, showing leniency toward most Jews in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]], and ultimately refusing to adopt the [[Final Solution]] as applied throughout [[Nazi-occupied Europe]].

Confronted with heavy losses on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Antonescu embarked on inconclusive negotiations with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], just before a political coalition, formed around the young monarch [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]], toppled him during the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23, 1944 Coup]]. After a brief detention in the [[Soviet Union]], the deposed ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' was handed back to Romania, where he was tried by a special [[Romanian People's Tribunals|People's Tribunal]] and executed. This was part of a series of trials, which also passed sentences on his various associates, as well as his wife [[Maria Antonescu|Maria]]. The judicial procedures earned much criticism for responding to the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s ideological priorities, a matter which fueled [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and far right attempts to have Antonescu posthumously exonerated. While these groups elevated Antonescu to the status of hero, his involvement in the Holocaust was officially reasserted and condemned following the 2003 [[Wiesel Commission]] report.  

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in [[Pite<U+015F>ti]] town, north-west of the capital [[Bucharest]], Antonescu was the scion of an [[upper-middle class]] [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] family with some military tradition.<ref name="del37">Deletant, p.37</ref> He was especially close to his mother, Li<U+0163>a Baranga, who survived his death.<ref>Deletant, p.70, 257</ref> His father, an army officer, wanted Ion to follow in his footsteps, and as such, he sent him to attend the Infantry and Cavalry School in [[Craiova]].<ref name="del37"/> According to one account, Ion Antonescu was briefly colleagues with [[Wilhelm Filderman]], the future [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish community]] activist whose interventions with ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' Antonescu helped save a number of his coreligionists.<ref>Penkower, p.152-153</ref> After graduation, in 1904, Antonescu joined the Romanian Army with the rank of Second Lieutenant. He spent the following two years attending courses at the Special Cavalry Section in [[T<U+00E2>rgovi<U+015F>te]].<ref name="del37"/> Reportedly, he was a zealous and goal-setting student, upset by the slow pace of promotions, and compensating for his diminutive stature through toughness.<ref name="drasum1m">{{ro icon}} Delia Radu, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2008/08/080801_serial_antonescu_episod1.shtml "Serialul 'Ion Antonescu <U+015F>i asumarea istoriei' (1)"], [[BBC]] Romanian edition, August 1, 2008</ref> In time, the reputation of being a tough and ruthless commander, together with his reddish hair earned him the nickname ''C<U+00E2>inele Ro<U+015F>u'' ("The Red Dog").<ref name="drasum1m"/> Antonescu also developed a reputation for questioning his commanders, and for appealing to higher instances whenever he felt they were wrong.<ref name="drasum1m"/>

During the repression of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 peasants' revolt]], he was the head of a cavalry unit in [[Covurlui County]].<ref name="del37"/><ref name="drasum1m"/> Opinions on his role in the events diverge: while some historians believe Antonescu was a particularly violent participant in the quelling,<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref name="fv301">Veiga, p.301</ref> others equate his participation with that of regular officers<ref name="drasum1m"/> or view it as outstandingly tactful.<ref name="del37"/> In addition to restricting peasant protests, Antonescu's unit subdued [[Socialism|socialist]] activities in [[Gala<U+0163>i]] port.<ref name="fv301"/> His handling of the situation earned him praise from [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], who sent Crown Prince (future monarch) [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]] to congratulate him in front of the whole garrison.<ref name="del37"/> The following year, Antonescu was promoted to Lieutenant, and, between 1911 and 1913, he attended the [[Academia de <U+00CE>nalte Studii Militare din Bucure<U+015F>ti|Advanced War School]], receiving the rank of Captain upon graduation.<ref name="del37"/> In 1913, during the [[Second Balkan War]] against [[Bulgaria]], Antonescu served as a [[Staff (military)|staff officer]] in the First Cavalry Division in [[Dobruja]].<ref name="del37"/>

===World War I===
After 1916, when the [[Kingdom of Romania]] entered [[World War I]] on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente side]], Ion Antonescu acted as [[chief of staff]] for General [[Constantin Prezan]].<ref name="del37"/> In August 1916, upon the start of the [[Romania during World War I|Romanian campaign]], Romanian troops crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]], marching into the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-ruled region of [[Transylvania]], but their effort was halted when the [[Central Powers]] opened new fronts. Bulgarian and [[German Empire|Imperial German]] armies decisively defeated their ill-equipped and poorly-defended Romanian adversaries in the [[Battle of Turtucaia]] (August 24), and advanced into Dobruja. When enemy troops crossed the mountains from Transylvania into [[Wallachia]], Antonescu was ordered to design a defense plan for Bucharest.<ref name="del37"/> 

The Romanian royal court, army and administration were subsequently forced to retreat into [[Moldavia]], the last portion of territory still under Romanian control. Henceforth, he partook in any important decision involving defensive efforts, an unusual promotion which probably complimented his ambition.<ref name="drasum1m"/> In December, as Prezan became the [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]], Antonescu, who was by now a major, was named the head of operations, being involved in the defense of Moldavia. He contributed to the tactics used during the [[Battle of M<U+0103>r<U+0103><U+015F>e<U+015F>ti]] (July-August 1917), when Romanians under General [[Alexandru Averescu]] managed to stop the advance of German forces under the command of Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]].<ref>Deletant, p.37-38</ref> Antonescu lived in Prezan's proximity for the remainder of the war, and influenced his decisions.<ref name="del38">Deletant, p.38</ref>

That autumn, the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|October Revolution]] took place, taking Romania's main ally, the [[Russian Provisional Government]], out of the conflict. Its successor, [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik Russia]] made peace with the Central Powers by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], leaving Romania the only enemy of the Central Powers on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. In these conditions, the Romanian government signed, and the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] ratified, Romania's own [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|peace treaty with the Central Powers]]. Romania broke the treaty later in the year, on grounds that King Ferdinand I had not signed it. During the interval, Antonescu, who viewed the [[separate peace]] as "the most rational solution", was assigned command over a cavalry regiment.<ref name="del38"/> The renewed offensive played a part in ensuring the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]]. After the war, Antonescu's merits as an operations officer were noticed by among others, politician [[Ion G. Duca]], who wrote that "his intelligence, skill and activity, brought credit on himself and invaluable service to the country".<ref name="del38"/> Another event occurring late in the war is also credited with having played a major part in Antonescu's life: in 1918, Crown Prince [[Carol II of Romania|Carol]] (the future King Carol II) eloped and technically [[Desertion|deserted]] his army posting, to marry the commoner [[Zizi Lambrino]].<ref name="drasum1m"/> This outraged Antonescu, who developed enduring contempt for the royal.<ref name="drasum1m"/>

===Diplomatic assignments and General Staff positions===
Lieutenant Colonel Ion Antonescu retained his notoriety during the [[interwar period]]. He participated in the political campaign to make Romania's gains in Transylvania recognized at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919. His [[Nationalism|nationalist]] argument about a future state of the [[Romanians]] was published as the essay ''Rom<U+00E2>nii. Origina<!-- sic -->, trecutul, sacrificiile <U+015F>i drepturile lor'' ("The Romanians. Their Origin, Their Past, Their Sacrifices and Their Rights"). The booklet claimed extension of Romanian rule beyond the confines of [[Greater Romania]], and recommended, at the risk of war with the emerging [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the annexation of all [[Banat]] areas and the [[Timo<U+010D>ka Krajina|Timok Valley]].<ref>Haynes, p.113, 115</ref> In March 1920, Antonescu was one of three people nominated by the new Averescu executive to be a [[military attach<U+00E9>]] of Romania in [[France]], but a report issued by the French military observer in Romania, General [[Victor P<U+00E9>tin]], was negative enough to make the French side choose a certain Colonel <U+015E>u<U+0163>u instead (the text referred to Antonescu as "extremely vain", "[[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]]" and "[[Xenophobia|xenophobic]]", while acknowledging his "great military worth").<ref name="del38"/> 

Nevertheless, in 1922, <U+015E>u<U+0163>u had to leave [[Paris]], and when the Romanian government nominated Antonescu again, the French government felt obliged to accept his nomination, despite renewed criticism from P<U+00E9>tin's part.<ref>Deletant, p.38-39</ref> At the moment of his reassignment, Antonescu was handling military instruction in the Transylvanian city of [[Sibiu]], where his rebellious attitude was causing irritation among his commanders.<ref name="del39">Deletant, p.39</ref> From 1923, Antonescu was also the Romanian attach<U+00E9> in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name="del39"/> After embarking on his mission, he negotiated a credit worth 100 million [[French franc]]s to be placed in Romania's purchase of French weaponry, and worked together with Romanian [[League of Nations]] diplomat [[Nicolae Titulescu]], whose personal friend he became.<ref name="del39"/> According to one account, he was also in contact with the Romanian-born [[Conservatism|conservative]] aristocrat and writer [[Marthe Bibesco]], who is reported to have introduced Antonescu to the ideas of [[Gustave Le Bon]], a researcher of [[crowd psychology]] who had an influence on [[Fascism|fascist]] leaders.<ref name="jvg186">Jaap van Ginneken, ''Crowds, Psychology, and Politics, 1871-1899'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1992, p.186.  ISBN 0-521-40418-5</ref> The same story has it that Bibesco saw the Romanian officer as a new version of 19th century nationalist rebel [[Georges Boulanger]], introducing him as such to Le Bon.<ref name="jvg186"/> In 1923, he made the acquaintance of lawyer [[Mihai Antonescu]], who was to become his close friend, legal representative and political associate.<ref>Deletant, p.301-302</ref>

After returning to Romania in 1926, Antonescu returned to his teaching position in Sibiu, and, in autumn 1928, was Secretary-General of the [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Defense Ministry]] in the [[Vintil<U+0103> Br<U+0103>tianu]] cabinet.<ref name="del39"/> He married [[Maria Antonescu|Maria Niculescu]], for long a resident of France, who had been married twice before: to a [[Romanian Police]] officer, with whom she had a son, Gheorghe (died 1944), and to Frenchman of Jewish origin.<ref>Deletant, p.39, 45, 290</ref> After a period as Deputy Chief of the General Staff,<ref name="del39"/> he was appointed its Chief (1933-1934). These assignments coincided with the rule of Carol's underage son [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] and his [[regent]]s, and with Carol's seizure of power in 1930. At the time, Antonescu first grew interested in the [[Iron Guard]], an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and fascist-related movement headed by [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]]. In his capacity as Deputy Chief of Staff, he ordered the Army's intelligence unit to compile a report on the faction, and made a series of critical notes on Codreanu's various statements.<ref name="del39"/>

As Chief of Staff, Antonescu reportedly had his first confrontation with the political class and the monarch. His projects for weapon modernization were questioned by Defense Minister [[Paul Angelescu]], leading Antonescu to present his resignation.<ref name="del39"/> According to another account, he completed an official report on the [[embezzlement]] of Army funds, which indirectly implicated Carol and his ''[[camarilla]]'' (''see [[<U+0160>koda Affair]]'').<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>Veiga, p.281</ref> The king consequently ordered him out of office, provoking indignation among sections of the political mainstream.<ref name="drasum1m"/> On Carol's orders, Antonescu was placed under surveillance by the ''[[Siguran<U+0163>a Statului]]'' intelligence service, and closely monitored by the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Interior Ministry]] Undersecretary [[Armand C<U+0103>linescu]].<ref name="del40">Deletant, p.40</ref> The officer's political credentials were on the rise, and he had contacts with all sides of the political spectrum, while support for Carol plummeted. Antonescu maintained contacts with the two main democratic groups, the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal]] and the [[National Peasants' Party|National Peasants']] parties (known respectively as PNL and PN<U+0162>).<ref name="drasum1m"/> He was also engaged in discussions with the rising [[far right]], antisemitic and fascist movements: although in competition with each other, both the [[National Christian Party]] (PNC) of [[Octavian Goga]] and the Iron Guard sought to attract Antonescu to their side.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>Deletant, p.34, 40-41; Veiga, p.281</ref> In 1936, to the authorities' alarm, Army General and Iron Guard member [[Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Gr<U+0103>nicerul]] arranged a meeting between Ion Antonescu and the movement's leader: Antonescu is reported to have found Codreanu arrogant, but to have welcomed his revolutionizing approach to politics.<ref name="del40"/>

===Defense portfolio and the Codreanu trials===
In late 1937, after the [[Romanian general election, 1937|December general election]] came to an inconclusive result, Carol appointed Goga [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] over a far right cabinet meant to curb Codreanu's rise, which was also the first executive to impose [[racial discrimination]] in its treatment of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]]. Initially designated the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Society (Romania)|Communications portfolio]] by his former rival, Interior Minister Armand C<U+0103>linescu, Antonescu repeatedly demanded the office of Defense Minister, which he was eventually granted.<ref>Deletant, p.40-41</ref> His mandate coincided with a troubled period, and saw Romania having to chose between its traditional alliance with France, Britain, the crumbling [[Little Entente]] and the League of Nations or moving closer to [[Nazi Germany]] and its [[Anti-Comintern Pact]]. Antonescu's own contribution is disputed by historians, who see him as either an Anglo-French alliance supporter or, like the PNC itself, more favorable to cooperation with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany.<ref name="drasum1m"/> At the time, Antonescu viewed Romania's alliance with the Entente core as insurance against Hungarian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[revanchism]], but, as an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], he was suspicious of the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|Franco-Soviet rapprochement]].<ref>Veiga, p.281, 296</ref> Particularly concerned about Hungarian demands in Transylvania, he ordered the General Staff to prepare for a western attack.<ref>Deletant, p.42-43</ref> However, his major contribution in office was in relation to an internal crisis: Antonescu extended the already imposed [[martial law]] as a response to violent clashes between the Iron Guard and the PNC's own fascist militia, the ''[[L<U+0103>ncieri]]''.<ref>Deletant, p.41</ref> 

The Goga cabinet ended when the tentative rapprochement between Goga and Codreanu<ref>''Final Report'', p.43; Deletant, p.34, 42; Veiga, p.246-247</ref> prompted Carol to overthrow the democratic system and proclaim his own authoritarian regime (''see [[1938 Constitution of Romania]], [[National Renaissance Front]]''). The deposed Premier died in 1938, and Antonescu remained close friend of his widow, [[Veturia Goga]].<ref name="del70">Deletant, p.70</ref> By that time, revising his earlier stance, Antonescu had also built a close relationship with Codreanu, and was even said to have become his confidant.<ref name="del42">Deletant, p.42</ref><ref name="itrelatiile">{{ro icon}} Ilarion <U+0162>iu, [http://www.revistaerasmus.go.ro/numarul_14/tiu_i2.html "Rela<U+0163>iile regimului autoritar al lui Carol al II-lea cu opozi<U+0163>ia. Studiu de caz: arestarea conducerii Mi<U+015F>c<U+0103>rii Legionare"], in [http://www.revistaerasmus.go.ro/ ''Revista Erasmus''], 14/2003-2005, at the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of History</ref> On Carol's request, he had earlier asked the Guard's leader to consider an alliance with the king, which Codreanu promptly refused in favor of negotiations with Goga, coupled with claims that he was not interested in political battles (an attitude supposedly induced by Antonescu himself).<ref>Deletant, p.41-43</ref> 

Soon afterward, C<U+0103>linescu, acting on indications from the monarch, arrested Codreanu and prosecuted him in two successive trials. Antonescu, whose mandate of Defense Minister had been prolonged under the premiership of [[Miron Cristea]], resigned in protest to Codreanu's arrest.<ref name="del44">Deletant, p.44</ref> He was a celebrity defense witness at the latter's first<ref name="itrelatiile"/> and second trials.<ref name="del44"/> During the latter, which saw Codreanu's conviction for [[treason]], Antonescu vouched for his friend's honesty while shaking his hand in front of the jury.<ref name="del44"/> Upon the end of procedures, the king ordered his former minister [[Internment|interned]] at [[Predeal]], before assigning him to command the [[Third Army (Romania)|Third Army]] in the remote eastern region of [[Bessarabia]] (and later removing him after Antonescu expressed sympathy for Guardists imprisoned in [[Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u]]).<ref>Deletant, p.45, 293</ref> Attempting to discredit his rival, Carol also ordered his wife's trial for [[bigamy]], based on a false claim that her divorce had not been finalized. Defended by Mihai Antonescu, the officer was able to prove his detractors wrong.<ref>Deletant, p.45, 58, 302</ref> Codreanu himself was taken into custody and discreetly killed by the [[Jandarmeria Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103>|Gendarmes]] acting on Carol's orders (November 1938).<ref>Cioroianu, p.54; Deletant, p.35, 50; Ornea, p.320-321; Veiga, p.257</ref>

Carol's regime slowly dissolved into crisis, the process being enhanced after the start of [[World War II]], when the military success of the core [[Axis Powers]] and the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] signed by Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] saw Romania isolated and threatened (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''). In 1940, two of Romania's regions, Bessarabia and [[Northern Bukovina]], were lost to a [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]] consented to by the king. This came as Romania, exposed by the [[Fall of France]], was seeking to align its policies with those of Germany.<ref>Deletant, p.3, 10-27, 45-47; Ornea, p.323-325; Veiga, p.256-257, 266-269</ref> Ion Antonescu himself had come to value a pro-Axis alternative after the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]], when Germany imposed demands on [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918<U+2013>1938)|Czechoslovakia]] with the acquiescence of France and the United Kingdom, leaving locals to fear that, unless reoriented, Romania would follow.<ref>Deletant, p.45-46</ref> Angered by the territorial losses of 1940, General Antonescu sent Carol a general note of protest, and, as a result, was arrested and interned at [[Bistri<U+0163>a Monastery]].<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>Deletant, p.46-47. Deletant notes the determining factor for this decision was Antonescu's link to the Iron Guard.</ref> While there, he commissioned Mihai Antonescu to establish contacts with Nazi German officials, promising to advance German economic interest, particularly in respect to the [[Oil industry in Romania|local oil industry]], in exchange for endorsement.<ref>Deletant, p.47, 293</ref> Commenting on Ion Antonescu's ambivalent stance, Hitler's Ambassador to Romania, [[Wilhelm Fabricius]], wrote to his superiors: "I am not convinced that he is a safe man."<ref>Deletant, p.47. See also ''Final Report'', p.57, 60</ref>

===Rise to power===

His internment ended in August, during which interval Romania had signed off the regions of Southern Dobruja<U+2014>to Bulgaria, and [[Northern Transylvania]]<U+2014>under Axis pressures, to [[Hungary]] (''see [[Treaty of Craiova]], [[Second Vienna Award]]''). The latter grant caused consternation among large sections of Romania's population, causing Carol's popularity to fall to a record low and provoking large-scale protests in Bucharest. These movements were organized in competition by the pro-[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] PN<U+0162>, headed by [[Iuliu Maniu]], and the pro-Nazi Iron Guard.<ref name="drasum1m"/> The latter group had been revived under the leadership of [[Horia Sima]], and was organizing a ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]''.<ref>Deletant, p.48-51, 66; Griffin (1993), p.126; Ornea, p.325-327</ref> In this troubled context, Antonescu simply left his assigned residence. He may have been secretly helped in this by German intercession,<ref>Browning, p.211</ref> but was more directly aided to escape by socialite [[Alice Sturdza]], who was acting on Maniu's request.<ref name="del48">Deletant, p.48</ref> Antonescu subsequently met with Maniu in [[Ploie<U+015F>ti]], where they discussed how best to manage the political situation.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>Deletant, p.48; Ornea, p.325-326.

The king eventually left the throne and Michael I inaugurated his second rule, while Antonescu's effective powers as dictatorial Premier were confirmed and extended.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>Cioroianu, p.54; Deletant, p.52-55; Griffin (1993), p.126; Kelso, p.96; Roper, p.8</ref> He was formally declared ''[[Conduc<U+0103>tor]]'' of the state on September 6, by a royal decree which consecrated a ceremonial role for the monarch.<ref>Deletant, p.52-55</ref> Among his subsequent measures was ensuring the safe departure into self-exile of Carol and his lover [[Elena Lupescu]], granting protection to the royal train which found itself attacked by armed members of the Iron Guard.<ref name="drasum1m"/> Horia Sima's subsequent cooperation with Antonescu was endorsed by high-ranking Nazi German officials, many of whom feared the Iron Guard was too weak on its own.<ref>Deletant, p.49-51; Veiga, p.279-280. Veiga mentions in particular [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' organization, who, although inclined to support Sima, advised the latter to let the general take hold of government.</ref> Antonescu therefore received the approval of Ambassador Fabricius.<ref>Deletant, p.49; Ornea, p.326-327, 339</ref> Despite early promises, Antonescu abandoned projects for the creation of a [[national government]],<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>Deletant, p.55-56; Ornea, p.326</ref> and opted instead for a [[Coalition government|coalition]] between a [[military dictatorship]] lobby and the Iron Guard.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>Deletant, p.52-68; Gella, p.171; Geran Pilon, p.59; Kelso, p.96-97; Kenney, p.92-93; Morgan, p.85; Ornea, p.326-327; Veiga, p.281-282, 296, 327. According to Kelso and Ornea, Antonescu was turned down by all political forces except the Iron Guard. Deletant (p.55-56) notes that this refusal was motivated by Sima's requests, which Maniu perceived as excessive.</ref> He later justified his choice by stating that the Iron Guard "represented the political base of the country at the time."<ref>Deletant, p.55</ref>

===Antonescu-Sima partnership===
The resulting regime, deemed ''[[National Legionary State]]'' and officially proclaimed on September 14, had Antonescu as Premier and ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'', with Sima as Deputy Premier and leader of the Iron Guard, the latter being remodeled into a [[Single-party state|single official party]].<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.43, 46, 54, 62, 109-112; Browning, p.211; Deletant, p.1-2, 57-68; Gella, p.171; Geran Pilon, p.59; Griffin (1993), p.126; Ioanid, p.231-232; Kelso, p.96-97; Nicholls, p.6; Ornea, p.58, 215-216, 327-329; Veiga, p.281-283</ref><ref name="pddlroutl">Peter Davies, Derek Lynch, ''The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right'', [[Routledge]], London, 2002, p.196.

There followed a short-lived and always uneasy partnership between Antonescu and Sima. In late September, the new regime denounced all pacts, accords and diplomatic agreements signed under Carol, bringing the country into Germany's orbit while subverting its relationship with a former [[Balkans|Balkan]] ally, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].<ref>Haynes, p.102</ref> Germans troops entered the country in stages, in order to defend the local oil industry<ref>Deletant, p.61; Browning, p.211</ref> and help instruct their Romanian counterparts on ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' tactics.<ref>''Final Report'', p.62; Deletant, p.61; Veiga, p.295-296</ref> On November 23, Antonescu was in [[Berlin]], where his signature sealed Romania's commitment to the main Axis instrument, the [[Tripartite Pact]].<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>Deletant, p.1, 2-3, 61-62, 280; Haynes, p.102, 107; Nicholls, p.225; Veiga, p.296</ref> Two days later, the country also adhered to the Nazi-led [[Anti-Comintern Pact]].<ref>Nicholls, p.225</ref> Other than these generic commitments, Romania had no treaty binding it to Germany, and the Romanian-German alliance functioned informally.<ref>Cioroianu, p.54; Deletant, p.62, 92, 275</ref> Speaking in 1946, Antonescu claimed to have followed the pro-German path in continuation of earlier policies, and for fear of a Nazi [[protectorate]] in Romania.<ref>Deletant, p.51</ref> 

During the National Legionary State period, earlier antisemitic legislation was upheld and strengthened, while the "[[Romanianization]]" of Jewish-owned enterprises became standard official practice.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.19-20, 31, 103, 109-113, 181-183, 185-190, 202-208, 382-385; Achim, p.163, 167; Browning, p.211; Deletant, p.59, 62-63, 103-108, 251-252; Ornea, p.331, 393-394; Veiga, p.289-290, 296, 301.

Disorder peaked in the last days of November 1940, when, after uncovering the circumstances of Codreanu's death, the fascist movement ordered retaliations against political figures previously associated with Carol, carrying out the [[Jilava Massacre]], the assassinations of [[Nicolae Iorga]] and [[Virgil Madgearu]], and several other acts of violence.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.46, 110-111; Deletant, p.60-61, 297-298, 302; Ornea, p.335-341, 347; Veiga, p.291-294, 311-312</ref> As retaliation for this insubordination, Antonescu ordered the Army to resume control of the streets,<ref>''Final Report'', p.110-111; Veiga, p.293-295</ref> unsuccessfully pressured Sima to have the assassins detained, ousted the Iron Guardist prefect of Bucharest [[Romanian Police|Police]] [[<U+015E>tefan Z<U+0103>voianu]], and ordered Legionary ministers to swear an oath to the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor''.<ref>Ornea, p.341</ref> His condemnation of the killings was nevertheless limited and discreet, and, the same month, he joined Sima at a burial ceremony for Codreanu's newly-discovered remains.<ref>Ornea, p.341; Veiga, p.294-295</ref> The widening gap between the dictator and Sima's party resonated in Berlin. When, in December, Legionary [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Minister]] [[Mihail R. Sturdza]] obtained the replacement of Fabricius with [[Manfred Freiherr von Killinger]], perceived as more sympathetic to the Iron Guard, Antonescu promptly took over leadership of the ministry, which the compliant diplomat [[Constantin Greceanu]] as his right hand.<ref>Deletant, p.63, 301</ref> In Germany, leaders of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party|National Socialist Party]] such as [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Baldur von Schirach]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]]<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.62-63; Veiga, p.280, 296</ref> threw their support behind the Legionaries, whereas [[List of German foreign ministers|Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] and the [[Wehrmacht]] stood by Antonescu.<ref name="drasum1m"/> The latter group was concerned that any internal conflict would threaten Romania's oil industry, vital to the German war effort.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>Deletant, p.25-27, 47, 61, 287</ref> The German leadership was by then secretly organizing ''[[Operation Barbarossa]]'', the attack on the Soviet Union.<ref>''Final Report'', p.63; Deletant, p.61-62, 76-78</ref><ref name="drasum2m">{{ro icon}} Delia Radu, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2008/08/080801_serial_antonescu_episod2.shtml "Serialul 'Ion Antonescu <U+015F>i asumarea istoriei' (2)"], [[BBC]] Romanian edition, August 1, 2008</ref>

The Antonescu-Sima dispute erupted into violence in January 1941, when the Iron Guard instigated a series of attacks on public institutions and a [[pogrom]], incidents collectively known as the "[[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]]".<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.43, 46, 62-63, 103, 112-115, 181, 208, 382; Ancel (2005 a), p.33, 402-403, 408; Browning, p.211-212; Deletant, p.64-68, 71-72; Ioanid, p.232, 236; Ornea, p.219, 250, 284, 343-348; Veiga, p.297-304, 312-313.

Antonescu traveled to Germany and met Hitler on eight more occasions between June 1941 and August 1944.<ref>Deletant, p.280</ref> Such close contacts helped cement an enduring relationship between the two dictators, and Hitler reportedly came to see Antonescu as the only trustworthy person in Romania,<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref name="del62">Deletant, p.62</ref> and the only foreigner to consult on military matters.<ref>''Final Report'', p.65, 168; Deletant, p.1, 280; Harvey, p.498</ref> In later statements, he offered praise to Antonescu's "breadth of vision" and "real personality."<ref name="adh498">Harvey, p.498</ref> The German military presence increased significantly in early 1941, when, using Romania as a base, Hitler invaded the rebellious Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] (''see [[Balkans Campaign]]'').<ref>Deletant, p.61-63, 75-76, 304. See also ''Final Report'', p.63-64</ref> In parallel, Romania's relationship with the United Kingdom (at the time the only major adversary of Nazi Germany) aggravated into conflict: on February 10, 1941, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Premier]] [[Winston Churchill]] recalled [[List of diplomats from the United Kingdom to Romania|His Majesty's Ambassador]] [[Reginald Hoare]], and approved the [[blockade]] of Romanian ships in British-controlled ports.<ref>Deletant, p.26-27, 75</ref> 

In June of that year, Romania joined the attack on the Soviet Union, led by Germany in coalition with Hungary, [[Finland]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939<U+2013>1945)|State of Slovakia]], the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Independent State of Croatia]].

See also ''Final Report'', p.253</ref> Romania's campaign on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] began without a formal declaration of war, and was consecrated by Antonescu's statement: "Soldiers, I order you, cross the [[Prut River]]."<ref>Deletant, p.80</ref> A few days after this, the city of [[Ia<U+015F>i]] witnessed a large-scale pogrom, which killed thousands and was carried out with Antonescu's agreement (''see [[Ia<U+015F>i pogrom]]'').<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.120-126, 200, 204, 208-209, 243-244, 285-286, 315, 321, 323, 327-329; Ancel (2005 a), ''passim''; Deletant, p.130-140, 316-317; Ioanid, p.233; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.398-399; Weber, p.167</ref> 

The first Romanian to be granted the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]], which he received from Hitler at their August 6 meeting in the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] city of [[Berdychiv]], Ion Antonescu was promoted to [[Marshal of Romania]] by royal decree on August 22, in recognition for his role in restoring the eastern frontiers of [[Greater Romania]].<ref>Deletant, p.83, 86, 280, 305</ref> He took one of his most debated decisions when, with Bessarabia's conquest almost complete, he committed Romania to Hitler's war effort over the [[Dniester]] and thrust deeper into Soviet territory, thus waging a [[war of aggression]].<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.320; Boia, p.270-271; Deletant, p.51, 84-87, 90-91, 254; King, p.93-94; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.377-380</ref> On August 30, Romania occupied a territory it deemed "[[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]]", formerly a part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] (and including the entire [[Moldavian ASSR]]).<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>Achim, p.171, 184; Deletant, p.86-87; Browning, p.277; King, p.93-94; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.380sqq</ref> Like the decision to continue the war beyond Bessarabia, this earned Antonescu much criticism from the semi-clandestine PNL and PN<U+0162>.<ref name="drasum2m"/> Soon after the takeover, the area was assigned to a civil administration apparatus headed by [[Gheorghe Alexianu]] and became the site for the main component of the [[Holocaust in Romania]]: a mass deportation of the [[Bessarabian Jews|Bessarabian]] and [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jews]], followed later by transports of [[Roma minority in Romania|Romani Romanians]] and Jews from Moldavia proper. The accord over Transnistria's administration, signed in [[Tighina]], also placed areas between the Dniester and the [[Dnieper]] under Romanian military occupation, while granting control over all resources to Germany.<ref>Deletant, p.166; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.384</ref>

===Reversal of fortunes===
The Romanian Army's inferior arms, insufficient armor and lack of training had been major concerns for the German commanders since before the start of the operation.<ref>Deletant, p.77-78, 83, 94-96</ref> One of the earliest major obstacles Antonescu encountered on the Eastern Front was the resistance of [[Odessa]], a Soviet port on the [[Black Sea]]. Refusing any German assistance, he ordered the Romanian Army to maintain a [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|two-month siege]] on heavily-fortified and well-defended positions.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.385-389</ref> The ill-equipped [[4th Infantry Division (Romania)|4th Army]] suffered losses of some 100,000 people.<ref>Deletant, p.87-88; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.385-387</ref> Antonescu's popularity again rose in October, when the fall of Odessa was celebrated triumphantly with a parade through Bucharest's ''[[Arcul de Triumf]]'', and when many Romanians reportedly believed the war was as good as won.<ref name="drasum2m"/> In Odessa itself, the aftermath included a [[1941 Odessa massacre|large-scale massacre]] of the Jewish population, ordered by the Marshal as retaliation for a bombing which killed a number of Romanian officers and soldiers (General [[Ioan Glogojeanu]] among them).<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.150-157, 245, 321, 323; Ancel (2005 a), p.291; Deletant, p.171-177, 248-253, 261, 276-277, 328-329; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.389sqq</ref> The city subsequently became the administrative capital of Transnistria.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>Deletant, p.167-168; Gella, p.171</ref> According to one account, the Romanian administration planned changing Odessa's name to ''Antonescu''.<ref>Nicholls, p.6; White, p.175</ref>  

As the Soviet Union recovered from the initial shock and slowed down the Axis offensive at the [[Battle of Moscow]] (October 1941-January 1942), Romania was asked by its allies to contribute a larger number of troops.<ref name="drasum3m">{{ro icon}} Delia Radu, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2008/08/080801_serial_antonescu_episod3.shtml "Serialul 'Ion Antonescu <U+015F>i asumarea istoriei' (3)"], [[BBC]] Romanian edition, August 1, 2008</ref> A decisive factor in Antonescu's compliance with the request appears to have been a special visit to Bucharest by Wehrmacht commander [[Wilhelm Keitel]], who introduced the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' to Hitler's plan for attacking the [[Caucasus]] (''see [[Battle of the Caucasus]]'').<ref name="drasum3m"/> The Romanian force engaged in the war reportedly exceeded German demands.<ref name="drasum3m"/> It came to around 500,000 people<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref name="del2">Deletant, p.2</ref> and thirty actively-involved divisions.<ref>Nicholls, p.6</ref> As a sign of his satisfaction, Hitler presented his Romanian counterpart with a luxury car.<ref name="drasum3m"/> On December 7, 1941, after reflecting on the possibility for Romania, Hungary and Finland to change their stance, the British government responded to repeated Soviet requests and declared war on all three countries.<ref>Deletant, p.90-92</ref> Following [[Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and in compliance with its Axis commitment, Romania declared war on the [[United States]] five days later. These developments contrasted Antonescu's own statement of December 7: "I am an ally of the [German] Reich against [the Soviet Union], I am neutral in the conflict between Great Britain and Germany. I am for America against the Japanese."<ref name="del92">Deletant, p.92</ref> 

A crucial change in the war came with the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in June 1942-February 1943, a major defeat for the Axis. [[Romanian Armies in the Battle of Stalingrad|Romania's armies]] alone lost some 150,000 men (either dead, wounded or captured)<ref name="drasum3m"/> and more than half of the country's divisions were wiped out.<ref>Deletant, p.96-97, 99; Gella, p.171; Penkower, p.161</ref> For part of that interval, the Marshal had been withdrawn from public life, owing to an unknown affliction, which is rumored to have been either a [[mental breakdown]], a [[foodborne illness]] or a symptom of the [[syphilis]] he had allegedly contracted earlier in life.<ref>Deletant, p.209-210, 335</ref> He is known to have been suffering from digestive problems, treating himself with food prepared by Marlene von Exner, an [[Austria]]n-born [[dietitian]] who moved into [[Adolf Hitler's vegetarianism|Hitler's service]] after 1943.<ref>[[Traudl Junge]], [[Melissa M<U+00FC>ller]], ''[[Until the Final Hour|At<U+00E9> o fim: Os <U+00FA>ltimos dias de Hitler contados por sua secret<U+00E1>ria]]'', Ediouro Publica<U+00E7><U+00F5>es, Rio de Janeiro, 2005, p.106-107, 191.  ISBN 85-00-01682-5</ref> 

Upon his return, Antonescu blamed the Romanian losses on German overseer [[Arthur Hauffe]], whom Hitler agreed to replace.<ref>Deletant, p.98-99</ref> In parallel with the military losses, Romania was confronted with large-scale economic problems. While Germany [[Monopoly|monopolized]] Romania's exports,<ref>''Final Report'', p.63, 117, 168; Deletant, p.26-27, 75; Harvey, p.545</ref> it defaulted on most of its payments.<ref>Harvey, p.545</ref> Like all countries whose exports to Germany, particularly in oil, exceeded imports from that country, [[Economy of Romania|Romania's economy]] suffered from Nazi control of the ''[[German Reichsmark]]''-[[Romanian leu|leu]] [[exchange rate]] (''see [[Economy of Nazi Germany]]'').<ref>Deletant, p.26; Harvey, p.544-545</ref> On the German side, those directly involved in harnessing Romania's economic output for German goals were economic planners [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]] and [[Walther Funk]], together with [[Hermann Neubacher]], the Special Representative for Economic Problems.<ref>Deletant, p.26-27</ref> The situation was further aggravated in 1942, as [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] were able to bomb the oil fields in [[Prahova County]] (''see [[Bombing of Romania in World War II]], [[Operation Tidal Wave]]'').<ref>Chant, p.75; Deletant, p.27; Gella, p.171</ref> Official sources from the following period amalgamate military and civilian losses of all kinds, which produces a total of 554,000 victims of the war.<ref>Gella, p.173. See also Weber, p.164</ref> 

In this context, the Romanian leader acknowledged that Germany was losing the war, and he therefore authorized his Deputy Premier and new Foreign Minister Mihai Antonescu to set up contacts with the Allies.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.252; Cioroianu, p.51; Deletant, p.230-240, 341-344; Penkower, p.153, 161</ref> In parallel, he allowed the PN<U+0162> and the PNL to engage in parallel talks with the Allies at various locations in neutral countries.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Deletant, p.75, 231-240, 341-344; Roper, p.8, 14</ref> The discussions were strained by the [[Western Allies]]' call for an [[unconditional surrender]], over which the Romanian envoys bargained with Allied diplomats in [[Sweden]] and [[Egypt]] (among them the Soviet representatives [[Nikolai Vasilevich Novikov]] and [[Alexandra Kollontai]]).<ref>Deletant, p.231, 233-234, 236-239, 342-345</ref> Antonescu was also alarmed by the possibility of war being carried on Romanian territory, as had happened in Italy after [[Allied invasion of Italy|Operation Avalanche]].<ref>Deletant, p.234-236</ref> The events also prompted hostile negotiations aimed at toppling Antonescu, and involving the two political parties, the young monarch, diplomats and soldiers.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Deletant, p.237-240, 343-344; Roper, p.14</ref> A major clash between Michael and Antonescu took place during the first days of 1943, when the 21-year old monarch used his New Year's address on [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|national radio]] to part with the Axis war effort.<ref>Deletant, p.236, 337</ref>

===Ouster and arrest===
{{main|King Michael's Coup}}
In March 1944, the Soviet [[Red Army]] broke the [[Southern Bug]] and Dniester fronts, advancing on Bessarabia. This came just as [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|Henry Maitland Wilson]], Allied commander of the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean theater]], presented Antonescu with an [[ultimatum]].<ref name="drasum3m"/> After a new visit to Germany and a meeting with Hitler, Antonescu opted to continue fighting alongside the remaining Axis states, a decision which he later claimed was motivated by Hitler's promise to allow Romania possession of [[Northern Transylvania]] in the event of an Axis victory.<ref name="drasum3m"/> Upon his return, the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' oversaw a counteroffensive which stabilized the front on a line between Ia<U+015F>i and [[Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u]] to the north and the lower Dniester to the east.<ref name="drasum3m"/> This normalized his relations with Nazi German officials, whose alarm over the possible loss of an ally had resulted in the ''Margarethe II'' plan, an adapted version of the [[Operation Margarethe|Nazi takeover in Hungary]].<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Chant, p.124; Deletant, p.234-235, 342</ref> 

However, Antonescu's non-compliance with the terms of Wilson's ultimatum also had drastic effects on Romania's ability to exit the war.<ref name="drasum3m"/> By then, Antonescu was conceiving of a [[separate peace]] with the Western Allies,<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Deletant, p.231; White, p.158</ref> while maintaining contacts with the Soviets.<ref>Deletant, p.233-234, 238-239; Kelso, p.129</ref> In parallel, the mainstream opposition movement came to establish contacts with the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR), which, although minor numerically, gained importance for being the only political group to be favored by Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>Cioroianu, p.51-52; Deletant, p.237-240, 343-344; Gella, p.172; Roper, p.8-9, 13-14</ref> On the PCR side, the discussions involved [[Lucre<U+0163>iu P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]] and later [[Emil Bodn<U+0103>ra<U+015F>]].<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Deletant, p.238-240, 343-344</ref> Another participating group at this stage was the old [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (defunct)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]].<ref>Cioroianu, p.51; Deletant, p.238-239, 344; Roper, p.14; Weber, p.156</ref>

Large-scale [[Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|Allied bombings of Bucharest]] took place in spring 1944, while the Soviet [[Red Army]] approached Romanian borders.<ref>Deletant, p.240, 344; Kelso, p.129; Nicholls, p.6</ref> The [[Second Jassy<U+2013>Kishinev Offensive|Battle for Romania]] began in late summer: while German commanders [[Johannes Frie<U+00DF>ner]] and [[Otto W<U+00F6>hler]] of the [[Army Group South Ukraine]] attempted to hold [[Bukovina]], Soviet [[Steppe Front]] leader [[Rodion Malinovsky]] stormed into the areas of Moldavia defended by [[Petre Dumitrescu]]'s troops.<ref>Chant, p.84, 303</ref> In reaction, Antonescu attempted to stabilize the front on a line between [[Foc<U+015F>ani]], [[N<U+0103>moloasa, Gala<U+0163>i|N<U+0103>moloasa]] and [[Br<U+0103>ila]], deep inside Romanian territory.<ref name="drasum3m"/> On August 5, he visited Hitler one final time in [[K<U+0119>trzyn]]. On this occasion, the German leader reportedly explained that his people had betrayed the Nazi cause, and asked him if Romania would go on fighting (to which Antonescu reportedly answered in vague terms).<ref>Deletant, p.239-240</ref> After the statements of [[List of Russian foreign ministers|Soviet Foreign Minister]] [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], according to which Romanian subservience was not going to be a requirement,<ref>Chant, p.124; Deletant, p.237</ref> the factions opposing Antonescu agreed that the moment had come to overthrow him, by carrying out the [[King Michael's Coup|Royal Coup of August 23]].<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Cioroianu, p.50-55; Chant, p.84-85, 124-125, 303; Deletant, p.3-4, 241-246, 265-266, 343-346; Gella, p.172; Guran & <U+015E>tefan, p.112; Ioanid, p.235-236; Kelso, p.129; Kenney, p.93; Kent, p.52; King, p.94; Morgan, p.188; Nicholls, p.6, 166-167; Roper, p.13-15; Weber, p.152-154, 158-159; White, p.158. See also Ancel (2005 a), p.321; Bucur (2004), p.173-176</ref> On that day, the sovereign asked Antonescu to meet him in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|royal palace building]], where he presented him with a request to take Romania out of its Axis alliance.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Deletant, p.241-242; Roper, p.14</ref> The ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' refused, and was promptly arrested by soldiers of the guard, being replaced as Premier with General [[Constantin S<U+0103>n<U+0103>tescu]], who presided over a [[national government]].<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Cioroianu, p.55; Deletant, p.242-243; Roper, p.14</ref> 

The new Romanian authorities declared peace with the Allies and advised the population to greet Soviet troops.<ref name="drasum3m"/> On August 25, as Bucharest was successfully defending itself against German retaliations, Romania declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>Chant, p.84-85, 124-125, 303; Gella, p.172; Kelso, p.129</ref> The events disrupted German domination in the Balkans, putting a stop to the ''Maibaum'' offensive against [[Yugoslav Partisans]].<ref>Chant, p.122</ref> The coup was nevertheless a unilateral move, and, until the signature of an [[armistice]] on September 12,<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.316; Cioroianu, p.51; Deletant, p.247-248; Kelso, p.130; Nicholls, p.167, 225</ref> the country was still perceived as an enemy by the Soviets, who continued to take Romanian soldiers as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].<ref name="drasum3m"/> In parallel, Hitler reactivated the Iron Guardist exile, creating a Sima-led [[government in exile]] which did not survive the [[End of World War II in Europe|war's end in Europe]].<ref>Harvey, p.498; Morgan, p.188; Veiga, p.302-303, 313-314</ref>

Placed in the custody of PCR militants, Ion Antonescu spent the interval at a house in Bucharest's [[Vatra Luminoas<U+0103>]] quarter.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Deletant, p.243-244, 345-346</ref> He was afterward handed in to the [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation forces]], and transported to [[Moscow]], together with his deputy Mihai Antonescu, Governor of Transnistria [[Gheorghe Alexianu]], [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Defense Minister]] [[Constantin Pantazi]], [[Jandarmeria Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103>|Gendarmerie]] commander [[Constantin Vasiliu]] and Bucharest [[Romanian Police|Police]] chief [[Mircea Elefterescu]].<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref name="del244">Deletant, p.244</ref> They was subsequently kept in luxurious detention at a mansion nearby the city,<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Deletant, p.244, 246. See also Cioroianu, p.296</ref> and guarded by [[SMERSH]], a special [[counter-intelligence]] body answering directly to Stalin.<ref name="drasum3m"/> Shortly after the [[surrender of Germany]] in May 1945, the group was moved to [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka prison]]. There, Antonescu was interrogated and reputedly pressured by SMERSH operatives, among them [[Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov]], but transcripts of their conversations were never sent back to Romania by the Soviet authorities.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Deletant, p.246, 346</ref> Later research noted that the main issues discussed were the German-Romanian alliance, the war on the Soviet Union, the economic toll on both countries, and [[Holocaust in Romania|Romania's participation]] in the [[Holocaust]] (defined specifically as crimes against "peaceful Soviet citizens").<ref name="drasum3m"/> At some point during this period, Antonescu attempted suicide in his quarters.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref name="del244"/> He was returned to Bucharest in spring 1946, being held in [[Jilava prison]]. He was subsequently interrogated by prosecutor [[Avram Bunaciu]], to whom he complained about the conditions of his detainment, contrasting them with those in Moscow, while explaining that he was a [[vegetarian]] and demanding a special diet.<ref>Deletant, p.249</ref>

===Trial and execution===
[[Image:Ion Antonescu during his trial.jpg|thumb|180px|Ion Antonescu during his trial]]
In May 1946, Ion Antonescu was prosecuted at the first in a series of [[Romanian People's Tribunals|People's Tribunals]], on charges of [[war crime]]s, [[crimes against the peace]] and [[treason]].<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.317-331; Cioroianu, p.295-296; Deletant, p.245-261, 346-350; Frankowski, p.218-219</ref> The idea of organizing it had first been proposed by the PN<U+0162>,<ref name="drasum3m"/> and was compatible with the [[Nuremberg Trials]] in [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied-occupied Germany]].<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.316, 319-320, 331; Deletant, p.247-248, 261</ref> The Romanian legislative framework was drafted by coup participant P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu, who had been granted leadership of the [[Ministry of Justice and Citizenship Freedoms (Romania)|Justice Ministry]] as a PCR member.<ref>Ioanid, p.235. See also ''Final Report'', p.316-317; Frankowski, p.219</ref> Despite the idea having earned support from several sides of the political spectrum, the procedures were politicized in a sense favorable to the PCR and the Soviet Union,<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.313-331; Cioroianu, p.295-296; Deletant, p.245-261; Frankowski, p.218-219</ref> and posed a legal problem for being based on ''[[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]]'' decisions.<ref name="Deletant, p.248, 255">Deletant, p.248, 255</ref> The first such local trial took place in 1945, resulting in the sentencing of [[Iosif Iacobici]], [[Nicolae Macici]], [[Constantin Trestioreanu]] and other soldiers commanders directly involved in planning or carrying out the [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]].<ref>Deletant, p.172, 248-249, 328. ''Final Report'', p.314</ref>

Antonescu was represented by [[Constantin Paraschivescu-B<U+0103>l<U+0103>ceanu]] and [[Titus Stoica]], two [[public defender]]s whom he had first consulted with a day before the procedures were initiated.<ref>Deletant, p.251</ref> The prosecution team, led by [[Vasile Stoican]], and the panel of judges, presided over by [[Alexandru Voitinovici]], were infiltrated by PCR supporters.<ref>''Final Report'', p.313, 322; Deletant, p.250-251</ref> Both consistently failed to admit that Antonescu's foreign policies were overall dictated by Romania's positioning between Germany and the Soviet Union.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.320-321; Deletant, p.248</ref> Nevertheless, and although references to the mass murders formed just 23% of the indictment and corpus of evidence (ranking below charges of anti-Soviet aggression),<ref>''Final Report'', p.321</ref> the procedures also included Antonescu's admission of and self-exculpating take on war crimes, including the deportations to Transnistria.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.240-241, 252, 321-322; Achim, p.168; Deletant, p.73, 252-255, 261, 276-277; Kelso, p.97</ref> They also evidence his awareness of the Odessa massacre, accompanied by his claim that few of the deaths were his direct responsibility.<ref>''Final Report'', p.245; Deletant, p.173-174, 252-253, 261, 276-277, 329</ref> One notable event at the trial was a testimony by PN<U+0162> leader [[Iuliu Maniu]]. Reacting against the aggressive tone of other accusers, Maniu went on record saying: "We [Maniu and Antonescu] were political adversaries, not [[Cannibalism|cannibals]]."<ref name="drasum3m"/> Upon leaving the bench, Maniu walked toward Antonescu and shook his hand.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Deletant, p.255-256, 348</ref>

Ion Antonescu was found guilty of the charges. This verdict was followed by two sets of [[appeal]]s, which claimed that the restored and amended [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 Constitution]] did not offer a framework for the People's Tribunals and prevented [[Capital punishment in Romania|capital punishment]] during peacetime, while noting that, contrary to the armistice agreement, only one power represented within the [[Allied Commission]] had supervised the tribunal.<ref name="Deletant, p.248, 255"/> They were both rejected within six days, in compliance with a legal deadline on the completion of trials by the People's Tribunals.<ref>Deletant, p.248, 261</ref> King Michael subsequently received pleas for [[Pardon|clemency]] from Antonescu's lawyer and his mother, and reputedly considered asking the Allies to reassess the case as part of the actual Nuremberg Trials, taking Romanian war criminals into foreign custody.<ref>Deletant, p.255-257, 349-350</ref> Subjected to pressures by the new Soviet-backed [[Petru Groza]] executive, he issued a decree in favor of execution.<ref>Deletant, p.256-259, 349-350</ref> Together with his co-defendants Mihai Antonescu, Alexianu and Vasiliu, the former ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' was executed by a military [[firing squad]] on June 1, 1946. Ion Antonescu's supporters circulated false rumors that regular soldiers had refused to fire at their commander, and that the squad was mostly composed of Jewish policemen.<ref>Deletant, p.259, 350</ref> Another apologetic claim insists that he himself ordered the squad to shoot, but footage of the event has proven it false.<ref>Deletant, p.5, 259</ref> It is however attested that he refused a blindfold and raised his hat in salute once the order was given.<ref>Deletant, p.259</ref> The execution site, some distance away from the locality of [[Jilava]] and the prison fort, was known as ''Valea Piersicilor'' ("Valley of the Peach Trees").<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>Cioroianu, p.296; Deletant, p.259</ref> His final written statement was a letter to his wife, urging her to withdraw into a [[convent]], while stating the belief that posterity would reconsider his deeds and accusing Romanians of being "ungrateful".<ref>Deletant, p.260</ref>

==Ideology==
===Nationalism and expansionism===
[[File:Rom1942.png|thumb|300px|Romania in 1942. [[Northern Transylvania]] to [[Hungary]] and [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]] under Romanian administration]]
[[Nationalism]] was a main motivator behind Antonescu's policies. A firm believer in the restoration of [[Greater Romania]] as the union of lands inhabited by [[Romanians|Romanian ethnics]], he permanently objected to [[Northern Transylvania]]'s incorporation into Hungary. Although both countries were technically allied through the Axis system, their relationship was always tense, and marked by serious diplomatic incidents.<ref>''Final Report'', p.171-172; Deletant, p.61-62, 75-76, 79, 167; Haynes, p.106-110, 120; Ioanid, p.245; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.380-385</ref> The Romanian leader kept contacts with representatives of ethnic Romanian communities directly affected by the [[Second Vienna Award]], including [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Transylvanian Greek-Catholic]] clergy.<ref name="Kent, p.224">Kent, p.224</ref> Another aspect of Antonescu's nationalist policies was evidenced after the [[Balkans Campaign]]. Antonescu's Romania did not partake in the military action, but laid a claim to the territories in eastern [[Vojvodina]] (western [[Banat]]) and the [[Timo<U+010D>ka Krajina|Timok Valley]], home to a sizable [[Romanians of Serbia|Romanian community]]. Reportedly, Germany's initial designs of attributing Vojvodina to Hungary enhanced the tensions between Antonescu and [[Mikl<U+00F3>s Horthy]] to the point where war between the two countries became a possibility.<ref>Deletant, p.76; Haynes, p.99-100, 102-109</ref> Such incidents made Germany indefinitely prolong its occupation of the region.<ref>Deletant, p.76; Haynes, p.99-100, 108-110, 120</ref> The Romanian authorities issued projects for an independent [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] with autonomy for its [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] communities,<ref>Deletant, p.76, 326</ref> while an official memorandum on the Timok region, approved by Antonescu, made mention of "Romanian" areas "from Timok [...] to [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]]".<ref>Haynes, p.119</ref> The ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' also maintained contacts with Aromanian fascists in [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis-occupied Greece]], awarding refuge to [[Principality of Pindus]] leaders [[Alchiviad Diamandi di Samarina]] and [[Nicola Matushi]], whose pro-Romanian policies had brought them into conflict with other Macedonian factions.<ref>[[John S. Koliopoulos]], ''Plundered Loyalties: Axis Occupation and Civil Strife in Greek West Macedonia, 1941-1949'', [[C. Hurst & Co. Publishers]], London, 1999, p.87-88.  ISBN 1-85065-381-X</ref>   

''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' Antonescu thought Hitler willing to revise his stance on Northern Transylvania, and claimed to have obtained the German leader's agreement, using it to justify participation on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] after the recovery of Bessarabia.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.253; Deletant, p.62, 85-87, 93; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.379-380. See also ''Final Report'', p.171-172</ref> However, transcripts of the Hitler-Antonescu conversations do not validate his interpretation.<ref name="del62"/><ref name="drasum3m"/> Another version has it that Hitler sent Antonescu a letter informing him that Bessarabia's political status was ultimately depending on German decisions.<ref name="drasum3m"/> In one of his letters to Hitler, Antonescu himself stated an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] ideological motivation: "I confirm that I will pursue operations in the east to the end against that great enemy of civilization, of Europe, and of my country: [[Russia]]n [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]] [...] I will not be swayed by anyone not to extend this military cooperation into new territory."<ref>Deletant, p.85. Partly rendered in Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.378</ref> Antonescu's ideological perspective blended national sentiment with generically [[Christianity|Christian]] and particularly [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] traits. This identity issue is confronted by British historian Arnold D. Harvey with [[Nazism|Nazi doctrine]] and its [[religion in Nazi Germany|anti-religious elements]]: "It seems that Hitler was not even perturbed by the militant Christian orientation of the Antonescu regime".<ref name="adh498"/>

It is also possible that, contrary to Antonescu's own will, Hitler viewed the transfer of [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]] as compensation for the Transylvanian areas, and that he therefore considered the matter closed.<ref>Achim, p.184; Boia, p.270; Deletant, p.167, 326; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.380-385; White, p.157-158</ref> According to the Romanian representative in Berlin, [[Raoul Bossy]], various German and Hungarian officials recommended the extension of permanent Romanian rule into Transnistria, as well as into [[Podolia]], [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Pokuttya]], in exchange for delivering the whole of Transylvania to Hungary (and relocating its ethnic Romanian majority to the new provinces).<ref>Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.380-382</ref> American political scientist [[Charles King (author)|Charles King]] writes: "There was never any attempt to annex the occupied territory [of Transnistria], for it was generally considered by the Romanian government to be a temporary [[buffer zone]] between Greater Romania and the Soviet front line."<ref>King, p.93</ref> At his 1946 trial, Antonescu claimed that Transnistria had been occupied to prevent Romania being caught in a "pincer" by Germany, "the question of ''[[Drang nach Osten]]''", and the ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' communities, while denying charges of having exploited the region for Romania's benefit.<ref>Deletant, p.253-254</ref>

Romanian historian [[Lucian Boia]] believes that Ion Antonescu may have nevertheless had [[Expansionism|expansionist]] goals to the east, and that he implicitly understood [[Operation Barbarossa]] as a tool for containing [[Slavic peoples]].<ref>Boia, p.270-271</ref> Similar verdicts are provided by other researchers.<ref>''Final Report'', p.253; Gella, p.171</ref> Another Romanian historian, Ottmar Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, argues that Antonescu did not wish to annex the region "at least until the end of the war", but notes that Antonescu's own statements make reference to its incorporation in the event of a victory.<ref name="ot383">Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.383</ref> In addition to early annexation plans to the [[Southern Bug]] (reportedly confessed to Bossy in June 1941),<ref>Deletant, p.79</ref> the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' is known to have presented his ministers with designs for the region's [[colonization]].<ref>Deletant, p.152-153; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.383</ref> The motivation he cited was alleged [[malnutrition]] among Romanian peasants, to which he added: "I'll take this population, I'll lead it into Transnistria, where I shall give it all the land it requires".<ref name="ot383"/> Several nationalists sympathetic to Antonescu acclaimed the extension of Romanian rule into Transnistria, which they understood as permanent.<ref>Deletant, p.325-326; Haynes, p.119-120; White, p.175</ref>

===Antisemitism and antiziganism===
A recurring element in Antonescu's doctrines is [[racism]], and in particular [[antisemitism]]. This was linked to his sympathy for [[Ethnocracy|ethnocratic]] ideals, and complimented by his statements in favor of "[[integral nationalism]]" and "Romanianism".<ref>''Final Report'', p.116, 181</ref> Like other [[far right]] Romanians, he saw a Jewish presence behind [[liberal democracy]], and believed in the existence of [[Judeo-Masonry]].<ref>''Final Report'', p.246-247, 248, 322-323</ref> His earliest thoughts on Codreanu's ideology criticize the Legionary leader for advocating "brutal measures" in dealing with the "invasion of Jews", and instead propose "the organization of Romanian classes" as a method for reaching the same objective.<ref name="del39"/> Politician [[Aureliu Weiss]], who met General Antonescu during that interval, recalled that, although antisemitic "to the core", he was capable of restrain in public.<ref name="fr243">''Final Report'', p.243</ref> According to historian [[Mihail Ionescu]], the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' was not averse to the Iron Guard's "Legionary principles", but wanted antisemitism to be "applied in an orderly fashion", as opposed to [[Horia Sima]]'s revolutionary ways.<ref name="drasum1m"/> Historian [[Ioan Scurtu]] believes that, during the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]], Antonescu deliberately waited before stepping in, in order for the Guard to be "profoundly discredited" and for himself to be perceived as a "savior".<ref name="drasum1m"/> In April 1941, he let his ministers know that he was considering letting "the mob" deal with the Jews, "and after the slaughter, I will restore order."<ref name="fr243"/> Lucian Boia notes that the Romanian leader was indeed motivated by antisemitic beliefs, but that these need to be contextualized in order to understand what separates Antonescu from Hitler in terms of radicalism.<ref>Boia, p.260</ref> However, various other researchers assess that, by aligning himself with Hitler before and during [[Operation Barbarossa]], Antonescu implicitly agreed with his thoughts on the "[[Jewish Question]]", choosing [[Racial antisemitism|racial]] over [[religious antisemitism]].<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.116, 127-128, 181-182, 184, 202-203, 323, 325, 383, 385; Deletant, p.1, 128-129; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.388-389</ref> According to Harvey, the [[Ia<U+015F>i pogrom]] made the Germans "evidently willing to accept that organized Christianity in Romania was very different from what it was in Germany".<ref name="adh498"/>

Antonescu was a firm believer in the [[conspiracy theory]] of "[[Jewish Bolshevism]]", according to which all Jews were supporters of [[communism]] and the Soviet Union.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.101, 209-211, 243-247, 384; Deletant, p.15-20, 116-120, 128-129, 138, 140-141, 210-211, 259, 276-277, 318; Ioanid, p.232-233; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.387-389. See also Penkower, p.182</ref> His arguments on the matter involved a spurious claim that, during the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|1940 retreat from Bessarabia]], the Jews had organized themselves and attacked Romanian soldiers.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.82-86, 247, 285; Deletant, p.15-20, 140-142, 318; Ioanid, p.232; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.387. Several researchers mention violence committed by retreating Romanian troops against the [[Bessarabian Jews]] (Browning, p.275-276; Deletant, p.18; King p.93) or the retaliatory [[Dorohoi pogrom]] (''Final Report'', p.84-86).</ref> In part, this notion exaggerated unilateral reports of enthusiasm among the marginalized Jews upon the arrival of [[Red Army]] troops.<ref>Boia, p.258-259; Deletant, p.15-20; Ornea, p.394</ref> In a summer 1941 address to his ministers, Antonescu stated: "The Satan is the Jew. [Ours] is a battle of life and death. Either we win and the world will be purified, either they win and we will become their slaves."<ref>Deletant, p.85. Partly rendered in ''Final Report'', p.244 and Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.388</ref> At around the same time, he envisaged the [[ethnic cleansing]] ("cleaning out") of Jews from the eastern Romanian-held territories.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.120-122, 127-142, 169, 175-177, 321; Ancel (2005 a), p.15-19, 291, 402; Deletant, p.79, 116-118, 127-130, 142-150, 155-156, 319; Polonsky & Michlic, p.27. The term used by [[Mihai Antonescu]] in his recommendations to the Romanian administrators is "ethnic purification", as confinement to "labor camps, where Jews and other foreigners with doubtful attitudes will not be able to exercise their prejudicial influences" (Ioanid, p.232). See also: Achim, p.167; Browning, p.276; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.387-389</ref> However, as early as February 1941, Antonescu was also contemplating the [[ghetto]]ization of all Jewish Romanians, as an early step toward their expulsion.<ref>Deletant, p.129</ref> In this context, Antonescu frequently depicted Jews as a disease or a poison.<ref>''Final Report'', p.133-134; Deletant, p.118, 206</ref> After the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], he encouraged the army commanders to resist the counteroffensive, as otherwise the Soviets "will bring Bolshevism to the country, wipe out the entire leadership stratum, impose the Jews on us, and deport masses of our people."<ref>Ancel (2005 b), p.234</ref>

Ion Antonescu's [[antiziganism]] manifested itself as the claim that some or all [[Romani people]], specifically [[Nomadic peoples of Europe|nomadic]] ones, were given to criminal behavior.<ref>''Final Report'', p.225-228, 240-241; Achim, p.168-169; Deletant, p.189-190; Ioanid, p.234; Kelso, p.97-98</ref> Such a view was contrasted by the regime's own actions: in various cases, those deported had close relatives drafted into the Romanian Army.<ref>''Final Report'', p.229; Achim, p.169; Deletant, p.192; Ioanid, p.234; Kelso, p.101, 105, 124-127</ref> Although racist slogans targeting Romani people had been popularized by the Iron Guard, it was only under Antonescu's unchallenged rule that solving the "Gypsy problem" became official policy and antiziganist measures were enforced.<ref>''Final Report'', p.225-226; Achim, p.166-167; Deletant, p.187-189</ref> After a February 1941 inspection, Antonescu singled out Bucharest's Romani community for alleged offenses committed during the [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]], and called on his ministers to present him with solutions.<ref>''Final Report'', p.227, 240-241; Achim, p.168, 171; Deletant, p.188-189, 254</ref> Initially, he contemplated sending all Romani people he considered undesirable to the inhospitable [[B<U+0103>r<U+0103>gan Plain]], to join the ranks of a local community of manual laborers.<ref>''Final Report'', p.225-226; Achim, p.168, 171; Deletant, p.188</ref> In 1942, he commissioned the Romanian Central Institute for Statistics to compile a report on Romani [[demography]], which, in its edited form, provided [[Scientific racism|scientifically racist]] conclusions, warning the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' about alleged Romani-Romanian [[miscegenation]] in rural Romania.<ref>Kelso, p.98</ref> In doing so, Antonescu offered some credit to a marginal and [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] trend in Romanian sociology, which, basing itself on [[Eugenics|eugenic]] theories, recommended the marginalization, deportation or [[compulsory sterilization]] of the Romani people, whose numeric presence it usually exaggerated.<ref>''Final Report'', p.223-228; Achim, p.164-168</ref> Among those who signed the report was demographer [[Sabin Manuil<U+0103>]], who saw the Romani presence as a major racial problem.<ref>''Final Report'', p.227; Achim, p.168; Deletant, p.187-188</ref> The exact effect of the report's claims on Antonescu is uncertain.<ref>According to Achim (p.167-170, 179, 182-183, 185) and Deletant (p.189-190), the measures reflected Antonescu's views on "social problems" more than a racist perspective. However, Kelso (p.99-100) believes the report was a notable factor in the decision to deport the Romani people.</ref>

===Fascism and conservatism===
There is a historiographic dispute about whether Ion Antonescu's regime was [[Fascism|fascist]] or more generically [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], itself integrated within a larger debate about the aspects and limits of fascism. [[Israel]]i historian of fascism [[Zeev Sternhell]] describes Antonescu, alongside his European counterparts [[Pierre-<U+00C9>tienne Flandin]], [[Francisco Franco]], [[Mikl<U+00F3>s Horthy]], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois de La Rocque]], [[Philippe P<U+00E9>tain]] and [[King of Italy|Italian King]] [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], as a "[[Conservatism|conservative]]", noting that all of them "were not deceived by a [fascist] propaganda trying to place them in the same category [as the fascist movements]."<ref>[[Zeev Sternhell]], ''Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 1996, p.5.  ISBN 0-691-00629-6</ref> A similar verdict is provided by German historian of Europe [[Hagen Schulze]], who views Horthy, Franco and the Romanian leader alongside [[Portugal]]'s ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' theorist [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and [[Second Polish Republic]] founder [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]], as rulers of "either purely military dictatorships, or else authoritarian governments run by civilian politicians", and thus a category apart from the leaders of "Fascist states."<ref name="hs292">[[Hagen Schulze]], ''States, Nations and Nationalism'', [[Blackwell Publishing]], Oxford, 2002, p.292.  ISBN 0-631-20933-6</ref> For Schulze, the defining elements of such governments is the presence of a "[[The Establishment|conservative establishment]]" which ensured "social stability" by extending the control of a "traditional state" (thus effectively blocking "revolutionary suggestions" from the [[far left]] and the [[far right]] alike).<ref name="hs292"/> The term "conservative [[Autocracy|autocrat]]" is used in relation to the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' by British political theorist [[Roger Griffin]], who attributes to the Iron Guard the position of a subservient fascist movement,<ref>[[Roger Griffin]], "Staging the Nation's Rebirth: The Politics and Aesthetics of Performance in the Context of Fascist Studies", in G<U+00FC>nter Berghaus (ed.), ''Fascism and Theatre'', [[Berghahn Books]], Providence, 1996, p.18.  ISBN 1571818774. Griffin also draws direct comparisons between Antonescu's conflict with the Iron Guard on one hand and [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Oliveira Salazar]]'s clash with the [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|National Syndicalists]] (1993, p.151-152).</ref> while others identify Antonescu's post-1941 rule as a military rather than a fascist dictatorship.<ref>Laqueur, p.203, 205; Morgan, p.86; Roper, p.8, 11</ref> A preference for "conservative" as a defining term for Antonescu's policies is shown by several other scholars.<ref name="dslill228"/><ref>Veiga, p.281-283, 290, 296, 305, 327; White, p.158</ref> Antonescu described himself as "by fate a dictator", and explained that his policies were "[[Militarism|militaristic]]"<ref name="del70"/> or, on one occasion,  "national-[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]".<ref>''Final Report'', p.115, 323</ref>

Nevertheless, other historians theorize a synthesis of fascist and conservative elements, performed by Antonescu and other European leaders of his day. [[Routledge]]'s 2002 ''Companion to Fascism and the Far Right'' uses the terms "para-fascist" to define Antonescu, adding: "generally regarded as an authoritarian conservative [Antonescu] incorporated fascism into his regime, in the shape of the Iron Guard, rather than embodying fascism himself."<ref name="pddlroutl"/> "Para-fascist" is also used by Griffin, to denote both Antonescu and [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]].<ref name="rg93127">Griffin (1993), p.127</ref> American historian of fascism [[Robert Paxton]] notes that, like Salazar, Romania's dictator crushed a competing fascist movement, "after copying some of [its] techniques of popular mobilization."<ref>[[Robert Paxton|Robert O. Paxton]], "The Five Stages of Fascism", in Brian Jenkins (ed.), ''France in the Era of Fascism: Essays on the French Authoritarian Right'', [[Berghahn Books]], Providence, 2007, p.119.  ISBN 1-57181-537-6</ref> Political scientists John Gledhill and Charles King discuss the Iron Guard as Romania's "indigenous fascist movement", remark that Antonescu "adopted much of the ideology of the Guardists", and conclude that the regime he led was "openly fascist".<ref name="jgckwolchik">John Gledhill, [[Charles King (author)|Charles King]], "Romania since 1989: Living beyond the Past", in Sharon L. Wolchik, Jane L. Curry, ''Central and East European Politics: From Communism to Democracy'', [[Rowman & Littlefield]], Lanham, 2007, p.319.  ISBN 0742540677</ref> References to the fascist traits of Antonescu's dictatorship are also made by other researchers.<ref name="jvg186"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.115-116, 237, 313, 316, 322-324, 384-385; Achim, p.167, 180; Ancel (2005 b), p.234, 245, 255; Boia, p.118-119; Gella, p.171, 172, 173; Ioanid, p.232, 235, 237-238, 244, 245; Kenney, p.92-93; Nicholls, p.6</ref>

The synthetic aspect of Antonescu's rule is discussed in detail by various authors. British historian [[Dennis Deletant]], who notes that the fascist label relies on both Antonescu's adoption of some fascist "trappings" and the "dichotomy of wartime and postwar evaluation" of his regime, also notes that post-1960 interpretations "do more to explain his behaviour than the preceding orthodoxy."<ref>Deletant, p.1-2</ref> Deletant contrasts the lack of "mass political party or ideology" with the type of rule associated with [[Nazism]] or [[Italian fascism]].<ref name="del70"/> British-born sociologist and political analyst [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]] writes: "The authoritarian regimes of Antonescu [...] and Franco [...] purported to be 'traditional', but actually their fascist-derived corporatism was a new immanent ideology of the right."<ref>[[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]], "The Sources of Social Power Revisited: A Response to Criticism", in John A. Hall, Ralph Schroeder (eds.), ''An Anatomy of Power. The Social Theory of Michael Mann'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2006, p.350.  ISBN 0-521-85000-2</ref> Another distinct view is held by Romanian-born historian of ideas [[Juliana Geran Pilon]], who describes Romania's "military fascist regime" as a successor to Iron Guardist "mystical nationalism", while mentioning that Antonescu's "national ideology was rather more traditionally militaristic and conservative."<ref>Geran Pilon, p.59</ref>

A theoretical revolutionary aspect was provided for by Antonescu's policies. The leader himself claimed: "I want to introduce a [[Patriotism|patriotic]], heroic, military-typed education, because economic education and all the others follow from it."<ref name="del70"/> According to Boia, his arrival in power was explicitly meant to "regenerate" Romania, and his popularity hinged on his being perceived as a "totalitarian model" and a "savior" figure, like [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] and Carol II before him.<ref>Boia, p.316-317</ref> The "providential" and "savior" themes are also emphasized by historian Adrian Majuru, who notes that Antonescu both adopted such ideals and criticized Carol for failing to live up to them.<ref name="ameternal">Adrian Majuru, [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_king_carol_ii_and_the_myth_of_eternal_romania.html "King Carol II and the Myth of Eternal Romania"], in the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine]'', Nr. 29/2007</ref> Seeing his rule as legitimized by the [[national interest]],<ref name="ameternal"/><ref>Deletant, p.69</ref> the general is also known to have referred to [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]] as ''poltronerie'' ("poltroonishness").<ref name="drasum1m"/> Accordingly, Antonescu formally outlawed all political forces in February 1941, codifying [[penal labor]] as punishment for most public forms of political expression.<ref>Deletant, p.71</ref> In Deletant's assessment, his regenerative program was more declarative than factual, and contradicted by Antonescu's own decision to allow the informal existence of some opposition forces.<ref>Deletant, p.70-71</ref> At the same time, his monopolizing of power in the name of a German alliance is believed by some historians to have turned Romania into either a "[[puppet state]]" of Hitler<ref name="pddlroutl"/> or one of Germany's [[Nazi-occupied Europe|"satellite" governments]].<ref>Harvey, p.544-545; Steven B<U+00E9>la V<U+00E1>rady, "Hungarian Americans during World War II: Their Role in Defending Hungary's Interests", in Mieczys<U+0142>aw B.

See also Achim, p.167</ref> However, Deletant notes: "Romania retained her sovereignty throughout the period of the alliance [with Nazi Germany]. [...] Antonescu had, of course, his own country's interests uppermost in his mind, but in following Hitler, he served the Nazi cause."<ref>Deletant, p.1</ref> He describes Romania's contribution to the war as that of "a principal ally of Germany", as opposed to a "minor Axis satellite."<ref name="del2"/>

Although he assigned an unimportant role to King Michael, Antonescu took steps to increase the monarchy's prestige, personally inviting Carol's estranged wife, [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Queen Mother Helen]], to return home.<ref>Deletant, p.53</ref> However, his preferred military structures functioned in cooperation with a [[bureaucracy]] inherited from the [[National Renaissance Front]].<ref name="ameternal"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.31, 43, 117, 384-385</ref> According to historian of fascism Philip Morgan: "Antonescu probably wanted to create, or perpetuate, something like Carol's front organization."<ref>Morgan, p.85</ref> Much of his permanent support base comprised former [[National Christian Party]] members, to the point where he was seen as successor to [[Octavian Goga]].<ref>''Final Report'', p.31-32, 43, 116, 253, 384</ref> While maintaining a decorative replacement for [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], known as ''Adunarea Ob<U+015F>teasc<U+0103> Plebiscitar<U+0103> a Na<U+0163>iunii Rom<U+00E2>ne'' ("The General Plebiscitary Assembly of the Romanian Nation") and only convoked twice,<ref name="del72">Deletant, p.72</ref> he took charge of hierarchical appointments, and personally drafted new administrative projects. In 1941, he disestablished participative government in localities and [[Counties of Romania|counties]], replacing it with a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] structure appointed by prefects whom he had named.<ref name="del72"/> In stages between August and October 1941, he instituted the civilian administration of Transnistria under Governor [[Gheorghe Alexianu]], whose status he made equivalent to that of a cabinet minister.<ref>''Final Report'', p.139, 141; Deletant, p.72, 87-88, 152-153, 166-171, 277, 321-327; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.384-385</ref> Similar measures were taken in Bukovina and Bessarabia (under Governors [[Corneliu Calotescu]] and [[Gheorghe Voiculescu]] respectively).<ref>''Final Report'', p.139; Deletant, p.72, 83, 87-88, 153, 277, 305, 322, 324</ref> Antonescu strictly relied on the [[chain of command]], and his direct orders to the Army overrode civilian hierarchies, a system which allowed room for endemic [[political corruption]] and administrative confusion.<ref>''Final Report'', p.118-119, 385; Deletant, p.69-70, 72, 88-90, 169-170, 277, 327</ref> The Romanian leader also tolerated a gradual loss of authority over the [[Germans of Romania|German communities in Romania]], in particular the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Banat Swabians|Swabian]] groups, in agreement with Hitler's views on the ''[[Volksdeutsche]]''. This trend was initiated by Saxon Nazi activist [[Andreas Schmidt (Transylvanian Saxon Nazi)|Andreas Schmidt]] in cooperation with the ''[[Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle]]'',<ref>Deletant, p.59</ref> resulting in ''[[de facto]]'' [[self-governance]] under a Nazi system<ref name="rw136">[[Richard Wagner (author)|Richard Wagner]], "Ethnic Germans in Romania", in [[Stefan Wolff]] (ed.), ''German Minorities in Europe: Ethnic Identity and Cultural Belonging'', [[Berghahn Books]], Providence, 2000, p.136.

The regime was characterized by the leader's attempts to regulate even remote aspects of public life, including relations between the sexes. He imposed drastic penalties for [[misdemeanor]]s,<ref>Achim, p.169; Deletant, p.70-71; Frankowski, p.217</ref> and the legal use of [[Capital punishment in Romania|capital punishment]] was extended to an unprecedented level.<ref>Deletant, p.71-72, 253; Frankowski, p.217</ref> He personally set standards for nightclub programs, for the length of skirts and for women's use of bicycles,<ref name="drasum1m"/> while forcing all men to wear coats in public.<ref name="del70"/> His wife [[Maria Antonescu|Maria]] was a patron of state-approved [[charitable organization]]s, initially designed to compete with successful Iron Guardist ventures such as ''[[Ajutorul Legionar]]''.<ref>Veiga, p.305</ref> According to Romanian-born [[gender studies]] academic [[Maria Bucur]], although the regime allowed women "to participate in the war effort on the front in a more regularized, if still marginal, fashion", the general tone was [[Sexism|sexist]].<ref>Bucur (2006), p.182</ref>

The administrative apparatus included official press and [[propaganda]] sectors, which had rapidly moved from constructing Carol's [[personality cult]] to doing the same for the new military leader: journals ''[[Universul]]'' and ''[[Timpul]]'', as well as [[Camil Petrescu]]'s ''Rom<U+00E2>nia'' magazine, were particularly active in this process.<ref name="ameternal"/> Some other such venues were ''[[Porunca Vremii]]'',<ref>''Final Report'', p.92, 96; Bucur (2006), p.191; Deletant, p.114, 231</ref> [[Nichifor Crainic]]'s ''[[Sfarm<U+0103>-Piatr<U+0103>]]'',<ref>''Final Report'', p.92, 96; Ornea, p.249-250</ref> as well as all the seemingly independent newspapers and some ten new periodicals the government founded for this purpose.<ref>''Final Report'', p.92-102</ref> Among the individual journalists involved in propaganda were Crainic, Petrescu, [[Stelian Popescu]],<ref name="ameternal"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.97</ref> and ''[[Curentul]]'' editor [[Pamfil <U+015E>eicaru]]<ref>''Final Report'', p.92-93; Ancel (2005 a), p.403</ref> (the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' purposefully ignored support from Carol's former adviser, corporatist economist and newspaperman [[Mihail Manoilescu]], whom he reportedly despised).<ref>Ornea, p.281-282, 284-285</ref> Much of the propaganda produced during the Antonescu era supported the antisemitic theses put forth by the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor''.<ref>''Final Report'', p.91-107, 117, 204, 284-285, 383, 385; Ancel (2005 a), p.406-408; (2005 b), p.231-232, 234-235; Bucur (2006), p.186; Deletant, p.114, 138, 140; Neubauer ''et al.'', p.150; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.387, 389</ref> Antisemitism was notable and virulent at the level of Romanian Army units addressing former Soviet citizens in occupied lands, and reflected the regime's preference for the [[ethnic slur]] ''jidani'' ("[[kike]]s").<ref>Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.387, 389.

Three weeks after gaining power and inaugurating the National Legionary regime, Ion Antonescu declared to Italian interviewers at ''[[La Stampa]]'' that solving the "[[Jewish Question]]" was his pressing concern, and that he considered himself "haunted" by the large Jewish presence in Moldavian towns.<ref>Ioanid, p.232. See also Ornea, p.393</ref> Antonescu's crimes against the Jewish population were inaugurated by new [[racial discrimination]] laws: urban Jewish property was expropriated, Jews were banned from performing a wide range of occupations and forced to provide [[Civil conscription|community work]] for the state (''munc<U+0103> de interes ob<U+015F>tesc'') instead of the inaccessible military service,<ref>''Final Report'', p.118-119, 197-199, 201, 206, 291-292; Browning, p.211; Deletant, p.103, 108-113, 120, 123-124, 159, 201, 207, 211, 310-311, 381; Kelso, p.100-101</ref> mixed Romanian-Jewish marriages were forbidden and many Jews, primarily those from strategic areas such as [[Ploie<U+015F>ti]], were confined to [[Internment|internment camps]].<ref>''Final Report'', p.118-119, 184, 199-201, 206, 292-293, 381; Deletant, p.115-116, 310</ref> The expulsion of Jewish professionals from all walks of life was also carried out in the National Legionary period, and enforced after the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]].<ref>''Final Report'', p.63, 183-214, 220-221, 238, 290-291, 381; Browning, p.211; Deletant, p.103-106, 198-199, 308-314; Ioanid, p.232; Ornea, p.393-394</ref> After a post-Legionary hiatus, "[[Romanianization]]" commissions resumed their work under the supervision of a National Center, and their scope was extended.<ref>''Final Report'', p.19-20, 63, 92, 117, 168-169, 181-182, 185-195, 202-203, 238, 250, 384-385; Deletant, p.106-108, 123, 210-211; Kelso, p.100-101; Ornea, p.393-394</ref> 

Often discussed as a prelude to the [[Holocaust in Romania]] and in connection with Antonescu's views on "[[Jewish Bolshevism]]", the [[Ia<U+015F>i pogrom]] occurred just days after the start of Operation Barbarossa, and was partly instigated, partly tolerated by the authorities in Bucharest. For a while before the massacre, these issued propaganda claiming that the Jews in [[Ia<U+015F>i]], whose numbers had been increased by forced evictions from smaller localities,<ref>''Final Report'', p.120, 243; Ancel (2005 a), p.17-46, 100-108, 403; Deletant, p.130-132</ref> were actively helping Soviet bombers find their targets through the [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]] and plotting against the authorities, with Antonescu himself ordering for the entire community to be expelled from the city on such grounds.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.120-123, 200, 208-209, 244, 329; Ancel (2005 a), p.11-12, 40-46, 49-51, 57-58, 69-70, 73, 100-110, 130, 161-163, 169, 274, 325; Deletant, p.130-134, 138</ref> The discourse appealed to local antisemites, whose murderous rampage, carried out with the officials' complicity, resulted in several thousand deaths among Jewish men, women and children.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.120-126, 200, 204, 208-209, 243-244, 285-286, 315, 323, 323, 327-329; Ancel (2005 a), ''passim''; Browning, p.276-277; Deletant, p.133-140; Ioanid, p.233, 236; Laqueur, p.206; Penkower, p.149; Polonsky & Michlic, p.27; Veiga, p.300, 312; Weber, p.167</ref> 

In the aftermath of the pogrom, thousands of survivors were loaded into the so-called "death trains". These overcrowded and sealed [[C<U+0103>ile Ferate Rom<U+00E2>ne|Romanian Railways]] [[Stock car (rail)|stock cars]] circled the countryside in the extreme heat of the summer, and periodically stopped to unload the dead.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.125-126, 209, 295; Ancel (2005 a), p.12, 130, 151-344; Deletant, p.134-137, 317</ref> It is known that, altogether, at least 4,000 people died during the initial massacre and the transports.<ref>Deletant, p.130, 136-137; Polonsky & Michlic, p.27.

{{main|1941 Odessa massacre}}
The [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]], carried out by the Romanian Army and Gendarmes, took the lives of a minimum of between 15,000<ref>Deletant, p.127</ref> and 25,000<ref>''Final Report'', p.150, 152</ref> to as many as 40,000<ref>Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.393, 398</ref> or even more than 50,000<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref name="glw239">Weinberg, p.239</ref> Jewish people of all ages. The measure came as the enforcement of Antonescu's own orders, being justified by his belief that the original explosion was a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] act (despite the possibility of the building in question having been fitted with [[land mine]]s by the retreating Soviets).<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.151; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.391</ref> In addition, Antonescu blamed the Jews, specifically "Jewish [[commissar]]s" in the [[Red Army]], for the losses suffered by his [[4th Infantry Division (Romania)|4th Army]] throughout the siege,<ref>''Final Report'', p.247; Deletant, p.116-118; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.386-389</ref> although both an inquiry he had ordered and German assessments pointed to the ill-preparedness of Romanian soldiers.<ref>Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.386-389</ref> While the local command took the initiative for the first executions, Antonescu's personal intervention amplified the number of victims required, and included specific quotas (200 civilians for every dead officer, 100 for every dead soldier).<ref>''Final Report'', p.151-153, 245; Deletant, p.171-172, 253; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.392-394. Antonescu's initial order defines the intended victims as "communists", but a later conversation with his ministers exclusively uses "Jews" for the same categories (Deletant, p.171-172; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.393-394).</ref> By the time of the explosion, the Jewish population was already rounded up into makeshift ghettos, being made subject to violence and selective murders.<ref>''Final Report'', p.150; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.389-391</ref>

The authorities themselves counted 24,686 deportees (''Final Report'', p.230; Kelso, p.109). Around 6,000 survivors were recorded alive by late 1944 (Achim, p.179; Deletant, p.195; Kelso, p.130). However, the actual number of survivors may in theory be twice as high (''Final Report'', p.236; Achim, p.179; Deletant, p.4, 6, 195).</ref> 

The Jewish population in the Old Kingdom, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people, survived the Holocaust almost intact.<ref>''Final Report'', p.68-69, 117-118, 168-172, 243, 249, 383, 385-386; Boia, p.260-261; Deletant, p.2, 4, 114-115, 205-229, 235, 334; Ioanid, p.232, 233, 235; Oldson, p.4-11, 161-163; Ornea, p.394-395. See also Ancel, p.231; Penkower, p.148sqq. In these definitions, the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] also includes areas of [[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]] still under Romanian rule after 1940.</ref> Reflecting on this fact, [[Lucian Boia]] noted that Antonescu could not "decently" be viewed as a rescuer of Jews, but that there still is a fundamental difference between the effects of his rule and those of Hitler's, concluding that the overall picture is not "completely dark."<ref>Boia, p.260-261</ref> For Dennis Deletant, this situation is a "major paradox" of Antonescu's time in power: "more Jews survived under [Antonescu's] rule than in any other country within Axis Europe."<ref name="del2"/> American historian of Romania [[William O. Oldson]] views Antonescu's policies as characterized by "violence, inconsistency and inanity",<ref>Oldson, p.162</ref> but places them in the wider context of local antisemitism, noting some ideological exceptions from their respective European counterparts. These traits, he argues, became "providential" for the more [[Assimilated Jew|assimilated]] Jewish communities of the Old Romanian Kingdom, while exposing Jews perceived as foreign.<ref>Oldson, p.4-11, 161-163. See also Deletant, p.275, 354</ref> Discussing Antonescu's policy of [[ethnic cleansing]], Polonksy and Mihlic note: "[it] raises important questions about the thin line between the desire to expel an unwanted minority and a small-scale [[Genocide|genocidal]] project under sanctioned conditions."<ref name="apjbm28"/> American military historian [[Gerhard L. Weinberg]] made reference to the Antonescu regime's "slaughter of large number of Jews in the areas ceded to the Soviet Union in 1940 when those areas were retaken in 1941 as well as in [...] Transnistria", but commented: "the government of Marshal Ion Antonescu preferred to rob and persecute Jews [from Romania]; the government would not turn them over to the Germans for killing."<ref name="glw239"/> 

Alongside the noticeable change in fortunes on the Eastern Front, a main motivator for all post-1943 changes, noted by various historians, was the manifold financial opportunity of Jewish survival.<ref>''Final Report'', p.68-69, 117-118, 120, 168, 171-172, 201, 210, 253-254, 385; Ancel (2005 b), p.231-232, 234-235; Deletant, p.100-101, 112-113, 121-124, 125, 206, 213-214, 311; Oldson, p.7-8, 10-11, 162; Ornea, p.394-395; Penkower, p.148, 153-155; Weinberg, p.239</ref> Wealthier Jews were financially [[Extortion|extorted]] in order to avoid community work and deportation, and the work of some professionals was harnessed by the [[public sector]], and even by the Army.<ref>''Final Report'', p.117-118, 120, 201, 210-217, 385; Deletant, p.108-114, 123-124, 311</ref> From the beginning, the regime had excepted from deportations some Jews who were experts in fields such as [[forestry]] and [[chemistry]], and some others were even allowed to return despite antisemitic protests in their home provinces.<ref>Ancel (2005 b), p.231-232, 234-235. Ancel places blame for the discontent provoked among locals on Antonescu's earlier propaganda themes.</ref> Economic exploitation was institutionalized in late 1941-early 1942, with the creation of a [[Central Jewish Office (Romania)|Central Jewish Office]]. Supervised by Commissioner [[Radu Lecca]] and formally led by the Jewish intellectuals [[Nandor Gingold]] and [[Henric Streitman]], it collected funds which were in part redirected toward [[Maria Antonescu]]'s charities.<ref>''Final Report'', p.201, 212-217; Deletant, p.120-124, 213-214, 216, 312-313</ref> Small numbers of Romanian Jews left independently for the [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] as early as 1941, but [[Aliyah Bet|British opposition]] to [[Zionism|Zionist]] plans made their transfer perilous (one notorious example of this being the ship ''[[Struma (ship)|Struma]]'').<ref>Deletant, p.213-219, 337-338; Penkower, p.149-152, 154-157, 161-163</ref> On a personal level, Antonescu's encouragement of crimes alternated with periods when he gave in to the pleas of Jewish community leader [[Wilhelm Filderman]].<ref>''Final Report'', p.120, 200, 207-210, 247; Deletant, p.71-72, 114, 120-122, 125, 216, 311, 317-318; Ioanid, p.234; Penkower, p.152-153, 157, 161, 169-170</ref> In one such instance, he reversed his own 1942 decision to impose the wearing of [[yellow badge]]s,<ref>''Final Report'', p.120, 200, 209-210, 247; Deletant, p.114, 311; Ioanid, p.234</ref> which nevertheless remained in use everywhere outside the Old Kingdom and, in theory, its Jewish diaspora.<ref>''Final Report'', p.120, 200; Deletant, p.114-115, 124, 184</ref> Assessing these contradictions, commentators also mention the effect of Allied promises to prosecute those responsible for genocide throughout Europe.<ref>Deletant, p.118-119; Ioanid, p.234</ref> In the late stages of the war, Antonescu was attempting to shift all blame for crimes from his regime<ref>''Final Report'', p.251-252; Penkower, p.161</ref> while accusing Jews of "bring[ing] destruction upon themselves".<ref>Deletant, p.119</ref>  

The regime permitted non-deported Romanian Jews and [[United States|American]] charities to send [[humanitarian aid]] into Transnistrian camps, a measure it took an interest in enforcing in late 1942.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.218, 383-384; Deletant, p.100</ref> Deportations of Jews ceased altogether in October of the same year. A common explanation historians propose for this reassessment of policies is the change in Germany's fortunes on the Eastern Front, with mention that Antonescu was considering using the Jewish population as an asset in his dealings with the [[Western Allies]].<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.252-253; Ancel (2005 b), p.231-234; Deletant, p.100-101; Ornea, p.394; Penkower, p.153, 161. The decision appears to have been taken by [[Mihai Antonescu]] at a time when the leader was incapacitated by his 1942 disease (Deletant, p.209-211).</ref> It nevertheless took the regime more than a year to allow more selective Jewish returns from Transnistria, including some 2,000 orphans.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.218-220, 251-252, 383-384; Ancel (2005 b), p.232-234; Deletant, p.118-119, 203-204, 215-225, 338-340</ref> After Transnistria's 1944 evacuation, Antonescu himself advocated the creation of new camps in Bessarabia.<ref>Deletant, p.116-117, 119</ref> In conversations with his cabinet, the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' angrily maintained that surviving Jews were better off than Romanian soldiers.<ref>Deletant, p.118-120, 276</ref>

The policies applied in respect to the Romani population were ambivalent: while ordering the deportation of those he considered criminals, Ion Antonescu was taking some interest in improving the lives of Romani laborers of the [[B<U+0103>r<U+0103>gan Plain]].<ref>''Final Report'', p.237-238; Achim, p.169-170</ref> According to Romanian historian [[Viorel Achim]], although it had claimed the existence of a "Gypsy problem", the Antonescu regime "did not count it among its priorities."<ref>Achim, p.170</ref> By 1943, Antonescu was gradually allowing those deported to return home. Initially, [[Constantin Vasiliu]] allowed the families of soldiers to appeal their deportation on a selective basis.<ref>''Final Report'', p.229; Kelso, p.124-127</ref> Romanian authorities also appear to have been influenced by the objections of Nazi administrators in the ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]'', who feared that the newly-arrived population would outnumber [[Black Sea Germans|local Germans]].<ref>Achim, p.184-185</ref> By January 1944, the central authorities ordered local ones not to send back apprehended fugitives,<ref>Achim, p.180; Kelso, p.128-129</ref> instructed them to provide these with some food and clothing, and suggested [[corporal punishment]] for Romani people who did not adhere to a behavioral code.<ref>Kelso, p.128-129</ref> As the Romanian administrators abandoned Transnistria, most survivors from the group returned on their own in summer 1944.<ref>''Final Report'', p.236-237, 240-241; Achim, p.180; Kelso, p.129-130</ref>

===Antonescu and the Final Solution projects===
Ion Antonescu and his subordinates were for long divided on the issue of the [[Final Solution]], as applied in territories under direct Nazi control from 1941. At an early stage, German attempts to impose the [[RSHA]]'s direct control over Old Kingdom Jews drew some objections from Mihai Antonescu, but the two sides agreed to a common policy in respect to Soviet Jews.<ref>''Final Report'', p.63-65, 126-127</ref> In various of his early 1940s statements, Ion Antonescu favorably mentions the Axis goal of eliminating the Jewish presence in the event of victory.<ref>''Final Report'', p.133-134; Deletant, p.116, 118, 128, 151</ref> The unrestrained character of some Romanian measures in respect to the Jews alarmed Nazi officials, who demanded a methodical form of extermination.<ref>''Final Report'', p.66, 133, 134, 383; Browning, p.276-277; Deletant, p.146, 150-151, 177; Ioanid, p.235; Oldson, p.2, 10; Penkower, p.149</ref> When confronted with German decisions to push back Jews he had expelled before the occupation of Transnistria, Antonescu protested, arguing that he had conformed with Hitler's decisions regarding "eastern Jews".<ref>''Final Report'', p.66, 136; Deletant, p.128, 151</ref> In August 1941, in preparation for the Final Solution's universal application, Hitler remarked: "As for the Jewish question, today in any case one could say that a man like Antonescu, for example, proceeds much more radically in this manner than we have done until now. But I will not rest or be idle until we too have gone all the way with the Jews."<ref>Browning, p.320. Partly rendered in ''Final Report'', p.140.</ref>

By summer 1942, German representatives in Romania obtained Antonescu's approval for deporting the remaining Jewish population to [[extermination camp]]s in [[Occupation of Poland (1939<U+2013>1945)|occupied Poland]].<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.66-69, 167-172, 243, 249, 286, 383; Deletant, p.205-215, 334-336; Ioanid, p.234; Weber, p.150</ref> Among those involved on the German side were mass murderer [[Adolf Eichmann]] and his aide [[Gustav Richter]],<ref>''Final Report'', p.66-69, 172; Deletant, p.205, 209, 212, 334-335; Ioanid, p.234, 235. See also Penkower, p.152</ref> while the Romanian side was represented by Jewish Affairs Commissioner Lecca (reporting to Antonescu himself).<ref>''Final Report'', p.67-69; Deletant, p.208-211; Penkower, p.152-153</ref> Richter directed Lecca in setting up the Central Jewish Office, which he assumed would function as a ''[[Judenrat]]'' to streamline extermination policies.<ref>''Final Report'', p.67; Deletant, p.121-122, 124</ref> According to such plans, only some 17,000 Jews, labeled useful to Romania's economy, were to be exempt.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.171</ref> The transports had already been announced to the [[C<U+0103>ile Ferate Rom<U+00E2>ne|Romanian Railways]] by autumn 1942, but the government eventually decided to indefinitely postpone these measures at the same time as most other deportations to Transnistria.<ref name="drasum2m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.69, 171-172, 243, 249, 383; Deletant, p.127, 208-215, 334-336; Penkower, p.152-153</ref> Antonescu's new orders on the matter were brought up in his conversations with Hitler at [[Schloss Klessheim]], where both leaders show themselves aware of the fate awaiting Jewish deportees to Poland.<ref>Deletant, p.1, 214-215</ref> By then, German authorities charged with the Final Solution's application in [[Eastern Europe]] completely abandoned their plans in respect to Romania.<ref>''Final Report'', p.69, 253; Weinberg, p.239-240</ref> 

According to Oldson, by the final stage of the war Romania rejected "all extreme measures against Jews who could not be proven to be communists."<ref>Oldson, p.7</ref> The planned transports to Palestine, prospects of which irritated Nazi German observers, implied a hope that Allied focus would shift from the regime's previous guilt and, at the same time, looked forward to the payments made in exchange for each person saved.<ref>''Final Report'', p.68-69, 168-172, 252-253, 384; Deletant, p.211, 213-219; Oldson, p.7; Weinberg, p.239-240. In February 1943, Romanian officials announced to the world that they were going to allow "70,000 Jews" departure from Transnistria to Palestine on ships with [[Vatican]] insignia, in exchange for payments. The project was sabotaged by the Nazis, reportedly upon the request of [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the fugitive [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. Antonescu later approached the [[Red Cross]] for similar transfer efforts, including the ill-fated ship ''[[Mefkure]]''. (Penkower, p.148, 153-155, 157. See also Deletant, p.213-218).</ref> The contrary implications of Romanian nationalism, manifested as reluctance over having to obey German commands and to drastic change in general, are occasionally offered as further explanations of the phenomenon.<ref>''Final Report'', p.69, 171-172, 383; Deletant, p.121-122, 210; Oldson, p.4, 8-11, 161-163. According to Penkower (p.153), [[Radu Lecca]] changed orders for the deportation into [[Occupation of Poland (1939<U+2013>1945)|occupied Poland]] immediately after being "snubbed" by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]'s employees.</ref> While reflecting upon the issue of emigration to Palestine, Antonescu also yielded to pleas of the Jewish community leaders, and allowed various Northern Transylvanian Jews fleeing the [[Holocaust in Hungary]] safe passage through Romania.<ref>Deletant, p.216, 218, 225-229, 340-341; Penkower, p.169-170; Weber, p.150</ref> He was doing the same for certain Northern Transylvanian Romani communities who had escaped southwards.<ref>''Final Report'', p.237; Achim, p.170, 185</ref> In that context, Nazi German ideologues began objecting to Antonescu's supposed leniency.<ref>Achim, p.183-184; Deletant, p.228-229</ref> Antonescu nevertheless alternated tolerance of illegal immigration with drastic measures. In early 1944, he issued an order to shoot illegal immigrants, which was probably never enforced by the [[Romanian Border Police|Border Police]]<ref>''Final Report'', p.201; Deletant, p.226-228, 253</ref> (who occasionally turned in Jewish refugees to the German authorities).<ref>Deletant, p.228</ref> The Antonescu regime allowed the extermination of the Romanian Jewish diaspora in other parts of Europe,<ref>''Final Report'', p.173-175; Deletant, p.229; Ioanid, p.244-245; Penkower, p.152</ref> formally opposing their deportation in some cases where it appeared Germany was impinging upon Romania's sovereignty.<ref>''Final Report'', p.173-175, 250-251; Deletant, p.229, 340; Ioanid, p.244-245</ref>

The circumstances of wartime accounted for cautious and ambivalent approaches to Antonescu's rule from among the Romanian political mainstream, which grouped advocates of [[liberal democracy]] and [[anti-fascism]]. According to Gledhill and King: "Romanian liberals had been critical of their government warm relationship with Hitler, which had been developing throughout the 1930s, but the [1940] Soviet attack on Romanian territory left them with little chance but to support Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union."<ref name="jgckwolchik"/> Other authors also cite the [[Greater Romania]]n agenda of the Antonescu executive as a reason behind the widespread acquiescence.<ref>''Final Report'', p.284-285, 320, 324; Deletant, p.319; Gella, p.171; King, p.93-94; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.378-379; White, p.157-158</ref> The tendency was illustrated by [[Dinu Br<U+0103>tianu]], who, in late January 1941, told his [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal]] colleagues that the new "government of generals" was "the best solution possible to the current crisis", urging the group to provide Antonescu with "all the support we can give him."<ref>Deletant, p.69</ref> An early point of contention between Antonescu and the [[National Peasants' Party]] came in spring 1941, when Antonescu's support for the [[Balkans Campaign]] and Romania's claim to parts of [[Vojvodina]] were met with a letter of protest from [[Iuliu Maniu]], which Antonescu dismissed.<ref>Haynes, p.111-113</ref> Maniu and Br<U+0103>tianu also issued several condemnations of Antonescu's decision to continue the war beyond the [[Dniester]].<ref>Deletant, p.51, 84-85, 93-94, 98, 266-267; Kenney, p.93; King, p.94; Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.379</ref> One such letter, signed by both, claimed that, while earlier steps had been "legitimized by the entire soul of the nation, the Romanian people will never consent to the continuation of the struggle beyond our national borders."<ref>King, p.94</ref> Maniu specifically mentioned the possibility of Allied victory, accused Antonescu of diverting attention from the goal of [[Greater Romania]] ([[Northern Transylvania]] included), and stressed that Romania's ongoing participation in the Axis was "troubling enough".<ref>Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.379</ref> 

Antonescu is known to have publicly admonished opposition leaders for their disobedience, which he equated with obstruction,<ref>Deletant, p.93-94, 117-118, 206, 234; Kenney, p.93</ref> and to have monitored their activities through the [[Serviciul Special de Informa<U+0163>ii|Special Intelligence Service]].<ref name="del75">Deletant, p.75</ref> However, some early communiques he addressed to Br<U+0103>tianu also feature offers of resignation, which their recipient reluctantly rejected.<ref>Deletant, p.74, 94, 307</ref> The Germans objected to such ambiguities, and Hitler once advised Antonescu to have Maniu killed, an option which the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' because of the PN<U+0162> leader's popularity with the peasants.<ref name="del75"/> While tolerating contacts between Maniu and the Allies, Antonescu arrested the clandestine British envoys to Romania, thus putting a stop to the 1943 ''[[Operation Autonomous]]''.<ref>Deletant, p.343</ref> In parallel, his relationship with [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Queen Mother Helen]] and Michael rapidly deteriorated after he began advising the royal family on how to conduct its affairs.<ref>Deletant, p.53, 99-100</ref> Voices of dissent regarding Antonescu's policies sometimes came from inside his own camp. Both the officer corps and the General Staff were divided on the issue of war beyond the [[Dniester]], although it is possible that the majority agreed it would bring Northern Transylvania back to Romania.<ref>Tra<U+015F>c<U+0103>, p.378-380</ref> A prominent case was that of [[Iosif Iacobici]], the [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff]], whose objection to the massive transfer of Romanian troops on the Eastern Front resulted in his demotion and replacement with [[Ilie <U+015E>teflea]] (January 1942).<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref name="del92"/> <U+015E>teflea issued similar calls, and Antonescu's eventually agreed to preserve a home army just before the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].<ref>Deletant, p.98, 264, 307</ref> Various other military men extended their protection to persecuted Jews.<ref>''Final Report'', p.292-296</ref> Overall, Antonescu met significant challenges in exercising control over the politicized sectors in the armed forces.<ref>Deletant, p.52</ref> 

Antonescu's [[racial discrimination]] laws and Romania's participation in the Holocaust earned significant objections from various individuals and groups in Romanian society.

===Political underground===

[[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]], future leader of [[Communist Romania]], is second from left]]
Organized [[resistance movement]]s in Antonescu's Romania were comparatively small-scale and marginal. In addition to a [[Zionism|Zionist]] underground which aided Jews to pass through or flee the country,<ref>Deletant, p.216-219, 225-229, 337-339; Oldson, p.7-8; Penkower, p.148sqq</ref> the regime was confronted with local political movements of contrasting shades. One of them comprised [[far left]] and [[left-wing]] elements, which Antonescu's rise to power had caught in an unusual position. The minor [[Romanian Communist Party]], outlawed since the rule of [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] for its [[Comintern]]ist national policies, had been rendered virtually inactive by the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact|German-Soviet non-aggression pact]]. Once reanimated by [[Operation Barbarossa]], the PCR was unable to create an actual [[Resistance during World War II|armed resistance movement]], although it was able to coordinate the policies of several other small leftist groups.<ref>''Final Report'', p.324; Cioroianu, p.44-45, 55, 126-132, 151-154; Deletant, p.238-239, 344; Gella, p.172. In addition to the PCR, these included the [[Ploughmen's Front]] and the [[Socialist Peasants' Party]] (Cioroianu, p.55, 126-127, 132, 151-154).</ref> Speaking shortly before the invasion of the Soviet Union, and adopting the "[[Jewish Bolshevism]]" position, Antonescu ordered authorities to compile lists comprising "the names of all Jewish and communist agents", who were to be kept under close surveillance.<ref>Browning, p.276. See also ''Final Report'', p.65, 243</ref> Among people arrested on suspicion of communism, Jews were sent to Transnistrian sites such as [[Vapniarka]] and [[R<U+00EE>bni<U+0163>a]], while others were interned in regular facilities such as those in [[Caransebe<U+015F>]] and [[T<U+00E2>rgu Jiu]].<ref>''Final Report'', p.104-105, 143; Cioroianu, p.42-52, 132-134; Deletant, p.116, 123, 196-198, 219, 225, 238-239, 254, 303, 311, 332-333, 335-336, 340, 343-344</ref> In all, some 2,000 Jewish Romanian deportees to the region had been accused of [[political crime]]s (the category also included those who had tried to escape forced labor).<ref>''Final Report'', p.143; Ioanid, p.233</ref> According to one estimate, people held on charges of being communists accounted for just under 2,000 people, of whom some 1,200 were jailed in Romania-proper.<ref>Deletant, p.72, 303, 332</ref> [[Capital punishment in Romania|Capital punishment]] was used against various [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]-like activists,<ref>Frankowski, p.217. According to Deletant (p.72), 72 communists believed to be Soviet agents or partisans were executed in 1940-1944, from a total of 313 PCR members sentenced to death. The rest had their sentences commuted.</ref> while the vast majority of communist prisoners in R<U+00EE>bni<U+0163>a were massacred in March 1944.<ref>''Final Report'', p.105; Deletant, p.225</ref> At the other end of the political spectrum, after the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]] and the [[Iron Guard]]'s decapitation, many Legionaries who opposed the regime, and whom Antonescu himself believed were "communists in [Legionary] green shirts",<ref name="del72"/> were killed or imprisoned.<ref>''Final Report'', p.62-63; Deletant, p.71-72, 302-303, 311; Griffin (1993), p.127; Laqueur, p.205; Ornea, p.219, 346; Veiga, p.299, 313. See also Achim, p.169. Antonescu notably ordered the execution of 7 out of 20 Guardists sentenced to death for their roles in the [[Jilava Massacre]] (Deletant, p.302).</ref> An Iron Guardist underground was nevertheless formed locally, and probably numbered in thousands.<ref name="rg93127"/> Some of Antonescu's [[political prisoner]]s from both camps were given a chance to redeem themselves by joining units on the Eastern Front.<ref>They included the Iron Guardist [[Haig Acterian]] (Ornea, p.219) and, possibly, the communist [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]] (Cioroianu, p.134).</ref>

Although repressed, divided and weak, the PCR capitalized on the Soviet victories, being integrated into the mainstream opposition. In parallel, a "prison faction" emerged around [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], opposing both the formal leadership and the group of so-called "Muscovite" communists, who had taken refuge in the Soviet Union before the war.<ref>Cioroianu, p.43-46, 48-52; Deletant, p.332, 344; Roper, p.14-16</ref> While maneuvering for control within the during and after 1944, "prison" communists destroyed a third group, formed around the PCR's nominal leader [[<U+015E>tefan Fori<U+015F>]] (whom they kidnapped and eventually killed).<ref>Cioroianu, p.46, 48-49, 62, 134</ref> The PCR leadership was still suffering from a legitimacy crisis after beginning talks with the larger parties.<ref>Deletant, p.343-344; Gella, p.172; Roper, p.13-16</ref> The Soviets and "Muscovite" communists campaigned among Romanian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in order to have them switch sides, and eventually managed to set up the [[Tudor Vladimirescu Division]].<ref>Cioroianu, p.128, 134-135, 140, 171, 265; Roper, p.14-15; See also Gella, p.172</ref>

===Cultural circles===
Measures enforced by the Ion Antonescu regime had contradictory effects on the [[Culture of Romania|Romanian cultural scene]]. According to Romanian literary historians Leti<U+0163>ia Guran and Alexandru <U+015E>tefan, "the Antonescu regime [...] did not affect negatively [[Modernism|cultural modernity]]. The Romanian cultural elite regarded Antonescu's policies for the most part with sympathy."<ref>Guran & <U+015E>tefan, p.113</ref> Nevertheless, other researchers record the dissent of several cultural environments: the [[classic liberalism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]] of aging literary theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]], the "Lovinescian" [[Sibiu Literary Circle]], and the rebellious [[counterculture]] of young [[avant-garde]] writers ([[Ion Caraion]], [[Geo Dumitrescu]], [[Dimitrie Stelaru]], [[Constant Tonegaru]]).<ref>Neubauer ''et al.'', p.148, 150</ref> Prominent left-wing writers [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Victor Eftimiu]] and [[Zaharia Stancu]] were political prisoners during the Antonescu years.<ref>Neubauer ''et al.'', p.148</ref> Author [[George C<U+0103>linescu]] also stood out against the official guidelines, and, in 1941, took a risk by publishing a synthesis of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] which emphasized Jewish contributions,<ref>Boia, p.259</ref> while composer [[George Enescu]] pleaded with Antonescu personally for the fate of Romani musicians.<ref>''Final Report'', p.238-239</ref> Similar acts of solidarity were performed by various prominent intellectuals and artists.<ref>''Final Report'', p.290-292, 295</ref> In August 1942, King Michael received a manifesto endorsed by intellectuals from various fields, deploring the murders in Transnistria, and calling for a realignment of policies.<ref>''Final Report'', p.300-301; Deletant, p.206-207</ref> Another such document of April 1944 called for an immediate peace with the Soviet Union.<ref>Deletant, p.237</ref> On a more intimate level, a diary kept by philosopher and art critic [[Alice Voinescu]] expresses her indignation over the antisemitic measures and massacres.<ref>Bucur (2006), p.184-186</ref> 

A special aspect of political repression and cultural hegemony was Antonescu's persecution of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Restorationism|Restorationist]] Christian denominations, first outlawed under the National Legionary regime.<ref>Deletant, p.58, 297, 302</ref> Several thousand adherents of the [[Pentecostal Union of Romania|Pentecostal Union]] and the [[Baptist Union of Romania|Baptist Union]] were reportedly jailed in compliance with his orders.<ref>Earl A. Pope, "Protestantism in Romania", in Pedro Ramet, Sabrina P. Ramet (eds.), ''Christianity under Stress.

ISBN 0-8223-1241-7</ref> Persecution targeted groups of religiously-motivated [[conscientious objector]]s. In addition to the [[Inochentism|Inochentist]] movement, these groups included the Pentecostal Union, the [[Romanian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|Seventh-day Adventist Conference]] and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses Association of Romania|Jehovah's Witnesses Association]].<ref>[http://www.r-s-g.info/downloads/rsg-1-2007.pdf "Jehova's Witnesses in East Central, South Eastern and Southern Europe. The Fate of a Religious Minority (book reviews)"], in LIT Verlag's [http://www.r-s-g.info/index.html ''Religion-Staat-Gesellschaft''], 1/2007</ref> Antonescu himself recounted having contemplated using the death penalty against "sects" who would not allow military service, and ultimately deciding in favor of deporting "recalcitrant" ones.<ref>Deletant, p.73, 254</ref>

==Legacy==
===Consequences of the Antonescu trial===
The period following Antonescu's fall returned Romania to a democratic regime and the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 Constitution]], as well as its participation in the war alongside the Allies. However, it also saw the early stages of a communist takeover<U+2014>which culminated with King Michael's forced abdication on December 30, 1947 and the subsequent establishment of [[Communist Romania]]. The Antonescu trial thus fit into a long series of similar procedures and political purges on charges of [[collaborationism]], instrumented by the [[Romanian People's Tribunals]] and various other institutions.<ref>''Final Report'', p.313-331; Cioroianu, p.130-131, 265-268, 295-297; Gella, p.173; Ioanid, p.235-237. See also Deletant, p.264, 347, 349; Weber, p.158-159</ref> During the rigged [[Romanian general election, 1946|general election of 1946]] and for years after Ion Antonescu's execution, the [[Romanian Communist Party]] and its allies began using the implications of his trial as an abusive means of compromising some of their political opponents.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.315-316, 324; Deletant, p.249-250, 349; Ioanid, p.235</ref> One such early example was [[Iuliu Maniu]], by then one of the country's prominent [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]], who was accused of being a fascist and an Antonescu sympathizer, mainly for having shaken his hand during the trial.<ref name="drasum3m"/> The enlistment of [[Germans of Romania|ethnic Germans]] into Nazi German units, as approved by Antonescu, was used as a pretext for the community's [[Expulsion of Germans from Romania after World War II|Soviet-led expulsion]].<ref name="rw136"/><ref>Cioroianu, p.266-267</ref> On similar grounds, the [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation forces]] organized the capture of Romanian citizens, together with the return of war refugees from Romania-proper into Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, both of which often culminated into [[Soviet deportations from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|deportations further inland]].<ref>Ancel (2005 b), p.235-236, 241; Gella, p.173</ref> As part of its deteriorating relationship with [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Romanian Roman Catholics]], and urged on by the Soviets, the communist cabinet of [[Petru Groza]] also deemed [[Apostolic Nuncio]] [[Andrea Cassulo]] a collaborator of Antonescu and a ''[[persona non grata]]'', based on transcripts of the Cassulo-Antonescu conversations.<ref>Kent, p.109-110</ref> It also used such allegations to pressure several [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] clergymen into accepting union with the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].<ref name="Kent, p.224"/>

Nevertheless, Romanian-born Holocaust historian [[Radu Ioanid]] notes, few of Romanians involved in organizing the Holocaust were prosecuted, and, of those, none were executed after the Antonescu trial. He attributes this to nationalist resistance within the administrative and judicial apparatus, to communist fears of alienating a too large number of people, to the emigration of [[Zionism|Zionist]] survivors, and to the open hostility of some communists toward liberal Jewish community leaders.<ref>Ioanid, p.235-236</ref> The conflict with the new authorities and the majority population is also described by other researchers.<ref>''Final Report'', p.316, 339; Ancel (2005 b), p.235-256; Weber, p.152-159, 164-167. Ancel discusses in particular the influx of [[Zionism|Zionists]] fleeing Soviet rule in the late 1940s, the renewed antisemitic violence of the period, as well as the various clashes between Romanian officials and Jewish community leaders both before and after the communist takeover.</ref> Sporadic trials for Holocaust-related crimes still occurred, including one of [[Maria Antonescu]]. Arrested in September 1944 and spending the 1945-1946 interval in Soviet custody, she was re-arrested at home in 1950, tried and ultimately found guilty of economic crimes for her collaboration with the [[Central Jewish Office (Romania)|Central Jewish Office]].<ref>Deletant, p.313, 350</ref> Five years later, she was sent into internal exile, and died of heart problems in 1964.<ref>Deletant, p.350</ref> A large number of convicted war criminals, even some sentenced to life imprisonment, were deemed fit for social cohabitation and released after 1950, while some suspects were never prosecuted.<ref>''Final Report'', p.281, 315, 317-318</ref>

===In communist historiography===
Although isolated mentions of the Holocaust were made in the [[Marxism|Marxist]] analytical works of the increasingly marginalized communist figure [[Lucre<U+0163>iu P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]],<ref>''Final Report'', p.337-338; Ioanid, p.233, 244; Weber, p.161</ref> the heavily-politicized official discourse inspired by [[Soviet historiography]] provided an interpretation of Romania's wartime evolution exclusively based on [[Marxism-Leninism]] and its idea of [[class conflict]].<ref>''Final Report'', p.321-331, 335-339, 347, 385; Deletant, p.3-4, 262-263; Weber, p.157, 159, 166-167</ref> In this context, the main effort for documenting and exposing the Antonescu-era massacres came from among Jewish Romanians. This began in 1945, when Jewish journalists Marius Mircu and Maier Rudrich contributed first-hand testimonies.<ref>Ioanid, p.236.

===Debates of the 1990s===
Several shifts occurred in Antonescu's image after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] which toppled communism. Polls carried out in the 1990s show the ''Conduc<U+0103>tor'' was well-liked by portions of the general public.<ref>Boia, p.28-29, 340, 344; Shafir, p.230</ref> This tendency, Lucian Boia argues, was similar to a parallel trend favoring [[Wallachia]]'s 15th century [[Prince of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Vlad III the Impaler]], indicating both a preference for "authoritarian solutions" and "a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] that was largely set in place in the 'Ceau<U+015F>escu era' ".<ref>Boia, p.28-29</ref> An attitude which saw the 1944 Coup as exclusively the onset of [[communization]] in Romania also achieved popularity at the time,<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.319, 322, 330-331; Boia, p.340-341; Bucur (2004), p.178; Deletant, p.270-271</ref> while certain sections of the public opinion revived the notion of "[[Jewish Bolshevism]]", accusing Jews of having brought communism to Romania.<ref>Boia, p.259; Deletant, p.270-271</ref> Such reflexes were placed by British historian [[Tony Judt]] in connection with growing [[anti-Russian sentiment]] and Holocaust denial in various countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]], and collectively termed "mis-memory of anti-communism".<ref>[[Tony Judt]], "The Past is Another Country: Myth and Memory in Post-war Europe", in Jan-Werner M<U+00FC>ller (ed.), ''Memory and Power in Post-war Europe'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2002, p.175.

A particular case in the process was that of forces gathered around the [[Greater Romania Party]], a group often characterized as merging [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] or neofascist messages and the legacy of Ceau<U+015F>escu's national communism.<ref>''Final Report'', p.349, 350, 351, 353-354, 359, 373-374; Boia, p.340-341; Geran Pilon, p.67-71; Ioanid, p.246, 250-252; Laqueur, p.203-205; Shafir, p.214-215.

Various researchers argue that the overall tendency was endorsed by the ruling [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] and its successor group, later known as [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]],<ref>Boia, p.340-341; Deletant, p.269-270; Ioanid, p.247-250, 251-252; Kenney, p.93; Laqueur, p.205</ref> who complimented emerging pro-authoritarian lobby while depicting their common opponent King Michael and his supporters as traitors.<ref>Boia, p.340-341; Deletant, p.269, 270; Kenney, p.93</ref> Sections of both governing and opposition groups contemplated the idea of rehabilitating the wartime leader, and, in May 1991, [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] observed a moment of silence in his memory.<ref>Deletant, p.270; Ioanid, p.247</ref> The perceived government tolerance of Antonescu's promotion raised concern and protests at an international level.<ref name="drasum3m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.360-362; Boia, p.29; Ioanid, p.249-250, 252; Kenney, p.93</ref> Political recognition of Antonescu's complicity was first expressed in 1997 by Romanian President [[Emil Constantinescu]], a representative of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention|Democratic Convention]].<ref>''Final Report'', p.374-375; Deletant, p.271-272</ref> Nevertheless, during the same period, [[Attorney General]] [[Sorin Moisescu]] followed a since-deprecated special [[appeal]] procedure to overturn sentences passed against Antonescu and other 1946 defendants, but eventually withdrew it.<ref>''Final Report'', p.349</ref> 

To a certain degree, such pro-Antonescu approaches were also present in the post-1989 historiographic school. Reflecting back on this phenomenon in 2004, [[Maria Bucur]] wrote: "the perverse image of Antonescu is not the product of a propaganda campaign led by right-wing extremists, but a pervasive myth fed by historical debates and political contests, and which the public seems indifferent to or accepts unproblematically."<ref>Bucur (2004), p.158</ref> After the Revolution, archival sources concerning Ion Antonescu, including those in the [[National Archives of Romania]], were made more available to researchers, but documents confiscated or complied by Soviet officials, kept in [[Russia]], remained largely inaccessible.<ref>Deletant, p.2, 3, 5</ref> Although confronted with more evidence from the newly-opened archives, several historians, including some employed by official institutions, continued to deny the [[Holocaust in Romania]], and attributed the death toll exclusively to German units.<ref>[[R<U+00E9>gine Robin]], "Une juste m<U+00E9>moire, est-ce possible?", in Thomas Ferenczi (ed.), ''Devoir de m<U+00E9>moire, droit <U+00E0> l'oubli?'', <U+00C9>ditions Complexe, Paris, 2002, p.109.

In 2003, after a period in which his own equivocal stance on the matter had drawn controversy,<ref>''Final Report'', p.361, 374; Deletant, p.270-273</ref> Constantinescu's successor [[Ion Iliescu]] established the [[Wiesel Commission]], an international scientific body whose mission was the study of the Holocaust in Romania, later succeeded by the [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania|Elie Wiesel National Institute]].

The same year, on December 5, the Bucharest Court of Appeals overturned Antonescu's conviction for certain [[crimes against peace]], on the grounds that the objective conditions of 1940 justified a [[preventive war]] against the Soviet Union, which would make Article 3 of the 1933 Convention for the Definition of Aggression inapplicable in his case<ref name="bbcmdcrit"/><ref name="medfreabil">{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/justitie/reabilitarea-numelui-maresalului-antonescu-respinsa.html?4727;2616337 "Reabilitarea numelui mare<U+015F>alului Antonescu, respins<U+0103>"],''[[Mediafax]]'', May 6, 2008</ref><ref name="ccchisinau">{{ro icon}} Claudia Ciobanu, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/pentru_chisinau_antonescu_ramine_criminal_de_razboi-22531.htm "Pentru Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u, Antonescu ram<U+00EE>ne criminal de r<U+0103>zboi"], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', February 23, 2007</ref> (as well as in those of Alexianu, [[Constantin Pantazi]], [[Constantin Vasiliu]], Sima and various Iron Guard politicians).<ref name="medfreabil"/> This act raised official protests in [[Moldova]], the independent state formed in Bessarabia upon the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985<U+2013>1991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]], and in Russia, the Soviet [[Succession of states|successor state]], as well as criticism by historians of the Holocaust.<ref name="bbcmdcrit"/><ref name="ccchisinau"/><ref>{{ro icon}} Claudia Ciobanu, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/rusia_il_considera_pe_antonescu_criminal_de_razboi-22810.html "Rusia <U+00EE>l consider<U+0103> pe Antonescu criminal de r<U+0103>zboi"], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', February 23, 2007</ref> The Court of Appeals decision was overturned by the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice (Romania)|Romanian Supreme Court]] in May 2008.<ref name="medfreabil"/> The same year, Maria Antonescu's collateral inheritors advanced a claim on a [[Predeal]] villa belonging to the couple, but a [[Bra<U+015F>ov]] tribunal rejected their request, citing laws which confiscated the property of war criminals.<ref>{{ro icon}} Ionel Stoica, Dan Sebastian, [http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/batalie-in-justitie-pe-vila-de-un-milion-de-euro-din-predeal-a-maresalului-antonescu.html "B<U+0103>t<U+0103>lie <U+00EE>n justi<U+0163>ie pe vila de un milion de euro din Predeal a mare<U+015F>alului Antonescu"], in ''[[Adev<U+0103>rul]]'', September 26, 2008</ref>

===Cultural legacy, portrayals and landmarks===
Beyond their propaganda and censorship efforts, Antonescu and his regime had a sizable impact on [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], [[Art of Romania|art]] and [[Literature of Romania|literature]]. Owing to guidelines and circumstances, the direct imprint is however reduced in comparison to other periods in the country's history. A general characteristic of the war years was the abandonment of large heroes' memorials, and works of this nature produced at the time were mainly roadside [[triptych]]s (''troi<U+0163>e'').<ref>Bucur (2004), p.172</ref> A proposal to raise a major monument of this category in place of Bucharest's Jewish cemetery, for which the Heroes' Cult organization had received expropriation rights in 1942, was eventually abandoned.<ref>Bucur (2004), p.172-173</ref> Antonescu and his wife preferred donating to Orthodox churches, and were ''[[ktitor]]s'' of three churches in separate Bucharest areas: M<U+0103>rgeanului Church in [[Rahova]], one in [[D<U+0103>m<U+0103>roaia]], and the Saints Constantine and Helena Church in [[Muncii]], where both the Marshal and his wife are depicted in a mural.<ref name="dsbiserica"/> After floods took a toll on his native [[Arge<U+015F> County]], the Marshal himself established ''Antone<U+015F>ti'', a [[model village]] in [[Corbeni]] (partly built by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and later passed into state property), while ordering the [[Arge<U+015F> River]]'s [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] exploitation.<ref>{{ro icon}} Ion Longin Popescu, [http://www.formula-as.ro/2008/823/mica-enciclopedie-as-27/un-sat-istoric-antonesti-9737 "Un sat istoric: Antone<U+015F>ti"], in ''[[Formula As]]'', Nr. 823, June 2008</ref> He also had sporadic contacts with the artistic and literary environment, including an interview he awarded to his supporter, writer [[Ioan Alexandru Br<U+0103>tescu-Voine<U+015F>ti]].<ref>Deletant, p.98, 118, 231</ref> His 1946 trial was notably attended and documented by [[George C<U+0103>linescu]] in a series of articles for ''[[Na<U+0163>iunea]]'' journal.<ref>Deletant, p.251</ref> Political humor of the 1940s preserved distinct images of the Romanian leader. [[Romanian humor|Romanian jokes]] circulated under Antonescu's rule ridiculed his adoption of the [[Marshal of Romania]] title, viewing it as a self-promotion and dubbing him the "Auto-Marshal".<ref>Deletant, p.305</ref> During the war, Soviet [[agitprop]] portrayed Antonescu and the other secondary Axis leaders as villains and servile dog-like creatures, representations notably present in [[musical theater]] and [[puppetry]] shows,<ref>Richard Stites, "Frontline Entertainment", in Richard Stites (ed.), ''Culture and Entertainment in Wartime Russia'', [[Indiana University Press]], Bloomington & Indianapolis, p.135-136.

A consequence of the Ceau<U+015F>escu regime's ambiguous relationship with Antonescu was ''[[Delirul]]'', a novel written by [[Marin Preda]] in 1975. Critics John Neubauer and [[Marcel Cornis-Pope]] remark that the novel is "admittedly not [Preda's] best work", and discuss Antonescu's "complex representation" as "an essentially flawed but active leader who tried to negotiate some maneuvering room between the demands of Germany and the threats of the Soviet Union [and whose failure] led to the dismantling of Romania's fragile democratic system."<ref>Neubauer ''et al.'', p.174</ref> The book sought Antonescu's rehabilitation for his attitudes on the Bessarabia-Northern Bukovina issue, but did not include any mention of his antisemitic policies, which Preda himself may have ignored.<ref>Deletant, p.267-268; Ioanid, p.239</ref> An international scandal followed once negative comments on the book were published by the Soviet magazine ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]''.<ref>Deletant, p.268; Ioanid, p.239</ref> Although an outspoken nationalist, [[Eugen Barbu]] produced a satirical image of Antonescu in his own 1975 novel, ''Incognito'', the end result of which was described by Deletant as "character assassination".<ref>Deletant, p.267</ref> 

During the 1990s, monuments to Antonescu were raised and streets were named after him in Bucharest, and several other cities.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.359-361; Bucur (2004), p.158, 178; Ioanid, p.251-252; Kenney, p.93; Ramet, p.173</ref> Among those directly involved in this process were [[Iosif Constantin Dr<U+0103>gan]],<ref name="dsbiserica"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.360; Ioanid, p.251; Shafir, p.215</ref> the nationalist [[List of mayors of Cluj-Napoca|Mayor]] of [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Gheorghe Funar]],<ref>''Final Report'', p.360; Shafir, p.215</ref> and General [[Mircea Chelaru]], whose resignation from the Army was subsequently requested and obtained.<ref name="dsbiserica"/> Also during that interval, in 1993, filmmaker and [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic]] politician [[Sergiu Nicolaescu]] produced ''[[Oglinda]]'', in which Antonescu, played by [[Ion Siminie]], is the subject of an apologetic depiction.<ref>Ioanid, p.251</ref> The rehabilitation trend was also represented at an October 1994 commemorative exhibit at the [[National Military Museum (Romania)|National Military Museum]].<ref>Bucur (2004), p.178</ref> The same year, a denialist [[documentary film]], ''Destinul mare<U+015F>alului'' ("The Marshal's Destiny"), was distributed by state-owned companies, a matter which raised concern.<ref>Ioanid, p.252</ref> As the Wiesel Commission presented its findings and such public endorsement was outlawed, statues in Antonescu's likeness were torn down or otherwise made unavailable for public viewing.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref name="drasum3m"/><ref name="dsbiserica"/><ref>''Final Report'', p.359-361</ref> An unusual case is that of his Saints Constantine and Helena Church, where, after lengthy debates,<ref name="dsbiserica"/> his bust was sealed inside a metal box.<ref name="drasum1m"/><ref name="drasum3m"/> Outside of this context, the publicized display of Antonescu's portraits and racist slogans by [[Football hooliganism|football hooligans]] during [[Liga I]]'s [[Divizia A 2005<U+2013>06|2005-2006 season]] prompted [[UEFA]] intervention (''see [[Racism Breaks the Game]]'').<ref>[[Mihir Bose]], [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2364962/Johansson-worried-by-Romanian-racist-antics.html "Johansson Worried by Romanian Racist Antics"], in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', September 7, 2005</ref>
