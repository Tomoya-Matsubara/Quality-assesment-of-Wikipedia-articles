'''Mitral valve repair''' is a [[cardiac surgery]] procedure performed by [[cardiac surgeon]]s to treat [[stenosis]] (narrowing) or [[Regurgitation (circulation)|regurgitation]] (leakage) of the [[mitral valve]]. The mitral valve is the "inflow valve" for the left side of the [[heart]]. [[Blood]] flows from the [[lungs]], where it picks up oxygen, through the [[pulmonary vein]]s, to the [[left atrium]] of the heart. After the left atrium fills with blood, the mitral valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium into the heart's main pumping chamber called the left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. It then closes to keep blood from leaking back into the left atrium or lungs when the ventricle contracts (squeezes) to push blood out to the body. It has two flaps, or leaflets.

The techniques of mitral valve repair include inserting a cloth-covered ring around the valve to bring the leaflets into contact with each other ([[Mitral Valve Annuloplasty|annuloplasty]]), removal of redundant/loose segments of the leaflets (quadrangular resection),  re-suspension of the leaflets with artificial ([[Gore-Tex]]) cords.

Procedures on the mitral valve usually require a [[median sternotomy]], but advances in non-invasive methods (such as [[keyhole surgery]]) allow surgery without a sternotomy (and resulting pain and scar).  [[Minimally Invasive Heart Surgery|Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery]] is much more technically demanding and may involve higher risk.

Occasionally, the mitral valve is abnormal from birth ([[congenital]]). More often the mitral valve becomes abnormal with age ([[Degeneration (medical)|degenerative]]) or as a result of [[rheumatic fever]]. In rare instances the mitral valve can be destroyed by infection or a bacterial [[endocarditis]]. Mitral regurgitation may also occur as a result of [[ischemic heart disease]] (coronary artery disease) or non-ischemic heart disease (dilated cardiomyopathy).

== History ==

In 1923 Dr. [[Elliott Cutler]] of the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital|Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]] performed the world<U+2019>s first successful heart valve surgery - a mitral valve ''repair''. The patient was a 12-year-old girl with [[rheumatic heart disease|rheumatic mitral stenosis]]. 

The development of the heart-lung machine in the 1950s paved the way for ''replacement'' of the mitral valve with an [[Artificial heart valve|artificial valve]] in the 1960s. For decades after, [[mitral valve replacement]] was the only surgical option for patients with a severely diseased mitral valve. However, there are some significant downsides to a [[artificial heart valve|prosthetic mitral valve]]. Infection of the valve can occur, which is dangerous and difficult to treat. Patients with mechanical heart valves are required to take [[Anti-coagulant|blood thinners]] for the rest of their lives which presents a risk of bleeding complications. The artificial mitral valve has an elevated risk of stroke. Finally, artificial tissue valves will wear out - on average lasting between 10 and 15 years, requiring further surgery at an advanced age. 

In the past two decades, some surgeons have embraced surgical techniques to repair the damaged native valve, rather than replace it. These techniques were pioneered by a French heart surgeon, [[Alain F. Carpentier|Dr. Alain F. Carpentier]]. A repair still involves major cardiac surgery but for many patients presents the significant advantage of avoiding [[Anti-coagulant|blood thinners]] and may provide a more durable result. Not all damaged valves are suitable for repair; in some, the state of valve disease is too advanced and replacement is necessary. Often, a surgeon must decide during the operation itself whether a ''repair'' or ''replacement'' is the best course of action. 

There has been great debate about timing of surgery in patients with asymptomatic mitral valve regurgitation. 

The traditional surgical approach to a mitral valve repair is a full or partial [[Median sternotomy|sternotomy]], in which the surgeon cuts through the breastbone at the center of the chest to access the heart.  There are [[Minimally Invasive Heart Surgery|minimally invasive]] (port access) options available pioneered by Hugo Vanerman in Belgium.  The minimally invasive approach does not involve cutting the breastbone, but instead uses multiple incisions in the side of the chest and the leg. Cardiac surgeons are not unanimous about the relative merits of sternotomy versus the minimally invasive approach. The minimally invasive approach can produce a less prominent scar, is beneficial for very obese patients, and may allow the patient to return to their normal activity sooner than a sternotomy. But some cardiac surgeons argue that unless performed by the most experienced cardiac centers, minimally invasive surgery can involve a longer time on a bypass machine, a lower repair rate, and higher (although still low) risk of stroke. One cardiac surgery professor said, "I think the only benefit is for cosmesis for the patient and the benefit is for marketing and growing our practices for ourselves because it<U+2019>s a good way to grow one<U+2019>s practice."<ref>http://www.mitralvalverepair.org/content/view/260/ Ani Anyanwu, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, "'Minimally Invasive Surgery' - Facts", MitralValveRepair.org, October 13, 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref>

Robotic mitral valve repair operations are also being tested at some medical centers.

In the 2000s there have been several trials of a newer strategy of mitral valve repair that does not require major cardiac surgery. Through a catheter inserted in the groin, the valve leaflets are clipped together. This technique -- [[percutaneous]] mitral valve repair<U+2014>is available in Europe but still in clinical trial in the United States. It is a highly specialized technique only available at select hospitals. Early trial results suggest that it may be a beneficial approach for patients who are at high risk from conventional surgery.<ref>[http://www.mitralregurgitation.org/Pages/EVEREST.html Mitral Valve Prolapse, Functional MR, Cardiac Surgery, Degenerative MR, and Cardiomyopathy - Evalve, Inc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/HFC/26632 Crystal Phend, "HFC: Mitral Valve Clip Viable When Surgery Too Risky", MedPageToday.com, 22 May 2011.
