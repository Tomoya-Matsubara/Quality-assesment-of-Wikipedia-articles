'''Durant''' is a city in [[Bryan County, Oklahoma|Bryan County]], [[Oklahoma]], [[United States]]. The population was 13,549 at the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], but in the [[2007]] estimate, it had risen to 16,161.  Durant is the principal city of the Durant [[List of United States micropolitan areas|Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which had a population of 39,563 in 2007.  It was founded by Dixon Durant, a Choctaw who lived in the area, after the [[Missouri<U+2013>Kansas<U+2013>Texas Railroad|MK&T railroad]] came through the Indian Territory in the early 1870s.  It became the [[county seat]] of [[Bryan County, Oklahoma|Bryan County]]{{GR|6}} in 1907 after Oklahoma statehood.  Durant is home to [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]] and the headquarters of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]].  Durant ranks as the second largest city within the Choctaw Nation, following [[McAlester, Oklahoma|McAlester]], and ahead of [[Poteau, Oklahoma|Poteau]]. The city has officially been recognized as the [[Magnolia tree|Magnolia]] Capital of Oklahoma, and the SOSU campus is known as "The Campus of a Thousand Magnolias".

==History==
The Durant area was once claimed by both Spain and France before officially becoming part of the United State after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and [[Adams-Onis Treaty]].  During the 1820s and 1830s the area was designated as part of the Choctaw Nation in the southern Indian Territory.  During the [[Indian removal]]s the Choctaws followed the [[Choctaw Trail of Tears]] from their ancestral homeland in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] into this area.  The Choctaw Nation originally extended from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border in the west (now part of the [[Texas panhandle]]) to the [[Arkansas Territory]] in the east, from the Red River in the south to the [[South Canadian River]] in the north.  

Pierre Durant and his four sons, all of French-Choctaw origin, made the journey up the Trail of Tears on the way to the southeastern part of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw Nation]] in 1832. The brothers, grown, with families of their own, established homesteads from the Arkansas line to Durant.  One son, Fisher, married to a full blood [[Choctaw]], found a beautiful location for a home between Durant's present Eight and Ninth Avenues. 

Fisher Durant's son Dixon Durant is recognized as the founder of Durant and is honored as its namesake. As an early day minister, businessman and civic leader, Dixon Durant is credited with pastorates in local Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Methodist churches.  He established the first store selling general merchandise and possibly influenced the 1872 creation of the [[Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad]] (Katy Railroad) siding at Durant, thus producing the initial impetus for establishing the community.

A [[post office]] for <U+201C>Durant Station<U+201D> was authorized in 1879, evidence that a village of some size had developed during the seven years since the coming of the railroad. A.E. Fulsom was post master. Discontinued in 1881, the post office re-established in 1882 with the address as <U+201C>Durant, Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory.<U+201D> The word <U+201C>station<U+201D> was never again used as part of the official name for the community.

W.H. Hilton was elected as the first mayor of Durant.

A memorable event in Durant<U+2019>s rail history occurred on April 5, 1905. A special southbound Katy train stopped in the city with none other than President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] aboard.

Bryan County was created from Choctaw lands in 1907, the same time as statehood, and was named after [[William Jennings Bryan]]. He was nominated three times for [[President of the United States]] and at the age of 36 lost to [[William McKinley]]. He also lost to [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[William H. Taft]]. Woodrow Wilson appointed Bryan as [[United States Secretary of State]].

=== Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma ===
[[Image:choctawcasinoresort.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The Choctaw Casino Resort, looking east.]]

The [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]] has a huge impact on Durant's economy, especially the [[Choctaw Casino Resort]] and the [[Choctaw Casino Bingo]] located between Durant and [[Calera, Oklahoma|Calera]] along [[U.S. Route 69|U.S. 69]]/[[U.S. Route 75|75]], which is a thriving area with economic success.

[[File:choctaw nation 2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Choctaw Nation Headquarters.]]

In [[1894]], [[Calvin Institute]], one of a few schools for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youths, was established in Durant. The school was to change its name twice more (Durant Presbyterian College in [[1900]], and Oklahoma Presbyterian College in [[1910]]), and by [[1899]] it had attracted an enrollment of 300. The school eventually became known as Oklahoma Presbyterian College. This was accomplished shortly after Oklahoma was admitted to the Union as a State. The support for the school came from the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]], the federal government, and several denominational missionary boards. Because of financial difficulties, the school was closed as a learning institution in the late 1960s.

Chief Clark David Gardner wished to establish the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw Nation]] administrative offices at the old Oklahoma Presbyterian College Building in [[1975]].

In [[1976]], in cooperation with the Durant Chamber of Commerce and the owners of the buildings, the [[Red River Valley Historical Association]], title was transferred into the [[federal government of the United States]]. Impressive ceremonies were held August 17, 1976, commemorating the title transfer. Reacquisition of this building allowed centralization of government which permits more effective utilization of personnel in administering current programs and developing future programs. The buildings has been renovated, and administration of many Choctaw programs are headquartered there.

Calvin Institute was originally the North Building of the Choctaw Nation Headquarters. The establishment of Oklahoma Presbyterian College lead to the construction of the current South Building of the CNHQ. After Choctaw Nation had acquired the former OPC buildings, Choctaw Nation built a third structure, the Financial Building, to accommodate growth. The Nation and has since then built several other structures behind the main buildings to accommodate even more growth, creating today's complex.

Though the Capitol of the Choctaw Nation is recognized as being [[Tuskahoma, Oklahoma|Tuskahoma]], the administrative offices remain at the old Presbyterian College, formerly the old Calvin Institute. The Choctaws have strong ties with the school, being a part of their [[Culture of the Choctaw|culture]], history and religion, having served as one of the early educational institutions for their people.

The largest employer in Durant is the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]], including the [http://www.choctawnation.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home Choctaw Nation Headquarters] and the [http://www.choctawcasinos.com/summary_durant.asp Choctaw Casino Resort], which has two Choctaw Travel Plazas, two Choctaw casinos, the Choctaw Inn, and many more facilities that are located in the resort with more plans of construction. Over 5,400 people work for the Choctaw Nation in Durant.

Another important part of Durant's economy is the city's Historic Central Business District and the Retail District. In the past few years, Downtown Durant has seen growth, renewal projects such as streetscaping, and new businesses arriving. Durant is part of the [[Main Street Program]]. The Retail District is west of Downtown, at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 69|U.S. 69]]/[[U.S. Route 75|75]] and [[U.S. Route 70|U.S. 70]], and is Durant's fastest growing area.

[[The Hollow Tree]] is a local lunch shop, gift shop, and nail salon. It is run by former teachers, where other teachers and their families like to visit. The store is named after the literature book.

Cardinal Glass Industries has a float glass manufacturing facility in western Durant. It became operational in July 2004. This plant is number twenty for Cardinal Glass Industries. This is the largest single investment, ever made, in Durant and Bryan County, an investment of $122,000,000.

[[Big Lots]] has a {{convert|1200000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. distribution center in the southern part of Durant, it became operational in January 2004. This represents the second largest investment ever for Durant, and the county, of $80,000,000.

Durant is home to the headquarters of [[First United Bank]], one of the largest privately owned banks in the [[United States]], and [[First Texoma National Bank]]. Indian Nation Wholesale, also headquartered in Durant, is the 15<sup>th</sup> largest [[wholesaler]] in the [[United States]] as of [[2008]] <ref>http://www.csnews.com/csnews/images/pdf/top25wholesalers.pdf</ref>.

Durant has a [[Lowe's]].

Durant has an independent local grocer called Green Spray, which suffered fire damaged and was closed for years. It was renovated in 2009.

Durant's [[Wal-Mart Supercenter]] opened in 2003, which was unusual considering the city's size of the time (13,000 people), in which most cities of that size already do have a Supercenter. The Durant citizens relied on several grocery stores before 2003. Smaller stores are Green Spray, [[Save-A-Lot]], and Nichol's Dollar Saver. Two more food centers were large [[warehouse]]s and were near the former Wal-Mart location. They were Super H, and Dollar Saver Food Warehouse. Many of the department stores vacated when the Wal-Mart Supercenter opened,such as Dollar Saver. Nichol's Dollar Saver and Dollar Saver Feed moved into the Northwest Shopping Center, formerly containing [[Winn-Dixie]]. Super H closed completely and was renovated for two department stores. The former Wal-Mart location was also renovated for two stores. Dollar Saver was renovated for one large store or other business. Until 2003, the nearest Wal-Mart Supercenter was [[Denison, Texas]], The square footage of the Supercenter in Durant is approximately 195,000 square feet, the largest in the area.
