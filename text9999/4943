Yoshimasa was the son of the sixth shogun [[Ashikaga Yoshinori]].<ref>Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' p.  342.|page=342}}</ref>

On the August 16, 1443 (''Kakitsu 3, 21st  day of the 7th month''), 10-year-old shogun Yoshikatsu died of injuries sustained in a fall from a horse.  He had been shogun for only three years.  Immediately, the ''bakufu'' elevated Yoshinari, the young shogun's even younger brother, to be the new shogun.<ref>Titsingh, {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|p. 342|page=342}}; Screech, Timon. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779<U+2013>1822,'' p.  234 n.10; n.b., Yoshikatsu (b. 1434 <U+2013> d. 1443) = 8yrs. In this period, "children were considered one year old at birth and became two the following New Year's Day; and all people advanced a year that day, not on their actual birthday."</ref>  Several years after becoming shogun, Yoshinari changed his name to Yoshimasa, by which name he is better known.<ref>Titsingh, {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|p. 346.|page=346}}</ref>

==Shogunal succession==
Significant events which shaped the period during which Yoshimasa was shogun:

===Events leading up to civil war===
A number of decisions lead eventually to armed conflict:
* 1454 <U+2013> Dissension of Hatakeyama succession.<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1455 <U+2013> Dissension in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] between Kub<U+014D> and his [[Uesugi clan|Uesugi]] ''Kanrei'' [[line]]: "Koga Kub<U+014D>" (1455<U+2013>1583) established.<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1457 <U+2013> "Horikoshi Kub<U+014D>" (1457<U+2013>1491) established.<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1458 <U+2013> Imperial regalia restored to [[Northern Court]].<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1460 <U+2013> Hatakeyama rebels against Yoshimasa.<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1464 <U+2013> Yoshimasa adopts [[Ashikaga Yoshimi]].<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1466 <U+2013> Yoshihisa born; [[Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado]] ascends throne.<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1466 <U+2013> Dissension over Shiba succession.<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1467 <U+2013> Outbreak of [[<U+014C>nin War]].<ref>In the name "''[[<U+014C>nin]]'' War," the noun "''<U+014C>nin''" refers to the ''[[neng<U+014D>]]''  ([[Japanese era name]]) after "''[[Bunsh<U+014D>]]''" and before "''[[Bunmei]]''."  In other words, the ''<U+014C>nin''  war occurred during the ''<U+014C>nin'' era, which was a time period spanning the years from 1467 through 1469.  Although the fighting continued long after, the conflict came to be identified with the ''neng<U+014D>'' in which it began.</ref>

==<U+014C>nin War==
{{main|<U+014C>nin War}}
By 1464, Yoshimasa had no heir, so he adopted his younger brother, [[Ashikaga Yoshimi]], in order to avoid any conflicts which might arise at the end of his shogunate. However, in the next year, Yoshimasa was surprised by the birth of a son. The infant's birth created a conflict between the two brothers over who would follow Yoshimasa as shogun. By 1467 the simmering dispute had evolved, encouraging a split amongst the powerful ''[[daimy<U+014D>]]'' and clan factions. The armed conflict which ensued has come to be known as the [[<U+014C>nin War]].   This armed contest marks the beginning the [[Sengoku period]] of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]], a troubled period of constant military clashes which would last over a century. A number of developments affect the unfolding <U+014C>nin War's battles:
* 1468 <U+2013> Yoshimi joins [[Yamana S<U+014D>zen]].<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1469 <U+2013> Yoshihisa appointed heir to shogunate.<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1471 <U+2013> [[Asakura Takakage]] appointed ''shugo'' of [[Echizen province]].<ref name="ackroyd331"/>
* 1473 <U+2013> [[Yamana S<U+014D>zen]] and [[Hosokawa Katsumoto]] both die.<ref name="ackroyd331"/>

In the midst of on-going hostilities, Yoshimasa retired in 1473.  He relinquished the position of ''Seii Taishogun'' to his young son who became the ninth shogun [[Ashikaga Yoshihisa]]; but effectively, Yoshimasa continued to hold the reins of power. With the leaders of the two warring factions dead and with the ostensible succession dispute resolved, the rationale for continuing to fight faded away.  The exhausted armies dissolved and by 1477 open warfare ended.
* 1477 <U+2013> The <U+014C>nin War is considered at an end.<ref name="ackroyd331"/>

== Yoshimasa's heirs ==
When Yoshimasa declared that Yoshihisa would be the next shogun after he stepped down from that responsibility, he anticipated that his son would out-live him. When Shogun Yoshihisa died prematurely, Yoshimasa reassumed the power and responsibility he had wanted to lay aside. Shogun Yoshimasa adopted the son of his brother, Yoshimi. In 1489, shogun [[Ashikaga Yoshitane|Yoshitane]] was installed; and Yoshimasa retired again.

Before Yoshimasa died in 1490, he again adopted a nephew as heir, this time the son of his brother, Masatomo.  Although Yoshitane did outlive Yoshimasa, his shogunate would prove short-lived. Yoshitane died in 1493.<ref name="a298">Ackroyd, p. 298.</ref>

Shogun Yoshimasa was succeeded by shogun Yoshihisa (Yoshimasa's natural son), then by Shogun Yoshitane (Yoshimasa's first adopted son), and then by shogun Yoshizumi (Yoshimasa's second adopted son). Yoshizumi's progeny would directly succeed him as head of the shogunate. In the future, power struggles from outside the clan would also lead to a brief period in which the great-grandson of Yoshitane would be installed as a puppet leader of the Ashikaga shogunate.<ref name="a298" />

==Higashiyama culture==
{{main|Higashiyama Culture}}

During Yoshimasa's reign Japan saw the growth of the [[Higashiyama Bunka|Higashiyama Culture]] (''Higashiyama bunka''),<ref>[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/h/higashiyamabunka.htm "Higashiyama Bunka" (<U+6771><U+5C71><U+6587><U+5316>),] [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/   JAANUS: Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System.]</ref> famous for [[Japanese tea ceremony]] (''Sado''), Japanese flower arranging (''Kado'' or ''[[Ikebana]]''), ''[[Noh]]'' [[Japanese drama]], and [[Indian ink]] painting.  Higashiyama culture was greatly influenced by [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]] and saw the rise of Japanese aesthetics like ''[[Wabi-sabi]]'' and the harmonization of imperial court (''Kuge'') and [[samurai]] (''Bushi'') culture.

In the history of this ''Higashiyama bunka'' period, a few specific dates are noteworthy:
* '''1459''' (''Ch<U+014D>roku 3''): Shogun Yoshimasa provided a new ''[[mikoshi]]'' and a complete set of robes and other accouterments for this festival on the occasion of repairs to the [[Atsuta Shrine]] in the 1457<U+2013>1459 (''Ch<U+014D>roku 1<U+2013>3'').<ref name="shrines452">Ponsonby-Fane. (1962). ''Studies in Shinto and Shrines,'' p.  452.</ref>
* '''1460''' (''Ch<U+014D>roku 3''): Yoshimasa initiated planning for construction of a retirement villa and gardens as early as 1460;<ref>[http://www.yamasa.org/index.html  Yamasa:] [http://www.yamasa.org/japan/english/destinations/kyoto/ginkakuji.html  Gikaku-ji.]</ref> and after his death, this property would become a Buddhist temple called Jisho-ji (also known as [[Ginkaku-ji]] or the "Silver Pavilion").<ref>[http://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/kp/topics/eng/2008jan/01-23.html  "Protecting Ginkaku-ji, the Beauty of Wabi-sabi; Reluctance to Black Lacquering the Outer Wall,"] ''Kyoto Shimbun.'' January 23, 2008.</ref>
* '''February 21, 1482''' (''Bummei 14 , 4th day of the 2nd month'')<!-- NengoCalc <U+6587><U+660E><U+5341><U+56DB><U+5E74><U+4E8C><U+6708><U+56DB><U+65E5> -->: Construction of the "Silver Pavilion" is commenced.<ref>Keene, Donald. (2003). {{Google books|xtPsa5zI8jcC|''Yoshimasa and the Silver Pavillion,'' p.  87.|page=87}}</ref>
* '''January 27, 1490''' (''Entoku 2, 7th day of the 1st month'')<!-- NengoCalc <U+5EF6><U+5FB3><U+4E8C><U+5E74><U+4E00><U+6708><U+4E03><U+65E5> -->:  The former-Shogun Yoshimasa died at age 56 in his ''Higashiyama-dono'' estate,<ref>Titsingh, {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|p. 361.|page=361}}</ref> which marks the beginning of the end of ''Higashiyama bunka.''
