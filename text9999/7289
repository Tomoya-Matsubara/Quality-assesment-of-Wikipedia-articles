'''Turkish Army''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''T<U+00FC>rk Kara Kuvvetleri'') is a branch of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]. Turkish Army is one of the largest standing armies in the world and the second largest army of [[NATO]]. The total number of troops is around 750,000. Turkish Army can deploy an Army Corps of 100,000 men to conduct [[joint warfare|joint operations]] at short notice. The [[Army]] can conduct air assault operations with a lift capability of up to 7 battalions at a time, day and night.

[[Chief of the Turkish General Staff]]: General [[Ya<U+015F>ar B<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>kan<U+0131>t]]

Commander of the Army: General [[<U+0130>lker Ba<U+015F>bu<U+011F>]]

==History==

The first systematic Turkish Army was formed in 209 BC. The history of the Turks whose political order developed in line with their military order dates back approximately 2,215 years. This long history, which started in [[Central Asia]], spread to all the major continents of the [[Old World]] as a result of great migrations. Turks of the [[Oghuz]] (''O<U+011F>uz in Turkish'') branch who established the Great [[Hun]] Empire in [[Eurasia]] and [[Gokturk|G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rk]] Empire in the East also established the [[Seljuk Empire]] in the West, which played an important role in the encounter between the Turks and the European nations starting with the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (Malazgirt) in [[1071]] and the [[First Crusade]] in [[1096]].

Entering [[Anatolia]] with the historic victory at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] in [[1071]], the Turks established the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] which was later divided among many Turkish principalities (called [[Beylik]]) from which the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Beylik emerged as the most powerful one. Through military conquests, strategic alliances and royal marriages, the Ottoman Beylik united all the other Turkish Beyliks (principalities) of [[Anatolia]] under a single flag and became known as the [[Ottoman Empire]], eventually spreading its power and expanding its territory with military conquests across [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. At present, 39 nation-states (40 including [[TRNC]]) have emerged from the former territories of the [[Turkish Empire]].

Over centuries, the [[Flag of turkey|Turkish flag]] flew from one end of the Empire to the other: from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (and in 1553 the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of North Africa beyond Gibraltar) in the west to the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Persian Gulf]] in the east, from the edge of [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]] and the hinterland beyond [[Ukraine]] in the north to [[Sudan]] and [[Yemen]] in the south. The Turks established an absolute sovereignty over the [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[Red Sea]], [[Persian Gulf]] and parts of the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Turkish Navy]] set sail and appeared in distant countries, from the [[British Isles]], [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Iceland]] in the West to [[India]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] in the East.

Having eventually lost its power as a result of geopolitical and geostrategic circumstances, the [[Ottoman Empire]], during its final and weakest years, took part in [[World War I]], which nevertheless provided new and legendary pages in the history of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]. The [[Battle of Gallipoli]] and the [[Siege of Kut]] were only some of the important historic victories of the Turks in [[World War I]], who had the upper hand in the first two years between [[1914]] and [[1916]] despite the lack of money and adequate equipment. The tide eventually turned against the Turks with the [[Arab Revolt]] in [[1916]], as the Turks not only had to fight against the Allies but also against the local population in their Middle Eastern territories as well. 

The Ottoman Empire eventually surrendered its Middle Eastern territories with the [[Armistice of Mudros]] on [[October 30]], [[1918]] (including [[Yemen]] and [[Azerbaijan]] which were still under Turkish control at the end of the war). The victors of [[World War I]] sent their warships to [[Turkey]] and set foot on Turkish ports, while the Ottoman Army was officially dissolved.

The demise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], however, gave way to the rise of Turkish nationalism, and following the victory at the [[Turkish War of Independence]], to the birth of the [[Republic of Turkey]]. The military was then reformed by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]], Turkish national hero and founder of the Republic. 

While the flames of [[World War II]] were approaching the Turkish borders, the Turkish Army was on duty. Turkey remained neutral until the final stages of [[World War II]] and tried to maintain an equal distance between both the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. However, at the [[Second Cairo Conference]] in [[1943]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[Churchill]] and [[Ismet In<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>|In<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]] reached an agreement on issues regarding Turkey's possible contribution to the Allies, and upon Roosevelt's request (to the annoyance of Churchill who wanted to use the strength of the Turkish Army and Air Force on the side of the Allies) it was decided that Turkey should maintain her neutrality and thus block the Axis from reaching the strategic oil reserves of the Middle East. Even though Turkey never had to fight against the Axis, the Turkish Armed Forces were fully mobilized and remained on alert throughout the war, ready to confront a possible invasion after the Axis had captured Greece and Bulgaria.

Closely monitoring the developments taking place all over the globe after World War II, Turkish forces took part in the Korean War, suffering 731 casualties in the course of that conflict.

Turkey became a member of [[NATO]] on [[February 18]], [[1952]], and the [[Republic of Turkey]] initiated a comprehensive modernization program for its Armed Forces. The [[Turkish Armed Forces]], whose power of deterrence continuously increased, proved its capabilities once more during [[Operation Atilla]] to free the [[Turkish Cypriots]] from the violence of the [[Greek Cypriot]] [[EOKA]] militants who, after expelling the [[United Kingdom|British]] forces from [[Cyprus]] in [[1960]], decided that it was time to expel the Turkish Cypriots as well, with the aim of forging a union, or [[Enosis]] as they called it, with [[Greece]]. 

Towards the end of the 1980s, a restructuring and modernization process has been initiated by the [[Turkish Armed Forces]], which still continues today. The final goal of [[Turkey]] is to produce indigenous military equipment and to become increasingly self-sufficient in terms of military technologies. 

[[Turkey]] is located in a vitally important and challenging region with various political regimes, religions, economic systems and military powers. Due to its dominant position surrounded by the Black, Aegean and the Mediterranean Seas, as well as the [[Balkans]] and the [[Middle East]], it is a focal point of strategic lines beginning from Gibraltar, where land and sea lines of communication intersect, to the Middle East and [[Central Asia]] on three continents. Turkey, which controls the Turkish Straits, is also well positioned to control the Suez Canal and consequently the maritime traffic in the region.

Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia are the shortest land and air transport routes to the vast energy resources in the Middle East. Radical changes are taking place in the region around Turkey, and these changes bring great challenges with them. While the uncertainties in the content and duration of these changes continue, Turkey stands firm as an element of stability in the region.

In this environment of uncertainty, the threat to the security of Turkey is no longer comprised solely of the regional military powers, but also of political, economic and social instabilities, border disputes, struggles of power and terrorism. The conditions of the region where Turkey is located pose a clear threat to the security of the country. 

In addition to the regional crises, the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] must -based on political decisions- also be prepared to respond to the crises which pose a threat to global peace. 

Strictly adhering to [[Atat<U+00FC>rk]]<U+2019>s principle, ''"Peace at Home, Peace in the World"'', the Armed Forces of the Republic of Turkey will never pursue any aggressive intentions, but will take action when the independence of the Turkish state and the security and honour of the Turkish nation will be attacked; in parallel with the common ideals of international organizations and treaties of which Turkey is a member and signatory.

As a member of the [[NATO]] Alliance, the Republic of Turkey has ensured an increased sense of security to her allies and has contributed to the protection of global peace as well. Turkey continues to cooperate with NATO countries in the field of defense and fully supports the initiatives towards global disarmament and arms control. In this context, Turkey is committed to a global disarmament plan that is realized under an effective control mechanism, which does not adversely affect the security of any nation.

In an environment full of hot conflicts, Turkey, having great importance as the last link within the [[NATO]] defense chain, must have a powerful national defense capability and a strong Army that's ready to effectively react against potential dangers.

The main elements of the Turkish Defense Doctrine are the determination for national defense, NATO solidarity and loyalty to the Turkish Armed Forces.

The Armed Forces of the Republic of Turkey comprises the Army, Navy and Air Force which are subordinate to the Turkish General Staff. The General Command of Gendarmerie and the Coast Guard Command, which operate as part of the internal security forces in peacetime, are subordinate to the Land and Naval Forces Commands, respectively, in wartime.

The Chief of General Staff is the Commander of the Armed Forces. In wartime, he acts as the Commander in Chief on behalf of the President. Commanding the Armed Forces and establishing the policies and programs related with the preparation for combat of personnel, intelligence, operations, organization, training and logistic services are the responsibilities of the Turkish General Staff. Furthermore, the Turkish General Staff coordinates the military relations of the Turkish Armed Forces with NATO member states and other friendly nations.
