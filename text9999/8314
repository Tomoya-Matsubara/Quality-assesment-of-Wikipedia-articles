The predecessors of the modern [[Nokia]] corporate entity includes the Nokia Aktiebolag (Nokia Company) and Suomen Gummitehdas Oy ([[Nokian Footwear|Finnish Rubber Works Ltd]]).<ref name="First century">{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/nokias-first-century|title=Nokia <U+2013> Nokia's first century <U+2013> Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref>  In 1865, mining engineer [[Fredrik Idestam]] established a groundwood pulp mill on the banks of the [[Tammerkoski]] rapids in the town of [[Tampere]], in southwestern Finland.<ref name="The birth of Nokia">{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/nokias-first-century/the-birth-of-nokia|title=Nokia <U+2013> The birth of Nokia <U+2013> Nokia's first century <U+2013> Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref> In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia, Finland, fifteen kilometres (nine miles) west of Tampere by the Nokianvirta river, which had better resources for hydroelectric production.  In 1871, Idestam, with the help of his close friend statesman [[Leo Mechelin]], renamed and transformed his mills into a share company, thereby founding the Nokia Company.<ref name="Idestam">{{cite web|url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=4296|title=Idestam, Fredrik (1838-1916)|last=Helen|first=Tapio|publisher=Biographical Centre of the Finnish Literature Society|accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref> 

Suomen Gummitehdas Oy was founded in 1898.  Car tyre production was started by the Suomen Gummitehdas Oy in 1932.

Nokian (which were earlier branded as Nokia tyres; ''Nokian'' is the [[Genitive case|genitive]]) was split from the then conglomerate [[Nokia]] (which later became the world's largest [[mobile phone]] vendor) when Nokia Corporation established Nokian Tyres Limited in 1988 as a joint venture company.  Nokian Tyres PLC shares were floated on the Helsinki Stock Exchange (OMX Helsinki) in 1995.
