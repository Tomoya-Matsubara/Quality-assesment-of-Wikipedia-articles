'''Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts''' is a former [[estate (house)|estate]] near [[Katonah, New York|Katonah]], [[New York]] [[United States]], that has since become a venue for classical music performances and an art museum. Both are legacies of the house's  original owners, Walter and [[Lucie Bigelow Rosen|Lucie Rosen]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Glinsky | first = Albert | title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage | location = Urbana, Illinois | publisher = University of Illinois Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-252-02582-2 | pages=288 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=6DHlQJcMpBQC&printsec=frontcover |ref=Glinsky}}</ref> The [[Caramoor International Music Festival]] is held there every summer. It also runs educational programs, and can be rented for events such as weddings.
 
The Rosens built the estate gradually during the 1930s, its main house an imitation Italian villa. Many pieces of the buildings were imported from various European countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/the-view-from-katonah-for-costume-fanciers-regal-fantasy-fashions.html|title=The View From: Katonah; For Costume Fanciers, Regal Fantasy Fashions|last=Ames|first=Lynne|date=October 19, 1997|work=New York Times|accessdate=12 July 2010}}</ref> The informal musical performances they hosted evolved into the beginning of Caramoor's current offerings in 1945, and their collection of [[Renaissance art|Renaissance-era]] and [[Chinese art|Chinese]] artworks, some rare, is on display throughout the estate. Lucie Rosen later donated it to the private organization that runs it today. In 2001 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==Buildings and grounds==

Caramoor is an {{convert|81|acre|ha|adj=on}} parcel on Girdle Ridge Road just east of the [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]] [[state highway]] east of the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] of [[Katonah, New York|Katonah]] in the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|Town]] of [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]]. The area is primarily residential, with houses on similarly large lots amidst wooded, gently rolling terrain. The [[John Jay Homestead State Historic Site]], a [[National Historic Landmark]], is a short distance to the northwest along Route 22.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

There are 12 total [[contributing property|contributing resources]] on the estate<U+2014>seven buildings, one site, and four structures. An additional building, the Venetian Theater, was built after the estate became the performing arts center. It is too modern to be considered contributing.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

===Rosen House===

A curving driveway leads past modest stone entrance posts and through an electric entrance gate at a high [[Agricultural fencing#Deer fence|deer fence]] through Caramoor's wooded perimeter into a central cleared area, dominated by the Rosen House on a slight rise to the south. A branch leads to other outbuildings.

The Rosen House is a [[stucco]] building rising two stories a poured concrete [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] with a red [[tile]]d roof in a variety of asymmetrical [[gable]] and [[hip roof|hip]] configurations and irregular [[Window|fenestration]]. A high curved wall at the southwest corner connects to the servants' quarters in that direction. A [[terrace (building)|terrace]] with stone [[balustrade]] extends from the dining room on the east; another terrace is located off the [[master bedroom]] on the southeast. The [[property caretaker|caretaker]]'s apartment, its small yard surrounded by a high wooden fence, is located at the southwest corner. A south wing, built after the Rosens' deaths to house rooms from their apartment in New York is non-contributing.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

At the center is the Spanish Courtyard, surrounded by a [[cloister]] with 12th-century [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] columns,<ref name="Center garden tours page">{{cite web|title=Garden Tours|url=http://www.caramoor.org/museumgardens/gardentours|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> reached by a large stone arched entryway in the center of the south wall. The cloister, a one-story colonnaded open walkway, to allow the courtyard's use as the primary entrance to the house. In the center is a large fountain; a clock is on the second story near the main gate.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> When used for musical performances during the festival, it seats 550.<ref name="Center Rosen House page">{{cite web|title=Rosen House|url=http://www.caramoor.org/museumgardens/rosenhouse|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref>

Rooms are mostly entered from the courtyard or narrow hallways along the exterior walls. Most are finished in the style of the house, with stucco walls and [[Coving (interior design)|coved]] ceilings. Much of the furniture and decoration, sometimes comprising entire rooms, was brought by the Rosens from England, France, Italy and Spain. The second floor, less extensively decorated and primarily bedroom space, is also mostly original. The basement, under the kitchen wing, has storage space and a garage.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Among the rooms with notable furnishings and decor are the [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundian]] Library. It has a vaulted blue ceiling decorated with 13 Biblical scenes, and 65 other paintings on the doors and walls. The Cabinet Room has [[lacquer]]ed panels originally created for the Palazzo Riccasoli in [[Turin]] during the 18th century.<ref name="Collection page">{{cite web|title=The Rosens' Collection|url=http://www.caramoor.org/museumgardens/rosenhouse/rosenscollection|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref>

Chinese wallpaper made for the European market in the 18th century decorates the dining room, complemented by one of the only two eight-fold Chinese [[jade]] [[folding screen]]s in the world, a [[Qing Dynasty]] work depicting the [[Taoism|Taoist]] Hills of Immortality in 40 panels with a [[gilded]] [[teak]] frame. Around the table are red lacquered chairs made by an English cabinetmaker for a Spanish castle. More Chinese wallpaper is found in the Reception Room, with furniture from a [[Venice|Venetian]] dress shop. In the master bedroom is a gilded bed that once belonged to Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, later [[Pope Urban VIII]].<ref name="Collection page" />

The largest room, the Music Room, is located at the north end. It is {{convert|40|by|80|ft|m}} with a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} ceiling. Originally the living room, the furniture has been moved to the west side and removable seating installed on movable risers. A large stage is located at the west end.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> It seats 220 and is used for music year-round.<ref name="Center Rosen House page" /> Its art includes a 16th-century [[Florence|Florentine]] [[cassone|cassapanca]], an extensive collection of [[Urbino majolica]], a 13th-century head of [[Guan Yin]], a [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] painting and tin-enameled [[terra cotta]] reliefs from the studio of [[Andrea della Robbia]].<ref name="Collection page" />

===Outbuildings and gardens===

Attached to the Rosen House via a connecting wall is the servants' quarters. Architecturally similar, it is a two-story building with its own entrance to the courtyard. It now serves as the Caramoor Center's offices.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The second-largest building on the property is the Venetian Theater, along the main entrance drive. It was added in the late 1950s expressly as an additional music venue by enclosing a brick stage already in the garden with a colonnade. A large tent roof is in place to shelter the audience, and a restroom wing similar to the Rosen House projects from the west end.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> It seats 1,750, and is the principal venue for musical performances.<ref name="Center Rosen House page" />

Near it is the Sunken Garden, a holdover from the estate owner who preceded the Rosens. It was planted around 1912, making it the oldest feature of the estate native to it. It is enclosed by stucco walls on three sides, with stairs and intersecting walkways leading to its flower beds. The large planted "Medieval Mount" at the rear has built-in concrete benches.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="Center garden tours page" />

The Venetian Circle on the east of the garden is framed by a pair of 17th-century Swiss gates. They are topped with [[Pegasus]] heads sculpted by [[Malvina Hoffman]]. Two paths lead to and through other gardens. From the Juliet Gate, manufactured in 17th-century Italy, the Cedar Walk leads {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} path through the high [[Eastern red cedar|eastern]] and [[Western red cedar|western cedars]] of the Woodland Garden to the  Italian Pavilion, formerly the viewing area for a nearby [[tennis court]], now bricked over. The Butterfly Garden there, based on a [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] design, features plants that support all stages of [[butterfly]] development. Nearby is the Cutting Garden, just outside the greenhouse and cottage, where Caramoor's [[horticulture|horticultural]] staff cultivates cut flowers for planting. A longer wooded path leads through the Theater Garden's tall trees to a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] urn.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="Center garden tours page" />

A former [[dovecote]], moved from the Spanish Courtyard to a location south of the house,<ref name="NRHP nom" /> has been converted into a fountain. It now serves as the center of the Sense Circle, designed to be enjoyed by the visually impaired. The fountain makes pleasant sounds, and the plants around it appeal to the other three senses, with some even being edible.<ref name="Center garden tours page" />

Other outbuildings around the property include a stable, two cottages, accompanying garages and a storage shed. All are contributing, dating to the 1930s, and are architecturally similar to the Rosen House. The landscaping is included in the Register listing as well.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

==History==

A native of [[Berlin]], Walter Rosen emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1885, at the age of 10. He was well-educated, developing an early interest in music and art, and graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] three years after entering it at a young age. Three years later, he became one of the founding partners of the law firm of Underwood, Van Vorst, Rosen and Hoyt. After another three years, in 1901, he left to join a client, the [[Ladenburg Thalmann]] bank.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

He remained there for the rest of his life. In 1914 he married Lucie Bigelow Dodge, a woman who had grown up in an affluent New Jersey family and shared his passion for music and art. On vacations and business trips to Europe, they collected many of the artworks that are now at Caramoor.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="Center Rosen House page" />

They bought the property in 1928. John Hoyt, one of Walter Rosen's former law partners, knew they were looking for a country retreat and told them about his mother's estate, named Caramoor as a contraction of her name, Caroline Moore Hoyt. The Rosens visited and were greatly taken by the Sunken Garden and its cedars, meant to imitate the [[cypress]]es of Italy.<ref name="Center history page">{{cite web|title=History of Caramoor|url=http://www.caramoor.org/about/policies/history|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref>

Originally, the Rosens intended to tear down all but the garden and build a Florentine-style palazzo.<ref name="2001 NYT story">{{cite news|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|title=How the Rosens Of Caramoor Built Their Collection|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/29/arts/antiques-how-the-rosens-of-caramoor-built-their-collection.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 29, 2001|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref> The [[Great Depression|Depression]] forced them to reconsider those plans, and instead they slowly remodeled the existing farm buildings on the site into the current estate, which at one point was {{convert|117|acre|ha}}. By 1939 that work was complete. Architect Christian Rosborg is credited with the design, closely supervised by the Rosens, whose townhouse on Manhattan's East Side had been redone in a [[French Renaissance]] style before they moved in.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="Center Rosen House page" />

In 1940 they began hosting musical performances for their friends in the Music Room. Four years later, when their only son Walter died in [[World War II]] while serving in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], they decided to dedicate the remainder of their own lives to preserving Caramoor's musical legacy. They established the Center in 1946 and began hosting performances open to the public.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="Center Rosen House page" />

Seven years after Walter Rosen died in 1951, the performances had become so popular it became necessary to add the third venue, the Venetian Theater, near the Sunken Garden the Rosens had preserved from the prior estate. The house was opened to public tours in 1970, two years after Lucie Rosen died. Architect Mott Schmidt designed a new wing in 1974 to house rooms from the Rosens' New York City apartment and expand the art collection on display.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="Center Rosen House page" />

The tent roof and floor were added to the Venetian Theater later to allow its use in inclement weather. The restroom wing was added later. The Sense Circle was created after the [[dovecote]] was moved to its following pigeon problems in the late 1980s. There have been few significant changes to the buildings and gardens other than those.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

==Programs==

Caramoor's offerings are primarily classical (the [[Orchestra of St. Luke's]] has been in residence there since 1979<ref name="St. Luke's">{{cite web|title=St Lukes Orchestra|url=http://www.caramoor.org/festival/orchestraofstlukes|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref> and opera. During the [[Caramoor International Music Festival]], on Thursdays through Sundays in July, jazz, [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and popular artists have performed as well.<ref name="Festival program">{{cite web|title=2010 Festival PDF|url=http://www.caramoor.org/pdf/Festival_Listings.pdf|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref> Concerts continue year-round in the Indoor Series, presented in the Music Room.<ref name="Indoor Series">{{cite web|title=Rosen House Music Room|url=http://www.caramoor.org/festival/indoors|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref> In 2005 the festival staged [[Joseph Schillinger]]'s "First Airphonic Suite", with [[Lydia Kavina]], great-niece of [[theremin]] inventor [[Leon Theremin]], as the soloist on that instrument<ref name="2005 theremin NYT story">{{cite news|last=Beckerman|first=Michael|title=Electronica From the 1920's, Ready for Sampling|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/11/arts/music/11ther.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 11, 2005|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref> (Lucie Rosen, an enthusiast of the theremin, was an accomplished performer on it herself, and she and her husband were for a time Theremin's [[patron]]s. The center's collection includes some of her instruments, including a highly advanced one Theremin gave her shortly before leaving the U.S. in 1938).<ref name="Theremin page">{{cite web|title=Lucie's Theremin|url=http://www.caramoor.org/museumgardens/lucies-theremin|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref>

The center also has extensive educational programs. Since 1986, an average of 5,000 students have in some way been part of those. They range from programs for schoolchildren that, in addition to music, introduce them to Renaissance culture and Chinese art.<ref name="Schoolchildren programs">{{cite web|title=Programs for School Children|url=http://www.caramoor.org/education/programsschool|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref> Programs for musicians include [[mentor]]ing from distinguished artists and the Ernst Stiefel String-Quartet-in-Residence.<ref name="Young artist programs">{{cite web|title=Arts-in-Education and Mentoring|url=http://www.caramoor.org/education|publisher=Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts|date=2010|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref>
