The '''Jack Russell Terrier''' is a small [[terrier]] that has its origins in [[fox hunting]]. It is principally white-bodied smooth, rough or broken<U+2013>coated which is commonly confused with the [[Parson Russell Terrier]] (the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) and affiliate variant) and the [[Russell Terrier]] (a shorter legged, stockier variety) with the term "Jack Russell" commonly misapplied to other small white terriers. The Jack Russell Terrier is a broad type, with a size range of {{convert|10|-|15|in|cm}}, the Parson Russell is limited only to a middle range with a standard size of {{convert|12|-|14|in|cm}}, while the Russell Terrier is smaller at {{convert|8|-|12|in|cm}}, however each breed has different physical proportions according to the standards of their breed clubs.

The working Jack Russell Terrier is a unique terrier which has been preserved in working ability as well as appearance much as it existed over 200 years ago. Originating from the dogs bred and used by [[Jack Russell (dog breeder)|Reverend John Russell]] in the early 19th century from the [[English White Terrier]], they have similar origins to the modern [[Fox Terrier]]. The Jack Russell is a high energy breed which relies on a high level of exercise and stimulation, and does not have a great deal of serious health complaints. It has gone through several changes over the centuries, with changes in use and the formation of different [[conformation show]] standards by different kennel clubs. Recognition for the breed by kennel clubs has been opposed by the breed's parent societies &ndash; something which resulted in the creation and recognition of the Parson Russell Terrier. Jack Russells have appeared multiple times in film, television and print with several historical dogs of note.

[[image:Old Jock.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old Jock, a famous Fox Terrier born in 1859.]]

An important attribute in this dog was a tempered aggressiveness that would provide the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting.<ref name="bu12">[[#burns2006|Burns (2006)]]: p. 12</ref> Russell was said to have prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood.<ref name="prtjrthist"/> This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for these qualities and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today are descended from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs on more than one occasion because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.<ref name="bu237">[[#burns2006|Burns (2006)]]: p. 237</ref>

The Fox Terrier and Jack Russell Terrier type dogs of today are all descended from dogs of that period, although documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 have not been found. Several records remain of documented breeding by Reverend John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. The Fox Terrier Club was formed in 1875 with Russell as one of the founder members; its breed standard was aspiration and not a description of how the breed appeared then. By the start of the 20th century the Fox Terrier had altered more towards the modern breed, but in some parts of the country the old style of John Russell's terriers remained and it is from those dogs that the modern Jack Russell type descends.<ref name="parsonclubhist"/>

Many breeds can claim heritage to the early Fox Terrier of this period, including the [[Brazilian Terrier]], [[Japanese Terrier]], [[Miniature Fox Terrier]], [[Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz]], [[Rat Terrier]] and [[Tenterfield Terrier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jack-russell-terrier.co.uk/breed/types_of_terriers.html|title=Different Types of Terrier: Smooth Fox Terrier|publisher=JackRussell.co.uk|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>

===After John Russell===
[[image:Carlisle Tack.jpg|thumb|right|Carlisle Tack, Fox Terrier born in 1884, who was owned by Parson John Russell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumbreckjackrussells.com/OriginHistory.html|title=Origin & History|publisher=Cumbreck Jack Russells|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>]]
Following Russell's death, the only people who made serious efforts to continue those strains were a Mr. East, of [[Chislehurst]] and Mr. Archer, of [[Cornwall]]. Mr. East at one point had several couples, all of which were descended from one of John Russell's dogs. The type aimed for were not as big as the show [[Fox Terrier]], and were usually less than {{convert|15|lb|kg}}.<ref name="jrgbhist" />

Arthur Blake Heinemann created the first breed standard, and in 1894 he found the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, whose aims were to promote [[badger]] digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of [[Oare]], and they were likely descended from John Russell's original dogs, as the Parson would have probably hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club and is likely to have provided at least some of their original terriers.<ref name="parsonclubhist" /> By the turn of the 20th century Parson John Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.<ref name="remfox">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Rawdon B.|title=A History and Description, with Reminiscences, of the Fox Terrier|publisher=Horace Cox, London|date=1902||page=153|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Zvwd4L445fAC&pg=PP12&lpg=PP12&dq=carlisle+tack&source=bl&ots=6PN6p48AL-&sig=QAV5cXOwFNBQspthP5Zo9he1BSM&hl=en&ei=9PiwS4CyHcrJ4gbGk8nCDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=russell&f=false|accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref>

The club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club.<ref name="parsonclubhist"/> Badger digging required a different type of dog to fox hunting, and it is likely that [[Bull Terrier]] stock was introduced to strengthen the breed, which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of Jack Russell Terrier that started to appear around this period. At the same time that a split was appearing between show and working Fox Terriers, a further split was occurring between two different types of white terrier, both carrying Jack Russell's name.<ref name="jrgbhist" /> Heinemann was invited to judge classes for [[working terrier]]s at [[Crufts]] with an aim to bring working terriers back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs. These classes were continued for several years by various judges, but [[Charles Cruft]] dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed. Following Heinemann's death in 1930, the kennel and leadership of the club passed to Annie Harris, but the club itself folded shortly before [[World War II]].<ref name="jrgbhist" /><ref name="parsonclubhist" />

===Post World War II===
[[image:Jack Russell in Field.jpg|thumb|right|The modern working Jack Russell Terrier.]]
Following [[World War II]], the requirement for hunting dogs drastically declined, and with it the numbers of Jack Russell Terriers. The dogs were increasingly used as family and companion dogs. Further cross breeding occurred, with [[Welsh Corgi]]s, [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]s and other smaller breeds of Terrier. The offspring of these crosses became known as Puddin' Dogs, Shortie Jacks or [[Russell Terrier]]s.<ref name="sarah"/>

The [[Jack Russell Terrier Club of America]] was formed in 1976 by Mrs. Alicia Crawford, one of the first Jack Russell Terrier breeders in the United States. Size ranges for dogs were kept broad, with the ability of working dogs awarded higher than those in [[conformation show]]s. An open registry was maintained with restricted line breeding. Registration for the club is made at adulthood for Jack Russells rather than at birth, to ensure the breed's qualities remain given the open registry.<ref name="bu58">[[#burns2006|Burns (2006)]]: p. 58</ref>

[[Image:workingterrier1.jpg|thumb|left|A working Jack Russell Terrier exits a den pipe.]]

Several breed clubs appeared in the United Kingdom during the 70s to promote the breed, including the Jack Russell Terrier Club of Great Britain (JRTCGB) and the South East Jack Russell Terrier Club (SEJRTC). The JRTCGB promoted the range of sizes that remain in its standards today, whereas the SEJRTC set a minimum height for dogs at {{convert|13|in|cm}}. While the JRTCGB sought to ensure that the breed's working ability remained through non-recognition with breed registries, the SEJRTC activity sought recognition with the UK [[Kennel Club]].<ref name="co9">[[#coile|Coile(2000)]]: p. 9</ref> In 1983 the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club of Great Britain (PJRTCGB) was resurrected to seek Kennel Club recognition for the breed. Although the application was initially rejected, a new standard was created for the PJRTCGB based on the standard of the SEJRTC, and under that standard the breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1990 as the Parson Jack Russell Terrier.<ref name="co10">[[#coile|Coile(2000)]]: p. 10</ref> Jack was dropped from the official name in 1999, and the recognised name of the breed became the [[Parson Russell Terrier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jack-parsonrussell.com/it/parson.html|title=FCI-Standard N<U+00B0>339 / 28. 11. 2003 / GB Parson Russell Terrier|publisher=Montefiore|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, the [[American Kennel Club]] explored the possibility of recognising the Jack Russell Terrier.<ref name="bu60">[[#burns2006|Burns (2006)]]: p. 60</ref> This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as they did not want the breed to lose its essential working characteristics.<ref name="bu59">[[#burns2006|Burns (2006)]]: p. 59</ref> The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association was formed, and petitioned the AKC with the breed's admission granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard and the name of the AKC recognised Jack Russell Terrier was changed to Parson Russell Terrier,<ref name="bu61">[[#burns2006|Burns (2006)]]: p. 61</ref> with the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.<ref name="bu60"/>

The [[Australian National Kennel Council]] (ANKC) and the [[New Zealand Kennel Club]] (NZCK) are the only national kennel association which registers both the Jack Russell Terrier and the Parson Russell Terrier,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzkc.org.nz/br245.html|title=Jack Russell Terrier|publisher=New Zealand Kennel Club|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzkc.org.nz/br261.html|title=Parson Russell Terrier|publisher=New Zealand Kennel Club|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ankc.org.au/Breeds.aspx?gid=2|title=Breeds - Group 2 (Terriers) Page 1|publisher=Australian National Kennel Council|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ankc.org.au/Breed_Details.aspx?bid=66|title=Parson Russell Terrier|date=2 July 2009|publisher=Australian National Kennel Council|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> however the size requirements for the Jack Russell Terrier under both those standards would classify a dog as a Russell Terrier in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jack-russell-terrier.co.uk/breed/parsons_and_jacks.html|title=The differences between Parson Jack Russell Terriers and Jack Russell Terriers|publisher=Jack-Russell-Terrier.co.uk|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> In 2009, there were 1073 Jack Russells registered with the ANKC, compared to 126 for the Parson Russell Terrier.<ref name="austop">{{cite web |url=http://www.ankc.org.au/media/scripts/doc_download.aspx?did=438 |title=ANKC: National Animal Registration Analysis |author= |date= |work=Australian National Kennel Club |publisher= |accessdate=5 April 2010 }}</ref> Other modern breeds are often mistaken for modern Jack Russell Terriers, including their cousin the Parson Russell Terrier,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kannyeparsons.co.uk/kannyehistory.htm|title=About Us|publisher=Kannye Parson Russell Terrier|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> the [[Tenterfield Terrier]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burkesbackyard.com.au/1998/archives/26/roadtests/dog_breeds/tenterfield_terrier|title=Tenterfield Terrier|publisher=Burkes Backyard|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> and the [[Rat Terrier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://terrierlover.com/2007/09/rat-terrier-the-farming-dog/#more-39|title=Roosevelt<U+2019>s Rat Terrier|date=2 September 2007|publisher=TerrierLover.com|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> Several other modern breeds exist that descended from the early Fox Terrier breed, including the [[Brazilian Terrier]], [[Japanese Terrier]], [[Miniature Fox Terrier]], [[Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz]], Rat Terrier and Tenterfield Terrier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jack-russell-terrier.co.uk/breed/types_of_terriers.html|title=Different Types of Terrier|publisher=Jack-Russell-Terrier.co.uk|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>

[[image:JackRussells.jpg|thumb|right|alt="Three mostly white terriers with different markings stand up over a log"|Jack Russell Terriers come in a variety of coat types, and with a range of markings.]]

Due to their working nature, Jack Russell Terriers remain much as they were some 200 years ago.<ref name="co11">[[#coile2000|Coile (2000)]]: p. 11</ref> They are sturdy, tough, and tenacious, measuring between {{convert|10|-|15|in|cm}} at the [[withers]],<ref name="BreedStandard" /> and weigh {{convert|14|-|18|lb|kg}}.<ref name="sarah">{{cite web|url=http://www.sarahsdogs.com/breeds/jack_russell_terrier/|title=Jack Russell Terrier Information|publisher=Sarah's Dogs|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> The body length must be in proportion to the height, and the dog should present a compact, balanced image.

[[image:Jack russell terrier LM.jpg|thumb|left|A broken-coated Jack Russell Terrier.]]

The head should be of moderate width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop at the end of the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark colored, and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head.<ref name="sarah"/> When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.<ref name="sarah"/>

The Jack Russell should always appear balanced and alert.<ref name="BreedStandard"/>  As it is primarily a working terrier, its most important physical characteristic is its chest size, which must not be so large that it prevents the dog from entering and working in burrows.<ref name="sarah"/> The [[red fox]] is the traditional [[quarry]] of the Jack Russell Terrier (JRT), so the working Jack Russell must be small enough to pursue it. Red foxes vary in size, but across the world they average from {{convert|13|-|17|lbs|kg}} in weight and have an average chest size of {{convert|12|-|14|in|cm}} at the widest part.<ref name="Working Dog">{{cite web|url=http://therealjackrussell.com/breed/working.php|title=WORKING DOG|work=www.therealjackrussell.com|publisher=Jack Russell Terrier Club of America|accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref>

===Differences with related breeds===
[[image:05052881 PRT braun rau.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Parson Russell Terrier]] shares a common ancestry with the Jack Russell Terrier.]]

==Temperament==
[[image:JRT with Ball.jpg|thumb|right|A Jack Russell Terrier is a dog with a high level of energy.]]
Jack Russells are first and foremost a [[working terrier]].<ref name="Working Terrier">{{cite web|url=http://www.therealjackrussell.com/breed/index.php | title = The Jack Russell Terrier: A Working Dog|work=www.therealjackrussell.com|publisher=Jack Russell Terrier Club of America|accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> Originally bred to bolt fox from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and grey fox.<ref name="thinking">{{cite web|url=http://www.working-dog.com/needto.htm|title=So You're Thinking About Getting a Jack Russell Terrier|publisher=Working-Dog.com|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to.<ref name="ra80">[[#rainwater2008|Rainwater (2008)]]: p. 80</ref> To accomplish this, the dog must bark and work the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs.<ref name="northamerican"/> It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.<ref name="ra73">[[#rainwater2008|Rainwater (2008)]]: p. 73</ref>

Their high energy and drive make these dogs ideally suited to a number of different dog sports such as [[flyball]] or [[dog agility|agility]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Pavia|first=Audrey|title=What About Jack Russell Terriers: The Joys and Realities of Living with a JRT|publisher=Howell Book House|date=21 November 2003|series=What About?|pages=7|isbn=978-0764540899|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rA2waE0sYQwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=jack+russell&cd=2#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref> Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners,<ref name="thinking"/> as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized.<ref name="northamerican"/> Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation.

==Health==
[[image:JackRussellJump wb.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Trump, 2002 USDAA National/World Agility Champion &ndash; 12" division.]]
The breed has a reputation for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live anywhere from between 14 to 21 years on average given proper care.<ref name="ra65"/> However certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns, and therefore could occur in any line or generation because of [[recessive gene]]s. These issues can include hereditary [[cataract]]s, [[ectopia lentis]], [[congenital deafness]], [[patellar luxation]], [[ataxia]], [[myasthenia gravis]], [[Legg<U+2013>Calv<U+00E9><U+2013>Perthes syndrome]] and [[von Willebrand disease]].<ref name="ra65">[[#rainwater2008|Rainwater (2008)]]: p. 65</ref>

Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell will usually pursue most creatures that it encounters. This includes the [[skunk]], and the breed is prone to skunk toxic shock syndrome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steve|title=The Encyclopedia of North American Sporting Dogs: Written by Sportsmen for Sportsmen|publisher=Willow Creek Press|date=September 2002|pages=229 & 229|chapter=Jack Russell Terrier|isbn=978-1572235014|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d4FnXfnoc-IC&pg=PA229&dq=russell+terrier&lr=&cd=31#v=onepage&q=russell%20terrier&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref> The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the [[red blood cell]]s to explode, which can occasionally lead to fatal [[anemia]] and [[kidney]] failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.<ref name="bu227">[[#burns2006|Burns (2006)]]: p. 227</ref>

===Eye disorders===
Lens luxation, also known as ectopia lentis is the most common hereditary disorder in Jack Russell Terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips to the back of the eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the [[cornea]], damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing [[glaucoma]] which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye, and is not hereditary.<ref name="myjacklens">{{cite web|url=http://myjackrussellterriers.com/jackrussellterrierbreed/lens-luxation-and-glaucoma-in-jack-russell-terriers/|title=Lens Luxation and Glaucoma in Jack Russell Terriers|publisher=myjackrussellterriers.com|accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref> The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the [[Border Collie]], [[Brittany (dog)|Brittany]] and [[Cardigan Welsh Corgi]].<ref name="myjackcommon">{{cite web|url=http://myjackrussellterriers.com/dog-health-issues/dog-health-issues-by-breed/|title=Common Genetic Health Issues Of Purebred Dogs|publisher=myjackrussellterriers.com|accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>

Cataracts can affect any breed of dog, and is the same condition as seen in humans. Here the lens of the eye hardens and is characterized by cloudiness in the eye.<ref name="myjackcommon"/><ref name="dogjreye"/> Cataracts will blur the dog's vision and can lead to permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by [[diabetes in dogs|diabetes]], old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.<ref name="dogjreye">{{cite web|url=http://www.dogjackrussell.com/eye-diseases-of-jack-russell-dogs/|title=Eye Diseases of Jack Russell Dogs|publisher=dogjackrussell.com|accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>

===Musculoskeletal conditions===
[[Patellar luxation]], also known as luxating patella, is a hereditary disorder affecting the knees. It is where the [[kneecap]] slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can have a problem with both rear knees, and complications can include [[arthritis]] or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myjackrussellterriers.com/dog-health-issues/jack-russell-terrier-genetic-health-problems/hind-leg-joint-luxating-patella/|title=Hind Leg Joint Problem - Luxating Patella|publisher=myjackrussellterriers.com|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>

[[Legg<U+2013>Calv<U+00E9><U+2013>Perthes syndrome]], also called Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, is where the ball section of the [[femur]] in the hip joint deteriorates following interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in [[human]]s.<ref name="leggliver">{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/HumanAnatomy/phd/research/perthes/perthpd.html|title=Perthes' Disease of the Hip|last=Dangerfield|first=Peter H.|publisher=The University of Liverpool|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsidepets.com/index.php/pet-care-pages/82-jack-russell-terrier-specific-wellness-program|title=Jack Russell Terrier - Specific Wellness Program|publisher=Hillside Animal Hospital|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> It usually occurs between 6&ndash;12 months of age and has been documented in a variety of other terrier breeds including the [[Border Terrier]], [[Lakeland Terrier]] and [[Wheaten Terrier]].<ref name="leggliver"/>

[[image:His Master's Voice.jpg|thumb|right|''[[His Master's Voice]]'' (1898) by [[Francis Barraud]].]]
[[Nipper]] was a dog born in 1884 who was thought to be a dog of the Jack Russell Terrier type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/440596.stm|title=HMV seeks budding Nipper|date=8 September 1999|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 March 2010}}</ref> He was the inspiration for the painting ''Dog looking at and listening to a Phonograph'', later renamed to ''His Master's Voice''.

On April 29, 2007, a Jack Russell named George saved five children at a carnival in New Zealand from an attack by two [[pit bull]]s. He was reported to have charged at them and held them at bay long enough for the children to get away. Killed by the pit bulls, he was posthumously awarded the [[PDSA Gold Medal]] in 2009, the animal equivalent of the [[George Cross]]. A statue has been erected in [[Manaia]], [[New Zealand]] in his memory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Dog-Bravery-Jack-Russell-George-Awarded-PDSA-Gold-Medal-For-Saving-Children-From-Pit-Bull-Terriers/Article/200902215220504|title=Hero Dog Dies Fighting Pit Bulls|date=11 February 2009|work=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=2 June 2009}}</ref>  A former US Marine also donated to George's owner a [[Purple Heart]] award he had received for service in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411319/1107891|title=Medals for brave jack russell terrier|date=8 May 2007|work=tvnz.co.nz|publisher=[[Television New Zealand]]|accessdate=2 June 2009}}</ref>
