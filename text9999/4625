'''HMS ''St Vincent''''' was the [[lead ship]] of [[St Vincent-class battleship|her class]] of three [[dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her whole career assigned to the [[Home Fleet|Home]] and [[Grand Fleet]]s and often served as a [[flagship]]. Aside from participating in the [[Battle of Jutland]] in May 1916, during which she damaged a German [[battlecruiser]], her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the [[North Sea]]. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] and used as a [[training ship]]. ''St Vincent'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1921.

==Design and description==
[[File:1stGenBritishBBs.tiff|thumb|left|Right elevation and plan of the first generation of British dreadnoughts from the 1912 edition of [[Jane's Fighting Ships]]]]
The design of the ''St Vincent'' class was derived from that of the previous {{sclass-|Bellerophon|battleship|4}}. ''St Vincent'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|536|ft|m|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|84|ft|m|1}},<ref>Burt, pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|m|1}}.<ref name=p5>Preston, p. 125</ref> She displaced {{convert|19700|LT|t|lk=in}} at normal load and {{convert|22800|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. In 1911 her crew numbered 756 officers and enlisted men and 835 in 1915.<ref name="B_76"/>

===Machinery===
''St Vincent'' was powered by 2 sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[direct-drive]] [[steam turbine]]s, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen [[Babcock & Wilcox boiler]]s. The turbines were rated at {{convert|24500|shp|abbr=on}} and intended to reach a maximum speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=on}}. During her [[sea trial]]s on 17 December 1909, the ship reached a top speed of {{convert|21.67|kn}} from {{convert|28218|shp|abbr=on}}. She had a range of {{convert|6900|nmi|lk=in}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>Burt, pp. 76, 80</ref>

===Armament===
The ''St Vincent'' class was equipped with ten [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading]] (BL) [[BL 12 inch Mk XI - XII naval gun|{{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mk XI guns]] guns in five twin [[gun turret]]s, three along the centreline and the remaining two as [[wing turret]]s. The secondary, or anti-[[torpedo boat]] armament, comprised twenty [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VII|BL {{convert|4|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mk VII guns]]. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure. All guns were in single mounts.<ref name="B_76">Burt, p. 76</ref> The ships were also fitted with three [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s, one on each [[broadside]] and the third in the stern.<ref name=p5/>

===Armour===
The ''St Vincent''-class ships had a [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] of [[Krupp cemented armour]] (KC) that was {{convert|10|in|0}} thick between the fore and aftmost [[barbette]]s that reduced to a thickness of {{convert|2|in|0}} before it reached the ships' ends. Above this was a [[strake]] of armour {{convert|8|in|0}} thick. Transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s {{convert|5|to|8|in|0}} inches thick terminated the thickest parts of the waterline and upper armour belts once they reached the outer portions of the endmost barbettes.<ref>Burt, pp. 76, 78; Parkes, p. 503</ref>

The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour {{convert|9|in|0}} thick above the main [[deck (ship)|deck]] that thinned to {{convert|5|in|0}} below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 10 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had {{convert|11|in|0|adj=on}} faces and sides with {{convert|3|in|0}} roofs. The three armoured decks ranged in thicknesses from {{convert|.75|to|3|in}}. The front and sides of the forward [[conning tower]] were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick respectively.<ref>Burt, pp. 76, 78; Parkes, p. 504</ref>

====Alterations====
The guns on the forward turret roof were removed in 1911<U+2013>12 and the upper forward pair of guns in the superstructure were removed in 1913<U+2013>14. In addition, [[gun shield]]s were fitted to all guns in the superstructure and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] structure was enlarged around the base of the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, a [[fire-control director]] was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house four 4-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition a pair of 3-inch [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]] were added.<ref name=b81>Burt, p. 81</ref>

By April 1917, ''St Vincent'' mounted thirteen 4-inch anti-torpedo boat guns as well as single 4-inch and 3-inch AA guns. Approximately {{convert|50|LT|t}} of additional deck armour had been added after the Battle of Jutland and the ship was modified to operate a [[kite balloon]]. In 1918 a high-angle [[rangefinder]] was fitted and the stern torpedo tube was removed before the end of the war.<ref name=b81/>

==Construction and career==
''St Vincent'', named after [[Admiral of the Fleet]] [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 267</ref> was ordered on 26 October 1907.<ref name="B_86">Burt, p. 86</ref> She was [[laid down]] at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Royal Dockyard]] on the same date; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 September 1908 and completed in May 1909. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at <U+00A3>1,579,970<ref name="B_76"/> or <U+00A3>1,754,615.<ref>Parkes, p. 503</ref> She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 May 1910 and assigned as the junior flagship of the 1st Division of the [[Home Fleet]]. She was commanded by [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Douglas Nicholson]] and was present in [[Torbay]] when [[King George V]] visited the fleet in late July. ''St Vincent'' also participated in the [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy#George V|Coronation Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 24 June 1911. On 1 May 1912 the 1st Division was renamed the [[1st Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battle Squadron]]. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead before beginning a lengthy refit late in the year.<ref name="B_86"/>

On 21 April 1914, she was recommissioned and resumed her role as the flagship of the second-in-command of the 2nd Division, 1st Battle Squadron,<ref name="B_86"/> under the command of [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Hugh Evan-Thomas]].<ref>Corbett, p. 438</ref> Between 17 and 20 July, she took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review. On 29 July she sailed to the fleet's war station at [[Scapa Flow]] and began the patrols and training exercises that constituted the greater part of her service after the declaration of war on 4 August. She was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) with the greater part of the fleet at [[Lough Swilly]] while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. King George V inspected all of the personnel of the 2nd Division aboard ''St Vincent'' during his visit to Scapa on 8 July 1915. She became a [[private ship]] in November when she was relieved by {{HMS|Colossus|1910|2}} as flagship.<ref name="B_86"/>

===Battle of Jutland===
{{Main|Battle of Jutland}}
''St Vincent'', under the command of Captain [[William Wordsworth Fisher|
William Fisher]], was assigned to the 5th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron at the Battle of Jutland. Shortly after 14:20,<ref group=Note>The times used in this section are in [[Universal Time|UT]], which is one hour behind [[Central European Time|CET]], which is often used in German works.</ref> Fisher [[semaphore]]d the Grand Fleet's flagship, {{HMS|Iron Duke|1912|2}}, that his ship was monitoring strong radio signals on the frequency used by the German [[High Seas Fleet]] that implied the Germans were nearby. Detection of further signals was transmitted at 14:52.<ref>Burt, p. 86; Gordon, p. 416</ref>

As the Grand Fleet began deploying from columns into [[line of battle]] beginning at 18:15, the 5th Division was near the rear and ''St Vincent'', the twentieth ship from the front, was briefly forced to stop to avoid overrunning ships further forward as the fleet had been forced to slow to {{convert|14|kn}} to allow the battlecruisers to assume their position at the head of the line. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired a few [[salvo]]s from her main guns at the crippled [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Wiesbaden}} from 18:33, although the number of hits made, if any, is unknown. Between 18:40 and 19:00 the ship turned away twice from what were thought to be torpedoes that stopped short of the ship. From 19:10 ''St Vincent'' began firing at what was identified as a German battleship, but proved to be the battlecruiser {{SMS|Moltke}}, hitting her target twice before she disappeared into the mist. The first [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing, capped]] (APC) shell was probably a ricochet and struck the upper hull abreast the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. It wrecked the [[sickbay]] and slightly damaged the surrounding superstructure and hull which caused some minor flooding. One man in the conning tower was wounded by a splinter. The second hit penetrated the rear armor of the [[superfiring]] turret at the rear of the ship, wrecking it and starting a small fire that was easily extinguished by the crew. This was the last time that ''St Vincent'' fired her guns during the battle. The ship fired a total of 90 APC and 8 [[List of British ordnance terms#Common Pointed|Common Pointed, Capped]] twelve-inch shells during the battle.<ref>Campbell, pp. 146, 157, 167, 205, 208, 232<U+2013>34, 349</ref>

Shortly after the battle, she was transferred to the [[4th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|4th Battle Squadron]].<ref name="B_86"/> On 24 April 1918, ''St Vincent'' was under repair at Invergordon when she, and the dreadnought {{HMS|Hercules|1910|2}} were ordered north to reinforce the forces based at Scapa Flow and the [[Orkneys]] when the High Seas Fleet [[sortie]]d north for the last time to intercept a convoy to Norway. She was unable to comply with the order before the Germans turned back after ''Moltke'' suffered engine damage.<ref>Newbolt, pp. 235<U+2013>38</ref> The ship was present at Rosyth when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November. In March 1919, she was reduced to reserve and became a gunnery training ship at Portsmouth. ''St Vincent'' became flagship of the Reserve Fleet in June and was relieved as gunnery training ship in December when she was transferred to Rosyth. There she remained until listed for disposal in March 1921. She was sold to the [[Stanlee Shipbreaking & Salvage Co.]] for scrap on 1 December 1921 and towed to Dover for demolition in March 1922.<ref name="B_86"/>
