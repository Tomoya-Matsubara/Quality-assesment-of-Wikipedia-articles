'''MediaCityUK''' is a {{convert|200|acre|adj=on}} mixed-use property development site on the banks of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in [[City of Salford|Salford]] and [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]], England. The project is being developed by [[The Peel Group|Peel Media]], and its principal tenants are [[Mass media|media]] organisations and the [[University of Salford]]. The land occupied by the development was part of the [[Port of Manchester]] and [[Manchester Docks]].

The [[BBC]] signalled its intention to move jobs to Manchester in 2004, and the Salford Quays site was chosen in 2006. The Peel Group was granted planning permission to develop the site in 2007, and construction of the development, with its own energy generation plant and communications network, began the same year. Based in Quay House, the principal tenant is the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], whose move marks a large-scale [[decentralisation]] from London. [[ITV Studios]] UK and international television production company. [[ITV Granada]] completed the first phase of its move to MediaCityUK in March 2013. The Studios on Broadway houses seven high-definition studios, claimed to be the largest such facility in Europe.

MediaCityUK is to be developed in two phases. The {{convert|36|acre|adj=on}} first phase was completed in 2011, and the second is dependent on its success. [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]], Greater Manchester's light-rail system, was extended to MediaCityUK with the opening of the [[MediaCityUK Metrolink station]] on 20 September 2010 and further extensions are planned. Road access was improved by the construction of Broadway Link Road.

Proposals to relocate 1,800 jobs to Manchester were unveiled by [[BBC Director General]], [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]], in December 2004.

The chosen site was the last undeveloped site at Manchester Docks, an area that had been subject to considerable investment and was emerging as a tourist destination, residential and commercial centre.  The vision of the developers [[Peel Group]], [[Salford City Council]], the Central Salford Urban Regeneration Company and the [[Northwest Regional Development Agency]] was to create a significant new media city capable of competing on a global scale with developments in Copenhagen and Singapore.<ref name="planning guide"/>

The opening [[Swing bridge|swing footbridge]] at Salford Quays links MediaCityUK with Trafford Wharf on the southern bank of the ship canal. It was designed by Wilkinson Eyre in association with [[Gifford (company)|Gifford]]. The bridge's main span is {{convert|213|ft}} when open and provides a {{convert|157|ft|adj=on}} wide navigation channel accommodating ships' superstructures up to {{convert|66|ft}} in height. The developers specified it to be <U+201C>a unique and memorable landmark<U+201D>. Its visibility is created by a curved bridge deck with an offset pivot mast and array of supporting cables in a fan or sail shape.

The architecture at MediaCity has been criticised by the editor of ''Building Design'' magazine, Ellis Woodman who describes it as "a crazed accumulation of development in which every aimlessly gesticulating building sports at least three different cladding treatments.
