The '''South Dakota State Capitol''' is the [[state capitol]] building of the U.S. state of [[South Dakota]]. Housing the [[South Dakota State Legislature]], it is located in the state capital of [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]] at 500 East Capitol Avenue. The building houses the offices of most state officials, including the [[Governor of South Dakota]].

==Construction==
The building was constructed between 1905 and 1910. The plans for the building were designed by the [[Minneapolis]] architectural office of C.E. Bell and M.S. Detwiler, who gave the building similar features to the [[Montana State Capitol]] in [[Helena, Montana]]. The planning process and construction costs came to almost $1,000,000.<ref name=intro>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.sd.us/STATE/CAPITOL/CAPITOL/TOUR/intro.htm|title=Introduction to the Capitol Building|publisher=South Dakota Official Home Page|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

==Features==
The floor in the capitol building is made of [[terrazzo]] tile. The floor is said to have been laid by 66 Italian artists. To give these artists a chance to place their signatures in the building (without allowing them to actually sign their names to the floor), each is said to have been given a blue stone to place in the floor. Only 55 of these tiles have been found, however. It is thought that the remaining stones may have been placed in locations now covered by walls, doors, or carpeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.sd.us/STATE/CAPITOL/CAPITOL/TOUR/bltiles.htm|title=Legendary Blue Tiles|publisher=South Dakota Official Home Page|work=Welcome to the On-Line Tour of the State Capitol!|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

From the first floor, a marble staircase leads upstairs. In front of the staircase, display cases house the First Lady Gown Collection. Miniature replicas have been made of the gown worn by each first lady to the state inaugural ball. These replicas are worn by dolls in the display case. Along with the doll, a picture of each governor's family and other mementos are also displayed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.sd.us/STATE/CAPITOL/CAPITOL/TOUR/firstlady.htm|title=First Lady Gown Collection|publisher=South Dakota Official Home Page|work=Welcome to the On-Line Tour of the State Capitol!|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

On the second floor, the marble staircase opens onto a rotunda. The dome of the rotunda is 96 feet high. The bottom ring is designed to resemble a string of ribbons joined together, which is meant to symbolize the eternal nature of government. The interior of the dome is decorated with sixteen images of the [[Tree of life#Hebrew bible/Christianity|Tree of Life]]. The dome also displays [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] leaves to represent wisdom and a [[pasque flower]], which is the state flower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.sd.us/STATE/CAPITOL/CAPITOL/TOUR/rotunda.htm|title=Second Floor Rotunda Area|publisher=South Dakota Official Home Page|work=Welcome to the On-Line Tour of the State Capitol!|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

The third floor houses the state's [[South Dakota House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the state's [[South Dakota Senate|Senate]]. The galleries for both, from which the public can observe the legislative process, are located on the fourth floor.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Capitol Building Tour Stops|url=http://www.state.sd.us/STATE/CAPITOL/CAPITOL/TOUR/stops.htm|accessdate=2008-09-02|publisher=South Dakota Official Home Page|work=Welcome to the On-Line Tour of the State Capitol!}}</ref>

==Outside memorials==
Four memorials are found on the grounds of the capitol building. The Fighting Stallions Memorial is a sculpture build to honor the eight South Dakota residents, including Governor [[George S. Mickelson]], that died in an airplane crash on April 19, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fighting Stallions Memorial|url=http://www.state.sd.us/STATE/CAPITOL/CAPITOL/TOUR/stallions/stallions.htm|accessdate=2008-09-02|publisher=South Dakota Official Home Page|work=Welcome to the On-Line Tour of the State Capitol!}}</ref> The Flaming Fountain Memorial is a fountain with a perpetually-burning natural gas flame.

==Renovation==
In anticipation of South Dakota's state centennial in 1989, the building was extensively renovated and restored during the administrations of Governors Richard F. Kneip, Harvey L. Wollman, Bill Janklow, and George S. Mickelson. The renovation took 22 years and restored much of the building and its decorations to its original appearance.<ref name=intro/> The tiled floor was also repaired; each of the tile workers is said to have been given a heart-shaped stone with which to "sign" the floor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capital city has culture, history and politics|url=http://www.argusleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060115/LIFE/301150002/1004|last=Callison|first=Jill|publisher=Sioux Falls Argus Leader|date=2006-01-15}} A copy of this article can be found at [http://fanset3.blogspot.com/2006/01/capital-city-has-culture-history-and_31.html]</ref>
