'''''Newsday''''' is a daily [[tabloid]]-size, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning, [[United States|American]] [[newspaper]] that primarily serves [[Long Island]] and the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]], although it is sold throughout the  New York City metropolitan area. As of fall 2007, ''Newsday'''s weekday circulation of 387,000 made it 10th-highest in the [[Newspapers in the United States|United States]], and the highest for a suburban newspaper.<ref name=nyt>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/business/media/21paper.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin "Three New York Moguls in Talks to Buy Newsday", by Tim Arango and Richard P<U+00E9>rez-Pe<U+00F1>a, March 21, 2008]</ref>

The newspaper headquarters is in [[Melville, New York]], on Long Island.

==History==
Founded by [[Alicia Patterson]], with backing from her husband, [[Harry Guggenheim]], the paper was first published on [[September 3]], [[1940]] from Hempstead. After Patterson's death in 1963, Guggenheim became publisher and editor, and in 1971, he sold the paper to the [[Times Mirror]] Co., owner of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. ''Newsday'' launched a separate Queens edition in 1977, followed by a New York City edition. In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with the [[Tribune Company]], partnering ''Newsday'' with the New York City television station [[WPIX]] (Channel 11), also owned by Tribune. [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[real estate]] magnate [[Samuel Zell]] purchased Tribune in 2007.<ref name=nyt />

[[News Corporation]], headed by CEO [[Rupert Murdoch]], attempted to purchase Newsday for [[USD|$]]580 million in April 2008.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/business/ny-bznews0423,0,696524.story ''Newsday'' (April 23, 2008): "Murdoch tells LI officials deal for ''Newsday'' close", by Ellen Yan and James T. Madadore]</ref> This was soon followed by a matching bid from ''[[New York Daily News]]'' owner [[Mort Zuckerman]]<ref>[http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/04/26/zuckerman_submits_580_million_newsday_bid_source/ Reuters (April 16, 2008): "Zuckerman submits $580 million Newsday bid: source", by Robert Macmillan and Kenneth Lee]</ref> and a $680 million bid from [[Cablevision]].<ref> [http://www.reuters.com/article/ousivMolt/idUSN0222014420080502 Reuters (May 2, 2008): "Cablevision submits $650 mln bid for Newsday: source" by Jui Chakravorty Das]</ref> In May 2008, News Corporation withdrew its bid,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-newsday-cablevision.html/ Reuters (May 11, 2008)]</ref> and on May 12, 2008, ''Newsday'' reported that Cablevision would purchase the paper for $650 million.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/business/ny-bznews0512x,0,7341028.story Cablevision announces deal to buy Newsday], Newsday, [[May 12]], [[2008]]</ref> The sale was completed July 29, 2008.<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6582623.html Cablevision Completes Newsday Buy from Tribune], Broadcasting and Cable, [[July 29]], [[2008]]</ref> 

===''New York Newsday''===
A separate edition of the newspaper, '''''New York Newsday''''', was established in 1985 and discontinued in 1995, though ''Newsday'' continues to be distributed in New York City.

==Editorial style==
Despite having a tabloid format, ''Newsday'' is not known for being sensationalistic, as are other local daily tabloids, such as the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref>Stevens, John D., ''Sensationalism and the New York Press'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1991) ISBN 0-231-07396-8</ref><ref>Hamill, Pete, ''News Is a Verb: Journalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' (New York: Ballantine Books, 1998) ISBN 0-345-42528-6</ref>

In 2004, the alternative weekly newspaper, [[Long Island Press]] wrote that ''Newsday'' has used its clout to influence local politics in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] Counties.<ref>''[[Long Island Press]]'', "Game Over: How the Paper's Monopoly Control Has Warped its Coverage and Hurt Long Island", by Christopher Twarowski, Dec. 30, 2004: "Numerous politicians in both counties, county workers, directors of community groups and other sources claim that 'Newsday' uses its position as Long Island's only daily paper to strong-arm county officials, nonprofit directors, local leaders and rival publications and even to influence pieces of legislation <U+2014> often through fear, intimidation and other anticompetitive practices <U+2014> to further its political or commercial agenda".</ref>

[[Bill Moyers]] briefly served as publisher.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/moyesrbill/moyersbill.htm The Museum of Broadcast Communications: Moyer biography]</ref> During the tenure of publisher [[Robert M. Johnson]] in the 1980s, Newsday made a major push into New York City. The paper's roster of [[newspaper columnist]]s and critics included [[Jimmy Breslin]], [[Barbara Garson]], [[Murray Kempton]], [[Gail Collins (journalist)|Gail Collins]], [[Pete Hamill]], [[Sydney Schanberg]], [[Jim Dwyer]], sportswriter [[Mike Lupica]], music critic [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]], and [[television]] critic [[Marvin Kitman]]. ''Newsday'' featured both the [[advice column]]ists [[Ann Landers]] and [[Dear Abby]] for several years. Its features section has included television [[reporter]]s [[Verne Gay]] and [[Diane Werts]], [[reality TV]] columnist [[Frank Lovece]], and [[film critic]]s John Anderson, [[Rafer Guzman]], [[Gene Seymour]], and [[Jan Stuart]].

Newsday's use of graphics has sometimes attracted national attention, particularly of the circa-1970 work of such longtime in-house illustrators as [[Gary Viskupic]], [[Tony D'Adamo]], and [[Ned Levine]].  [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Walt Handelsman]]'s editorial political cartoons animation are a nationally syndicated feature of Newsday. In the 1980s, a new design director, Robert Eisner, guided the transition into digital design and color printing.

''Newsday'' created and sponsored a "Long Island at the Crossroads" advisory board in 1978, to recommend regional goals, supervise local government, and to liaison with state and Federal officials.<ref>

It lasted approximately a decade.

==Circulation==
In 2008, ''Newsday'' was ranked 10th in terms of newspaper circulation in the [[United States]].<ref name=nyt />

A circulation scandal in 2004 revealed that the paper's daily and Sunday circulation had been inflated by 16.9% and 14.5%, respectively, in the auditing period September 30, 2002 to September 30, 2003.<ref name=abc2>[http://www.accessabc.com/press/press111604.htm Audit Bureau of Circulation, "ABC Releases ''Newsday'' Audit", November 16, 2004]</ref> The Audit Bureau of Circulation adjusted average weekday circulation to 481,816 from 579,599; average Saturday circulation to 392,649 from 416,830; and average Sunday circulation to 574,081 from 671,820, and instituted twice-yearly audits.<ref name=abc2>[http://www.accessabc.com/press/press111604.htm Audit Bureau of Circulation: "ABC Releases ''Newsday'' Audit", November 16, 2004]</ref>
