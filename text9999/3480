'''Basil Wolverton''' (July 9, 1909 &ndash; December 31, 1978) was an [[People of the United States|American]] cartoonist, illustrator, [[Comic book creator|comic book writer-artist]] and professed "Producer of Preposterous Pictures of Peculiar People who Prowl this Perplexing Planet",<ref>[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/basilwolvertonia/ Yahoo! Groups: Basilwolvertonia]</ref> whose many publishers included [[Marvel Comics]] and ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''. 

His unique, humorously grotesque drawings have elicited a wide range of reactions. Cartoonist [[Will Elder]] said he found Wolverton's technique "outrageously inventive, defying every conventional standard yet upholding a very unusual sense of humor. He was a refreshing original," while [[Jules Feiffer]] stated, "I don't like his work. I think it's ugly".<ref>Both quotes from ''Wolvertoons: The Art of Basil Wolverton'', edited by Dick Voll. ([[Fantagraphics Books]], 1990) ISBN 1560970227, ISBN 978-1560970224</ref>

He was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry's [[List of Harvey Award winners#The Jack Kirby Hall of Fame|Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] in 1991.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in [[Central Point, Oregon|Central Point]], [[Oregon]], he later moved to [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and worked as a [[vaudeville]] performer and a cartoonist and reporter for the ''Portland News''. At age 16 he sold his first nationally published work and began pitching comic strips to newspaper syndicates. His [[comic strip]], ''Marco of Mars,'' was accepted by the Independent Syndicate of New York in 1929 but never distributed because it was deemed too similar to ''[[Buck Rogers]],'' which debuted that year.<ref name=jim>[http://www.bpib.com/illustrat/wolvertn.htm Vadebponcoeur, Jr., Jim. "Basil Wolverton"]</ref>

''Disk-Eyes the Detective'' and ''Spacehawks'' were published in 1938 in ''Circus'' comics.  In 1940, ''Spacehawk'' (a different and improved feature) made its debut in ''Target Comics'' ([[Novelty Press]]), running for 30 episodes (262 pages) until 1942.<ref name=jim/>

===Powerhouse Pepper and Lena the Hyena===
Wolverton's [[humor]] feature ''[[Powerhouse Pepper]]'', about a superstrong if none-too-bright [[boxing|boxer]], appeared in various comic books published by [[Timely Comics]], the 1930s and 1940s precursor of [[Marvel Comics]], from 1942 through 1952 (76 episodes, 539 pages{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}). Admirers consider{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} that series a high-water mark <!--"high-water mark" spelling per Merriam-Webster dictionary at http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/high-water%20mark--> of humorous comics, with its alliterative, rhyming dialogue, screwball comedy, and throwaway gags in background signs.

[[Image:Lenahyena.png|thumb|480px|''L'il Abner'' daily strip by Al Capp, introducing Basil Wolverton's "Lena Hyena"]]
In 1946 Wolverton won a contest to depict "Lena Hyena", the world's ugliest woman, a running gag in [[Al Capp]]'s ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' newspaper strip where ''Lena'' remained unseen beneath an editorial note stating her face had been covered to protect readers. Capp, responding to popular demand, announced a contest for artists to submit their interpretations to be judged by [[Boris Karloff]], [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Among 500,000 entries, Wolverton's was the winner; it appeared in a ''Li'l Abner'' daily and ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'' magazine. Wolverton's fame briefly lead to ''Life'' and ''[[Pageant (magazine)|Pageant]]'' printing his caricatures. The ''Lena'' portrait typified the unique "spaghetti and meatballs" style he employed regularly thereafter.<ref name=jim/>

In the 1950s, Wolverton produced 17 comic-book [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[science-fiction]] stories for Marvel and other comic-book publishers, including one story by author [[Daniel Keyes]], which led to him being "hailed for creating uniquely grotesque monsters".<ref>"Comics That Draw Gasps, Not Smiles", John Stanley. Sunday, September 25, 2005, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. p.PK - 24.</ref>

===''Mad''===
Wolverton first appeared in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' with a single panel in #10, drew ''Mad Reader!'' for #11 and also contributed an iconic Lena-like image to the cover of #11, which was billed as the "Beautiful Girl of the Month". Mocking the glossy cover images of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'', Wolverton's hag was ''Mad'''s first magazine parody cover image. Although Wolverton contributed sporadically to the title<U+2014>appearing in just nine issues over two decades<U+2014>his work was memorable enough that, in 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' dubbed him "The Michelangelo of Mad Magazine".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/07/22/arts/20090723_BASIL_SLIDESHOW_index.html "The Michelangelo of Mad Magazine"] (slideshow), ''[[The New York Times]]'', n.d.</ref>

In 1956, Wolverton illustrated Herbert Armstrong's apocalyptic booklet ''1975 in Prophecy'' and later, ''The Book of Revelation Unveiled at Last'', offered free on Armstrong's radio show ''[[The World Tomorrow]].''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 1958, Wolverton began writing and illustrating ''The Bible Story,'' also titled ''The Story of Man,'' covering the entire history of the Old Testament, serialized in ''[[The Plain Truth]]'' and later published in six volumes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Later career===
In 1968 Wolverton did a series of posters for [[Topps]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} displaying his trademark twisted headshots, and in 1973 he returned to mainstream comics, illustrating several covers for [[Joe Orlando]]'s satiric ''[[Plop!]]'' at [[DC Comics]]. His return was cut short by a [[Cerebrovascular accident|stroke]] in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} He died in Vancouver, Washington, four years later.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Personal life==
Wolverton was baptized into [[Herbert W. Armstrong|Herbert W. Armstrong's]] [[Radio Church of God]] in 1941 and was [[ordination|ordained]] as an [[elder (religious)|elder]] in 1943. As a board member of that church, he was one of the six people, including Armstrong and his wife, who re-incorporated the church in 1946 when it moved its original headquarters from Oregon to [[California]].

Wolverton's son, editorial cartoonist [[Monte Wolverton]], draws in a style similar to his father's; the younger Wolverton also worked for ''The Plain Truth'' and contributed to ''Mad''. Several cartoonists have been influenced by Wolverton's "spaghetti-and-meatball" style, including the hotrod stalwart [[Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
