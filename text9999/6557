The '''2006 New Jersey State Government shutdown''' was the first [[Government shutdown|shutdown]] in the [[History of New Jersey|history]] of the state of [[New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13661651/ |title= Holiday session doesn<U+2019>t end N.J. budget crisis: Lawmakers reject Governor<U+2019>s tax plan, casinos may close Wednesday |accessdate=2006-07-04 |work=MSNBC.com |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=[[July 4]], [[2006]] }}</ref> The shutdown occurred after the [[New Jersey Legislature]] and [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] [[Jon Corzine]] failed to agree on a state budget by the [[New Jersey State Constitution|constitutional]] deadline. Furthermore, Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered the shutdown as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. The shutdown began at midnight on [[July 1]], [[2006]], when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non-essential government services, which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on [[July 4]].

The shutdown officially concluded after the legislature adopted a budget on [[July 8]], [[2006]]. All government services were restored by 8:30 a.m. on [[July 10]], [[2006]].

== Background ==
[[Image:JosephJRoberts.jpg|frame|left|Assemblyman [[Joseph J. Roberts]]]]
During the [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2005|2005 gubernatorial election]] Corzine, a former executive at [[Goldman Sachs]], claimed he was "not encumbered by an old culture, historical entanglements and the status quo" and had a plan to use his experience to overhaul the budget process and trim spending.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/31/nyregion/metrocampaigns/31corzine.html|title=Opening Bid for Governor, Corzine Vows Ethics Reform|last=Kocieniewski|first=David|date=2005-03-31|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref> When he introduced his first budget as governor, the $30.9 billion plan included $2 billion in spending cuts as well as increases in taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and luxury cars.<ref name="nyt3">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/23/nyregion/23jersey.html|title=Corzine Asks New Jersey to Bite a Fiscal Bullet |last=Jones|first=Richard G.|coauthors=David W.

The President of the [[New Jersey Senate]], former Governor [[Richard Codey]], had stated his support for Corzine's budget including the tax increase. The stalemate in the negotiations had been with the [[New Jersey General Assembly]], whose [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]], [[Joseph J. Roberts]], strongly rejected the Governor's plan.<ref name="nyt4"> {{cite news | last=Jones | first=Richard | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/nyregion/27trenton.html?ex=1154491200&en=4bed09362c2f9b10&ei=5070 | title= Support Builds for Corzine's Sales Tax Plan | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=[[June 27]], [[2006]] | accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> At the time Roberts said, "Our caucus feels overwhelmingly that there are much more appealing alternatives to balance the budget than a sales tax increase."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/02/ap/politics/mainD8IJR6F80.shtml|title=N.J.

The [[New Jersey State Constitution]], under Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 2, requires that the state's expenses for "as far as can be ascertained or reasonably foreseen" (i.e., the [[fiscal year]]) be provided for in a single budget act.<ref name="njsc">{{cite web|url= http://www.state.nj.us/hangout_nj/government.html|accessdate=2006-11-14|title= State Government - State Constitution|publisher=[[State of New Jersey]]}}</ref> If this does not occur before the previous budget lapses, the same section also outlaws any expenditure of money. The constitution also contains a provision in the previous paragraph preventing appropriations from going into [[wikt:red ink|red ink]];<ref name="njsc"/> the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] had interpreted this to exclude [[loan]]s made to cover shortfalls, and Corzine claimed that the state had a poor credit rating anyway.

In three of the previous five years, the legislature had failed to meet the [[June 30]] deadline.<ref name="nyt2">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/nyregion/02corzine.html|title=Corzine Orders New Jersey Government Shutdown|last=Jones|first=Richard|date=2006-07-02|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref> On each of those occasions an agreement had been reached by the morning of [[July 2]].<ref name="CBS1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/01/politics/main1773801.shtml|title=Amid Bitter Budget Battle, Gov.

== Causes ==
[[Image:SenatorJonCorzine.jpg|right|thumb|Governor Corzine [Picture taken during his term as U.S. Senator].]]
Corzine, in attempting to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow [[New Jersey Democratic Party|state Democrats]] in the [[New Jersey General Assembly]], particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7%<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/news/jjournal/index.ssf?/base/news-1/1151649105285280.xml&coll=3 | title=Corzine: Lack of deal will halt lottery, close Liberty State Park| publisher=[[Jersey Journal]] | date=[[June 30]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated that he would not accept a budget that did not include a sales tax increase.<ref name="nyt4"/> Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.

== The shutdown ==

After the legislature failed to pass a budget by [[midnight]] [[July 1]] when the old budget ended, the governor signed [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] number 17<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/approved/20060701a.html | title=Governor Corzine Signs Executive Order for Orderly Shutdown of Government Operations | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]] | date=[[July 1]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> that immediately stopped numerous non-essential government functions, with more to come after the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] [[holiday]] on [[July 4]], [[2006]].

State functions that ceased immediately included the [[New Jersey Lottery]], the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation|New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission]], MVC offices and inspection stations, the [[New Jersey Department of Education]] and parts of the New Jersey Judiciary.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/07/04/nj.budget.ap/index.html | title=N.J. lawmakers meet amid shutdown: Atlantic City's casinos may be closed | work=[[CNN.com]] | date=[[July 4]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref> Approximately 45,000 state employees who were listed as "non-essential" were told to stay home.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/news/nation/15010760.htm | title=In N.J., state workers back on job] | publisher=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] | date=[[July 8]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref>

Later (post-[[July 4]]) shutdowns included [[Jersey shore|state beaches]], [[public park]]s, historic sites, gambling at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] [[casino]]s as well as [[horse racing]] in the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] and [[Monmouth Park Racetrack]].

Both of the latter two were due to the official monitors from the [[New Jersey Casino Control Commission]] being listed as non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law stated that gambling establishments could not legally operate without state oversight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2006/07/03/daily9.html?jst=s_cn_hl|title=Casinos close, parks and beaches next in N.J. budget battle|date=2006-07-05|work=Philadelphia Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on [[July 1]], but a State Court order allowed them to close later. The casinos attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the state but by the casinos themselves, but the appeal was rejected at the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]; therefore they were forced to close.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a.Yx6zBwqcs0&refer=us|title=New Jersey Government Shut as Budget Talks Continue (Update4)|last=Servetah|first=Stacie|date=2006-07-03|work=Bloomberg.com|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', "[[New Jersey Transit]], prisons, [[New Jersey State Police|state police]], developmental centers, veterans' homes, mental hospitals, health and disease-prevention offices, child welfare, work on transportation safety, response to environmental contamination, [and] inspectors of amusement parks" were not affected by the order to shut down.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/14966569.htm | title=Today, N.J. shutdown deepens: A Corzine speech and Assembly flyers at a rare session did not defuse the budget fight.

== Post-shutdown governmental action ==
In order to restore government services, on [[July 3]], [[2006]] Corzine signed an executive order calling for an unprecedented [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] session of the General Assembly to work on presenting him with a budget.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/approved/20060703.html | title=Governor Signs Executive Order Calling For A Special Legislative Session | date=[[July 3]], [[2006]] | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]]|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Immediately after listening to the governor's speech, the legislature voted by voice vote to adjourn the session. The General Assembly met again, without proposing a budget, the following day.

Meeting on the third day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a compromise budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's [[property tax]] <U+2014> highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales tax increase in subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] [[referendum]].<ref name=WNBC>{{cite web | url=http://www.wnbc.com/politics/9452231/detail.html | title=N.J. Budget Creeping To Finish | work=[[WNBC]] | date=[[July 8]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref>  On [[November 7]], [[2006]] New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17447841&BRD=1091&PAG=461&dept_id=425695&rfi=6 | title=State ballot questions gain broad approval | publisher=[[Princeton Packet]] | date=[[November 10]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref>

Early in the morning of [[July 8]], [[2006]], both houses of the legislature passed the proposed budget. At 6:00 a.m. that day, Corzine signed executive order number 19<ref>{{cite press release | url= http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/approved/20060708.html | title=Governor Corzine Signs Executive Order to Begin Orderly Resumption of Government Operations | date=[[July 8]], [[2006]] | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]]|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> to restore government services. The casinos in Atlantic City opened for business at 7:00 a.m. Remaining government services, including race tracks and the state lottery, also reopened on [[July 8]], [[2006]]. State courts and motor vehicle offices resumed normal operations on [[July 10]], [[2006]], fully ending the shutdown.

Corzine utilized his [[line-item veto]] authority to reduce the budget by over $51.3 million by eliminating or reducing over 50 spending items.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/approved/20060708a.html | title=Governor Corzine Signs FY 07 Appropriations Act | date=[[July 8]], [[2006]] | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]]|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref>

== Effects ==
During the casino shutdown, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost revenue for the state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes.<ref name=WNBC/> However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to less than a fraction of one percent of the state's annual budget. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/2008/approved/20080627.html | title= Governor Signs Legislation to Keep Casinos Open | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]] | date=[[2008-06-27]]|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref>

All [[driver's license]]s and [[vehicle registration]]s that were to expire at the end of July were extended one month.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/About/Faq_Closing.htm | title=New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission: Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]] |accessdate=2006-07-31}}</ref>

The increase in the rate of the state sales tax from 6% to 7% took effect on [[July 15]], [[2006]], and also increased the sales tax rate in the state's [[Urban Enterprise Zone]]s (UEZs) from 3% to 3.5%. A significant change was made in the payment of sales taxes by businesses operating in the UEZs in that they would be required to pay the entire amount of the full tax rate to the state on all appropriate purchases, and wait for the state to rebate them the difference.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/new_jersey/15010632.htm | title=Corzine's cuts: Hard to some, soft to GOP | publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date=[[2006-07-11]]|accessdate=2006-07-11}}</ref>

The budget also included changes to products and services that are subject to the sales tax, effective [[October 1]], [[2006]]. The newly taxable items included downloaded music, ringtones, movies and books; shipping and handling; drapery and carpet dry cleaning; floor installation; contracted landscaping; self-storage; tanning; massages; tattooing; magazines; investigation and security services such as armored cars and alarm systems; limousines, except for those used in funerals; memberships in health, athletic and shopping clubs; and parking, except for employee parking, parking at municipal meters and parking already subject to municipal parking taxes.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/jersey/index.ssf?/base/news-3/1152939100301940.xml&coll=1 | title=Some advice on effects tax hike will have on goods and services | publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]] | date=[[July 15]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/salestaxbase.htm | title=Information Regarding Sales and Use Tax Changes Effective October 1, 2006 | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]] |accessdate=2006-10-15}}</ref>

Other immediate tax increases in the budget included an increase in the cigarette tax by $0.175 per pack; a 0.4% surcharge on automobile purchases of over $45,000.00 and on vehicles with an average combined city highway [[miles per gallon]] 19 or less; a new 6% tax on [[fur clothing]];<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/furclothingnotice.pdf | title=Special Notice to Retail Sellers of Fur Clothing and Accessories | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]] | accessdate=2006-07-16}}</ref> an increase in the rental-car tax from $2 to $5 per day;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/rentalnotice.pdf | title=Notice to Motor Vehicle Rental Company Businesses | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]] |accessdate=2006-07-16}}</ref> and increases on several business taxes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/surtaxchanges.pdf | title=New Jersey Corporation Business Surtax and Minimum Tax Changes | publisher=[[State of New Jersey]] |accessdate=2006-07-16}}</ref>

These additional revenues were expected, when combined with spending cuts including a reduction of $200 million in [[higher education]] spending, to meet the state's balanced-budget requirement. A clause was also inserted into the budget cutting state aid for schools that hold over $1 billion in [[Financial endowment|endowments]].  The only school in New Jersey that fell into this category was [[Princeton University]], which had an endowment with assets over $11 billion in 2006. The university that had the largest endowment next to Princeton at the time was [[Drew University]] which had a $225 million endowment fund.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/base/news-7/11526859954680.xml&coll=1 | title=Budget 101: State erases Princeton aid | publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]]| date=[[2006-07-12]]|accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref>

==Political influences==
Corzine's shutdown of state government had some effect on New Jersey and national politics. According to Clay F. Richards, assistant director of a poll by [[Quinnipiac University]], Corzine had a 44% approval rating, his highest since January 2006. The poll also indicated that 71% of respondents disapproved of the legislature's handling of its job. According to Richards, "New Jersey voters clearly blame the state legislature for the budget crisis, and say the property-tax relief that the legislature insisted on in the compromise is more politics than real reform."<ref> {{cite press release | title=Corzine Is Early Winner In Battle Of Trenton, Quinnipiac University New Jersey Poll Finds; Voters Blame Legislature 3 <U+2013> 1 For Budget Crisis | publisher = [[Quinnipiac University]]| url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1299.xml?ReleaseID=937|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> Of those polled, 23% indicated that they will not vote for those representatives who voted for the sales-tax hike in the future. The legislature's next election was in November 2007, but Corzine will not face re-election until 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wnbc.com/politics/9516725/detail.html | title=Poll: Voters Blame Legislature, Not Governor, For State Shutdown | work=[[WNBC]] | date=[[July 14]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref>

There was also speculation that the [[New Jersey United States Senate election, 2006|U.S. Senate race]], already seen as tight, would be affected.  Republican candidate [[Thomas Kean, Jr.]] said Democratic Senator [[Bob Menendez]] did not oppose Corzine's tax hike because Corzine appointed Menendez to serve out the remainder of his own term in the Senate.<ref name="race"/> According to Peter Woolley, director of [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s [[PublicMind]] poll, the situation of the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate [[Christine Todd Whitman|Christie Whitman]], a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator [[Bill Bradley]] due to Democratic Governor [[Jim Florio]]'s sales- and income-tax increases.<ref name="race">{{cite web | url=http://www.wnbc.com/politics/9479016/detail.html | title=N.J.
