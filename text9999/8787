[[Image:KiltSquad2.jpg|thumb|right|230px|KMHS Kilt Squad]]
The "Kilt Squad" consists of four seniors at KMHS who paint their faces and chests and also wear kilts to the football games.  The current and founding fathers of the K-Side Kilt Squad (est. 2005) are Ben Ramsey (K), Ross Durrence (M), Stephen Halford (H), Samer Massad (S).  

The "K-Side Krazies" are a student group which was formed after the famous "[[Cameron Crazies]]" from [[Duke University]].  The Kilt Squad play an integral role in the Krazies.  Being such a large school, school spirit is vital for student involvement and participation.
