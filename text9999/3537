"'''All Things Must Pass'''" is a song by [[George Harrison]], released in 1970 as the title track to his [[All Things Must Pass|triple album of the same name]]. [[Billy Preston]] originally released the song on his [[Apple Records|Apple]] album ''[[Encouraging Words]]'' after The Beatles rejected it in 1969 for their then forthcoming ''[[Let It Be]]'' album.  The music of [[The Band]] influenced the song as Harrison spent time with the group in late 1968 following the completion of The Beatles' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]''.  [[Timothy Leary]]'s poem, "All Things Pass", a psychedelic adaptation of the [[Tao Te Ching]], provided inspiration for the song.

Music critics classify "All Things Must Pass" as one of Harrison's finest compositions. The rejection of the song by Harrison's former band led critics to describe it as "the wisest song never recorded by The Beatles".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Interpreted as a statement on the band's break-up upon its release, the subject matter deals with the transient nature of human existence. Writers frequently quoted the lyrics following Harrison's death in November 2001.  Cover versions include recordings by artists [[Jim James]], [[Sloan Wainwright]], [[Yusuf Islam]] and [[Paul McCartney]].

==Background and composition==
Like his friend [[Eric Clapton]], George Harrison was inspired by ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', the "monumental" debut album<ref name="Harris p 68">Harris, p. 66.</ref> from [[The Band]], the former backing group for [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>Clayson, p. 258.</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>Leng, pp 51<U+2212>53.</ref> Released in July 1968, ''Music from Big Pink'' was partly responsible for Harrison's return to the guitar, his first instrument,<ref>Leng, p. 317.</ref> after he spent two years attempting to master the more complex Indian [[sitar]].<ref>Olivia Harrison, p. 194.</ref><ref>George Harrison, pp 57<U+2212>58.</ref> Harrison duly shared his enthusiasm with the British music press, declaring ''Big Pink'' "''the'' new sound to come from America", drummer [[Levon Helm]] later recalled, thus helping to establish The Band internationally.<ref name=autogenerated4>Helm, pp 177<U+2212>78.</ref> In appreciation, their guitarist, [[Robbie Robertson]], extended an invitation to him to stop by in [[Woodstock, New York]], when the opportunity arose.<ref>Clayson, p. 242.</ref>

Late in 1968, after producing sessions in [[Los Angeles]] for Apple signing [[Jackie Lomax]]'s ''Is This What You Want?'' album,<ref>Miles, p. 313.</ref> Harrison spent [[Thanksgiving]] and much of December in upstate [[New York]],<ref name="Huntley p 18">Huntley,  p. 18.</ref> where he renewed his friendship with a now semi-retired Dylan and took part in a series of informal jam sessions with The Band.<ref name=autogenerated1>MacDonald, p. 302.</ref><ref>George Harrison, p. 164.</ref>  According to Helm, they discussed plans for a possible "fireside jam" album with Clapton and an [[Apple Corps#Apple Films|Apple Films]] "rock [[Western (genre)|western]]" called ''Zachariah'', but neither project ever occurred.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Nevertheless, the period was fruitful, producing the Harrison<U+2212>Dylan composition "[[I'd Have You Anytime]]" and "All Things Must Pass", which Harrison later described as a "Robbie Robertson<U+2212>Band type of tune".<ref name="IMM p 184">George Harrison, p. 184.</ref> 

Lyrically, the song drew inspiration from "All Things Pass", a poem published in [[Timothy Leary]]'s 1966 book ''Psychedelic Prayers after the [[Tao Te Ching]]''.<ref>Allison, p. 135.</ref><ref name="Greene p 140">Greene, p. 140.</ref>  In [[I Me Mine#I Me Mine book|Harrison's autobiography]], Harrison refers to the idea for the song originating from "all kinds of mystics and ex-mystics", including Leary.<ref name="IMM p 184" /> Like a number of Harrison songs (for example, "[[Here Comes the Sun]]", "[[So Sad]]" and "[[Blow Away]]"), metaphors involving the weather and the cycle of nature inform the lyrical and emotional content of "All Things Must Pass".<ref>Leng, pp 42, 96<U+2212>97, 152, 205.</ref>

Musically, the verses are set to a logical climb within the key of [[E major]];<ref>MacDonald, p. 448.</ref> the brief [[refrain|choruses]] form a departure from this, with their inclusion of a B [[minor chord]] rather than the more expected major [[voicing (music)|voicing]] <U+2212> an example of the same "[[Mode (music)|modes]], [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Nonchord tone#Suspension|suspensions]]" found in Band songs such as "[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]", Harrison biographer Ian Inglis notes.<ref name="Inglis p 30">Inglis, p. 30.</ref>

Simon Leng, author of the first musical biography on George Harrison, has written of the lyrics reflecting "life's ephemeral character" and the "transitory" nature of love;<ref name="Leng p 96" /> to Inglis, the song is "[o]stensibly" about "the end of a love affair".<ref name="Inglis p 30" /> A number of writers note the optimism offered in Harrison's words,<ref name="Inglis p 30" /><ref>Allison, pp 37<U+2212>38.</ref> since, as Leng puts it, "a new day always dawns."<ref name="Leng p 96" /> 

Although "All Things Must Pass" avoids [[religiosity]], theologian [[Dale Allison]] observes that its statement on the "all-inclusive" transience of things in the material world explains why so much of its parent album "finds hope and meaning only in God, who does not pass away".<ref>Allison, pp 62, 135.</ref> The song's main message is offered in its [[Thirty-two-bar form#Middle eight|middle eight]]:<ref name="Leng pp 96-97">Leng, pp 96<U+2212>97.</ref><ref>Allison, p. 62.</ref>

Ultimately, the cycle of nature offers "consolation", Leng opines,<ref name="Leng pp 96-97" /> as further evidenced in the verse-three lines "''Now the darkness only stays at night time ... Daylight is good at arriving at the right time''".<ref name="Inglis p 30" />

Before Harrison came to record the song for ''All Things Must Pass'', the lyrics underwent some minor changes, once he presented it to the other Beatles, then gathered at [[Twickenham Film Studios]] for the so-called ''[[Let It Be|Get Back]]'' project, in January 1969.<ref name="Spizer p 225" /> Verse two's second line was initially written as the more literal "''A wind can blow those clouds away''",<ref name="IMM p 185">George Harrison, p. 185.</ref> but [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] from the sessions reveal [[John Lennon]] suggesting the word "mind", to introduce a bit of "[[psychedelia]]" into the song.<ref>Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 49.</ref> Similarly, the repeated line "''it's not always gonna be this grey''" was originally "''It's not always been this grey''" in verses one and two, a change of perspective that Harrison made before [[Billy Preston]] came to record the song early the following year.<ref>George Harrison, pp 185<U+2212>86.</ref>

==Pre-''All Things Must Pass'' recording history==

===The Beatles' version===
After being treated with respect as an "artist" in Los Angeles music circles and an equal among the likes of Bob Dylan and The Band, Harrison returned to the Beatles fold and found the same discordant atmosphere that had blighted the lengthy sessions for their [[The Beatles (album)|1968 double album]].<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>Huntley, pp 20<U+2212>22.</ref><ref>Clayson, pp 259<U+2212>60, 288.</ref> "[S]traight away, again, it was just weird vibes," Harrison later recalled. "You know, I was starting to enjoy being a musician, but the moment I got back with the Beatles it was just too difficult."<ref name="Huntley p 18" /> Early on in the ''Get Back'' sessions <U+2212> and tellingly, music journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] notes, before the arrival that day of Lennon and his ever-present partner [[Yoko Ono]] <U+2212> Harrison enthused with fellow Beatles [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Paul McCartney]] about The Band's group ethos: "They're just living, and they happen to be a band as well."<ref name="Harris/Woods p 92">John Harris, "Into the Woods", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', December 2003, p. 92.</ref> Helm's "whiskers" received special mention and the fact that, in contrast to the atmosphere within The Beatles, he had "a ''happy, smiling face''".<ref name="Harris/Woods p 92" /><ref name="Sulpy & Schweighardt p 29">Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 29.</ref>

On 2 January, day one of the Twickenham film shoot, Harrison introduced "All Things Must Pass", and the band worked on the song intermittently over the next four days of filming;<ref>Miles, p. 327.</ref><ref>Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp 5, 319.</ref> they returned to it briefly towards the end of the month, by which time the project had moved location to [[Apple Corps#Apple Studio|Apple's basement studio]]<ref name="Spizer p 225" /> <U+2212> one of Harrison's conditions for rejoining The Beatles after his temporary walkout on 10 January.<ref name="Harris p 68" /><ref>Miles, pp 330, 331.</ref> In the search for a suitable musical arrangement for "All Things Must Pass", Harrison stressed his preference for a "feel" akin to The Band, a suggestion that resulted in Lennon switching from guitar to [[Lowrey organ]] (a keyboard favoured by The Band's [[Garth Hudson]]).<ref>Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp 42, 44<U+2212>45.</ref> Although a fair amount of time was dedicated to the song,<ref name="Sulpy & Schweighardt p 6">Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 6.</ref> it was ultimately pushed aside, just as other Harrison compositions including "[[Old Brown Shoe]]", "[[Isn't It a Pity]]", "[[Let It Down]]" and "[[I Me Mine]]" received a lukewarm reception,<ref>Leng, p. 39.</ref> particularly from Lennon.<ref>Miles, p. 328.</ref><ref>Clayson, p. 260.</ref><ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', pp 38, 187.</ref><ref>Huntley, pp 18<U+2212>19, 21.</ref> [[David Fricke]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' has referred to this period as a "struggle" for Harrison "against the patronizing restrictions of writing within and for the Beatles",<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 180.</ref> while Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt, authors of ''Get Back: The Unauthorized Chronicle of The Beatles' Let It Be Disaster'', observe that Harrison's songs were routinely rejected by Lennon and McCartney "even though some were far better than their own".<ref>Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 1.</ref>

The Beatles never formally recorded "All Things Must Pass"<ref name="Spizer p 225" /> although at least one rehearsal take exists featuring the full group.<ref name="Sulpy & Schweighardt p 6" /><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raH8HBpkkpY The Beatles <U+2212> All Things Must Pass], YouTube, 9 December 2007 (retrieved 20 August 2011).</ref>  The ''Fly on the Wall'' bonus disc accompanying the McCartney-instigated ''[[Let It Be... Naked]]'' album in 2003 includes a snippet of The Beatles indulging in Band-like chorusing on the song.<ref name="Huntley p 21">Huntley, p. 21.</ref>

===Harrison's solo demo===
Also on the ''Get Back'' bootlegs, Harrison can be heard having a conversation with Lennon and Ono about possibly doing a solo album of his unused songs, in order to "preserve this, the Beatle bit, more".<ref name="Hertsgaard p 283">Hertsgaard, p. 283.</ref> Lennon appears to support the idea<ref name="Hertsgaard p 283" /> <U+2212> perhaps, author [[Bruce Spizer]] has suggested, to "spare" The Beatles from having to record Harrison's songs.<ref>Spizer, p. 220.</ref> While no such album would eventuate until after the band's [[The Beatles' break-up|break-up]], on 25 February 1969 (his twenty-sixth birthday), Harrison entered [[Abbey Road Studios]] alone and recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of "All Things Must Pass", along with other recent compositions "Old Brown Shoe" and "[[Something]]".<ref>Miles, p. 335.</ref><ref>Leng, p. 41.</ref> With [[Ken Scott]] serving as engineer,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> he recorded two takes of "All Things Must Pass", adding extra electric guitar onto the second.<ref name="Spizer p 225" /><ref>Mark Lewisohn, sleeve notes in booklet accompanying The Beatles' ''[[Anthology 3]]'' album (Apple Records, 1996; produced by George Martin), p. 33.</ref> This version was eventually released in 1996 on the Beatles collection ''[[Anthology 3]]''.<ref name="Spizer p 225">Spizer, p. 225.</ref>

===Billy Preston<U+2019>s version===
Although Harrison began talking publicly about the idea of a solo album during the final months of 1969,<ref>Peter Doggett, "Fight to the Finish", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]: The Beatles' Final Years Special Edition'', February 2003, p. 139.</ref> he offered "All Things Must Pass" to [[Billy Preston]] for his 1970 album ''[[Encouraging Words]]''.<ref>Clayson, p. 281.</ref><ref>Apple Records, [http://applerecords.com/#!/albums/Album_EncouragingWords "Billy Preston ''Encouraging Words''"] (retrieved 28 April 2012)</ref> After the ''Get Back/Let It Be'' sessions relocated to their own [[Apple Corps#Apple Studio|Apple Studio]] in central London, Harrison invited Preston to play keyboards for The Beatles.<ref>Miles, p. 331.</ref><ref name="Spizer p 225" /><ref>Huntley, pp 25<U+2212>27.</ref> The 22-year-old Texan impressed the participants with his superior musicianship and convivial presence,<ref>Kit O'Toole, [http://blogcritics.org/music/article/billy-preston-inspires-musically-and-spiritually/ "Billy Preston Inspires Musically and Spiritually with 1970's ''Encouraging Words''"], BioCritics, 30 July 2011 (retrieved 28 April 2012).</ref><ref>Madinger & Easter, p. 424.</ref> resulting in a recording contract with Apple Records.<ref>Clayson, p. 265.</ref> ''Encouraging Words'' became the second (and last) album under the contract.<ref>Lois Wilson, "The Fifth Element", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]: The Beatles' Final Years Special Edition'', February 2003, p. 80.</ref><ref name="Spizer p 340">Spizer, p. 340.</ref> Co-produced by Harrison, Preston's reading of "All Things Must Pass" betrays an obvious debt to his former mentor [[Ray Charles]].<ref>Leng, p. 71.</ref> Music critics consider Preston's version superior to Harrison's "definitive" version of the song released a few months later.<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 431" /><ref>Bruce Eder, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/encouraging-words-mw0000618856 "Billy Preston ''Encouraging Words''"], [[Allmusic]] (retrieved 28 April 2012).</ref>

==''All Things Must Pass'' recording==
Despite having given "All Things Must Pass" to Billy Preston for his forthcoming album (released in September 1970),<ref>Castleman & Porazik, pp 91<U+2212>92.</ref> Harrison chose to record it himself for what would turn out to be the title song of his post-Beatle "masterpiece", ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''.<ref name="Schaffner p 142">Schaffner, p. 142.</ref> The basic track was taped early in June, judging by the appearance of [[Pete Drake]] on the session;<ref>Badman, p. 11.</ref> other participants included Clapton and Starr, the latter another avowed Band fan.<ref>Leng, pp 69, 96.</ref> Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley describes "All Things Must Pass" as a "haunting hymn about the mortality of everything" and notes the added poignance in Harrison's version, due to the death of his mother in July 1970 after a long period of illness.<ref name="Huntley p 59" />

The recording opens with [[Bobby Whitlock]]'s "unvaryingly steady" piano chords<ref name="Inglis p 30" /> and "sensitive" string orchestration from [[John Barham]],<ref name="Leng p 96" /> soon joined by [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]]-arranged horns and Drake's country [[pedal steel guitar]].<ref name="Spizer p 225" /> This combination received praise for providing the song with its rising and falling musical moods, implying variously light and darkness,<ref name="Leng p 96" /> mirroring the "competing impressions" of hope and melancholy found in Harrison's lyrics.<ref name="Inglis p 30" /> Compared to the earlier readings, this version of "All Things Must Pass" has "a stateliness that avoids lugubriousness", in the words of [[Allmusic]]'s Richie Unterberger.<ref>Richie Unterberger, [http://www.allmusic.com/song/all-things-must-pass-t743165 "All Things Must Pass"], [[Allmusic]] (retrieved 28 April 2012).</ref> True to its [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill]] roots, the song evokes The Band and their classic "[[The Weight]]",<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 431" /><ref>Clayson, p. 251.</ref> as well as their [[The Band (album)|eponymous second album]],<ref>Leng, pp 53, 96.</ref> the tracks on which were inspired, like "All Things Must Pass", by "the beauty of that autumn in Woodstock".<ref>Helm, p. 178.</ref> Leng finds the strongest similarities between Harrison's songs from this period and Robbie Robertson's in the latter's "The Unfaithful Servant", the "sweet-and-sour" horn arrangement from which Harrison "recycled" on "All Things Must Pass".<ref>Leng, p. 53.</ref>

Erratic attendance by co-producer [[Phil Spector]] during the ''All Things Must Pass'' sessions left Harrison to handle most of the project alone.<ref>Clayson, p. 289.</ref><ref>Harris, p. 72.</ref><ref name="Bergstrom/PM">John Bergstrom, [http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/135411-george-harrison-all-things-must-pass/ "George Harrison: All Things Must Pass"], [[PopMatters]], 14 January 2011 (retrieved 28 April 2012)</ref> After receiving a tape of early mixes of many of the songs, Spector eventually provided Harrison with written feedback and guidance.<ref name="Leng p 96" /> In contrast to the views of Lennon and McCartney the previous year,<ref>Huntley, pp 21, 52.</ref> Spector told Harrison: "This particular song is so good that any honest performance by you is acceptable as far as I'm concerned ..."<ref name="Leng p 96" /><ref name="Beatles Bible album">[http://www.beatlesbible.com/people/george-harrison/albums/all-things-must-pass/ George Harrison: All Things Must Pass (album)], The Beatles Bible (retrieved 3 August 2012).</ref> Spector expressed his disapproval of the horns at the start of the track,<ref name="Beatles Bible album" /> but, as authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter have noted, "clearer heads prevailed" and Price and [[Bobby Keys]]' contributions were retained.<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 431">Madinger & Easter, p. 431.</ref>

==Release and reception==
Almost two years after Harrison originally wrote the song, "All Things Must Pass" was released in November 1970, closing side three of the triple album in its original [[LP record|LP]] format.<ref>Castleman & Podrazik, p. 94.</ref>  The song received critical acclaim upon its release.  Acknowledging the extended recording history of the song, Madinger and Easter write that "[the] wait was well worth it" for this "fine" composition.<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 431" /> ''Beatles Forever'' author Nicholas Schaffner noted in 1977, with reference to Harrison's commercial and critical dominance over his former bandmates following the break-up: "The very fact that the Beatles had kept George's flowering talents so under wraps proved to be his secret weapon."<ref>Schaffner, p. 140.</ref> Schaffner named "All Things Must Pass" and "[[Beware of Darkness (song)|Beware of Darkness]]" as "[the] two most eloquent songs on the album, musically as well as lyrically" with "mysterious, seductive melodies, over which faded strings and horns hover like [[Blue Jay Way]] fog".<ref name="Schaffner p 142" /> The song's title was invariably seen as Harrison's statement on the demise of the band.<ref name="Inglis p 30" /><ref name="Huntley p 59">Huntley, p. 59.</ref><ref>Harris, p. 73.</ref>

On release, Ben Gerson of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described "All Things Must Pass" as "eloquently hopeful and resigned" while labelling the album "the music of mountain tops and vast horizons".<ref name="Gerson/RS">Ben Gerson, [http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/all-things-must-pass-19710121 "Reviews: George Harrison ''All Things Must Pass''"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 21 January 1971 (retrieved 3 July 2012).</ref> Writing for the same publication thirty years later, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] praised the song for its musical demonstration of <U+201C>the sweet satisfactions of faith<U+201D>.<ref>Anthony DeCurtis, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060814002619/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/georgeharrison/albums/album/205260/review/6067390/all_things_must_pass "George Harrison ''All Things Must Pass''"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 12 October 2000 (retrieved 28 April 2012).</ref> In his book on Harrison, subtitled ''A Spiritual Biography'', Gary Tillery refers to the song as "magisterial" and a "majestic title track" that "leaves even the shallowest listener contemplative".<ref>Tillery, pp 88, 153.</ref> To Simon Leng, "All Things Must Pass" is "a classic of Harrison's lyrical ambiguity, in essence a hopeful song, without sounding so", with a lyric that "approaches Bob Dylan standard".<ref name="Leng p 97">Leng, p. 97.</ref> Ian Inglis also praises the lyrics, writing: "The song contains some of Harrison's most insightful and pensive words. 'Daylight is good at arriving at the right time' is a fine example of his ... ability to position the profound within the commonplace."<ref name="Inglis p 30" />

Elliot Huntley rates "All Things Must Pass" as one of Harrison's "most beautiful" songs, "if not ''the'' very best", and the "centrepiece" of its parent album.<ref name="Huntley p 59" /> Huntley questions why it wasn't sequenced as the closing track to ''All Things Must Pass'' and adds: "In its sentiments, the song would actually have been an equally fitting conclusion to ''[[Abbey Road]]''."<ref name="Huntley p 59" />

On a triple album where "nearly every song is excellent", [[Allmusic]] picks "All Things Must Pass" as one of five standout tracks (or AMG Track Picks).<ref>Richie Unterberger, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-things-must-pass-mw0000194979 "George Harrison ''All Things Must Pass''"], [[Allmusic]] (retrieved 28 April 2012).</ref> Bruce Spizer rates the song as a "highlight" of Harrison's career,<ref name="Spizer p 225" /> while Leng goes further by declaring it "perhaps the greatest solo Beatle composition" of all.<ref name="Leng p 310">Leng, p. 310.</ref>

In his acclaimed book ''Revolution in the Head'', [[Ian MacDonald]] describes "All Things Must Pass" as "the wisest song never recorded by The Beatles".<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Performances and later releases==
Despite its standing as one of his best-known songs,<ref name="Leng p 96">Leng, p. 96.</ref> "All Things Must Pass" was not a track that Harrison ever played in concert, although it was included on a preliminary [[Set list|setlist]] for the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] shows.<ref>Olivia Harrison, p. 288.</ref> He twice performed the song live in front of TV cameras during the final years of his life, beginning with his appearance with [[Ravi Shankar]] on [[VH1]]'s ''Hard Rock Live'', filmed in New York on 14 May 1997.<ref name="Badman p 568">Badman, p. 568.</ref><ref name="Lavezzoli p 198">Lavezzoli, p. 198.</ref> The pair were on the show to promote their recent collaboration, the "quiet masterpiece" ''Chants of India'' album,<ref name="Lavezzoli p 198" /> but at host [[John Fugelsang]]'s urging, Harrison accepted an acoustic guitar and performed a brief rendition of "All Things Must Pass".<ref name="Badman pp 572-73">Badman, pp 572<U+2212>73.</ref><ref>Madinger & Easter, p. 488.</ref> 150 minutes of Harrison and Shankar's appearance was filmed, but only 22 minutes of footage was originally aired by VH1 on 24 July as ''George & Ravi <U+2212> Yin & Yang''.<ref name="Badman pp 572-73" />  Omitted from the broadcast but also performed by Harrison was the [[Traveling Wilburys]] tune "If You Belonged to Me" and, at the suggestion of Shankar's wife, Sukanya, "[[Any Road]]", a track subsequently released on his posthumous album ''[[Brainwashed (album)|Brainwashed]]''.<ref name="Badman pp 572-73" /><ref>Leng, p. 282.</ref> In late 2000, Harrison sang "All Things Must Pass" while sitting on [[Friar Park]]'s main lawn, a performance that was included in the [[press kit]] for the ''All Things Must Pass'' [[All Things Must Pass#2001|30th Anniversary reissue]] (which was delayed until January 2001 from the true anniversary date).<ref>Badman, pp 686, 689.</ref>

Omitted from the "cursory" selection of 1970<U+2212>75 tracks on ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'', the song was included on Harrison's 2009 career-spanning compilation ''[[Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison]]''.<ref>Inglis, pp 65, 128, 156.</ref>

In [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 2011 documentary ''[[George Harrison: Living in the Material World]]'', "All Things Must Pass" is the first song featured in the movie, played over footage of German air raids over Britain during [[World War II]].<ref>''[[George Harrison: Living in the Material World]]'' DVD, 2011 (directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese).</ref> In November that year, a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song, featuring just Harrison, Starr and bassist [[Klaus Voormann]], was included on the [[George Harrison: Living in the Material World#Deluxe Edition CD|deluxe edition CD]] accompanying the British DVD release of the film; this CD was subsequently issued worldwide in May 2012 as ''[[Early Takes: Volume 1]]''.<ref name="Early Takes/AMG">Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/early-takes-vol-1-mw0002332516 "George Harrison: ''Early Takes, Vol. 1''"], [[Allmusic]] (retrieved 15 September 2012).</ref>
