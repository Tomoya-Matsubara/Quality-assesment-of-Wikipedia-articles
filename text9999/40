'''''Hotel Chevalier''''' is a [[short film]] by director [[Wes Anderson]], released in 2007. Starring [[Jason Schwartzman]] and [[Natalie Portman]] as former lovers who reunite in a Paris hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a [[prologue]] to Anderson's 2007 feature ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]''. Shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew, the film was self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended it to be a stand-alone work. It was first shown at the [[Venice Film Festival]] premi<U+00E8>re of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and made its own debut later that month at [[Apple Store]]s in four American cities. The day after its premi<U+00E8>re, it was made available for free from the [[iTunes Store]] for one month, during which it was downloaded more than 500,000 times. ''Hotel Chevalier'' became one of the most-discussed short films of the year, with much popular attention drawn in particular by Portman's extended nude scene. The film garnered near-universal critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its richness, poignancy and careful construction, and comparing it favorably with ''The Darjeeling Limited''.

==Synopsis==
<!-- Prelude -->
The film opens on a hotel lobby, where the [[concierge]] answers a ringing phone from one of the rooms. Cut to a man ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) who is lying on a hotel bed in a yellow [[bathrobe]], watching ''[[Stalag 17]]'' and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from the concierge in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room, pausing to play the opening bars of the song "[[Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?]]" on his stereo system, and runs a bath.

<!-- Arrival -->
When the film cuts to the next scene, the man is again lying on the bed, but has changed out of the bathrobe into a grey suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before opening the door to a woman ([[Natalie Portman]]). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and presents the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it "wasn't actually that hard". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.

<!-- Conflict -->
Stepping back into the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly "what the fuck is going on?" He motions to her to join him on the bed and at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing conversation that he has been living in the hotel room for "more than a month", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have a mutually mistrustful exchange about not having slept with other people; when, undressing her further he notices bruises on her arm, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly and dismissively, but holds her when she embraces him. "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris.

<!-- D<U+00E9>nouement -->
In the next shot, the camera tracks across the room in slow motion, showing the woman perched against an armoire, the man approaching and covering her naked body with the yellow bathrobe, and the two moving towards the window. After they step out on the [[balcony]] together, the man draws a [[toothpick]] from his pocket and hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out at the scenery for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside. The camera pans and it becomes evident that the view is completely blocked by another wing of the hotel.

==Background and production==
[[File:H<U+00F4>tel Rapha<U+00EB>l, Paris 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A six storey building at the corner of a terrace lined in front by bare trees |The H<U+00F4>tel Rapha<U+00EB>l in Paris, which was used as the Hotel Chevalier of the film's title and where all of the scenes were shot]]
Director Wes Anderson first approached actors Schwartzman and Portman about ''Hotel Chevalier'' in 2005.<ref name=wsj/> Schwartzman and Anderson had previously worked on ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'', Anderson's cult second feature, while Portman was approached after the director obtained her email address from [[Scott Rudin]], producer of 2004's ''[[Closer (film)|Closer]]''.<ref name=latimes/> The actors appeared for free,<ref name=variety/> and Anderson financed the remainder of the production himself.<ref name=hindu/> It was filmed at the [[H<U+00F4>tel Rapha<U+00EB>l]] in Paris, which had previously been used as a setting for the films ''[[Love in Paris]]'' (1996) and ''[[Place Vend<U+00F4>me (film)|Place Vend<U+00F4>me]]'' (1998).<ref name=raphael/> It was shot by a crew of 15 using Panavision film stock and props from Anderson's apartment.<ref name=latimes/><ref name=hindu/> Filming took two and a half days, and editing (done on Anderson's computer) another week.<ref name=wsj/> Despite his use of a wardrobe from prestigious fashion designer [[Marc Jacobs]] and a handmade suitcase from [[Louis Vuitton]], the director described the production as "like making a student film".<ref name=latimes/>

Anderson initially intended it to be a stand-alone short film,<ref name=ifc/> but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time.<ref name=wsj/><ref name=ifc/> That film would begin production a year later as ''The Darjeeling Limited''.<ref name=wsj/> ''Chevalier'' takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in ''Darjeeling''.<ref name=latimes/> The dialogue exchanged by the characters at the end of ''Chevalier'' is recounted by Schwartzman's characters to his brothers at the close of the feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed.<ref name=corliss/> Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature.<ref name=wsj/> [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the studio that backed ''Darjeeling'', was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.<ref name=wsj/>{{-}}

''Hotel Chevalier'' was screened as part of the program at the world premi<U+00E8>re of ''The Darjeeling Limited'' at the 64th Annual [[Venice Film Festival]] on September 2, 2007.<ref name=corliss/> The short had its own premi<U+00E8>re at [[Apple Store]]s in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Santa Monica, California, on September 25.<ref name=wsj/><ref name=variety/> Anderson, Schwartzman and Portman appeared at the New York screening in [[SoHo]], after which they held a questions-and-answers session with the audience.<ref name=wsj/><ref name=variety/> The short was made available the following day as a free download from Apple's [[iTunes Store]].<ref name=wsj/> On September 28, it preceded the showing of the feature on the opening night of the 2007 [[New York Film Festival]].<ref name=nyff/> A press release posted before the premi<U+00E8>re "the brief coda to a doomed romance and the prologue to ''The Darjeeling Limited''".<ref name=slashfilm/>

The film was withdrawn from iTunes after having been available for download for a month.<ref name=nyt/> Although it had been dismissed by ''[[USA Today]]'' columnist Susan Wloszczyna before its iTunes release as an ''[[amuse-bouche]]'' that was "destined to be a mere footnote",<ref name=usatoday/> the short was downloaded nearly 500,000 times during its run, and received wide acclaim.<ref name=nyt/> The film drew some attention for co-star Natalie Portman's extended nude scene, and for her character's bruised body.<ref name=wsj/><ref name=breznican/><ref name=sequels/> Following its withdrawal from iTunes, the short was distributed in theaters as the prologue to the feature-length film.<ref name=nyt/> Although ''The New York Times'' reported in October 2007 that distributor [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] intended to promote ''Chevalier'' as a competitor for the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live Action Short Film]] of the Academy Awards,<ref name=nyt/> it was not among that year's nominations.<ref name=oscars/> It was included as an extra on the ''Darjeeling'' 2008 DVD release,<ref name=nyff/> and Anderson's screenplay for the short was published in the Winter 2007 issue of the literary magazine ''[[Zoetrope: All-Story]]''.<ref name=zoetrope/>

==Critical reception==
Apart from being one of the year's most discussed short films,<ref name=latimes/> ''Hotel Chevalier'' attracted considerable critical praise, with reviewers comparing it favorably to ''The Darjeeling Limited''. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Gary Susman described it as "an exquisite short story where we learn not much but exactly enough about these two characters", adding that "''Chevalier'' sees Anderson working in his customary jewel-box/dollhouse mode, but the form and length really suit each other here."<ref name=susman/> In ''[[New York Press]]'', Armand White judged the short "moving and genuinely contemporary", citing its "lost-girl poignancy".<ref name=nyp/> Portman's performance was praised by ''TIME'' reviewer [[Richard Corliss]], who declared her to be "a comic actress in fresh bloom" in the "beguiling vignette", and expressed his wish that her role in ''Darjeeling'' had been greater.<ref name=corliss/> The feature, he felt, lacked the "the feeling and wit of the short film".<ref name=corliss/> [[Salon.com]]'s Stephanie Zacharek concurred, stating that "the untold story of ''Hotel Chevalier'' is 10 times more interesting, and infinitely richer, than the one told outright in ''The Darjeeling Limited''", and calling the short "darn near perfect".<ref name=salon/> ''The Guardian'' columnist Danny Leigh contrasted the lukewarm reception of the feature among bloggers and critics with the "genuine ardour" that greeted the "perfectly measured narrative" of ''Chevalier''. He proposed that the constraints of the short-film format suited Anderson, whose trademark deadpan humor, idiosyncratic set designs and choice of soundtrack inclined to exhaust the viewers' patience in a feature-length work.<ref name=grauniad/> [[A. O. Scott]] of ''The New York Times'' hailed ''Chevalier'' as "a small gem" in comparison to the "overstuffed suitcase" of the feature, and wrote that "It is worth seeking out, not only because it fleshes out part of the story of the Whitman brothers but also because, on its own, it is an almost perfect distillation of Mr. Anderson<U+2019>s vexing and intriguing talents, enigmatic, affecting and wry."<ref name=nyff/>
