'''Penticton Regional Airport''' {{airport codes|YYF|CYYF}}, also known as '''Penticton Airport''', is a regional airport that is located {{convert|1.8|NM|lk=in}} southwest of [[Penticton]], a city in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], which is part of the [[Okanagan]] region. It is owned and operated by [[Transport Canada]], serving the [[Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen|South Okanagan]], [[Similkameen Country|Similkameen]] and [[West Kootenay]]. The facility maintains a restaurant, Sky High Diner, as well as medical facility, accommodation areas, and administrative buildings; food and snacks are also offered.

Initial examination for constructing an airport in Penticton began in 1937. Part of the proposed locations were owned by the [[Penticton Indian Band]], and was thus expropriated in 1949. Rights for temporary public use of the Penticton Regional Airport was conducted in 1945, which was promoted to a permanent airport license in 1956. It has a {{convert|6000|by|148|ft|abbr=on|0}} runway numbered 16<U+2013>34, garnering approximately 80,000&nbsp;passengers in 2011, with two accidents and incidents having occurred at it.

The airport has three scheduled flights every day<U+2014>with the exception of Sunday; two flights are provided that day<U+2014>to the [[Vancouver International Airport]] provided by [[Air Canada Express]], which is operated by [[Jazz (airline)|Jazz Air]]. There have been campaigns for airline [[WestJet]] to operate its services at the airport, as well as the expansion of services provided by Air Canada Express at the airport; David Allen is credited as airport manager. [[Kelowna International Airport]] has had an impact on traffic at this airport, with over 50&nbsp;percent of the local community choosing the former over the latter.
