{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[biology]] and [[ecology]], '''extinction''' is the end of an [[organism]] or of a group of organisms ([[taxon]]), normally a [[species]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the [[endling|last individual]] of the species, although the [[Functional extinction|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential [[Range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where a species presumed extinct abruptly "re-appears" (typically in the [[fossil|fossil record]]) after a period of apparent absence.

A species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species), or other reasons.

Pinpointing the extinction (or [[pseudoextinction]]) of a species requires a [[Theory of species|clear definition of that species]]. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the [[punctuated equilibrium]] hypothesis of [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].<ref>See: Niles Eldredge, ''Time Frames: Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated Equilibria'', 1986, Heinemann ISBN 0-434-22610-6</ref>

In [[ecology]], ''extinction'' is often used informally to refer to [[local extinction]], in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but may still exist elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; [[wolf reintroduction]] is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed [[Extant taxon|extant]]. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as [[threatened]] or [[endangered species]].

Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the [[conservation status]] [[extinct in the wild|"extinct in the wild" (EW)]]. Species listed under this status by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in [[zoo]]s or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild.<ref name="Maas">Maas, Peter. "[http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/wilduk.htm Extinct in the Wild" ''The Extinction Website''. URL accessed January 26 2007.]</ref> When possible, modern [[zoology|zoological]] institutions try to maintain a [[viable population]] for species preservation and possible future [[reintroduction]] to the wild, through use of carefully planned [[breeding program]]s.

The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called "chains of extinction".<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf |title=Deleting species from model food webs |accessdate=2007-02-15 |format=PDF |work= |author=Quince, C. et al. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060925092540/http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-09-25}}</ref> This is especially common with extinction of [[keystone species]].

=== Pseudoextinction ===
{{Main|Pseudoextinction}}

Descendants may or may not exist for extinct species. Daughter species that evolve from a parent species carry on most of the parent species' [[genotype|genetic information]], and even though the parent species may become extinct, the daughter species lives on. Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction. In other cases, species have produced no new variants, or none that are able to survive the parent species' extinction.

Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern [[horse]], is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', including [[zebra]] and [[donkey]]. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether ''Hyracotherium'' [[Evolution of the horse|evolved into more modern horse species]] or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.

===Lazarus taxa===
{{Main|Lazarus taxa}}
The [[coelacanth]], a fish related to [[lungfish]] and [[tetrapod]]s, was considered to have been extinct since the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]] until 1938 when a specimen was found, off the [[Chalumna River]] (now Tyolomnqa) on the east coast of South Africa.<ref name="dinofish">[http://www.dinofish.com/discoa.htm "Discovery" of the Coelacanth]</ref> Museum curator [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]] discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler, Captain Hendrick Goosen, on December 23, 1938.<ref name="dinofish" /> A local chemistry professor, [[James Leonard Brierley Smith|JLB Smith]], confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable: "MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED".<ref name="dinofish" />

Far more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine, or [[Tasmanian tiger]] (''Thylacinus cynocephalus''), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the [[Honsh<U+016B> wolf|Japanese wolf]] (''Canis lupus hodophilax''), last sighted over 100 years ago; the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]] (''Campephilus principalis''), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the [[slender-billed curlew]] (''Numenius tenuirostris''), not seen since 2007.<ref>[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2013/02/21/4-extinct-species-hope-rediscover/ 4 Extinct species that people still hope to rediscover - John R.

== Causes ==
[[File:Ectopistes migratoriusMCN2P28CA.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[passenger pigeon]], one of hundreds of species of [[List of extinct birds|extinct birds]], was hunted to extinction over the course of a few decades.]]

As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average life-span of a species is 10 million years{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}, although this varies widely between taxa.
There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. "Just as each species is unique", write Beverly and [[Stephen C. Stearns]], "so is each extinction&nbsp;... the causes for each are varied<U+2014>some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple".<ref name="Stearns">{{cite book | last = Stearns | first = Beverly Peterson and Stephen C. | title = Watching, from the Edge of Extinction | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-300-08469-2 | pages=x |chapter=Preface }}</ref> Most simply, any species that cannot [[Survival skills|survive]] and [[reproduction|reproduce]] in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when [[toxic]] [[pollution]] renders its entire [[habitat]] unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].

Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on [[nature and nurture]].<ref name="Raup" /> The question of whether more extinctions in the [[fossil]] record have been caused by [[evolution]] or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of ''Modeling Extinction'', argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions.<ref name="Newman" /> By contrast, [[conservation biology]] uses the [[extinction vortex]] model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about [[human extinction]] have been raised, for example in Sir [[Martin Rees]]' 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', those concerns lie with the effects of [[climate change]] or [[technology|technological]] disaster.<ref name='Vinn2014'>{{cite journal

Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of [[conservation movement|conservation]] programs.<ref name="MSNBC" /> Humans can cause extinction of a species through [[overharvesting]], [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]], introduction of [[invasive species]] (such as new [[predator]]s and food [[competitors]]), overhunting, and other influences. Explosive, unsustainable human [[population growth]] is an essential cause of the extinction crisis.<ref>"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=sixth-extinction Population Bomb Author's Fix For Next Extinction: Educate Women]". ''Scientific American''. August 12, 2008.</ref> According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), 784 extinctions have been recorded since the year 1500, the arbitrary date selected to define "recent" extinctions, up to the year 2004; with many more likely to have gone unnoticed. Several species have also been listed as extinct since 2004.<ref name="IUCNno">{{cite web | publisher = [[World Conservation Union]] | url = http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/red_list_2004/GSAexecsumm_EN.htm | title = 2004 Red List | work = IUCN Red List of Threatened Species | accessdate = September 20, 2006 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080212161231/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/red_list_2004/GSAexecsumm_EN.htm | archivedate = 12 February 2008}}</ref>

=== Genetics and demographic phenomena ===
{{See also|Extinction vortex|Genetic erosion}}
[[Population genetics]] and demographic phenomena affect the evolution, and therefore the risk of extinction, of species. Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of [[genus]] extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as [[#Mass extinctions|mass extinction]] arises.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Payne, J.L. & S. Finnegan | year=2007 | title=The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction | journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.]] | volume=104 | issue=25 | pages=10506<U+2013>11 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0701257104 | pmid=17563357| pmc=1890565}}</ref>

[[Natural selection]] acts to propagate beneficial genetic traits and eliminate weaknesses. But a deleterious mutation can also be spread throughout a population through [[genetic drift]].

Because traits are selected and not genes, the relationship between genetic diversity and extinction risk can be complex: factors such as [[balancing selection]], [[cryptic genetic variation]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], and [[degeneracy (biology)|degeneracy]] all potentially play roles.

A diverse or deep [[gene pool]] gives a population a higher chance of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in [[genetic diversity]] can increase the chances of extinction of a species. [[Population bottleneck]]s can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make [[inbreeding]] more frequent. The [[founder effect]] can cause rapid, individual-based speciation and is the most dramatic example of a population bottleneck.

The [[gene pool]] of a [[species]] or a [[population]] is the variety of genetic information in its living members. A large gene pool (extensive [[genetic diversity]]) is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense [[selection]]. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see [[inbreeding]] and [[population bottlenecks]]) reduces the range of adaptions possible.<ref>

=== Habitat degradation ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] may alter the [[fitness landscape]] to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming [[toxicity|toxic]], or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.

Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through [[contamination]] or [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.

Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of [[tropical rainforest]]s and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;<ref name="Wilson" /> elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a [[fern]] that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by [[bottom trawling]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Clover |first=Charles |year=2004 |title=The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-189780-7 }}</ref>

Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. [[Global warming]] has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including [[water]] and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.

[[File:Bufo periglenes2.jpg|thumb|The [[golden toad]] was last seen on May 15, 1989. [[Decline in amphibian populations]] is ongoing worldwide.]]

=== Predation, competition, and disease ===
In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by [[introduced species|transporting]] [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. [[livestock]] released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. [[rat]]s escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an [[Invasive species|invasive alien species]] does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing [[pathogen]]s or [[parasite]]s that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the [[megafauna]] in areas such as [[Australia]] (40,000 years before present), [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (12,000 years before present), [[Madagascar]], [[Hawaii]] (300-1000 CE), and [[New Zealand]] (1300-1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.<ref name="Lee">Lee, Anita.

=== Coextinction ===
{{Main|Coextinction}}
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The large [[Haast's eagle]] and [[moa]] from [[New Zealand]]]]

Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of [[parasitism|parasitic]] insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its [[pollinator]], or to [[predator]]s in a [[food chain]] who lose their prey. "Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems&nbsp;... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one".<ref name="Koh">Koh, Lian Pih. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Vol 305, Issue 5690, 1632<U+2013>1634, 10 September 2004.</ref>  Coextinction is especially common when a [[keystone species]] goes extinct.
Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the [[trophic level]]s. Such effects are most severe in [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the [[Haast's eagle]] and the [[moa]]: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Dunn | first = Robert |author2=Nyeema Harris|author3=Robert Colwell|author4=Lian Pin Koh|author5=Navjot Sodhi | title = Proceedings of the Royal Society | work = The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists? | publisher = [[The Royal Society]] | year = 2009 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1670/3037.short | accessdate = April 20, 2011}}</ref>

== Mass extinctions ==
{{Main|Extinction event}}
{{annotated image/Extinction|float=right}}
There have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth, and four in the last 3.5 billion years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time. A massive eruptive event is considered to be one likely cause of the "[[Permian<U+2013>Triassic extinction event]]" about 250 million years ago,<ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction">{{ cite journal | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf | author=Sahney, S. and Benton, M.J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759<U+2013>65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}</ref> which is estimated to have killed 90% of species then existing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Benton M J|year=2005|title=When Life Nearly Died: The Greatest Mass Extinction of All Time|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28573-2}}</ref> There is also evidence to suggest that this event was preceded by another mass extinction, known as [[Olson's Extinction]].<ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction" /> The [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene extinction event]] (K-Pg) occurred 66 million years ago, at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, and is best known for having wiped out non-avian [[dinosaur]]s, among many other species.

=== Modern extinctions ===
{{Main|Holocene extinction}}
{{Further|Deforestation}}

According to a 1998 survey of 400 biologists conducted by [[New York]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused extinction,<ref name="AMNH">[[American Museum of Natural History]]. "[http://www.well.com/~davidu/amnh.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis - Scientific Experts Believe We are in the Midst of the Fastest Mass Extinction in Earth's History]". Retrieved September 20, 2006.</ref> known as the [[Holocene extinction]]. In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). Biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] estimated <ref name="Wilson" /> in 2002 that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue, one-half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in 100 years.<ref name="Wilson2">{{cite interview | last= Wilson | first= E.

Amphibians, for example, are disappearing at as much as 45,000 times their extinction rate at K-Pg.<ref>[[McCallum, Malcolm L.]] 2007. Amphibian decline or extinction?

== History of scientific understanding ==
[[File:Dilophosaurus.png|thumb|''[[Dilophosaurus]]'', one of the many extinct dinosaur genera. The cause of the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene extinction event]] is a subject of much debate amongst researchers.]]

When it was first described in the 1750s, the idea of extinction was threatening to those who held a belief in the [[great chain of being]], a [[theology|theological]] position that did not allow for "missing links".<ref name="Viney" />

The possibility of extinction was not widely accepted before the 1800s.<ref name="Viney">Viney, Mike.

This discovery was critical for the spread of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]],<ref name="Watson2">Watson, p.16</ref> and led to the first book publicizing the idea of evolution <ref name="Chambers">[[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], 1844, ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', 1994 reprint: [[University of Chicago Press]] ISBN 0-226-10073-1</ref> though Cuvier himself strongly opposed the theories of evolution advanced by [[Lamarck]] and others.

== Human attitudes and interests ==
Extinction is an important research topic in the field of [[zoology]], and [[biology]] in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the [[WWF (conservation organization)|Worldwide Fund for Nature]], have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. [[Government]]s have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and [[pollution]]. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous [[virus]]es, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested.  Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were "undesirable", or to push for other human agendas.  One example was the near extinction of the [[American bison]], which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], many of whom relied on the bison for food.<ref name="Kotzman">{{cite book|author=C. Cormack Gates, Curtis H. Freese, Peter J.P. Gogan, Mandy Kotzman|title=American bison: status survey and conservation guidelines 2010|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=koUrGx-i2ucC&pg=PR15|accessdate=6 November 2011|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-2-8317-1149-2|page=15}}</ref>

Biologist Bruce Walsh of the [[University of Arizona]] states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species; genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and [[ethics]];<ref name="Walsh" /> and today the scientific community "stress[es] the importance" of maintaining biodiversity.<ref name="Walsh">Walsh, Bruce.

In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' can be devastating to wildlife (for example, [[DDT]]).<ref name="INCHEM">International Programme on Chemical Safety (1989).

Retrieved September 20, 2006.</ref> [[Biogeography|Biogeographer]] [[Jared Diamond]] notes that while [[big business]] may label environmental concerns as "exaggerated", and often cause "devastating damage", some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices, and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by [[national park]]s.<ref name="DiamondCollapse">{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = Collapse | publisher = Penguin | year = 2005| isbn = 0-670-03337-5 | pages=15<U+2013>17 |chapter=A Tale of Two Farms }}</ref>

Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to [[ecotourism]],<ref name="Drewry">Drewry, Rachel. "[http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit51/orang.htm Ecotourism: Can it save the orangutans?]" ''Inside Indonesia''. Retrieved January 26, 2007.</ref> and can enact laws with severe punishment against the trade in native species in an effort to prevent extinction in the wild. [[Nature preserve]]s are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion. The 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] has resulted in international [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] programmes, which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation. Advocacy groups, such as The Wildlands Project<ref name="WildlandsProject">[http://www.wild-earth.org/cms/page1090.cfm The Wildlands Project]. Retrieved January 26, 2007.</ref> and the Alliance for Zero Extinctions,<ref>[http://www.zeroextinction.org/ Alliance for Zero Extinctions]. Retrieved January 26, 2007.</ref> work to educate the public and pressure governments into action.

People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction [[risk]]s. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with [[human overpopulation]] in tropical [[developing country|developing countries]], there has been enormous pressure on forests due to [[subsistence agriculture]], including [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.<ref>{{Cite book | first1= Anne | last1= Ehrlich | title = Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species | publisher= Random House, New York | year= 1981 | isbn= 0-394-51312-6}}</ref>

The American philosopher [[Michael Levin]] argues, "The very fact that a species is near extinction implies that its final demise will have negligible impact."<ref>{{Cite journal|publisher=The Free Market|date=November 1997|volume=15|issue=11|title=Animals and the Market|url=https://mises.org/freemarket_detail.aspx?control=111|author=Levin, Michael|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

====Proposed====

Biologist [[Olivia Judson]] has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain species. In a September 25, 2003 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, she advocated "[[genocide|specicide]]" of thirty [[mosquito]] species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create [[recessive]] "[[Gene knockout|knockout genes]]".<ref name="Judson"/> She says that the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[malaria]]) and ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[dengue fever]], [[yellow fever]], [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]], and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the [[genetic diversity]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Culicidae]] by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the [[ecosystem]]: "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species&nbsp;<U+2014> but different need not mean worse." In addition, anti-malarial and [[Mosquito#Control|mosquito control programs]] offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in [[developing nation]]s who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: "We should consider the ultimate swatting."<ref name="Judson">{{cite news | last = Judson | first = Olivia | title = A Bug's Death | work = [[New York Times]] | date = September 25, 2003 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9805E5DF143DF936A1575AC0A9659C8B63&n=Top%2fNews%2fScience%2fTopics%2fMosquitoes | accessdate = 2006-07-30 }}</ref>

=== Cloning ===
{{Main|De-extinction}}
Some, such as Harvard geneticist [[George M. Church]] believe that ongoing technological advances will let us "bring back to life" an extinct species by [[Cloning#Cloning extinct and endangered species|cloning]], using [[DNA]] from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the [[mammoth]], the [[thylacine]], and the [[Pyrenean ibex]]. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though [[bioethics|bioethical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] objections have been raised,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/24/news/mn-4250/2 |title= Cloned Goat Would Revive Extinct Line |author= A. Zitner |date= 2000-12-24 |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]   |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> the cloning of extinct creatures seems theoretically possible.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/science/20mammoth.html?_r=1 |title= Regenerating a Mammoth for $10 Million |author= Nicholas wade |date= 2008-11-19  |accessdate=2010-05-17 | work=The New York Times}} ''The cell could be converted into an embryo and brought to term by an elephant, a project he estimated would cost some $10 million. "This is something that could work, though it will be tedious and expensive," ''</ref>

In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (''C. p. pyrenaica''). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and [[mountain goat]]-[[Goat|domestic goat]] hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cloned-goat-dies-after-attempt-to-bring-species-back-from-extinction-1522974.html |title= Cloned goat dies after attempt to bring species back from extinction |author= Steve Connor |date= 2009-02-02 |work= [[The Independent]]   |accessdate=2010-05-17 | location=London}}</ref> In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Jan 2009}}</ref>

In fiction, the concept of cloning extinct species is thought to have been first popularized by the successful 1990 Michael Crichton novel and subsequent film ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', though the idea may have been first used in [[John Brosnan]]'s 1984 novel ''[[Carnosaur (novel)|Carnosaur]]'', then in [[F. Paul Wilson]]'s 1989 novel ''Dydeetown World'', and later in [[Piers Anthony]]'s 1990 novel ''Balook'', which featured the resurrection of a ''[[Baluchitherium]]'', though [[Pat Mills]]' [[Judge Dredd]] story "[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]" <U+2013> in which the titular lawman battles tyrannosaurs who live wild in post-apocalyptic America after they escape from the theme park where they have been cloned to be used as attractions - precedes these examples, published as it was in 1978.
