'''Krallice''' is an experimental black metal band formed by New York City musicians [[Colin Marston]], [[Mick Barr]] and Lev Weinstein.

==History==
Krallice was first mentioned by Marston in February 2008 as a collaboration between himself and Mick Barr.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Mega update! Tours! Booking Agent! Dysrhythmia! Krallice! | work =MySpace.com/BeholdTheArtcopus | publisher =MySpace | date = February 12, 2008 | url =http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=10284794&blogId=357362122 | accessdate = June 6, 2010}}</ref>  Marston, a member of the instrumental metal groups [[Behold... The Arctopus]] and [[Dysrhythmia (band)|Dysrhythmia]], and Barr, a member of tech metal duo [[Orthrelm]], performed together on a [[Orthrelm / Behold... The Arctopus|split]] in 2006, and continued a working relationship from which Krallice developed.  Lev Weinstein had joined sometime after and the trio recorded and released their [[Krallice (album)|eponymous debut album]] on [[Canada|Canadian]] [[independent record label]] [[Profound Lore Records|Profound Lore]] in 2008 to high critical praise.<ref>{{cite web | last = Coup | first = Chad | title = Krallice - Krallice | work =GrindingTheApparatus.com | publisher = The Apparatus | date = December 3, 2008 | url = http://grindingtheapparatus.net/content/view/489/71/ | accessdate = September 1, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Lee | first = Cosmo | title = Krallice: Krallice | work =Pitchfork.com | publisher = Pitchfork Media Inc.| date = October 8, 2008 | url = http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12250-krallice/ | accessdate = September 1, 2009}}</ref>

Nick McMaster was brought into to perform live bass.  McMaster had been featured as an additional vocalist on the debut album, but joined the band full time shortly after its release (the bass on the first album was performed by both Marston and Barr).<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = KRALLICE - Complete Debut Album | work =ProfoundLoreRecords.com | publisher = Profound Lore Records | year = 2008 | url = http://www.profoundlorerecords.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=408&Itemid=2 | accessdate = September 1, 2009}}</ref>  McMaster also created some of the artwork for their second album ''[[Dimensional Bleedthrough]]'', which was released in November 2009 again on Profound Lore.

==Musical style==
Krallice plays a form of [[progressive metal|progressive]] [[black metal]] somewhat similar in style to that of [[Weakling]] and [[Wolves in the Throne Room]].  The band's music features dense multi-tracked guitars often performing [[tremolo]] picked lines described as fast and precise.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first =| title =Krallice | Webster Hall Studio, NYC | 5.26.09 | work =BloodAndShutter.com | publisher =Blood and Shutter | date = May 27, 2009 | url =http://bloodandshutter.com/photos/krallice-webster-hall-studio-nyc-52709 | accessdate = June 6, 2010}}</ref>  It is also described as a throwback to the early days of [[Burzum]], [[Gorgoroth]], and [[Ulver]].<ref>{{cite web | last = True | first = Chris | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Krallice | work =[[Allmusic|AllMusic.com]] | publisher = Rovi Corporation | date = | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1070590|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = September 1, 2009 }}</ref>

Marston records the band in his own studio ''Menegroth: The Thousand Caves''.  Initially the band intended to use a [[lo-fi]] approach similar to much earlier [[black metal]], however, the dense sonorities proved too difficult to control.  The result was a more "pure and ambient" sound as opposed to the buzzy quality found on older black metal.<ref>{{cite web | last = Stosuy | first =Brandon | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Show No Mercy: Interview with Mick Barr and Colin Marston | work = | publisher = Pitchfork | date = August 6, 2008 | url =http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/7520-show-no-mercy/ | accessdate = September 1, 2009}}</ref>
