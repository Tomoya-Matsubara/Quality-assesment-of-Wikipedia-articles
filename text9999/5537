The '''Duchy of Brunswick State Railway''' (''Herzoglich Braunschweigische Staatseisenbahn'') was the first state railway in [[Germany]]. Its first [[railway line]] ([[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]-[[Wolfenb<U+00FC>ttel]]) was opened on [[1 December]] [[1838]]. 

The construction of the line was mainly the work of the businessman, [[Philipp-August von Amsberg]]. He investigated the  transportation links from Brunswick to the [[Hanseatic cities]] of [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]] and [[L<U+00FC>beck]] and recognised that the transportation of wood and mining products from the [[Harz]] to the maritime harbours was not competitive. Conversely products from the seaboard harbours tended to be transported on the [[Elbe]] to [[Magdeburg]] and not to Brunswick. In 1824 he proposed, in a memorandum, a plan to build railway links from Brunswick to Hamburg and Bremen. These ideas were publicised in 1832.

In 1835 Amsberg looked into the plan to build a railway from Brunswick via [[Helmstedt]] to Magdeburg. This plan was given up in favour of a route via [[Oschersleben (Bode)]] in order to form a junction there to the Magdeburg - [[Halberstadt]] line.

At the instigation of Amsberg, the Brunswick state ministry made the decision to build a railway link from Brunswick via  [[Wolfenb<U+00FC>ttel]] to [[Bad Harzburg]] (the [[Brunswick<U+2013>Bad Harzburg railway]]) and thereby pre-empt the intent of the Hanoverian government to build a railway via Halberstadt to Magdeburg bypassing Brunswick to the south.

On 1 August 1837 construction began on the first section from Brunswick in a southerly direction towards Wolfenb<U+00FC>ttel and on 1 December 1838 the route was opened to traffic, making it the first German state railway and the fourth railway line to be built in the [[German Confederation]]. On 31 October 1841 the line to Harzburg was ready. The ramp between [[Vienenburg]] and Harzburg was initially worked by horses, but by 1843 steam haulage had been introduced here too using three [[locomotives]] from [[England]]. These engines were the first six-coupled locomotives in Germany.

In [[1850]], Philipp-August von Amsberg became head of the Duchy's Railway and Postal Division in Brunswick.

==Development of the network ==
*On [[10 July]] [[1843]] the Wolfenb<U+00FC>ttel<U+2013>Oschersleben route via Jerxheim was opened with a junction to the [[Magdeburg-Halberstadt railway]] and beyond to [[Berlin]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Blankenburg (Harz)|Blankenburg]].
* The route to [[Peine]] was opened on [[19 May]] [[1844]] (with a junction to the [[Royal Hanovarian State Railways]]).
* The [[Brunswick Southern Railway]] from [[B<U+00F6>r<U+00DF>um]] to [[Kreiensen]] was built in 1853 and opened in [[1856]].
* In 1858 the junction to the Helmstedt brown coal district was effected by the [[Helmstedt]]<U+2013>[[Jerxheim]] line,
* then the Vienenburg line to [[Goslar]] (opened in [[1866]] by the Hanoverian State Railway, but first operated by the Brunswick Railway).
* Wit the Kreiensen<U+2013>[[Holzminden]]<U+2013>[[H<U+00F6>xter]]<U+2013>[[Godelheim]] link to the [[Altenbeken<U+2013>Kreiensen railway|Altenbeken<U+2013>H<U+00F6>xter line]] of the [[Royal Westphalian Railway Company]] in October 1865 a through route was established via [[Altenbeken]] to the [[Ruhrgebiet|Rhine-Westphalian industrial region]]. 
* With the Jerxheim<U+2013>B<U+00F6>r<U+00DF>um link a long-distance, through route was established in [[1868]] between Magdeburg and the [[Ruhrgebiet]] bypassing Hanover and Brunswick, which was of particular interest to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].

==Takeover by the state of Prussia==
In 1869 Amsberg entered into the sale of the Brunswick state railway to Prussia with a heavy heart. The [[Duchy of Brunswick]] had amassed heavy debts at that time, that had arisen mainly due to the expansion of the railway and was entirely surrounded by the [[Prussian state railways]].

In March 1870, with effect from 1 January 1869, the Brunswick State Railways were transferred to a private railway concern, the [[Brunswick Railway Company]]. Amsberg did not survive to see the Prussian state buy up the shares in this company between 1879 and 1882, operate it under the [[Prussian state railways]] and subordinate it in [[1886]] to the royal railway division (''Eisenbahndirektion'') of Magdeburg.
