==History and background==
The United Nations Foundation<U+2019>s original purpose was to help unite nations and individuals behind the goals of the United Nations, and to make sure that the United States honors its commitments to the United Nations. Since its beginning, the United Nations Foundation and the [[Better World Campaign]] have provided grants in order to support the UN goals worldwide. The United Nations Foundation serves as the largest source of private funding to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite document|title=A Key Partner for Innovative Alliances <U+2013> The United Nations Foundation|date=2001|authors=Ted Turner and Timothy Wirth|publisher=UN Chronicle no.4}}</ref> In conjunction with the UN, they established the UN Fund for International Partnerships in order to serve as the UN counterpart to the Foundation<ref>{{cite|title=UNFIP: Partnerships Beyond Borders|date=2005|publisher=UN Chronicle v.41|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> . 

The United Nations Foundation has collected more than $125 million from other places, including from other foundations, corporations, [[NGOs]], and individuals. The Foundation also works with its UN partners in order to provide policy recommendations and project proposals. The missions of the Foundation and its partner, the Better World Campaign have also helped raise awareness of issues amongst global policy makers and the public. <ref>{{cite document|title=A Key Partner for Innovative Alliances <U+2013> The United Nations Foundation|date=2001|authors=Ted Turner and Timothy Wirth|publisher=UN Chronicle no.4}}</ref> The UN Foundation's current budgetary breakdown is $82.6 million going to program services, $6.9 million to fundraising, and $5.6 million going to management and overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/about-unf/financial-information|title=United Nations Foundation: Financial Information|date=2010|publisher=United Nations Foundation|accessdate=2011-04-24}}</ref> 

===Turner's choice of the UN for his donation===
[[Ted Turner]], who in 1996 was worth $3.2 billion due to his Time Warner enterprise, decided to make a $1 billion contribution to the UN because he had previously donated to similar causes, and felt strongly about the issues the UN were participating in. Before donating to the UN, Turner was a proponent for the protection of the environment, especially in combating global warming. Turner believed that his $100 million per year donation over the course of 10 years would make a difference in the direction of the [[United Nations]], and that he could use this donation to encourage other wealthy members of society to make financial contributions to the work of the UN. <ref>{{cite|title=Why Ted gave it away|date=9/29/97|authors=Howard Fineman and Carol Bogert|publisher=Newsweek v.130|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref>

===Background of Foundation's involvement with the UN===
When the UN Foundation started, it desired to assist the UN with a wide variety of issues, and bring attention to particular modern problems. The Foundation wished to help then Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] with the problem of reforming the UN. They also desired to bolster UN programs that were viewed as successful, including children's health, population control, environment issues, and land-mines. One of their priorities was also to work with the private sector to raise more money for the UN. They also had the intention of raising awareness of the UN and its programs amongst the American population. They have had a close relationship with the UN and its leadership from the beginning in order to set goals and provide funding for particular programs.<ref>{{cite|title=Spending Ted's money|date=12/1/97|publisher=Newsweek v.130|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref>

==Specific campaigns==
===Children's health===
One of the global issues that the UN Foundation focuses on is children's health. They work closely with private sector partners and UN agencies in order to address a variety of children's health issues. One of their biggest campaigns is working to reduce the number of deaths from [[measles]]. The Measles Initiative, as it called, is a partnership between the UN Foundation, the [[American Red Cross]], [[UNICEF]], the [[Centers for Disease Control]], and the [[World Health Organization]] in order to provide measles vaccinations  to children across the African continent. During the first year of this campaign, vaccines were distributed across 8 African countries, which vaccinated over 21 million children. This campaign not only focuses on vaccinating children, but also putting into place health infrastructure, and promoting better access to health-care across the continent.<ref>{{cite|title=Where a child dies each minute|date=June-August 2002|author=Phyllis A. Cuttino|publisher=UN Chronicle v.39.2|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> The UN Foundation also runs the Nothing But Nets Campaign, which is targeted at reducing [[malaria]] across the African continent. This campaign originally started when ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer Patrick Reilley published an article asking his readers to donate money to a campaign to buy mosquito nets for those in [[Africa]] suffering from malaria. With support from the UN Foundation, Reilley's project got off the ground, and has to-date provided over 3.5 million nets across Africa. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/patrick-reilly/malaria-and-nothing-but-n_b_853462.html|title=Nothing But Nets: A Global Movement to Fight Malaria|date=4/25/11|author=Patrick Reilley|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>

===Youth campaigns===
The United Nations Foundation recently announced a new Global Entrepreneurs Council which is made up of 10 emerging entrepreneurs under the age of 40 who will work with the UN to address global issues in a 21st century mindset. They include the marketing director of [[Facebook]], Randi Zuckerberg, the VP of Consumer Products at [[Google]], Marissa Mayer, and the publisher of ''[[Variety Magazine]]'', Brian Gott, amongst others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iewy.com/24394-un-foundation-announces-inaugural-class-of-global-entrepreneurs-council.html|title=UN Foundation Announces Inaugural Class of Global Entrepreneurs Council|date=April 24, 2011|author=Julian Flemming|accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>

===Climate & energy===
One of the largest global issues that the UN Foundation is involved in is climate change and energy. The UN Foundation focuses on sustainable energy, as well as climate change and the conservation of biodiversity. The Foundation's Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Program works with partners in the NGO sector, the UN, governments, and private corporations to come up with solutions and provide funding to programs related to this issue. One of their campaigns in relation to climate change and energy is to provide communities around the world with renewable energy technologies in order to promote sustainability globally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uneptie.org/energy/activities/islp/sponsors.htm|title=UNEP DTIE Energy Branch: Activities|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref>

===Haiti===
The Foundation is working in conjunction with the music group [[Linkin Park]] in order to raise money and install solar-powered lights withing displacement camps in [[Haiti]]. Linkin Park's Music for Relief charity is working closely with the Foundation on funding this project. By providing lights in these camps, they are in turn reducing the amount of violence and rape directed at women and children, which often occurs at night when there is minimal visibility within these camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1662279/linkin-park-haiti-recovery-efforts.jhtml|title=Linkin Park Detail Ongoing Recovery Efforts in Haiti|date=4/19/11|author=James Montgomery|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>

===UN advocacy in the U.S.===
The UN Foundation has an extremely close relationship with the UN, as it provides it with large amounts of money to fund programs. The UN Foundation, through its sponsorship and funding of the [[Better World Campaign]], works to better the relationship between the [[United States]] and the United Nations.  The [[Better World Campaign]] advocates at Congress in order to ensure that the US fulfills its financial obligations to the United Nations, and that it repays its debt. The Better World Campaign allows the Foundation to have a direct channel to the US legislative and administrative powers.<ref>{{cite|title=The Better World Campaign|date=December 2001-February 2002|author=Phyllis Cuttino|publisher=UN Chronicle v.38.4|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref>
