'''Herne Hill railway station''' is a passenger [[railway station]] in [[Herne Hill]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], [[South London]], England, on the boundary between [[London fare zones]] 2 and 3. Direct [[Rail transport|rail services]] are provided by [[First Capital Connect]] to [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars]], [[Farringdon station|Farringdon]], [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras International]] and [[Luton Airport Parkway railway station|Luton Airport]] on the [[Thameslink]] route and by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] to [[London Victoria station|London Victoria]] and [[Orpington railway station|Orpington]] on the [[Chatham Main Line]]. Trains to Victoria call at [[Brixton railway station|Brixton]], where passengers can transfer to the [[London Underground]].

The station building on [[Railton Road]] was opened in 1862 by the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]]. Initially passengers could travel only to Victoria, but by 1869 direct services were available to the [[City of London]], [[King's Cross Thameslink railway station|King's Cross]], [[Kingston railway station (London)|Kingston]] (via [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]]) and [[Kent]], including express trains to [[List of railway stations in Dover#Former stations|Dover Harbour]] for [[boat train|boat trains]] to continental Europe. The arrival of the railways transformed Herne Hill from a wealthy suburb with large residential estates into a densely populated urban area.

The future pattern of passenger services is uncertain. [[Network Rail]] has recommended terminating all northbound First Capital Connect services from Herne Hill at Blackfriars from 2018; passengers for other central London stations on the Thameslink route would then have to change trains at Blackfriars.

==History==
The area now known as Herne Hill had been a rural part of the Manor of Milkwell since the 13th century.<ref>[[#Survey_1956|Survey of London 1956]], pp. 141<U+2013>145.</ref> Two [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the [[River Effra]] met at the undeveloped site of the future station;<ref name="LostRivers">{{cite book |last=Talling |first=Paul |title=London's Lost Rivers |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=1-84794-597-X |page=54 |location =London |ref=harv }}</ref> it was known as Island Green until the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=James |title=The story of Norwood |year=1973 |publisher=London Borough of Lambeth |isbn=0-9501893-3-2 |page=10 |location =London |ref=harv }}</ref>

===Construction===
In the late 1850s, the [[East Kent Railway]] had ambitions to run passenger trains between Kent and London, but it did not own any railway lines in inner London. It reached an agreement with the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&SCR) in 1858 to use its [[West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway|West End and Crystal Palace line]] to access [[Battersea]] and (from 1860) [[London Victoria station|Victoria]]. This arrangement incurred costly access fees, but it was necessary until the company obtained Parliamentary authority to build in London.<ref>[[#Kidner_1968|Kidner 1968]], p. 327.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Turner| first= John Howard | year=1978 | title= The London Brighton and South Coast Railway 2 Establishment and Growth | publisher= B.T Batsford | location = London |isbn=0-7134-1198-8 |page=121 }}</ref>

In August 1860, the Metropolitan Extensions Act granted the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR; the successor to the East Kent company) the right to build two inner London lines: one from [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]] to Victoria via Herne Hill; and another, a {{convert|4.5|mi|km|1|lk=in|abbr=on}} extension known as the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway#Second London line|City Branch]], from Herne Hill to [[Farringdon station|Farringdon]].<ref>[[#White_1961|White 1961]], p. 36.</ref> Herne Hill station and the first line section to be completed, from Victoria to Herne Hill via [[Stewarts Lane]] and {{Stnlnk|Brixton}}, opened on 25 August 1862.<ref name="White">[[#White_1961|White 1961]], p. 33.</ref>

It also stated that "an unusual amount of decorative taste has been displayed" in the station's construction; even the viaduct was praised as "one of the most ornamental pieces of work we have ever seen attempted on a railway" for its fine brickwork.<ref>{{cite journal |title=London, Chatham and Dover Railway |journal=The Building News |volume=10 |date=9 January 1863 |page=27}}</ref> The station's design prompted the journal to write a 2,000-word editorial bemoaning the comparatively poor architectural quality of other contemporary civil engineering projects.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Herne Hill railway station |journal=The Building News |volume=10 |date=1 May 1863 |page=327}}</ref> An architectural critic later noted the station was "eulogised" by journals upon its opening and that its architecture was still seen as exemplary at the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Frampton |first1=George |year=1896 |title= |journal=The Studio |volume=7 |issue= |page=24 |publisher=National Magazine Co}}</ref>
 
There were initially two platforms at the station: [[Railroad_direction#United_Kingdom|up and down]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Stanford |first=Edward |title= Stanford's Library Map Of London And Its Suburbs 1864: East Brixton, South London Railway, London Chatham & Dover Railway, Herne Hill, & Dulwich |year=1864 |ref=harv }}</ref> Up was accessed from the upper floor of the station building via a stairway outside the building and down from an island platform.

Lambeth Council. Retrieved 20 April 2012</ref>

The land for the station was compulsorily purchased from Thomas Vyse, manufacturer of straw hats and owner of the Abbey, an estate at 70 Herne Hill; the station and much of the viaduct were built on part of the Abbey's grounds.<ref>[[#Herne Hill Society 2003|Herne Hill Society 2003]], p. 78.</ref> A new road (appropriately, Station Road) was built from the station to the junction of Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane, Herne Hill's main thoroughfare.<ref name="HerneHill">[[#Herne Hill Society 2003|Herne Hill Society 2003]], p. 11.</ref>

===Early services===
From July 1863, the LCDR's trains between Victoria and Kent ran through Herne Hill.

A popular workmen's train (one [[<U+00A3>sd|penny]] per journey) ran between Ludgate Hill and Victoria via Herne Hill from 1865.

Both the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) and the [[London and South Western Railway]] (LSWR) helped fund the Metropolitan Extensions (<U+00A3>320,000 and <U+00A3>310,000 respectively; <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|320000|1860|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=0}}}} and <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|310000|1860|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=0}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) in return for the right to use the LCDR's tracks.<ref name="Jackson_a">[[#Jackson_1969|Jackson 1969]], p. 193.</ref> The GNR ran trains between [[Hatfield railway station|Hatfield]] and Herne Hill from August 1866 until March 1868 (when the trains were diverted to Victoria via Loughborough Junction);<ref name="Jackson" /> this was a busy all-stops service, with 15 trains leaving Hatfield and 14 leaving Herne Hill every day.<ref>{{cite journal |date=11 August 1866 |journal=The Railway News |page=136}}</ref> The LSWR began running trains between Ludgate Hill and [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] via Herne Hill when the Tulse Hill extension was completed.<ref name="Jackson_a" /> Some of these services went as far as [[Kingston railway station (London)|Kingston]] until the mid-1890s.<ref> [[#Mitchell_and_Smith_1992|Mitchell and Smith 1992]], fig. 53.</ref>

===Changes from 1870 to 1923===
By 1870, a track had been added to the east of the station and two sidings had been added to the west;<ref>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=W.W. |title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps Brixton & Herne Hill 1870 |year=1988 |publisher=Alan Godfrey Maps |isbn=0-85054-151-4 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>[[#Mitchell_and_Smith_1992|Mitchell and Smith 1992]], map VIII.</ref> one of the western sidings was a [[bay platform]] for passenger trains, which was accessed from the platform adjoining the upper floor.<ref>[[#Mitchell_and_Smith_1992|Mitchell and Smith 1992]], fig. 54.</ref> [[Interlocking]] signalling was in use at Herne Hill by 1880.<ref>[[#Kidner_1968|Kidner 1968]], p. 347.</ref>

The LCDR enlarged the station in 1884 to meet growing demand: the viaduct was widened to allow for the construction of a second island platform and two lines to the east<ref>{{cite journal |year=1884 |title=Miscellania |journal=The Builder |volume=47 |page=278 |publisher=The Builder, Covent Garden}}</ref> (the easternmost line was used only for freight<ref>[[#Mitchell_and_Smith_1992|Mitchell and Smith 1992]], map IX.</ref>); and the foot tunnel under the viaduct was opened. In 1885, the LCDR decided to use [[Blackfriars Bridge railway station]] solely as a goods yard but lacked the space to sort wagons at the site.<ref name="Jackson_a" /><ref>[[#White_1971|White 1971]], p. 37.</ref> It purchased {{convert|14|acre|ha|1|lk=in|abbr=on}} of land between Herne Hill and Loughborough Junction for this purpose.<ref>[[#Kidner_1968|Kidner 1968]], p. 332.</ref> The Herne Hill Sorting Sidings had some 35 sidings, the longest of which was {{convert|940|ft|m|1|lk=in|abbr=on}}.<ref>[[#Mitchell_and_Smith_1992|Mitchell and Smith 1992]], fig. 58.</ref> A stationmaster's house was built at 239 Railton Road in the mid-1880s as the site offered a good view of the station (it is now privately owned).<ref>[[#Herne_Hill_Society_2003|Herne Hill Society 2003]], p. 14.</ref> In 1888, Railton Road was extended to the Norwood Road/Half Moon Lane junction and Station Road ceased to exist.<ref name="HerneHill" />

At the beginning of 1899, the LCDR and the neighbouring [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]] (SER) handed over operation of their services to the newly-formed [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]] (SECR), which was jointly owned by the two railways. The SECR ran the trains, but the lines and stations continued to be owned by the LCDR or SER.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dendy Marshall |first1=C.F. |last2=Kidner |first2=R.W. |title=History of the Southern Railway |edition=2nd |year=1963 |origyear=1937 |publisher=[[Ian Allan]] |location=Shepperton |isbn=0-7110-0059-X |pages=314, 345, 355 |ref=harv }}</ref>

In 1900, it was suggested in ''[[The Contemporary Review]]'' that the City Branch should be replaced with an electric deep-level railway (i.e. a 'tube' line) between Herne Hill and Farringdon in order to remove Blackfriars Railway Bridge, which the author considered to be a blight on the Thames.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Strahan |first1=A. |year=1900 |journal=The Contemporary Review |volume=78 |page=109}}</ref>

A late-night service from Ludgate Hill (departing 01:15) to Beckenham Junction via Herne Hill began in 1910. The intention was to satisfy journalists on [[Fleet Street]] who regularly complained in print about the poor quality of service on the line; those working on the morning papers often worked beyond midnight and missed the last train.<ref>[[#Jackson_1969|Jackson 1969]], p. 199.</ref> 

Services to Farringdon from Herne Hill were discontinued in 1916 with the closure of Snow Hill tunnel to passengers, and trains from the south terminated at [[Holborn Viaduct railway station|Holborn Viaduct]] instead.<ref>[[#Jackson_1969|Jackson 1969]], p. 201.</ref><ref>[[#White_1971|White 1971]], p. 39.</ref> The LCDR amalgamated with the LB&SCR, SER and several other railways to form the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] at the start of 1923.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bonavia |first= Michael R. |title=History of the Southern Railway |year=1987 |publisher=Unwin Hyman |isbn= 978-0-04-385107-4 |page=26 |location =London |ref=harv }}</ref>

===Modernisation===
Work began on electrifying the former LCDR suburban routes in 1924. Herne Hill station was extensively remodelled as part of these works: the eastern island platform was lengthened; the original island platform was demolished and replaced by one further west (allowing two tracks to be laid between the island platforms); the western sidings were removed; and the upper floor was closed to passengers.<ref>[[#Moody_1957|Moody 1957]], p. 27.</ref><ref>[[#Mitchell_and_Smith_1992|Mitchell and Smith 1992]], fig. 65.</ref>

On 12 July 1925, a 660-volt [[Railway electrification in Great Britain#650 V - 750 V DC, third rail|third-rail system]] came into operation on both routes through Herne Hill: from Victoria to Orpington on the Chatham Main Line and along the entire length of the City Branch. Electric passenger services ran every 20&nbsp;minutes on both routes during the day<ref>[[#Moody_1957|Moody 1957]], p. 28.</ref> and electric trains were kept overnight at the sorting sidings, north of the station.<ref>[[#Moody_1957|Moody 1957]], p. 104.</ref>

The distinctive signal box overlooking Norwood Road and a similar signal box at the northern end of the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single signal box adjacent to the north junction.<ref>[[#Moody_1957|Moody 1957]], p. 154.</ref> The replacement signal box was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff.<ref>[[#Mitchell_and_Smith_1992|Mitchell and Smith 1992]], figs. 60,64.</ref> The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from [[Railway semaphore signal|semaphores]] to [[Railway signal#Colour light signals|colour lights]] on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan.<ref>{{cite journal |date=11 August 1866 |journal=Railway gazette international |volume=110 |publisher=Reed Business |page=290}}</ref>

By 1959, the pattern of commuter services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it would hold into the 21st century: all-stop trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]]).<ref>[[#Jackson_1969|Jackson 1969]], p. 205.</ref> However, there was a decline in the number of electric passenger services on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill in the years after the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and [[Shortlands railway station|Shortlands]] in each direction during every off-peak hour. By 1960, it had dropped to two trains in each direction.<ref>[[#White_1971|White 1971]], p. 64.</ref>

The Herne Hill Sorting Sidings closed on 1 August 1966 and the freight line to the east of the station was taken out of service.<ref name="MitchellSmith">[[#Mitchell_and_Smith_1992|Mitchell and Smith 1992]], fig. 61.</ref> Nothing of the sidings remains: residential accommodation has been built along Shakespeare Road (on the western sidings) and commercial premises have been built along Milkwood Road (on the eastern sidings).<ref>{{cite book |last=Herne Hill Society |title= A Glance at the History of Herne Hill |year=1992 |publisher= Herne Hill Society  |page=5 |location =London |ref=harv }}</ref>

===1988 to present===
In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and the former LCDR City Branch formed the basis of the new [[Thameslink]] route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key objective of the [[Thameslink Programme]] was allowing more trains to travel between central London and [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]], which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic [[Borough Market]]. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market.<ref name="Thameslink">[[#Thameslink2000_2004|Thameslink 2000 (2004)]], p. 8.</ref> This would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a [[Overpass|fly-over]] to connect the southern end of the new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill).<ref>[[#Thameslink2000_2004|Thameslink 2000 (2004)]], p. 10.</ref> This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead.<ref name="Thameslink" /> From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink services serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.<ref>[http://thameslinkprogramme.co.uk/faqs/faqs_categories/public_index#question_48 Question 48], Thameslink Programme.

During the initial planning in the late 1980s for [[High Speed 1]] (HS1; a high-speed railway line between London and the [[Channel Tunnel]]), [[British Rail]] considered building the line to serve a low-level station at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] via south London.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7082392.stm | title = How St Pancras was chosen | work = BBC News Online | location=London | date=14 November 2007 | accessdate = 19 November 2007 | first=Trevor | last=Timpson}}</ref> An option for this route was via Herne Hill, which would have required quadrupling the tracks on the Chatham Main Line between Shortlands and Herne Hill and on the City Branch to Loughborough Junction;<ref>{{cite news | title = British Rail sets out timetable for train services to the Channel tunnel | work = The Times | location=London | date=15 July 1988 | first=Cowton | last=Rodney}}</ref> it was estimated that this would have led to the loss of 90<U+2013>180 homes in Lambeth.<ref>{{cite news | title = Thousand of homes at risk in choice of Channel tunnel link | work = The Times | location=London | date=5 December 1988 | first=Cowton | last=Rodney}}</ref> Although both a different route and London terminus for HS1 were eventually chosen (St Pancras via East London), [[Eurostar]] services linking [[London Waterloo station|London Waterloo]] to Brussels and Paris passed through Herne Hill without stopping<ref>{{cite book  |title=Channel Tunnel International Rail Link |publisher= British Rail |at=Passenger train routes - Infrastructure and train movements |url= http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BRB_ChannelTunnel003.pdf |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> from 1994 until the completion of HS1 in November 2007. This marked the end of rail services to the continent via Herne Hill, which had been started by the LCDR in 1863 when the line between Victoria and Dover via Herne Hill was completed.

The upper floor of the station, which had not been used by passengers since 1925, was converted into {{convert|3000|sqft|sqm|1|lk=in|abbr=on}} of office space in 1991 and rented as 'Tower House' (after the station's distinctive tower).<ref name="MitchellSmith" /> The disused freight line to the east of the station was partly reopened in 2009 as a siding for use by First Capital Connect trains to compensate for the loss of sidings when the [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]] Thameslink branch was closed.<ref>{{cite book |title= Variation to Proposed G1 Network Change: Herne Hill Turnback Facilities |year=2008|publisher= Network Rail |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/network%20code/network%20change/completed%20proposals/thameslink/ng2008tlpoo1herne%20hill/ncg12008tlp001v2%20herne%20hill.pdf |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="southernelectric" /> The line's connection to the south junction was severed during these works.

===Accidents and disruption===
Railway services through Herne Hill were affected by [[World War II]]. Passenger services on the City Branch were reduced from September 1939 to once every 30&nbsp;minutes during the week and hourly at weekends;<ref>[[#Moody_1957|Moody 1957]], p. 107.</ref> and the line was cut twice during [[the Blitz]]. On the second occasion, the railway bridge over Hinton Road (immediately south of Loughborough Junction) was destroyed.<ref>[[#Moody_1957|Moody 1957]], p. 114.</ref> The route between Holborn Viaduct and Herne Hill was disrupted by 62 incidents during the war.<ref>[[#Moody_1957|Moody 1957]], p. 115.</ref>

On 6 November 1947, a steam train approaching from West Dulwich passed a [[Signal passed at danger|signal at danger]] in heavy fog and crashed into an electric train crossing the station's south junction towards Tulse Hill. One passenger onboard the electric train was killed and nine others were hospitalised.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=G.R.S. |title= Railway Accidents: Report on the Collision which occurred on 6th November, 1947, at Herne Hill on the Southern Railway |year=1948 |publisher=Ministry of Transport |location=London |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_HerneHill1947.pdf |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> 

A minor accident occurred on 30 June 1957. A light engine, travelling towards Tulse Hill, was waiting to cross the south junction when it was struck from behind by an express passenger service from Victoria that had passed a signal at danger. The driver of the light engine and two passengers from the express train were hospitalised but quickly discharged.<ref>{{cite book |last=McMullen |first=D. |title=Railway Accidents: Report on the collision which occurred on 30th June 1957 at Herne Hill in the Southern Region British Railways |year=1957 |publisher=Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation |location= London |url= http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_HerneHill1957.pdf |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> 

A second fatal collision occurred at the sorting sidings, just north of the station, on 1 April 1960 in fog that reduced visibility to {{convert|60|ft|m|1|lk=in|abbr=on}}. A steam locomotive was waiting on the southbound track outside Herne Hill for a proceed signal when the signalman cleared an electric passenger service (behind the steam locomotive) to proceed down the same track.

==Future==
===Services===
The route through the station will be busier from 2015 as Thameslink trains serving [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] will be diverted via Herne Hill<ref>[http://thameslinkprogramme.co.uk/cms/pages/view/64 A new station for London Bridge], Thameslink Programme.

The additional trains will not call at Herne Hill; instead, they will run fast between [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars]] and [[East Croydon station|East Croydon]].<ref name="NetworkRail" /> It would not be possible for the 12-car peak services to call at Herne Hill in any event as the station's platforms are too short and it would not be viable to use [[selective door operation]] as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.<ref name="NetworkRail_a">[[#NetworkRail_March2008|Network Rail March 2008]], p. 128.</ref>

[[Network Rail]], in its July 2011 London & South East [[route utilisation strategy]], has recommended that all services from Herne Hill towards Blackfriars should terminate in the [[Bay platform|bay platforms]] at Blackfriars after London Bridge's redevelopment is completed in 2018<ref>[[#NetworkRail_July2011|Network Rail July 2011]], p. 71.</ref> and the diverted Thameslink trains return there.<ref>[[#NetworkRail_July2011|Network Rail July 2011]], p. 20.</ref> Passengers from Herne Hill would then have to change at Blackfriars to travel further north. Network Rail has made this recommendation because more services will be using the route between [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]] and London Bridge from 2018;<ref name="NetworkRail_b" /> sending trains from Herne Hill to the terminating platforms on the western side of Blackfriars (instead of the through tracks on the eastern side of the station) will remove the need for them to cross in front of trains to/from [[Denmark Hill]] and trains to/from London Bridge at junctions south of Blackfriars.<ref>[[#NetworkRail_July2011|Network Rail July 2011]], p.80.</ref>

It is anticipated there will be six trains to Blackfriars from Herne Hill during peak hours from 2018 (four from Sutton and two from Kent House) and four trains from Sutton during off-peak hours.<ref name="NetworkRail_b">[[#NetworkRail_July2011|Network Rail July 2011]], p. 72.</ref> There will also be two trains between [[Medway|Medway, Kent]] and Blackfriars via Herne Hill during peak hours, but they will not call at the station.<ref>[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/rus%20documents/route%20utilisation%20strategies/kent/kent%20rus.pdf Assumed Kent main line services following completion of construction works at London Bridge, p. 187.], Network Rail.
