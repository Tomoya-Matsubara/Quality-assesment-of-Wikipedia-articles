'''Nigel David Howard''' ([[18 May]] [[1925]]-[[31 May]] [[1979]]) was an [[English cricket team|English]] [[cricketer]] who played for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] and England. He captained England for the tour to [[Indian cricket team|India]] in the only four [[Test cricket|Test match]]es he played in, winning one and drawing three, although the series was drawn after the fifth Test match was lost (Howard was injured and [[Donald Carr]] captained England in his absence).  Nigel Howard was chosen to lead England's second-string side to the sub-continent in 1951-52 largely because he was an amateur (Len Hutton became the first professional England captain of the 20th century a few months later) and a successful leader of Lancashire (1949-53).

He led the MCC most capably on and, equally importantly in view of the considerable diplomatic demands of those times, off the field. He soldiered on despite developing pleurisy during the second half of the tour. At county level (1946-54) he was a stylish batsman and excellent fielder. 

He was a son of [[Rupert Howard]], a [[secretary]] of [[Lancashire CCC]] and a brother of [[Barry Howard]]. He died on the [[Isle of Man]] in [[May 1979]], aged 54.
