'''Mariel Margaret Hamm''' (born on March 17, 1972, in [[Selma, Alabama]]), best known as '''Mia Hamm''', is a retired American [[soccer]] player. Hamm played many years as a [[striker|forward]] for the [[United States women's national soccer team]] and was a founding member of the [[Washington Freedom]]. Hamm has scored more international goals in her career than any other player, male or female, in the history of soccer (158).<ref name="renamed_from_2009_on_20101220232649">{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=642459&cc=5901|title=Mia Hamm to receive Freedom honor|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 1, 2009}}</ref> She is the second most [[Caps (sport)|capped]] player in history.

Hamm was named the women's [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] the first two times that award was given (in 2001 and 2002), and is listed as one of [[FIFA]]'s 125 best living players (as chosen by [[Pel<U+00E9>]]). ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Michael Wilbon]] called Hamm, "Perhaps the most important athlete of the last 15 years."<ref>Dave Zirin, ''What's My Name, Fool? Sports and Resistance in the United States'', 2005. Haymarket Books. ISBN 1-931859-20-5</ref>

She retired from the sport in 2004, when she played her last game in the 2004 Fan Celebration Tour to commemorate the U.S. women's national team's victory in the 2004 Olympics. In 2007, her first year of eligibility, she was selected for induction into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] by having 137 votes of the 141 ballots cast. [[Women's Professional Soccer]], a professional soccer league that launched in 2009, features Hamm's silhouette in its logo.<ref name="WPS logo">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2008-01-18-hamm-silhouette-logo_N.htm

==Early years==
Hamm was born with a [[club foot]] and had to wear corrective shoes as a toddler.<ref name="Hilton2004">{{Cite book |last=Hilton |first=Lisette |title=Feet of Gold |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_hamm_mia.html |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2004-08-30 |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> Hamm spent her childhood on Air Force bases with her parents, Bill and Stephanie Hamm, and her five siblings. The family moved many times and resided in several places including San Antonio, Texas, and Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brooksinternational.com/Mia_Hamm_610.htm |title=Sports Speaker Mia Hamm}}</ref> Hamm played organized sports from a very young age, and at age fifteen she joined the [[United States women's national soccer team|U.S. women's national team]], becoming the youngest ever to play for them.<ref name="a">{{cite web |title=Mia Hamm - Class of 2007 |url=http://national.soccerhall.org/famers/mia_hamm.htm |publisher=National Soccer Hall of Fame}}</ref> She played for Notre Dame Catholic High School, [[Wichita Falls]], Texas, as a freshman and a sophomore. Hamm then attended [[Lake Braddock Secondary School]] in [[Burke, Virginia|Burke, Va]]. for one year, and helped the Lake Braddock soccer team win the 1989 state championships.<ref name="b">http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/article.asp?article=308753&paper=69&cat=105</ref> Mia Hamm's brother played sports, inspiring her to do so as well.

She attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where she helped the [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's soccer|Tar Heels]] to four [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) women's championships in five years (she sat out the season of 1991 to concentrate on the [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup]] in China). North Carolina only lost one game in ninety five she played.<ref name="b">[http://ncaa.com/history/default.aspx?id=88028 Women's Soccer History]</ref> She was an [[All-American]] and [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] player of the year for her last three years. She also won [[ACC Athlete of the Year|ACC Female Athlete of the Year]] in 1993 and 1994.

==Women's national team==
In 1991, when the women's national team won the [[FIFA Women's World Cup 1991|FIFA Women's World Cup]] for the first time, Hamm became the youngest American woman to win a World Cup championship at the age of nineteen.

She was also a member of the American National college team that played in the [[1993 Summer Universiade]] and lost to [[China women's national football team|China]], obtaining the silver medal. She was the leading scorer with six goals. She graduated from college with the all-time records for [[Atlantic Coast Conference|her conference]] in goals with 103, assists with 72, and total points with 278.

On May 22, 1999, Hamm broke the all-time international goal record with her 108th goal in a game against [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]] in [[Orlando, Florida]].

In 1999, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] named the largest building on their corporate campus after Hamm, and that same year she and the rest of the women on the national team became world champions again by winning the [[FIFA Women's World Cup 1999|FIFA Women's World Cup]]. The final match surpassed the Atlanta Olympic final as the most-attended women's sports event, with over 90,000 filling the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]].

Hamm was named the 1997 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category) by the Women's Sports Foundation.<ref name="b">{{cite web|url=http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/News-And-Events/Awards/Sportswoman-of-the-Year-Award.aspx|title=Sportswoman of the Year Award|publisher=Women's Sports Foundation|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> 

On May 14, 2004, she announced her retirement effective after the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]], expressing an interest in starting a family with her husband, [[Nomar Garciaparra]].<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=318748&cc=5901 ESPNsoccernet - US - Hamm, Foudy retire in style<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=1802294 ESPN - Hamm says she wants to focus on family - Olympics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In March 2004, Hamm and former U.S. teammate [[Michelle Akers]] were the only two women, and the only two Americans, named to the [[FIFA 100]], a list of the 125 greatest living soccer players selected by [[Pel<U+00E9>]] and commissioned by [[FIFA]] for that organization's 100th anniversary.

In a friendly game against [[Australia women's national football team|Australia]] on July 21, 2004, Hamm scored her 151st international goal; she has long held the record in that category for any player, male or female. This match also marked her 259th [[cap (football)|international appearance]]; only her teammate [[Kristine Lilly]] has played in more internationals.

She helped lead Team USA to a gold medal at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] and was also chosen by her fellow U.S. Olympians to carry the American flag at the Athens Closing Ceremonies. After the Olympics, Hamm and her teammates went on a "farewell tour" of the United States, which finished on December 8, 2004 against [[Mexico women's national football team|Mexico]] at the [[Home Depot Center]] in [[Carson, California]]. In the game, which the U.S. won 5&ndash;0, Hamm assisted on two of the goals. Hamm is one of three longtime national team members who announced their retirements from international play at the end of the tour; the others are longtime captain [[Julie Foudy]] and [[Joy Fawcett]] (Fawcett did not play due to back surgery after the Olympics). Hamm retired with 158 international goals at age thirty-two.

==Personal life==
Her adoptive brother, Garrett Hamm, died on April 16, 1997 of complications from [[aplastic anemia]], a rare blood disease. Hamm established the [[Mia Hamm Foundation]] in part to support patients and their families who benefit from bone marrow transplants.

Hamm was first married to her college sweetheart Christiaan Corry, a [[United States Marine Corps]] CH-53E helicopter pilot, but they divorced in 2001.<ref name=peopleBEautiful>{{cite web|title=Mia Hamm - Most Beautiful, Mia Hamm|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20122081,00.html|work=[[People.com]]|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref><ref name=nyt_divorce>{{cite news|last=Longman|first=Jere|title=Hamm Pays Personal Price for Soccer|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/20/sports/soccer-hamm-pays-personal-price-for-soccer.html|accessdate=17 May 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 July 2001}}</ref>
