==History==
===Antique history===
In Ptolemy's "Geography", IV, iii, 7, the city is mentioned under the name of '''Mileum''' or '''Mireon'''. During the Roman era it was called '''Colonia Sarnensis Milevitana''', after the River Sarnus in [[Campania]], whence the colonists had emigrated. This name is often found in the inscriptions of the city. Together with [[Cirta]], [[Collo]] and [[Rusicade]], Milevum formed the confederation known as the Four Colonies, the territory of which was very extensive. In the sixth century the Byzantine [[Emperor Justinian]] had Milevum enclosed by a fortified wall, which still stands and forms a rampart for the Arab city of Mila <ref>Ch. Diehl, ''Afrique byzantine'', Paris, 1896, 603 sq.</ref>. It has yielded quite a number of Latin inscriptions from this city and a colossal statue of Saturn.
Two councils were held at Milevum, one in 402 and the other in 416.
The second appealed to [[Pope Innocent I]] for the repression of the [[Pelagian]] heresy. Among the bishops of this titular see were [[Pollianus]], present at the [[Council of Carthage]] in 255 and martyred two years later; [[St. Optatus]], noted for his work against the Donatists, died circa 385, and commemorated on 4 June; Honorius; Severus, fellow-countryman and friend of [[St. Augustine Benenanus]] (484); Restitutus, who attended the [[Fifth <U+0152>cumenical Council]] in 553.
Sometime between 675 and 682, the city was conquered by the [[Umayyad]] Arabs commanded by [[Abu al-Muhajir Dinar]]<ref>according to the 9th-century Arab historian [[Khalifa ibn Khayyat]], see article by Benabb<U+00E8>s cited below</ref>.

===Modern history===
Milevum, modern Arabic name Mila, was under French colonial rule a city in the [[department of Constantine]] in [[Algeria]], with in the early 20th century 8000 inhabitants, 400 of whom are Europeans. That department later became [[Constantine Province]] after the indepence of Algeria, of which Mila was dependent till the creation of [[Mila Province]] in 1984. As of 1998, the most recent census in the country, the city has a population of 59,959.
