{{quotation|Of the Snowden case, Robert points out that in 2009 the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism. Martin Sheinin, warned of the potential abuses by government in its mass public surveillance programs and the necessity for an internal whistle blower mechanism to both encourage and protect those who come forward with information on government abuse of citizens' privacy rights. The Obama administration was aware of the Special Rapporteur's report and did nothing that would have allowed Snowden (or any other person out of the hundreds of thousands of employees of the NSA) to have made the disclosures at an earlier state. Robert also says that Mr Snowden made a clear decision of conscience at an enormous personal cost and risk to his life, to inform, not just the American public, but the global community, of the egregious transgressions of the NSA and the Five Eyes governments (USA, UK, Canada, Australia and NZ). But for Snowden's disclosures the NSA and its Five Eyes partners' activities would have gone unchecked.

=== Zeljko Ivic ===
Robert Tibbo is serving as the lawyer for Zeljko Ivic, a former employee of a [[BTG Pactual|Banco BTG Pactual SA]] group company. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) [[Andr<U+00E9> Esteves]] and a member of the board of directors [[Huw Jenkins]], reportedly "made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court."<ref name=Wong2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-15/btg-billionaire-esteves-sued-in-hong-kong-by-ex-employee.html|title=BTG Billionaire Esteves Sued in Hong Kong by Ex-Employee - Bloomberg|last=Wong|first=Douglas|date=15 May 2014|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=12 December 2014|quote=Andre Esteves, the billionaire founder of Brazil<U+2019>s BTG Pactual, was sued by a former employee in Hong Kong who claims he was promised a partnership and stock for securing investors before the bank<U+2019>s initial share sale. Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, <U+201C>which they believe to be baseless and without merit,<U+201D> according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn<U+2019>t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Ivic is seeking more than $20 million as damages for the value of the shares and partnership promised, as well as unpaid bonuses, his lawyer Robert Tibbo said.}}</ref> Tibbo has stated that Zeljko Ivic played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's [[Initial public offering|IPO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finews.ch/news/finanzplatz/15315-20-millionen-dollar-klage-gegen-andre-esteves-und-huw-jenkins|title=20-Millionen-Klage gegen Andr<U+00E9> Esteves und Huw Jenkins|date=15 May 2014|publisher=Fine News|language=German|accessdate=12 December 2014|quote=Der Anwalt von Ivic sagte hingegen, die beiden h<U+00E4>tten Ivic etwas vorgespielt.
