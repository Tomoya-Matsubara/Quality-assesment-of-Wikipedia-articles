During 1697 and 1698 he went on a [[Grand Tour]] and in 1700 was admitted to the [[Scottish Bar]].<ref name=Colvin-257>Colvin, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CSyaO-MqYoAC&lpg=PA259&dq=JOHN%20CLERK%20OF%20PENICUIK%2C&pg=PA257#v=onepage&f=false p. 257]</ref>

==Parliament==

He was a member of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] for [[Whithorn]] from 1702 to 1707, and a Commissioner for the Union of Parliaments for the [[British Whig Party|Whig Party]]: he sat in the first [[Parliament of Great Britain]] in 1707.  He was appointed a [[Court of Exchequer (Scotland)|Baron of the Exchequer]] for Scotland on the constitution of the Exchequer Court, 13 May 1708, a position he held for nearly half a century.<ref name=Anderson-653>Anderson, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bLQEAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA653&dq=and+the+others+On+the+effects+of+Thunder+on+Trees+and+Of+a+large+Deer%27s+Horns+found+in+the+heart+of+an+Oak&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 653]</ref> With Baron Scrope, in 1726, he drew up an ''Historical View of the Forms and Powers of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland'', which was printed at the expense of the Barons of Exchequer for private circulation.<ref name=Anderson-653>Anderson, p. 653</ref>

A leading supporter of the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] 1707 with the [[Kingdom of England]], Clerk wrote in his [[memoir]]s of [[England|English]] [[novelist]], [[journalist]] and [[secret agent]] [[Daniel Defoe]]: "He was therefor<!--sic--> a spy among
us, but not known to be such, otherways the [[wiktionary:mob|Mob]] of [[Edinburgh]] had pull him to pieces".<ref>Backscheider p. 233</ref><ref group=nb>the exact wording of the quote varies for example Trevelyan uses "a spy among us, but not known to be such, otherwise the mob of Edinburgh had pulled him to pieces" (Trevelyan, p. 277).</ref>

==Academic leanings==

Of his other treatises, Clerk wrote papers in the ''Philosophical Transactions'': one an ''Account of the Stylus of the Ancients and their different sorts of Paper'', printed in 1731, and the others ''On the effects of Thunder on Trees'' and ''Of a large Deer's Horns found in the heart of an Oak'', printed in 1739. He was the author of a tract entitled ''Dissertatio de quibusdam Minumentis Romanis &c'', written in 1730 but not published until 1750. For upwards of twenty years he also carried on a learned correspondence with [[Roger Gale (antiquary)|Roger Gale]], the English [[antiquary]], which forms a portion of the ''Reliquiae Britannica'' of 1782.<ref name=Anderson-653/>

==Patron of the Arts==

Sir John Clerk was one of the friends and patrons of [[Allan Ramsay]] who, during his latter years, spent much of his time at Penicuik House. Upon his death Sir John erected at his family seat an [[obelisk]] to Ramsay's memory. He was a patron to various other artists and architects, and even dabbled in [[architecture]] himself.<ref name=Anderson-653/>

==Musical talent==

Clerk had a musical bent also, and while in Rome may have been [[tutor]]ed by the [[baroque]] composer [[Arcangelo Corelli]],<ref>Allsop, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Un6PsMDLIE8C&pg=PA58&dq=Arcangelo+Corelli+John+Clerk&cd=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 58]</ref> but his own work has often been overlooked, primarily since the only record of his composition seems to be his own papers.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} One of his humorous songs was ''O merry may the maid be that marries the miller''.<ref name=Anderson-653/>

==Family==

Sir John succeeded his father in his title and estates in 1722.<ref name=Colvin-257/> He unsuccessfully courted Susanna, daughter of Sir Archibald Kennedy of Culzean, Baronet (ancestor of the [[Marquess of Ailsa]]) and that correspondence is in the National Archives. She became the third wife of Alexander, 9th Earl of Eglinton.<ref name=Anderson-653/>

He married, firstly, on 23 February 1701, Lady Margaret, eldest daughter of [[Alexander Stewart, 3rd Earl of Galloway]] who died in childbirth on 26 December that year. Her son, John, survived, but died unmarried in 1722. Sir John remarried Janet, daughter of Sir John Inglis of Cramond, by whom he had seven sons and six daughters.<ref name=Anderson-654> Anderson, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bLQEAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA654#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 654]</ref> He died at Penicuik House on 4 October 1755.<ref>Penicuik House Project</ref><ref> Wilson, p. 156</ref>
