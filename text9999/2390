'''The Librarian of [[Unseen University]]''' is a recurring character in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series of fantasy novels.

==Fictional history==

The Librarian appeared in the first novel of the series, ''[[The Colour of Magic]]'', and was transformed into an [[orang-utan]] in ''[[The Light Fantastic]]'' as the Octavo fired a beam of magic upwards. On discovering that being an orang-utan had certain advantages for a librarian - he can climb up to high shelves, for example - he refused to be transformed back into a human and has remained an orang-utan ever since. The other wizards have gradually become used to the situation, to the extent that, from ''[[Night Watch (novel)|Night Watch]]'': <U+2018>if someone ever reported that there was an orang-utan in the Library, the wizards would probably go and ask the Librarian if he'd seen it.<U+2019>

Being an ape, he is known for his violent reaction to most people calling him a "''[[monkey]]''." He speaks a language whose vocabulary consists primarily of the single word ''Ook'' (originally ''Oook''), inflected for simple affirmations and negations. ''Eeek'' is also occasionally heard, particularly in moments of panic or rage. Nonetheless, most people seem able to understand him. 

The Librarian's name has never been given in any of the books; he is always simply <U+2018>the Librarian.<U+2019> If the Librarian's true name were known, he could be changed back into a human, and he has from ''[[The Last Continent]]'' carefully excised his name from the records of the University. ''[[The Discworld Companion]]'' hints that he may once have been Dr. Horace Worblehat, which goes most of the way to explaining why he is happier as an orang-utan. ''[[The Art of Discworld]]'' confirms that the Librarian was indeed Dr. Horace Worblehat, and that his fears of turning back into human are baseless at most <U+2013> although with such a name, one can surmise a past which he is reluctant to return to. [[Rincewind]] is apparently the only wizard who still remembers the Librarian's name, but has agreed not to tell anyone.

The Librarian served a brief stint in the [[City Watch]] during the reign of terror caused by the dragon of [[Ankh-Morpork]], where he helped to rescue [[Samuel Vimes|Sam Vimes]] from the [[Havelock Vetinari|Patrician's]] cell. He retained an honorary position with the Watch, and is considered as of ''[[Thud!]]'' to be one of the first members of the 'Specials' <U+2013> the Ankh-Morpork City Militia. He also used the Librarian ability of travelling through [[L-Space]], (mentioned below, an [[extradimensional]] space that connects all libraries and other large accumulations of books) to save books from the great library of [[Discworld_geography#Ephebe|Ephebe]] in ''[[Small Gods]]'', (it is as-of-yet unknown if this also includes [[Death (Discworld)|Death's]] infinite Autobiography Library.)  In ''[[Soul Music (novel)|Soul Music]]'', he joined the [[Band with Rocks In]] since his large hands and wide reach make him an excellent keyboard player, though he left before they became famous (a reference to [[Pete Best]] and the [[Beatles]]). He remains the chief organist for the [[Unseen University]], and does not consider an organ complete without a vox diabolica-stop, a thunder pedal, and a 256-ft Earthquake pipe.

The Librarian is a member of a small elite group of senior librarians who have the knowledge and ability to travel through [[L-space]]. The very strict rules that members of this group are pledged to enforce are: 
# Silence
# Books must be returned no later than the date shown
# Do not meddle with the nature of [[causality]]. 

Of course, the Librarian has been known to break both the first and third rules on occasion, but he is adamant about the second.

In ''[[Men at Arms]]'', it is stated that the Librarian likes being the [[Wedding ceremony participants#Best man|Best Man]] at weddings because he is allowed to kiss the [[bridesmaid]]s and they are not allowed to run away; in ''[[Lords and Ladies]]'' the Librarian served as the Best Man for Magrat and Verence.

The cover of the Discworld picture book ''[[Where's My Cow?]]'' indicates that it has won the [[Ankh-Morpork]] Librarian's award.

==In other media==

The Librarian appears in orang-utan form in the video games [[Discworld (video game)|Discworld]] and [[Discworld II]]. In the first game, a [[running gag]] is used where he assaults anybody who happens to say the word "monkey", either deliberately or by accident, followed by the victim inquiring "Did you get the number of that donkey cart?". In the second game, the violence is toned down, and he simply gets irritated whenever the word monkey is said. Rincewind states at one point, "I happen to know there is no animation of me being hit on the head <U+2013> why do you think the Librarian's letting me off so easily this time?".

In [[Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic|the 2008 TV adaptation]] of ''The Colour of Magic'' and ''The Light Fantastic'', by [[Sky One]], he appears in both human and orang-utan form. His human form is played by Nicolas Tennant, who had previously played [[Nobby Nobbs|Corporal Nobbs]] in ''[[Terry Pratchett's Hogfather]]''. This adaptation also establishes his name as Horace Worblehat.
