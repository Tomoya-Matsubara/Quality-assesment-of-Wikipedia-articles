'''Henry Nicholas Greenwell''' (1826<U+2013>1891) was an English merchant credited with establishing [[Kona coffee]] as a internationally known brand.<ref name="Kinro2003">{{cite book |author=Gerald Kinro |title=A cup of aloha: the Kona coffee epic |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wyw0JEuokwsC&pg=RA1-PR1-IA4 |date=June 2003 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=9780824826789 |page=14}}</ref>
His family became major land-holders in the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona District]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].
The [[Greenwell Store]] is now a museum and historical center.

==Life==
Henry Nicholas Greenwell was born January 9, 1826 in [[Lanchester, County Durham|Lanchester]], [[County Durham]], [[England]]. His father was William Thomas Greenwell (1777<U+2013>1856) and mother was Dorothy Smales (1789<U+2013>1871).<ref>{{cite book |title=  The Story of Hawaii and Its Builders |year=1925 |publisher= [[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |editor= George F.

His oldest brother was [[William Greenwell]] (1820<U+2013>1918) an English [[archaeologist]]. His sister Dorothy (1821<U+2013>1882) published poetry under the name [[Dora Greenwell]].<ref>{{cite book |author=William Dorling |title=Memoirs of Dora Greenwell |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V355KGC-yucC&pg=PA1 |year=1885 |publisher=J.

As fourth son he had little chance of inheriting the family estate called Greenwell Ford.<ref name="burke">{{cite book |author= Sir Bernard Burke |title=A genealogical and heraldic dictionary of the landed gentry of Great Britain & Ireland |volume=Volume 1 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=161CAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA543 |year= 1871 |publisher=Harrison |edition= 5th |page=543 }}</ref>
He attended [[Durham School]] and [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] expecting a military career.<ref>{{cite book |author= |title=A list of the Royal military college at Sandhurst |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DekGAAAAQAAJ |year=1844 |page=9}}</ref>

In 1844 Greenwell purchased a commission as a [[Lieutenant]] in the [[70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot|70th Regiment]] of the British Army which was stationed in [[Ireland]] during the [[great Famine (Ireland)|great Famine]].<ref>{{cite book |authhor=Richard Cannon |title=Historical Record of the Seventieth, or the Surrey Regiment of Foot|year=1849|location=London |publisher=Parker, Furnivall and Parker |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UjkX5H98svMC}}</ref> He became disenchanted, sold his commission in 1847 and on March 15, 1848, left for [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].  Arriving in June 1848, he traveled to [[Sydney]] looking for a sheep or cattle station, but came instead to [[California]] in 1849 for the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>{{cite journal |title= Journal of Henry Nicholas Greenwell  |publisher= Kona Historical Society archives }}</ref>
When the ship arrived in [[San Francisco]], the crew immediately left and headed for the gold fields, leaving him with goods he intended to sell.
To recover from an injury during the unloading, he sailed to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in January 1850.<ref>{{cite news |title= Article |author= [[Amy B. H. Greenwell]] |newspaper= Kona Echo |date= April 1, 1950 }}</ref>
After a brief time in [[Honolulu]] working at the H. J. Holdsworth store, he moved to [[Kailua-Kona]], and opened a retail store in the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona District]] in late 1850.<ref name="focus">{{cite web |title= Greenwell Store nomination form |author= John C.

In late 1852 one of his Chinese servants died after being accused of theft. Greenwell was arrested and charged with [[second degree murder]]. [[Asher B. Bates]] was prosecutor, [[William Little Lee]] judge, and a jury of British subjects was found for the trial in January 1853. Witnesses testified that Greenwell had beaten or whipped the man, but others said the man was already ill and that Greenwell treated his employees fairly.<ref>{{cite web |title= Supreme Court<U+2013>January term |date= January 8, 1853 |work=The Polynesian |url= http://clear.uhwo.hawaii.edu/grenwell2.html |publisher=provided by Center for Labor Education and Research, University of Hawaii |accessdate= July 18, 2010 }}</ref>
After half an hour the jury unanimously found him not guilty.<ref>{{cite web |title= Rex vs. Greenwell (1 Haw. 146) |year= 1853 |work= Hawaiian Reports, 1853: Supreme Court January Term |url= http://clear.uhwo.hawaii.edu/grenwell.html |accessdate= July 18, 2010 }}</ref>
The case formed a precedent still cited in the Hawaii state criminal code.<ref>{{cite web |title=

He became successful growing [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]]s to send to the expanding California market. However, in 1866 the crop was destroyed by [[blight]], so he looked to diversify.<ref>{{cite book |title=Transactions of the botanical society |volume=Volume ix |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w38FAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA83 |year=1868 |pages=83<U+2013>84}}</ref>
In 1867 on what would be a [[circumnavigation]] of the earth, he visited [[New Zealand]] and returned to England to visit family. On his return he picked up a new variety of Oranges in [[Brazil]], and ideas for other potential crops. He also met his future wife on the voyage.<ref name="focus"/>
Greenwell married Elizabeth Caroline Hall (1841<U+2013>1934) April 9, 1868 and had six sons, four daughters, and 23 grandchildren. The new crop being grown in this area was [[coffea]], the tree bearing the fruit made into "beans" for [[coffee]]. The first trees were brought to the Kona area by missionaries at nearby [[Kahikolu Church]] in the late 1820s.
The few earlier attempts had uneven results, but the Greenwell brand developed a reputation for consistent quality for [[Kona coffee]].<ref name="goto">{{cite article |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10524/432 |title=Ethnic Groups and the Coffee Industry in Hawaii |author=Baron Goto |year=1982 |volume=16 |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |pages= 112<U+2013>124 }}</ref>

Greenwell served as Collector of Customs at the port at [[Kealakekua Bay]], and as Postmaster and area School Superintendent.
A stone building was built just south of the wooden house, in the traditional land division (''[[ahupuaa|ahupua{{okina}}a]]'') known as Kalukalu (for a type of grass that grows there).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ulukau.org/cgi-bin/hpn?e=p&a=q&l=en&q=Kalukalu&d=HASH016fa64c73d8a34dee18adfd |title=lookup of Kalukalu |work= on Hawaiian place names |author= Lloyd J.

The Greenwell family traded in sheep skins and dairy products, eventually using the profits to buy more land in the area. Coffee only grows in a narrow elevation band, so drier areas above the usual cloud cover were used as pasture land for cattle, sheep, and horses.
Early in 1879, the royal physician [[Georges Phillipe Trousseau]] sold all of his holdings in Kona to Greenwell.<ref>{{cite article |url= http://hdl.handle.net/10524/329 |title= Doctor Georges Phillipe Trousseau, Royal Physician |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 25 |author= Jean Greenwell |year= 1991 |pages= 121<U+2013>145 |accessdate= July 11, 2010 }}</ref>
Other lands were purchased from the family of missionary [[John Davis Paris]].

Elizabeth Greenwell operated the store after his death, and many children and grandchildren became active in farming and ranching on the nearby lands. 

While the [[Reciprocity Treaty of 1875]] had caused most large Hawaii coffee plantations to convert to [[sugar plantations in Hawaii|sugarcane]], this was not practical in the steep Kona district. Instead, small plots were leased to individual families, often Chinese, Japanese, or Portuguese immigrants after their labor contracts on sugar plantations expired. Quality improved further with the introduction of the ''Guatemalan'' variety via [[Hermann A. Widemann]], which turned out to be well-adapted to higher elevations; it remains a popular variety through modern times.<ref name="goto"/>

First-born son William Henry Greenwell was born born at Kalukalu June 7, 1869.<ref name="Siddall1921">{{cite book|author=John William Siddall |title=Men of Hawaii: being a biographical reference library, complete and authentic, of the men of note and substantial achievement in the Hawaiian Islands |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4o8DAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA175 |year=1921 |publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |page=175}}</ref>

William H. Greenwell managed the business from 1891 until he died June 17, 1927 after an operation for [[apendicitis]].
William's wife Maud Annandale Johnstone (1883<U+2013>1976), named for [[Annandale|Annandale, Scotland]] where she was born, ran the store until the 1950s.
