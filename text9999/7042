==History==
===Falmouth Library, 1763-1786===

The library was "originally instituted, 1763"<ref>By laws of the proprietors of the Portland Library. 1806</ref> in Falmouth ([[History of Portland, Maine|later Portland]]), Maine. According to historian [[William Willis (mayor)|William Willis]]:
<blockquote>"In 1763, several gentlemen ... desirous of promoting the diffusion of useful knowledge, and extending the means of information, made some attempts to establish a library. In 1765 ... the first associates were Enoch Freeman, Benjamin Titcomb, Stephen Longfellow, Richard Codman, Edward Watts, Thomas Scales, Paul Prince, John Waite, Benjamin Waite, Enoch Ilsley, Jonathan Webb, Francis Waldo, Thomas Smith, Moses Pearson, James Gooding, Josiah Noyes, John Cox, Jeremiah Pote, Alexander Ross, Ebenezer Mayo, John Wiswall, Richard King, Jedediah Preble, Ephraim Jones, Stephen Waite, and John Waite, Jr. ... At the opening of the library in 1766, it contained but 93 volumes ... not one was printed in this country. ... We believe this to have been the first establishment of the kind in Maine. Not much addition was made to the books previous to the revolution."<ref>William Willis. The History of Portland, from its First Settlement, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BTszI7Zrv30C v.2].

During the American Revolution, the British [[Burning of Falmouth|sacked]] the town of Falmouth, along with its "old town-house, with the publick library."<ref>"Transactions of the Late War, Extracted from the British Annual Register, for 1776." American Recorder and the Charlestown Advertiser (Charlestown, Massachusetts), 03-21-1786</ref> By Willis' account, "in the destruction of the town, the little collection was widely dispersed and a number of the books lost: during the war its operations were entirely suspended until 1780, when an attempt was made to collect the fragments and restore them to use."<ref>Willis. 1833</ref> The library was "revived, 1786."<ref>By laws of the proprietors of the Portland Library. 1806</ref> The local newspaper announced the Falmouth Library Society was "re-established upon such principles and rules as to render it a very useful institution. New members have lately been added."<ref>Falmouth Gazette and Weekly Advertiser, 03-30-1786</ref> 

===Portland Library, 1787-1826===

After the town of Falmouth became "Portland" in 1786, the Falmouth Library Society became the "Portland Library Society."<ref>Cumberland Gazette, Oct. 2, 1789</ref> Several years later, the library was "re-established, 1806."<ref>By laws of the proprietors of the Portland Library. 1806</ref> Around 1826 the newly formed [[Portland Athenaeum]] bought the Portland Library for $1,640.<ref>"Portland Atheneum." Eastern Argus (Portland, Maine), 02-29-1828</ref> By 1828, the Athenaeum reported: "We received in the Portland Social Library between 1,600 and 1,700 volumes. ... In looking over the catalogue of the Portland Library, though it contained a large number of works of standard merit, and perhaps quite as large a proportion of works of this character, as are usually found in libraries formed as this has been, by small additions made from year to year, and thus made up of the popular reading of the time."<ref>The report continues, describing the Athenaeum's new acquisitions in 1828: "Among the works which have been added during the present year, are those of Sir Francis Bacon, of Locke, Johnson, Warburton, Addison, Goldsmith, Dryden, and a large and valuable selection from the old English Drama, a complete collection of the whole body of English poetry, from Chaucer to Cowper. ... No English library can be considered, we will not say complete, but even respectable, which does not contain the writings of the authors we have just named ...." Cf. "Portland Atheneum." Eastern Argus (Portland, Maine), 02-29-1828</ref>
