'''Lenore LaFount Romney''' (born '''Lenore LaFount''' [sometimes written '''Lafount'''], November 9, 1908&nbsp;<U+2013> July 7, 1998) was the wife of American businessman and politician [[George W. Romney]] and was [[first lady|First Lady of Michigan]] from 1963 to 1969.  She was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee for the [[United States Senate elections, 1970|U.S. Senate in 1970]] from Michigan.  Her youngest son, [[Mitt Romney]], is the former [[Governor of Massachusetts]] as well as a [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|U.S. presidential candidate in 2008]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|again in 2012]].

Lenore LaFount was born in [[Logan, Utah]], and raised in [[Salt Lake City]]. She went to [[Latter-day Saints High School]], where she developed an interest in drama and first met George Romney.  She attended the [[University of Utah]] and [[George Washington University]], graduating from the latter in 1929.  She studied acting at the [[American Laboratory Theatre]] in New York, then went to Hollywood where she became a [[bit player]] who appeared in a number of films with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].  Turning down a contract offer with them, she married George Romney in 1931.  The couple had four children together; she was a [[stay-at-home mother]], eventually living in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], while he became a success in business and politics.

Lenore Romney was a popular First Lady of Michigan and was a frequent speaker at events and before civic groups.  She was involved with many charitable, volunteer, and cultural organizations, including high positions with the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]], [[YWCA USA|YWCA]], and [[American Field Services]], and also was active in the [[LDS Church]] that she was a life-long member of.  She was an asset to [[George Romney presidential campaign, 1968|her husband's 1968 presidential campaign]]. Although a traditionalist, she was an advocate for the greater involvement of women in business and politics.

In 1970, she was urged by state Republican Party officials to run against popular, two-term Democratic incumbent [[Philip Hart]].  However, she struggled to establish herself as a serious candidate apart from her husband and failed to capture the support of conservatives within the party, only narrowly defeating State Senator [[Robert J. Huber]] in the party primary.  Her difficulties continued in the general election and she lost to Hart by a two-to-one margin.  She returned to volunteer activities during the 1970s, including stints on the boards of the [[National Center for Voluntary Action]] and the [[National Conference of Christians and Jews]], and gave speeches to various organizations.

==Acting career==
Encouraged by an aunt, LaFount moved to New York and enrolled in the [[American Laboratory Theatre]] to study acting, where she was taught [[Stanislavski's system]] under school co-founder [[Maria Ouspenskaya]].<ref name="ap-limelight"/><ref name="mahoney-95">Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 94<U+2013>96.</ref>  She found the experience inspiring.<ref name="mahoney-95"/>  In student productions there, she starred in the Shakespearean roles of [[Ophelia]] and [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] and also appeared in roles from Ibsen and Chekhov plays.<ref name="mahoney-95"/>  She received a performance award there in 1930.<ref name="whowho"/>  Talent scouts attending the productions were impressed, and she received an offer from the [[National Broadcasting Corporation]] to perform in a series of Shakespeare radio programs and from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to go to Hollywood under an apprentice actress contract.<ref name="mahoney-95"/><ref name="ap-limelight"/>  She decided on the latter, despite strenuous arguments against doing so from George,<ref name="mahoney-95"/> who had been visiting her on weekends.<ref name="time-1963"/>  By then, he had a job with [[Alcoa]], and arranged to be transferred to Los Angeles to be with her.<ref name="cby-367"/>  In September 1930, the couple became engaged.<ref name="mahoney-95"/>

After a few months in Hollywood, she had the opportunity to sign a three-year contract with MGM that was worth $50,000 if all the options were picked up.<ref name="mahoney-97"/>  However, she was dismayed by some of the seamier aspects of Hollywood and the acting life.<ref name="nytm-mav"/><ref name="nyt-lessons"/><ref name="mahoney-97"/>  Romney finally convinced her to go ahead with marriage and return to Washington,<ref name="nytm-mav">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60E15F6345D1A728DDDA10A94DA405B808AF1D3 | title=A Maverick Starts a New 'Crusade' | author=Raskin, A.H. | magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] | date=February 28, 1960 }}</ref> where he worked for Alcoa and the Aluminum Wares Association as a lobbyist,<ref name="cby-367">''Current Biography Yearbook 1958'', p. 367.</ref> earning $125 a month.<ref name="ap-limelight"/>

Although Lenore had been more independent than many women of the time, she later stated that she "never had any regrets about giving up movies."<ref name="real-llf"/>  Another time she said that she had never had a choice of both marriage and an acting career: "In an acting career, I would have been upstaging him, and he couldn't stand that.

Lenore LaFount married George Romney on July 2, 1931, at the [[Salt Lake Temple]].<ref name="mahoney-97"/>  Their wedding reception in the Chi Omega house at the University of Utah was attended by about four hundred guests.<ref name="mahoney-97"/>

In Washington, Lenore's cultural refinement and hosting skills helped him in his business career, and the couple met the Hoovers, the Roosevelts, and other prominent Washington figures.<ref name="bg-series-1"/><ref name="mahoney-103">Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 102<U+2013>105.</ref>  He often called upon her to host short-notice parties.<ref name="mahoney-103"/>  During 1933<U+2013>1934, Lenore hosted a 15-minute weekly program, ''Poetical Hitchhiking'', on Washington's famed radio station [[WTEM#WRC Radio|WRC]] where she selected and read the poems.<ref name="whowho"/><ref name="mahoney-103"/><ref name="ap-limelight"/>  (The staff announcer who introduced her was [[Arthur Godfrey]].<ref name="mahoney-103"/>)  She also directed student plays at George Washington University.<ref name="mahoney-103"/><ref name="ap-limelight"/>

The couple's first child, Margo Lynn (known as Lynn) was born in 1935,<ref name="mahoney-children"/> and Lenore became a [[stay-at-home mother]].<ref name="nyt-lessons"/>  A second daughter, Jane, followed in 1938.<ref name="mahoney-children"/>  In 1939, the family moved to [[Detroit, Michigan]], when George took a job with the [[Automobile Manufacturers Association]].<ref>Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', p. 109.</ref>  The couple's first son, [[G. Scott Romney|George Scott]] (known as G. Scott), was born in 1941.<ref name="mahoney-children"/>  The couple longed for another child, but doctors told them that Lenore's health would not permit it, and they began the process of adopting a child from Switzerland.<ref name="real-11"/>  However, Lenore became pregnant, and after a difficult pregnancy and delivery, [[Mitt Romney|Willard Mitt]] (known as Mitt) was born  in 1947.<ref name="real-11">Kranish; Helman, ''The Real Romney'', pp. 11<U+2013>12, 14.</ref><ref name="mahoney-children">Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 104, 113.</ref>  Lenore would subsequently refer to Mitt as her miracle baby.<ref name="real-11"/>

The family moved to affluent [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], in the early 1950s.<ref name="bg-series-1"/> In 1953, Lenore suffered another health crisis when a blood transfusion of the wrong type put her life in danger, but she recovered.<ref>Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 166<U+2013>167.</ref>  In 1954, George was named president and chairman of [[American Motors Corporation]].<ref name="nytm-mav"/>  She played golf until bad bursitis affected her, when she switched to swimming.<ref name="ap-limelight"/>  The couple spent summers at a cottage on the Canadian shore of [[Lake Huron]].<ref name="ap-limelight"/>

The couple's marriage reflected aspects of their personalities and courtship.  George was devoted to Lenore, and tried to bring her a flower every day, often a single rose with a love note.<ref name="ap-obit-b"/><ref name="real-18">Kranish; Helman, ''The Real Romney'', pp. 18<U+2013>19.</ref>  George was also a strong, blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will, but the more self-controlled Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him.<ref name="nyt-lessons"/><ref name="real-18"/>  The couple quarreled so much that their grandchildren would later nickname them "the Bickersons", but in the end, their closeness would allow them to settle arguments amicably.<ref name="real-18"/>  (Mitt would later show a more reserved, private, and controlled nature than George's, traits he got from Lenore.<ref name="nyt-lessons"/>)

==First Lady of Michigan==
When her husband decided to enter electoral politics by running for [[Governor of Michigan]] in 1962, Lenore Romney said she and the family supported him: "I know it will be difficult&nbsp;<U+2013> not easy. But we're all dedicated with him for better government."<ref name="nyt021162">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10D17F73D5B15768FDDA80994DA405B828AF1D3 | title=Romney Enters Race for Governorship of Michigan | first=Damon | last=Stetson | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 11, 1962 | page=1}}</ref>  She played a productive role in [[Michigan gubernatorial election, 1962|the 1962 campaign]], making speeches before groups of Republican women.<ref name="nyt-lessons"/>

Following George's victory in November 1962, Lenore became the state's [[First Lady]].  About her new role, she said her goal was to make "a real breakthrough in human relations by bringing people together as people&nbsp;<U+2013> just like George has enunciated.

While Lenore was a traditionalist who decried the [[women's liberation movement]] as being one of "strident voices", she was also an advocate for the involvement of women in business and politics.<ref name="nyt-lessons"/> By 1966, she was telling audiences around the state, "Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation?"<ref name="nyt-lessons"/>  She added that women "represent a reservoir of public service which has hardly been tapped."<ref name="wapo-tale"/>

She explicitly criticized the counterculture phrase "[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]", saying "What kind of a philosophy is that?"<ref name="nyt020768"/>  Instead she urged young people to "Think of something outside of yourselves.
