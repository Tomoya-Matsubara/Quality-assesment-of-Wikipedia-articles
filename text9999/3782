'''Stephen Percy "Steve" Harris''' (born 12 March 1956) is an [[England|English]] musician and songwriter, known as the [[bassist]], occasional [[keyboards|keyboardist]], [[backing vocals|backing vocalist]] and primary [[songwriter]] of the British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]]. He is the only member of Iron Maiden to have remained in the band since their inception and, along with guitarist [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], to have appeared on all of their albums. 

Although he had previously aspired to be a professional [[Association football|footballer]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=15}} he gained an interest in rock music in his early teens, following which he participated in two small pub bands, Gypsy's Kiss and Smiler, before forming Iron Maiden on Christmas Day 1975. Before Iron Maiden signed their contract with [[EMI]] in 1979, Harris worked as an [[Architecture|architectural]] [[technical drawing|draughtsman]] in the [[East End of London]] until he was made redundant, at which point he undertook a job as a [[street sweeper]].<ref name= "MH 30th">{{cite journal | title = Powerslave Driver | journal = Metal Hammer presents: Iron Maiden 30 Years of Metal Mayhem | year = 2005 | first = Dave | last = Ling | pages = 31<U+2013>34| id = | accessdate = 2011-09-21}}</ref>{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=114}} In addition to his role as the band's bass player and backing vocalist, Harris has undertaken many other roles for the group, such as producing and co-producing their albums, directing and editing their live videos and performing studio keyboards.

==Career==

{{Main|Iron Maiden}}

Initially Harris wanted to play drums,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=20}} but did not have enough space for a [[drum kit]] in his house and so decided on the [[bass guitar|bass]] instead.<ref name="earlydaysdvd">{{cite video|date= 23 November 2004|title=The History Of Iron Maiden <U+2013> Pt. 1: The Early Days|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony}}</ref> Entirely self-taught,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=14&p2_articleid=329 | title = Steve Harris as known by Janick Gers | accessdate = 2012-02-11 | publisher = ironmaiden.com | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100819095537/http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=14&p2_articleid=329 | archivedate = 2010-08-19}}</ref> his first bass was a copy of a [[Fender Precision Bass|Fender Precision model]] which cost him <U+00A3>40 in 1971.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=20}}

Just 10 months after he bought his first bass, Harris joined a band, initially known as ''Influence'' and later ''Gypsy's Kiss'', featuring Bob Verscoyle (lead vocals), Dave Smith (guitar) and drummer Paul Sears.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=21}} After a short number of gigs at the Cart and Horses pub in Maryland Point, Stratford and the Bridgehouse in Canning Town,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=23}} the band split up and Harris auditioned for a band called Smiler in February 1974.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=24}} In this outfit, Harris began writing his own songs and worked with future Iron Maiden members Dennis Wilcock and [[Doug Sampson]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=25}} but left the band after they refused to play his material, claiming it was too complicated.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=26}}

Upon leaving Smiler, Harris went on to create Iron Maiden on Christmas Day 1975,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=26}} with the band's name being inspired by the film ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=28}} Since their inception, Harris has been the band's principal composer and lyricist.<ref name="musicradar"/> His song writing typically showcases his trademark galloping bass patterns and progressive rock-influenced song with several time changes.<ref name="Blabbermouth Iron Maiden"/> Recently, Harris' songs have become more [[progressive rock|progressive]],<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Good Life | journal = Classic Rock | date = 2006-09-01 | first = Malcolm | last = Dome | issue = 97 | pages = 76| id = | accessdate = 2011-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Iron Maiden: War all the Time | journal = Metal Hammer | date = 2006-09-01 | first = Malcolm | last = Dome | issue = 157 | pages = 34<U+2013>40 }}</ref> and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] has commented that Harris now prefers contributing "lyrics and melodies and arranging" to other member's songs over writing alone.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Iron Maiden: Adrian Smith | journal = Total Guitar | date = 2010-12-01 | first = Joel | last = McIver | issue = 208 | pages = 40<U+2013>42 }}</ref> Harris frequently writes lyrics about mythology, history or topics inspired from books and films, for which Iron Maiden has become notable in sharp contrast to most other rock bands where the themes are typically sex, drugs and rebellion.<ref name= "MH 30th"/><ref>{{cite journal | title = Maiden at the Movies | journal = Metal Hammer presents: Iron Maiden 30 Years of Metal Mayhem | year = 2005 | first = Martin | last = Popoff | pages = 104<U+2013>105| id = | accessdate = 2011-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Iron Men | journal = Kerrang!

Steve has a way of hearing things and a tone that isn't normally associated with a bass, it's more like a rhythm guitar."<ref name= "MH 30th"/>

He mainly plays a specially-painted bass guitar, featured on every Iron Maiden album, which has gone through a total of four colour changes since he began using it.
