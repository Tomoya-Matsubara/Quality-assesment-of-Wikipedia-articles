In the aftermath of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939]], hundreds of thousands of Polish soldiers became prisoners in Soviet Union. Thousands of them would be executed; over 20,000 Polish military personnel and civilians perished in the  infamous [[Katyn massacre]].<ref name="Fischer">[[Benjamin B.

On [[September 17]] [[1939]] the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Red Army invaded the territory of Poland]] from the east. This invasion took place while Poland had already sustained serious defeats in the wake of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|attack on the country]] that started on [[September 1]] [[1939]]; thus Soviets moved to safeguard [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|their claims]] in accordance with the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].<ref name="PWN_KW">[[Encyklopedia PWN]] [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/33490_1.html 'KAMPANIA WRZE<U+015A>NIOWA 1939'], last retrieved on [[10 December]] [[2005]], Polish language</ref>

==First period (1939-1941)==
Poland and the Soviet Union never officially declared war on each other; the Soviets effectively broke off [[diplomatic relations]] when they withdrew recognition of the Polish government at the start of the invasion.<ref name="SCHULENBURG">See telegrams: [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/ns069.htm No. 317] of [[September 10]]: Schulenburg, the German ambassador in the Soviet Union, to the German Foreign Office.

As a result there was confusion over the status of soldiers taken captive and whether they qualified for treatment as PoWs. Jurists consider that the absence of a formal declaration of war does not absolve a power from the obligations of civilised conduct towards PoWs. On the contrary, failure to do so makes those involved, both leaders and operational subordinates, liable to charges of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity."</ref> The USSR refused to allow [[Red Cross]] supervision of prisoners on the grounds that it had not signed the [[Geneva Convention (1929)| 1929 Geneva Convention]] on the Treatment of PoWs and did not recognise the [[Hague Convention]]. Prisoners were handed over by the military to the [[NKVD]] and sentenced under clauses in the Soviet Penal Code, including treason and counter-revolution, and were not considered subject to the "Regulations for the Treatment of Prisoners of War" approved by the Soviet Council of Ministers.<ref>Sanford, p 25 and p 41.</ref>

As early as [[September 19]] [[1939]], the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and First Rank Commissar of State Security, [[Lavrenty Beria]], ordered the NKVD to create a Directorate for Prisoners of War<ref name="Fischer"/> (or USSR NKVD Board for Prisoners of War and Internees, headed by State Security Captain Pyotr Soprunenko<ref name="Miednoje_Katyn">[http://www.coldwarhistory.us/Cold_War/Katyn_Massacre/Miednoje__Katyn.htm "The grave unknown elsewhere or any time before ...

The NKVD took custody of Polish prisoners from the Red Army, and proceeded to organize a network of reception centers and transit camps and arrange rail transport to [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s in the western USSR. The camps were located at [[Jukhnovo]] ([[Babynino]] rail station), [[Yuzhe]] (Talitsy), [[Kozelsk]], [[Kozelshchyna]], [[Oranki]], [[Ostashkov]] ([[Stolbnyi Island]] on [[Seliger Lake]] near Ostashkov), [[Tyotkino]] rail station (56&nbsp;mi/90&nbsp;km from [[Putyvl]]), [[Starobielsk]], [[Vologda]] ([[Zaenikevo]] rail station) and [[Gryazovets]].<ref name="Miednoje_Katyn"/>

Kozelsk and Starobielsk were used mainly for [[military officer]]s, while Ostashkov was used mainly for [[ZHP|Boy Scout]]s, [[gendarmerie|gendarme]]s, [[police officer]]s and [[prison|prison officers]]. Prisoners at these camps were not exclusively military officers or members of the other groups mentioned, but also included Polish [[intelligentsia]]. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5,000; Ostashkov, 6,570; and Starobelsk, 4,000. They totalled 15,570 men.<ref name="Zawodny">[[Janusz K.

Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers such as [[Vasily Zarubin]]. The Poles were encouraged to believe they would be released,<ref name="diary">[http://www.polandsholocaust.org/katyndiary1.html "The Katyn Diary of Leon Gladun"], last accessed on [[19 December]] [[2005]], English translation of Polish document.

On [[March 5]] [[1940]], pursuant to a note to [[Joseph Stalin]] from [[Lavrenty Beria]], the members of the Soviet [[Politburo]] &mdash; Stalin, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Mikhail Kalinin]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Anastas Mikoyan]] and [[Lavrenty Beria|Beria]] &mdash; signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish "nationalists and counterrevolutionaries" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]].<ref name="kmw_resolution">Excerpt from the minutes No. 13 of the Politburo of the Central Committee meeting, shooting order of [[March 5]], [[1940]] [http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_resolution.html online], last accessed on [[19 December]] [[2005]], original in Russian with English translation</ref> This became known as the [[Katyn massacre]].<ref name="Fischer"/><ref name="Sanford"/>

==Second period (1941-1944)==
{{Details|Polish Armed Forces in the East}}
The diplomatic relations relations were however re-established in 1941 after [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] forced [[Stalin]] to look for allies. Thus the military agreement from August 14 and subsequent [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]] from August 17, 1941, resulted in Stalin agreeing to declare the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] in relation to Poland [[null and void]],<ref name="F-N">"In relation to Poland the effects of the pact have been [[wiktionary:abrogate|abrogated]] on the basis of the Sikorski-Mayski agreement".<br>Ren<U+00E9> Lefeber, Malgosia Fitzmaurice, ''The Changing Political Structure of Europe: aspects of International law'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, ISBN 0792313798, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0792313798&id=oGGSGhFbCDEC&pg=PA101&lpg=PA101&ots=oMTzLEUFfB&dq=Sikorski-Mayski+null+and+void&sig=MU4kcmGL_ZuTCrwpZTBXPgztXYM Google Print, p.101]</ref> and release tens of thousands of Polish [[prisoners-of-war]] held in Soviet camps. Pursuant to an agreement between the [[Polish government-in-exile]] and Stalin, the Soviets granted "[[amnesty]]" to many Polish citizens, from whom a military force was formed. Stalin also agreed that this military force would be subordinate to the [[Polish government-in-exile]]. This force was known as the [[Anders Army]]. From 1943 Poles were recruited to the [[Berling Army]].

==Third period (after 1944)==
Third group of Polish prisoners were members of Polish resistance organizations ([[Armia Krajowa]], ''[[cursed soldiers]]'') loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]] and seen by Soviets as threat to their estabilishment of power base in 'liberated' Poland. Relatively few were sent to Soviet Union (although there were notable exceptions, see [[Trial of the Sixteen]]); most were transferred to the Polish communist security forces and prisons, or enlisted in the [[Berling Army]].
