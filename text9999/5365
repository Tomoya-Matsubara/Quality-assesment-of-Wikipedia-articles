Sir '''Roderick Impey Murchison, 1st Baronet''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Linnaean Society of London|FLS]] [[President of the Royal Geographical Society|PRGS]] [[President of the British Association|PBA]] [[Member of the Royal Irish Academy|MRIA]] (22 February 1792<ref>{{cite journal|last=Amodeo|first=Christian|date=June 2005|title=Sir Roderick Impey Murchison: Pioneering Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison was instrumental in the identification and naming of several geological time periods|journal=Geographical|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3120/is_6_77/ai_n29183161/}}</ref> <U+2013> 22 October 1871) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[geologist]] who first described and investigated the [[Silurian]] system.

==Early life and work==

[[File:Roderick Impey Murchison.jpg|right|thumbnail|Sir Roderick Impey Murchison posing with cane, not dated]]

Murchison was born at [[Tarradale House]], [[Muir of Ord]], [[Ross-shire]], the son of Kenneth Murchison. His wealthy father died in 1796, when Roderick was 4 years old, and he was sent to [[Durham School]] 3 years later,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bonney|first=T. G.|authorlink= |coauthors= rev. Robert A.

In 1808 he landed with [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellesley]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and was present at the actions of [[Battle of Roli<U+00E7>a|Roli<U+00E7>a]] and [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeiro]].  Subsequently under Sir [[John Moore (British soldier)|John Moore]], he took part in the retreat to [[A Coru<U+00F1>a (province)|Corunna]] and the final battle there.

After eight years of service Murchison left the army, and married Charlotte Hugonin (8 April 1788 <U+2013> 9 February 1869), the only daughter of General Hugonin, of Nursted House, Hampshire.  Murchison and his wife spent two years in [[mainland Europe]], particularly in [[Italy]]. They then settled in [[Barnard Castle]], County Durham, England in 1818 where Murchison made the acquaintance of Sir [[Humphry Davy]].  Davy urged Murchison to turn his energy to science, after hearing that he wasted his time riding to hounds and shooting.  Murchison became fascinated by the young science of geology and joined the [[Geological Society of London]], soon becoming one of its most active members. His colleagues there included [[Adam Sedgwick]], [[William Conybeare]], [[William Buckland]], [[William Henry Fitton|William Fitton]], [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Charles Darwin]].

Exploring with his wife, Murchison studied the geology of the south of England, devoting special attention to the rocks of the north-west of [[Sussex]] and the adjoining parts of [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]], on which, aided by Fitton, he wrote his first scientific paper, read to the Geological Society of London in 1825. Turning his attention to Continental geology, he and Lyell explored the volcanic region of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], parts of southern [[France]], northern [[Italy]], [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Switzerland]]. A little later, with Sedgwick as his companion, Murchison attacked the difficult problem of the geological structure of the [[Alps]].  Their joint paper giving the results of their study is a classic in the literature of Alpine geology.

==Silurian system==
[[File:Silurianfishes ntm 1905 smit 1929.gif|thumb|left|Artist's impression of Silurian fish]]
In 1831 he went to the [[Wales-England border|border of England and Wales]], to attempt to discover whether the [[greywacke]] rocks underlying the [[Old Red Sandstone]] could be grouped into a definite order of succession. The result was the establishment of the [[Silurian]] system under which were grouped, for the first time, a remarkable series of formations, each replete with distinctive organic remains other than and very different from those of the other rocks of England. These researches, together with descriptions of the [[South Wales coalfield|coalfields]] and overlying formations in [[South Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|English border counties]], were embodied in ''The Silurian System'' (1839).

The establishment of the Silurian system was followed by that of the [[Devonian]] system, an investigation in which Murchison assisted, both in the south-west of England and in the [[Rhineland]]. Soon afterwards Murchison projected an important geological campaign in [[Russia]] with the view of extending to that part of the Continent the classification he had succeeded in elaborating for the older rocks of western Europe. He was accompanied by [[Edouard de Verneuil]] (1805<U+2013>1873) and Count [[Alexander von Keyserling]] (1815<U+2013>1891), in conjunction with whom he produced a work on Russia and the [[Ural Mountains]]. The publication of this monograph in 1845 completes the first and most active half of Murchison<U+2019>s scientific career.

In 1846 he was knighted, and in the same year he presided over the meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] at [[Southampton]]. During the later years of his life a large part of his time was devoted to the affairs of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], of which he was in 1830 one of the founders, and he was president 1843-1845, 1851<U+2013>1853, 1856<U+2013>1859 and 1862-1871. He served on the [[Royal Commission on the British Museum]] (1847<U+2013>49).<ref>''The Life of Sir Anthony Panizzi'', Volume 1, by Louis Alexander Fagan, p257</ref>

==Scotland==
[[File:Roderick Impey Murchison, 1st Baronet.jpg|thumb|left|]]
The chief geological investigation of the last decade of his life was devoted to the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] of Scotland, where he wrongly believed he had succeeded in showing that the vast masses of crystalline [[schist]]s, previously supposed to be part of what used to be termed the Primitive formations, were really not older than the Silurian period, for that underneath them lay beds of [[limestone]] and [[quartzite]] containing Lower Silurian ([[Cambrian]]) [[fossils]]. [[James Nicol]] recognised the fallacy in the Murchison's extant theory and propounded his own ideas, in the 1880s these were superseded by the correct theory of [[Charles Lapworth]], which was corroborated by [[Ben Peach|Benjamin Peach]] and [[John Horne]]. Their subsequent research showed that the infraposition of the fossiliferous rocks is not their original place, but had been brought about by a gigantic system of dislocations, whereby successive masses of the oldest [[gneiss]]es, have been torn up from below and thrust bodily over the younger formations.

In 1855 Murchison was appointed director-general of the [[British Geological Survey]] and director of the [[Royal School of Mines]] and the [[Museum of Practical Geology]] in Jermyn Street, [[London]], in succession to Sir [[Henry De la Beche]], who had been the first to hold these offices. Official routine now occupied much of his time, but he found opportunity for the Highland researches just alluded to, and also for preparing successive editions of his work ''Siluria'' (1854, ed. 5, 1872), which was meant to present the main features of the original Silurian System together with a digest of subsequent discoveries, particularly of those that showed the extension of the Silurian classification into other countries.

==Later life==

[[File:RoderickMurchisonBrompton.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London]]

In 1863 he was made a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]], and three years later was created a [[baronet]]. The learned societies of his own country bestowed their highest rewards upon him: the [[Royal Society]] gave him the [[Copley Medal|Copley medal]], the Geological Society its [[Wollaston Medal|Wollaston medal]], and the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] its [[Brisbane Medal]]. There was hardly a foreign scientific society of note without his name among its honorary members. The [[French Academy of Sciences]] awarded him the prix Cuvier, and elected him one of its eight foreign members in succession to [[Michael Faraday]]. In 1855, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

One of the closing public acts of Murchison<U+2019>s life was the founding of a chair of geology and mineralogy at the [[University of Edinburgh]].  Under his will there was established the [[Murchison Medal]] and a geological fund ([[The Murchison Fund]]) to be awarded annually by the council of the Geological Society in London.

Murchison died in 1871, and is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London.

==Legacy==
The crater [[Murchison (crater)|Murchison]] on the [[Moon]] and at least fifteen geographical locations on Earth are named after him.

These include: Mount Murchison in the [[Mountaineer Range]], Antarctica; Mount Murchison, just west of [[Squamish, British Columbia]], [[Canada]]; tiny Murchison Island in the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]] <!--little more than a ref or rock--> in the same province; [[Murchison Falls National Park|Murchison Falls (Uganda)]]; and the [[Murchison River (Western Australia)|Murchison River]] in Western Australia.<ref>[http://srmwww.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=8298 BCGNIS listing "Mount Murchison"]</ref> Unusually, Murchison has two other rivers named after him in Western Australia: the Roderick River and the [[Impey River]], both tributaries of the Murchison.

===Memorials===
[[File:Memorial tablet of Roderick Murchison at the School 9 in Perm.jpg|thumb|Memorial tablet]]
A memorial tablet of Murchison was installed on 3 November 2005, in front of School #9 in [[Perm]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://perm.rfn.ru/rnews.html?id=14621|language=Russian|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> It consists of a stone base, irregular in form, about 2 meters long and bearing a dark stone plate with the inscription:
{{quotation|
To Roderick Impey Murchison, Scottish geologist, explorer of Perm Krai,
who gives to the last period of Paleozoic era the name of Perm.
}}
The decision to perpetuate the explorer's name was accepted by the school administration and pupils in connection with a discussion to establish in Perm a pillar or an arch devoted to Roderick Murchison.

In 2009, the [[Ural-Scottish Society]] erected a memorial to Murchison on the banks of the [[Chusovaya River]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/russianow/4798366/The-Urals-remember-Sir-Roderick-Murchison.html|title=A memorial to Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, the Scottish geologist who established the Permian archaeological period of the Mesozoic Era, has been unveiled on the bank of the Chusovaya River in the Ural Mountains|date=24 February 2009|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

There is a commemorative 'blue plaque' on his residence in Barnard Castle (County Durham) at 21 Galgate.
