'''''Scarabaeus sacer''''' is a [[species]] of [[dung beetle]] belonging to the family [[Scarabaeidae]]. 

==Taxonomy==
''Scarabaeus sacer'' was described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1758 [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]] of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', the starting point of [[zoological nomenclature]]. It has since been treated by "the vast majority of authors" as the [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Scarabaeus]]'', even though strict application of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] would require ''Scarabaeus hercules'' (now usually called ''[[Dynastes hercules]]'') to be the type species, following [[Pierre Andr<U+00E9> Latreille]]'s 1810 type designation.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Trist<U+00E3>o Branco |year=2007 |title=Scarabaeoidea (Coleoptera) of Portugal: genus-group names and their type species |journal=[[Zootaxa]] |volume=1453 |pages=1<U+2013>31 |url=http://www.bio-nica.info/biblioteca/Branco2007.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Scarabaeus sacer'' occurs in coastal dunes and marshes around the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. 
It can be found across [[North Africa]], [[southern Europe]] and parts of [[Asia]] ([[Afghanistan]], [[Corsica]], [[Cyprus]], [[Ethiopia]], [[France]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Morocco]], [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Sudan]] and [[Syria]]). <ref>[http://www.biolib.cz/en/taxon/id55440/ Biolib] </ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Scarabaeidae |title=Scarabaeidae.

==Description==
The head of ''Scarabaeus sacer'' has a distinctive array of six projections, resembling rays.<ref>{{cite book |editor=George Long |year=1836 |title=The British Museum: Egyptian antiquities, Volume 2 |publisher=Knight |chapter=On the sacred animals of Egypt |pages=286<U+2013>319 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CGkoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA314}}</ref> The projections are uniform with four more projections on each of the [[tibia]]e of the front legs, creating an arc of fourteen "rays" (see illustration). Functionally the projections are adaptations for digging and for shaping the ball of dung.

Like the front legs of other beetles of its genus, but unlike those of dung beetles in most other genera, the front legs of ''Scarabaeus sacer'' are unusual; they do not end in any recognisable [[Arthropod leg|tarsus]], the foot that bears the claws.<ref name=GJA>Arrow, Gilbert John, 1873-1948. Coleoptera: Lamellicornia part 1. Publisher: London, Taylor and Francis. 1910. Download from: [http://archive.org/details/coleopteralamell01arro]</ref> There is only a [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] claw-like structure that might be of some assistance in digging. The mid- and hind-legs of ''Scarabaeus'' have normal, well-developed 5-segmented tarsi, but the front legs are specialised for excavation and for forming balls of dung.

==Life cycle and ecology==
[[File: Scarabaeidae - Scarabaeus sacer.JPG|thumb|250px|left|''Scarabaeus sacer'' rolling a ball of dung]] Among the [[Coprophagia#In plants and animals|coprophagous]] species of beetles, ''Scarabaeus sacer'' is typical of those that collect dung into balls. Such a beetle rolls its ball to a suitable location, where it digs an underground chamber in which it hides the ball. It then either eats the ball itself, a process that may take several days.

When the female is ready to breed she selects especially fine-textured dung to make her breeding ball, and digs an especially deep and large chamber for it. There she sculpts it into a pear-shape with a hollow cavity in the narrow part. In that cavity she lays a single large egg. She then seals the cavity and departs to repeat the process elsewhere. Typically a successful female ''Scarabaeus sacer'' will produce only about half a dozen young in her life.<ref name=JHFSB>{{cite web |last=Fabre |first=J. Henri |title= Translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos; The Sacred Beetle and Others. Dodd, Mead, New York, 1918 |url=http://archive.org/search.php?query=Henri%20Fabre%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts}}</ref> The [[larva]] feeds on the ball of dung after the egg hatches. 

''Scarabaeus sacer'' serves as the host for the [[phoretic]] [[mite]] ''[[Macrocheles saceri]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=G. W.

''Scarabaeus sacer'' is the most famous of the [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Maurice Burton & Robert Burton |year=2002 |series=The International Wildlife Encyclopedia |title=Volume 16 |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]] |isbn=978-0-7614-7282-7 |chapter=Scarab beetle |pages=2252<U+2013>2254 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4QQCfJnu_6oC&pg=PA2252
}}</ref> To the [[Ancient Egyptians]], ''S. sacer'' was a symbol of [[Khepri]], the early morning manifestation of the sun god [[Ra]], from an analogy between the beetle's behaviour of rolling a ball of dung across the ground and Khepri's task of rolling the sun across the sky.<ref name="Remler">{{cite book |author=Pat Remler |year=2010 |title=Egyptian Mythology A to Z |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-60413-926-6 |chapter=Scarab beetle |pages=169<U+2013>171 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wLUjtPDyu-IC&pg=PT185}}</ref> They accordingly held the species to be [[sacred]].

The Egyptians also observed young beetles emerging from the ball of dung, from which they mistakenly inferred that the female beetle was able to reproduce without needing a male. From this, they drew parallels with their god [[Atum]], who also begat children alone.<ref name="Remler"/>

''Scarabaeus sacer'' was the species which first piqued the interest of [[William Sharp Macleay]] and drew him into a career in [[entomology]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert Patterson |year=1838 |title=Letters on the natural history of the insects mentioned in Shakspeare's plays, with incidental notices of the entomology of Ireland |publisher=W.
