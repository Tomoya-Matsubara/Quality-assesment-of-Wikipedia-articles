The first game of the ''Driver'' series was released [[June 30]], [[1999]] in the US, and [[March 9]], [[2000]] in Japan for the PlayStation, and [[September 10]], [[2000]] in the US, and [[October 13]], [[2000]] in Europe for PC. You play as an undercover police officer named Tanner. It featured a storyline based in four real-life cities; Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. The game was set in the 1970s. This game was the best selling game of the Driver series of games.

The second installment was only released for PlayStation, by [[Infogrames]] (now known as Atari), and later ported to the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It came out on [[November 13]], [[2000]] in the US, and four days later, [[November 17]] in Europe. It featured Tanner once more, in four real-life cities, which were Chicago, Havana, Las Vegas and Rio De Janeiro. It was also the first in the series to feature the ability to get out of your car at any time in order to steal another car on the street.

The third edition of Tanner's story was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox]] on [[June 21]], [[2004]] in the [[United States]] and officially on [[June 25]] in [[Europe]] to generally poor reviews. This game takes place in Miami, Nice and Istanbul. It was subsequently followed by versions for the [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage]] and a GameBoy Advance version.

The game sold rather well despite poor reviews, and Reflections paid notice to the complaints about the insipid story line, poor controls, and abundance of glitches in order to improve the series' standings with critics and gamers in the [[Driver (video game)#Driver: Parallel Lines|fourth installment]] of the series.

==Driver Vegas==
:''Main article: [[Driver Vegas]]
A mobile exclusive game featuring Tanner, the protagonist of Driver, Driver 2 and Driv3r, which features his exploits in Vegas in an attempt to extract revenge on Jericho.

==''Driver: Parallel Lines''==
:''Main article: [[Driver: Parallel Lines]]''
The fourth game in the series, ''Driver: Parallel Lines'', was released [[March 14]], [[2006]]. Reflections intended ''Parallel Lines'' to "return the series to its roots" by focusing more on driving. The game differs greatly in other apects from its predecessors, though, as the story no longer follows undercover cop Tanner and the game takes place in only one location, [[New York City]]. The game includes two time periods, 1978 and 2006. [[Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]] versions have been released, a rumor stated that a [[PlayStation Portable]] version was going to be created but it was proven to be fake by Reflections. {{cite needed}}
