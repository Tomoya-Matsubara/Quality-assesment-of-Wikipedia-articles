'''Paul Warfield Tibbets, Jr.''' (February 23, 1915 <U+2013> November 1, 2007) was a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Air Force]], best known as the pilot of the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' <U+2013> named for his mother <U+2013> the first aircraft to drop an [[atomic bomb]] in the history of warfare. The bomb, code-named [[Little Boy]], was dropped on the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]].

Tibbets enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in 1937 and qualified as a pilot in 1938. After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] he flew anti-submarine patrols over the Atlantic. In February 1942, he became the commanding officer of the [[340th Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[97th Bombardment Group]], which was equipped with the [[Boeing B-17]]. In July 1942 the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group to be deployed as part of the [[Eighth Air Force]], and Tibbets became deputy group commander. He flew the lead plane in the first American daylight heavy bomber mission against [[Occupied Europe]] on August 17, 1942, and the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe on October 9, 1942. Tibbets was chosen to fly Major General [[Mark W. Clark]] and [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to Gibraltar. After flying 43 combat missions, he became the assistant for bomber operations on the staff of the [[Twelfth Air Force]].

Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943 to help with the development of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]. In September 1944, he was appointed the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], which would conduct the [[bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. After the war, he participated in the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear weapon]] tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in mid-1946, and was involved in the development of the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] in the early 1950s. He commanded the [[308th Armament Systems Wing|308th Bombardment Wing]] and [[6th Air Division]] in the late 1950s, and was [[military attach<U+00E9>]] in India from 1964 to 1966. After leaving the Air Force in 1966, he worked for [[NetJets|Executive Jet Aviation]], serving as its president from 1976 until his retirement in 1987.

==Early life==
Paul Warfield Tibbets, Jr., was born in [[Quincy, Illinois]], the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets, Sr., and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old, the family moved to [[Davenport, Iowa]], and then to Iowa's capital, [[Des Moines]], where Paul Jr. was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to [[Miami, Florida]], to escape from harsh [[midwest]]ern winters. Young Paul was very interested in flying. One day his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by [[Barnstorming|barnstormer]] Doug Davis, dropping candy bars with tiny parachutes to the crowd of people attending the races at the [[Hialeah Park Race Track]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153<U+2013>155}}{{sfn|Marx|1967|p=79}}

In the late 1920s, business issues forced Tibbets's family to return to [[Alton, Illinois]], where he graduated from [[Western Military Academy]] in 1933. He then attended the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]],{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153<U+2013>155}} and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of [[Sigma Nu]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] in 1934.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=33}} During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's [[Opa-locka Airport]] with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at [[Eastern Airlines]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=33}} After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the [[University of Cincinnati]] after his second year to complete his [[pre-med]] studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he only attended for a year and a half as he changed his mind about wanting to becoming a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the [[United States Army]] and become a pilot in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153<U+2013>155}}

==Early military career==
Because he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|Aviation Cadet Training Program]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=41}} On February 25, 1937, he enlisted in the army at [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky]], and was sent to [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph Field]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, his performance showed he was an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] and received his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating#Air Corps, World War II, Cold War and Post-Cold War changes|pilot rating]] in 1938 at [[Kelly Air Force Base|Kelly Field]], Texas.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153<U+2013>155}}

After graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the [[16th Electronic Warfare Squadron|16th Observation Squadron]], which was based at [[Lawson Field]], Georgia, with a flight supporting the [[Infantry School]] at nearby [[Fort Benning]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153<U+2013>155}} It was here that he met Lucy Wingate, a clerk at a department store in [[Columbus, Georgia]]. The two quietly married in a Catholic seminary in [[Holy Trinity, Alabama]], on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local paper.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=52<U+2013>53}} They had three sons, Paul III, Gene and James.<ref name="death1"/> While stationed at Fort Benning, Tibbets was promoted to [[first lieutenant]],{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=65}} and served as a personal pilot for [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[George S. Patton, Jr.]], in 1940 and 1941.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153<U+2013>155}}

In June 1941, Tibbets transferred to the [[9th Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[3d Bombardment Group]] at [[Hunter Air Force Base|Hunter Field]], [[Savannah, Georgia]], as the engineering officer, and flew the [[A-20 Havoc]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=62<U+2013>63}}  While there he was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]. In December 1941, he received orders to join the [[29th Bombardment Group]] at [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Field]], Florida, for training on the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]. On December 7, 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] while listening to the radio during a routine flight.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=65}} Due to fears that German [[U-Boats]] might enter [[Tampa Bay]] and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=66<U+2013>67}} Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at [[Pope Air Force Base|Pope Army Airfield]], North Carolina, with 21 [[B-18 Bolo]] medium bombers.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153<U+2013>155}} The B-18s were used as an intermediate trainer, which pilots flew after basic flight training in a [[Cessna UC-78]] and before qualifying in the B-17.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=70}}

==War against Germany==
[[File:Boeing B-17D in flight.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing B-17D in flight|alt=A four-engine propeller aircraft]]
In February 1942, Tibbets reported for duty with the 29th Bombardment Group as its engineering officer. Three weeks later he was named the commanding officer of the [[340th Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[97th Bombardment Group]], equipped with the B-17D.<ref name="USAF">{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/Biographies/Display/tabid/225/Article/105458/brigadier-general-paul-w-tibbets-jr.aspx |title=Brigadier General Paul W. Tibbets, Jr. |publisher=United States Air Force |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref> It was initially based at MacDill, and then [[Sarasota Army Airfield]], Florida, before moving to [[Godfrey Army Airfield]] in [[Bangor, Maine]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=70<U+2013>73}}

In July 1942 the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group of the [[Eighth Air Force]] to be deployed to England, where it was based at [[RAF Polebrook]].{{sfn|Goldberg|1948|pp=639<U+2013>645}} It had been hastily assembled to meet demands for an early deployment, and arrived without any training in the basics of high altitude daylight bombing. In the first weeks of August 1942, under the tutelage of [[Royal Air Force]] veterans, the group received intensive training for its first mission. The group commander,  [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Cornelius W. Cousland,{{sfn|Goldberg|1948|pp=656<U+2013>657}} was replaced by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Frank A. Armstrong, Jr.]], who appointed Tibbets as his deputy.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=79}}

Tibbets flew the lead bomber ''Butcher Shop'' for the first American daylight heavy bomber mission on August 17, 1942, a shallow penetration raid against a [[marshalling yard]] in [[Rouen]] in [[Occupied France]], with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, ''Red Gremlin'', nor his regular crew, which included [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] [[Thomas Ferebee]] and navigator [[Theodore Van Kirk]], who later flew with him in ''Enola Gay''.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=81<U+2013>82}} On October 9, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of [[Lille]]. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=155<U+2013>156}}{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=96<U+2013>99}}

In the lead up to [[Operation Torch]], the Allied invasion of [[North Africa]], the commander of the Eighth Air Force, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Carl Spaatz]] was ordered to provide his best two pilots for a secret mission. He chose Tibbets and Major Wayne Connors. Tibbets flew Major General [[Mark W. Clark]] from Polebook to [[Gibraltar]] while Connors flew Clark's chief of staff, Brigadier General [[Lyman Lemnitzer]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=102<U+2013>105}} A few weeks later Tibbets flew the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], there.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=107<U+2013>109}}  "By reputation", historian [[Stephen Ambrose]] wrote, Tibbets was "the best flier in the Army Air Force".{{sfn|Ambrose|1998|p=40}}

After Tibbets had flown 25 combat missions against targets in France,<ref name="USAF"/> the 97th Bomb Group was transferred to North Africa as part of Major General [[Jimmy Doolittle]]'s [[Twelfth Air Force]]. For Tibbets, the war in North Africa introduced him to the realities of aerial warfare. He claimed that he saw the real effects of bombing civilians and the trauma of losing of his brothers in arms. In January 1943, Tibbets, who had now flown 43 combat missions,{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=157<U+2013>158}} was assigned as the assistant for bomber operations to Colonel [[Lauris Norstad]], Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force.<ref name="USAF"/> Tibbets had recently been given a battlefield promotion to [[colonel]], but did not receive it, as such promotions had to be confirmed by a panel of officers. He was told that Norstad had vetoed the promotion, saying "there's only going to be one colonel in operations".{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=129}}

Tibbets did not get along well with Norstad, or with Doolittle's chief of staff, Brigadier General [[Hoyt Vandenberg]]. In one planning meeting, Norstad wanted an all-out raid on [[Bizerte]] to be flown at {{convert|6000|ft}}. Tibbets protested that [[flak]] would be most effective at that altitude. When challenged by Norstad, Tibbets said he would lead the mission himself at 6,000 feet if Norstad would fly as his co-pilot. Norstad backed down, and the mission was successfully flown at {{convert|20000|ft}}.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=129<U+2013>132}}

==War against Japan==
[[File:Tibbets-wave.jpg|thumb|upright|Tibbets waves from ''Enola Gay'' before the Hiroshima bombing mission.|alt=A man waves from the cockpit window of a plane with the words "Enola Gay" written on it]]
When [[General (United States)|General]] [[Henry H. Arnold]], the Chief of [[United States Army Air Forces]], requested an experienced bombardment pilot to help with the development of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bomber, Doolittle recommended Tibbets.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=133}} Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943. At the time, the B-29 program was beset by a host of technical problems, and the chief test pilot, [[Edmund T. Allen]], had been killed in a crash of the prototype aircraft.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=140}}

Working with [[Spirit AeroSystems|the Boeing plant]] in [[Witchita, Kansas]], Tibbets test flew the B-29, and soon accumulated more flight time in it than any other pilot. He found that without defensive armament and armor plating, the aircraft was {{convert|7000|lb}} lighter, and its performance was much improved. In simulated combat engagements against a [[P-47]] fighter at the B-29's cruising altitude of {{convert|30000|ft}}, he discovered that the B-29 had a shorter turning radius than the P-47, and could avoid it by turning away.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=158<U+2013>159}}{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=149<U+2013>150}}

After a year of development testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the [[17th Air Division|17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy)]], a B-29 training unit based at [[Grand Island Army Airfield|Grand Island Army Air Field]], Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition pilots to the B-29.<ref name="USAF"/> Tibbets taught two [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]], [[Dora Dougherty Strother|Dora Dougherty]] and Dorothea (Didi) Moorman, to fly the B-29 as demonstration pilots.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=152<U+2013>155}}

On September 1, 1944, Tibbets reported to [[Colorado Springs Army Airfield]], the headquarters of the [[Second Air Force]], where he met with its commander, Major General [[Uzal Ent]], and three representatives of the [[Manhattan Project]], Lieutenant Colonel [[John Lansdale, Jr.]], [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]] and [[Norman F. Ramsey, Jr.]], who briefed him on the project.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=583<U+2013>584}} Tibbets was told that he would be in charge of the [[509th Composite Group]], a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and a high priority for all kinds of [[materiel|military stores]]. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: [[Great Bend Army Airfield]], Kansas; [[Mountain Home Army Airfield]], Idaho; or [[Wendover Army Air Field]], Utah.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=157<U+2013>163}} Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=167<U+2013>168}}

When the operation was still in the development stage the leading candidates to command the group designated to drop the [[atomic bomb]] had been Armstrong and Colonel [[Roscoe C. Wilson]], the Army Air Force project officer providing liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Although an experienced combat veteran against German targets, Armstrong was in his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943, while Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily by his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations, and was already an experienced B-29 pilot, thus making him an ideal candidate.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|p=160}}

[[File:Tinian Joint Chiefs.jpg|thumb|left|The "Tinian Joint Chiefs": Rear Admiral [[William R. Purnell]], Brigadier General [[Thomas F. Farrell]], Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, and Captain [[William S. Parsons]]|alt=Four men in rumpled fatigues sit on the ground. Tibbets is wearing shorts.]]
Tibbets, who received promotion to colonel in January 1945,{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=165}} brought his wife and family along with him to Wendover. He felt that allowing married men in the group to bring their families would improve morale, although it put a strain on his own marriage. To explain all the civilian engineers on base who were working on the Manhattan Project, he had to lie to his wife, telling her that the engineers were "sanitary workers". At one point Tibbets found that Lucy had co-opted a scientist to unplug a drain.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=173}}

On March 6, 1945, concurrent with the activation of [[Project Alberta]], the 1st Ordnance Squadron, Special (Aviation) was activated at Wendover, again using Army Air Forces personnel on hand or already at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Its purpose was to provide "skilled machinists, welders and munitions workers"{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|p=1}} and special equipment to the group to enable it to assemble atomic weapons at its operating base, thereby allowing the weapons to be transported more safely in their component parts. A rigorous candidate selection process was used to recruit personnel, reportedly with an 80% "washout" rate. Not until May 1945 did the 509th Composite Group reach full strength.{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|pp=12<U+2013>13}}

With the addition of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to [[Tinian]], an island in the northern [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] within striking distance of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island:{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=25}} the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]], and [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William R. Purnell]] of the [[Military Policy Committee]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=100}}

The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on April 26, 1945, to its port of embarkation at [[Seattle]], Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS ''Cape Victory'' for the Marianas, while the group's materiel was shipped on the SS ''Emile Berliner''.{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|pp=15<U+2013>18}} An advance party of the air echelon flew by C-54 to [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field, Tinian]], between May 15 and 22,{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|pp=19<U+2013>22}} where it was joined by the ground echelon on May 29, 1945.<ref name="509timeline">{{cite web | coauthors = | url =http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/CG/CG_09C.htm| title = 509th Timeline: Inception to Hiroshima| publisher=Children of the Manhattan Proj ect| accessdate =July 26, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060617223231/http://childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/CG/CG_09C.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 17, 2006}}</ref> Project Alberta's "Destination Team" also sent most of its members to Tinian to supervise the assembly, loading, and dropping of the bombs under the administrative title of 1st Technical Services Detachment, Miscellaneous War Department Group.{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|p=25}}<ref name="comp1tsd">{{cite web | coauthors = | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07a2.htm| title = 509th CG Activation and Organization| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate =May 5, 2007}}</ref>

On August 5, 1945, Tibbets formally named his B-29 ''[[Enola Gay]]'' after his mother.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=382<U+2013>383}} ''Enola Gay'' had been personally selected by him while it was still on the [[assembly line]] at the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] plant in [[Bellevue, Nebraska]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191<U+2013>192}} The regularly assigned aircraft commander, [[Robert A. Lewis]], was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of August 6 to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis would fly the mission as Tibbets's co-pilot.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=382<U+2013>383}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=702<U+2013>704}}

At 02:45 the next day, the ''Enola Gay'' departed North Field for [[Hiroshima, Japan]], with Tibbets at the controls. Tinian was approximately {{convert|2,000|mi|km}} away from Japan, so it took six hours to reach Hiroshima. The atomic bomb, code-named "[[Little Boy]]", was dropped over Hiroshima at 08:15 local time. Tibbets recalled that the city was covered with a tall mushroom cloud after the bomb was dropped.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=705<U+2013>711}}

==Aftermath==

Tibbets was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] by Spaatz immediately after landing on Tinian.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=101}} He became a celebrity, with pictures and interviews of his wife and children in the major American newspapers. He was seen as a national hero who had ended the war with Japan. There were, however, no parades or testimonial dinners for him or any of the other ''Enola Gay'' crewmen, although Tibbets later received an invitation from President [[Harry S. Truman]] to visit the [[White House]].{{sfn|Stelpflug|2007|p=163}} The 509th Composite Group was not awarded an [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] until 1999.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=221}}

Tibbets was interviewed extensively by Mike Harden of the ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'', and profiles appeared in the newspaper on anniversaries of the first dropping of an atomic bomb. In a 1975 interview he said: "I'm proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did&nbsp;... I sleep clearly every night."<ref name="BBC_death"/><ref name="Miami_Herald"/> "I knew when I got the assignment," he told a reporter in 2005, "it was going to be an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible."<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Columbus Dispatch |title=Still No regrets for Frail Enola Gay Pilot |date=August 6, 2005 |first=Mike |last=Harden |accessdate=May 17, 2014 }}</ref>

==Post-war military career==
The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on November 6, 1945, and was stationed at [[Roswell Army Airfield]], New Mexico.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=21}} Colonel [[William H. Blanchard]] replaced Tibbets as group commander on January 22, 1946, and also became the first commander of the [[509th Bombardment Wing]], the successor to the 509th Composite Group.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=62}} Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the Pacific, but he and his ''Enola Gay'' crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=260<U+2013>261}}

Tibbets then attended the [[Air Command and Staff School]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at [[the Pentagon]].<ref name="USAF"/> When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General [[Thomas S. Power]], was posted to London as air attach<U+00E9>, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be [[jet aircraft]] and thus became involved in the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] program.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=266<U+2013>267}} He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita  from July 1950 until February 1952.

After his retirement from the Air Force, Tibbets worked for Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), an air taxi company based in [[Columbus, Ohio]], and now called [[NetJets]]. He attempted to extend the company's operations to Europe, but was unsuccessful. He retired from the company in 1968, and returned to Miami, Florida, where he had spent part of his childhood. The banks foreclosed on EJA in 1970, and [[Bruce Sundlun]] became president. Sundlun lured Tibbets back to EJA that year. Tibbets succeeded Sundlun as president on April 21, 1976, and remained in the role until 1986. He served for a year as a consultant before his second and final retirement from EJA in 1987.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0306003 | title= Paul Tibbets: A Rendezvous with History by Di Freeze | publisher= Airport Journals | accessdate= 5 June 2009 |archivedate=1 July 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Miami_Herald">{{cite news|title=Miamian who bombed Hiroshima in 1945 dies|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/herald/obituary.aspx?pid=97158828|newspaper=[[Miami Herald]]|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name="death1"/>
