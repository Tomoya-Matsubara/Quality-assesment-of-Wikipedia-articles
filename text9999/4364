'''Robin Friday''' (27 July 1952 &ndash; 22 December 1990) was an English [[association football|footballer]] who played professionally as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] during a career that lasted four years in the mid-1970s.{{ref label|career|A}} Born and raised in [[Acton, London|Acton]], west [[London]], Friday played for local semi-professional sides before joining [[Charlie Hurley]]'s [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] Reading team in 1974. Despite having just joined from [[non-League football]], he quickly became a key player, and helped Reading to win [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] during the [[1975<U+2013>76 Football League|1975<U+2013>76]] season.

Friday was known for smoking, drinking, womanising and drug-taking, and his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record. However, his on-field performances were regarded as excellent, and he won the club's player of the year award in both of his full seasons at Reading, as well as being the leading goal scorer.

As his drug habit intensified, Friday's form began to dip in the first half of the [[1976<U+2013>77 Football League|1976<U+2013>77]] season, leading Reading to sell him to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side Cardiff City in December 1976. Friday travelled to join his new team by train, without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by Cardiff manager [[Jimmy Andrews]] before even signing for the club. After a strong debut, his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether. Following a number of incidents, on and off the field, including kicking [[Mark Lawrenson]] in the face,{{ref label|lawrensonkitbag|B|a}} Friday retired from football in December 1977, aged 25. He died in Acton in 1990, aged 38, after suffering a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].

The strongest parts of Friday's game were his ball skills, footballing intelligence and physical and mental strength. Andrews labelled Friday "the complete centre-forward", and, along with numerous contemporaries, retrospectively rated Friday as good enough for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. Both because of his playing ability and personality, Friday remains an important figure to fans of both Reading and Cardiff, despite his short career: in a [[BBC]] poll held in 2004, he was voted the top "all-time cult hero" for both clubs. He has been voted Reading's best ever player twice, in 1999 and 2007. Cardiff-based band [[Super Furry Animals]] dedicated their 1996 single ''[[The Man Don't Give a Fuck]]'' to his memory.

==Early life and semi-professional football==
===Childhood===
[[File:Griffin Park 1982 - geograph-2023521.jpg|thumb|The Friday brothers saw their first professional match at the age of two, at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]]'s [[Griffin Park]] ground, pictured in 1982.]]
Robin Friday and his twin brother, Tony, were born in [[Acton, London|Acton]], west [[London]], on 27 July 1952. Their parents, Alf Friday, a driver for a laundry firm, and his wife Sheila, were both born in Acton and had married a year before, both aged 20, having met three years earlier. Sheila's father, Frederick Riding, had played professional football for [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] before the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The Fridays lived with Sheila's family until moving into a [[Prefabricated home|prefab]] of their own in [[Acton Green, London|Acton Green]] when Robin and Tony were aged two; they later moved to a [[maisonette]] in [[South Acton, London|South Acton]] in 1962 when it was found that the prefab was sinking. Robin and Tony were later described by their mother as having been remarkably close, rarely arguing or fighting; a notable difference was that Robin was shy, whereas Tony was more confident. The twins attended their first professional match at the age of two, when their father took them to a Brentford match at [[Griffin Park]]; from the age of four Alf took both boys to play football at a local park every afternoon.<ref name="biog23">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=23<U+2013>26}}</ref>

Around the age of ten, Robin possessed notable ball-skills, and according to his father could flick an orange up onto his neck, balance it and then let it roll it back down his body and catch it on his foot. As well as football, Robin played cricket to a high standard, boxed and played tennis. Despite their many similarities and common interest in sports and football in particular, the twins were wildly different in academic terms: while Tony did well at school, Robin was uninterested and according to his brother "was always bunking off, having [[wiktionary:bird#Etymology 1|birds]] around the park."<ref name="biog26">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=26<U+2013>28}}</ref>

Robin was scouted by numerous London sides during his teenage years, joining [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]'s school of excellence at 12 or 13, then moving on to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] for a season at 13 and then to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], with whom he attended the [[1967 FA Cup Final]] as a youth player. However, Friday's individual style of play and refusal to change his game resulted in each of these clubs losing patience with him. The twin brothers joined a men's team, the Acton British Legion Reserves, aged 14, and in some matches would play alongside their father. Tony played in midfield, and Robin up front, but according to Tony his brother was even better as a goalkeeper than a forward: "He was a brilliant goalkeeper. He had no fear ... But he obviously preferred banging them in at the other end." Around this time Robin became interested in music, dancing and attending concerts; he was a fan of [[Janis Joplin]] in particular. He also had a talent for drawing, but suddenly abandoned this interest at 15. Robin became more outgoing than his brother and started taking drugs in his mid-teens; he left school at 15, a year before Tony, and began training as a plasterer.<ref name="biog28">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=28<U+2013>32}}</ref>
{{clear}}

===Borstal, first marriage and the Isthmian League===
Friday lasted two months as a plasterer before moving on to become first a van driver for a grocery firm, then a window cleaner. His laid-back attitude and indifference was already clear: in his father's words, "he didn't care".<ref name="biog32">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=32<U+2013>33}}</ref> Friday regularly stole by this time, but despite numerous convictions, did not go to a detention centre until he was 16. Having been caught stealing what Tony recalled to be "a car radio or something", he was released almost immediately because he suffered from [[asthma]]; however, after he re-offended three months later he was sent to [[Feltham (HM Prison)|Feltham Borstal]], where he served 14 months.<ref name="biog34">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=34}}</ref> During his time there, Friday became physically stronger and fitter and also starred for the borstal football team; he was selected for the prison league's all-star men's team, still aged 16, and was allowed out of borstal to train and play with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]'s youth teams.<ref name=biog34/>

After his release, Friday returned to Acton and met a local [[Black British|black]] girl named Maxine Doughan, whom he made pregnant. The local controversy surrounding the [[Interracial marriage|interracial relationship]] caused the couple and their circle of friends to be isolated socially, and even to be physically attacked one night in an Acton pub.<ref name=biog34/> Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents <U+2013> Alf refused to even attend the wedding<ref name=biog34/> <U+2013> they married, both aged 17.<ref name=biog34/> A daughter, Nicola, was born soon afterwards but Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously, continuing to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics.<ref name="biog34">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=34<U+2013>35}}</ref> A friend of Friday's, who played for [[Walthamstow Avenue F.C.|Walthamstow Avenue]], a semi-professional [[Isthmian League]] club from north-east London, took him along to training one day in early 1971; Friday played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]10 per week. Many of his new team-mates were asphalters from east London, and Friday soon joined them in that trade.<ref name="biog35">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=35<U+2013>36}}</ref>

Friday made his d<U+00E9>but for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], coming off the bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting & Mitcham]] he once again appeared as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club [[Hayes F.C.|Hayes]] in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match.<ref name=hayesprofile/> Hayes offered <U+00A3>30 per week, and were also based closer to his home in Acton.<ref name=biog36/> A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in [[Lambeth]], a [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on.<ref name=biog36/> The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike <U+2013> the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung.<ref name=biog36/> Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes front line in October 1972.<ref name="biog36">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=36<U+2013>37}}</ref>

After scoring eight goals within a month of his return to action, scouts from [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs reported back on Friday, but because of his age League managers were unsure that he could make it; at 20 years old many of them felt that he was already too old to start a professional career.<ref name=Gannon/> Friday was known at Hayes for his excessive drinking, and on one occasion the team started a match a player short because Friday had not turned up. When he finally arrived, eighty minutes after kick-off,<ref name=roughley/> his intoxication was obvious.<ref name=Gannon/> Nevertheless, he was sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless. The opposition paid him little attention and Friday scored a late winning goal.<ref name=roughley/> Hayes were drawn to play [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] club Reading in the [[FA Cup]]'s second round in early 1973; the team managed to draw 0<U+2013>0 at Reading and earn the right to a [[Replay (sports)|replay]] at home, which they lost 1<U+2013>0. Although Hayes had lost, the interest of Reading manager [[Charlie Hurley]] was piqued. Hurley travelled to Hayes more than once to watch him play;<ref name="biog39">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=39}}</ref> having done his research on his background, he was cautious about signing Friday, but was impressed all the same by his on-field performances.<ref name=biog39/> The [[1972<U+2013>73 in English football|1972<U+2013>73]] season was Friday's most prolific non-League year in terms of goals.<ref name=hayesprofile/> Friday briefly joined [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]] early in the [[1973<U+2013>74 in English football|1973<U+2013>74]] season and actually scored against Hayes in an FA Cup tie before returning to west London in December 1973;<ref name="hayesprofile">{{cite news

{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=In his very first training session they were playing a six-a-side game and Robin went around trying to kick as many of the established Reading players as he could.

In Hurley's words, Friday "trained like he played"; "he had no other way of playing".<ref name="biog40">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=40}}</ref> His new manager even had to take him out of training on occasion because of the injuries he would inflict on his own team-mates in his effort to win.<ref name=biog37/><ref name=biog40/> Although he was now contracted to Reading, his amateurism meant that he could continue to appear for Hayes and work as an asphalter in London while training part-time and playing for Reading's reserves. By late January 1974, Reading were on a run of fourteen games with only two victories, while Friday had performed strongly in three reserve matches. Hurley had the amateur forward sign Football League forms on 23 January 1974 and gave him his first-team d<U+00E9>but four days later.<ref name=biog40/> Friday turned in a performance against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] at [[Elm Park (stadium)|Elm Park]] that the ''[[Reading Post|Reading Evening Post]]'' called "outstanding" as Reading drew 3<U+2013>3.<ref name="biog41">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=41}}</ref> The team then travelled to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 3 February, having not won away from home in four months; after Barnsley led 2<U+2013>0 at half-time, Friday scored his first League goal with a header just after the break to make the score 2<U+2013>1.<ref name="biog43">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=43}}</ref> Reading immediately offered a professional contract, which Friday signed on 6 February 1974.<ref name=biog43/> His new salary was half what he had earned as an asphalter.<ref name="biog42">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=42}}</ref>

{{Quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=The team that has been transformed by Robin Friday has now scored a remarkable 16 goals in five games and the highlight of this joyous afternoon was a goal by Friday that was worth anyone's admission money on its own ...|source=<small>Excerpt from ''[[Reading Post|Reading Evening Post]]'' match report, 24 February 1974<ref name=biog48/></small>}}
Friday's technical ability made him very popular among Reading supporters and pressmen alike; the ''Reading Evening Post'' report of Reading's 4<U+2013>1 victory over [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] on 10 February 1974, Friday's first match as a professional, described his performance as "sheer magic" as he scored twice.<ref name=biog44/> The report also called Friday's first goal of the day "glorious": he collected the ball wide on the left wing, took it past four Exeter defenders and then fired the ball low and hard into the opposite corner from the edge of the penalty area.<ref name=biog44/> Friday was conspicuous in the professional ranks for never wearing [[Shin guard|shin pads]], and for his resistance to physical harm; no matter how badly he was hurt he would always get up and continue.<ref name=biog44/> After sustaining a calf injury against Exeter, he returned for the team's next game, away at [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] on 17 February. Friday was repeatedly fouled cynically by the opposing players and sustained injuries necessitating five minutes on the sideline late in the first half; however, he recovered, returned to the game and set up both Reading goals as his side prevailed by a score of two goals to nil.<ref name="biog44">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=44<U+2013>47}}</ref><ref name=Hewitt/> The team's next game, on 24 February 1974, was at home against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], and with Friday playing a key role Reading won 5<U+2013>0. In particular, Friday scored a goal after 17 minutes described by the ''Evening Post'' reporter as "magical":<ref name=biog48/> With the score 1<U+2013>0 to Reading, Friday received the ball near the edge of the penalty area, at a tight angle, and coolly kicked the ball with the outside of his boot low across goal, towards the far post. Although it appeared to be heading yards wide of the net, the ball suddenly curved in at the last possible moment <U+2013> "right around the goalie", in the words of Reading F.C. historian David Downs <U+2013> and clipped the goalpost before nestling in the back of the net.<ref name="biog48">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=48<U+2013>49}}</ref><ref name=Hewitt/>

{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=Blessed with awesome stamina, he ran riot outside football. He danced naked in clubs, naked in pubs. He openly smoked spliff and dropped pills.

Despite his immediate impact on the pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his team-mates; most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender [[Tommy Youlden]], were sceptical.<ref name="biog78">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=78}}</ref> He drank extremely heavily, favouring American [[Colt 45 (malt liquor)|Colt 45]] lager,<ref name="biog47">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=47|quote=Rod Lewington: He drank lager.

He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.<ref name=biog64/> Although Churchill's, described by Lewington as "the worst club that has ever been in Reading", tolerated such behaviour,<ref name=biog64/> the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called "the elephant" which consisted of turning the pockets of his jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself.<ref name="biog94">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=94}}</ref> He and his friends would regularly drink all day,<ref name=biog81/> though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game.<ref name=biog81/><ref name="biog86">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=86|quote=Syd Simmonds: He [Friday] wasn't a heavy drinker.

[[File:Elm Park, the former home of Reading FC.jpg|thumb|Friday played home matches for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at [[Elm Park (stadium)|Elm Park]], pictured in 1981.]]
After Reading finished the [[1973<U+2013>74 Football League|1973<U+2013>74]] season in sixth position, a rise from seventh the previous year,<ref name=rundlereading/> Friday continued to play well during [[1974<U+2013>75 Football League|1974<U+2013>75]]. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] sides [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]];<ref name=biog68/><ref name=biog69/> the former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur.<ref name="biog68">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=68}}</ref> Although United had by this time sent scouts to see Friday six times<ref name=biog68/> and Arsenal manager [[Bertie Mee]] had personally attended Reading's 4<U+2013>2 home win over [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] on 12 September,<ref name="biog69">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=69}}</ref> no approach came from either team. After Reading despatched [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] 3<U+2013>0 on 14 September 1974, Friday and forward partner [[Dick Habbin]] had scored six goals each and topped the Football League goalscoring charts.<ref name="biog70">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|page=70}}</ref> However, at the same time Friday's disciplinary record was becoming so bad that even the ''Evening Post'', usually favourable to him, criticised him on 30 September 1974, just after he had scored his first [[hat-trick]] for Reading in a 4<U+2013>1 victory over [[Southport F.C.|Southport]].<ref name=biog72/> Although he was the Football League's joint top scorer by this time with nine goals, he had also already been booked three times that season and the ''Post'' argued that by constantly risking suspension he was letting the team down. Under the system then used, the three bookings gave him an automatic two-match suspension; the article argued that missing games because of "completely unnecessary" and "stupid" fouls amounted to selling the club short.<ref name="biog72">{{cite book|last1=McGuigan|last2=Hewitt|year=1997|pages=72<U+2013>73}}</ref>

With the score 1<U+2013>0 to Reading, goalkeeper [[Steve Death]] threw the ball to right back [[Gary Peters (footballer)|Gary Peters]], who spotted Friday standing near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd. "I'll never forget it," Thomas recalled, "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost.

 | quote = Cardiff City striker Robin Friday, banned from City's next two matches, gave the V-sign to Luton town goalkeeper Milija Aleksic after scoring the second of his two goals in City's 4<U+2013>2 win on Saturday ... A minute earlier Friday had been lectured by ... [the] referee following a stormy incident with Aleksic. Intimidation seems to be a part of Friday's tactics for unsettling opponents, but the 24-year-old forward denied he deliberately courts trouble ... "I am not a villain. But I do get involved because, [sic] I am a winner. If you are not a winner it's not worth being in the game." Friday was forced to retire after 70 minutes with a knee injury which he claimed was caused by an Aleksic foul. "The goalkeeper came out with his foot up," he alleged. Friday had been penalised for a high tackle on Aleksic in the 36th minute. when he held out an outstretched hand in offer of apology, the goalkeeper reacted angrily. Seconds after the free-kick Friday robbed a ponderous John Faulkner and gained some 10 yards to rifle a perfect ground shot past Aleksic. After acknowledging the cheers of the crowd Friday turned towards the goalkeeper and made the V-sign gesture. Asked about the gesture after the game, Friday said, "I can't remember doing that."

|quote=Robin Friday started his career at which now-defunct club? Walthamstow Avenue. Friday turned up 80 minutes late for a match with Hayes FC before scoring the winning goal in the 10 minutes he was on the pitch. What was his reason for being so late? He was in the pub. When Robin Friday arrived to sign for Cardiff he was arrested. What for? He didn't have a valid train ticket. Friday scored a goal for Reading in 1976 that was so spectacular that the referee Clive Thomas had to hold his head in disbelief for a few seconds before gathering himself and carrying on with his duty. Later he said: "Even up against the likes of Pele and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." Against which team was it scored? Tranmere Rovers. Which band released a single with a picture of Friday on its cover? The Super Furry Animals. Finish this Robin Friday quote: "On the pitch I hate all opponents. I don't give a damn about anyone. People think I'm mad, a lunatic. I am a ... Winner". ... The former Reading manager Maurice Evans once told Friday: "If you would just settle down for three or four years, you could play for England." What did Friday say in response? "I'm half your age and I've lived twice your life". What did Friday do to the great Bobby Moore when facing him on his Cardiff debut? Squeezed his testicles.

Friday's style of play was based around his exceptional ball skills, described by Cardiff doctor Leslie Hamilton as "absolutely fabulous",<ref name=biog176/> and his instinctive footballing vision, which enabled him both to execute flamboyant individual moves and to create attacks for his team-mates. Jimmy Andrews, his manager at Cardiff, later called Friday "the complete centre-forward" and placed him on a par with [[Alan Shearer]],<ref name=biog192/> while Maurice Evans claimed that he could have played for England,<ref name=biog188/> and was at least on a level with international strikers he had worked with such as [[John Aldridge]] and [[Dean Saunders]].<ref name="biog189">{{cite book
| last1=McGuigan
| last2=Hewitt
| year=1997
| page=189}}</ref> This attitude was also held by Hamilton and Friday's Reading team-mate [[John Murray (English footballer)|John Murray]], both of whom firmly declared in separate interviews that Friday would have been good enough for the England team had he "sorted his head out", in Hamilton's words.<ref name="biog176">{{cite book

| last1=McGuigan
| last2=Hewitt
| year=1997
| page=188}}</ref> A natural goalscoring forward, Friday was also unselfish and would take just as much pleasure out of setting up a goal scored by a team-mate as netting one himself. He possessed fine ball control and dribbling skills, and could also shoot with both great power and sharp accuracy.<ref name="biog14">{{cite book
| last1=McGuigan
| last2=Hewitt
| year=1997
| page=14}}</ref> The strong physical aspect of his game and exceptionally competitive, combative spirit combined with all of this to create a formidable forward player <U+2013> such was his ability that his arrival transformed Reading into one of the division's best sides in a matter of weeks.<ref name=biog48/> Writing in 2010, Roger Titford stressed Friday's immediate and profound impact on the Reading team as a key factor in his lasting popularity: "It was like the comic-book stories that kids from Robin's era would have read", he wrote; "He was a ready-made star".<ref name="Titford27">{{cite book
| last=Titford
| page=27
| year=2010}}</ref>

[[File:Alanshearerwiki.jpg|thumb|[[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] manager [[Jimmy Andrews]] retrospectively placed Friday's playing ability on a level with that of [[England national football team|England]] forward [[Alan Shearer]], pictured in 2005.<ref name=biog192/>]]
On top of his technical talent, Friday was physically very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries; according to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle.<ref name=biog176/> He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Cardiff team-mate and [[Wales national football team|Wales]] international defender [[Phil Dwyer]] recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: "When he was in the line-up you'd have a centre-forward ''and'' a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back."<ref name="biog173">{{cite book
| last1=McGuigan
| last2=Hewitt
| year=1997
| page=173}}</ref> He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'." On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a team-mate.<ref name="biog50">{{cite book
| last1=McGuigan
| last2=Hewitt
| year=1997
| page=50}}</ref> "We didn't need anyone else up front," Hurley later said; "they couldn't get the ball off him. He was one of those guys who could beat five players easily."<ref name="biog74">{{cite book
| last1=McGuigan
| last2=Hewitt
| year=1997
| page=74}}</ref> Andrews agreed: "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him."<ref name=biog192/>

Friday was known for giving his all in any game in which he played, no matter the circumstances; Downs's opinion was that Friday "worked as hard at the end of the game as he did at the start" while Hurley said that Friday would often become furious at his team-mates for not trying their best, even in training.<ref name=biog40/><ref name="biog54">{{cite book
| last1=McGuigan
| last2=Hewitt
| year=1997
| pages=54<U+2013>55}}</ref>  This strong drive to always win even extended to the use of physical intimidation to unsettle opposing players, leading contemporary critics to label him a "villain".<ref name=swecho19770418/> Friday also employed the use of psychological tactics; aiming to spook opposing players, Friday would kiss them or fondle with their testicles. Cardiff team-mate [[Paul Went]] recalled that these tricks would often "completely [[wiktionary:throw#Etymology 1|throw]]" defenders and affect their concentration.<ref name="biog160161">{{cite book
| last1=McGuigan
| last2=Hewitt
| year=1997
| pages=160<U+2013>161}}</ref>  Although he was often criticised for the number of bookings and sendings-off he received, Friday believed he was justified to chase victory by any means, explaining his attitude in a 1977 interview: "On the pitch I hate all opponents. I don't give a damn about anyone. People think I'm mad, a lunatic. I am a winner".<ref name=roughley/><ref name="biog192">{{cite book

|quote=The former Reading and Cardiff striker became a legend among supporters for his antics - both on and off the pitch. Perhaps the highlight of his "bad boy" career was to be sent off for kicking future BBC pundit Mark Lawrenson in the face. Not content with subjecting Lawrenson to an assualt, Friday marched into the dressing room and defecated in the Irishman's kit bag. Friday once perfomed a similar toiletry feat - but this time into the opposition's team bath. When he signed for Cardiff in 1976 he was arrested in the Welsh capital on the same day for trying to dodge a train fare. Friday, voted into Reading's greatest XI by fans, died in 1990 from a heart attack.}}</ref><ref name=f365/><ref name="halifaxcourier">{{cite news
