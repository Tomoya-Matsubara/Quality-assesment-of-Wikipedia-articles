'''Suburban Journals''' is a group of 40 publications in the [[St. Louis]] region owned by [[Lee Enterprises]].

The group, known as Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis, publishes 31 community newspapers, the ''Ladue News'' and ''St. Louis' Best Bridal'' magazine. The chain reaches 637,000 households.<ref>http://images.stltoday.com/stltoday/images/statsreader_sj.pdf</ref>

Publications are grouped in regional offices, each with its own editor, in Town and Country, Mo.; Collinsville, Ill.; Festus, Mo.; Columbia, Ill.; St. Peters, Mo.; Warrenton, Mo.; and two in St. Louis. 

The newspapers are independent of the Lee-owned [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], but do share some resources, such a technical assistance. The companies, which were both previously owned by Pulitzer Inc., also share a common website, stltoday.com.

The chain's main competition is the ''Post-Dispatch'' and community-focused ''Webster-Kirkwood Times'' and ''South County Times'' in Missouri and ''Alton Telegraph'' and ''[Belleville News Democrat]'' in Illinois. 

It is by some counts the largest community chain of newspapers in the country.<ref>http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2000/03/06/story2.html</ref>

==History==
Most of the publications currently owned by Suburban Journals date back to the early 1900s as independent newspapers. Many were in direct competition with one another. 

In the early 1980s, several of the newspapers were bought by Ingersoll Publications Co., a firm headed by Ralph Ingersoll II, whose [[Ralph Ingersoll (PM publisher)| father]] lead the innovative [[PM (newspaper)|''PM'' newspaper]] in 1940s New York City<ref>http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DD163FF936A25756C0A966958260</ref>.

Ingersoll, who wanted to compete with the ''Post Dispatch'' and now defunct [[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]] used high-risk junk bonds to finance his acquisitions<ref>http://list.msu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909d&L=aejmc&P=5183</ref>.

Ingersoll, who considered starting a St. Louis daily with the closure of the ''Globe,'' in 1990 was bought out by his partner and financier, E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co., which formed a the Journal Register Co., the owner of 25 daily      
newspapers, including the ''New Haven Register'' and ''Alton Telegraph.'' The chain became the Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis<ref>http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/73/Journal-Register-Company.html</ref>.

In 1997, it bought the ''Ladue News''<ref>http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/1997/12/15/daily3.html</ref>.

The company in 1999 had revenues of $151 million<ref>http://www.secinfo.com/dsvR3.53pn.d.htm</ref>.

Pulitzer, which owned the ''Post Dispatch'' and 11 other daily newspapers, in June 2000 bought the company, which then had 38 papers<ref>http://images.stltoday.com/stltoday/resources/pulitzertimeline.pdf</ref>. It cost $165 million<ref>http://www.secinfo.com/dsvR3.53pn.d.htm</ref>.
 
Pulitzer then sold the group to Lee in summer 2005 for $1.46 billion<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&sid=aVVo0NhIPMQs&refer=columnist_weil</ref>.
