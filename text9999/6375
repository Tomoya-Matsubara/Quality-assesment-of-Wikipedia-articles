'''Richard Henry Sellers''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (8 September 1925&nbsp;<U+2013> 24 July 1980), known as '''Peter Sellers''', was a British film actor, comedian and singer. He appeared in the BBC Radio comedy series ''[[The Goon Show]]'', featured on a number of hit comic songs and became known to a world-wide audience through his many film characterisations, among them [[Inspector Clouseau|Chief Inspector Clouseau]] in ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' series of films.

Born in [[Portsmouth]], Sellers made his stage debut at the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea]], when he was two weeks old. He began accompanying his parents in a variety act that toured the provincial theatres. He first worked as a drummer and toured around England as a member of the [[Entertainments National Service Association]]. He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in [[Ralph Reader]]'s wartime [[Gang Show]] entertainment troupe which toured Britain and the Far East. After the war, Sellers made his radio debut in ''ShowTime'', and eventually became a regular performer on various [[BBC radio]] shows. During the early 1950s, Sellers, along with [[Spike Milligan]], [[Harry Secombe]] and [[Michael Bentine]], took part in the successful radio series ''The Goon Show'', which ended in 1960.

Sellers began as a film actor in the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic-based, often [[parody]]ing characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Notable films demonstrating his artistic range include ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'' (1959); [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) and ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964); ''[[What's New, Pussycat?]]'' (1965); ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (1967); ''[[The Party (film)|The Party]]'' (1968); ''[[Being There]]'' (1979) and the five films of the ''Pink Panther'' series (1963<U+2013>1978). Sellers's versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and [[black comedy|black humour]] were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers garnered much critical acclaim for his work; he was nominated three times for an [[Academy Award]], twice for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performances in ''Dr. Strangelove'' and ''Being There'', and once for the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]] for ''[[The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film]]'' (1960). He won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]] twice, for ''I'm All Right Jack'' and for the original Pink Panther film, ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;<U+2013> Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for his role in ''Being There'', and also earned three other Golden Globe nominations in the same category.  [[Turner Classic Movies]] calls Sellers, "one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century."<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Sellers|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/173984%7C124304/Peter-Sellers/biography.html|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> 

In his personal life, Sellers struggled with depression and insecurities. An enigmatic figure, he often claimed to have no identity outside the roles that he played. His behaviour was often erratic and compulsive, and he frequently clashed with his directors and co-stars, especially in the mid-1970s when his physical and mental health, together with his alcohol and drug problems, were at their worst.  Sellers was married four times, and had three children from his first two marriages. He died as a result of a heart attack in 1980, aged 54. Filmmakers the [[Boulting brothers]] described Sellers as "the greatest comic genius this country has produced since [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]]."<ref name="Boulting" />

Sellers was born on 8 September 1925, in [[Southsea]], a suburb of [[Portsmouth]]. His parents were [[Yorkshire]]-born William "Bill" Sellers (1900<U+2013>62) and Agnes Doreen "Peg" (n<U+00E9>e Marks, 1892<U+2013>1967). Both were variety entertainers; Peg was in the Ray Sisters troupe.<ref name="Milligan (DNB)"/> Although christened Richard Henry, his parents called him Peter, after his elder [[stillbirth|stillborn]] brother.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=5}} Sellers remained an only child.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=690}} Peg Sellers was related to the [[pugilist]] [[Daniel Mendoza]] (1764<U+2013>1836), an ancestor who Sellers greatly revered, and whose engraving later hung in his office. At one time Sellers planned to use Mendoza's image for his production company's logo.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=9}}

Sellers was two weeks old when he was carried on stage by Dick Henderson, the headline act at the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea|Kings Theatre]] in Southsea: the crowd sang "[[For He's a Jolly Good Fellow]]" which reduced Sellers to tears.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=25}} The family constantly toured, causing much upheaval and unhappiness in the young Sellers's life.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=9}}

Sellers maintained a very close relationship with his mother, which his friend [[Spike Milligan]] later considered unhealthy for a grown man.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=45}} Sellers's agent, Dennis Selinger, recalled his first meeting with Peg and Peter Sellers, noting that "Sellers was an immensely shy young man, inclined to be dominated by his mother, but without resentment or objection".{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=57}} As an only child though, he spent much time alone.<ref name="WT1002">{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92800508.html|author=Gibson, Eric|title=Behind Inspector Clouseau; The funny, often elusive Peter Sellers and his wives.|publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]''|date=13 October 2002|accessdate=4 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref>

In 1935 the Sellers family moved to North London and settled in [[Muswell Hill]].{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=24}} Although Bill Sellers was Protestant and Peg was Jewish, Sellers attended the North London [[Catholic school|Roman Catholic school]] [[St Aloysius College, London|St. Aloysius College]], run by the [[Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy]].<ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /> Although the family was not rich, Peg insisted on an expensive private schooling for her son.{{sfn|Starr|1991|p=84}} According to his biographer, [[Roger Lewis]], Sellers was intrigued by Catholicism, but soon after entering Catholic school, he "discovered he was a Jew<U+2014>he was someone on the outside of the mysteries of faith."{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=44}} Later in his life, Sellers observed that while his father's faith was according to the [[Church of England]], his mother was Jewish, "and Jews take the faith of their mother."{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=44}} He became a top student at the school, excelling in drawing in particular; he was prone to laziness, but his natural talents shielded him from criticism by his teachers.{{sfn|Moritz|1961|p=371}} Sellers recalled that a teacher scolded the other boys for not studying, saying: "The Jewish boy knows his [[catechism]] better than the rest of you!"{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=12}}{{efn|Film critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] noted that Sellers's ambition as an actor was fuelled mainly by "his hatred of [[anti-Semitism]]." This may have spurred his determination to become a great actor or director.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=11}}}}

=== Early performances (1935<U+2013>39) ===

Accompanying his family on the variety show circuit,{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=8}} Sellers learned [[stagecraft]]. However, he received conflicting encouragement from his parents and developed mixed feelings about show business. His father doubted Peter's abilities in the entertainment field, even suggesting that his son's talents were only enough to become a road sweeper, while Sellers's mother encouraged him continuously.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=18}}

While at St Aloysius College, Sellers began to develop his improvisational skills. He and his closest friend at the time, Bryan Connon, both enjoyed listening to early radio comedy shows. Connon remembers that "Peter got endless pleasure imitating the people in ''[[Monday Night at Eight]]''. He had a gift for improvising dialogue. Sketches, too. I'd be the 'straight man', the 'feed',&nbsp;... I'd cue Peter and he'd do all the radio personalities and chuck in a few voices of his own invention as well."{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=28}}

With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, St Aloysius College was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to [[Cambridgeshire]]. Because his mother did not allow Sellers to go,{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=32}} his formal education ended at fourteen.<ref name="Milligan (DNB)"/> Early in 1940, the family moved to the north [[Devon]] town of [[Ilfracombe]], where Sellers's maternal uncle managed the Victoria Palace Theatre;{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=32}} Sellers got his first job at the theatre, aged fifteen, starting as a caretaker.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=19}} He was steadily promoted, becoming a box office clerk, usher, assistant stage manager and lighting operator. He was also offered some small acting parts.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=19}} Working backstage gave him a chance to study actors such as [[Paul Scofield]]. He became close friends with Derek Altman, and together they launched Sellers's first stage act under the name "Altman and Sellers", consisting of playing [[ukulele]]s, singing, and telling jokes.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=19}} 

During his backstage theatre job, Sellers began practising on a set of drums that belonged to the band [[Joe Daniels (jazz drummer)|Joe Daniels]] and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=20}} Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his mimicry and improvisation skills.<ref name="Milligan (DNB)"/>

=== Second World War (1939<U+2013>45) ===

As the Second World War progressed, Sellers continued to develop his drumming skills, and played with a series of touring bands, including those of [[Oscar Rabin]], [[Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Hall]] and [[Waldini]],{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=45}} as well as his father's quartet, before he left and joined a band from [[Blackpool]].{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=22}} Sellers became a member of the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British forces and factory workers during the war.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=22}} Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of [[George Formby]], with Sellers accompanying his own singing on [[ukulele]].{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=85}}

In September 1943, he joined the [[Royal Air Force]], although it is unclear whether he volunteered or was enlisted;{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=40}}{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=25}} his mother unsuccessfully tried to have him deferred on medical grounds.<ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /> Sellers wanted to become a pilot, but his poor eyesight restricted him to ground staff duties.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=32}} He found these duties dull, so auditioned for Squadron Leader [[Ralph Reader]]'s RAF ''[[Gang Show]]'' entertainment troupe: Reader accepted him and Sellers toured the UK before the troupe was transferred to India.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=42}} His tour also included [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] and [[Myanmar|Burma]], although the duration of his stay in Asia is unknown, and Sellers himself may have exaggerated its length.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=26}} He also served in Germany and France after the war.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=26}}
According to [[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]] who became friends with Sellers, he was "one of the best performers ever" on the drums and developed a fine ability to impersonate military officers during this period.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=46}}

=== Early post-war career and ''The Goon Show'' (1946<U+2013>55) ===

In 1946, Sellers made his final show with ENSA starring in the pantomime ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' at the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Marigny]] in Paris.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=132}} He was posted back to England shortly afterwards to work at the Air Ministry,{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=32}} and [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after World War II|demobilised]] later that year.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=132}} On resuming his theatrical career, Sellers could get only sporadic work.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=38}} He was fired after one performance of a comedy routine in [[Peterborough]]; the headline act, Welsh vocalist [[Dorothy Squires]], however, persuaded the management to reinstate him.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=57}} Sellers also continued his drumming and was billed on his appearance at the Aldershot Hippodrome as "Britain's answer to [[Gene Krupa]]".{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=38}} In March 1948 Sellers gained a six-week run at the [[Windmill Theatre]] in London, which predominantly staged [[revue]] acts: he provided the comedy turns in between the nude shows on offer.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=58}}{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=40}}

Sellers wrote to the [[BBC]] in 1948, and was subsequently auditioned. As a result, he made his television debut on 18 March 1948 in ''New To You''. His act was largely based on impressions, was well received, and he returned the following week.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=45}} Frustrated with the slow pace of his career, Sellers telephoned BBC radio producer Roy Speer, pretending to be [[Kenneth Horne]], star of the radio show ''[[Much Binding in the Marsh]]''. Speer called Sellers a "cheeky young sod" for his efforts, but gave him an audition. This led to his brief appearance on 1 July 1948 on ''ShowTime''{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|pp=47<U+2013>48}} and subsequently to work on ''Ray's a Laugh'' with comedian [[Ted Ray (comedian)|Ted Ray]].{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=164}} In October 1948, Sellers was a regular radio performer, appearing in ''Starlight Hour'', ''The Gang Show'', ''Henry Hall's Guest Night'' and ''It's Fine To Be Young''.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=48}}

By the end of 1948, the [[BBC Third Programme]] began to broadcast the comedy series ''Third Division'', which starred, among others, [[Harry Secombe]], [[Michael Bentine]] and Sellers.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=46}} One evening, Sellers and Bentine visited the [[Hackney Empire]], where Secombe was performing, and Bentine introduced Sellers to Spike Milligan.{{sfn|Carpenter|2003|p=90}} The four would meet up at Grafton's public house near Victoria, owned by [[Jimmy Grafton]], who was also a BBC script writer. The four comedians dubbed him ''KOGVOS'' (Keeper of Goons and Voice of Sanity){{efn|The meaning of the acronym KOGVOS was flexible: it has also been defined as "King of Goons and Voice of Sanity"<ref name="Barker (DNB)" /> and "King of the Goons Voices Society".{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=55}}}} Grafton later edited some of the first [[The Goon Show|''Goon Shows'']].{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=55}}

In 1949, Sellers started to date Anne Howe,{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=230}}{{efn|Her maiden name was Anne Howe, while her professional name was Anne Hayes.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=231}}}} an Australian actress who lived in London.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=68}} Sellers proposed to her in April 1950{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=56}} and the couple were married in London on 15 September 1951;{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=57}} their son, [[Michael Sellers (actor)|Michael]], was born on 2 April 1954,{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=71}} and their daughter, Sarah, followed in 1958.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=98}}

Sellers introduction to film work came in 1950, where he dubbed the voice of [[Alfonso Bedoya]] in ''[[The Black Rose]]''.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=284}} He continued to work with Bentine, Milligan and Secombe; on 3 February 1951, a trial tape was made entitled "the Goons", and was sent to the BBC producer Pat Dixon which was eventually accepted. The first ''Goon Show''<ref name="Barker (DNB)" /> was broadcast on 28 May 1951{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=177}}; against their wishes, they appeared under the name ''Crazy People''.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=690}} Sellers appeared in ''The Goons'' until the last programme of the ten-series run, which was broadcast on 28 January 1960.<ref name="Barker (DNB)" /> Sellers played four main characters<U+2014>[[Major Bloodnok]], [[Hercules Grytpype-Thynne]], [[Bluebottle (character)|Bluebottle]] and [[Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister|Henry Crun]]<U+2014>and seventeen minor ones.{{sfn|Wilmut|Grafton|1981|p=116}}

Starting with 370,000 listeners, the show eventually reached up to seven million people in Britain,<ref name="Barker (DNB)" /> and was described by one newspaper as "probably the most influential comedy show of all time".<ref name="Cook 27 April 1993">{{cite news|last=Cook|first=William|title=Radio: Landmarks in radio comedy|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 April 1993|location=London|page=58}}</ref> For Sellers, the BBC considers it had the effect of launching his career "on the road to stardom".<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedy: The Goon Show|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thegoonshow/|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=12 August 2012|location=London}}</ref>

In 1951 the Goons made their feature film debut in ''[[Penny Points to Paradise]]''.<ref name="Brown 26 July 2009">{{cite web|author=Brown, Mark|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jul/26/goons-film-sellers-milligan-secombe|title=Forgotten film of Goons restored by BFI|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=26 July 2009|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> Sellers and Milligan then penned the script to ''[[Let's Go Crazy (film)|Let's Go Crazy]]'', the earliest film to showcase Sellers's ability to portray a series of different characters within the same film, and he made another appearance opposite his Goons co-stars in the 1952 flop, ''[[Down Among the Z Men]]''.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=72}} In 1954, Sellers was cast opposite [[Sid James]], [[Tony Hancock]], [[Raymond Huntley]], [[Donald Pleasence]] and [[Eric Sykes]] in the [[British Lion Film Corporation]] comedy production, ''[[Orders Are Orders]]''. [[John Grierson]] believes that this was Sellers's breakthrough role on screen and credits this film with launching the film careers of both Sellers and Hancock.{{sfn|Grierson|1966|p=34}}

=== ''I'm All Right Jack'' and early years in film (1956<U+2013>59) ===

Sellers pursued a film career and took a number of small roles such as a police inspector in ''[[John and Julie]]'' (1955).{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=362}} The same year, he was offered a bigger part in the 1955 [[Alexander Mackendrick]]-directed [[Ealing Comedies|Ealing comedy]] ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' in which he starred opposite [[Alec Guinness]], [[Herbert Lom]] and [[Cecil Parker]] as Harry Robinson, the teddy boy; biographer Peter Evans considers this Sellers's first good role.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=79}} ''The Ladykillers'' was a success in both Britain and the US,<ref>{{cite web|last=Duguid|first=Mark|title=Ladykillers, The (1955)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/441533/index.html|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> and it was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]] at the [[29th Academy Awards]].<ref name="oscars 1957">{{cite web|title=The 29th Academy Awards (1957) Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/29th-winners.html|work=Oscar Legacy|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref> The following year Sellers recorded a further three television series of ''The Goons'' which aired on Britain's new station, [[ITV]]. The series were ''[[The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d]]'', ''[[A Show Called Fred]]'' and ''[[Son of Fred]]''.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=65}} In 1957, film producer [[Michael Relph]] became impressed with Sellers's portrayal of an elderly character in ''Idiot Weekly'', and cast the 32-year-old actor as a 68-year-old projectionist in [[Basil Dearden]]'s ''[[The Smallest Show on Earth]]'', supporting [[Bill Travers]], [[Virginia McKenna]] and [[Margaret Rutherford]].{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=71}} The film was a commercial success and is considered a minor classic of British screen comedy in the post-war period.{{sfn|Burton|O'Sullivan|2009|p=25}} Following this, Sellers provided the growling voice of [[Winston Churchill]] to the BAFTA award winning film ''[[The Man Who Never Was]]''.{{sfn|Rankin|2009|p=383}} Later in 1957, Sellers starred in [[Mario Zampi]]'s offbeat black comedy ''[[The Naked Truth (1957 film)|The Naked Truth]]'', opposite [[Terry-Thomas]], [[Peggy Mount]], [[Shirley Eaton]] and [[Dennis Price]].<ref name="bfi Naked Truth">{{cite web|title=The Naked Truth (1957)|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/43753|work=Film & TV Database|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>

Sellers's difficulties in getting his film career to take off, and increasing problems in his personal life, prompted him to seek periodic consultations with astrologer [[Maurice Woodruff]], who held considerable sway over his later career.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=117<U+2013>118}} After a chance meeting with a North American Indian spirit guide in the 1950s, Sellers became convinced that the [[music hall]] comedian [[Dan Leno]], who died in 1904, haunted him and guided his career and life decisions.<ref name="Evans Dynamite" />{{sfn|Anthony|2010|p=200}}

In 1958, Sellers starred opposite [[David Tomlinson]], Wilfrid Hyde-White, David Lodge and [[Lionel Jeffries]] as a [[chief petty officer]] in [[Val Guest]]'s ''[[Up the Creek (1958 film)|Up the Creek]]''.{{sfn|Spicer|2003|p=116}} Guest later claimed that he had written and directed the film as a vehicle for Sellers, and thus had started Sellers's film career.{{sfn|Dixon|2007|p=35}}{{sfn|Johnson|Vecchio|1996|p=136}} In order to practice his voice, Sellers purchased one of the earliest reel-to-reel tape recorders.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=478}} The film received critical acclaim in the United States{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=283}} and Roger Lewis viewed  it as an important practice ground for Sellers.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=478}} Next, Sellers starred as a grocer from [[Dallas]], Texas in [[George Pal]]'s ''[[Tom thumb (film)|Tom thumb]]'', an [[MGM]] musical fantasy film, opposite [[Russ Tamblyn]], [[Jessie Matthews]], Terry-Thomas and [[Peter Butterworth]]. The film was a major landmark in Sellers's career and became his first contact with the Hollywood film industry.{{sfn|Culhane|1986|p=156}}{{sfn|Starr|1991|p=21}}

Sellers released his first studio album in 1958 called ''The Best of Sellers''; a collection of sketches and comic songs,{{sfn|Hall|2006|p=254}} the latter of which were undertaken in a variety of comic characters.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=79}} The album reached number three in the [[UK Albums Chart]];<ref name="PS-A" /> it was produced by [[George Martin]] and released on [[Parlophone]].{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=186}} The same year, Sellers made his first film with [[Boulting brothers|John and Roy Boulting]] in ''[[Carlton-Browne of the F.O.]]'', a comedy in which he played a supporting role for the film's lead, Terry-Thomas.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=123}} Before the release of that film, the Boultings, along with Sellers and Thomas in the cast, started filming ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'', a film which would becoming the highest grossing film at the British box office in 1960.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=130}} In preparation for his role as Fred Kite, Sellers watched footage of union officials.<ref name="Boulting" />{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=85}} The role earned him a [[13th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]], and the critic for ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' believed it was Sellers's best screen performance to date.<ref name="ARJ Guardian"/>

In between ''Carlton-Browne of the F.O.'' and ''I'm All Right Jack'', Sellers starred in ''[[The Mouse That Roared (film)|The Mouse That Roared]]'' opposite [[Jean Seberg]] and directed by Jack Arnold. He played three leading and distinct roles: the elderly queen, the ambitious Prime Minister and the innocent and clumsy farm boy selected to lead an invasion of the United States.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=536}} The film received universal and high praise by critics.<ref>{{cite news|title=Subtlety and slapstick|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 February 1960|location=London|page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Crowther, Bosley|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903EEDD123DE53BBC4F51DFB6678382649EDE|title=The Mouse That Roared (1959)|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=27 October 1959|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>

His character, according to Sellers's biographer Peter Evans, was "clearly an amalgam of Clouseau and the doctor in ''The Millionairess''".{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=236}} Roger Lewis notes that like a number of Sellers's characters, he is played in a sympathetic and dignified manner.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=620}} He followed it later that year with [[Hy Averback]]'s ''[[I Love You, Alice B. Toklas]]'', playing an attorney who abandons his lifestyle to become a [[hippie]]. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' was highly critical of Sellers's performance and remarked that he had been "at his worst lately".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19681127/REVIEWS/811270301/1023|author=Ebert, Roger|title=I Love You, Alice B.

In 1969, Sellers starred opposite [[Ringo Starr]], [[John Cleese]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Richard Attenborough]] and [[Roman Polanski]] in [[Joseph McGrath (film director)|Joseph McGrath]]'s ''[[The Magic Christian (film)|The Magic Christian]]''. Sellers portrayed Sir Guy Grand, an eccentric billionaire who plays elaborate [[practical joke]]s on people. Irv Slifkin remarked that the film was a reflection of the cynicism of Peter Sellers, describing the film as a "proto-[[Monty Python|Pythonesque]] adaption of Terry Southern's semi-free-form short novel", and "one of the strangest films to be shown at a gala premiere for Britain's royal family."{{sfn|Slifkin|2004|p=447}} The film, a satire on human nature,{{sfn|Ginibre|Lithgow|Cady|2005|p=296}} was in general  viewed negatively by critics. [[Roger Greenspun]] of ''The New York Times'' believed that the film was of variable quality and summarised it as a "brutal satire".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505E6DE163EE034BC4A52DFB466838B669EDE|author=Greenspun, Roger|title=The Magic Christian (1969)|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=12 February 1970|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Sellers - Hawn 1970.JPG|thumb|with [[Goldie Hawn]] after filming ''There's a Girl in my Soup'' (1970)]]
On 20 April 1972, Sellers reunited with Milligan and Harry Secombe to record ''[[The Last Goon Show of All]]'', which was broadcast on 5 October.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=182}} In May 1973, with his third marriage failing,{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=31}} Sellers went to the theatre to watch [[Liza Minnelli]] perform. He became entranced with Minnelli and the couple became engaged three days later, despite Minnelli's current betrothal to [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.]], and Sellers still being married.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=326}}{{efn|The marriage to Quarry was formally dissolved in September 1974.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=186}}}} Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=231}} By 1974, Sellers's friends were concerned that he was having a nervous breakdown.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=236}} Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was "a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. He was the complete contradiction."<ref name="Boulting" /> Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=823}}<ref name="Mortimer (1980)" /> When he was invited to appear on [[Michael Parkinson]]'s [[Parkinson (TV series)|eponymous chat show]] in 1974, he withdrew the day before, explaining to Parkinson that "I just can't walk on as myself". When he was told he could come on as someone else, he appeared dressed as a member of the [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Parkinson|2009|p=255}} After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, "was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity".{{sfn|Parkinson|2009|p=256}} In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=236}}

In 1974, Sellers portrayed a "sexually voracious" [[Queen Victoria]] in [[Joseph McGrath (film director)|Joseph McGrath]]'s comedic biographical film of the Scottish poet [[William McGonagall]], ''[[The Great McGonagall (film)|The Great McGonagall]]'', starring opposite Milligan and [[Julia Foster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/20706/The-Great-McGonagall/overview|title=The Great McGonagall (1975)|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> However, the film was a critical failure, and Sellers's career and life reached an all-time low. As a result, by 1974 he agreed to accept salaries of <U+00A3>100,000 and 10% of the gross to appear in TV productions and advertisements, well below the <U+00A3>1 million he had once commanded per film.{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=56}} In 1973, he appeared in a [[Benson & Hedges]] cinema commercial; in 1975, he appeared in a series of advertisements for [[Trans World Airlines]], in which he played several eccentric characters, including Thrifty McTravel, Jeremy 'Piggy' Peak Thyme and an Italian singer, Vito.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=176}} Biographer Michael Starr asserts that Sellers showed enthusiasm towards these roles, {{sfn|Starr|1991|p=185}} although the airline campaign failed commercially.{{sfn|Segrave|2005|p=161}}

A turning point in Sellers's flailing career came in 1975, when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make ''[[The Return of the Pink Panther]]'', starring alongside [[Christopher Plummer]], Herbert Lom and [[Catherine Schell]]. The film was shot on a budget of <U+00A3>3 million and earned $33 million at the box office upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Sellers's career as an A-list film star and restoring his millionaire status.<ref name="Milligan (DNB)" />{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=56}}{{sfn|Barnes&Noble|2004|p=828}} The film earned Sellers a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;<U+2013> Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor&nbsp;<U+2013> Musical or Comedy]] award at the [[33rd Golden Globe Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The 22nd Annual Golden Globe Awards (1976)|url=http://cdn.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1975|work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> In 1976, he followed it with ''[[The Pink Panther Strikes Again]]''. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated. Edwards says of the actor's mental state at the time of ''The Pink Panther Strikes Again'', "If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, that's what Peter had become. He was certifiable."<ref name="tcmarticle">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=17706&category=Articles|title=The Pink Panther Strikes Again|publisher=[[TCM]]|author=Thames, Stephanie|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects.{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=56}} Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a "volatile and perplexing character [who] left a trail of misery in his private life".<ref name="Evans Dynamite"/>  He also noted that Sellers had a "compulsive personality and an eccentric hypochondriac" who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period.<ref name="Evans Dynamite"/>  His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry at a time he most needed the work.<ref name="WT1002"/> Despite Sellers's deep personal problems, ''The Pink Panther Strikes Again'' was well received critically. Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said of Sellers in the film, "There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades<U+2014>for reasons never gone into<U+2014>as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium."<ref name="NYT76" /> Sellers's performance earned him a further nomination at the [[34th Golden Globe Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The 23rd Annual Golden Globe Awards (1977)|url=http://cdn.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1976|work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>

In March 1976 Sellers began dating actress [[Lynne Frederick]], whom he married on 18 February 1977.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=192}} Biographer Roger Lewis documents that of all of Sellers's wives, Frederick was the most poorly treated; Julian Upton likened it to a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight, a relationship which "oscillated from ardour to hatred, reconciliation and remorse."{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=58}} Peter Evans claims that Milligan detested his friend's choice of partner and believed she was to blame for his increasing alcohol and cocaine dependency.<ref name="Evans Dynamite" /> On 20 March 1977, Sellers suffered a second major heart attack during a flight from Paris to London; he was subsequently fitted with a [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]].{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=58}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Buchan|first=David|title=Sellers 'op'|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|date=29 March 1977|location=London|page=7}}</ref> Sellers returned from his illness to undertake ''[[Revenge of the Pink Panther]]''; although a commercial success, the critics were tiring of Inspector Clouseau. Julian Upton expressed the view that the strain behind the scenes began to manifest itself in the sluggish pace of the film, describing it as a "laboured, stunt-heavy hotchpotch of half-baked ideas and rehashed gags."{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=58}} Sellers too had become tired of the role, saying after production, "I've honestly had enough of Clouseau<U+2014>I've got nothing more to give".{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=131}} [[Steven Bach]], the senior vice-president and head of worldwide productions for [[United Artists]], who worked with Sellers on ''Revenge Of The Pink Panther'', considered that Sellers was "deeply unbalanced, if not committable: that was the source of his genius and his truly quite terrifying aspects as manipulator and hysteric".{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=591}} He refused to seek professional help for his mental issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-103152085.html|title=Rebuilding Peter Sellers|publisher=''The Record'' (Bergen County, NJ)|date=5 December 2004|accessdate=4 August 2012}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Sellers would claim that he had no personality and was almost unnoticeable, which meant that he "needed a strongly defined character to play".<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Mr Peter Sellers|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=25 July 1980|location=London|page=16}}</ref> He would make similar references throughout his life: when he appeared on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in 1978, a guest appearance which earned him an [[Emmy]] nomination for Outstanding Continuing or Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Variety or Music,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/muppet-show|title=The Muppet Show|publisher=[[Emmys]]|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> he chose not to appear as himself, instead appearing in a variety of costumes and accents.

=== ''Being There'', ''Fu Manchu'' and marital problems (1979<U+2013>80) ===

In 1979, Sellers starred alongside Lynne Frederick, [[Lionel Jeffries]] and [[Elke Sommer]] in [[Richard Quine]]'s ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1979 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]''. He portrayed three roles, including King Rudolf IV and King Rudolf V<U+2014>rulers of the fictional small nation of Ruritania<U+2014>and Syd Frewin, Rudolf V's half-brother. Upon its release in May 1979, the film was well received; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''The New York Times'' observed how Sellers divided "his energies between a serious character and a funny one, but that it was his serious performance which was more impressive."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9506EED61439E732A25756C2A9639C946890D6CF|title=The Prisoner of Zenda (1979)|author=Maslin, Janet|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=25 May 1979|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> However, Philip French, for ''The Observer'', was unimpressed by the film, describing it as "a mess of porridge" and stating that "Sellers reveals that he cannot draw the line between the sincere and the sentimental".<ref name="French Zenda" />

Later in 1979, Sellers starred opposite [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Melvyn Douglas]] and [[Jack Warden]] in the [[black comedy]] ''[[Being There]]'' as Chance, a mindless, emotionless gardener addicted to watching TV.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=357}} In a BBC interview in 1971, Sellers had said that more than anything else, he wanted to play the role, and successfully persuaded the author of the book [[Jerzy Kosinski]] to allow him and director [[Hal Ashby]] to make the film, provided he could write the script.<ref name="Smith" />{{sfn|Dawson|2009|p=211}} During the filming, in order to remain in character, Sellers refused most interview requests and kept his distance from the other actors.{{sfn|Dawson|2009|p=211}} Sellers considered Chance's walking and voice the character's most important attributes, and in preparing for the role, he worked alone with a tape recorder, or with his wife, and then with Ashby, to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal "the childlike mind behind the words".{{sfn|Dawson|2009|p=211}}  Sellers described his experience of working on the film as "so humbling, so powerful", and co-star Shirley MacLaine found Sellers "a dream" to work with.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=204}} Sellers's performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the "crowning triumph of Peter Sellers's remarkable career".<ref name="Smith" />  Critic [[Frank Rich]] wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role, with a "schismatic personality that Peter had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique&nbsp;... A lesser actor would have made the character's mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic&nbsp;... [His] intelligence was always deeper, his onscreen confidence greater, his technique much more finely honed":<ref name="Rich" /> in achieving this, Sellers "makes the film's fantastic premise credible".<ref name="Rich" /> The film earned Sellers a [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award at the [[National Board of Review Awards 1979|51st National Board of Review Awards]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Awards for 1979|url=http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=1979|work=NBR Awards|publisher=[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]]|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> the [[London Critics Circle Film Awards]] Special Achievement Award, the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award at the [[1979 New York Film Critics Circle Awards|45th New York Film Critics Circle Awards]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Sellers: The Official Site|url=http://www.petersellers.com/about/awards.html|work=Peter Sellers: Awards|publisher=The Estate of Peter Sellers|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;<U+2013> Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor&nbsp;<U+2013> Musical or Comedy]] award at the [[37th Golden Globe Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The 37th Annual Golden Globe Awards (1980)|url=http://cdn.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1979|work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> Additionally, Sellers was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award at the [[52nd Academy Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The 52nd Academy Awards (1980) Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/52nd-winners.html|work=Oscar Legacy|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] award at the [[34th British Academy Film Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=BAFTA Awards 1980|url= http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?year=1980&category=false&award=false|work=BAFTA Awards Database|publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>

In March 1980 Sellers asked his fifteen-year-old daughter Victoria what she thought about ''Being There'': she reported later that, "I said yes, I thought it was great. But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.&nbsp;... he went mad. He threw his drink over me and told me to get the next plane home."{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=374}} His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father."{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=374}}

Sellers's last film was ''[[The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'', a comedic re-imagining of the [[Fu Manchu|eponymous adventure novels]] by [[Sax Rohmer]]; Sellers played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside [[Helen Mirren]] and [[David Tomlinson]]. The production of the film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors<U+2014>[[Richard Quine]] and [[John Avildsen]]<U+2014>both fired before the script had been completed.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=242}} Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=212}} with his ill-health often causing delays.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=213}} Arguments between Sellers and director [[Piers Haggard]] led to Haggard's firing at Sellers's instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=370<U+2013>371}} [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the film as "an indefensibly inept comedy",<ref name="Shales" /> adding that "it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. "Manchu" will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as ''Tell Me Where It Hurts'', ''The Bobo'' and ''The Prisoner of Zenda''".<ref name="Shales" />

Sellers's final performances were a series of advertisements for [[Barclays Bank]]. Filmed in April 1980 in Ireland, he played a Jewish conman, Monty Casino.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=47}} Four adverts were scheduled, but only three were filmed as Sellers collapsed in Dublin, again with heart problems.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=375}}{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=215}} After two days in care<U+2014>and against the advice of his doctors<U+2014>he travelled to the [[Cannes Film Festival]], where ''Being There'' was in competition.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=375<U+2013>376}} Sellers was again ill in Cannes, returning to his residence in Gstaad to work on the script for his next project, ''[[Romance of the Pink Panther]]''.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=246}}{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=217}} He agreed to undergo an [[Angiography|angiogram]] at the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles, to see if he was able to undergo open-heart surgery.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=379}} Spike Milligan later considered that Sellers's heart condition had lasted fifteen years and had "made life difficult for him and had a debilitating effect on his personality".<ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /> His fourth marriage was also about to collapse.{{sfn|Sellers|1981|p=222}}{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=379}}

Sellers had recently started to rebuild his relationship with his son Michael after the failure of the latter's marriage.

On 21 July 1980, Sellers arrived in London from Geneva. He checked into the Dorchester Hotel, before visiting [[Golders Green Crematorium]] for the first time to see the location of his parents' ashes.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=380}} He had plans to attend a reunion dinner with his ''Goon Show'' partners Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe, scheduled for the evening of 22 July.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=246}} On the day of the dinner, Sellers took lunch in his hotel suite and shortly afterwards collapsed from a heart attack.

Following Sellers's death, fellow actor [[Richard Attenborough]] said that Sellers "had the genius comparable to Chaplin",<ref name="Penny (1980)"/> while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as "a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts he gave to the world. For them, he is assured of a place in the history of art as entertainment."<ref name="Boulting" /> [[Burt Kwouk]], who appeared as Cato in the ''Pink Panther'' films stated that "Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain&nbsp;... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything".{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=382}} Director Blake Edwards thought that "Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing".<ref name="D Mirror (1980)" /> Sellers's friend and ''Goon Show'' colleague Harry Secombe said "I'm shattered.

A private funeral service was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 26 July, conducted by Sellers's old friend, Canon John Hester;{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=246}} his final joke was the playing of "[[In the Mood]]" by [[Glenn Miller]], a tune he hated.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=7}} His body was cremated and his ashes were interred at Golders Green Crematorium in London.

Although Sellers was reportedly in the process of excluding Frederick from his will a week before he died, she inherited almost his entire estate worth an estimated <U+00A3>4.5 million (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|4500000|1980}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} pounds){{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}} while his children received <U+00A3>800 each<ref name="mail will" /> (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|800|1980}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} pounds).{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}} Spike Milligan appealed to her on behalf of Sellers's three children, but she refused to increase the amount.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=384}}{{efn|Frederick subsequently married [[David Frost]]; she divorced him and married a cardiologist, Dr Barry Unger: she died in 1994 after struggling with drug and alcohol dependency.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=384}}}} Sellers's only son, Michael, died of a heart attack at 52 during surgery on 24 July 2006, 26 years to the day after his father's death.{{sfn|Sellers|Morecambe|2000|p=}}

In 1982, Blake Edwards tried to continue with ''Romance of the Pink Panther'' and offered the role of Clouseau to [[Dudley Moore]], who turned it down. Edwards subsequently released ''[[Trail of the Pink Panther]]'', which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three ''Panther'' films.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=385}} Frederick saw the film as an exploitation of Sellers, and she successfully sued the film's producers for unauthorised use of her late husband's image.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=385<U+2013>386}}

Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said of the Pink Panther films, "I'm not sure why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, though it may be because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic self-absorption that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable<U+2014>instead of alarming<U+2014>and finally so funny."<ref name="NYT76">{{cite web|author=Canby, Vincent|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04E3DD133FE334BC4E52DFB467838D669EDE|title=The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976)|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=16 December 1976|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> Film critic [[Elvis Mitchell]] has said that Sellers was one of the few comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he's really like in real life.<ref>{{cite web|author=Simon, Scott|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-103117053.html|title=Profile: Movie on HBO examines the life of Peter Sellers |publisher=NPR Weekend Edition <U+2013> Saturday|date=4 December 2004|accessdate=4 August 2012}} {{subscription required}}</ref> A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured they always retain their dignity.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=164}} On his playing of Clouseau Sellers said: "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching."{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=97}} His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are."{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=270}} Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the ''Pink Panther'' films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to [[Nineteenth-century theatre#Naturalism and Realism|Edwardian sophisticated naturalism]]".{{sfn|Wasson|2009|p=86}} This combination of "high" and "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was "the sole representative of humanity".{{sfn|Wasson|2009|p=87}} Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a "balance between character and absurdity".<ref name="Powell (1980)" /> Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".<ref name="Penny (1980)" />

Author Aaron Sultanik observed that in Sellers's early films, such as ''I'm Alright Jack'', he displays "deft, technical interpretations [that] pinpoint the mechanical nature of his comic characterization", which "reduces each of his characters to a series of gross, awkward tics".{{sfn|Sultanik|1986|p=86}} Academic Cynthia Baron observed that Sellers's external characterisations led to doubt with reviewers as to whether Sellers's work was "true" acting.{{sfn|Baron|2012|p=138}}{{efn|Baron goes on to note that much of the "true acting" question was due to the "polemical publicity" of [[Lee Strasberg]] that British characterisation led to artificial performances in contrast to method acting.{{sfn|Baron|2012|p=138}}}} Critic [[Tom Milne]] saw a change over Sellers's career and thought that his "comic genius as a character actor was&nbsp;... stifled by his elevation to leading man" and his later films suffered as a result.<ref name="Milne (1980)" /> Sultanik agreed, commenting that Sellers's "exceptional vocal and physical technique" was under-used during his career in the US.{{sfn|Sultanik|1986|p=86}}

Academics Maria Pramaggiore and Tom Wallis remarked that Sellers fits the mould of a technical actor because he displays a mastery of physical characterisation, such as accent or physical trait.{{sfn|Pramaggiore|Wallis|2005|p=86}} Writer and playwright [[John Mortimer]] saw the process for himself when Sellers was about to undertake filming on Mortimer's ''[[The Dock Brief]]'' and could not decide how to play the character of the barrister. By chance he ordered [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockles]] for lunch and the smell brought back a memory of the seaside town of [[Morecambe]]: this gave him "the idea of a faded North Country accent and the suggestion of a scrappy moustache".<ref name="Mortimer (1980)" /> So important was the voice as the starting point for character development Sellers would walk round London with a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]], recording voices to study at home.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=72}}
