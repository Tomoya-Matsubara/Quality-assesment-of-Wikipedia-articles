A '''rhombic icosahedron''' (or '''rhombic icosacontahedron''') is a [[polyhedron]] shaped like an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[sphere]]. 

It is composed of 20 rhombic faces, of which three, four, or five meet at each vertex. It has 10 faces on the polar axis with 10 rhombi following the equator.

Even though all the faces are congruent, the rhombic icosahedron is not [[face-transitive]], since one may distinguish whether a particular face is near the equator or a pole by examining the types of vertices surrounding that face.

The rhombic icosahedron is a [[zonohedron]] that is dual to an irregular-faced [[pentagonal gyrobicupola]].

It has [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|D<sub>5d</sub>]] symmetry.
