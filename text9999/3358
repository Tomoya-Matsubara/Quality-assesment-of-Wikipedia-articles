The first season of the American television series ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', or simply ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', is based on the [[Marvel Comics]] organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), a fictional peacekeeping and spy agency in a world populated with [[superhero]]es and numerous supernatural phenomena. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. The season originally aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 24, 2013, through May 13, 2014, over 22 episodes.

The season revolves around the character of [[Phil Coulson]], with [[Clark Gregg]] reprising his role from the film series, and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who are assigned to several dangerous cases. The cases revolve around Project Centipede and its leader, [[John Garrett (comics)|The Clairvoyant]], while Coulson also searches for answers concerning his mysterious resurrection after dying in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''. Several other characters from MCU films and [[Marvel One-Shots]] also appear throughout the season, with some episodes directly crossing over with the films ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. It was produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], and the executive producers were [[Joe Quesada]], [[Jeffrey Bell]], [[Jeph Loeb]], [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], S.H.I.E.L.D. creator [[Stan Lee]], and series creators [[Joss Whedon]], [[Jed Whedon]], and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]].

The [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|series premiere]] was watched by 12.12 million viewers, the highest ratings received by the first episode of a drama series in the United States since the pilot episode of ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'' in 2009. The season initially received a mixed reception, which also mirrored a decrease in ratings as the season progressed. However, reception grew more positive as the season progressed into its second half, which led to more consistent ratings. A [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] began airing on ABC on September 23, 2014.<ref name="S2Premiere"/>

Once there, the team quickly realizes that the object is a piece of forgotten [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] technology powered by [[Cosmic Cube#Film|Tesseract]] energy.

 |ShortSummary = S.H.I.E.L.D. searches for one of its assets, [[Graviton (comics)|Dr. Franklin Hall]], who was kidnapped by Ian Quinn, CEO of Quinn Worldwide, using a gravity-based device. Quinn wants to use Hall to take control of the planet's gravity by building a giant "gravitonium" generator. Heading to [[Malta]] with the team, Skye volunteers to infiltrate Quinn's mansion during a party so that Coulson and Ward can rescue Hall. Skye tricks Quinn into believing she is betraying S.H.I.E.L.D. for the Rising Tide. However, Coulson soon discovers that Hall perpetrated his own escape in order to find the gravitonium along with the generator and destroy both. Coulson warns him that doing so would end up killing millions. Their violent disagreement forces Coulson to send Hall into the generator, seemingly vaporizing him, but shutting the machine down at the same time. Coulson orders that the gravitonium be placed under S.H.I.E.L.D. high security and off the books; however, S.H.I.E.L.D. does not notice that Hall is still somehow alive within the gravitonium.

Raina injects him with Extremis to increase his power, before harvesting his blood platelets for further experimentation. Skye knows a hacker who could have released the information on Chan<U+2019>s location and abilities, and secretly sleeps with him, trying to discover the truth. May finds them and, not trusting Skye, arrests them. S.H.I.E.L.D. attacks the Centipede facility, and attempts to help Chan, but he refuses and May activates the unstable Extremis within him to kill him. Coulson questions Skye, and she reveals that she joined the Rising Tide and S.H.I.E.L.D to find her parents. Coulson agrees to help her, but fits her with a device to block any computer access.

 |ShortSummary = The team investigate a series of deaths involving levitation and electrostatic anomalies. Although the team initially assumed the deaths were caused by some form of weapon, the cause is found to be an alien virus from a [[Chitauri]] helmet salvaged from the [[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|Battle of New York]]. When Simmons is infected by the fatal virus, she and Fitz work feverishly on a cure while Coulson ignores a direct order from Agent Blake to sacrifice Simmons and save the rest of the team. With time running out and unaware that their last attempt at a vaccine was successful, Simmons leaps from the plane, though Ward manages to save her by jumping out after her and inoculate her before she dies. May tells Coulson, who feels different to before he died, that anyone would be changed by such an experience. The helmet is delivered to Agent Blake, who warns Coulson of the consequences of disobeying a direct order from headquarters, though Coulson dismisses this, accepting that he is different now.

 |ShortSummary = While at a S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy Ward, Fitz, Simmons, and Skye investigate an attack upon Seth, a popular cadet, with an "ice machine"  that can freeze people and their surroundings. Another ice machine soon freezes cadet [[Blizzard (comics)#Donald Gill|Donnie Gill]], though the agents are able to save him. While the rest of the team interrogates the other cadets, Fitz befriends Donnie, seeing much of himself in him, and helps him solve a problem with a new power source. Meanwhile, Coulson and May go to Mexico City to find a former agent named Richard Lumley, who tells them of a mission 24 years earlier involving Skye, an 0-8-4 with apparent superhuman abilities. The team deduces that the cadets are building a bigger ice machine for Quinn, and with the better power source, Seth and Donnie give Quinn a demonstration, creating a massive ice storm. Though the team apprehends Donnie, Seth is killed by the storm, and Donnie gains apparent [[cryokinetic]] abilities. Later, Coulson calls Quinn, who has connections to the "Clairvoyant".

 |ShortSummary = Hunting the Clairvoyant, the team boards a train in [[Italy]] on which a Cybertek Inc. security group is shipping a package to Quinn. The group is exposed, forcing Coulson and Ward to flee the train. Meeting up with May, they get back to the train and Simmons, but Fitz and Skye are gone, having already followed the package to Quinn's mansion. Skye is confronted by Quinn, and discovers the alive Peterson in a [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric chamber]]. Inside the package is a high-tech prosthetic leg from Cybertek's "Project Deathlok" that Quinn fits onto Peterson's amputated right leg. Peterson leaves to carry out the Clairvoyant's orders, while Quinn shoots Skye twice in the stomach and leaves her for dead. S.H.I.E.L.D. raids the mansion and finds Skye after capturing Quinn. Simmons can only sustain Skye temporarily by placing her in the hyperbaric chamber.

 |ShortSummary = Skye is rushed to a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility, but the doctors are only able to stabilize her. Agents John Garrett and Antoine Triplett arrive to take Quinn for questioning, but Coulson refuses to turn him over. Garrett decides to interrogate Quinn on the Bus, learning that the Clairvoyant ordered Quinn to shoot Skye so they could learn about Coulson's resurrection. Fitz and Simmons, after looking over Coulson's files, realize that Coulson was revived at a place known as the "Guest House", where Coulson, Ward, Garrett, and Fitz head for answers. Fitz finds the drug, while Coulson finds a room marked "T.A.H.I.T.I." where he finds the source of the drug, the upper half of a [[Kree|blue-skinned humanoid]] corpse. Everyone escapes the facility, which was rigged to explode, and despite Coulson attempting to prevent Fitz from giving Skye the drug based on what he saw in the T.A.H.I.T.I. room, Fitz gets the drug to Simmons in time to successfully save Skye.

 |ShortSummary = Agents Garrett, Triplett, Hand, Sitwell, and Blake join the team in hunt of the Clairvoyant. The agents pair up to pursue different candidates. While searching for Thomas Nash, May and Blake encounter Peterson / Deathlok and tag him with a tracker. They soon converge on his new location while Triplett and Simmons stay at the Hub with Hand. The team finds Nash, a vegetative man on life support who communicates through a computer. When Nash boasts about being the Clairvoyant and says that Centipede will kill Skye, Ward kills him. Coulson and Skye soon realize that Nash was not the Clairvoyant, and that the Clairvoyant is a high-ranking member of S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson accuses Ward of working with the Clairvoyant and shooting Nash, but they are interrupted when Fitz discovers May's secret phone line. As Coulson and Skye standoff with May in the hangar, control of the Bus is hijacked by the Hub, where Hand orders everyone onboard to be killed.<!--DO NOT ADD ABOUT THE CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDER SCENE AT THE END OF THIS EPISODE.

At the Hub, Simmons and Triplett begin working together to secretly upload Simmons's research on Skye's blood, only for a Hydra assault on all S.H.I.E.L.D. facilities to force them into hiding. Coulson locks May in the interrogation room with Ward, still believing she is the traitor. Skye discovers a secret code in a signal on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s network that she deciphers to reveal Hydra's infiltration. When the Bus arrives at the Hub, the group splits into teams to capture Hand. However, Hand reveals that she is not a member of Hydra but believes that Coulson is, and recruits Triplett and Simmons to aid her in stopping them. Garrett accidentally discloses information that reveals himself as the true Clairvoyant, and is captured by Coulson and May. Ward accompanies Hand to the Fridge so he can see to Garrett's imprisonment personally, but shortly reveals his own allegiance to Hydra by killing Hand and freeing Garrett.

 |ShortSummary = Ward frees Raina and introduces Garrett to her as the Clairvoyant. Though disappointed that he is not actually clairvoyant, she agrees to try to replicate the "Guest House" drug. Colonel [[Glenn Talbot]] sends a military team to the Hub, so Coulson leaves with the team and Triplett, ordering Skye to erase all their identities, including Ward's. Coulson discovers a message with coordinates in the Canadian wilderness, where they discover the hidden S.H.I.E.L.D. base Providence, run by Agent [[Eric Koenig]].

Ward and Garrett infiltrate the Fridge, freeing its prisoners and stealing weapons, including the Berserker Staff, the 0-8-4 from Peru, and the gravitonium. Raina informs Garrett that the hard drive containing all of Skye and Simmons' research is locked and only Skye can access it, prompting Garrett to send Ward to Providence.

Coulson takes Fitz, Simmons, and Triplett to stop [[Blackout (comics)|Marcus Daniels]], a superhuman and former Fridge inmate possessing the [[Darkforce]] who is obsessed with cellist Audrey Nathan, Coulson's former love interest. After rescuing Audrey, they devise a plan to lure out Daniels. The group overloads him with energy, causing him to explode.

 |ShortSummary = In flashbacks, a teenage Ward is seen in juvenile detention where he first meets Garrett, and accepts his offer to join his organization. Over the years, Garrett trains Ward, and eventually tells him about Hydra. In the present, Coulson and May infiltrate Cybertek (who they realize is connected to Centipede and Hydra) and learn that Garrett was the first Deathlok, his implants are failing, and he needs the Guest House drug to survive. The team travels to [[Havana, Cuba]], finding the recently abandoned Hydra base, and Fitz and Simmons find the captured Bus. The latter are caught by Ward and taken aboard the Bus, which departs. Fitz disables Garrett's implants with an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]], and the dying Garrett orders Ward to kill them. After the two agents lock themselves in the Bus' infirmary, Ward ejects it into the ocean. Raina injects Garrett with her synthesized Guest House drug. Initially it seems to cause an Extremis reaction, but Garrett recovers. Quinn attempts to sell Deathlok soldiers to the military, and invites them to tour Cybertek<U+2019>s facility.

Evading the Centipede soldiers, Coulson and his team attack the Cybertek facility, with Skye saving Peterson's son, May defeating Ward, and Coulson confronting Garrett.

Peterson, unable to face his son, goes off on his own to redeem himself. Fury expresses his respect for Coulson, who he sees as an [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]], and appoints him as the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., leading the team to a secret base run by Agent Billy Koenig. Raina delivers a photo of Skye to a mysterious, blood-soaked man, telling him she has found his daughter. Later, Coulson awakens in the middle of the night and begins exhibiting signs of the same enhanced mental capacities and fixation that Garrett experienced.

===Writing===
{{quote box|width=33%|quote=From day one [Grant Ward] was Hydra in our minds. Now, if that had not worked out, and we felt like he couldn<U+2019>t have accomplished that, if we felt like we needed other options, we could have changed. Here<U+2019>s an example of changing. We didn<U+2019>t know we were going to fall in love with [[Ruth Negga]] the way we did as Raina. She came in for [[Girl in the Flower Dress|episode five]] but we thought <U+2018>She<U+2019>s cool<U+2019> and so we brought her back. So what would have been somebody else became her, and as we fell in love with her character, we wrote more and more to that. We knew [[J. August Richards|J. Richards]] was going to be [[Deathlok]] but we didn<U+2019>t know we were going to care about him as much as we did. When you have actors like that, that you really like, you start writing to them... We knew the kind of person we wanted to bring in as [[John Garrett (comics)|The Clairvoyant]] and we knew we wanted a mislead so we brought in [[Victoria Hand]]. The fact that [[Bill Paxton]] worked out was fantastic. You<U+2019>re going to write that character in a certain way because of who the actor is, so that changes, but we did know we were going to introduce The Clairvoyant, that we were going to introduce he was Hydra and then use that to reveal Ward. Those were things we knew loosely.|source=<U+2014>Jeffrey Bell, executive producer, on the evolving nature of characters and story lines throughout the season.<ref name="BellSep2014" />}}

In July 2013, Maurissa Tancharoen revealed that Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, Jeff Bell, [[Paul Zbyszewski]], [[Monica Owusu-Breen]], [[Brent Fletcher]], Lauren LeFranc, [[Rafe Judkins]], and Shalisha Francis would be the writers for the season.<ref name="SeriesWriters"/>

All the episodes were written with the knowledge that S.H.I.E.L.D. would be destroyed in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', with Jed Whedon saying "It<U+2019>s the kind of thing that if someone told you that concept, you<U+2019>d think it was a great thing to have happen at the beginning of the show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle because we had to quickly establish what a regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D. looks like, what [is] it like to go on a mission, say here<U+2019>s the team, and that there are also different teams all over the world. Then to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson and to put him through the paces as a man dedicated to an organization."<ref name="BuzzFeedMay2014" /> Tancharoen elaborated that "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in ''Captain America 2'', we see the [[Helicarrier]]s literally barreling through the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that. To build our characters up to a point where they have established a bond, and they are working together in a way they<U+2019>ve never worked together before, and to strip away the foundation that they<U+2019>ve dedicated their lives to and the trust they<U+2019>ve now laid with one another, it<U+2019>s a really fun thing to play."<ref name="BuzzFeedMay2014" />

From the beginning it was decided that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying "When we started conceptualizing the show with Joss, knowing [''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''] was coming, we knew there would have to be some sort of personal toll, and there<U+2019>s the version of it where someone gets injured, but since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart."<ref name="BuzzFeedMay2014" /> The individual character arcs were laid out by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.<ref name="BuzzFeedMay2014" />

On whether it was Marvel's idea or the showrunner's idea to have Coulson promoted to Director and tasked with rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. at the end of the season, Jed Whedon said "They<U+2019>re one in the same. They have plans for films, and we have plans to intermingle with them, and it<U+2019>s the name of our show. The second to last episode is called "Ragtag", and that<U+2019>s a term we<U+2019>ve used; we wanted to create this ragtag group, but within this giant organization with billions of dollars and support all over the globe and satellite feeds on their luxurious plane. Now we have a chance to start them over and figure out what it<U+2019>s like to really be a secret again."<ref name="BuzzFeedMay2014" />

Then when he came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it."<ref name="PaxtonIGN" /> In February, B.J. Britt was cast as Agent Triplett, described as being an associate of Garrett.<ref name="Britt" /> [[Saffron Burrows]],<ref name="BurrowsRecurring" /> [[David Conrad]],<ref name="ConradRecurring" /> and [[Ruth Negga]]<ref name="Negga" /><ref name="NeggaRecurring" /> recur as [[Victoria Hand]], Ian Quinn, and Raina, respectively, throughout the season.

In January 2013, [[Cobie Smulders]], who played agent [[Maria Hill]] in ''The Avengers'', said that her character may make an appearance in the show and that her commitment to ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' would not prevent her from participating.<ref name="Cobie"/> Smulders reprised her role as Maria Hill in the pilot, with Joss Whedon saying, "I wanted very much to have Cobie in the pilot because as much as anyone else, she ''is'' S.H.I.E.L.D. She's cool and commanding, and has the dry humor that plays so well with Clark's."<ref name="Cobie2"/> Smulders returned once again in the role in the episode "Nothing Personal".<ref name="Smulders1x20" /> In June 2013, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] expressed interest in guest starring as S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury]],<ref name="Jackson"/> and subsequently appeared in the second episode "[[0-8-4]]".<ref name="Jackson084" /> Jackson makes a second appearance in the season finale.<ref name="JacksonS1Finale" /> During the episode "The Well", [[Chris Hemsworth]] appears as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] via archival footage from ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''.<ref name="HemsworthTDW" /><ref name="HemsworthTW" /> [[Maximiliano Hern<U+00E1>ndez]],<ref name="HernandezSHIELD" /> [[Titus Welliver]],<ref name="WelliverSHIELD" /> and [[Jaimie Alexander]]<ref name="AlexanderSHIELD" /> reprised their roles as [[Jasper Sitwell]], Felix Blake, and [[Sif (comics)|Sif]], respectively, from previous MCU films and [[Marvel One-Shots]] during the season.

===Design===
[[Storyboards]] were used throughout the season, to "put the director, stunts, camera, FX and the crew on the same page", though Joss Whedon did not use them for the pilot. One of the storyboard artists, Warren Drummond, noted the process was different to that on films, because there was limited time to complete the work, and because the storyboard artists were often working with different directors for each episode. Most of the sequences storyboarded were action or science fiction sequences.<ref name="Storyboards" /> The main recurring setting for the season is the Bus, a retrofitted [[Boeing C-17]], that serves as both the transportation and headquarters of the titular team. The Bus includes such features as a soundproof interrogation room, a forensics and research lab located on the lower deck, where Fitz and Simmons work, and a cargo hold directly outside the lab where the team parks its SUV and Lola, Coulson's prized [[Chevy Corvette|1962 Corvette]].<ref name="TVGuide3.10.14" />

===Filming===
The pilot was produced almost entirely in [[Los Angeles]] to accommodate Joss Whedon's busy schedule.<ref name="Jan2013LeeInterview2" /> Subsequent episodes were also produced in Los Angeles,<ref name="Oct2013Armand" /> as well as [[Culver City, California]],<ref name="VFX1" /> though additional filming took place around the world, including in [[Paris]], [[France]], for "[[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Pilot]]",<ref name="Oct2013Dalton" /> and in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], for "[[Eye Spy (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Eye Spy]]".<ref name="Oct2013Armand" />

The stunt coordinator for the season was Tanner Gill.<ref name="LacovaraInterview" /> In September 2013, Ming-Na Wen talked about stunts and action scenes on the series, saying "I train. I work out and I have great stunt coordinators and choreographers to help me through every step and with the magic of filmmaking and editing, it all brings about her skills, to another level. That has to be very believable ... I think the hardest part is doing the actual stunts, the stunt-fighting. That's a whole other thing. I'm not really punching out the stunt guy, nor are they hitting me, so it's learning this dance, really, within the fight. It's how to pull back, how to take a hit and make it look real.<ref name="WenHitFix" /> 

As with many Marvel projects, secrecy was a big issue.  For instance, it was a challenge keeping Samuel L. Jackson's cameo in "[[0-8-4]]" a surprise due to "this age of tweets and spoilers".<ref name="BellOct2013" /> The showrunners had been exposed to this while working on ''The Avengers'', but with their own series they were able to see "all the details that go into keeping everything under lock and key".<ref name="BuzzFeedMay2014" />

===Visual effects===
The visual effects supervisor for the season was Mark Kolpack,<ref name="VFX1" /> with Los Angeles-based visual effects company FuseFX the main visual effects vendor. David Altenau was the in-house VFX supervisor for "Pilot" and the first 8 episodes, with Matt Von Brock overseeing the computer generated imagery on the show. Kevin Lingenfelser started the season focused on 2D supervising, but took over as lead in-house visual effects supervisor after episode 8. Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, and though creative leadership stayed consistent during the series, producers, compositors and various artists were able to alternate episodes. This was important because most of the episodes had to be worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.<ref name="VFX2" /> 

[[File:The Bus from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.png|thumb|right|250px|The Bus is a modified C17 transport plane. The digital model used in the series was designed and created by FuseFX.|alt=Digital model of "the Bus" from the series.]]
For the Bus, Altenau explained that it "has all kinds of S.H.I.E.L.D. technology that is revealed over time as the series progresses. This includes an extra wing and engines in the rear giving the plane the ability to operate vertically for take-offs and landings, and even mid-flight u-turns ... FuseFX was given the opportunity to design the Bus. The design included many features from the start, such as the ability to do vertical take-offs and landing". FuseFX designed the Bus, and "Extreme attention was paid when designing the textures and rigging for this asset. Half a dozen 8k maps make up the details on the plane which allows the camera to get right up to the surface of the plane without any loss of detail. A very complex rig controls every aspect of the plane from the landing gear, engine transformation, doors opening, lighting and even the wings have flex controls for the animators to sell the weight of this massive aircraft. When the engines are in vertical flight mode they have several degrees of rotation which gives the jet a lot of maneuvering ability."<ref name="VFX2" /> 

FuseFX also worked on Lola, Coulson<U+2019>s "vintage 1962 Corvette" which was described as "a classic car and beautiful in its own right, but through digital effects, Fuse has added hovercraft capabilities. When Coulson needs it, the wheel<U+2019>s rotate into a horizontal position, exposing hidden jet engine ducts that create lifting thrust through the rims of the tires, which double as turbo-fan blades. We worked closely with production to help design the mechanism and the look of the hovercraft engines. It<U+2019>s [[Stark Industries|Stark]] technology designed to be consistent with the period aspect of the car."<ref name="VFX2" /> When the real Corvette is shown transitioning to its hover mode, volumetric dust, exhaust, and particle effects are added. Occasionally, FuseFX was required to use a fully digital model of the car, which matches the real vehicle precisely.<ref name="VFX1" /> 

===Music===
In addition to the series' main theme for Coulson, [[Bear McCreary]] composed several other themes that he used throughout the season: themes for Mike Peterson and Project: Centipede were introduced in "Pilot";<ref name="McCrearyPilot" /> a theme for the Agents as a team was introduced in "[[0-8-4]]";<ref name="McCreary084" /> the Skye theme was introduced in "[[The Asset]]";<ref name="McCrearyAsset" /> a theme for both Fitz and Simmons together was introduced in "[[FZZT]]";<ref name="McCrearyFZZT" /> a theme for Victoria Hand and The Hub, which served as the theme for 'Big S.H.I.E.L.D.', as opposed to Coulson's 'little S.H.I.E.L.D.' team, was introduced in "[[The Hub (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Hub]]".<ref name="McCrearyHub" /> McCreary opted not to reprise any themes from the films during the season, notably composing his own themes for the [[Cosmic Cube#Film|Tesseract]] and [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], which he acknowledged had already appeared in several films.<ref name="McCreary084" /><ref name="McCrearyWell" />

===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===
In June 2013, Clark Gregg explained how the series would tie into the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|Marvel Cinematic Universe films]]: "...the exciting part is going to be seeing the way that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Captain America 2]]'', and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show."<ref name="June2013GreggInterview"/> Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from ''The Avengers'', saying "It<U+2019>s gotta be a show that works for people who haven<U+2019>t seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think."<ref name="Aug2012WhedonInterview"/> He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 [[Toronto International Film Festival]], explaining "It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent [to ''The Avengers'']... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And that, to me, is that they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [lack of powers] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me."<ref name="Sep2012WhedonInterview"/>

Ultimately, the season featured several tie-in episodes with Marvel Cinematic Universe films: the episode "The Well" takes place directly after the events of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'';<ref name="EWNov2013" /> the episode "T.A.H.I.T.I." introduces the alien race the [[Kree]] to the MCU (confirmed as such in the second season), members of which play a significant role in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'';<ref name="BennetKree" /><ref name="BennetBellKree" /> and the episodes "End of the Beginning" and "Turn, Turn, Turn" revolve around the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.<ref name="ZapNov2013" /><ref name="HitfixPg1" /> Due to ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' revealing that Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. with sleeper agents, the season sees a retooling for the final six episodes. Regarding the synergy the show has with addressing events from the films, Loeb said "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else out there in the entertainment business". The characters face the Hydra issue head on, while experiencing trust issues within themselves. Jed Whedon added that the Hydra element, which the show could not mention until after the release of ''The Winter Soldier'' in order to avoid spoiling the film, also attempts to address the lack of characters from the comics, a complaint fans had throughout the season, while also tying established threats such as the Clairvoyant, Project Centipede, and Deathlok, back into Hydra.<ref name="USATodayHYDRA" />

Along with the premiere in the United States on ABC, the season began airing in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] on September 24, 2013.<ref name="CanadianRatings"/> In the United Kingdom, the season debuted three days later on [[Channel 4]],<ref name="UKRatings"/> while it began airing on the [[Seven Network]] in Australia on October 2, 2013,<ref name="AUSBroadcast2"/> and in New Zealand on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] on February 16, 2014.<ref name="NewZealandRatings" />

===="The Art of Level Seven"====
[[File:Agents of SHIELD final Art of Level Seven poster.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The final "The Art of Level Seven" poster, highlighting several changes made to the series since the release of the first official poster.|alt=Final Art of Level Seven poster.]]
For the final six episodes, Marvel began the "''Marvel<U+2019>s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': The Art of Level Seven" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode. Bell stated that the initiative was a way to tie the series back to its comics roots, and was thought of at the beginning of the season. The production team tried to pair specific artists to the teaser posters based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode.<ref name="TurnTurnTurnPoster" /> The art also appeared as [[variant cover]]s to select titles published by [[Marvel Comics]] in August 2014. Jeph Loeb stated, "It's exciting to bring this art to life once more, exclusively at comic book stores, and to give fans a chance to own the ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' art in a different format."<ref name="ArtLevel7Variants" />

The poster for "Turn, Turn, Turn", created by Mike Del Mundo, depicts a maze forming the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo and show title, with a rat inside, hinting ominously at S.H.I.E.L.D.<U+2019>s corruption and a possible traitor.<ref name="TurnTurnTurnPoster" /> The poster for "Providence", created by [[Paolo Rivera]], highlights the rise of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] by showing a melded Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, and depicts the team divided by Coulson, Raina, and Ward.<ref name="ProvidencePoster" /> The poster for "The Only Light in The Darkness", created by Pascal Campion, focuses on Coulson and his cellist lover, Audrey, while also hinting at the villain for the episode, [[Blackout (comics)|Marcus Daniels]].<ref name="LightDarkPoster" /> The poster for "Nothing Personal", created by Stephanie Hans,  highlights Skye and Ward in a depiction of a moment from the episode, with Deathlok looming over them, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background.<ref name="NothingPersonalPoster" /> The poster for "Ragtag", created by Emma R<U+00ED>os, depicts significant moments in Ward<U+2019>s life, as well as Fitz<U+2013>Simmons in danger, and Skye looming behind the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, as if she is a presence that Ward cannot seem to shake.<ref name="RagtagPoster" /> The poster for "Beginning of the End", created by Phantom City Creative, is reminiscent of the first official poster released, with differences including the characters' order and clothing, the poster's coloring, a broken S.H.I.E.L.D. logo over Hydra's, and Ward being tinted by Hydra.<ref name="BeginningEndPoster" />

===Critical response===
The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an 86% approval rating with an average rating of 8/10 based on 43 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is sure to please comic book fans, but the strong ensemble and brisk pacing help to make this better-than-average superhero show accessible to non-fanboys as well."<ref name="RT" /> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 74 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews."<ref name="MC" /> 

The early screening of the pilot at San Diego Comic-Con International was met with a very positive reaction from the crowd.<ref name="PilotComicCon"/> Critically, the initial screening of the pilot was met with mostly positive reviews, though ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} Brooks Barnes noted that "what goes over well at Comic-Con does not necessarily work in the real world," especially on a network with "''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' moms and ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' grandparents".<ref name="NYTPilot"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s initial reactions were that if everything that made the show appealing&mdash; its continuity with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its continuance of ''The Avengers'' storyline, and Whedon's return to television, were stripped from it, the show would still work. However, they also questioned whether the show was accessible enough to attract a wider audience.<ref name="EWPilotInitial"/>

Evan Valentine, writing for Collider, divided the season into highs and lows: highs included the ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' crossover, with Valentine noting that "The creators had clearly known this moment was coming ... and did a great job of capitalizing [on] it," as well as other tie-ins with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he praised Gregg's performance, stating "What made us fall in love with the character from the first ''Iron Man'' to his death in ''The Avengers'' is still alive and kicking"; lows of the season included the episodes before the ''Winter Soldier'' tie-in, with Valentine feeling that the series "became the show that had to stall its developments and character building to make way for the [tie-in]." He also criticized the rest of the main cast, though he did approve of the guest and supporting cast members, and he criticized the series' use of minor comic book characters and concepts, singling out the costume design for Deathlok as "horrid" and not scary.<ref name="ColliderSeasonReview" /> 

Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] gave the season a 7.5 out of 10, calling it "a fun, lighthearted, but fairly disposable piece of entertainment", noting that it improved through the season, especially following the ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' tie-in, and that by the end of the season, the series "was starting to come into its own". Though he found the main cast's performances to all be good, and praised the strong guest and recurring stars, Goldman found the main characterizations to be weak during the first half of the season, and he also criticized the pacing of certain overarching plotlines, noting "the mystery of Coulson<U+2019>s return, Skye<U+2019>s parentage, etc. <U+2013> moved far too slow, with relatively minor revelations treated as though they were big reveals".<ref name="IGNSeasonReview"/> 

[[Jim Steranko]], an artist and writer who worked on 18 of the ''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' comic books between 1966 and 1968, was critical of the pilot episode, lamenting that "the show had no menace, no tension."<ref name="Steranko"/> For the second episode, Steranko said that it was "too unfocused to be satisfying," but praised Jackson's cameo as Nick Fury as "an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be."<ref name="Steranko2"/> In contrast, Steranko's opinion of some later episodes in the first season were more positive, congratulating the writer and director of "The End of the Beginning" for "finding an entertaining, bravura groove that finally brings the concept to life",<ref name="Steranko3"/> and saying of the next episode "I was concerned that last week<U+2019>s bravura transformation was only a fluke, but it was apparent from the opening moments that the exec lineup<U+2019>s new image-and-edit policy was in play."<ref name="Steranko4"/> Overall, however, he found season one to be "22 episodes of 'sanctified' plot and character crumbs being salted with terminally-sluggish velocity (into anemic 'standalone' stories)".<ref name="Steranko5"/>

===Analysis===
Both the way the series was affected by the destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' and the way its characters are depicted rebuilding the organization have been noted by some:

Terri Schwartz, writing for Zap2it following the airing of "Nothing Personal", called the series "incredible", stating that it "got off to a rocky start", but that changed once the ''Winter Soldier'' tie-in took place. Schwartz felt that the season earned many of its early criticisms from having to "bide time" until the crossover, but "Now that it has the freedom to be the series it was always intended to, ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' has turned into a fantastic show. Its connection to Marvel's Cinematic Universe is clear: This is where viewers get to see the fallout of Hydra's S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltration. And the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven."<ref name="Zap2itSeasonReview" />

Merrill Barr, reviewing "Beginning of the End" for ''[[Forbes]]'', reiterated this sentiment, stating that "the series finally stands its ground and stakes its claim as a member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ... By establishing world changing consequences that don<U+2019>t just affect one MCU franchise, but all of them." He continues saying that "what Marvel<U+2019>s daring to say with this season finale is <U+201C>everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.<U+201D> ... It<U+2019>s been a long journey, and there<U+2019>s no question many viewers<U+2019> patience wore thin toward the end, but that never stopped Marvel from pushing forward to one of the most entertaining hours of television this season and finally cementing a deserved place on the small screen."<ref name="ForbesSeasonReview" />

Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt that the series "created a whole new sort of television show: One that must support, and change with, the plot twists of its film family ... never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise." She stated that the ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' crossover "infused ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' with a new energy, and helped explain, perhaps, why the show took so long to find its footing <U+2014> in the writers' room at least ... That ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was able to succeed as a story both independent and ancillary is all but miraculous." She concluded that the series "is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination."<ref name="LATimesSeasonReview" />
