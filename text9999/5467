The '''University of Cambridge''' (often '''Cambridge University'''), located in [[Cambridge]], [[England]], is the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|second-oldest]] university in the English-speaking world and has a [[University of Cambridge#Reputation|reputation]] as one of the world's most prestigious universities.
 
The University grew out of an association of scholars in the city of Cambridge that was formed, [[University of Cambridge#Early history|early records suggest]], in 1209 by scholars leaving [[Oxford]] after a dispute with local townsfolk there.<ref>[http://www.cam.ac.uk/cambuniv/pubs/history/records.html A Brief History: Early records] from the university web site, retrieved [[4 September]] [[2007]].</ref>

The universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and Cambridge are often jointly referred to as ''[[Oxbridge]]''. In addition to cultural and practical associations as a historic part of [[England|English]] society, the two universities also have a long [[Oxbridge rivalry|history of rivalry]] with each other.

'''''Cantabrigian''''' is the formal adjective meaning "of Cambridge University" which is also used as a term for the university's members (abbreviated as '''''Cantab.''''' in [[post-nominal letters]] for alumni).<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?Cantabrigian Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary]</ref>

==Organisation==
[[Image:CambridgeTownCentre.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Left to Right: The [[Senate House (Cambridge University)|Senate House]], [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville & Caius College]] and the University Church ([[Great St Mary's]]) from King<U+2019>s Parade]]

Cambridge is a [[collegiate university]], with its main functions divided between the central departments of the university and 31 [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|colleges]]. In general, the departments perform research and provide centralised lectures to students, while the colleges are responsible for the domestic arrangements and welfare of undergraduate students, graduate students, some of the postdocs and some University staff. The colleges also provide most of the small group teaching for undergraduates, referred to as [[Tutorial|supervisions]]. The 31 colleges are technically institutions independent of the university itself and enjoy considerable autonomy. For example, colleges decide which students they are to admit, and appoint their own [[fellow]]s (senior members). In Cambridge, <U+201C>the university<U+201D> often refers to the University as opposed to the colleges.

===Central administration===
The current [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the university is the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]. The current [[Vice-Chancellor]] is [[Alison Fettes Richard|Professor Alison Richard]]. The office of Chancellor, which is held for life, is mainly ceremonial, while the Vice-Chancellor is ''de facto'' the prinicipal academic and administrative officer. The University's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by its own members, with little external representation on its governing bodies with the exception of the Audit Committee. The governing body of the University is the [[Regent House]] (comprised of resident senior members of the University and the Colleges, together with the Chancellor, the [[High Steward (academia)|High Steward]], the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary). The University Council is the principal executive and policy-making body of the University, and is subject to Regent House. Since January 2005, the membership of the Council has included two external members.<ref>http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/weekly/5984/1.html</ref> The General Board of the Faculties is responsible, subject to the Regent House and to the responsibilities of the Council, for the academic and educational policy of the University.<ref>[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/current/weekly/6071/17.html "Developing governance by building on good practice: a green paper issued by the University Council"], 25 April 2007</ref> The Cambridge Reporter Regent House and  The Senate consists of all holders of the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] degree or higher degrees. It elects the Chancellor and the High Steward; until their abolition in 1950, it elected Members to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University constituency]], but otherwise it has not had a major role since 1926.

===Colleges===
[[Image:Cam colls from johns.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View over [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius]], [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] towards [[King's College, Cambridge|King<U+2019>s College]] Chapel, seen from [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John<U+2019>s College]] chapel. On the left, just in front of Kings College chapel, is the University [[Senate House (Cambridge University)|Senate House]]]] {{main|Colleges of the University of Cambridge}}

The University of Cambridge currently has 31 [[Colleges within UK Universities|colleges]], of which three admit only women ([[New Hall, Cambridge|New Hall]], [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]]). The remaining 28 are mixed, [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene]] being the last all-male college to begin admitting women in 1988. Two colleges admit only [[postgraduate]]s ([[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]] and [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin]]), and four more admit mainly [[mature student]]s or [[graduate student]]s ([[Hughes Hall, Cambridge|Hughes Hall]], [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]], [[St Edmund's College, Cambridge|St Edmund<U+2019>s]] and [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson]]). The other 25 colleges admit mainly [[undergraduate]] students, but also postgraduates following courses of study or research. Although various colleges are traditionally strong in a particular subject, for example [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill]] has a formalised bias towards the [[science]]s and [[engineering]], the colleges all admit students from just about the whole range of subjects, although some colleges do not take students for a handful of subjects such as [[architecture]] or [[history of art]]. It is noteworthy that costs to students (accommodation and food prices) vary considerably from college to college. This may be of increasing significance to potential applicants as Government grants decline in the next few years.

There are several historical colleges which no longer exist, such as [[King's Hall|King<U+2019>s Hall]] (founded in 1317) and [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]] which were combined together by [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] to establish [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] in 1546, and Gonville Hall which was founded in 1348 and then re-founded in 1557 as [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville & Caius]].

There are also several theological colleges in Cambridge, (for example [[Westminster College, Cambridge|Westminster College]] and [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge|Ridley Hall Theological College]]) that are loosely affiliated with the university through the [[Cambridge Theological Federation]].

===Research and teaching===
[[Image:History Faculty University of Cambridge.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sir [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]]'s [[Seeley Historical Library]] (1968)]]
Cambridge University has research departments and teaching faculties in most academic disciplines. Cambridge tends to have a slight bias towards [[science|scientific]] subjects, but it also has a number of strong [[humanities]] and [[social sciences|social science]] faculties. Academic staff (and often graduate students for the larger subjects) teach the undergraduates in both lectures and personal ''supervisions'' in which a ratio of one teacher to between one and three students is usually maintained. This [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] system is often cited as being unique to the Universities of Cambridge and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (where <U+201C>supervisions<U+201D> are known as <U+201C>tutorials<U+201D>) <U+2013> similar practices can be found elsewhere, though not on the [[Oxbridge]] scale.

All research and lectures are conducted by University Departments. The colleges are in charge of giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extra-curricular activities. During the 1990s Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several University sites around the city, and major expansion continues on a number of sites[http://www.cam.ac.uk/building/].

Cambridge is a member of the [[Russell Group]], a network of research-led British universities; the [[Coimbra Group]], an association of leading European universities; the [[League of European Research Universities]]; and the [[International Alliance of Research Universities]]. It is also considered part of the [[Golden Triangle (UK universities)|"Golden Triangle"]], a geographical concentration of UK university research.

===Finances===
In 2006, it was reported that approximately one third of Cambridge<U+2019>s income comes from UK government funding for teaching and research, with another third coming from other research grants. Endowment income contributes around 6%.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0e712684-7d85-11db-9fa2-0000779e2340.html Cambridge turns to City to lead fund] ''[[Financial Times]]'', November 26 2006</ref>

In late 2006, the total financial endowment of the university and the colleges was estimated at <U+00A3>4.1 billion: <U+00A3>1.2 billion tied directly to the university,  <U+00A3>2.9 billion to the colleges<ref>[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/dpp/2006112701] <U+2013> Cambridge University press release. (The total endowment was estimated at <U+00A3>3.1 billion in late 2005 by ''Bloomberg'' <U+2013> see[http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000006&sid=aDJspMg5jl24&refer=home] <U+2013> Report by ''Bloomberg''</ref> <U+2013> this endowment is arguably the largest in Europe.<ref>Oxford (including its colleges) is possibly ranked second, having reported an endowment valued at <U+00A3>3.9bn in mid-2006[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/gwp/whitepaper.pdf] (in 2005, estimates for Oxford ranged from <U+00A3>2.4bn to <U+00A3>2.9bn [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_49/b3962012.htm]). The [[Central European University]] in [[Budapest]] has the third largest endowment, with an estimated <U+20AC>400 million in 2005.</ref> Each college is an independent charitable institution with its own endowment, separate from that of the central university endowment.  

If ranked on a [[United States|US]] university endowment table using figures reported in 2006, Cambridge would rank sixth or seventh (depending on whether one includes the [[University of Texas System]] <U+2013> which incorporates nine full scale universities and six health institutions), or fourth in a ranking compared with only the eight [[Ivy League]] institutions.<ref>[http://www.nacubo.org/documents/research/2006NES_Listing.pdf] &mdash; NACUBO report</ref>

In 2005, the [http://www.foundation.cam.ac.uk/800-home.php Cambridge 800th Anniversary Campaign] was launched, aimed at raising <U+00A3>1 billion by 2012 <U+2013> the first US-style university fundraising campaign in Europe. <U+00A3>300 million of funds had already been secured in the pre-launch period.

International rankings of research universities produced in 2006 by ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement|The Times Higher Education Supplement (THES)]]'' (with [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] - sometimes known as the [[THES - QS]] rankings) ranked Cambridge as the second best University in the world after [[Harvard]]<ref>[http://www.thes.co.uk/statistics/international_comparisons/2006/main.aspx]  &mdash; A 2006 ranking from the ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement)]]'' and [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] of the world<U+2019>s research universities with Cambridge ranked 2nd, behind [[Harvard]].</ref> and [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] in 2007 placed Cambridge fourth after Harvard, [[Stanford]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] <ref>http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2007/ARWU2007_Top100.htm</ref>. The THES - QS rankings also placed Cambridge first in the international academic reputation peer review, first in the [[natural science]]s, first in [[medicine|biomedicine]], first in the [[humanities|arts & humanities]], fourth in the [[social sciences]], and sixth in [[technology]]. A 2006 ''[[Newsweek]]'' ranking which combined elements of the Jiao Tong survey with other factors that purportedly evaluated an institution's global "openness and diversity" suggested that Cambridge was ranked 6th in the world overall.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/site/newsweek/</ref> A 2007 ranking by [[Webometrics]] which ''only'' attempts to evaluate the internet publication activities of universities, placed Cambridge at 19th in the world overall.<ref>http://www.webometrics.info/top3000.asp</ref> In all these surveys, Cambridge was the highest ranked non-US institution. (Note that all university rankings are subject to controversy about their methodology, and that the THES - QS and Jiao Tong tables are the only annual comprehensive international rankings by academic specialists available). 

According to [[UCAS]], Cambridge and Oxford are the most academically selective universities in the United Kingdom &mdash; there is a special national admissions process which sets [[Oxbridge]] apart from other British universities. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Cambridge is often rated extremely highly on British league tables. The 2008 edition of [[The Good University Guide]] rated Cambridge overall first place. Cambridge had been ranked first in [[The Times Good University Guide]]  from 1993 until 2002<ref>http://www.indonesianembassy.org.uk/education_the_times_gug.html</ref><ref>http://www.times-archive.co.uk/news/pages/tim/2000/04/14/timguggug01002.html</ref>, and then second to [[Oxford University]] from 2003 to 2008<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article2267821.ece</ref>. Cambridge has been ranked first in the [[Sunday Times]] league tables every year from 1997 to 2008. Cambridge is generally placed either first or second in other British newspaper university leagues.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/main.jhtml?xml=%2Feducation%2F2003%2F06%2F27%2Ftefuni.xml</ref><ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article671264.ece</ref>
<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/debate/letters/article673015.ece</ref>

In the most recent British Government [[Research Assessment Exercise]] in 2001,<ref>[http://education.guardian.co.uk/RAE/story/0,,618278,00.html] &mdash; Report in ''The Guardian''</ref> Cambridge was ranked first in the country. In 2005, it was reported that Cambridge produces more PhDs per year than any other British university (over 30% more than second placed Oxford).<ref>[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,1575165,00.html] &mdash; Report in ''The Guardian''</ref> In 2006, a [[Thomson Scientific & Healthcare|Thomson Scientific]] study showed that Cambridge has the highest research paper output of any British university, and is also the top research producer (as assessed by total paper citation count) in 10 out of 21 major British research fields analysed ([[Imperial College]] came second, leading in 3 fields).<ref>[http://scientific.thomson.com/press/2006/8319732/] &mdash; Report available online via thomson.com</ref> Another study published the same year by Evidence showed that Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university (coming first in three out of four broad discipline fields).<ref>[http://www.thes.co.uk/search/story.aspx?story_id=2033320] &mdash; Report in the ''Times Higher Education Supplement''</ref>

Historically, the university has produced a significant proportion of Britain<U+2019>s prominent [[scientist]]s, [[writer]]s and [[politician]]s. Officially, affiliates of Cambridge University have won a total of [[Nobel prizes by university affiliation|82 Nobel Prizes]],<ref>[http://www.cam.ac.uk/cambuniv/nobelprize.html] &mdash; The official list of Cambridge<U+2019>s 82 Nobel Prize winners, from the University of Cambridge website.</ref> more than any other university in the world<ref>[http://almaz.com/nobel/alma.html] &mdash; A list of universities with the most Nobel Prize winner affiliations. The [[University of Chicago]] has the second most with 78 (30 of which were won by former students).</ref> and more than any country in the world except the United Kingdom and the [[United States]]. Seventy of these Nobel Laureates also attended Cambridge as undergraduate or graduate students. In addition, there are at least [[List of University of Cambridge members|six Nobel Laureates]] who taught or researched for an extended period at Cambridge who have not been recognised by the official total.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

In addition to a long distinguished tradition in the humanities and the arts, the University of Cambridge is especially known for producing prominent scientists and mathematicians. This distinguished list includes [[Isaac Newton]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[William Harvey]], [[Paul Dirac]], [[J. J. Thomson]], [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Jane Goodall]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Francis Crick]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Stephen Hawking]], and [[Fred Sanger]].

The university is also closely linked with the development of the high-tech business cluster in and around Cambridge, which forms the area known as [[Silicon Fen]] or sometimes the <U+201C>Cambridge Phenomenon<U+201D>. In 2004, it was reported that Silicon Fen was the second largest [[venture capital]] market in the world, after [[Silicon Valley]]. Estimates reported in February 2006 suggest that there were about 250 active [[startup company|startup companies]] directly linked with the university, worth around US$6 billion.<ref>[http://www.entrepreneurs.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/news.htm] &mdash; Cambridge University press release</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
[[Roger of Wendover]] wrote that Cambridge University could trace its origins to a crime committed in 1209. Although not always a reliable source, the detail given in his contemporaneous writings lends them credence. Two Oxford scholars were convicted of the murder or manslaughter of a woman and were hanged by the town authorities with the assent of the King. In protest at the hanging, the [[University of Oxford]] went into voluntary suspension, and scholars migrated to a number of other locations, including the pre-existing school at Cambridge (Cambridge had been recorded as a <U+201C>school<U+201D> rather than University when John Grim held the office of Master there in 1201). These post-graduate researchers from Oxford started Cambridge<U+2019>s life as a University in 1209. Cambridge<U+2019>s status as a University is further confirmed by a decree in 1233 from [[Pope Gregory IX]] which awarded the ''[[ius non trahi extra]]'' (a form of legal protection) to the ''chancellor and universitas of scholars'' at Cambridge. After Cambridge was recognised by papal bull as a ''[[studium generale]]'' by [[Pope Nicholas IV]] in 1290, it became common for researchers from other European [[medieval universities]] to come and visit Cambridge to study or to give lecture courses.<ref>

===Foundation of the Colleges===
[[Image:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] (left) and [[King's College, Cambridge|King<U+2019>s College]] Chapel (centre), seen from [[The Backs]]]]
Cambridge<U+2019>s colleges were originally an incidental feature of the system. No college is as old as the university itself. The colleges were endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels. The hostels were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, but they have left some indicators of their time, such as the name of Garrett Hostel Lane.

[[Hugh Balsham]], [[Bishop]] of [[Ely]], founded [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]] in 1284, Cambridge<U+2019>s first college. Many colleges were founded during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but colleges continued to be established throughout the centuries to modern times, although there was a gap of 204 years between the founding of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex]] in 1596 and [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing]] in 1800. The most recent college established is [[Robinson College, Cambridge|Robinson]], built in the late 1970s.

In [[medieval]] times, colleges were founded so that their students would [[pray]] for the [[soul]]s of the founders. For that reason they were often associated with [[chapel]]s or [[abbey]]s. A change in the colleges<U+2019> focus occurred in 1536 with the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]]. King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ordered the university to disband its Faculty of Canon Law and to stop teaching <U+201C>[[scholastic philosophy]]<U+201D>. In response, colleges changed their curricula away from canon law and towards the [[classics]], the [[Bible]], and [[mathematics]].

===Mathematics===
From the time of [[Isaac Newton]] in the later 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained a strong emphasis on mathematics. Study of this subject was compulsory for graduation, and students were required to take an exam for the [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, the main first degree at Cambridge in both arts and science subjects. This exam is known as a [[Tripos]].
Students awarded [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] after completing the mathematics Tripos were named [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wranglers]]. The [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] was competitive and helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]]. However, some famous students, such as [[G. H. Hardy]], disliked the system, feeling that people were too interested in accumulating marks in exams and not interested in the subject itself.

Although diversified in its research and teaching interests, Cambridge today maintains its strength in mathematics. The [[Isaac Newton Institute]], part of the university, is widely regarded as the UK<U+2019>s national research institute for mathematics and theoretical physics. Cambridge alumni have won eight [[Fields Medal]]s and one [[Abel Prize]] for mathematics. The University also runs a special [[CASM|Certificate of Advanced Studies in Mathematics]] course.

===Women<U+2019>s education===
Originally all students were male. The first colleges for women were [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]] (founded by [[Emily Davies]]) in 1869 and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] in 1872. The first women students were examined in 1882 but attempts to make women full members of the university did not succeed until 1947. Although Cambridge did not give degrees to women until this date women were in fact allowed to study courses, sit examinations, and have their results recorded from the nineteenth century onwards. In the twentieth century women could be given a <U+201C>titular degree<U+201D>; although they were not denied recognised qualifications, without a full degree they were excluded from the governing of the university. Since students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to colleges established only for women. All of the men<U+2019>s colleges began to admit women between 1960 and 1988. One women<U+2019>s college, Girton, also began to admit men, but the other women<U+2019>s colleges did not follow suit.
In the academic year 2004-5, the university<U+2019>s student gender ratio, including post-graduates, was male 52%: female 48% (Source: Cambridge University Reporter, [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/special/19/]).

==Admissions==
===History===
{{Expand-section|date=January 2007}}

The proportion drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, and now form a significant minority of the intake. In 2005, UK applicants from private/independent schools accounted for about 40% of the total number of undergraduate acceptances[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2005-06/special/11/table1-1.pdf], which is about the same proportion of private/independent applications.

===Today===
[[Image:CMS.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Centre for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge)|Centre for Mathematical Sciences]] in West Cambridge, home to a number of new faculty buildings.]]

The application system to Cambridge and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] often involves additional requirements. Candidates are also typically called to face-to-face interviews.

How applicants perform in the interview process best determines which candidates are accepted.<ref name="intguide">[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/interviews/guide/why.html] &mdash; University of Cambridge guide to Interviews</ref> Most applicants are expected to be predicted at least three A-grade [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] qualifications relevant to their chosen undergraduate course, or equivalent overseas qualifications. Due to a very high proportion receiving the highest school grades from the private and grammar schools, this makes the interview process crucial at distinguishing the most able candidates and important in trying to recruit from comprehensive schools.<ref name="intguide" /> In 2005, 5,325 students were rejected who went on to get 3 A levels or more at grade A, representing about 60% of all applicants rejected.<ref>[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2005-06/special/11/table3-1.pdf] &mdash; Cambridge University Reporter</ref> The interview is performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors such as potential for original thinking and creativity.<ref>[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/interviews/film/index.html] &mdash; Cambridge University information on interviews</ref>  For exceptional candidates, a ''Matriculation Offer'' is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above - [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] is unusual in making this offer to about one-third of successful candidates.<ref>[http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:cam.ac.uk+%22matriculation+offer%22]</ref>

In recent years, admissions tutors in certain subjects have required applicants to sit the more difficult [[Sixth Term Examination Paper|STEP papers]], tuition for which is not normally provided by British schools outside the private or independent sector, in addition to achieving top grades in their A-levels or [[International Baccalaureate]] diplomas. For example, Peterhouse requires 1 and 2 or better in STEP as well as A grades at A-levels including A-level Mathematics and Further Mathematics in order to be considered for entry for the Mathematical Tripos. Between one-half and two-thirds of those who apply with the required grades are given offers of a place.

Public debate in the United Kingdom continues over whether admissions processes at Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit based and fair; whether enough students from [[state schools]] are encouraged to apply to Cambridge; and whether these students succeed in gaining entry. Almost half of all successful applicants come from independent schools. However, the average qualifications for successful applicants from state schools are slightly lower than the average qualification of successful applicants from private schools {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Critics have argued that the lack of state school applicants with the required grades applying to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxbridge<U+2019>s reputation for many years, and the University has encouraged pupils from state schools to apply for Cambridge to help redress the imbalance.

Graduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department relating to the applicant<U+2019>s subject. This effectively guarantees admission to a college - though not necessarily the applicant<U+2019>s preferred choice.<ref>(see the [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/next.html Board of Graduate Studies admissions flowchart]).</ref>

==Sport and other extracurricular activities==
Cambridge maintains a long tradition of student participation in sport and recreation. [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] is a particularly popular sport at Cambridge, and there are competitions between colleges (notably the [[bumps race]]s) and against Oxford (the [[Boat Race]]). There are also [[Varsity match]]es against Oxford in many other sports, ranging from [[rugby union|rugby]] (see [[Cambridge University RUFC]]) and [[cricket]], to [[chess]] and [[tiddlywinks]]. Athletes representing the university in certain sports entitle them to apply for a [[Cambridge Blue]] at the discretion of the ''Blues Committee,'' consisting of the captains of the thirteen most prestigious sports. There is also the self-described <U+201C>unashamedly elite<U+201D> [[Hawks' Club|Hawks<U+2019> Club]] (men only), whose membership is usually restricted to Cambridge Full Blues and Half Blues.

The [[Cambridge Union]] serves as a focus for debating. Drama societies notably include the [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club|Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC)]] and the comedy club [[Footlights]], which are known for producing well-known showbusiness personalities. Student newspapers include the long-established ''[[Varsity (newspaper)|Varsity]]'' and its younger rival, ''[[The Cambridge Student]].'' The student-run radio station, [[CUR1350]], promotes broadcast journalism.

==Myths, legends and traditions==
[[Image:Mathematicians bridge cambridge large.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Mathematical Bridge]] over the river Cam (at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens<U+2019> College]])]]
{{main|University of Cambridge legends}}

There are many popular myths associated with the University of Cambridge:

One famous myth relates to [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens<U+2019> College]]<U+2019>s so-called [[Mathematical Bridge]] (pictured right). Supposedly constructed by Sir Isaac Newton, it reportedly held itself together without any bolts or screws. Legend has it inquisitive students took it apart and were then unable to reassemble it without bolts. However, the bridge was erected 22 years after Newton<U+2019>s death. This myth may have arisen from the fact that earlier versions of the bridge used iron pins and screws at the joints, whereas the current bridge uses more visible nuts and bolts.

Another famous myth involves Clare Bridge, [[List of bridges in Cambridge|currently the oldest bridge]], which is attached to [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]]. Spherical stone ornaments adorn this bridge. One of these has a quarter sphere wedge removed from the back. This is a feature pointed out on almost all tours over the bridge. Various myths are associated with this sphere. See [[University of Cambridge legends#Clare College bridge|Cambridge legends]].

A discontinued tradition is that of the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]], the <U+2018>prize<U+2019> awarded to the student with the lowest passing grade in the final examinations of the Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John<U+2019>s College]]. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's. Since 1909, results were published alphabetically within class rather than score order. This made it harder to ascertain who the winner of the spoon was (unless there was only one person in the third class), and so the practice was abandoned.

On the other hand, the legend of the [[Austin 7]] delivery van that ended up on the apex of the Senate House is no myth at all. The [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]] website recounts in detail how this vehicle <U+201C>went up in the world<U+201D>. [http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/college/past/legend/index.php]

Each [[Christmas Eve]], [[BBC]] radio and television broadcasts [[Nine Lessons and Carols|The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols]] by the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge]]. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas tradition since it was first transmitted in 1928 (though the festival has existed since 1918). The radio broadcast is carried worldwide by the [[BBC World Service]] and is also syndicated to hundreds of radio stations in the USA. The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1703517.stm</ref><ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/advent/carolsfromkings.shtml</ref><ref>http://www.amazon.com/Carols-College-Cambridge-Stephen-Cleobury/dp/B00005S6KQ</ref>

Building on its reputation for enterprise, science and technology, Cambridge has a partnership with [[MIT]] in the [[United States]], the [[Cambridge-MIT Institute]].

In 2000, [[Bill Gates]] of [[Microsoft]] donated US$210 million through the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] to endow the [[Gates Scholarships]] for students from outside the UK seeking postgraduate study at Cambridge. The [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]], which taught the world<U+2019>s first computing course in 1953, is housed in a building partly funded by Gates and named after his grandfather, William Gates.

After the founding of [[Harvard College]] in 1636 at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Newtowne]], [[Massachusetts]], the town adopted the new name of <U+201C>Cambridge<U+201D> in 1638 to promote its reputation as an academic centre. The first president ([[Henry Dunster]]), the first benefactor ([[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]]), and the first schoolmaster ([[Nathaniel Eaton]]) of Harvard were all Cambridge University alumni, as was the then ruling (and first) governor of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], [[John Winthrop]]. In 1629, Winthrop had led the signing of the founding document of the city of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which was known as the [[Cambridge Agreement]], after the university [http://www.winthropsociety.org/doc_cambr.php].

The concept of [[Grade (education)|grading]] students' work quantitatively was developed by a tutor named [[William Farish]] at the University of Cambridge in 1792.<ref>{{cite book|last=Postman|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Postman|title=Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology|year=1992|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|location=[[New York City]]|language=[[English language|English]]|id=ISBN 9780679745402}}</ref>

In [[Japan]], there is a Cambridge and Oxford Society,[http://www.camford.org/] a rare example of the name Cambridge coming before Oxford when the two universities are referred to together <U+2014> traditionally, the order used when referring to both universities is <U+201C>Oxford and Cambridge<U+201D>, the order in which they were founded. The probable reason for this inversion is that the Cambridge Club was founded first in Japan, and it also had more members than its Oxford counterpart when they amalgamated in 1905.

The University<U+2019>s publishing arm, the [[Cambridge University Press]], is the oldest printer and publisher in the world.

The University set up its Local Examination Syndicate almost 150 years ago, in 1858.  Today, the Syndicate, which is known as [[Cambridge Assessment]], is Europe<U+2019>s largest assessment agency and it plays a leading role in researching, developing and delivering assessments across the globe.
