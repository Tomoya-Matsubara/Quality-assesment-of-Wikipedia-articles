===Summary===
Bayern kicked off, but Liverpool had the first chance of the match. [[Michael Owen]] crossed the ball into the [[penalty area]] from the right side of the pitch towards [[Emile Heskey]], whose shot was deflected out for a corner.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2001/aug/25/newsstory.sport7?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Reds grab fifth pot in five-goal thriller |work=The Guardian |date=25 August 2001 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |first=Dominic |last=Fifield }}</ref> Bayern responded immediately, although [[Owen Hargreaves]]' shot went high over the Liverpool goal.<ref name="minute">{{cite web|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/supercup/history/season=2001/round=1560/match=68022/report=mbm.html |title=Minute-by-minute |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) |accessdate=24 June 2011 }}</ref> Nine minutes after the start of the match Liverpool were awarded a [[Direct free kick|free-kick]] after a foul by [[Robert Kova<U+010D>]] on Owen. The free-kick taken by [[Gary McAllister]] was met by [[Markus Babbel]], but he headed over the goal.<ref name="minute" /> With more fouls starting to occur, the first booking was awarded in the 14th minute. Liverpool midfielder [[Dietmar Hamann]] was shown a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] after he tackled [[Hasan Salihamid<U+017E>i<U+0107>]] from behind.<ref name="minute" /> Bayern started to control the match midway through the first-half, however it was Liverpool who scored the first goal of the match. Liverpool defender [[John Arne Riise]] dispossessed Hargreaves, McAllister took control of the loose ball and passed to [[Steven Gerrard]]. Gerrard's pass to Owen meant he was in space down the right side of the pitch, Owen put a low-cross into the penalty area, which by-passed Heksey but found Riise who scored to give Liverpool the lead.<ref name="guardian" />

Bayern were immediately on the attack following Liverpool's goal. A foul on Bayern defender [[Bixente Lizarazu]] by Gerrard resulted in a free-kick for Bayern. The subsequent free-kick taken by [[Ciriaco Sforza]] was headed over the Liverpool goal by [[Pablo Thiam]].<ref name="minute" /> Liverpool regrouped and their next attack almost resulted in another goal. Heskey's pass to Owen put him clear of the Bayern defence and one-on-one with [[Oliver Khan]]. Owen attempted to chip the ball over Khan, however the Bayern goalkeeper was able to save the shot.<ref name="minute" /> Immediately afterwards Bayern were on the attack. Bayern defender [[Willy Sagnol]] held off Riise and the crossed the ball into the penalty area, the cross was met by [[Giovane Elber]] whose header went wide of the Liverpool goal.<ref name="minute" /> With the first half coming to an end, Liverpool had another attack. Hamann passed the ball to Heskey on the edge of the Bayern penalty area, Heskey subsequently moved past Bayern defender's [[Thomas Linke]] and Kova<U+010D>, and shot low beyond Khan to give Liverpool a 2<U+2013>0 lead.<ref name="guardian" />

Liverpool kicked-off the second half, and within 13 seconds they had scored to lead the match 3<U+2013>0. Liverpool defender [[Jamie Carragher]] kicked the ball into the Bayern half, defender Thiam missed his header, which meant the ball dropped to Owen, who controlled the ball with his right foot and then put the ball into the Bayern goal with his left foot.<ref name="guardian" /> Bayern reduced the deficit in the 57th minute when Salihamid<U+017E>i<U+0107> scored. He headed the ball into the Liverpool goal from Bayern's first corner of the match to reduce the deficit to two goals.<ref name="minute" /> Midway through the half both teams made substitutions. Bayern replaced Sforza, [[Claudio Pizarro]] and Salihamid<U+017E>i<U+0107> for [[Niko Kova<U+010D>]], [[Carsten Jancker]] and [[Roque Santa Cruz]] respectively. Liverpool substituted Gerrard and Riise for [[Igor Bi<U+0161><U+0107>an]] and [[Danny Murphy (footballer born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] respectively.<ref name="minute" /> Liverpool started to pass the ball around their midfield and defence in an attempt to waste time, however in the 82nd minute Bayern scored again. Substitute Jancker headed into the Liverpool goal from a cross by Elber.<ref name="guardian" /> Immediately afterwards Bayern had an opportunity to equalise, however Lizarazu's shot was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper [[Sander Westerveld]]. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3<U+2013>2 to Liverpool.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/owen-wraps-up-fifth-trophy-for-liverpool-666925.html |title=Owen wraps up fifth trophy for Liverpool |work=The Indepedent |date=25 August 2001 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |first=Nick |last=Townsend }}</ref>

==Post-match==
Liverpool's victory meant that they had won five competitions in five months, after winning the [[FA Cup]], [[Football League Cup]] and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] during the [[2000<U+2013>01 Liverpool F.C. season|2000<U+2013>01 season]]. They had also won the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] at the start of the current season. Manager [[G<U+00E9>rard Houllier]] congratulated his players on their achievements: "I must congratulate the players for what they achieved in these six months. We know we are not perfect and we will continue to improve. But the team have shown they possess the winning edge, and this is what we have tried to develop." As man of the match Owen received a <U+00A3>10,000 cheque from match sponsors [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] to be forwarded to a charity of his choice.<ref name="review">{{cite web|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/supercup/history/season=2001/round=1560/match=68022/report=rw.html |title=Reds extend winning cup sequence |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) |date=25 August 2001 |accessdate=25 June 2011 }}</ref>

Bayern's loss in the Super Cup extended German clubs winless streak in the competition; Bayern's loss was the seventh by a German club. Manager [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]] admitted that his team needed time to co-ordinate their defence: "It took us time to get into top gear and to organise ourselves. And when you are too slow playing a team like Liverpool, then you expect to get punished."<ref name="review" /> Hitzfled was critical of his players stating that "individual mistakes cost us the match." He also praised man of the match [[Michael Owen]] stating that Bayern "could not counter his threat."<ref name="review" />
