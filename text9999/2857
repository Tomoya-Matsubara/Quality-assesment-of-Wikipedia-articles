'''Pedro Almod<U+00F3>var Caballero''' born [[September 24]], [[1949]]) is a two-time [[Academy Award]]-winning Spanish [[filmmaker]]. Since making  his first commercial film in the [[1980]]s, he has [[screenwriting|written]], [[Film director|directed]], [[actor|acted]] in and/or [[film producer|produced]] nearly 30 films. His films are characterized  by elements of [[melodrama]] and [[Camp (style)|high camp]].

== Early biography ==
Pedro Almod<U+00F3>var was born to a working class family in [[Calzada de Calatrava]] of [[Ciudad Real (province)|Ciudad Real]], a province of [[Castile-La Mancha]] in the administrative district of [[Almagro]]. His family moved to [[C<U+00E1>ceres (province)|C<U+00E1>ceres]] in [[Extremadura]] when he was eight years of age and he attended a Catholic boarding school run by [[Salesian]] friars. His experiences in  religious institutions, and the sexual abuse he witnessed,  would serve as the inspiration for his film  ''[[Bad Education]]'' (2004) (Spanish: ''La mala educaci<U+00F3>n'').

At the age of sixteen, Almod<U+00F3>var moved to [[Madrid]]. The cultural and economic stagnation of the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era discouraged the formation of a lively cinematic culture.  Almod<U+00F3>var worked a number of odd jobs, including a stint selling used items in the famous Madrid flea-market [[El Rastro]]. Almod<U+00F3>var's experiences among the underprivleged of Madrid would consistently resurface in his films.  Eventually, Almod<U+00F3>var found full-time employment with Spain's national phone company, where he worked for twelve years as an administrative assistant. Steady employment enabled him to purchase his first camera, a Super 8.

In the early seventies, Almod<U+00F3>var grew interested in experimental cinema and theatre. He collaborated with the vanguard theatrical group, The Romantics (Spanish: ''Los Goliardos''). Around 1972, Almod<U+00F3>var began making his first short films on his Super 8, and by the end of the seventies, he was also writing comics and contributing articles and stories to a number of countercultural magazines, such as ''Star'' and ''Vipers and Vibrations'' (Spanish: ''V<U+00ED>bora y Vibraciones''). 

Almod<U+00F3>var was a crucial figure in the [[La Movida Madrile<U+00F1>a|Madrilene Movement]] (Spanish: La Movida Madrile<U+00F1>a), a cultural renaissance that followed the fall of the [[Francisco Franco]] dictatorship. In addition to his cinematic work, Almod<U+00F3>var sang alongside [[Fabio McNamara]] in a punk-glam-rock parody duo,  published a novella, ''Fire in the Guts'' (Spanish: ''Fuego en las entra<U+00F1>as''), and, writing under the pseudonym "Patty Difusa" penned various articles for major newspapers and magazines, such as ''El Pa<U+00ED>s'', ''[[Diario 16]]'' and ''La Luna''.

Almod<U+00F3>var made his first feature film, ''Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Woman on the Heap'' (Spanish: ''Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del mont<U+00F3>n''), in 1980 for merely <U+00A3>13,000. The film was based on his photo-novella, ''General Erections'' (Spanish: ''Erecciones Generales''), previously published in the magazine, ''The Viper'' (Spanish: ''El V<U+00ED>bora''). The film's success provided Almod<U+00F3>var with the financial and cultural capital to found his own production company, ''Desire'' (Spanish: ''[[El Deseo]]'') in 1985 with his brother, Agustin. The first film produced by Desire was  ''The Law of Desire'' (Spanish: ''La Ley del Deseo''), released in 1986. In addition to Almod<U+00F3>var's own films, ''Desire'' has managed production for a variety of important directors, including <U+00C1>lex de la Iglesia, [[Guillermo del Toro]], Daniel Calparsoro, M<U+00F3>nica Laguna, and Isabel Coixet.

==Almod<U+00F3>var's cinematic work==
Almod<U+00F3>var's films, similar in aesthetic style and technique to those of the Spanish director [[Eloy de la Iglesia]], cultivate a [[naturalism]] that deconstructs the depiction of middle-class values, typical of Spanish cinema. His films tend to deal with the marginal existence of the urban underclass and are full of scandalous and provocative elements, such as corrupt cops, drug consumption, prostitution, maltreatment, precocious kids, homosexuality, desperate housewives and philosophical country hicks. All this is combined with strong irreverent humour that often include explicit scenes of a sexual nature, as the [[Urolagnia |golden shower]] scene of his first 35mm film, ''Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Woman on the Heap," attests. 

Just like the surrealists, the occasional scandalous scene of bad taste is usually incorporated into Almod<U+00F3>var's movies in order to perturb the morally haughty bourgeoisie and stilted intellectuals that feel they are above such unbecoming behaviour. Nonetheless, with the passage of time, Almod<U+00F3>var has developed a more sophisticated and colourful sense of drama, closer to the classic melodramatic style of [[Douglas Sirk]], and continues to improve his scriptwriting to the point where he has become a master of rhythm and structure. This progress was clearly evident in his breakout film of 1984, ''What Have I Done to Deserve This?'' (Spanish: ''<U+00BF>Qu<U+00E9> he hecho yo para merecer esto?''), which again featured one of his favoured actresses in [[Carmen Maura]].

Later in ''Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down'' (Spanish: ''<U+00A1><U+00C1>tame!''), titled originally Cine X in the USA, a woman ends up falling in love with her kidnapper, and in ''Kika'', a rape is trivialised. Almod<U+00F3>var's sources of inspiration, nearly always autobiographical, also include [[Luis Bu<U+00F1>uel]], avante-garde art, folkloric culture and anti-clericalism.

1997s ''Live Flesh'' (Carne Tremula) showcased an altogether new calibre of filmmaking which has placed Almod<U+00F3>var among the elite of world cinema.  ''All about my Mother'' (Todo Sobre mi Madre), ''Talk to Her'' (Hable con ella), and ''Bad Education'' (Mala Educaci<U+00F3>n) all garnered high critical acclaim, including an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film for ''All About My Mother''.

==Theatrical re-release==
In 2006, Sony Pictures Classics announced the theatrical re-release of eight of celebrated [[auteur]] Pedro Almod<U+00F3>var<U+2019>s greatest films.

'''Viva Pedro''' will open in New York and Los Angeles in August and expand throughout the United States this [[Autumn]].  The theatrical re-release will introduce new audiences to Almod<U+00F3>var and at the same time present the films to his many fans in the manner which they are meant to be seen and appreciated.

The re-released films include ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]'', ''[[All About My Mother]]'', ''[[Talk to Her]]'', ''[[La flor de mi secreto|The Flower of My Secret]]'', ''[[Carne tr<U+00E9>mula|Live Flesh]]'', ''[[La_ley_del_deseo | Law of Desire]]'', ''[[Matador (film)|Matador]]'' and ''[[Bad Education]]''.

Brand new prints have been made of all eight films.  Several of these titles have not been shown in theaters since their original release.  All of the films have been withdrawn from the DVD marketplace to accommodate their theatrical re-release (''Matador'' and ''Law of Desire'' have only been released as part of boxed sets).

An exclusive DVD set titled "Pedro Almod<U+00F3>var Classics Collection" is set to be released on [[January 30]], [[2007]] to end '''Viva Pedro''' and also to accompany the expansion of '''Volver'''.

This banner year for Almod<U+00F3>var will conclude with the nationwide release of his newest film ''Volver'', opening in New York and Los Angeles on [[November 3]] and playing throughout America during the year end holiday season.

==Quotes==
"Yes, I am a gay man, but I love breasts."<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061121/REVIEWS/611210302/1023 cited by [[Roger Ebert]]]</ref>

"All my movies have an autobiographical dimension, but that is indirectly, through the personages. In fact I am behind everything that happens and that is said, but I am never talking about myself in first person singular. Something in me -probably a dislike of cheap exhibitionism- stops me from approaching a project too autobiographically."

"Already when I was very young, I was a fabulador. I loved to give my own version of stories that everybody already knew. When I got out of a movie with my sisters, I retold them the whole story. In general they liked my version better than the one they had seen."

"Cinema has become my life. I don't mean a parallel world, I mean my life itself. I sometimes have the impression that the daily reality is simply there to provide material for my next film."

"The education we received was about guilt, sin, punishment." [on his experience in a Catholic boarding school. He based his film, 'Bad Education' on his time there.]

" 'Bad Education' deals with my own biography... it took time to remove myself from it. Now it's not me. I changed the tone of the story, but the main situation is the same." [on why it took 10 years to finish the script]

"I do remember having extreme physical fear of the priests. One of the things we had to do was kiss the priest's hand, which I found revolting. The notorious abuser, who eventually had to leave, had this harem of about 20 boys."

"I don't get involved with my actors. I don't get so involved with the films... If I lived like my characters, I would have been dead before I made 16 films."

"Cinema can fill in the empty spaces of your life and your loneliness."

"The characters in my films are assassins, rapists and so on, but I don't treat them as criminals, I talk about their humanity."

"My first ambition was to be a writer. I have always been very interested in writing. But it seems to me that I have more capacity for telling a story with images. It seems I have more talent for film-making than for writing a novel, which is my dream. I have always found it easy to let my imagination go. You do not just need imagination for film-making, you also need a lot of passion. When I discovered film-making as a way of telling stories, I felt that I had found something that was in my nature. I am glad that I had this ambition to be a novelist because it has helped me in film-making."<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000264/bio]</ref>
