'''"Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other"''' (1981) is "the famous gay cowboy [[song]]" <ref>*Tyranny, "Blue" Gene. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:t69hs32ua3rg Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly/ in 'Life is a Killer']" [[All Music Guide]]. [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fyem97ukkrgt ''Life is a Killer''.]</ref> by [[Latin music|Latin]] [[country music]]ian [[Ned Sublette]] whose music features a "[[Swung note|lilting]] West Texas [[waltz]] feel" <ref name="Miami Herald">*Cohen, Howard (Sun, Mar. 05, 2006)."[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/14010148.htm "Fond memories ride in on the 'Brokeback' craze"] [[Miami Herald]].</ref> and whose [[lyrics]] satirize the [[stereotype]]s associated with [[cowboy]]s and [[gay]] men. For example: "What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?" (a reference to [[western wear]] and [[leather subculture]]) 

Country musician [[Willie Nelson]]'s [[Cover version|cover]] (iTunes single February 14, 2006) is the first gay-themed [[mainstream country]] song by a major artist <ref name="Tarradell">Tarradell, Mario (12:00 a.m. CST on Tuesday, February 14, 2006). "[http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/ent/columnists/mtarradell/stories/DN-cowboysong_0214gl.ART.State.Edition2.e368707.html Willie opens closet with 'Cowboys']" The Dallas Morning News.</ref>. The song has also been recorded and released by Sublette (GPS 027: ''Life is a Killer'' 1982), [[Canada|Canadian]] [[alternative country]] band [[Lost Dakotas]] (''Sun Machine'', 1992), [[queercore]] band [[Pansy Division]] (Lookout 110: ''Pile Up'' 1995), and [[folk music|folk]] duo Rick & Andy (''Going Places'' 2005).

==Composition==

Sublette says the song is based on his experiences growing up in [[Portales, N.M.]] <ref name="365gay">*365Gay.com Newscenter Staff (February 14, 2006 - 7:00 p.m. ET). "[http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/02/021406nelson.htm Willie Nelson's Gay Cowboy]" [[365gay.com]].</ref>: "I sat down at the piano and... remembered what it felt like to feel different as a teenager, and the culture at that time, and I started to put those two things together and the song wrote itself" <ref name="Miami Herald" />. The song was written during the ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' fad <ref>The Associated Press (Wednesday, February 15, 2006). "[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/15/people.nelson.gaycowboys.ap/?section=cnn_latest Willie Nelson's new topic: Gay cowboys]" [[CNN]].com.
</ref> while living with his wife in Manhattan next to a gay country bar on [[Christopher Street (Manhattan)|Christopher Street]] called Boots and Saddles. He explains "Gay life in 1981 was very vibrant in those days. It was part of the culture of the city and cowboy imagery is a part of gay iconography." He wrote the song with Nelson's voice in mind: "I was at the beginning of my songwriting career... and used to like writing songs for my favorite voices. I've been a Willie fan since the '60s." <ref name="Miami Herald" />

As stated above, Sublette is acquainted with gay culture and the song is gay-friendly despite what Ann Northrop of [[Gay USA]] describes as "the language of thirty years ago" such as "Well small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes" and "Well I believe in my soul that inside every man there's a feminine, / And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear" which display now marginal views about gender and sexuality (see [[Havelock Ellis]]' ''Sexual Inversion''). However, positive lyrics such as "A cowboy may brag about things that he does with his women, / But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer" include criticisms of [[the closet]] and small town bigotry.

==Nelson's version==
Nelson received a tape of the song from [[Saturday Night Live Band]] bassist [[Tony Garnier (musician)|Tony Garnier]] after performing on the show <ref name="Time">*Neu, Clayton (Wednesday, Mar. 01, 2006). [http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1168901,00.html "Brokeback Balladeer: Willie Nelson talks to TIME about his gay cowboy song"] [[TIME]].</ref> in the mid to late 1980s and according to the latter "Willie took if from there" <ref name="365gay" /> though Nelson recently found that demo in a drawer among a stack of his own while recording unreleased songs for iTunes <ref name="Tarradell" />. Nelson says "I thought it was the funniest goddamn song I'd ever heard. I had it on the bus for 20 years, and people would come in and I'd play it. When Brokeback come out, it just seemed like a good time to kick it out of the closet" <ref name="Time" />.

Filming for the video featuring [[Broken Lizard|Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe]] <ref name="PRN"> NASHVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 14. [http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/02-14-2006/0004281913&EDATE= "Howard Stern Debuts Willie Nelson's Gay Cowboy Homage 'Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly (Fond Of Each Other)' on Valentine's Day"], PRNewswire. </ref>, expected this Spring, occurred at Dallas' gay cowboy bar, the Round Up Saloon (in the predominately gay Oak Lawn neighborhood of Dallas), in February. Nelson's publicist describes the release of the song, which debuted on [[Howard Stern]]'s satellite radio show: "Since everyone is talking about the acclaimed film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' and its Academy Award nominations, [[Valentine's Day]] seemed like the right time to let [the song] be heard." Nelson appeared on the movie's soundtrack with the traditional "He Was A Friend Of Mine" also covered by [[The Byrds]]. <ref name="365gay" />

Nelson himself described the release in a prepared statement: "The song's been in [[the closet]] for 20 years. The timing's right for it to come out. I'm just opening the door." The song's coming out was encouraged by the [[coming out]] of his friend and tour manager of thirty years, David Anderson, two years ago. Says Anderson: "This song obviously has special meaning to me in more ways than one. I want people to know more than anything <U+2014> gay, straight, whatever <U+2014> just how cool Willie is and ... his way of thinking, his tolerance, everything about him." <ref name="Tarradell" />

==Reception==
Nelson's version of the song is his highest charting single since 1984's duet with [[Julio Iglesias]] "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" (No. 5) <ref name="Miami Herald" /> and has been well received by critics, such as [[Pitchfork Media]]'s Stephen M. Deusner who rated the song four out of four stars despite calling it "even more of a stunt than his reggae album" (2005's ''[[Countryman]]''). He also says that the song sounds as if it was written by Nelson and that his performance raises the piece above the level of a cheap gag while adding "a whole new level of complexity to the outlaw mythology Willie helped to cultivate in the 70s." <ref name="Pitchfork Media">*Deusner, Stephen M. (Mon: 02-27-06). "[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/tracks/06-02-27.shtml Track Reviews: Willie Nelson: 'Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly (Fond of Each Other)']" [[Pitchfork Media]].</ref>.

Nelson also says that he has received very little negative reactions: "Every now and then somebody might get a little offended. It's got bad language in it, so I just don't do it in my shows. Anybody wants to hear it can hear it on iTunes. But you know people are listenin' to it, likin' it. Every now and then somebody don't like it, but that's okay. Similar to years ago, when the hippie thing come out and I started growin' my hair and puttin' the earring in, I got a little flak here and there" <ref name="Time" />. 

However, most sources <ref name="365gay" /> <ref name="Tarradell" />  speculate about the potential success and reception of the song. Nelson explains that he didn't think "it took a lot of balls to put the song out" saying "first of all, I didn't think anybody would play it. I didn't think it would get on the air, but sure enough it did" though not on country stations: "Oh no, they're not gonna play it" <ref name="Time" />.

Sublette, as expected, approves of Nelson's cover, described variously as [[deadpan]] <ref name="Tarradell" /> <ref name="MSNBC"> 3:00 p.m. ET Feb. 17, 2006. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11356491/from/RSS/ "Willie Nelson releases homage to gay cowboys"], MSNBC/Associated Press. </ref>, straight-faced <ref name="Miami Herald" />, and pointedly poignant <ref name="Miami Herald" />, and its exposure saying that "It's supposed to be funny, that's what gets people's attention, but to get people to listen to it a second time [you] have to have something going on, and Willie beautifully brought out the tenderness there...[It's] nice to have a funny song out there -- it is challenging people to laugh. Everybody is so angry now." Sublette speculated about the song's reception: "Willie's smart. We talked about recording it in the '90s but we needed some kind of context. It wouldn't make sense to just put this on some normal Willie album...The movie provided the context. I don't know if the public is any more or less ready than they were but I think the media is more ready." <ref name="Miami Herald" />

The song was featured in a [[Boondocks]] comic strip on February 27th and 28th ([http://www.digisoul.com/boondocks/boondocks.asp?strip=02/27/2006]) and mentioned till the 2nd of March. According to Sublette "the Monday and Tuesday strip consisted of my lyrics and dramatizing listeners' response to my lyrics. What a compliment!" <ref name="Miami Herald" />

===Similar songs===
The song may be compared with the reception of [[Garth Brooks]]' pro-peace 1992 [[Single (music)|single]] "We Shall be Free". The song's single pro-gay line "when we're free to love anyone we choose" caused some radio stations to refuse to play the song, contributing to its peak at No. 12 on Billboard's country singles chart and marking the end of Brooks' string of top ten hits. <ref name="Tarradell" />

[[Dolly Parton]] recorded "[[Travelin' Thru]]" for a transgender themed film ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]'' (2005), and the song was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Original Song]] and was considered the front-runner in the 2005 Oscar song category. "Travelin' Thru" did win as Best Original Song award at the [[Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards]] 2005.  The song was also nominated, though it did not win, for both Best Original Song by the Foreign Press' for the [[Golden Globes]] as well as Best Song by the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]]. However, the difference in subject and visibility between the films lessens the usefulness of this comparison.
