The '''leatherback sea turtle''' (''Dermochelys coriacea''), sometimes called the '''lute turtle''', is the largest of all living [[turtle]]s (as well as the largest extant [[sea turtle]]) and is the fourth largest modern [[reptile]] behind three [[crocodilia]]ns.<ref name="WWW">{{cite web | title =WWF - Leatherback turtle | work=Marine Turtles | publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) | date =16 February 2007 | url =http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/species/about_species/species_factsheets/marine_turtles/leatherback_turtle/index.cfm
  | accessdate =9 September 2007}}</ref><ref name="TurtlesOrg"/> It is the only living [[species]] in the genus '''''Dermochelys'''''. It can easily be differentiated from other modern sea turtles by its lack of a [[exoskeleton|bony shell]]. Instead, its [[carapace]] is covered by skin and oily flesh. ''Dermochelys coriacea'' is the [[Monotypic taxon|only]] [[Extant taxon|extant]] member of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Dermochelyidae]].

==Anatomy and physiology==
Leatherback turtles have the most hydrodynamic body design of any [[sea turtle]], with a large, [[Fluid Dynamics|teardrop-shaped]] body. A large pair of front flippers power the turtles through the water. Like other sea turtles, the leatherback has flattened forelimbs adapted for swimming in the open ocean. Claws are absent from both pairs of flippers. The leatherback's flippers are the largest in proportion to its body among [[Extant taxon|extant]] sea turtles. Leatherback's front flippers can grow up to {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} in large specimens, the largest flippers (even in comparison to its body) of any sea turtle.

The leatherback has several characteristics that distinguish it from other sea turtles. Its most notable feature is the lack of a bony [[carapace]]. Instead of [[scute]]s, it has thick, leathery skin with embedded minuscule [[osteoderm]]s. Seven distinct ridges rise from the carapace, crossing from the anterior to posterior margin of the turtle's back. Leatherbacks are unique among [[reptile]]s in that their scales lack [[Beta keratin|<U+03B2>-keratin]]. The entire turtle's [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] surface is colored dark grey to black, with a scattering of white blotches and spots. Demonstrating [[countershading]], the turtle's underside is lightly colored.<ref name="CCC">{{cite web | title =Species Fact Sheet: Leatherback Sea Turtle | work=Caribbean Conservation Corporation & Sea Turtle Survival League | publisher=Caribbean Conservation Corporation | date =29 December 2005 | url=http://www.cccturtle.org/leatherback.htm|accessdate=6 September 2007}}</ref><ref name="ADW">{{cite web | last =Fontanes| first =F. | authorlink = | title =ADW: Dermochelys coriacea: Information | work=Animal Diversity Web | publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology | year =2003 | url =http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Dermochelys_coriacea.html | accessdate = 17 September 2007 }}</ref>

Instead of teeth, the leatherback turtle has points on the [[tomium]] of its upper lip, with backwards spines in its throat to help it swallow food and to stop their prey escaping once caught. The teeth are not used for mastication.

===Physiology===
Leatherbacks have been viewed as unique among reptiles for their ability to maintain high body temperatures using [[metabolism|metabolically]] generated heat, or [[endothermic|endothermy]]. Initial studies on leatherback metabolic rates found leatherbacks had resting metabolisms around three times higher than expected for a reptile of their size.<ref name="Paladino et al | 1990">{{cite journal |author=Paladino FV, O'Connor MP, Spotila JR |year=1990 |title=Metabolism of Leatherback Turtles, Gigantothermy, and Thermoregulation of Dinosaurs|journal=Nature |volume=344|pages=858<U+2013>860|issue=6269 |doi=10.1038/344858a0 |ref=harv}}</ref> However, recent studies using reptile representatives encompassing all the size ranges leatherbacks pass through during [[ontogeny]] discovered the resting metabolic rate of a large ''Dermochelys coriacea'' is not significantly different from predicted results based on [[allometry]].<ref name="Wallace and Jones | 2008">{{cite journal|author=Wallace BP, Jones TT |year=2008 |title=What Makes Marine Turtles Go: A Review of Metabolic Rates and their Consequences|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=356|pages=8<U+2013>24|doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2007.12.023|ref=harv}}</ref>

Rather than use a high resting metabolism, leatherbacks appear to take advantages of a high activity rate.

===South China Sea subpopulation===
A third possible Pacific subpopulation has been proposed, those that nest in Malaysia. This sub-population, however, has effectively been eradicated. The beach of [[Rantau Abang]] in [[Terengganu, Malaysia]], once had the largest nesting population in the world, hosting 10,000 nests per year. The major cause for the decline was egg consumption by humans. Conservation efforts initiated in the 1960s were ineffective because they involved excavating and incubating eggs at artificial sites which inadvertently exposed the eggs to high temperatures. It only became known in the 1980s that sea turtles undergo [[temperature-dependent sex determination]]; it is suspected that nearly all the artificially incubated hatchlings were female.<ref>Heng, Natalie [http://seatru.umt.edu.my/news-media/news-2012/ Hope remains in conserving Malaysia<U+2019>s three turtle species].

===Indian Ocean subpopulation===
While little research has been done on ''Dermochelys'' populations in the Indian Ocean, nesting populations are known from Sri Lanka and the [[Nicobar Islands]]. These turtles are proposed to form a separate, genetically distinct Indian Ocean subpopulation.<ref name="SWOT1Dutton"/>

===Death and decomposition===
Dead leatherbacks that wash ashore are micro-ecosystems while [[decomposition|decomposing]]. In 1996, a drowned carcass held [[flesh-fly|sarcophagid]] and [[blow-fly|calliphorid]] flies after being picked open by a pair of ''[[American Black Vulture|Coragyps atratus]]'' vultures. Infestation by [[carrion]]-eating beetles of the families [[Scarabaeidae]], [[ground beetle|Carabidae]], and [[Darkling beetle|Tenebrionidae]] soon followed. After days of decomposition, beetles from the families [[Histeridae]] and [[rove beetle|Staphylinidae]] and [[anthomyiidae|anthomyiid]] flies invaded the corpse as well. Organisms from more than a dozen families took part in consuming the carcass.<ref name="Fretey1998">{{cite journal |author=Fretey J, Babin R |title=Arthropod succession in leatherback turtle carrion and implications for determination of the postmortem interval | journal=Marine Turtle Newsletter | volume =80 | issue = | pages =4<U+2013>7 | month =January | year =1998 | url =http://www.seaturtle.org/mtn/PDF/MTN79.pdf | accessdate=15 September 2007|format=PDF |ref=harv}}</ref>

===Life history===
[[File:Baby-leatherback-1.jpg|thumb|right|Baby leatherback turtle at [[Gumbo Limbo Environmental Complex]] in [[Boca Raton, Florida]]|alt=Photo of two a person's hands holding a small sand-covered grey/green turtle]]
Like all sea turtles, leatherbacks start as hatchlings, climbing out of the sands of their nesting beaches. Leatherback turtles face many predators in their early life. Eggs may be predated by a diversity of coastal predators, including [[ghost crab]]s, [[monitor lizard]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[coati]]s, [[dog]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[Genet (animal)|genet]]s, [[mongoose]]s and [[Charadriiformes|shorebirds]] ranging from small [[plover]]s to large [[gull]]s. Many of the same predators will try to feed on tiny baby turtles as they try to get to the ocean, as well as [[frigatebird]]s and varied [[Bird of prey|raptors]]. Once in  the ocean, young leatherbacks still face predation from [[cephalopod]]s, [[Carcharhinidae|requiem sharks]] and various large fish. Despite their lack of a hard shell, the huge adult faces fewer serious predators, though it is occasionally overwhelmed and preyed on by very large marine predators such as [[orca]]s, [[great white shark]]s and [[tiger shark]]s. Nesting females have been preyed upon by [[jaguar]]s in the American tropics.<ref>Caut, S., E. Guirlet, P. Jouquet, M. Girondot. 2006. ''Influence of nest location and yolkless eggs on the hatching success of leatherback turtle clutches in French Guiana''.. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 84(6): 908-916.</ref><ref>Chiang, M. 2003. ''The plight of the turtle''. Science World, 59: 8.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/infobooks/seaturtle/stlongevity.html |title=Sea Turtle |publisher=Seaworld |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> Apparently, the adult leatherback aggressively defends itself at sea from predators. A medium-sized adult was observed chasing a shark that had attempted to bite it and then turned its aggression and attacked the boat containing the humans observing the prior interaction.<ref>Ernst, C., J. Lovich, R. Barbour. 1994. ''Turtles of the United States and Canada''. Washington, D.C., USA: Smithonian Institution Press.</ref> ''Dermochelys'' juveniles spend more of their time in tropical waters than do adults.<ref name="WWFEcology"/>

Adults are prone to long-distance migration. Migration occurs between the cold waters where mature leatherbacks feed, to the tropical and subtropical beaches in the regions where they hatch. In the Atlantic, females tagged in [[French Guiana]] have been recaptured on the other side of the ocean in Morocco and Spain.<ref name="Girondot1996"/>

[[Mating]] takes place at sea. Males never leave the water once they enter it, unlike females which nest on land. After encountering a female (who possibly exudes a [[pheromone]] to signal her reproductive status), the male uses head movements, nuzzling, biting, or flipper movements to determine her receptiveness. Females mate every two to three years. However, leatherbacks can breed annually. [[fertilisation|Fertilization]] is internal, and multiple males usually mate with a single female. This [[polyandry]] does not provide the offspring with any special advantages.<ref name="Lee2004">{{cite journal |author=Lee PLM, Hays GC |title =Polyandry in a marine turtle: Females make the best of a bad job | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume =101 | issue =17 | pages =6530<U+2013>6535 | date =27 April 2004 | doi =10.1073/pnas.0307982101 | pmid =15096623 | pmc =404079 |ref=harv}}</ref>

While other sea turtle species almost always return to their hatching beach, leatherbacks may choose another beach within the region. They choose beaches with soft sand because their softer [[carapace|shells]] and [[plastron]]s are easily damaged by hard rocks. Nesting beaches also have shallower approach angles from the sea. This is a vulnerability for the turtles because such beaches easily erode. They nest at night when the risk of predation is lowest. As leatherback turtles spend the vast majority of their lives in the ocean, their eyes are not well adapted to night vision on land. The typical nesting environment includes a dark forested area adjacent to the beach. The contrast between this dark forest and the brighter, moonlit ocean provides directionality for the females. They nest towards the dark and then return to the ocean and the light.

Females excavate a nest above the high-[[tide]] line with their flippers. One female may lay as many as nine [[clutch (eggs)|clutches]] in one breeding season. About nine days pass between nesting events. Average clutch size is around 110 eggs, 85% of which are viable.<ref name="CCC"/> After laying, the female carefully back-fills the nest, disguising it from predators with a scattering of sand.<ref name="WWFEcology"/><ref name="Fretey1989a">{{cite journal |author=Fretey J, Girondot M |title =Hydrodynamic factors involved in choice of nesting site and time of arrivals of Leatherback in french Guiana | journal=Ninth Annual Workshop on Sea Turtle Conservation and Biology | volume = | pages =227<U+2013>229 | year =1989 | url = | doi = | id =NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-SEFC-232 | accessdate = |ref=harv }}</ref>

{{listen|filename=Dermochelys_coriacea_001.ogg|title=The female back-fills the nest|description=}}

[[Cleavage (embryo)|Cleavage]] of the cell begins within hours of fertilization, but development is suspended during the [[gastrulation]] period of movements and infoldings of [[embryo]]nic cells, while the eggs are being laid. Development then resumes, but embryos remain extremely susceptible to movement-induced mortality until the membranes fully develop after incubating for 20 to 25 days. The structural differentiation of body and organs ([[organogenesis]]) soon follows. The eggs hatch in about sixty to seventy days. As with other reptiles, the nest's [[room temperature|ambient temperature]] [[temperature-dependent sex determination|determines the sex]] of the hatchings. After nightfall, the hatchings dig to the surface and walk to the sea.<ref name="Rimblot1985">{{cite journal |author=Rimblot F, Fretey J, Mrosovsky N, Lescure J, Pieau C | title =Sexual differentiation as a function of the incubation temperature of eggs in the sea-turtle ''Dermochelys coriacea'' (Vandelli, 1761) | journal=Amphibia-Reptilia | volume =85 | pages =83<U+2013>92 | year =1985 | url = | doi = 10.1163/156853885X00218| accessdate = |ref=harv }}</ref><ref name="Desvages1993">{{cite journal |author=Desvages G, Girondot M, Pieau C | title =Sensitive stages for the effects of temperature on gonadal aromatase activity in embryos of the marine turtle ''Dermochelys coriacea'' | journal=General Comparative Endocrinology | volume =92 | pages =54<U+2013>61 | year =1993 | url = | doi = 10.1006/gcen.1993.1142| accessdate = | pmid =8262357 | issue =1 |ref=harv  }}</ref>

==Taxonomy and evolution==
===Taxonomy===
''Dermochelys coriacea'' is the only [[species]] in genus ''Dermochelys''. The genus, in turn, contains the only extant member of the family [[Dermochelyidae]].<ref name="ITISDC">{{ITIS |id=173843 |taxon=Dermochelys coriacea |accessdate=14 September 2007}}</ref>

[[Domenico Agostino Vandelli]] named the species first in 1761 as ''Testudo coriacea'' after an animal captured at [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] and donated to the [[University of Padua]] by [[Pope Clement XIII]].<ref name="ITISTC">
{{ITIS |id=208671 |taxon=Testudo coriacea |accessdate=14 September 2007}}</ref> In 1816, French [[zoology|zoologist]] [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville|Henri Blainville]] coined the term ''Dermochelys''. The leatherback was then reclassified as ''Dermochelys coriacea''.<ref name="ITISD">
{{ITIS |id=173842 |taxon=Dermochelys |accessdate=14 September 2007}}</ref> In 1843, the zoologist [[Leopold Fitzinger]] put the genus in its own family, Dermochelyidae.<ref name="ITISFamDermo">

===Evolution===
Leatherback turtles have existed in some form since the first true sea turtles evolved over 110&nbsp;million years ago during the [[Cretaceous]] period. The dermochelyids are close relatives of the family [[sea turtle|Cheloniidae]], which contains the other six extant sea turtle species. However, their [[cladistics|sister taxon]] is the extinct family [[Protostegidae]] which included other species not having a hard carapace.<ref name="Mikko">{{cite web | last =Haaramo | first =Miiko | title =Dermochelyoidea - leatherback turtles and relatives | work=Miiko's Phylogeny Archive | publisher=Finnish Museum of the Natural History | date =15 August 2003 | url =http://www.fmnh.helsinki.fi/users/haaramo/Metazoa/Deuterostoma/Chordata/Reptilia/Parareptilia/Chelonioidea/Dermochelyoidea.htm | accessdate =15 September 2007 }}</ref><ref name="Hirayama1998">{{cite journal |author=Hirayama R | title =Oldest known sea turtle| journal=Nature| volume =392 | issue = 6677| pages = 705<U+2013>708| date =16 April 1998| url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6677/full/392705a0.html | doi =10.1038/33669| accessdate =4 September 2007 |ref=harv}}</ref>

==Importance to humans==
People around the world still harvest sea turtle eggs. Asian exploitation of turtle nests has been cited as the most significant factor for the species' global population decline. In Southeast Asia, egg harvesting in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia has led to a near-total collapse of local nesting populations.<ref name="WWFThreats"/> In Malaysia, where the turtle is practically [[local extinction|locally extinct]], the eggs are considered a delicacy.<ref name="Yahoo!News1">{{cite news | last =Townsend| first =Hamish| title =Taste for leatherback eggs contributes to Malaysian turtle's demise| publisher=Yahoo!

They are also a major jellyfish predator<ref>[http://www.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/marine_turtles/leatherback_turtle/ Panda.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/jellyfish/textonly/swarms.jsp NSF.gov]</ref> which helps keep jellyfish populations in check.

==Conservation==
Adult leatherback turtles have few natural [[predation|predators]] once they mature; they are most vulnerable to predation in their early life stages. Birds, small [[mammal]]s, and other opportunists dig up the nests of turtles and consume eggs. [[wader|Shorebirds]] and [[crustacean]]s prey on the hatchings scrambling for the sea. Once they enter the water, they become prey to predatory fish and [[cephalopod]]s. Very few survive to adulthood.

Leatherbacks have slightly fewer human-related threats than other sea turtle species. Their flesh contains too much oil and fat, reducing the demand. However, human activity still endangers leatherback turtles in direct and indirect ways. Directly, a few are caught for their meat by subsistence fisheries. Nests are raided by humans in places such as Southeast Asia.<ref name="WWFThreats">{{cite web | title = WWW - Leatherback Turtle - Threats | work=Marine Turtles | publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature | date =16 February 2007 | url =http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/species/about_species/species_factsheets/marine_turtles/leatherback_turtle/lbturtle_threats/index.cfm  | accessdate =11 September 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071121021358/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/species/about_species/species_factsheets/marine_turtles/leatherback_turtle/lbturtle_threats/index.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 November 2007}}</ref>

Many human activities indirectly harm ''Dermochelys'' populations. As a pelagic species, ''D. coriacea'' is occasionally caught as [[bycatch]]. As the largest living sea turtles, [[turtle excluder device]]s can be ineffective with mature adults. A reported average of 1,500 mature females were accidentally caught annually in the 1990s.<ref name="WWFThreats"/> Pollution, both chemical and physical, can also be fatal. Many turtles die from [[malabsorption]] and [[ileus|intestinal blockage]] following the ingestion of balloons and plastic bags which resemble their jellyfish [[predation|prey]].<ref name="CCC"/> Chemical pollution also has an adverse effect on ''Dermochelys''. A high level of [[phthalate]]s has been measured in their eggs' [[egg yolk|yolks]].<ref name="WWFThreats"/>

===Global initiatives===
''D. coriacea'' is listed on [[CITES Appendix I|Appendix I]] of [[CITES]], which makes export/import of this species (including parts) illegal.

Conserving Pacific and Eastern Atlantic populations was included among the top ten issues in turtle conservation in the first State of the World's Sea Turtles report published in 2006. The report noted significant declines in the Mexican, Costa Rican and Malaysian populations.

===National and local initiatives===
The leatherback sea turtle is subject to differing conservation laws in various countries.

The United States listed it as an [[endangered species]] on 2 June 1970.

[[Earthwatch Institute]], a global non-profit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called "Trinidad's Leatherback Sea Turtles." This program strives to help save the world's largest turtle from extinction in Matura Beach, Trinidad, as volunteers work side-by-side with leading scientists and a local conservation group, [[Nature Seekers]]. This tropical island off the coast of Venezuela is known for its vibrant ethnic diversity and rich cultural events. It is also the site of one of the most important nesting beaches for endangered leatherback turtles, enormous reptiles that can weigh a ton and dive deeper than many whales. Each year, more than 2,000 female leatherbacks haul themselves onto Matura Beach to lay their eggs. With leatherback populations declining more quickly than any other large animal in modern history, each turtle is precious. On this research project, Dr. Dennis Sammy of Nature Seekers and Dr. Scott Eckert of Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network work alongside a team of volunteers to help prevent extinction of leatherback sea turtles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthwatch.org/exped/sammy.html |title=Earthwatch: Trinidad's Leatherback Sea Turtles}}</ref>

Several Caribbean countries started conservation programs, such as The St. Kitts Sea Turtle Monitoring Network, focused on using [[ecotourism]] to highlight the leatherback's plight. On the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica, the village of [[Parismina]] has one such initiative. Parismina is an isolated sandbar where a large number of leatherbacks lay eggs, but poachers abound. Since 1998, the village has been assisting turtles with a hatchery program. The Parismina Social Club is a charitable organization backed by American tourists and expatriates, which collects donations to fund beach patrols.<ref name="Parismina Social Club">{{cite web | title =Parismina.com | work=Save the Turtles | publisher=Heather Hjorth | year =2009 | url =http://www.parismina.com | accessdate =20 October 2009}}</ref>
