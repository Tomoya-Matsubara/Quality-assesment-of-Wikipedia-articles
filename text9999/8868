The '''Pro-Composites Personal Cruiser''', also called the '''Corvair Cruiser''', is a single seat, composite [[homebuilt aircraft]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pro-Composites|url=http://www.pro-composites.com/|accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref>
==Design and development==
The Personal Cruiser is a single place, [[low-wing]], [[tricycle gear]] aircraft with a [[V-tail]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Building a Personal Cruiser|url=http://www.eaa.org/experimenter/articles/2009-04_womb.asp|accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref>

The composite aircraft is built using the FOLDaPLANE method. The method uses flexible flat composite panels that are radius-bent to form stiff [[fuselage]] sections inside a [[Jig (tool)|jig]].<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Aviation News|date=1 July 2007|page=33}}</ref>

The aircraft is designed for powerplants up to {{convert|250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} in weight and has an acceptable power range of {{convert|65|to|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet Corvair engine|Corvair]] air-cooled [[four stroke]] automotive conversion is commonly employed.<ref name="WDLA11">Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: ''World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12'', page 115.
