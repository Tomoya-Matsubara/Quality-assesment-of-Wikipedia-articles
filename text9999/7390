'''Metamaterial antennas''' are a class of [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s which use [[metamaterials]] to increase performance of miniaturized (electrically small) [[Antenna (radio)|antenna system]]s. Their purpose, as with any electromagnetic antenna, is to launch [[energy]] into free space. However, these incorporate metamaterials, which are materials engineered with novel, often [[microscopic]], structures to produce unusual [[physical properties]]. Antenna designs incorporating metamaterials can step-up the radiated [[power (physics)|power]] of an antenna. Novel components such as compact resonators and metamaterial loaded waveguides offer the possibility of previously unavailable applications. 
 
In contrast, conventional antennas that are very small compared to the wavelength reflect most of the signal back to the source. The metamaterial, on the other hand, makes the antenna behave as if it were much larger than it really is, because the novel antenna structure stores energy, and re-radiates it. Hence, these novel antennas appear to be useful for [[wireless]] systems that continue to decrease in size for applications such as portable interaction with satellites, wide angle beam steering, emergency communications devices, [[sensor|micro-sensors]] and portable [[radar|ground-penetrating radars]] to search for tunnels, caverns and other geophysical features. In addition, already established lithography techniques can be used to print metamaterial elements on a [[Printed circuit board|PC board]]. <ref name=Directive-emission/><ref name=neg-group-vel-1>

==Novel antennas==
Antenna designs incorporating metamaterials can step-up the radiated [[power (physics)|power]] of an antenna. The newest metamaterial antennas radiate as much as 95 percent of an input [[radio signal]]. Standard antennas need to be at least half the size of the signal [[wavelength]] to operate efficiently. At [[Megahertz|300 MHz]], for instance, an antenna would need to be half a [[meter]] long. In contrast, the experimental antennas are as small as one-fiftieth of a wavelength, and could have further decreases in size.

[[Metamaterials]] are a basis for further miniaturization of [[microwave antenna]]s, with efficient power and acceptable bandwidth. Novel antennas employing metamaterials offer the possibility of overcoming restrictive efficiency-bandwidth limitations for conventionally constructed, miniature antennas. 

In contrast, metamaterials permit smaller antenna elements that cover a wider [[frequency range]], thus making better use of available space for small platforms, or spaces. Some applications for metamaterial antennas are [[wireless communication]], [[Space Communications and Navigation Program|space communications]], [[GPS]], [[satellite]]s, space vehicle navigation, and airplanes. In these instances, miniature antennas with high gain are significantly relevant because the radiating elements are combined into large antenna arrays for these functions, and vehicles. Furthermore, negative [[refractive index]], produced by metamaterials, results in [[electromagnetic radiation]] being focused by a [[flat lens]] versus being dispersed.<ref name=Navy-prop-2007-09/><ref name=navyN07-184>{{USGovernment-Navy|article=Metamaterial-Based Electrically Small Antenna|url=http://www.navysbir.com/n07_3/n073-184.htm|accessdate=2011-02}}

===The DNG shell===
The earliest research in metamaterial based antennas was an analytical study of surrounding a miniature dipole antenna with material that produces a negative index of refraction. This material has an interchangeable nomenclature of negative index metamaterial (NIM) or double negative metamaterial (DNG) among other names.<ref name=DNG-shell-2003-10/> 

This configuration analytically and numerically appears to produce an order of magnitude increase in power. At the same time, the reactance appears to have a corresponding decrease. Furthermore, the DNG shell becomes a natural impedance matching network for this dipole antenna system.<ref name=DNG-shell-2003-10/>

==Ground plane applications==
Metamaterials employed in the [[ground plane]]s surrounding antennas offers improved isolation between [[radio frequency]], or [[microwave]] channels of ([[multiple-input multiple-output]]) (MIMO) [[Phased array|antenna arrays]]. Metamaterial, [[Tunable metamaterials|high-impedance groundplanes]] can also be used to improve the [[Radio frequency|radiation]] efficiency, and axial radio performance of low-profile antennas located close to the [[ground plane|ground plane surface]]. Metamaterials have also been used to increase the [[Microwave Scanning Beam Landing System|beam scanning]] range by using both the forward and backward waves in leaky wave antennas. Various metamaterial antenna systems can be employed to support surveillance sensors, communication links, navigation systems and command and control systems.<ref name=Navy-prop-2007-09>{{cite web| last = Bukva| first = Ms. Erica

==Negative refraction for novel antennas==
{{Science}}
[[Pendry]] ''et al.'' were able to show that a three-[[dimension]]al array of intersecting, thin wires could be used to create negative values of [[permittivity]] (or "'''<U+03B5>'''"), and that a periodic array of copper split ring resonators could produce an effective negative [[magnetic permeability]] (or "'''<U+03BC>'''"). 

In May 2000, a group of researchers, [[Negative index metamaterials|Smith ''et al.]]'' were the first to successfully combine the [[split-ring resonator]], often designated as SRR, with thin wire conducting posts and produce a [[left-handed material]], which had negative values of <U+03B5>, <U+03BC>, and [[refractive index]] for frequencies in the [[gigahertz]] or [[microwave]] range.<ref name=physicsengineering1/><ref name=AAAS2>

In 2002, a different class of negative refractive index (NRI) metamaterials was introduced. This employs periodic [[Electrical reactance|reactive loading]] of a 2-D [[transmission line]] as the host [[transmission medium|medium]]. This configuration actually used [[index of refraction|positive index]] (DPS) material with negative index material (DNG). It employed a small, planar, [[Superlens|negative-refractive-lens]] interfaced with a positive index, parallel-plate [[waveguide]]. This was experimentally verified soon after, in a subsequent demonstration.<ref name=first-TL-lens-proposed/><ref name=verification-of-focusing/>
 
Although some inefficiencies with [[Split-ring resonator|split-ring resonances]] were stated during and after the introduction of this combined negative and positive index material, split-ring resonators are still effectively employed as of 2009 for research. SRRs have been involved in wide ranging [[metamaterial]] research, including research on metamaterial antennas.<ref name=radiation-properties/><ref name=first-TL-lens-proposed>{{Cite journal| last =Iyer| first =Ashwin K.| coauthors =[[George V.

===Phase compensation due to negative refraction===

Negative refraction media (or DNG) can provide [[Phase (waves)|phase compensation]]. This is due to their [[Negative refractive index|negative index of refraction]]. This is accomplished by combining a slab of conventional lossless [[Metamaterial#Double positive medium|DPS material]] with a slab of lossless [[Negative index metamaterial|DNG metamaterial]]. 

The DPS has a conventional or ordinary [[index of refraction]], while the DNG has the opposite, [[negative refractive index]]. Both of these slabs are [[Impedance of free space|impedance]] matched to the outside region (e.g., free space). The desired monochromatic [[plane wave]] is radiated on this configuration. As this wave propagates through the first slab of material there is a [[Phase (waves)|phase difference]] between the exit face and entrance face. As the [[wave propagation|wave propagates]] through the second slab the phase difference is significantly decreased and even compensated for. Therefore as the wave exits the second slab the total phase difference is equal to zero. This is discussed in more detail in a section below.<ref name=DNG-MTM-overview>

With this system a phase-compensated, [[waveguiding]] system could be produced. By stacking slabs of this configuration, the phase compensation (beam translation effects) would occur throughout the entire system. Furthermore, by changing the index of any of the DPS-DNG pairs, the speed at which the beam enters the front face, and exits the back face of the entire stack-system changes. In this manner, a volumetric, low loss, time delay [[transmission line]] could be realized for a given system.<ref name=DNG-MTM-overview/>

Furthermore, this phase compensation can lead to a set of applications, which are miniaturized, [[subwavelength]], [[cavity resonator]]s, and waveguides with applications below [[diffraction limit]]s.<ref name=DNG-MTM-overview/>

===Dispersion compensation in a transmission line using negative refraction===
{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=[[Classical electromagnetism|Electrodynamics]]}}

Because of the [[dispersion relation|dispersive nature]] of the [[DNG metamaterial]] as a transmission medium, it could be useful as an effective dispersion compensation device for [[Fourier transform|time-domain applications]]. The dispersion produces a variance of the [[group speed]] of the wave components of the signal, as they propagate in the DNG medium. Hence, volumetric (stacked) DNG metamaterials could be useful for the modification of the propagation of signals along a [[microstrip| microstrip transmission line]]. At the same time, dispersion leads to distortion. However, if the dispersion could be compensated for along the microstrip line, [[Radio frequency|RF]] or [[microwave]] signals [[wave propagation|propagating]] along them would significantly decrease in distortion. Therefore, components for attenuating distortion become less critical, and could lead to simplification of components in many systems. Dispersion along the microstrip can be eliminated by correcting for the frequency dependence of the effective permittivity associated with this type of transmission line. It is possible to do this with metamaterials.<ref name=compensate-sys/> 

The strategy is to design a length of [[metamaterial]]-loaded transmission line that can be introduced, in some manner, with the original length of [[microstrip]] line to make the paired system [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersionless]] <U+2013> in other words, create a dispersion-compensating segment of [[transmission line]]. This could be accomplished by introducing a metamaterial with a certain localized [[permittivity]] and a certain localized [[magnetic permeability]], which then affects the overall relative permittivity and permeability of the microstrip line. At the same time, it is introduced in such a manner that the wave impedance in the metamaterial remains the same as it is in the original conventional microstrip line. Then the index of refraction in the medium compensates for the dispersion effects associated with the microstrip geometry itself; that is the effective refractive index of the pair becomes that of free space.<ref name=compensate-sys/> 

Part of the design strategy is that the effective permittivity and permeability of such a metamaterial should be negative <U+2013> a DNG material must be introduced for this purpose.<ref name=compensate-sys>

===Innovation===
A circuit design which has a broader range of material parameters resulting in [[negative refractive index]] has resulted in antennas that are innovative.{{Says who|date=July 2010}} Combining a left-handed transmission line segments with a conventional (right-handed) transmission line results in novel configurations with advantages over conventional antenna designs. The left-handed transmission lines are essentially a high-pass filter with phase advance. Conversely, the right-handed transmission lines are a low-pass filter with phase lag. This configuration is designated composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterial.<ref>UCLA Technology.

The conventional Leaky Wave antenna has had limited commercial success because it lacks complete backfire-to-endfire frequency scanning capability. The CRLH configuration allows the innovation over half-space scanning (broadside-to-endfire). The CRLH now allows for complete backfire-to-endfire frequency scanning, including broadside.

==Metamaterial microwave lens==
The [[metamaterial lens]], found in [[metamaterial]] antenna systems, is used as an efficient coupler to the external radiation, focusing radiation along or from a [[microstrip]] transmission line into [[transmit]]ting and receiving components. Hence, it can be designed as an [[input device]]. In addition, it can enhance the amplitude of [[evanescent waves]], as well as correct the phase of propagating waves.

===A metamaterial (lens) for directing radiation===
The metamaterial for research in many instances is the [[Split-ring resonator|SRR]] and wire configuration. However in this instance it is several layers of a [[metal]]lic mesh of thin [[wire]]s <U+2013> with wires in the [[Coordinate plane|three directions of space]], and slices of foam. Interestingly the [[permittivity]] of this material, above the [[plasma frequency]] can be positive and less than one. This means that the [[refractive index]] is less than one, but hardly above zero. In this case, the relevant parameter is often the contrast between the permittivities rather than the value of the overall permittivity itself, at desired frequencies. This occurs because the equivalent (effective) permittivity has a behavior governed by a [[plasma frequency]] in the microwave domain. This low optical index material then becomes a good candidate for creation of extremely convergent [[microlens]]es. Methods that have been developed theoretically using dielectric photonic crystals are applied in the microwave domain to realize a directive emitter using metallic grids.<ref name=Directive-emission/>

In this instance, [[Crystal lattice#Cubic structures|arrayed wires in a cubic]], [[crystal lattice]] structure can be analyzed as an array of aerials ([[Phased array|antenna array]]). Therefore, as a lattice structure it has a lattice constant. The [[lattice constant]], or lattice parameter, refers to the constant distance between unit cells in a crystal lattice.<ref name=plasmafreq/> 

The earlier discovery of [[plasmon]]s created the view that metal at [[plasmon frequency]] ''f<sub>p</sub>'' is a composite material. The effect of plasmons on any metal sample is to create properties in the metal such that it can behave as a [[dielectric]], independent of the wave vector of the EM excitation (radiation) field. Furthermore, there is a minute-fractionally small amount of plasmon energy that is absorbed into the system denoted as ''<U+03B3>''. For aluminium ''f<sub>p</sub>'' = 15 eV, and ''<U+03B3>'' = 0.1 eV. Perhaps the most important result of the interaction of metal and the plasma frequency is that permittivity is negative below the plasma frequency, all the way to the minute value of ''<U+03B3>''.<ref name=plasmafreq/><ref name=Plasma-resonance-absorption>{{Cite book|last = Bube|first =Richard H.|title =Electrons in solids: an introductory survey

==Transmission line models==
===Conventional transmission lines===
[[File:Transmission line symbols.svg|thumb|Variations on the [[electronic schematic|schematic]] [[electronic symbol]] for a transmission line.]]
[[File:Transmission line element.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of the elementary components of a transmission line.]]
A [[transmission line]] is the material [[Transmission medium|medium]] or structure that forms all or part of a [[Course (navigation)|path]] from one place to another for directing the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of energy, such as [[electromagnetic wave]]s as well as [[electric power transmission]].
Types of transmission line include [[wire]]s, [[coaxial cable]]s, dielectric slabs, [[stripline]]s, [[optical fiber]]s, [[power line|electric power lines]], and [[waveguide]]s.<ref>[[Federal Standard 1037C]]</ref>

A [[microstrip]] is a type of electrical transmission line which can be fabricated using [[printed circuit board]] technology, and is used to convey microwave-frequency signals. It consists of a conducting strip separated from a [[ground plane]] by a dielectric layer known as the '''substrate'''. Microwave components such as [[microstrip antenna|antennas]], [[directional coupler|coupler]]s, [[electronic filter|filter]]s, [[Power dividers and directional couplers#Other power dividers|power divider]]s etc. can be formed from microstrip.

From the simplified schematics to the right it can be seen that total impedance, conductance, reactance (capacitance and inductance), and the transmission medium (transmission line) can be represented by single components, which give the overall value.

With transmission line mediums it is important to match the load impedance Z<sub>L</sub> to the [[characteristic impedance]] Z<sub>0</sub> as closely as possible, because it is usually desirable that as much power as possible will be absorbed by the load.

:<math>R</math> is the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] per unit length,
:<math>L</math> is the [[inductance]] per unit length,
:<math>G</math> is the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] of the dielectric per unit length,
:<math>C</math> is the [[capacitance]] per unit length,
:<math>j</math> is the [[imaginary unit]], and
:<math>\omega</math> is the [[angular frequency]].

====Lumped circuit elements====
Often, because of the goal which moves physical metamaterial inclusions (or cells) to smaller sizes, discussion and implementation of [[Lumped element model|lumped LC circuits]], or [[Distributed element model|distributed LC networks]], are often included in the research. Lumped circuit elements are actually microscopic elements that effectively approximate, their larger component counterpart. For example circuit capacitance and inductance can be created with spilt rings, which are on the scale of nanometers at optical frequencies. The distributed LC model is related to the lumped LC model, however the [[distributed element model]] is more accurate but more complex than the [[lumped element model]].

===Metamaterial <U+2013> loaded transmission line configurations===
Some noted metamaterial [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s employ negative refractive index transmission-line metamaterials (NRI-TLM). These include [[lens (optics)|lense]]s that can overcome the [[diffraction]] limit, small band and broadband phase shifting lines, small antennas, low profile antennas, antenna feed networks, and novel power architectures, and high directivity couplers. 
A novel approach for implementing NRI-TLM is loading a planar metamaterial network of TLs with series capacitors and shunt inductors, which has a higher performance than standard TLs. This results in a large operating [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] while the refractive index is negative.<ref name=physicsengineering1/><ref name=CRLH-TL-1/> 

Because [[superlens]]es can overcome the [[diffraction limit]], this allows for a more efficient coupling to the external radiation, and enables the availability for a broader band of frequency. For example the superlens can be applied to the TLM [[Dielectric|architecture]]. In conventional lenses, the imaging is limited by the [[diffraction limit]]. With [[John Pendry]]'s superlens the details of the [[near and far field|near field]] images are not lost. Growing [[evanescent waves]] are supported in the metamaterial (''n'' < 1), which restores the decaying evanescent waves from the source. This results in a diffraction-limited resolution of <U+03BB>/6, after some small losses. This compares with <U+03BB>/2, from normal diffraction limit for conventional [[Microwave lens|lens]]es.<ref name=CRLH-TL-1/> 

By combining right-handed materials (RHM) with left-handed materials (LHM) as a composite material (CRLH) construction for the transmission line, both a backward to forward [[Radar#Types of scan|scanning]] capability is obtained.
Metamaterials were first used for antenna technology around 2005. This type of antenna used the established capability of SNGs to couple with external [[radiation]]. Resonant [[coupling]] allowed for a [[wavelength]] larger than the antenna. At microwave frequencies this allowed for an electrically small antenna.<ref name=radiation-properties>{{cite journal|last =Kamil| first =Boratay Alici| coauthors =Ekmel <U+00D6>zbay| title =Radiation properties of a split ring resonator and monopole composite| journal =Phys.

A metamaterial-loaded transmission line has stated advantages, which are significant over conventional or standard delay transmission lines. It is more compact in size, it can achieve positive or negative [[phase shift]] while occupying the same short physical length and it exhibits a linear, flatter [[phase response]] with [[frequency]], leading to shorter group delays. It can work in lower frequency because of high series distributed-capacitors, it has smaller plane dimensions than its equivalent coplanar structure.<ref name=CRLH-TL-1>

====Negative refractive index metamaterials supporting 2-D waves====
In 2002, rather than using split-ring-resonator-wire configuration, or other 3-D media, researchers looked at planar configurations that supported backward wave propagation, thus demonstrating [[negative refractive index]] and [[Superlens|focusing]] as a consequence.<ref name=first-TL-lens-proposed/>

It has long been known that transmission lines [[Periodic function|periodically]] loaded with capacitive and inductive elements in a high-pass configuration support certain types of backward waves. In addition, planar transmission lines are a natural match for 2-D wave propagation. Furthermore, with lumped circuit elements they retain a compact configuration, and can still support the lower RF range. With this in mind, periodically loaded, two-dimensional LC transmission line networks, designed with a high pass and cutoff, were proposed. The LC networks can be designed to support backward waves, without bulky SRR/ wire structure. This was the first such proposal which veered away from bulk media for a negative refractive effect (result). A notable property of this type of networks is that there is no reliance on resonance, and instead it is the ability to support backward waves which defines negative refraction.<ref name=first-TL-lens-proposed/>

The principles behind focusing are derived from Veselago's well-known paper, <U+201C>''The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of <U+03B5> and <U+03BC>''<U+201D> and Sir Pendry's Perfect lens proposal. To give an overview of how this works <U+2013> by combining a conventional, flat, (planar) [[Metamaterial#Double positive medium|DPS slab]], M-1, with a [[Metamaterial#Double negative metamaterials|left-handed medium]], M-2, a propagating [[electromagnetic wave]] with a [[wave vector]] k1 in M-1, results in a refracted wave with a wave vector k2 in M-2. Since, M-2 supports backward wave propagation k2 is refracted to the opposite side of the normal, while the Poynting vector of M-2 is anti-parallel with k2. Under such conditions, power is refracted through an effectively negative angle, which indeed implies an effectively negative index of refraction.<ref name=first-TL-lens-proposed/>

Electromagnetic waves from a point source located inside a conventional DPS can be focused inside an LHM using a planar interface of the two media. These conditions can be modeled by exciting a single node inside the DPS, and observing the magnitude and phase of the voltages to ground at all points in the LHM. A focusing effect should manifest itself as a <U+201C>spot<U+201D> distribution of voltage at a predictable location in the LHM.<ref name=first-TL-lens-proposed/>

Negative refraction and focusing of electromagnetic waves can be accomplished without employing resonances or directly synthesizing the permittivity and permeability. In addition, this media can be practically fabricated by appropriately loading a host transmission line medium. Furthermore, the resulting planar topology permits LHM structures to be readily integrated with conventional planar microwave circuits and devices.<ref name=first-TL-lens-proposed/>

When transverse electromagnetic propagation occurs with a transmission line medium, the analogy for permittivity and permeability is <U+03B5> = L, and <U+03BC> = C. Since this analogy was developed with positive values for these parameters, then the next logic step was realizing that negative values could be achieved. In order to synthesize a left-handed medium (<U+03B5> < 0 and <U+03BC> < 0) the series reactance and shunt susceptibility should become negative, because the material parameters are directly proportional to these circuit quantities.<ref name=BW-2002-11-15/> 

A transmission line which has lumped circuit elements that synthesize a left-handed medium is referred to as a "dual transmission line" as compared to "conventional transmission line". The dual transmission line structure can be implemented in practice by loading a host transmission
line with lumped element series capacitors (C) and shunt inductors (L). In this periodic
structure, the loading is strong such that the lumped elements dominate the propagation characteristics.<ref name=BW-2002-11-15>

====Left-handed behavior in LC loaded transmission lines====
At the very end of 2002, some researchers noticed that split-ring resonators (SRRs) were restricted to narrow bandwidths, and this was mostly due to the SRRs reliance on [[resonance]]. In addition, to utilize SRRs at [[Radio frequency|RF frequencies]], as with wireless devices, the split-ring resonators have to be scaled to larger dimensions. This worked against making the (wireless) devices themselves more and more compact. In contrast, [[tank circuit|LC network]] configurations could be scaled in both microwave and RF frequencies.<ref name=Lhm-Lc/> 

Therefore, it appeared that LC loaded [[transmission lines]] were enabling the design of a new class of metamaterials to synthesize a [[negative refractive index]]. In addition, by relying on LC networks to emulate electrical [[permittivity]] and [[magnetic permeability]] this resulted in a substantial increase in operating bandwidths.<ref name=Lhm-Lc/> 

Moreover, their unit cells are connected through a transmission-line network and they may,
therefore, be equipped with [[lumped circuit]] elements, which permit them to be compact at frequencies where the [[Split Ring Resonator|SRR]] cannot be compact. The flexibility gained through the use of either discrete or printed elements enables the proposed planar metamaterials to be scalable from the [[megahertz]] to the [[gigahertz|tens of gigahertz]] range. In addition, by utilizing [[varactor]]s instead of [[capacitors]], the effective material properties can be dynamically tuned. Furthermore, the proposed media are planar and inherently support two-dimensional (2-D) wave propagation, and are well suited for RF/microwave device and circuit applications.<ref name=Lhm-Lc>

====Growing evanescent waves in negative-refractive-index transmission-line media====
The periodic 2-D LC loaded transmission-line (''TL'') was shown to exhibit NRI properties over a broad frequency range. This network will be referred to as a dual TL structure since it is of a high-pass configuration, as opposed to the low-pass representation of a conventional TL structure.<ref name=EW-2003-03-24/> Dual TL structures have been used to experimentally demonstrate backward-wave radiation and focusing at microwave frequencies.<ref name=first-TL-lens-proposed/><ref name=EW-2003-03-24/> 

As a negative refractive index medium, a dual TL structure is not simply a phase compensator. It can enhance the amplitude of evanescent waves, as well as correct the phase of propagating waves. Evanescent waves actually grow within the dual TL structure.<ref name=EW-2003-03-24>

====Backward wave antenna using an NRI loaded transmission line====
Grbic ''et al.'' used one-dimensional LC loaded transmission line network, which supports fast backward-wave propagation to demonstrate characteristics analogous to "reversed Cherenkov radiation". Their proposed backward-wave radiating structure was inspired by negative refractive index LC materials. The simulated E-plane pattern at 15&nbsp;GHz showed radiation towards the backfire direction in the far-field pattern, clearly indicating the excitation of a backward wave. Since the transverse dimension of the array is electrically short, the structure is backed by a long metallic trough. The trough acts as a waveguide below cut-off and recovers the back radiation, resulting in unidirectional far-field patterns<ref name=Backward-wave-materials>{{cite journal| last = Grbic| first =Anthony| coauthors =George V.

====Planar NIMs with periodic loaded transmission lines====
A technique has been presented for implementing planar media with an effective negative refractive index. The underlying concept is based on appropriately loading a printed network of transmission lines periodically with inductors and capacitors.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one/> This technique results in effective permittivity and permeability material parameters that are both inherently and simultaneously negative, obviating the need to synthesize these parameters separately, or by separate means. The proposed media possess several other desirable features including very wide bandwidth over which the refractive index. remains negative, the ability to guide 2-D TM waves, scalability from RF to millimeter-wave frequencies, low transmission losses, as well as the potential for tunability by inserting varactors and/or switches in the unit cell.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one/> The proposed concept has been verified with circuit and full-wave simulations. Moreover, a prototype focusing device has been implemented and tested experimentally. The experimental results demonstrated focusing of an incident cylindrical wave within an octave bandwidth and over an electrically short area; a phenomenon suggestive of near-field focusing.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one/> 

Anticipated future applications are new enabling RF/microwave devices can be implemented based on these proposed planar negative refractive index media for applications in wireless communications, surveillance, and radars.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one>

==Larger NRI transmission lines==
According to some researchers SRR/wire configured metamaterials are bulky 3-D constructions, which are difficult to adapt for RF/microwave device and circuit applications.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one/> These structures can achieve a negative index of refraction only within a narrow bandwidth.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one/> Furthermore, when applied to wireless devices at RF frequencies the split ring-resonators have to be scaled to larger dimensions, which, in turn would make such devices less compact.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one/> 

Proposed designs of a new class of metamaterials to synthesize a negative refractive index.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one/> The proposed structures go beyond the wire/SRR composites in that they do not rely on SRRs to synthesize the material parameters, thus leading to dramatically increased operating bandwidths. Moreover, their unit cells are connected through a transmission-line network and they may, therefore, be equipped with lumped elements, which permit them to be compact at frequencies where the SRR cannot be compact.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one/> The flexibility gained through the use of either discrete or printed elements enables the proposed planar metamaterials to be scalable from the megahertz to the tens of gigahertz range. In addition, by utilizing varactors instead of capacitors, the effective material properties can be dynamically tuned. Furthermore, the proposed media are planar and inherently support two-dimensional (2-D) wave propagation. Therefore, these new metamaterials are well suited for RF/microwave device and circuit applications.<ref name=Planar-NIM-one/>

In the long-wavelength regime, the permittivity and permeability of conventional materials
can be artificially synthesized using periodic LC networks arranged in a low-pass
configuration. In the dual (high-pass) configuration, these equivalent material parameters
assume simultaneously negative values, and may therefore be used to synthesize a negative
refractive index.<ref name=verify-focus>{{cite journal| last = Iyer| first =Ashwin| coauthors =Peter Kremer, and George Eleftheriades

==Metamaterial antenna configurations==
Over longer distances than human hearing, or which the unaided eye can see, electromagnetic waves are transmitted over wire or via aerial devices (antennas).<ref name=antenna-theory-practice/>

An ''antenna'' (or ''aerial'') is a [[transducer]] designed to [[transmitter|transmit]] or [[Receiver (radio)|receive]] [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]]s. In other words, antennas convert electromagnetic waves into electrical currents and vice versa. 

An antenna as a radiator or receiver of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] energy can also be defined as the transition region between [[free space]] and the guiding electromagnetic structure such as the transmission line.<ref name=antenna-theory-practice/>

Antenna theory is based on [[Classical electromagnetism|classical electromagnetic theory]] as described by Maxwell's equations.<ref name=antenna-theory-practice/> Physically, an antenna is an arrangement of one or more [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s, usually called elements in this context. In transmission, an [[alternating current]] is created in the elements by applying a voltage at the antenna terminals, causing the elements to radiate an electromagnetic field. In reception, the inverse occurs: an electromagnetic field from another source induces an alternating current in the elements and a corresponding voltage at the antenna's terminals. Some receiving antennas (such as parabolic and horn types) incorporate shaped reflective surfaces to collect EM waves from free space and direct or focus them onto the actual conductive elements.
{{Main|Antenna (radio)}}

An antenna creates sufficiently strong electromagnetic fields at large distances. Reciprocally, it is sensitive to the electromagnetic fields impressed upon it externally. The actual coupling between a transmitting and receiving antenna is so small that amplifier circuits are required at both the transmitting and receiving stations. Antennas are usually created by modifying ordinary circuitry into transmission line configurations.<ref name=antenna-theory-practice/> 

The required antenna for any given application is dependent on the bandwidth employed, and range (power) requirements. In the microwave to millimeter-wave range <U+2013> wavelengths from a few meters to millimeters <U+2013> the following antennas are usually employed:<ref name=antenna-theory-practice/> 

Dipole antennas, short antennas, parabolic and other reflector antennas, horn antennas, periscope antennas, helical antennas, spiral antennas, surface-wave and leaky wave antennas. Leaky wave antennas include dielectric and dielectric loaded antennas, and the variety of microstrip antennas.<ref name=antenna-theory-practice>

===Radiation properties antennas with SRRs===

====Double negative metamaterials increase radiated power of antennas====
Through the application of [[double negative metamaterial]]s (DNG), the [[Power (physics)|power radiated]] by [[Electromagnetism|electrically]] small [[dipole]] antennas can be notably increased. This could be accomplished by surrounding an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] with a shell of double negative (DNG) material. At the time (late 2003) this was investigated both analytically and numerically. When the electric dipole is embedded in a [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] DNG medium, the analysis shows that the antenna acts inductively rather than capacitively, as it would in [[free space]] without the interaction of the DNG material. In addition, the dipole-DNG shell combination increases the real power radiated by more than an [[order of magnitude]] over a free space antenna. A notable decrease in the reactance of the dipole antenna corresponds to the increase in radiated power.<ref name=DNG-shell-2003-10/> 

Analysis also shows that the reactive power within this dipole-DNG shell system indicates that the DNG shell acts as a natural matching network for the dipole. The DNG material matches the intrinsic reactance of this antenna system to free space, hence the impedance of DNG material matches free space. It provides a natural matching circuit to the antenna.<ref name=DNG-shell-2003-10>{{Cite journal| last = Ziolkowski| first =Richard W.| coauthors =Allison D. Kipple

====Single negative SRR and monopole composite====

There is interest in the use of metamaterials to increase antenna performance. With the addition of an [[Split-ring resonator|SRR-DNG metamaterial]] the [[Power (physics)|radiated power]] was shown to increase by more than an [[order of magnitude]] over a comparable [[free space]] antenna. [[Electromagnetism|Electrically]] small antennas, high [[directivity]], and tunable operational frequency are produced with [[Metamaterial|negative magnetic permeability]]. When combining a [[Metamaterial|right-handed material]] (RHM) with a Veselago-[[left-handed material]] (LHM) other [[Metamaterial|novel properties]] are obtained. Finally, a [[Metamaterial|single negative material]] resonator, obtained with an SRR, can produce an electrically small antenna when operating at microwave frequencies, as follows:<ref name=radiation-properties/> 

The configuration of a [[split-ring resonator]] used was two concentric [[annulus (mathematics)|annular]] rings with relative opposite gaps in the inner and outer ring. Its [[geometrical]] parameters were R = 3.6&nbsp;mm, r = 2.5&nbsp;mm, w = 0.2&nbsp;mm, t = 0.9&nbsp;mm. R and r are used in [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular]] parameters, w is the spacing between the rings and t = the width of the outer ring. The material had a thickness of 1.6&nbsp;mm. Permittivity was 3.85 at 4&nbsp;GHz. The SRR was fabricated with an etching technique onto a 30 [[<U+03BC>m]] thick [[copper]]. The SRR was excited by using a [[monopole antenna]].<ref name=radiation-properties/> The [[monopole antenna]] was composed of a [[coaxial cable]], [[ground plane]], and radiating components. The ground plane material was [[aluminium]]. The operation frequency of the antenna was 3.52&nbsp;GHz, which was determined by considering the geometrical parameters of SRR.<ref name=radiation-properties/> 
A length of wire of 8.32&nbsp;mm was placed above the ground plane, connected to the antenna, which was one quarter of the operation wavelength. Therefore, this makes the antenna work with a feed wavelength was 33.28&nbsp;mm and feed frequency was 7.8&nbsp;GHz. The resonant frequency of the SRR turned out to be smaller than the monopole operation frequency.<ref name=radiation-properties/>

The monopole-SRR (metamaterial) antenna was found to operate efficiently at (<U+03BB>/10) using the SRR-wire configuration.<ref name=radiation-properties/> It demonstrated good coupling efficiency, and enough radiation efficiency.<ref name=radiation-properties/> Its operation was found to be comparable to a conventional antenna at <U+03BB>/2, which is recommended as an antenna size for efficient coupling and radiation for a conventional antenna. Therefore, the monopole-SRR antenna becomes an acceptable [[electrical]]ly small antenna, at the resonance frequency of the SRR.<ref name=radiation-properties/> This antenna can be used wherever (planar) [[patch antenna]]s are used. 

When the [[Split Ring Resonator|SRR]] is made part of this configuration the characteristics, such as radiation pattern of the antenna are entirely changed. This is noticed with comparison to a conventional monopole antenna. With modifications to the SRR structure (the metamaterial) the antenna size could reach ('''<U+03BB>/40'''). Furthermore, by coupling 2, 3, and 4 SRRs side by side, there is a slight shift radiation patterns.<ref name=radiation-properties/>

===Patch antennas with a metamaterial===
In 2005, a new, [[patch antenna]], with a [[metamaterial cover]], which resulted in enhanced [[directivity]] was proposed. According to the numerical results, the metamaterial patch antenna showed significant improvement in directivity, compared to the conventional patch antenna. This was cited in 2007 for an efficient design of directive patch antennas in mobile communications using [[metamaterial]]s. This design was based on the [[left-handed material]] (LHM) transmission line model, with the circuit elements L and C of the LHM [[equivalent circuit]] model. This study developed [[formula]]e to determine the L and C values of the LHM equivalent circuit model for desirable characteristics of directive patch antennas. Design examples derived from actual [[frequency]] bands in [[mobile communications]] were performed, which illustrates the efficiency of this patch antenna.<ref name=IEEE-V3-2005>

===Novel flat lens horn antenna===
This configuration uses flat aperture constructed of zero-index metamaterial. The zero-index metamaterial is a fully flat structure. This has advantages over ordinary (conventional) curved lenses, which results in a much improved directivity for this horn antenna configuration. In addition, references are made to the following devices: perfect lens, backward leaky-wave antenna, miniaturization of patch antenna, resonant cavity and coupler. These investigations have provided capabilities for the miniaturization of microwave source and non-source devices, circuits, antennas and the improvement of electromagnetic performances.<ref name=flat-lens-antenna>{{Cite journal|last =WU|first =Q.|title =A novel flat lens horn antenna designed based on zero refraction principle of metamaterials|journal =Appl.

==Subwavelength cavities and waveguides==
When the interface between a pair of materials, which function as optical [[transmission media]], have interactions as a result of opposing permittivity and / or permeability values that are either ordinary (positive) or extraordinary (negative), notable anomalous behaviors may occur. The pair of materials would be a DNG metamaterial (layer), paired with a DPS, ENG, or MNG layer. In these instances wave propagation behavior and properties may occur that would otherwise not happen if only DNG layers are paired together.<ref name=tang-field/> 

At the interface between two media, the concept of the continuity of the tangential electric and magnetic field components can be applied. If either the permeability or permittivity of two media has opposite signs then the normal components of the tangential field, on both sides of the interface, will be discontinuous (at the boundary). This implies a concentrated resonant phenomenon at the interface. This appears to be similar to the current and voltage distributions at the junction between an inductor and capacitor, at the resonance of an L-C circuit. This can because for notable characteristics of wave interaction in metamaterial-based devices and components. This "''interface resonance''" is essentially independent of the total thickness of the paired layers. This is because it occurs along the discontinuity between two such conjugate materials.<ref name=tang-field>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TAP.2003.817553|title=Pairing an epsilon-negative slab with a mu-negative slab: Resonance, tunneling and transparency|year=2003|last1=Alu|first1=A.|last2=Engheta|first2=N.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=ese_papers|volume=51|page=2558|bibcode = 2003ITAP...51.2558A|issue=10}}</ref><ref name=cavity-resonator/>

===Parallel-plate waveguiding structures===
The geometry consists of two parallel plates as perfect conductors (PEC), an idealized structure, filled by two stacked planar slabs of homogeneous and isotropic materials with their respective constitutive parameters <U+03B5><sub>1</sub>, <U+03B5><sub>2</sub>, u<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>. Each slab has thickness = d, slab 1 = d<sub>1</sub>, and slab 2 = d<sub>2</sub>. Choosing which combination of parameters to employ involves pairing of DPS and DNG or ENG and MNG materials. As mentioned previously, this is one pair of oppositely signed constitutive parameters, combined.<ref name=sng-dng>

===Thin subwavelength cavity resonators===
'''''Phase compensation:'''''

The real component values for negative permittivity and permeability results in a real component values for negative refraction n. In a loss less medium, all that would exist is real values. This concept can then be used to map out phase compensation when a conventional lossless material, DPS, is matched with a lossless NIM (DNG).<ref name=cavity-resonator/> 

In phase compensation, the DPS of thickness d<sub>1</sub> has <U+03B5> > 0 and <U+00B5> > 0. Conversely, the NIM of thickness d<sub>2</sub> has <U+03B5> < 0 and <U+00B5> < 0. Assume that the intrinsic impedance of the DPS dielectric material (d<sub>1</sub>) is the same as that of the outside region, and responding to a normally incident plane wave. The wave travels through the medium without any reflection because the DPS impedance and the outside impedance are equal. However, the plane wave at the end of DPS slab it is out of phase with the plane wave at the beginning of the material.<ref name=cavity-resonator/>

The plane wave then enters the lossless NIM (d<sub>2</sub>). At certain frequencies <U+03B5> < 0 and <U+00B5> < 0 and n < 0. Like the DPS, the NIM has intrinsic impedance which is equal to the outside, and, therefore, is lossless as well.<ref name=cavity-resonator/> The direction of power flow (i.e., the Poynting vector) in the first slab should be the same as that in the second one, because the power of the incident wave enters the first slab (without any reflection at the first interface), traverses the first slab, exits the second interface, enters the second slab and traverses it, and finally leaves the second slab.<ref name=cavity-resonator/> However, as stated earlier, the direction of power is anti-parallel to the direction of phase velocity. Therefore, the wave vector k<sub>2</sub> is in the opposite direction of k<sub>1</sub>. Furthermore, whatever phase difference is developed by traversing the first slab, it can be decreased and even cancelled by traversing the second slab. If the ratio of the two thicknesses is '''''d<sub>1</sub> / d<sub> 2</sub> = n<sub>2</sub> / n<sub>1</sub>''''', then total phase difference between the front face, and the back face, of the matched DPS <U+2013> NIM slabs, is zero.<ref name=cavity-resonator/> This demonstrates how the NIM slab at chosen frequencies acts as a phase compensator. It is important to note that this phase compensation process is not dependent on the thickness of '''''d<sub>1</sub> + d<sub>1</sub>''''' but only on the ratio of '''''d<sub>1</sub> / d<sub> 2</sub>'''''. Therefore, '''''d<sub>1</sub> + d<sub>1</sub>''''' can be any value, as long as this ratio satisfies the above condition. Finally, even though this two-layer structure is present, the wave traversing this structure would not experience the phase difference.

Following this, the next step is the subwavelength cavity resonator.<ref name=cavity-resonator>

'''''Compact subwavelength 1-D cavity resonators using metamaterials:'''''

The phase compensator described above can be used to conceptualize the possibility of designing a compact 1-D cavity resonator. The above two-layer structure is applied as two perfect
reflectors, or in other words, two perfect conducting plates.<ref name=cavity-resonator/>
Conceptually, what is constrained in the resonator is '''''d<sub>1</sub> / d<sub>2</sub>''''', not '''''d<sub>1</sub> + d<sub>2</sub>'''''. Therefore, in principle, one can have a thin subwavelength cavity resonator for a given frequency, if at this frequency the second layer acts a metamaterial with negative permittivity and permeability and the ratio correlates to the correct values.<ref name=cavity-resonator/>

The cavity can conceptually be thin and can still be resonant, as long as the ratio of thicknesses is satisfied in the special dispersion relation. This can, in principle, provide possibility for having subwavelength thin compact cavity resonators.<ref name=cavity-resonator/>

===Miniature cavity resonator utilizing FSS===
Frequency selective surface (FSS) based metamaterials utilize ''equivalent'' LC circuitry configurations. Using FSS in a cavity allows for miniaturization, decrease of the
resonant frequency, and also lowers the cut-off frequency along with other benefits, and smooth transition from a fast-wave to a slow-wave in a waveguide configuration.<ref name=FSS-cavity-2004>

There are a number of ''metamaterial antenna'' systems that have [[patent]]s. On some of these patents the [[researcher]]s of metamaterials and metamaterial antenna system components in the lab now have patents. 

Phased array systems and antennas for use in such systems are well known in areas such as telecommunications and other radar applications. In general phased array systems work by coherently reassembling signals over the entire array by using circuit elements to compensate for relative phase differences and time delays.<ref name=metamaterial-phased-arrayed-antenna/>

===Phased array metamaterial antenna system===

Patented in 2004, this particular phased array antenna system is useful in automotive radar applications. By using [[negative index metamaterials]] (NIMs) as a [[biconcave lens]] to focus the [[microwaves]] transmitted by the antenna the [[sidelobe]]s of the antenna are reduced. This equates to a reduction in radiated energy loss, and a relatively wider, useful bandwidth. Overall, because of the strategies implemented, this is an efficient (low-loss, reduced sidelobes), dynamically ranged [[phased array radar]] antenna system.<ref name=metamaterial-phased-arrayed-antenna/> 

In addition, the signal amplitude is increased across the [[microstrip]] transmission lines (TL) by suspending the microstrip TLs above the ground plane at a predetermined distance. In other words, they are not in contact with a solid substrate. By suspending the microstrip transmission lines in this manner, dielectric signal loss is reduced significantly, thus resulting in a less-attenuated signal at its destination.<ref name=metamaterial-phased-arrayed-antenna/>

In addition, this [[phased array]] antenna system was designed to boost the performance of the [[Monolithic microwave integrated circuit]] (MMIC), among other benefits. A transmission line (microstrip) is created with photolithography. A metamaterial lens, consisting of a thin wire array (see section above), focuses the transmitted or received signals between the microstrip TL and the emitter / receiver elements.<ref name=metamaterial-phased-arrayed-antenna>
Metz, Carsten; "Phased array metamaterial antenna system" {{US patent|6958729}} issue date October 25, 2005</ref>

The metamaterial lens also functions as an input device and consists of a number of periodic unit-cells disposed along the microstrip line. Furthermore, the metamaterial lens consists of multiple microstrip lines of the same make up; a plurality of periodic unit-cells. The periodic unit-cells are constructed of a plurality of electrical components; capacitors and inductors as components of multiple [[Distributed element model|distributed circuits]].<ref name=metamaterial-phased-arrayed-antenna/>

The metamaterial of the phased array antenna system incorporates a conducting transmission element, a substrate comprising at least a first ground plane for grounding the transmission element, a plurality of unit-cell circuits composed periodically along the transmission element, at least one [[via (electronics)|via]] for electrically connecting the [[transmission medium|transmission element]] to at least the first ground plane. It also includes a means for suspending this conducting transmission element predetermined distance away from the substrate in a way such that the transmission element is located at a second predetermined distance away from the ground plane.<ref name=metamaterial-phased-arrayed-antenna/>

===ENG and MNG waveguides and scattering devices===

===Pertaining to wireless infrastructure===
December 2010 <U+2013> Currently the variety of wireless devices is significantly expanding. For example, [[radio frequency identification]] (RFID) tags have broad applications. The possible uses now range from [[key fob|electronic key fobs]] that remotely turn over engines, work-related swipe cards, and are placed inside shoes so manufacturers may match separate components. Other wireless technologies are light switches, printers and microwave ovens. Such broad expansion leads to interference from [[EM radiation|competing signals]]. [[Metamaterials]], functional at miniature sizes can allow signals in, but keep them from getting out. Rather than the conventional absorbers at three inches thick, metamaterials can be the size of thin films, 2&nbsp;mm (0.078&nbsp;in) thick.<ref name=poliferate>{{Cite news
