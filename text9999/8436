'''George Washington Bridges''' (October 9, 1825 &ndash; March 16, 1873) was an [[United States|American]] politician and a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for the [[Tennessee's 3rd congressional district|3rd congressional district]] of [[Tennessee]] from 1861 to 1863.  A [[Southern Unionist]], he was arrested and jailed by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] authorities during the first few months of the Civil War in 1861. Though he eventually escaped, he did not take his seat in Congress until February 25, 1863, a few days before his term expired.  

Following his congressional term, Bridges joined the [[Union Army]] with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and commanded the [[10th Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry|10th Tennessee Cavalry]] from August 1863 to November 1864.  After the war, Bridges served as a state circuit court judge.  

==Early life==
Most contemporary biographies state that Bridges was born in [[Charleston, Tennessee]],<ref name=bioguide>{{cite web|title=George Washington Bridges|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000822|publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref> though in a letter to congressional biographer [[Charles Lanman]], he stated he was born in [[McMinn County, Tennessee]], and raised in McMinn's county seat, [[Athens, Tennessee|Athens]], where he would live and work for most his life.<ref name=lanman>Phillip Egelston and Ronald Fischer, Jr., "The Charles Lanman Collection of Tennessee Autobiographies," ''Journal of East Tennessee History'', Vol. 65 (1993), p. 79.</ref> He attended East Tennessee University (the forerunner of the [[University of Tennessee]]) in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], studied law, and was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]] in 1848.<ref name=bioguide />  By March 1849, he had commenced practice in Athens, specializing in claims collection.<ref>''[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024443/1850-07-19/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1836&sort=date&date2=1874&words=BRIDGS+G+W&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=0&state=Tennessee&rows=20&proxtext=%22g.+w.+bridges%22&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 Athens (TN) Post]'', 19 July 1850, p. 3.</ref>

In late 1849, the [[Tennessee General Assembly|Tennessee state legislature]] appointed Bridges district attorney general for the state's third circuit.  The legislature amended the state constitution in the early 1850s to require district attorneys to be selected by popular vote, forcing Bridges to run for reelection in 1854.<ref name=lanman />  In the election that year, he defeated rising Chattanooga attorney [[Daniel C. Trewhitt]], 3,204 votes to 2,541.<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038518/1854-06-11/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&sort=date&date2=1874&words=Bridges+G+W&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=9&state=Tennessee&rows=20&proxtext=%22g.+w.+bridges%22&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 Election Returns]," ''Nashville Union and American'', 11 June 1854, p. 2.</ref>  He remained district attorney of the 3rd circuit until 1860, when he declined to run for reelection.<ref name=lanman />

Bridges was an active member of the state [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] throughout the 1850s.  He represented McMinn County at the state Democratic Party convention in 1851,<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024443/1851-02-07/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&index=0&rows=20&words=Bridges+G+W&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=Tennessee&date2=1874&proxtext=%22g.+w.+bridges%22&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 Democratic Meeting]," ''Athens Post'', 7 February 1851, p. 2.</ref> and was appointed by newly-elected Democratic governor [[Andrew Johnson]] to the Board of Directors of the [[East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad]] in 1854.<ref name=lanman />  He also served on the Board of Directors for the Athens branch of the Bank of Tennessee during this period.<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038518/1854-01-18/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1850&sort=date&date2=1859&words=Bridge+G+W&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=6&state=Tennessee&rows=20&proxtext=%22g.+w.+bridges%22&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 Bank of Tennessee - Directors for the Branch Banks]," ''Nashville Union and American'',  18 January 1854, p. 3.</ref>  In 1859, he served as a vice president of the state Democratic Party convention.<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033395/1859-03-24/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&index=1&rows=20&words=Bridges+George+W&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=Tennessee&date2=1874&proxtext=%22george+w.+bridges%22&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 Democratic State Convention]," ''Fayetteville (TN) Observer'', 24 March 1859, p. 2.</ref>

==Civil War==

Like many of East Tennessee's pro-Union Democrats, Bridges supported the Northern Democratic candidate, [[Stephen Douglas]], during the 1860 presidential election.  He served as the Douglas [[Electoral College (United States)|elector]] for the state's [[Tennessee's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]], and thus spent several weeks campaigning for Douglas, helping him carry the popular vote in the district in the general election.<ref name=lanman />  In mid-1861, Bridges attended both the Knoxville and [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]] sessions of the pro-Union [[East Tennessee Convention]].  At both sessions, he represented McMinn County on the convention's business committee, which was responsible for drafting a declaration of grievances and a set of resolutions.<ref>[[Thomas William Humes]], ''The Loyal Mountaineers of Tennessee'' (Overmountain Press, 1998; originally published in 1888), p. 109.</ref>  

In August 1861, Bridges ran for the 3rd district seat in Congress.  While Bridges openly ran for the United States Congress, his opponent, Judge Albert Welcker, considered himself a candidate for the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]], though both were on the same ballot.  Federal authorities declared Bridges the winner of the U.S. seat, while Confederate authorities declared Welcker the winner of Confederate Congressional seat (Welcker apparently never took his seat, however).<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024443/1861-08-23/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1861&index=9&rows=20&words=Welcker&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=Tennessee&date2=1861&proxtext=welcker&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 Third Congressional District]," ''Athens Post'', 23 August 1861, p. 2.</ref><ref>Zella Armstrong, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oehdFaphbYoC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=confederate+congress+albert+welcker&source=bl&ots=EJu_SitAvb&sig=K6un-JJraDoQOsdoZX4BN1GULso&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vezsVMPQDe61sQS0_YGwCg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=confederate%20congress%20albert%20welcker&f=false History of Hamilton County and Chattanooga, Tennessee]'', Vol. 2 (Overmountain Press, 1993), p. 6.</ref>  Bridges was to serve in the [[Thirty-seventh United States Congress|Thirty-seventh Congress]] (1861&ndash;1863).<ref>{{cite web|title=George Washington Bridges|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/george_bridges/401779|publisher=Govtrack US Congress|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>  However, after fleeing to [[Kentucky]] in late 1861, he was arrested by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops while attempting to return to Tennessee to visit his family. He was held prisoner for more than a year before he made his escape on February 5, 1863,<ref name=lanman /> and made his way to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  On February 25, his credentials were submitted to the House by fellow Tennessee Unionist [[Horace Maynard]], and the House voted to admit him.<ref>''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(hj06060)) Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States, 1862&ndash;1863]'', pp. 489-490.

Bridges enlisted in the [[Union Army]] with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on August 25, 1863, and was placed in command of the [[10th Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry|10th Tennessee Cavalry]].  The unit was posted in Nashville for most of 1864, and was tasked primarily with scouting and guarding railroads.  The unit took part in operations against General [[Joseph Wheeler]] in the Murfreesboro area in August 1864, and engaged in counter-operations against a raid into the region led by [[Nathan B. Forrest]] in September 1864.<ref>"[http://www.tngenweb.org/civilwar/usacav/usa10cav.html 10th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment, U.S.A.]," ''Tennesseans in the Civil War'' (Civil War Centennial Commssion of Tennessee, 1964).  Accessed at TNGenWeb.org, 25 February 2015.</ref>

In November 1864, General [[Edward Hatch]]'s 5th division, which included Bridges' regiment, marched from Nashville to [[Pulaski, Tennessee|Pulaski]].  Bridges and several soldiers in his regiment failed to make the march, however, due to drunkenness. The division's adjutant, Major E.B. Beaumont, reported that Bridges "has been very neglectful of his duty and it would be well to get rid of him."<ref name=baggett>James Alex Baggett, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_SngMmjj8woC&pg=PT109&lpg=PT109&dq=%22george+w.+bridges%22+athens+tennessee&source=bl&ots=kPqarM6-Ja&sig=nToZ4AN_ewwOZjWaKxQ3rkR_CyE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4U7pVKGcF4iqNvH9g9AD&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=bridges&f=false Homegrown Yankees: Tennessee's Union Cavalry in the Civil War]'' (LSU Press, 2009).</ref>  General [[James H. Wilson]], the cavalry commander of the [[Army of the Ohio]], suggested Beaumont arrest Bridges for neglect of duty and make the whole incident a public affair to set an example.  Bridges was relieved of his command and discharged shortly afterward.<ref name=baggett />

==Later life==

In 1865, Bridges was elected judge of the state's fourth circuit court.  He served in this capacity until the following year.  After leaving the bench, he practiced law and established a real estate brokerage in Athens.<ref>''[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024443/1869-04-23/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1836&sort=date&rows=20&words=BRIDGES+G+W&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=5&state=Tennessee&date2=1874&proxtext=%22g.+w.+bridges%22&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=3 Athens Post]'', 23 April 1869, p. 4.</ref>  In 1869, he campaigned to become McMinn County's delegate to the 1870 constitutional convention that would create the present [[Tennessee State Constitution|state constitution]], but the county chose Colonel Archibald Blizard.<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024443/1869-12-17/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&sort=date&rows=20&words=Bridges+G+W&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=7&state=Tennessee&date2=1874&proxtext=%22g.+w.+bridges%22&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=3 The Candidate for Delegate]," ''Athens Post'', 17 December 1869, p. 2.</ref>

Bridges died in Athens on March 16, 1873, following an illness that had lasted for several months.<ref>"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033438/1873-03-19/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1836&index=0&rows=20&words=Bridges+George+W&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=Tennessee&date2=1874&proxtext=%22george+w.+bridges%22&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 Death of Judge Bridges]," ''Knoxville Chronicle'', 19 March 1873, p. 4.</ref>  He is [[burial|interred]] at Cedar Grove Cemetery in Athens.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Washington Bridges|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/brewton-brigadier.html|publisher=The Political Graveyard|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>
