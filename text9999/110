'''Idlewild and Soak Zone''', commonly known as '''Idlewild Park''' or simply '''Idlewild''', is a family [[amusement park]] situated in the [[Laurel Highlands]] near [[Ligonier, Pennsylvania]], United States, about {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of [[Pittsburgh]],  along [[US Route 30]]. Founded in 1878 as a campground along the [[Ligonier Valley Railroad]] by [[Thomas Mellon]], Idlewild is the oldest amusement park in [[Pennsylvania]] and the third oldest operating amusement park in the United States behind [[Lake Compounce]] and [[Cedar Point]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americasbestonline.com/index.php/pages/amusementparkoldest.html|title=Oldest Amusement Parks in the United States|publisher=The Best of America|accessdate=May 6, 2012}}</ref> The park has won several awards, including from industry publication ''[[Amusement Today]]'' as the best children's park in the world. 

The park was established by the prominent [[Mellon family]] in 1878, and remained family-owned for over 100 years. It expanded greatly throughout the first half of the 20th&nbsp;century, adding rides including a [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company]] [[Rollo Coaster]] in 1938, one of the company's earliest. The park is home to the Ligonier Highland Games, a Scottish athletic and cultural festival that has annually drawn over 10,000 spectators. In 1983, the park was purchased by [[Kennywood Entertainment Company]], which oversaw additional expansion, including an attraction designed and voiced by [[Fred Rogers]] based on his television show ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''. Since 2008, the park, as well as others formerly under Kennywood Entertainment, have been owned by [[Spain|Spanish]] company [[Parques Reunidos]] and operated by their American subsidiary [[Palace Entertainment]].

== History ==
=== Ligonier Valley Railroad: 1878<U+2013>1952 ===
On April 15, 1853, the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] granted a [[charter]] for a railroad to haul coal and timber between the towns of [[Ligonier, Pennsylvania|Ligonier]] and [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]]. For nearly twenty years, Latrobe and Ligonier Rail Road Company performed no work on the railroad, and renewed their charter in 1866 and 1869. Following an additional renewal in 1871, the company changed its name to the [[Ligonier Valley Railroad]] and acquired a {{convert|10.3|mi|km}} stretch of land. [[Land grading]] and bridge construction for the [[narrow gauge]] line was mostly completed by 1873.<ref name=LVR>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Mainline of the Ligonier Valley Rail Road |url=http://www.lvrra.org/history.htm |publisher=Ligonier Valley Rail Road Association |year=2004 |accessdate=January 28, 2009}}</ref><ref name=C7>Croushore, pg. 7</ref> 

In 1875, the partially constructed railway was sold at a [[sheriff's sale]] after the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], the Latrobe terminus of the line, declined to assume financial responsibility. [[Thomas Mellon]], a retired [[Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] judge from [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]], purchased the Ligonier Valley Railroad at auction. Mellon had founded the [[Mellon Financial|T. Mellon and Sons Bank]], and was invested in coal, steel, oil, glassmaking, and other railroad ventures. In an effort to attract passengers, Mellon decided to offer recreational grounds along the route.<ref name=C7/> 

On May 1, 1878, William Darlington, landowner and namesake of the nearby village of [[Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania|Darlington]], responded to Mellon's request to use his land:<ref name=C7/>
{{Quote|Dear Sir:<br />
In compliance with your request, I will and do hereby agree to grant to the Ligonier Valley Rail Road Company the right and privilege to occupy for picnic purposes or pleasure grounds that portion of land in Ligonier Township, Westmoreland County as follows <U+2013> the strip or piece of ground lying between the railway and the creek and extending from the old cornfield to Byards run <U+2013> also two or three acres on the opposite side of the creek adjoining near the same. Without compensation in the shape of rent for three years from the first of April 1878 provided no timber or other trees are to be cut or injured <U+2013> the underbrush you may clear out if you wish to do so.<br />
Yours respectfully,<br />
Wm. M. Darlington}} 

The first structure, built that year, was a [[train station|train depot]] measuring {{convert|10|ft|m}} by {{convert|25|ft|m}}. The depot was described as the smallest full-service station in the United States.<ref name=F52>Futrell, pg. 52</ref> Initial development of the land included camp sites, an artificial lake for fishing and boating, picnic tables, and a large hall. The railroad provided easy access to the site, attracting visitors from {{convert|50|mi|km}} away in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and the surrounding areas for a getaway in the country.<ref name=History>{{cite web |title=Idlewild History in Brief |url=http://www.idlewild.com/history/index.php |publisher=Idlewild and SoakZone |accessdate=October 13, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080723161933/http://www.idlewild.com/history/index.php <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=July 23, 2008}}</ref> The ''Ligonier Echo'' noted that on [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], 1890, the trains to the park were so crowded that the "tops of the coaches were covered with boys."<ref name=F54>Futrell, pg. 54</ref> 

While the initial lease with Darlington confined the park to between the railroad and the north bank of the [[Loyalhanna Creek]], permission was later granted for construction of a bridge across the river, allowing expansion to the south in the mid-1880s.<ref name=F52/><ref>Croushore, pg. 18</ref> Three lakes, Woodland, St. Clair, and Bouquet, were dug between 1880 and 1896. In 1896, the park added a T.M. Harton Company steam [[carousel]] in the center of the park. The Pittsburgh-based company was a major manufacturer of carousels and roller coasters. By the end of the 19th century, attractions at the park included a bicycle track around Lake Bouquet, a hiking trail on the lake's island, fishing in the Loyalhanna Creek, [[Watercraft rowing|rowboating]], and many walks and gardens. The park had dining halls, auditoriums, pavilions, a boathouse, an amphitheater, a bandstand, and athletic facilities.<ref name=F54/>     

[[File:Idlewild Skooters.jpg|thumb|upright|A sign acknowledging the Skooters' 1931 construction.]]
In 1931, Judge Mellon's son [[Richard B. Mellon]], brother of [[Andrew Mellon]], and C. C. Macdonald acquired the park under a partnership known as the Idlewild Management Company. The first season under the financial support of Mellon and the management of Macdonald and his family brought electricity to the park, allowing for later operating hours and electric-powered rides, including a three-row [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company]] carousel.<ref name=C25/> The park also debuted a den of [[American Black Bear|black bears]] that year. The bears were across the path from a cage of [[monkey]]s, who escaped in 1932. Park management offered a reward of $3 each ($ {{inflation|US|3|1932|r=0}} each in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for the return of the seven monkeys, believing that they had been set loose. R. Z. Macdonald later said that his father, C. C., was always amused and pleased with the publicity that the escape created, though he never formally accused his father.<ref>Croushore, pg. 37</ref>

The Macdonalds sought to maintain the park's natural beauty, planting 10,000&nbsp;shrubs in the first year, and thousands of trees during the 1930s. In the first few years, the park added a circle swing, a [[The Whip (ride)|Whip]], a miniature railroad, and in 1938, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company [[Rollo Coaster]]. World War II and the resulting [[rationing]] forced the park to close in 1943. Upon reopening in 1946, the park added the [[Caterpillar ride|Caterpillar]] and a small [[showboat]] that sailed in Lake Bouquet.<ref name=C25>Croushore, pg. 25</ref>

=== Macdonald family: 1952<U+2013>1983 ===
The Macdonald family obtained complete ownership of the park in 1951.<ref name=History/> After leaving Idlewild, the Mellon family also abandoned the Ligonier Valley Railroad, in decline after the closing of area coal mines and decreased passenger traffic. The railroad ceased operations in 1952. Although the park originally depended on the railroad, its closing had no effect. In 1913, the [[Lincoln Highway]] had been established as the first cross-country auto route, stretching from [[Times Square]], [[New York City]], to [[Lincoln Park (San Francisco)|Lincoln Park]], [[San Francisco]]. It passed directly by Idlewild on what is now [[U.S. Route 30]]. As automobile traffic to the park increased, several parking lots and a [[Gulf Oil]] gas station, a [[Mellon Financial|Mellon]] company, were added in the 1930s.<ref name=C25/> 

Under the Macdonalds, the park continued to expand. Kiddieland was constructed between 1954 and 1956, and featured many smaller version of rides meant for children. Some of the rides included miniature boats, a Ferris wheel, [[Doodlebug (rail car)|doodlebug]], and pony rides.<ref>Croushore, pgs. 59<U+2013>63</ref>

Clinton "Jack" Macdonald became president of the park in 1957. In 1959, Macdonald and Lewis Davidson, a [[bagpipe]] director at the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]], started the [[#Ligonier Highland Games|Ligonier Highland Games]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[highland games]] event held at the park. During the same year that he assumed control of the park, Macdonald was appointed as the first commissioner of the Scottish [[Clan Donald]] for Pennsylvania. The games, held annually in early September after the park had closed for the summer, became one of the largest and most highly regarded Scottish athletic and [[Culture of Scotland|cultural]] competitions in the country.<ref name=games/> Jack Macdonald said of the Games: "We're not interested in becoming one of the biggest Games. We just want to be one of the nicest."<ref name=games>{{cite news |first=Candy |last=Williams |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribunereview/focus/s_584818.html |title=Ligonier Highland Games celebrate Scottish heritage |publisher=''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review'' |date=August 31, 2008 |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}</ref>

The park sustained heavy damage when the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] dropped {{convert|14|in|mm}} of rain on the area in 24&nbsp;hours in June 1972. Lake St. Clair and Lake Bouquet, merging in the resulting flood, caused significant damage to the boathouse. The flood lifted and twisted the park's Loyalhanna Limited Railroad, which required extensive repairs.<ref>Croushore, pg. 83</ref>

=== Kennywood era: 1983<U+2013>2007 ===
On January 27, 1983, [[Kennywood Entertainment Company|Kennywood Park Corporation]] of [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania]], near Pittsburgh, bought the park from the Macdonald family for a reported price of $1.8 million. [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OLMqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AmAEAAAAIBAJ&dq=debartolo&pg=1948%2C5547016] Ironically both Kennywood and Idlewild were founded as amusement parks by the [[Mellon family]].  During the first winter, several changes occurred. Jumpin' Jungle, a children's play area, was added. Story Book Forest was no longer run as a separate operation and was merged with the rest of the park. What had been Historic Village was relocated and renamed.<ref name=C87/>

As the popularity of [[waterpark]]s increased, the H20hhh Zone was added in 1985. In 1989, the park expanded across the [[Loyalhanna Creek]] by adding a [[tram|trolley]] ride based on ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', a popular children's television show. The ride was designed and voiced by children's entertainer [[Fred Rogers]], a native of Latrobe. The area was expanded the following year to include Raccoon Lagoon, an area for children.<ref name=History/> A [[Ferris wheel]], [[Tilt-A-Whirl]] and a water raft ride were added by the end of the 1980s, along with games, new food stands and restaurants.<ref name=C87/> 

The 1990s brought the addition of the [[Wild Mouse (Idlewild)|Wild Mouse]], the only [[Wild Mouse roller coaster]] designed by Dutch company [[Vekoma]]. The roller coaster was built in 1985 and had previously operated at [[Wiener Prater]] in [[Austria]] and [[Alton Towers]] in [[England]], before opening at Idlewild in 1993. Kennywood continued the Macdonald tradition of offering large-scale entertainment, presenting circuses, [[lumberjack]] and [[acrobatics]] shows, and stage performances at the new Hillside Theater. A large picnic area with several log pavilions and game fields was added in 1999. In the early years of the 21st&nbsp;century, additions to the waterpark doubled its size and led to a new name, Idlewild and Soak Zone.<ref name=C87/>

=== Palace Entertainment, since 2008 ===
Kennywood Entertainment, itself an operator of a family-owned park, had acquired other family-owned and operated parks after its purchase of Idlewild in 1983. Kennywood's owners rejected offers by larger companies to purchase the group, such as one in 1997 by Premier Parks, the company that acquired the [[Six Flags]] franchise a year later. Kennywood refused the Premier offer and others on grounds that the new owners would make too many changes to the existing parks. However, on December 11, 2007, Kennywood Entertainment announced that it would sell its parks to the [[Madrid]]-based amusement company, [[Parques Reunidos]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Belser |title=Kennywood sold to Spanish company |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07346/840999-85.stm |publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 15, 2008}}</ref> The fourth- and fifth-generation family ownership of Kennywood ensured that with the transaction all of the company's parks would experience few changes and that day-to-day park operations would remain local.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mary Lou |last=Rosemeyer |title=New Chapter in Kennywood Entertainment History Announced |url=http://www.kennywood.com/docs/12.11.07KECNewChapterRelease.pdf |date=December 11, 2007 |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |publisher=Kennywood Entertainment Company}}</ref> 

In December 2009, Idlewild announced that the [[Royal Hanneford Circus]] would perform at the park during the 2010 season, for the first time since 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idlewild.com/fun_zone/Circus.php |title=The Royal Hanneford Family Circus |publisher=Idlewild and Soakzone |date=December 16, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091223040557/http://www.idlewild.com/fun_zone/Circus.php <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=December 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kennywood.com/funzone/seasonopener/seasonopener.html |title=Idlewild |work=Season Opener |publisher=Kennywood |accessdate=May 9, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100527003511/http://www.kennywood.com/funzone/seasonopener/seasonopener.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=May 27, 2010}}</ref>

For the 2011 season, the park announced that they would replace their swimming pool<U+2014>built in 1931<U+2014>with a $2 million [[wave pool]]. The project will be the largest capital improvement undertaken by the park. The pool will be [[Swimming pool#Zero-entry swimming pools|zero-entry]] to a maximum {{convert|6|ft|m}} deep and hold 280,600 galloons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/westmoreland/s_711842.html |publisher=''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |title=Idlewild to add $2 million wave pool |first=Bob |last=Karlovits}}</ref>

=== Location ===
The park is situated alongside [[U.S. Route 30]], also historically known in Pennsylvania as the [[Lincoln Highway]], the first US transcontinental highway. The region surrounding the park is the [[Laurel Highlands]], and the park sits in the [[foothills]] of the [[Laurel Hill (Pennsylvania)|Laurel Ridge]]. 

The region was prominent in the [[French and Indian War]] with [[Fort Ligonier]] located just {{convert|2|mi|km}} away. On November 12, 1758, volunteers led by [[George Washington]] marched from Ligonier to aid [[George Mercer (military officer)|George Mercer]] and his troops. At night in heavy fog, the two units mistook one another for the enemy and exchanged fire. Thirteen soldiers and one lieutenant were killed. Realizing the mistake, Washington ran amongst both groups, shouting and raising the men's rifles into the air. Washington later wrote of the incident that he never felt in more danger in his life. Though the location had never been entirely verified, in ''Images of America: Idlewild'', author Jeffrey S. Croushore acknowledges the opinion that the event took place in a section of Idlewild that was previously a wooded area known as the Woodlands.<ref>Croushore, pg. 10</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_479811.html |title=Document recounts Washington's close call |first=A.J. |last=Panian |publisher=''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref>

== Attractions ==
[[File:Idlewild Carousel sign.jpg|thumb|upright|A sign at the carousel, identifying it as [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company]] No. 83]]

=== Olde Idlewild ===

Olde idlewild is centered around the park's [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company]] [[Carousel]] built in the 1920s and brought to Idlewild in 1931. The Carousel's music is provided by two [[Fairground organ|band organs]]: an Artizan Style D (fitted with a [[Wurlitzer]] roll frame as Wurlitzer rolls are more common than Artizan rolls) and a Wurlitzer [[Calliope (music)|Caliola]].  The music of these two organs, which play on a regularly alternating basis, can be heard throughout the Olde Idlewild and the lower parking areas.  Olde Idlewild contains many of the park's traditional amusement rides. On the parking lot side of the Merry-Go-Round is the [[wooden roller coaster|wooden]] [[Rollo Coaster]], built by Philadelphia Toboggan in 1938 with lumber from the park, using a sawmill built nearby specifically for the project.<ref name=C25/> The [[American Coaster Enthusiasts]] named the Rollo Coaster a "Classic Coaster".<ref>{{cite web |title=ACE Coaster Classic Awards |url=http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/?type=1 |publisher=American Coaster Enthusiasts |accessdate=January 28, 2009}}</ref> On the other side of the Merry-Go-Round is the [[Caterpillar ride|Caterpillar]]. Built in 1947, Idlewild's model is one of only three similar rides still in operation in North America, one of two featuring a working canopy that covers the riders, and the only one that still uses an operating undercarriage fan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Operating Classic Amusement Park Rides |url=http://www.napha.org/nnn/LIBRARY/FactsFigures/OperatingClassicAmusementParkRides/tabid/73/Default.aspx |publisher=National Amusement Park Historical Association |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}</ref> Sitting in the trees behind the Caterpillar is the [[Wild Mouse (Idlewild)|Wild Mouse]], added in 1993. The Wild Mouse was built by [[Vekoma]] and operated at [[Alton Towers]] in [[Staffordshire]], [[England]], before being moved to Idlewild in 1993.<ref>Croushore, pgs. 106<U+2013>107</ref> The [[Twist (ride)|Scrambler]], along with the [[Flying Scooters|Flying Aces]] added in 2007, also surround the Merry-Go-Round.<ref name=Rides>{{cite web |title=In the Park |url=http://idlewild.com/in_the_park/ |publisher=Idlewild and Soak Zone |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}</ref>

Another group of rides in Olde Idlewild is located around the park's [[Bumper car|Skooters]], added in 1931. Surrounding the Skooters is the [[Balloon Race (ride)|Balloon Race]], [[Paratrooper (ride)|Paratrooper]], [[Ferris wheel]], and [[Octopus (ride)|Spider]]. Below the Paratrooper on the north bank of the Loyalhanna are the [[The Whip (ride)|Whip]], built in 1938, the [[Round Up (ride)|Super Round Up]], and the [[Tilt-A-Whirl]].<ref name=Rides/>

=== Hootin' Holler ===
In 1976, the Historic Village was built to commemorate the [[United States Bicentennial]]. Modeled after a typical 19th&nbsp;century [[American Old West|Western town]], the area included a [[general store]], [[blacksmith]] and wood shops, sheriff's office and jail, newspaper office, [[Western saloon|saloon]] and restaurant.<ref>Croushore, pg. 84</ref>

In 1984, Historic Village was relocated from near the gates to the center of the park, and renamed Hootin' Holler.<ref name=C87/> The area contains Confusion Hill and Dizzy Lizzy's <U+2013> both walkthrough tours with optical illusions.<ref name=Rides/> The park's Loyalhanna Limited Railroad [[train ride]] crosses the Loyalhanna Creek to Raccoon Lagoon and back. The area's newest rides are the Howler, a spinning ride modeled like a tornado, and Paul Bunyan's Loggin' Toboggan, a [[Log flume (attraction)|log flume]] ride.

=== Soak Zone ===
[[File:Captain Kidds.jpg|thumb|Captain Kidd's play area]]
The location of the Soak Zone was originally an island known as Flower Island, until part of the surrounding lake was filled in. Under previous names it was called the H20hhh Zone and later Dr. Hydro's Soak Zone. The area originally consisted of just the pool and bathhouse, until slides were first added in 1985. A raft ride, Rafter's Run, was added the next year.<ref>Croushore, pgs. 96<U+2013>97</ref> After additional expansions, the Soak Zone includes the swimming pool, body slides, inner-tube slides, a slide with foam mats, and many features for children, including a miniature pool and Captain Kidd's Adventure Galley, a play area added in 2006.<ref name=Rides/>

=== Jumpin' Jungle ===
Added in 1983, Jumpin' Jungle is an interactive play area for both children and adults. The area includes many attractions such as a [[ball pit]], [[playground slide|slides]], climbing nets, and a suspension bridge.<ref name=Rides/> Added in 2008, Bigfoot's Mudslide gets its name from [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County's]] reputation for the most sightings in Pennsylvania of [[Bigfoot]], an alleged ape-like creature said to inhabit remote forests.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Sloan |title=New rides await Kennywood, Idlewild |url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2008/apr/27/new-rides-await-at-kennywood-idlewild/ |publisher=Vindy.com |date=April 27, 2008 |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}</ref>

=== Raccoon Lagoon ===
[[File:Mr Rogers Neighborhood.jpg|thumb|[[Animatronic]] characters at Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood ride]]
The park's kiddieland area, Raccoon Lagoon, was added in 1989, after originally opening in a different location in 1954. The {{convert|9|acre|ha|adj=on}} area devoted to children-oriented rides is one of the largest in the United States.<ref name=Rides/> Also in Raccoon Lagoon is Mister Rogers' [[Neighborhood of Make-Believe]]. Built in 1989, the trolley ride was designed specifically for Idlewild by local native [[Fred Rogers]] and is based on his popular children's television show.<ref name=C87>Croushore, pg. 87</ref>

=== Story Book Forest ===
Arthur Jennings, who portrayed the clown "Happy Dayze" in the park during the 1950s, was an accomplished engineer who approached park management about creating Story Book Forest, a theme park based on "emotion rather than motion".<ref>Croushore, pg. 4</ref> Jennings did much of the work himself, including life-sized models of [[fairy tales]]. The park, originally separate from Idlewild, opened in 1956.<ref>Croushore, pg. 51</ref> Story Book Forest featured many attractions such as a [[pirate ship]], a [[castle]], and many live storybook characters.<ref>Croushore, pgs. 67<U+2013>68</ref> The entrance to the Forest is a giant storybook which reads "Here is the Land of Once Upon a Time ... Step through the pages of this big Story Book ... and visit the people and places every child knows ... and Loves. Here dreams are real ... and so are your Story Book friends."<ref>Croushore, pg. 65</ref> Now incorporated with the rest of the park, Story Book Forest celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-07-31-story-book-forest_x.htm |title=Pennsylvania's Story Book Forest turns 50 |publisher=''USA Today'' |date=August 1, 2006 |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>

=== Ligonier Highland Games ===
The Ligonier Highland Games is a [[highland games]] event that takes place in early September.  The events primarily take place at Idlewild, while some events also take place in nearby [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]].  Competitions include heavy athletics such as the [[caber toss]], [[stone put]], and [[weight throw|weight]] and [[Scottish hammer throw|hammer throw]].  Other competitions in [[Music of Scotland|music]] include [[highland dancing]], solo and [[pipe band|band]] [[bagpipes|piping]], drumming, [[Scottish fiddling]], and [[Scottish harp]]. Vendors sell related items such as authentic [[tartans]], [[bagpipes]], and [[jewellery]]. While initially attracting crowds of 1,200, the festival now records average attendances near 10,000.<ref name=games/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ligoniergames.org/ |title=Ligonier Highland Games |publisher=Clan Donald Educational and Charitable Trust |accessdate=December 30, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080614170527/http://www.ligoniergames.org/ |archivedate = June 14, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
