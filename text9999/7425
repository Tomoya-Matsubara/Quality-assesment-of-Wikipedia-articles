'''Donald Brashear''' (born January 7, 1972) is an American professional [[ice hockey]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|left winger]] who is currently a member of the [[Sorel-Tracy GCI]] in the [[Ligue Nord-Am<U+00E9>ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH). He previously played for five different organizations in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). His main role is that of an [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]]. He was considered one of the best, and most feared, in the NHL. His aggressive style of play has led to being among the league leaders in [[penalty minutes]] six times, while currently ranking fifteenth all-time in NHL history, and has resulted in multiple suspensions as well. He remains the [[Vancouver Canucks]] all-time single season leader in penalty minutes, which he set in the [[1997<U+2013>98 NHL season|1997<U+2013>98 season]]. He was the victim of one most publicized incidents of on-ice violence in NHL history, when he was slashed in the head by [[Marty McSorley]], during the [[1999-2000 NHL season|1999<U+2013>2000 season]].

Brashear was born in [[Bedford, Indiana|Bedford]], [[Indiana]] but moved to [[Quebec]] at a young age. He has represented his native [[United States]] twice internationally, playing in consecutive [[IIHF World Championships]] in [[1997 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1997]] and [[1998 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1998]]. 
== Early life ==
Brashear is the youngest of three children born to an [[African-American]] father and [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]] mother, Johnny and Nicole Brashear, in [[Bedford, Indiana|Bedford]], [[Indiana]]. His father was an alcoholic who abused his family, including beating Donald with belts and electrical cords. On one occasion he threw a six-month-old Donald across the room.<ref name=life/> His mother, fearful that Johnny might kill her, left the family and returned to Canada. Later she came back to take the children, but left Donald to live with his father for another four years,<ref name=life/> until Donald's paternal grandmother sent him to Canada.<ref name=don/> Donald's mother later stated that she left him behind because her future husband was prejudiced and did not want another bi-racial child in the house.<ref name=life/>

Brashear moved in with his mother and his new stepfather in [[Loretteville, Quebec City|Lorretteville, Quebec]]. He suffered further abuse in his new surroundings, he was forced to sleep with a garbage bag tied around his waist to help him stop wetting the bed, and he was verbally berated for not being able to tie his shoes.<ref name=life/>  His mother finally decided to give him up to [[foster care]], due in part because of what she called "mental problems" from the abuse he had suffered, and because he did not accept her as his mother.<ref name=life>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/01/AR2009050104147_4.html?sid=ST2009050104383 |title=For Capitals' Brashear, Fighting's a Way of Life |publisher= ''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=2009-05-02 |last=Wise |first=Mike |accessdate=2009-05-05}}<!--(Archived by WebCite<U+00AE> at http://www.webcitation.org/5s6ToAbHt)--></ref> Brashear lived in two different foster homes that sent him away since the families believed he was a "little too much to handle."<ref name=don/>

At the age of eight Brashear moved to [[Val-Belair, Quebec]] and settled into a new foster home.
