==History==
The site was originally a hotel that was called the ''Wrest Point Riviera'', built by [[Arthur Drysdale]] and opened in [[1939]].  The hotel was later sold to [[Federal Group|Federal Hotels]], who remain the present owners.

In the [[1960s]], The Federal Group attempted to secure Australia's first casino license.  At the time, Tasmania's natural scenery and beauty were not widely known elsewhere, and as a result the state wasn't attracting many tourists.  The company hoped that a casino would be the drawcard that would kickstart Tasmania's tourism industry.

One of the company's executives, John Haddad (now the Managing Director), was assigned the role of getting a casino license.  He met with then [[Premier of Tasmania|Tasmanian Premier]] [[Eric Reece]] and other state officials.  A referendum was called, and narrowly passed.

The development of the casino included the construction of the 17-storey hotel tower, a landmark that is nationally idenitified with Hobart, and [[as of 2006|to this day]] is still the city's tallest building.

After the centre's opening in 1973 (after which it was known as ''Wrest Point Hotel Casino'') the casino kickstarted the nation's casino industry, with 12 additional casinos opening across the country.  This included a second Federal Group casino in Tasmania, the [[Country Club Resort]], which opened in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] in [[1982]].

Since the opening of the casino, the state's tourism industry has boomed, as its management had hoped.

The building has been extended in recent years, including the conference centre which was opened in [[1984]], and the boardwalk in [[1996]].
