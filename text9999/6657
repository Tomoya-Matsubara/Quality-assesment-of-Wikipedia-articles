'''Verne Citadel''' is a [[citadel]] on the [[Isle of Portland]], [[Dorset]], [[England]].  The citadel was started in 1847 at a camp for prisoners building [[Portland harbour]]'s [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s, and was extended during the 1860s as a result of the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom|Royal Commission]], ending up with 8 [[Rifled Muzzle Loader|RML]] guns with calibres up to 12".  It is now used as a [[prison]] <U+2014> [[The Verne (HM Prison)|The Verne]], with no public access. Following WWII the Citadel was used for training newly conscripted recruits of the corps of the Royal Engineers.  The moat was used for training in the use of explosives. In 1949 the Citadel reverted to its former use as a prison.

Built from stone taken from local quarrying, [[Nicodemus Knob]], a landmark pillar left as a quarrying relic, marks the extent of how much stone was removed from the main area of quarrying.<ref>http://www.jurassiccoastline.com/jurassic_Info1b.asp?ID=158&AreaID=158</ref>
