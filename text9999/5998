{{transport}}

'''Transport''' or '''transportation''' is the movement of people and [[cargo|goods]] from one location to another.  [[Modes of transport]] include [[aviation|air]], [[rail transport|rail]], [[road transport|road]], [[ship transport|water]], [[cable transport|cable]], [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], and [[space transport|space]]. The field can be divided into [[infrastructure]], [[vehicle]]s, and [[business operations|operations]]. 

Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for transport, and may be [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airway (aviation)|airways]], [[waterway]]s, [[canal]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], and terminals such as [[airport]]s, [[train station|railway station]]s, [[bus station]]s, [[warehouse]]s, [[trucking terminal]]s, refueling depots (including fueling docks and [[fuel station]]s), and [[seaport]]s. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.

Vehicles traveling on these networks may include [[automobile]]s, [[bicycles]], [[buses]], [[train]]s, [[truck]]s, [[pedestrian|people]], [[helicopter]]s, and [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]]. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including financing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.

Passenger transport may be [[public transport|public]], where operators provide scheduled services, or [[private transport|private]]. Freight transport has become focused on [[containerization]], although [[Bulk material handling|bulk transport]] is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause [[air pollution]] and [[Land use|use large amounts of land]]. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow, and restrain [[urban sprawl]].

==Mode==
{{Main|Mode of transport}}
A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of vehicle, infrastructure and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability, route, and speed.

===Human-powered===
{{Main|Human-powered transport}}

Human powered transport is the transport of people and/or goods using [[human]] muscle-power, in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human-power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, [[leisure]], [[physical exercise]] and [[environmentalism]]. Human-powered transport is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions. It is considered an ideal form of [[sustainable transportation]].

Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when enforcing the human power with vehicles, such as [[bicycles]] and [[inline skates]]. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by [[watercraft rowing]] and [[skiing]]; even the air can be entered with [[human-powered aircraft]].

===Animal-powered===
{{Main|Animal-powered transport}}
Animal-powered transport is the use of [[working animal]]s for the movement of people and goods. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as [[pack animal]]s for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in [[team]]s, to pull [[sled]]s or wheeled [[vehicle]]s. Animals are superior to people in their speed, endurance and carrying capacity; prior to the Industrial Revolution they were used for all land transport impracticable for people, and they remain an important mode of transport in less developed areas of the world.

===Air===
{{Main|Aviation}}
[[File:Airfrance.a318-100.f-guga.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Air France]] [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A320 family|A318]] lands at [[London Heathrow Airport]]]] 

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]], commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish from [[rotorcraft|rotary-wing aircraft]], where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A [[gyroplane]] is both fixed-wing and rotary-wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large [[airliner]]s and military cargo aircraft. 

Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for [[lift (soaring)|lift]] and an area for [[landing]]. The majority of aircraft also need an [[airport]] with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo and passengers. While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take off and landing on ice, snow and calm water. 

The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the [[rocket]]. Commercial jets can reach up to {{convert|955|km/h|mph}}, single-engine aircraft {{convert|555|km/h|mph}}. Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incur high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places [[helicopter]]s can be used.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 281</ref> WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' April 28, 2009.</ref>

===Rail===
{{Main|Rail transport}}
[[Image:ICE1 Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|[[InterCityExpress]], a German [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] passenger train]]

Rail transport is where a [[train]] runs along a set of two parallel [[steel]] [[rail tracks#Railway rail|rails]], known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored [[perpendicular]] to [[railroad tie|ties]] (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or [[rail gauge|gauge]]. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete, or compressed [[soil|earth]] and [[gravel]] in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include [[monorail]] and [[maglev (transport)|maglev]].

A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that run on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a [[locomotive]], that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by [[steam locomotive|steam]], [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] or by [[electric locomotive|electricity]] supplied by [[railway electrification system|trackside systems]]. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a [[multiple unit]]. Also, a train can be powered by [[horsecar|horses]], [[funicular|cables]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]]s. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]], though not as efficient as ships.

[[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] trains are long-haul services connecting cities;<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 279</ref> modern [[high-speed rail]] is capable of speeds up to {{convert|350|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but this requires specially built track. [[Regional rail|Regional]] and [[commuter rail|commuter]] trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity [[tram]]ways and [[rapid transit]]s, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. Freight trains traditionally used [[box car]]s, requiring manual loading and unloading of the [[cargo]]. Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.

===Road===
{{Main|Road transport}}
[[Image:I-80 Eastshore Fwy.jpg|thumb|[[Interstate 80]] near [[Berkeley, California]], United States.]]
A road is an identifiable [[road number|route]], way or [[trail|path]] between two or more [[location (geography)|places]].<ref Name="Major_Roads_of_the_United_States">{{cite web |title=Major Roads of the United States |publisher=United States Department of the Interior | date = 2006-03-13 | url = http://nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref> Roads are typically smoothed, [[pavement (material)|paved]], or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel;<ref Name="RoadInfrastructureStrategicFrameworkforSouthAfrica">{{cite web |title=Road Infrastructure Strategic Framework for South Africa  |publisher=National Department of Transport (South Africa) |date= |url= http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref> though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal [[construction]] or [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].<ref>Lay, 1992: 6<U+2013>7</ref> In [[urban area]]s, roads may pass through a [[city]] or [[village]] and be named as [[street]]s, serving a dual function as urban space [[easement]] and route.<ref name="difference_between_road_and_street">{{cite web | title=What is the difference between a road and a street? |work=Word FAQ |publisher=Lexico Publishing Group |year=2007 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/d01.html |accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref>

The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a [[wheel]]ed passenger vehicle that carries its own [[car engine|motor]]. Other users of roads include [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[motorcycles]], [[bicycles]] and [[pedestrians]]. As of 2002, there were 590 million automobiles worldwide.

Automobiles offer high flexibility and with low capacity, but are deemed with high energy and area use, and the main source of [[noise pollution|noise]] and [[air pollution]] in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 278</ref> Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.

===Water===
{{Main|Ship transport}}
[[Image:Jadrolinija supetar ferry.JPG|thumb|Automobile ferry in [[Croatia]]]]

Water transport is the process of transport a [[watercraft]], such as a [[barge]], [[boat]], [[ship]] or [[sailboat]], makes over a body of water, such as a [[sea]], [[ocean]], [[lake]], [[canal]] or [[river]]. The need for buoyancy unites watercraft, and makes the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.

In the 1800s the first [[steam ships]] were developed, using a [[steam engine]] to drive a [[paddle wheel]] or [[propeller]] to move the ship. The [[steam]] was produced using wood or [[coal]]. Now most ships have an [[engine]] using a slightly refined type of [[petroleum]] called [[bunker fuel]]. Some ships, such as [[submarine]]s, use [[nuclear power]] to produce the steam. [[Recreation]]al or [[education]]al craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use [[internal combustion engine]]s to drive one or more [[propeller]]s, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, [[hovercraft]] are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. 

Although slow, modern sea transport is a highly effective method of transporting large quantities of non-perishable goods. Commercial vessels, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4&nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2007.<ref>[[UNCTAD]] 2007, p. ''x'' and p. 32.</ref> Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental [[shipping]];<ref>Stopford, 1997: 4<U+2013>6</ref> [[short sea shipping]] and [[ferry|ferries]] remain viable in coastal areas.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 8<U+2013>9</ref><ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 280</ref>

===Other===
[[Image:Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Luca Galuzzi 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] for [[crude oil]]]]
[[Pipeline transport]] sends goods through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]], most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but [[pneumatic tube]]s can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for [[sewage]], [[slurry]], [[water]] and [[beer]], while long-distance networks are used for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].

[[Cable transport]] is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by [[cable]]s instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep [[gradient]]. Typical solutions include [[aerial tramway]], [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]] and [[ski lift]]s; some of these are also categorized as [[conveyor transport]].

[[Space transport|Spaceflight]] is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into [[outer space]] by means of a [[spacecraft]]. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System. 

[[Suborbital spaceflight]] is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant other place on Earth. Faster transport could be achieved through part of a [[Low Earth orbit]], or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it.

===Infrastructure===
{{Main|Infrastructure}}

Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of both a way, terminal and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be built up. Air and water craft are able to avoid this, since the [[airway]] and [[seaway]] do not need to be built up. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.

Terminals such as airports, ports and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders to interchange to take advantage of each mode's advantages. For instance, [[airport rail link]]s connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are [[parking lot]]s, while buses and coaches can operates from simple stops.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 275<U+2013>76</ref> For freight, terminals act as [[transshipment]] points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use.

The [[transport finance|financing]] of infrastructure can either be [[government|public]] or [[private enterprise|private]]. Transport is often a [[natural monopoly]] and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through [[taxation]]. New infrastructure projects can involve large spendings, and are often financed through [[debt]]. Many infrastructure owners therefore impose usage fees, such as landing fees at airports, or [[toll plaza]]s on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose [[tax]]es on the purchase or use of vehicles.

===Vehicles===
{{Main|Vehicle}}

A vehicle is any non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Vehicles that do not operate on land, are usually called [[craft (vehicle)|crafts]]. Unless being pulled by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a [[steam engine]], [[combustion engine]], [[electric motor]], a [[jet engine]] or a [[rocket]], though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through [[wheel]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[pressure]].

Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a [[driving|driver]]. However, some systems, such as [[people mover]]s and some rapid transits, are fully [[automation|automated]]. For [[passenger]] transport, the vehicle must have a compartment for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.

===Operation===
[[Image:Incheon International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Incheon International Airport]], South Korea]]

Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through [[private enterprise]] or by [[government]]s. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a [[flag carrier|national airline]] and [[railway company|national railway]]. Since the 1980s, many of these have been [[privatization|privatized]]. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation,<ref>Stopford, 1997: 422</ref> but ports can be public owned.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 29</ref> 

{{clear}}

==Function==
Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical [[military logistics|relocation]] of [[armed force]]s during [[warfare]], or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment.

===Passenger===
<!-- This section is linked from the redirect "Passenger transportation"; if the section title changes, please update the redirect accordingly. -->
{{Main|Travel|Public transit}}

Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into [[public transport|public]] and [[private transport]]. Public is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily [[commuting]], for [[business travel|business]], [[leisure travel|leisure]] or [[human migration|migration]]. 

Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of [[bus]]es in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and rapid transit in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. [[Intermodal passenger transport]] is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a [[transport hub]], such as a [[bus station|bus]] or [[railway station]]. 

Taxis and Buses can be found on both ends of Public Transport spectrum, whereas Buses remain the cheaper mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and Taxis being very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is [[Demand responsive transport]] offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.

[[International travel]] may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements.

===Freight===
{{Main|Shipping}}

Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the [[value chain]] in manufacturing.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 3</ref> With increased specialization and [[globalization]], production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 63<U+2013>64</ref> While all modes of transport are used for [[cargo]] transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 54</ref> [[Logistics]] refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling and packaging, with associated exchange of information.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 4</ref> [[Incoterm]] deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of [[risk]] during transport.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 473</ref>

[[Image:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|[[Freight train]] with [[shipping container]]s in the [[United Kingdom]].]]
[[Containerization]], with the standardization of [[ISO container]]s on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized [[international]] and [[domestic trade]], offering huge reduction in [[transshipment]] costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in [[economy of scale]] in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in [[international trade]] and globalization since the 1950s.<ref name=bcn21114 />

[[Bulk material handling|Bulk transport]] is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are [[ore]], coal, cereals and [[petroleum]]. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.

[[Cargo airline|Air freight]] has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as [[postponement]] and [[just-in-time]] within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 328</ref> In addition to mail, common items send by air include [[electronics]] and [[fashion]] clothing.

==History==
{{Main|History of transport}}
[[Image:Bullock team.jpg|thumb|[[Bullock]] team hauling [[wool]] in [[Australia]]]]

Humans' first means of transport were walking and swimming. The [[domestication]] of animals introduces a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing heavier loads to be hauled, or humans to ride the animals for higher speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of vehicles. Also water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to [[time immemorial]], and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. 

The first forms of [[road transport]] were [[horse]]s, [[ox]]en or even humans carrying goods over [[dirt]] tracks that often followed [[game (food)|game]] [[trail]]s. Paved roads were built by many early civilizations, including [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. The [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath ensured that the roads kept dry. The medieval [[Caliphate]] later built [[Tarmac|tar-paved]] roads. The first watercraft were [[canoe]]s cut out from [[tree trunk]]s. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the [[wind]] for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities, that grew up as sites for trading, being located on rivers or at sea, ofter at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption were located as close to each other as feasible.

[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|The [[Wright Brothers]]' first flight in 1903]]
The [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With [[telegraphy]], communication became instant and independent of transport. The invention of the [[steam engine]], closely followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased rapidly, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independent of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the [[steam ship]], that sped up global transport.

With the development of the [[combustion engine]] and the automobile at the turn into the 20th century, road transport became more viable, allowing the introduction of mechanical private transport. The first highways were constructed during the 19th century with [[macadam]]. Later, [[tarmac]] and [[concrete]] became the dominant paving material. In 1903, the first controllable [[airplane]] was invented, and after World War I, it became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 158</ref>

After World War II, the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger.<ref name=cooper277>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 277</ref> Spaceflight was launched in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled. In the 1950s, the introduction of [[containerization]] gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, permitting [[globalization]].<ref name=bcn21114>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 211<U+2013>14</ref> International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s, with the commercialization of the [[jet engine]]. Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, this introduced a decline for rail and water transport. After the introduction of the [[Shinkansen]] in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started taking passengers on long-haul routes from airlines.<ref name=cooper277 />

Early in [[U.S. history]], most [[aqueducts]], [[bridges]], [[canals]], [[railroads]], [[roads]], and [[tunnels]] were owned by [[privately held company|private]] [[joint-stock]] [[corporations]]. Most such transportation infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the [[nationalization]] of inter-city passenger rail service with the creation of [[Amtrak]]. Recently, however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some ground and adherents.<ref>Clifford Winston, ''Last Exit: Privatization and Deregulation of the U.S. Transportation System'' (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 2010).</ref>

==Impact==
{{Main|sustainable transport}}

===Economic===
[[Image:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in [[Seattle]], United States]]

Transport is a key necessity for [[specialization]]<U+2014>allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations. Transport has throughout history been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more [[trade]] and a greater spread of people. [[Economic growth]] has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 2</ref> But the infrastructure and operation of transport has a great impact on the land and is the largest drainer of energy, making [[transport sustainability]] a major issue.

Modern society dictates a physical distinction between home and work, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work or study, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of [[tourism]], a major part of [[recreation]]al transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed.

===Planning===
{{Main|Transport planning}}

Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of [[transport forecasting]], planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the [[supply chain]]. Transport as a field is studied through [[transport economics]], the backbone for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. [[Transport engineering]], a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]], and must take into account [[trip generation]], [[trip distribution]], [[mode choice]] and [[route assignment]], while the operative level is handles through [[traffic engineering]]. 

[[Image:Roundabout.bristol.arp.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]
Because of the negative impacts made, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a [[tragedy of the commons]], where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. [[land use|Density of development]] depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spacial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to peoples homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs; minimize the need for transport. There are [[economies of agglomeration]]. Beyond transportation some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transportation facilities consume land, and in cities, pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.

Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput means that in many cities there is too much traffic and many<U+2014>if not all<U+2014>of the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places, and as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on<U+2014>spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociologists as well as economists who increasingly are questioning the viability of the old mobility solutions. European cities are leading this transition.

{{Main|Transport and the environment}}

Transport is a major use of [[energy (society)|energy]], and burns most of the world's [[petroleum]]. This creates [[air pollution]], including [[nitrous oxide]]s and [[particulate]]s, and is a significant contributor to [[global warming]] through emission of [[carbon dioxide]],<ref name = "pnas_pdf">{{cite web |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0702958104v1.pdf |title=Climate forcing from the transport sectors |author=Fuglestvet et al., [[Center for International Climate and Environmental Research]] |year=2007}}</ref> for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5579 |title=Analysis: Nano Hypocrisy? |author=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |date=16 January 2008}}</ref> By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0702958104v1.pdf PNAS.org]</ref> [[Environmental regulation]]s in developed countries have reduced the individual vehicles emission; however, this has been offset by an increase in the number of vehicles, and more use of each vehicle.<ref name="pnas_pdf" /> Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-pathways-analysis-informing-development-of-a-carbon-reduction-strategy-for-the-transport-sector.html |title=Claverton-Energy.com |publisher=Claverton-Energy.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref><ref>Data on the barriers and motivators to more sustainable transport behaviour is available in the UK Department for Transport study "[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/scienceresearch/social/climatechangetransportchoices/ Climate Change and Transport Choices]" published in December 2010.</ref> Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, and increase [[transport electrification]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

Other environmental impacts of transport systems include [[traffic congestion]] and automobile-oriented [[urban sprawl]], which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transportation emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's [[air quality]], [[acid rain]], [[smog]] and climate change.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Transportation-WS800CCAF9-1_En.htm |title=Transportation |author=[[Environment Canada]] |accessdate=30 July 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
