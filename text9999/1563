'''''Eazy-Duz-It'''''  is the debut album of [[rapping|rapper]] [[Eazy-E]], released on September 16, 1988 through both [[Ruthless Records|Ruthless]] and [[Priority Records]]. The [[record producer|production]] by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[DJ Yella]] was deemed dense and funky by critic Jason Birchmeier.<ref name="allmusic"/> The pieces were written primarily by [[Eazy-E]], [[MC Ren]], [[Ice Cube]], and [[The D.O.C.]]. The album's title track features Eazy rapping about himself and things that he does. "Boyz n the Hood" and "No More ?'s" are about life in [[Compton, California]] and the gangster lifestyle.

The album charted on two different charts and went double platinum (2,000,000 sales) in mid-1992, despite minimal promotion by radio and television. Three of the four [[single (music)|singles]] released from the album in the United States (US). Critical reception on ''Eazy-Duz-It'' was generally positive, with Jason Birchmeier rewarding the album four out of five stars, and [[Robert Christgau]] giving it a C+.

==Recording and production==
''Eazy-Duz-It'' was recorded at Audio Achievements, in [[Torrance, California]] from 1987 to 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/dr-dre-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Artists: Dr. Dre &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Lists |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date= |accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref> The album's writing was a three-pronged effort involving [[Eazy-E]], [[MC Ren]], [[Ice Cube]], and [[The D.O.C.]]. MC Ren's writing style was described by Marcus Reeves, author of ''[[Special:BookSources/9780865479975|Somebody Scream!: Rap Music's Rise to Prominence in the Aftershock of Black Power]]'' (2009), as "elaborate storytelling and acrobatic verbiage", while the D.O.C.'s  included "syllabically punchy boasts" and Ice Cube wrote "masterfully insightful first-person narratives." Ice Cube's writing was often inspired by [[Comedian|comedians]] like [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Rudy Ray Moore]].<ref>McDermott, Terry (2002-04-14). [http://articles.latimes.com/2002/apr/14/magazine/tm-37890/10 "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

The album's [[record producer|production]], almost solely done by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[DJ Yella]], was praised by several critics. Jason Birchmeier from [[Allmusic]] gave a considerable amount of note to the album's production, saying that "Dr. Dre and Yella meld together [[P-Funk]], [[Def Jam]]-style [[hip hop]], and the leftover electro sounds of mid-'80s Los Angeles, creating a dense, funky, and thoroughly unique style of their own."<ref name="allmusic"/> Birchmeier would also write that some songs<U+2014>"Eazy Duz It", "We Want Eazy", "Eazy-er Said Than Dunn", and "Radio"<U+2014>are all heavily produced and have "layers upon layers of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] and [[Beat (music)|beats]] competing with Eazy-E's rhymes for attention."<ref name="allmusic"/> [[Rapper]] [[Kanye West]] also touted Dr. Dre's production on the album.<ref>[[Kanye West|West, Kanye]].

==Composition==
Glen Boyd of [[Blogcritics]] said that the album has "Deep-ass bass lines, old-school funk samples, and plenty of street smart ghetto attitude are what powers this record."<ref name="Seattle Post-Intelligencer"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/writers/glen-boyd/ |title=Glen Boyd Writer Profile |publisher=Blogcritics |date= |accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref> Jerry Heller wrote that Eazy raps more up front on the album then he does on ''Straight Outta Compton'', and insists that the album's lyrics contain more sexual humor than gangsta vibe.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ruthless: A Memoir|year=2007|publisher=Gallery|isbn=9781416917946|author=[[Jerry Heller{{!}}Heller, Jerry]]|coauthors=[[Gil Reavill{{!}}Reavill, Gil]]|page=121}}</ref> 

The album's title track, "Eazy-Duz-It", opens with a little girl acclaiming Eazy-E's style. Eazy then interrupts saying "Bitch shut the fuck up, get the fuck outta here."  This is followed by a bass line provided by [[Dr. Dre]]. Soon, Eazy begins to rap about himself and things that he does. The song declares that Eazy is a "hardcore villain" who collects money from his [[Prostitution|prostitutes]], and feels great when his "pockets are fat."<ref name="Words of Ice Cube"/> The chorus, repeated three times, states that he "is a gangsta having fun". The piece is laden with the aural mainstays of gangsta rap, including gunshots, and references to several [[drugs]].<ref name="Words of Ice Cube">{{cite book|last=Woldu |first=Gail Hilson|title=The Words and Music of Ice Cube|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780275990435|edition=1|pages=20-21|format=Hardcover|chapter=Eazy Duz It<U+2014>Again and Again|date=2010-10-30}}</ref> 

"Boyz n the Hood" was written solely by Ice Cube. The song is about growing up in Compton, California, and describes the gangster lifestyle. It conceives the "ghetto landscape as a generalized abstract construct<U+2026>  [and] also introduces a localized nuance that conveys a certain proximity, effectively capturing a narrowed sence of place through which young thugs and their potential crime victims move in tandem," as put by cultural historian Murray Forman.<ref name="Words of Ice Cube"/> 

"No More ?'s" is similar to "Boyz n the Hood" in it's theme. The piece begins with an interview between Eazy and a female journalist, who asks about his childhood. Eazy explains (in verse) that he was ruthless, in a gang, "specialized in gankin," (loosely, to steal from) and had no respect for rules. He is then asked if he has ever been in an [[armed robbery]]. He responds "you mean a 211?". The following verses tell of Eazy's exploits as a thief and thug.<ref name="Words of Ice Cube"/>

==Reception==
===Commercial performance===
The album received little attention from radio and television stations, but got support from [[Los Angeles]]'s hip-hop underground.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reeves|first=Marcus|title=Somebody Scream!: Rap Music's Rise to Prominence in the Aftershock of Black Power|year=2009|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|location=18 West 18th Street, New York 10011|isbn=9780865479975|edition=1|page=101|format=Paperback|chapter=Niggas Selling Attitude|quote=''Eazy-Duz-It'' went gold with much support from L.A.'s hip-hop underground but little radio of video promotion.}}</ref>  On May 20, 1989, it peaked at number 41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and since 1989, was in various places on the chart for 90 weeks.

===Critical response===
[[Allmusic]]'s Jason Birchmeier praised the album, rewarding the album four out of five stars. Birchmeier noted that "the album plays like a humorous, self-centered twist on Straight Outta Compton with Eazy-E, the most charismatic member of N.W.A, front and center while his associates are busy behind the scenes, producing the beats and writing the songs."<ref name="allmusic"/> He compared it to [[N.W.A]]'s ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', which Eazy also performs on, saying that ''Straight Outta Compton'' is "more revolutionary," but claimed ''Eazy-Duz-It'' to be ''Straight Outta Compton''{{'}}s "great companion" and to have showcased N.W.A's style.<ref name="allmusic">Birchmeier, Jason.
