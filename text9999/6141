Rabbi '''Zadok HaKohen Rabinowitz''' of Lublin (Kreisburg, 1823- Lublin, Poland, 1900), also spelled  Tzadok Hacohen, and Tzadok Hakohen.

(Not to be confused with [[Zadoc Kahn]] 1839-1905)


==Biography==
He was born into a Lithuanian Rabbinic family and then became a follower of the Hasidic Rebbe, Rabbi [[Mordechai Yosef Leiner]] of Izbica, and a close friend of Yehudah Leib Eiger, another student of Mordechai Leiner. He is a classic example of a [[Litvish]] Jew turned [[Chasidic]].
As a young man he gained widespread acclaim as an illuy, a brilliant talmudist. Rabbi Zadok refused to accept any rabbinic post for most of his life. He eked out a living by his wife running a small used clothing store. Upon the death of Eiger in 1888, Zadok Hakohen agreed to take over the leadership of the [[Hasidim]]. It was then that he began to give his public classes that would take place on Shabbat, Holidays, Rosh  Chodesh and special occasions. It is the transcription of those classes were compiled into his work known as ''Pri Tzadik''.
Rabbi Zadok was a prolific writer in all areas of Judaism, [[halakhah]], Hasidut, [[Kabbalah]], angelology, ethics, he also wrote scholarly essays on astronomy, geometry, and algebra.

One of his lone surviving students was Rabbi Michael Mokotovsky, whose son was Rabbi Avraham Eliyahu Mokotovsky, better known by his penname [[Eliyahu Kitov]],

==Ideas==
Zadok HaKohen's radical philosophy of Judaism very much continues the thinking of his teacher Rabbi [[Mordechai Yosef Leiner]]. Zadok HaKohen was much more of a prolific writer than Leiner ever was. It is therefore difficult to determine where R' Zadok's radicalism is a mere articulation of ideas left somewhat veiled (albeit possibly purposely) in the writings of Leiner and where R' Zadok is actually breaking new ground.

===''Takkant Hashavim''===
Zadok HaKohen said that the Oral Law developed to its full potential after the victory of the [[Hasmoneans]] over the Greek culture, a culture characterized by deep analysis and hair-splitting argument. These virtues were converted to a holy nature with the victory of Israel over Greece. This was the fulfillment of the verse <U+201C>God will give beauty to Yefet and this beauty will dwell in the tents of Shem<U+201D> (as per Megillah 9b).  After the victory, Jews could begin the successful integration of science, logic and philosophy into our natural world, into the world of the Written Law. Only then could the Oral Law truly begin to flourish. 

===''Pri Zaddik'', Genesis===
Humanity's first sin was not Adam and Eve's eating of forbidden fruit, but rather the way they ate it. The Tree of Knowledge, says he, was not a tree or a food or a thing at all. Rather it was a way of eating. Whenever a person grabs self-conscious pleasure from the world, he falls, at that moment, from God consciousness, and eats from the Tree of Knowledge. 

===''Tzidkat Hatzaddik''===
You can learn a lot about a person from his dreams. What we dream is a reflection of who we are. It is the measure of our aspirations and goals, and of those values we hold dear and place above all else.

===''Tzidkat Hazadik''===
One does not squelch the evil inclination but rather helps channel its energies positively. 

===Homosexuality===
Zadock HaKohen believed that homosexuality could not be helped, thus homosexual Jews could not be punished for their deeds.<ref>[[Journal of Homosexuality]], volume 52, issue 3/4, ''Gay, Orthodox, and Trembling: The Rise of Jewish Orthodox Gay Consciousness, 1970s-2000s'', by Yaakov Ariel</ref>
