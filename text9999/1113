The '''M50''' is a [[motorway]] in [[Gloucestershire]], [[Worcestershire]] and [[Herefordshire]], [[England]].  It is 21 [[Mile|miles]] (34 [[km]]) long and is sometimes referred to as the ''Ross Spur''.
 
==Route==
The M50 runs in a south westerly/north easterly direction between the [[M5 motorway]] just north of [[Tewkesbury]] and the [[A40 road]] and [[A449 road]] at [[Ross-on-Wye]]. After leaving the M5 at junction 8 it passes north of Tewkesbury and then south of [[Ledbury]].  Between Junctions 1 & 2 it crosses the [[River Severn]] on the [[Queenhill Bridge]], which also covers the associated [[flood plain]].  After passing north of [[Newent]] the motorway reaches its terminus at Junction 4.

==History==
The M50 was built by [[Tarmac Construction]] between [[1958]] and [[1962]]<ref>[http://www.iht.org/motorway/m50rossstat.htm The Motorway Archive - M50 dates page]</ref>:
*Junctions 1 to 4 opened in [[1960]].
*M5 to Junction 1 opened in 1962.

The route was part of a strategic route from [[Midlands|The Midlands]] to [[South Wales]] and so was constructed as an early priority<ref>[http://www.iht.org/motorway/m50rossspur.htm The Motorway Archive - M50 Scheme Page]</ref>. It is one of the few British motorways not to have been widened, retaining its original layout of only two lanes in each direction.

In [[2007 United Kingdom floods|July 2007]], the road was closed by [[flooding]] at Junction 2.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/herefordandworcester/content/image_galleries/flash_floods_gallery.shtml?10 M50 flooding: BBC photo]</ref>

===Services===
Although not served directly by motorway service areas the M50 is served by a service area at [[Strensham services]] operated by [[RoadChef]] just north of the M50's north eastern terminus junction with junction 8 of the M5. Also at the other end of the M50 on the [[A449 road]] near to the junction 4 south western terminus of the M50 there was a service area operated by [[Welcome Break]] called [[Ross Spur services]], however recently this has closed and only the southwest bound [[BP]] garage remains open.

===Descriptions===
The junction with the M5 was originally a free-flowing trumpet-style junction <ref>[http://euclid.colorado.edu/~rmg/roads/m50.html Major Roads of Great Britain] Narrative description of the route</ref>, but was converted to a [[roundabout]] when the M5 was widened in the [[1990s]]<ref>[http://www.iht.org/motorway/m5widening.htm The Motorway Archive - M5 Widening]</ref>.  Junction 1, where the M50 meets with the A38, is a [[parclo|Partial Cloverleaf]]. Junctions 2 and 3 have 90 degree turns from the deceleration lane into the slip roads which is hazardous for high-speed driving.
