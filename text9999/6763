'''Bruce Castle''' (formerly the Lordship House) is a [[Listed building|Grade I listed]] 16th-century<ref>Sources differ as to the date of construction; some date the current building to the 15th century, but most agree that the house dates from the 16th century, although there is no consensus as to the exact date.</ref> [[manor house]] in [[Lordship Lane (Haringey)|Lordship Lane]], [[Tottenham]], [[London]]. It is named after the [[House of Bruce]] who formerly owned the land on which it is built. Believed to lie on the site of an earlier building, about which little is known, the current house is one of the oldest surviving English [[brick]] houses. It was remodelled in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.

The house has been home to [[William Compton (courtier)|Sir William Compton]], [[Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset]], the [[Baron Coleraine#Barons Coleraine, First Creation (1625)|Barons Coleraine]] and [[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Sir Rowland Hill]], among others. After serving as a school during the 19th century, when a large extension was built to the west, it was converted into a museum exploring the history of the areas which constitute the present [[London Borough of Haringey]] and, on the strength of its connection with Sir Rowland Hill, the history of the [[Royal Mail]]. The building also houses the archives of the London Borough of Haringey. Since 1892 the grounds have been a public park, Tottenham's oldest.

==Origins of the name==
[[Image:Lordship House, Tottenham 1619.jpg|right|thumb|The earliest known depiction of the house: detail of the 1619 [[:Image:1619 Tottenham map (full).jpg|Earl of Dorset's Survey of Tottenham]]. The Norman [[Tottenham#Sites or buildings of historical interest|All Hallows Church]] and priory, then as now the oldest surviving buildings in the area, are also shown.<ref>As with most other English maps of the period, the map is aligned with south at the top (i.e. "upside down" when compared to modern maps). The alignment of streets in the area is preserved today; the road running east-west is the present day Lordship Lane, and the road running north-south past the church is the present day Church Lane; [[Bruce Grove]] does not yet exist, but its eventual route can be seen in the field boundaries running diagonally immediately south of the castle. The large field opposite the house (marked "Lease") is the northeast corner of the water-meadow which became [[Broadwater Farm]]. The fields to the east of Church Lane are the present Bruce Castle Park, while those to the west surrounding the church now form part of [[Tottenham#Sites or buildings of historical interest|Tottenham Cemetery]].</ref>]] 

The name ''Bruce Castle'' is derived from the [[House of Bruce]], who had historically owned a third of the [[manorialism|manor]] of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area, and it is unlikely that the family lived nearby.<ref name="Pegram2">Pegram 1987, p. 2</ref> Upon his accession to [[King of Scots|the Scottish throne]] in 1306, [[Robert I of Scotland]] forfeited his lands in England, including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham,<ref name="Pegram2" /> ending the connection between the Bruce family and the area. The former Bruce land in Tottenham was granted to [[Richard Spigurnell]] and [[Thomas Hethe]].<ref name="Lysons">{{citation|last=Lysons|first=Daniel|date=1795|journal=The Environs of London|location=London|volume=3|pages=517<U+2013>557|title=Tottenham|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45450|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>

The three parts of the manor of Tottenham were united in the early 15th century under the Gedeney family and have remained united since.<ref name="Lysons" /> In all early records, the building is referred to as the ''Lordship House''. The name ''Bruce Castle'' first appears to have been adopted by [[Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine]] (1635<U+2013>1708),<ref name="Pegram2" /> although Daniel Lysons speculates in ''The Environs of London'' (1795) that the usage of the name dates to the late 13th century.<ref name="Lysons"/>

==Architecture==
[[Image:Tottenham,Bruce Castle, Tower.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The round tower]]
A detached,  cylindrical [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] tower stands immediately to the southeast of the house, and is generally considered to be the earliest part of the building;<ref name="Pegram3">Pegram 1987, p. 3</ref> however, Lysons believes it to have been a later addition.<ref name="Lysons" /> The tower is built of local red brick, and is {{convert|21|ft|m}} tall, with walls {{convert|3|ft|m}} thick. The purpose of the tower is unknown, but speculation suggests it might have been a [[dovecote]].<ref name="Pegram3" /> In 2006, excavations revealed that the tower continues for some distance below the current ground level.<ref name="2006dig">{{citation|url=http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/English/ComLearn/ComExcav/BruceCastle.htm|title=Bruce Castle Park community excavation, 2006 |date=2006|publisher=Museum of London|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>

Sources disagree on the house's initial construction date, and no records survive of its construction. There is some archaeological evidence dating parts of the building to the 15th century;<ref name="Pegram3" /> William Robinson's  ''History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham'' (1840) suggests a date of about 1514,<ref name="robinson">Robinson 1840, p. 216</ref> although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late 16th century. [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] speculates that the front may have formed part of a [[courtyard house]] of which the remainder has disappeared.<ref name="Pevsner584">Cherry and Pevsner 1998, p. 584</ref>

The principal facade of the Grade I mansion has been substantially remodelled over time. The house is constructed of red brick with [[ashlar]] [[Quoin (architecture)|quoin]]ing and the principal facade, terminated by symmetrical matching bays, has tall paned windows. The house and detached tower are among the earliest uses of brick as the principal building material for an English house.<ref name="Pevsner11">Cherry and Pevsner 1998, p. 11</ref> 

[[Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine]] (1635<U+2013>1708) oversaw a substantial remodelling of the house in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and [[pilasters]], a [[Baluster|balustraded]] top and a small tower and [[cupola]].<ref name="Pevsner584" /> A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the centre of the house, with service rooms to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's chamber over the porch.<ref name="Pevsner584" /> 

In the early 18th century [[Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine]] (1694<U+2013>1749) oversaw a remodelling of the north of the house, in which an extra range of rooms was added to the north and a large crest of the Coleraine arms added to the pediment of the north facade.<ref name="Pevsner584" /> In the late 18th century, under the ownership of [[James Townsend]], the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house. At the same time, the gabled attics on the south front were removed, giving the southern elevation of the house its current appearance.<ref name="Pevsner584" /> An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground floor, with a library and billiard room on the first floor.<ref name="Pevsner584" />

In the early 19th century the west wing of the house was demolished, leaving it with the asymmetrical appearance that it retains today.<ref name="Pegram9">Pegram 1987, p. 9</ref> The house was converted into a school, and in 1870 a three-story extension was built in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style to the northwest of the house.<ref name="Pevsner584" />

The 2006 excavations by the [[Museum of London]] uncovered the chalk foundations of an earlier building on the site, of which nothing is currently known.<ref name="2006dig" /> [[Pipe Rolls|Court rolls]] of 1742 refer to the repair of a [[drawbridge]], implying that the building then had a [[moat]].<ref name="Pegram3" /> A 1911 archaeological journal made passing reference to "the recent levelling of the moat".<ref>{{citation|last=Page|first=William|year=1911|title=Ancient Earthworks|journal=A History of the County of Middlesex|volume=2|pages=1<U+2013>14|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22152|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>

==Early residents==
It is generally believed that the first owner of the house was [[William Compton (courtier)|Sir William Compton]], [[Groom of the Stool]] to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and one of the most prominent courtiers of the period, who acquired the manor of Tottenham in 1514.<ref name="Pegram3" /> However, there is no recorded evidence of Compton's living in the house, and there is some evidence that the current building dates to a later period.<ref name="Pegram3" />

The earliest known reference to the building dates from 1516, when Henry VIII met his sister [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret, Queen of Scots]], at "Maister Compton's House beside Tottenham".<ref name="robinson" /> The Comptons owned the building throughout the 16th century, but few records of the family or the building survive from the period.<ref name="Pegram4">Pegram 1987, p. 4</ref>

[[Image:Richard Sackville Earl of Dorset.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Richard Sackville, by [[William Larkin]].<ref>An added inscription on this painting misidentifies the sitter as [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset|Edward Sackville]], Richard's younger brother, later 4th Earl of Dorset.

ISBN 0-8478-1940-X, pp. 198<U+2013>199</ref> Sackville's large debts led to the sale of the house to [[Hugh Hare, 1st Baron Coleraine|Hugh Hare]].]]
In the early 17th century the house was owned by [[Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset]] and [[Lady Anne Clifford]]. Sackville ran up high debts through gambling and extravagant spending; the house (then still called "The Lordship House") was leased to [[Sir Thomas Peniston|Thomas Peniston]]. Peniston's wife, Martha, daughter of [[Sir Thomas Temple, 1st Baronet, of Stowe|Sir Thomas Temple]] was said to be the Earl of Dorset's mistress.<ref>Clifford 1990, p. 83</ref> The house was later sold to wealthy [[Norfolk]] landowner [[Hugh Hare, 1st Baron Coleraine|Hugh Hare]].<ref name="Pegram5">Pegram 1987, p. 5</ref>

==17th century: the Hare family==
===Hugh Hare, 1st Baron Coleraine===
Hugh Hare (1606<U+2013>1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle [[Nicholas Hare|Sir Nicholas Hare]], [[Master of the Rolls]]. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried [[Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester]], allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in [[Noble court|Court]] and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as [[Baron Coleraine]] shortly thereafter.<ref name="Pegram5" />

Being closely associated with the court of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], Hare's fortunes went into decline during the [[English Civil War]]. His [[Longford Castle|castle at Longford]] and his house in [[Totteridge]] were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in a severe state of disrepair.<ref name="Pegram5" /> Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the [[Commonwealth of England]] are unknown.<ref name="Pegram5" /> Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating [[Domestic turkey|turkey]] whilst laughing and drinking,<ref name="Pegram5" /> and was succeeded by his son [[Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine]]. 

===Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine===
Henry Hare (1635<U+2013>1708) settled at the Lordship House, renaming it Bruce Castle in honour of the area's historic connection with the [[House of Bruce]].<ref name="Pegram2" /> Hare was a noted historian and author of the first history of Tottenham. He grew up at the Hare family house at Totteridge, and it is not known when he moved to Tottenham. At the time of the birth of his first child, Hugh, in 1668, the family were still living in Totteridge, while by the time of the death of his first wife Constantia, in 1680, the family were living in Bruce Castle. According to Hare, Constantia was buried in [[Tottenham#Sites or buildings of historical interest|All Hallows Church]] in Tottenham. However, the [[parish register]] for the period is complete and makes no mention of her death or burial.<ref name="Pegram6">Pegram 1987, p. 6</ref> 

[[File:Early facade of Bruce Castle.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bruce Castle in the late 17th century, following Hare's alterations]]
Following the death of Constantia, Hare married Sarah Alston. They had been engaged in 1661, but she had instead married [[John Seymour, 4th Duke of Somerset]]. There is evidence that during Sarah's marriage to Seymour and Hare's marriage to Constantia, a close relationship was sustained between them.<ref name="Pegram7">Pegram 1987, p. 7</ref>

The house was substantially remodelled in 1684, following Henry Hare's marriage to the dowager Duchess of Somerset, and much of the existing south facade dates from this time.<ref name="Pevsner584" /> The facade's dominating feature is a central tower with a [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]], a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] of the English [[Renaissance]] of the late 16th/early 17th centuries (the Compton family's [[Warwickshire]] home [[Castle Ashby]] was also given Renaissance features during the 17th century). [[Hatfield House]], also close to London, had a similar central tower constructed in 1611, as does [[Blickling Hall]] in Norfolk, built circa 1616. However, in resemblance the house appears to favour the style of [[Burton Agnes Hall]] constructed between 1601 and 1610. 

====The Ghostly Lady of Bruce Castle====
Although sources such as Pegram speculate that Constantia committed suicide in the face of a continued relationship between Hare and the Duchess of Somerset,<ref name="Pegram7" /> little is known about her life and the circumstances of her early death, and her [[ghost]] reputedly haunts the castle.<ref name="Underwood">Underwood 1992, pp. 46<U+2013>147</ref> [[Image:Bruce Castle Park.JPG|thumb|right|The grounds of Bruce Castle, now a public park]] 

The earliest recorded reference to the ghost appeared in 1858 <U+2013> almost two hundred years after her death <U+2013> in the ''Tottenham & Edmonton Advertiser''. 
{{quote|A lady of our acquaintance was introduced at a party to an Indian Officer who, hearing that she came from Tottenham, eagerly asked if she had seen the Ghostly Lady of Bruce Castle. Some years before he had been told the following story by a brother officer when encamped on a march in India. One of the Lords Coleraine had married a beautiful lady and while she was yet in her youth had been seized with a violent hatred against her <U+2013> whether from jealousy or not is not known. He first confined her to the upper part of the house and subsequently still more closely to the little rooms of the clock turret. These rooms looked on the balconies: the lady one night succeeded in forcing her way out and flung herself with child in arms from the parapet. The wild despairing shriek aroused the household only to find her and her infant in death's clutches below. Every year as the fearful night comes round (it is in November) the wild form can be seen as she stood on the fatal parapet, and her despairing cry is heard floating away on the autumnal blast.<ref name="Pegram6" /><ref>{{citation|title=The Ghostly Lady of Bruce Castle|journal=Tottenham & Edmonton Advertiser|issue=March 1858}}</ref>}}
The legend has now been largely forgotten, and there have been no reported sightings of the ghost in recent times.<ref name="Underwood" />

==Residents in the 18th century==
[[Image:Bruce Castle north elevation.JPG|left|thumb|North elevation, showing the Coleraine crest on the north pediment]]
Sarah Hare died in 1692 and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]],<ref name="Pegram7" /> and Hare in 1708, to be succeeded by his grandson [[Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine]]. Henry Hare was a leading [[antiquary]], residing only briefly at Bruce Castle between lengthy tours of Europe. 

The house was remodelled again under the 3rd Baron Coleraine's ownership. An extra range of rooms was added to the north, and the pediment of the north front ornamented with a large crest of the Coleraine arms.<ref name="Pevsner584" />

Hare's marriage was not consummated, and following an affair with a French woman, Rosa du Plessis, du Plessis bore him his only child, a daughter named Henrietta Rosa Peregrina, born in France in 1745.<ref name="Pegram8">Pegram 1987, p. 8</ref> Hare died in 1749 leaving his estates to the four-year-old Henrietta, but her claim was rejected due to her French nationality. After many years of legal challenges, the estates, including Bruce Castle, were granted to her husband [[James Townsend]], whom she had married at age 18.<ref name="Pegram8" /> 

[[File:Bruce Castle east side.JPG|right|thumb|James Townsend remodelled the east facade to have the appearance of a typical Georgian house.]]
James Townsend was a leading citizen of the day. He served as a [[magistrate]], was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[West Looe (UK Parliament constituency)|West Looe]], and in 1772 became [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor of London]], whilst Henrietta was a prominent artist, many of whose [[engraving]]s of 18th century Tottenham survive in the Bruce Castle Museum.<ref name="Pegram8" />

After 1764, under the ownership of James Townsend, the house was remodelled again. The narrow east front was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house, while the gabled attics on the south front were removed, giving the south facade the appearance it has today.<ref name="Pevsner584" />

James and Henrietta Townsend's son, Henry Hare Townsend, showed little interest in the area or in the traditional role of the [[Lord of the Manor]]. After leasing the house to a succession of tenants, the house and grounds were sold in 1792 to Thomas Smith of [[Gray's Inn]] as a country residence.<ref name="Pegram8" />

==John Eardley Wilmot==
[[John Wilmot (MP)|John Eardley Wilmot]] (c.&nbsp;1749 <U+2013> 23 June 1815) was Member of Parliament for [[Tiverton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tiverton]] (1776<U+2013>1784) and [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]] (1784<U+2013>1796), and in 1783 led the Parliamentary Commission investigating the events that had led to the [[American Revolution]]. He also led the processing of compensation claims, and the supply of basic housing and provisions, for the 60,000&nbsp;[[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugees who arrived in England in the aftermath of the independence of the [[United States]].<ref name="Pegram9" />

Following the beginning of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, a second wave of refugees arrived in England. Although the British government on this occasion did not offer organised relief to refugees, Wilmot, in association with [[William Wilberforce]], [[Edmund Burke]] and [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham]], founded "Wilmot's Committee", which raised funds to provide accommodation and food, and found employment for refugees from France, large numbers of whom settled in the Tottenham area.<ref name="Pegram9" />

In 1804, Wilmot retired from public life and moved to Bruce Castle to write his memoirs of the American Revolution, and his role in the investigations of its causes and consequences. They were published shortly before his death in 1815.<ref name="Pegram9" />

After Wilmot's death London merchant John Ede purchased the house and its grounds, and demolished the building's west wing.<ref name="Pegram9" /> It was never rebuilt, resulting in the current skewed shape of the building. In 1827, Ede sold the house and grounds to [[Worcestershire]] educationalist [[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Rowland Hill]], for use as a school.

==The Hill School==
[[Image:Rowland Hill - Project Gutenberg etext 13103.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Sir Rowland Hill]]]]
Hill and his brothers had taken over the management of their father's school in [[Birmingham]] in 1819, which moved to Bruce Castle in 1827 with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] lines inspired by Hill's friends [[Thomas Paine]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]];<ref>{{citation|title=Joseph Priestley and his Influence on Education in Birmingham |publisher=[http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/default.asp?resource=4276 Revolutionary Players of Industry and Innovation] |last=Dick |first=Malcolm |year=2004 |url = http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/88/83/366.doc |format = {{DOClink|65&nbsp;KB}} |accessdate = 2009-03-16}}</ref> all teaching was on the principle that the role of the teacher is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering.<ref name="Pegram10">Pegram 1987, p. 10</ref><ref>A printing press designed by Rowland Hill and built by pupils of the school is on display at London's [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]. At this time, school curricula were almost always restricted to the classics; for a school to include engineering in the curriculum was almost unique.</ref> Amongst other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of [[South America]], and the sons of computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]].<ref name="Pegram10" />

In 1839 Rowland Hill, who had written an influential proposal on postal reform, was appointed as head of the [[General Post Office]] (where he introduced the world's first [[postage stamp]]s), leaving the school in the hands of his younger brother Arthur Hill.<ref name="Pegram10" /> Arthur retired in 1868, leaving the school in the hands of his son [[George Birkbeck Norman Hill|Birkbeck Hill]]. 

[[Image:Bruce Castle extension.JPG|left|thumb|upright|19th-century extension to house the school]]
During the period of the School's operation, the character of the area had changed beyond recognition. Historically, Tottenham had consisted of four villages on [[Ermine Street]] (later the [[A10 road (England)|A10 road]]), surrounded by marshland and farmland.<ref name="Middx">{{citation| title =Tottenham Growth after 1850  | journal =A History of the County of Middlesex  | volume =5  | pages =317<U+2013>324  | publisher =Victoria County History  | date =1976  | url =http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26986  | accessdate =2007-06-06  }}</ref> The construction of the [[Northern and Eastern Railway]] in 1840, with stations at [[Tottenham Hale station|Tottenham Hale]] and [[Northumberland Park railway station|Marsh Lane]] (later Northumberland Park), made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time (albeit by a circuitous eight-mile route via [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], more than double the distance of the direct road route), as well as providing direct connections to the [[Port of London]].<ref>Lake 1945, pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref> In 1872 the [[Great Eastern Railway]] opened a direct line from [[Enfield Town railway station|Enfield]] to [[Liverpool Street station]],<ref>Lake 1945, p. 22</ref> including a station at [[Bruce Grove railway station|Bruce Grove]], close to Bruce Castle;<ref>Connor 2004, <U+00A7> 54</ref> the railway provided subsidised workmen's fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London.<ref>Olsen 1976, p. 290</ref> As a major rail hub, Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area; by the end of the 19th century, the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle itself, and the waterlogged floodplains of the [[River Lee (England)|River Lee]] at [[Tottenham Marshes]] and of the [[River Moselle (London)|River Moselle]] at [[Broadwater Farm]].<ref name="Middx" />

In 1877 Birkbeck Hill retired from the post of headmaster, ending his family's association with the school. The school closed in 1891, and [[Municipal Borough of Tottenham|Tottenham Council]] purchased the house and grounds. The grounds of the house were opened to the public as Bruce Castle Park in June 1892,<ref name="Pevsner57">Cherry and Pevsner 1998, p. 57</ref> the first public park in Tottenham.<ref name="homepage">{{citation|url=http://www.haringey.gov.uk/leisure/brucecastlemuseum.htm#about|title=Bruce Castle Museum|publisher=London Borough of Haringey|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> The house opened to the public as Bruce Castle Museum in 1906.<ref name="Pegram11">Pegram 1987, p. 11</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/X20L/Boroughs/haringey.htm|title=Haringey|publisher=Museum of London|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>
