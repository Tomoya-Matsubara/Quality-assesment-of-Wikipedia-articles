'''''There's a Riot Goin' On''''' is the fifth [[studio album]] by American [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] band [[Sly & the Family Stone]], released November 20, 1971 on [[Epic Records]].

==Conception==
Following the massive acclaim of their previous LP, 1969's ''[[Stand!]]'', and the new found fame it engendered, Sly & the Family Stone were due to have submitted an album of new recordings to [[Epic Records]] in 1970. However, creative head of the group and multi-instrumentalist [[Sly Stone]] missed several recording deadlines, worrying [[Columbia Records|CBS]] executive [[Clive Davis]].<ref name=selvin98> Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 107, 146<U+2013>152</ref> The band's ''[[Greatest Hits (Sly & the Family Stone album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album had been released in the midst of an eighteen-month stretch from late 1969 to late 1971, during which the band released no new material. With the its newfound fame and success came other problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating, as there was friction between the Stone brothers, Sly and [[Freddie Stone|Freddie]], and bassist [[Larry Graham]].<ref name=selvin98/> Epic requested more product.<ref name="Kaliss">Kaliss, Jeff.

After moving to the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] area in fall 1969, Sly Stone and his bandmates became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily [[cocaine]] and [[phencyclidine|PCP]].<ref name=selvin94>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 94<U+2013>98</ref> As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Sly Stone carried a [[violin]] case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went), recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, "[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]" / "[[Everybody Is a Star]]", released in December 1969.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 122</ref> Although "Star" was another positive-message song in the vein of their hit "[[Everyday People (song)|Everyday People]]", the single's lead side featured a more bitter theme by Stone, who declared that he could no longer pretend to be something they were not (peaceful, loving, and happy) and disrespectfully thanked the audience "for letting me be myself again."<ref> Hoskyns, Barney (2006-03-26).

By 1970, Sly Stone had become erratic and moody, missing nearly a third of the band's concert dates and spending most of his time using drugs.<ref name=MTVNews>{{cite news| last=Aswad| first=Jem| date=2006-02-10 | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524032/20060209/story.jhtml | title= Who, Exactly, Is Sly Stone?

Brown as his personal managers, whom after which enlisted [[gangster]]s Edward "Eddie Chin" Elliott and [[Mafia|Mafioso]] J.R. Valtrano as Sly's bodyguards. In addition, Stone assigned these individuals to handle his business dealings, to retrieve drugs, and to protect him from those he considered as enemies, some of whom were his own bandmates and staff.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 99<U+2013>100, 150<U+2013>152</ref> A rift developed between Sly and the rest of the band, which led to drummer Gregg Errico's departure from the band to pursue other ventures in early 1971.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 146<U+2013>147</ref> Following the release of the band's ''Greatest Hits'' record, "Thank You"'s popularity cooling off and the band's absence from the media, speculation by fans and critics arose as to the release of new studio material. In a December 24, 1970, article for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, music critic [[Jon Landau]] elaborated on the anticipation of the group's next record:

{{quote|The man from Epic tells me that Sly hasn't recorded much lately. His last album of new material was released well over a year ago and even "Thank You", his last single, is old by now. ''Greatest Hits'' was released only as a last resort in order to get something salable into the record stores. It was a necessary release and stands as the final record of the first chapter in Sly & the Family Stone's career. Whatever the reasons for his recording abstinence, I hope it ends soon so that he can get back to making new music and we can get back to listening to it.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/slythefamilystone/albums/album/217030/review/5942778/greatest_hits Rolling Stone - Sly & the Family Stone: Greatest Hits : Music Reviews].

Influenced by drug use and the pivotal events which had lead to, what writer [[Miles Marshall Lewis]] called, "the death of the sixties", including political assassinations, police brutality, the decline of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights movement]] and social disillusionment, Stone had sought to create a more darker, conceptual work in contrast to the optimisitic and radio-friendly work prior to ''There's a Riot Goin' On''.<ref name=riot/> A music writer later noted that Sly Stone's work on ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' "slowed down, his quest for post-stardom identity" and "mirrored black America's quest for post-Sixties purpose."<ref>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid%3A471773 The Austin Chronicle: Music: Review - Sly & the Family Stone].

==Album artwork==
The original cover art for ''Riot'' featured a red, white, and black [[American flag]] with suns in place of the stars. No other text or titles appear on the cover, although Epic executives added a "Featuring the Hit Single 'Family Affair'" sticker to the LP for commercial viability and identification purposes. Family Stone [[A&R]] director Steve Paley took the photograph.<ref name=lewis70/> Three of the custom flags were created: one for Sly, one for Epic Records, and one for Paley. The album was later reissued with a more conventional, alternate cover featuring a photograph of Sly in concert and the traditional album titles and text. In an interview with Jonathan Dakss, webmaster of the official Sly & the Family Stone website, Stone explained the album cover's concept in relation to ''Riot''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s theme:

{{quote|I wanted the flag to truly represent people of all colors. I wanted the color black because it is the absence of color. I wanted the color white because it is the combination of all colors. And I wanted the color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, looking right at you. [[Betsy Ross]] did the best she could with what she had. I thought I could do better.<ref name=lewis73/>|Sly Stone}}

The outer album sleeve features a photomontage, by artist Lynn Ames, depicting American cultural images of the early 1970s. Featured on this collage were color photos and black & whites of the Family Stone, [[the Capitol]], a grinning boy in plaid pants, the American flag with a [[peace sign]] in place of the stars, the [[Marina City|Marina City twin towers]] of Chicago, a Department of Public Works caution sign, a piece of the [[Gettysburg Address]], the tail end of a 1970s [[gas guzzler]], funk drummer [[Buddy Miles]], the [[Lincoln Memorial]], soul musician [[Bobby Womack]], a bulldog, dozens of anonymous smiling faces, and Sly Stone's pit bull, Gun.<ref name=lewis70/>

==Music==
===Production===
Sly Stone worked on ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' mostly alone in a studio that he had especially built for himself at [[The Plant Studios]], also known as The Record Plant, in [[Sausalito, California]], or at home in a studio located in the loft of his [[Bel Air]] mansion. The Record Plant studio included a bed and a wireless microphone system, and Stone would often simply lay down in the bed and record his vocals while in repose.<ref name=lewis73/> 

According to the other Family Stone members, most of the album's instrumentation was performed by Sly alone in the studio via [[overdubbing]] and, for some of the material, used a rhythm box in place for drummer [[Gregg Errico]].<ref name=lewis73>Lewis (2006), pp. 73-75.</ref>  When the other band members contributed instrumentation to ''Riot'' tracks, they also did so by overdubbing alone with Sly, instead of playing in unison as was usual for them on previous recordings. For "Family Affair" and some of the other selections on the album, Stone enlisted several of his industry peers and musicians, including contemporary soul acts of the time [[Billy Preston]], [[Ike Turner]], and [[Bobby Womack]] in order to provide instrumentation on the album, instead of his bandmates. Stone had also enlisted several random female vocalists to contribute with background singing, but was unsatisfied and erased their vocals from the tapes manually. The album's notable muddy and gritty sound was due in part to this excessive use of overdubbing and erasing parts of the reel-to-reel tapes.<ref name=lewis73/>

In the fall of 1971, Sly Stone personally drove the ''Riot'' masters to the CBS Records offices, relieving the worried Clive Davis. CBS issued "Family Affair" as the first [[Single (music)|single]]; it was the first Family Stone recording to be released in nearly two years.<ref name=lewis20>Lewis (2006), pp. 20-22.</ref> "Family Affair" became the fourth and final number-one pop hit for the band, but it was still a notable departure from the sound of their earlier hits. A somber, [[electric piano]]-based record, Sly and sister [[Rose Stone]] sing about the good and bad aspects of family, with Sly delivering his part in a low, depressed tone.<ref name=selvin94/> The song's rhythm is provided by a [[drum machine]] (or rhythm box), making it one of the earliest hit recordings to feature use of such a device (the first was another Sly Stone production, [[Little Sister (band)|Little Sister]]'s "Somebody's Watching You").<ref name=lewis73/> The swampy texture of the song's production, as well as the entire album itself, was engendered by Stone's overdubbing, [[Multi track recording|multi-track]] and [[Audio mixing|mixing]] techniques, which were notable for nearly drowning out undubbed sounds.<ref name=lewis73/> Miles Marshall Lewis later wrote of ''Riot''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production effect on Stone's vocals: 

{{quote|The lyrics of ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' are an interesting affair... Never before on a Sly and the Family Stone album were songs open to so much interpretation, and even more so, dripping with cynicism. On the other hand you can hardly hear what he's saying for most of the album. Like [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]'' or even [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' more recent to the time, a murkiness in the mix of the record inhibits complete comprehension of the words.<ref name=lewis73/>|Miles Marshall Lewis}}

Sly Stone felt that the rhythm box, if used the way it was designed to be used, would make unrealistic sounds, and resorted to holding down five buttons, running the tape, then rewinding, holding down a different set of five buttons, and overdubbing.

===Content===
Most of ''Riot'' features Sly alone on lead vocals <U+2013> Rose is the only other member of the band who sings solo lead parts on the album. The entire record featured a dampened, [[Dub music|dub]]-like sound as the result of Sly's extensive re-recording and overdubbing, which matches the burnt-out, frustrated, drugged tone of Sly's lyrics and vocals. ''Riot'' finds Sly reveling in drug-induced euphoria ("Luv n' Haight"), praising himself ("Poet") and declaring that the good times and high hopes of 1960s are over, and the bad times (the 1970s) are here ("Africa Talks To You 'The Asphalt Jungle'"). This was also of the few songs to feature co-lead vocals by The Family Stone. The angry and forceful "[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]" (included on ''[[Greatest Hits (Sly & the Family Stone)|Greatest Hits]]'') is reincarnated as the slow, ghastly "Thank You For Talking to Me Africa". The song's lyrics, like many of the themes on the album, feature the concept of the disillusionment of the soul. In an article for [[Allmusic]], critic Matthew Greenwald praised the song's concept, writing:

{{quote|The closing track on ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' is perhaps the most frightening recording from the dawn of the 1970s, capturing all of the drama, ennui, and hedonism of the decade to come with almost a clairvoyant feel. Essentially, "Thank You for Talkin' to Me Africa" is a slowed-down version of "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)". That song in itself was a terrifying look at urban tension, couched in a blues-gospel motif, and this extended (and again, much slowed down and bluesy) version reminded listeners that, indeed, "the dream was over" as the '60s drew to a close.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:0jfexvygldte allmusic: Thank You for Talkin' to Me, Africa].

"Runnin' Away" and "(You Caught Me) Smilin'" were ''Riot's'' other singles.<ref name=runnin>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/searchResult.jsp?exp=y&Ntt=Runnin%27+Away+Sly&Ntk=Keyword&Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&nor=10&an=bbcom&N=37&Ns=FORMATTED_DATE|0 Billboard.com - Search Results: Runnin' Away Sly <small>(singles charts)</small>].

Nielsen Business Media. Retrieved on 2008-08-16.</ref> The former features Rose Stone singing the lead vocals in unison with her brother Sly, and the latter was the first Family Stone recording for Gerry Gibson, who replaced [[Gregg Errico]] as the Family Stone's drummer. Errico had gradually withdrawn from the band early in 1971, as a result of Sly Stone's increased drug use and now unpredictable demeanor. Side one technically concludes with the album's title track, which is silent, and listed as being zero minutes and zero seconds long. 

For many years, it was speculated that this cryptic track listing and the title of the album were in reference to a July 27, 1970 riot in [[Chicago, Illinois]] for which Sly & the Family Stone had been blamed. The band was to have played a free show, but the crowd became restless before they made it onstage and began rioting. Over a hundred people were injured, including several police officers, and the reason given to the press was that the band was late and/or refused to perform.<ref>Lewis (2006), pp. 60-64.</ref> However, when Sly Stone was visited by web technician Johnathan Dakss of the band's official website in 1997, Stone disproved this rumor. Instead, he told Dakks that the "There's a Riot Goin' On" track had no running time because "I felt there should be no riots."<ref>Dakss, Jonathan (1997). "My Weekend with Sly Stone". ''Sly-and-the-family-stone.com.''</ref>

==Reception==
===Initial===
Upon release, ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' received mixed reviews from fans and critics who were not used to the album's general mood and lyrical content, despite achieving commercial success with two hit singles and debuting at number-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Pop Albums]] and [[Soul Albums]] chart.<ref name=charts/> While Sly Stone's previous body of work consisted of mostly optimistic R&B and psychedelic soul music, some major music publications praised this new, darker direction and composition. In his book ''Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock 'n' Roll Music'', which was published four years following the album's release, music critic and writer [[Greil Marcus]] cited ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' as "[[Muzak]] with its finger on the trigger."<ref name=rollingstone/> In a December 23, 1971 article for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, music journalist [[Vince Aletti]] wrote of ''Riot'':

{{quote|Maybe this is the new urban music. It's not about dancing to the music, in the streets. It's about disintegration, getting fucked up, nodding, maybe dying. There are flashes of euphoria, ironic laughter, even some bright stretches but mostly it's just junkie death, oddly unoppressive and almost attractive in its effortlessness. Like going to sleep very slowly. The music has no peaks, no emphasis, little movement; it seems to fall away like a landslide in a dream (you falling slowly too, not panicking) or merely continue, drained of impetus, self-destructing. Smack rock... But once you get into the haze of it, it can be rather beautiful: measured, relaxed, hypnotic... At first I hated it for its weakness and its lack of energy and I still dislike these qualities. But then I began to respect the album's honesty... It's hard to take, but ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' is one of the most important fucking albums this year.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/slythefamilystone/albums/album/224723/review/5944303/theres_a_riot_goin_on Sly & the Family Stone: There's A Riot Goin' On (1971)].

The album was included on many music publications' "End of the Year" lists, including ''[[The Village Voice]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s ''Albums of the Year'' list at number 7.<ref name="crit"/><ref>Lewis (2008), pp. 98-105.</ref>

===Retrospect===
Following initial mixed reaction to the album, ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' has earned a legacy as one of the greatest and most influential albums ever recorded, while earning several accolades.<ref name="crit"/> Renowned music writer and journalist [[Robert Christgau]] later cited the album as "Despairing, courageous, and very hard to take, this is one of those rare albums whose whole actually does exceed the sum of its parts... The inspiration may be Sly's discovery that the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow doesn't mean shit, but what's expressed is the bitterest ghetto pessimism."<ref>[http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1270&name=Sly+%26+the+Family+Stone Robert Christgau: CG: Sly & the Family Stone]. Village Voice. Retrieved on 2008-10-01.</ref> Christgau later concluded of the album's significance in a May 2007 article for ''Rolling Stone'':

{{quote|1969's ''Stand!'' revealed the magnificence of which this band would all too briefly be capable... Sly Stone had 'Made It'. But its temptations and contradictions ate him up. The result was the prophetic 1971 ''There's a Riot Goin' On'', recorded in anarchic, druggy torpor over a year, or was it two, Stone didn't know the difference. Its taped-over murk presaging ''Exile on Main St.'', its drum-machine beats throwing knuckleballs at [[Miles Davis|Miles]] and [[James Brown|JB]], it was darker than the ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico|Velvet Underground and Nico]]'' and funkier than shit, yet somehow it produced two smash hits, including the stark, deep "Family Affair".<ref>[http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rs/sly-07.php Robert Christgau: Sly and the Family Stone - Rolling Stone, May 3-17, 2007].

In a 2003 article for ''Rolling Stone'', a contributor commented on the album's overall change in direction by Sly Stone for ''Riot'' by writing, "Sly and the Family Stone created a musical utopia: an interracial group of men and women who blended funk, rock and positive vibes... Sly Stone ultimately discovered that his utopia had a ghetto, and he brilliantly tore the whole thing down on ''There's a Riot Goin' On'', which does not refute the joy of his earlier music."<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6597906/60_greatest_hits RS500: 60) Greatest Hits]. Rolling Stone. Retrieved on 2008-10-25.</ref> In addition to being featured near the top of several major publications' "best album" lists, ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' was also ranked at number 99 on ''Rolling Stone'''s 2003 list of the [[500 Greatest Albums of All Time]], one of four Sly & the Family Stone entries to be included on the list; it is the second highest of the band's entries, preceded by ''[[Fresh (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Fresh]]'' (#186) and ''[[Stand!]]'' (#118), and followed by ''[[Greatest Hits (Sly & the Family Stone album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (#60).<ref name=rollingstone/>

==Influence==
Along with its critical recognition as one of the greatest albums of all time, the music on ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' is also considered one of the first instances of the type of funk music later popularized by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Funkadelic]], the [[Ohio Players]], and similar acts. ''There's a Riot Goin' On'', as well as the follow-up efforts ''[[Fresh (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Fresh]]'', and ''[[Small Talk (album)|Small Talk]]'' are considered among the first and best examples of the matured version of funk music, after prototypical instances of the sound in Sly & the Family Stone's 1960s work.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:08q7g4kttv2z~T1 allmusic ((( Sly & the Family Stone > Biography )))]. All Media Guide, LLC. Retrieved on 2008-10-01.</ref> The album's unique sound also influenced legendary jazz musicians [[Miles Davis]] and [[Herbie Hancock]] to crossover to the [[jazz-funk]] genre.<ref>Lewis (2006), p. 27.</ref> From the 1970s on, ''Riot's'' songs have been extensively covered and [[Sampling (music)|sample]]d. Among the artists who have covered or reworked songs from ''Riot'' include [[Iggy Pop]], [[Lalah Hathaway]], [[Ultramagnetic MC's]], [[De La Soul]], [[The Beastie Boys]], [[Gwen Guthrie]], and many others. The funk music genre in general, including the works of Sly & The Family Stone and [[James Brown]] & [[The J.B.'s]], had great influence on pioneering [[hip hop]] acts, such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[DJ Kool Herc]] and many others who have sampled their music.<ref>Lewis (2006), pp. 77-78.</ref> Dave Rosen of ''Ink Blot'' magazine wrote in retrospect of the album's effect on music:

{{quote|''Riot'' still sounds remarkably different from all other music even 27 years later (ironically in spite of the fact that the record has had such broad influence), so it should be easy to imagine the confusion it inspired upon its release... Sly employed the unconventional (and possibly enirely original) technique of mixing live drums with what was at the time a primitive drum machine... The introspective, yet political lyrics, the hard and dirty funk grooves, the inspirational, yet depressing songs<U+2014>all of these elements would come to influence not only peers like Marvin Gaye and James Brown, but two generations of rappers and funkateers who paid homage to Sly's vision by making his samples and beats an essential backbone of their own innovations. Sly's ''Riot'' is still goin' on.<ref>[http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/sly.htm Ink Blot: There's a Riot Goin' On - Review]. Ink Blot Magazine. Retrieved on 2008-10-01.</ref>|Dave Rosen}}

In his book ''There's a Riot Goin' On'', Miles Marshall Lewis described ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' in retrospect as "one of the most powerful and haunting albums to inspire the hip hop movement."<ref>Lewis (2006), Back cover.</ref>
