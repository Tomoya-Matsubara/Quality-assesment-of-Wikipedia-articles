It is owned and operated by [[the Oriental Land Company]] with a license from [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The resort opened on April 15, 1983, as a single theme park ([[Tokyo Disneyland]]), but developed into a resort with two theme parks, three Disney hotels, six non-Disney hotels, and a shopping complex. Tokyo Disneyland was the first Disney theme park opened outside the [[United States]].

Tokyo Disney Resort has three main entertainment sections: [[Tokyo Disneyland]], [[Tokyo DisneySea]] and [[Ikspiari]], which is a variation of the [[Downtown Disney]] shopping, dining and entertainment area found at the Disney resorts in [[Disneyland Resort|California]] and [[Walt Disney World Resort|Florida]]. It also contains [[Bon Voyage! (shop)|Bon Voyage!]], which is the official Disney goods specialty shop of Tokyo Disney Resort. In October 2008, the resort opened a new theater housing an original [[Cirque du Soleil]] production named ''[[Zed (Cirque du Soleil)|Zed]]''.

Like the other Disney resorts, the Tokyo Disney Resort has 3 Disney-branded hotels; the Disney Ambassador Hotel, the Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta (the building in which the entrance to Tokyo DisneySea is located), and the recently opened Tokyo Disneyland Hotel.

There are six other hotels located on the Tokyo Disney Resort property. These, however, are not Disney-branded hotels and are owned by other companies, similar to the Hotel Plaza Boulevard hotels at [[Walt Disney World]].

All facilities are linked by [[Disney Resort Line]] monorail.

The Tokyo Disney Resort is headed by [[Toshio Kagami]], who is the secretary general (CEO) of the Oriental Land Company.
