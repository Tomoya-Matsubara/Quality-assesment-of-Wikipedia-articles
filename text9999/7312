The '''fourth season''' of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]'' commenced airing on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 4, 1996, concluding on the same channel on May 18, 1997, and contained 24 episodes. Following the filming and airing of the season, production began on [[The X-Files (film)|''The X-Files'' feature film]], which was scheduled to be released in 1998 following the show's [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth season]].

The fourth season of the series focused heavily on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] federal agents [[Fox Mulder]]'s ([[David Duchovny]]) and his partner [[Dana Scully]]'s ([[Gillian Anderson]]) investigation of an alien conspiracy, which is protected by the mysterious [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]]. Midway through the season, Scully is diagnosed with terminal cancer, a result of her [[Duane Barry|previous abduction]], and Mulder begins to lose his faith in the idea of extraterrestrials.  The season ends on a [[cliffhanger]], with the purported suicide of Mulder.

Debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the twentieth most watched television series during the [[1996<U+2013>97 United States network television schedule|1996<U+2013>97]] television year in the United States, the season was a success, with figures averaging around 20 million viewers an episode. This made it, at the time, the highest rated season of ''The X-Files'' to air. The season's twelfth episode, "[[Leonard Betts]]" was chosen as the Fox [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] following [[Super Bowl XXXI]], and was viewed by 29.1 million viewers, making it the highest-rated episode in the series' run. Critical reception from television critics was mostly positive.

==Plot overview==
<!-- Don't include any summary from the non-mytharc episodes since they are stand alone episodes. -->
{{see also|Mythology of The X-Files}}
The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. When the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]] suspect that one of their members is passing information to Mulder and Scully, they organize a [[canary trap]] to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's ([[Steven Williams]]) role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder<U+2014>[[Marita Covarrubias]] ([[Laurie Holden]]), the Special Representative to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]].<ref name="Herrenvolk">{{cite episode| episodelink=Herrenvolk (The X-Files) | title=Herrenvolk | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[R.

==Production==
===Writing===
[[File:GillianAndersonByIdoCarmelWonderCon2008.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The writers for ''The X-Files'' decided to give [[Gillian Anderson]]'s character cancer in season four.]]
The season saw drastic changes to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, "[[Herrenvolk (The X-Files)|Herrenvolk]]", Williams<U+2014>the actor who played Mulder's informant X<U+2014>was written out of the show. He said that, "Carter called me up personally [and said] 'Got good news, got bad news. The good news is we're gonna bring you up for another episode this week. The bad news is you're gonna take a bullet." <ref name=bigbookseason4/> The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be "more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman", noting that he "wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically.<ref name="cinefant">{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=David |year=1999 |month=October |title=Laurie Holden: The UNblonde on playing femme fatale Marita Covvarubias |journal=[[Cinefantastique]] |volume=31  |issue=8 |pages=40<U+2013>41 }}</ref> "Herrenvolk" also introduced the killer bees, who would go on to play a larger part in the [[The X-Files (film)|1998 movie]].<ref name=bigbookseason4/>

The season is notable in that it introduced a story arc about Scully developing terminal cancer, which would not be resolved until the beginning of the [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth season]]. The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal.<ref name="prodcancer">Meisler (1998), p. 164</ref> Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as "a cheap TV thing". However, [[Frank Spotnitz]] felt that, given the appearances of cancer-stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an "obligatory" move to have Scully follow suit.<ref>{{cite video|title=Introduction to Memento Mori |work=The X-Files: Essentials |year=2008 |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] (narrators) |format=featurette|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]]}}</ref>

Following the cancellation of the Fox television series ''[[Space: Above and Beyond]]'', Carter called the series' creators Glen Morgan and Wong<U+2014>who had previously been writers for the first two seasons of ''The X-Files''<U+2014>and asked if they wanted to rejoin the series. Morgan told Carter that the two of them would rejoin, but only for four episodes, and only if they could use members for the cast of ''Space: Above and Beyond'', so that "the world can finally see them".<ref name=bigbookseason4/> Carter accepted this condition, and the two dutifully provided four of the seasons episodes.<ref name=bigbookseason4>Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 91</ref>

===Filming===
The season finale, "Gethsemane", was notable in that an entire set created to emulated icy caverns was constructed inside a warehouse which had previously been used for cold storage;<ref name="behind">{{cite video |people=Graham Murray & Rob Maier (narrators) |title=Behind the Truth: Ice Cave |location=''The X-Files: The Complete Fourth Season'' |format=DVD}}</ref> and required the use of truckloads of lumber and {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}} of Styrofoam. The set would become one of the most expensive and elaborate built during the series' history.<ref name="prod1">Meisler (1998), p. 270</ref> The set required a constant temperature of {{convert|<U+2212>21|F|C|sigfig=2}} in order to maintain the real snow and ice used to decorate it. This refrigeration allowed the actors' breath to visibly fog up, and allowed the cast to "have a place that feels real" to aid their acting.<ref name="behind"/> The outdoor scenes for the episode were filmed around [[Vancouver]]'s [[Mount Seymour]], with weather conditions making shooting difficult enough to require an extra day of work.<ref name="prod1" />

Although the series' 1998 movie would take place after the events of the fifth season, the movie was actually filmed in the [[Recess (break)|hiatus]] between the show's fourth and fifth season and re-shoots were conducted during the filming of the show's fifth season.<ref name="TheTruthBehind">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], et al |date=1998 |title=The Truth Behind Season 5 |medium= DVD |publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref>

===Crew===
Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] also served as [[executive producer]] and [[showrunner]] and wrote eight episodes. [[Howard Gordon]] continued as executive producer and wrote five episodes for his final season on the series. Spotnitz was promoted to co-producer and wrote seven episodes. [[Vince Gilligan]] was promoted to co-producer and wrote five episodes. Former ''X-Files'' writers [[Glen Morgan]] and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] returned after an one season absence from the series as consulting producers and wrote three episodes together, with Morgan writing an additional episode solo that Wong directed. [[John Shiban]] was promoted to story editor and wrote four episodes. [[David Greenwalt]] joined mid-season as co-executive producer and wrote one episode for his only season on the series. Writing team Valerie and Vivian Mayhew wrote one freelance episode. Executive producer and frequent series director [[R. W. Goodwin]] wrote his first and only episode for the series. Other producers included producer Joseph Patrick Finn, co-producer [[Paul Rabwin]], and consulting producer [[Ken Horton]], who joined the series with this season.<ref name="DVD77"/>

Producing-directors for the show included [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] and [[Kim Manners]], who directed the bulk of the episodes for the season. Manners directed eight episodes, while Bowman directed seven. Executive producer R. W. Goodwin again directed the season premiere and finale. James Charleston directed three episodes, while [[Tucker Gates]], [[Michael Lange]], [[Cliff Bole]], and series writer James Wong each directed one episode.<ref name="DVD77"/>

===Reviews===
The fourth season of ''The X-Files'' received largely positive reviews from television critics, although several critics noted that the season was not as good as its predecessors. The ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'' noted that ''The X-Files'' during its fourth year was creatively good and "always fascinating even when it's frustrating."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Good, The Bad and the Ugly|url=http://docs.newsbank.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/NewsBank/1063FD156A566979/0F8479522BD09CA1?s_lang=en-US|accessdate=March 20, 2013|page=F01|newspaper=[[Contra Costa Times]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=May 29, 1997}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Rick Kushman Bee of the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' wrote that Fox' Sunday block of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'' and ''The X-Files'' was televisions "real '[[Must See TV]]'".<ref>{{cite news|last=Bee|first=Rick|title=Soaring and Snoring|url=http://docs.newsbank.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/NewsBank/0EB046AA72E0F6CC/0F8479522BD09CA1?s_lang=en-US|accessdate=March 20, 2013|newspaper=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=December 30, 1997|page=C1|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Matt Roush of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote that the fourth season was not the series' best year, but "when good, [''The X-Files'' is] still shockingly great".<ref>{{cite news|last=Roush|first=Matt|title=TV's Moments to Remember|url=http://docs.newsbank.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/NewsBank/0EB7730346DD2F6C/0F8479522BD09CA1?s_lang=en-US|accessdate=March 20, 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=June 2, 1997|page=8D}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave an overall positive review of the season and wrote that the many of the episodes dabbled in [[existentialism]]. However, he also contended that many of the mythology episodes<U+2014>especially the season finale<U+2014>began to have "a ring of familiarity to" them and that "the repetition is getting old".<ref>{{cite web|last=Handlen|first=Zack|title='Demons'/'Gethsemane' {{!}} The X-Files/Millennium {{!}} TV Club|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/demonsgethsemane,53003/|work=[[The A.V.

Episodic reviews were diverse. Some episodes were praised. [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episodes "Home", "Unruhe", "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", "Paper Hearts", and "Small Potatoes" five stars out of five.<ref name=shear>Shearman and Pearson (2009), pp. 81<U+2013>104</ref> Paula Vitaris of ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' also awarded "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", "Paper Hearts", and "Small Potatoes" perfect scores of four out of four.<ref name=cinepaula>{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 1997|volume=29|issue=4/5|accessdate=March 29, 2012|page=35<U+2013>62}}</ref> Tom Kessenich named "Memento Mori" the fourth best episode of the series, writing that it was the definitive example of Mulder and Scully's devotion for each other.".<ref name=kess/> He also wrote highly of "Home", "Paper Hearts", Small Potatoes",  and "Never Again", ranking them as the fifth, eleventh, sixteenth, and twenty-fourth best episodes of ''The X-Files'', respectively.<ref name=kess>Kessencih (2002), pp. 216<U+2013>220</ref> Other episodes were derided. Shearman and Pearson called "El Mundo Gira" an "aching unambitious take on Latin American culture" and "rubbish".<ref name=shear/> Vitaris summaried "Unrequited" as a "slight story that collapses under the weight of its message".<ref name=cinepaula/>

"Gethsemane" created intense media speculation about whether or not Mulder was actually dead. An article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' discussed fan theories behind Mulder's madness while a cartoon ran in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' a few weeks later surrounding Mulder's "death".<ref name="prod4">Meisler (1998), p. 271</ref>  Series creator Chris Carter noted that "the whole plot line of 'Gethsemane' revolved around a hoax, but there are actually huge revelations in this show. And it's an amazing thing that we could get people to believe that Mulder could actually kill himself because his belief system was stolen from him".<ref name="prod4"/> [[UGO Networks]] listed the episode at number 21 in a countdown of "TV's Best Season Finales", noting that it "rocked the core of the series' entire mythology".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/tv-best-season-finales-the-x-files-gethsemane |title=The X-Files <U+2013> TV's Best Season Finales |first=Kevin |last=Fitzpatrick |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |date=May 27, 2011 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>
