==Explanation of the book's title==
The title of ''An Inconvenient Book'' is a parody of the title of the [[Al Gore]] documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', and one section of the book provides a response to the claims of Al Gore and other [[anthropogenic]] [[global warming]] advocates.

The book offers further explanation of the book<U+2019>s title: <U+201C>Have you ever wondered why some of the biggest problems we face, from illegal immigration to global warming to poverty, never seem to get fixed? The reason is simple: the solutions just aren<U+2019>t ''convenient''<U+2019>. Fortunately, radio and television host Glenn Beck doesn<U+2019>t care much about convenience; he cares about common sense<U+201D><ref>Beck, Glenn, et al.

==Publication history==
According to Glenn Beck's Radio Program the same day, after the ninth printing, [[Amazon.com]], [[Barnes & Noble]], [[Overstock.com]], etc. had all sold out by Monday, December 3, 2007. Also according to the December 3, 2007 edition of the Glenn Beck Program (radio show), due to high demand, a special printing was ordered to keep up with demand until the paper it was printed on was made available again to the publisher, and the special paper was of a different shape and higher quality than the paper used for the first nine printings, resulting in an unintentional "limited edition," which was scheduled to become available on December 12th, 2007.
