{{German Faith Movement}}
'''Jakob Wilhelm Hauer''' (4 April 1881, [[Ditzingen]], [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] &ndash; 18 February 1962, [[T<U+00FC>bingen]]) was a German [[Indology|Indologist]] and [[religious studies]] writer. He was the founder of the [[German Faith Movement]].

==Biography==
Initially trained in the family trade as a [[plasterer]], he entered the [[Basel Mission|missionary schoo]]l at [[Basel]] in 1900 and served as a missionary in [[British India]] from 1907 to 1911.<ref name=Kirchenlexikon>{{BBKL|h/hauer_w|band=2|autor=Friedrich Wilhelm Bautz|artikel=Hauer, Jakob Wilhelm|spalten=593-594}}</ref> His time in India and his study of indigenous religions saw him lose faith in [[Christianity]] and instead he returned to his studies, reading religious studies and [[Sanskrit]] at a doctorate level at the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of T<U+00FC>bingen]], before going on to teach at the [[University of Marburg]] (1925) and T<U+00FC>bingen itself (1927).<ref name=Kirchenlexikon/> Under his tutelage religious studies at T<U+00FC>bingen became increasingly close to [[Nazism]] and by 1940 he was heading up an '[[Aryan]] Seminar'.<ref>[http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~religion/vereinigungen/dvrg/dvrg2001_junginger.html The Study of Religion under the Impact of National Socialism]</ref>

In 1920 he formed the ''[[Bund der K<U+00F6>ngener]]'', a youth movement that grew out of groups of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Bible]] circles who had come into contact with the [[Wandervogel]] tendency. Initially little more than a more organized version of the Wandervogel, the Bund, which was for a time led by [[Rudolf Otto]], became attracted to the ideals of the [[V<U+00F6>lkisch movement]], especially as Hauer began to move more towards developing his own religion.<ref>Hans-Christian Brandenburg & Rudolf Daur, ''Die Br<U+00FC>cke zu K<U+00F6>ngen. F<U+00FC>nfzig Jahre Bund der K<U+00F6>ngener'', Stuttgart, 1970</ref>

Hauer began to look into his own forms of religion in 1927 when he set up the ''[[Religi<U+00F6>ser Menschheitsbund]]'', which aimed for a greater unity amongst Germany's faiths towards common goals.<ref name=Kirchenlexikon/> He joined with [[Ernst Graf zu Reventlow]] in this endeavour and in 1934 founded the German Faith Movement (''[[Deutsche Glaubensbewegung]]''), which combined a number of existing communities in a V<U+00F6>lkisch faith influenced by [[Hinduism]].<ref name=Kirchenlexikon/> Hauer's admiration for Hinduism centred on the [[Bhagavad Gita]], to which he had been particularly drawn. He described it as "a work of imperishable significance", arguing that it called on people to "master the riddle of life".<ref>[http://www.hinduwisdom.info/quotes81_100.htm Quotes on Hinduism]</ref> By July 1934 the religion had been ratified as Hauer celebrated his first wedding without other clergy.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747547,00.html Pagans and Gags] from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>

It had initially been hoped that it might be adopted as the state religion of the [[Third Reich]] but this did not happen and as it began to decline Hauer left in 1936. Hauer remained close to the Nazis however, finally joining the party in 1937<ref name="Blamires">C.P. Blamires, ''World Fascism - A Historical Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 299</ref>, and wrote to [[Heinrich Himmler]] immediately after [[Rudolf Hess]]' flight to Scotland to denounce the Nazi Party number two as a victim of the [[anthroposophy]] which he had opposed.<ref>Uwe Werner, [http://www.defendingsteiner.com/pers/Hess.php Was Rudolf Hess an Anthroposophist?]</ref> 

In later years Hauer would seek to not only distance himself from the Nazis but also to portray himself as an anthroposophist. In 1935, however, he wrote that:

<blockquote>"every undertaking and activity of anthroposophy necessarily arises out of the Anthroposophical world view. The anthroposophical world view is in the most important points directly opposed to National Socialism. Therefore, schools which are built out of the anthroposophical world view and led by anthroposophists mean danger to true German education."<ref>Uwe Werner, [http://www.waldorfanswers.com/AnthroposophyDuringNaziTimes.htm#3 Anthroposophy in the Time of Nazi Germany]</ref></blockquote>

Hauer was removed from his university position after World War II and was [[internment|interned]] from 1945 to 1949.<ref name="Blamires"/> He continued to agitate for his own religion, forming the ''[[Arbeitsgemeinschaft f<U+00FC>r freie Religionsforschung und Philosophie]]'' in 1947 and the ''[[Freie Akademie]]'' in 1955.<ref name=Kirchenlexikon/>
