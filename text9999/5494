A '''South American dreadnought race''' between [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]] began in 1907 when the Brazilian government announced its intention to purchase three [[dreadnought]]s<U+2014>powerful [[battleship]]s whose capabilities far outstripped older vessels in the world's navies. Previous [[Argentina<U+2013>Chile relations|Argentine<U+2013>Chilean]] naval [[arms race]]s, combined with the overthrow of the Brazilian monarchy and subsequent naval rebellions, had left the Brazilian Navy well behind the Argentine and Chilean navies in quality and total tonnage. Brazilian politicians first moved to address this imbalance in 1904 as part of an overarching goal of becoming an international power. Three small battleships were ordered in late 1905, but after the appearance of the revolutionary British warship [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2}} in 1906, the Brazilian government canceled all three in favor of the new "dreadnought" type.{{#tag:ref|''cf.'' [[Pre-dreadnought battleship#Obsolescence|"Obsolescence"]] in [[Pre-dreadnought battleship]].|group=upper-alpha}} Hulls for two [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|''Minas Geraes''-class]] ships were [[keel laying|laid down]] with a third to follow.

The Argentine and Chilean governments immediately canceled a pact limiting their navies, and each ordered two dreadnoughts (the [[Rivadavia-class battleship|''Rivadavia'']] and [[Almirante Latorre-class battleship|''Almirante Latorre'' classes]], respectively). Meanwhile, Brazil's third dreadnought, ''Rio de Janeiro'', was canceled in favor of an even larger ship, which was laid down and ripped up several times after repeated alterations to the design. When the Brazilian government finally settled on a design, they realized it would be outclassed by larger [[super-dreadnought]]s then being built, so they sold the ship to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and attempted to acquire a more powerful vessel.

The Brazilian government ordered one super-dreadnought from Armstrong, but the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]] caused shipbuilders in the United Kingdom to suspend work on foreign warships, effectively canceling the ship. The war also caused the United Kingdom to purchase the two Chilean battleships before they were delivered, but Argentina's two dreadnoughts, built in the United States, were handed over in 1915. In the [[Interwar period|years after the war]], many naval expansion plans, some involving dreadnought purchases, were proposed. While most never came to fruition, in April 1920 the Chilean government reacquired one of the dreadnoughts taken over by the United Kingdom. No other dreadnoughts were purchased by a South American nation, and all were sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in the 1950s.

== Background ==
=== Argentine<U+2013>Chilean boundary dispute ===
{{see also|Beagle conflict}}
Conflicting Argentine and Chilean claims to [[Patagonia]], the southernmost region in South America, had been causing tension between the two countries since the 1840s. This tension was heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed to operate in the disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. These actions nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]]. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty. Each government were distracted in the next few years, Argentina's with [[Conquest of the Desert|internal military operations against the indigenous population]], and Chile's with the [[War of the Pacific]] (''Guerra del Pac<U+00ED>fico'') against Bolivia and Peru. Still, a full-fledged naval [[arms race]] was underway between Argentina and Chile by 1890.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45<U+2013>46.</ref><ref>Garrett, "Beagle Channel," 85<U+2013>87.</ref>

[[File:Torpedera Lynch Chile.jpg|thumb|right|''Almirante Lynch'', seen here c. 1891, was [[keel laying|laid down]] in 1890 as part of the developing naval arms race between Argentina and Chile.]]
Both sides began ordering warships from the United Kingdom. In 1887, the Chilean government added [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]3,129,500 to the budget for its fleet, which was centered around two aging [[central battery ship|central battery]] [[ironclad warship|ironclads]], {{Ship|Chilean ironclad|Almirante Cochrane||2}} and {{Ship|Chilean ironclad|Blanco Encalada||2}}, and a [[protected cruiser]]. They ordered the battleship {{Ship|Chilean battleship|Capit<U+00E1>n Prat||2}}, two protected cruisers, and two [[torpedo boat]]s; their [[keel laying|keels were laid]] in 1890. The Argentine government quickly responded with an order for two battleships, {{Ship|ARA|Independencia|1891|2}} and {{Ship|ARA|Libertad|1890|2}}. The race continued through the 1890s, even after the expensive 1891 [[Chilean Civil War]]. The two countries alternated cruiser orders between 1890 and 1895, each ship marking a small increase in capabilities from the previous one. Argentina escalated the race in July 1895 by buying an [[armored cruiser]], {{Ship|ARA|Garibaldi||2}}, from Italy. Chile responded by ordering its own armored cruiser, {{Ship|Chilean cruiser|O'Higgins|1897|2}}, and six torpedo boats; the Argentine government quickly ordered another cruiser from Italy and later bought two more.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45<U+2013>49, 297<U+2013>98, 347.</ref>

The race slowed for a few years after [[Puna de Atacama dispute|a boundary dispute in the Puna de Atacama]] region was successfully mediated in 1899 by the [[United States Ambassador to Argentina|American ambassador to Argentina]], [[William Paine Lord]], but more ships were ordered by both countries in 1901. The Argentine Navy ordered two [[Kasuga class cruiser|''Rivadavia''-class]] armored cruisers from Italy, and the Chilean Navy replied with orders for two [[Swiftsure class battleship|''Constituci<U+00F3>n''-class]] [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships. The Argentines replied by signing letters of intent with the Italian engineering company [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]] in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships. The growing dispute disturbed members of the British government, as war looked like a very real possibility, and an armed conflict would disrupt the extensive British commercial interests in the area.{{#tag:ref|For example, the United Kingdom imported large amounts of Argentine grain&mdash;most of it shipped through the [[River Plate]]&mdash;and Chilean nitrates.<ref>Massie, ''Castles'', page.</ref>|group=upper-alpha}} Through their minister to Chile, they mediated negotiations between the two countries. These [[Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case 1902|were successfully concluded]] on 28 May 1902 with three pacts. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other eighteen months' advance notice. The United Kingdom's [[Royal Navy]] purchased the two Chilean battleships, while the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] took over the order for the two Argentine armored cruisers; the two Argentine battleships were never ordered. Two Argentine cruisers and Chile's ''Capit<U+00E1>n Prat'' were [[demilitarization|demilitarized]].<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 49<U+2013>52.</ref><ref>Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 146.</ref>

At the same time, the American government under [[Theodore Roosevelt]] tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as Cuba, whose [[1901 Constitution of Cuba|new constitution]] allowed the American government to intervene in Cuban affairs.<ref name=Livermore33>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 33.</ref> The new [[President of Brazil]], [[Afonso Pena]], supported the naval acquisitions in an address to the National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the losses recently suffered by the navy, most notably the old ''Aquidab<U+00E3>'', and the antiquated vessels of the current navy.<ref name=Livermore33/><ref>"[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&dat=19061117&id=FnY-AAAAIBAJ&sjid=mFkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2388,2700141 New Era in the Americas]," ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]'', 17 November 1906, 1.</ref>

Brazil laid the [[keel]]s of three battleships, but Britain's new [[dreadnought]] concept, represented by the commissioning of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|the ship of the same name]] in December 1906, rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete before they were completed.<ref name=Topliss246>Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 246.</ref> Naval historian Robert Schenia claims that a transition to a few large warships was helped when ''Aquidab<U+00E3>'' exploded in January 1906, as it killed many of the small-ship supporters, but the final blow was the selection of a large-ship advocate, Rear Admiral [[Alexandrino Fario de Alencar]], for the powerful post of minister of the navy in November.<ref name=Scheina81>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81.</ref> The money authorized for naval expansion in 1905 was redirected by de Alencar to building three dreadnoughts (with the third to be laid down after the first was launched), three scout cruisers (later reduced to two, which became the [[Bahia class cruiser|''Bahia'' class]]), fifteen destroyers (later reduced to ten, the [[Par<U+00E1> class destroyer (1908)|''Par<U+00E1>'' class]]), three submarines (the [[F 1 class submarine|''F 1'' class]]), and two [[submarine tender]]s (later reduced to one, [[Brazilian submarine tender Ceara|''Ceara'']]).<ref name=Scheina81/><ref>"Brazil," ''Naval Engineers'', 883.</ref><ref>"The Brazilian Navy," ''Times'' (London), 28 December 1908, 48f.</ref> The Brazilian Congress approved these changes with the stipulation that the total price of the naval program did not exceed the original limit, so the increase in battleship tonnage (originally planned to go from {{convert|13000|LT|t}} to {{convert|18000|LT|t|abbr=on}}) was bought with decreasing the number of destroyers.<ref>Grant, '"Rulers, Drugs, and Money'', 152.</ref> The three battleships on which construction had begun were scrapped beginning on 7 January 1907, and the design for the new dreadnoughts was approved on 20 February.<ref name=Topliss246/> Newspapers began reporting a Brazilian order for dreadnoughts in March,<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9906E1DE1E30E233A25756C0A9659C946697D6CF A Dreadnought For Brazil,]" [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']], 5 March 1907, 5.</ref><ref>"[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/10620654 Brazilian Navy]," [[The Argus (Australia)|''Argus'']], 7 March 1907, 7.</ref><ref>"[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=PBH19070306.2.23 British & Foreign]," ''[[Poverty Bay Herald]]'', 6 March 1907, 6.</ref> while the full order, including all three dreadnoughts and the two cruisers, was revealed in August.<ref>"The Large Order for Foreign Battleships," [[The Times|''Times'']] (London), 28 August 1907, 8f.</ref><ref>"[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/14905579 Brazil Arming]," [[The Sydney Morning Herald|''Sydney Morning Herald'']], 29 August 1907, 7.</ref>

The Brazilian order for these powerful new warships came at a time when few countries in the world had contracted for such armament. Brazil was the third country to have a dreadnought under construction, behind the United Kingdom, with [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|''Dreadnought'']] and the [[Bellerophon class battleship|''Bellerophon'' class]], and the United States, with the [[South Carolina class battleship|''South Carolina'' class]].

Whatever his culpability, his actions in that June may have been motivated by a personal vendetta against Rio Branco, who had bested Zeballos on several occasions since 1875, most notably during a border dispute arbitrated by American President Grover Cleveland (the [[Question of Palms]], or ''Quest<U+00E3>o de Palmas'').<ref>Heinsfeld, "Falsificando telegramas," 1&ndash;2, 5&ndash;10.</ref>|group=upper-alpha}}

to the possible effect on the country's large export trade, as a Brazilian blockade of the entrance to the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] would cripple the Argentine economy. The acquisition of dreadnoughts to maintain an equal footing with Brazil would, in the words of the Argentine admiral in charge of overseeing the Argentine dreadnoughts while under construction, avoid a "preponderance of power on the other side, where a sudden gust of popular feeling or injured pride might make [a blockade] a dangerous weapon against us."<ref>"[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&dat=19100604&id=upU-AAAAIBAJ&sjid=kVkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=805,4380508 A Message From Garcia]," ''Boston Evening Transcript'', 4 June 1910, 3.</ref>

In the second inquiry it may be presumed that everything that was good in the first proposals had been seized upon by the Argentine authorities and asked for in the new design. This second request went not only to British builders but to all the builders of the world, and in this way it is exceedingly probable that a serious leakage of ideas and practice of our ships was disseminated through the world by the Argentine government. ... The third inquiry that was issued showed to all the builders of the world what has been eliminated or modified in the second inquiry; and so the process of leakage went merrily on, and with it that of the education of foreign builders and the Argentine government.

Other South American navies were in no state to respond. The [[Peruvian Navy]], fourth-largest on the continent, had been decimated during the [[Naval Campaign of the War of the Pacific|naval campaign]] of the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879&ndash;83). The problem was compounded by not purchasing ships after the war, so that a pair of scout cruisers delivered in 1906 and 1907, [[BAP Almirante Grau (1906)|''Almirante Grau'']] and [[BAP Coronel Bolognesi (1906)|''Coronel Bolognesi'']], were the first new warships acquired since the war. They were augmented by two submarines and a destroyer ordered from France. With little expertise in operating any kind of modern warship, let alone a dreadnought, Peru was far from joining the naval race. Their highest aspirations were for the obsolete French armored cruiser [[French armoured cruiser Dupuy de L<U+00F4>me|''Dupuy de L<U+00F4>me'']], which they partially paid for but never bought. The rest of the South American navies had never operated large warships, though many added ships to their naval forces in the same time period.

== Third stage: another Brazilian dreadnought ==
{{main|HMS Agincourt (1913)|l1=HMS ''Agincourt'' (1913)}}
After the first Brazilian dreadnought, ''Minas Geraes'', was launched, the Brazilian government began an extended campaign to remove the third dreadnought from the contract due to political<U+2014>relations with Argentina were warming<U+2014>and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, due in part to lower bond rates that made it possible for the government to borrow the necessary money. ''Rio de Janeiro'' was laid for the first time in March 1910.<ref>Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 247<U+2013>49.</ref>

By May, the Brazilian government asked Armstrong to stop work on the new warship and to submit new designs which took in the most recent advance in naval technology, [[super-dreadnought]]s. [[Sir Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt, 1st Baronet|Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt]] served as Armstrong's liaison to Brazil. Originally, the dreadnought was going to mount twelve 14-inch guns, but the many requests made by the Brazilian Navy for minor changes delayed the contract signing until 10 October 1910. The battleship's keel laying was delayed further by a [[Labor unrest|labor dispute]] with the [[Worshipful Company of Shipwrights]], which led to a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]]. During these delays, a new Minister of the Navy, Admiral [[Marques Le<U+00E3>o]], was appointed to replace de Alencar<U+2014>an important development, as the contract stipulated that the design could only proceed with the approval of the new Minister. Again, however, the Brazilian Navy found itself torn between two schools of thought: Le<U+00E3>o and others in the navy favored a reversion to the 12-inch gun, but others, led by the outgoing Minister of the Navy (de Alencar) and the head of the Brazilian naval commission in the United Kingdom (Rear Admiral [[Duarte Huet de Bacellar Pinto Guedes]]), were strongly in favor of obtaining the ship with the largest armament<U+2014>in this case, a design drawn up by Bacellar, carrying eight 16-inch guns, six 9.4-inch guns, and fourteen 6-inch guns.<ref>Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 254<U+2013>57, 260, 263<U+2013>64, 268.</ref>

[[File:Main deck of Minas Geraes.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Sailors onboard ''Minas Geraes'', probably during the ship's visit to the United States in early 1910]]
D'Eyncourt, who had departed Brazil in October immediately after the contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Le<U+00E3>o had convinced the President to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns in favor of a smaller ship.<ref>Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 269.</ref> The credit may not have laid with Le<U+00E3>o alone, though. By March 1911, the Brazilian president was dealing with the aftermath of a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the [[Revolt of the Lash]])<U+2014>led by crewmen on the two new ''Minas Geraes''-class dreadnoughts his navy had just purchased<U+2014>and worsening [[government debt]] compounded by [[Government budget deficit|budget deficits]]. Brazil's external and internal debt would reach $500 and $335&nbsp;million (respectively) by 1913, partly through rising deficits&mdash;$22&nbsp;million in 1908, continuing to $47 million by 1912.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81<U+2013>82.</ref><ref>Martin, ''Latin America'', 37.</ref> In May, he commented negatively on the new ship:

<blockquote><span style="font-size:90%">When I assumed office, I found that my predecessor had signed a contract for the building of the battleship ''Rio de Janeiro'', a vessel of 32,000&nbsp;tons, with an armament of 14 in. guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience. (President [[Hermes da Fonseca|Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca]], 3 May 1911, in Robert Scheina, ''Latin America: A Naval History, 1810<U+2013>1987'' [Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987], 354)</span></blockquote>

D'Eyncourt probably avoided proposing any design with 16-inch guns when he saw the political situation. In meetings with Le<U+00E3>o, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the ''Minas Geraes'' class, but a design with no less than ''fourteen'' 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the ''Minas Geraes'' class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.<ref>Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 280.</ref>

After numerous requests for design alterations from the Brazilian Navy were accommodated or rejected, a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12-inch guns on 3 June 1911 for <U+00A3>2,675,000, and ''Rio de Janeiro''{{'}}s keel was laid for the fourth time on 14 September. It did not take long for the Brazilian government to reconsider their decision again;<ref>Topliss, "The Brazilian Dreadnought," 284.</ref> by mid-1912, battleships with 14-inch guns were under construction, and suddenly it seemed that ''Rio de Janeiro'' would be outclassed upon completion.<ref name="Vanterpool, The Riachuelo, 140">Vanterpool, "The 'Riachuelo'," 140.</ref> Making matters worse, a European depression after the end of the [[Second Balkan War]] in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans. This coincided with a collapse in Brazil's coffee and rubber exports, the latter due to the loss of the [[Rubber boom#The end of the Amazon's rubber monopoly|Brazilian rubber monopoly]] to British plantations in the Far East. The price of coffee declined by 20% and Brazilian exports of it dropped 12.5% between 1912 and 1913; rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36.6%, respectively.<ref>Martin, ''Latin America and the War'', 36&ndash;37.</ref>

Armstrong studied whether replacing the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting to sell the ship. In the tension building up to the First World War, plenty of countries, including Russia, Italy, France, Greek, and the Ottoman Empire, were willing to purchase the ship. Russia and Italy dropped out, and Greece made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional <U+00A3>50,000. As they worked to obtain the money, the Ottomans, with a loan from a French banker independent of his government, were able to secure the ship as-is for <U+00A3>1,200,000 on 29 December 1913. As part of the purchase contract, the remainder of the ship was constructed with Ottoman money. Renamed ''Sultan Osman I'', she was eventually taken over by the British shortly after the beginning of the First World War, serving with the Royal Navy as [[HMS Agincourt (1913)|HMS ''Agincourt'']].<ref>Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 284, 286.</ref>

The Argentine government authorized a third dreadnought in October 1912 in case ''Rio de Janeiro'' was completed and delivered, but the ship was never named or built.<ref name=Scheina321>Scheina, ''Latin America'', 321.</ref>

== Decline and end of the arms race ==
=== ''Riachuelo'' ===
After selling ''Rio de Janeiro'', the Brazilian government asked Armstrong and Vickers to prepare more designs for a new battleship. They replied with at least fourteen designs, six from Vickers (December 1913 through March 1914) and eight from Armstrong (February 1914). Vickers' designs varied between eight and ten 15-inch and eight 16-inch guns, with speeds between 22 and 25&nbsp;knots (the lower-end ships having mixed firing, the higher using oil), and displacements between {{convert|26000|t|LT}} and {{convert|30500|t|LT}}. Armstrong took two basic designs, one with eight and the other with ten 15-inch guns, and varied their speed and firing.<ref name="Topliss285-86">Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 285<U+2013>86.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Topliss (1985), in writing a design history of the four Brazilian dreadnoughts, makes no mention of Vanterpool's (1969) article, which detailed four substantially different designs prepared in October 1913 by Armstrong. Sturton (1970), whose article was written in direct reply to Vanterpool, found that designs were submitted after that date and that one, bearing little resemblance to anything uncovered by Vanterpool, was ordered. Topliss, on whose research this paragraph is largely based, appears to have expanded upon Sturton's work, but does not include the designs detailed by Vanterpool, even though his article is listed in Topliss' sources.|group=upper-alpha}} The Brazilian government chose what was labeled as Design 781, the first of the eight 15-inch designs tendered by Armstrong, which also shared characteristics with the [[Queen Elizabeth class battleship|''Queen Elizabeth'']] and {{Sclass|Revenge|battleship|4}}es then being built for the United Kingdom.<ref name="Topliss285-86"/><ref name=Sturton>Sturton, "Re: The Riachuelo," 205.</ref>

The Brazilian government placed an order for one ship of this design, to be named ''Riachuelo'', at the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard in [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]] on 12 May 1914.<ref name="Topliss285-86"/><ref>"E Rio de Janeiro," ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Most sources do not mention that Brazil ordered a battleship;<ref name=Sturton/> ''Conway's'' even remarks that "Brazil had not selected from the four design variations".<ref>Scheina, "Brazil," 405.</ref>|group=upper-alpha}} Some preliminary work was completed for ''Riachuelo'', but the ship's keel had not been laid by the time the United Kingdom declared war on the [[Central Powers]] in August 1914, and ''Riachuelo'' was never constructed.<ref name="Topliss285-86"/>

=== Attempted sales ===
After ''Rio de Janeiro'' was sold to the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would be devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the [[Argentine National Congress]] in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Ottoman, Italian, and Grecian governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of ''Rio de Janeiro''.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 46<U+2013>47.</ref><ref>"[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=PBH19140103.2.48 Turkey and Greece; Purpose of Dreadnoughts]," ''Poverty Bay Herald'', 2 January 1914, 3.</ref><ref name="Argentine Pride">"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-04-27/ed-1/seq-3/ Argentine Pride Outweighs $6,000,000 Profit Greece Offers for Moreno]," ''New-York Tribune'', 27 April 1913.</ref> The ''New-York Tribune'' reported that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5&nbsp;million offer for ''Moreno'' alone, which would have netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12&nbsp;million).<ref name="Argentine Pride"/> The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 47.</ref>

In each of the countries involved in the South American dreadnought arms race, movements arose that advocated the sale of the dreadnoughts to devote the money toward more worthy pursuits.<ref name=Livermore45>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 45.</ref> The costs for the ships were rightfully viewed as enormous. After the ''Minas Geraes'' class was ordered, a Brazilian newspaper equated the initial purchase cost for the three ships as equaling 3,125 miles of [[Track (rail transport)|railroad tracks]] or 30,300 [[Homestead (buildings)|homesteads]]. Naval historian Robert Scheina put the price at [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]6,110,100 without accounting for ammunition, which was <U+00A3>605,520, or necessary upgrades to docks, which was <U+00A3>832,000. Costs for maintenance and related issues, which in the first five years of ''Minas Geraes''{{'}}s and ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo''{{'}}s commissioned lives was about 60 percent of the initial cost, only added to the already staggering sum of money.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 86.</ref> The two ''Rivadavia''s were purchased for about a fifth of the Argentine government's yearly income, a figure which did not include the later in-service costs.<ref name=Hough19/> Historian [[Robert K. Massie]] rounded the figure to a quarter of each government's annual income.<ref>Massie, ''Castles'', 22.</ref>

In addition, the nationalistic sentiments that exacerbated the naval arms race had given way to slowing economies and growing public opinion that supported investing inside the country.<ref name=Livermore45/> Commenting on this, the United States' [[United States Ambassador to Chile|Minister to Chile]], [[Henry Prather Fletcher]], wrote to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Jennings Bryan]]: "Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were none too good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries that perhaps they are much more in need of money than of battleships."<ref>Fletcher to Bryan, No. 454, Feb. 16, 1914, S.D.F., Chile, in Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 45.</ref>

=== Post-war expansions ===
After the First World War, the dreadnought race never resumed, but many plans for post-war naval expansions and improvements were attempted by the Argentine, Brazilian, and Chilean governments. As part of an overall scheme to regain naval superiority in the region, the Argentines sent ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' to the United States in 1924 and 1926 to be modernized. Also, a large naval building program in support of this goal was launched in 1926, three cruisers (the Italian-built [[Veinticinco de Mayo class cruiser|''Veinticinco de Mayo'' class]] and the British-built [[ARA La Argentina|''La Argentina]]), twelve destroyers (the Spanish-built [[Churruca class destroyer|''Churruca'' class]] and the British-built [[Mendoza class destroyer|''Mendoza'']]/[[Buenos Aires class destroyer|''Buenos Aires'']] classes), and three submarines (the Italian-built [[Santa Fe class submarine|''Santa Fe'' class]]) were acquired.<ref>English, ''Armed Forces'', 38<U+2013>39.</ref>

The Brazilian government modernized ''Minas Geraes'', ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', and the two cruisers acquired under the 1904 plan, [[Brazilian cruiser Bahia|''Bahia'']] and [[Brazilian cruiser Rio Grande do Sul|''Rio Grande do Sul'']], between 1918 and 1925.<ref name="English, Armed Forces, 110">English, ''Armed Forces'', 110.</ref> They also made plans to acquire additional ships in the 1920s and '30s, but both were sharply reduced from the original proposals. In 1924, a proposal for the construction of a relatively modest number of warships (a heavy cruiser, and five destroyers) and five submarines was floated. In the same year, the newly arrived American naval mission, led by Rear Admiral [[Carl Theodore Vogelgesang]], tendered a naval expansion plan of 151,000&nbsp;tons, divided between battleships (70,000), cruisers (60,000), destroyers (15,000), and submarines (6,000). The United States' State Department, led by Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]], was fresh from negotiating the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and not keen on seeing another dreadnought race, so Hughes quickly moved to thwart the efforts of the mission. Only one Italian-built submarine, [[Brazilian submarine Humayt<U+00E1>|''Humayt<U+00E1>'']], was acquired under this plan.<ref name="English, Armed Forces, 110"/><ref name="Livermore48"/><ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 135<U+2013>36.</ref>

''Minas Geraes'' was modernized at the [[Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard]] from June 1931 to 1938,<ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 27.</ref><ref name="Topliss289">Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 289.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The 1938 date is somewhat variable, as the ship returned to active duty in 1938, but the modernization was not completed until 1940.<ref name="Topliss289"/> Other sources give different dates for the modernization, such as 1934 to 1937.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 153.</ref><ref>Breyer, ''Battleships'', 320<U+2013>21.</ref>|group=upper-alpha}} but ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo''{{'}}s poor material condition made any similar action uneconomical.<ref name="Breyer321">Breyer, ''Battleships'', 321.</ref><ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 29.</ref> During the same period, the Brazilian government looked into purchasing cruisers from the United States Navy but ran into the restrictions of the Washington and [[London Naval Treaty|London Naval Treaties]], which prevented the sale of used warships to foreign countries. They also tried to purchase destroyers from the United States, but eventually contracted for six destroyers from the United Kingdom.{{#tag:ref|These were taken over after the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and became the [[G and H class destroyer#Havant class 2|''Havant'' class]].<ref name="Scheina136-137"/>|group=upper-alpha}} In the interim, a plan to lease six destroyers from the United States Navy was abandoned after it was met with strong opposition from both international and American institutions.<ref name="Scheina136-137">Scheina, ''Naval History'', 136<U+2013>37.</ref> Three [[Marcilio Dias class destroyer|''Marcilio Dias''-class destroyers]], based on the American [[Mahan class destroyer|''Mahan'' class]], were laid down in Brazil with six minelayers, all of which were launched between 1939 and 1941. Though both programs required foreign assistance to complete and were consequently delayed by the war, all nine ships were completed by 1944.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 327.</ref>

Chile began to seek additional ships to bolster its fleet in 1919, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered many of its surplus warships. This action worried nearby nations, who feared that a Chilean attempt to become the region's most powerful navy would destabilize the area and start another naval arms race.<ref name="Livermore48">Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 48.</ref><ref>Graser Schornstheimer, "[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04E6DF173AE532A25751C2A96E9C946195D6CF Chile as a Naval Power]," ''New York Times'', 22 August 1920, X10.</ref> Chile asked for ''Canada'' and ''Eagle'', the two battleships they ordered before the war, but the cost of converting the latter back to a battleship was too high.<ref name="Preston70"/><ref>Brown, "HMS ''Eagle''," 251.</ref> Planned replacements included the two remaining {{Sclass|Invincible|battlecruiser|1}}s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar within Chile itself over the value of such ships.<ref>Somervell, "Naval Affairs," 393<U+2013>94.</ref> In the end, Chile only bought ''Canada'' and four destroyers in April 1920.

At the beginning of the Second World War, the three major South American navies found themselves unable to acquire major warships. With the end, the United States and United Kingdom had many ships that were unnecessary or surplus to the requirements of their post-war navies. Still, the South American countries ran into political difficulties in acquiring anything larger than [[Flower class corvette|''Flower''-class corvettes]] and [[River class frigate|''River''-class frigates]]. The war had proved the obsolete status of battleships, so the navies were seeking cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, which they were finally able to acquire when the [[Red Scare]] began to strongly affect American and international politics. One of the deals reached under the [[Mutual Defense Assistance Act]] (1949) sold six American light cruisers to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in January 1951.{{#tag:ref|Most of the cruisers transferred were from the [[Brooklyn class cruiser|''Brooklyn'' class]], but one of Brazil's cruisers ([[USS St. Louis (CL-49)|''Almirante Tamandar<U+00E9>'']]) was from the slightly improved [[St. Louis class cruiser (1938)|''St. Louis'' class]].|group=upper-alpha}} While this bolstered the navies of important South American allies of the United States, which would be [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance|treaty-bound]] to assist the United States in any war, naval historian Robert Scheina argues that the American government also used the opportunity to significantly affect the traditional naval rivalry among the three countries:

<blockquote><span style="font-size:90%;">While more than ninety percent of the aid provided under [the Mutual Defense Assistance Act] went to European and Asian countries, the United States, now the dominant foreign power in Latin America, used surplus ships as a tool to further mutual interests ... and reshape the Latin American naval panorama. Thus Argentina's pre-World War II formula that she had to possess a fleet equal in strength to the combined fleets of Brazil and Chile changed in one stroke to 1A = 1B = 1C. (Robert Scheina, ''Latin America: A Naval History, 1810<U+2013>1987'' [Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987], 173)</span></blockquote>

With the influx of relatively modern warships, the battleships of the three countries were sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in the 1950s. The Brazilian ships were disposed of first; ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was sold in 1951, and was lost in a storm north of the [[Azores]] while being towed to her final destination.<ref name="OfficialPaulo"/><ref>"E S<U+00E3>o Paulo," ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.</ref> ''Minas Geraes'' was sold two years later and broken up in [[Genoa]] beginning in 1954.<ref>"E Minas Geraes," ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.</ref> Of the Argentine dreadnoughts, ''Rivadavia'' was scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959, while ''Moreno'' was brought to Japan in 1957.<ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 21<U+2013>22.</ref> ''Almirante Latorre'', inactive since 1951, followed ''Moreno'' to Japan in 1959.<ref name=Armada/><ref name="WhitleyBattleships" />

== Historiography ==
[[File:Minas Geraes from bow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Minas Geraes'' seen from the bow; the [[wing turret]]s are on either side of the superstructure]]
The [[historiography]], or works published on a specific topic, behind the South American dreadnought race is relatively small in number and coverage, especially in English. General maritime histories on the period (c. 1904<U+2013>14) avoid the area and focus on the traditional powers, especially the [[World War I naval arms race|Anglo-German arms race]]. The more specific English-language works on the period that do cover South America tend to summarize the region's dreadnought race, focus on the ships built rather than their implications, or look at the closely related [[Revolt of the Lash]] (''Revolta da Chibata''). Seward Livermore, writing from [[Brown University]], looked at the race about thirty years after its conclusion from an American perspective. This meant he gave emphasis to the Argentine order, the role of the American government in obtaining it, and the attempts to obtain the Chilean order. Livermore was mildly critical of the arms race for its destabilizing effects:

<blockquote><span style="font-size:90%;">As a means of promoting closer cooperation or understanding between the two hemispheres the international armament business was of very dubious worth. The peddling of war material to small but quarrelsome nations was fraught with too many unpleasant and unpredictable consequences. Battleship diplomacy had been a novel departure in American statecraft; some material success had been achieved, but the net result, from the standpoint of the imponderable factors, was most unsatisfactorily disappointing. (Seward Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy in South America: 1905<U+2013>1925," ''Journal of Modern History'' 16, no. 1 (1944): 48)</span></blockquote>

British maritime historian [[Richard Hough]], writing in 1966, remarked on the huge cost of the warships and expressed disbelief that the countries thought they could afford the ships in the first place, let alone maintain them as the years went by. He also wondered as to the original purpose of Brazil's ships, as in his view the relations between Brazil and its naval rivals, Argentina and Chile, were quite good given prior context. As Hough saw the situation, the only ones to gain from the whole arms race were the armament companies involved in the ships' construction.<ref>Hough, ''Big Battleship'', 16<U+2013>17.</ref>

Robert Scheina, a Latin American naval historian, devoted a chapter of his 1987 book, ''Latin America: A Naval History, 1810<U+2013>1987'', to the dreadnought race. Although this was one of the first comprehensive works on the topic of Latin American maritime history, it was criticized by some reviewers for trying to fit too much information into too short a space.<ref>Sater, "''Latin America''," 592.</ref><ref>Waddell, "Robert L. Scheina," 509.</ref> This shows in the dreadnought race's coverage, which was dwarfed by more recent events, especially the [[Falklands War]] (seven pages versus fifty-five).<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80<U+2013>87, 234<U+2013>289.</ref> Still, Scheina included a small conclusion to the chapter, where  he outlined 'lessons' learned by the three countries in the dreadnought race. Like Hough, he highlighted the exorbitant maintenance costs of the dreadnoughts. In addition, they were meant to be used against other dreadnoughts, but as soon as the traditional powers built dreadnoughts in large numbers, the ones owned by Argentina, Brazil, and Chile were much less of a threat. Last, Scheina pointed out the benefits of international attention, in the form of military alliances, brought by the dreadnoughts, but also noted that this resulted in the same outcome as lesson two<U+2014>as the years went on, the ships dwindled in importance.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 86<U+2013>87.</ref>

Brazilian historian Jo<U+00E3>o Roberto Martins Filho utilized British and Brazilian archival material to focus on the Brazilian dreadnoughts in his Portuguese-language book, ''A Marinha Brasileira na Era dos Encoura<U+00E7>ados, 1895<U+2013>1910'', or ''The Brazilian Navy in the Era of Dreadnoughts''. He took a very different approach and demonstrated that the Brazilian Navy was not ready for the disruptive influence of modern vessels. By focusing on acquiring the powerful new dreadnoughts, rather than adequately training the huge amounts of manpower needed to crew the ships&mdash;a third of the entire navy&mdash;or the maintenance necessary to keep the dreadnoughts operational, the navy was without the ability to conduct serious operations soon after their delivery.<ref>Martins, ''A Marinha Brasileira'', 201.</ref><ref>de Almeida, "''A Marinha Brasileira''," 164.</ref><ref>Haag, "O Almirante Negro," 87.</ref> In addition, he proposes that the dreadnoughts' modern conditions were not compatible with the liberal use of corporal punishment, which provided a crucial spark to the Revolt against the Lash.<ref>Haag, "O Almirante Negro," 85.</ref>

| File:Minas Geraes-class battleships.jpg|The [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|''Minas Geraes'' class]] was designed, constructed, and completed before the other South American dreadnoughts, but was smaller and not as well-armed. Two later dreadnoughts, [[HMS Agincourt (1913)|''Rio de Janeiro'']] and [[#Riachuelo|''Riachuelo'']], were planned to rectify this, but the former was sold to the Ottoman Empire amid falling government revenues, and the other was not [[keel laying|laid down]] when the First World War broke out and all British shipbuilding for foreign countries was suspended.<ref name="Vanterpool, The Riachuelo, 140"/><ref name=Scheina82>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 82.</ref>
| File:Rivadavia-class battleships.jpg|The [[Rivadavia-class battleship|''Rivadavia'' class]] was the second dreadnought class purchased by a South American country and the only ones to not be built by a British company. Ordered in response to the ''Minas Geraes'' class, they mounted the same-size [[main battery]] as the Brazilian ships (12-inch), but the Argentine ships were much larger and significantly better-armored.<ref name="Conways404"/><ref name="ArgentineConways"/><ref name=Scheina82/>
| File:Brassey's HMS Canada Plan (1915).jpg|[[Almirante Latorre-class battleship|''Almirante Latorre'']] was the last South American dreadnought built, and was larger and better armed than her counterparts. The more efficient arrangement of the five 14-inch turrets, with all mounted on the centerline rather than ''[[en echelon]]'', allowed the main battery to fire on a single [[broadside]] without damaging the ship.<ref name=ConwaysGB>Preston, "Great Britain," 38.</ref><ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 20.</ref>
