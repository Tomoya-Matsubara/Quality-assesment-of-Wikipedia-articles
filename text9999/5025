After retiring from the ICS in 1915, Nathan joined the [[MI5]]'s section dealing with the [[Hindu-German Conspiracy|Indian seditionist movement in Europe]], called [[MI5(g)]], that was formed at the time headed by [[Vernon Kell]].

Nathan's efforts, along with those of [[John Wallinger]]'s [[Indian Political Intelligence Office]] (with whom Nathan worked closely), were key in the British counter-espionage work.<ref name=Popplewell220/> Nathan identified plans by [[Ghadar Party]] and the [[Berlin Committee]] to assassinate [[Lord Kitchener]] in 1915 through an associate of [[Har Dayal]], Gobind Behari Lal.<Ref name=Popplewell224>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=224}}</ref> He was also responsible at this time, along with Basil Thomson, to turn Harish Chandra (who was associated with the [[Berlin committee]]) into a double agent.<ref name=Popplewell227>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=227}}</ref> Nathan was also responsible for the plans made by British intelligence in late 1915 to assassinate [[Virendranath Chattopadhyaya]] through agent Donald Gullick.<ref name=Popplewell229>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=229}}</ref>

==Work in North America==
Later, on instructions from British secret service, Robert Nathan transferred to the Pacific coast of North America where the [[Ghadar Party]] worked closely with the German consulate at San Francisco to obtain arms and men for what came to be known as the [[Ghadar Conspiracy]]. Nathan successfully brought the Ghadarites and staff at the German consulate to trial following the [[Annie Larsen affair|''Annie Larsen'' arms plot]]. He organised the [[Hindu-German conspiracy trial]], which at the time was the longest in American legal history.<ref name=Popplewell236>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=236}}</ref> He was responsible for the arrest of [[Chandrakanta Chakraverty]] and his subsequent interrogation, along with that Ernst Sekunna. Through March 1917, Nathan worked closely with [[William Wiseman]], and negotiated with the [[US State Department]] the details of the case against the Indian conspirators. He strongly supported granting a guarantee to the United States not to be held responsible for violation  of neutrality.<ref name=Popplewell250>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=250}}</ref>

==Later life==
Nathan returned to Britain at the end of World War I where he died in 1921.
