The '''Wow! signal''' was a strong [[narrowband]] [[radio frequency|radio]] signal detected by Jerry R. Ehman on August 15, 1977, while he was working on a [[SETI]] project at [[the Big Ear]] [[radio telescope]] of [[Ohio State University]], then located at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]]'s [[Perkins Observatory]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]]. The signal bore the expected hallmarks of non-[[earth|terrestrial]] and non-[[Solar System]] origin. The signal appears to have come to the northwest of the [[Messier 55|globular cluster of M55]] in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], near the [[Chi Sagittarii]] star group. 

The entire signal sequence lasted for the full 72-[[second]] window that Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected again. The signal has been the subject of significant media attention many a times astronomers have tried in vain to find the signal again. Impressed by the relative resemblance of the expected signature of an interstellar signal in the [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] used, Ehman circled the signal on the computer printout and wrote the comment "Wow!" on its side, the comment  which became the name of the signal itself.

== Background ==
The Wow! signal was detected by Jerry R. Ehman on August 15, 1977, who was working on a SETI project at now-defunct the Big Ear radio telescope of Ohio State University.<ref name="npr">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126510251|title=Aliens Found In Ohio? The 'Wow!' Signal|last=Krulwich|first=Robert|publisher=[[NPR|National Public Radio]]|date=May 29, 2010|accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>  The telescope was then located at Ohio Wesleyan University's [[Perkins Observatory]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]], when Ehman spotted a surprising vertical column with the alphanumerical sequence <U+201C>6EQUJ5,<U+201D> which had occurred at 10:16 p.m. EST. He took a red marker to write "Wow!" in the margin of the printout and encircled the alphanumeric code "6EQUJ5".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/chasing-ufos/articles/what-is-the-wow-signal/ | title=NGC, where's the wow | accessdate=May 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Shuch|first1=Dr. H. Paul|title=SETI Sensitivity: Calibrating on a Wow! Signal|url=http://www.setileague.org/articles/calibwow.htm|website=SETI League|accessdate=22 May 2015|ref=calib-wow}}</ref>

== Interpretation of the paper chart ==
The circled [[alphanumeric]] code "6EQUJ5" describes the [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] variation of the signal. Each character represents 12 seconds (by 10&nbsp;kHz). A [[Space (punctuation)|space]] denotes an intensity between 0 and 1, the numbers 1 to 9 denote the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1.0 to 9.9), and intensities of 10.0 and above are denoted by a letter ('A' corresponds to intensities between 10.0 and 11.0, 'B' to 11.0 to 12.0, etc.). The value 'U' (an intensity between 30.0 and 31.0) was the highest detected by the radio telescope; on a linear scale it was over 30 times louder than normal deep space.<ref name="npr" /> The intensity in this case is the [[Dimensionless quantity|unitless]] [[signal-to-noise ratio]], where noise was averaged for that band over the previous few minutes.<ref name="code">{{cite web | first = Jerry | last = Ehman | title = Explanation of the Code "6EQUJ5" On the Wow! Computer Printout | url = http://www.bigear.org/6equj5.htm | accessdate = 2010-01-01}}</ref>

Two different values for its [[frequency]] have been given: 1420.356 [[MHz]] (J. D. Kraus) and 1420.4556&nbsp;MHz (J. R. Ehman). The frequency of the Wow! signal matches very closely with the [[hydrogen line]], which is at 1420.40575177&nbsp;MHz.  The hydrogen line frequency is significant for SETI searchers because, it is reasoned, hydrogen is the most common element in the universe, and hydrogen resonates at about 1420.40575177&nbsp;MHz, so [[extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrials]] might use that frequency to transmit a strong signal.<ref name="npr" /> The two different values given for the frequency of the Wow! signal (1420.356&nbsp;MHz and 1420.4556&nbsp;MHz) are the same distance apart from the hydrogen line<U+2014>the first being about 0.0498&nbsp;MHz (49.75177&nbsp;kHz) less than the hydrogen line, and the second about 0.0498&nbsp;MHz (49.84823&nbsp;kHz) more. The [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the signal is less than 10 [[kHz]] (each column on the printout corresponds to a 10&nbsp;kHz-wide channel; the signal is present in only one column).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bigear.org/wow20th.htm | title=bigearwow | accessdate=May 24, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Wow signal location.jpg|thumb|400px|The location of the signal in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], near the [[Chi Sagittarii]] star group. Because of the design of the experiment, the location may lie in either one of the two red bands, and there is also significant uncertainty in the declination (vertical axis). For clarity, the widths of the red bands are not drawn to scale; they should actually be narrower.]] The original printout of the Wow! signal, complete with Jerry Ehman's famous exclamation, is preserved by the  [[Ohio Historical Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2010/07/03/wow/|title=Wow!|last=Wood|first=Lisa|publisher=

== Location of the signal ==
Determining a precise location in the sky was complicated by the [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory|Big Ear telescope]]'s use of two [[feed horn]]s to search for signals, each pointing to a slightly different direction in the sky following [[Earth's rotation]]; the Wow! signal was detected in one of the horns but not in the other, and the data was processed in such a way that it is impossible to determine which of the two horns the signal entered.<ref name="feedhorns">{{cite web | url=http://www.bigear.org/hshorns.htm | title=Big Ear's Twin Feed Horns | accessdate=May 24, 2015}}</ref> There are, therefore, two possible [[right ascension]] values:
* 19<sup>h</sup>22<sup>m</sup>24.64<sup>s</sup>&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;5<sup>s</sup> (positive horn)
* 19<sup>h</sup>25<sup>m</sup>17.01<sup>s</sup>&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;5<sup>s</sup> (negative horn)
The [[declination]] was unambiguously determined to be <U+2212>27<U+00B0>03<U+2032>&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;20<U+2032>. The preceding values are all expressed in terms of the [[B1950.0]] [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]].<ref name="gray_2001">{{cite journal | url = http://www.bigear.org/Gray-Marvel.pdf | first = Robert | last = Gray |author2=Kevin Marvel  | title = A VLA Search for the Ohio State 'Wow' | journal = The [[Astrophysical Journal]] | issue=2 | volume = 546 | pages = 1171<U+2013>1177 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1086/318272 | bibcode=2001ApJ...546.1171G}}</ref>

Converted into the J2000.0 [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]], the coordinates become RA= 19<sup>h</sup>25<sup>m</sup>31<sup>s</sup> <U+00B1> 10<sup>s</sup> or 19<sup>h</sup>28<sup>m</sup>22<sup>s</sup>&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;10<sup>s</sup> and the declination becomes <U+2212>26<U+00B0>57<U+2032>&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;20<U+2032>.<ref name="tau">{{cite web | url=http://www.worldlibrary.org/articles/tau_sagittarii | title=Tau World Library | accessdate=May 24, 2015}}</ref> This region of the sky lies in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], roughly 2.5 degrees south of the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|fifth-magnitude]] star group [[Chi Sagittarii]], and about [[Tau Sagittarii|3.5 degrees south]] of the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. [[Tau Sagittarii]] is the closest easily visible star.<ref name="30thwow">{{cite web | url=http://www.bigear.org/Wow30th/wow30th.htm | title=The Big Ear Wow! Signal | accessdate=May 24, 2015}}</ref>

== Time variation ==
[[File:Wow signal profile.svg|thumb|300px|Plot of signal strength vs time]]

The Big Ear telescope was fixed and used the rotation of the Earth to scan the sky. At the speed of the Earth's rotation, and given the width of the Big Ear's observation "window", the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.<ref name="skeptoid">{{cite web | url=http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4342 | title=Skeptoid | accessdate=May 28, 2015}}</ref> A continuous extraterrestrial signal, therefore, would be expected to register for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded intensity of that signal would show a gradual increase for the first 36 seconds<U+2014>peaking when the signal reached the center of Big Ear's observation "window"<U+2014> and then a gradual decrease.<ref name="edn">{{cite web | url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4394137/Big-Ear-receives--Wow--Signal--August-15--1977 | title=EDN Moments | accessdate=May 28, 2015}}</ref>

Therefore, both the length of the Wow! signal, 72 seconds, and the shape of the intensity graph may correspond to an extraterrestrial origin, as opposed to a stray terresterial signal being picked up by the telescope.<ref name="space_com">{{cite news | url = http://www.bigear.org/shostak_wow_20021205.htm | first = Seth | last = Shostak | title = Interstellar Signal From the 70s Continues to Puzzle Researchers | publisher = Space.com | date = 2002-12-05}}</ref>

== Searches for recurrence of the signal ==
Several attempts were made by Ehman as well as by other astronomers to detect and identify the signal again. The signal was expected to appear three minutes apart in each of the horns, but that did not happen.<ref name="space_com" /> Ehman unsuccessfully looked for recurrences using Big Ear in the months after the detection.<ref name="discovery">{{cite news | url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/the-wow-signal-130524.htm | title=The 'Wow!' Signal| publisher=The [[Discovery Channel]] network | accessdate=2015-05-28}}</ref>

In 1987 and 1989, [[Robert H. Gray]] searched for the event using the META array at [[Oak Ridge Observatory]], but did not detect it.<ref name="discovery" /><ref name="gray_2012">{{cite book|title=The Elusive WOW: Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence|last=Gray|first=Robert H|year=2012|publisher=Palmer Square Press|location=Chicago|pages=242 pages|isbn=978-0-9839584-4-4}}</ref> In July 1995 test of signal detection software to be used in its upcoming [[SETI#The SETI League and Project Argus|Project Argus]] search, SETI League executive director [[H. Paul Shuch]] made several drift-scan observations of the Wow! signal's coordinates with a 12-meter radio telescope at the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]], also achieving a null result.

In 1995 and 1996, Gray again searched for the signal using the [[Very Large Array]], which is significantly more sensitive than Big Ear.<ref name="discovery" /><ref name="gray_2012" /> Gray and Simon Ellingsen later searched for recurrences of the event in 1999 using the 26&nbsp;m radio telescope at the [[University of Tasmania]]'s [[Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory]].<ref name="gray_2002">{{cite journal | url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/342646 | first = Robert | last = Gray |author2=S.

== Speculation on the signal's origin ==
[[Interstellar space|Interstellar]] [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]] of a weaker [[continuous signal]]<U+2014>similar in effect to [[Scintillation (astronomy)|atmospheric twinkling]]<U+2014>could be an explanation, but that would not exclude the possibility of the signal's being artificial in origin. But even the significantly more sensitive [[Very Large Array]] did not detect the signal, and the [[probability]] that a signal below the Very Large Array level could be detected by the Big Ear due to interstellar scintillation is low.<ref name="discovery" /> Other speculations include a rotating lighthouse-like source, a signal sweeping in frequency, or a one-time burst.<ref name="gray_2001" />

Ehman has voiced doubts that the signal was of intelligent [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin: "We should have seen it again when we looked for it 50 times. Something suggests it was an Earth-sourced signal that simply got reflected off a piece of [[space debris]]."<ref name="cleveland_plain_dealer">{{cite news | url = http://www.bigear.org/wow.htm | first = Barry | last = Kawa | publisher = Cleveland Plain Dealer | date = 1994-09-18 | title = The Wow! signal | accessdate = 2006-06-12}}</ref> He later recanted his skepticism somewhat, after further research showed an Earth-borne signal to be very unlikely, given the requirements of a space-borne reflector being bound to certain unrealistic requirements to sufficiently explain the signal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigear.org/wow20th.htm|author=Jerry R.

Signal: What We Know and Don't Know About It After 20 Years", Ehman resists "drawing vast conclusions from half-vast data"<U+2014>acknowledging the possibility that the source may have been military or otherwise a product of Earth-bound humans.<ref>Frank, Adam (July 10, 2012).
