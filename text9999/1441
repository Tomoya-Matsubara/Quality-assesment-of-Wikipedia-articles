==Career==

Grant was added to the first team squad during the 2007-2008 season by [[Alan Buckley]] and was offered a new contract for the following season.

In an interview to the [[Grimsby Telegraph]] on [[9 December]] Normington commented at his relief at his chances under the new manager, stating that [[Alan Buckley]] failed to help his in his career.

"The feedback from the gaffer has been positive.

"When the old manager was here, he didn't talk to me as much and didn't help me out as much.

"Alan Buckley didn't really give me a chance - not even a sniff.

"I wasn't even on the bench sometimes - even when there were seven subs in the cup, he named just six.

"Since Mike Newell got here, he has been great with me.

"He helps me and tells me my chance will come and this contract backs that up."<ref>http://www.sportgrimsby.co.uk/football/grimsby_town/mariners_news/displayarticle.php?ID=6845</ref>
