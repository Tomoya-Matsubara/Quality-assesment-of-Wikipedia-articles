'''Agis I''' was a son of [[Eurysthenes]], founder of the [[Kings of Sparta|Agiad dynasty]] ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], III, 2.1). His genealogy was traced through [[Aristodemus]], Aristomachus, Cleodaeus and Hyllus to [[Heracles]] ([[Herodotus]] 7, 204), and he belongs rather to mythology than to history.  Tradition ascribed to him the capture of the maritime town of Helos, which resisted his attempt to curtail its guaranteed rights, and the institution of the class of serfs called [[Helots]].
