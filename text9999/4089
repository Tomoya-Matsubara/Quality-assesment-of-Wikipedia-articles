The '''cutthroat trout''' {{nowrap|(''Oncorhynchus clarki'')}} is a fish species of the [[salmonidae]] [[Family (biology)|family]] native to cold-water [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Pacific Ocean, [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Great Basin]] in North America. As a member of the genus ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'', it is one of the Pacific [[trout]], a group that includes the widely distributed [[rainbow trout]]. Cutthroat trout are popular [[gamefish]], especially among [[Angling|angler]]s who enjoy [[fly fishing]]. The common name "cutthroat" refers to the distinctive red coloration on the underside of the [[Mandible|lower jaw]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''clarki'' was given to honor explorer [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]], coleader of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].

Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] in small to moderately large, clear, well-[[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenated]], shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They also reproduce in clear, cold, moderately deep lakes. They are native to the [[Alluvium|alluvial]] or [[freestone stream]]s that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. Cutthroat trout spawn in the spring and may inadvertently but naturally [[hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] with rainbow trout, producing fertile [[cutbow]]s. Some [[population]]s of the coastal cutthroat trout {{nowrap|(''O. c. clarki'')}} are [[anadromous|semi-anadromous]].

Several [[subspecies]] of cutthroat trout are currently listed as [[threatened species|threatened]] in their native ranges due to [[habitat loss]] and the [[introduced species|introduction]] of non-native species. Two subspecies, {{nowrap|''O. c. alvordensis''}} and {{nowrap|''O. c. macdonaldi''}}, are considered [[extinct]]. Cutthroat trout are raised in [[fish hatchery|hatcheries]] to restore populations in their native range, as well as stock non-native lake environments to support angling. The cutthroat trout type species and several subspecies are the [[List of U.S. state fish|official state fish]] of seven western U.S. states.

The scientific name of the cutthroat trout is {{nowrap|''Oncorhynchus clarki''}}. Cutthroat trout were the first [[New World]] trout encountered by Europeans when in 1541, Spanish explorer [[Francisco de Coronado]] recorded seeing trout in the [[Pecos River]] near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].

As one of Lewis and Clark's many missions was to describe the flora and fauna encountered during their expedition, cutthroat trout were given the name {{nowrap|''Salmo clarki''}} in honor of William Clark.<ref name=richardson/> In 1836, the [[type specimen]] of {{nowrap|''S. clarki''}} was described by naturalist [[John Richardson (naturalist)|John Richardson]] from a tributary of the lower [[Columbia River]], identified as the "Katpootl",<ref name=richardson/> which was perhaps the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] as there was a [[Multnomah (tribe)|Multnomah]] village of similar name at the [[confluence]].

In 1989, [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] studies indicated trout of the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific basin]] were genetically closer to Pacific salmon (''Oncorhynchus'' species) than to the ''[[Salmo]]s''<U+2013>[[brown trout]] {{nowrap|(''S. trutta'')}} or [[Atlantic salmon]] {{nowrap|(''S. salar'')}} of the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic basin]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Classification and Scientific Names of Rainbow and Cutthroat Trouts|journal=Fisheries|author4=Gerald R.

===Subspecies===
The 14 recognized [[subspecies]] of cutthroat trout are each native to a separate geographic area. Scientists believe the cutthroat trout evolved from a common ''Oncorhynchus'' ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and [[Snake River|Snake]] river basins 3-5&nbsp;million years ago, in the late [[Pliocene]] or early [[Pleistocene]] epochs. These epochs had repeated [[glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki>{{cite book|last1=Behnke|first1=Robert J.|authorlink=Robert J.

==Description==
[[File:Yellowstone cutthroat trout slash.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of cutthroat trout head with red throat slashes|Head of Yellowstone cutthroat trout {{nowrap|''O. c. bouvieri''}}, showing characteristic red throat slashes]]
Throughout their native and introduced ranges, cutthroat trout vary widely in size, coloration and habitat selection. Their coloration can range from golden to gray to green on the back. Cutthroat trout can generally be distinguished from rainbow trout by the presence of [[Branchial arch|basibranchial teeth]] at the base of tongue and a [[maxilla]]ry that extends beyond the posterior edge of the eye.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trotter|first=Patrick C.|title=Cutthroat: Native Trout of the West|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA |year=2008|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-520-25458-9|page=16}}</ref> Depending on subspecies, [[Strain (biology)|strain]] and habitat, most have distinctive red, pink, or orange linear marks along the underside of their [[mandible]]s in the lower folds of the [[gill]] plates. These markings are responsible for the common name "cutthroat", first given to the trout by outdoor writer [[Charles Hallock]] in an 1884 article in ''The American Angler''.<ref name=Trotter>{{cite book |last=Trotter|first=Patrick C.|title=Cutthroat: Native Trout of the West|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|year=2008|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-520-25458-9|page=13}}</ref> These markings are not unique to the species, some coastal rainbow trout {{nowrap|(''Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus'')}} and [[Columbia River redband trout]] {{nowrap|(''O. m. gairdneri'')}} populations also display reddish or pink throat markings.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/>

At maturity, different populations and subspecies of cutthroat trout can range from {{convert|6|to|40|in|cm}} in length, depending on habitat and food availability. Sea-run forms of coastal cutthroat trout average {{convert|2|to|5|lbs|kg|1}}. The length and weights of mature inland forms vary widely depending on their particular environment and availability of food. Stream-resident fish are much smaller, {{convert|0.4|to|3.2|oz|g}}, while [[lake|lacustrine]] populations have attained weights ranging from {{convert|12|to|17|lbs|kg|abbr=on}} in ideal conditions.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/> The largest cutthroat trout subspecies is the Lahontan cutthroat trout {{nowrap|(''O. c. henshawi'')}}. These fish average {{convert|8|to|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} in small streams and {{convert|8|to|22|in|cm|abbr=on}} in larger rivers and lakes. In ideal environments, the Lahontan cutthroat trout attains typical weights of {{convert|0.25|to|8|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/> The world record cutthroat trout is a Lahontan at {{convert|39|in|cm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|41|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IGFA/>

===Lifecycle===
Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with [[gravel]] bottoms. They are native to the alluvial or [[freestone stream]]s typical of tributaries of the Pacific Basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. They spawn in the spring, as early as February in coastal rivers and as late as July in high mountain lakes and streams. Spawning begins when water temperatures reach {{convert|43|to|46|F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki-141>{{cite book|last1=Behnke|first1=Robert J.|authorlink=Robert J.

The female selects the site for and excavates the redd. Females, depending on size, lay between 200 and 4,400&nbsp;eggs. Eggs are fertilized with milt (sperm) by an attending male.

Cutthroat trout are [[List of feeding behaviours|opportunistic feeders]]. Stream-resident cutthroat trout primarily feed on [[larva]]l, [[pupa]]l and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically [[Caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[Plecoptera|stoneflies]], [[mayflies]] and aquatic [[fly|diptera]]ns), and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically [[ant]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[grasshopper]]s and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]s) that fall into the water, fish eggs, small fish, along with crayfish, shrimp and other crustaceans. As they grow the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. In saltwater estuaries and along beaches, Coastal cutthroat trout feed on small fish such as [[sculpin]]s, [[sand lance]], [[Salmon|salmon fry]] and [[herring]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson|first=Les|title=Fly-Fishing Coastal Cutthroat Trout: Flies, Techniques, Conservation |publisher=Frank Amato Publishers|location=Portland, OR|year=2004|isbn=978-1-57188-334-6 |chapter=Life History of the the Coastal Cutthroat |pages=21<U+2013>26}}</ref> They also consume [[shrimp]], small [[squid]] and [[krill]].

Various subspecies of cutthroat trout are raised in commercial, state and federal [[fish hatchery|hatcheries]] for introduction into suitable native and non-native riverine and lacustrine environments. In the early 20th century, several hatcheries were established in Yellowstone National Park by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]].

The historic native range of cutthroat trout has been reduced by [[overfishing]], urbanization and habitat loss due to mining, livestock grazing and logging. Population densities have been reduced and in some cases populations have disappeared though competition with non-native [[brook trout|brook]], brown, lake and rainbow trout, [[kokanee salmon]], [[lake whitefish]] and [[Mysida|mysis shrimp]] which were introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki-147>{{cite book|last1=Behnke|first1=Robert J.|authorlink=Robert J.

===Interspecific and intraspecific breeding===

The most serious impact on the genetic purity of most cutthroat trout subspecies results from interspecific and intraspecific breeding resulting in hybrids that carry the [[gene]]s of both parents. In inland populations, the introduction of rainbow trout from hatchery stocks have resulted in cutbow hybrids that continue to diminish the genetic purity of many cutthroat trout subspecies. The introduction of hatchery-raised Yellowstone cutthroat trout into native ranges of other cutthroat trout subspecies, particularly the westslope cutthroat trout, has resulted in intraspecific breeding and diminished genetic purity of the westslope subspecies. As such, populations of genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout are very rare and localized in streams above barriers to upstream migrations by introduced species.<ref name=Halverson/> Fisheries biologist [[Robert J. Behnke]] attributes the extinction of the yellowfin cutthroat trout {{nowrap|(''O. c. macdonaldi'')}} and Alvord cutthroat trout {{nowrap|(''O. c. alvordensis'')}} subspecies to the introduction of non-native rainbow trout.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki-201>{{cite book|last1=Behnke |first1=Robert J.|title=Trout and Salmon of North America|author2=Tomelleri, Joseph R.

The population at the core of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout's native range, in Yellowstone Lake, declined significantly in the 1960s due to overharvest of mature cutthroat trout by anglers, as well as overharvesting of eggs by hatcheries in the early 20th century.

In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in [[drift boat]]s float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson|first=Les |title=Fly-Fishing Coastal Cutthroat Trout: Flies, Techniques, Conservation|publisher=Frank Amato Publishers|location=Portland, OR|year=2004|isbn= 978-1-57188-334-6 |chapter=Coastal Cutthroat Trout in Washington|pages=45<U+2013>55}}</ref> In addition to a cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/subsistence/board/index.cfm |title=Federal Subsistence Board |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2014-03-04}}</ref> manages coastal cutthroat trout [[Artisan fishing|subsistence]] fisheries in Southeast Alaska.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/columbiariver/cctsym/ppt/ppt6.pdf|title=The Status and Management of Coastal Cutthroat Trout in Alaska|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|accessdate=2014-03-03|format=pdf}}</ref>

[[Yellowstone National Park]] was established in 1872. By the 1890s, the Yellowstone cutthroat trout fishery in the [[Yellowstone River]] and Yellowstone Lake were well known and being promoted in national guidebooks.
<small>{{quotation| Fishing Grounds.<U+2014>In the river at the lake outlet are the fishing grounds, about a mile from the hotel, while at many places between the lake and canyon excellent fishing is had from shore. The best results in the outlet are had from row boats; they can be rented from the steamboat company who have a supply, as well as competent and experienced oarsmen. Not more than two can successfully fish from one boat. When the grounds are reached, have the oarsman occupy the "stern," as from this position he can manipulate the landing net to a better advantage, the anchor is attached to the "bow." During the trout season (July to September), no better fishing can be found. They average about one and one-half pounds each and are of the salmon myhiss [sic] variety<U+2014>a catch of 100, three or four hours before sundown, is not unfrequent.| A. B.

In 1902, anticipating the completion of the east entrance road from Cody, Wyoming, Captain [[Hiram M. Chittenden]] supervised the construction of the first "Fishing Bridge" across the outlet of Yellowstone Lake.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nature and Culture at Fishing Bridge-A History of the Fishing Bridge Development in Yellowstone National Park|author=Schullery, Paul |authorlink=Paul Schullery|publisher= National Park Service, Yellowstone Center for Resources Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming|year=2010 |url=http://www.greateryellowstonescience.org/sites/default/files/Fishing%20Bridge%20History%20low%205-7-10.pdf|chapter=The Cody Road and First Bridge|pages=17<U+2013>23|format=pdf}}</ref> Fishing Bridge was rebuilt in 1919, and reconstructed in
1937, primarily to accommodate vehicle traffic. Between 1916 and 1931, a large development of campgrounds, cabins, stores and service facilities were built just east of the bridge to support anglers. This area is now known as the Fishing Bridge Historic District.<ref>{{cite book |title= Nature and Culture at Fishing Bridge-A History of the Fishing Bridge Development in Yellowstone National Park |author=Schullery, Paul|authorlink=Paul Schullery|publisher= National Park Service, Yellowstone Center for Resources Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming|year=2010 |url=http://www.greateryellowstonescience.org/sites/default/files/Fishing%20Bridge%20History%20low%205-7-10.pdf|pages=25<U+2013>50|chapter=The Development of the Fishing Bridge Area, 1918<U+2013>1941|format=pdf}}</ref> The 1937 bridge boasted pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway to give more room to anglers. Angling in the river, at Fishing Bridge and in the lake, boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and over harvest caused a significant decline in the fishery. Consequently, in 1973, fishing was no longer permitted from Fishing Bridge.<ref name=Grand1950s>{{Cite journal|last=Franke |first=Mary Ann |authorlink= |date=Winter 1997 |title=A Grand Experiment<U+2014>The Tide Turns in the 1950s: Part II |journal=Yellowstone Science |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=9 |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/vol5-1.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-04-09}}</ref>

===Pyramid Lake Lahontan subspecies fishery===
[[File:Pyramid Lake Lahontan Cutthroat Fishery.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of angler on ladder in lake|Angler fishing for Lahontan cutthroat trout in Pyramid Lake, Nevada]]
The Pyramid Lake strain of Lahontan cutthroat trout, source of the {{convert|41|lbs|adj=on}} world record and native to Pyramid Lake, Lake Tahoe and the Truckee River, was brought to near-extinction in the two decades between the 1920s-40s from overharvest, introduced species and loss of spawning habitat. In the 1970s, Pyramid Lake was stocked with Lahontan cutthroat trout strains still surviving in some nearby lakes, but they were not the large Pyramid Lake strain. Although the [[Paiute people|Paiute tribe]] had been successful in reestablishing a cutthroat trout fishery on the reservation in Pyramid Lake, the cutthroat trout were not the large fish of the late 19th and early 20th century. In the late 1970, biologists discovered a surviving population of a pure Pyramid Lake strain in a small headwaters stream on the Nevada-Utah border that had at some point around 1900 been introduced into the stream. In 1995, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began rearing these fish in the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/lahontannfhc/lnfh.html|title=Lahontan National Fish Hatchery |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=2014-03-04}}</ref> in [[Gardnerville, Nevada]]. In 2006, the Pyramid Lake strain of Lahontan cutthroat trout were reintroduced into the lake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/us/lahontan-cutthroat-trout-make-a-comeback.html?_r=0|title=20 Pounds? Not Too Bad, for an Extinct Fish |publisher=New York Times |author=Schweber, Nate|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> As Pyramid Lake has a very shallow shoreline, anglers use ladders to stand comfortably in {{convert|3|to|4|ft|m|1}} of water and cast to trout cruising along shoreline breaks. Considered a "world-class" fishery, anglers routinely catch cutthroat trout exceeding {{convert|10|lbs|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pyramidlakefisheries.org/|title=Pyramid Lake Fisheries|publisher=Pyramid Lake Fisheries.org|accessdate=2014-03-03 |quote=Pyramid Lake is widely regarded as a world class fishery for the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout.}}</ref>
