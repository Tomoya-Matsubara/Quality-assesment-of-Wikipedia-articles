'''''Griseosphinx preechari''''' is a [[moth]] of the [[Sphingidae]] family. It is known from southern [[China]] to northern, western and central [[Thailand]], and into [[Burma]]. <ref>[http://tpittaway.tripod.com/china/g_pre.htm Sphingidae of the Eastern Palaearctic]</ref>

The length of the forewings is 24-30 mm for males and 25-20 mm for females. It is similar to ''[[Pseudodolbina]]'' species but distinguishable by the presence of the field of microtrichia on the inner surface of the labial palp segment one and the choerocampine pilifer-palp hearing organ. The antennae are slightly clubbed, long, exceeding the apex of the forewing cell. The scales of head and body are narrow, semi-erect, giving a hairy appearance. The hindwing upperside is uniform brownish-grey.

Adults are on wing from April to October in Thailand.
