'''Peter IV''' (in Bulgarian ''Pet<U+0103>r IV'', or commonly but less accurately ''Pet<U+0103>r II'') ({{lang-bg|<U+041F><U+0435><U+0442><U+044A><U+0440> IV}}) ruled as emperor ([[tsar]]) of [[Bulgaria]] [[1185]]-[[1197]].  The names of his parents are unknown, and before he was proclaimed emperor in [[1185]], Peter IV was named Theodore (''Todor'').  The change of name indicates an attempt to seek legitimacy through a connection with the sainted Emperor [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]] of Bulgaria, whose name was also adopted by earlier rebels against Byzantine rule in [[1040]] and [[1072]].  The name appears augmented as ''Slavopet<U+0103>r'' ("glorious Peter") and ''Kalopet<U+0103>r'' ("good Peter") in some sources.

==Revolutionary leader==
In [[1185]] Theodore and his younger brother [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen]] appeared before the Byzantine emperor [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac II Angelos]] at Kypsela to request a [[pronoia]], but their request was dismissively refused and Ivan Asen was slapped in the ensuing argument.  The insulted brothers returned home to [[Moesia]] and, taking advantage of discontent caused by the heavy taxation imposed by the Byzantine emperor to finance his campaigns against [[William II of Sicily]] and to celebrate his marriage to [[Margaret of Hungary]], raised a [[Vlach-Bulgarian Rebellion|revolt]] against Byzantine rule.

The rebellion failed to immediately capture Bulgaria's historic capital [[Veliki Preslav|Preslav]], but established a new capital city at [[Veliko Tarnovo|T<U+0103>rnovo]], presumably the center of the revolt.  In [[1186]] the rebels suffered a defeat, but Isaac II Angelos failed to exploit his victory and returned to [[Constantinople]].  With the help of the chiefly [[Cumans|Cuman]] population north of the [[Danube]], Peter IV and Ivan Asen recovered their positions and raided into [[Thrace]]. When Isaac II Angelos penetrated into Moesia again in [[1187]] he failed to capture either T<U+0103>rnovo or [[Lovech|Love<U+010D>]], and he signed a treaty effectively recognizing the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]].

==Emperor of Bulgaria==
During the [[Third Crusade]], as relations between Isaac II Angelos and [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] deteriorated, Peter IV and Ivan Asen offered military assistance to the German crusaders at [[Ni<U+0161>]] in [[1189]].  In [[1190]] Isaac II Angelos managed to advance on T<U+0103>rnovo again and besieged it, but was forced to retreat because of the progress of Cuman reinforcements from the north.  During his retreat, the Byzantine emperor was ambushed by Ivan Asen, who had taken over the Balkan passes, and Isaac II barely escaped with his life, losing much of his army and treasures.

The victory over the Byzantines brought Ivan Asen to the fore, and Peter IV had apparently already crowned him co-emperor in [[1189]].  With Ivan Asen I left in charge of T<U+0103>rnovo and the campaigns against the Byzantines, Peter IV retired to Preslav without abdicating the throne.  After the murder of Ivan Asen I in [[1196]], Peter IV marched on T<U+0103>rnovo, besieged the murderer Ivanko, and forced him to flee to the Byzantines.  About a year later, in [[1197]], Peter IV was also murdered.  He was succeeded by his younger brother Ivan (nicknamed [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]] or ''Ivanica/Ioanica''), whom he had apparently associated on the throne in [[1196]].

==Disputed origins==
While the person of Peter IV remains little known and enigmatic, the ethnic nature of the rebellion which he headed together with his brothers has been hotly disputed in the age of [[nationalism]].  Bulgarian historians insist on the Bulgarian origin of the rebellion and its leaders, while Romanian historians want to see them as proto-Romanian [[Vlachs]] (Wallachians).  

The main source on the restoration of the Second Bulgarian Empire is the Byzantine historian [[Nicetas Choniates]].  Choniates refers to the people of Peter and Ivan Asen as "the [[barbarian]]s around Mount [[Haemus Mons|Haimos]], who were earlier called [[Moesi|Mysoi]], and are now called Blachoi" (Choniates, 482 [p. 368 van Dieten]).  The designation "Mysians" is derived from the Roman province of [[Moesia]], corresponding to the territory between the Balkan (Haimos/Haemus) mountains and the Lower [[Danube]].

The term Mysians had been used to designate the Bulgarians by classicizing Byzantine historians since at least Leo the Deacon in the second half of the [[10th century]].  (In the same classicizing vein, Byzantine authors were want to call the [[Russians]] "[[Scythia]]ns" and the [[Serbs]] "Triballoi".)  To add to the confusion, elsewhere in Choniates' history, the subjects of Peter IV and Ivan Asen I are on occasion called "Mysians", "Vlachs" or two different but conjoined peoples, "the people [''g<U+00E9>nos''] of the Bulgarians and Vlachs" (Choniates, 485 [p. 371 van Dieten]).  The contemporary German (Austrian) chronicler [[Ansbert]] mentions "the Vlach Kalopetrus and his brother Assanius" (33), and calls Peter ''Blacorum et maxime partis Bulgarorum in hortis Tracie dominus'', "ruler of the Vlachs and the greatest part of the Bulgarians in the gardens of [[Thrace]]" (58). 

The eminent Bulgarian historian [[Vasil Zlatarski]] has drawn attention to the fact that under Byzantine rule Bulgaria proper was divided between a theme of Bulgaria (in the west) and a theme called Paradounabion/Paristrion and later Moesia (in the east).  Since Niketas Choniates explicitly states that "the Mysians ... are now called Vlachs", Zlatarski concludes that the conjoint terms Bulgarians and Vlachs found in the sources indicate the extension of Peter IV and Ivan Asen I's control over the population of both themes, Bulgaria and Moesia.  This conclusion is supported by the testimony of Ansbert, who would be correct to identify Peter IV as master of (all) Moesia (as ruler of the Vlachs) and of (a part) of Bulgaria (as ruler of the greater part--superlative!--of the Bulgarians).  However, Zlatarski's analysis glosses over the important implication that in order for the Mysians to be called Vlachs in Choniates' time, there must have been very significant Vlach (Wallachian) population on the territory of Moesia itself.  This means that even if the medieval description of the population is based primarily on the administrative division of the themes, the popular support for the rebellion of Peter IV and Ivan Asen I consisted of both Bulgarians and Vlachs, rather than exclusively one group or the other.  

While the primarily Cuman-populated area between the Danube and the Carpathians fell under Bulgarian suzerainty after the restoration of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Wallachia proper was not yet in existence, and according to Romanian tradition, the Vlachs settled in that area in the second half of the [[13th century]], in the wake of the [[Mongol]] invasion and the displacement of the Cumans.  This means that the "Vlachia" in the titles of "king/emperor of Bulgarians and Vlachs" or "king/emperor of Bulgaria and Vlachia" found in the correspondence between Peter IV's successor Kaloyan and [[Pope Innocent III]] is probably still the Byzantine theme of Moesia.  It should also be noted that these titles never occur in Bulgarian sources, and are found exclusively in the foreign, Latin-language diplomatic correspondence of Kaloyan's reign. The Bulgarian title reads "emperor and autocrat of the [[Bulgarians]]", later expanded to include "all Bulgarians and [[Greeks]]".  Nevertheless the characterization of the state in the imperial title need not correspond completely to its ethnic composition, as it hearkened back to First Bulgarian Empire, which had been conquered by the Byzantines in [[1018]]. 

The ethnic origin of Peter IV, Ivan Asen I, and Kaloyan has been subjected to the same nationalist controversy.  In his correspondence with [[Pope Innocent III]], Kaloyan followed up the pope's flattering suggestion and called the earlier Bulgarian emperors [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]], and [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuel]] his "ancestors". This descent is most likely nothing more than a legitimizing fiction. The "Vlachian" origin of the brothers attested in the sources may simply confirm what is already known, that they lived in Moesia.  Nothing in the historical evidence allows us to identify them as either specifically Vlachs or Bulgarians.  However, the non-Christian name of Ivan Asen I and his sobriquet ''Belgun'' seem to indicate Turkic, perhaps Cuman origin.  This is a likely option, as large numbers of Cumans had settled in Moesia in the [[12th century]], and continued to do so in the 13th.  If that is correct, then the nationalist controversy becomes obsolete, as the Cumans are an extinct people, which is neither Bulgarian nor Romanian, and has intermixed with both.
