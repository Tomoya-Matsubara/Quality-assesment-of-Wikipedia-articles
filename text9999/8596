'''Cornelia Clark Fort''' (Feb 5, 1919<U+2013>Mar 21 1943) was an [[aviator]] in the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) later called [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]], who became the first female pilot in [[History of the United States|American history]] to die on active duty.

==Early life and career==
Fort was born to a wealthy and prominent [[Nashville, Tennessee]], family; her father, Rufus Elijah Fort, was a founder of [[National Life and Accident Insurance Company]].<ref>Rob Simbeck, ''Daughter of the Air: The Brief Soaring Life of Cornelia Fort'', Atlantic, 1999, ISBN 0-87113-688-0, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wxnOF4x6OD4C&pg=PA7&dq=Rufus+Elijah+Fort+National+Life+and+Accident&lr=&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Rufus%20Elijah%20Fort%20National%20Life%20and%20Accident&f=false p. 7].</ref>  She graduated from [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in 1939.<ref>Janet R.

She showed an early interest in flying, ultimately training for and earning her pilot's license in [[Hawaii]].

==Pearl Harbor attack==
While working as a civilian pilot instructor at [[Pearl Harbor]], Cornelia Fort inadvertently became one of the first witnesses to the [[Japan]]ese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] that brought the United States into [[World War II]]. On December 7, 1941, Fort was in the air near Pearl Harbor teaching takeoffs and landings to a student pilot in an [[Interstate Cadet]] monoplane. Hers and a few other civilian aircraft were the only U.S. planes in the air near the harbor at that time. Fort saw a military airplane flying directly toward her and swiftly grabbed the controls from her student to pull up over the oncoming craft. It was then she saw the [[Rising Sun Flag|rising sun]] insignia on the wings. Within moments, she saw billows of black smoke coming from Pearl Harbor and bombers flying in. She quickly landed the plane at [[Honolulu International Airport#History|John Rodgers civilian airport]] near the mouth of Pearl Harbor. The pursuing [[A6M Zero|Zero]] strafed her plane and the runway as she and her student ran for cover.<ref>Sarah Byrn Rickman, ''Nancy Love and the WASP Ferry Pilots of World War II'', University of North Texas Press, 2008, ISBN 978-1-57441-241-3, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pwc9PZUjR4IC&pg=PA108&dq=Cornelia+Fort&client=firefox-a#v=snippet&q=John%20Rodgers&f=false p. 117].</ref><ref>Simbeck, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wxnOF4x6OD4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cornelia+Fort&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Suomala&f=false pp. 1-3, 99-100].</ref> The airport manager was killed and two other civilian planes did not return that morning.<ref>Simbeck, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wxnOF4x6OD4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cornelia+Fort&client=firefox-a#v=snippet&q=airport%20manager&f=false pp. 4, 109].</ref>

==Military service==
With all civilian flights grounded in Hawaii, Fort returned to the mainland in early 1942. She made a short movie promoting [[war bond]]s that was successful and led to speaking engagements.<ref>Marianne Verges, ''On Silver Wings: The Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II, 1942-1944'', Ballantine, 1991, ISBN 0-345-36534-8, [http://books.google.com/books?client=firefox-a&id=EC1nAAAAMAAJ&dq=On+Silver+Wings%3A+The+Women+Airforce+Service+Pilots+of+World+War+II%2C+1942-1944&q=Cornelia+Fort#search_anchor p. 5].</ref> Later that year, [[Nancy Love]] recruited her to serve in the newly established [[Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron]], precursor to the [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASP). She was the second woman accepted into the service.<ref>Rickman, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pwc9PZUjR4IC&pg=PA108&dq=Cornelia+Fort&client=firefox-a#v=snippet&q=WAFS%20in%20the%20order%20they%20joined&f=false p. 97].</ref> The WAFS ferried military planes to bases within the United States.

==Death==
Stationed at the 6th Ferrying Group base at [[Long Beach, California]], Cornelia Fort became the first WAFS fatality<ref>Emily Yellin, ''Our Mothers' War: American Women at Home and at the Front During World War II'', Free Press, 2004, ISBN 0-7432-4514-8 [http://books.google.com/books?id=UqghzKCPZw0C&pg=PA399&dq=Cornelia+Fort&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=twenty-four-year-old%20Fort&f=false p. 158].</ref> on March 21, 1943 when another plane being ferried by a male pilot struck the left wing of the [[BT-13]] she was ferrying in a mid-air collision ten miles south of [[Merkel, Texas]].<ref>Rickman, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pwc9PZUjR4IC&pg=PA108&dq=Cornelia+Fort&client=firefox-a#v=snippet&q=Merkel%2C%20Texas&f=false pp. 116-17].</ref><ref>Yellin, [http://books.google.com/books?id=UqghzKCPZw0C&pg=PA399&dq=Cornelia+Fort&client=firefox-a#v=snippet&q=March%2021%2C%201943%2C%20Fort&f=false p. 157].</ref>  At the time of the accident, Cornelia Fort was one of the most accomplished pilots of the WAFS. The footstone of her grave is inscribed, "Killed in the Service of Her Country."<ref>Rickman, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pwc9PZUjR4IC&pg=PA108&dq=Cornelia+Fort&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=footstone&f=false p. 119].</ref>
