'''Holden Chapel''' is a small building in [[Harvard Yard]] on the campus of [[Harvard University]].  Completed in 1744, it is the third oldest building at Harvard and one of the oldest college buildings in America.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Early history==
In December 1741, Mrs. [[Samuel Holden]], the widow of a former [[Governor of the Bank of England]], offered Harvard a 400 [[pound sterling]] donation towards the construction of a [[chapel]] on campus, prompted by a suggestion from [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]].<ref>{{cite book| url= http://books.google.com/books?id=cC4BAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA37 | title= The History of Harvard University | first=Josiah | last=Quincy | year= 1840 |volume= Volume 2| page= 37}}</ref>  After additional funds were raised, the chapel opened in March 1745.<ref name="crim341128">{{cite web| url= http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1934/11/28/holden-chapel-pbed-note-the-crimson-does/ | title= Holden Chapel: The Mail | date= November 28, 1934| publication= [[The Harvard Crimson]] | accessdate= 2011-02-14| work=Letter| author= John P.

==20th/21st century==
In the 1930s, Holden Chapel (and [[Hollis Hall]]) were chosen by the Historical American Buildings Survey Commission as two of the finest examples of early [[American colonial architecture|Colonial architecture]] in Massachusetts<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1934/2/21/hollis-holden-chosen-as-best-colonial/ | title= Hollis, Holden Chosen as Best Colonial Buildings | date= February 21, 1934| publication= [[The Harvard Crimson]] | accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>

For much of the 20th century, Holden Chapel housed the student offices of the [[Harvard Glee Club]] and later the [[Radcliffe Choral Society]] and the [[Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum]], which collectively came to be known as the [[Holden Choirs]].  The chapel was remodeled in 1999 to serve as both a classroom and a musical rehearsal and performance space.<ref name="crim990709">{{cite web| url= http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/7/9/human-bones-found-during-holden-chapel/| title= Human Bones Found During Holden Chapel Renovations | date= July 9, 1999| publication= [[The Harvard Crimson]] | accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>  Though no longer housing the Holden Choirs' offices, Holden Chapel now serves as their primary rehearsal space.
