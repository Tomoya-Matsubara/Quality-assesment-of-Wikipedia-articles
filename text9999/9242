The '''Philosophy Documentation Center''' is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[publishing|publisher]] and resource center that provides access to scholarly materials in [[applied ethics]], [[classics]], [[philosophy]], [[religious studies]], and related disciplines. It publishes [[academic journal]]s, [[proceedings|conference proceedings]], [[anthologies]], and specialized [[reference work]]s, often in cooperation with [[scholarly association|scholarly]] and [[professional association]]s. It also provides membership management and electronic publishing services, and hosts electronic journals, series, and other publications from several countries.

== History ==
The Philosophy Documentation Center was established in 1966 at [[Bowling Green State University]] in Ohio to manage the publication of specialized reference works in philosophy. It was founded by two members of the university philosophy department, Ramona Cormier and Richard Lineback, who recognized a need to improve access to the growing body of philosophical literature in English and other languages. Its first publication was ''The Philosopher<U+2019>s Index'', which provided bibliographic listings, indexed by subject and author, of recently published journal articles in philosophy. In 1970 PDC assumed responsibility for the publication of the ''[[Directory of American Philosophers]]'' and the ''[[International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers]]''.

In 1974, PDC began publishing a series of specialized research bibliographies that provided systematic overviews of the primary and secondary work of major philosophers.

In 1975 the PDC published its first journal, ''[[Philosophy Research Archives]]'', a bilingual microfilm journal, in cooperation with the [[American Philosophical Association]] and the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]].<ref>''Philosophy Research Archives'', Microfiche 1, 1975</ref> From 1975-1981 this project was published entirely in microfiche format in an effort to overcome the space limitations of traditional journals. It was one of the first experiments with non-traditional formats in journal publishing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} In 1977, PDC published a collection of papers from the First National Workshop-Conference on Teaching Philosophy, its first publishing work in support of a new professional organization.<ref>''Teaching Philosophy Today''. edited by [[Terrell Ward Bynum]] and Sidney Reisberg, in cooperation with the National Information and Resource Center for the Teaching of Philosophy, 1977. [[WorldCat]] Record, OCLC Accession No.3286509. This and subsequent Workshop-Conferences on Teaching Philosophy led to the establishment of the [[American Association of Philosophy Teachers]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> That same year PDC began to provide publishing services for independent philosophy journals<ref>PDC invoices for 1977, retrieved 21 September 2012. This work began with typesetting for ''[[Idealistic Studies]]'' and ''The Journal of Critical Analysis''.</ref> and its work on serial publications in print and electronic format has grown in increments. PDC currently produces dozens of print and electronic journals and series in philosophy and neighboring disciplines. It also provides online access to complete sets of discontinued journals.<ref name=home>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pdcnet.org |title=Philosophy Documentation Center web site|accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>

In 1995 the editor and original owner of ''The Philosopher<U+2019>s Index'' retired from Bowling Green State University and ended his long association with PDC.<ref>"Hail & Farewell" in ''Phil Facts'', No.20, Summer 1995, p.1</ref> Since 1995 he has continued to publish ''Philosopher's Index'' separate from PDC with his own organization ([[Philosopher's Information Center]]).<ref>''The Philosopher's Index'', volume 29, no.3, Fall 1995, p.ii</ref> PDC continued to develop other publications and services, with a focus on the publishing and membership management needs of professional associations and scholarly societies. The scope of this work increased over time, with notable projects such as the ''Proceedings of the Twentieth [[World Congress of Philosophy]]'' (1999-2001) and the production of the major publications of the [[American Philosophical Association]] (1999-2000). Fields covered by PDC now include [[applied ethics]], [[classics]], [[philosophy]], [[religious studies]], and [[semiotics]]. It manages memberships for twenty organizations,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://secure.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/membershipindex?openform |title=Membership Services, Philosophy Documentation Center web site|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> and this work includes secure hosting, digital work flow management, authenticated access to electronic resources, and online conference registration.<ref name=home />

In 2001 PDC relocated its operations and most of its staff to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] as a consequence of increasing technical demands of this expanding range of services.<ref>Atkins, Ace. "Deep Thoughts" in ''C-Ville Weekly'', July 24<U+2013>30, 2001, p.5</ref>

== Electronic resources ==
In 1979, PDC launched [[dial-up access]] to ''The Philosopher's Index'' database in cooperation with [[DIALOG]]; ''Philosopher's Index'' was made available on CD-ROM in 1990. In 1992, PDC published ''The Logic Works'', an instructional software program for introductory logic courses, in cooperation with [[Rob Brady]]. A number of versions of this DOS-based program were published by PDC for 10 years. PDC also published ''EthicsWorks'', a software package for introductory ethics courses, in cooperation with [[Robert Pielke]]. In 1996, PDC partnered with InteLex Corporation to develop [[POIESIS: Philosophy Online Serials]]. This project made the content of dozens of print journals accessible online in conjunction with print subscriptions. It also allowed for the creation of complete back issue collections of several journals on CD-ROM, including ''[[Business Ethics Quarterly]]'', ''[[Philosophy and Theology|Philosophy & Theology]]'', ''[[Review of Metaphysics|The Review of Metaphysics]]'', and ''[[Teaching Philosophy]]''.

In 2009, PDC launched its eCollection of journals and series from several countries, with onlince access for institutions, single individuals, and membership organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/ecollection |title=Philosophy Documentation Center - About eCollection |accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref> PDC partnered with PORTICO to ensure long term preservation of this collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/news-events/news/general-news/the-philosophy-documentation-center-to-preserve-e-journals-in-portico |title=Portico announces agreement with Philosophy Documentation Center - July 26, 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2012}}</ref>

In 2010, PDC launched the [[International Directory of Philosophy]], an online database consolidating the content of the ''[[Directory of American Philosophers]]'' and the ''[[International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers]]''. This database contains information on university philosophy departments and programs, professional societies, research centers, journals, and publishers in approximately 130 countries.

In 2011, PDC launched a new indexing database, the [[Philosophy Research Index]]. This project is not associated with ''The Philosopher's Index'', the ''International Philosophical Bibliography'' (''R<U+00E9>pertoire bibliographique de la philosophie''), or any other existing resource. The goal of the project is to build complete bibliographic coverage of philosophical literature in several languages.

In 2012, PDC launched single document access options for non-subscribers for all journals and series on its site, including a free preview of the first page of each document. The implementation allows each publication to choose its own access terms.<ref name=home /> PDC is a member of [[CrossRef]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crossref.org/crweblog/2011/08/new_crossref_members_97.html |title=CrossRef Blog |accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>
