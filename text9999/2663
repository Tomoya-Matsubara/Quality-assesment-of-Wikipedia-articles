The city of '''Cooper''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|k|<U+028A>|p|<U+0259>r}} is the [[county seat]] of [[Delta County, Texas|Delta County]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. Located between the north and south forks of the [[Sulphur River]], Cooper is the largest settlement within Delta County. As of the [[United States Census 2010|U.S. Census of 2010]], Cooper had a population of 1,969. 

First inhabited by native peoples, Cooper was founded around 1870, at the same time that Delta County was established. Cooper grew rapidly and it quickly became the center of local events. The city's economy relied primarily on agricultural farming and the shipping of local goods. In the mid-1890s, a railroad line was built through the city, assisting in Cooper's growth. The city continued to grow through the 1910s, and into the early 1920s. In 1926, however, the region's [[cotton]] crop failed, devastating the local economy. Many businesses were forced to close, including the railroad, and the city's population plummeted. Although Cooper began to recover during the mid-1930s, many people who left did not return, and the city never fully recovered. The local economy continued to rely on the growing of cotton as the main economy into the 1960s, until it began to shift to [[wheat]] growing in the early 1970s. The population of Cooper has been on a slow decline since the 1970s.

Cooper currently has no sites listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The city's economy still relies largely on agriculture. Cooper is located on the eastern edge of the [[Dallas<U+2013>Fort Worth metroplex]] (DFW metroplex), a large, twelve-county [[metropolitan area]], one of the most populated in the country.

==History==

===Before establishment===
[[File:Caddoan Mississippian culture map HRoe 2010.jpg|thumb|right|The site of Cooper was near the westernmost edge of Caddo civilization|alt=A map of where the Caddo live.]]
The first inhabitants of the area that is now the site of Cooper were the [[Caddo Indians]], who settled large portions of eastern Texas as early as 800 A.D. The Caddo were highly advanced, living in large wooden structures, and were skilled farmers.<ref name="Caddos">{{cite web |last=Perttula |first= Timothy K. |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmcaj |title=Caddo Indians |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |accessdate=February 7, 2013}}</ref> The first European to visit the area was French explorer Fran<U+00E7>ois Hervey, who discovered the area around 1750. However, a few decades later, European disease and attacks from neighboring tribes forced the Caddo out of the area around Cooper. Around 1820, [[Delaware Indians|Delaware]], [[Quapaw]], and [[Seminole Indians|Seminole]] tribes settled in the area. In 1836, the [[Republic of Texas]] officially recognized the region around Cooper as part of [[Red River County, Texas|Red River County]]. In 1840, [[Lamar County, Texas|Lamar County]] was formed, absorbing the Cooper area. However, just six years later, the region was designated as part of the newly formed [[Hopkins County, Texas|Hopkins County]].<ref name="Delta County">{{cite web |last=McCroskey |first=Vista K. |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hcd05 |title=Delta County |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association  |accessdate=February 7, 2013}}</ref>

After the Civil War, the region around the site of Cooper began to grow and develop. People in nearby [[Ben Franklin, Texas]] grew tired of the poor road conditions that connected the region. In 1868, people in the area petitioned the state government to create a new county located between the north and south forks of the [[Sulphur River]]. On July 29, 1870, after two years of debating, the state of Texas granted the request for the new county. Shortly afterwards, the first settlements were built in Cooper and the town was established. The community was named after Leroy Cooper, the chairman of the Texas House Committee on Counties and Boundaries who helped establish the new county. Cooper was selected as the seat for the county, which would be named Delta County due to its triangular shape.<ref name="Delta County"/><ref name="Cooper TSHA">{{cite web |last=Long |first=Christopher |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hjc17 |title=Cooper, TX (Delta County) |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=February 7, 2013}}</ref>

===Since establishment===
Cooper grew rapidly after being established, with a post office built in the community in 1871. Cooper was incorporated into a town in 1881 and held its first government elections. That same year, Cooper constructed the county courthouse. The town became the main market center for Delta County, and by 1885, Cooper had a population of around 300. The Texas Midland Railroad, which ran through Cooper, was chartered in 1892. The railroad helped promote the rapid growth of the town. By 1896, Cooper's population had passed 1,000 people, and contained two churches, a school, and 21 businesses, including a bank and a hotel. The town also had two weekly newspapers. Cooper continued to grow into the early 1900s, especially in the area of agriculture. From the early 1890s to around 1910, farms boomed both in number and in value, with the number of cash crops nearly tripling. The region produced over 70,000 chickens and almost 7,000 pigs yearly.<ref name="Delta County"/><ref name="Cooper TSHA"/>

Cooper continued to grow into the 1920s. The bank had been rebuilt in 1909, and the region's crops continued to prosper. Cooper reported its largest population, 2,563, in 1925.<ref name="Cooper TSHA"/> Delta County was hit by the [[Great Depression]] early, though. In late 1926, the community's cotton crop failed, forcing many residents to withdraw their savings. The bank was forced to close in 1927, and by the time it reopened a few months later, the region's economy had plummeted. Several families moved away from Cooper during the early 1930s, and in 1933, the bank was forced to close again. The Midland Texas Railroad failed, hurting Cooper's economy further. The [[New Deal]] program offered some relief to Cooper, and in 1940, the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) demolished the former courthouse in Cooper and replaced it with a new one at a cost of $110,450 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|110450|1940|r=-2}}}} respectively in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{inflation-fn|US}}). However, even with the stability of the economy, Cooper's population remained low until the 1950s, when it returned to approximately 2,350 people. The population declined again in the 1980s, and has continued to slowly decline. Cooper had approximately 60 businesses in the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1986, work on [[Cooper Lake (Texas)|Cooper Lake]] had begun.<ref name="Delta County"/><ref name="Cooper TSHA"/> Filling of the lake began in September 1991, and by the next year, the lake was open for recreation.<ref name="Cooper Lake State Park">{{Cite book |last=Parent |first=Laurence |year=2008 |title=Official Guide to Texas State Parks and Historic Sites |location=[[Austin, Texas|Austin]] |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |edition=2nd |page=141 |isbn=978-0-292-71726-8}}</ref> At that time, Cooper reported having 70 businesses, and a population of around 2,200. By 2000, the population had dropped by about 50 people.<ref name="Cooper TSHA"/>

Cooper, as well as most of Delta County, is located in the [[Texas Blackland Prairies]] region, a flat, tall grass prairie ecosystem which covers a large portion of north central Texas. The region's elevation rarely strays from around {{convert|400|ft}} to {{convert|500|ft}}. The area's geology consists mainly of deep clay, or clay mixed with a dark-colored loam.

[[File:Cotton field kv12.jpg|thumb|left|From Cooper's founding in 1870 until the 1950s, [[cash crops]], especially [[cotton]], were the city's main source of economy.|alt=An image of a cotton plant]] 
Cooper's economy relied heavily on agricultural farming from its founding until the 1950s, especially on the growing of [[cash crop]]s. In 1880, cotton, corn, sorghum and other crops were grown on over {{convert|100000|acre}} of farmland. The county also produced large quantities of livestock, with almost 3,000 cows and 10,000 hogs grazing on land near Cooper. The logging industry began to grow in the region, and several mills were constructed, producing furniture and lumber. In 1886, the Santa Fe Railway built a line through the county, and the shipping of crops and lumber became a major business in Cooper. During the early 1890s, the livestock industry in Delta County struggled, with the number of hogs being raised dropping to half of what it had been the previous decade. However, the agricultural business boomed, with the number of farms in the area around Cooper increasing to 1,188, and the value of the farms doubled to $1,400 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|110450|1890|r=-2}}}} respectively in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) each. The production of cotton tripled, and the poultry industry began to boom. Within the city limits, Cooper housed a hotel, a shoemaker, a grocery store, a wagon maker, feed stores, general stores, drug stores, and several cotton and oat gins. Delta County contained 18 manufacturing establishments, but they only employed 33 people. The average income for someone working in the region was $208 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|110450|1890}}}} respectively in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name="Delta County"/><ref name="Cooper TSHA"/>

At the turn of the century, the cotton industry was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become an important part of the economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.<ref name="Delta County"/><ref name="Cooper TSHA"/>

==Government==
Since its incorporation in 1870, Cooper has served as the seat for Delta County. Because of this, Cooper houses the [[Delta County Courthouse|county courthouse]], county offices, sheriff, and county library. Cooper has a [[Mayor<U+2013>council government]]. The city council is made up of five members who are elected at large. The current council members are mayor [[Pro tempore|pro-tem]] David Philips, E.J. Cates, JoAnn Preas, W. D.

The first election in Delta County occurred on October 6, 1870, to establish control in the newly formed county. Cooper held its first election in 1881, establishing an [[alderman]]ic government. Around that time, the first county courthouse was built in Cooper. Delta County, in addition to Cooper, voted for the Democratic Party in every presidential election from its incorporation in 1870 until 1968. However, the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] won numerous local and county government positions during the 1890s and the early 1900s. In the 1970s, politics in Delta County shifted, and most of the county began voting for the Republican Party.<ref name="Delta County"/><ref name="Cooper TSHA"/>

==Education==
[[File:Samrayburnstudentcenter.JPG|thumb|left|East Texas Normal College (now known as [[Texas A&M University<U+2013>Commerce]]) was located in Cooper from 1889 until 1894, when the campus was destroyed in a fire.|alt=A modern building on a college campus]]
Delta County has historically been advanced in education. Around the time that Cooper and the county were founded, there were already nine churches in the county. By 1880, that number had increased to nearly 30. There were a combined 998 students attending those schools, which operated 4<U+00BD> months a year. In 1889, East Texas Normal College was founded in Cooper. The school did very well while located in Cooper, but the college moved to Commerce after the campus was destroyed in a fire in 1894. The school was later renamed [[Texas A&M University<U+2013>Commerce]].<ref name="Delta County"/> In 1896, Cooper reported to have one successful school located within the city proper.<ref name="Cooper TSHA"/> 

Schools were important during the 1940s, as they became the local activity centers. In the early 1940s, there were 34 common schools and six independent school districts within Delta County. These schools employed 134 people and had a combined total of 4,000 students enrolled. Cooper, along with Pecan Gap and Enloe, offered a four-year high school program. Late in the 1940s, with the help of state taxes on transportation, the schools and districts began to consolidate. In 1966, Cooper had two elementary schools, a junior high school, and a high school.<ref name="Delta County"/>

The [[Cooper Independent School District]] (Cooper ISD) currently operates the schools that serve Cooper.
