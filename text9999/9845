'''William Denby''' "'''Bill'''" '''Hanna''' (July 14, 1910&nbsp;<U+2013> March 22, 2001) was an American [[animator]], [[film director|director]], [[Film producer|producer]], [[television director]], [[television producer]], and [[cartoonist|cartoon artist]], whose movie and television cartoon characters entertained millions of fans worldwide for much of the 20th century. When he was a young child, Hanna's family moved frequently, but they settled in [[Compton, California]], by 1919. There, Hanna became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. Hanna graduated from [[Compton High School]] in 1928. He briefly attended [[El Camino College Compton Center|Compton City College]] but dropped out at the onset of the [[Great Depression]].

After working odd jobs in the first months of the Depression, Hanna joined the [[Harman and Ising]] [[animation]] [[studio]] in 1930. During the 1930s, Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as ''[[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|Captain and the Kids]]''. In 1937, while working at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), Hanna met [[Joseph Barbera]]. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and [[Live-action/animated film|live action films]]. In 1957, they co-founded [[Hanna-Barbera]], which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, producing programs such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Huckleberry Hound|The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[Yogi Bear]]''. In 1967, Hanna<U+2013>Barbera was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] for $12&nbsp;million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time the studio was sold to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which in turn was merged with [[Time Warner]], owners of [[Warner Bros.]], in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.

Hanna and Barbera won seven [[Academy Award]]s and eight [[Emmy Award]]s. Their cartoons have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna<U+2013>Barbera's shows have a global audience of over 300&nbsp;million people and have been translated into more than 20 languages.

Hanna was given the opportunity to direct his first cartoon in 1936; the result was ''To Spring'', part of the Harman-Ising ''Happy Harmonies'' series.<ref name="GuardianObit"/> The following year, MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman-Ising and bring production in-house.<ref name="BarberaAutoBio"/>{{rp|68}} Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman-Ising to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|their new cartoon studio]]. During 1938<U+2013>39, he served as a senior director on MGM's ''Captain and the Kids'' series, based upon the comic strip of the same name (an alternate version of the ''[[Katzenjammer Kids]]'' that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit).

Hanna and Barbera met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing ''Puss Gets the Boot'', he never actually worked on it. Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, ''Tom and Jerry''.<ref name="BarberaAutoBio"/>{{rp|78<U+2013>79}}

During his last year at MGM, Hanna branched out into television, forming the short-lived company Shield Productions with fellow animator [[Jay Ward]],<ref name="MooseRoar">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Keith|title=The Moose That Roared|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York, NY|year=2001|isbn=0-312-28383-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qdwcbJxM-HsC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=William+Hanna+%22Jay+Ward%22+%22Shield+Productions%22|accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref> {{rp|27<U+2013>29}} who had created the series ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]''.

==Legacy==
Most of the cartoons Hanna and Barbera created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Tom and Jerry, [[Yogi Bear]] and Boo Boo, Fred Flintstone and [[Barney Rubble]], Ruff and Reddy, ''The Jetsons'' family and the friends in ''Scooby-Doo''. These may have been a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Hanna and Barbera shared for almost 60 years.<ref name="AutoBiog"/>{{rp|214}} Although their professional strengths, weaknesses, and personalities meshed perfectly,<ref name="IrishObit"/><ref name="NYTt&j"/><ref name="Meshing"/><ref name="CNNobit"/> Hanna and Barbera traveled in completely different social circles. Hanna's circle of personal friends primarily included other animators; Barbera had an affinity for Hollywood's celebrity society.<ref name="AutoBiog"/>{{rp|52<U+2013>53}} Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches and good food and drink.<ref name="BarberaAutoBio"/>{{rp|120<U+2013>121}} Nevertheless, in their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters, Hanna and Barbera rarely exchanged a cross word.<ref name="TelegraphObit"/> Barbera said: "We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had deep respect for the other's work."<ref name="DreamTeam"/>

Hanna is considered one of the all-time great animators and on a par with [[Tex Avery]].<ref name="BBCobit"/> Hanna and Barbera were also among the first animators to realize the enormous potential of television and to successfully adapt to the change it brought to the industry.<ref name="IndBuncombe"/><ref name="USAToday">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/2001-03-22-hanna-obit.htm|title=Cartoon pioneer William Hanna dead at 90|date=2001-03-23|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref> [[Leonard Maltin]] says the Hanna<U+2013>Barbera team "held a record for producing consistently superior cartoons using the same characters year after year<U+2014>without a break or change in routine&nbsp;their characters are not only animated superstars, but also a very beloved part of American pop culture".<ref name="CNNobit"/><ref name="superior">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/dec/19/usa.media|title=Joe Barbera, creator of cartoon classics, dies at 95|last=Glendinning|first=Lee |date=2006-12-19|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> They are often considered the only rivals to [[Walt Disney]] in the art of making animated cartoons.<ref name="TelegraphObit"/><ref name="Aussie">{{cite news|title=Cat and mouse game fathered TV cartoon empire|last=Juddery|first=Mark|date=2001-03-29|work=The Australian|page=12|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref>
