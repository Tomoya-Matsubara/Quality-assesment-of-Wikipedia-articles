"'''Under the Bridge'''" is a song by the [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and the second single from the group's fifth studio album ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', released on [[March 13]], [[1992]]. The lyrics were originally written as a means for vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]] to express a feeling of loneliness and despondency, and as a reflection on narcotics and how it impacted his life. Kiedis initially did not feel "Under the Bridge" would fit into the Chili Peppers' repertoire, and was reluctant to show it to his band mates until producer [[Rick Rubin]] implored him to do so. The rest of the band was receptive to the poem and wrote the music to accompany Kiedis' words.

"Under the Bridge" became both a critical and commercial success. In 1992 the song peaked at number two on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and was eventually certified [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]; "Under the Bridge" allowed the Red Hot Chili Peppers to enter the mainstream. The single's success was only widened with the release of its accompanying music video, which was put into heavy rotation on music television channels. The same year, it won the "Viewers Choice Award" and "Breakthrough Video" at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. However, the success of the "Under the Bridge", in part, led to the departure of guitarist [[John Frusciante]], who was instrumental in its composition.

"Under the Bridge" has remained an inspiration to other artists and became a seminal and secular component of the [[alternative rock]] movement of the early and mid 1990s. David Fricke of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said the song "unexpectedly drop-kicked the band into the Top 10,"<ref name=rscoverstory>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5938432/the_naked_truth|title=The Naked Truth|date=June 25, 1992|author=David Fricke|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> while Philip Booth of ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]'' commented that it was a "pretty, undulating, [and] by-now omnipresent single."<ref name=ttribune>Booth, Philip (August 21, 1992).

==Origins and recording==
During the production of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1991 album ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', producer Rick Rubin visited Kiedis at his home regularly to review the material he had written.<ref name=scrtiss266>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 266-268</ref> He found a poem title "Under the Bridge" when flipping through Kiedis' notebook and instantly took an interest in the poignant lyrics. Rubin suggested Kiedis show it to the rest of the band: "I thought it was beautiful. I said 'We've got to do this'."<ref>Apter, 2004. p. 226</ref><ref name=rollingstonearticle>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5938432/the_naked_truth|title=The Naked Truth|author=David Fricke|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref><ref name=pp265>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 265<U+2013>266</ref> Kiedis was exceedingly reluctant as he felt the poem was too emotional and did not fit the Chili Peppers' style.<ref name=p267>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 267</ref> After singing the poem to guitarist John Frusciante and bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], Kiedis recalls that they "got up and walked over to their instruments and started finding the beat and guitar chords to match it."<ref name=p267/> Frusciante ultimately chose the chords he played in the intro to balance out the depressing nature of the lyrics: "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so I thought if the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier."<ref name=underthebridgemaking>The Making of "Under the Bridge"; Red Hot Chili Peppers Greatest Hits</ref>

Frusciante and Kiedis worked on the song for the next several days until they felt it was complete. "Under the Bridge" was among the few tracks that was written and completed prior to the band moving into the mansion they recorded the album in.<ref name=p267/> When the song was eventually recorded, Rubin felt the grand and epic outro would benefit from a large group of singers. Frusciante's mother, Gail, sang in a choir and brought her friends to sing.<ref name=apterchoir>Apter, 2004. p. 226</ref>

==Lyrics and meaning==
"Under the Bridge" was primarily written during a period of time when Kiedis was distraught and emotionally drained.<ref name=pp265/> Despite the sobriety he had maintained for roughly three years, Kiedis began to harbor feelings of intense loneliness; Frusciante and Flea had distanced themselves from the vocalist extensively.<ref name=pp265/> The two smoked marijuana, together, on a daily basis throughout the majority of the album's composition, decisively ignoring and disregarding Kiedis. This therefore caused Kiedis to feel that Frusciante was "no longer in [his] world."<ref name=pp265/> Driving home after rehearsal the same day, Kiedis felt a profound sense of loss<U+2014>his best friend, in some form, resented him.<ref name=pp265/> He was instantly reminded of a similar situation involving previous girlfriend [[Ione Skye]], with whom he had a long relationship. At the time the two were dating, Kiedis was seriously addicted to heroin and cocaine, often amalgamating the two to form [[Speedball (drug)|speedballs]], which resulted in him spending weeks at a time locked in motel rooms consuming the drug.<ref name=pp265/> Such feelings, coupled with memories of Skye and his prior drug use, led to emotional distress: "the loneliness that I was feeling triggered memories of my time with Ione and how I'd had this beautiful angel of a girl who was willing to give me all of her love, and instead of embracing that, I was downtown with fucking gangsters shooting speedballs under a bridge."<ref name=pp265/>

Kiedis also realized the fundamental role the city of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] played in his life, and how integral its environment was to his happiness: "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the [[Hollywood Hills]] that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." Feeling like he was a recluse within his own band, Kiedis' love for Los Angeles made him believe that the city was his only companion.<ref name=pp265/><ref name=rscoverstory/> The line "In the city I live in/The city of angles/Lonely as I am/Together we cry" shows a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. In spite of this, he saw the depression as being far better than his life as a drug addict and adopted optimistic philosophies: "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison."<ref name=rscoverstory/> This ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song, "I don't even want to feel/Like I did that day/Take me to the place I love"; the place he loves being his fellow band mates, friends and family.<ref name=funkymonks>Red Hot Chili Peppers ''Funky Monks''. [[Warner Bros. Records]]. May 1992.</ref><ref name=rscoverstory/>

One of the most notable verses in the song discuss the harsh effects of drugs, their ability to successfully disintegrate many of Kiedis' past relationships, and how significantly it impacted his happiness.<ref name=apterpg224>Apter, 2004. pp. 223-225</ref> The verse is based on Kiedis' own experience in downtown Los Angeles when he was attempting to purchase drugs. He and his drug dealer entered a gang territory under a bridge in order to receive the narcotics; to be permitted inside, however, Kiedis was forced to pretend one of the gang members' sister was his [[Engagement|fiance]]. He successfully acquired the drugs, but ultimately felt as though his life was pathetic due to the level he was willing to go to in order to get the drugs.<ref name=rscoverstory/> The integral verse, which illustrates the process of going under the bridge and shooting heroin, represents a point in Kiedis' life that he considers to be the worst.<ref name=rscoverstory/><ref name=apterpg224/> Because of this, the vocalist refuses to acknowledge the location of the bridge, though he notes that it is in the downtown Los Angeles area.<ref name=rscoverstory/>

==Composition==
{{Sound sample box align right|Sample:}} {{Listen|filename= Red Hot Chili Peppers - Under the Bridge.ogg |title="Under the Bridge" | description=Sample of "Under the Bridge" that contrasts the minimalist ideology employed by Frusciante in the intro with the grand find verse sang by Kiedis and a choir.|format=[[Ogg]]}}{{sample box end}}
"Under the Bridge" is written in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[D major]], and set at a pace of [[Time signature|4/4 time]].<ref name=bssmguitarbook>''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' Guitar Recorded Versions, pg. 51-55</ref> It begins with Frusciante playing a moderately slow intro that he drew heavy influence from the 1971 [[David Bowie]] song titled "[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]".<ref name=jfamsterdam>John Frusciante [http://youtube.com/watch?v=WIvjxI6QGxE Live In Amsterdam]. February 8, 2001 at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]].</ref> "Under the Bridge" marks an important shift in thinking for Kiedis, who had spent the majority of his career singing very fast due largely to the fact that he has a limited ability to reach high notes. When he begins to sing, the guitar part becomes more rapid until it reaches an [[E major]] seven chord progression that halts the song; silence is, however, broken by a closed [[hi-hat]] and [[wood block]] being hit in a moderately fast tempo to provide a beat.<ref name=bssmguitarbook/> The E major seven chord is a technique that Frusciante borrowed from [[England|British]] guitarist [[Marc Bolan]] of the [[glam rock]] band [[T.Rex (band)|T.Rex]], who initially wrote it for the song, ironically titled, "Rip Off";<ref name=jfamsterdam/> Frusciante lightheartedly noted that "I ripped off a song called 'Rip Off'. I thought that was interesting."<ref name=jfamsterdam/>

The song continues with another verse and subsequent chorus, when the [[bass guitar|bass]] is finally added. After this, it jumps back into a verse that once again utilizes an E major seven chord prior to commencing the chorus. The second chorus transitions into a different verse, where drummer Chad Smith begins to play the drums, and Kiedis sings "Take me all the way/Yeah/Yeah-e-yeah/Oh no, no". A choir, whose presence was added in order to make the ending sound more epic, sings "Under the bridge downtown" with Kiedis providing "Is where I drew some blood/I could not get enough/Forgot about my love/I gave my life away" in between.<ref name=apterchoir/> As the choir, Kiedis and drums drop off Frusciante plays the outro until the song ends.

==Release, success and acclaim==
"[[Give It Away]]" was chosen to be the band's first single off ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' by [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=p280>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 280-281</ref> Initially the song did not fare well after several target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to "come back to us when you have a melody in your song."<ref name=p280/> Eventually the [[Los Angeles]] [[modern rock]] radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] put "Give it Away" into heavy rotation; that, coupled with the strong sales of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' helped the song reach number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks]].<ref name="Billboard singles">{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Artist Chart History: Singles| publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''| accessdate=2007-10-03}}</ref> Due to the success of "Give it Away", the band did not foresee "Under the Bridge" as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially "mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people...I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single."<ref name=ap235>Apter, 2004. pp. 234-235</ref> "Under the Bridge", as such, was selected to be ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s second single. By March 1992 "Under the Bridge" had exploded, peaking at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassed only by [[Eric Clapton]]'s "[[Tears In Heaven]]".<ref name=ap235/> "Under the Bridge" spent a total of twenty-six cumulative weeks on the chart.<ref name=utbchartingbbh100>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=379&cfgn=Singles&cfn=The+Billboard+Hot+100&ci=3012395&cdi=6624117&cid=06%2F20%2F1992|title="Under the Bridge" Chart Performance Week Of June 20, 1992|author=|publisher=''Billboard''|accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref> "Give it Away" had only managed to peak at number 73 on the same chart.<ref name="Billboard singles"/>

Like ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', critical response to "Under the Bridge" was universally positive. Amy Hanson of [[All Music Guide]] noted that the song has "become an integral part of the 1990s alterna-landscape, and remains one of the purest diamonds that sparkle amongst the rough-hewn and rich funk chasms that dominate the Peppers<U+2019> own oeuvre."<ref name=amgUndertheBridge>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:3zfwxxlsld0e|title="Under the Bridge" review|author=Hanson, Amy|publisher=All Music Guide|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> She went on to praise "Under the Bridge" for being a "poignant sentiment that is self evident among the simple guitar which cradles the introductory verse, and the sense of fragility that is only doubled by the still down-tempo choral crescendo."<ref name=amgUndertheBridge/> Tom Moon of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' claimed that the song "[...] revealed new dimensions. The rhythm section displays a growing curiosity about studio texture and nuance."<ref name=rollingstonereview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/308371/blood_sugar_sex_magik|title=''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' Review|author=Tom Moon|accessdate=2008-01-21|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> David Fricke of the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' said "Under the Bridge" is a "stark and uncommonly pensive ballad," commenting that the song "drop-kicked the band into the Top 10."<ref name=stlouispost/> Philip Booth of ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]'' claimed the single to be "undulating [and] omnipresent" in the world of not only alternative rock, but pop music as a whole.<ref name=stlouispost>Fricke, David. "Chili Peppers: Red Hot On The Charts, Road." ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''. July 23, 1992.</ref> Ben DiPietro of the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'' praised the record as a whole, but felt the most attractive aspect was unquestionably their shift from exclusive hard rock to adding more moderately paced tracks: "there's still plenty of sonic funk to bang heads to, but the best tracks are the slower ones such as 'Under the Bridge'."<ref name=richmondtimes>Dipietro, Ben. "Guitarist Burns Red Hot Chili Peppers." ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''. June 7, 1992.</ref>

Since the single's release, "Under the Bridge" has been placed in numerous "Best of" lists. In 2002, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' placed the song at number six on their list of the "100 Greatest Singles of All Time".<ref name=kerrang!>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/061024/kerrang.htm|title=100 Greatest Singles of All Time|publisher=''Kerrang!''|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' ranked the song number 180 on their compilation of the "1001 Best Songs, Ever".<ref name=qmag>"1001 Greatest Songs of All Time."

==Music Video==
[[Image:FruscianteUTB.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Frusciante standing on a pedestal with inverted superimposed images behind him in the music video for "Under the Bridge"]]
The music video for "Under the Bridge" was directed by [[Gus Van Sant]], who is credited for photographing the band during their stay at the mansion, as well as the art direction for ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref>''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' liner notes.</ref> Van Sant knew Flea due to the bassist's role in Van Sant's 1991 film ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]''.<ref name=underthebridgemaking/> The band respected Van Sant both as a person and an artist, and they were elated when he agreed to direct the video for "Under the Bridge".<ref name=apter230>Apter, 2004. p. 230</ref> Flea credits the video as "the thing that really made us [the band] break through the mainstream of American and worldwide pop culture."<ref name=underthebridgemaking/>

Van Sant shot in two separate locations: the streets of Los Angeles and a studio soundstage.<ref name=underthebridgemaking/> The video begins with John Frusciante standing alone on a pedestal wearing a red and white striped collard shirt; brown khaki pants; brown shoes; and a purple, mild green and multicolored pom-pom hat with white stitched wolves in the middle while playing a 1962 Ocean Turquoise [[Fender Jaguar]] behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Although Frusciante's attire is abstract, it was his girlfriend of the time, Toni Oswald, who arbitrarily selected clothes for him to wear that day.<ref name=underthebridgemaking/> Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: "when I got [to the studio] Gus Van Sant was just looking at me and going 'God I'm so glad you wore that hat. I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad you wore those'."<ref name=underthebridgemaking/> The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.<ref name=underthebridgemaking/>

Once Kiedis begins to sing and appears on camera he is bathed in purple light with blue fluorescent stars as a backdrop with a frame of [[Superimposition|superimposed]] clouds surrounding him. As the camera pans closer to his face, an image of the skyline of Los Angeles is superimposed from his chin, downwards. Flea and drummer Chad Smith are then superimposed into the image while playing their instruments. Van Sant wanted superimposing to be a notable component in the overall theme of the video; he originally got the idea from a previous project he worked on with novelist [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]].<ref name=underthebridgemaking/> The scenes in the studio were coupled with scenes of Kiedis walking the streets of LA, who is now wearing a white T-shirt with the words "To Hell And Back" printed on the front; as he walks, the camera focuses on various people. This, according to Kiedis, was vital; he felt the studio portion alone would not convey enough emotion to the viewer: "the first time we shot [the video] it was all in a studio and that didn't seem to capture everything we needed to capture. It needed more; it needed to be combined with an outdoor, streets-of-Los-Angeles thing."<ref name=underthebridgemaking/> Towards the end, Kiedis is seen running down the [[Los Angeles River]] in slow motion; the background is a shot of an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] exploding. The video ends with various superimposed images of the band, and then finally Frusciante once again playing alone on a pedestal<U+2014>this time, however, with an inverted shot of the ocean as the sky.

"Under the Bridge" was placed into heavy rotation on [[MTV]] since its release.<ref name=apterpg240>Apter, 2004. pp. 244-249</ref> At the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] the Red Hot Chili Peppers led the nominations, which included the categories of "Best Video", "Best Group", and "Best Direction".<ref name=desertnews>Hastings, Deborah (July 9, 1992).

Due to the song's widespread success, it has become indispensable to the band's live set-lists.<ref name=apterpg255>Apter, 2004. pp. 252-255</ref> Unlike several of the Chili Peppers' other songs, "Under the Bridge" is not interpreted in a different manner than what is on the record<U+2014>the track is largely performed, aside from being played acoustically, the same as it was recorded.

Kiedis himself notes that he can make mistakes, at times forgetting or rearranging song lyrics in the verses.<ref name=stt>Kiedis, 2004. pp. 284-293</ref> The live quality of the song was also compromised when, in 1992, John Frusciante began to feel resentment towards the popularity it was receiving. He would play convoluted intros, purposefully throwing Kiedis off.<ref name=stt/> The most notable incident of such was during a televised performance on the highly-rated program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on February 22, 1992. Kiedis said it "felt like I was getting stabbed in the back and hung out to dry in front of all of America while [Frusciante] was off in a corner in the shadow, playing some dissonant out-of-tune experiment."<ref name=stt/> The guitarist used a [[distortion]] [[Effects pedal|pedal]] for the ending verse and screamed inaudibly into the microphone when providing backup vocals, both of which were not originally planned nor typical of live performances.<ref name=apterpg243>Apter, 2004. p. 243</ref> Regardless, sales of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' skyrocketed following the show.<ref name=stt/>

Kiedis has gone through a variety of phases of interest in playing "Under the Bridge" live. The vocalist has, at times, felt distanced from the song's lyrics and occasionally even resented singing it if he felt significant emotional detachment.<ref name=itunesexclusive>"Red Hot Chili Peppers iTunes Exclusive Interview." [[iTunes Originals]]. November, 2007.</ref> Recently, however, Kiedis has experienced a revival in interest: "Although there have been times when I was over ['Under the Bridge'], I've rediscovered it and now I feel close to it and it still has power, and life, and purpose as a song."<ref name=itunesexclusive/> Frusciante believed the flexibility of "Under the Bridge" has contributed to its success: "A lot of the time that is one of the ingredients of a hit; you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things, but you do go through cycles."<ref name=itunesexclusive/> During the period when Frusciante had quit the band from 1992 to 1998, [[Dave Navarro]] was his replacement. Flea believes the reason "Under the Bridge" has had a recent revival in relevancy is due to Frusciante's return and presence; he finds the fact that all four original members who wrote the track being together is vital.<ref>Apter, 2004. pp. 342-349</ref>

"Under the Bridge" was played at the [[Woodstock 1999|1999 Woodstock Festival]], which the Red Hot Chili Peppers headlined. As such, they were the final act to perform; attempts at distributing candles that were to be lit during "Under the Bridge" backfired. The crowd, which was already disorderly, created a bonfire. Lighthearted foul-play escalated into violence when several women who had been [[crowd surfing]] and [[moshing]] were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed.<ref>{{citeweb|Title=|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july99/woodstock27.htm|title=Woodstock '99 Goes Up in Smoke|author=Wartofsky, Aolna|date=July 27, 1999|accessdate=2007-06-28|publisher=''Washington Post''}}</ref><ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 424</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title=Police investigate alleged rapes at Woodstock '99|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9907/29/woodstock.rape/|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title="Repeated Violence"|publisher=The Lantern|url=http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2001/05/02/Opinion/Repeated.Violence-74898.shtml?sourcedomain=www.thelantern.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Other notable performances were at [[Slane Concert|Slane Castle]] in August, 2003 to 80,000 attendees;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/140015/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-Live-At-Slane-Castle/Product.html|title=Live At Slane Castle|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=Play.com}}</ref> and in 2004 at [[London]]'s [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] over the course of three days, in which an estimated 250,000 people attended.<ref name=yahoonews>{{Cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12178349|title=Chili Peppers Hot in London's Hyde Park|author=Waddell, Ray|date=June, 2007|publisher=Yahoo!

==Cover versions==
"Under the Bridge" has been covered several times since its release in 1992.<ref name=amgcoverlist>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=17:1624572~T00I|title='Under the Bridge' List of Covers|publisher=All Music Guide|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> The song was first transcribed in 1994 by the [[a cappella]] group [[The Flying Pickets]] from their debut album ''The Original Flying Pickets: Volume 1''. Notable jazz musician [[Frank Bennett]] covered the song by fusing elements of [[big band]]s and [[bebop]] in his 1996 album ''Five O'Clock Shadow''. [[Hip hop]] artist [[Mos Def]] included the beginning verse of "Under the Bridge" in the song "Brooklyn", from his 1999 record ''[[Black on Both Sides]]''. He, however, changed the line "city of angels", which refers to Los Angeles, to "the city I live in is beautiful Brooklyn" in order to match it with his song's premise.<ref name=apter319>Apter, 2004. p. 319</ref> [[Tony Hadley]] covered the song on his 1995 album ''Obsession''. The [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] has modified "Under the Bridge" at several concerts<U+2014>they perform various rock pieces combined into a single orchestral ensemble, often times including the Chili Peppers' 1992 hit.<ref name=amgcoverlist/> 

[[Alternative hip hop]] band [[Gym Class Heroes]] performed "Under the Bridge" on the 2006 assemblage ''[[Punk Goes '90s]]'', an album that compiled popular rock songs from the 1990s being covered by contemporary artists.<ref name=amgcoverlist/> Gym Class Heroes continued to play "Under the Bridge" during their upcoming tour; lead singer [[Travis McCoy]] has said it is "a timeless song. It's one of those songs you hear and are like 'Damn did this shit just come out?'."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I34o7Nf-7kk|title='Under the Bridge' cover performed live|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> The most successful cover version of "Under the Bridge" was released in 2001 by the pop band [[All Saints]], with the single reaching number one in the UK. The cover removed the final verse of the song that discusses drug use.<ref name=everyhit>{{Cite web|url=http://everyhit.com/|title=UK Top 40 Searchable Database|publisher=Everyhit.com|accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> The Chili Peppers were, however, displeased with this version; Kiedis felt the cover was poorly recreated and, with the omission of the final verse, it lost all personal significance.<ref name=apter335>Apter, 2004. p. 335</ref> The 1993 [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] song "[[Bedrock Anthem]]", is part parody of "Under the Bridge" and "Give It Away". Yankovic's satire includes a crudely played and badly [[Audio mastering|mastered]] intro similar to that of "Under the Bridge".
