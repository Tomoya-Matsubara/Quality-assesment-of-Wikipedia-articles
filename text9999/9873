'''Faidherbe Bridge''' is a road bridge over the [[S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal River]] which links the island of the city of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] in [[Senegal]] to the African mainland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/inventai/extranet/revue/insitu3/d7/text/d7.pdf|title=Saint<U+2013>Louis du S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal, un enjeu pour le patrimoine mondial|work=Saint<U+2013>Louis du S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal|publisher=culture.gouv.fr|language=french|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> The metal bridge is {{convert|507.35|m|ft|abb=yes}} long and {{convert|10.5|m|ft|abb=yes}} wide, weighing {{convert|1500|t|ton|abb=yes}}. It has eight [[span (architecture)|spans]], of which the longest five are {{convert|78.26|m|ft|abb=yes}}.

Until the 19th century, access to the island was made through boats. After the introduction of a ferry that could transport 150 passengers, [[Louis Faidherbe]] quickly saw that the sistem was clearly overrun and decided to construct the first bridge over the [[S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal River]]. The governor of [[Senegal]], Henri de Lamothe decided to take a loan worth five million [[French franc|gold francs]] to construct a new metallic bridge in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]]. After the construction company was selected, they all decided to construct a new metallic bridge with a section capable of turning 90 degrees to allow the passage of ships. The bridge was opened on July 14 1897. In the 2000s, a US$ 27 million rehabilitaion plan has been inaugraiated.

==The first bridge==
The city of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], the first capital of the [[French West Africa]] is situated on an island near the [[estuary]] of the S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/actualites/deplacements_a_l_etranger/2005/fevrier/fiches/senegal/l_ile_saint-louis-le_pont_faidherbe.27707.html|title=Le pont Faidherbe (Ile Saint-Louis)|date=2005-02|work=Le pont Faidherbe (Ile Saint-Louis)|publisher=www.elysee.f|language=french|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> It is separated from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by a thin {{convert|40|km|mi}} strip of sand called the [[Langue de Barbarie]], which starts from [[Nouadhibou]] in [[Mauritania]] and extends all the way to [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]]. The suburbs of Guet Ndar and Ndar-Tout are situated in this area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recherches-africaines.net/document.php?id=344|title=L<U+2019>ouverture de la br<U+00E8>che de la Langue de Barbarie et ses cons<U+00E9>quences, Approche g<U+00E9>omorphologique|date=2006-05|work=L<U+2019>ouverture de la br<U+00E8>che de la Langue de Barbarie et ses cons<U+00E9>quences, Approche g<U+00E9>omorphologique|publisher=www.recherches-africaines.net|language=french|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>
All the way to the 19th century, access to the island was made through boats. The troops, horses and all the equipment of the [[France|French]] colonial army were moved with some very light boats which could break at any moment.

In 1858, [[Louis Faidherbe]], the governor of Senegal, inaugurated the ''Bouteville'' boat that was capable of transporting 150 passengers, animals and all kinds of goods. The boat made ten crosses every day and the costs differed: five [[French franc|centimes]] for a person, 50 centimes for a [[horse]], [[Cattle|cow]] or [[camel]], and two [[French franc|francs]] for a carriage. In less than a year it was obvious that this system was overrun and a second boat was introduced but with no success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salysenegal.net/activites/excursions/excursionssaintlouisouis.htm |title=Saint Louis|work=Saint Louis|publisher=www.salysenegal.net|language=french|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>

[[File:Post Card - Faidherbe Bridge 2.jpg|thumb|right|The old Faidherbe Bridge]]
Seeing this, the [[frigate]] captain Robin, friend of [[Louis Faidherbe]], asked Prince [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Napol<U+00E9>on]], Minister of Algeria and the African Colonies, the approval for the construction of a floating bridge. Opened on July 2, 1865, the bridge had a total length of {{convert|680|m|ft|abb=yes}} (the floating part of the bridge had a length of {{convert|350|m|ft|abb=yes|disp=s}}) and a width of {{convert|4|m|ft|abb=yes}}. The floating part was formed from 40 metal [[Pontoon bridge|pontoons]] which supported a wooden [[Deck (bridge)|deck]]. Three of these pontoons were specially designed so that it could be created a {{convert|20|m|ft|abb=yes}} gap so that large vessels could pass. The bridge was named Faidherbe Bridge by a decree of [[Napoleon III of France]].

The opening in 1885 of the [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]]<U+2013>[[Dakar]] railway increased the traffic over the bridge. The railway reached all the way to Soc and all the goods hauled between the coast and the railway station had to cross over the bridge. To prevent the breakdown of the bridge a special decree was given so that the maximum weight for a vehicle that crosses the bridge to be less than one and a half tonnes. With all its difficulties the bridge remained in service 32 years, until 1897 when it was dismantled.<ref name="Histoire du Pont Faidherbe"/>

==Construction of a new bridge==

In the opening of his speech in the General Council of Senegal, governor [[Henri de Lamothe]] proposed that the country should take a loan for infrastructure development. The council agreed on a loan worth five million [[French franc|gold francs]], much of the money being for the construction of a metallic bridge between Saint-Louis and Soc.<ref name="Histoire du Pont Faidherbe">{{cite web|url=http://www.xibar.net/index.php?action=article&numero=10857|title=La v<U+00E9>ritable histoire du Pont Faidherbe|work=La v<U+00E9>ritable histoire du Pont Faidherbe|publisher=www.senegal-online.com|language=French|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> The loan was approved on November 2, 1892, by the French president [[Marie Fran<U+00E7>ois Sadi Carnot]]. A French bank, CDG, agreed to give the loan with a low [[interest]] of only four percent.<ref name="Histoire du Pont Faidherbe"/>

The [[auction]] was organised by the Ministry of Colonies, which sent five officers to Senegal for evaluation. After examining each one these offers the Faidherbe Bridge Committee selected two of them, from Nouguier, Kessler et Cie, and from Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> de Construction de Levallois-Perret (owned by [[Gustave Eiffel]]).<ref name="Histoire du Pont Faidherbe"/> The Faidherbe Bridge Committee and the technical committee in [[Paris]] agreed that the Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> de Construction de Levallois-Perret project was the best for the site. On the other hand the president of the public works in Senegal and [[Councillor|councilman]] Jean-Jacques Crespin supported the Nouguier, Kessler et Cie project. In the end the contract was awarded to Nouguier, Kessler et Cie at a price of 1.88 million gold francs.<ref name="Histoire du Pont Faidherbe"/>

==Link with King Carol I Bridge==
[[File:Post Card - Faidherbe Bridge 1.jpg|thumb|right|Period post card, illustrating the Faidherbe Bridge]]
There are many myths regarding the construction of the Faidherbe Bridge which are present even today and are depicted in some tourist guides. The construction of the bridge is attributed to Gustave Eiffel.<ref name="Histoire du Pont Faidherbe"/> In general it says that the metallic parts of the bridge represents a gift from the [[Government of France|French Government]] and that the parts were originally designed for the [[King Carol I Bridge]] over the [[Danube|Danube River]] in [[Romania]]. Other sources say that the metallic parts were intended for a bridge in [[Austria<U+2013>Hungary]] over the Danube River in [[Vienna]] or [[Budapest]].<ref name="Histoire du Pont Faidherbe"/> Finally another myth regarding the beams of the bridge says that the parts were intended for an unspecified site but the vessel transporting mysteriously sunk and the authorities in Senegal took advantage of this situation and built a local bridge.<ref name="Histoire du Pont Faidherbe"/>

The information available in Romania for the King Carol I Bridge in [[Cernavoda]], as well as the results of scientists in France, say that the myths are pure fiction.<ref>{{cite book|title=Le pont Faidherbe|editor=Bernard Toulier|publisher=GIA|location=Dakar|date=1967|pages=16|language=French}}</ref> First of all the [[Government of Romania|Romanian Government]] never finalised the construction contract with the company of Gustave Eiffel or with another foreign company, making the decision to build the bridge only with local companies. The Cernavoda Bridge was made entirely by Romanians, fulfilling the design of [[Anghel Saligny]], which was also the supervisor of the site. In these conditions, not knowing if the contract will be approved, it is unlikely that a foreign company would build the whole superstructure of the bridge. On the other hand, in Austria<U+2013>Hungary there was no need to construct a low bridge like the Faidherbe because of the trade routes on the Danube River.<ref>{{cite book|title=Au coeur de la ville. Le pont Faidherbe|editor=Abdoul Hadir A<U+00EF>dara|publisher=Grandvaux|location=Dakar|date=2004|pages=pp 59-65|isbn=2-909550-43-5|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>

==Construction of the metallic bridge==
The new bridge has a metal deck formed with [[rivet]]ed [[girder]]s. The bridge has in total eight [[Span (architecture)|span]]s of which one span of {{convert|42.95|m|ft|abb=yes}}, two spans of {{convert|36.55|m|ft|abb=yes}} and five spans of {{convert|78.26|m|ft|abb=yes}}.<ref name="Expertise du Pont Faidherbe">{{cite web|url=http://www.setra.equipement.gouv.fr/RA/Expertise-du-pont-Faidherbe-a.html|title=Expertise du Pont Faidherbe|date=2006|work=Expertise du Pont Faidherbe|publisher=setra.equipement.gouv.fr|language=French|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> The total length of the bridge is {{convert|507.35|m|ft|abb=yes}} and the width is {{convert|10.5|m|ft|abb=yes}}. The total weight of the deck is {{convert|1500|t|ton|abb=yes}}. The second span from the city is mobile, being capable of turning 45 degrees to let small ships to cross.<ref name="Expertise du Pont Faidherbe"/>

==Opening==
A first opening of the bridge took place in the same day with the ceremonies for the national day of Senegal on July 14, 1897, in the presence of governor Chabi<U+00E9>.<ref name="Expertise du Pont Faidherbe"/> The ribbon for the access zone was cut by the governor's wife, then the officials walked a short distance to the mobile deck, which was opened to allow the passage of the military ship ''L'Ardent''.<ref name="Expertise du Pont Faidherbe"/> 21 cannon shots were fired at dusk and dawn to commemorate the construction of the bridge and on that day there were organised ceremonies including [[Horse racing|horse races]] and [[donkey]] [[Racing|races]]. The second opening was on October 19, 1897, in the presence of [[Andr<U+00E9> Lebon]], the prime minister of the French colonies.<ref name="Expertise du Pont Faidherbe"/>

==Modernisation and rehabilitation works==
After more than 100 years since it was opened the bridge is starting to suffer from [[corrosion]] and it is in need of urgent repair.<ref name="r<U+00E9>habilitation ">{{cite web|url=http://www.afd.fr/jahia/Jahia/home/activite/Transport/op/edit/pid/934|title=S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal : Projet de r<U+00E9>habilitation lourde du pont Faidherbe <U+00E0> Saint-Louis|work=S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal : Projet de r<U+00E9>habilitation lourde du pont Faidherbe <U+00E0> Saint-Louis|publisher=French Development Agency|language=french|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> The rehabilitation works are co financed by the [[French Development Agency]] (AFD) and by the [[Government of Senegal]]. The total cost of the works was estimated to be US$ 27 million, of which US$ 17 million is from AFD and US$ 10 million is from the government.<ref name="r<U+00E9>habilitation "/>
