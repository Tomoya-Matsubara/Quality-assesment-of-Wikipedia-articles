'''Charles-Marie-Georges Huysmans''' ([[February 5]], [[1848]] <U+2013> [[May 12]], [[1907]]) was a [[French people|French]] [[novelist]] who published his works as '''Joris-Karl Huysmans'''; he is most famous for the novel ''[[<U+00C0> rebours]]''. His style is remarkable for its idiosyncratic use of the [[French language]],  wide-ranging vocabulary, wealth of detailed and sensuous description, and biting, satirical wit. The novels are also noteworthy for their encyclopaedic documentation, ranging from the catalogue of decadent [[Latin]] authors in ''<U+00C0> rebours'' to the discussion of the symbology of Christian architecture in ''[[La Cath<U+00E9>drale]]''. Huysmans' work expresses a disgust with modern life and a deep [[pessimism]], which led the author first to the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] then to the teachings of the Catholic Church.

==Parents and early life==
He was born in Paris to a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] father, Godfried Huysmans, who was a lithographer by trade. His mother, Malvina Badin, had been a schoolmistress. He published his works as "Joris-Karl Huysmans", using an approximation of the Dutch equivalent of his [[forename]]s, to emphasize his roots. Huysmans' father died when he was eight years old, and his mother quickly remarried, leaving Huysmans feeling a great deal of resentment against his stepfather, Jules Og, a Protestant who was part owner of a Parisian book-bindery.

Huysmans' school years were unhappy but he obtained a [[baccalaur<U+00E9>at]]. For thirty-two years, he worked as a civil servant for the French Ministry of the Interior, a job he found insufferably tedious. The young Huysmans was called up to fight in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], but was invalided out with dysentery, an experience he described in his early story ''Sac au dos (Backpack)'' (later included in ''[[Les Soir<U+00E9>es de M<U+00E9>dan]]''). 

==Writing career==
{{French literature (small)}}

His first major publication was a collection of prose poems, heavily influenced by [[Baudelaire]], called ''Le drageoir <U+00E0> <U+00E9>pices'' ([[1874]]). They attracted little attention but already revealed flashes of the author's distinctive style. Huysmans followed it with ''[[Marthe]], Histoire d'une fille'' ([[1876]]). The story of a young prostitute, it was much closer to [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] and brought him to the attention of [[Emile Zola]]. His next works were in a similar vein: sombre, realistic and filled with minutely detailed evocations of Paris, the city Huysmans knew intimately. ''Les Soeurs Vatard'' deals with the lives of women in a bookbindery. ''En M<U+00E9>nage'' is an account of a writer's failed marriage (Huysmans himself never married, but had a long-term lover called Anna Meunier). The climax of this early period is the novella ''<U+00C0> vau-l'eau (Downstream or With the Flow)'', the story of a downtrodden clerk, Monsieur Folantin, and his heroic and futile quest for a decent meal. 

This was followed by Huysmans' most famous novel ''[[<U+00C0> rebours]]'' (''Against the Grain'' or ''Against Nature'') ([[1884]]), which featured a single [[Fictional_character|character]], the [[Aesthetics|aesthete]] des Esseintes, and decisively broke from Naturalism, becoming the ultimate example of "[[decadent movement|decadent]]" literature. ''<U+00C0> rebours'' gained further notoriety as an exhibit during the trials of [[Oscar Wilde]] in [[1895]], during which the prosecutor referred to the novel as a "[[Sodomy|sodomitical]]" book. The book also appalled Zola, who felt it had dealt a "terrible blow" to Naturalism. Huysmans began to drift away from the Naturalists and found new friends among the [[Symbolist]] and [[Catholic]] writers whose work he had praised in ''<U+00C0> rebours'', including [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly]], [[Villiers de L'Isle Adam]] and [[L<U+00E9>on Bloy]]. [[St<U+00E9>phane Mallarm<U+00E9>]] was so pleased with the publicity his verse had received from the novel that he dedicated one of his most famous (and most obscure) poems, ''Prose pour des Esseintes'' to its hero.

Huysmans' next novel, ''En rade'', a highly unromantic account of a summer spent in the country, was relatively unsuccessful commercially. In [[1891]], the publication of ''[[L<U+00E0>-Bas (Down There)]]'' attracted considerable attention for its depiction of [[Satanism]] in late [[1880s]] France. The book introduced the character Durtal, a thinly disguised portrait of the author. The later Durtal novels, ''[[En Route (novel)|En Route]]'' ([[1895]]), ''[[La Cath<U+00E9>drale]]'' ([[1898]]) and ''L'Oblat'' ([[1903]]), trace Durtal/Huysmans' conversion to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. ''[[En Route (novel)|En Route]]'' depicts Durtal's spiritual struggle during his stay at a Trappist monastery. ''[[La Cath<U+00E9>drale]]'' finds the protagonist at [[Chartres]], making an intense study of the cathedral and its symbolism. In ''L'Oblat'', Durtal becomes a Benedictine oblate, finally reaching an acceptance of the suffering in the world.

Huysmans was also known for his [[art criticism]]: ''[[L'Art moderne]]'' ([[1883]]) and ''[[Certains]]'' ([[1889]]). He was an early advocate of [[Impressionism]], as well as an admirer of such artists as [[Gustave Moreau]] and [[Odilon Redon]]. He was a founding member of the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie Goncourt]].

Huysmans was made a Chevalier de la [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]] in 1892, but only for his work with the civil service. In 1905, his admirers persuaded the French government to promote him to Officier de la L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur in view of his literary achievements. In the same year, Huysmans was diagnosed with cancer of the mouth. Joris-Karl Huysmans died in 1907 and was interred in the [[Cimeti<U+00E8>re de Montparnasse]], Paris.

==Quotations about Huysmans' style==
Barbaric in its profusion, violent in its emphasis, wearying in its splendor, it is - especially in regard to things seen - extraordinarily expressive, with all the shades of a painter's palette. Elaborately and deliberately perverse, it is in its very perversity that Huysmans' work - so fascinating, so repellent, so instinctively artificial - comes to represent, as the work of no other writer can be said to do, the main tendencies, the chief results, of the Decadent movement in literature. ([[Arthur Symons]], "The Decadent Movement in Literature")

...Continually dragging Mother Image by the hair or the feet down the wormeaten staircase of Syntax. ([[L<U+00E9>on Bloy]], quoted in Robert Baldick, ''The Life of J.-K. Huysmans'')

It is difficult to find a writer whose vocabulary is so extensive, so constantly surprising, so sharp and yet so exquisitely gamey in flavour, so constantly lucky in its chance finds and in its very inventiveness. ([[Julien Gracq]])
