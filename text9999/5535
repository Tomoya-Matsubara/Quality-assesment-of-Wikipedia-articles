'[[Napaljarri (skin name)|Napaljarri]]' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin name]], one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the [[kinship system]] of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans.<ref name="CLC">{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.org.au/People_Culture/kinship/kinship.html|title=Kinship and skin names|work=People and culture|publisher=Central Land Council|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref><ref name="de Brabander">{{cite book|last=De Brabander|first=Dallas|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra|date=1994|volume=2|page=977|chapter=Sections|isbn=9780855752347}}</ref> Thus 'Wintjiya' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.

Wintjiya came from the area north west of Walungurru (the Pintupi language name for [[Kintore, Northern Territory]]) and, like a number of other artists in the region, settled first in [[Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory|Haasts Bluff]] and then at [[Papunya, Northern Territory|Papunya]].<ref name="Birnberg2212"/> Johnson reports that she was born at Mulparingya, 'a swamp and spring to the northeast of Kintore', west of [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]].

==Art==
===Background===
Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher [[Geoffrey Bardon]].<ref name="Bardon">{{cite book|last=Bardon|first=Geoffrey|coauthors=James Bardon|title=Papunya <U+2013> A place made after the story: The beginnings of the Western Desert painting movement|publisher=Miegunyah Press|location=University of Melbourne|date=2007|ISBN=9780522854343}}</ref> Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983.<ref name="Dussart06">{{cite journal|last=Dussart|first=Francoise|date=2006|title=Canvassing identities: reflecting on the acrylic art movement in an Australian Aboriginal settlement|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=30|pages=156<U+2013>168}}</ref> By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally.<ref name="Morphy99">{{cite book|last=Morphy|first=Howard|title=Aboriginal Art|publisher=Phaidon|location=London|date=1999|pages=261<U+2013>316|ISBN=0714837520}}</ref> The first artists, including all of the founders of the [[Papunya Tula]] artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.<ref name="Strocchi06">{{cite journal|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|date=2006|title=Minyma Tjukurrpa: Kintore / Haasts Bluff Canvas Project: Dancing women to famous painters|journal=Artlink|volume=26|issue=4}}</ref> However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]], [[Balgo, Western Australia|Balgo]], and on the [[outstation movement|outstations]], people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.<ref name="Morphy99"/>

===Career===
Wintjiya first painted collaboratively: as one of a group of women who created murals on the Kintore Women's Centre walls in 1994 and then in 1994 joining a painting camp with other women from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to produce 'a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group's shared Dreamings'.<ref name="Johnson307"/> Twenty-five women were involved in planning the works, which included three canvases that were three metres square, as well as two that were three by 1.5&nbsp;metres, and Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations.<ref name="Strocchi06"/> Wintjiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project desite [[cataract]]s interfering with their vision.<ref name="Finnane">{{cite journal|last=Finnane|first=Kieran|date=1997|title=From first canvas to national collections in three years|journal=Artlink Magazine|volume=17|issue=4|url=http://www.artlink.com.au/articles.cfm?id=2820}}</ref> As was the case for [[Makinti Napanangka]], an operation to remove cataracts in 1999 resulted in a new brightness to Wintjiya's compositions.<ref name="Johnson307"/> In the early 2000s she and her sister painted at Kintore, but in 2008 they were working from their home: "the widows' camp ouside her 'son' Turkey Tolson's former residence".<ref name="Johnson307"/><ref name="Johnson305">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|title=Lives of the Papunya Tula Artists|publisher=IAD Press|location=Alice Springs, NT|date=2008|page=305|ISBN=9781864650907}}</ref> Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not confine their activities to painting canvases. The National Gallery of Victoria in 2001 purchased a collaborative [[batik]] work, created in 1994 by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists.<ref name="NGV02">{{cite book|last=Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria|title=Annual Report 2001-2002|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|location=Melbourne|date=2002|pages=72|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/about/resources/ngv2001_2c.pdf}}</ref>

The work of Wintjiya has been included in a survey of the history of Papunya Tula painting, hosted by [[Flinders University]] in the late 1990s. Reviewing the exhibition, Christine Nicholls remarked of Wintjiya's painting ''Watanuma'' that it was a germinal painting, with fine use of muted colour, and showed sensitivity to the relationships between objects and spaces represented in the work.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nicholls|first=Christine|date=1999|title=Twenty Five Years and Beyond: Papunya Tula Painting|journal=Artlink Magazine|volume=19|issue=4|url=http://www.artlink.com.au/articles.cfm?id=72}}</ref> Her painting ''Rock holes west of Kintore'' was a finalist in the 2007 [[National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award]].<ref name="NATSIAA07">{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/museums/exhibitions/natsiaa/pdf/sales_list.pdf|title=Sales information|date=2007|work=National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards|publisher=Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref> This was followed up with another work, ''Country west of Kintore'', being a finalist in 2008.<ref name="NATSIAA08">{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/museums/exhibitions/natsiaa/25/pdf/sales_list.pdf|title=Sales information|date=2008|work=25th National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards|publisher=Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref>
