'''Charles Habib Malik''' ([[1906]] - [[1987]]) ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: <U+0634><U+0627><U+0631><U+0644> <U+0645><U+0627><U+0644><U+0643>) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity|Christian]] philosopher and diplomat.

Born in [[Bterram]], [[Lebanon]], Malik was the son of Dr. Habib Malik and Zarifa Karam. He was educated at the [[American Mission School for Boys]] in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] and the [[American University of Beirut]], where he graduated with a degree in mathematics and physics. He moved on to [[Cairo]] in [[1929]], where he developed an interest in philosophy, which he proceeded to study at [[Harvard]] (under [[Alfred North Whitehead]]) and in [[Freiberg]], [[Germany]] (under [[Martin Heidegger]] in [[1932]].  His stay in Germany, however, was short-lived.  He found the policies of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] unfavorable, and left soon after the they came to power in [[1933]].  In [[1937]], he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in philosophy (based on the [[metaphysics]] in the philosophies of Whitehead and Heidegger) from [[Harvard University]]. He taught there as well as at other universities in the [[United States]].  After returning to Lebanon, Malik founded the Philosophy department at the American University, as well as a cultural studies program.  He remained in this capacity until [[1945]] when he was appointed to be the Lebanese ambassador to the United States and the [[United Nations]]. 

Malik represented Lebanon at the [[San Francisco]] conference at which the United Nations was founded.  He served as a rapporteur for the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]] in [[1947]] and [[1948]], when he became President of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].  The same year, he helped to draft the [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].  He remained as ambassador to the US and UN until [[1955]]. He was an outspoken participant in debates in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and often criticized the [[Soviet Union]].  After a three-year absence, he returned in [[1958]] to preside over the thirteenth session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

Meanwhile, Malik had been appointed to the Lebanese Cabinet.  He was Minister of National Education and Fine Arts in [[1956]] and [[1957]], and [[foreign minister|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from [[1956]] to [[1958]].  While a Minister, he was elected to the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|National Assembly]] in [[1957]], and served there for three years.

Malik returned to his academic career in [[1960]].  He travelled extensively, lectured on human rights and other subjects, and held professorships at a number of American universities including Harvard, the [[American University]] in [[Washington, DC]], [[Dartmouth College]] ([[New Hampshire]]), [[University of Notre Dame]] ([[Indiana]]).  In [[1981]], he was also a [[Pascal Lecturer]] at the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Canada]].  His last official post was with [[The Catholic University of America]] (Washington, DC), where he served as a [[Jacques Maritain]] Distinguished Professor of Moral and Political Philosophy from [[1981]] to [[1983]].  Meanwhile, he had also returned to his old chair in Philosophy at the American University of Beirut ([[1962]] to [[1976]]).

Following the outbreak of the [[Lebanese Civil War]], which raged from [[1975]] to [[1990]], Malik helped to found the [[Front for Freedom and Man in Lebanon]], to defend the Christian cause.  It was later renamed the [[Lebanese Front]].  A [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] Christian, he was the only non-[[Maronite]] among the Front's top leaders, who included [[Kataeb Party (Lebanon)|Phalangist Party]] founder [[Pierre Gemayel]] and former [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President]] and [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] leader [[Camille Chamoun]]. Malik was widely regarded as the brains of the Front, in which the other politicians were the brawn.

Malik was also noted as a theologian who successfully reached across confessional lines, appealing to his fellow [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], and [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelicals]] alike.  The author of numerous commentaries on the [[Bible]] and on the writings of the early [[Church Fathers]], Malik was one of the few Orthodox theologians of his time to be widely known in Evangelical circles, and the evangelical leader [[Bill Bright]] spoke well of him and quoted him.  Partly owing to Malik's ecumenical appeal, as well as to his academic credentials, he served as President of the [[World Council on Christian Education]] from [[1967]] to [[1971]], and as Vice-President of the [[United Bible Societies]] from [[1966]] to [[1972]].

Malik died of cancer in Beirut on [[28 December]] [[1987]]. His son, [[Habib Malik]], is a prominent academic and human rights activist.  He was also survived by his brother, the late Father Ramzi Habib Malik, a prominent Catholic priest who worked tirelessly for the cause of Christian reconciliation with the Jewish people as well as for the belief that the Jewish People are the elder brothers of the Christians.
