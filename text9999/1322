The '''Svalbard Rocket Range''' ({{lang-no|Svalbard Rakettskytefelt}}) or '''SvalRak''' is a [[launch site]] for [[sounding rocket]]s at [[Ny-<U+00C5>lesund]] in [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]]. The site has been in use since 1997 and is owned by [[And<U+00F8>ya Rocket Range]], which is again owned by the [[Norwegian Space Centre]] and the [[Kongsberg Group]]. SvalRak's location at the [[79th parallel north]] makes it well-suited for launching rockets to investigate [[Earth's magnetic field]]. It is used mostly by American, Japanese and Norwegian researchers. It is the world's northern-most launch site.

SvalRak is the world's northern-most rocket launch site, and is located at the 79th parallel north.<ref name=larsen /> This makes it an ideal location for sending instruments into Earth's magnetic field and the polar cups, cleft and cup.<ref name=kingsbay /> It is also used for studying the [[Magnetopause]] and [[aurora borealis]], for which Ny-<U+00C5>lesund is the most convenient location because of its ease of access.<ref name=nysmac /> It is owned by And<U+00F8>ya Rocket Range, which is owned by the Norwegian Space Center (90 percent) and the Kongsberg Group (10 percent). SvalRak has no permanent staff in Ny-<U+00C5>lesund.<ref name=kingsbay /> The main users are American and Japanese and to a less extent Norwegian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/2008-2009/stmeld-nr-22-2008-2009-/9/4/2.html?id=555003 |title=St.meld. nr. 22 (2008-2009) Svalbard |date=17 April 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>
