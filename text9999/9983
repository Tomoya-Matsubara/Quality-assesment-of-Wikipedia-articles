Count '''Nikita Moiseevich Zotov'''<ref name="Hughes423">Hughes 1998, p. 423</ref> ({{lang-ru|<U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438><U+0442><U+0430> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0438><U+0441><U+0435><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0417><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432>}}) (1644<ref name="Encyclopedic Dictionary Short" />&nbsp;<U+2013> December 1717<ref name="Hughes2004-120-121" />) was a childhood tutor and life-long friend of Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]]. Zotov was chosen as Peter's tutor in the late 17th century. Not all historians agree on the quality of Zotov's tutoring; [[Robert K. Massie]], for example, praises his efforts, but [[Lindsey Hughes]] criticizes the education that he gave to the future Tsar.

Zotov left [[Moscow]] for a diplomatic mission to [[Crimea]] in 1680, and returned to Moscow before 1683. He became part of the "Jolly Company", a group of several dozen of Peter's friends that eventually became [[The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters]]. Zotov was mockingly appointed "Prince-Pope" of the Synod, and regularly led them in games and celebrations. He accompanied Peter on many important occasions, such as the [[Azov campaigns]] and the torture of the [[Streltsy]] after their [[Streltsy Uprising|uprising]]. Zotov held a number of state posts, including from 1701 a leading position in the Tsar's personal secretariat. Three years before his death, Zotov married a woman 50&nbsp;years his junior.

===Background===
After the death of [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Alexis]] on 8 February 1676,<ref name="Massie25">Massie 1981, p. 25</ref> Peter's half brother and godfather [[Feodor III of Russia|Feodor]], the "semi-invalid eldest surviving son of [[Maria Miloslavskaya]]",<ref name="Massie26">Massie 1981, p. 26</ref> became the [[Tsar]] of Russia.<ref name="Massie26" /> [[Ivan Miloslavsky]], Feodor's uncle, and chief minister, returned to Moscow from virtual exile as Governor of [[Astrakhan]], his family not having been in power for some time.<ref name="Massie26" /> Ivan Miloslavsky hated the Naryshkins, who included Peter, Peter's mother [[Natalia Naryshkina]], and Natalia's foster father, [[Artamon Matveyev]].<ref name="Massie26" /> When a new ruling family took over, the previous ruling family was usually banished to a ceremonial position somewhere far from Moscow.<ref name="Massie26" /> Instead, Ivan Miloslavsky tried to arrest the Naryshkins, but he only succeeded in capturing Artamon Matveyev. As the new Tsar Feodor was fond of his half-brother Peter and Peter's mother, both were allowed to remain in the [[Kremlin]] in private apartments.<ref name="Massie26" />

Most 17th-century Muscovites received little education, and there were low levels of literacy even among the nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and a small amount of history and geography. Religious scholars were usually the exception to this rule, often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children<U+2014>Feodor, and his sister [[Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna of Russia|Tsarevna Sophia]]<U+2014>received a thorough education from the religious scholars of [[Kiev]], and could speak [[Latin]] and [[Polish language|Polish]].<ref name="Massie26" />

At the age of three, in 1674 or 1675, Peter received a [[Alphabet book|primer]] from Tsar Alexis to help him learn the alphabet;<ref name="Massie27" /> two years later, Tsar Feodor suggested to Peter's mother that he begin his studies.<ref name="Massie27" /> Estimates of the exact year when Peter's tutoring began range widely; numerous authors refer to a starting date as early as 1677,<ref name="Massie27" /><ref name="Kamenski<U+012D>&Griffiths41">Kamenski<U+012D> & Griffiths 1987, p. 41</ref> and as late as 1683,<ref name="<U+0411><U+0435><U+0440><U+0434><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>"><U+0411><U+0435><U+0440><U+0434><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432> 2007</ref><ref name="Hughes3">Hughes 1998, p. 3</ref> though multiple references specifically identify March 12, 1677 as the beginning of Peter's tutoring.<ref name="Boguslavsky487">Boguslavsky 2004, p. 487</ref><ref name="<U+041B><U+0430><U+043C><U+0431><U+0438><U+043D>42-43"><U+041B><U+0430><U+043C><U+0431><U+0438><U+043D> 1844, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> Nikita Zotov, a former church clerk,<ref name="EB1">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/453644/Peter-I|title=Peter I (emperor of Russia)|year=2009|work=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online|publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]|accessdate=28 June 2009}}</ref> or "Duma secretary"<ref name="Bushkovitch179">Bushkovitch 2001, p. 179</ref> from the tax-collection department of the governmental bureaucracy,<ref name="Massie27">Massie 1981, p. 27</ref> was chosen to teach Peter to read and write.<ref name="Massie27" />

===Appointment and instruction===
Zotov was not a religious scholar, but he knew the [[Bible]] well<U+2014>an important qualification for [[Natalia Naryshkina|Tsaritsa Natalia]].<ref name="Massie27" /><ref name="Boguslavsky487" /> Although he did not expect it, he was well rewarded before he had even started his work, receiving from Feodor and the Tsaritsa, as well as [[Patriarch Joachim]], gifts including a set of apartments, two new sets of clothing, and 100 [[ruble]]s.<ref name="Massie27" /> He was also raised to the rank of a [[Russian nobility|minor nobleman]].<ref name="Massie27" /> Zotov was deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the Tsaritsa's request, and was enthralled at the prospect of teaching Peter.<ref name="Massie27" /><ref name="Boguslavsky487">Boguslavsky 2004, pp. 487<U+2013>488</ref> Zotov and Peter quickly became good friends, and Zotov remained close to Peter until the former's death.<ref name="Massie27-28" />

Peter's first lesson began the morning after Zotov was appointed.<ref name="Massie27" /> After the books were sprinkled with [[holy water]], Zotov began his instruction, first in the alphabet, and then the Prayer Book. He taught the Bible, from which Peter learned long passages that he could still recite from memory forty years later.<ref name="Massie27" /> Zotov also taught his student to sing, and in his later years Peter often spontaneously accompanied the choir at church services.<ref name="Massie27" /> Although initially tasked only to teach reading and writing, Zotov found Peter to be intellectually curious, and interested in all that he could impart. Peter asked for lessons on Russian history, battles, and heroes.<ref name="Massie27" /><ref name="Hosking77">Hosking 1998, p. 77</ref> At Zotov's request, the Tsaritsa ordered engravings of "foreign cities and palaces, sailing ships, weapons and historical events" from the Ordnance Office.<ref name="Massie27" /> Zotov placed them in the study room, along with a somewhat accurate [[globe]] for the time, to divert Peter when he became bored with his studies.<ref name="Massie27" /> Informal "makeshift"<ref name="Massie72">Massie 1981, p. 72</ref> tutors, foreign and domestic,<ref name="Massie67-75">Massie 1981, pp. 67<U+2013>75</ref> and servants, taught Peter other subjects, including rowdy outdoor games with live ammunition, royal and military history,<ref name="Massie67-70">Massie 1981, pp. 67<U+2013>70</ref> carpentry, [[Woodworking joints|joinery]], [[blacksmith]] work, printing,<ref name="EB1" /><ref name="Massie70-71">Massie 1981, pp. 70<U+2013>71</ref> and<U+2014>uniquely for Russian nobility at the time<U+2014>sailing and shipbuilding.<ref name="Massie72-75">Massie 1981, pp. 72<U+2013>75</ref>

===Impact===
Zotov became one of Peter's first friends, and the two remained close throughout Zotov's life. Twentieth-century historian [[Lindsey Hughes]] has criticized Zotov for giving Peter an education that did not teach what a future tsar ought to know.<ref name="Hughes3, 463">Hughes 1998, pp. 3, 463</ref> Her contemporary, [[Robert K. Massie]], has argued that the education was the best possible one for a curious boy like Peter, because it was unlikely that he would ever become tsar, as his half-brother, [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan V]], was before him in the line of succession. According to Massie, although Zotov may have not taught Peter at the highest possible level, he delivered "the best education for a mind like Peter's", as it "stimulated [Peter's] curiosity" and allowed him to become "in large part, a self-taught man".<ref name="Massie27-28">Massie 1981, pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref> Zotov's closeness to the Tsar later became a source of worry to others in government, many of whom<U+2014>including even the powerful [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov|Menshikov]]<U+2014>feared his influence.<ref name="Hughes423" />

In 1680, Zotov embarked on a three-year diplomatic mission to the [[Crimea]]; sources disagree on whether this was before or after he tutored Peter.<ref name="Bain208">Bain 1967, p. 208</ref> When Peter left the [[Kremlin]] to spend his childhood at [[Preobrazhenskoye District|Preobrazhenskoye]], two years after Zotov's departure, his memories of the tutors who had taught his siblings, Feodor and Sophia, were so negative that he cut himself off from traditional academic subjects,<ref name="Massie71">Massie 1981, p. 71</ref> although he resumed his studies under Afanassyi Nesterov and Zotov after the latter's return from the Crimea.<ref name="Wittram88">Wittram 1964, p. 88</ref> Massie states that Peter sought to learn of nature and military matters rather than literature or theology,<ref name="Massie71" /> but he did learn a great deal of the latter from his tutors.<ref name="Wittram88" /> Zotov later worked with Peter to translate books about [[fortification]] from a Western European language into Russian.<ref name="Gitermann421">Gitermann 1945, p. 421</ref> Peter also forgot, or did not learn, a great deal about mathematics, a subject that he had to learn properly in his late teens for use in [[siege|siege warfare]] and [[fortification]].<ref name="Williams251-252">Williams 1907, pp. 251<U+2013>252</ref> In later years, Peter regretted his lack of a full education.<ref name="Massie71, 807">Massie 1981, pp. 71, 807</ref>

==Prince-Pope of Drunken Synod==
In 1692, Peter, who by then was Tsar of Russia,<ref name="Massie108">Massie 1981, p. 108</ref> organized himself and several dozen of his friends into [[The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters]], a "[[synod]]" that parodied religion.<ref name="Bushkovitch16">Bushkovitch 1990, p. 16</ref> Zotov eventually became the "Prince-Pope"<ref name="Massie120">Massie 1981, p. 120</ref> of the Synod and was sometimes even referred to as Patriarch [[Dionysus|Bacchus]].<ref name="Hughes2004-31">Hughes 2004, p. 31</ref> Zotov first drank to everyone's health at the mocking celebrations, and then "blessed" the group with the [[Sign of the Cross]], made from two long Dutch pipes.<ref name="Massie119-120">Massie 1981, p. 119<U+2013>120</ref> On holidays, the games were played on the streets of [[Moscow]], and at [[Christmas]], the Jolly Company rode around the city singing on sleighs, with Zotov at their head, on a sleigh pulled by twelve bald men. Zotov wore a highly unusual costume<U+2014>his outfit was adorned with playing cards; he wore a tin hat; and he sat upon a barrel.<ref name="Massie120" /> During the first week of [[Lent]], a procession of "penitents" followed Zotov through the city on donkeys, oxen, and sleighs pulled by goats, pigs, and bears.<ref name="Massie120" />

According to Robert K.

Nikita Zotov died in December 1717 of unknown causes.
