The '''Katyn massacre''', also known as the '''Katyn Forest massacre''' ({{lang-pl|zbrodnia katy<U+0144>ska}}, 'Katy<U+0144> crime'; {{lang-ru|<U+041A><U+0430><U+0442><U+044B><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0440><U+0430><U+0441><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+0435><U+043B>}}), was a [[mass murder]] of [[Poles|Polish nationals]] carried out by the [[Soviet]] secret police [[NKVD]] in April-May 1940. It was based on [[Lavrentiy Beria]]'s proposal to execute all members of the Polish Officer Corps, dated 5 March 1940. This official document was then approved and signed by the entire Soviet [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], including [[Joseph Stalin]] and Beria.<ref name="Fischer">[[Benjamin B.

[[Nazi Germany]] announced the discovery of mass graves in the Katyn Forest in 1943. The revelation led to the end of diplomatic relations between Moscow and the [[London]]-based [[Polish government-in-exile]]. The Soviet Union continued to deny responsibility for the massacres until 1990, when it officially acknowledged and condemned the perpetration of the killings by the NKVD,<ref name="ipn_eng_news_high_katyn_decision"/><ref name="bbc161204">[[BBC News]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4102967.stm "Russia to release massacre files"], 16 December 2004</ref><ref name="TASS">{{ru icon}} [[wikisource:ru:<U+0417><U+0430><U+044F><U+0432><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0422><U+0410><U+0421><U+0421> <U+043E><U+0442> 14 <U+0430><U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+043B><U+044F> 1990 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430>|Text of the original TASS communique released on April 14, 1990]]</ref> as well as the subsequent cover-up.<ref>[[Geoffrey Roberts]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=5GCFUqBRZ-QC&pg=PA171 Stalin's Wars]'', p.171, Yale University Press, 2006, ISBN 0300112041</ref> 

An investigation conducted by the [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Prosecutor's General]] Office of the Soviet Union (1990-1991) and the  [[Russian Federation]] (1991-2004), has confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres. It was able to confirm the deaths of 1,803 Polish citizens and did not classify this action as a [[war crime]] or an act of [[genocide]]. The investigation was closed on grounds that the perpetrators of the massacre were already dead. The Russian government also does not classify the dead as victims of Stalinist repression, which bars [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|formal posthumous rehabilitation]].<ref name="RFERL">"[http://www.rferl.org/content/Russian_And_Polish_Leaders_To_Mark_Katyn_Anniversary/2004394.html?page=1&x=1#relatedInfoContainer  Russian, Polish Leaders To Mark Katyn Anniversary ]".

== Background ==
[[Image:MolotovRibbentropStalin.jpg|thumb|180px|Molotov signs the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. Behind him are Ribbentrop and Stalin.]]
In the wake of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] that started on 1 September, 1939, the Soviet Union declared on 17 September 1939 that the Polish government was no longer in control of its country and that any [[Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|diplomatic agreements]] were thus null and void. On the same day, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Red Army invaded Poland]] from the east,  in accordance with the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. Meanwhile, Britain and France, pledged by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] and [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]] to attack Germany in the case of such an invasion, [[Phoney War|did not take any significant military action]]. This is referred to as the "[[Western betrayal]]."<ref name="PWN_KW">{{pl icon}} [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN|Encyklopedia PWN]] [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/33490_1.html 'KAMPANIA WRZE<U+015A>NIOWA 1939'].

The 43,000 soldiers born in West Poland, then under German control, were transferred to the Germans.

As early as September 19, the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and First Rank Commissar of State Security, Lavrentiy Beria, ordered the NKVD to create the [[Administration for Affairs of Prisoners of War and Internees]] to manage Polish prisoners. The NKVD took custody of Polish prisoners from the Red Army, and proceeded to organise a network of reception centers and transit camps and arrange rail transport to [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s in the western USSR. The largest camps were located at [[Kozelsk]] ([[Optina Monastery]]), [[Ostashkov]] ([[Stolbnyi Island]] on [[Seliger Lake]] near Ostashkov) and [[Starobilsk|Starobelsk]]. Other camps were at [[Jukhnovo]] (rail station "Babynino"), [[Yuzhe]] (Talitsy), rail station "Tyotkino" ({{convert|90|km}} from [[Putyvl]]), [[Kozelshchyna]], [[Oranki]], [[Vologda]] (rail station "Zaonikeevo") and [[Gryazovets]].<ref name="Miednoje_Katyn">[http://www.coldwarhistory.us/Cold_War/Katyn_Massacre/Miednoje__Katyn.htm "The grave unknown elsewhere or any time before ...

Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for [[military officer]]s, while Ostashkov was used mainly for [[Polish Scouting and Guiding Association|Polish boy scouts]], [[gendarmerie|gendarmes]], [[police officer|police]] and [[prison|prison officers]]. Prisoners at these camps were not exclusively military officers or members of the other groups mentioned but also included Polish [[intelligentsia]]. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5,000; Ostashkov, 6,570; and Starobelsk, 4,000. They totaled 15,570 men.<ref name="Zawodny"/>

Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers such as [[Vasily Zarubin]]. The prisoners assumed that they would be released soon,<ref name="diary">[http://www.polandsholocaust.org/katyndiary1.html "The Katyn Diary of Leon Gladun"], English translation of the Polish document. See the entries on 25 December 1939 and 3 April 1940.</ref>  but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die.<ref name="Fischer"/> According to NKVD reports, if the prisoners could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude,<ref name="Zawodny"/> they were declared "hardened and uncompromising enemies of Soviet authority."<ref name="Fischer"/>

On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Stalin from Beria, four members of the Soviet [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] - Stalin, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] - signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish "nationalists and counterrevolutionaries" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]].<ref name="kmw_resolution"/> The reason for the massacre, according to historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]], is that Stalin wanted to deprive a potential future Polish military of a large portion of its military talent: "''It has been suggested that the motive for this terrible step [the Katyn massacre] was to reassure the Germans as to the reality of Soviet anti-Polish policy. This explanation is completely unconvincing in view of the care with which the Soviet regime kept the massacre secret from the very German government it was supposed to impress... A more likely explanation is that... [the massacre] should be seen as looking forward to a future in which there might again be a Poland on the Soviet Union's western border. Since he intended to keep the eastern portion of the country in any case, Stalin could be certain that any revived Poland would be unfriendly. Under those circumstances, depriving it of a large proportion of its military and technical elite would make it weaker.''"<ref>[[Gerhard Weinberg]], ''A World At Arms'', p. 107.

Detailed information on the executions in the Kalinin NKVD prison was given during the hearing by [[Dmitrii Tokarev]], former head of the Board of the District [[NKVD]] in Kalinin. According to Tokarev, the shooting started in the evening and ended at dawn. The first transport on 4 April 1940, carried 390 people, and the executioners had a hard time killing so many people during one night. The following transports were no greater than 250 people.

The killings were methodical. After the personal information of the condemned was checked, he was handcuffed and led to a cell insulated with a felt-lined door.

Newest information published in the 2010 edition of the Polish magazine "Forum" which, among others, deals with historical topics, points to the reason for Stalin's signing the Katyn death warrant as being the discovered intention of the Polish government in exile in London to send a contingent of soldiers to Lapland via northernmost Norway to fight alongside the Finns in the Finnish-Soviet [[Winter War]] of 1939-1940.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The fate of the Polish prisoners was raised soon after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, when the [[Polish government-in-exile]] and the Soviet government signed the [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]] to fight Nazi Germany and form a Polish army on Soviet territory. When the Polish general [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Anders]] began organizing this army, he requested information about Polish officers. During a personal meeting, Stalin assured him and [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sikorski]], the Polish Prime Minister, that all the Poles were freed, and that not all could be accounted because the Soviets "lost track" of them in [[Manchuria]].<ref name="Biuletyn">{{pl icon}} Various authors.

The Germans assembled and brought in a European commission consisting of twelve forensic experts and their staffs from [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Croatia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Romania]], [[Sweden]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Hungary]]. After the war, all the experts, save for a Bulgarian and a Czech, reaffirmed their 1943 finding of Soviet guilt.<ref name="Bauer">Bauer, Eddy. "The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War II". Marshall Cavendish, 1985</ref> The Katyn massacre was beneficial to Nazi Germany, which used it to discredit the Soviet Union. Goebbels wrote in his diary on 14 April 1943: ''"We are now using the discovery of 12,000 Polish officers, murdered by the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]], for anti-Bolshevik propaganda on a grand style. We sent neutral journalists and Polish intellectuals to the spot where they were found. Their reports now reaching us from ahead are gruesome.

The Soviet government immediately denied the German charges and claimed that the Polish prisoners of war had been engaged in construction work west of Smolensk and consequently were captured and executed by invading German units in August 1941. The Soviet response on 15 April to the German initial broadcast of 13 April, prepared by the [[Soviet Information Bureau]], stated that ''"[...]Polish prisoners-of-war who in 1941 were engaged in country construction work west of Smolensk and who [...] fell into the hands of the German-Fascist hangmen [...]."''<ref name="Zawodny"/>

The Allies were aware that the Nazis had found a mass grave as the discovery transpired, through radio transmissions intercepted and decrypted by [[Bletchley Park]]. German experts and the international commission, which was invited by Germany, investigated the Katyn corpses and soon produced physical evidence that the massacre took place in early 1940, at a time when the area was still under Soviet control.<ref name="Davies">Davies, Norman.

When, in September 1943, [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] was informed that the German army had to withdraw from the Katyn area, he wrote a prediction in his diary. His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: ''"Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is going to cause us quite a little trouble in the future.

===Western response===
The resulting Polish-Soviet crisis was beginning to threaten the vital alliance with the Soviet Union at a time when the Poles' importance to the Allies, essential in the first years of the war, was beginning to fade, due to the entry into the conflict of the military and industrial giants, the Soviet Union and the United States. In retrospective review of records, both [[British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] and [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] were increasingly torn between their commitments to their Polish ally, the uncompromising stance of Sikorski and the demands by Stalin and his diplomats.{{Citation needed|April 2010|date=April 2010}}

In private, Churchill agreed that the atrocity was likely carried out by the Soviets. According to the notes taken by [[Edward Raczy<U+0144>ski (1891-1993)|Count Raczy<U+0144>ski]], Churchill admitted on 15 April 1943 during a conversation with General Sikorski: ''"Alas, the German revelations are probably true. The Bolsheviks can be very cruel."''<ref name="Carlton_Churchill">[[David Carlton]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=MTPzJRV9hhgC&pg=PA105 ''Churchill and the Soviet Union''], Manchester University Press, 2000, p. 105; ISBN 0-7190-4107-4</ref> However, at the same time, on 24 April 1943 Churchill assured the Soviets: ''"We shall certainly oppose vigorously any 'investigation' by the International Red Cross or any other body in any territory under German authority. Such investigation would be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism."''<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/correspondence/01/43.htm ''Correspondence between the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Presidents of the USA and the Prime Ministers of Great Britain during the Great Patriotic War of 1941 - 1945''], document <U+2116>. 151, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1953, USSR</ref> Unofficial or classified UK documents concluded that Soviet guilt was a "near certainty", but the alliance with the Soviets was deemed to be more important than moral issues; thus the official version supported the Soviet version, up to [[censorship|censoring]] the contradictory accounts.<ref name="Davies"/> Churchill's own post-war account of the Katyn affair is laconic. In his memoirs, he quotes the 1944 Soviet inquiry into the massacre, which predictably found that the Germans had committed the crime, and adds, ''"belief seems an act of faith."''<ref name="Churchill">[[Winston Churchill|Churchill, Winston]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=ul4FXiT4-9wC&pg=PA680 ''The Hinge of Fate''], 1986 (1950), ISBN 0-395-41058-4.</ref>

In the [[United States]], a similar line was taken, notwithstanding that two official intelligence reports into the Katyn massacre were produced that contradicted the official position. In 1944 Roosevelt assigned his special emissary to the [[Balkans]], Navy Lieutenant Commander [[George Earle]], to compile information on Katyn, which he did using contacts in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. Earle concluded that the massacre was committed by the Soviet Union. Having consulted with [[Elmer Davis]], the director of the [[Office of War Information]], Roosevelt rejected the conclusion (officially), declared that he was convinced of Nazi Germany's responsibility, and ordered that Earle's report be suppressed. When Earle formally requested permission to publish his findings, the President issued a written order to desist. Earle was reassigned and spent the rest of the war in [[American Samoa]].<ref name="Fischer"/>

A further report in 1945, supporting the same conclusion, was produced and stifled. In 1943, two US POWs <U+2013> Lt. Col. [[Donald B. Stewart]] and Col. [[John H. Van Vliet]] <U+2013> had been taken by Germans to Katyn for an international news conference.<ref name="archives.gov"> [[National Archives and Records Administration]], documents related to Committee to Investigate and Study the Facts, Evidence, and Circumstances of the Katyn Forest Massacre (1951<U+2013>52) [http://www.archives.gov/legislative/guide/house/chapter-22-select-katyn-forest-massacre.html online], last accessed on 14 April 2010.

== Judicial proceedings==
From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, seven servicemen of the German [[Wehrmacht]]  were tried by a Soviet [[military court]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. One of them, Arno Diere, was charged with helping to dig the Katyn graves during the execution. Diere, who was accused of murder using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in burial (though not the execution) of 15-20 thousand Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of hard labor. His confession was full of absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet prosecution witness during the [[Nuremberg trials]]. In a note of 29 November 1954 he recanted his confession, claiming that he was forced to confess by the investigators. Contrary to a number of claims<ref name="7_Germans">[[Montr<U+00E9>al Gazette]], Canada, 5 November 1990.

At the London conference that drew up the indictments of German war crimes before the Nuremberg trials, the Soviet negotiators put forward the allegation, "In September 1941, 925 Polish officers who were prisoners of war were killed in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk." The US negotiators agreed to include it, but were "embarrassed" by the inclusion (noting that the allegation had been debated extensively in the press) and concluded that it would be up to the Soviets to sustain it.<ref>S.

===Cold War views===
In 1951 and 1952, in the background of the [[Korean War]], a [[U.S. Congress]]ional investigation chaired by Rep. [[Ray J. Madden]] and known as the Madden Committee investigated the Katyn massacre. It concluded that the Poles had been killed by the Soviets<ref name="Fischer"/> and recommended that the Soviets be tried before the [[International Court of Justice]].<ref name="archives.gov"/> Still, the question of responsibility remained controversial in the West as well as behind the [[Iron Curtain]]. In the United Kingdom in the late 1970s, plans for a memorial to the victims bearing the date 1940 (rather than 1941) were condemned as provocative in the political climate of the [[Cold War]]. It has been sometimes speculated that the choice made in 1969 for the location of the [[Byelorussian SSR|BSSR's]] war memorial at the former Belarusian village named [[Khatyn]], a site of a [[Khatyn massacre|1943 Nazi massacre]] in which the entire village with its whole population was burned, have been made to cause confusion with Katyn.<ref name="Silitski">Silitski, Vitali.

In Poland, the pro-Soviet authorities covered up the matter in concord with Soviet propaganda, deliberately censoring any sources that might provide information about the crime. Katyn was a forbidden topic in [[History of Poland (1945<U+2013>1989)|postwar Poland]]. Not only did government [[censorship]] suppress all references to it, but even mentioning the atrocity was dangerous. Katyn became erased from Poland's official history, but it could not be erased from historical memory. In 1981, Polish [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] erected a memorial with the simple inscription "Katyn, 1940" but it was confiscated by the police, to be replaced with an official monument "To the Polish soldiers <U+2013> victims of Hitlerite fascism <U+2013> reposing in the soil of Katyn". Nevertheless, every year on [[Zaduszki]], similar memorial crosses were erected at [[Pow<U+0105>zki cemetery]] and numerous other places in Poland, only to be dismantled by the police overnight. Katyn remained a political taboo in [[communist Poland]] until the fall of the [[Eastern bloc]] in 1989.<ref name="Fischer"/>

==Revelations==
From the late 1980s, pressure was put not only on the Polish government, but on the Soviet one as well. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history.<ref name="Fischer"/> In 1989 Soviet scholars revealed that Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] admitted that the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: [[Mednoye]] and [[Piatykhatky, Kharkiv oblast|Piatykhatky]].

On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by a Polish association named ''Families of Katy<U+0144> Victims'', to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. [[National Security Advisor (United States)|national security advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]. A [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading "NKVD" on the memorial, covering the word "Nazis" in the inscription such that it read "In memory of Polish officers murdered by the NKVD in 1941." Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds.<ref name="upi301089">[[United Press International]]: Weeping Poles visit Katyn massacre site 30 October 1989</ref> Brzezinski commented that:

<blockquote>It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katy<U+0144>. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.<ref name="bbc011189">[[BBC News]]: Commemoration of Victims of Katyn Massacre, 1 November 1989</ref></blockquote>

Brzezinski further stated that:

His remarks were given extensive coverage on Soviet television.

Chief Military Prosecutor [[Alexander Savenkov]] announced that the investigation was able to confirm the deaths of 1,803 out of 14,542 Polish citizens from three Soviet camps who had been sentenced to death.<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://www.memo.ru/daytoday/5katyn2.htm <U+041E><U+0442><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442> <U+0413><U+0412><U+041F> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+043F><U+0438><U+0441><U+044C><U+043C><U+043E> <U+043E><U+0431><U+0449><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0430> <U+00AB><U+041C><U+0435><U+043C><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0430><U+043B><U+00BB>], 2005</ref> He did not address the fate of about 7,000 victims who had been not in POW camps, but in prisons. Savenkov declared that the massacre was not a [[genocide]], that Soviet officials who had been found guilty of the crime were dead and that, consequently, ''there is absolutely no basis to talk about this in judicial terms''.  116 out of 183 volumes of files gathered during the Russian investigation, were declared to contain state secrets and were classified.<ref name="guardian290405">[[Guardian Unlimited]], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,2763,1472922,00.html "Russian victory festivities open old wounds in Europe"], 29 April 2005, by [[Ian Traynor]].

The Katyn massacre is a major plot element in many works of culture, for example, in the [[W.E.B. Griffin]] novel ''The Lieutenants'', which is part of the ''[[Brotherhood of War (book series)|Brotherhood of War]]'' series, as well as in the [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]] novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' and the ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|film of the same name]]''. Polish poet [[Jacek Kaczmarski]] has dedicated one of his [[sung poetry|sung poems]] to this event.<ref>{{pl icon}} Kaczmarski, Jacek.

Retrieved on 05 August 2008.</ref> In a bold political statement for the height of the Cold War,  [[Du<U+0161>an Makavejev]] used original Nazi footage in his 1974 film ''[[Sweet Movie]]''. The Polish composer [[Andrzej Panufnik]] wrote an orchestral score in 1967 called "Katyn Epitaph" in memory of the massacre.

In 2000, US filmmaker [[Steven Fischer]] produced a [[public service announcement]] titled ''Silence of Falling Leaves'' honoring the fallen soldiers, consisting of images of falling autumn leaves with a sound track cutting to a narration in Polish by the Warsaw-born artist Bozena Jedrzejczak. It was honored with an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]  nomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mddailyrecord.com/2001/05/22/balto-indie-gets-emmy-nod/ |title= Balto. indie gets Emmy nod |publisher=Mddailyrecord.com |date=2001-05-22 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}</ref>

The [[Academy Honorary Award]] recipient Polish film director [[Andrzej Wajda]], whose father, Captain Jakub Wajda, was murdered in the NKVD prison of Kharkov, has made a film depicting the event, ''[[Katyn (film)|Katyn]]''. The film recounts the fate of some of the women<U+2014>mothers, wives and daughters<U+2014>of the Polish officers slaughtered by the Soviets. Some Katyn Forest scenes are re-enacted. The screenplay is based on Andrzej Mularczyk's book ''Post mortem - the Katyn story''. The film was produced by Akson Studio, and released in Poland on 21 September 2007.  In 2008 it was nominated for the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film.
