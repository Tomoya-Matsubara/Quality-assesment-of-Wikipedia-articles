''' No. 664 "Air Observation Post" Squadron, RCAF '''was formed in England during the [[Second World War]]. It was manned principally by [[Royal Canadian Artillery]] (RCA) and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) personnel, with select British artillery pilots briefly seconded to assist in squadron formation.

== History ==
The squadron was formed on [[December 9]], [[1944]], at [[RAF Andover]], its principal role being to direct artillery fire from the air. The pilots were officers recruited from the [[Royal Canadian Artillery]] and trained to fly at [[22 E.F.T.S.]] [[Cambridge]], further developing advanced flying skills at [[43 Operational Training Unit RAF]] (43 OTU), RAF Andover. The first Commanding Officer was Major Dave Ely, RCA; the operational Commanding Officer was Major D.W. Blyth, RCA. In England the squadron operated under the overall control of No. 70 Group, [[RAF Fighter Command]]; prior to deployment to the European continent, the squadron was transferred to No. 84 Group, [[Second Tactical Air Force]] (2 TAF). 

The squadron flew its first operational sortie over the enemy front in Holland on [[March 22]], [[1945]]. The principal aircraft flown in action was the [[Taylorcraft]] [[Auster]] Mk. IV and V. After [[V-E Day]] on [[May 8]], [[1945]], the squadron was tasked with flying mail and passengers for [[1st Canadian Army]]. The squadron continued flying like duties for the Canadian Army Occupation Force (CAOF) until the spring of 1946.

664 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF, was disbanded at Bad Zwischenhahn, Germany, on [[May 31]], [[1946]]. The squadron had no motto or heraldic crest assigned to it.
