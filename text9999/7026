In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]], '''Faramir''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He is introduced as the younger brother of [[Boromir]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] and second son of [[Denethor|Denethor II]], the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] of the realm of [[Gondor]]. The relationships between the three men are revealed over the course of the book and are elaborated in the appendices.

Faramir first enters the narrative in person in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', where, upon meeting [[Frodo Baggins]], he is presented with a temptation to take possession of the [[One Ring|Ruling Ring]]. In ''[[The Return of the King]]'', he led the forces of Gondor during the [[War of the Ring]], coming near to death, and eventually succeeded his father as the Steward and won the love of [[<U+00C9>owyn]] of [[Rohan]].

In ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'' series [[Christopher Tolkien]] described that his father had not foreseen the emergence of Faramir during the writing of the book, only inventing him at the actual point of his appearance in ''The Two Towers''.<ref>{{Harvnb|War of the Ring|1990|loc=Chs. "Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit" and "Faramir"|Ref=War of the Ring}}</ref> J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Tolkien noted that the introduction of Faramir had led to postponement of the book's [[d<U+00E9>nouement]] and to further development of the background for Gondor and Rohan.<ref name="Letter66">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=no. 66}}</ref> Long after completing ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien would write that of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own.<ref name="Letter180">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=no. 180}}</ref>

==Literature==
===Background===
Early years of Faramir's life are described in the main narrative of ''The Lord of the Rings'' only passingly, with more detail revealed in the appendices. It is stated that Faramir was born in the year 2983 of the [[Third Age]]; his father, Denethor II, was a man of noble descent and the heir to the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewardship of Gondor]], ascending a year after Faramir's birth.<ref name="AppB">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc=Appendix B, pp. 368<U+2013>373|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref> Denethor had married [[Finduilas of Dol Amroth|Finduilas]], daughter of Prince [[Adrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]];<ref name="AppA">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc=Appendix A: I (iv), pp. 335<U+2013>6|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref> however, she died untimely when Faramir was five, and is said to have remained to him "but a memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief".<ref name="RK-SK">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc="The Steward and the King", pp. 240, 245<U+2013>7|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref>

After her death Denethor became sombre, cold, and detached from his family, but the relationship between Faramir and [[Boromir]], who was five years older, only grew closer. The brothers greatly loved and highly esteemed each other, and neither in childhood nor in later years was there any jealousy or rivalry between them, even though Denethor openly favoured his elder son.  With a "bossy" brother and a stern father whose great force of character and status as a chief N<U+00FA>men<U+00F3>rean daunted Faramir, Tolkien describes that Faramir was used to giving way and not airing his own opinions.<ref name="Letter244">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=no. 244}}</ref>  Among other things, Faramir displeased his father in that he welcomed the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Gandalf]] who occasionally visited [[Minas Tirith]], the capital of Gondor. Being eager for knowledge, Faramir learned much from Gandalf about the history of the realm and about the death of [[Isildur]].<ref name="AppA"/><ref name="TT-WW">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc="The Window on the West", pp. 278<U+2013>280|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref>

Gondor had long been threatened by the nearby realm of [[Mordor]], and in 3018 the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] began the [[War of the Ring]], attacking the ruined city of [[Osgiliath]] that guarded the passage to Minas Tirith.<ref name="AppB"/> Faramir and Boromir commanded the defence, and were among those few who survived when the eastern half of Osgiliath was captured and the bridges across the [[River Anduin]] were destroyed.<ref name="FR-CE">{{Harvnb|Fellowship|1955|loc="The Council of Elrond", pp. 253, 259|Ref=Fellowship of the Ring}}</ref>

In ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' it is recounted that shortly before the battle Faramir had a prophetic dream, which later often recurred to him and once to Boromir. In this dream a voice spoke about a [[Council of Elrond|council]] that was to be held at [[Rivendell|Imladris]] far to the north, about the awakening of "Isildur's Bane", approaching of "Doom", and appearance of "the Halfling". Faramir decided to journey to Imladris and seek advice of [[Elrond]] the [[Half-elven]], but Boromir claimed the errand for himself, fearing for his brother, and was approved by Denethor and a council of the elders; Faramir remained to defend Gondor.<ref name="TT-WW"/><ref name="FR-CE"/>

====''The Two Towers''====
[[Image:FaramirTrial.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Anke Katrin Ei<U+00DF>mann|Anke Ei<U+00DF>mann]]'s portrayal of Faramir interrogating [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]].]]Faramir first encountered the [[Hobbits]] [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] in [[Ithilien]] and recognized them to be the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir.

One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the [[Anduin]] river after seeing a boat there. It contained the dead body of his brother, who had been killed by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]].

Faramir also asked about the [[One Ring]], but Frodo tried to avoid the subject. Faramir determined that Frodo was carrying one of [[Sauron]]'s great weapons. At this point, he showed the crucial difference between him and his proud brother:

{{cquote|But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were [[Minas Tirith]] falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.<ref name="TT-WW"/>}}

In the Rangers<U+2019> secret refuge behind the waterfall, [[Henneth Ann<U+00FB>n]], Sam accidentally spoke of Boromir<U+2019>s desire for the One Ring, thus revealing the item Frodo was carrying. Despite the Hobbits<U+2019> fears, Faramir was wise enough to realize that such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also realized what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself <U+2014> knowing that Boromir would not have been able to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving them provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, [[Gollum]], was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in [[Cirith Ungol]], where Gollum was leading them.

====''The Return of the King''====
The following evening in [[Cair Andros]], Faramir sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at [[Osgiliath]], while he and three of his men rode to Minas Tirith. Along the way, they were pursued by Sauron's servants, the [[Nazg<U+00FB>l]]. Faramir rode back to help the fallen. Immediately, Gandalf rode out to their aid, temporarily banishing the Nazg<U+00FB>l.

Faramir arrived at Minas Tirith and reported to Denethor and Gandalf of his encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor became angry that Faramir had let Frodo and Sam pass into Mordor with the Ring, instead of bringing the Ring to Minas Tirith to be hidden.

Sauron's second-in-command, the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], led a much larger force from [[Minas Morgul]], and attacked Osgiliath. After Osgiliath was conquered, Faramir decided to stay with the rearguard in order to make sure that the retreat over [[Pelennor]] would not turn into a rout. He was gravely wounded by a [[Southron]] arrow and the [[Black Breath]] of the Nazg<U+00FB>l. Fortunately, all of the mounted soldiers in the city rode to his aid and brought him back to Denethor in Minas Tirith.

When Faramir returned unconscious, Denethor believed him to be fatally injured. That blow, coupled with a vision in the ''[[palant<U+00ED>r]]'' of the forces arrayed against him, caused him to lose his mind. He ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre in the House of Stewards for him and his son. Denethor's temporary Hobbit servant, [[Peregrin Took]], went to alert Gandalf and [[Beregond]], one of the Tower Guards he had befriended. Gandalf and Beregond stopped the impending sacrifice just in time. Mad with grief, Denethor jumped onto the lit pyre, burning himself alive.

Two days later, the battle over, [[Aragorn]] came and revived Faramir with ''[[athelas]]'' in the [[Houses of Healing]]. During his subsequent recuperation there, Faramir met the Lady [[<U+00C9>owyn]] of [[Rohan]]; moved by her sorrow, pride, and beauty, he eventually fell in love with her. At first, <U+00C9>owyn refused his advances, only desiring to go to war to find honour in death. But soon <U+00C9>owyn realized that she had come to love him in return.

Faramir briefly served as a Ruling Steward, and began preparing the city for the arrival of Aragorn, who was now King of Gondor. On the day of the King<U+2019>s official coronation, Faramir surrendered his office. Aragorn, however, announced that as long as his line would last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor.

In addition, Aragorn appointed Faramir as the Prince of Ithilien and Beregond to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company.  As Prince of Ithilien, he and the Prince of Dol Amroth became King Elessar's chief commanders. In a draft to a reader of ''The Lord of the Rings'', J. R. R. Tolkien writes that as Prince of Ithilien, Faramir's duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and cleansing Minas Morgul (an old Gondorian City that Sauron had taken once named [[Minas Ithil]]) of evil remnants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=no. 323}}</ref> Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King<U+2019>s chief counsellor and ruling Gondor in his absence.

With <U+00C9>owyn, he settled in [[Emyn Arnen]], where the two had a son named ''Elboron''. After Faramir<U+2019>s death at the age of 120, his son succeeded him in all of his titles. ''Barahir'', Faramir's grandson, wrote ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'', which was inserted (in an abbreviated form) in the ''[[Red Book of Westmarch|Thain's Book]]'' by the writer Findegil,<ref>{{Harvnb|Fellowship|1954a|loc=Prologue: "Note on the Shire records", p. 23|Ref=Fellowship}}</ref> and appears in ''The Lord of the Rings'' as part of Appendix A. Barahir may have been the son of Elboron, but nothing directly indicates this conclusion.

===Characteristics===
Faramir's personality is prominently described in the appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'':
{{cquote|He read the hearts of men as shrewdly as his father, but what he read moved him sooner to pity than to scorn. He was gentle in bearing, and a lover of lore and of music, and therefore by many in those days his courage was judged less than his brother's. But it was not so, except that he did not seek glory in danger without a purpose.<ref name="AppA"/>}}

Tolkien recorded that Faramir greatly resembled Boromir in appearance,<ref name="AppA"/><ref name="RK-SG">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc="The Siege of Gondor", p. 82|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref> who in his turn is described as "a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance".<ref name="FR-CE"/> Members of the line of the Stewards were wont to be of a nobler appearance and bearing than most of the inhabitants of Gondor;<ref name="AppA"/> in case of Faramir, it is stated that "by some chance the blood of [[N<U+00FA>menor|Westernesse]] [ran] nearly true" in him, which was rare.<ref name="RK-MT">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc="Minas Tirith", pp. 31, 39|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref> This trait was elaborated by Tolkien through the speech of Pippin:
{{cquote|Here was one with an air of high nobility such as Aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the Elder Race. [...] He was a captain that men would follow, [...] even under the shadow of the black wings.<ref name="RK-SG"/>}}

Faramir<U+2019>s leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgement proved valuable in battle, and earned him Gondor's respect during the War of the Ring.<ref name="RK-MT"/> He defended Gondor from Sauron on many fronts, but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake.<ref name="TT-WW"/> Long after completing ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien would write, "As far as any character is 'like me', it is Faramir".<ref name="Letter180"/> Faramir's relationship to war in Tolkien's story reflected that of the author himself, who was a soldier in [[World War I]] and fought in the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]].<ref>{{ME-ref|Bio|"The breaking of the fellowship"}}</ref>

Tolkien bestowed his dream of "darkness unescapable" upon Faramir's character, who relates it to <U+00C9>owyn in the fifth chapter of ''The Return of the King''. Of this, Tolkien wrote, "For when Faramir speaks of his private vision of the Great Wave, he speaks for me. That vision and dream has been ever with me <U+2014> and has been inherited (as I only discovered recently) by one of my children, Michael."<ref name="Letter180"/>

===Names and titles===
The meaning of the name ''Faramir'' was not explained by Tolkien; apparently he intended it to come from [[Sindarin]], an Elven language constructed by him and stated to have been used by the Stewards of Gondor for naming.<ref name="AppAIii">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc=Appendix A: I (ii), pp. 317<U+2013>8|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref> The first part of ''Faramir'' could have been derived from Sindarin stems meaning 'suffice' and 'hunt',<ref>{{ME-ref|LROW|''The Etymologies'', entries PHAR- and SPAR-}}</ref> and the final syllable is likely to have been the same as in his brother's name.<ref>{{ME-ref|RC|note for p. 657}}</ref> ''Boromir'' was described by Tolkien as a name "of mixed form",<ref name="AppF">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc=Appendix F: "Of Men", note 1|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref> and possibly combines Sindarin ''bor(on)-'' 'steadfast' with either Sindarin ''m<U+00EE>r'' or [[Quenya]] ''m<U+00ED>re'' 'jewel'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Etymologies|1987|loc=entries BOR- and MIR-|Ref=The Lost Road}}</ref> However, it is also stated that the Stewards of Gondor often bore names "remembered in the songs and histories of the [[First Age]]",<ref name="AppF"/> without paying a special attention to meaning. Thus one [[Boromir (House of B<U+00EB>or)|Boromir]] appears in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'',<ref>{{ME-ref|Silm|"Of the Coming of Men", p. 148}}</ref> and the appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'' introduce [[Faramir (House of An<U+00E1>rion)|Faramir]], son of King [[Ondoher]] of Gondor,<ref name="AppA-2">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc=Appendix A: I (iv), p. 328|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref> although in this case the name was supposedly in Quenya, as the Kings are stated to have borne High-elven names,<ref name="AppAIii"/> and similarly did Ondoher's elder son, Artamir.<ref name="AppA-2"/>

Throughout ''The Lord of the Rings'', Faramir is given several titles and ranks, such as the '''Captain of Gondor'''<ref name="TT-HSR">{{Harvnb|Two Towers|1954b|loc="Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit", pp. 265<U+2013>6|Ref=Two Towers}}</ref> and '''Captain of the White Tower'''.<ref name="RK-PD">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc="The Pyre of Denethor", p. 131|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref> (Boromir is given the latter title at an earlier point in the storyline,<ref name="AppA"/> and in ''The Two Towers'' he is referred to as Captain-General of Gondor and High Warden of the White Tower.<ref name="TT-HSR"/>) After his father's death, Faramir became the Steward of Gondor,<ref name="RK-PD"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc="The Houses of Healing", p. 138|Ref=Return of the King}}</ref> but only briefly as he laid down his office at the crowning of Aragorn;<ref name="RK-SK"/> Tolkien stated that it was Denethor who was the last of the ''Ruling'' Stewards.<ref name="AppAIii"/> Later Aragorn renewed Faramir's hereditary appointment as '''Steward to the King''', and granted him the titles of the '''Prince of Ithilien''' and '''Lord of Emyn Arnen'''.<ref name="AppAIii"/><ref name="RK-SK"/>

==Concept and creation==
The speed of the relationship of Faramir and <U+00C9>owyn reflects a culture which Tolkien describes to be "less corrupt", and nobler in which the "petty fencing and approaches" of [[courtly love]] is disregarded.<ref name="Letter244" />  A factor in the development of their love came from Tolkien's personal belief that feelings grew quickly in periods of great stress and under the expectation of death.<ref name="Letter244" />  Originally, Tolkien employed the use of ''[[thou]]'' and ''thee'' in ''The Lord of the Rings'' to show a "deliberate change to a form of affection or endearment".<ref name="PM68">{{ME-ref|PM|"The Appendix on Languages", pp. 67<U+2013>68}}</ref> His son has presented the original drafts for the chapter "The Steward and the King", in which such usage was employed to emphasize the relationship's development:

{{cquote|The 'sudden change' to which he referred here ... is possibly to be seen in their first meeting in the garden of the Houses of Healing, where Faramir says ([''The Return of the King''] p. 238): 'Then, <U+00C9>owyn of Rohan, I say to you that you are beautiful', but at the end of his speech changes to the 'familiar' form, 'But thou and I have both passed under the wings of the Shadow' (whereas <U+00C9>owyn continues to use 'you'). In the following meetings, in this text, Faramir uses the 'familiar' forms, but <U+00C9>owyn does not do so until the last ('Dost thou not know?', RK p. 242); and soon after this point my father went back over what he had written and changed every 'thou' and 'thee' to 'you'.<ref name="PM68"/>}}

==Portrayal in adaptations==
===Art===
Faramir appears in several illustrations created by [[John Howe]], [[Ted Nasmith]] and [[Anke Katrin Ei<U+00DF>mann]] for ''The Lord of the Rings'' and related products.<ref>See the illustrations by John Howe: [http://www.john-howe.com/portfolio/gallery/details.php?image_id=3557], [http://www.john-howe.com/portfolio/gallery/details.php?image_id=3558]</ref> One of the scenes from the book that received many depictions is Faramir and <U+00C9>owyn's meeting at the top of Minas Tirith.<ref>[http://www.anke.edoras-art.de/anke_tolkien_lotr6.html Anke Ei<U+00DF>mann's gallery] for Book 6 of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and Ted Nasmith's [http://www.tednasmith.com/lotr3/TN-Eowyn_and_Faramir.html ''<U+00C9>owyn and Faramir''] and [http://www.tednasmith.com/lotr3/TN-The_Sun_Unveiled.html ''The Sun Unveiled''] are prominent examples of art illustrating their meeting.</ref> Ei<U+00DF>mann apparently follows the book in presenting Faramir as dark-haired and beardless, also emphasising his recent recovery in the illustration for the dialogue with <U+00C9>owyn; Nasmith depicts Faramir as bearded and brown-haired.

===Radio===
In the [[BBC]]'s 1981 [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|radio adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'']], Faramir is voiced by Andrew Seear.  The radio drama is known for adhering faithfully to the books, and [[Peter Jackson]] gives BBC's 1981 radio adaptation credit in the production of his film trilogy.<ref name="faithful1">{{cite web |url=http://www.sf-worlds.com/lord-of-the-rings/the-lord-of-the-rings-bbc-1981.html |title=Concerning The Lord of the Rings BBC 1981 |accessdate=2008-02-01 |work=The Lord of the Rings |publisher=Michael Martinez}}</ref><ref name="faithful2">{{cite web |url=http://www.istad.org/tolkien/sibley.html |title=A Masterpiece Worthy of the Masterpiece |accessdate=2008-02-01 |last=Brundige |first=Ellen |date= |work=Pointy ears and Gr<U+00ED>ma<U+2019>s tears |publisher=Istad}}</ref> The characterisation of Faramir follows that of the original closely; the character is able to resist the One Ring, in direct contrast to the portrayal in Peter Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]].

===Film===
In [[Rankin/Bass]]' 1980 adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', a dark-haired man is shown next to [[<U+00C9>owyn]] in greeting [[Aragorn]] as he arrives to Minas Tirith. This character could be interpreted as Faramir.<ref>[http://www.cedmagic.com/featured/tolkien/rotk-2-4013-eowyn-faramir.html CedMagic.com]</ref>
[[Image:Faramir ride.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[David Wenham]] as Faramir in Peter Jackson's ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' movie trilogy]]
In the [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''Lord of the Rings'' movie trilogy]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]], Faramir is played by [[David Wenham]]. The actor jokes that he got the role because he and [[Sean Bean]], who played Boromir, both had large noses.<ref>''Cameras in Middle-earth: Filming The Two Towers'', DVD Documentary</ref> Faramir and his brother's appearances were slightly altered from the book: in the films, they have fair hair and are slightly bearded, whereas in the book they were dark-haired and, following a statement in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'',<ref>{{ME-ref|UT|"History of Galadriel and Celeborn": "Of Amroth and Nimrodel"}}</ref> lacked beards.

The plot of the second film, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'', introduces a significant deviation from the book: Faramir does not at first let Frodo, Sam, and Gollum go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Gondor. He takes them to Osgiliath and not until the Nazg<U+00FB>l attack the city and Frodo comes under the threat of capture does he release them. This change received some criticism, and the character in the film was jokingly dubbed "Filmamir" or "Farfromthebookamir", among other names.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Reading Room | work=Caption Contest 33!!!!!!!!!!!! - Filmamir! er... Farfromthebookamir! No wait... it's Faramir! | url=http://www.theonering.com/articles/9839,1.html | accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref>

Jackson's explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo and Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol was moved to the third movie, and so a new [[climax (narrative)|climax]] was needed.<ref name="NextReel">{{cite web | title=The Next Reel | work=GreenCine | url=http://www.greencine.com/article?1=1&action=view&articleID=62&pageID=104 | accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref> In fact, according to the timeline given by Tolkien, Frodo and Sam had only reached the [[Black Gate (Middle-earth)|Black Gate]] at the time of the fall of [[Isengard]].<ref name="AppB"/> Jackson also argues that it was necessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because in his films everyone else was tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent in the eyes of a film audience.<ref name="NextReel"/> Co-screenwriter Philippa Boyens and actor David Wenham defended the changes to Faramir's character in order to increase dramatic tension: Faramir's "sea-green incorruptible" nature in the book would not have "[translated] well filmically".<ref>{{cite web | title=Understanding | work=There He Came | publisher = Shandy | url=http://minas-anor.net/faramir/tttpositive.htm | accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> Wenham (who had not read the book until after filming had commenced) also found Tolkien's original "dramatically dead".<ref>{{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings film trilogy - From Book to Script: Finding the Story | medium = DVD | publisher = New Line Cinema, 2003}}</ref>

Some fans remain unconvinced by the cast and crew's justifications,<ref>{{cite web | last =Eskew | first =Phil | title=The Two Towers | work=The Nit Picker's Guide to the Lord of the Rings | date =2004-12-28 | url=http://jackflannel.org/lotr/#ttt | accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> and others note that Faramir was rendered too much like Boromir and thus the contrast between the two was severely weakened.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bitterness | work=There He Came | publisher = Shandy | url=http://minas-anor.net/faramir/tttnegative.htm | accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> A scene that received additional criticism is the Rangers' treatment of Gollum, who is beaten up, and Faramir's implicit compliance.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Nature of Faramir: A Response | work=Old Special Reports | publisher = TheOneRing.net | date =2002-12-24 | url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2002/12/24/25942-a-response-to-nz-strider/ | accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The Faramir Changes: Arguments Against | work=Old Special Reports | publisher = TheOneRing.net | date =2003-02-12 | url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2003/02/12/25820-the-faramir-changes-arguments-against-2/ | accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> In the book, Faramir called the creature ''Sm<U+00E9>agol'' instead of ''Gollum'', and told his men to "treat him gently, but watch him".<ref>{{Harvnb|Two Towers|1954b|loc="The Forbidden Pool", p. 300|Ref=Two Towers}}</ref>

In the extended edition of ''The Two Towers'', Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him in favour of Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the book, but his father's favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that the extended edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/440/440963p4.html |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Special Extended Edition) |page=4 |accessdate=2008-02-01 |last=Conrad |first=Jeremy |date=2003-11-23 |work=Reviews |publisher=IGN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theonering.com/articles1-13821/ReviewTheTwoTowersExtendedEditionBetterworseorjustplainsilly |title=Review: The Two Towers Extended Edition - Better, worse, or just plain silly? |accessdate=2008-02-01 |author=Jonathon |date=2003-11-03 |work=News |publisher=The One Ring}}</ref>

===Video games===
Faramir is a bonus playable character in the video game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|The Return of the King]]''. In a bonus video track within this game, Wenham says that "Faramir and Boromir were brothers, and it isn't beyond possibility that Faramir would have gone to Rivendell instead. And if that happened, Faramir would have survived and returned to Gondor."<ref>{{cite video|title=[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' video game]] He serves in place of his brother as the ninth character.|medium=CD|publisher=EA Games, 2003}}</ref>

He also appears as a playable hero in E.A.'s [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth|The Battle for Middle-earth]], and [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II|The Battle for Middle-earth II]] as well as its expansion pack, [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]. Faramir has the unique ability within the game to change between 3 different classes, at the beginning of battle Faramir is set as an Archer but can be changed to use his sword for melee combat and can change to a rider for cavalry assaults. While in archer form he has reasonable attack strength but lacks the speed of Legolas. Faramir has the ability to raise the experience of a select group of archers once he reaches a certain level.

Faramir appears as a playable hero in [[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]. Faramir can be controlled in the Osgiliath level were you need to defend the city against battalions of orcs and afterwards defend the ring bearer Frodo until he reaches the city limits.

He also makes a guest hero appearance twice in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]. As with Conquest Faramir appears to help you during the Osgiliath level and helps the party take on the Orc leader [[Gothmog (Third Age)|Gothmog]]
