The '''New England Hurricane''' (or '''Great New England Hurricane''' or '''Long Island Express''') of [[1938]] was the first major [[hurricane]] to strike [[New England]] since [[1869]].  It killed 500-700 people and caused $6.0 billion (2004 USD) in damages.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|1938 New England hurricane track.png}}
The storm formed as a [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] in the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]].  It reached Category 5 status north of the [[Bahamas]] around [[September 20]] before turning northward. This storm was extremely unusual in that its forward speed approached 70 mph (110 [[km/h]]); this speed has an additive effect on the wind speeds in the right hand quadrant of the storm and allowed the hurricane to travel far to the north before it had a chance to weaken (much like [[Hurricane Wilma]] in [[2005]]).

The hurricane was forecast by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Weather Service]] to curve out into the Atlantic Ocean but instead continued almost due north. It made landfall in [[Suffolk County]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York]] on [[September 21]], [[1938]] as a strong Category 3 hurricane on the present-day [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] with a central pressure of 946 [[mbar]] ([[pascal|hPa]]) [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastint.shtml]. It then travelled across [[Long Island Sound]] into [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], and finally into [[Canada]] while still travelling at an unusually high speed.

==Impact==

While hurricanes sometimes cause extensive freshwater flooding, this one did not because it did not spend much time over any one place. The majority of the damage was from [[storm surge]] and wind damage.

The right hand quadrant of the storm travelled up to the west of [[Narragansett Bay]], causing a high storm surge to the east of Long Island.  The surging water created the present-day [[Shinnecock Inlet]] by carving out a large section of barrier island separating [[Shinnecock Bay]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Winds also forced a storm surge up into the capital city of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]].

Many homes and structures along the coast were destroyed as well as many structures inland along the hurricane's path [http://www.thetranscript.com/Stories/0,1413,103~9044~3042528,00.html]. The hurricane also devastated the forests of New England.  Damage is estimated at $6 billion ([[2004]] [[USD]]) [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastcost2.shtml], making it among the most costly hurricanes to strike the U.S. mainland.  It is estimated that if an identical hurricane struck today it would cause $23.5 billion ([[2004]] [[USD]]) in damage [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/costliesttable3.html].

It is estimated that 600 people died in the storm in New England and up to 100 people elsewhere in the path of the storm [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastdeadlyapp1.shtml?].

This hurricane is remembered locally as "The Long Island Express" for its unprecedented forward speed when it first made landfall on Long Island.
