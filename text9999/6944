==History==
===Mauryan dynasty===
[[Image:Ashoka Rock Edict at Junagadh.jpg|thumb|Ashoka's Rock Edict at Junagadh]]
An impressive fort, Uperkot, located on a plateau in the middle of town, was originally built during the [[Mauryan dynasty]] by [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] in 319 [[Common Era|BCE]] The fort remained in use until the 6th century, when it was covered over for 300 years, then rediscovered in 976 CE The fort was besieged 16 times over an 800-year period. One unsuccessful siege lasted twelve years.

An inscription with fourteen [[Edicts of Ashoka]] is found on a large boulder within 2&nbsp;km of Uperkot Fort.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=rs0ThKx9MHoC&printsec=titlepage&dq=junagadh#PPA36, M1   Ranchodji Amarji, ''T<U+00E2>rikh-i-Sora<U+1E6D>h: A History of the Provinces of Sora<U+1E6D>h and H<U+00E2>l<U+00E2>r in K<U+00E2>thi<U+00E2>w<U+00E2>d,'' pp. 36-46, Trubner & Co. (1882) - translation of the edicts.]</ref>   The inscriptions carry [[Br<U+0101>hm<U+012B> script|Brahmi]] script in a language similar to [[Pali]] and date back to 250 BCE On the same rock are inscriptions in Sanskrit added around 150 CE by Mahakshatrap [[Rudradaman I]], the [[Saka]] (''[[Scythian]]'') ruler of [[Malwa]], a member of the [[Western Kshatrapas]] dynasty.<ref>[http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/Docs/HISTORY/PRIMARYDOCS/EPIGRAPHY/JunagadhRockInscription.htm   "Junagadh Rock Inscription of Rudradaman", ''Project South Asia''.]</ref>  Another inscription dates from about 450 CE and refers to [[Skandagupta]], the last Gupta emperor.  Old rock-cut [[Buddhist]] "caves" in this area, dating from well before 500 CE, have stone carvings and floral work. There are also the Khapra Kodia Caves north of the fort, and the Babupyana Caves south of the fort.

The [[Maitraka]] dynasty ruled Gujarat in western India from 475 to 767 CE The founder of the dynasty, general Bhatarka, a military governor of Saurashtra peninsula under the [[Gupta empire]], established himself as the independent ruler of Gujarat approximately in the last quarter of the 5th century.  However, [[James Tod]] states Maitraka rule ended as early as 524 CE.<ref>James Tod, ''Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan,'' vol. I (2002), pp. 177, 187.</ref>

===Solanki dynasty===
The [[Solanki]], of the [[Chalukya]] dynasty, ruled Gujarat in the 11th and 12th centuries.  The two large step wells (vavs) of Uperkot Fort were both commissioned by Rah Navghan I (1025-1044 CE)Muslims conquered Gujarat in 1299 and the [[Sultanate of Gujarat]] was formed in 1407. [[Mahmud Begada]] (Mahmud Shah I) invaded Junagadh in 1467. The city was annexed to the Gujarat Sultanate; the city foundation was laid for Mahmudabad in 1497.  Strong embankments were raised along the river, and the city was adorned with a palace, handsome buildings and extensive gardens.  When the Portuguese took over the ports of [[Diu, India|Diu]] and [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]] in the 16th century, a fifteen-foot cannon, made in Egypt in 1531, was abandoned at Uperkot Fort by a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] admiral opposing the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forces at Diu.

===Mughal rule===

Mohammad Bahadur Khanji I<!-- JALPESHC ?-->, who owed allegiance to the Sultan of [[Ahmedabad]], founded the state of Junagadh by expelling the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor and declaring independence in 1748. Mohammad Bahadur Khanji I, who assumed the name "Zaid Khan" when he came to power in Junagadh, was the founder of the [[Babi]] dynasty.

===British period===
[[File:Drapeau Junagadh.png|right|thumb|Flag of Junagadh, during British period]]
In 1748 Junagadh state founded. In 1807 it becomes British protectorate. The [[East India Company]] took control of the state by 1818, but the Saurashtra area never came under the direct administration of [[British India]]. Instead, the British divided the territory into more than one hundred princely states, which remained in existence until 1947. The present old town, developed during the 19th and 20th centuries, is one of the former [[princely state]]s which were outside but under the suzerainty of [[British India]].

The [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Junagadh]] was constructed on the land presented by Jinabhai (Hemantsingh) Darbar of Panchala, and dedicated on Friday, 1 May 1828 A.D.

===Accession of Junagadh to India===

{{Main|Indian Integration of Junagadh}}

During the period spanning the independence and [[partition of India|partition of India and Pakistan]] in 1947, the 562 [[princely state]]s that had existed outside [[British India]] under British [[suzerainty]] were given a choice of acceding to either [[India]] or [[Pakistan]] or remaining outside them. Although the states were theoretically free to choose, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten]] stated that "geographic compulsions" meant that most of them would choose India. Mountbatten took the position that only states that shared a common border with Pakistan should choose to accede to it, but he had no power to impose this point of view on the states.

*15 Aug 1947                Accedes to Pakistan.
*15 Sep 1947                Accession to Pakistan accepted.
*9 Nov 1947                 Occupied by India.
*10 Nov 1947                Rescinds accession to Pakistan, accedes to India
*24 Feb 1948                Referendum approves accession to India.
*25 Feb 1948                Accession to India in effect.

On September 15, 1947, Nawab [[Muhammad Mahabat Khanji III|Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III]] of Junagadh, a princely state located on the south-western end of [[Gujarat]] and having no common border with Pakistan, chose to accede to Pakistan ignoring Mountbatten's views, arguing that Junagadh adjoined Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh &mdash; [[Mangrol]] and [[Babariawad]] &mdash; reacted by declaring their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India.  In response, the nawab of Junagadh militarily occupied the two states. Rulers of the other neighbouring states reacted angrily, sending troops to the Junagadh frontier, and appealed to the Government of India for assistance. A group of Junagadhi people, led by [[Samaldas Gandhi]], formed a government-in-exile, the ''Aarzi Hukumat'' ("temporary government").<ref>{{Harvnb|Lumby|1954|pp=237<U+2013>238}}</ref>

India believed that if Junagadh was permitted to accede to Pakistan, communal tension already simmering in Gujarat would worsen, and refused to accept the Nawab's choice of accession.  The government pointed out that the state was 96% Hindu, and called for a plebiscite to decide the question of accession.  India [[blockade|cut off]] supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and occupied the [[principality|principalities]] of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lumby|1954|p=238}}</ref>

Pakistan agreed to discuss a plebiscite, subject to the withdrawal of Indian troops, a condition India rejected.  On 26 October, the Nawab and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops. Before leaving, the Nawab had emptied the state treasury of its cash and securities.

On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State's administration. The Dewan of Junagadh, Sir [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]], the father of the more famous [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]], decided to invite the [[Government of India]] to intervene and wrote a letter to Mr. Buch, the Regional Commissioner of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] in the Government of India to this effect.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.hellojunagadh.com/history_letter.aspx
|title=Letter Inviting India to Intervene
|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref>

The [[Government of Pakistan]] protested, saying that since the Nawab had chosen to accede to Pakistan, the Dewan had no authority to negotiate a settlement with India. Also, if India could acquire Kashmir (with an overwhelming Muslim majority) because its ruler had decided to accede to India, then Pakistan could claim Junagadh

The government of India rejected the protests of Pakistan and accepted the invitation of the Dewan to intervene.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lumby|1954|pp=238<U+2013>239}}</ref> A [[plebiscite]] was conducted in February 1948,but it was not internationally monitored and Pakistan claims was not based on the plebiscite but on the logic of Kashmir Annexation, which went almost unanimously in favour of accession to India.<ref name=Furb359>{{Harvnb|Furber|1951|p=359}}</ref> Junagadh became a part of the Indian state of Saurashtra until 1 November 1956, when Saurashtra became part of [[Bombay state]]. In 1960, Bombay state was split into the linguistic states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]], in which Junagadh was located.
