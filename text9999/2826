According to his Grand Hustle website, T.I. has a clothing line; ''AKOO'' (A King Of Oneself) launching in spring 2007.

==Background==
T.I. grew up in the [[Bankhead (Atlanta)|Bankhead]] neighborhood of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], born to Violetta and Clifford Harris Sr. His original stage name, T.I.P., stems from his childhood nickname "Tip", which he got from his grandfather. T.I. was first exposed to hip-hop at the age of seven, and by the time he was 11 he had decided to pursue a career in rap seriously, he signed his first record deal at age 19.

Due to his [[Southern American English|Southern]] drawl, many fans mistook his name for "Chip", so he began spelling it out "T.I.P". Upon signing with [[Arista Records]] subsidiary [[LaFace Records]] in 2001, he shortened his name to T.I. out of respect for label mate [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]]. 

He is also known to go by "Rubberband Man" and the self-proclaimed "King of the South" (which has created several cases of controversy between other southern rappers, such as [[Lil' Flip]] and [[Ludacris]]). He served as [[Bow Wow]]'s ghostwriter for a while, he also wrote about 30% percent of his third album [[Unleashed (Bow Wow album)|Unleashed]], he wrote the 3rd verse and chorus to his single "Let's Get Down".<ref>Yahoo Music.  [http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12043613 "Bow Wow Says 'Let's Get Down'"]</ref> He has written [[lyrics]] for other artists such as [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], [[Ciara]] & [[Lil Kim]].

T.I. is known for his rapid-fire delivery of lyrics, there were also some noticeable changes in the way he flowed through out his career. Earlier in his career he flowed in a slow-like, southern fashion which can be heard in songs like "I'm Serious", "24's" and "Never Scared". In the second era of his career, he sound more relaxed and laid back (ex. "Bring Em Out","Soldier",What You Know,"U Don't Know Me" & "ASAP"). Later on in his career his flow went from a slow and drowsy effect (ex. Top Back, and Drive Slow) to a faster flow which can be heard in "We Takin Over", "My Love", "Make It Rain Remix" & I'm a Flirt Remix. T.I.'s flow continues to change through out every song he appears on.

==Music career==
=== I'm Serious ===
His debut album ''[[I'm Serious]]'' was released through [[Arista Records]], which spawned the single of the same title which featured [[reggae]] vocalist [[Beenie Man]]. His debut album included [[Pharrell Williams]] of [[The Neptunes]] (who named him the [[Jay-Z]] of the south), [[Jazze Pha]] and [[Youngbloodz]]. Production by [[Pharrell]], [[DJ Toomp]], and The Grand Hustle Team. However, the album did not sell very well, and he was dropped from the label. The album sold 268,000 copies.

T.I. released the first single "I'm Serious" with [[Beenie Man]]. The single had little airplay, but failed to meet the charts. The label wouldn't release another single or video for the album, so he went and created a video for "Dope Boyz", the video nor the single been released.

He released several mixtapes with the assistance of [[DJ Drama]], which created an underground buzz. He resurfaced in the summer of 2003 on [[Bonecrusher]]'s song "Neva Scared". He parlayed this attention towards the release of his second album, ''[[Trap Muzik]]''. Undaunted, he formed [[Grand Hustle Records]] (distributed by [[Atlantic Records]]) in 2003 with his manager Jason Geter. T.I. and Jeter decided to create the label shortly after being dropped by [[Arista Records]].

=== Trap Muzik ===
T.I. released ''Trap Muzik'' in the summer of 2003 and it debuted #4 and sold 193,000 copies in its first week.<ref name"">{{cite web

The album featured guest appearances by [[Eightball & MJG]], [[Jazze Pha]], [[Bun B]], & Macboney and producers include [[Jazze Pha]], [[Kanye West]], [[David Banner]], & [[DJ Toomp]]. The success of the album was followed by some controversy: while on tour, T.I. was charged with violating his [[probation]] over a [[2003]] drug charge, and turned himself in. He was sentenced to three years in [[prison]]. While there he was granted rights to film the [[music video]] for "Let's Get Away".

=== Urban Legend ===

T.I. released his third album ''[[Urban Legend (album)|Urban Legend]]'' in late 2004. ''Urban Legend'' instantly generated crossover success with the hit single "[[Bring Em Out (T.I. song)|Bring 'Em Out]]". He used a sample from [[Jay-Z]]'s "What More Can I Say" from ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]'' to create the hook.

==Acting career==
[[Image:ATL. Poster.jpg|190px|thumb|left]]
In the Spring of 2006, T.I. starred in his first film, [[ATL (film)|ATL]]. The other cast members included [[Lauren London]], [[Big Boi|Andre Patton]], [[Evan Ross]], [[Mykelti Williamson]], [[Jason Weaver]], and [[Keith David]]. The movie was written by Tina Gordon Chism and [[Antwone Fisher]], produced by Timothy M. Bourne, [[Tionne Watkins]], and [[Will Smith]], and directed by [[Chris Robinson (director)|Christopher Robinson]]. T.I. played the character Rashad Swann, an orphaned 17-year-old senior in high school. He grew up on the southside of [[Atlanta]]. He lives with his uncle and has a younger brother named Ant. In its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $11.5 million, ranking third in the United States box office, and went on to gross $21.2 million nationwide.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=atl.htm "ATL Box Office"]</ref>

T.I. will be starring in an upcoming [[Ridley Scott]] film called [[American Gangster]], a Scarface-like flim with [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winners [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Russell Crowe]], and fellow rappers [[Common (rapper)|Common]] & [[RZA]] about a police detective (Crowe) pursuing a [[Harlem]] drug lord (Washington) during the 1970s. This movie is based on the life of [[Frank Lucas (criminal)|Frank Lucas]], which T.I. will be starring as his nephew. T.I. stated working with the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winners is an honor and he feels like he's going to school and learning the best from them.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/movies/news/articles/1538156/story.jhtml "T.I. To Star With Oscar Favorites Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe"]</ref>

T.I. and his partner Jason Geter have sold a script entitled "For Sale" to New Line Cinema. 
Launching the film division of Tip and Geter's Grand Hustle Entertainment, the script takes place in an Atlanta used-car lot. Reports say T.I. may play one of the salesmen. Toby Emmerich of New Line apparently secured the deal. Emmerich, Sam Brown and Jeff Katz will supervise the film on behalf of New Line. He is also working on another film from the company called "Random Check".

==Disputes==
In 2004, T.I. received an early release from incarceration, and returned to music with some disparaging words for rival rappers [[Lil' Flip]] and [[Ludacris]].

===Ludacris===
T.I. called out [[Ludacris]] over an old disagreement their crews had with one another. Ludacris made a [[music video]] in which a person in a shirt that resembled a ''Trap Muzik'' shirt was seen being beaten, and, although Ludacris stated in an interview on MTV.com that the person in the video was wearing a Trap Records shirt, a label owned by DTP member Titti Boi, the feud progressed. T.I. later recorded a song, 'Stomp', with [[G-Unit]] rapper [[Young Buck]] originally featuring [[Lil Jon]]. T.I.'s verse seemed like an insult to Ludacris and Young Buck did not want to be a part of it. Young Buck told Ludacris about this and Ludacris decided to get on the same song and insult T.I. 

T.I.'s verse was omitted from the original track listing and replaced with [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], though the version of the song with T.I.'s verse is still available on many file-sharing networks.

T.I. referenced this in his song "I'm Talkin' to You" on ''King'': <blockquote>"Had it out with 'Cris but he still my nigga / Sat down, civilized, talked about it like niggas." </blockquote> This served to eliminate Ludacris as a target of the song, which many believe to be directed toward [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]]. T.I. revealed that he wasn't talking about anyone, he just made the record to see whoever has a problem with him so they can speak out.  [[Ludacris]] and T.I. squashed their beef.  They been seen greeting each other on "MTV My Block: Atlanta" and both won two Grammys each.

===Lil Flip===
He was also engaged in a high-profile battle with Houston rapper [[Lil Flip]], who he heard insulted him on stage at a concert in Atlanta while he was incarcerated. T.I. believed that Flip mocked his claim as the "King of the South". Apparently, T.I. only learned of the alleged insult through a friend of T.I.'s girlfriend. T.I. says he heard from several sources, and even has a tape, of Flip insulting him at a few Atlanta concerts. Flip's alleged treason supposedly happened when T.I. was locked away in jail in spring. Lil Flip is said to have asked different audiences who the king of the South was before telling the crowd to inform hometown hero T.I. that "the game was over." T.I. says he heard this was followed by the Houston rapper performing "Game Over."

The members of his clique were holding up old publicity shots of Lil' Flip dressed in a leprechaun outfit. One picture has Flip holding a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal, the other one has Flipper in a fighting stance. Both flicks have been blown up to poster-size and copied several times.

The two released numerous insults on mixtapes and on the radio. [[UGK]]'s own [[Pimp C]] mentioned in his song "Knocking Doors Down" that [[Lil Flip]] and T.I. are acting like "little boys" and they needed to squash their beef.

It has been said that T.I. went there to create a DVD exposing [[Lil Flip]] to be a fraud. The same day T.I. went on a [[Houston]] radio station talking about the altercation. He revealed that he had the tape and he was going to release it with an upcoming mixtape, but that didn't happened due to the fact that [[J. Prince]] stopped him for distributing the tape. It is unknown that T.I. still has the tape or not. The feud was squashed by Rap-A-Lot's J. Prince after having them to sit down and squash their beef behind closed doors. The feud was documented by the [[Houston Press]].<ref name"">{{cite web

T.I. released a mixtape titled "Down With the King" featuring several tracks insulting Flip directly. Including a track titled 99 Problems Freestyle. The entire song is devoted to making fun of Flip and dissing him. The chorus of the track is even "I got 99 problems, Lil' Flip ain't one."

On T.I.'s album ''[[King (T.I. album)|King]]'', there are several tracks which have been disputed by the hip hop community to be shots at Lil Flip ("What You Know", "You Know Who" and "I'm Talkin to You"). In an interview with a popular online hip hop website on [[March 24]], [[2006]], T.I. was quoted as saying he and Lil Flip have no beef. This is somewhat contradictory to the events that occurred during Young Dro's video "Shoulder Lean". As Young Dro delivers the line "Lucky Charm Diamonds, but nah, I ain't Flip". T.I. is seen making a laughing gesture towards the video camera. The beef seems to be squashed as Flip said in a recent freestyle:

<blockquote>"How much money you got, nigga, what's in your vault/talk the talk, walk the walk, Rest in Peace to Big Hawk/ and Fat Pat/got a blue car and a black 'lac/used to wear throwbacks, but now that's played out/put my name in a verse, you get yo ass laid out/so don't talk about Flip no mo/and no I ain't got beef with Tip no mo".</blockquote>

==Community work==
T.I. has stepped up his community involvement as well, taking the lead on several initiatives to help the victims devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]], including personally donating $50,000 to the relief effort while leading an on-air [[Labor Day]] pledge drive on Atlanta's [[WVEE-FM|V-103 FM]] that raised over $263,000 for [[Mississippi]] rapper [[David Banner]]'s "Heal the Hood" Foundation.  He also partnered with David Banner and [[Atlanta]] newcomer [[Young Jeezy]] for a two-day food and clothing drive at Atlanta's Club Vision and co-headlined a massive benefit concert on [[September 17]], sharing the bill with heavyweights such as [[Nelly]], [[OutKast]]'s [[Big Boi]], and David Banner - with 100 percent of the proceeds going to "Heal the Hood". 

In addition to his Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, T.I. worked with troubled youths at Paulding Detention Center in Atlanta, provided scholarships for single parent families at Boys and Girls Clubs, and headlined Boost Mobile's RockCorps concert at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]], which featured such performers as [[Fat Joe]], [[Slim Thug]], and [[Kanye West]], and was held exclusively for community service volunteers. In June 2005, The [[Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]] Foundation, named for the deceased member of multi-platinum female group [[TLC (music)|TLC]], and Atlanta's [[WVEE-FM|V-103]] honored T.I. with the 2005 [[Lisa Lopes]] Award for groundbreaking achievements in music and community service which was court ordered. With this steady list of growing accomplishments T.I. is being recognized as the "[[Jay-Z]] of the South." according to Pharrell Williams of multi-platinum production team The Neptunes.<ref name"">{{cite web

T.I. has joined forces again with the [[Make-A-Wish]] foundation to grant an [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] teen's wish. He joined labelmate/protege' [[Young Dro]] on stage for a taping at The Showtime At The Apollo to meet 15 year old Sara Labare on [[October 15]] at the [[Apollo Theatre]]. Labare, who suffers from an [[autoimmune disorder]], received a [[digital camera]],an autographed poster, CDs, and sat in the front row during T.I.'s performance. T.I. has granted a total of 3 wishes.

T.I. kept a fan smiling when he showed up at 11-year-old Ajmal Acklin's, who suffers from acute lymblastic leukemia with Christmas gifts. [[WHTA-FM|Hot-107.9]] announcer Griff asked the 11 year old does he like T.I. and Acklin responded "Yes" and his favorite song was "[[What You Know]]". Griff told him that T.I. was here and the 11-year-old's eyes lit up. T.I. walked in and said: ''"How you doing, I just wanted to come see how you're doing ... I heard the church bought you a [[PlayStation 3]], so I got you some games".'' One by one, each visitor offered their prayers and well wishes, ending with A-Team intern Ree Williams doing a stirring a capella version of the gospel tune "Even Me". Before she hit the last note Ajmal's mom ducked into the kitchen, tears in her eyes.

T.I.'s King Foundation is also scheduled to donate 10,000 bikes to the [[Boys & Girls Club]] in [[New Orleans]]. 

T.I.'s night club, Club Crucial, where he and V-103 announcer Greg Street will give away 200 bicycles to neighborhood children in the Boys & Girls Club.<ref name"">{{cite web

In early 2004, T.I. was behind bars in Cobb County, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], for violating probation. The probation stems from a November 1997 [[arrest]] and subsequent [[conviction]] for distribution of [[cocaine]], [[manufacturing]] and [[Distribution (business)|distributing]] a [[controlled substance]], and giving authorities a [[false name]], according to a sheriff's department spokesperson. 

He served a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] of unknown length and was released early on [[probation]]. It is not clear what he did to [[violate]] the terms of his release, but it is the second time he's been accused of doing so. A county [[judge]] could revoke the terms of his probation and reinstate his original sentence.

More trouble awaits T.I. in neighboring Fulton County. Two arrest warrants were issued there in March <U+2014> one for [[possession]] of a [[firearm]] and one for possession of [[ecstasy]]. Now that he's in custody, T.I. will likely be extradited to face those charges after his case is handled in Cobb County, according to a Fulton County sheriff's department spokesperson.<ref name"">{{cite web

T.I. was sentenced to three years in [[prison]] for violating the terms of his [[probation]]. After serving a minimum of one year, T.I. can apply for a work-release program, according to the county clerk's office in [[Cobb County]], Georgia. An arrest warrant for T.I. was issued on [[December 29]], ordering a revocation of his probation. He turned himself in to county officials on [[March 30]] and had been in custody ever since. His lawyers appeared in Cobb County Superior Court Wednesday and signed a consent order with [[prosecutors]] that essentially stipulated T.I. should be [[sentenced]] immediately, thus avoiding the need for a formal [[hearing]].

T.I. was on probation stemming from a [[1998]] [[conviction]] for violating a state controlled substances act and for giving false information. After being released on [[probation]], he earned a litany of probation violations in several counties around Georgia for offenses ranging from possession of a [[firearm]] to possession of [[marijuana]].<ref name"">{{cite web

In 2006, after appearing in an Atlanta court on (May 10) and having charges that he threatened a man outside a strip club last year dropped for lack of evidence, T.I. was arrested on an outstanding probation violation warrant from Florida. The warrant claims that T.I. did not complete the required number of community service hours he was sentenced for a 2003 assault of a female sheriff deputy at University Mall in Tampa. T.I. was detained by several mall Security Guards at the time of the incident, among them, Jason Phillips(founder of Certified Protective Services), Larry Warner (founder of Tactical Response Services), and Arturo Ortiz, now a security manager in Florida. According to WBS-TV Atlanta, the rapper<U+2019>s attorney has said that the problem was nothing more than a <U+201C>technical matter<U+201D> between [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Florida]]. The confusion arose because T.I. was also sentenced to community service in Georgia for driving with a suspended license, for which he did complete 75 hours of community service in his home state. The rapper was released on bail shortly after being arrested, and was expected to surrender to Florida state authorities next week to resolve the matter.<ref name"">{{cite web

=== Death of T.I.'s friend and assistant ===
In the early hours of [[May 3]], [[2006]], T.I. and his entourage were involved in a gunfight after leaving a concert after-party at the Club Ritz, a nightclub in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]<ref name"">{{cite web

|date=

According to the [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], the feud began at the city's Club Ritz during an after-party for the Atlanta rapper and his protege [[Young Dro]] -- who performed earlier that evening at the club [[Bogart's]] -- and moved outside, where shots were fired into two vans transporting T.I.'s crew just after three o'clock. 

"[The money] was supposed to be for the ladies", one witness said. "But it was hitting guys in the face, and they were like, 'We had money before, so why are you throwing money at us?'"

When the situation grew tense, T.I. reportedly told his group to head out. A witness outside told the Enquirer that one shot -- believed to be unrelated to the ensuing gun battle -- was fired in the parking lot and at least four people followed the vans in a large vehicle. The person that died was T.I.'s personal assistant and best friend Philant Johnson.
