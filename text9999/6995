'''Celine Marie Therese Figard''' (23 May 1976&nbsp;<U+2013> 19 December 1995) was a 19-year-old accountancy student from [[Ferri<U+00E8>res-l<U+00E8>s-Scey]] in eastern France, who went [[missing person|missing]] during a visit to the United Kingdom on 19 December 1995, after accepting a lift from a lorry driver at a motorway services in Berkshire. Following an appeal for information on her whereabouts and police enquiries, her body was discovered ten days later on 29 December 1995 at a [[Rest area|lay-by]] in [[Hawford]], [[Worcestershire]]. A [[Autopsy|post-mortem examination]] determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death.

The case received extensive news coverage in the UK around the Christmas and New Year period, amid fears that it could be linked to a series of killings around the [[English Midlands]] which police called the work of a "Midlands Ripper". The murder investigation included the UK's first national [[DNA]] screening programme in the hunt for a murder suspect, covering over 5,000 people.

Stuart Morgan, a 37-year-old lorry driver from [[Poole]] in [[Dorset]] was arrested on 19 February 1996 after a colleague recognised his image from a [[photofit]]. Morgan was later charged with her murder. Detectives concluded that after raping, strangling and bludgeoning her, he carried her body in his vehicle for ten days over the Christmas period before dumping it. Morgan was given a [[life sentence]] after his conviction in October, with a recommendation to serve at least twenty years. An appeal in February 1998 was rejected by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], and in 2009 the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] turned down his application for a review of the length of his sentence.

Figard was buried in the French village of [[Scey-sur-Sa<U+00F4>ne-et-Saint-Albin|Scey-sur-Sa<U+00F4>ne]] at a service attended by family, friends and politicians in January 1996. In the UK she is remembered in a memorial garden established at a church in the Worcestershire village of [[Ombersley]], close to where her body was discovered.

==Background and disappearance==

Celine Figard was the second of four children born to dairy farmers Bernard and Martine Figard of [[Ferri<U+00E8>res-l<U+00E8>s-Scey]], near [[Besancon]], in a rural community in eastern France. She was a gifted student, with a flair for music, language and mathematics. At the time of her death she was studying accountancy at the Lyc<U+00E9>e le Grand Ch<U+00EA>nois in [[Montb<U+00E9>liard]]. She developed a fondness for the UK following a 1990 visit and traveled there repeatedly.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17/><ref name=WorcesterNews-2000-12-29/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/archive/2001/07/04/Worcestershire+Archive/7754218.English_learning_curve_for_Christelle/ |title=English learning curve for Christelle |newspaper=Worcester News) |publisher=Newsquest Media Group |date=4 July 2001 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref>

She spent the summer of 1995 working at a hotel in [[Fordingbridge]], Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the opportunity to improve her English. She returned to the UK in December to spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc.<ref name=WorcesterNews-2000-12-29/> After leaving on 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the [[English Channel|channel]] the following day.<ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/><ref name=Openshaw/> She arrived in [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], Kent.

==Discovery of body and autopsy==

On the morning of Friday 29 December, the naked body of a young woman was found dumped at a lay-by on the [[A449 road|A449]] near the Worcestershire village of [[Hawford]] by a motorist who had stopped to change a windscreen wiper.<ref name=Independent-1995-12-31/> Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at [[Yate]], [[Somerset]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Matthew |last=Brace |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/fears-grow-for-celine-after-body-is-found-1527720.html |title=Fears grow for Celine after body is found |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=30 December 1995 |accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

The body was positively identified as Celine Figard the following day. The [[post mortem]] determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned with a heavy implement, but did not establish which was fatal. The autopsy revealed "no obvious signs" of sexual assault.<ref name=Independent-1995-12-31/> However, it determined that sexual intercourse had taken place shortly before her death. Detectives believed it had occurred against her will.<ref name=Independent-1996-01-13>{{cite news|first= Chris|last= Mowbray|first2= Jason|last2= Bennetto |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/dna-test-for-1200-lorry-drivers-1323711.html |title=DNA test for 1,200 lorry drivers |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=13 January 1996 |accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

Police said that the body had been there for about twenty-four hours and were working on the theory that she had been held captive before being killed. Detective Chief Superintendent Roger Hoddinott of [[Hampshire Police]] said at the time of discovery Figard had been dead for at least four to five days, but did not announce a time of death.<ref name=Independent-1995-12-31>{{cite news|first=Will|last= Bennett |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/killer-hid-celine-for-days-1527893.html |title=Killer hid Celine 'for days' |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=31 December 1995 |accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

==Investigation==

The investigation was led by Detective Chief Superintendent John McCammont of [[West Mercia Police]],<ref name=Independent-1996-01-05/> and involved more than 100 detectives from three police forces.<ref name=WorcesterNews-2000-12-29/><ref name=Independent-1995-12-27>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/missing-girls-father-helps-in-murder-hunt-1527423.html|title= Missing girl's father helps in murder hunt|first= Matthew|last= Brace|newspaper= The Independent|publisher= Independent Print Ltd|date= 27 December 1995|accessdate= 26 August 2012}}</ref> Officers examined similar unsolved murders amid concerns that they could all be the work of the same individual.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-01-01>{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111436649.html|title= Celine might have been serial killer's tenth victim|publisher= Associated Newspapers|newspaper= Daily Mail|format=subscription required|date= 1 January 1996|accessdate= 26 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Ian MacKinnon |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/police-swap-evidence-in-hunt-for-celines-killer-po-1322015.html |title=Police swap evidence in hunt for Celine's killer |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=2 January 1996 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> Of particular interest were the recent murders of Tracey Turner and Samo Paull, both of whom were found strangled near motorways.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-01-01/> McCammont ruled out a link at a press conference on 4 January: "I would stress that at this stage there is no firm evidence whatsoever to link Celine's murder with any other investigations."<ref name=Independent-1996-01-05/> He appealed for information concerning a bottle of Pascal Chretien champagne, a gift to Figard before coming to England: "This particular type of champagne is not exported to anywhere in the world outside France and is not sold in this country.

==Stuart Morgan==

Stuart William Morgan (born 1958) was an English lorry driver and former heating engineer from Poole. The son of John and Julianne Morgan, one of five siblings, he was raised in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]], where his father was employed as a council foreman and his mother&nbsp;<U+2013> a refugee from the former [[East Germany]]&nbsp;<U+2013> worked as a school cleaner. Morgan left school with three [[Certificate of Secondary Education|CSE]]s, and in 1974 served a custodial sentence in [[borstal]] following a conviction for burglary. After attending [[Croydon Polytechnic]] to train as a plumber and heating engineer, he established a plumbing business in the Tunbridge Wells area. He moved to Dorset following the failure of that business in 1983 and worked as a heating engineer for [[Bournemouth Borough Council]]. He became a lorry driver in 1991.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17/><ref name=Openshaw>{{cite web|url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218200720/http:/www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/144_14961.htm|title= High Court setting of minimum terms for mandatory life sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2003: Neutral Citation Number: [2009] EWHC 1629|publisher= HM Government of the United Kingdom|work= Her Majesty's Courts Service|date= 27 July 2009|accessdate= 29 August 2012|first= The Hon. Mr Justice|last= Openshaw}}</ref>

Morgan met his first wife in Kent in the early 1980s. They married in 1982, but he left her when she became pregnant with twins. He met the woman who would become his second wife after moving to Dorset. She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son. They did not marry until 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan had a reputation as a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following Morgan's conviction, brother Ray Morgan said, "He has had so many affairs over the years I have lost count." He also had a violent temper. One friend, Dave Moemken, described him as being "on a short fuse".<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17/>

He was driving from [[Leeds]] to [[Southampton Docks]] when he picked up Celine Figard on 19 December 1995.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17/> Detectives concluded that after raping and killing her, Morgan left her body in the bottom bunk of his cab for up to ten days while he continued to drive the lorry, driving and sleeping in it for at least some of that time. Apparently Morgan left the body in the vehicle after parking it opposite his house to spend Christmas with his family.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17/><ref name=Independent-1996-10-17/> Police believe he dumped the body on 29 December.<ref name=Independent-1996-10-17>{{cite news|first=Clare |last=Garner |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/life-for-lorry-driver-who-ended-celines-journey-of-optimism-1358724.html |title=Life for lorry driver who ended Celine's journey of optimism |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=17 October 1996 |accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

He was arrested after another trucker recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her. After he was picked out at an [[Police lineup|identity parade]], he claimed he and Figard had engaged in consensual sex.<ref name=DailyRecord-1996-10-17/>

==Trial==

The trial began at [[Worcester Crown Court]] on 2 October 1996,<ref name=Independent-1996-10-03>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/driver-hid-celines-body-in-his-lorry-1355356.html|title= Driver `hid Celine's body in his lorry'|publisher= Independent Print ltd|newspaper= The Independent|date= 3 October 1996|accessdate= 24 August 2012}}</ref> before Mr Justice Latham and a jury.<ref name=Independent-1996-10-17/> Morgan's trial counsel was Nigel Jones [[Queen's Counsel|QC]],<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-11/> and the case was prosecuted by David Farrer QC.<ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/> Morgan denied the charge.<ref name=Independent-1996-10-17/>

[[File:Crown Court on Foregate street - geograph.org.uk - 1164418.jpg|thumb|right|Morgan's trial was held at Worcester Crown Court in October 1996.]]

The prosecution account was that Morgan raped and killed Celine Figard on the afternoon or evening of 19 December 1995, then kept her body in his cab for ten days.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/> Farrer told the court that she had been strangled and battered around the head with a heavy object, and injuries to her face were "consistent with kicking and stamping". There was also evidence to suggest her hands had been taped together, and that sexual intercourse had taken place, with the prosecution of the opinion she had been "intimidated" into having sex.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/>

Evidence was presented by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard lay dead in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw with the intention of dismembering the body, but changed his mind,<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/> instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of her remains.<ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/> After removing a fuse from his lorry's [[tachograph]] to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire.<ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/> Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip.<ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/> DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/> Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house.<ref name=Mirror-1996-10-04>{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Celine+photos+at+trucker's+home.-a061272545|title= Celine photos at trucker's home|first= Bill|last= Daniels|newspaper= The Mirror|publisher= Mirror Group Newspapers|date= 4 October 1996|accessdate= 23 August 2012}}</ref> Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/> Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/>

Morgan admitted giving Figard a lift on the afternoon of 19 December 1995.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-11>{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111321364.html|title= Murder-charge lorry driver gives evidence|newspaper= Daily Mail|publisher= Associated Newspapers Ltd|format=subscription required|date= 11 October 1996|accessdate= 23 August 2012}}</ref> He claimed that the pair had consensual sex after chatting and flirting, developing a rapport and halting at a lay-by where he made her a cup of tea and asked her for what he described as a Christmas kiss.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-11/> He said afterwards he drove her to [[Southampton]], where they exchanged contact details before he left her,<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-11/> and that she was "smiling and happy".<ref name=Independent-1996-10-11>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/celine-case-man-tells-of-kiss-1357750.html|title= Celine case man tells of kiss|publisher= Independent Print Ltd|newspaper= The Independent|date= 11 October 1996|accessdate= 24 August 2012}}</ref> He did not come forward after police appealed for details of the driver who had given her a lift because he did not want his wife to learn of his infidelity.<ref name=Independent-1996-10-11/> He claimed her photographs and other belongings were in his possession because she had left them in his truck,<ref name=Mirror-1996-10-04/> and the mattress had become stained with blood because a man had lain on it after gashing his leg while the vehicle was on loan to another driver in 1994.<ref name=WorcesterNews-2000-12-29/>

On 16 October a jury took three and a half hours to convict Morgan of Celine Figard's Murder, and he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with a recommendation that the [[Home Secretary]] should decide his parole eligibility.<ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17>{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111320617.html|title= As lorry driver is sent down for life, police reveal there may be a stringof other victims |first= Luke|last= Harding|newspaper= Daily Mail|publisher= Associated Newspapers Ltd|format=subscription required|date= 17 October 1996|accessdate= 23 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=DailyRecord-1996-10-17/> Passing sentence, Mr Justice Latham said, "What you did to Celine has caused revulsion in the minds of all right-thinking people.

==Appeals==

Morgan appealed his conviction on the grounds that it was unfair due to the level of publicity the case had received. His application was rejected by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were insufficient grounds to justify an appeal.<ref name=BirminghamPost-1998-02-06>{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Celine+killer's+appeal+bid+is+turned+down.-a060790110|title= Celine killer's appeal bid is turned down|publisher= Miror Group Newspapers|newspaper= The Birmingham Post|date= 6 February 1998|accessdate= 25 August 2012}}</ref>

In January 2009 Morgan appealed again under paragraph 3 of Schedule 22 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] to the [[High Court of England and Wales]] requesting a review of the minimum term recommendation. This too was rejected, in July of that year, with the presiding judge, [[Peter Openshaw|Mr Justice Openshaw]] recommending, "The sentence is&nbsp;<U+2013> and remains&nbsp;<U+2013> a sentence of imprisonment for life. The defendant may not even be considered for release until he has served at least 20 years (less the time served before sentence). That is not to say that he will then be released; indeed he will be detained unless and until the Parole Board is satisfied that he no longer presents a risk to the public. Even if the Parole Board decides then or at some time in the future to authorise his release, he will be upon licence which will extend for the rest of his life."<ref name=Openshaw/>

Celine Figard's body was flown home to France on 17 January 1996, where her funeral was held on 20 January.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/celine-figards-body-flown-home-1324493.html|title= Celine Figard's body flown home|publisher= Independent Print Ltd|newspaper= The Independent|date= 18 January 1996|accessdate= 25 August 2012}}</ref> She was buried in [[Scey-sur-Sa<U+00F4>ne-et-Saint-Albin|Scey-sur-Sa<U+00F4>ne]].

A memorial garden dedicated to Celine Figard was planted at St Andrew's Church in the village of [[Ombersley]], Worcestershire, close to where her body was found, and opened at a ceremony in June 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/a-colourful-memorial-to-tragic-celine-1256230.html|title= A colourful memorial to tragic Celine|publisher= Independent Print Ltd|newspaper= The Independent|date= 16 June 1997|accessdate= 26 August 2012}}</ref> The garden also remembers other victims of violent crime, including [[Murder of Joanna Parrish|Joanna Parrish]] and Caroline Dickinson, two English students who were murdered while in France. On 29 December 2000, the fifth anniversary of the date Figard's body was recovered,  the local newspaper, the ''[[Worcester News]]'' reported that an annual service of remembrance was held for her at the church during the autumn, attended by her parents. Flowers were also regularly placed at the lay-by at Hawford where she was found, and the location named ''Le Jardin de Celine'' (Celine's Garden) in her memory.<ref name=WorcesterNews-2000-12-29/>
