The '''Junaluska salamander''' (''Eurycea junaluska'') is a species of [[lungless salamander]] native to the Southeastern United States.<ref name=frost>{{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/Amphibia/Caudata/Plethodontidae/Hemidactyliinae/Eurycea/Eurycea-junaluska |title=''Eurycea junaluska'' Sever, Dundee, and Sullivan, 1976 |author=Frost, Darrel R. |year=2014 |work=Amphibian Species of the World: an Online Reference. Version 6.0 |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref> It was first described by [[David M. Sever]], Harold M. Dundee, and Charles D. Sullivan who found the species in the range from the [[Cheoah River]], Santeetlah Creek, and Tululah Creek in [[Graham County, North Carolina|Graham County]] of North Carolina. Adults of this species can be found near large, rocky streams and on rainy nights on roads in the areas specified. The salamander is characterized by brownish-yellow coloration with a series of small dots along the body and a robust build compared to the other salamanders in ''[[Eurycea]]''.<ref name=Seveer1976/> The Junaluska salamander<U+2019>s breeding habits tend to be in large streams where the eggs are laid and attached to the bottom of rocks in the streams where they are found. According to the overall conservation listing for [[IUCN]], this species is listed as Vulnerable.<ref name=iucn/> Conservation acts are important in both [[North Carolina]] and [[Eastern Tennessee]], since the population of this species in each state is so small.

==Diagnosis==
''Eurycea junaluska'' has a brownish dorsum with small dots or wavy lines along the body.<ref name=Seveer1976/> An easy way to distinguish ''E. junaluska'' from ''[[Northern two-lined salamander|E. bislineata]]'' is ''E. junaluska'' has a more robust body, longer forelimbs, and a shorter tail. Also, Sever and his colleagues studied the teeth series and discovered ''E. junaluska'' possesses a longer prevomerine teeth series. In addition to these traits, a wavy, broken, black stripe up to 0.80&nbsp;mm wide extends from the nostril through the eye and through the sides of the body and tail.<ref name=Seveer1976/> The front limbs contain four toes and the back limbs contain five toes. Nasolabial grooves are present and the number of coastal grooves usually ranges from 13 to 15.<ref name=Niemiller/>

No phylogenetic trees are available for this species to date.<ref name=iucn/> The specific name ''junaluska'' was chosen to honor a [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians|Cherokee]] chief who was prominent in North Carolina<U+2019>s history, [[Junaluska]].<ref name=Seveer1976/> The area Chief Junaluska was given contains a good amount of the range of where the species exists in North Carolina, which is the reason for the naming of the salamander.

==Fossil record==
There is no fossil record found in literature to date.

==Geographic distribution==
Junaluska salamanders have only been found in the Blue Ridge Mountain area in the Cheoah River, Santeetlah Creek, and Tululah Creek in Graham County of North Carolina. They are also found in a limited number of creeks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Sevier County, Tennessee.<ref name=Ryan1998/><ref name=Ryan1997/> These salamanders are very rarely encountered in either area. One looking for this species is more likely to find ''E. junaluska'' in larger rocky streams in colder weather.<ref name=Willson/> Another popular way of spotting this species is late-night driving along roads on rainy nights. They can be seen moving between the terrestrial habitat they inhabit and the areas where they breed.<ref name=iucn/>

==Ecology==
Larvae are not numerous in larger streams, possibly because of the abundance of trout; predation by trout and other species of fish can affect the populations of ''E. junaluska''. Competition with other salamanders can also be a factor.<ref name=Seveer1983/> The junaluska salamander is thought to feed on smaller invertebrates found in the stream and forest areas they inhabit.<ref name=Willson/> Currently, interactions with other species are not well studied for this species.

==Life events==
The larval life history of ''E. junaluska'' is still not very well known. Studies have found the breeding season is spread from fall to early spring. The larval period reportedly lasts around two to three years, and metamorphosis occurs during the summer months. Eggs are laid in the streams and are attached under media such as large rocks. The depth of the eggs laid range from 6<U+2013>20&nbsp;cm. The adult salamanders stay around where the eggs are laid to protect the egg clutch. Clutch sizes range from 30 to 50 eggs.<ref name=Bruce/> The larvae are completely aquatic until they metamorphose into adults. The larvae can easily be distinguished as other ''Eurycea'' species, so it is important to distinguish them correctly.<ref name=Willson/> A successful method of discovering the larvae is by using leaf mats placed in the streams underneath or near rocks. This allowed surveyors to receive data on the egg clutches and adult salamanders.<ref name=Niemiller/>

==Conservation==
According to the IUCN, the species is declared vulnerable overall. The main conservation threat to the junaluska salamanders is human disturbances, such as logging, road construction, and development in urban areas. These disturbances affect the water quality and therefore affect the small populations of this rare species. The disruption of the breeding sites of the junaluska can interrupt the breeding time between fall and early spring that could be detrimental to the larval population.<ref name=iucn/> North Carolina and Tennessee have different listings for this species in respect to the conservation concerns for the species. In North Carolina, ''E. junaluska'' is said to be state threatened and a federal species of special concern.<ref name=Willson/> In Tennessee, the species is listed as imperiled and deemed in need of management. Conservation efforts are important for this species, since it is endemic to the United States, particularly in North Carolina and Tennessee. Also, it is important to conserve them since the population is said to be less than 1,000 individuals overall.<ref name=Niemiller/>
