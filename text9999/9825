== Biography ==
Charles Lothian Lloyd Owen<ref name="APRA Baby"/> was raised with two older sisters, both became visual artists.<ref name="McPharlin"/> His father was a captain in the navy, he gave Owen preliminary piano and guitar lessons.<ref name="McPharlin"/> His mother was a visual artist who tried to teach him to paint "Jesus how embarrassing, when all my friends were off trying to find cigarette butts to smoke and that... painting bloody pictures, but that was just what we did".<ref name="McPharlin"/>

At about eight or nine-years-old he formed a duo, Hot Dogs, with a neighbour to play for their parents, they only knew part of "[[Walk, Don't Run (song)|Walk, Don't Run]]",<ref name="McPharlin"/> a surf-jazz instrumental from 1954 by [[The Ventures]]. While he was still at primary school the family moved to Canberra and, at age 12 or 13, with an older friend he played at a youth club, Griffin Centre.<ref name="McPharlin"/> His biggest influences were [[Django Reinhardt]]'s "irreverence" and [[John Coltrane]]'s "reverence".<ref name="McPharlin"/>

Owen and his family then moved to Brisbane, where he was "a bit lonely" and "just sat around in my room playing guitar".<ref name="McPharlin"/> He formed a group with a saxophone player from music class at secondary school. Another group was OME (aka Original Music Ensemble), which was an improvisation group <U+2013> most of his early playing was in musical theatre and jazz.<ref name="McPharlin"/> He was also in Fabulous Dingo Family, co-founded by jazz composer David Pyle, and named after [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain|Azaria Chamberlain]].<ref name="McPharlin"/><ref name="Gaind"/>

In 1982 he was in Ninja Skill, a rock band, alongside Charlie Aber, John Caskey, Rick Caskey, Stephen Marskett, and Larry Ponting.<ref name="Holmgren"/> He left in 1984 and relocated to Sydney. In 1985 he played with Tango Bravo which had Tracy Bartelle, [[Tony Buck (musician)|Tony Buck]] on drums, Dave Dwyer, Steve Harris, Mauro Rubby and John Sharp.<ref name="Holmgren"/> He described the group as a "commercial pop thing" and initially he had no particular concerns about the group's direction, however "we'd gotten some deal to make a single and I just went, 'No, this shit's too much'" <U+2013> he suddenly left the band.<ref name="McPharlin"/>

Owen's earliest recorded work was for Meera Atkinson, a performance poet, on her album, ''This Is the Planet'' (1987), which was produced by [[Rob Younger]] ([[Died Pretty]], [[Lime Spiders]], [[The Stems]]).<ref name="McPharlin"/><ref name="Holmgren RY"/> Other session musicians included Brett Myers, [[Ron Peno]], and [[Louis Tillett]].<ref name="McPharlin"/> By February 1987 Owen was invited by Younger to join a reformed version of [[The New Christs]] on lead guitar.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane NC"/> With Younger on lead vocals, the line-up also had Jim Dickson (ex-Railroad Gin, Survivors, Passengers, Barracudas) on bass guitar and Louis Burdett (ex-Powerhouse, Ed Kuepper Band) on drums.<ref name="McFarlane NC"/> Owen co-wrote their fourth single, "Another Sin" (June 1989), with Dickson, Younger and Nick Fisher (ex-Wet Taxis)<ref name="APRA Another"/> <U+2013> Burdett's replacement.<ref name="McFarlane NC"/>

During 1987 Owen also provided guitar, with Burdett on drums, for Louis Tillett's (ex-Wet Taxis) debut solo album, ''Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell'' (November).<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane LT"/> Also on the album were Penny Ikinger on guitar and Diane Spence on saxophone (both from Wet Taxis); and Lenny Bastiaans on bass guitar (Great White Noise).<ref name="McFarlane LT"/><ref name="Holmgren LT"/> [[Stuart Coupe]] from ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' described the album as "a wonderful mixture of jazz, blues and rock'n'roll. Above all it's a spirited, passionate and diverse performance from a little known figure on the fringes of the rock'n'roll scene".<ref name="Coupe"/>

Owen also worked with Tillett in the group, Paris Green, which "covered material ranging from Mose Allison to John Coltrane, Ray Charles to Nina Simone, and on any given night there was as many as nine or ten musicians on stage".<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane LT"/> In June 1988 Owen was the record producer for [[The Plunderers (band)|The Plunderers]] five-track extended play, ''Trust Us''.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane P"/> As a member of New Christs, Owen supplied guitar, piano and organ, as well as co-writing, for their debut album, ''[[Distemper (album)|Distemper]]'' (August 1989).<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane NC"/> Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], described the album as "the definitive statement on the band's sound and style. It contained a wealth of powerful tracks".<ref name="McFarlane NC"/> However later that year the group disbanded.<ref name="McFarlane NC"/>

Owen completed session work on Penguins on Safari's ''Normal Soon'' and Tony Buck's ''The Shape of Things to Come'' (both 1989).<ref name="Holmgren"/> Also that year Owen joined ex-[[Cold Chisel]] pianist and keyboardist, [[Don Walker (musician)|Don Walker]], in a blues rock band, Catfish; which toured Australia.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane C"/> In 1990 Owen teamed with Tillet again, in Louis Tillett and His Cast of Aspersions, both produced the group's album, ''A Cast of Aspersions'' (April).<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane LT"/> McFarlane noted that it was "eclectic set of material driven by Tillett's booming baritone voice and smouldering organ, Owen's jagged guitar lines and the swinging brass arrangements".<ref name="McFarlane LT"/>

Owen resumed work with Catfish, he appeared on their second album, ''Ruby'' (October 1991), and toured in support of its release.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane C"/> Also in 1991 Owen joined [[Divinyls]] on tour promoting their [[Divinyls (album)|self-titled album]] issued January, Owen played rhythm guitar on ''Divinyls Live'' (1991) alongside founding mainstays, [[Chrissy Amphlett]] on lead vocals and [[Mark McEntee]] on lead guitar, together with Lee Borkman on keyboards, Jerome Smith on bass guitar, and [[Charlie Drayton]] on drums.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane D"/>

Late in 1992 [[Tex Perkins]] (of [[Beasts of Bourbon]], [[The Cruel Sea (band)|The Cruel Sea]]) contacted Owen and Waker to work together on four live-to-air tracks for a broadcast by national radio station, [[Triple J|JJJ]].<ref name="Gee"/> It was recorded as ''JJJ Live at the Wireless''.<ref name="Holmgren TDC"/> The trio made a "vague promise to do something more" in the future.<ref name="Gee"/> Six months later Perkins and Walker contacted Owen again, and they formed [[Tex, Don and Charlie]] to record their debut album, ''Sad But True'' (November 1993).<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane TP"/> For the album Owen supplied guitar, [[dobro]] and [[Lap steel guitar|lapsteel]].<ref name="Holmgren TDC"/> It reached the top&nbsp;40 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref name="AUS Charts"/>

''The Canberra Times''{{'}} Mike Gee noted that most of the material was written Perkins and/or Walker but "that isn't to overlook Owens' guitar work and his swampy instrumental 'Dead Dog Boogie'".<ref name="Gee"/> McFarlane described the album as a "rootsy collection of acoustic, country-blues songs full of steel guitar and sparse piano".<ref name="McFarlane TP"/> While fellow journalists, [[John O'Donnell (music journalist)|John O'Donnell]], [[Toby Creswell]] and [[Craig Mathieson]], listed it in their book, ''[[100 Best Australian Albums]]'' (October 2010).<ref name="ODonnell"/> They felt it contained "stories plucked from the night or passed along on back verandahs" and that "Dead Dog Boogie" was a "rambunctious, psychedelic country fair instrumental".<ref name="ODonnell"/>

Also in 1993 Owen, on dobro, lapsteel, banjo and organ, joined [[Maurice Frawley|Maurice Frawley and Working Class Ringos]], a rootsy country-blues band.<ref name="McFarlane MFWCR"/><ref name="Holmgren MF"/> With Frawley on lead vocals and lead guitar, were Des Hefner ([[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], [[Slaughtermen (band)|The Slaughtermen]]) on drums, and Shane Walsh on bass guitar.<ref name="McFarlane MFWCR"/><ref name="Holmgren MF"/> Walker described the group as "the best after-midnight band in the world".<ref name="Donovan"/> Owen called them "the bad boys of folk" who played "the most passionate, beautiful, rollicking, cheeky, heartfelt music you could ever hear".<ref name="Donovan"/>

In June 1993 Owen, [[Chris Wilson (blues musician)|Chris Wilson]], and three former members of [[The Triffids]]: [[David McComb]], [[Robert McComb]] and [[Graham Lee (Australian musician)|Graham Lee]] guested on [[Acuff's Rose]]'s debut studio album, ''Never Comin' Down''.<ref name="McFarlaneAcuff"/> In December that year Owen rejoined Divinyls for another tour of Australia.<ref name="Jansen"/> Working Class Ringos released an extended play, ''Whoop Whoop'' in 1994 and followed with their debut album ''Livin' Lazy'' in May 1995.<ref name="McFarlane MFWCR"/><ref name="Holmgren MF"/>

In 1994 Tex, Don and Charlie toured Australia and recorded a live album, ''Monday Morning Coming Down...'', and a related single, "What I Done to Her", which were issued in September.<ref name="Holmgren TDC"/><ref name="McFarlane TP"/> The track was co-written by Owen and Perkins,<ref name="APRA What"/> it was used on the soundtrack for the 2002 film, ''[[Australian Rules (film)|Australian Rules]]''.<ref name="Aussie"/> Owen was a session musician on albums: [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]]'s ''I Had a New York Girlfriend'', [[Spencer P. Jones]]' ''Rumour of Death'' (both 1994); The Cruel Sea's ''Three Legged Dog'' (April 1995); and Perkins' solo album, ''Far Be it from Me'' (1996).<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane TP"/>

Owen joined Perkins in a reformed line-up of the latter's group, Beasts of Bourbon, in September 1996 alongside Brian Henry Hooper on bass guitar, Jones on guitar and Tony Pola on drums.<ref name="McFarlane BoB"/><ref name="Holmgren BoB"/> This line-up recorded the group's fifth studio album, ''[[Gone (Beasts of Bourbon album)|Gone]]'' (January 1997), which reached the Top&nbsp;50 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name="McFarlane BoB"/><ref name="Holmgren BoB"/><ref name="AUS Charts BoB"/> The group disbanded again by the end of that year.<ref name="McFarlane BoB"/>

Back in 1994 Owen was also on guitar, bass guitar, piano, organ, drums and percussion in a duo with [[Joel Silbersher]] (ex-[[God (Australian band)|God]], [[Hoss (band)|Hoss]], Sabotage) on lead vocals, guitar, drums, harmonica and keyboards.<ref name="Holmgren T"/> The duo issued an album, ''Tendrils'', in the next year.<ref name="Holmgren T"/><ref name="Tendrils"/> They adopted the album's name for their duo and as Tendrils issued another album, ''Soaking Red'', in 1998 on [[Half A Cow Records|Half a Cow Recrods]].<ref name="Soaking Red"/>

The label promoted the album as "organic, darkly beautiful, sparse & intense".<ref name="Soaking Red"/> ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s reviewer found "tales of lives gone violently awry, set to elusive, near-impressionistic folkadelic orchestration. Organs proffer a narcotic balm, while guitars are picked with pointed economy, like the jibes of an estranged friend".<ref name="NME Soaking"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1999]] it was nominated for Best Alternative Release.<ref name="ARIA1999"/>

In 2000 Owen appeared on [[Steve Prestwich]]'s ''Since You've Been Gone'' and [[Conway Savage]]'s ''Nothing Broken''.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Also that year he produced and provided guitar for Perkins' second solo album, ''Dark Horses'' and joined Tex Perkins and the Dark Horses to promote its release.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="McFarlane TP"/> Also in the line-up were Silbersher, Murray Paterson, and Scritch.<ref name="Holmgren TP"/>

In March 2005 Tex, Don and Charlie reconvened to record their second album, ''All is Forgiven'' (August 2005). It was shortlisted for the [[Australian Music Prize]].<ref name="AMP Short"/> The trio promoted the release with a national tour into early 2006.<ref name="Cashmere"/> Meanwhile in December 2005 Owen's cherished [[Fender Telecaster Deluxe]] electric guitar and 1930s Dobro Kluson slide guitar were stolen by break-and-enter thieves.<ref name="Milovanovic"/> Owen told ''The Age''{{'}}s Selma Milovanovic that "My sound on those instruments is what I'm known for. Those sort of guitars are very, very rare, they are unique. It's like having your heart ripped out. It's horrible".<ref name="Milovanovic"/>

In 2010, Owen worked on Maurice Frawley's tribute album with [[Paul Kelly (musician)|Paul Kelly]].<ref name="AutoYG-1"/>

In May 2012 ''Australian Guitar'' magazine listed Owen in the Top&nbsp;40 of Australia's best guitarists.<ref name="AutoYG-2"/>
