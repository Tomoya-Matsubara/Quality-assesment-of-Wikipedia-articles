'''Therocephalia''' is an extinct [[suborder]] of [[carnivorous]] [[eutheriodont]] [[therapsids]]. Therocephalians lived from the middle and late [[Permian]] into the [[Triassic]] 265.0<U+2014>245.0 [[Annum|Ma]] existing for approximately {{Mya|265-245|million years}}.

The therocephalians ("beast-heads") are named after their large skulls, which, along with the structure of their teeth, suggest that they were carnivores. Like other non-mammalian [[synapsids]], therocephalians are described as [[mammal-like reptiles]], although in fact, Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the [[cynodont]]s, which gave rise to the [[mammal]]s. This relationship takes evidence in a variety of skeletal features. The [[phylogeny]] of therocephalians has been disputed, as the [[monophyly]] of the group and the relationships of its members are unclear.

The fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the [[Karoo]] of [[South Africa]], but have also been found in [[Russia]], [[China]], and [[Antarctica]]. Early therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a [[Gondwana]]n origin for the group, which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world. Although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great [[Permian<U+2013>Triassic extinction event]], a few representatives of the subgroup called [[Eutherocephalia]] survived into the [[Early Triassic]]. However, the last therocephalians became extinct by the early [[Middle Triassic]], possibly due to [[climate change]] and competition with [[cynodont]]s and various groups of [[reptile]]s.

Like the [[gorgonopsia|gorgonopsids]] and many [[cynodonts]], most therocephalians were presumably [[carnivores]]. The earlier therocephalians were in many respects as primitive as the gorgonopsids, but they did show certain advanced features. There is an enlargement of the temporal opening for broader jaw adductor muscle attachment and a reduction of the phalanges (finger and toe bones) to the [[mammal]]ian phalangeal formula. The presence of an incipient [[secondary palate]] in advanced therocephalians is another feature shared with mammals. The discovery of maxilloturbinal ridges in forms such as the primitive therocephalian ''[[Glanosuchus]]'', suggests that at least some therocephalians may have been warm-blooded.

The later therocephalians included the advanced [[Baurioidea]], which carried some [[theriodont]] characteristics to a high degree of specialization. For instance, small baurioids and the herbivorous ''Bauria'' did not have an ossified postorbital bar separating the [[orbit]] from the temporal opening<U+2014>a condition typical of primitive [[mammals]]. These and other advanced features led to the long-held opinion, now rejected, that the [[ictidosaurs]] and even some early mammals arose from a baurioid therocephalian stem. Mammalian characteristics such as this seem to have evolved in parallel among a number of different therapsid groups, even within Therocephalia.

Several more specialized lifestyles have been suggested for some therocephalians. Many small forms like [[ictidosuchid]]s have been interpreted as aquatic animals. Evidence for aquatic lifestyles includes [[sclerotic ring]]s that may have stabilized the eye under the pressure of water and strongly developed cranial joints, which may have supported the skull when consuming large fish and aquatic invertebrates. One therocephalian, ''[[Nothogomphodon]]'', had large saber-like [[canine teeth]] and may have fed on large animals, including other therocephalians. Other therocephalians such as [[bauriid]]s and [[nanictidopid]]s have wide teeth with many ridges similar to those of mammals, and may have been herbivores.<ref name=IMF11>{{cite journal |last=Ivakhnenko |first=M.F. |year=2011 |title=Permian and Triassic therocephals (Eutherapsida) of Eastern Europe |journal=Paleontological Journal |volume=45 |issue=9 |pages=981<U+2013>1144 |doi=10.1134/S0031030111090012}}</ref>

Many small therocephalians have small pits on their snouts that probably supported [[vibrissae]] or whiskers. In 1994, Russian paleontologist Leonid Tatarinov proposed that these pits were part of an [[electroreception]] system in aquatic therocephalians.<ref name=TLP94>{{cite journal |last=Tatarinov |first=L.P. |year=1994 |title=On the preservation of rudimentary rostral tubular complex of crossopterygians in theriodonts and on possible development of the electroreceptor systems in some members of this group |journal=Doklady Akademii Nauk |volume=338 |issue=2 |pages=278-281}}</ref> However, it is more likely these pits are enlarged versions of the ones thought to support whiskers, or holes for blood vessels in a fleshy lip.<ref name=IMF11/>

==Classification==
[[Image:Moschorhinus DB.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Moschorhinus]]'']]
The therocephalians evolved from an early line of pre-mammalian [[Eutheriodontia|eutheriodont]] [[therapsids]], and are the [[sister group]] to the [[cynodonts]] which include mammals and their ancestors. Therocephalians are at least as ancient as a third large branch of therapsids, the [[gorgonopsia|gorgonopsids]], which they resemble in many primitive features. For example, many early therocephalians possess long canine teeth similar to those of gorgonopsids. The therocephalians, however, outlasted the gorgonopsids, persisting into the early-Middle [[Triassic]] period.

While common ancestry with cynodonts (and, thus, mammals) accounts for many similarities among these groups, some scientists believe that other similarities may be better attributed to [[convergent evolution]], such as the loss of the [[postorbital bar]] in some forms, a mammalian [[phalangeal formula]], and some form of a secondary palate in most taxa (see below). Therocephalians and cynodonts both survived the [[Permian<U+2013>Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic mass extinction]], but while therocephalians soon went extinct, cynodonts underwent rapid diversification. Therocephalians experienced a decreased rate of [[cladogenesis]], meaning that few new groups appeared after the extinction. Most Triassic therocephalian lineages originated in the Late Permian, and lasted for only a short period of time in the Triassic.<ref name=HSS11>{{cite journal |last=Huttenlocker |first=A.K. |coauthors=Sidor, C.A.; and Smith, R.M.H. |year=2011 |title=A new specimen of ''Promoschorhynchus'' (Therapsida: Therocephalia: Akidnognathidae) from the Lower Triassic of South Africa and its implications for theriodont survivorship across the Permo-Triassic boundary |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=405<U+2013>421 |doi=10.1080/02724634.2011.546720}}</ref>

Some previously recognized therocephalian clades have turned out to be artificial. For example, the [[Scaloposauridae]] were classified based on fossils with mostly juvenile characteristics, but probably represent immature specimens from other known therocephalian families.

On the other hand, the aberrant therocephalian family Lycosuchidae, once identified by the presence of multiple [[Canine (tooth)|caniniform teeth]], was thought to represent an unnatural group based on a study of canine replacement in that group (van den Heever, 1980).  However, subsequent analysis has exposed additional [[Synapomorphy|synapomorphies]] supporting the [[monophyly]] of this group, and Lycosuchidae is currently considered the most basal clade within a monophyletic Therocephalia (van den Heever, 1994).

==In popular culture==
A pack of unspecified therocephalians appeared in the third episode of the [[BBC]] series, ''[[Walking with Monsters]]'' (which look similar to the [[Thrinaxodon]]s from ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]''). One of them attacks a ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' during the night, injecting the prey with a neurotoxin delivered by a poison gland in the cheek.  Although the existence of such a gland is controversial, the absence of postcanine teeth in association with a maxillary pit and grooved caniniform teeth indicate that a venom delivery apparatus may have existed in some therocephalian therapsids (e.g., ''[[Euchambersia]]''). Also, a pack of therocephalians appeared in Episode 4.4 of the  ITV science-fiction drama ''[[Primeval]]''.
