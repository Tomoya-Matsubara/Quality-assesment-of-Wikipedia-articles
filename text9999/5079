The '''Arapaho language''' or '''Arapaho proper''' (also spelled "Arapahoe"; in Arapaho: '''''Hin<U+00F3>no<U+2019>eit<U+00ED><U+00ED>t''''' {{sfn|Conathan|2006|loc='A'}}) is a one of the [[Plains Algonquian languages]], closely related to [[Gros Ventre language|Gros Ventre]] and other [[Arapahoan languages]]. It is spoken by under 300 people over age 50 in Wyoming, and in Oklahoma by "only a handful of people . . . all near eighty or older".{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p=1}} As such, it is in danger of becoming [[Language death|extinct]]. As of 1996, there were approximately 1,000 speakers among the Northern Arapaho.{{sfn|Greymorning|2001|p=287}} As of 2008, the authors of a newly published grammar estimated there were slightly over 250 fluent speakers, plus "quite a few near-fluent passive understanders".{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p=1}} In 2008, it was reported that a school had been opened to teach the language to children.{{sfn|''New York Times''|2008 October 18|p=}}

==Dialects==
Besawunena, only attested from a wordlist collected by Kroeber, differs only slightly from Arapaho, though a few of its sound changes resemble those seen in Gros Ventre. It had speakers among the Northern Arapaho as recently as the late 1920s. 

==Phonology==
Among the sound changes in the evolution from [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] to Arapaho are the loss of Proto-Algonquian '''*k''', followed by '''*p''' becoming either {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/t<U+0283>/}}; the two Proto-Algonquian [[semivowel]]s merging to either {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}; and '''*m''' often becoming {{IPA|/b/}}. Arapaho is unusual among Algonquian languages in retaining the contrast between the reconstructed phonemes '''*r''' and '''*<U+03B8>''' (generally as {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/<U+03B8>/}}, respectively).{{sfn|Hale|2001|pp=283-284}}{{sfn|Goddard|1974|p=}}{{sfn|Goddard|1990|p=103}} These and other changes serve to give Arapaho a phonological system very divergent from that of Proto-Algonquian and other Algonquian languages, and even from languages spoken in the adjacent [[Great Basin]]. Some examples comparing Arapaho words with their cognates in Proto-Algonquian can illustrate this:{{sfn|Goddard|1974|pp=1974:104, 106, 107, 108}}{{sfn|Goddard|2001|p=75}}{{sfn|Goddard|1990|p=103}}

===Vowels===
Almost uniquely among the world's languages, it has no [[Open vowel|low vowels]], such as {{IPA|/a/}}. 

At the level of pronunciation, Arapaho words cannot begin with a vowel, so where the underlying form of a word begins with a vowel, a prothetic {{IPA|/h/}} is added.{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p=14}}

Arapaho has a series of four short vowels {{IPA|/i e o u/}} (pronounced {{IPA|[<U+026A> <U+025B> <U+0254> <U+028A>]}}) and four long vowels {{IPA|/i<U+02D0> e<U+02D0> o<U+02D0> u<U+02D0>/}} (customarily written <U+27E8>ii ee oo uu<U+27E9> and pronounced {{IPA|[i<U+02D0> <U+025B><U+02D0> <U+0254><U+02D0> u<U+02D0>]}}). The difference in length is phonemically distinctive: compare '''h<U+00ED>si<U+2019>''', "tick" with '''h<U+00ED><U+00ED>si<U+2019>''', "day", and '''h<U+00F3>coo''', "steak" with '''h<U+00F3><U+00F3>coo''', "devil".{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p=14}} {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are mostly in complementary distribution, as, with very few exceptions, the former does not occur after [[velar consonant]]s, and the latter only occurs after them. {{IPA|/u/}} does have some exceptions as in the free variants '''kok<U+00ED>y''' ~ '''kok<U+00FA>y''', "gun"; '''kookiy<U+00F3>n''' ~ '''kookuy<U+00F3>n''', "for no reason"; and '''b<U+00ED><U+00ED><U+2019>ox<U+00ED>yoo''' ~ '''b<U+00ED><U+00ED><U+2019>ox<U+00FA>yoo''', "Found in the Grass" (a mythological character). There is only one minimal pair to illustrate the contrast in distribution: '''n<U+00FA>hu<U+2019>''', "this" versus '''n<U+00ED>hi<U+2019>-''', "X was done with Y", in which '''n<U+00ED>hi<U+2019>-''' only occurs in bound form.{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|pp=14-16}}

There are four diphthongs, {{IPA|/ei ou oe ie/}}, and several triphthongs, {{IPA|/eii oee ouu/}} as well as extended sequences of vowels such as {{IPA|/eee/}} with stress on either the first or the last vowel in the combination.{{sfn|Salzman ''et al.''|1998|p=}}

===Consonants===
The consonant inventory of Arapaho is given in the table below. When writing Arapaho, {{IPA|/j/}} is normally transcribed as <U+27E8>y<U+27E9>, {{IPA|/t<U+0283>/}} as <U+27E8>c<U+27E9>, {{IPA|/<U+0294>/}} as <U+27E8><U+2019><U+27E9>, and {{IPA|/<U+03B8>/}} as <U+27E8>3<U+27E9>.

===Allophony===
The phoneme /b/ (the [[voiced bilabial stop]]) has a voiceless allophone [p] that occurs before other consonants or at the end of a word. The plosives {{IPA|/t<U+0283>/}}, /k/, and /t/ are pronounced without [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] in most environments, but are aspirated before other consonants or at the end of a word, or when preceding a syllable-final sequence of short vowel + /h/. In this same environment /b/ is aspirated and devoiced. For example, the grammatical prefix '''cih-''' is pronounced {{IPA|[t<U+0283><U+02B0><U+026A>h]}}, the grammatical prefix '''tih-''' is pronounced {{IPA|[t<U+02B0><U+026A>h]}}, and the word '''h<U+00E9><U+00E9>tbih<U+2019><U+00ED>nk<U+00FA><U+00FA>tiinoo''', "I will turn out the lights" is '''het'''{{IPA|[b<U+0325><U+02B0>]}}'''ih<U+2019><U+00ED>nk<U+00FA><U+00FA>tiinoo'''.{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p=14}}

===Consonant clusters===
Consonant clusters in Arapaho can only be two consonants long. Consonant clusters do not occur word initially, and /hC/ is the only that occurs word finally. The only consonant cluster that is "base generated" (exists in the most underlying representation of words) is /hC/. At the "surface" (at the level of actual pronunciation), other clusters arise by phonological processes including vowel syncope, or by juxtaposition of morphemes. 

===Prosody===
Arapaho is a [[pitch-accent]] language. There are two phonemic tones: high (marked with an acute accent) or "normal" (unmarked). The contrast can be illustrated with the pair '''h<U+00F3>noos<U+00F3><U+00F3><U+2019>''', "it is fancy" and '''honoos<U+00F3><U+00F3><U+2019>''', "it is raining." Long vowels and vowel sequences can carry a contour tone from high to low, as in '''hou3<U+00ED>ne-''', "to hang" (where the first syllable has a normal tone) versus '''h<U+00F3>u3<U+00ED>ne-''', "to float" (where the first syllable has a high+normal, or falling, tone). Although tonal contrasts are distinctive in Arapaho, minimal pairs such as those listed above are rare.{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|pp=22-23}}
