'''Hurricane Elida''' was the sixth [[tropical cyclone]], fifth named storm, and second hurricane of the [[2008 Pacific hurricane season]]. Elida formed out of a weak tropical wave which formed off the western coast of Central America on July 8. The wave remained poorly organized over the next two days before developing a surface low. The low was declared Tropical Depression Six-E on July 11 while located to the south of Guatemala. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Elida the next morning. Elida intensified steadily over the next two days before being upgraded to a hurricane. Elida fluctuated in intensity over the next several days before reaching its peak intensity on July 16 with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h). Elida slowly weakened as it passed over cooling waters and was downgraded to a tropical storm on July 18 and further downgraded to a tropical depression on July 19. Elida degenerated into a remnant low shortly after, and completely dissipated on July 21 over open waters.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Elida 2008 track.png}}
Hurricane Elida developed out of a weak [[tropical wave]] which formed off the western coast of [[Central America]] on July 8. It is possible that the wave formed in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but there is little evidence to support this theory. The system remained poorly organized for two days before gaining enough [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] to be classified using the [[Dvorak technique]] on July 10, while located 290&nbsp;[[mile|mi]] (465&nbsp;[[kilometer|km]]) south of [[Guatemala]]. Later that day, a surface low developed but convection remained minimal. During the night and through the morning of July 11, convection increased sufficiently and a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert|tropical cyclone formation alert]] was issued. It was determined in the tropical cyclone report that by the end of the day, the storm had become Tropical Depression Six-E, six hours earlier than the operational data.<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|author=James L.

The depression was moving towards the west-northwest at 16&nbsp;mph (26&nbsp;km/h) due to a low to mid-level [[Ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] located to the north of the storm.<ref name="TCR"/>

The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Elida early on July 12 while located 200&nbsp;mi (370&nbsp;km) south of Puerto Angel, Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|author=Roberts/Beven|title=Tropical Storm Elida Public Advisory Number Two|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.public.002.shtml?}}</ref> Elida's foreward motion slowed somewhat to 14&nbsp;mph (22&nbsp;km/h) as it neared the southwestern edge of the mid-level ridge. The west-northwest movement was expected to continue for the duration of the storm. Deep convection developed around the center of circulation and a strong banding feature formed along the western side of the storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Roberts/Beven|title=Tropical Storm Elida Discussion Number Two|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> Slow strengthening took place throughout the morning as the center remained underneath the deep convection. Outflow to the north of the storm was slightly restricted, indicating that there was some easterly [[Wind shear|wind shear]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Brown|title=Tropical Storm Elida Discussion Number Three|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.003.shtml?}}</ref> During the afternoon, a well defined banding feature appeared in the northeastern semi-circle of the storm. However, outflow to the north remained highly constricted. Elida began to move slightly faster, still being influenced by the mid-level ridge. The foreword motion was forecast to slow down in the two to three day range as it moved away from the ridge.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brown|title=Tropical Storm Elida Discussion Number Four|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.004.shtml?}}</ref> Overnight, wind shear began to weaken and outflow to the north of Elida was established.<ref>{{cite web|author=Roberts/Knabb|title=Tropical Storm Elida Discussion Number Five|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.005.shtml?}}</ref> By the morning of July 13, banding features and outflow were present all around the storm, but wind shear managed to keep the center of Elida slightly displaced from the deepest convection. A weakening mid to upper-level trough located just west of [[Baja California]] was forecasted to move towards the west over the next two to three days. The movement of the trough would allow the ridge to build westward. This would cause Elida to make a westerly turn.<ref>{{cite web|author=Roberts/Beven|title=Tropical Storm Elida Discussion Number Six|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.006.shtml?}}</ref> Later in the morning, the wind shear lessened and the overall symmetry of Elida improved.<ref>{{cite web|author=Blake|title=Tropical Storm Elida Discussion Number Seven|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.007.shtml?}}</ref> In the early afternoon, a burst of convection near the center of Elida had formed and weakened and the structure remained unchanged and the storm still did not have signs of a developing [[Eye (cyclone)|eyewall]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Blake|title=Tropical Storm Elida Discussion Number Eight|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.008.shtml?}}</ref> During the night, Elida still failed to develop an eyewall. However, by this point the shear had lessened significantly from its level at the storm's formation and strengthening was anticipated.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brown|title=Tropical Storm Elida Discussion Number Nine|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.009.shtml?}}</ref>

In the early afternoon hours, Tropical Storm Elida was upgraded to Hurricane Elida due to a satellite indication of an eye forming at the lower levels in the storm. However, this was not apparent from visible satellite image, as it was covered by the central dense overcast.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhome|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Ten|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.010.shtml?}}</ref> In the late morning hours, the eye continued to develop and Elida intensified slightly.<ref>{{cite web|author=Landsea/Franklin|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Eleven|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.011.shtml?}}</ref> A ragged eye appeared in the afternoon as the structure of the storm improved. At this point, forecasters thought the Elida had peaked in intensity or was near its peak. Elida's motion slowed to 10&nbsp;mph (16&nbsp;km/h) and shifted from a west-northwest direction to a westerly direction as the ridge located to the north of the storm began influencing the trajectory.<ref>{{cite web|author=Landsea/Franklin|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Twelve|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.012.shtml?}}</ref>The eye disappeared shortly after but the intensity was kept at 85&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|author=Brown|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Thirteen|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.013.shtml?}}</ref> By the morning of July 15, easterly wind shear began to increase, causing Elida to become less symmetrical.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhome|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Fourteen|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.014.shtml?}}</ref> The wind shear persisted through the morning and slowly weakened the storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bann|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Fifteen|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.015.shtml?}}</ref> By the afternoon, Elida was barely holding onto hurricane status as both wind shear and cooling weakened the system.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bann|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Sixteen|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.016.shtml?}}</ref> Overnight, Elida became better organized as convection wrapped around an eye which was discovered by a microwave satellite despite shear remaining at a modest intensity.<ref>{{cite web|author=Franklin|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Seventeen|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.017.shtml?}}</ref>

[[Image:Elida Asmr-e 2201 July 17.jpg|right|thumb|Microwave satellite image of Elida on July 17 showing the embedded eye within the weakening hurricane.]] 
On the morning of July 16, the eye appeared on [[infrared]] satellite and [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]] outflow improved all around the system. However, Elida was nearing the 26<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (78<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) [[isotherm]], which is the lowest water temperature required for a tropical cyclone. The mid-level ridge to the north of Elida was now forecast to move with the storm, ensuring westward motion and slightly increasing the foreword speed to 12&nbsp;mph (19&nbsp;km/h). Elida maintained this general motion for the duration of its existence with some minor fluctuation in speed and an eventual southerly tilt.<ref>{{cite web|author=Franklin|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Eighteen|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.018.shtml?}}</ref><ref name="TCR"/> The eye quickly disappeared from infrared satellite later in the morning, but deep convection persisted on the eastern side of the center of circulation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Avila|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Nineteen|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.019.shtml?}}</ref> In the afternoon, an eye appeared embedded in the deep convection and Elida intensified into a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|category two]] hurricane with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/) while located 630&nbsp;mi (1015&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Mexico]]. <ref name="TCR"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Avila|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Twenty|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.020.shtml?}}</ref> By the nighttime hours, the cloud tops in the northern semi-circle of Elida warmed but the intensity remained unchanged.<ref>{{cite web|author=Franklin|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Twenty-One|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.021.shtml?}}</ref> On the morning of July 17, cold waters began to take their toll on Elida and the eye became cloud filled and less distinct.<ref>{{cite web|author=Avila|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Twenty-Two|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.022.shtml?}}</ref> In the late morning, Elida weakened to a category one hurricane as determined in the tropical cyclone report.<ref name="TCR"/> Operationally, it was thought to have maintained winds of 100&nbsp;mph (155&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|author=Knabb|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Twenty-Three|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.023.shtml?}}</ref> Despite continuing deep convection near the center of Elida and even an embedded eye, the center was lagging behind, making the storm slightly tilted.<ref>{{cite web|author=Knabb|title=Hurricane Elida Discussion Number Twenty-Four|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep06/ep062008.discus.024.shtml?}}</ref> Elida produced a large amount of deep convection overnight, but the winds continued to lessen.

==Impact and naming==
Although Elida was fairly close to the coast of Mexico as a tropical storm, it remained far enough away for there to be no impact on the coastline. No other land areas were affected by Elida and there were no ship reports of tropical storm-force winds. Due to the lack of damage, the name Elida was not retired and is on the list of names for the [[List of Pacific hurricane seasons|2014 Pacific hurricane season]].<ref name="TCR"/>

When Tropical Depression Six-E was upgraded to Tropical Storm Elida, it was the fifth time that the name was used for a tropical cyclone in the [[Pacific Ocean|Eastern Pacific]]. Hurricane Elida was used previously in 1984, 1990, 1996, and [[Hurricane Elida (2002)|2002]].<ref>{{cite web|author=NHC|title=Eastern Pacific Best Tracks, 1949-2007|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-26|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2007_epa.txt}}</ref>
