'''SMS ''Preussen''''' ("His Majesty's Ship [[Prussia]]") was the fourth of five [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships of the [[Braunschweig class battleship|''Braunschweig'' class]] in the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (the German Imperial Navy) laid down in 1902 and commissioned 1905.  Her sister ships were {{SMS|Braunschweig||2}}, {{SMS|Elsass||2}}, {{SMS|Hessen||2}}, and {{SMS|Lothringen||2}}.

''Preussen'' served in the II Battle Squadron of the German [[High Seas Fleet]] for the majority of her career. She participated in a fleet advance in December 1914 in support of the [[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]] during which the German fleet encountered and briefly clashed with a detachment of the British [[Grand Fleet]]. She had been temporarily assigned to guard ship duties in the Baltic in May 1916, and so missed the [[Battle of Jutland]]. Due to her age, she did not rejoin the fleet, and instead continued to serve as a guard ship until 1917, when she became a fleet tender. 

After the war, ''Preussen'' was retained by the re-formed [[Reichsmarine]] and converted into a depot ship for F-type minesweepers. She was stricken in April 1929 and sold to ship breakers in 1931. A {{convert|63|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} section of her hull was retained as a target; it was bombed and sunk in 1945 by Allied bombers at the end of [[World War II]], and subsequently scrapped in 1954.

==Construction==
{{main|Braunschweig class battleship}}
''Preussen'' was laid down in 1902, at the [[AG Vulcan]] in [[Stettin]] under construction number 256. The fourth unit of her class, she was ordered under the contract name "K" as a new unit for the fleet. The ship cost 23,990,000 [[German gold mark|marks]].<ref name=G18>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 18</ref> ''Preussen'' was launched on 30 October 1903 and commissioned into the fleet on 12 July 1905.<ref name=G20>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 20</ref>

The ship was {{convert|127.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} forward. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical boilers, all of which burned coal. ''Preussen''{{'}}s powerplant was rated at {{convert|16000|ihp|lk=on}}, which generated a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|km/h}}.<ref name=G18/>

''Preussen''{{'}}s armament consisted of a main battery of four 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) SK L/40 guns in twin [[gun turret]]s,<ref group=Note>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (''Schnellfeuerkanone'') denotes that the gun quick firing, while the L/40 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/40 gun is 40 [[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 40 as times long as it is in diameter. See: Grie<U+00DF>mer, p. 177</ref> one fore and one aft of the central [[superstructure]].<ref name=H68>Hore, p. 68</ref> Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 17&nbsp;cm (6.7&nbsp;inch) SK L/40 guns and eighteen 8.8&nbsp;cm (3.45&nbsp;in) SK L/35 quick-firing guns. The armament suite was rounded out with six {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes, all mounted submerged in the hull.<ref name=G20/>

==Service history==
After commissioning in 1905, ''Preussen'' was assigned to the II Battle Squadron of the German fleet. There she joined her sisters ''Braunschweig'', ''Elsass'', and ''Hessen''.<ref>''Germany: The Navy'', p. 197</ref> By the end of 1911, three of the four new {{sclass|Helgoland|battleship|4}} [[dreadnought]]s had entered active duty with the I Squadron; the only pre-dreadnought remaining in I Squadron was ''Preussen''{{'}}s sister ''Elsass''. ''Preussen'' and seven other ''Braunschweig'' and ''Deutschland'' class ships made up the II Squadron.<ref>Hurd, p. 27</ref> ''Preussen'' was present during the fleet cruise to Norway in July 1914, which was cut short by the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and subsequent rise in international tensions. On 25 July the ship's crew was made aware of [[Austria-Hungary]]'s [[July Ultimatum|ultimatum to Serbia]]; ''Preussen'' left Norway to rendezvous with the rest of the fleet the following day.<ref>Scheer, p. 8</ref>

===World War I===
After the outbreak of war in August 1914, the High Seas Fleet conducted a series of operations designed to lure out a portion of the numerically superior British [[Grand Fleet]] and destroy it.<ref>Tarrant, p. 27</ref> By achieving a rough equality of forces, the German navy could then force a decisive battle in the southern portion of the North Sea.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 136</ref> The first such operation in which the [[High Seas Fleet]] participated was the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]] on 15&ndash;16 December 1914.<ref>Tarrant, p. 31</ref> The main fleet acted as distant support for Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]]'s battlecruiser squadron while it raided the coastal towns. On the evening of 15 December, the fleet came to within {{convert|10|nmi|abbr=on}} of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival [[destroyer]] screens in the darkness convinced the German fleet commander, Admiral [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]], that the entire [[Grand Fleet]] was deployed before him. Under orders from [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back towards Germany.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 31&ndash;33</ref>

''Preussen'', though assigned to the II Squadron, missed the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May&ndash;1 June 1916. She had been temporarily transferred to the Baltic to serve as a guard ship. Her sister, ''Lothringen'', also missed the battle, as she had been deemed to be in too poor a condition to participate in the fleet advance.<ref>Scheer, p. 140</ref> Jutland proved to Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], the fleet commander, that the pre-dreadnought battleships were too vulnerable to take part in a major fleet action, and so detached the II Squadron from the High Seas Fleet.<ref>Scheer, p. 187</ref> As a result, ''Preussen'' remained in service as a guard ship in the Baltic. From 1917 to the end of the war, she served as a fleet tender based in Wilhelmshaven.<ref name=G20/> ''Preussen'' briefly held [[Edouard Izac]], a US Navy sailor captured after his ship was sunk by the [[SM U-90|''U-90'']], in June 1918; Izac would go on to escape from a German prisoner of war camp and win the [[Medal of Honor]].<ref>Mikaelian & Wallace, pp. 57&ndash;58</ref>

===Post-war career===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13211, Wilhelmshaven, Abgewrackte Kriegsschiffe.jpg|thumb|right|''Preu<U+00DF>en'' after having been converted into a depot ship.]]
The [[Treaty of Versailles]], which ended the war, specified that Germany was permitted to retain six battleships of the "''Deutschland'' or ''Lothringen'' types."<ref>See: [[s:Treaty_of_Versailles_1919|Treaty of Versailles]] Section II: Naval Clauses, Article 181</ref> ''Preussen'' was among those ships chosen to remain on active service with the newly reformed [[Reichsmarine]].<ref name=G20/> The ship was converted into a parent ship for F-type [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|Kriegsmarinewerft]] in Wilhelmshaven in 1919; the ship was disarmed and platforms for holding the minesweepers were installed.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 18&ndash;20</ref>

''Preussen'' served in this capacity with the newly reformed [[Reichsmarine]] until 1929. She was stricken from the naval register on 5 April 1929; the Reichsmarine sold her to ship breakers on 25 February 1931 for 216,800&nbsp;[[Reichsmark]]s. ''Preussen'' was subsequently broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven, though a {{convert|63|m|ft|abbr=on}} length of her hull was retained as a testing target for underwater weapons, including torpedoes and mines. The section of hull was nicknamed "SMS ''Vierkant'' ("SMS Rectangle"). Allied bombers attacked and sank the section of ''Preussen''{{'}}s hull in April 1945. It was eventually raised and scrapped in late 1954.<ref name=G20/>
