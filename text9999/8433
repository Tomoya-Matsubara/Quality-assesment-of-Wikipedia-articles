'''John Garfield''' ([[March 4]], [[1913]] <U+2013> [[May 21]], [[1952]]) was an American actor. Garfield was especially adept at playing brooding, rebellious, working-class character roles, and was twice nominated for an Academy Award (see below).

Born '''Jacob Julius Garfinkle''' in [[New York City]] to [[Jewish]] immigrants David and Hannah Garfinkle, he was raised in [[Sea Gate, Brooklyn]] until sent to a school for problem children in the [[Bronx]] after the death of his mother when he was seven years old. It was there, under the guidance of the school's principal, noted educator [[Angelo Patri]], that he was introduced to [[boxing]] and acting<ref>Jim Beaver.

Unfortunately, he contracted an illness at early in life which severely damaged his heart, limiting his ability to engage in strenuous athletic activities.  He won a scholarship to an acting school hosted by [[Maria Ouspenskaya]], and made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1932. He became a member of the [[Group Theater]]. The Group's play ''[[Golden Boy]]'' was written for him by [[Clifford Odets]], but he was passed over for the lead role. William Holden later became a star for his version of the title role in the movie<ref>Nott, Robert.  ''He Ran All the Way:  The Life of John Garfield''.  New York, Limelight Editions, 2003  ISBN 0-87910-985-8</ref>. Garfield decided to leave Broadway and try his success in [[Hollywood]]. In 1938 he received wide critical acclaim and a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role in ''[[Four Daughters]]''. 

At the onset of [[World War II]], Garfield immediately attempted to enlist in the armed forces, but was turned down due to heart damage<ref>Nott, Robert.  ''He Ran All the Way:  The Life of John Garfield''.  New York, Limelight Editions, 2003  ISBN 0-87910-985-8</ref>.  Frustrated, he turned his energies to supporting the war effort.  He and actress [[Bette Davis]] were the driving force behind the opening of the [[Hollywood Canteen]], a club offering food and entertainment for American [[United States military|servicemen]]. He later traveled to Yugoslavia to help entertain for the war effort.

Garfield graduated to leading roles in films such as ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946) with [[Lana Turner]], ''Humoresque'' (1946) with [[Joan Crawford]], and the Oscar-winning Best Picture ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947). In 1948 he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his starring role in ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'' (1947). A strong-willed and often verbally combative individual, Garfield did not hesitate to venture out on his own when the opportunity arose. In 1946, when his contract with [[Warner Bros.]] expired, Garfield decided against renewal of his studio contract and opted to start his own independent production company, one of the first [[Hollywood]] stars to take this step.

Long involved in liberal politics, Garfield was caught up in the [[Communism|Communist]] scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s, and supported the [[Committee for the First Amendment]], which opposed governmental investigation of political beliefs.  When called to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], which was empowered to investigate purported communist infiltration in [[United States|America]], Garfield refused to name communist party members or followers, testifying that, indeed, he knew none in the film industry. Though his wife had been a member of the Communist Party,[http://themave.com/Garfield/artc/nytimes.htm] no evidence was ever presented that Garfield had ever been a Communist. Indeed, Garfield rejected Communism, and just prior to his death, in hopes of redeeming himself in the eyes of the blacklisters, had written that he had been duped by Communist ideology, in an unpublished article entitled ''"I Was a Sucker for a Left Hook"''. However, his forced testimony before the committee had severely damaged his reputation.  He was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in ''[[Red Channels]]'', and barred from future employment as an actor by Hollywood [[movie studio]] bosses for the remainder of his career<ref>[[Jim Beaver]].

[[Image:Garfield 800.jpg|thumb|300px|John Garfield's grave in [[Westchester Hills Cemetery]]]] With film work scarce because of the blacklist, Garfield returned to Broadway and starred in a 1952 revival of ''[[Golden Boy]],'' finally being cast in the lead role denied him years before.

Long-term heart problems, allegedly aggravated by the stress of his blacklisting, led to his early death at the age of 39 on [[May 21]], [[1952]]. Garfield is interred at [[Westchester Hills Cemetery]] in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]], [[Westchester County]], [[New York]].

He and his wife Roberta Seidman, whom he married in February 1935, had three children: Katherine (1938-45), who died of an allergic reaction, [[David Garfield|David]] (1943-1994), and [[Julie Garfield|Julie]] (b. 1946), the latter two later becoming actors themselves<ref>Nott, Robert.

Garfield is acknowledged as the predecessor of such Method-style American film stars as [[Marlon Brando]], [[James Dean]], and [[Montgomery Clift]].
