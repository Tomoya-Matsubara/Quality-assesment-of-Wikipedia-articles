'''Saint Boniface''' ({{lang-la|Bonifacius}}) (c. 680 <U+2013> 5 June 754), the '''Apostle of the Germans''', born '''Winfrid''', '''Wynfrith''', or '''Wynfryth''' in the kingdom of [[Wessex]], probably at [[Crediton]] (now in [[Devon]], [[England]]), was a [[missionary]] who propagated [[Christianity]] in the [[Frankish Empire]] during the 8th century. He is the patron saint of [[Germany]] and the first [[archbishop of Mainz]].  He was killed in [[Frisia]] in 755, along with 52 others. His remains were returned to [[Fulda]], where they rest in a sarcophagus which became a site of pilgrimage. Facts about Boniface's life and death as well as his work became widely known, since there is a wealth of material available<U+2014>a number of ''[[Hagiography|vitae]]'', especially the near-contemporary ''Vita Bonifatii auctore Willibaldi'', and legal documents, possibly some sermons, and above all his correspondence.

[[Norman F. Cantor]] notes the three roles Boniface played that made him "one of the truly outstanding creators of the first Europe, as the apostle of Germany, the reformer of the Frankish church, and the chief fomentor of the alliance between the [[papacy]] and the [[Carolingians|Carolingian family]]."<ref>Cantor 167-68.</ref> Through his efforts to reorganize and regulate the church of the Franks, he helped shape Western Christianity, and many of the dioceses he proposed remain until today. After his martyrdom, he was quickly hailed as a saint in Fulda and other areas in Germany and in England. His [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] is still notably strong today. Boniface is celebrated (and criticized)<ref>Van der Goot 1-2, 17.</ref> as a missionary; he is regarded as a unifier of Europe, and he is seen (mainly by Catholics) as a German national figure.

==Early life and first mission to Frisia==
[[File:Hess Boniface leaves England 1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Prayer card, early 20th century, depicting Boniface leaving England]]
The earliest Bonifacian ''vita'' does not mention his place of birth but says that at an early age he attended a monastery ruled by abbot Wulfhard in ''escancastre'',<ref>Levison 6.</ref> or ''Examchester'',<ref>Talbot 28.</ref> which seems to denote [[Exeter]], and may have been one of many ''monasteriola'' built by local landowners and churchmen; nothing else is known of it outside the Bonifacian ''vitae''.<ref>Schieffer 76-77; 103-105.</ref> Later tradition places his birth at [[Crediton]], but the earliest mention of Crediton in connection to Boniface is from the early fourteenth century,<ref>Orme.</ref> in [[John Grandisson]]'s ''Legenda Sanctorum: The Proper Lessons for Saints' Days according to the use of Exeter''.<ref>Levison xxix.</ref>

According to the ''vitae'', Winfrid was of a respected and prosperous family. Against his father's wishes he devoted himself at an early age to the monastic life. He received further theological training in the [[Benedictine]] monastery and [[Minster (church)|minster]] of [[Nursling|Nhutscelle (Nursling)]],<ref>Levison 9.</ref> not far from [[Winchester]], which under the direction of abbot Winbert had grown into an industrious centre of learning in the tradition of [[Aldhelm]].<ref>Schieffer 105-106.</ref> Winfrid taught in the abbey school and at the age of 30 became a priest; in this time, he wrote a Latin grammar, the ''Ars Grammatica'', besides a treatise on verse and some [[Aldhelm]]-inspired riddles.<ref>Gneuss 38.</ref> While little is known about Nursling outside of Boniface's ''vitae'', it seems clear that the library there was significant. In order to supply Boniface with the materials he needed, it would have contained works by [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]], [[Priscian]], [[Isidore]], and many others.<ref>Gneuss 37-40.</ref> Around 716, when his abbot Wynberth of Nursling died, he was invited (or expected) to assume his position <U+2014> it is possible that they were related, and the practice of hereditary right in early Anglo-Saxon would affirm this.<ref>Yorke.</ref> Winfrid, however, declined the position and in 716 set out on a missionary expedition to [[Frisia]].

==Early missionary work in Frisia and Germania==
Boniface first left for the continent in 716. He traveled to [[Utrecht]], where [[Willibrord]], the "Apostle of the Frisians," had been working since the 690s. He spent a year with Willibrord, preaching in the countryside, but their efforts were frustrated by the war then being carried on between [[Charles Martel]] and [[Radbod]], king of the Frisians. Willibrord fled to the abbey he had founded in [[Echternach]] (in modern-day [[Luxemburg]]) while Boniface returned to Nursling.

Boniface returned to the continent the next year, and this time went straight to [[Rome]], where [[Pope Gregory II]] renamed him "Boniface", for the (legendary) fourth-century martyr [[Boniface of Tarsus]], and appointed him missionary bishop for [[Germania]] --he became a bishop without a diocese for an area that lacked any church organization. He would never return to England, though he remained in correspondence with his countrymen and kinfolk throughout his life.

According to the ''vitae'', in 723, Boniface felled the [[Donar Oak]], Latinized by Willibald as "Jupiter's oak," near the present-day town of [[Fritzlar]] in northern [[Hesse]].  Boniface called upon the god to strike him down if he cut the holy tree. According to his early biographer Willibald, Boniface started to chop the oak down, when suddenly a great wind, as if by miracle, blew the ancient oak over. When the god did not strike him down, the people were amazed and converted to Christianity. He built a chapel dedicated to [[Saint Peter]] from its wood at the site where today stands the cathedral of [[Fritzlar]]. Later he established the first [[diocese]] in Germany north of the old Roman [[Limes]] at the Frankish fortified settlement of [[B<U+00FC>raburg]], on a prominent hill facing the town across the [[Eder]] River.

==Boniface and the Carolingians==
[[Image:St Boniface - Baptising-Martyrdom - Sacramentary of Fulda - 11Century.jpg|right|thumb|Fulda Sacramentary, Saint Boniface baptizing (top) and being martyred (bottom)]]
The support of the [[Franks|Frankish]] mayors of the palace ([[maior domo]]s), and later the early [[Pippinid]] and [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] rulers, was essential for Boniface's work. Boniface had been under the protection of [[Charles Martel]] from 723 on. The Christian Frankish leaders desired to defeat their rival power, the non-Christian Saxons, and to incorporate the Saxon lands into their own growing empire. Boniface's destruction of [[Germanic paganism|indigenous Germanic paganism]] and its ritual sites may have benefited the Franks in their campaign against the Saxons.

In 732, Boniface traveled again to Rome to report, and [[Pope Gregory II]] conferred upon him the [[pallium]] as archbishop with jurisdiction over Germany. Boniface again set out for what is now Germany, baptized thousands, and dealt with the problems of many other Christians who had fallen out of contact with the regular hierarchy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. During his third visit to Rome in 737<U+2013>38, he was made [[papal legate]] for Germany.

After Boniface's third trip to Rome, Charles Martel erected four dioceses in Bavaria ([[Bishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]], [[Bishopric of Regensburg|Regensburg]], [[Bishopric of Freising|Freising]], and [[Bishopric of Passau|Passau]]) and gave them Boniface as [[archbishop]] and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] over all Germany east of the Rhine. In 745, he was granted Mainz as metropolitan see. In 742, one of his disciples, [[Saint Sturm|Sturm]] (also known as Sturmi, or Sturmius), founded the [[Fulda monastery|abbey of Fulda]] not far from Boniface's earlier missionary outpost at Fritzlar. Although Sturm was the founding abbot of Fulda, Boniface was very involved in the foundation. The initial grant for the abbey was signed by [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]], the son of [[Charles Martel]], and a supporter of Boniface's reform efforts in the Frankish church. The saint himself explained to his old friend, Daniel of Winchester, that without the protection of Charles Martel he could <U+201C>neither administer his church, defend his clergy, nor prevent idolatry.<U+201D>

According to German historian Gunther Wolf, the high point of Boniface's career was the [[Concilium Germanicum]], organized by Carloman in an unknown location in April 743. While Boniface was not able to safeguard the church from property seizures by the local nobility, he did achieve one goal, the adoption of stricter guidelines for the Frankish clergy,<ref>Wolf 2-5.</ref> which often hailed directly from the nobility. After Carloman's resignation in 747 he maintained a sometimes turbulent relationship with the king of the [[Franks]], [[Pippin III|Pepin]]; the claim that he would have crowned Pepin at [[Soissons]] in 751 is now generally discredited.<ref>Wolf 5.</ref>

Boniface balanced this support and attempted to maintain some independence, however, by attaining the support of the [[papacy]] and of the [[Agilolfing]] rulers of [[Bavaria]]. In Frankish, Hessian, and Thuringian territory, he established the dioceses of [[W<U+00FC>rzburg]], and [[Erfurt]]. By appointing his own followers as bishops, he was able to retain some independence from the Carolingians, who most likely were content to give him leeway as long as Christianity was imposed on the Saxons and other Germanic tribes.

==Last mission to Frisia==
[[File:Codex Ragyntrudis.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Ragyndrudis Codex]]
[[File:Sint-Bonifatiuscrypte Fulda.jpg|thumb|Saint Boniface crypt, Fulda]]

According to the "vitae", Boniface had never relinquished his hope of converting the [[Frisians]], and in 754 he set out with a retinue for Frisia. He baptized a great number and summoned a general meeting for confirmation at a place not far from [[Dokkum]], between [[Franeker]] and [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Instead of his converts, however, a group of armed inhabitants appeared who slew the aged archbishop. The ''vitae'' mention that Boniface persuaded his (armed) comrades to lay down their arms: "Cease fighting. Lay down your arms, for we are told in Scripture not to render evil for good but to overcome evil by good."<ref>Talbot 56.</ref>

Having killed Boniface and his company, the Frisian bandits ransacked their possessions and got drunk on the wine remaining among the provisions, and then started killing each other, arguing over the division of the booty. The surviving "freebooters" found that the company's luggage did not contain the riches they had hoped for: "they broke open the chests containing the books and found, to their dismay, that they held manuscripts instead of gold vessels, pages of sacred texts instead of silver plates."<ref>Talbot 57.</ref> They attempted to destroy these books, the earliest ''vita'' already says, and this account underlies the status of the [[Ragyndrudis Codex]], now held as a Bonifacian relic in Fulda, and supposedly one of three books found on the field by the Christians who inspected it afterward. Of those three books, the Ragyndrudis Codex shows incisions that could have been made by sword or axe; its story appears confirmed in the Utrecht hagiography, the ''Vita altera'', which reports that an eye-witness saw that the saint at the moment of death held up a [[gospel]] as spiritual protection.<ref>Schieffer 272-73.</ref> The story was later repeated by Otloh's ''vita''; at that time, the Ragyndrudis Codex seems to have been firmly connected to the martyrdom.

His remains were eventually buried in the abbey of Fulda after resting for some time in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and they are entombed within a shrine beneath the high altar of [[Fulda Cathedral]], previously the abbey church.

==Memorials==
Saint Boniface's [[feast day]] is celebrated on 5 June in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Lutheran Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

A famous statue of St Boniface stands on the grounds of [[Mainz Cathedral]], seat of the [[archbishop of Mainz]]. A more modern rendition stands facing the cathedral of Fritzlar.

The UK National Shrine is located at the Catholic [[Church (building)|church]] at [[Crediton]], [[Devon]], which has a [[bas-relief]] of the felling of Thor's Oak, by sculptor Kenneth Carter. The sculpture was unveiled by [[Princess Margaret]] in his native [[Crediton]], located in Newcombes Meadow Park. There is also a series of paintings there by Timothy Moore. There are quite a few churches dedicated to St. Boniface in the United Kingdom: [[Bunbury, Cheshire|Bunbury]], Cheshire; [[Chandler's Ford]] and [[Southampton]] Hampshire; Adler Street, London; [[Papa Westray]], Orkney; [[St Budeaux]], Plymouth (now demolished); [[Bonchurch]], Isle of Wight; [[Cullompton]], Devon.

Bishop [[George Errington]] founded [[St Boniface's Catholic College]], Plymouth in 1856. The school celebrates St Boniface on 5 June each year.

In 1818, Father [[Norbert Provencher]] founded a mission on the east bank of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] in what was then [[Rupert's Land]], building a log church and naming it after St. Boniface. The log church was consecrated as [[Saint Boniface Cathedral]] after Provencher was himself consecrated as a bishop and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Boniface|diocese]] was formed. The community that grew around the cathedral eventually became the city of [[St. Boniface, Manitoba|St. Boniface]], which merged into the city of [[Winnipeg]] in 1971.

St. Boniface also has a Roman Catholic church dedicated to him in the diocese of [[Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Lafayette_in_Indiana| Lafayette in Indiana]] in the United States of America. It was started by German immigrants in 1853 and the present church building was completed in 1865.  The parish was in the care of the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscan Fathers) of the Cincinnati Province between 1875 and 1991 and now is staffed by diocesan priests.  The strong influence of its German heritage is still felt in the parish through the many families who have attended St. Boniface for generations and its annual Germanfest.  More recently, the parish has been home to many of Lafayette's growing Mexican-American population. <ref>{{cite web|title=St. Boniface Parish, Lafayette, IN, USA|url=http://www.stboniface.org}}</ref> 

St. Boniface Church, [[Chicago]] was established by German immigrants in 1865, with the current building dating from 1903. The church, although of significant architectural interest, fell into disuse in 1990 and its future is in doubt. 

St. Boniface Catholic Church in [[Cold Spring, Minnesota|Cold Spring]], Minnesota reached its 130 year anniversary in 2008. There is another St. Boniface Roman Catholic church in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], California. This year it is celebrating its 150 year anniversary.

==Legends==
Some traditions credit St Boniface with the invention of the [[Christmas tree]]. The ''vitae'' mention nothing of the sort. The myth, however, is found on a [[BBC]]-Devon website, in an account which places Geismar in [[Bavaria]],<ref>"Devon Myths and Legends."</ref> and in a number of educational books, including ''St. Boniface and the Little Fir Tree'',<ref>Melmoth, Jenny and Val Hayward (1999).

==Sources and writings==
===''Vitae''===
The earliest "Life" of Boniface was written by a certain Willibald, an Anglo-Saxon priest who came to Mainz after Boniface's death,<ref>This is not the Willibald who was appointed by Boniface as [[Willibald|Bishop of Eichstatt]]: "The writer of the Life was a simple priest who had never come into direct contact with Boniface and what he says is based upon the facts that he was able to collect from those who had been Boniface's disciples." Talbot 24.</ref> around 765. Willibald's biography was widely dispersed; Levison lists some forty manuscripts.<ref>Levison xvii-xxvi.</ref> According to his lemma, a group of four manuscripts including Codex Monacensis 1086 are copies directly from the original.<ref>Levison xxxviii.</ref>

Listed second in Levison's edition is the entry from a late ninth-century Fulda document: Boniface's status as a martyr is attested by his inclusion in the ''Fulda Martyrology'' which also lists, for instance, the date (1 November) of his [[Translation (relic)|translation]] in 819, when the [[Fulda Cathedral]] had been rebuilt.<ref>Levison xlvii.</ref>

The next ''vita'', chronologically, is the ''Vita altera Bonifatii auctore Radbodo'', which originates in the [[Bishopric of Utrecht]], and was probably revised by [[Radboud of Utrecht]] (899-917). Mainly agreeing with Willibald, it adds an eye-witness who presumably saw the martyrdom at Dokkum. The ''Vita tertia Bonifatii'' likewise originates in Utrecht. It is dated between 917 (Radboud's death) and 1075, the year [[Adam of Bremen]] wrote his ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'', which used the ''Vita tertia''.<ref>Levison lvi-lviii.</ref><ref>Haarl<U+00E4>nder.</ref>

A later ''vita'', written by [[Otloh of St. Emmeram]] (1062<U+2013>1066), is based on Willibald's and a number of other ''vitae'' as well as the correspondence, and also includes information from local traditions.

===Correspondence===
Boniface engaged in regular correspondence with fellow churchmen all over Western Europe, including the three popes he worked with, and with some of his kinsmen back in England. Many of these letters contain questions about church reform and liturgical or doctrinal matters. In most cases, what remains is one half of the conversation, either the question or the answer. The correspondence as a whole gives evidence of Boniface's widespread connections; some of the letters also prove an intimate relationship especially with female correspondents.<ref>Noble xxxiv-xxxv.</ref>

There are 150 letters in what is generally called the Boniface correspondence, though not all them are by Boniface or addressed to him. They were assembled by order of archbishop [[Lullus]], Boniface's successor in Mainz, and were initially organized into two parts, a section containing the papal correspondence and another with his private letters. They were reorganized in the eighth century, in a roughly chronological ordering. Otloh of St. Emmeram, who worked on a new ''vita'' of Boniface in the eleventh century, is credited with compiling the complete correspondence as we have it.<ref>Noble xxxiv-xxxv.</ref>

The correspondence was edited and published already in the seventeenth century, by Nicolaus Serarius.<ref>''Epistolae s. Bonifacii martyris, primi moguntini archiepiscopi'', published in 1605 in Mainz and republished in 1625, and again in 1639, Paris.</ref> Stephan Alexander W<U+00FC>rdtwein's 1789 edition, ''Epistolae S. Bonifacii Archiepiscopi Magontini'', was the basis for a number of (partial) translations in the nineteenth century. The first version to be published by [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]] (MGH) was the edition by Ernst D<U+00FC>mmler (1892); the most authoritative version until today is Michael Tangl's 1912 ''Die Briefe des Heiligen Bonifatius, Nach der Ausgabe in den Monumenta Germaniae Historica'', published by MGH in 1916.<ref>Noble xxxiv-xxxv.</ref> This edition is the basis of [[Ephraim Emerton]]'s selection and translation in English, ''The Letters of Saint Boniface'', first published in New York in 1940; it was republished most recently with a new introduction by Thomas F.X. Noble in 2000.

===Sermons===
{{main|Sermones (Pseudo)-Bonifatii}}
Some fifteen preserved sermons are traditionally associated with Boniface, but that they were actually his is not generally accepted.

===Grammar and poetry===
Early in his career, before he left for the continent, Boniface wrote an ''Ars Grammatica'', a grammatical treatise presumably for his students in Nursling. [[Helmut Gneuss]] reports that one manuscript copy of the treatise originates from (the south of) England, mid-eighth century; it is now held in [[Marburg]], in the Hessisches Staatsarchiv.<ref>Gneuss 130, item 849.</ref> He also wrote a treatise on verse, the ''Caesurae uersuum'', and a collection of [[riddle]]s, the ''Enigmata'', influenced greatly by [[Aldhelm]] and containing many references to works of [[Vergil]] (the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the ''[[Georgics]]'', and the ''[[Eclogues]]'').<ref>Lapidge 38.</ref>

==Anniversary and other celebrations==
Boniface's death (and birth) have given rise to a number of noteworthy celebrations. The dates for some of these celebrations have undergone some changes: in 1805, 1855, and 1905 (and in England in 1955) anniversaries were calculated with Boniface's death dated in 755, the "Mainz tradition"; Michael Tangl's dating of the martyrdom in 754 was not accepted until after 1955. Celebrations in Germany centered on Fulda and Mainz, in the Netherlands on Dokkum and Utrecht, and in England on Crediton and Exeter.

===Celebrations in Germany: 1805, 1855, 1905===
[[File:1905 boniface coin.jpg|image|thumb|right|150px|Coin minted for the Boniface anniversary in Fulda, 1905.]]
The first German celebration on a fairly large scale was held in 1805 (the 1150th anniversary of his death), followed by a similar celebration in a number of towns in 1855; both of these were predominantly Catholic affairs, which emphasized the role of Boniface in German history as opposed to Protestant views on the role of [[Martin Luther]], and especially the 1855 celebrations were an expression of German Catholic nationalism. In 1905, when strife between Catholic and Protestant factions had eased (one Protestant church published a celebratory pamphlet, Gerhard Ficker's ''Bonifatius, der "Apostel der Deutschen"''), there were modest celebrations and a publication for the occasion on historical aspects of Boniface and his work, the 1905 ''Festgabe'' by Gregor Richter and Carl Scherer. In all, the content of these early celebrations showed evidence of the continuing question about the meaning of Boniface for Germany, though the importance of Boniface in cities associated with him was without question.<ref>Nichtwei<U+00DF> 283-88.</ref>

===1954 celebrations===
In 1954, celebrations were widespread, in England, Germany, and the Netherlands, and a number of these celebrations were international affairs. Especially in Germany, these celebrations had a distinctly political note to them and often stressed Boniface as a kind of founder of Europe, such as when [[Konrad Adenauer]], the (Catholic) German chancellor, addressed a crowd of 60,000 in Fulda, celebrating the feast day of the saint in a European context: "Das, was wir in Europa gemeinsam haben, [ist] gemeinsamen Ursprungs" ("What we have in common in Europe comes from the same source").<ref>Pralle 59.</ref>

===Papal visit, 1980===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pope and boniface 1980.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pope John Paul II]] praying at the grave of Boniface, 18 November 1980.]] -->
When [[Pope John Paul II]] [[List of pastoral visits of Pope John Paul II outside Italy|visited Germany]] in November 1980, he spent two days in Fulda (17 and 18 November). He celebrated mass in Fulda Cathedral with 30,000 gathered on the square in front of the building, and met with the [[German Bishops' Conference]] (held in Fulda since 1867). The pope next  celebrated mass outside the cathedral, in front of an estimated crowd of 100,000, and hailed the importance of Boniface for German Christianity: "Der heilige Bonifatius, Bischof und M<U+00E4>rtyrer, ''bedeutet'' den 'Anfang' des Evangeliums und der Kirche in Eurem Land" ("The holy Boniface, bishop and martyr, ''signifies'' the beginning of the gospel and the church in your country")."<ref>Grave 134.</ref> A photograph of the pope praying at Boniface's grave became the centerpiece of a prayer card distributed from the cathedral.

===2004 celebrations===
In 2004, anniversary celebrations were held throughout Northwesternand Utrecht, and Fulda and Mainz<U+2014>generating a great amount of academic and popular interest. The event occasioned a number of scholarly studies, esp. biographies (for instance, by Auke Jelsma in Dutch, Lutz von Padberg in German, and Klaas Bruinsma in Frisian), and a fictional completion of the Boniface correspondence (Lutterbach, ''Mit Axt und Evangelium'').<ref>Aaij.</ref> A German musical proved a great commercial success,<ref>Hartl.</ref> and in the Netherlands an opera was staged.<ref>Henk Alkema (music) and Peter te Nuyl (libretto). ''Bonifacius''. Leewarden, 2004.</ref>

==Scholarship on Boniface==
The literature on the saint and his work is extensive. At the time of the various anniversaries, edited collections were published containing essays by some of the best-known scholars of the time, such as the 1954 collection ''Sankt Bonifatius: Gedenkgabe zum Zw<U+00F6>lfhundertsten Todestag''<ref>Ed. Cuno Raabe et al., Fulda: Parzeller, 1954.</ref> and the 2004 collection ''Bonifatius--Vom Angels<U+00E4>schsischen Missionar zum Apostel der Deutschen''.<ref>Eds. Michael Imhof and Gregor Stasch, Petersberg: Michael Imhof, 2004.</ref> In the modern era, [[:de:Lutz E. von Padberg|Lutz von Padberg]] published a number of biographies and articles on the saint focusing on his missionary praxis and his relics. The most authoritative biography<ref>Lehmann 193: "In dem auch heute noch als Standardwerk anerkannten Buch ''Winfrid-Bonifatius und die christlichen Grundlegung Europas'' von Theodor Schieffer..."</ref> is still [[Theodor Schieffer]]'s ''Winfrid-Bonifatius und die Christliche Grundlegung Europas''.
