The coastline of the [[Russian Federation]] is the fourth longest coastline in the world after [[Indonesia]]. The Russian [[fishing industry]] has an [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of 7.6 million km<U+00B2> including access to twelve seas in three oceans, together with the landlocked [[Caspian Sea]] and more than two million rivers.<ref name="FAO profile"/> 

According to the [[FAO]], in 2005 the Russian [[fishing industry]] harvested 3,190,946 [[tonne]]s of fish from [[wild fisheries]] and another 114,752 tonnes from [[aquaculture]]. This made Russia the ninth leading producer of fish, with 2.3 percent of the world total.<ref name="FAO 2005">[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/ Fisheries and Aquaculture] 2005 statistics.</ref>

==Management==
[[Fisheries management]] is regulated by Russian federal laws. The federal law "On Fisheries and Protection of Aquatic Biological Resources" of December 2004 (referred to below as the ''Law on Fisheries'') divides fisheries into three main categories" industrial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries of [[indigenous]] groups. Industrial fisheries includes coastal fisheries. This definition has been challenged and is under review.<ref name="FAO profile"/> 

The ''Law on Fisheries'' requires setting [[total allowable catch]] (TAC) levels for fishery stocks, which it defines as the <U+201C>scientifically justified annual catch of aquatic biological resources of particular species in a fishing area<U+201D>. At the same time the ''Law on Fisheries'' states industrial fisheries are not necessarily based on TAC. The ''Law on Fisheries'' gives no further explanation, but calls for a special statute for TAC setting, which has to be issued by federal government. Pacific salmon is the main stock that will probably not have TAC, but will have regulated fishing effort.  

The ''Law on Fisheries'' also gives a definition of a fishing unit area and sets general principles for their use. The compiling of lists of fishing unit areas is delegated to the regional authorities. The ''Law on Fisheries'' has gaps and its application is criticized by parliamentarians and stakeholders. It may be expected that in the coming years at least two new federal laws, "On Coastal Fisheries" and "On Aquaculture", will be considered by Russian legislators.<ref name="FAO profile"/>   

Apart from TAC settings, all categories of fisheries are regulated by the so-called ''Fishing Rules'' (Pravila rybolovstva). These rules are set separately for the following areas: The Northern Basin (Barents, White Sea, Onega Lake, and other lakes and rivers of the catchment), the Western Basin (the Baltic and its catchment), the Arctic Ocean Basin (including the catchments of Siberian rivers), the Far East Basin, the Black Sea<U+2013>Azov Sea Basin and the Caspian Basin.<ref name="FAO profile"/> 

The ''Fishing Rules'' specify closed areas, seasonal closures, restrictions on specific gear, minimum mesh sizes, minimum allowable catch sizes, and allowable levels of [[bycatch]]. Fisheries management has been changing since the former USSR broke up, and more changes are expected.<ref name="FAO profile"/>   

The government has mismanaged the fisheries, with frequent restructuring of the institutions responsible for fishery management and control. Starting in 1992, the fishery authority has been reorganized at least five times. The head of the fishery authority was replaced seven times, and not one of these heads was a fishery professional. The issues involved in regulating fishing capacity were never really recognized. However, consistent fishery policies are starting to be developed now.<ref>Zilanov VK (2007) [http://fishnews.ru/interview/show/46 ''Fishery problems in the professional<U+2019>s eye.'']</ref><ref>Titova GD (2007) ''Bioeconomic problems of fisheries in national jurisdiction zones.'' St. Petersburg, VVM Ltd. Publishing, 367 p. (in Russian).</ref><ref name="FAO profile"/> 

The extreme bureaucracy involved for a fishing vessel to make a port call and land fish results in coastal processing being bypassed. Instead, the seafood is just directly exported, unprocessed. Similarly, there are many bureaucratic difficulties in developing aquaculture. Getting a licence to use water and the necessary sanitary certificates is very time consuming, although it does guarantee environmental and health safety.<ref name="FAO profile"/> 

====Artisanal====
[[File:Ivanov anton Ivanovich Fishing Vessels Off A Jetty.jpg|thumb|right|Fishing vessels off a jetty, believed to be [[Kostroma]] (Russia) Oil on canvas, 1839, by [[Anton Ivanov]]]]
There is no legally adopted term in Russia for [[Artisan fishing|artisanal fisheries]]. Artisanal or subsistence fishing usually refers to fishing mainly with traditional gear, with production delivered to the market but also used for subsistence. In Russia, the term covers also several kinds of fisheries classified as industrial, such as [[salmon]], [[char]]s, [[whitefish]], [[navaga]], [[flounder]]s and [[greenling]] fisheries in the Baltic, the Arctic and the Far Eastern Seas. Subsistence fishing by [[indigenous group]]s is also an issue. Indigenous fishers mainly work estuaries, lagoons and rivers (for [[anadromous]] fish). Legally, they are bound to use their catch for local consumption only. They are not allowed to sell their catch, but in reality, this is not always the case.<ref name="FAO profile"/>

In Russia, poverty contributes to poaching and other threats to fishery resources. Poverty can leave people depending on natural resources to feed themselves. There may be little perceived incentive to protect fish and other aquatic life and to use them in a sustainable way. Lack of awareness and lack of public involvement in managing local resources can result in poaching, [[overfishing]], and other kinds of illegal activities. Poaching by private individuals feeds the industrial [[IUU]] catch, and forms a vicious cycle.<ref name="FAO profile"/> 

The social role of traditional fisheries has often been extolled, but rarely analysed. In the [[traditional fishing village]]s scattered along the coast of the [[White Sea]], the annual cycle of fishing still governs the mode of life of the [[Pomor]].<ref>Tzetlin, A (2000) ''Traditional nature use on the White Sea.'' Ohrana dikoi prirody, 2: 13<U+2013>16 (in Russian).</ref> Fishing has played a similar role in the life of most Russian indigenous groups, and among the settlers in the north of Siberia and along the Pacific Coast, and on the coasts of big lakes. In the late 1960s, this lifestyle was disrupted by administrative decisions to abandon many coastal villages and resettle people in larger settlements. This disruption of traditional ways has been associated with increasing poverty and alcohol abuse. There is now a slow movement towards reviving cultural identity and traditions. To succeed, there must also be a revival of the sustainable fisheries that allowed such fishing communities to flourish.<ref name="FAO profile"/>

====Recreational====
Recreational fishing is well developed everywhere in Russia. It is difficult to distinguish from artisan fishing, particularly as the two are governed by the same ''Fishing Rules''. Most recreational and subsistence fishers are independent, but there is some growth in organized tourist fishing, particularly in the northwest ([[Murmansk Oblast]] and [[Karelia]]) and the Lower [[Volga]] Basin.<ref name="FAO profile"/> 

The total catch of the recreational and subsistence fishery in inland waters amounted in 1999 to 4,300 tonnes, mostly [[cyprinid]]s and [[perch]]es.<ref>Yatskevich, B.A., Pak, V.A., Rybalsky, N.G. (eds) (2000) ''Natural resources and environment of Russia.'' 
Moscow, Nia Priroda, Refia (in Russian).</ref> No estimates for later periods are available. In terms of investment and benefits, the most important recreational fishery is [[Atlantic salmon]] fishery on [[Kola Peninsula]] (Murmansk Oblast<U+2019>).<ref name="FAO profile"/> 

====Industrial====
Russia has three main industrial fisheries:<ref name="FAO profile"/> 
* marine fisheries (including [[anadromous]] and [[brackish water]] species, and [[estuarine]] fisheries)
* inland fisheries
* aquaculture

====EEZ====
[[File:Russland Relief.png|thumb|right|Relief map of Russia]]
Russia's marine fisheries are based on twelve seas from three oceans which surround Russia, the landlocked [[Caspian Sea]], and the [[high seas]] beyond Russia<U+2019>s [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ). 

The three oceans are:<ref name="FAO profile"/>  
* the [[Atlantic]]: with the [[Sea of Azov]], [[Black Sea]], [[Baltic]], [[Barents Sea]] and [[White Sea]] 
* the [[Arctic Ocean]]: with the [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]], [[East Siberian Sea]] and [[Chuckchi Sea]]
* the [[Pacific]]: with the [[Bering Sea]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and [[Sea of Japan]]).

Marine capture fisheries in Russia<U+2019>s [[territorial sea]]s, internal marine waters and the EEZ provided up to 75 percent of the total reported catch for 1996<U+2013>2005.

Due to the decreasing catch and a growing export to East Asian markets, Russian fisheries are currently unable to meet domestic demand for fish and seafood. The East Asian markets are more attractive to fishing enterprises than the domestic market. As a consequence, there are increasing imports for the affluent in big cities, and increasing recreational and subsistence fishing with its associated  activity on the [[IUU]] catch market.<ref name="FAO profile"/>

====Inland fisheries====
[[File:Omul Fish.jpg|thumb|right|[[Omul]] fish, endemic to [[Lake Baikal]]. Smoked and on sale at [[Listyanka]] market.]]
The biggest inland water is the landlocked [[Caspian Sea]]. The biggest lakes are [[Baikal Lake|Baikal]] (23,000 km<U+00B2>), [[Ladoga Lake|Ladoga]] (19,100 km<U+00B2>) and [[Onega Lake|Onega]] (9,700 km<U+00B2>). Russia has more than 2 million rivers, the largest of which are, in order, [[Northern Dvina River|Severnaya Dvina]], [[Pechora River|Pechora]], [[Dnieper River|Pechora]], [[Volga Volga|Pechora]], [[Ob River|Ob<U+2019>]], [[Don River|Don]], [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], [[Lena River|Lena]], [[Kolyma River|Kolyma]], [[Indigirka River|Indigirka]] and [[Amur River|Amur]].<ref name="FAO profile"/> The most important inland fishing area is the Ob<U+2019><U+2013>Irtysh River Basin (about 27 percent). Sixty species are caught in the inland fisheries of Russia.<ref>Reshetnikov, 2002</ref> In volume terms, [[whitefish]] (Coregonidae), [[cyprinid]]s, [[zander]]s and [[perch]] are most important. Set nets are the most common gear used in inland water commercial fisheries. [[Seine fishing|Seine]]s are also used on big rivers and lakes, and small [[trawl]]s on the big lakes. In 2005, the official catch in the inland waters was 72,000 tonnes.<ref name="ministry 2006">Ministry of Natural Resources, 2006</ref>

In the past, [[sturgeon]] has been an important catch in the basin of the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], and in Siberian Rivers and the [[Amur River]]. Currently, sturgeon stocks are heavily depleted and under constant pressure from poaching. Inland fisheries are regulated by the ''Law on Fisheries'' discussed above. However, few provisions refer specifically to inland fisheries, although there are specific regulations for same catchments and river systems. These regulations specify closed areas, seasonal closures, gear restrictions, minimum mesh sizes and minimum catch size.<ref name="ministry 2006"/>

====Fishing fleet====
[[File:M-0024 S. Makarevich.jpg|thumb|right|The Russian [[trawler]] ''Sergey Makarevich'' in the North Atlantic. It has just hauled its [[trawling|trawl]] onboard]]
According to the Russian State Marine Register, in 2002, the offshore [[fishing fleet]] cotained about 2,500 [[fishing vessel]]s, 46 [[Factory ship|floating factories]], and 366 transport vessels. Of the fishing vessels, 17 percent were longer than 64 metres ([[Length overall|o/a]]), half were between 34 and 64 metres, and one-third were between 24 and 34 metres. Smaller vessels are not registered with the State Marine Register but are controlled by the State Inspection of Small Size Fleet. In 2005, there were 2,491 such registered vessels. The inland fleet consists of 5,500 small motor boats.<ref name="FAO profile"/>

The main fishing gears used are:<ref name="FAO profile"/> 
* [[Midwater trawling|Midwater trawls]] used by large to mid size [[Factory ship#Freezing trawler|freezing]] and [[Factory ship#Factory stern trawler|processing trawlers]], for [[Alaska pollock]] and [[redfish]]. 
* [[Bottom trawling|Bottom trawls]], used with restrictions by medium  to large sized trawlers, for [[cod]], [[halibut]], [[redfish]], [[flounder]] and other [[demersal fish]]es.
* Shrimp trawls used mostly by specialised mid size shrimp trawlers; 
* Bottom nets deployed by small to mid size vessels targeting cod, halibut and flounder 
* Bottom [[Seine fishing|seines]] used mostly by small vessels for cod, flounders, halibut and other demersal fishes
* [[Drift net]]s used mostly by specialised mid size vessels for [[salmon]]. 
* Bottom [[Longline fishing|longline]]s for cod, halibut and redfish.
* [[Fishing trap|Traps]] and [[Lobster pot|pots]] for [[crab]]s, shrimp and [[whelk]]s, used mostly by small to mid size specialised vessels
* Seines and pound nets for [[herring]] and [[whitefish]]
* [[Fishing dredge|Dredges]] for [[clams]] are deployed from small vessels. 
* Small vessels and boats, often only a few metres long, are also used with kiddles for salmon, and for [[diver]]s harvesting [[sea urchin]]s, [[scallop]]s, [[sea cucumber]], [[kelp]].

An important issue is the ageing of the Russian fishing fleet. Two-thirds of the fishing vessels do not conform to safety norms. Compared to 1990, by 2000 capital investment in the fishery industry had decreased thirty percent and the number of qualified specialists in navigation, fishing and processing technologies had decreased 30 to 40 percent.<ref>Zilanov, V (2001) ''Fish under law?'' Russia Today, 22: 54<U+2013>55 (in Russian).</ref><ref>State Committee for Fisheries, 2003.</ref> An analysis of the [[Barents Sea]] cod fishery illustrates the dominance of elderly and ineffective vessels.<ref>Kalentchenko MM, Kozlovsky AN and Shevchenko VV (2007) ''Economic effectiveness of using the Russian 
fishery fleet in the Barents Sea.'' Series of technical reports <U+201C>Towards sustainable fishery<U+201D> published by WWF Russia. Barents Ecoregion Office of WWF Russia, Murmansk, 53 p. (in Russian).</ref> Between 2002 and 2005, forty percent of the total effort in the [[demersal fish]] fishery was by old middle sized freezing trawlers, yet these vessels produced only twenty-five percent of the total official catch. That is, their effectiveness was 1.5 times lower than most other types of vessels. It was three to four times lower than the effectiveness of modern vessels. The low efficiencies of these elderly vessels also implicates them in involvements with [[IUU]] catch.<ref name="FAO profile"/>  

====Decline of stocks====
Several important stocks have declined as the result of:<ref name="FAO profile"/>  
* natural fluctuations: Pacific [[pilchard]]
* a combination of natural fluctuations and [[overfishing]]: [[Atlantic herring|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific herring]], [[Alaska pollock]], [[capelin]] in the [[Barents Sea]]
* overfishing and continuing [[IUU]]: [[sturgeon]]s, [[Atlantic salmon]], [[red king crab]], [[sea cucumber]]
* a combination of [[marine pollution]] and overfishing: [[whitefish]] and Atlantic salmon in the [[Pechora]] drainage basin, whitefish and sturgeon in the [[Ob River|Ob]] drainage basin, most of the stocks in the [[Amur]] Basin
* ecosystem transformation due to the introduction of [[invasive species]]: [[sprat]] in the [[Black Sea|Black]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]s. 

Aggravating factors surround the growing demand for fish and seafood from East Asian markets, and encourage the fishing industry to devastate stocks in Russia<U+2019>s EEZ. Well established relationships exist between illegal exporters in Russia and importers in China, Japan and South Korea. The effects are magnified by the involvement of criminal groups and corruption, and by the short distances to transport seafood from south [[Sakhalin]], [[Tatar Strait]] and south [[Kurils]] to Japan. Huge fish processing developments in China built on cheap labour encourage the export of further unprocessed fish from Russia to China.<ref name="FAO profile"/> 

==Aquaculture==
Over sixty species of fish, [[invertebrate]]s and [[seaweed]] are cultivated by [[aquaculture]] or [[Fish farm|fish farming]] in Russia.<ref name="federal 2006">State Committee of Fishery of the Russian Federation <U+2013> Federal Agency of Fishery, 2006.</ref> Commercial aquaculture is based mainly on [[carp]], [[grass carp]], [[silver carp]], [[Ictiobus|buffalo]], [[rainbow trout]], [[mussel]]s, [[scallop]]s and [[Laminaria]]. In 2007 there were 300 aquaculture enterprises.<ref>Mitupov, T (2007) [http://allrus.info/main.php?ID=387239 ''Aquaculture in Russia.''] Answers of the head of the Investment <U+2013> Analytical Group <U+201C>Norge-Fish<U+201D> Timur Mitupov to the questionnaire of the Norwegian<U+2013>Russian Trade Chamber.</ref> 

Aquaculture can be freshwater or marine ([[mariculture]]): 

* Freshwater aquaculture is mostly restricted to [[European Russia]], particularly in the northwest where [[trout]] farming is strong, the south of Siberia, and the Far East. Production in 2003<U+2013>2006 was between 100,000 and 115,000 tonnes.<ref name="federal 2006"/>

* Mariculture development in European Russia is confined to areas of the [[Barents Sea|Barents]], [[White Sea|White]] and [[Black Sea]]s, where some salmon, trout and [[blue mussel]] farming has been practised in the past and shows indications of revival. The prime mariculture area is [[Primorsky Krai|Primorye Province]] on the [[Sea of Japan]] coast. In 2006, marine farms in Primorye covered 10,000 hectares, which produces  1,340 tonnes, mainly of Laminaria, blue mussel and the scallop ''Mizuhopecten yessoensis''.<ref>Markovtsev, V (2007) [http://www.rybakprim.ru/article/show/1518 ''Fishery and aquaculture of the world.''] Rybak Primorya (in Russian). 
</ref>  

Potential development areas for freshwater aquaculture include 960,000 hectares of agricultural water bodies, 143,000 hectares of ponds, plus other areas in big lakes and water reservoirs suitable for cage farming. The National Project on Agricultural Sector development (Federal Agency of Fishery, 2006) has set a target for 2020 of 1,400,000 tonnes per year from freshwater aquaculture and 400,000 tonnes per year from mariculture. The federal government is considering subsidising two-thirds of credit needed to construct and modernise aquaculture facilities.<ref name="FAO profile"/> 

==Research==
The Ministry for Fishery Industry in the former Soviet Union maintained an extensive system of research institutes, active in [[oceanography]],  [[marine biology]], resource assessment and fishery regimes, and fishing gear and processing technology. Considerable research was done outside Russian waters to meet the needs of distant water fisheries. 

Until October 2007 many institutes of marine fisheries and oceanography (NIRO) were responsible for resource assessment and research in [[fisheries science]]. These were coordinated by the central fishery institute, VNIRO, in [[Moscow]]. 

In October 2007, all regional institutes were subordinated to VNIRO, and formally became branches of VNIRO. The central institute, GOSNIORH in [[St. Petersburg]], and several other regional institutes research inland fisheries. Notably, the VIERH in Moscow is responsible for economic studies, and the GIPRORYBFLOT in St. Petersburg for technical studies and engineering for fishing vessels and processing capacities.<ref name="FAO profile"/>

==Education==  
Five technical universities are geared to train specialists in fisheries. There are programmes for navigation and marine engineering, processing and processing machinery, the economics of fisheries, fisheries biology and aquaculture. 

Nine universities have graduate programmes for aquaculture specialists while four professional schools are graduating middle level professionals. Each year between 110 and 130 aquaculture specialists are graduated.<ref name="FAO profile"/>

Specialists in fishery oceanography and fish biology also graduate from the biological faculties of several universities. Traditionally the geographical faculties of Moscow and St. Petersburg universities, St. Petersburg Hydrometeorological Institute, and the biological faculties of the [[Moscow State University]], [[Kazan State University]], [[Perm State University]] and the [[Far Eastern National University]] have been particularly importance.<ref name="FAO profile"/>
