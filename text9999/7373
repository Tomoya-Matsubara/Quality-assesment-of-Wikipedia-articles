'''SMS ''Kronprinz''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''Crown Prince''") was the last [[battleship]] of the four-ship {{sclass|K<U+00F6>nig|battleship|4}}. She served in the [[German Imperial Navy]] during [[World War I]]. The battleship was laid down in November 1911 and launched on 21 February 1914. She was formally commissioned into the Imperial Navy on 8 November 1914, just over 4 months after the start of World War I. In June 1918, the ship was renamed '''''Kronprinz Wilhelm''''' in honor of [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]]. The battleship was armed with ten {{convert|30.5|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} guns in five twin turrets and could steam at a top speed of {{convert|21|kn|link=on}}.

Along with her three [[sister ship]]s, {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig||2}}, {{SMS|Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst|1913|2}} (or ''Gro<U+00DF>er''<ref group=Note>This is the German "sharp S"; see [[<U+00DF>]].</ref> ''Kurf<U+00FC>rst''), and {{SMS|Markgraf||2}}, ''Kronprinz'' took part in most of the fleet actions during the war, including the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May and 1 June 1916. Although near the front of the German line, she emerged from the battle unscathed. She was torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|J1}} on 5 November 1916 during an operation off the Danish coast. Following repairs, she participated in [[Operation Albion]], an amphibious assault in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], in October 1917. During the operation ''Kronprinz'' engaged the [[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|Russian battleship ''Tsarevitch'']] and forced her to retreat.

After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] in November 1918, ''Kronprinz'' and most of the [[capital ship]]s of the [[High Seas Fleet]] were interned by the [[Royal Navy]] in [[Scapa Flow]]. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] negotiated the final version of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|ordered the fleet to be scuttled]] to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Unlike most of the other scuttled ships, ''Kronprinz'' was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay.

''Kronprinz'' displaced {{convert|25796|t|ST|abbr=on}} as built and {{convert|28600|t|ST|abbr=on}} fully loaded, with a length of {{convert|175.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a beam of {{convert|19.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|9.19|m|ft|abbr=on}}. She was powered by three Parsons [[steam turbines]] and three oil-fired and twelve coal-fired boilers, which developed a total of 43,300&nbsp;hp (32.3&nbsp;MW) and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|21|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G27/>

She was armed with ten [[30.5 cm SK L/50 gun|30.5&nbsp;cm guns]] arranged in five twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets each fore and aft and one turret amidships between the two funnels.<ref name=G28/> Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) guns, six {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns and five {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam.<ref name=G28/>

==Service history==
''Kronprinz'' was completed in November 1914; following her commissioning she joined the III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet.<ref name=P80>Preston, p.  80</ref> ''Kronprinz'' completed her [[sea trials]] on 2 January 1915. The first operation in which she participated was an uneventful [[sortie]] by the fleet into the [[North Sea]] on 29<U+2013>30 March. Three weeks later, on 17<U+2013>18 April, she and her sisters supported an operation in which the [[light cruiser]]s of the II&nbsp;Scouting Group laid [[naval mine|mines]] off the [[Swarte Bank]]. Another sweep by the fleet occurred on 22 April; two days later III&nbsp;Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of exercises.<ref name=S29>Staff, p. 29</ref> On 8 May an explosion occurred in the center turret's right gun. The Baltic exercises lasted until 13 May, at which point the III Squadron returned to the North Sea.<ref name=S36/> Another minelaying operation was conducted by the II&nbsp;Scouting Group on 17 May, with the battleship again in support.<ref name=S29/>

''Kronprinz'' participated in a fleet operation into the North Sea which ended without combat from 29 until 31 May 1915. The ship supported a minelaying operation on 11<U+2013>12 September off [[Texel]]. The fleet conducted another sweep into the North Sea on 23<U+2013>24 October. Several uneventful sorties followed on 5<U+2013>7 March 1916, 31 March and 2<U+2013>3 April.<ref name=S36/> ''Kronprinz'' supported [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft|a raid on the English coast]] on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force of the I&nbsp;Scouting Group. The battlecruisers left the [[Jade Estuary]] at 10:55&nbsp;[[Central European Time|CET]],<ref group=Note>The Germans were on Central European Time, which is one hour ahead of [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], the time zone commonly used in British works.</ref> and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw.<ref>Tarrant, p. 53</ref> The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the [[Harwich Force]]. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the I&nbsp;Scouting Group. At this point, Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], who had been warned of the sortie of the [[Grand Fleet]] from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.<ref>Tarrant, p. 54</ref>

===Battle of Jutland===
{{Main|Battle of Jutland}}
[[File:Jutland1916.jpg|thumb|350px|Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May&nbsp;<U+2013> 1 June 1916; [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Jutland1916.jpg click] for a larger view.|alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast]]
''Kronprinz'' was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of [[Jutland]] which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. ''Kronprinz'' was the rearmost ship of the V&nbsp;Division of the III&nbsp;Battle Squadron, the [[wikt:vanguard|vanguard]] of the fleet. She followed her sisters ''K<U+00F6>nig'', the lead ship, ''Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst'', and ''Markgraf''. The III&nbsp;Battle Squadron was the first of three battleship units; directly astern were the {{Sclass|Kaiser|battleship|1}}s of the VI&nbsp;Division, III&nbsp;Battle Squadron. Directly astern of the ''Kaiser'' class ships were the {{sclass|Helgoland|battleship|5}} and {{sclass|Nassau|battleship|5}} classes of the II&nbsp;Battle Squadron; in the [[rear guard]] were the obsolescent {{sclass|Deutschland|battleship|5}} class [[pre-dreadnought]]s of the I&nbsp;Battle Squadron.<ref name=T286>Tarrant, p. 286</ref>

Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of [[I Scouting Group]] encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]]. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|2}}, shortly after 17:00,<ref>Tarrant, pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref> and {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}}, less than half an hour later.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 100<U+2013>101</ref> By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, ''K<U+00F6>nig''{{'}}s crew spotted both the I&nbsp;Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a [[Boxing the compass|two-point]] turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given.<ref>Tarrant, p. 110</ref><ref group=Note>The compass can be divided into 32 points, each corresponding to 11.25 degrees. A two-point turn to port would alter the ships' course by 22.5 degrees.</ref>

''Kronprinz''{{'}}s sisters opened fire on the British battlecruisers, but ''Kronprinz'' was not close enough to engage them. Instead, she and ten other German battleships fired at the [[2nd Light Cruiser Squadron]].<ref>Campbell, p. 54</ref> ''Kronprinz'' fired at {{HMS|Dublin|1912|6}} from 17:51 to 18:00 at ranges of {{convert|17000|-|18600|m|abbr=on}}, then shifted her fire to the fast battleship {{HMS|Malaya||2}} at 18:08 at a range of 17,000&nbsp;m. ''Kronprinz'' fired first with semi-armor-piercing shells to find the range to her target, then with standard armor-piercing shells.  By the time ''Malaya'' drew out of range 13 minutes later, only one hit had been reported by ''Kronprinz''{{'}}s gunners.  According to naval historian John Campbell, however, this hit was more likely "the flash of the ''Malaya''{{'}}s guns seen through haze and smoke".<ref>Campbell, p. 99</ref> During this period, several salvos fell close to ''Kronprinz'', though none struck her.<ref>Campbell, p. 100</ref> ''Kronprinz'' again reached a firing position against ''Malaya'' at 18:30, but was only able to fire for six minutes before the British ship again pulled away.<ref>Campbell, p. 104</ref>

Shortly after 19:00, several British destroyers attempted a torpedo attack against the leading ships of the German line. The destroyer {{HMS|Onslow|1916|2}} fired a pair of torpedoes at ''Kronprinz'' at a range of {{convert|7300|m|abbr=on}}, though both missed.<ref>Campbell, pp. 116<U+2013>117</ref> The German cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}} had been disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser {{HMS|Invincible|1908|2}}, and Rear Admiral [[Paul Behncke]] in ''K<U+00F6>nig'' ordered his four ships to maneuver to cover the stricken cruiser.<ref>Tarrant, p. 137</ref> Simultaneously, the British III and IV&nbsp;Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered ''Wiesbaden'' with fire from their main guns. ''Kronprinz'' and her sisters fired heavily on the British cruisers, but failed to drive them off.<ref>Tarrant, p. 138</ref> In the ensuing melee, the British armored cruiser {{HMS|Defence|1907|2}} was struck by several heavy caliber shells from the German [[dreadnought]]s. One salvo penetrated the ship's ammunition magazines and, in a massive explosion, destroyed the cruiser.<ref>Tarrant, p. 140</ref> John Campbell notes that although ''Defence''{{'}}s destruction is usually attributed to the battlecruiser {{SMS|L<U+00FC>tzow||2}}, there is a possibility that it was ''Kronprinz''{{'}}s fire that destroyed the ship.<ref>Campbell, p. 181</ref> After the destruction of ''Defence'', ''Kronprinz'' shifted her fire to {{HMS|Warrior|1905|2}}; the British cruiser was badly damaged and forced to withdraw from the battle. She was unable to reach port, however, and was abandoned the following morning.<ref>Campbell, p. 153</ref>

By 20:00, the German line was ordered to turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet.<ref>Tarrant, p. 169</ref> ''Markgraf'', directly ahead of ''Kronprinz'', had engine problems and fell out of formation, then fell in behind ''Kronprinz''.<ref>Campbell, p. 201</ref> Between 20:00 and 20:30, ''Kronprinz'' and the other III Squadron battleships engaged the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron as well as the battleships of the Grand Fleet. ''Kronprinz'' attempted to find the range by observing the British muzzle flashes, but the worsening visibility prevented her gunners from acquiring a target. As a result, she held her fire in this period.<ref>Campbell, pp. 204<U+2013>205</ref> ''Kronprinz'' was violently shaken by several near misses, however.<ref>Campbell, p. 206</ref> At 20:18, Scheer ordered the fleet to turn away a third time to escape from the murderous British gunfire; this turn reversed the order of the fleet and placed ''Kronprinz'' toward the end of the line.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 172<U+2013>174</ref> After successfully withdrawing from the British, Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation, though communication errors between Scheer aboard {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}} and {{SMS|Westfalen||2}}, the lead ship, caused delays. The fleet fell into formation by 23:30, with ''Kronprinz'' the 14th vessel in the line of 24 capital ships.<ref>Campbell, p. 275</ref>

Around 02:45, several British destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the German line; ''Kronprinz'' spotted several unidentified destroyers in the darkness. ''Kronprinz'' held her fire, and she and the other battleships turned away to avoid torpedoes.<ref>Campbell, pp. 298<U+2013>299</ref> One torpedo, fired by the destroyer {{HMS|Obedient|1916|2}}, exploded about {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} behind ''Kronprinz'', in the battleship's [[wake]]. Both ''Obedient'' and {{HMS|Faulknor|1914|2}} reported a hit on ''Kronprinz'', though she was undamaged by the near miss.<ref>Campbell, p. 299</ref> Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw.<ref>Campbell, pp. 300<U+2013>301</ref> The High Seas Fleet had managed to punch through the British light forces and subsequently reached [[Horns Reef]] by 04:00 on 1&nbsp;June,<ref>Tarrant, pp. 246<U+2013>7</ref> and Wilhelmshaven a few hours later. The I Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer [[roadstead]], while ''Kronprinz'', {{SMS|Kaiser|1911|2}}, {{SMS|Kaiserin||2}}, and {{SMS|Prinzregent Luitpold||2}} stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven.<ref>Campbell, p. 320</ref>

In the course of the battle, ''Kronprinz'' had fired 144 armor-piercing and semi-armor-piercing rounds from her main battery guns,<ref>Campbell, p. 348</ref> though the exact numbers of each are unknown.<ref>Campbell, p. 349</ref> The ship did not fire her secondary 15&nbsp;cm or 8.8&nbsp;cm guns during the entire engagement.<ref>Campbell, p. 359</ref> Of the four ''K<U+00F6>nig''-class ships, only ''Kronprinz'' escaped damage during the battle.<ref name=S36/><ref>Campbell, p. 352</ref>

===Subsequent operations===
On 18 August 1916, ''Kronprinz'' took part in an operation to bombard [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]].<ref name=S36/> Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the original 31 May plan; the two serviceable German battlecruisers<U+2014>{{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} and {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}<U+2014>supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including ''Kronprinz'', would trail behind and provide cover.<ref>Massie, p. 682</ref> The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Admiral Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just eleven weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.<ref>Massie, p. 683</ref>

''Kronprinz'' participated in two uneventful fleet operations, one a month prior on 16 July to the north of Helgoland, and one into the North Sea on 18<U+2013>20 October.<ref name=S36/> ''Kronprinz'' and the rest of III Squadron were sent to the Baltic directly afterward for training, which lasted until 2 November.<ref>Staff, pp. 36<U+2013>37</ref> Upon returning from the Baltic, ''Kronprinz'' and the rest of III Squadron were ordered to cover the retrieval of a pair of [[U-boat]]s that were stranded on the Danish coast. On the return trip, on 5 November 1916, ''Kronprinz'' was torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|J1||2}} near Horns Reef.<ref name=P80/> The torpedo struck the ship beneath the forward-most gun turret and allowed approximately {{convert|250|MT|sp=us}} of water into the ship. ''Kronprinz'' maintained her speed and reached port. The following day she was placed in [[drydock]] at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]] for repairs, which lasted until 4 December.<ref name=S37>Staff, p. 37</ref>

After returning to the III Squadron, ''Kronprinz'' took part in squadron training in the Baltic before conducting defensive patrols in the [[German Bight]]. During training maneuvers on 5 March 1917, ''Kronprinz'' was accidentally rammed by her sister ship {{SMS|Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst|1913|2}} in the [[Heligoland Bight]].<ref name=P80/><ref name=S37/> The collision caused minor flooding; ''Kronprinz'' shipped some {{convert|600|MT|abbr=on}} of water. She again went into the drydock in Wilhelmshaven, from 6 March to 17 May. On 11 September, ''Kronprinz'' was detached for training in the Baltic. She then joined the Special Unit for [[Operation Albion]].<ref name=S37/>

===Operation Albion===
{{Main|Operation Albion}}

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of [[Riga]], the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The ''Admiralstab'' (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of [[Saaremaa|<U+00D6>sel]], and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the [[S<U+00F5>rve Peninsula|Sworbe Peninsula]].<ref>Halpern, p. 213</ref> On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture <U+00D6>sel and [[Muhu|Moon]] Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the [[flagship]], ''Moltke'', along with the III&nbsp;Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. The V&nbsp;Division included the four ''K<U+00F6>nig''-class ships, and was by this time augmented with the new battleship ''Bayern''. The VI&nbsp;Division consisted of the five ''Kaiser''-class battleships. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of [[naval mine|mine]] warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.<ref>Halpern, pp. 214<U+2013>215</ref> Opposing the Germans were the old Russian [[pre-dreadnought]]s [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']] and [[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|''Tsarevitch'']], the [[armored cruiser]]s ''Bayan'', ''Admiral Makarov'', and ''Diana'', 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on <U+00D6>sel numbered some 14,000 men.<ref name=H215>Halpern, p. 215</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-074-34, Besetzung der Insel <U+00D6>sel, Truppenanlandung.jpg|thumb|German troops landing at <U+00D6>sel|alt=A small boat packed with soldiers passes in front of a cruiser and several transport ships]]
The operation began on 12 October; at 03:00 ''K<U+00F6>nig'' anchored off <U+00D6>sel in Tagga Bay and disembarked soldiers. By 05:50, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' opened fire on Russian coastal artillery emplacements,<ref name=S31>Staff, p. 31</ref> joined by ''Moltke'', ''Bayern'', and the other three ''K<U+00F6>nig''-class ships. Simultaneously, the ''Kaiser''-class ships engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and [[Hiiumaa|Dag<U+00F6>]] islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the Gulf. Both ''Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst'' and ''Bayern'' struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions, with minimal damage to the former. ''Bayern'' was severely damaged, and had to be withdrawn to [[Kiel]] for repairs.<ref name=H215/> After the bombardment, ''Kronprinz'' departed the area for [[Putziger Wiek]], where she refueled. The ship passed through Irben Strait on 16 October.<ref name=S37/>

On 16 October, it was decided to detach a portion of the invasion flotilla to clear the Russian naval forces in Moon Sound; these included the two Russian pre-dreadnoughts. To this end, ''Kronprinz'' and ''K<U+00F6>nig'', along with the cruisers {{SMS|Strassburg||2}} and {{SMS|Kolberg||2}} and a number of smaller vessels, were sent to engage the Russian battleships. They arrived by the morning of 17 October, but a deep Russian minefield thwarted their progress. The Germans were surprised to discover that the 30.5&nbsp;cm guns of the Russian battleships out-ranged their own 30.5&nbsp;cm guns.{{#tag:ref|The Russian ships had had their main battery turrets modified to allow elevation of the guns to 30<U+00B0>. This was much greater than the elevation of the German guns.<ref name=H218>Halpern, p. 218</ref>|group=Note}} The Russian ships managed to keep the range long enough to prevent the German battleships from being able to return fire, while still firing effectively on the German ships, and the Germans had to take several evasive maneuvers to avoid the Russian shells. However, by 10:00, the minesweepers had cleared a path through the minefield, and ''Kronprinz'' and ''K<U+00F6>nig'' dashed into the bay. At around 10:15, ''Kronprinz'' opened fire on ''Tsarevitch'' and ''Bayan'', and scored hits on both. ''K<U+00F6>nig'', meanwhile, dispatched ''Slava''. The Russian vessels were hit dozens of times, until at 10:30 the Russian naval commander, [[Mikhail Bakhirev|Admiral Bakhirev]], ordered their withdrawal.<ref name=H218/>

On 18 October, ''Kronprinz'' was slightly grounded, though the damage was not serious enough to necessitate withdrawal for repairs.<ref name=S37/> By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, <U+00D6>sel, and Dag<U+00F6> were in German possession. The previous day, the ''Admiralstab'' had ordered the cessation of naval actions and the return of the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible.<ref>Halpern, p. 219</ref> On the 26th, however, ''Kronprinz'' was more seriously grounded on the return trip to Kiel. She managed to reach Kiel on 2 November, and subsequently Wilhelmshaven. Repairs were effected from 24 November to 8 January.<ref name=S37/>

===Fate===
On 27 January 1918, the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]] directed that the ship be renamed ''Kronprinz Wilhelm'' in honor of the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]].<ref name=P80/> The ship was formally renamed on 15 June 1918, the 30th anniversary of the Kaiser's reign.<ref name=G28/> ''Kronprinz Wilhelm'' and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer<U+2014>by now the [[Grand Admiral]] (''Gro<U+00DF>admiral'') of the fleet<U+2014>intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 280<U+2013>281</ref> On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}} and then on several other battleships, including ''Kronprinz Wilhelm'', mutinied.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 281<U+2013>282</ref> The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.<ref name=T282>Tarrant, p. 282</ref> Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated "I no longer have a navy."<ref>Herwig, p. 252</ref>

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow.<ref name=T282/> Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral [[Adolf von Trotha]] made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions.<ref name=H256>Herwig, p. 256</ref> The fleet rendezvoused with the British [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Cardiff|D58|2}}, which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships.<ref>Herwig, pp. 254<U+2013>255</ref> Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and men.<ref>Herwig, p. 255</ref>

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|ordered the ships to be sunk]] at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.<ref name=H256/> ''Kronprinz Wilhelm'' sank at 13:15;<ref name=G28/> The British guard detail panicked in their attempted to prevent the Germans from scuttling the ships;<ref name=H257>Herwig, p. 257</ref> British soldiers aboard a nearby [[Naval drifter|drifter]] shot and killed a [[Fireman (steam engine)|stoker]] from ''Kronprinz Wilhelm''.<ref name=S37/> In total, the guards killed nine Germans and wounded twenty-one. The remaining crews, totaling some 1,860 officers and enlisted men, were imprisoned.<ref name=H257/> 

''Kronprinz Wilhelm'' was never raised for scrapping, unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled.<ref name=G28/> ''Kronprinz Wilhelm'' and her two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships, which made a salvage attempt more difficult. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations, and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical.<ref name=B229>Butler, p. 229</ref> The rights to future salvage operations on the wreck were sold to Britain in 1962.<ref name=G28/> The depth in which the three battleships sank insulated them from the radiation released by the use of atomic weapons. As a result, ''Kronprinz Wilhelm'' and her sisters are one of the only remaining sources of radiation-free steel. The ships have occasionally had steel removed for use in scientific devices.<ref name=B229/> ''Kronprinz Wilhelm'' and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks.<ref>Konstam, p. 187</ref>
