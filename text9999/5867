'''Benedikt Friedlaender''' ([[July 8]] [[1866]] - [[June 21]] [[1908]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[sexologist]], [[sociologist]], [[economist]], [[volcanologists]] and [[physicist]].

Friedlaender was born in [[Berlin]] and had one brother, [[Immanuel Friedlaender]] ([[1871]]-[[1948]]). He studied in Berlin and finished university 1888. 

He helped work on the magazine ''Kampf'' and gave money to the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] (WhK) in Berlin, where he met [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. The initial focus of the WhK was to work against [[Paragraph 175]] of the Imperial Penal Code, which criminalized "coitus-like" acts between males. The WhK assisted defendants in criminal trials, conducted public lectures, and gathered signatures on a petition for the repeal of the law.

Friedlaender left the WhK in 1902 and, with [[Adolf Brand]] and [[Wilhelm Jansen]], founded the [[LGBT]]-organisation called ''Gemeinschaft der Eigenen,'' or ''The Community of the Self-Owners''.  The word [http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Eigen Eigenen] can mean either "special" or "self-owner", and The Community was inspired in part by the individual anarchism and libertarianism philosophy of [[Max Stirner]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The Community advocated being married and having extramarital relationships with younger men, a practice Friedlaender and Brand followed. The organization folded upon Friedlaender's death.<ref name="blasius">{{citation |title=We Are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics |first=Mark |last=Blasius |first2=Shane |last2=Phelan |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415908590 |page=151-69}}</ref>

Friedlaender wrote several books on different themes. His work ''Die Renaissance des Eros Uranios'' had an important influence on [[Hans Bl<U+00FC>her]].{{Fact|date=October 2007}} ''Absolute or relative motion?'', written with his brother Immanuel in 1896, contributed to the development of [[Mach's Principle]], which in turn played an important historical role in inspiring [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]].

Friedlaender died [[June 21]] [[1908]] in Berlin.
