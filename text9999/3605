'''Caesar Augustus Rodney''' ([[January 4]] [[1772]] &ndash; [[June 10]] [[1824]]) was an [[United States |American]] [[lawyer]] and [[politician]] from [[Wilmington, Delaware |Wilmington]], in [[New Castle County, Delaware |New Castle County]], [[Delaware]]. He was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]], who served in the [[Delaware General Assembly]], as [[United States House of Representatives |U.S. Representative from Delaware]] [[United States Senate |U.S. Senator from Delaware]] [[United States Attorney General |U.S. Attorney General]] and U.S. Minister to [[Argentina]]. He was the nephew of [[Caesar Rodney]], the signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]] who is depicted on the [[Delaware]] [[state quarter]]. 

==Early life and family==
{{seealso |Rodney family of Delaware}}
Rodney was born [[January 4]], [[1772]], in [[Dover, Delaware |Dover]], [[Delaware]], son of [[Thomas Rodney]] and Elizabeth Fisher. After graduating from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1789, he studied law under Joseph B. McKean in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |Philadelphia]] and was admitted to the [[bar association |bar]] in 1793. He practiced law in [[Wilmington, Delaware |Wilmington]] and [[New Castle, Delaware |New Castle]], [[Delaware]], for the next three years. Rodney married Susan Hunn, the daughter of Captain John Hunn and their home was "Cool Springs", located in [[Wilmington, Delaware |Wilmington]].

==Jeffersonian legislator==
Rodney served six terms in the [[Delaware House of Representatives]], from the 1797 session through the 1802 session. There he became one of the leaders of the [[Thomas Jefferson |Jeffersonian]] party, now known as the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]]. Encouraged by Jefferson to compete for the [[United States House of Representatives |U.S. House]] against the staunch [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]] [[James A. Bayard (elder)|James A. Bayard]], Rodney ran and won a lively campaign by fifteen votes. While in the [[United States House of Representatives |U.S. House]], he was a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, and established a national reputation as one of the managers appointed in January 1804 to prepare the articles of [[impeachment]] against [[John Pickering]], judge of the [[United States District Court]] for [[New Hampshire]]. [[John Pickering |Pickering]] was charged with conduct unbecoming a judge, and his acquittal was viewed as strengthening the independence of the judiciary.  In December of the same year, Rodney led another such case against [[Samuel Chase]] [[Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

After serving one term in the [[United States House of Representatives |U.S. House]] from [[March 4]] [[1803]] until [[March 3]] [[1805]], he was defeated for reelection in 1804 by [[James A. Bayard (elder) |Bayard]], by nearly as close a vote. The two men, always vigorous political opponents, remained good friends throughout their tumultuous political careers. 

==Attorney General==
[[Image:Caesar_A_Rodney_US.jpg|225px|left|thumb]]
On [[January 20]] [[1807]] [[U.S. President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] named Rodney his [[United States Attorney General |U.S. Attorney General]] and he served in that office for the remainder of Jefferson's term and for nearly three years in [[U.S. President]] [[James Madison]]'s first term.  As [[United States Attorney General |Attorney General]], Rodney participated as a member of the prosecution during the second [[treason]] trial of former Vice-President [[Aaron Burr]]. He resigned [[December 5]] [[1811]], unhappy about being passed over for a [[Supreme Court of the United States |U.S. Supreme Court]] appointment. During the [[War of 1812]], he was captain of a rifle corps which became the Delaware 1st Artillery. They served at Fort Union in [[Wilmington, Delaware |Wilmington]], on the Canadian frontier, and assisted in the defense of [[Baltimore, Maryland |Baltimore]] in 1814.

==Later career==
Rodney returned to politics serving in the [[Delaware Senate |State Senate]] for three sessions from 1815 through 1817. In 1820 he was again elected to the [[United States House of Representatives |U.S. House]], serving from [[March 4]] [[1821]] until [[January 24]] [[1822]], when he resigned upon being elected to the [[United States Senate |U.S. Senate]]. He served there only a year as well, resigning [[January 29]] [[1823]] to accept a diplomatic appointment. During that brief year Rodney was [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]] dominated [[Delaware]]'s only [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican]] [[United States Senate |U.S. Senator]] ever. 

In 1817 Rodney was appointed by President [[James Monroe]] to lead a commission to investigate whether the newly formed [[South America |South American]] republics should be recognized. He strongly advocated such recognition and, with John Graham, published his findings in 1819 as ''Reports on the Present State of the United Provinces of South America.'' This report is thought to have contributed much to the thinking behind the policy that eventually became expressed as the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. It also resulted in Rodney's 1823 appointment as United States [[Minister (diplomacy)|Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the United Provinces of La Plata, now known as [[Argentina]]. He remained at this posting until his death.  
==Death and legacy==
Rodney died [[June 10]] [[1824]], in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina |Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], and was buried there in the Victoria district British Cemetery. His remains were moved in 1923 to the Charcarita district British Cemetery.

==Public offices==
Elections were held the first Tuesday of October. Members of the [[Delaware House of Representatives |State House]] took office on the first Tuesday of January for a one year term. [[United States House of Representatives |U.S. Representatives]] were popularly elected for a two year term, and the [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] chose the [[United States Senate |U.S. Senators]], for a six year term. Both took office the following March 4th.
