'''F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden National Park''' ({{lang-sv|F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark}}) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[national park]] traversed by the river [[Dal<U+00E4>lven]], about 140&nbsp;km north of [[Stockholm]]. It covers 10,100 hectares, of which 4110 aquatic, on the frontier between the counties of [[Dalarna County|Dalarna]] and [[G<U+00E4>vleborg County|G<U+00E4>vleborg]].

After the retreat of the [[ice sheet]] that covered the region after the last [[ice age]], the river found itself rerouted by an [[esker]] onto a plain uniquely ribbed by the ridges of other eskers, where it formed a succession of rapids and wide bays (called [[fjard|fj<U+00E4>rdar]]), which the river inundates during the spring floods. This particular [[hydrography]], along with the park's proximity to the [[Ecotone|ecological frontier]] between the north and the south, has favored the development of a fauna and flora of great [[biodiversity]]. The park possesses [[Pinophyta|coniferous]], [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed]], and [[Broad-leaved tree|broadleaf]] forests, some of which quite [[Old-growth forest|ancient]], spared by the logging industry because of their inaccessibility. These forests constitute the ideal environment for numerous species, in particular birds, with critical densities of woodpeckers and owls.

If the presence of humans was relatively discreet since the Stone Age, concentrated principally atop the eskers, the development of mining activity (in particular of iron) has profoundly affected the region. The forests were exploited to feed the water-powered forges which grew up along the river. One of the most important was that of Gysinge, founded in 1668 and situated right next to the park. In 1975, in reaction to the threat of the clearing of a vast forest, the movement for the creation of a national park began, culminating in the park's opening in 1998. The park was added to the [[Natura 2000 Network]] and included in the [[Ramsar Convention]]'s list of wetlands.

The park and its environs are important tourist destinations. The river is its favored mode of discovery, but some hiking trails permit other explorations. The park is equally appreciated by fishing enthusiasts.

==Toponymy==
The park takes its name from F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden, which designates the entire section of the river between Tyttbo and Gysinge. The name means "fj<U+00E4>rd of F<U+00E4>rnebo". The Swedish word fj<U+00E4>rd has the same etymology as the Norwegian word fjord, both of which Scandinavian words mean "an expanse of water in a channel".<ref>{{cite book|title=Geomorphological Landscapes of the World|first1=Piotr|last1=Migon|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-3054-2|chapter=23|page=223}}</ref> Most of the bodies of water called fjords in Norwegian were steep glacial valleys into which the sea had penetrated, which was the more restrictive definition which passed into French<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/fjord|title=Fjord|publisher=Dictionnaire Larousse|accessdate=21 October 2011|language=French}}</ref> and English. The name Fj<U+00E4>rnebo is the ancient name of the village of <U+00D6>sterf<U+00E4>rnebo ("East F<U+00E4>rnebo"), situated near the park; its name changed in the 17th century to distinguish it from a F<U+00E4>rnebo in V<U+00E4>stmanland, which was itself rebaptized V<U+00E4>sterf<U+00E4>rnebo ("West F<U+00E4>rnebo").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vasterfarnebo.se/om.html|publisher=V<U+00E4>sterf<U+00E4>rnebo Hembygdsf<U+00F6>rening|title=Om V<U+00E4>sterf<U+00E4>rnebo|accessdate=21 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> The name of the village means "habitation (bo) next to the fj<U+00E4>rd of horsetails (fr<U+00E4>ken, which became F<U+00E4>rne)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nedredalalven.se/nedredalalven/filerdalalven/landskapet-mellan-landskapen.pdf|title=Nedre Dal<U+00E4>lven Landskapet mellan landskapen|publisher=Nedre Dal<U+00E4>lven|accessdate=21 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref>

Besides the Dal<U+00E4>lven, there are many streams inside the park, which flow into the river.

The bedrock of the park is of [[granite]] and granitic [[gneiss]], and dates from the formation of the Svecofennids, a mountain chain formed between 1750 and 2500 million years ago.<ref group=S name=p12/> It underwent a long [[erosion]], leading 600 million years ago to that which one calls the Precambrian [[peneplain]].<ref group=S name=p12/>

During the last ice age, Sweden was covered with an [[ice sheet]], which withdrew from the region about 10000 years ago.<ref group=N name=p33>p. 33</ref> The glacier left behind in the region many [[esker]]s and [[moraine]]s, such as the esker [[Enk<U+00F6>pings<U+00E5>sen]].<ref group=S name=p11/> When the glacier withdrew, the soil had been so compressed by its mass that the entire zone situated to the east of Avesta found itself at sea level.<ref group=N name=p33/> During this maritime period, sediments deposited themselves on the bedrock, which explains why that region even today has superior fertility to that of the rest of the country.<ref name=limes>{{cite web|url=http://pan.cultland.org//cultbase/?document_id=121|website=Pan european thematic network on cultural landscapes and their ecosystems|title=Cultural landscapes of NW Europe (continental and nemoral zones) - General|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref> It is the reason why the line of separation between the north and the south (the ''[[Limes Norrlandicus]]''), which passes not far from the park, is so visible in the region: the zone to the north of the ''limes'' was not covered with these sediments.<ref name=limes/>

When this sea, called the [[Littorina Sea]], the ancestor of the [[Baltic Sea]], withdrew, the Dal<U+00E4>lven found itself blocked at Avesta by one of these eskers formed by the ice sheet: Badelunda<U+00E5>sen.<ref group=N name=p33/> In effect, before the ice age, the river continued in the direction of the [[M<U+00E4>laren]], in which it emptied itself and it so had flooded a valley along this entire section.<ref group=N name=p33/> Because of the fact of the presence of this obstacle, it was forced to head northeast.<ref group=N name=p33/> So, in the whole section of the Lower Dal<U+00E4>lven, the river did not have the time to flood a true valley.<ref group=N name=p33/> It thus had to adapt itself to the topology of the terrain, forming large fj<U+00E4>rds with many isles in the flattest sections and by contrast a course narrower and faster at the different eskers encountered along the way.<ref group=N name=p32>p. 32</ref>

== Natural environment ==

The park of F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden is according to the classification of the WWF, situated in the terrestrial [[ecoregion]] of [[Sarmatic mixed forests]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalspecies.org/protectareas/display/22321|website=Global species|title=F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> not far from the frontier of the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]].

Almost all the types of forest of central Sweden are present in the park, which is due to both the presence of dry and wet environments and to the proximity of the line [[Limes Norrlandicus]] marking the frontier betwee the environments of the north and south.<ref group=S name=p6>p. 6</ref> This implies the presence in the park of environments and species characteristic to both the North and the South of Sweden.<ref group=S name=p6/> A great number of endangered species appear in the park: two species of [[Tracheobionta|vascular plants]],<ref group=S name=p30/> 25 species of [[Bryophyta|mosses]],<ref name=mousses>{{citation|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/vastmanland/SiteCollectionDocuments/sv/publikationer/rapportserie/2005/Rapport2005_10_MossoriFarnebofj.pdf|title=Mossor i F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark: En inventeringsrapport| first1=Tommy|last1=Pettersson|year=2005|editor=L<U+00E4>nsstyrelsen i V<U+00E4>stmanlands l<U+00E4>n|language=Swedish}}</ref> 34 species of [[lichen]]s and 22 species of [[fungi]].<ref group=S name=p31>p. 31</ref>

The park presents different environments as regards flora, the principal being the [[forest]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] ({{units|1000|ha}} making up 9.9% of the park), the mixed forests ({{units|1460|ha}} making up 14.5% of the park), of open bogs ({{unit<U+00E9>|1650|ha}} making up 16.3% of the park) and woods ({{unit<U+00E9>|500|ha}} making up 5% of the park) and finally wetlands ({{unit<U+00E9>|750|ha}} making up 7.4% of the park).<ref group=S name=p17/>

The forests of conifers, principally of [[Norway spruce]] ({{lang|la|''Picea abies''}}), are in particular present in the south of the park,<ref name=mousses/> around Tin<U+00E4>set, on the isle of Torr<U+00F6>n and the peninsula of <U+00D6>byhalv<U+00F6>n.<ref group=S name=p18>p. 18</ref> These forests have not been logged since the 1950s and certain trees are themselves over 120 years old.<ref group=S name=p18/> These old trees as well as the presence of dead wood give this forest a very ancient appearance, and contribute to a great richness of [[lichen]]s and [[fungi]].<ref group=S name=p18/> The soil is often covered in moss, the characteristic species being ''{{lang|la|[[Hylocomium splendens]]}}'', but ''{{lang|la|[[Anastrophyllum hellerianum]]}}'' and ''{{lang|la|[[Nowellia curvifolia]]}}'' are also common.<ref group=S name=p19>p. 19</ref> One can also find [[Vaccinium myrtillus|European blueberries]] ({{lang|la|''Vaccinium myrtillus''}}) and [[lingonberry|lingonberries]] ({{lang|la|''Vaccinium vitis-idaea''}}) in the undergrowth.<ref group=S name=p19/>

The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog.<ref group=S name=p20/> The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by ''calamagrostides blanch<U+00E2>tres'', by [[purple moor grass]] ({{lang|la|''Molinia caerulea''}}), {{lang|la|''Menyanthes trifoliata''}}, yellow loosestrife, swamp cinquefoil ({{lang|la|''Potentilla palustris''}}), [[Ranunculus flammula|lesser spearwort]] ({{lang|la|''Ranunculus flammula''}}), [[Galium palustre|common marsh-bedstraw]] ({{lang|la|''Galium palustre''}}), [[Caltha palustris|kingcup]] ({{lang|la|''Caltha palustris''}}), [[Lythrum salicaria|purple loosestrife]] ({{lang|la|''Lythrum salicaria''}}) and [[Viola (plant)|violettes]], the last being an endangered species in the country.<ref group=S name=p20/> In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly [[Myrica gale|bog myrtle]] ({{lang|la|''Myrica gale''}}), {{lang|la|''[[Andromeda polifolia]]''}}, [[Eriophorum angustifolium|common cottongrass]] ({{lang|la|''Eriophorum angustifolium''}}) and species of [[Carex]].<ref group=S name=p20/> The soil is often covered in [[peat moss]]es and other [[Bryophyta|mosses]].<ref group=S name=p20/>

=== Fauna ===
==== Mammals ====
[[File:Otter in winter.jpg|thumb|alt=Otter in winter|Otter in winter.]]
The park is host to many species of [[mammal]]s. The most widespread are the [[Alces alces|moose]] ({{lang|la|''Alces alces''}}), the [[Capreolus capreolus|roe deer]] ({{lang|la|''Capreolus capreolus''}}), the [[Lepus timidus|mountain hare]] ({{lang|la|''Lepus timidus''}}), the [[Vulpes vulpes|red fox]] ({{lang|la|''Vulpes vulpes''}}), and the [[pine marten]] ({{lang|la|''Martes martes''}})<ref group=S name=p24>p. 24</ref>. Since the 1980s, one can also see [[Castor fiber|Eurasian beaver]] ({{lang|la|''Castor fiber''}}) near the islands of Torr<U+00F6>n and <U+00C4>ngs<U+00F6>n as well as near Gysinge<ref group=S name=p24/>. In 2008, it was similarly found that the [[Sus scrofa|wild boar]] ({{lang|la|''Sus scrofa''}}) was wont to settle the park<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.farnebofjarden.se/pdf/Farnebo_2008_NB2.pdf|author=F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark|title=F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden|publisher=Nyhetsbrev fr<U+00E5>n F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark|year=2008|language=Swedish}}</ref>. More rarely, one sees also the [[Myopus schisticolor|wood lemming]] ({{lang|la|''Myopus schisticolor''}}) in the north part of the park<ref group=S name=p24/>. Four species of mammals present in the park are considered endangered in Sweden<ref group=S name=p30>p. 30</ref>. Thus, the [[Eurasian lynx]] ({{lang|la|''Lynx lynx''}}) can be observed regularly around <U+00D6>byhalv<U+00F6>n, Tin<U+00E4>set and G<U+00E4>rdsvekarna, alongside [[Ursus arctos|brown bears]] ({{lang|la|''Ursus arctos''}}) and [[Canis lupus|gray wolves]] ({{lang|la|''Canis lupus''}}), although these are less frequent<ref group=S name=p24/>. The three other endangered species are the [[Lutra lutra|European otter]] ({{lang|la|''Lutra lutra''}}) that one can see near the rapids, and two species of [[Chiroptera|bats]], the [[Myotis dasycneme|pond bat]] ({{lang|la|''Myotis dasycneme''}}, very rare in Sweden) and the [[Nyctalus noctula|common noctule]] ({{lang|la|''Nyctalus noctula''}})<ref group=S name=p25>p. 25</ref>.

==== Birds ====
[[File:Ardea cinerea F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden national park.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A heron in F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden National Park|A heron in F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden National Park.]]

[[bird|Birds]] are without question F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden's most numerous [[Class (biology)|class]] of animal.<ref group=S name=p25/> More than 200 species have been reported of which at least 107 nest regularly in the park<ref group=S name=p25/>. This richness is in part connected to the presence of characteristic species of both the south and the north<ref name=vattenfaglar>{{Ouvrage|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/vastmanland/SiteCollectionDocuments/sv/publikationer/rapportserie/2004/rapport2004_21VattenfaglarFarnebofjarden.pdf|title=Vattenf<U+00E5>glar i F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark: Inventering 2004|editor=L<U+00E4>nsstyrelsen i V<U+00E4>stmanlands l<U+00E4>n|first1=Stig|last1=Holmstedt|year=2004|language=Swedish}}</ref>. In addition, the park contains species of bird both aquatic and sylvan<ref name=vattenfaglar/>.

The park has a rich population of aquatic birds, attracted by the shallow, fish-rich waters. The proximity of big trees, especially pines, affords them good nesting opportunities<ref group=S name=p25/>. The most common species are the [[Larus canus|common gull]] ({{lang|la|''Larus canus''}}), the [[common tern]] ({{lang|la|''Sterna hirundo''}}), le [[Gavia arctica|black-throated loon]] ({{lang|la|''Gavia arctica''}}), and the [[Cygnus olor|mute swan]] ({{lang|la|''Cygnus olor''}})<ref name=vattenfaglar/>. In the wetlands, one often finds the [[Ardea cinerea|grey heron]] ({{lang|la|''Ardea cinerea''}}), the [[Tetrao urogallus|western capercaillie]] ({{lang|la|''Tetrao urogallus''}}) or even the [[Grus grus|common crane]] ({{lang|la|''Grus grus''}})<ref group=S name=p25/>. One of the most notable aquatic species is the [[osprey]] ({{lang|la|''Pandion haliaetus''}}), with thirty couples <U+2014> probably one of the most important densities of the country<ref group=S name=p25/>. The [[Haliaeetus albicilla|white-tailed eagle]] ({{lang|la|''Haliaeetus albicilla''}}), a species classified as endangered in the country, practically vanished from the park in the 1970s, but it is now returned<ref name=vattenfaglar/>.

[[File:Strix uralensis-male2.jpg|thumb|alt=A Ural owl|The Ural owl, symbol of the park.]]

However, it is the forest species which are the most notable of the park, especially the [[Picidae|woodpeckers]] and [[strigiformes|owls]]<ref group=S name=p25/>. Concerning woodpeckers, the [[great spotted woodpecker]] ({{lang|la|''Dendrocopos major''}}) is the most common, but the [[Dryocopus martius|black woodpecker]] ({{lang|la|''Dryocopus martius''}}), the [[European green woodpecker]] ({{lang|la|''Picus viridis''}}) and the [[lesser spotted woodpecker]] ({{lang|la|''Dendrocopos minor''}})  are also themselves common<ref group=S name=p25/>. The population of [[Dendrocopos leucotos|white-backed woodpecker]] ({{lang|la|''Dendrocopos leucotos''}}), a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals in the whole country in 2004<ref>{{Ouvrage|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Documents/publikationer/620-5486-4_del1.pdf|title=<U+00C5>tg<U+00E4>rdsprogram f<U+00F6>r bevarande av Vityggig H<U+00E4>ckspett|year=2005|author=Naturv<U+00E5>rdsverket|isbn=91-620-5486-4|language=Swedish}}</ref>, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003<ref name=ugglor>{{Ouvrage|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/vastmanland/SiteCollectionDocuments/sv/publikationer/rapportserie/2003/Rapport2003_12_UgglorolovskogsfagelFarnebofj.pdf|title=Ugglor och l<U+00F6>vtr<U+00E4>dsberoende f<U+00E5>gelarter i F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark: En inventering v<U+00E5>ren 2003|first1=Stig|last1=Holmstedt|editor=L<U+00E4>nsstyrelsen i V<U+00E4>stmanlands l<U+00E4>n|year=2003|language=Swedish}}</ref>, and then a new couple in 2010<ref name=dosblanc>{{citation|url=http://www.farnebofjarden.se/pdf/Farnebo_2010_NB2.pdf|author=F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark|title=Vitrygg p<U+00E5> v<U+00E4>g tillbaka|publisher=Nyhetsbrev fr<U+00E5>n F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark|year=2008|language=Swedish}}</ref>. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the [[grey-headed woodpecker]] ({{lang|la|''Picus canus''}}) is becoming more common<ref name=ugglor/>. Regarding owls, the most common species are the [[Glaucidium passerinum|Eurasian pygmy owl]] ({{lang|la|''Glaucidium passerinum''}}) and the [[Strix uralensis|Ural owl]] ({{lang|la|''Strix uralensis''}})<ref name=ugglor/>. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park<ref name=ugglor/>. Apart from these species, there are the [[common buzzard]] ({{lang|la|''Buteo buteo''}}), the [[Eurasian hobby]] ({{lang|la|''Falco subbuteo''}}), or even, among others, the [[European honey buzzard]] ({{lang|la|''Pernis apivorus''}})<ref group=S name=p25/>.

==== Reptiles and amphibians ====
[[File:F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden Vipera berus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Adder in F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden National Park|Adder in F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden National Park.]]
The park has all major Swedish species of [[Amphibia|amphibians]]<ref group=S name=p26>p. 26</ref>. Among these species, one can number the [[Bufo bufo|common toad]] ({{lang|la|''Bufo bufo''}}), the [[Rana temporaria|common frog]] ({{lang|la|''Rana temporaria''}}) and the [[Rana arvalis|moor frog]] ({{lang|la|''Rana arvalis''}}), as well as the [[northern crested newt]] ({{lang|la|''Triturus cristatus''}}) and the [[Lissotriton vulgaris|smooth newt]] ({{lang|la|''Lissotriton vulgaris''}})<ref group=S name=p26/>. Among the [[Reptile|reptiles]], the most common species are two [[snake]]s, the [[common European adder]] ({{lang|la|''Vipera berus''}}) and the [[Natrix natrix|grass snake]] ({{lang|la|''Natrix natrix''}}), as well as the [[Zootoca vivipara|viviparous lizard]] ({{lang|la|''Zootoca vivipara''}}) and the [[Anguis fragilis|slowworm]] ({{lang|la|''Anguis fragilis''}})<ref group=S name=p26/>.

==== Fish ====
The waters of the park are among Sweden's richest, which can be explained by a great number of factors, such as their optimal [[pH|acidity]], a great richness of nutrients, or even, among other things, the zones of rapids alternating with calmer zones<ref group=S name=p26/>. These waters permit the park have not only a great number of species, but also a great number of individual fish and certain fish of enormous size<ref group=S name=p26/>. Among the species present, one can name several species of [[Cyprinidae|cyprinids]] (the family of [[carp]], [[Minnow|minnows]], [[Barb (fish)|barbs]], [[Barbel (fish)|barbels]], and others), of which in particular the [[Aspius aspius |asp]] ({{lang|la|''Aspius aspius''}}), rare in Sweden<ref group=S name=p27>p. 27</ref>. The waters abound also with [[Esox lucius|northern pike]] ({{lang|la|''Esox lucius''}}), with specimens weighing sometimes {{units|20|kg}}, with [[Perca fluviatilis|redfin perch]] ({{lang|la|''Perca fluviatilis''}}), with [[Sander lucioperca|zander]] ({{lang|la|''Sander lucioperca''}}), and with [[Thymallus thymallus|grayling]] ({{lang|la|''Thymallus thymallus''}}) <U+2014> which species is classified as endangered in Sweden, much like the [[Salmo trutta|brown trout]] ({{lang|la|''Salmo trutta''}})<ref group=S name=p27/>. The [[Salmo salar|Atlantic salmon]] ({{lang|la|''Salmo salar''}}) was also present in the park's waters, but the [[dam]]s downstream have considerably reduced its possibilities of rejoining the park<ref group=S name=p28>p. 28</ref>. The [[noble crayfish]] ({{lang|la|''Astacus astacus''}}), a species endangered worldwide<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/2191/0|website=The IUCN red list of threatened species|title=Astacus astacus|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref>, was relatively common in the waters of the Dal<U+00E4>lven, but has now almost disappeared; some catches in the park are however reported from time to time<ref group=S name=p28/>.

==== Insects ====
Only the [[insect]]s of the forests have been reliably inventoried, but more than 70 species of insect are already inscribed on the list of species endangered in Sweden<ref group=S name=p28/>. The presence of [[dead wood]] favors the presence of numerous insects<ref group=S name=p29>p. 29</ref>. Most of the forest insects live in the [[sapwood]] or between the sapwood and the [[bark]]<ref group=S name=p29/>. In particular, the Norway spruce and the English oak are the trees supporting the greatest richness in insects<ref group=S name=p29/>.

The species of insect most associated with the park and the Lower Dal<U+00E4>lven in general are [[Culicidae|mosquito]]s of the genus ''[[Aedes]]''<ref group=S name=p29/>. Indeed, the park's wetlands are enormously productive in mosquitos, especially during the heavy spring floods<ref group=S name=p29/>. The quantity of mosquitos in the Lower Dal<U+00E4>lven has no equivalent in Sweden besides that in the vast wetlands of [[Laponian area|Lappland]]<ref group=S name=p29/>. This abundance bothers not only the park's tourists during the summer<ref group=S name=p29/> but also the entire region as far as [[Uppsala]]<ref name=myggUppsala>{{citation|url=http://www.unt.se/ledare/om-myggplagan-vid-dalalven-1337826.aspx|title=Om myggpl<U+00E5>gan vid Dal<U+00E4>lven|publisher=Upsala nya tidning|first1=H<U+00E5>kan|last1=Holmberg|date=11 May 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref>. Between 2002 and 2008, the [[insecticide]] ''{{lang|la|[[Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis]]}}'' was used to try to regulate these populations, which needed a waiver, its use being forbidden in Sweden and contrary to the principles of the national park<ref name=mygg2002>{{Ouvrage|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Documents/publikationer/978-91-620-6305-4.pdf|title=Mygg och Bti i nedre Dal<U+00E4>lven|month=October|year=2009|editor=Naturv<U+00E5>rdsverket|isbn=978-91-620-6305-4|first1=Christer|last1=Nilsson|first2=Birgitta|last2=Ren<U+00F6>f<U+00E4>lt|language=Swedish}}</ref>. However, the project was not renewed, this method not being considered a durable solution and some scientists arguing that the mosquitos make up part of the region's ecosystem<ref name=mygg2002/>.

== History ==

=== Initial settlements and agriculture ===
{{units|6000|years}} ago, the Lower Dal<U+00E4>lven was a bay of the Littorina Sea, but as the land rose, the crests ([[esker]]s) became the best sites for the first permanent settlements.<ref group=N name=p44>p. 44</ref> It was easy to nourish oneself, thanks to the river, and these places were the easiest to defend.<ref group=N name=p44/> In addition, the river was easer to cross at this point.<ref group=N name=p44/> In addition, it is atop the esker of Enk<U+00F6>pings<U+00E5>sen that one finds most of the prehistoric sites,<ref group=S name=p14>p. 14</ref> and many of today's routes follow the trace of ancient routes along the eskers.<ref group=N name=p44/> Among the park's prehistoric sites, one can count the Stone Age sites at Tr<U+00E5>ngn<U+00E4>s and Sand<U+00F6>n et the [[cairn]]s atop Hem<U+00F6>n and Ut<U+00F6>n.<ref group=S name=p14/>

When sedentary agriculture developed in the region during the Bronze and Iron Ages, the slopes of the crests were again the favorite settlement sites, being easier to cultivate and above the floodplain.<ref group=N name=p44/> However, these wetlands were also used for haymaking, giving an important production of good quality.<ref group=S name=p15>p. 15</ref> The [[hay]] was stocked in nearby barns and carried to the surrounding villages during the winter to feed the animals.<ref group=S name=p15/> Some of these barns are still visible near Torr<U+00F6>sundet and atop V<U+00E4>ster<U+00F6>n.<ref group=S name=p15/> Woodlands were summer granting lands ([[transhumance]]) and some cabins ({{lang|sv|''F<U+00E4>bod''}}) were constructed there in order to look after the animals during this time.<ref group=S name=p15/> Fifteen of these cabins are scattered in and around the park, mainly near Tin<U+00E4>set and south of Gysinge.<ref group=S name=p15/> Transhumance ceased at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref group=S name=p15/>

=== Industry ===
[[File:F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden old mill Gysinge.jpg|thumb|alt=Ruins of a water-powered mill at Gysinge|Ruins of a water-powered mill at Gysinge.]]
One of the characteristics of the region that has strongly influenced the mode of life there ever since the Iron Age is its abundance of [[metals]], in particular of [[iron]].<ref group=N name=p44/> The settlers began then to combine agriculture with iron extraction.<ref group=N name=p44/> This exploitation has left numerous traces inside the park. Certain zones in the park were themselves used as extraction sites, such as Tin<U+00E4>set, where [[limonite]] was extracted from the marsh.<ref group=N name=p44/> The iron industry in the region necessitated a huge consumption of wood which which initially justified [[sylviculture]] in the park.<ref group=S name=p15/> Accordingly, the woods of Tin<U+00E4>set, for example, were heavily logged to feed the silver mine of Sala.<ref group=S name=p15/> At the end of the 19th century, many mills were constructed along the river: they were used for timber rafting.<ref group=S name=p16>p. 16</ref> This activity ceased upon the creation of dams along the river.<ref group=N name=p46>p. 46</ref> Gysinge has a timber rafting [[museum]].<ref group=N name=p46/> The wettest forests largely escaped the logging industry, thereby serving as sanctuaries of biodiversity during this period of exploitation.<ref group=S name=p16/>

However, the most evident trace of the iron industry in the region is the forge of Gysinge. This forge was established in 1668<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gysingeherrgard.se/historik.html|website=Gysinge Herrg<U+00E5>rd|title=Historik om Gysinge Herrg<U+00E5>rd|accessdate=19 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> initially for the production of arms.<ref group=S name=p16/> The forge's location permitted a good access to metal, extracted at the mine of Dannemora,<ref group=N name=p45>p. 45</ref> to wood and to the energy of the Gysinge rapids. The forge grew rapidly and in the 18th century there were constructed around the forge homes, mills, stables, a manor and even a hotel.<ref group=S name=p16/> In the 18th century, the forge was one of the largest in the country, with 50 people working at the mill proper, and 3000 people connected to the forge in other ways.<ref group=S name=p16/> The forge was also the first in the world to use an oven for induction, the oven Kjellin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/fer-fonte-et-acier-reperes-chronologiques/|website=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Universalis|title=Fer, fonte et acier (rep<U+00E8>res chronologiques)|accessdate=19 October 2011|language=French}}</ref> The forge closed at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref group=S name=p16/>

A hydroelectric plant was constructed at Gysinge in 1917,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vattenkraft.info/?page=kraftverk&id=816|website=Vattenkraft|title=Gysinge|accessdate=19 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> but it consists only of one small scale plant, using one deflection of a small part of the river.

=== Protection ===
The Lower Dal<U+00E4>lven has for a long time been recognized in Sweden as a remarkable site worthy of protection.<ref group=S name=p11/> In the 1960s, the Swedish society for nature conservation (''naturskyddsf<U+00F6>reningen'') engaged itself for the protection of F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden, in particular the area of Tin<U+00E4>set, and made many inventories in the area.<ref group=S name=p11/> At the beginning of the 1970s, Stora AB tried to clear all the forests it owned in the northern part of Tin<U+00E4>set.<ref name=naturskydd>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/natur-och-miljo/djur-och-natur/faglar/vitryggig-hackspett/vinstlott-for-virkestjuvar/|website=Naturskyddsf<U+00F6>reningen|title=Vinstlott f<U+00F6>r "virkestjuvar"|accessdate=21 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> In response the ornithologist Stig Holmstedt made contact with the Swedish nature conservation society and formed a group to work towards the protection of the zone,<ref name=naturskydd/> which led to the formation of a proposition for a national park in 1975.<ref group=S name=p11/> Only the commune of Sandviken took up the idea and formed the same year the nature reserve of Gysinge.<ref name=gysingereservat>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandviken.se/kulturfritid/naturochfriluftsliv/naturomraden/naturreservat/gysinge.4.195dd5bf9174c73697fff2841.html|website=Sandvikens kommun|title=Gysinge|accessdate=21 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> In the following years, the geomorphology, fauna and flora of the Lower Dal<U+00E4>lven were systematically inventoried.<ref group=S name=p11/> This began at the formulation of a protection plan by [[Naturv<U+00E5>rdsverket]] and the concerned counties.<ref group=S name=p11/> In 1989, in the first directive for the creation of national parks established by Naturv<U+00E5>rdsverket, F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden was proposed as a future national park.<ref group=S name=p11/> In 1997, F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden is proposed on the list of the [[Ramsar Convention]],<ref group=S name=p11/> and, finally, the national park was established by the king on 10 September 1998.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.farnebofjarden.se/pdf/Farnebo_2008_NB1.pdf|author=F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark|title=F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden|periodical=Nyhetsbrev fr<U+00E5>n F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark|year=2008|language=Swedish}}</ref> The motive for creating the park was to preserve a unique fluvial landscape as well as rich forests and and surrounding wetlands in a relatively intact state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lagboken.se/files/SFS/2011/110841.PDF|website=Lagbocken|title=F<U+00F6>rordning om <U+00E4>ndring i nationalparksf<U+00F6>rordningen (1987:938)|accessdate=25 January 2012|language=Swedish}}</ref> It thus includes a large part of the old reserve of Gysinge, which accordingly was reformed in 1999 with all the zones not included in the park.<ref name=gysingereservat/> 19 Novemebr 2001, the park was finally added to the Ramsar list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list-annotated-ramsar-16170/main/ramsar/1-31-218%5E16170_4000_0__ |title=The Annotated Ramsar List: Sweden |website=Convention de Ramsar |accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> It is also included in the [[Natura 2000 Network]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.farnebofjarden.se/natura2000_eng.asp?activeImg=nav-choice9eng|website=F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden|title=Natura 2000|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> In 2011, the Lower Dal<U+00E4>lven was classified as a [[Biosphere Reserve]] by [[UNESCO]] under the name country of the river Nedre Dal<U+00E4>lven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fr/natural-sciences/about-us/single-view/news/18_new_biosphere_reserves_added_to_unescos_man_and_the_biosphere_mab_programme/|website=UNESCO|title=18 nouvelles r<U+00E9>serves de biosph<U+00E8>re sont ajout<U+00E9>es au r<U+00E9>seau MAB de l<U+2019>UNESCO|accessdate=23 October 2011|language=French}}</ref>

Like most of the [[Swedish national parks]], the management and administration are divided between the Swedish environmental protection agency ([[Naturv<U+00E5>rdsverket]]) and the administrative council of the [[Counties in Sweden|counties]] (L<U+00E4>nsstyrelse).<ref name=loi>{{cite web|url=http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19870938.htm|website=Notisum|title=Nationalparksf<U+00F6>rordning (1987:938)|accessdate=17 September 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> Naturv<U+00E5>rdsverket is charged with the proposal of new national parks, through consultation with administrative councils of the counties and [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]]; a vote of the [[Riksdag|parliament]] endorses their creation.<ref name=loi/> If a park is approved, the state buys the land, through the intermediairy of the Naturv<U+00E5>rdsverket.<ref name=loi/> The management of the park is then principally in the hands of the county. Despite the fact that the park of F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden spans the territories of four counties, only the administrative council of [[V<U+00E4>stmanland County|V<U+00E4>stmanland]] is responsible for the management of the park.<ref group=S name=p38>p. 38</ref> In contrast, park's nature center is led by [[G<U+00E4>vleborg County|G<U+00E4>vleborg]], since it is situated on G<U+00E4>vleborg's territory.<ref name=naturum/>

The management work for the park includes the maintenance of tourism structures (such as trails, cabins),<ref group=S name=p38/> as well as the maintenance of certain meadows.<ref group=S name=p33>p. 33</ref> If appropriate, the park authorities can regulate the beaver population, which is capable of harming the forest.<ref group=S name=p35>p. 35</ref> Elk, deer, and American mink hunting is allowed for population regulation purposes, but is forbidden between 1 January and 15 August.<ref group=S name=p35/> To protect the birds, access to certain zones can be forbidden during nesting season, from 1 January to 15 June.<ref group=S name=p9>p. 9</ref> These fixed zones have been replaced in 2015 by the possibility of creating temporary zones permitting themselves to adapt to zones where the most vulnerable species are found.<ref name=newrules>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/farnebofjarden|title=Nya f<U+00F6>reskrifter f<U+00F6>r F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark|language=sv|website=[[Naturv<U+00E5>rdsverket]]}}</ref> The ban on commercial activity has also been lifted.<ref name=newrules/> Finally, the speed limit for boats was lowered from 12 to 7 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] except for certain sections where the maximum speed is capped at 12 or 20 knots.<ref name=newrules/>

== Tourism ==

The park and the surrounding zones attract many tourists. In addition, the Gysinge forge is visited annually by 250,000 people <U+2014> a figure rapidly growing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nedredalalven.se/nedredalalven/filerdalalven/nedredalalven.pdf|website=Nedre Dal<U+00E4>lven|title=Det h<U+00E4>r <U+00E4>r NeDa|access-date=21 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> the peninsula of <U+00D6>sta by 75,000 people and Tyttbo by 10,000 people.<ref group=S name=p35/> However, these visits are in general highly localized.<ref group=S name=p35/>

The main entrances of the park are at Gysinge and Sevedskvarn,<ref group=S name=p31/> both situated near national route 56. These entries have [[parking]].<ref group=S name=p31/> [[camping|Camp grounds]] exist at <U+00D6>sta, Tyttbo and <U+00D6>sterf<U+00E4>rnebo,<ref group=S name=p31/> and it is also possible to stay at Gysinge forge's hotel ({{lang|sv|Gysinge bruk W<U+00E4>rdshus}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gysingebrukwardshus.se/hotell.html|website=Gysinge bruk W<U+00E4>rdshus|title=Boende hos oss|access-date=21 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> Inside the park itself, many cabins are available for passing the night, many of them ancient [[shepherd]] cabins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.farnebofjarden.se/pdf2/Stugor%20i%20F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens%20NP_en.pdf|website=F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden national park|title=Cabins in F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden National Park|access-date=21 October 2011}}</ref>

The principal activities inside the park in summer are [[sport fishing]] as well as boat or [[canoe]] trips.<ref group=S name=p35/> Navigation by boat is in fact one of the best ways to explore the park, and the island of Sand<U+00F6>n is particularly popular.<ref group=S name=p35/> The park also attracts many [[bird watchers]] in winter and spring, especially near Tin<U+00E4>set where the birdlife is the richest.<ref group=S name=p35/> However, the part of the road that enabled one to get there was closed because it traversed the park <U+2014> which closing was decided during the park's creation.<ref group=S name=p38/> As a result, the number of tourists at this location diminished considerably.<ref name=ugglor>{{cite book|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/vastmanland/SiteCollectionDocuments/sv/publikationer/rapportserie/2003/Rapport2003_12_UgglorolovskogsfagelFarnebofj.pdf|title=Ugglor och l<U+00F6>vtr<U+00E4>dsberoende f<U+00E5>gelarter i F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rdens nationalpark: En inventering v<U+00E5>ren 2003|first1=Stig|last1=Holmstedt|editor=L<U+00E4>nsstyrelsen i V<U+00E4>stmanlands l<U+00E4>n|year=2003|language=Swedish}}</ref> A visitor, information, and nature center was built inside an old barn (dating from 1814) of the Gysinge forge.<ref name=naturum>{{cite web|url=http://www.farnebofjarden.se/naturum.asp?activeImg=nav-choice8|website=F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden|title=Naturum F<U+00E4>rnebofj<U+00E4>rden|access-date=21 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> At Skekarsbo, an [[observation tower]] {{unit|20|m}} in height was constructed in 1995 and offers a panoramic view over the major part of the park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarnsjo.se/index.php?page=skekarsbo|website=T<U+00E4>rnsj<U+00F6>|title=Skekarsbo|access-date=21 October 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> Several hiking trails exist inside the park, in particular in the north part: on the isle of Matt<U+00F6>n (between Gysinge and Sevedskvarn), a part of G<U+00E4>strikeleden across the park from Gysinge, and from Kyrkstigen up to Skekarsbo.<ref group=S name=p37>p. 37</ref> In the southern part, a long trail leads to Tin<U+00E4>set.<ref name=brochure/>
