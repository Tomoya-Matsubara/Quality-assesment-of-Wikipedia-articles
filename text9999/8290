The [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BCE-220 CE) of ancient [[China]] experienced contrasting periods of economic prosperity and decline. It is normally divided into three periods: Western Han (202 BCE <U+2013> 9 CE), the [[Xin Dynasty]] (9<U+2013>23 CE), and Eastern Han (25<U+2013>220 CE). The Xin Dynasty, established by the former regent [[Wang Mang]], formed a brief interregnum between lengthy periods of Han rule. Following the fall of Wang Mang, the Han capital was moved eastward from [[Chang'an]] to [[Luoyang]]. In consequence, historians have named the succeeding eras Western Han and Eastern Han respectively.<ref>Hinsch (2002), 24<U+2013>25; Cullen (2006), 1.</ref>

Major features of the Han economy were: significant [[population growth]], increasing urbanization, unprecedented growth of industry and trade and government experimentation with [[nationalization]]. In this era, the levels of minting and circulation of [[Ancient Chinese coinage|coin currency]] grew significantly, forming the foundation of a stable [[monetary system]]. The [[Silk Road]] facilitated the establishment of trade and tributary exchanges with [[Foreign relations of Imperial China|foreign countries]] across [[Eurasia]], many of which were previously unknown to the [[Chinese people|people of ancient China]]. The imperial capitals of both Western-Han (Chang'an), and of Eastern-Han (Luoyang), were among the largest cities in the world at the time, in both population and area. Here, government workshops manufactured furnishings for the [[Chinese Palaces|palaces]] of the [[Emperor of China|emperor]] and produced goods for the common people. The government oversaw the construction of roads and bridges, which facilitated official government business and encouraged commercial growth. Under Han rule, industrialists, wholesalers and merchants<U+2014>from minor shopkeepers to wealthy businessmen<U+2014>could engage in a wide range of enterprises and trade in the domestic, public, and even military spheres. 

In the early Han period, rural peasant farmers were largely self-sufficient, but they began to rely more heavily upon commercial exchanges with the wealthy landowners of large agricultural estates. Many peasants fell into debt and were forced to become either hired laborers or rent-paying [[Tenant farmer|tenants]] of the land-owning classes. The Han government continually strove to provide economic aid to poor farmers, who had to compete with powerful and influential [[Four occupations|nobles, landowners, and merchants]]. The government tried to limit the power of these wealthy groups through heavy taxation and bureaucratic regulation. [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu's]] (r. 141<U+2013>87 BCE) government even nationalized the iron and salt industries; however, these government monopolies were repealed during Eastern Han. Increasing government intervention in the private economy during the late 2nd century BCE severely weakened the commercial merchant class. This allowed wealthy landowners to increase their power and to ensure the continuation of an agrarian-dominated economy. The wealthy landlords eventually dominated commercial activities as well, maintaining control over the rural peasants<U+2014>upon whom the government relied for tax revenues<U+2014>military manpower, and public works labor. By the 180s CE, economic and political crises had caused the Han government to become heavily decentralized, while the great landowners became increasingly independent and powerful in their communities.

During the [[Warring States Period]] (403<U+2013>221 BCE), the development of private commerce, new trade routes, handicraft industries, and [[Chinese currency|a money economy]] led to the growth of new urban centers. These centers were markedly different from the older cities, which had merely served as power bases for the [[Chinese nobility|nobility]].<ref name="nishijima 1986 574">Nishijima (1986), 574.</ref> The use of a standardized, nationwide currency during the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221<U+2013>206 BCE) facilitated long-distance trade between cities.&nbsp;<ref name="hinsch 2002 28">Hinsch (2002), 28.</ref> Many Han cities grew large: the Western Han capital, [[Chang'an]], had approximately 250,000 inhabitants, while the Eastern Han capital, [[Luoyang]], had approximately 500,000 inhabitants.<ref>Nishijima (1986), 574<U+2013>575; Stearns & Langer (2001), 51.</ref> The population of the Han Empire, recorded in the tax [[census]] of 2 CE, was 57.6 million people in 12,366,470 households.<ref>Schinz (1996), 136; Nishijima (1986), 595<U+2013>596.</ref> The majority of commoners who populated the cities lived in extended urban and suburban areas outside the [[Chinese city wall|city walls]] and [[gatehouse]]s.<ref>Schinz (1996), 140; Wang (1982), 1<U+2013>4, & 30.</ref> The total urban area of Western-Han Chang'an<U+2014>including the extensions outside the walls<U+2014>was 36&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (13.9 mi<sup>2</sup>).

===Variations in currency===

During the early Western Han period, founding [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] (r. 202-195 BCE) closed government [[Mint (coin)|mints]] in favor of [[Ancient Chinese coinage|coin currency]] produced by the [[private sector]].<ref name="nishijima 1986 586">Nishijima (1986), 586.</ref> Gaozu's widow [[Empress L<U+00FC> Zhi]], as [[grand empress dowager]], abolished private minting in 186 BCE. She first issued a government-minted bronze coin weighing 5.7 g (0.2 oz), but issued another, weighing 1.5&nbsp;g (0.05&nbsp;oz), in 182 BCE.<ref name="nishijima 1986 586"/> The change to the lighter coin caused widespread inflation, so in 175 BCE [[Emperor Wen of Han]] (r. 180<U+2013>157 BCE) lifted the ban on private minting; private mints were required to mint coins weighing exactly 2.6&nbsp;g (0.09&nbsp;oz).<ref name="nishijima 1986 586"/> Private minting was again abolished in 144 BCE during the end of [[Emperor Jing of Han]]'s (r. 157<U+2013>141 BCE) reign. Despite this, the 2.6&nbsp;g (0.09&nbsp;oz) bronze coin was issued by both central and local [[commandery]] governments until 120 BCE, when for one year it was replaced with a coin weighing 1.9&nbsp;g (0.067&nbsp;oz).<ref name="nishijima 1986 586 587">Nishijima (1986), 586<U+2013>587.</ref> Other currencies were introduced around this time. [[Token money]] notes made of embroidered white deerskin, with a face value of 400,000 coins, were used to collect government revenues.<ref name="nishijima 1986 586 587"/> Emperor Wu also introduced three tin-silver alloy coins worth 3,000, 500, and 300 bronze coins respectively; all of these weighed less than 120&nbsp;g (4.23&nbsp;oz).<ref name="nishijima 1986 586 587"/>

In 119 BCE, the government issued the bronze ''wushu'' (<U+4E94><U+9296>) coin weighing 3.2 g (0.11 oz); the coin remained the standard currency in China until the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618<U+2013>907 CE).<ref name="nishijima 1986 587">Nishijima (1986), 587.</ref> During the brief interruptive [[Xin Dynasty]] (9<U+2013>23 CE) of [[Wang Mang]] (45 BCE <U+2013> 23 CE), the government introduced several new denominations in 7, 9, 10, and 14 CE. These new units (including bronze [[knife money]], gold, silver, tortoise, and cowry shell currencies) often had a market price unequal to their weight and debased the value of coin currency.<ref name="ebrey 1986 609 bielenstein 1986 232 233 nishijima 1986 588"/> Once the widespread civil wars following Wang's overthrow abated, the ''wushu'' coin was reintroduced by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] (r. 25-57 CE) in 40 CE at the instigation of [[Ma Yuan (Han Dynasty)|Ma Yuan]] (14 BCE <U+2013> 49 CE).<ref name="ebrey 1986 609 bielenstein 1986 232 233 nishijima 1986 588">Ebrey (1986), 609; Bielenstein (1986), 232<U+2013>233; Nishijima (1986), 588.</ref> Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight, the central government closed all commandery mints in 113 BCE and granted the central government's [[Government of the Han Dynasty#Superintendent of Waterways and Parks|Superintendent of Waterways and Parks]] the exclusive right to mint coins.<ref name="nishijima 1986 587 588">Nishijima (1986), 587<U+2013>588.</ref> Although the issue of central government coinage was transferred to the office of the [[Government of the Han Dynasty#Minister of Finance|Minister of Finance]] (one of [[Nine Ministers]] of the central government) by the beginning of Eastern Han, the central government's monopoly over the issue of coinage persisted.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 83">Bielenstein (1980), 47 & 83.</ref>

[[Four occupations|Merchants and peasant farmers]] paid property taxes and poll taxes in coin cash and the land tax with a portion of their crop yield.<ref name="nishijima 1986 600"/> Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade wares at urban markets.<ref name="ref name="nishijima 1986 600 601">Nishijima (1986), 600<U+2013>601.</ref> The Han government may have found collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary.<ref name="nishijima 1986 601">Nishijima (1986), 601.</ref>

From 118 BCE to 5 CE, the government minted over 28,000,000,000 coins, with an annual average of 220,000,000 coins minted (or 220,000 strings of 1,000 coins).<ref name="nishijima 1986 588">Nishijima (1986), 588.</ref> In comparison, the [[Chinese era name|Tianbao period]] (<U+5929><U+5BF6>) (742<U+2013>755 CE) of the Tang Dynasty produced 327,000,000 coins every year while 3,000,000,000 coins in 1045 CE and 5,860,000,000 coins in 1080 CE were made in the [[Economy of the Song Dynasty|Song Dynasty]] (960<U+2013>1279 CE).<ref name="nishijima 1986 588"/> Coin cash became the common measure of wealth during Eastern Han, as many wages were paid solely in cash.<ref name="ebrey 1986 612 613">Ebrey (1986), 612<U+2013>613.</ref> Diwu Lun (<U+7B2C><U+4E94><U+502B>) (fl. 40-85 CE), Governor of Shu Province (modern [[Sichuan]]), described his subordinate officials' wealth not in terms of landholdings, but in the form of aggregate properties worth approximately 10,000,000 coin cash.<ref name="ebrey 1986 612">Ebrey (1986), 612.</ref> Commercial transactions involving hundreds of thousands of coins were commonplace.<ref name="ebrey 1986 612"/> 

[[Angus Maddison]] estimates that the country's [[gross domestic product]] was equivalent to $450 per head in 1990 [[United States dollar]]s<U+2014>a sum that was above subsistence level, and which did not significantly change until the beginning of the Song Dynasty in the late 10th century.<ref name="maddison 2001 259">Maddison (2001), 259.</ref> The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners.

Though requiring additional revenue to fund the [[Sino-Xiongnu War]], the government during [[Emperor Wu of Han]]'s reign (141<U+2013>87 BCE) sought to avoid heavy taxation of small landowners. To increase revenue, the government imposed heavier taxes on merchants, confiscated land from nobles, sold offices and titles, and established government [[monopoly|monopolies]] over the minting of coins, [[History of ferrous metallurgy|iron manufacture]] and salt mining.<ref name="ebrey 1999 75"/> New taxes were imposed on the ownership of boats, carts, carriages, wheelbarrows, shops and other properties. The overall property tax for merchants was raised in 119 BCE from 120 coins for every 10,000 coins-worth of property owned to 120 coins for every 2,000 coins-worth of property owned.<ref>Ebrey (1999), 75; Nishijima (1986), 599.</ref> Tax rates for almost all commodities are unknown, except for that of [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|liquor]]. After the government monopoly on liquor was abolished in 81 BCE, a property tax of 2 coins for every 0.2 L (0.05 gallons) was levied on liquor merchants.<ref name="nishijima 1986 600">Nishijima (1986), 600.</ref> 

The sale of certain offices and titles was reintroduced in Eastern Han by [[Empress Deng Sui|Empress Dowager Deng Sui]]<U+2014>who reigned as [[regent]] from 105<U+2013>121 CE<U+2014>to raise government revenues in times of severe natural disasters and the widespread rebellion of the [[Qiang people]] in [[western China]].<ref name="de crespigny 2007 126 127">de Crespigny (2007), 126<U+2013>127.</ref> The sale of offices became extremely corrupt under the [[eunuch]]-dominated government of [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168<U+2013>189 CE), when many top official posts were sold at the highest bidder instead of being filled by vetted candidates who had taken [[Imperial examinations]] or attended the [[Taixue|Imperial University]].<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 126<U+2013>127; Kramers (1986), 754<U+2013>756; Ebrey (1999), 77<U+2013>78.</ref>

===Conscription===
{{see|Government of the Han Dynasty|Corv<U+00E9>e}}
[[File:Nswag, dinastia han, cavallo e cavaliere.JPG|thumb|upright|A Han tomb pottery cavalry figurine]]
Two forms of mass [[conscription]] existed during the Han period. These were civilian conscription (''gengzu'' <U+66F4><U+5352>) and military conscription (''zhengzu'' <U+6B63><U+5352>). In addition to paying their monetary and crop taxes, all peasants of the Western Han period aged between fifteen and fifty-six were required to undertake mandatory conscription duties for one month of each year. These duties were usually fulfilled by work on construction projects.<ref name="nishijima 1986 599">Nishijima (1986), 599.</ref> 

At the age of twenty-three years male peasants were drafted to serve in the military, where they were assigned to [[infantry]], [[Horses in East Asian warfare|cavalry]], or [[Naval history of China|navy]] service.<ref name="nishijima 1986 599"/> After one year of training, they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city.<ref name="nishijima 1986 599"/> They remained liable to perform this year of service until the age of fifty-six.<ref name="nishijima 1986 599"/> This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local [[militia]]s, which they could join once they had finished their year of conscripted service.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 114.</ref> These non-professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army (''Nanjun'' <U+5357><U+8ECD>), while the Northern Army (''Beijun'' <U+5317><U+8ECD>) was a [[standing army]] composed of paid career soldiers.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 114<U+2013>115.</ref>

During the Eastern Han, peasants could avoid the month of annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in commutation (''gengfu'' <U+66F4><U+8CE6>). This development went hand-in-hand with the increasing use of hired labor by the government.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 564<U+2013>565; Ebrey (1986), 613.</ref> In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 564 565">de Crespigny (2007), 564<U+2013>565.</ref>

===Merchants===
[[File:Gold animals.JPG|thumb|[[Gilding|Gilded]] bronze animal figurines from the Han Dynasty, including a horse, elephant, cow, and unicorn]]

There were two categories of Han merchants: those who sold goods at shops in urban markets, and the larger-scale itinerant traders who traveled between cities and to foreign countries.<ref name="nishijima 1986 576">Nishijima (1986), 576.</ref> The small-scale urban shopkeepers were enrolled on an official register and had to pay heavy commercial taxes.<ref name="nishijima 1986 576"/> Although these registered merchants were taxed, an edict of 94 CE ordered that landless peasants who had to resort to peddling were to be exempted from taxation.<ref name="ebrey 1986 620 621"/> 

Itinerant merchants were often wealthy and did not have to register.<ref name="nishijima 1986 576"/> These itinerant merchants often participated in large-scale trade with powerful families and officials.<ref name="nishijima 1986 576"/> Nishijima writes that most of the biographies of "wealthy men" in the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and ''[[Book of Han]]'' were those of itinerant merchants.<ref name="nishijima 1986 576"/> 

In contrast, registered marketplace merchants had a very low social status and were often subject to additional restrictions.<ref name="nishijima 1986 577 hucker 1975 187">Nishijima (1986), 577; see also Hucker (1975), 187.</ref> Emperor Gaozu passed laws levying higher taxes, forbidding merchants from wearing silk, and barring their descendants from holding [[Civil service|public office]]. These laws were difficult to enforce.<ref name="nishijima 1986 577 hucker 1975 187"/> Emperor Wu targeted both the registered and unregistered merchants with higher taxes. While registered merchants were not allowed to own land, if they broke this law their land and slaves would be confiscated.<ref name="nishijima 1986 577 hucker 1975 187"/> However, wealthy unregistered merchants owned large tracts of land.<ref>Ch'<U+00FC> (1972), 113<U+2013>114; see also Hucker (1975), 187.</ref> Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the marketplace, where he set up government-managed shops that sold commodities collected from the merchants as property taxes.<ref name="ebrey 1999 75"/>

===Private manufacture and government monopolies===

[[File:Pottery gristmill.JPG|thumb|right|A miniature ceramic model of a [[gristmill]] from a Han tomb]]

====Iron and salt====
At the beginning of the Han Dynasty, China's salt and iron enterprises were privately owned by a number of wealthy merchants and [[Kings of the Han Dynasty|subordinate regional kings]]. The profits of these industries rivaled the funds of the imperial court.<ref name="nishijima 1986 583 584">Nishijima (1986), 583<U+2013>584.</ref> A successful iron or salt industrialist might have employed over a thousand peasants, causing a severe loss of agricultural tax revenue to the central government.<ref>Nishijima (1986), 584; Needham (1965), 22.</ref> To restrict the power of the industrialists, Emperor Wu had [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the salt and iron industries by 117 BCE.<ref>Ebrey (1999) 75; Hinsch (2002), 21<U+2013>22; Wagner (2001), 1<U+2013>2.</ref> 

The government also instituted a liquor monopoly in 98 BCE, but repealed it in 81 BCE in an effort to reduce government intervention in the private economy.<ref name="wagner 2001 13 14">Wagner (2001), 13<U+2013>14.</ref> 

The Reformist Party supported privatization, opposing the Modernist Party, which had dominated politics during the reign of Emperor Wu and the subsequent [[regent|regency]] of [[Huo Guang]] (d. 68 BCE).<ref name="loewe 1986 187 206">Loewe (1986), 187<U+2013>206.</ref> The Modernists argued that state monopolies provided abundant raw materials, good working conditions, and high quality iron; the Reformists countered that state-owned ironworks produced large and impractical implements designed to meet [[quota share|quota]]s rather than to be of practical use, were of inferior quality, and were too expensive for commoners to purchase.<ref>Wagner (2001), 56<U+2013>57.</ref> In 44 BCE, the Reformists had both the salt and iron monopolies abolished, but the monopolies were reinstated in 41 BCE after their abrupt closure resulted in significant losses of revenue for the government and disruption of the private economy.<ref name="wagner 2001 15">Wagner (2001), 15.</ref> 

Wang Mang preserved these central government monopolies. When Eastern Han began, they were once again repealed, the industries given to local commandery governments and private entrepreneurs.<ref>Wagner (2001), 15<U+2013>17; Nishijima (1986), 584.</ref> [[Emperor Zhang of Han]] (r. 75<U+2013>88 CE) briefly reintroduced the central government monopolies on salt and iron from 85 to 88 CE, but abolished them in the last year of his reign. After Emperor Zhang, the Han never returned the salt and iron industries to government ownership.<ref>Wagner (2001), 17; see also Hucker (1975), 190.</ref>

[[File:Earthenware architecture models, Eastern Han Dynasty, 6.JPG|thumb|left|An Eastern-Han glazed ceramic model of a furnace]]

====Grain====

The grain trade was a profitable private enterprise during the early Western Han, yet Emperor Wu's government intervened in the grain trade when it established the ''equable marketing system'' (also known as the ''ever-normal granary system'') in 110 BCE.<ref>Ebrey (1999), 75; Wagner (2001), 13; Hucker (1975), 188<U+2013>189.</ref> The government purchased grain when it was plentiful and inexpensive, shipping it to granaries for storage or to areas where grain was scarce.<ref name="ebrey 1999 75 hucker 1975 189">Ebrey (1999), 75; Hucker (1975), 189.</ref> The system was intended to eliminate grain speculation, to create a standard price and to increase government revenue.<ref name="ebrey 1999 75 hucker 1975 189"/> The system was designed by civil servant [[Sang Hongyang]] (d. 80 BCE)<U+2014>who was previously a merchant. Sang Hongyang was criticized by merchants for placing government officials in market stalls.<ref>Wagner (2001), 13; Hucker (1975), 189.</ref> This supply system was discontinued in Eastern Han, although it was briefly revived by [[Emperor Ming of Han]] (r. 57<U+2013>75). Emperor Ming also abolished the system in 68 CE, when he believed that the government's storage of grain increased prices and made wealthy landowners richer.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 605">de Crespigny (2007), 605.</ref> 

Ebrey argues that although most of Emperor Wu's fiscal policies were repealed during Eastern Han, their damage to the merchant class and the subsequent [[laissez-faire]] policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society, ensuring that China's economy would remain firmly agrarian-based for centuries.<ref name="ebrey 1999 75"/> The Eastern Han central government lost an important source of revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies' swords and shields from private manufacturers. However, this loss of revenue was often compensated by higher taxes levied on the merchants.<ref name="ebrey 1986 609">Ebrey (1986), 609.</ref>

===Government workshops===
{{see|Government of the Han Dynasty}}
[[File:Eastern Han bronze mirror.jpg|thumb|The reverse, decorated side of an Eastern-Han [[TLV mirror|bronze mirror]] with feline heads in a scalloped field; the mirror is inscribed with the date of manufacture (174 CE)]]

Han government workshops produced common, luxury, and even artistic funerary items, such as the ceramic figurines and tomb tiles which adorned the walls of underground tombs.<ref>Bower (2005), 242; Ruitenbeek (2005), 253; Steinhardt (2005), 278.</ref> Imperial workshops were operated by the Minister Steward, whose ministry controlled the treasury and the emperor's private finances.<ref name="nishijima 1986 581">Nishijima (1986), 581.</ref>

The ''Office of Arts and Crafts'', subordinate to the Minister Steward, produced weapons, [[TLV mirror|bronze mirrors]], vessel wares, and other goods.<ref name="nishijima 1986 581"/> ''The Office of Manufactures'', also subordinate to the Minister Steward, made the cheaper weapons, utensils, and [[Chinese armour|armor]].<ref name="nishijima 1986 581"/> Textiles and [[Han Chinese clothing|clothing]] worn by the emperor and royal family were made in the ''Weaving House of the West'' and ''Weaving House of the East''; the latter was abolished in 28 BCE, and the ''Weaving House of the West'' was renamed the ''Weaving House''.<ref name="nishijima 1986 581"/> 

Workshops located in the commanderies made silks and embroidered fabrics, silver and gold luxury items, and weapons. One workshop, in modern [[Anhui]] province, had a shipyard where battle ships were built.<ref name="nishijima 1986 582">Nishijima (1986), 582.</ref> Although the government used the labor of state-owned slaves, corv<U+00E9>e laborers, and convicts in its workshops, they also hired [[Master craftsman|skilled craftsmen]] who were well-paid.<ref name="nishijima 1986 583">Nishijima (1986), 583.</ref>

Han [[lacquerware]]s were privately made as well as being manufactured in government workshops.<ref>Wang (1982), 84<U+2013>85; Nishijima (1986), 582.</ref> Hundreds of laborers could be employed to work on a single luxury item, such as a [[lacquer]]ed cup or screen.<ref name="wang 1982 83">Wang (1982), 83.</ref> Some lacquerwares were inscribed simply with the [[Chinese surname|clan name]] of the family who owned them. Others were inscribed with the titles of the owner, the specific type of the vessels, their capacities, the precise day, month, and year of manufacture (according to [[Chinese era name]]s and their [[Chinese calendar|lunisolar calendar]]), the names of the floor managers who oversaw the items' production and the names of the workers who made them.<ref name="wang 1982 84 85">Wang (1982), 84<U+2013>85.</ref> Even some iron implements made during the age of the monopoly bore inscriptions of the date they were made and the name of the workshop.<ref name="wang 1982 125">Wang (1982), 125.</ref> Bronze Han Dynasty calipers, used for minute measurements, also carry an inscription of the day, month, and year of manufacture.<ref name="temple 1986 86 87">Temple (1986), 86<U+2013>87.</ref> Han lacquerwares bearing the [[Seal (East Asia)|imperial mark]] of the emperor have been found far beyond the Han capital regions by modern archaeologists, in places such as [[Qingzhen]] (in [[Guizhou]]), [[Pyongyang]] (in [[North Korea]]), and [[Noin-Ula kurgans|Noin Ula]] (in [[Mongolia]]).<ref name="wang 1982 86 87">Wang (1982), 86<U+2013>87.</ref>

===Public construction projects===

The Court Architect was charged by central government with overseeing all [[Chinese architecture|imperial construction and public works projects]], including the building of palaces and tombs.<ref name="nishijima 1986 581 582">Nishijima (1986), 581<U+2013>582.</ref>

During the Western Han period, conscripted peasants were organized into work teams consisting of over a hundred thousand laborers. About 150,000 conscripted workers, serving in consecutive periods of thirty days each over a total of five years, worked on the massive defensive walls of Chang'an, which were completed in 190 BCE.<ref name="loewe 1986 130 131">Loewe (1986), 130<U+2013>131.</ref> Conscript laborers were commissioned to build and maintain shrines dedicated to various [[Chinese folk religion|deities]] and the [[Ancestor worship|spirits of the emperor's ancestors]].<ref>Loewe (1986), 130<U+2013>131, 207<U+2013>209.</ref> Conscripts also maintained canal systems used for agricultural transport and irrigation.<ref name="wang 1982 55 56">Wang (1982), 55<U+2013>56.</ref> Some of the larger Han canal renovation projects included repairs to the [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System]] and [[Zhengguo Canal]], built by the previous State of Qin and [[Qin Dynasty]] (221<U+2013>206 BCE), respectively.<ref name="wang 1982 55 56"/> 

Nineteen stone inscriptions survive commemorating the building of new roads and bridges by the Eastern Han government.<ref name="ebrey 1986 613 614"/> Archaeological excavations at Chang'an show that wooden bridges were built over the defensive moat and led to the gatehouses.<ref name="wang 1982 2">Wang (1982), 2.</ref> Roadways also needed periodic repairs; in 63 CE the route leading from the [[Qilian Mountains]], through [[Hanzhong]] (modern southern [[Shanxi]]), and towards the capital Luoyang underwent major repairs.<ref name="ebrey 1986 613 614">Ebrey (1986), 613<U+2013>614.</ref> For this project, 623 [[trestle]] bridges, five large bridges, 107&nbsp;km (66 mi) of new roadways, and 64 buildings<U+2014>including [[Inn|rest houses]], [[mail|post stations]], and [[courier|relay stations]]<U+2014>were built.<ref name="ebrey 1986 613 614"/> Those commissioned with military authority also built bridges. For example, during his [[Sino-Xiongnu War|campaign against the Xiongnu]] in the [[Ordos Desert]] in 127 BCE, the general [[Wei Qing]] (d. 106 BCE) had a new bridge built over the Wujia River (a former tributary of the [[Yellow River]]) in today's [[Inner Mongolia]]. He used this bridge to move troops and supplies for an attack on the Xiongnu, northwest of modern Wuyuan County (<U+4E94><U+539F><U+53BF>).<ref name="di cosmo 2002 238">Di Cosmo (2002), 238.</ref> Ebrey writes:<ref name="ebrey 1986 614"/>

<blockquote>There were, of course, numerous reasons for maintaining roads. A unified political system could be maintained only as long as the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, troops, or messengers as needed. Such a system of transportation, once established, facilitated commerce. At the local level, road and bridge projects seem to have been initiated as much for the sake of traveling merchants as for officials.<ref name="ebrey 1986 614">Ebrey (1986), 614.</ref></blockquote>

==Domestic trade==
=== Traded goods and commodities===
[[File:Lacquerware bowl, Western Han Dynasty.JPG|thumb|right|A red-and-black [[lacquerware]] bowl from the Western Han Era, dated 2nd century BCE]]

Han-era historians like [[Sima Qian]] (145<U+2013>86 BCE) and [[Ban Gu]] (32<U+2013>92 CE), as well as the later historian [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] (398<U+2013>445 CE), recorded details of the business transactions and products traded by Han merchants. Evidence of these products has also emerged from archaeological investigations.

The main agricultural staple foods during the Han Dynasty were foxtail millet, proso millet, rice (including glutinous rice), wheat, beans, and barley.<ref name="wang 1982 52">Wang (1982), 52.</ref> Other food items included sorghum, taro, mallow, mustard plant, jujube, pear, plum (including ''[[prunus salicina]]'' and ''[[Prunus mume]]''), peach, apricot, and [[myrica]].<ref name="wang 1982 53">Wang (1982), 53.</ref> Chicken, duck, goose, beef, pork, rabbit, [[sika deer]], turtle dove, owl, [[Chinese Bamboo Partridge]], magpie, common pheasant, crane, and various types of fish were commonly consumed meats.<ref name="wang 1982 57 203">Wang (1982), 57 & 203.</ref> 

The production of silk through [[sericulture]] was profitable for both small-time farmers and large-scale producers. Silk clothing was too expensive for the poor, who wore clothes most commonly made of hemp.<ref>Wang (1982), 53 & 58.</ref> The rural women usually wove all the family's clothes.<ref>Nishijima (1986), 585; Hinsch (2002), 59<U+2013>60 & 65.</ref> 

Common bronze items included domestic wares like oil lamps, incense burners, tables, irons, stoves, and dripping jars. Iron goods were often used for construction and farmwork, such as plowshares, pickaxes, spades, shovels, hoes, sickles, axes, [[adze]], hammers, chisels, knives, saws, [[scratch awl]]s, and nails.<ref>Wang (1982), 103 & 122.</ref> Iron was also used to make [[Chinese swords|swords]], [[ji (halberd)|halberds]], arrowheads and [[scale armor]] for the military.<ref>Wang (1982), 123.</ref>

[[File:Pottery dogs, Han Dynasty.JPG|thumb|left|Although dog meat was eaten during the Han, [[Dogs in ancient China|dogs]] were also domesticated as pets;<ref name="wang 1982 57 203"/> these two Han tomb pottery dogs are wearing decorative [[dog collar]]s.]]

Liquor, pickles and sauces, cattle hide, sheep and pigs, grain, boat timber, bamboo poles, light two-wheeled carts, heavy oxcarts, lacquerware, bronze utensils and chopsticks, silver, wood and iron vessels, dyes, horses, horns, cinnabar, silk fabrics, fine and coarse cloth, raw lacquer, yeast for fermentation, bean relish, dried fish and abalone, dates, chestnuts, sable and foxskin garments, felt and mats, fruits and vegetables, jade, amber, deerskin slippers, ceramic wares and art, and funerary coffins made of catalpa, [[Robinia pseudoacacia|locust]], juniper, and lacquered-wood were other common goods.<ref>Nishijima (1986), 578<U+2013>579; Ebrey (1986), 609<U+2013>611.</ref> 

In addition to general commodities, Han historians list the goods of specific regions. Common trade items from the region of modern [[Shanxi]] included bamboo, timber, grain, and gemstones; [[Shandong]] had fish, salt, liquor, and silk; [[Jiangnan]] had [[camphor]], catalpa, ginger, cinnamon, gold, tin, lead, cinnabar, rhinoceros horn, tortoise shell, pearls, ivory, and leather.<ref name="nishijima 1986 578 579">Nishijima (1986), 578<U+2013>579.</ref> Ebrey lists items found in a 2nd century CE tomb in [[Wuwei, Gansu]] (along the [[Hexi Corridor]] fortified by the [[Great Wall of China]]), evidence that luxury items could be obtained even in remote frontiers.<ref name="ebrey 1986 611 612">Ebrey (1986), 611<U+2013>612.</ref>

<blockquote>...&nbsp;fourteen pieces of pottery; wooden objects such as a horse, pig, ox, chicken, chicken coop, and a single-horned animal; seventy copper cash; a crossbow mechanism made of bronze; a writing brush; a lacquer-encased inkstone; a lacquer tray and bowl; a wooden comb; a jade ornament; a pair of hemp shoes; a straw bag; the remains of an inscribed banner; a bamboo hairpin; two straw satchels; and a stone lamp.<ref name="ebrey 1986 611 612"/></blockquote>

In the early Eastern Han, Emperor Ming passed laws which prohibited those involved in agriculture from simultaneously engaging in mercantile trade.<ref name="ebrey 1986 615">Ebrey (1986), 615.</ref> These laws were largely ineffective, since wealthy landowners and landlords made significant profits from the trading of goods produced on their estates.<ref name="ebrey 1986 615"/> Cui Shi (<U+50AC><U+5BD4>) (d. 170 CE), a local commandery administrator who later served as an official in the central government's secretariat, started a winery business in his home to pay for his father's funeral.

There was mass unemployment among landless peasants during the Eastern Han period. However, archaeological and literary evidence shows that those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived comfortably.<ref name="ebrey 1986 622 626">Ebrey (1986), 622<U+2013>626.</ref> In addition to Cui's work, the [[List of Chinese inventions|inventor]], [[Chinese mathematics|mathematician]], and [[Chinese astronomy|court astronomer]] [[Zhang Heng]] (78<U+2013>139 CE) wrote a [[Fu (poetry)|rhapsody]] describing the rich countryside of [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] and its [[Paddy field|irrigated rice paddies]]. He mentions grain fields, ponds filled with fish, and [[Chinese garden|estate gardens]] and orchards filled with bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, [[perilla]], [[Tetradium|evodia]], and purple ginger.<ref>Ebrey (1986), 624; Knechtges (1997), 232.</ref> 

Bricks lining the walls of the tombs of wealthy Han were adorned with carved or molded reliefs and painted murals; these often showed scenes of the tomb occupant's estate, halls, wells, carriage sheds, pens for cattle, sheep, chickens, and pigs, stables for horses, and employed workers picking [[Morus (plant)|mulberry leaves]], plowing crop fields, and hoeing vegetable patches.<ref name="ebrey 1986 622 623">Ebrey (1986), 622<U+2013>623.</ref>

Small and medium-sized estates were managed by single families. The father acted as the head manager, the sons as field workers. Wives and daughters worked with female servants to weave cloth and produce silk.<ref name="ebrey 1986 626">Ebrey (1986), 626.</ref> Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a [[sharecropping]] system to similar to the government's system for state-owned lands. Under this system, peasants would receive land, tools, oxen, and a house in exchange for a third or a half of their crop yield.<ref name="ebrey 1986 625 626">Ebrey (1986), 625<U+2013>626.</ref>

Prior to the Han Dynasty, markets close to China's northern border engaged in trade with the nomadic tribes of the eastern [[Eurasian Steppe]].<ref name="liu 1988 14">Liu (1988), 14.</ref> The [[heqin]] agreement between the Han and nomadic [[Xiongnu]] stipulated the transfer of tributary goods from China. The exact amount of annual tribute sent to the Xiongnu in the 2nd century BCE is unknown. In 89 BCE, when Hulugu Shanyu (<U+72D0><U+9E7F><U+59D1>) (r. 95<U+2013>85 BCE) requested a renewal of the heqin agreement, he demanded an annual tribute of 400,000 litres (11,350 U.S. bu) of wine, 100,000 litres (2,840 U.S. bu) of grain, and 10,000 bales of silk.<ref>Yu (1986) 397.</ref><ref>''[[Book of Han]]'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a02/094a.htm vol. 94a].</ref> These amounts of wine, grain, and silk were considered to be a significant increase from earlier amounts of tribute, which must have been much less.<ref>Y<U+00FC> (1986), 397.</ref> Besides these arrangements, the most common commercial exchanges between the [[Xiongnu]] and Han merchants consisted of the trading of Xiongnu horses and [[Fur clothing|furs]] for Han agricultural foodstuffs and luxury items, most notably silk.<ref name="liu 1988 14"/> By means of the [[black market]], the Xiongnu were also able to smuggle Han [[History of ferrous metallurgy|iron weapons]] across the border.<ref name="liu 1988 14"/>

The Han established a diplomatic presence in the [[Tarim Basin]] of [[Central Asia]] during [[Emperor Wu of Han]]'s reign (141<U+2013>87 BCE). Han envoys brought gifts of sheep, gold, and silk to the urban oasis city-states.<ref name="liu 1988 14"/> The Chinese sometimes used gold as currency; however, silk was favored as a means to pay for food and lodging.<ref name="liu 1988 14"/> Once the Han had subjugated the Tarim Basin and [[Protectorate of the Western Regions|established a Protectorate there]], Han envoys in these states were given free food and lodging. These envoys were required to send tributary items of furs, precious stones, and delicacies such as Central Asian raisins to the Han court.<ref name="liu 1988 14"/> The [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid Parthian]] court of [[Persia]] sent exotic animals including lions and ostriches to the Han court, and a king ruling in what is now [[Burma]] sent elephants and rhinoceroses.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 497 591">de Crespigny (2007), 497<U+2013>591.</ref> Han diplomatic missions to royal courts across Asia were usually accompanied by trade caravans which earned substantial profits.<ref name="torday 114 117">Torday (1997), 114<U+2013>117.</ref> 

The Han court received tributary submission from the Xiongnu [[shanyu|leader]] Huhanye (<U+547C><U+97D3><U+90AA>) (r. 58<U+2013>31 BCE), an important rival to [[Zhizhi Shanyu]] (r. 56<U+2013>36 BCE, died at the [[Battle of Zhizhi]]). Huhanye's tribute, exchange of hostages, and presence at Chang'an in the [[Chinese New Year|New Year]] of 51 BCE were rewarded with the following gifts from the emperor: 5&nbsp;kg (160 [[troy ounce|oz t]]) of gold, 200,000 coins, 77 suits of clothes, 8,000 bales of silk fabric, 1,500&nbsp;kg (3,300 lb) of silk floss, 15 horses, and 680,000 L (19,300 [[U.S. bushel|U.S. bu]]) of grain.<ref>Y<U+00FC> (1986), 395<U+2013>396; Loewe (1986), 196<U+2013>197.</ref> Compare to the 110 silk fabric offered by [[Emperor Wen of Han]] in 174, the homepage gift was dramatic increased after Huhanye submission.<ref>''[[Book of Han]]'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a02/094a.htm vol. 94a].</ref> As shown in the table below, based upon Y<U+00FC> Ying-shih's 1986 work, "Han Foreign Relations", the Xiongnu leader's political submission was guaranteed only for as long as the Han could provide him with ever greater amounts of imperial largesse with each succeeding visit to the Chinese court.<ref name="y<U+00FC> 1986 396 397"/>

The establishment of the [[Silk Road]] occurred during Wu's reign, owing to the efforts of the diplomat [[Zhang Qian]]. The increased demand for silk from the [[Roman Empire]] stimulated commercial traffic in both Central Asia and across the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Roman commerce|Roman merchants]] sailed to [[Barbarikon]] near present-day [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bharuch|Barygaza]] in present-day [[Gujarat]], [[India]] to purchase Chinese silks (see [[Roman trade with India]]).<ref name="liu 1988 19">Liu (1988), 19.</ref> When Emperor Wu conquered [[Nanyue]]<U+2014>in what is now [[Southwest China]] and [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern Vietnam]]<U+2014>in 111 BCE, overseas trade was extended to [[Southeast Asia]] and the Indian Ocean, as maritime merchants traded Han gold and silk for pearls, jade, lapis lazuli, and glasswares.<ref name="nishijima 1986 579 580">Nishijima (1986), 579<U+2013>580.</ref> 

The [[Book of Later Han]] states that Roman envoys sent by Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (r. 161<U+2013>180 CE), following a southern route, brought gifts to the court of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146<U+2013>168 CE) in 166 CE.<ref>Liu (1988), 19; de Crespigny (2007), 600; Nishijima (1986), 579<U+2013>580"</ref> This Roman mission followed an unsuccessful attempt by the Han diplomat [[Gan Ying]] to reach [[Rome]] in 97. Gan Ying was delayed in [[Anxi (Parthia)|Anxi]], near the [[Persian Gulf]], by Arsacid [[Parthia]]n authorities, and could only make a report on Rome based on oral accounts.<ref name="nishijima 1986 579">Nishijima (1986), 579.</ref><ref>de Crespigny (2007), 239<U+2013>240.</ref><ref>Y<U+00FC> (1986), 460<U+2013>461.</ref> Historians [[Charles Hucker]] and [[Rafe de Crespigny]] both speculate that the Roman mission of 166 CE involved enterprising Roman merchants instead of actual diplomats;<ref>Hucker (1975), 191; de Crespigny (2007), 600.</ref> Hucker writes:<ref name="hucker 1975 191"/>

<blockquote>Tributary missions from vassal states were commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities to do business in the capital markets. No doubt a large proportion of what the Chinese court chose to call tributary missions were in fact shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no diplomatic status at all. This was unquestionably the case, most notably, with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 A.D. claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.<ref name="hucker 1975 191">Hucker (1975), 191.</ref></blockquote>

The main trade route leading into Han China passed first through [[Kashgar]], yet [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenized]] [[Bactria]] further west was the central node of international trade.<ref name="liu 1988 26">Liu (1988), 26.</ref> By the 1st century CE, Bactria and much of Central Asia and [[North India]] were controlled by the [[Kushan Empire]].<ref>Liu (1988), 26<U+2013>29.</ref> Silk was the main export item from China to [[India]]. [[Economic history of India|Indian merchants]] brought various goods to China, including tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, fine cloth, woolen textiles, perfume and incense, crystal sugar, pepper, ginger, salt, coral, pearls, glass items, and Roman wares.<ref>Liu (1988), 52<U+2013>53, 64<U+2013>65.</ref> Indian merchants brought Roman [[styrax]] and [[frankincense]] to China, while the Chinese knew [[bdellium]] as a fragrant item from Persia, although it was native to [[West India]].<ref name="liu 1988 63">Liu (1988), 63.</ref> The tall [[Ferghana horse]]s imported from [[Fergana]] were highly prized in Han China.<ref name="liu 1988 53">Liu (1988), 53.</ref> The newly introduced exotic Central Asian [[grape]]s (i.e. ''[[vitis vinifera]]'') were used to make [[Wine in China|grape wine]], although the Chinese had [[rice wine]] before this.<ref name="gernet 1962 134 135">Gernet (1962), 134<U+2013>135.</ref><ref>Temple (1986), 101.</ref> [[Glass]] luxury items from ancient [[Mesopotamia]] have been found in Chinese tombs and dated to the late [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (771<U+2013>476 BCE).
