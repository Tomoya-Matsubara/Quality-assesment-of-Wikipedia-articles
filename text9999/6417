'''Cindy Lou Hensley McCain''' (born May 20, 1954) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[businessperson|businesswoman]], and [[philanthropist]], and the wife of [[United States Senator]] and 2000 and 2008 [[presidential candidate]] [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]]. 

She was born and raised in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] as the daughter of wealthy beer distributor [[Jim Hensley]].  After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees from the [[University of Southern California]], she became a [[special education]] teacher.  She married John McCain in 1980 and they had three children together as well as adopting another.  From 1988 to 1995 she founded and ran a non-profit organization, the American Voluntary Medical Team, that organized trips by medical personnel to disaster-struck or war-torn third-world areas.  During this time she became addicted to painkillers for several years and resorted to having a physician write illegal prescriptions; she reached an agreement with the government in which no charges were filed against her.

Upon her father's death in 2000, she inherited majority control and became [[Chair (official)|chair]] of [[Hensley & Co.]], one of the largest [[Anheuser-Busch]] beer distributors in the United States.  She participated in both of her husband's presidential campaigns and in 2008 drew both positive and negative scrutiny for her appearance, demeanor, wealth, spending habits, and financial obligations.  She continues to be an active philanthropist and serves on the boards of [[Operation Smile]], [[CARE (relief)|CARE]] and [[HALO Trust]], frequently making overseas trips in conjunction with their activities.
