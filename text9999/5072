'''Charles Shane Robinson''' (born [[July 2]], [[1964]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling]] [[referee]]  referee currently signed to World Wrestling Entertainment, officiating on the SmackDown! brand.
                                                                      


==History==                                                        
While growing up, Robinson studied [[National Wrestling Alliance]] referee [[Tommy Young]] in order to hone his mannerisms as a referee. His professional wrestling career began when he joined the Pro Wrestling Federation as a [[photographer]] in 1993, supplementing his income by working as a [[sales]]man. In 1996, Robinson became a referee.

Robinson repeatedly petitioned the [[World Championship Wrestling]] [[professional wrestling promotion]] for a job, and in 1998 he was given a tryout match, refeering a [[dark match|dark]] bout between [[Chris Taylor (professional wrestler)|Chris Taylor]] and a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]]. Following the match, Robinson was signed to a contract by WCW.

Robinson refereed the Bill Goldberg - Hollywood Hulk Hogan match for the WCW Heavyweight Championship on WCW Monday Night Nitro from the Georgia Dome on July 6, 1998, where Goldberg defeated Hogan to win the title and also remain undefeated at (then) 108-0.

In 1999, Robinson became the [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] referee of the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]], aligning himself with his childhood idol, [[Ric Flair]]. Robinson frequently favored the Horsemen in the matches he officiated, enraging [[Randy Savage]]. Savage, who had been suspended by Flair (then the [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling|WCW President]]), proposed a match between his girlfriend, [[Stephanie Bellars|Gorgeous George]], and Robinson, with Savage to be reinstated if George defeated Robinson. The match, which marked Robinson's wrestling debut, took place at [[Slamboree#1999|Slamboree 1999]] on [[May 9]], [[1999]]. Robinson, dubbed "'''Little Naitch'''" (a reference to Flair's nickname, the "Nature Boy"), came to the ring in a robe similar to those worn by Flair, and mimicked Flair's mannerisms, signature strut and "wooo" catchphrase. Robinson emulated Flair throughout the match, using Flair's customary illegal tactics, but was defeated by George, who pinned him following a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|diving elbow drop]]. Robinson wrestled his second match one week later, teaming with Flair to face Randy Savage and [[Debra Miceli|Madusa]] on an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''. In the course of the match, Savage delivered a [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] diving elbow drop to Robinson, cracking several of his [[vertebra]]e and [[Pneumothorax|collapsing his lung]]. After undergoing treatment, Robinson returned to WCW television several weeks later, and was appointed Vice President of WCW by Flair. Flair and Robinson ruled WCW until they were unseated by [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], with Robinson returning to his refereeing duties.

In 2000, Robinson appeared in the WCW-produced film "''[[Ready to Rumble]]''".

When WCW was purchased by the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] in [[March 2001]], Robinson was hired by the WWF. He debuted in the WWF as a member of [[The Alliance]], bickering with WWF loyalist referee [[Jack Doan]] and accompanying senior WCW official [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]] to ringside for his match at [[WWF Invasion]] on [[July 22]], [[2001]]. He refereed his first WWF match on [[July 2]], [[2001]].

In 2002, the WWF was renamed "World Wrestling Entertainment", and the roster was divided between two "brands", [[WWE RAW|''RAW'']] and [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|''SmackDown!'']]. Robinson was initially assigned to ''RAW'', but was later traded to ''SmackDown!'', where he refereed many women's matches. On the [[July 1]], [[2004]] episode of ''SmackDown!'', Robinson was forced to wrestle [[Matt Wiese|Luther Reigns]] by [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling|General Manager]] [[Kurt Angle]].  However, the match was quickly stopped by [[Charlie Haas]].

At [[WWE No Mercy#2006|No Mercy 2006]], Robinson, who had refereed a match between [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Mr. Kennedy]] and [[The Undertaker]], was on the end of a [[Tombstone Piledriver]] from the Undertaker after he had called for him to be disqualified after hitting Mr. Kennedy with his United States title belt. Robinson also officiated the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] matches at both [[WrestleMania 22]] and [[WrestleMania 23]].
