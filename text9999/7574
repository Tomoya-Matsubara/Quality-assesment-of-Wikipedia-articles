== History ==
{{main|History of the euro}}
The euro was set up on the 1<sup>st</sup> of January 1999, when it became the currency of over 300 million people in Europe. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/intro/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Introduction|publisher=ECB|work=ECB}}</ref> For the first three years of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountance. Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the banknotes and coins of the 12, as it was then, national currencies like the [[Irish Pound]] and the [[Austrian schilling]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/intro/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Introduction|publisher=ECB|work=ECB}}</ref>

Legally, both the European Central Bank and the central banks of the [[eurozone]] countries have the right to issue the 7 different euro banknotes. In practice, only the national central banks of the zone physically issue and withdraw euro banknotes. The European Central Bank does not have a cash office and is not involved in any cash operations. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/intro/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Introduction|publisher=ECB|work=ECB}}</ref>

==Design==
The five hundred euro note measures 160 <U+00D7> 82&nbsp;mm and has a purple colour scheme. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Banknotes|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref> All bank notes depict bridges and arches or doorways in different historical European styles; the five hundred euro note shows [[modern architecture]] (between the 20th and 21st century). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/security/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Security Features|publisher=ECB|work=ECB}}</ref> Although [[Robert Kalina]]'s original designs were intended to show real monuments, in the case of the 500 euro note the [[Pont de Normandie]] in northern France, for political reasons the bridge and art are merely hypothetical examples of the architectural era.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/slideshow/money_talks/slide2.stm |work=BBC News }}</ref>

Like all euro notes, it contains the denomination, the [[Flag of Europe|EU flag]], the signature of the president of the [[European Central Bank]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Banknotes|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref> (and the initials of said bank in different [[Languages of the European Union|EU languages]], a depiction of EU territories overseas, the stars from the EU flag and various security features as described below. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Banknotes|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref>

=== Security features ===
The five hundred euro note has the highest-quality security features of all notes due to its value. It is protected by a [[hologram]] stripe, reflective glossy stripe, a [[EURion constellation]], [[watermark]]s, microprinting, [[Invisible ink#Inks visible under ultraviolet light|ultraviolet ink]], raised printing, a security thread, matted surface, perforations, see through number, colour changing ink, barcodes and a serial number. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/security/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Security features|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref> The printer code is located in the 8 o'clock position star. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/security/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Security features|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref>

=== Changes ===
There has so far only been one series of euro notes, however a new series similar to the current one is to be issued from 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Banknotes|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref> The initial issue of notes bears the signature of the first [[President of the European Central Bank|president]] of the [[European Central Bank]], [[Wim Duisenberg]], who was replaced on 1 November 2003 by [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], whose signature appears on subsequent issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Banknotes|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref>

== Crime ==
[[File:Nota 500 euros.jpg|thumb|left|One quarter of all 500 euro notes are recorded in Spain since its launch in 2002]]
The value of the note is several times greater than that of the largest circulating notes of other major currencies, like the [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|US$100 bill]].<ref name="bbc500euro">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/business/03/euro_cash/currency/html/500_euro.stm |title=500 euro |publisher=BBC News  |date= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> Thus a large monetary value can be concentrated into a small volume of notes. This facilitates crimes which deal in cash, including [[money laundering]], [[drug dealing]] and [[tax evasion]].<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2111504/ Euro Trash] Slate</ref>  There have been calls to withdraw the note for this reason.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/19/business/worldbusiness/19iht-euro.html |title=One in four <U+00E2><U+201A><U+00AC>500 bills are in Spain.

Spain in particular now has a quarter of all these high-value bills within its borders. This is far more than expected for an economy of its size and they are rarely seen in every-day commerce <U+2013> they have been nicknamed "[[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]]s" by the populace (as everyone knows they are there and what they look like but they have never seen them).<ref>{{cite news|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|title=500 euro note <U+2013> why criminals love it so|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8678979.stm|newspaper=BBC News |date=13 May 2010}}</ref> The UK and [[Law enforcement in Spain|Spanish police]] are using the bills to track money laundering.<ref name="nyt" /><ref name="digitaldebateblogs" />

As of 20 April 2010, money exchange offices in the United Kingdom stopped selling <U+20AC>500 notes due to their use in money laundering. The [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]] claimed that "90% of all <U+20AC>500 notes sold in the UK are in the hands of organised crime", revealed during an eight month analysis. The <U+20AC>500 note is worth in the region of <U+00A3>415 depending on exchange rates (more than eight times the value of the [[Bank of England]]'s largest publicly-circulated note), and had become the currency choice for gangs to hide their profits.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8678886.stm|publisher=BBC News |title=Organised crime fears cause ban on 500 euro note sales|date=13 May 2010|first=Dominic|last=Casciani}}</ref>

The EU directive 2005/06/EC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005L0060:EN:HTML |title=Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing tries to prevent such crime by requiring banks, real estate agents and many more companies to investigate and report usage of cash in excess of <U+20AC>15,000.

== Circulation ==
Currently, there are approximately 584,187,400 <U+20AC>500 banknotes in circulation around the Eurozone 17, therefore it is the second-least circulated banknote in the Eurozone. (As of August 2011) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/stats/euro/circulation/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Circulation|work=ECB|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref> That is approximately <U+20AC>292,093,692,500 worth of <U+20AC>500 banknotes. (as of August 2011) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/stats/euro/circulation/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Circulation|work=ECB|publisher=European Central Bank}} </ref> That is a decrease of 0.0004% from the previous month. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/stats/euro/circulation/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Circulation|work=ECB|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref> The ECB closely monitors the stock and circulation of euro banknotes and coins.
