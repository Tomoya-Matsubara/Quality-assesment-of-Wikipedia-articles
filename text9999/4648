'''Andr<U+00E9>s de Santa Cruz y Calahumana''' (December 5, 1792, [[La Paz]], Bolivia &ndash; September 25, 1865, Beauvoir, France) was [[List of Presidents of Peru|President of Peru]] (1827) and [[Bolivia]] (1829-1839). He also served as [[Protector (title)|Supreme Protector]] of the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836-1839), a political entity created mainly by his personal endeavors.

==Early life and education==
Santa Cruz was born on December 5, 1792 in the city of La Paz, which at that time had been recently transferred from the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] to the [[Viceroyalty of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]]. His father was Jos<U+00E9> Santa Cruz y Villavicencio, a [[Spanish people|Spaniard]], and his mother Juana Basilia Calahumana, an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] and ''[[cacique]]'' of the town of Huarina. In later years, Andr<U+00E9>s de Santa Cruz would claim that through his mother, he descended directly from [[Inca Empire|Inca rulers]].<ref>http://www.mundoandino.com/Bolivia/Andres-de-Santa-Cruz</ref> He began his studies in his hometown at the San Francisco [[Convent]], and continued them at the San Antonio Abad [[Seminary]] in the city of [[Cusco|Cuzco]].  In 1809 he left the seminary and returned to La Paz.

==Military career==
After Santa Cruz's return home, his father enrolled him as an [[Ensign (rank)|alf<U+00E9>rez]] in the ''Dragones de Apolobamba'' [[Regiment]] of the Spanish Army. As such, he participated in the battles of [[Battle of Guaqui|Guaqui]] (July 20, 1811), [[Battle of Vilcapugio|Vilcapugio]] (October 1, 1813) and [[Battle of Ayohuma|Ayohuma]] (November 14, 1813).  The latter resulted in the defeat of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] Independentist forces attempting to liberate the [[Upper Peru]] (modern day [[Bolivia]]) from Spanish rule.  Santa Cruz also took part in the Spanish colonial campaigns to suppress the insurrection of [[Mateo Pumacahua]] (1814-1815), further demonstrating his loyalty to the [[Spain|Spanish Crown]]. His luck ran out at the [[Battle of La Tablada]] (April 15, 1817), where he was captured and taken as [[prisoner of war]] to [[Buenos Aires]].  He managed to escape, first to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and then to Lima. As a reward, he was named [[Commander]] of [[Chorrillos]].

==War of Independence==
At the time of the landing of the rebel army of [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]] on the Peruvian coast, Santa Cruz was [[commander]] of [[militia]] forces in the region of Huarochir<U+00ED>. In that position, he fought against the independetist in the [[Battle of Pasco]] (December 6, 1820), but the [[royalist]]s were defeated and Santa Cruz captured. Taken to [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n|San Martin's]] [[headquarters]] at [[Huaura]], he decided to switch sides and joined the Patriot Army (January 8, 1821). Santa Cruz ascended rapidly, reaching the [[military rank|rank]] of [[Colonel]] later that year and that of [[Brigadier General|Brigade General]] in 1822 for leading Peruvian troops at the [[Battle of Pichincha]] (24 May 1822). 

He revolted against the [[Congress of Peru|Peruvian Congress]] on February 26, 1823, and forced it to elect [[Jos<U+00E9> de la Riva Ag<U+00FC>ero]] as [[List of Presidents of Peru|President]]. As [[commander]] of a [[Peruvian Army]] expedition, Santa Cruz occupied the port of [[Arica]] and defeated a royalist army at the [[Battle of Zepita]] (August 27, 1823).  Failing to exploit his victory, he retreated hastily.

When [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]] assumed the presidency of [[Peru]] (February 17, 1824), Santa Cruz joined his army and was named [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the Peruvian [[Division (military)|Division]]. In that condition, he participated of the [[Battle of Jun<U+00ED>n]] (August 6, 1824). Afterwards, he was named [[Prefect#Modern sub-national administration|Prefect]] of [[Ayacucho Region|Ayacucho]], and then Chief of Staff of the Patriot Army during the campaign for the liberation of [[Bolivia]]. As a reward for his actions, Santa Cruz  received the [[title]]s of [[Marshal#Military|Marshal]] and [[Prefect#Modern sub-national administration|Prefect]] of [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]] on April 1825. 

Named President of the Government Council in [[Lima]], he was in charge of the Peruvian [[Executive (government)|Executive]] after Bol<U+00ED>var returned to [[Gran Colombia]] on September 4, 1826, until the collapse of the Bolivarian regime in Peru on January 27, 1827. Santa Cruz temporarily assumed the post of President until June 9, 1827, when [[Jos<U+00E9> La Mar]] was elected by [[Congress of Peru|Congress]].

==President of Bolivia==
Removed from power, Santa Cruz was named Peruvian [[ambassador]] to [[Chile]], but he was recalled to [[Bolivia]] where he had been proclaimed as [[President of Bolivia|President]]. Sworn in on May 24, 1829, he found a country afflicted by endemic internal disorders and very near to bankruptcy. Measures undertaken to resolve these problems included purging [[conspiracy (political)|conspirators]], reforming and strengthening the [[Military of Bolivia|Army]], reforming the [[bureaucracy]], reforming [[public finance]]s, issuing new [[currency]], issuing a new [[Constitution]], issuing a new [[Civil Code]] based on the [[Napoleonic Code]] and establishing [[Cobija (Chile)|Cobija]] as a [[free port]]. The [[authoritarianism|authoritarian regime]] imposed by Santa Cruz brought stability to [[Bolivia]] at a time when most countries in [[Latin America]] faced widespread [[unrest]]. Furthermore, it formed a solid base from which to pursue his main project, the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]].

==Peru-Bolivian Confederation==
[[Image:Flag of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation.svg|left|thumb|Flag of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation.]]
As [[President of Bolivia]], Santa Cruz instigated several failed plots to achieve a political union with [[Peru]], taking advantage of that country's chronic political unrest. His best opportunity came in 1835 when the [[List of Presidents of Peru|Peruvian President]] [[Luis Jos<U+00E9> de Orbegoso]] requested his assistance to fight the rebel army of [[Felipe Santiago Salaverry]]. Santa Cruz defeated Peruvian [[caudillo]] [[Agust<U+00ED>n Gamarra]] at the [[Battle of Yanacocha]] (August 13, 1835) and Salaverry at the [[Battle of Uchumayo]] (February 4, 1836) after which he had Salaverry [[summary execution|summarily executed]].

At the instigation of Santa Cruz, a Congress of the Peruvian southern [[department (subnational entity)|departments]] ([[Arequipa Region|Arequipa]], [[Ayacucho Region|Ayacucho]], [[Cusco Region|Cuzco]] and [[Puno region|Puno]]) gathered at Sicuani and declared the establishment of the Republic of [[South Peru]] (March 17, 1836). A similar [[deliberative assembly|assembly]] at Huaura of the northern [[department (subnational entity)|departments]] ([[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]], [[Jun<U+00ED>n Region|Jun<U+00ED>n]], [[La Libertad region|La Libertad]] and [[Lima Region|Lima]]) founded the Republic of [[North Peru]] (August 11, 1836). Both recognized Santa Cruz as [[Protector (title)|Supreme Protector]] with extensive powers, which enabled him to create the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] on October 28, 1836. He summoned to the city of [[Tacna]] representatives of both [[legislature]]s together with those of the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Bolivian Congress]] assembled at Tapacar<U+00ED> to establish a [[Constitution]] for the new [[Sovereign state|State]]. Under his direction, they signed a pact on May 1, 1837 which named him [[Protector (title)|Supreme Protector]] for a ten-year period.

[[Image:DiegoPortales.jpg|thumb|Diego Portales]]
Invested with considerable powers, Santa Cruz endeavoured to establish in Peru the same type of [[authoritarianism|authoritarian order]] he had imposed in Bolivia. He issued a [[Civil Code]], a [[Penal Code]], a [[Trade]] [[Regulation]], a [[Customs (tax)|Customs]] [[Regulation]] and reorganized [[tax]] collection procedures allowing an increase in state [[revenue]]s while restraining expenditures.  The Confederation generated resistances among several groups in both countries, who resented the dilution of [[nation|national identities]]. An important number of Peruvian politicians opposed to the idea of the Confederation fled to [[Chile]], where they received support from the powerful [[Minister (government)|Minister]] [[Diego Portales]]. Together they amassed a military expedition against Santa Cruz, led by [[Admiral]] [[Manuel Blanco Encalada]], but they were encircled by Santa Cruz and had to surrender by the [[Treaty of Paucarpata]], signed on November 17, 1837. The Chilean Government organized a second expedition, which defeated the [[Protector (title)|Supreme Protector]] at the [[Battle of Yungay]] (January 20, 1839) and forced the dissolution of the Confederation.

==Later years==
After resigning from his post as [[Protector (title)|Supreme Protector]] (February 20, 1839), Santa Cruz fled to [[Ecuador]] from where he plotted unsuccessfully to regain power. On October 13, 1843 he disembarked at [[Camarones (Chile)|Camarones]] in the Peruvian province of [[Tarapac<U+00E1> Region|Tarapac<U+00E1>]] but was captured while trying to reach [[Bolivia]]. Delivered to the Chilean Government, he was imprisoned at [[Chill<U+00E1>n]] from 1844 until 1846 when he was freed. He was named [[ambassador]] to several European countries by [[Manuel Isidoro Belzu|Manuel Belz<U+00FA>]] (1848-1855) and then ran for president of Bolivia but was defeated by [[General]] [[Jorge C<U+00F3>rdova]]. After staying for a while in Argentina, he returned to [[France]] where he lived the rest of his life at [[Versailles]]. He died at Beauvoir, near [[Nantes]] on September 25, 1865. One hundred years later, in 1965, the remains of the old Marshal were repatriated from France by the military government of the day and reinterred ceremoniously beside the Presidential Palace in Bolivia.
