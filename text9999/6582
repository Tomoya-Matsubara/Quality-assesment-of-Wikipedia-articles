'''State Route 47''' (SR 47) is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]], connecting [[Terminal Island]] to the mainland in the [[Los Angeles area]]. From its south end at [[I-110 (CA)|I-110]] in [[San Pedro, CA|San Pedro]], it heads east across the [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]] to the island and the end of state maintenance. The state highway begins again at the junction with [[I-710 (CA)|I-710]] on Terminal Island, crossing the [[Schuyler Heim Bridge]] north to the mainland and the second terminus, where [[SR 103 (CA)|SR 103]] begins. Signage continues along a locally maintained route, mainly '''Alameda Street''', to the [[Gardena Freeway]] ([[SR 91 (CA)|SR 91]]) in [[Compton, CA|Compton]], and an unconstructed alignment follows the same corridor to the [[Santa Monica Freeway]] ([[I-10 (CA)|I-10]]) near [[downtown Los Angeles]].

The entire route is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]], and both constructed segments are [[freeway]]s, officially known as parts of the '''Seaside Freeway''' (which continues to [[SR 1 (CA)|SR 1]] via [[I-710 (CA)|I-710]]<ref name=HR144>{{cite CAstat|year=1959|HR=yes|ch=144|p=3502}}: "That the California Highway Commission is requested to declare the added portion of Route 167 which will connect the Harbor Freeway and the Long Beach Freeway to be a freeway, to be known as the Seaside Freeway..."</ref>) and [[Terminal Island Freeway]] (which continues to SR 1 via [[SR 103 (CA)|SR 103]]).<ref>[[California Department of Transportation]], [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/2006_Named_Freeways.pdf Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California], 2006</ref> However, there are several [[at-grade intersection]]s along the gap on Terminal Island, and Alameda Street is a surface roadway, albeit one with few intersections, as it runs alongside the [[Alameda Corridor]] [[rail line]].

==Route description==
State Route 47 begins at the south end of the [[Harbor Freeway]] ([[I-110 (CA)|I-110]]) in the [[Los Angeles, CA|Los Angeles]] neighborhood of [[San Pedro, CA|San Pedro]] and heads east to the [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]], with only one interchange - at Harbor Boulevard - before the 1963 [[suspension bridge]] over the main channel of [[Los Angeles Harbor]]. After coming back to ground level on [[Terminal Island]], SR 47 becomes the locally-maintained Seaside Avenue at the interchange with Ferry Street, where there was a [[toll plaza]] until 2000. The freeway ends just beyond at Navy Way, after which the road enters [[Long Beach, CA|Long Beach]] and becomes Ocean Boulevard, which was rebuilt as a freeway in 2007. However, SR 47 must exit the freeway onto its [[frontage road]]s, intersecting Henry Ford Avenue before turning north onto the [[Terminal Island Freeway]]. Ocean Boulevard leads east over the [[Gerald Desmond Bridge]] and becomes [[Interstate 710 (California)|Interstate 710]], with access to [[downtown Long Beach]].<ref name=maps>[[Google Maps]] street maps and [[USGS]] [[topographic map]]s, accessed January 2008 via [http://mapper.acme.com/ ACME Mapper] and [http://www.topozone.com/ TopoZone]<!--because Acme's topos don't have most of the road--></ref>

State maintenance begins again on the Terminal Island Freeway, which is also signed as [[State Route 103 (California)|State Route 103]].<ref name=photos>Photographs of SR 47 northbound, taken [[May 30]], [[2004]], from [http://www.westcoastroads.com/california/ca-047.html California @ WestCoastRoads - California 47]</ref> After a partial interchange with New Dock Street, only allowing access to and from the north, SR 47 crosses the [[Cerritos Channel]] on the [[Schuyler Heim Bridge]], a [[lift bridge]] opened in 1948. Just beyond the bridge, SR 47 leaves the freeway, which continues northeast as SR 103, onto Henry Ford Avenue, and state maintenance ends. The remainder of what is signed as SR 47,<ref name=photos/> along Henry Ford Avenue and Alameda Street to the [[Redondo Beach Freeway]] ([[SR 91 (CA)|SR 91]]), is locally maintained. Henry Ford Avenue quickly crosses the [[Dominguez Channel]] and Anaheim Street, and merges with Alameda Street, which continues southwest into [[Wilmington, CA|Wilmington]] as a local street. The part of Alameda Street rebuilt during the [[Alameda Corridor]] project begins here, and the roadway passes under all cross streets - [[Pacific Coast Highway]] ([[SR 1 (CA)|SR 1]]), [[Sepulveda Boulevard]], 223rd Street (at the [[San Diego Freeway]]/[[I-405 (CA)|I-405]] interchange), Carson Street, Del Amo Boulevard, and [[Artesia Boulevard]] (at the Redondo Beach Freeway/SR 91 interchange) - with two-way connector ramps. The one major [[at-grade intersection]] here is the split with Santa Fe Avenue north of Del Amo Boulevard, just south of the underpass where Alameda Street moves from the east to the west side of the rail line. (Before the corridor was built, the crossover was further south, at Dominguez Street, halfway between Carson Street and Del Amo Boulevard.)<ref name=maps/>
[[Image:Vincent Thomas Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]]]]
North of Artesia Boulevard, the rail line descends into the 10-mile (16 km) [[Mid-Corridor Trench]], with two streets straddling it at ground level: Alameda Street to the west and a local frontage road to the east. All cross streets are thus grade-separated from the rail line while intersecting the streets at grade, except for Rosecrans Avenue, which bridges over all three. Crossings along this segment include the [[Century Freeway]] ([[I-105 (CA)|I-105]], no access), [[Imperial Highway]], [[Firestone Boulevard]] (former [[SR 42 (CA)|SR 42]]), and [[Slauson Avenue]]. Just south of 25th Street, the rail line curves northeast out of the trench, and the two roadways join to become a single Alameda Street, which soon interchanges with the [[Santa Monica Freeway]] ([[I-10 (CA)|I-10]]), at the north end of what is legislated as Route 47. The street continues north through the east side of [[downtown Los Angeles]], crossing the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] ([[US 101 (CA)|US 101]]) just west of [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]], and ending soon after at Elmyra Street, where it becomes Spring Street.<ref name=maps/>

==History==
The [[Los Angeles County, CA|Los Angeles County]] Board of Supervisors decided in mid-1916, at the urging of the Harbor Truck Highway Association (formed mid-1914),<ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], Harbor Truck Highway Association is Formed, [[July 4]], [[1917]], p. II7</ref> to build a '''Harbor Truck Boulevard''' stretching about 10 miles (15 km) between [[Los Angeles, CA|Los Angeles]] and [[Compton, CA|Compton]], intended to be used by [[truck]]s to the [[Port of Los Angeles]] at [[San Pedro, CA|San Pedro]].<ref>[[American Road Builders' Association]], Good Roads, Harbor Truck Boulevard to be Built by Los Angeles County, California, [[June 24]], [[1916]]</ref> After that portion was completed,<!--when? by 1920?--> an extension to [[Wilmington, CA|Wilmington]] was opened on [[February 2]], [[1924]], resulting in a completely independent truck route to the port.<ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], Truck Boulevard Opened, [[February 5]], [[1924]], p. A1</ref> This roadway, which lay about halfway between Wilmington Avenue and [[Long Beach Boulevard]], extended the existing Alameda Street, which ran along - to [[Slauson Avenue]] - and then west of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]'s [[San Pedro Branch]] to Oris Street, the north limit of Compton.<ref>[[United States Geological Survey]], [http://cricket.csuchico.edu/spcfotos/maps/topo_search.html Pasadena (1900) and Downey (1902)], scale 1:62500</ref> The truck boulevard continued along the west side to Dominguez Street (lying between the SP's San Pedro Branch and [[Pacific Electric Railway]]'s [[Dominguez Line]] beyond Dominguez Junction), and crossed there to the east side for the rest of the route to Anaheim Street in Wilmington. There trucks could turn east and south to [[Terminal Island]] via Henry Ford Avenue, or continue southwest through Wilmington to San Pedro. The highway soon came to be known as Alameda Street all the way to Wilmington.<ref>[[United States Geological Survey]], [http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu/6min_los_angeles_county/ Los Angeles (1928), Watts (1924 and 1937), Compton (1924 and 1930), and Wilmington (1925)], scale 1:24000]</ref> It did not become a state highway; instead the state took over [[Figueroa Street]] ([[California State Route 11 (1934)|SR 11]]) to the west and [[Atlantic Avenue (Los Angeles)|Atlantic Avenue]] ([[California State Route 15 (1934)|SR 15]]) to the east.<ref>[[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]], [http://www.americanroads.us/citymaps/1944CaStateMapLosAngeles.png Los Angeles and Vicinity], 1944</ref>

Plans for [[freeway]]s in Los Angeles County evolved from a 1937 [[Automobile Club of Southern California]] plan,<ref name=plan-1937>[[Automobile Club of Southern California]], map from Traffic Survey, Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, 1937, reproduced in Janet L. Abu-Lughod, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles: America's Global Cities, 1999, p. 256</ref> which was modified by the city's [[Transportation Engineering Board]] (TEB) in 1939.<ref name=plan-1939>[[Transportation Engineering Board]], map from A Transit Program for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Region, 1939, reproduced in Gerrylynn K. Roberts, Philip Steadman, American Cities and Technology: Wilderness to Wired City, 1999, p. 79</ref> The former included a single freeway connecting Los Angeles to Long Beach, beginning at [[Pasadena, CA|Pasadena]] and heading south-southwest to [[Lynwood, CA|Lynwood]], then paralleling [[Long Beach Boulevard]] to Long Beach. The TEB's plan shifted this route farther east to near the present [[Long Beach Freeway]], while keeping the route near Long Beach Boulevard as a second freeway leaving the [[Ramona Parkway]] (San Bernardino Freeway) east of downtown and heading south near Alameda Street and Long Beach Boulevard to Long Beach. This second freeway came to be known as the Long Beach Parkway<ref>[[Long Beach Independent]], City Served by Three Freeways Urged for Postwar Period by Planning Group, [[July 9]], [[1943]]</ref> or '''Alamitos Parkway''', and connected in north Long Beach with a [[Terminal Island Freeway]] southwest to [[Terminal Island]].<ref name=plan-1947>[[Los Angeles County Regional Planning District]], [http://cahighways.org/maps/1947feplan.jpg Master Plan of Metropolitan Los Angeles Freeways], adopted [[August 6]], [[1947]]</ref> Because the [[Long Beach Naval Shipyard]] was located on the island, the [[U.S. Navy]] paid for the construction of the $14 million freeway from the island to Willow Street, including the $5.3 million [[Schuyler Heim Lift Bridge]].<ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], Harbor Bridge Project Reinstated by Navy, [[December 18]], [[1945]], p. A1</ref> Construction began in early 1946,<ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], Terminal Island Bridge Under Way, [[January 28]], [[1946]], p. 3</ref> and the completed link was dedicated on [[January 10]], [[1948]],<ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], High Lift Bridge Dedicated at Terminal Island, [[January 11]], [[1948]], p. 14</ref> replacing the older [[Henry Ford Bridge]].

Early plans also included a north-south freeway on each side of the [[Los Angeles Central Business District]], splitting at the merge of the [[Harbor Parkway]] (Harbor Freeway) and [[Venice Parkway]] northeast of the [[University of Southern California]], and rejoining at the split between the [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] (Pasadena Freeway) and [[Riverside Parkway]] south of [[Dodger Stadium]].<ref name=plan-1939/> Initially known as the '''East By-Pass''' and West By-Pass,<ref>Andrew Hamilton, [[New York Times]], Los Angeles Roads Plan, [[February 25]], [[1940]], p. 128</ref> the latter later became part of the Harbor Parkway, while the former remained as a separate route roughly along [[Main Street (Los Angeles)|Main Street]].<ref name=plan-1947/> The state legislature added the East By-Pass to the state highway system in 1947 as '''Route 222'''.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1947|ex=1|ch=11|p=3798}}: "Route 222 is from Route 165 [I-110] near Adams Street to Route 205 [SR 110] near Elysian Park in Los Angeles"</ref> The [[Los Angeles City Planning Commission]] approved a revised master plan in mid-1955, based on various studied that had been made. A new '''Industrial Freeway''' replaced the Terminal Island Freeway and Alamitos Parkway between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles, where it then continued north along the former East By-Pass (which was not kept south of the [[Santa Monica Freeway]]) and the southern part of the Riverside Parkway to the interchange of the [[Glendale Freeway]] and [[Golden State Freeway]] (which had replaced the rest of the Riverside Parkway).<ref>[[Los Angeles City Planning Commission]], Accomplishments, 1955, p. 6</ref><ref name=plan-1958>[[Metropolitan Transportation Engineering Board]], [http://cahighways.org/maps/1956-la-mteb2.pdf Master Plan of Freeways and Expressways], adopted [[February 28]], [[1958]]</ref> The Industrial Freeway south of the Santa Monica Freeway became '''Route 270''' in 1959,<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1959|ch=1062|p=3120}}: "Route 270 is from Terminal Island to Route 173 [I-10]."</ref> but the ex-Riverside Parkway piece north of the Arroyo Seco Parkway never became a state highway.<ref>[[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]], [http://cahighways.org/maps/1963routes.jpg Los Angeles and Vicinity], 1963</ref>

In the [[1964 renumbering (California)|1964 renumbering]], the Industrial Freeway became Route 47, and the former East By-Pass became '''Route 241'''.<ref name=law-renumbering>{{cite CAstat|year=1963|ch=385|p=1175, 1187}}: "Route 47 is from Route 7 at Terminal Island to Route 10." "Route 241 is from Route 11 near Adams Street to Route 11 near Elysian Park in Los Angeles."</ref> The latter was deleted the next year, and the former was extended west from its south end on Terminal Island to [[San Pedro, CA|San Pedro]], replacing part of [[California State Route 7 (1964)|SR 7]], which was truncated to [[SR 1 (CA)|SR 1]] in [[Long Beach, CA|Long Beach]] at the same time.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1965|ch=1372|p=3273, 3276}}: "Route 7 is from Route 1 to Route 210 in Pasadena." "Route 47 is from Route 11 in San Pedro to Route 10 via the Vincent Thomas Bridge."</ref> ([[I-710 (CA)|I-710]], which later replaced SR 7, has since been re-extended to SR 47 on Terminal Island.) This extension, which had been added to the state highway system in 1949 as part of [[Legislative Route 231 (California pre-1964)|Route 231]],<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1949|ch=1261|p=2215}}: "Route 231 is...from Route 165 [I-110] in San Pedro to Route 167 [I-710] in Long Beach, via the mainland portion of Long Beach Outer Harbor and Terminal Island..."</ref> included the 1963 [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]].<ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], Vincent Thomas Bridge to Be Dedicated Saturday, [[September 27]], [[1963]], p. C7</ref> Construction on the $5.8 million freeway link from that bridge west to the [[Harbor Freeway]] in San Pedro - officially the Seaside Freeway, but called an extension of the Harbor Freeway by the media - began in March 1968,<ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], Governor to Speak at Bridge Link Ceremony, [[March 3]], [[1968]], p. 1</ref> and it was dedicated on [[July 9]], [[1970]].<ref>Lee Bastajian, [[Los Angeles Times]], Vincent Thomas Bridge Link Scheduled to Open in July, [[May 31]], [[1970]], p. CS1</ref><ref>[[Long Beach Independent]], Dedication Set on Freeway Link to Bridge, [[July 8]], [[1970]]</ref><ref>[[Valley News (Van Nuys)]], Harbor Freeway Extension to Be Dedicated Today, [[July 9]], [[1970]]</ref> The two parts of SR 47 were, and still are, connected by the Los Angeles-maintained Seaside Avenue and Long Beach-maintained Ocean Boulevard. (A freeway upgrade of the latter was completed in June 2007,<ref>[[Long Beach, CA|Long Beach]], [http://www.ci.long-beach.ca.us/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=2575&targetid=54 Ocean Boulevard at Terminal Island: New and Improved], [[June 25]], [[2007]]</ref> but [[traffic signal]]s remain on the former and on the ramps connecting Ocean Boulevard with the Terminal Island Freeway.)

Early maps show that the Terminal Island Freeway was to extend north to the [[Long Beach Freeway]] ([[I-710 (CA)|I-710]]) near the [[San Diego Freeway]] ([[I-405 (CA)|I-405]]),<ref>[[Rand McNally & Company]], [http://cahighways.org/maps/1959rmn.jpg Los Angeles and Vicinity], 1959</ref><ref>[[Rand McNally]] Auto Road Atlas: United States, Canada, Mexico, 1963</ref> but the location for SR 47 adopted by the [[California Highway Commission]] on [[January 22]], [[1969]] led northwest from the Terminal Island Freeway's end at Carson Street to I-405 near Alameda Street, and then paralleled that street into Los Angeles.<ref>[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]], [[August 5]], [[1969]], p. 1<!--Q&A column--></ref><ref>[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]], Public Notice of Route Location Approval by Bureau of Public Roads, [[June 1]], [[1970]]</ref> A 1982 state law specified that SR 47 shall use Henry Ford Avenue and Alameda Street between the Heim Bridge and the [[Redondo Beach Freeway]]<!--that's what it was called then--> ([[SR 91 (CA)|SR 91]]), rather than the adopted alignment to the east,<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1982|ch=914|p=3351}}</ref> and in 1984 the legislature created [[State Route 103 (California)|State Route 103]] to replace the former alignment on the Terminal Island Freeway between SR 47 and the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] ([[SR 1 (CA)|SR 1]]).<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1984|ch=409|p=1773}}</ref> Due to the cancellation of the Industrial Freeway and planned port expansions, the [[Alameda Corridor]] project was created, including an improved rail line and a widening of Alameda Street from four to six lanes south of SR 91.<ref>George Stein, [[Los Angeles Times]], Price of Progress: Expansion of Ports, Boon to Greater L.A., May Be Burden Along Alameda St., [[October 12]], [[1986]], p. 1</ref><ref>Sheryl Stolberg, [[Los Angeles Times]], Harbor Plan Brings New Wilmington a Little Closer, [[December 25]], [[1988]], p. 6</ref> Alameda Street was rebuilt for the project, with [[grade separation]]s at most major streets south of SR 91, and is now signed as part of SR 47 there, but remains mostly four lanes.<!--why?--> As part of a project to replace the Heim Bridge, [[Caltrans]] and the [[Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority]] plan to improve the connection near the south end of Alameda Street, possibly by building a new [[expressway]] replacement for SR 47 south of SR 1, or by extending SR 103 northwest via the originally-planned alignment to Alameda Street south of I-405.<ref>[[Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority]], [http://www.acta.org/projects_planning_SR47.htm Planning - SR-47 Port Access Expressway], accessed January 2008</ref>
