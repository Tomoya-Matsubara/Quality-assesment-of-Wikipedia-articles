The '''Danube''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>d<U+00E6>nju<U+02D0>b}} in [[English language|English]]) is the longest [[river]] in the [[European Union]] and [[Europe]]'s second longest river after the [[Volga]]. 

The river originates in the [[Black Forest]] in [[Germany]] as the much smaller [[Brigach]] and [[Breg River|Breg]] rivers which join at the eponymously named German town [[Donaueschingen]], after which it is known as the Danube and flows eastwards for a distance of some 2850&nbsp;km (1771 miles), passing through four Central and Eastern European capitals, before emptying into the [[Black Sea]] via the [[Danube Delta]] in [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]].

Known to history as one of the long-standing frontiers of the [[Roman Empire]], the river flows through <U+2014> or forms a part of the borders of <U+2014> ten countries: Germany (7.5%), [[Austria]] (10.3%), [[Slovakia]] (5.8%), [[Hungary]] (11.7%), [[Croatia]] (4.5%), [[Serbia]] (10.3%),  Romania (28.9%), [[Bulgaria]] (5.2%), [[Moldova]] (1.7%), and Ukraine (3.8%).{{Fact|date=March 2009}} 

==Name==
The English language has, since the [[Norman conquest of England]], used the French word ''Danube''. 
In other languages, particularly those spoken in the locations which the river flows through:

*[[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Dunav''
*{{lang-bg|<U+0414><U+0443><U+043D><U+0430><U+0432>}} (''Dunav'')
*[[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Dunaj''
*{{lang-de|Donau}}, from earlier ''Danuvius''
*{{lang-fi|Tonava}}
*{{lang-hu|Duna}} 
*{{lang-it|Danubio}}
*{{lang-sl|Donava}}

*[[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Farsi language|Farsi]]: <U+062F><U+0627><U+0646><U+0648><U+0628>

One theory ultimately derives all these variations to the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''*d<U+0101>nu'', meaning "to flow", and its exact equivalent is found in the Dutch name of the river ''Donwy''.<ref>Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams. ''The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture''. London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997: 486.</ref> Other theories derive the name from an [[Iranian languages|Iranic]] root that has contributed the names of all other major rivers emptying into the Black Sea, such as the [[Don]], [[Donets]], [[Dnieper]] and [[Dniestr]]. Ancient Greek ''Istros'' was a borrowing from [[Thracian language|Thracian]] meaning "strong, swift", akin to [[Sanskrit]] ''is.iras'' "swift", Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|<U+1F31><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03C2>}} (''hier<U+00F3>s'') "strong, sacred".<ref>Kati<U+010D>ic', Radislav. ''Ancient Languages of the Balkans, Part One''. Paris: Mouton, 1976: 144.</ref>

==Geography==
===Drainage basin===
In addition to the [[Danubian Europe|Danubian countries]], the [[drainage basin]] includes parts of nine more countries: [[Italy]] (0.15%), [[Poland]] (0.09%), [[Switzerland]] (0.32%), the [[Czech Republic]] (2.5%), [[Slovenia]] (2.2%), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (4.8%), the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Albania]] (0.03%). The highest point of the drainage basin is the summit of [[Piz Bernina]] at the Italy<U+2013>Switzerland border, {{convert|4049|m}}.

===Tributaries===
{{main|List of tributaries of the Danube}}
The Danube's watershed extends into many other countries. Many Danubian tributaries are important rivers in their own right, navigable by barges and other shallow-draught boats. From its source to its outlet into the Black Sea, its main tributaries are (in order):

The Danube flows through four capital cities (shown in bold), more than any other river in the world.

===Sectioning===<!-- This section is linked from [[Bratislava]] -->
*Upper Section: From spring to [[Dev<U+00ED>n Gate]]. Danube remains a characteristic mountain river until [[Passau]], with average bottom gradient 0.0012%, from Passau to Dev<U+00ED>n Gate the gradient lessens to 0.0006%.
*Middle Section: From [[Dev<U+00ED>n Gate]] to [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]]. The riverbed widens and the average bottom gradient becomes only 0.00006%.
*Lower Section: From Iron Gate to [[Sulina]], with average gradient as little as 0.00003%.

==Modern navigation==
[[Image:Parliament Budapest Hungary.jpg|thumb|The Danube in [[Budapest]]]]The Danube is navigable by ocean ships from the Black Sea to [[Br<U+0103>ila]] in [[Romania]] and by river ships to [[Kelheim]], Bavaria; smaller craft can navigate further upstream to [[Ulm]], in Germany. About 60 of its tributaries are also navigable.

Since the completion of the German [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal|Rhine<U+2013>Main<U+2013>Danube Canal]] in 1992, the river has been part of a trans-European waterway from [[Rotterdam]] on the [[North Sea]] to [[Sulina]] on the Black Sea (3500&nbsp;km). In 1994 the Danube was declared one of ten [[Pan-European corridors|Pan-European transport corridors]], routes in Central and Eastern Europe that required major investment over the following ten to fifteen years. The amount of goods transported on the Danube increased to about 100 million tons in 1987. In 1999, transport on the river was made difficult by the [[NATO]] bombing of three bridges in Serbia. The clearance of the debris was finished in 2002. The temporary pontoon bridge that hampered navigation was finally removed in 2005.

At the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]], the Danube flows through a [[gorge]] that forms part of the boundary between Serbia and Romania; it contains the [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] Iron Gate I [[dam]], followed at about 60&nbsp;km downstream (outside the gorge) by the Iron Gate ll dam. On 13 April 2006, a record peak discharge at Iron Gate Dam reached 15,400 m<U+00B3>/s.

There are three artificial waterways built on the Danube: the [[Danube-Tisa-Danube Canal|Danube<U+2013>Tisa<U+2013>Danube Canal]] (DTD) in the [[Banat]] and [[Ba<U+010D>ka]] regions ([[Vojvodina]], northern province of Serbia); the 64&nbsp;km [[Danube-Black Sea Canal|Danube<U+2013>Black Sea Canal]], between [[Cernavod<U+0103>]] and [[Constan<U+0163>a]] (Romania) finished in 1984, shortens the distance to the Black Sea by 400&nbsp;km; the Rhine<U+2013>Main<U+2013>Danube Canal (about 171&nbsp;km), finished in 1992, linking the North Sea to the Black Sea.

==The Danube delta==
{{main|Danube Delta}}
The Danube Delta has been a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1991. Its wetlands (on the [[Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance]]) support vast flocks of migratory birds, including the endangered [[Pygmy Cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax pygmaeus''). Rival canalization and drainage scheme threaten the delta: see [[Bastroe Channel]].

==Geology==
[[Image:IJzeren Poort 2.jpg|thumb|right| [[<U+0110>erdap]] gorge, Serbia, overlooking Romania]]Although the [[headwater]]s of the Danube are relatively small today, geologically, the Danube is much older than the [[Rhine]], with which its catchment area competes in today's southern Germany. This has a few interesting geological complications. Since the Rhine is the only river rising in the [[Alps]] mountains which flows north towards the North Sea, an invisible line divides large parts of southern Germany, which is sometimes referred to as the [[European Watershed]]. 

However, before the last [[ice age]] in the [[Pleistocene]], the Rhine started at the southwestern tip of the Black Forest, while the waters from the Alps that today feed the Rhine were carried east by the so-called ''Urdonau'' (original Danube). Parts of this ancient river's bed, which was much larger than today's Danube, can still be seen in (now waterless) canyons in today's landscape of the [[Swabian Alb]]. After the [[Upper Rhine valley]] had been eroded, most waters from the Alps changed their direction and began feeding the Rhine. Today's upper Danube is but a meek reflection of the ancient one.

Since the [[Swabian Alb]] is largely shaped of porous [[limestone]], and since the Rhine's level is much lower than the Danube's, today subsurface rivers carry much water from the Danube to the Rhine. On many days in the summer, when the Danube carries little water, it completely oozes away noisily into these underground channels at two locations in the Swabian Alp, which are referred to as the ''Donauversickerung'' ([[Danube Sink]]). Most of this water resurfaces only 12&nbsp;km south at the [[Aachtopf]], Germany's wellspring with the highest flow, an average of 8500 litres per second, north of [[Lake Constance]] <U+2014> thus feeding the Rhine. The European Water Divide thus in fact only applies for those waters that pass beyond this point, and only during the days of the year when the Danube carries enough water to survive the sink holes in the Donauversickerung.

Since this enormous amount of underground water erodes much of its surrounding limestone, it is estimated that the Danube upper course will one day disappear entirely in favor of the Rhine, an event called [[Stream capture|stream capturing]].

The Danube basin was the site of some of the earliest human cultures. The [[Danubian culture|Danubian Neolithic]] cultures include the [[Linear Pottery culture]]s of the mid-Danube basin. The third millennium BC [[Vu<U+010D>edol culture]] (from the Vu<U+010D>edol site near [[Vukovar]], [[Croatia]]) is famous for its ceramics. Many sites of the sixth-to-third millennium BC [[Vin<U+010D>a culture]] are sited along the Danube.  The river was part of the Roman empire's [[Limes Germanicus]].

Of importance for the Danube is also the [[International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River]] (ICPDR). The ICPDR is an international organisation consisting of 13 member states (Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine) and the [[European Union]]. ICPDR, established in 1998, deals not only with the Danube itself, but with the whole Danube River Basin, which also includes its tributaries and the groundwater resources. The goal of the ICPDR is to implement the Danube River Protection Convention, promoting and coordinating sustainable and equitable water management, including conservation, improvement and rational use of waters for the benefit of the Danube River Basin countries and their people. The Romans often used the river Danube as a border for their vast empire.

===Ancient cultural perspectives of the lower Danube===
Part of the Danubius or Istros river was also known as (together with the Black Sea) the Okeanos in ancient times, being called the Okeanos Potamos (Okeanos River). The lower Danube was also called the Keras Okeanoio (Gulf or Horn of Okeanos) in the Argonautica by Apollonius Rhodos (Argon. IV. 282). Okeanos was not originally a Greek word (Thalassa being Greek for sea), Okeanos being a Pelasgian word which was similar to eye (ochio) and water (aqua) with the Pelasgian ending an-os, which could have meant large still water (not a sea). The lower Danube has a slow deep wide course, so it can be seen why it was considered as part of the Okeanos.

Both Homer (Odyss. XII. 1) and Hesiod (Theogonia, v.242. 959) in their theogonic legends exclusively refer to the lower Danube as the Okeanos Potamos, possibly due to it being remembered as the remnant of when the Pannonian and lower Danubian basins were under water.

At the end of the Okeanos Potamos, is the holy island of Alba (Leuke, Pytho Nisi, Isle of Snakes), sacred to the Pelasgian (and later, Greek) Apollo, greeting the sun rising in the east. Hecateus Abderitas refers to Apollo's island from the region of the Hyperboreans, in the Okeanos. It was on Leuke, in one version of his legend that the hero Achilles was buried (to this day, one of the mouths of the Danube is called Chilia). Old Romanian folk songs sing of a white monastery on a white island with nine priests.<ref name=Densusianu>[http://www.pelasgians.org ''Dacia Preistorica''], Nicolae Densusianu (1913).</ref>

==Danube Bike Trail==
{{main|Donauradweg}}

The Danube Bike Trail (also called Danube Cycle Path or the ''Donauradweg'') is a bicycle trail along the river.

The Danube Bike Trail (Donauradweg) is divided into four sections:
#[[Donaueschingen]]-[[Passau]] (559&nbsp;km)
#[[Passau]]-[[Vienna]] (340&nbsp;km)
#[[Vienna]]-[[Budapest]] (306&nbsp;km)
#[[Budapest]]-[[Black Sea]] (1670&nbsp;km)

==Cultural significance==
The Danube is mentioned in the title of a famous [[waltz]] by [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[composer]] [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]], ''[[The Blue Danube|An der sch<U+00F6>nen, blauen Donau]]'' (''On the Beautiful Blue Danube'').  This piece was composed as Strauss was traveling down the Danube River.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} This piece is well known across the world and is also used widely as a [[lullaby]].

Another famous [[waltz]] about the Danube is ''[[The Waves of the Danube]]'' ({{lang-ro|Valurile Dun<U+0103>rii}}) by the Romanian composer [[Ion Ivanovici]] (1845<U+2013>1902), and the work took the audience by storm when performed at the 1889 [[Paris Exposition]].

[[Joe Zawinul]] wrote a [[symphony]] about the Danube called ''Stories of the Danube''. It was performed for the first time at the 1993 [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] festival, at [[Linz]].

The Danube figures prominently in the Bulgarian National Anthem, as a symbolic representation of the country's natural beauty.

The German tradition of landscape painting, the [[Danube school]], was developed in the Danube valley in the 16th century.

The most famous book describing the Danube might be [[Claudio Magris]]'s masterpiece ''Danube'' (ISBN 1-86046-823-3).

The historical fiction [[Earth's Children]] series by [[Jean M. Auel]] refers to the Danube as the Great Mother River.

The river is the subject of the film ''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]'' (official site [http://www.theister.com/ here]).

Parts of the German road movie ''[[Im Juli]]'' take place along the Danube.

Noted horror writer [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s most famous short story, "The Willows" concerned a trip down the Danube.

In the [[Personal computer|PC]] Space Simulator ''Freelancer'' the battle cruiser ''Donau'' is destroyed during the first cutscene.

In the [[Star Trek]] universe, a class of spacecraft was named after the Danube.

==Economics==
===Drinking water===
Along its path, the Danube is a source of drinking water for about ten million people. In [[Baden-W<U+00FC>rttemberg]], Germany, almost thirty percent (as of 2004) of the water for the area between [[Stuttgart]], [[Bad Mergentheim]], [[Aalen]] and [[Alb-Donau (district)]] comes from purified water of the Danube. Other cities like [[Ulm]] and [[Passau]] also use some water from the Danube.

In Austria and Hungary, most water comes from ground and spring sources, and only in rare cases is water from the Danube used. Most states also find it too difficult to clean the water because of extensive pollution; only parts of Romania where the water is cleaner still use a lot of drinking water from the Danube. {{Fact|date=March 2009}}

===Navigation and transport===
As [[Pan-European corridors|"Corridor VII"]] of the [[European Union]], the Danube is an important transport route. Since the opening of the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal|Rhine<U+2013>Main<U+2013>Danube Canal]], the river connects the Black Sea with the industrial centers of Western Europe and with the Port of [[Rotterdam]]. The waterway is designed for large scale inland vessels (110<U+00D7>11.45 m) but it can carry much larger vessels on most of its course. The Danube has been partly canalized in Germany (5 locks) and Austria (10 locks). Further proposals to build a number of new locks in order to improve navigation have not progressed, due in part to environmental concerns. 

Downstream from the Freudenau river plant's locks in Vienna, canalization of the Danube was limited to the [[Gab<U+010D><U+00ED>kovo - Nagymaros Dams|Gab<U+010D><U+00ED>kovo dam]] and locks near Bratislava and the two double Iron Gate locks in the border stretch of the Danube between Serbia and Romania. These locks have larger dimensions (similar to the locks in the Russian [[Volga]] river, some 300 by over 30 m). Downstream of the Iron Gate, the river is free flowing all the way to the Black Sea, a distance of more than 860 kilometers.

The Danube connects with the Rhine<U+2013>Main<U+2013>Danube Canal at Kelheim, and with the Wiener Donaukanal in Vienna. Apart from a couple of secondary navigable branches, the only major navigable rivers linked to the Danube are the Drava, Sava and Tisza. In Serbia, a canal network also connects to the river; the network, known as the Dunav-Tisa-Dunav canals, links sections downstream.

===Fishing===
The importance of [[fishing]] on the Danube, which used to be critical in the [[Middle Ages]], has declined dramatically. Some fishermen are still active at certain points on the river, and the [[Danube Delta]] still has an important industry.

===Tourism===
[[Image:Wachau Valley Durnstein.jpg|thumb|right|Wachau Valley near Durnstein.]]
Important tourist and natural spots along the Danube include the [[Wachau]] valley, the [[Nationalpark Donau-Auen]] in Austria, [[Gemenc]] in Hungary, the [[Naturpark Obere Donau]] in Germany, [[Kopa<U+010D>ki rit]] in Croatia, [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]] and [[Danube Delta]] in Romania, the [[Srebarna Nature Reserve]] in Bulgaria.
