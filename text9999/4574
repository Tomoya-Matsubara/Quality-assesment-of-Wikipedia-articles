'''Jim Allenby''' (born 12 September 1982 in [[Perth, Western Australia]]) is an Australian [[cricket]]er. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler.

Allenby began playing senior cricket for [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham CB]], though he only played one game for the team and it was a further three years before he made another first-class or List A appearance. Allenby played one limited overs match during the 2005 season, and his first County Championship appearance, for his new team, [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], a year later, though his debut saw him make little impact with either bat or ball.

Allenby has become a regular player in the Leicestershire middle-order, with one century at first-class level so far under his belt, achieved against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] in his very first County Championship game.

In the English off-season at the start of calendar year 2007 he played one game for [[Western Australia cricket team|Western Australia]], having previously played for their Under-19 team between 2000 and 2002.

On 15 June 2008, Allenby became the first player in [[Twenty20 Cup]] history to achieve four wickets with four consecutive balls, when he removed [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire Lightning]] players [[Kyle Hogg]], [[Steven Croft]], [[Dominic Cork]] and [[Sajid Mahmood]]. Unfortunately for Allenby, he was out for a duck in the Leicestershire innings, as his side lost the match by 37 runs.
