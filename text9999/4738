The {{nihongo|'''Master System'''|<U+30DE><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30B7><U+30B9><U+30C6><U+30E0>|Masut<U+0101> Shisutemu|lead=yes}}, often called the '''Sega Master System''' or '''SMS''', is a [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|third-generation]] [[home video game console]] that was manufactured by [[Sega]].  It was originally released in 1985 as the '''Sega Mark III''' in Japan.  After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America, 1987 in Europe, and 1989 in Brazil.  The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987.  Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play both cartridges and the credit card-sized "[[Sega Card]]s", which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games.

Succeeding the [[SG-1000]], the Master System was released as a direct competitor to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in the third generation of video game consoles. The Master System was constructed with hardware superior to that of the NES, but failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America.  However, it attained more success in Europe and Brazil.  The hardware of the Master System also shared many similarities with Sega's [[handheld game console]], the [[Sega Game Gear]].  Compared to its competition from Nintendo, the Master System's game library lacks a number of well-received titles due to Nintendo's licensing practices that restricted third-party developers from creating games for any system other than the NES.  It is estimated the console sold between 10 and 13 million units over its lifetime, compared to the 62 million NES units sold.  Reception to the system given in retrospect gives credit to the system's role in Sega's development of the [[Sega Genesis]], but criticizes its shallow game library.

==History==
===Background===
In the early 1980s, [[Sega|Sega Enterprises, Inc.]], then a subsidiary of the conglomerate [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf and Western]], was one of the largest [[arcade game]] manufacturers active in the United States, with company revenues of $214 million by mid-1982.<ref>{{Cite journal| url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1994-02-20/sega| title=Sega! | journal=[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]|date=February 20, 1994| accessdate=October 10, 2013| first1=Richard| last1=Brandt|first2=Neil|last2=Gross|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}</ref>  A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 negatively impacted the company, leading Gulf and Western to sell the North American manufacturing and licensing of its arcade games to [[Bally Manufacturing]].<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news |title=What's New In Video Games; Taking the Zing Out of the Arcade Boom |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/business/what-s-new-in-video-games-taking-the-zing-out-of-the-arcade-boom.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 24, 1982 |accessdate=November 27, 2013| first=Andrew| last=Pollack}}</ref><ref name="herald">{{cite news |title=The Bottom Line |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:MIHB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB35D5F24528A22&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0ECC86DE7A4704AD |newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]] {{subscription required|via=[[NewsBank]]}}|date=August 27, 1983 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref>  The company retained its Japanese subsidiary, Sega of Japan, as well as Sega's North American research and development division.

===Development===

For the console's North America release, Sega restyled and rebranded the Mark III under the name "Master System", similar to Nintendo's own reworking of the Famicom into the Nintendo Entertainment System. The "Master System" name was one of several proposals Sega's American employees considered, and was ultimately chosen by throwing darts against a whiteboard, although plans to release a cheaper console similarly referred to as the "Base System" also influenced the decision. Sega Enterprises Chairman [[Isao Okawa]] endorsed the name after being told it was a reference to the competitive nature of both the video game industry and martial arts, in which only one competitor can be the "Master".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bruce Lowry: The Man That Sold the NES|journal=[[Game Informer]]|issue=110|volume=12|date=June 2002|pages=102<U+2013>103|publisher=[[GameStop]]}}</ref>  The futuristic final design for the Master System was intended to appeal to Western tastes.<ref name="Edge">{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/a-history-of-videogame-hardware-sega-master-system/|author=Parkin, Simon|title=A history of video game hardware: Sega Master System|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=September 13, 2014|publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]}}</ref>

===Launch===
Sega released the Mark III in Japan in October 1985 at a price of <U+00A5>15,000.<ref name="MK3">{{cite web|title=Mark III|publisher=Sega of Japan|language=Japanese|url=http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/mk3/|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> Despite featuring technically more powerful hardware than its chief competition, the Famicom, the Mark III did not prove to be successful at its launch.  Difficulties arose from Nintendo's licensing practices with third-party developers at the time, whereby Nintendo required that titles for the Famicom not be published on other consoles.  To overcome this, Sega developed its own titles and obtained the rights to [[Porting|port]] games from other developers, albeit the ports sold with little success.  [[NEC]] later used the same strategy on some of Sega's titles when developing games for the [[TurboGrafx-16]].<ref name="Retroinspection"/> In preparation for the launch, [[Mark Cerny]] has stated that "pressure was very, very high", with a typical game being allotted only three months of development time.<ref name="Cerny" />

After being restyled the "Master System", the console was released in North America in 1986 at a price of [[United States dollar|US$]]200, and it included a [[multicart]] of the games ''[[Hang-On]]'' and ''[[Safari Hunt]]''.<ref name="Allgame">{{cite web|author=Beuscher, David|title=Sega Master System - Overview|publisher=[[AllGame]]|accessdate=March 31, 2014|url=http://allgame.com/platform.php?id=23}}</ref>  However, as in Japan, the Master System in North America also suffered from a poorly received game library compared to its competition.  Against Nintendo's licensing practices, Sega had only managed to gain two third-party developers to their side: [[Activision]] and [[Parker Brothers]].<ref name="Retroinspection"/>  By 1988, Nintendo commanded 83 percent of the North American video game market share.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/business/nintendo-scores-big.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=Nintendo Scores Big |publisher=The New York Times |date=December 4, 1988 |accessdate=March 27, 2009 | first=Douglas C. | last=McGill}}</ref>  Marketing for the Master System was targeted at bringing home the arcade experience, but Sega's marketing department at the time was run by only two men, giving Sega a disadvantage in advertising.<ref name="Edge"/>  At this time, Sega sold the distribution rights for the Master System in the United States to [[Tonka]], which did not have any previous experience with electronic entertainment systems.  Some of Tonka's decisions with the Master System included blocking [[Game localization|localization]] of several popular video game titles.  Though the distributor of the console had changed, the Master System continued to perform poorly.  The console was re-released as the Master System in Japan in October 1987 for <U+00A5>16,800.<ref name="MS">{{cite web|title=Master System|publisher=Sega of Japan|language=Japanese|accessdate=March 31, 2014|url=http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/master/}}</ref> However, similar to the Mark III, this launch was not successful.<ref name="Retroinspection"/>  The console in neither of its forms posed a serious challenge to Nintendo in Japan.<ref name="business_japan">{{cite journal|title=Amusement|journal=Business Japan|year=1986|volume=31|issue=7-12|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tJcSAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Sega+is+estimated+to+have+sold%22&dq=%22Sega+is+estimated+to+have+sold%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CM8eT7m8JonLsgbPpdnHDA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|accessdate=24 January 2012|author=Nihon K<U+014D>gy<U+014D> Shinbunsha|page=89|publisher=Nihon Kogyo Shimbun}}</ref>

The European launch of the Master System occurred in 1987.  It was distributed by [[Virgin Mastertronic|Mastertronic]] in the United Kingdom, Master Games in France, and [[Bertelsmann]] in Germany.<ref name="Virgin Games">{{cite journal|author=Hewison, Richard|title=From the Archives: Virgin Games, Part 1|journal=Retro Gamer|publisher=Imagine Publishing|pages=50<U+2013>55|issue=84|issn=1742-3155|location=London, UK}}</ref>  Mastertronic advertised the Master System as "an arcade in the home" and launched the system at [[Pound sterling|GB<U+20A4>]]99.  Advance orders from retailers were high, but Sega proved unable to deliver inventory until [[Boxing Day]] on December 26, causing many retailers to cancel their orders.  As a result, Master Games and Mastertronic both entered financial crises and Bertelsmann vowed never to work with Sega again.  Mastertronic had already sold a minority interest to [[Richard Branson]] and the Virgin group to enter the console business and now sold the remainder of the company to avoid bankruptcy.  The newly rebranded Virgin Mastertronic then took over all European distribution in 1988.<ref name="Virgin Games"/>  Virgin Mastertronic consequently focused marketing the Master System on ports of Sega's arcade games and positioning it as a superior alternative to the [[Commodore 64]] and the [[ZX Spectrum]] home computers in terms of video games.  As a result of this marketing and of Nintendo's less effective approaches in Europe, the Master System began to attract European-based developers.<ref name="classics">{{cite web|author=McFerran, Damien|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/07/hardware_classics_sega_master_system|title=Hardware Classics: Sega Master System|publisher=Nintendo Life|date=July 22, 2014|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref>  The Master System held a significant part of the video game console market in Europe through the release of Sega's succeeding console, the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]].  Brazil was also a successful market for the Master System, where the console was released in 1989 and distributed by [[Tectoy]].<ref name="Retroinspection"/><ref name="classics"/>

===Transition to Sega Genesis and decline===
[[Image:Sega-Mega-Drive-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|Mega Drive, known as Sega Genesis in North America, succeeded the Master System|alt=A picture of a Japanese Mega Drive]]
Sega released the Mega Drive, a [[16-bit]] video game console, in Japan on October 29, 1988.<ref name="RetroinspectionMD">{{cite journal|journal=Retro Gamer|publisher=Imagine Publishing|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|author=Sczepaniak, John|issue=27|year=2006|pages=42<U+2013>47|issn=1742-3155|location=London, UK}}</ref>  The final commercial release for the Mark III and Master System in Japan was ''[[Bomber Raid]]'' in 1989.<ref name="Retroinspection"/>  During the same year, Sega was preparing to release the new Mega Drive, relabeled as the "Sega Genesis", in North America.  Displeased with Tonka's handling of the Master System, Sega reacquired the marketing and distribution rights to the Master System for the United States.  In 1990, Sega released the remodeled Master System II, designed to be a lower-cost version of the console which also removed the Sega Card slot.<ref name="Retroinspection"/><ref name="Allgame"/>  Sega promoted the new model themselves, but the console still sold poorly in the region despite Tonka no longer being involved with the Master System's marketing.<ref name="Retroinspection"/>  In 1991, Nintendo was found guilty of violating [[United States antitrust law]] and forced to abandon some of its licensing practices, but the Master System had already been in decline long before.

Physically, the Master System measures {{convert|365|x|170|x|70|mm|in}},<ref name="MSspecs">{{cite web|title=Master System data|publisher=Sega of Japan|language=Japanese|url=http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/master/data.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref> while the Mark III measures {{convert|318|x|145|x|52|mm|in}}.<ref name="MK3specs">{{cite web|title=Mark III data|publisher=Sega of Japan|language=Japanese|url=http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/mk3/data.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>  Both the Mark III and the Master System possess two slots for game input: one for cartridges and one for [[Sega Card]]s, along with an expansion slot and 2 controller ports.<ref name="MK3specs"/><ref name="MSspecs"/> Sound is provided by the [[SN76489]] [[Programmable sound generator|PSG]] chip. The Japanese version also integrates the [[YM2413]] [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM]] chip,<ref name="MSspecs"/> which had been an optional feature on the Mark III.  With few exceptions, Master System hardware is identical to the hardware in the Mark III.  Titles for the console are playable on the Sega Genesis by use of an accessory known as the Power Base Converter,<ref name="Retroinspection"/> as well as on the Game Gear by use of the Master System Converter.<ref name="RetroGamer"/>

The Master System was designed with superior hardware when compared to the NES.  It contains twice as much memory as its competitor from Nintendo.<ref name="Edge"/>  The CPU of the Master System runs at a faster speed than the processor in the NES, which is a [[Ricoh 2A03|Ricoh NMOS 6502]] running at 1.79&nbsp;MHz.  The NES is capable of displaying 25 colors at a time from a master palette of 54, in contrast to the 32 colors at a time from a 64 color master palette on the Master System.<ref name="MSspecs"/>

A number of accessories were created for the Mark III and Master System, which are cross-compatible with one another.  The controller for each console consists of a rectangular shape with a control pad and two buttons.  Sega also introduced additional controllers, such as a bike handle controller and paddle controller, for the Mark III and a special sports controller for the Master System.  A pair of [[Active shutter 3D system|3D glasses]] known as SegaScope 3D were also created for games such as ''[[Space Harrier 3-D|Space Harrier 3D]]'',<ref name="Allgame"/> although Mark III users need an additional converter to use them.  The Mark III also had an optional RF transmitter accessory, allowing wireless play that broadcast the game being played on a [[UHF]] television signal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Master System peripherals|publisher=Sega of Japan|language=Japanese|accessdate=March 31, 2014|url=http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/master/peri.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mark III peripherals|publisher=Sega of Japan|language=Japanese|accessdate=March 31, 2014|url=http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/mk3/peri.html}}</ref>  A [[light gun]] peripheral known as the Light Phaser was also released.<ref name="Allgame"/>  Its design was based on the weapon of the same name from the Japanese anime ''[[Zillion (anime)|Zillion]]''.<ref name="retrogamer_tectoy"/>

The Master System was produced in several variations.  Released in 1990, the Master System II removed a number of components in order to reduce the cost of the console, including the Sega Card slot, reset button, power light, expansion port, and activation music and logo upon turning on the system.<ref name="Allgame"/>  Several licensed variations of the console also exist in Brazil, created by Tectoy.  A variation known as the Master System 3 Compact was capable of functioning wirelessly with an RF transmitter, while Tectoy also sought to appeal to female gamers in Brazil with the Master System Girl, which was molded in bright pink plastic.  A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil known as the Master System 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games.<ref name="retrogamer_tectoy"/>  Another Master System, built as a [[handheld game console]], was released under several brands including [[Coleco]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ransom-Wiley, James|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/10/26/coleco-tiptoes-back-with-sega-filled-handheld |title=Coleco Tiptoes Back with Sega-filled Handheld |publisher=[[Joystiq]] | date=October 26, 2006  |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}</ref>

{{See also|List of Master System games}}
Games for the Master System are in two formats: [[ROM cartridge]]s are capable of holding up to 1048 [[kilobit|kbit]] of game code, while [[Sega Card]]s can hold up to 256 kbit.  Cards were cheaper to manufacture than the cartridges and included titles such as ''[[Spy vs. Spy (1984 video game)|Spy vs. Spy]]'' and ''Super Tennis'',<ref name="Retroinspection"/><ref name="Allgame"/> but Sega Cards were eventually dropped due to their lack of memory.  Some games manufactured for the system include ''[[Psycho Fox]]'', ''Golvellius'', and ''[[Phantasy Star (video game)|Phantasy Star]]'', which became a successful franchise for Sega and is considered one of the benchmark [[role-playing games]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Semrad|first=Steve|url=http://www.1up.com/features/egm-200-greatest-videogames?pager.offset=8|title=The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time, Page 8|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=February 2, 2006|accessdate=June 23, 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121020122027/http://www.1up.com/features/egm-200-greatest-videogames?pager.offset=8|archivedate=October 20, 2012}}</ref>   The Master System also hosts games featuring Sega's flagship character at the time, [[Alex Kidd]], including ''[[Alex Kidd in Miracle World]]''. ''[[Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap]]'' has garnered recognition as "a genuine milestone in video game design" due to its innovative blend of platforming gameplay with RPG elements.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mott|first=Tony|title=[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]|year=2013|publisher=Universe Publishing|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-7893-2090-2|page=177}}</ref> Built-in titles are common in Master System hardware, including ''[[Snail Maze]]'' and ''Hang-On'', as well as ''Alex Kidd in Miracle World'' and ''Sonic the Hedgehog''.  Additional titles were also released in Brazil by Tectoy, including ports of ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' and ''[[Dynamite Headdy]]'' after the Master System was discontinued elsewhere.<ref name="Retroinspection"/>

Overall, the game library has been criticized for its lack of depth.  ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' compared new Sega titles to "drops of water in the desert".<ref name="cgw198811">{{cite news | title=Video Gaming World | work=[[Computer Gaming World]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] | date=November 1988 | last1=Kunkel |first1=Bill |last2=Worley |first2=Joyce |last3=Katz |first3=Arnie | page=54 |issn=0744-6667}}</ref>  Due to Nintendo's licensing practices, few third-party developers contributed games for the Master System.  According to Damien McFerran, "Nintendo requested that developers keep their games 'NES exclusive', and given the unassailable position the console enjoyed, few had the will to defy this request."<ref name="Retroinspection"/> In addition, according to game designer [[Mark Cerny]], most of Sega's early Master System titles were developed within a strict three-month deadline, which negatively impacted game quality.<ref name="Cerny">{{cite web|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2006/12/interview-mark-cerny/|title=Interview: Mark Cerny|publisher=Sega-16|date=December 5, 2006|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Guardian Sonic">{{cite web|last=Parkin|first=Simon|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/13/sonic-the-hedgehog-sonic-lost-world|title=Sonic the Hedgehog: past, present and future|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=June 6, 2014|quote=They made 40 games in this way&nbsp;...But by my judgment only two were really worth playing.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|title=A Candid Talk With Mark Cerny, Who Designed The PS4, Among Other Things|url=http://kotaku.com/a-candid-talk-with-mark-cerny-who-designed-the-ps4-am-1540179832|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=March 10, 2014|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>  Titles for the Master System, however, did take advantage of the advanced hardware of the console in comparison to the NES; ''Alex Kidd in Miracle World'', for example, showcases "blistering colors and more detailed sprites" than competing NES games.<ref name="AKinMW">{{cite web|title=Alex Kidd in Miracle World Review|author=Buchanan, Levi|publisher=IGN|accessdate=March 31, 2014|date=January 25, 2008|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/25/alex-kidd-in-miracle-world-review-2}}</ref><ref>cf. {{cite book|last=Mott|first=Tony|title=1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die|year=2013|publisher=Universe Publishing|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-7893-2090-2|page=108}}</ref> In addition, the Master System version of ''[[R-Type]]'' has garnered retrospective praise for its quality, with its visuals considered comparable to those found in the TurboGrafx-16 port of the same title.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Retro Reviews: R-Type|journal=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|issue=114|volume=12|date=October 2002|page=114}}</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
Sales of the Master System during its lifetime are estimated between 10 million and 13 million units worldwide, in contrast to the 62 million units sold by its chief competitor, the Famicom.<ref name="encyclopedia"/><ref name="GENSNES">{{cite web|title=Genesis vs. SNES: By the Numbers|author=Buchanan, Levi|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=March 31, 2014|date=March 20, 2009|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/03/20/genesis-vs-snes-by-the-numbers}}</ref>  This was a difference of 49 million units, but Sega would later close the market share gap between itself and Nintendo in the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|next generation]] with the release of the Genesis, which sold 40 million consoles compared to the 49 million [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] consoles sold by Nintendo.<ref name="RetroSonic2">{{cite journal|journal=Retro Gamer <U+2014> The Mega Drive Book|title=Sonic Boom: The Success Story of Sonic the Hedgehog|page=31|author=|publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=London, UK|year=2013|issn=1742-3155}}</ref>  The Master System saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil than it did in Japan and North America.<ref name="Retroinspection"/>  In 1989, the Sega Master System was listed in the top 20 products of [[NPD Group]]'s Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service.<ref name="retailers">{{cite journal|author=Leccesse, Donna|title=Retailers say video is a dream come true; Nintendo is leading the way to better sales.|journal=Playthings|publisher=Sandow Media LLC.|date=May 5, 1989|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-7613047.html|via=[[HighBeam Research]]{{subscription required}}}}</ref>  However, reception in 1992 by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' indicated a souring interest in the console.  Four reviewers scored the console 5, 4, 5, and 5 out of a possible 10 points each in the magazine's 1992 Buyer's Guide, focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality titles for the Master System.<ref name="egmbuyersguide1992">{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |author= Steve, Ed, Martin, and Sushi-X|date=January 1992  |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |publisher=EGM Media LLC |volume= |issue= |pages= 74|id= |url= |quote= }}</ref>  By 1993, reviewers scored the console 2, 2, 3, and 3 out of 10, noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases.<ref name="egmbuyersguide1993">{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |author= Steve, Ed, Martin, and Sushi-X|date=January 1993  |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide |journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly |publisher=EGM Media LLC |volume= |issue= |pages= 32|id= |url= |quote= }}</ref>  According to Bill Pearse of ''Playthings'', the NES gained an advantage over the Master System through the use of better software and stronger character identification.<ref name="playthings">{{cite journal|author=Pearse, Bill|title=Nintendo and Sega gear up for battle.

Retrospective feedback of the console praises its support toward development of the Sega Genesis, but recognizes its game library as its biggest fault.  Writing for [[AllGame]], Dave Beuscher notes that "it was doomed by the lack of third party software support and all but disappeared from the American market by 1992."<ref name="Allgame"/>  Damien McFerran of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' recognizes its value to the future success of the Genesis, stating, "Without this criminally undervalued machine, Sega would not have enjoyed the considerable success it had with the Mega Drive.  The Master System allowed Sega to experiment with arcade conversions, original [[intellectual property|IP]] and even create a mascot in the form of the lovable monkey-boy Alex Kidd."<ref name="Retroinspection"/>  In 2009, the Master System was named the 20th best video game console of all time by the video gaming website [[IGN]], behind both of its main competitors, the [[Atari 7800]] (ranked 17th best) and the Nintendo Entertainment System (1st). They cited the Master System's small games library, coupled with the highly uneven quality of the few games that were released, as the console's major issues, stating, "Months could go by between major releases and that made a dud on the Master System feel even more painful."<ref name="top25">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/20.html|title=Top 25 Videogame Consoles of All Time: SEGA Master System is Number 20|publisher=IGN|accessdate=March 31, 2014|year=2009}}</ref>

The Master System and its software still retains some popularity.  According to IGN, "Despite its narrow mass audience, the Master System had<U+2014>and still has<U+2014>a very loyal fan base."<ref name="top25"/>  In 2005, Sega reached a deal with Chinese company AtGames to release Master System software in the form of emulation products in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.<ref name="AtGames">{{cite journal|title=Sega expands distribution in Greater China.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133132727.html|journal=Screen Digest|date=March 1, 2005|via=HighBeam Research{{subscription required}}}}</ref>  A number of Master System games are available for download on [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in North America, PAL territories and Japan. The first game released for this service was ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', on February 26, 2008, and later, ''[[Fantasy Zone]]'', released on March 11. Both were released in Japan. In North America, ''[[Wonder Boy (video game)|Wonder Boy]]'' was the first Master System game released for the service on March 31, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/4uQJLEZJ2G__3IJq5TXii66HmIjir-lJ |title=Cruis'n USA and Wonder Boy Now Available on Wii Shop Channel!|publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=March 15, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723150857/http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/4uQJLEZJ2G__3IJq5TXii66HmIjir-lJ|archivedate=July 23, 2008}}</ref>  Master System games have also been made available via the [[GameTap]] online service.<ref name="game tap">{{cite news|author=Leupold, Tom|title=Games on tap, or 'History of the Gaming World, Part I'|newspaper=[[Oakland Tribune]]|date=February 3, 2006|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7039983.html|via=HighBeam Research{{subscription required}}}}</ref>
