'''Juan D'Vaughn Pierre''' (born August 14, 1977 in [[Mobile, Alabama]]) is an [[outfielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who plays for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He bats and throws [[left-handed]].

Pierre, who was named for [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[pitcher]] [[Juan Marichal]], went to high school at Alexandria Senior High School in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].

==College==
Prior to his professional career, he played at [[Galveston College]] and the [[University of South Alabama]], where he was {{by|1998}} [[Sun Belt Conference]] Player of the Year.

==Minor leagues==
Pierre began his professional career with the [[Portland Rockies]] of the [[Northwest League]], after being selected by [[Colorado Rockies|Colorado]] in the 13th round of the [[1998 MLB Draft]]. He won the league [[Batting average|batting]] and [[stolen base]] titles in his first professional season, and was a fan favorite even at that level. Pierre began {{by|2000}} with the [[Carolina Mudcats]] before finishing the year in Colorado.

==Major leagues==
===Colorado Rockies===
Pierre made his major league debut on August 7, 2000, as a [[pinch runner]] for the Rockies against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. He made his first start in [[center field]] the following day and got his first [[Hit (baseball)|hit]] in the first inning off [[Jose Silva]].

===Florida Marlins===
On November 16, {{by|2002}}, Pierre was traded along with [[Mike Hampton]] and cash to the [[Florida Marlins]] for [[Charles Johnson (baseball)|Charles Johnson]], [[Preston Wilson]], [[Vic Darensbourg]], and [[Pablo Ozuna]].

In the 2003 regular season, Pierre posted a .305 batting average, led the NL in [[games played]] (162), [[at-bat]]s (668), stolen bases (65), and [[sacrifice hit]]s (15), and led the majors with the lowest [[strikeout]] percentage (5.2%),<ref name="Advanced">{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=1&season=2004|title=Baseball Leaderboard - Advanced - Fan Graphs - 2004|accessdate=2007-08-20|publisher=Fan Graphs}}</ref> During the post-season, he was a major contributor to the Marlins' [[2003 World Series]] championship. He batted .333 in the World Series and .301 overall in his first playoff experience.

In 2004, he led the National League in at bats (for the second year in a row) with 678; hits (221); [[Triple (baseball)|triples]] (12); games played (162); [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] hits (24)<ref name="Batted Ball">{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=2&season=2004|title=Baseball Leaderboard - Batted Ball - Fan Graphs - 2004|accessdate=2007-08-20|publisher=Fan Graphs}}</ref>; infield hits (38);<ref name="Batted Ball"/>(5.2%).<ref name="Advanced"/> In addition, he was the only major league player to play every inning of each of his team's games.

In {{by|2005}}, Pierre led the National League in games played (162), and had the third-lowest strikeout percentage in baseball (6.9%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=1&season=2005|title=Baseball Leaderboard - Advanced - Fan Graphs - 2005|accessdate=2007-08-20|publisher=Fan Graphs}}</ref>

===Chicago Cubs===
On December 7, 2005, the Marlins traded Pierre to the [[Chicago Cubs]], receiving [[pitcher]]s [[Sergio Mitre]], [[Ricky Nolasco]], and [[Renyel Pinto]] in exchange. The deal was motivated by the Marlins' need to cut payroll after finding itself unable to secure a new stadium deal in [[South Florida]].

In 2006, despite batting only .292, Pierre led the NL with 204 hits, winning his second hit title, and in at-bats (699), games played (162), bunt hits (21), infield hits (30),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=2&season=2006|title=Baseball Leaderboard - Batted Ball - 2006 - Fan Graphs - 2006|accessdate=2007-08-20|publisher=Fan Graphs}}</ref> and in lowest strikeout percentage (5.4%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=1&season=2006|title=Baseball Leaderboard - Advanced - Fan Graphs - 2006|accessdate=2007-08-20|publisher=Fan Graphs}}</ref> He also played perfect defensive baseball, earning a [[fielding percentage]] of 1.000. However, he also led the major leagues in outs made (532), the second-highest out total for a player since {{by|1982}}.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On November 22, 2006, Pierre signed a $44 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers<ref>[http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061122&content_id=1745557&vkey=news_la&fext=.jsp&c_id=la The Official Site of The Los Angeles Dodgers: News: Top-heavy Dodgers sign Pierre<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. 

[[Image:Ethier Andruw Pierre.jpg|thumb|left|Pierre (right) with Dodgers teammates [[Andre Ethier]] and [[Andruw Jones]] in 2008.]]
In {{by|2007}}, Pierre led the majors in bunt hits (19). He also led the NL in games played (162) for the 5th straight year, and [[Single (baseball)|singles]] (164) for the second straight year, led the league in sacrifice hits (20), and had the lowest strikeout percentage in the NL (5.5%),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=1&season=2007|title=Baseball Leaderboard - Advanced - Fan Graphs - 2007|accessdate=2007-08-20|publisher=Fan Graphs}}</ref>. He was 2nd in the NL in stolen bases (64), 3rd in at bats (668) and plate appearances (729), 4th in hits (196), and 9th in triples (8).

Going into {{by|2008}}, the Dodgers signed [[Andruw Jones]] to a two-year contract to play center field. Because of this, Pierre shifted to [[left fielder|left field]]. After a trip to the [[Disabled list|DL]] in July, Pierre was moved into a platoon in center field with the struggling Jones. When the Dodgers traded for [[Manny Ramirez]], Pierre moved to the bench and saw limited action, primarily as a pinch runner the rest of the season.

After nearly 2 years without hitting a home run, Pierre hit a ball into the right field seats at [[PNC Park]] in [[Pittsburgh]] on September 15, 2008. It was Pierre's first traditional fly ball home run since August 28, 2006, also in Pittsburgh.


Pierre became a fan favorite early in his career because of his speed, durability, and work ethic. He led the [[National League]] in stolen bases in {{by|2001}} and {{by|2003}}, and stole at least 45 bases each year from 2001 to 2006; because of his great speed and ability for [[contact hitter|contact hitting]], many believe he is one of the best [[leadoff batter|leadoff]] hitters in baseball. Critics are quick to point out that, in contrast to a prototypical leadoff hitter, Pierre rarely [[Base on balls|walks]] and must hit for a high average to sustain a high [[on-base percentage]], which Pierre has not accomplished since {{by|2004}}. His [[slugging percentage]] is also below average due to his inability to collect [[extra-base hit]]s. His most glaring weakness is his lack of [[home run]]s, with only 12 for his entire career and with two different seasons of none whatsoever.
