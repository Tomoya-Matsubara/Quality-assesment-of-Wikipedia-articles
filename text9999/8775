'''Adelino da Palma Carlos''', [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|GCC]], [[Order of Infante D. Henrique|GCIH]], [[Order of the Freedom|GOL]], [[Pronunciation|pron.]] {{IPA2|{{IPA|<U+0250>d<U+0268>'linu d<U+0250> 'pa<U+026B>m<U+0250> 'ka<U+027E>lu<U+0283>}}}}, (Faro, [[May 3]], [[1905]]&ndash; Lisbon, [[October 27]], [[1992]]) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] lawyer and [[politician]]. He was an opponent to the fascist regime of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo (New State)]] of [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Oliveira Salazar]] (and later [[Marcelo Caetano]]) since his youth, and, being a [[liberal]], rather than a [[socialist]], was chosen by [[List of Presidents of Portugal|President]] [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Sp<U+00ED>nola]], as the first [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|prime-minister]], after the [[Carnation Revolution|April 25, 1974 revolution]].

As an independent, his 1st Provisional Government, which was in power from [[May 15]] to [[July 17]], [[1974]], had members of the then center-left [[Partido Social Democrata|Popular Democratic Party]], the [[Partido Socialista|Socialist Party]] and even the [[Portuguese Communist Party]], and also Armed Force Movement officers. The ideological diversity of the government seems to be one of the reasons it didn't last, being the main one, the refusal of the anticipated presidential elections, in the same year, before the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1975|Constituent Assembly election, 1975]]. 
He was replaced by then [[colonel]] [[Vasco Gon<U+00E7>alves]], a choice that [[general]] Sp<U+00ED>nola latter would regret.
After leaving office, Palma Carlos never got involved in politics again.
