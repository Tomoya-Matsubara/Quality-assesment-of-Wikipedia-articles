==Therapeutic uses==
Following its discovery in the late 1800s, theobromine was put to use by 1916, where it was recommended by the publication ''Principles of Medical Treatment'' as a treatment for [[edema]] (excessive liquid in parts of the body), [[syphilis|syphilitic]] [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attacks, and degenerative angina.<ref name="princimedtreat-1916>{{cite book | title=Principles of medical treatment | author=George Cheever Shattuck | page=15, 39, 41 | year=1916 | publisher=W.M. Leonard }}</ref> ''The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'' notes that theobromine was once used as a treatment for other circulatory problems including [[arteriosclerosis]], certain [[vascular disease]]s, [[angina pectoris]], and [[hypertension]].<ref name="AJCN">{{cite journal | title=Effects of theobromine should be considered in future studies | last=Kelly | first=Caleb J | year=2005 | month=August | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | page=486-8 | volume=82 | issue=2 }}</ref>

In modern [[medicine]], theobromine is used as a [[vasodilator]] (a blood vessel widener), an [[diuretic|aid in urinating]], and [[myocardium|heart]] [[stimulant]].<ref name="dictbiochem1943">{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Bio-Chemistry and Related Subjects | author=William Marias Malisoff | year=1943 | publisher=Philosophical Library | pages=311, 530, 573 | isbn = B0006AQ0NU}}</ref> In addition, the future use of theobromine in such fields as [[cancer]] prevention has been patented.<ref>{{ref patent | number=6693104 | title=Theobromine with an anti-carcinogenic activity | gdate=2004-02-17 | country=US }}</ref>

Theobromine has also been used in [[teratology|birth defect]] experiments involving [[mouse|mice]] and [[rabbit]]s. A decreased [[fetus|fetal]] weight was noted in rabbits following [[forced feeding]], but not after other administration of theobromine. Birth defects were not seen in rats.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rambali B, Andel I van, Schenk E, Wolterink G, Werken G van de, Stevenson H, Vleeming W | title=[The contribution of cocoa additive to cigarette smoking addiction] | journal=RIVM  | year=2002 | url=http://rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/650270002.pdf | format=PDF | issue=report 650270002/2002}}- The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Netherlands)</ref>

==Pharmacology==
In the human liver, theobromine is metabolized into [[methylxanthine]] and subsequently into [[methyluric acid]].<ref>{{cite paper | title=A Study of the Metabolism of Theobromine, Theophylline, and Caffeine in Man | author=Herbert H. Cornish and A. A. Christman | date=1957 | publisher=Department of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, University of Michigan | city=Ann Arbor, Michigan }}</ref>

As a methylated xanthine, theobromine is a potent [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) [[phosphodiesterase inhibitor]];<ref name="omd-xanthine"/> this means that it helps prevent the enzyme phosphodiesterase from converting the active cAMP to an inactive form.<ref name="omd-pdaseinhibitor">* {{cite web | url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?phosphodiesterase | title=Phosphodiesterase | publisher=On-Line Medical Dictionary | accessdate=2007-02-23 }}
* {{cite web | url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?inhibitors | title=Inhibitor | publisher=On-Line Medical Dictionary | accessdate=2007-02-23 }}</ref>  Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate works as a [[second messenger]] in many [[hormone]]- and [[neurotransmitter]]-controlled metabolic systems, such as the breakdown of [[glycogen]].  When the inactivation of cAMP is inhibited by a compound such as theobromine, the effects of the neurotransmitter or hormone which stimulated the production of cAMP are much longer lived.  The net result is generally a stimulatory effect.<ref name="lehningerbiochem">{{cite book | title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | author=David L. Nelson, Michael M. Cox | year=2005 | publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company | pages=435<U+2013>439 | isbn = 0716743396 }}</ref>

While theobromine and caffeine are similar in that they are related alkaloids, theobromine has a lesser impact on the human [[central nervous system]] and it stimulates the heart to a greater degree.<ref name="sexualodyssey">{{cite book | author=Kenneth Maxwell | title=A Sexual Odyssey: From Forbidden Fruit to Cybersex | publisher=Plenum | location=New York | year=1996 | pages=38-40 | isbn = 030645405X }}</ref> While theobromine is not as addictive, it has been cited as possibly causing [[addiction]] to chocolate.<ref name="cocoachocolate">{{cite book | author=William Gervase Clarence-Smith| title=Cocoa and Chocolate, 1765-1914 | year=2000 | publisher=Routledge | location=London | pages=10, 31 | isbn = 0415215765 }}</ref> ''A Sexual Odyssey: From Forbidden Fruit to Cybersex'' discusses how chocolate's alleged aphrodisiac effects may be caused by a number of factors. These include the stimulative effects of theobromine, pleasure induced by the [[hypothalamus]] as an effect of chocolate's sweet and fatty nature, or how chocolate affects the levels of [[serotonin]]. While serotonin has a pleasurable effect, in high concentrations it can be converted to [[melatonin]] which in large amounts reduces sexual drive.<ref name="sexualodyssey"/>

As it is a myocardial stimulant as well as a vasodilator, it increases heartbeat, yet it also dilates blood vessels, causing a reduced [[blood pressure]].<ref name="arecapatent">{{ref patent | country=US | number=20050089584 | title=Methods and compositions for oral delivery of Areca and mate' or theobromine | gdate=2005-04-28 }}</ref> However, a recent paper published suggested that the decrease in blood pressure may be caused by flavanols.<ref name="AJCN"/> Furthermore, its draining effect allows it to be used to treat [[cardiac failure]], which can be caused by an excessive accumulation of fluid.<ref name="arecapatent"/>

A 2005 study published by [[Imperial College London]] concluded that theobromine has an [[antitussive]] (cough-reducing) effect superior to [[codeine]] by suppressing [[vagus nerve]] activity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Usmani O | coauthors = Belvisi M, Patel H, Crispino N, Birrell M, Korbonits M, Korbonits D, Barnes P | title = Theobromine inhibits sensory nerve activation and cough. | journal = FASEB J | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 231-3 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15548587}}</ref> Additionally, theobromine is helpful in treating [[asthma]] since it relaxes the [[smooth muscles]], including the ones found in the [[bronchi]].<ref name="asthma">{{cite book | author=Irwin J. Polk | title=All about Asthma: Stop Suffering and Start Living | year=1997 | location=New York | publisher=Insight Books | pages=100 | isbn = 0306455692 }}</ref>

There is a possible association between theobromine and an increased risk of suffering from [[prostate cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Slattery M, West D | title = Smoking, alcohol, coffee, tea, caffeine, and theobromine: risk of prostate cancer in Utah (United States). | journal = Cancer Causes Control | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 559-63 | year = 1993 | id = PMID 8280834}}</ref>

Theobromine can cause sleeplessness, tremors, restlessness, anxiety, as well as contribute to [[diuresis|increased production of urine]].<ref name="asthma"/> Additional side effects include [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]].<ref name="biam">{{cite web | url=http://www.biam2.org/www1/Sub1331.html | title=Theobromine | publisher=BIAM | language=French | date=2000-03-29 | accessdate=2007-06-10 }}</ref>

===Animals===
The amount of theobromine found in chocolate is small enough that it can be safely consumed by [[human]]s, but animals that [[metabolize]] theobromine more slowly, such as [[dog]]s, can succumb to [[theobromine poisoning]] from as little as 50 grams of chocolate for a smaller dog and 400 grams for an average-sized dog. Complications include digestive issues, dehydration, excitability, and a slow heart rate. Later stages of theobromine poisoning include [[epilepsy|epileptic]]-like [[seizure]]s and death. If caught early on, theobromine poisoning is treatable.<ref name="healthwatchcanines">{{harvard reference | title=HEALTH WATCH: How to Avoid a Canine Chocolate Catastrophe! | newspaper=The News Letter | location=Belfast, Northern Ireland | date=2005-03-01}}</ref>

===Other===
Theobromine is known to induce [[gene]] [[mutation]]s in lower [[eukaryote]]s and [[bacterium|bacteria]].  At the time of a [[1997]] report by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], genetic mutations had not been found in higher eukaryotes, such as humans.<ref>{{cite web | author=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] | title=Volume 51: Coffee, Tea, Mate, Methylxanthines and Methylglyoxal - Theobromine | url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol51/volume51.pdf | format=PDF | work=IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans | publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] | date=November 17, 1991 | accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref>
