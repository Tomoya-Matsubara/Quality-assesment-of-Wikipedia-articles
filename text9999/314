The '''Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy''' was a principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Princely power was exercised by the [[Benedictine]] abbot of the imperial double monastery of [[Stavelot]] and [[Malmedy]], founded in 651. At {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}}, it was the second-smallest territory in the Empire, after the [[Duchy of Bouillon]] at {{convert|140|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="heraldica:Duchy of Bouillon">[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/bouillon.htm History of the Duchy of Bouillon] on ''Heraldica''</ref> Along with Bouillon and the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li<U+00E8>ge]], it was one of only three principalities in the region that were never a part of the [[Southern Netherlands]],<ref name="Uyttebrouck">Andr<U+00E9> Uyttebrouck, "Une Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration et trois principaut<U+00E9>s", in ''La Wallonie, le Pays et les Hommes'', 1975, pages 215<U+2013>44, 235.</ref> all having been a part of the [[Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle|Lower Rhenish]] [[Imperial Circle]], rather than the [[Burgundian Circle]].<ref name="wikisource:Imperial Circles">{{de icon}} ''[[:de:s:Hernach volgend die zehen Kray<U+00DF>#Seite 12: Niderlendisch vnnd Westuelisch Kray<U+00DF>|Hernach volgend die zehen Kray<U+00DF>]]'' (1532)</ref>

In 1795 the principality was abolished and its territory was incorporated into the [[departments of France#Napoleonic Empire|French d<U+00E9>partement]] of [[Ourthe (department)|Ourthe]].<ref name="Guide pittoresque">{{fr icon}} Alexandre Ferrier de Tourettes (1838), ''Guide pittoresque et artistique du voyageur en Belgique'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vF1bAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA241 page 241]</ref> The Congress of Vienna in 1815 assigned Stavelot to the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]<ref name="Stavelot:Histoire">{{fr icon}} [http://www.stavelot.be/index.php?url=fr/la-commune/histoire/ History] on the official website of Stavelot</ref> and Malmedy to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]; ''see also [[Eupen-Malmedy]]''.

In 747, [[Carloman, Mayor of the Palace]], increased the abbeys' lands from his own on his [[abdication]].<ref name="Carolingians p59">Pierre Rich<U+00E9> and Michael Idomir Allen (1993), ''The Carolingians'', ISBN 978-0-812-21342-3, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Tcjy7bCmFL0C&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59 page 59]</ref> Throughout the ninth century, the abbeys played an important cultural role in [[Lotharingia]], particularly thanks to prince-abbot [[Christian of Stavelot|Christian]]. Around 875, the relics of [[Nicasius, Quirinus, Scubiculus, and Pientia|St Quirinus]] were [[translation (relic)|translated]] from [[Gasny]] to Malmedy Abbey after the intercession of Emperor [[Charles the Bald]], partly to secure relics comparable to those of St Remaclus at Stavelot.<ref name="Roetgen-Rott:Quirinus">{{de icon}} [http://www.kirche-im-bistum-aachen.de/kiba/dcms/traeger/0/pfarre-st-antonius-rott/qui_oktav/geschichte_qui-oktav.html St Quirinus of Rott], ''Parish website of of St Anthony of [[Roetgen]]-Rott'' and, cited therewithin, Ludwig Drees (1973), "Der Kampf mit dem Drachen, Die Legende des Hl.

Through the seventh and eighth centuries, the two abbeys followed their mission of [[evangelism]], along with [[logging|forest clearance]], but suffered the same decay as elsewhere with the collapse of the [[Carolingian Empire]], with the principality in the custody of [[lay abbot]]s&nbsp;<U+2014> temporal guardians&nbsp;<U+2014> from 844 to 938, including [[Ebbo]], [[archbishop of Rheims]], [[Adalard the Seneschal]], [[Reginar, Duke of Lorraine|Reginar]] and [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Giselbert]], dukes of Lorraine, and the like.<ref name="<U+00C9>tude">{{fr icon}} Ren<U+00E9>-Norbert Sauvage (1928), [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhef_0300-9505_1928_num_14_63_2468_t1_0224_0000_1 review of Fran<U+00E7>ois Baix's 1924 ''<U+00C9>tude sur l'abbaye et principaut<U+00E9> de Stavelot-Malm<U+00E9>dy]'', in ''[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/revue/rhef Revue d'histoire de l'<U+00C9>glise de France]'' '''14'''(63):224<U+2013>5.</ref><ref name="Burkes:Rainier Longneck">Regnier I of Hainault, ''Burke's Peerage & Baronetage, 106th Edition'', page 1929, cited in [http://larryvoyer.com/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I80833&tree=v7_28 Voyer & Bedard Family History and Ancestry]</ref><ref name="fmg:Giselbert">[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/LOTHARINGIA.htm#_Toc180309979 Giselbert, duke of Lotharingia, 928<U+2013>939], ''Foundation for Medieval Genealogy''</ref>

Welcoming [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] and the sick was a part of the monks' mission. The ''Miracula sancti Remacli'' mention the ''{{lang|la|xenodochium}}'', the monastery's [[hospice]], where poor pilgrims are granted hospitality, including food for almost eight days, whilst they make their [[catholic devotions|devotions]]; this hospice differs from the abbey's [[hospital]]: ''{{lang|la|hospitale coenobii}}''. On 13 April 862, [[Lothair II of Lotharingia]], while dealing with the distribution of property "''{{lang|la|ad hospital ejusdem coenobii}}''", ordered that local [[tithe]]s be paid to the hospital "''{{lang|la|absque netligentia et tarditate}}''", an order he confirmed on 10 June 873.<ref name="Philippe George"/>

In December 881, [[Normans]] invaded the area, including [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]], burning both abbeys and causing the monks to flee with their treasures and relics.<ref name="Blick and Tekippe"/><ref name="<U+00C9>tude"/><ref name="Annals of Fulda">[[Janet Nelson]] and [[Timothy Reuter]] (1992), ''The Annals of Fulda'', ISBN 978-0-719-03458-9, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ARENAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA91 page 90]</ref><ref name="Dewez">{{fr icon}} Louis Dieudonn<U+00E9> Joseph Dewez (1817), ''Abr<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> de l'histoire belgique'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SmNbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA163 pages 163<U+2013>4]</ref><ref name="M<U+00E9>langes">{{fr icon}} Terry Barry et al (2007), ''M<U+00E9>langes d'arch<U+00E9>ologie m<U+00E9>di<U+00E9>vale'', ISBN 978-2-870-09938-4, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=goo-oPDNNlAC&pg=PA148 pages 148<U+2013>49]</ref> Several historical sources provide evidence on the raid of 881, which was well prepared and organised. The monks rushed to dig up the relics of Remaclus and fled to the [[county of Porcien]] in present-day [[Bogny-sur-Meuse]] in the French Ardennes; the surrounding region was largely unaffected by the invasion.<ref name="Philippe George"/> Stavelot and Malmedy were both burned, with the monks not returning until just before Christmas 882, with a stay in [[Chooz, Ardennes|Chooz]] allowed them to repair the roofs of the monastic buildings. Relics from [[Aachen]], which had been entrusted to the monks at Stavelot because of the Norman threat, were returned intact.<ref name="Philippe George"/> In gratitude, on 13 November 882, [[Charles the Fat]], Carolingian emperor and king of East Francia, [[Duke of Swabia|Alemannia]] and [[king of Italy|Italy]], granted the abbeys the lands of Blendef, a dependency of [[Louveign<U+00E9>]], and restored to them the chapel in Bra (now a part of [[Lierneux]] in [[Li<U+00E8>ge (province)|Li<U+00E8>ge]]).<ref name="Philippe George"/>

In 885, Normans extracted [[ransom]] from [[Hesbaye]] and passed through the Meuse valley, marching on [[Pr<U+00FC>m]], causing the monks of Stavelot to flee again, finding refuge in the [[county of Logne]] and [[Kerkrade|Ch<U+00E8>vremont]]; the ''Miracula Remacli'' details the flight from the invaders and follows the monks' wanderings.<ref name="Philippe George"/> After the invasions, abbot Odilon rebuilt the ruined abbey of Stavelot; with support from [[bishopric of Li<U+00E8>ge|bishops of Li<U+00E8>ge]]&nbsp;<U+2014> including [[Notker of Li<U+00E8>ge|Notker]], the first prince-bishop&nbsp;<U+2014> the abbots Odilon and Werinfride rebuilt the abbeys, with new buildings, the re-establishment of the monastic community and the re-organisation of the principality; by the time of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] in the early 10th century, the abbeys were once again of suitable Imperial stature.<ref name="<U+00C9>tude"/> A new abbey church was built in Malmedy in 992, dedicated to St Quirinus;<ref name="Roetgen-Rott:Quirinus"/> in 1007, a parish church was consecrated to [[Gereon|Saint Gereon]].<ref name="fotw:Malmedy"/>

Another danger threatened the abbey&nbsp;<U+2014> and the Western Empire&nbsp;<U+2014> in the tenth century: the [[Hungarians|Hungarian invasions]]. Having been deposed as [[duke of Lotharingia]], [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]] invited the Hungardans to undermine his opponents, [[Bruno the Great]], [[archbishop of Cologne]], and [[Reginar III, Count of Hainaut]]. The ''Annales Stabulensis'' report: "''{{lang|la|Anno 954 Ungri populantur regiones Galli<U+00E6> ... Anno 995. Victoria des Ungris}}''".<ref name="Philippe George"/> On 1 July 960, Eraclus, bishop of Li<U+00E8>ge, driven by the fears of the time, granted the monks a location to build a refuge in Li<U+00E8>ge. Five years earlier, the victory of emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] over the Hungarians at [[Battle of Lechfeld|Lechfeld]] proved the danger from Hungarian [[war loot|sack]].<ref name="Philippe George"/>

[[File:Heinrich III. (HRR) Miniatur.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], who was present for the 1040 [[consecration]] of the church built in Stavelot under prince-abbot [[Poppo of Deinze]].]]
The key building period at the abbey of Stavelot corresponds to the rule of prince-abbot [[Poppo of Deinze]], the second founder of the abbey,<ref name="Abbaye de Stavelot">[http://www.abbayedestavelot.be/code/en/vest.asp Arch<U+00E6>ological remains], Abbaye de Stavelot</ref> who was made abbot by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] in 1020.<ref name="cath:St. Poppo">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12275a.htm St Poppo] in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''</ref> He built an imposing church over {{convert|100|m}} in length, which was consecrated in the presence of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry III]] on 5 June 1040.<ref name="Philippe George"/> As well as confirming the authenticity of the relics of St Quirinus at Malmedy in 1042,<ref name="Roetgen-Rott:Quirinus"/> Poppo revived the cult of St Remaclus. Poppo died in 1048; his cult, which began almost immediately,<ref name="Vita Popponis">The ''Vita Popponis'', which detailed the miracles that occurred in his name, specifically asserted that Stavelot might rejoice in having a saint, as Tours rejoiced in its [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]].</ref> focused on his resting place in the crypt. Thietmar was the lay patron who assembled carpenters and stone masons to build the abbey church.<ref name="Vita Popponis"/> Malmedy developed around the monastery; until the end of the tenth century, the villagers used the chapel of [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Laurent]], an [[apsidiole]] of the abbey church, as their place of worship.<ref name="fotw:Malmedy"/>

In 1065, controversy arose when [[Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne]], named Tegernon of Brauweiler abbot of Malmedy, on dubious authority&nbsp;<U+2014> whilst Malmedy was in the archdiocese of Cologne, the two abbeys were linked and, thus, under the purview of the diocese of Li<U+00E8>ge, where Stavelot lay. The monks from Stavelot processed to Malmedy with the [[crosier]] and relics of St Remaclus to remind the rebellious monks of the traditional order for the abbeys that the saint had instituted. The relics and crosier were also transported to an [[Reichstag (institution)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] in [[Goslar]]. In 1066, they processed again, this time to [[Aachen]] and [[Fritzlar]]; they processed to [[Bitburg]] and [[Bamberg]] the following year. That their prayers were not answered apparently led the monks to despair that the relics were becoming impotent or that the monks were being punished by their patron; in 1067 and 1068, abbot Thierry even went to [[Rome]] to appeal to [[Pope Alexander II]]. This impasse lasted for a further three years, until Henry held court at Li<U+00E8>ge at Easter in 1071; with great ceremony, the monks processed with Remaclus's relics to meet with his legendary fellow bishop [[St Lambert]], joined en route by the relics of [[St Symmetrus]]. Numerous miracles convinced the emperor to recognise the union of the two abbeys and reiterate the superiority of Stavelot, forcing Anno eventually to capitulate. A rejoiceful procession back to Stavelot paused en route to celebrate Mass on the banks of the Meuse, with a great crowd and further mirables. Finally, the monks processed with Remaclus's relics to the abbey at Malmedy, to symbolise the restoration of his and their authority. This series of episodes is recounted in the heroic narrative of the ''Triumph of St Remaclus'' and confirmed in several contemporary sources.<ref name="Blick and Tekippe"/>

In 1098, [[Wibald]] was born in the hamlet of Chevrouheid, near Stavelot. Elected prince-abbot in 1130, he played a key international-level role in the religious life of the region and the abbeys. In 1138, he granted permission for the castle to be built in Logne, first mentioned in an 862 abbey charter.<ref name="Patrimoine:Huy">{{fr icon}} ''Li<U+00E8>ge, Arrondissement de Huy'', vol 16(1) from the series ''Le patrimoine monumental de la Belgique'', ISBN 978-287-009487-7, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BxnXUKL6Up8C&pg=PA411 page 411]; this piece contains a citation to Jean Yernaux, ''Histoire du comt<U+00E9> de Logne. <U+00C9>tude sur le pass<U+00E9> politique, <U+00E9>conomique et sociale d'un district ardennais'', Li<U+00E8>ge-Paris 1937, pages 13<U+2013>48.</ref> In the 12th to 15th centuries, however, the abbacy experienced a slow decline.

=== Early Modern Age ===
In 1509, [[William of Manderscheid|William]] of [[County of Manderscheid|Manderscheid]] organised a procession to induce the recalcitrant county of Logne, a fief of the abbey, to submit to his jurisdiction. The cort<U+00E8>ge was pious, rather than fraught with tension, with Stavelot monks carrying the shrines of Remaclus and Babolene with other reliquaries and the monks of Malmedy with reliquaries of [[Nicasius, Quirinus, Scubiculus, and Pientia|Quirinus]], [[Justus of Beauvais|Just]], Peter and Philip joined by parishioners from Lierneux with the relics of Symmetrus.<ref name="Blick and Tekippe"/> In 1521, after the castle in Logne had been dismantled, William added "Count of Logne" to the abbots' titles, with the county representing most of the western portion of the principality's territory.<ref name="Patrimoine:Huy"/>

The abbey church served as a monastic church and as a church of pilgrimage until the French Revolution. Its imposing gatehouse tower was rebuilt in 1534;<ref name="Abbaye de Stavelot"/> its ground floor is all that remains, though the abbey church has been excavated and its layout is shown on the ground. Malmedy began to flourish particularly in the 16th century with the development of tannery; in 1544 there were only 216 houses with a thousand inhabitants, but that over tripled by 1635.<ref name="fotw:Malmedy"/>

After the death of abbot [[Christopher of Manderscheid]], there was a series of absent abbots, including [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria]] (who was also bishop of Li<U+00E8>ge and of [[Bishopric of Hildesheim|Hildesheim]]), who reformed the abbey in 1656.<ref name="D<U+00E9>lices"/> In the 17th century, Stavelot and Malmedy were major centres of [[tanning]] in Europe.<ref name="Li<U+00E8>ge:Stavelot"/><ref name="1911:Malmedy"/><ref name="Malmedy:Growth"/> Other industries also known to Malmedy include [[cotton]] manufacturing, manufacture of [[chess set]]s, [[dominoes]] and [[gingerbread]]; [[papermaking]] was particularly important to Malmedy, as was the manufacture of [[gunpowder]].<ref name="1911:Malmedy"/><ref name="Malmedy:Growth"/> In 1659, a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent was built in Stavelot.

Despite the abbacy's [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] and the protection of the prince-abbots, the territory was invaded at least 50 times by troops passing through, whose depredations had disastrous consequences for the population,<ref name="Malmedy:Growth"/> including the 4 October 1689 razing of both Stavelot<ref name="Kellen">{{de icon}} Tony Kellen (1897), ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IwxBAAAAYAAJ Malmedy und die preussische Wallonie]'' ([http://books.google.co.uk/books?q=%224+October+1689%22+stavelot+malmedy excerpt])</ref> and Malmedy<ref name="fotw:Malmedy"/><ref name="Malmedy:Growth"/><ref name="Kellen"/> on the orders of [[Nicolas Catinat]], general to [[Louis XIV of France]], during the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name="fotw:Malmedy"/><ref name="Malmedy:Growth"/> In Stavelot, the entire town, including over 360 houses, was destroyed, leaving just the abbey and its farmyard standing;<ref name="<U+00C9>tudes historiques">Ars<U+00E8>ne de No<U+00FC>e (1848) ''<U+00C9>tudes historiques sur l'ancien pays de Stavelot et Malmedy'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AI46AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA322 pages 321<U+2013>5]</ref> Some 600 out of the 660 houses of the town were destroyed and it took more than a century to completely rebuild Malmedy.<ref name="fotw:Malmedy"/> Malmedy's 1601 [[city walls]] had previously been destroyed by French troops in 1658, during the 1635<U+2013>59 [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco-Spanish War]].<ref name="fotw:Malmedy"/> The wars, and passage by troops of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Early Modern France|France]] and Li<U+00E8>ge, had cost the principality the sum of 2.75 million [[Reichsthaler]]s, requiring the abbey to borrow 134&nbsp;000 thalers from Li<U+00E8>ge and [[Verviers]]; another loan, shared amongst the communities, totalled 109&nbsp;000 thalers, with annual [[interest]] of 14&nbsp;161 thalers and [[arrears]] of 26&nbsp;000 thalers.<ref name="<U+00C9>tudes historiques"/>

By the start of the 18th century the principality had lost a third of its territory, as a result of war, fires, pillage and unjust encroachments. The deputies to the [[Reichstag (institution)|Reichstag]] showed that, in the 16th century, the [[Spanish Netherlands]] had seized several territories and that the Bishopric of Li<U+00E8>ge had stolen over half a dozen ''seigneuries'' totalling over 2000 households, adding that the principality itself retained only 1693 households, having had 3780 households before the upheavals and that the suffering of the principality had caused some of the richest and most powerful families to emigrate. The Reichstag was moved to halve the ''[[:de:Reichsmatrikel|Reichsmatrikel]]'' for the abbeys (reducing the sums and troops the abbeys needed to provide towards the Imperial army) and exempting any need for the abbeys to send troops to the Imperial army for three years, an exemption extended for four more years on 24 March 1715.<ref name="<U+00C9>tudes historiques"/>

=== Abolition ===
During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], from 1793 to 1804, the abbey was abandoned by the monks and the principality extinguished.<ref name="fotw:Stavelot">[http://flagspot.net/flags/be-wlgst.html Stavelot] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''</ref> Stavelot was incorporated to the French Republic by a decree of 2 March 1793, along with [[Franchimont Castle|Franchimont]] and Logne.<ref name="Duvergier">{{fr icon}} ''Collection compl<U+00E8>te des lois d<U+00E9>crets, ordonnances, r<U+00E8>glemens avis du conseil-d'<U+00E9>tat'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gmYZAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA8-PA178 page 178]</ref> Despite opposition from local notables, Malmedy was similarly incorporated by decree of 9 [[Vend<U+00E9>miaire]] of the Year IV (1 October 1795).<ref name="fotw:Malmedy"/> Stavelot abbey itself was sacked and the church sold and demolished;<ref name="fotw:Stavelot"/><ref name="Expos<U+00E9> fid<U+00E8>le">{{fr icon}} ''Expos<U+00E9> fid<U+00E8>le des raisons qui ont retard<U+00E9> l'Ex<U+00E9>cution de la Sentence Imp<U+00E9>riale de Wetzlaer, au sujet de l'Insurrection Li<U+00E9>goise, aves les pi<U+00E8>ces justificatives.''

Based largely in the [[Ambl<U+00E8>ve river|Ambl<U+00E8>ve]] and [[Ourthe]] river valleys, the principality took up a substantial proportion of what is now the [[arrondissement of Verviers]] in the [[province of Li<U+00E8>ge]]. By the time of the [[French Revolution]], the principality was bounded to the north by the [[duchy of Limburg]], to the south and east by the [[duchy of Luxembourg]] and to the north-west by the [[marquisate of Franchimont]] and the [[Condroz]].<ref name="<U+00C9>tudes historiques"/> The principality was divided into three administrative districts: the ''{{lang|fr|postellerie}}'' of Stavelot, the ''{{lang|fr|postellerie}}'' of Malmedy and the [[county of Logne]], totalling around 28,000 inhabitants.<ref name="em:Stavelot"/><ref name="B<U+00FC>sching"/><ref name="Malmedy:Growth"/><ref name="<U+00C9>tudes historiques"/> The ''{{lang|fr|postellerie}}'' of Stavelot contained 14 communities and that of Malmedy contained the town itself and the ''{{lang|fr|bans}}'' of [[Waimes]] and [[Francorchamps]]. The county of Logne was divided into four ''{{lang|fr|quartiers}}'': [[Hamoir]] (7 communities), [[Ocquier]] (6), [[Comblain-Fairon|Comblain]] (5) and [[Louveign<U+00E9>]] (2), with public assemblies being based in [[Bernardfagne]]. In addition, six other communities were [[exclave]]s, plus the ''{{lang|fr|seigneuries}}'' of [[Anthisnes]] and Vien, in the Confroz. In 1768, these two ''{{lang|fr|seigneuries}}'' were exchanged with Li<U+00E8>ge for [[Chooz, Ardennes|Chooz]], Sclessin and Ougr<U+00E9>e.<ref name="<U+00C9>tudes historiques"/>

Several sources note that the two abbeys held disputes between themselves, with Stavelot assuming primacy over Malmedy, to the latter's discontent; new abbots were invested in Stavelot on behalf of both abbeys, however.<ref name="B<U+00FC>sching"/><ref name="em:Malmedy">{{fr icon}} [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OquskkAxlaMC&pg=PA222 Malmedy] in the ''Encyclop<U+00E9>die m<U+00E9>thodique'' (1788)</ref> Whilst an [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] principality, in some matters the prince-abbot could consult a general assembly or ''{{lang|fr|<U+00E9>tats}}'' of clergy, dignitaries, prince's officers, mayors and aldermen, whose main role was to vote for [[tax]]es. Each of the three districts had its own provincial assembly and court, with a Princely Council for highly-contested cases; as a court of last resort, citizens could appeal to the [[Imperial Chamber Court]] ({{lang-de|Reichskammergericht}}), created by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]] (reigned 1508<U+2013>19) on the model of the parliaments in [[Paris]] and [[Mechelen]] and headquartered in [[Frankfurt]] (1495<U+2013>1527), [[Speyer]] (1527<U+2013>1693) and [[Wetzlar]] (1693<U+2013>1806).<ref name="Uyttebrouck"/>

Shortly before the principality's extinction, it contributed just over 81 Reichsthaler per session to the Imperial economy (for the maintenance of the Imperial Chamber Court), with annual revenues of around 25&nbsp;000 [[Rhenish gulden]].<ref name="em:Stavelot"/><ref name="B<U+00FC>sching"/><ref name="em:Malmedy"/>
