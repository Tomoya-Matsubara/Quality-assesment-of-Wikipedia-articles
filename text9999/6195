The '''Porticus of Pompey''' (known under various names, including the ''Ambulatio Magni'' and ''Hecatostylon'' or "Hall of a hundred pillars")<ref name=Sandys>{{cite book|last=Sandys|first=John Edwin|title=A Companion to Latin Studies|year=2010|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=978-1174262586|pages=515}}</ref>  was a large [[quadriporticus]] located directly behind the [[scaenae frons]] of the [[Theatre of Pompey]]. It enclosed a large and popular public garden in the ancient city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The porticus was finished in 62 BC.<ref name="Gleason" />  and has a history spanning hundreds of years. The [[colonnade]]s contained [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] and [[Long gallery|gallaries]] that displayed sculptures and paintings collected from years of war campaigns of its patron and builder, [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]].<ref name=Companion>{{cite book|last=Rosenstein, Morstein-Marx|first=Nathan, Robert|title=A Companion to the Roman Republic|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1444334135|pages=98}}</ref>  Over time the site became rows of shops that occupied what were the galleries and arcades. As the ground level rose from constant flooding from the [[Tiber River]], much of the original architectural elements were re-used by shop owners to adhorn their structures at higher levels. Today, many of these shops still exist and fragments of the old theatre and porticus can be seen embedded in the ancient walls of many of the buildings.

==History==
The ancient city of Rome was designed with covered walkways, public gardens as well as large pools and fountains that were common by the 1ST century AD.<ref name=Gleason>{{cite journal|last=Gleason|first=Kathryn L.|title=The Garden Portico of Pompey the Great|journal=Expedition|year=1990|volume=32|issue=3|pages=4<U+2013>13|accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref>  Citizens would stroll throughout the city under these colonnades, shaded from the sun and rain.

Pompey, impressed or inspired by what he saw during his years of travel and campaigning for Rome, returned with a desire to build a monument to himself larger than any other before. A theatre, porticus and curia were built in a huge complex that became a symbol of Roman culture for centuries and was imulated across the Republic and empire.

==Architecture==
The entrance to the theatre complex was tightly controlled at either side of the [[Curia of Pompey]]. This was to guide the visitor's sight directly along the inner garden area to the main doorway (regia) to the stage of the theatre and up to the temple of Venus Victrix. This sightline was permanently disprupted in 32 BC when Augustus had a stone scaena built.<ref name="Von Stackelberg">{{cite book|last=Von Stackelberg|first=Katharine T.|title=The Roman Garden: Space, Sense, and Society|year=2009|publisher=Taylor and Francis|pages=81<U+2013>82|isbn=9780415438230}}</ref>
