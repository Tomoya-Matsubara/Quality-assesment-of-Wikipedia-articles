Walpack Township dates back to October 26, 1731, when it was first mentioned as ''Walpake'' in [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]]. The area covered by the present-day township was set off to [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]] upon that county's creation in 1739, and became part of the newly formed Sussex County in 1753. As of April 15, 1754, Walpack's boundaries were defined as a "precinct". Walpack was formally incorporated as a township by an Act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form [[Montague Township, New Jersey|Montague Township]] (March 26, 1759), [[Sandyston Township, New Jersey|Sandyston Township]] (February 26, 1762) and the now-defunct [[Pahaquarry Township, New Jersey|Pahaquarry Township]] in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] (December 27, 1824).<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

The current Walpack Township is named from a corruption of the [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] word "wahlpeck," which means "turn-hole," or an [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddy]] or [[whirlpool]].  This word is a compound of two Native American words, "woa-lac" (a hole), and "tuppeck" (a pool).<ref>Snell, James P.
