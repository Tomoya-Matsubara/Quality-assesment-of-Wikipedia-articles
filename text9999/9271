The '''Saskatchewan Roughriders''' are a professional football team based in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] who play in the [[Canadian Football League West Division|West Division]] of the [[Canadian Football League]]. Founded in 1910, they have played their games at [[Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field]] since 1936. Originally known as the '''Regina Rugby Club''' from 1910 to 1923, they changed their name to the '''Regina Roughriders''' in 1924 and finally to the current moniker in 1946.

The team draws fans from across [[Saskatchewan]] and Canada who are affectionately known as the "Rider Nation".<ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/article/rider-nation-receives-commissioner-s-award Rider Nation receives Commissioner's Award]</ref> Their loyalty is all the more remarkable since the Roughriders play in the smallest market in the CFL, and the second-smallest major-league market in North America (only [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], is smaller). They have finished first in the Western Division seven times and have won the Western championship a record 28 times. But, despite playing in the championship game 19 times, they have won only four [[Grey Cup]]s over their 100-year history. 

The team has had 20 players inducted into the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]]. The Riders' biggest rival is the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]]; games between the two are often sold out before the beginning of the season.<ref>{{Cite news| first = Courtney | last = Wagner | title = Labour Day Classic sold out and Round 4 final predictions | url = http://communities.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/blogs/wagner/archive/2009/06/01/labour-day-classic-sold-out-and-round-4-final-predictions.aspx | publisher = [[Regina Leader-Post]] | date = 2009-06-01 | accessdate = }}</ref> The Roughriders Football Club and the city of Regina have hosted the Grey Cup three times, including a Roughrider win in the [[101st Grey Cup]].<ref>[http://cfl.ca/article/101st-grey-cup-awarded-to-saskatchewan 101st Grey Cup awarded to Saskatchewan]</ref> In July of 2012, the Province of Saskatchewan announced that the Roughriders will have a new stadium completed in time for the 2017 season.

==Franchise history==
===Club origins and the early years===
The team was founded as the ''Regina Rugby Club'' on Tuesday, September 13, 1910, adopting the colours of old gold and purple.<ref name="1910s">[http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1910 CFL History: Timeline 1910s]</ref>  They played their home games at Park Hughes on 10th Avenue in Regina's north central section, where they remain based to this day.  The team was also a founding member of the [[Saskatchewan Rugby Football Union]] as it was organized on September 22 of that year. Regina played their first game against the Moose Jaw Tigers on October 1, 1910, at the Moose Jaw Baseball Grounds where they were defeated 16<U+2013>6. For the 1911 season, the team changed their colours to blue and white to match the Regina Amateur Athletic Association and won their first SRFU championship, but lost in the first season of the [[Western Canada Rugby Football Union]] playoffs.<ref name="Sask History">[http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_teams_sask History of the Saskatchewan Roughriders]</ref> 

The Regina Rugby Club changed their colours again in 1912 to red and black and began an era of western football dominance.<ref name="1910s"/> For every season of play in the SRFU, Regina would win the league championship, exerting their prowess over teams from [[Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatoon]], and any other clubs in [[Saskatchewan]]. Beginning in the [[1912 in Canadian football|1912 season]], Regina would go on to win seven straight WCRFU titles, excluding 1917 and 1918 when [[World War I]] interrupted league play. In [[1921 in Canadian football|1921]], the western champion was invited to compete for the [[Grey Cup]] national championship, but it was also the first time since 1911 that the Regina Rugby Club didn't win the West Championship as the [[Edmonton Elks|Edmonton Eskimos]] traveled east to play in the [[9th Grey Cup]].<ref name="1920s">[http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1920 CFL History: Timeline 1920s]</ref>

In [[1923 in Canadian football|1923]], Regina returned to power as they won their eighth western championship over the Winnipeg Victorias and earned the right to compete in the national playoffs. The club was given a [[bye (sports)|bye]] and advanced straight to the [[11th Grey Cup|Grey Cup final]] for the first time, but were severely outmatched, losing 54<U+2013>0 to [[Queen's University]] at [[Varsity Stadium]] in [[Toronto]].<ref name="1920s"/> This was, and still is, the most lopsided defeat in [[Grey Cup#Team scoring records|Grey Cup history]] as the defending champion Queen's won their third straight national championship at the expense of the Regina Rugby Club.<ref name="Grey Cup Records">[http://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/2009_GreyCup_Records.pdf Grey Cup Records]</ref>

===The Regina Roughriders===
Following their first [[Grey Cup]] loss, the club changed their name to the ''Regina Roughriders'' in [[1924 in Canadian football|1924]] while retaining the colours of red and black.<ref name="1920s"/> [[Ottawa]] also had a team called the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]], but the spelling was different and the two clubs played in [[Interprovincial Rugby Football Union|different leagues]]. The origin of the name has multiple theories, one of which describes how the [[North-West Mounted Police]] were called Roughriders because they broke the wild horse broncos that were used by the force and the moniker was adopted from them.<ref>http://www.tourismsaskatchewan.com/images/products/opfiles/RCMPHC%20Newsletter-November%202013.pdf</ref> Another states that the name was adopted from [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[cavalry]] contingent that was known as the [[Rough Riders]], who fought in the [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]]. It was believed that there were Canadian troops in the contingent that returned to Canada following the war and moved out [[Western Canada|west]].<ref name="Sask History"/>

During the first two years of their name change, the Roughriders failed to reclaim their western championship title, losing both times to clubs from [[Winnipeg]].<ref>http://cflapedia.com/Years/1924.html cflapedia: 1924</ref><ref>http://cflapedia.com/Years/1925.html cflapedia: 1925</ref> The [[1926 in Canadian football|1926 season]] marked the beginning of their next reign of dominance as the club matched their own WCRFU record with seven consecutive western championships from 1926 to 1932. With dominant players such as [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]]r [[Eddie James (Canadian football)|Eddie James]], the Roughriders were a perennial contender from the West, reaching the Grey Cup finals five consecutive years from 1928 to 1932, the second-longest streak in the championship's history.<ref name="Sask History"/> Unfortunately, Regina remained winless in the national championship, being outscored 102<U+2013>15 in those Grey Cup games. The Roughriders won their last WCRFU title in [[1934 in Canadian football|1934]], representing the west for the seventh time in the [[22nd Grey Cup]], but lost to the [[Sarnia Imperials]] in that club's first Grey Cup win.<ref>[http://cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1934 Grey Cup 1934]</ref>

===Western Interprovincial Football Union===
In 1936, Regina joined the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] and [[Calgary Bronks]] as the founding franchises of the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]], the highest level of [[Canadian football]] play in [[Western Canada]].  Also in 1936, a permanent grandstand was built at Park Hughes and Park de Young--what is now Taylor Field.  The Roughriders would become the first WIFU champions after they defeated the Blue Bombers and Bronks in the West Semi-Finals and West Finals respectively. However, due to a rules dispute with the [[Football Canada|Canadian Rugby Union]] over use of their five import players from the [[United States]], Regina was barred from competing for the [[24th Grey Cup]].<ref name="Abandon Final">[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v7hTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VDgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1748%2C4518233 The Leader-Post - Dec 2, 1936]</ref> Winnipeg had won the [[Grey Cup]] championship [[23rd Grey Cup|one year earlier]] with seven imports and the move to prevent Regina from competing was seen as a reaction to the previous year's western win. While the Roughriders had planned on traveling east without the five ineligible players, the CRU remained steadfast in their decision to disallow the team from competition.<ref name="Abandon Final"/><ref>http://cflapedia.com/Years/1936.html cflapedia: 1936</ref>

The next decade in the WIFU would not be as successful as the first as the team would not win another Western Final as the Regina Roughriders, nor ever finish in first place in that time span. After qualifying for the playoffs in three of their next five seasons, play from 1942 to 1944 was interrupted due the [[World War II]]. While there was no regular season in [[1945 in Canadian football|1945]], the Roughriders did play the newly named [[Calgary Stampeders]] in the West Semi-Finals, but lost the series two games to none.<ref name="1940s">[http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1940 CFL History: Timeline 1940s]</ref>

===The Saskatchewan Roughriders===
With the folding of both clubs in Moose Jaw and Saskatoon, the Regina Roughriders became a provincially community-owned club, and, consequently, changed their name to the ''Saskatchewan Roughriders'' in [[1946 in Canadian football|1946]].<ref name="1940s"/>  It is the first recorded instance of a major-league team in North America naming itself for its state or province rather than its city.  Prior to the [[1948 in Canadian football|1948 season]], the Roughriders were in need of new uniforms as their red and black ones had become old and worn out. While visiting a surplus store in [[Chicago]], executive member Jack Fyffe found a set of green and white uniforms and purchased them for the Roughriders, which have remained as the team's primary colours to this day.<ref name="Sask History"/> The name change was made official on April 1, 1950.<ref>2009 Canadian Football League Facts, Figures & Records, Canadian Football League Properties/Publications, Toronto, Ontario, ISBN 978-0-9739425-4-5, p.282<U+2013>283</ref><ref name="1950s">[http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1950 CFL History: Timeline 1950s]</ref>

After three years of first-round playoff exits, the Roughriders finally returned to prominence in [[1951 in Canadian football|1951]], winning their first [[Western Interprovincial Football Union|WIFU]] regular season championship with an 8<U+2013>6 record. Saskatchewan, led by quarterback [[Glenn Dobbs]], defeated the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] in the West Final and advanced to the [[Grey Cup]] for the first time since [[22nd Grey Cup|1934]]. In this game, they faced the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] for the first time, marking the first Roughriders versus Rough Riders championship game in [[Canadian football]] history. Unfortunately, Saskatchewan could not win their first championship as they were defeated by Ottawa 21<U+2013>14 in the [[39th Grey Cup]].<ref>[http://cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1951 Grey Cup 1951]</ref> 
	
Saskatchewan contended on and off in the 1950s, with four consecutive winning seasons and second-place regular season finishes from 1953 to 1956. Teams from this era featured standouts such as [[Frank Tripucka]], Reggie Whitehouse, [[Ken Carpenter (American football)|Ken Carpenter]], [[Mike Cassidy (Canadian football)|Mike Cassidy]], player-coach [[Frank Filchock]] and [[Cookie Gilchrist]] who was the first Roughrider player to rush for 1,000 yards in [[1958 CFL season|1958]]. Even with that talent, they couldn't return to the Grey Cup as clubs fielded by either the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] and [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] would end their season in each of these years. Their strongest season was in [[1956 in Canadian football|1956]] when the Roughriders recorded a 10<U+2013>6 record and won their first playoff series since 1951, only to lose to the Eskimos in the Western Finals.

Following their 1956 campaign, tragedy struck the Roughriders franchise when four members of the team were killed in a plane crash on December 9, 1956, while returning from the [[CFL All-Star Game]] in [[Vancouver]]. [[Gordon Sturtridge]], [[Mel Becket]], [[Ray Syrnyk]], and [[Mario DeMarco]] were killed when [[Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 810|Flight 810]] crashed into [[Slesse Mountain]] near [[Chilliwack]], [[British Columbia]]. The team retired the numbers of the four players shortly after the [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]].<ref>{{Cite news| first = Stu | last = Beitel | title = Mount Slesse, BC Plane Crashes Into Mountains, Dec 1956 | url = http://www3.gendisasters.com/air-disasters/6034/mount-slesse-bc-plane-crashes-mountains-dec-1956 | publisher = GenDisasters.com | date = 2008-04-04 | accessdate = }}</ref> The [[1957 in Canadian football|following season]], the Roughriders finished with seven fewer wins and a last place finish in the WIFU.

The Saskatchewan Roughriders became charter members of the [[Canadian Football League]] in [[1958 CFL season|1958]], as the team finished with a respectable 7<U+2013>7<U+2013>2 record and a third place finish.<ref name="1950s"/> However, the [[1959 CFL season|following season]] proved to be the worst in [[Saskatchewan Roughriders seasons|franchise history]], as the team finished with just one win and 15 losses, the third-worst winning percentage in [[CFL records (team)#Standings|CFL history]].<ref name="team records">http://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/Records_2011_Regular_and_Playoffs.pdf Canadian Football League - All-Time Records</ref> The years ahead would feature similar results, as the Roughriders would miss the playoffs for three consecutive seasons, their worst such streak since joining the WIFU in [[1936 in Canadian football|1936]].

===The Ronnie and George show===

Following a [[1962 CFL season|1962 season]] that saw the Roughriders return to the playoffs, the team made roster moves that would define a generation of football in Saskatchewan. In the off-season, the Roughriders signed [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[George Reed]] from [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]] to replace [[Fred Burket]], who had been traded to the [[Montreal Alouettes|Alouettes]].<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PmBkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NnwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2636%2C864002 The Calgary Herald - Aug 5, 1963]</ref> Then, prior to their season opening game of the [[1963 CFL season|1963 season]], Saskatchewan acquired [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] quarterback [[Ron Lancaster]] on July 30 on a straight cash basis following three years with the Eastern Riders.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=opMtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=j54FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4623%2C5254154 The Montreal Gazette - Jul 31, 1963]</ref><ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UTk0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=YfUIAAAAIBAJ&pg=5452%2C6475360 Ottawa Citizen - Jul 30, 1963]</ref> The duo would contribute to a productive season for Saskatchewan as they finished with a 7<U+2013>7<U+2013>2 record and won a playoff series for the first time since [[1956 in Canadian football|1956]] before losing their first playoff match-up with the [[BC Lions]]. The Roughriders would continue to make progress in the next two seasons, posting back-to-back winning records, but lost in the West Semi-Finals in both years.

====1966 Grey Cup champions====
Led by second-year [[head coach]] [[Eagle Keys]], the Roughriders would finally break through and capture the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Conference]] regular season title in the [[1966 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|1966 season]], the first time they had accomplished that feat since [[1951 in Canadian football|1951]]. [[Ron Lancaster]] won the [[Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy]] as the Western Conference's most outstanding player while [[George Reed]], receiver [[Hugh Campbell]] and four other Riders were named league all-stars, the most from any team that year. Saskatchewan swept [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers|Winnipeg]] in the West Finals, winning two games to no losses, and qualified for the ninth [[Grey Cup]] final in franchise history. In the [[54th Grey Cup]], Saskatchewan once again faced the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] in a rematch of the [[39th Grey Cup|1951 championship game]]. After the score was tied 14<U+2013>14 at halftime, Saskatchewan scored 15 fourth-quarter points to win the franchise's first Grey Cup championship 29<U+2013>14 on November 26, 1966.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VsQtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1J8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5170%2C5922403 The Montreal Gazette - Nov 28, 1966]</ref><ref>[http://cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1966 Grey Cup 1966]</ref> Saskatchewan was the last of the original nine CFL franchises to win the Grey Cup, doing so in [[Vancouver]] at [[Empire Stadium (Vancouver)|Empire Stadium]].

The Roughriders began the [[1967 CFL season|1967 season]] as defending champions for the first time in franchise history. They finished in second place in the West with a franchise-best 12<U+2013>4 record and advanced to [[55th Grey Cup|Grey Cup]] final once again, but lost to the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] 24<U+2013>1.<ref>[http://cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1967 Grey Cup 1967]</ref> After an early playoff exit in [[1968 CFL season|1968]], the Roughriders finished in first place in [[1969 CFL season|1969]] and defeated the [[Calgary Stampeders|Stampeders]] to qualify for another Grey Cup. In the [[rubber match]] against the Ottawa Rough Riders, Saskatchewan fell 29<U+2013>11 in their [[57th Grey Cup|third Grey Cup]] game in four years. The Roughriders won a franchise-best 14 games in [[1970 CFL season|1970]], a record that stands to this day, but were upset in the West Finals by the Stampeders. Eagle Keys resigned during the following off-season, ending his career as the all-time leader in wins by a Saskatchewan Roughrider head coach with 68 wins and four first place finishes.<ref>[http://www.riderville.com/uploads/assets/SSK/PDF_ROSTERS_DEPTH/All-time%20Leaders%20%282010%29.pdf All-Time Leaders in Saskatchewan Roughrider History]</ref>

[[Dave Skrien]] was hired as the next head coach of the Roughriders and would continue their winning ways, namely with an appearance in the [[60th Grey Cup|1972 Grey Cup]] which yielded another Saskatchewan loss to Hamilton.<ref>[http://cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1972 Grey Cup 1972]</ref> Following that loss were three consecutive second place finishes and West Final losses to the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], ending with George Reed retiring after the [[1975 CFL season|1975 season]] as the all-time leading rusher in all of professional football with 16,116 rushing yards. In [[1976 CFL season|1976]], the Roughriders recaptured first place in the West Division and defeated the Eskimos in the West Final, advancing to the Grey Cup to once again play the Ottawa Rough Riders. The Roughriders allowed a last-minute touchdown catch by Ottawa [[tight end]] [[Tony Gabriel]] to lose their fourth [[64th Grey Cup|Grey Cup]] in ten years, ending one of the most bittersweet eras in Roughrider history.<ref>[http://cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1976 Grey Cup 1976]</ref> Saskatchewan qualified for the playoffs for 15 consecutive seasons, tied for fourth-best in CFL history, and played in 11 consecutive Division Finals, which is a CFL record. They also posted the best regular season record in all of professional football over that time period, but only won one championship during that time.<ref>{{Cite news| first = | last = | title = Riders have surprise in store with uniforms | url = http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/sports/story.html?id=391ca7bb-2b63-4451-8787-9b6fdef0c343 | publisher = [[Saskatoon StarPhoenix]]/[[CanWest News Service]] | date = 2008-04-21 | accessdate = }}</ref>

===Decline and drought===

After their loss in the [[64th Grey Cup|1976 Grey Cup]] game to the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]], Saskatchewan fell into a period of decline that was unprecedented in the CFL. From 1977 to 1987, they failed to qualify for the postseason despite having talented players like [[Joey Walters]] at receiver, [[Vince Goldsmith]] at defensive end, offensive lineman [[Roger Aldag]] from [[Gull Lake, Saskatchewan|Gull Lake]] and [[Dave Ridgway]], who became one of the greatest kickers in CFL history. The eleven consecutive seasons of missing the playoffs is the longest in CFL history. However, in an era dominated by Edmonton and Calgary, the Roughriders often found themselves in a losing battle with BC for the last playoff spot. Proving just how competitive the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Conference]] was during this time, Saskatchewan posted an 8<U+2013>8 record in [[1977 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|1977]], but finished in fourth place. 

Franchise [[quarterback]] [[Ron Lancaster]] retired after the [[1978 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|1978 season]] as the [[List of Canadian Football League records (individual)#Passing|CFL's all time passing leader]] in passing yards, completions and touchdown passes.<ref name="ticats">{{cite web|url=http://www.ticats.ca/page/ron-lancaster|title=Ron Lancaster|work=Front Office Team|publisher=Hamilton Tiger-Cats|accessdate=April 3, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5avqBC9G2|archivedate=September 18, 2008}}</ref> Furthermore, he is the only Roughrider to win the [[CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award]] twice while playing with Saskatchewan. Playing without Lancaster for the first time in 16 seasons proved difficult as the team would post back-to-back 2<U+2013>14 seasons in 1979 and 1980. The Riders' only winning record during this time came in [[1981 CFL season|1981]] when they finished 9<U+2013>7 record, but it was only good enough for fourth place in a competitive West Division - the "crossover rule" had not yet been implemented - therefore, as in 1977, the Riders were denied a playoff spot despite the third place Eastern team having a worse record.  During the following six seasons, the Roughriders would never earn more than six wins in a season, leaving them soundly out of the playoff picture. In [[1985 CFL season|1985]], the Roughriders introduced a new logo as part of the 75th anniversary of the inception of the team, adding black and silver to the team's colour scheme.<ref name="Sask History"/>

===Return to the playoffs===
The Roughriders finally ended their 11-year playoff drought in [[1988 CFL season|1988]] when they tied for first in the West along with Edmonton finishing with identical records of 11<U+2013>7, and finished in second place after tiebreakers. The Roughriders also hosted a playoff game for the first time since [[1976 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|1976]], but lost to the [[BC Lions]] in the Western Semi-Final by a score of 42<U+2013>18. Nonetheless, it was a step in the right direction as the Roughriders learned how to win and gained valuable playoff experience that they would need during the following season.

====1989 Grey Cup champions====
The Roughriders finished with a 9<U+2013>9 record and a third place finish in the [[1989 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|1989 season]], but still qualified for the playoffs for a second consecutive season. After defeating the [[Calgary Stampeders]] in the West Semi-Finals, Saskatchewan faced the powerhouse [[Edmonton Eskimos]] in the West Final, a team that had set (and still holds) a [[List of Canadian Football League records (team)#Standings|CFL record]] with 16 regular season wins in one season. The Roughriders defeated the heavily favoured Eskimos 32<U+2013>21 to advance to the [[Grey Cup]] where they would face the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] for the third time in franchise history. With a talented roster that included [[Kent Austin]] at quarterback, receivers [[Ray Elgaard]], [[Donald Narcisse]], [[Jeff Fairholm]] and James "Duke" Ellingson, and an outstanding offensive line featuring [[Roger Aldag]], [[Vic Stevenson]], [[Dan Payne (Canadian football)|Dan Payne]] and [[Bob Poley]], the game featured extensive offensive prowess. With the score tied 40<U+2013>40, [[placekicker]] [[Dave Ridgway]] kicked a 35-yard game-winning [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]] to win the [[77th Grey Cup]] for the Roughriders, with a play that has become simply known as "The Kick."<ref>[http://cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1989 Grey Cup 1989]</ref> It was the second championship for the franchise, following a 23-year drought. 

Saskatchewan would qualify for the playoffs in four of the next five seasons, including two seasons with winning records, but would lose in the West Semi-Final each time to either the [[Calgary Stampeders]] or [[Edmonton Eskimos]] each time. In [[1995 CFL season|1995]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] hosted the Grey Cup for the first time in league history, giving the Roughriders an opportunity to compete for the championship at home. Unfortunately, the Roughriders finished in sixth place in the newly named North Division, as part of the CFL's [[CFL USA|American expansion]], and did not qualify for the playoffs.<ref name="1990s">[http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1990 CFL History: Timeline 1990s]</ref> 

The Roughriders wouldn't qualify again for the playoffs until [[1997 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|1997]] with a losing record, the first time they had done so since [[1948 in Canadian football|1948]]. The team made the most of their opportunity as they defeated the Stampeders and Eskimos in the West Semi-Final and West Final, respectively, to advance to the [[85th Grey Cup]]. Unfortunately, the upstart Roughriders fell to the [[Doug Flutie]]-led [[Toronto Argonauts]] 47<U+2013>23 in the first ever Grey Cup match up between the two remaining oldest franchises in the league.<ref name="Sask History"/><ref>[http://cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1997 Grey Cup 1997]</ref> The Roughriders would close out the 20th century with two more losing seasons, failing to qualify in the playoffs in both 1998 and 1999.

Following the [[1999 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|1999 season]], [[Roy Shivers]], the former Director of Player Personnel for the [[Calgary Stampeders]], assumed the duties of [[general manager]] of the Roughriders.<ref>[http://bclions.com/page/staff-roy-shivers Roy Shivers BC Lions bio]</ref><ref name="Shivers">[http://www.cfl.ca/article/roughriders__shivers_part_ways Roughriders, Shivers part ways]</ref> Shivers then hired [[Danny Barrett]] as the team's [[head coach]] despite the latter's limited coaching experience. The Roughriders made football history by being the first professional team with a black general manager and head coach.

In what was described as a rebuilding process, the Roughriders began the Shivers and Barrett era with two consecutive last place finishes in 2000 and 2001, missing the playoffs in both years. In [[2002 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2002]], progress was being made as Saskatchewan made the playoffs for the first time since their [[85th Grey Cup|1997 Grey Cup run]] with an 8<U+2013>10 record and a fourth place finish. The team played in the East Semi-Final due to the [[Canadian Football League#Playoffs|crossover rule]], playing in the eastern playoffs for the first time in their 90-year history, losing to their last playoff opponent, the [[Toronto Argonauts]]. The [[2003 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2003 season]] saw the Roughriders earn their first winning record since [[1994 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|1994]], finishing 11<U+2013>7 and in third place, building optimism in a year where the franchise was hosting their second ever [[90th Grey Cup|Grey Cup game]]. While the team played their longtime rival, the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]], in the playoffs for the first time since [[1975 CFL season|1975]] and won, they lost the West Final to the eventual champion [[Edmonton Eskimos]], missing a close chance to play in the [[Grey Cup]] at home.

After their strong 2003 campaign, the Roughriders were expected to build upon that success in [[2004 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2004]]. While the team regressed slightly with a 9<U+2013>9 record, they won the West Semi-Final over the Eskimos and advanced to the West Final for the second consecutive year to face the [[BC Lions]]. After Saskatchewan scored a late touchdown to take the lead, BC tied the game with a late field goal, sending the game to [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]]. Saskatchewan [[placekicker]] [[Paul McCallum]] missed an 18-yard field goal while BC kicker [[Duncan O'Mahoney]] hit a 40-yarder to win the game for the Lions, adding to the frustration of the Roughrider fanbase.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/story/2010/11/12/spf-bc-sask.html CFL playoff history: Lions-Roughriders]</ref>

Prior to the [[2005 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2005 season]], quarterback [[Henry Burris]] signed as a [[free agent]] with [[Calgary Stampeders|Calgary]], leaving the Roughriders with a smaller chance at progress. The team finished in fourth place with a 9<U+2013>9 record and crossed over to the Eastern playoffs again, only to be defeated by the [[Montreal Alouettes]] in the first ever post-season meeting with that team. Feeling a greater need for progress, the pressure was on the Roughriders to perform in [[2006 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2006 season]]. After Saskatchewan had started the season with a 4<U+2013>5 record, general manager Roy Shivers was fired on August 21, 2006.<ref name="Shivers"/> The Roughriders then hired [[Eric Tillman]] to take over and he elected not to renew [[Danny Barrett]]'s contract at the end of the season following a third consecutive 9<U+2013>9 season and a West Final loss to the Lions.<ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/article/danny_barrett_era_ends_in_saskatchewan Danny Barrett era ends in Saskatchewan]</ref> While they did not win any championships, Shivers and Barrett had restored a measure of respectability for the franchise and had set the stage for things to come.

===The Ken Miller era===
====2007 Grey Cup champions====
After contending on and off in the early part of the 21st century, the Roughriders hired [[77th Grey Cup|1989 Grey Cup]] hero [[Kent Austin]] as [[head coach]] and [[Ken Miller (gridiron football)|Ken Miller]] as [[offensive coordinator]] in [[2007 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|the 2007 season]]. Despite a rookie head coach, the team jumped out to a 7<U+2013>2 start, which was their best start since 1976. They finished the season with a 12<U+2013>6 record and brought along with it the Roughriders' first home playoff game since 1988, which became a 26<U+2013>24 victory over the [[Calgary Stampeders]]. This was also their first home playoff win since 1976. The team then followed up with a 26<U+2013>17 win at [[BC Place]] over the [[BC Lions]] in the West Division final to give the Roughriders a berth in their first [[Grey Cup]] final since [[85th Grey Cup|1997]].

On November 25, 2007, the Riders played the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] in the [[95th Grey Cup]], marking the first time that the two [[Labour Day Classic]] opponents played each other in a Grey Cup game. Saskatchewan won 23<U+2013>19 in a game where [[James Johnson (football player)|James Johnson]] recorded a Grey Cup record three interceptions en route to being named [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] of the 2007 Grey Cup. Fellow Roughrider [[Andy Fantuz]] was named the [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian|Canadian MVP]] in the game after recording 70&nbsp;yards receiving and the game-winning touchdown.

A month and a half after capturing the 2007 Grey Cup, Austin stepped down as head coach to become the [[offensive coordinator|offensive co-ordinator]] at the [[Ole Miss Rebels football|University of Mississippi]].<ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/article/kent_austin_leaving_roughriders Kent Austin leaving Roughriders]</ref> In accepting this position in the NCAA, Austin turned down a very lucrative contract that the Riders had offered to return to his alma mater. On February 6, 2008, Roughriders GM Eric Tillman announced that the new head coach would be [[Ken Miller (football coach)|Ken Miller]].<ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/article/miller_named_roughriders_head_coach Miller named Roughriders head coach]</ref> Miller was formerly the offensive coordinator under Austin. The team also traded former [[CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award|league MVP]] [[Kerry Joseph]] to the [[Toronto Argonauts]], leaving the team without their Grey Cup-winning head coach and starting quarterback.

The [[2008 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2008 season]] began with a 6<U+2013>0 record with wins shared between three quarterbacks, including the season opening starter, [[Marcus Crandell]]. This was the team's best record since [[1934 in Canadian football|1934]] when they were still known as the Regina Roughriders. On August 24, 2008, the team's General Manager, [[Eric Tillman]], announced the acquisition of Quarterback [[Michael Bishop (football player)|Michael Bishop]], the [[Toronto Argonauts]] backup quarterback at the time of the trade, who went 11<U+2013>1 as a starter for the Argonauts in 2007. This was the end of Marcus Crandell's run with the Roughriders, as he was released four days later. After the 6<U+2013>0 start, the Riders would go on to finish the 2008 CFL Regular season with the same record they finished with in 2007, at 12<U+2013>6. The Roughriders finished in second place in the [[CFL West Division]] and earned the right to host the CFL West Division Semi-Final for the second consecutive year. The Roughriders suffered a devastating 33<U+2013>12 loss to the BC Lions in the western semi-final game, leading to Bishop's release shortly after the loss.

In [[2009 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2009]], the Roughriders were led by quarterback [[Darian Durant]], who had seen his first significant playing time in 2008 and was named the opening day starter. Durant started all 18 games for Saskatchewan and led the team to a 10<U+2013>7<U+2013>1 record and their first West Division regular season title since [[1976 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|1976]].<ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/article/how-the-west-was-won-riders-finish-1st How the West was won: Riders finish 1st]</ref> After defeating the [[Calgary Stampeders]] in the West Final, the team advanced to the [[97th Grey Cup]] to face the [[Montreal Alouettes]]. After leading 27<U+2013>11 in the fourth quarter, Montreal stormed back to make the score 27<U+2013>25 late in the fourth. Montreal kicker [[Damon Duval]] attempted a 43-yard field goal and missed, but Saskatchewan had been called for a too-many-men penalty, advancing the placement 10 yards. Duval did not miss a second time, scoring the three points to win the game 28<U+2013>27 for the Alouettes and adding to the Roughriders' championship woes.<ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/article/als-storm-back-to-win-97th-grey-cup Als storm back to win 97th Grey Cup]</ref>

The Roughriders celebrated their 100-year anniversary as a football club during the [[2010 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2010 season]], wearing retro-themed red and black uniforms based on the ones worn by the Regina Roughriders. The Roughriders finished second in the West with a 10<U+2013>8 record and defeated the BC Lions in double overtime in the West Division Semi-Final.<ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/article/riders-work-overtime-advance-to-western-final Riders work overtime, advance to Western Final]</ref> After defeating the Stampeders in the West Final for the second year in a row, the Roughriders faced the Alouettes in the [[98th Grey Cup]] once again. Despite leading 11<U+2013>8 at the half, the Roughriders faced a ten-point deficit in the fourth quarter. The lead proved insurmountable, as Saskatchewan lost the game to Montreal for the second consecutive year by a score 21<U+2013>18.<ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/article/twice-is-nice-als-repeat-as-grey-cup-champs Twice is nice: Als repeat as Grey Cup champs]</ref>

Following the Grey Cup loss, head coach Ken Miller resigned and became Vice President of Football operations. The club hired [[Greg Marshall (defensive lineman)|Greg Marshall]] as his replacement, but the [[2011 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2011 season]] was one to forget, as the Roughriders finished last in the West with a 5<U+2013>13 record and missed the playoffs. The Roughriders fired Marshall after a 1<U+2013>7 start and had Miller step in as his replacement. The season was plagued by errors and mishaps, most of them self-inflicted as the team could not dig itself out of their early season hole. 2011 would prove to be Ken Miller's last season with the Roughriders, as he retired shortly after the 2011 season.<ref>[http://www.riderville.com/article/ken-miller-calls-it-a-career Ken Miller Calls it a Career]</ref>

===A new beginning===
[[Corey Chamblin]], who formerly served as the [[defensive coordinator]] for the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]], was named the new head coach of the Roughriders on December 16, 2011.<ref>[http://www.riderville.com/article/the-new-coach-has-arrived-1 The new head coach has arrived]</ref> The Roughriders signed two of the top Canadian players available in free agency in non-import offensive linemen [[Brendon LaBatte]] and [[Dominic Picard]].<ref>[http://www.riderville.com/article/riders-grab-labatte-and-picard-from-free-agency-market]</ref> However, they were not so fortunate with all-star linebacker [[Jerrell Freeman]], who led the league in tackles in 2011 and departed for the [[NFL]]. The Roughriders also lost outstanding Canadian slotback [[Andy Fantuz]], who led the league in receiving yards in 2010, as he signed as a free agent with Hamilton. Nonetheless, the team qualified for the playoffs after missing out during the previous season. In 2012, Saskatchewan lost the Western Division Semi-Final game to the [[Calgary Stampeders]] in a close game 36 to 30.

On January 24, 2013, the Riders traded [[Justin Harper (American football)|Justin Harper]] and a 4th round 2014 pick to the [[BC Lions]] for six-time all-star [[Geroy Simon]]. Simon holds the record for most career receiving yards. Simon played for the Lions from 2001 to 2012. The 2013 season started off spectacularly for the Roughriders, mainly for [[Darian Durant]] and [[Kory Sheets]]. The Roughriders went 8-1 in the first nine games and set a record for the best start in franchise history (their previous best was 7-1 during the 1970 season). Running back [[Kory Sheets]] had the best start for a running back in CFL history and Darian Durant had thrown only one interception while throwing 21 touchdowns.

The [[2013 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2013]] season ended with an 11-7 record, for 2nd in the West Division, behind Calgary. The team hosted its first playoff game since 2010 on November 10th, the West Semi Finals against the BC Lions. The Roughriders would win the game 29-25, the first playoff win of Corey Chamblin's CFL head coaching career and the first since 2010 for the Roughriders. On Sunday, November 17th 2013, the Roughriders successfully defeated the Calgary Stampeders in the Western Finals, the score being 35-13. This allowed the Saskatchewan Roughriders to advance to the [[101st Grey Cup]]. This is the first time in Saskatchewan Roughrider history that they will be part of the Grey Cup in their own hometown. The Roughriders would go on to defeat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 45-23 with RB Kory Sheets winning the [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player]] Award after rushing for a franchise and [[Grey Cup]] record 197 yards to be the third consecutive team to win the championship at their home field.

===Mascots===
The current official Rider mascot is [[Gainer the Gopher]], who made his first appearance in 1977.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.riderville.com/page/gainer_the_gopher|title=Gainer the Gopher|publisher=Saskatchewan Roughriders|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> "Gainer" is an [[anagram]] of Regina and the gopher, or more properly, [[Richardson's Ground Squirrel]] (not a Gopher) is a common animal on the [[Canadian Prairies]].

===University Section===
The University Section is a notorious group of season ticket holders who occupy Section 28 in the East Side bleachers at [[Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field|Taylor Field]]. They are known for their strict allegiance to the Riders{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, standing through the entire game, and often being merciless to opposing fans who sit in the section and cheer for the road team. They enjoy taunting the opposing team's bench with a series of chanting and slandering. The University Section got its nickname from the section's main purpose in the 1980s and 1990s and was a discount section offered to university students in [[Saskatchewan]]. The section no longer serves as a university section but still retains the name because of the rowdy behaviour of the fans.<ref>{{Cite news| first = Johnathan | last = Hamelin | title =

==Fight and theme songs==
[[Image:Gainer the Gopher.jpg|thumb|Gainer the Gopher]]
The Roughriders are unique among sports teams for the amount of songs written about them{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The official Rider songs are played regularly at the stadium, and include "Rider Pride", and "Paint the Whole World Green."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.riderville.com/page/audio|title=Audio|publisher=Riderville.com|accessdate=}}</ref> and also 'borrowed songs' "Green is the Colour"(edited copy of the original "[[Blue is the Colour]]" written by D Boone and R McQueen for the Chelsea Football Club) and "On Roughriders" (edited from [[On Wisconsin]], the fight song for the Wisconsin Badgers).  In addition, during every fourth quarter intermission, the P.A. system plays the cult hit "[[The Last Saskatchewan Pirate]]" by [[The Arrogant Worms]], and the Riders Cheer Team leads the crowd in a fourth quarter stretch. There are many other songs that have been created over the years to tribute the team as well. Many of these songs have proved so popular in [[Western Canada]] that they have become [[popular culture]] [[phenomena]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.saskmusic.org/erelease/RiderMusicSearch.pdf|title=Rider Music Search|publisher=SaskMusic.org|accessdate=}}</ref> The music selection at Mosaic Stadium is mostly consisted of mainstream popular music.

The Roughriders are one of only a few publicly owned professional sports companies in North America, complete with a board of directors. The Roughriders' public ownership model is similar to the [[Green Bay Packers]] where a limited number of shares have been sold to the public. It is not possible to resell these shares, no dividend payment is possible and no person may hold more than 20 voting shares. A recent public offering of Rider Shares&nbsp;<U+2014> Series 1&nbsp;<U+2014> commenced in 2004 at an offering price of $250 per share<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.riderville.com/article/series_1_rider_shares___down_to_last_25_|title=Series 1 Rider Shares&nbsp;<U+2014> Down To Last 25|publisher=Riderville.com|accessdate=}}</ref>  In 2006 the ''[[Ottawa Sun]]'' reported that the Roughriders had sold around 3,000 at $250 each.<ref>http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/Ottawa/2006/03/23/1501753-sun.html</ref>  The Series 1 offering closed in 2008 after all 6,000 shares were sold.
