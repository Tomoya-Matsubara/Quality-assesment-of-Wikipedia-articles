A '''compass''' (or '''mariner compass''') is a navigational instrument for finding directions on the Earth. It consists of a magnetized pointer free to align itself accurately with [[Earth's magnetic field]], which is of great assistance in [[navigation]]. The face of the compass generally highlights the [[Cardinal direction|cardinal points]] of north, south, east and west. The compass greatly improved maritime trade by making travel safer and more efficient. A compass can be used to calculate [[Course (navigation)|heading]], used with a [[sextant]] to calculate [[latitude]], and with a [[marine chronometer]] to calculate [[longitude]]). It thus provides a much improved [[navigation]]al capability, that has only been recently supplanted by modern devices such as the [[gyrocompass]] and the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS). 

An early form of the compass (a magnetized needle floating in water) was invented in [[China]] sometime before 1044. The familiar dry mariner's compass was invented in [[Europe]] around 1300<ref>Lane, p. 615</ref>. This was supplanted in the 20th century by the liquid-filled magnetic compass. Fundamentally, the classic compass is any magnetically sensitive device able to indicate the direction of the [[North Magnetic Pole|magnetic north]] of a planet's [[magnetosphere]]. Often compasses are built as a  stand-alone sealed [[Measuring instrument|instrument]] with a magnetized bar or needle turning freely upon a [[pivot]], or moving in a fluid, thus able to point in a [[north]]erly and [[south]]erly direction.

Many enhancements to the compass have been developed.  A '''compass dial''' is a small pocket compass with a [[sundial]]. A '''variation compass''' is a specific instrument of a delicate type of construction. It is used by observing variations of the needle.  An [[orienteering]] compass consists of a ruggedized needle compass permanently attached to a transparent baseplate containing tools to assist the user in working with [[map]]s in a field setting (as opposed to in an office at a desk).

Other, more accurate, devices have been invented for determining north that do not depend on the Earth's magnetic field for operation (known in such cases as [[true north]], as opposed to [[magnetic north]]).  A [[gyrocompass]] or [[astrocompass]] can be used to find true north, while being unaffected by stray magnetic fields, nearby electrical power circuits or nearby large masses of ferrous metals. A recent development is the electronic compass, which detects the magnetic directions without requiring moving parts.  This device frequently appears as an optional subsystem built into GPS receivers. 

==Construction of a simple compass==
A magnetic rod is required when constructing a compass. This can be created by aligning an iron or steel rod with Earth's magnetic field and then tempering or striking it. However, this method produces only a weak magnet so other methods are preferred. For example, a magnetised rod can be created by repeatedly rubbing an iron rod with a magnetic [[lodestone]]. This magnetised rod (or magnetic needle) is then placed on a low friction surface to allow it to freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field. It is then labeled so the user can distinguish the north-pointing from the south-pointing end; in modern convention the north end is typically marked in some way, often by being painted red.

== History of the navigational compass ==
===Navigation prior to the compass===
Prior to the introduction of the compass, position and direction at sea was primarily determined by the sighting of landmarks, supplemented with the observation of the position of celestial bodies. Ancient mariners usually kept within easy sight of land. The invention of the compass enabled the determination of heading when the sky was overcast or foggy. And, when the sun or other known celestial bodies could be observed, it enabled the calculation of  latitude. This enabled mariners to navigate safely away from land, contributing to the [[Age of Discovery]].

=== Mesoamerica ===
Based on his find of an [[Olmec]] [[hematite]] artifact in [[Central America]], the American astronomer John Carlson has suggested that "the Olmec may have discovered and used the geomagnetic lodestone compass earlier than 1000 BC". If true, this "predates the Chinese discovery of the geomagnetic lodestone compass by more than a millennium".<ref name="John B. Carlson 753">Carlson, p. 753&ndash;760</ref> Carlson speculates that the Olmecs may have used similar artifacts as a directional device for astrological or [[geomancy|geomantic]] purposes, or to orientate their temples, the dwellings of the living or the interments of the dead.

The artifact itself is part of a [[lodestone]] that had been polished into a bar with a groove at one end (that Carlson suggests may have been used for sighting). The artifact now consistently points 35.5 degrees west of north, but may have pointed north-south when whole. It has been suggested that the artifact was in fact used as some constituent piece of a decorative ornament.<ref>{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph |coauthors=Lu Gwei-Djen|title=Trans-Pacific Echoes and Resonances: Listening Once Again |publisher=World Scientific |date=1985 |pages=21}}</ref> No other similar [[hematite]] artifacts have yet been found.

=== Needle-and-bowl device ===
By rubbing a needle on another magnet, the needle becomes magnetized and when placed in a cork and put in a bowl of water it becomes a compass. This device was universally used as a compass until the introduction of the box-like compass with a pivoting "dry" needle around 1300.

=== China ===
Due to disagreement as to when the compass was invented, it may be appropriate to list some noteworthy [[History of China|Chinese]] literary references offered as possible evidence for its antiquity, in chronological order:
[[Image:Model Si Nan of Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|right|Model of a [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC <U+2013> 220 AD) south-indicating ladle or ''sinan''.]]  
* The earliest [[Chinese literature]] reference to '''magnetism''' lies in a 4th century BC book called ''Book of the Devil Valley Master'' (<U+9B3C><U+8C37><U+5B50>): "The [[lodestone]] makes [[iron]] come or it attracts it."<ref>Li Shu-hua, p. 175</ref> 
* The first mention of the '''magnetic attraction of a needle''' is to be found in a Chinese work composed between 20 and 100 AD (''[[Wang Chong|Lun Heng]]''): "A lodestone attracts a needle."<ref>Li Shu-hua, p. 176</ref> In 1948, the scholar Wang Tchen-touo tentatively constructed a "compass" in the form of south-indicating spoon on the basis of this text. However, it should be noted that "there is no explicit mention of a magnet in the ''Louen-heng''" and that "beforehand it needs to assume some hypotheses to arrive at such a conclusion."<ref>Li Shu-hua, p. 180</ref>
* The earliest reference to a specific magnetic '''direction finder''' device is recorded in a [[Song Dynasty]] book dated to 1040-44. Here we find a description of an iron "south-pointing fish" floating in a bowl of water, aligning itself to the south. The device is recommended as a means of orientation "in the obscurity of the night." As Li Shu-hua pointed out in 1954, there was no mention of a use for navigation, nor how the fish was magnetized.<ref>Li Shu-hua, p. 181</ref> However, in Needham's publication ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Part 1'' in 1962, he proved otherwise, as Wang Chenduo had pointed out. The ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (<U+6B66><U+7ECF><U+603B><U+8981>, "Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques") of 1044 stated: "When troops encountered gloomy weather or dark nights, and the directions of space could not be distinguished...they made use of the [mechanical] [[South Pointing Chariot|south-pointing carriage]], or the south-pointing fish."<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 252">Needham, p. 252</ref> This was achieved by heating of metal (especially if steel), known today as '''thermo-remanence''', and would have been capable of producing a weak state of magnetization.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 252"/> 
* The first ''incontestable'' reference to a '''magnetized needle''' in Chinese literature appears as early as 1088 AD.<ref>Li Shu-hua, p. 182f.</ref> The ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', written by the [[Song Dynasty]] [[polymath]] scientist [[Shen Kuo#Magnetic needle compass|Shen Kuo]], contained a detailed description of how [[geomancer]]s magnetized a [[Dial (measurement)|needle]] by rubbing its tip with lodestone, and hung the magnetic needle with one single strain of [[silk]] with a bit of [[wax]] attached to the center of the needle. Shen Kuo pointed out that a needle prepared this way sometimes pointed south, sometimes north. 
*The earliest recorded actual use of a '''magnetized needle for navigational purposes''' then is to be found in [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]]'s book ''Pingzhou Table Talks'' (<U+840D><U+6D32><U+53EF><U+8AC7>; Pingzhou Ketan) of AD 1119 (written from 1111 to 1117 AD): ''The navigator knows the geography, he watches the stars at night, watches the sun at day; when it is dark and cloudy, he watches the compass.'' This of course would have been aided by Shen Kuo's discovery (while working as the court's head [[astronomer]]) of the concept of [[true north]]: magnetic declination towards the [[magnetic north pole]] away from the [[polestar]]. 

Thus, the first clear instance of a magnetic direction finder, a compass, appeared ca. 1044. However, it should be pointed out that the compass remained in use by the Chinese in the form of a magnetic needle floating in a bowl of water.<ref>Kreutz, p. 373</ref> 

According to Needham, the Chinese in the [[Song Dynasty]] and continuing [[Yuan Dynasty]] did make use of a dry compass, although this type never became as widely used in China as the wet compass.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 255">Needham p. 255</ref> Evidence of this is found in the ''Shilinguangji'' ("Guide Through the Forest of Affairs"), first published in 1325 by [[Chen Yuanjing]], although its compilation had taken place between 1100 and 1250 AD.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 255"/> The dry compass in China was a dry suspension compass, a wooden frame crafted in the shape of a turtle hung upside down by a board, with the loadstone sealed in by wax, and if rotated, the needle at the tail would always point in the northern cardinal direction.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 255"/> Although the 14th century European compass-card in box frame and dry pivot needle was adopted in China after its use was taken by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] pirates in the 16th century (who had in turn learned of it from Europeans),<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 289">Needham, p. 289.</ref> the Chinese design of the suspended dry compass persisted in use well into the 18th century.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 290">Needham, p. 290</ref> 

However, according to Kreutz there is only a single Chinese reference to a dry-mounted needle (built into a pivoted wooden tortoise) which is dated to between 1150 and 1250, but there is no indication that Chinese mariners ever used anything but the floating needle in a bowl until the 16th-century European contacts.<ref>Kreutz, p. 373</ref>

Additionally, it must be pointed out that, unlike Needham, other experts on the history of the compass make no mention of an indigenous dry compass in China and reserve the term for the European form which became later worldwide standard.<ref>Kreutz, p. 367&ndash;383</ref><ref>Lane</ref><ref>Li Shu-hua, p. 175-196</ref>

==== Later developments in China ====
[[Image:Ming-marine-compass.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a Ming Dynasty mariner's compass]]
*The first recorded use of a 48 position mariner's compass on sea navigation was noted in a book titled <U+201C>The Customs of Cambodia<U+201D> by  Yuan dynasty diplomat [[Zhou Daguan]], he described his 1296 voyage from [[Wenzhou]] to [[Angkor Thom]] in detail; when his ship set sailed from Wenzhou, the mariner took a needle direction of <U+201C>ding wei<U+201D> position, which is equivalent to 22.5 degree SW. After they arrived at [[Baria]], the mariner took "Kun Shen needle" , or 52.5 degree SW.<ref>Zhou</ref>
*[[Zheng He]]'s Navigation Map, also known as "The Mao Kun Map", contains a large amount of detail "needle records" of Zheng He's travel.<ref>Ma, Appendix 2</ref>
*A pilot's compass handbook titled Shun Feng Xiang Song (Fair Winds for Escort) in the Oxford [[Bodleian Library]] contains great details about the use of compass in navigation.

==== Question of diffusion ====
[[Image:Compass thumbnail.jpg|thumb|right|Navigational [[sailor]]'s compass rose.]] 
There is much debate on what happened to the compass after its first appearance with the Chinese. Different theories include:

* Direct transfer of the compass from [[China]] to [[Europe]], and then later from China or Europe to the [[Middle East]]. 
* Independent creation of the compass in [[Europe]], and thereafter its transfer from China or Europe to the [[Middle East]].
* Travel of the compass from China to the [[Middle East]] via the [[Silk Road]], and then to [[Europe]]. 

The latter two are supported by evidence of the earlier mentioning of the compass in European works rather than Arabic. The first European mention of a magnetized needle and its use among sailors occurs in [[Alexander Neckam]]'s ''De naturis rerum'' (On the Natures of Things), probably written in [[Paris]] in 1190.<ref name ="Barbara M. Kreutz 368">Kreutz, p. 368</ref> Other evidence for this includes the [[Arabic]] word for "Compass" (''al-konbas''), possibly being a derivation of the old [[Italian language|Italian]] word for compass.

In the Arab world, the earliest reference comes in ''The Book of the Merchants' Treasure'', written by one Baylak al-Kibjaki in Cairo about 1282.<ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 369">Kreutz, p. 369</ref> Since the author describes having witnessed the use of a compass on a ship trip some forty years earlier, some scholars are inclined to antedate its first appearance accordingly. There is also a slightly earlier non-Mediterranean Muslim reference to an iron fish-like compass in a Persian talebook from 1232.<ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 370">Kreutz, p. 370</ref>.

==== Question of independent European invention ====
[[Image:Epistola-de-magnete.jpg|thumb|Pivoting compass needle in a 14<sup>th</sup> century copy of ''Epistola de magnete'' of [[Peter Peregrinus]] (1269)]]
There have been various arguments put forward whether the European compass was an independent invention or not:

Arguments pro independent invention:
* The apparent failure of the Arabs to function as possible intermediaries between East and West due to the earlier recorded appearance of the compass in Europe (1190)<ref name ="Barbara M. Kreutz 368"/> than in the Muslim world (1232, 1242, or 1282).<ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 369"/> <ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 370"/>
* The common shape of the early compass as a magnetized needle floating in a bowl of water.<ref>Kreutz, p. 368f.</ref>
* The European compass showed from the beginning sixteen basic divisions, not twenty-four as in China.<ref>Kreutz, p. 376</ref>
Arguments contra independent invention:
* The temporal priority of the Chinese navigational compass (1040-44) as opposed to the European (1190).<ref name ="Barbara M. Kreutz 368"/>
* The navigational needle in Europe points invariably north, whereas nearly always south in China.

=== Impact in the Mediterranean ===
In the Mediterranean, the introduction of the mariner's compass, at first only known as a magnetized pointer floating in a bowl of water<ref>Kreutz, p. 368&ndash;369</ref>, went hand in hand with improvements in [[dead reckoning]] methods, and the development of [[Portolan chart]]s, leading to more navigation during winter months in the second half of the [[13th century|13<sup>th</sup> century]].<ref>Lane, p. 606f.</ref> While the practice from ancient times had been to curtail sea travel between October and April, due in part to the lack of dependable clear skies during the Mediterranean winter, the prolongation of the sailing season resulted in a gradual, but sustained increase in shipping movement: By around 1290 the sailing season could start in late January or February, and end in December.<ref>Lane, p. 608</ref> The additional few months were of considerable economic importance. For instance, it enabled [[Venice|Venetian]] convoys to make two round trips a year to the [[Levant]], instead of one.<ref>Lane, p. 608 & 610</ref>

At the same time, traffic between the Mediterranean and northern Europe also increased, with first evidence of direct commercial voyages from the Mediterranean into the English Channel coming in the closing decades of the 13th century, and one factor may be that the compass made traversal of the [[Bay of Biscay]] safer and easier.<ref>Lane, p. 608 & 613</ref> Although critics like Kreutz feels that it was later in 1410 that anyone really started steering by compass. <ref>Kreutz, p. 372&ndash;373</ref>

==== Mining ====
The use of a compass as a direction finder underground was pioneered by the [[Tuscan]] mining town [[Massa]] where floating magnetic needles were employed for determining tunneling and defining the claims of the various mining companies as early as the 13th century.<ref>Ludwig and Schmidtchen, p. 62&ndash;64</ref> In the second half of the 15th century, the compass belonged to the standard equipment of [[Tyrol]]ian miners, and shortly afterwards a first detailed treatise dealing with the underground use of compasses was published by the [[Germany|German]] miner [[R<U+00FC>lein von Calw]] (1463-1525).<ref>Ludwig and Schmidtchen, p. 64</ref>
'''
=== Dry compass ===
The familiar dry compass (commonly called a mariner's compass) was invented in Europe around 1300. The dry mariner's compass consists of three elements: A freely pivoting needle on a pin enclosed in a little box with a glass cover and a wind rose, whereby "the wind rose or compass card is attached to a magnetized needle in such a manner that when placed on a pivot in a box fastened in line with the keel of the ship the card would turn as the ship changed direction, indicating always what course the ship was on".<ref>Lane, p. 615</ref> While pivoting needles in glass boxes had already been described by the French scholar [[Peter Peregrinus]] in 1269,<ref>Taylor</ref> there is an inclination to honour tradition and credit [[Flavio Gioja]] (fl. 1302), an Italian [[pilot (harbour)|marine pilot]] from [[Amalfi]], with perfecting the sailor's compass by suspending its needle over a compass card, giving thus the compass its familiar appearance.<ref name="Frederic C. Lane 616">Lane, p. 616</ref> Such a compass with the needle attached to a rotating card is also described in a commentary on [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' from 1380, while an earlier source refers to a portable compass in a box (1318),<ref>Kreutz, p. 374</ref> supporting the notion that the dry compass was known in Europe by then.<ref>Kreutz, p. 373</ref>

===Bearing compass===
[[Image:Bearing compass.jpg|thumb|upright|Bearing compass (18th century).]]
A ''bearing compass'' is a magnetic compass mounted in such a way that it allows the taking of [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]s of objects by aligning them with the lubber line of the bearing compass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westmarine.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/WestAdvisorDisplayView?storeId=30003&langId=-1&catalogId=10001&advisor=bearing.htm |title=Hand Bearing Compass |date=2004 |publisher=West Marine |accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> A ''[[surveyor's compass]]'' is a specialized compasses made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with [[Cartography|map making]]. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 [[Cyclopaedia]]. Later, a prism and lens was mounted on top of a compass in such a way that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the ''prismatic compass''. The ''Bezard compass'' was invented in 1906, and consists of a compass with a mirror mounted above it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alexander.glueck.rshost.de/kompass.htm|title=The B<U+00E9>zard compass|last=Gl<U+00FC>ck|first=Alexander|accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> This enabled the user to easily see the face of the compass while also walking and viewing the surrounding landscape.

==Modern compasses==
[[Image:liquid filled compass.jpg|thumb|Liquid filled lensatic compass]]
Modern compasses usually use a magnetized needle or dial inside a fluid-filled capsule (oil, kerosene, or alcohol is common). The fluid dampens the movement of the needle and causes the needle to stabilize quickly rather than oscillate back and forth around magnetic north. North on the needle or dial is usually marked with [[phosphorescent paint]], to enable the compass to be read at night or poor light.

Many modern [[Hand compass|hand held]] recreational and military compasses integrate a [[protractor]] with the compass, using a separate magnetized needle. In this design the rotating capsule containing the magnetized needle is fitted with orienting lines and an outlined orienting arrow, then mounted in a transparent baseplate containing a direction-of-travel (DOT) indicator for use in taking bearings directly from a map. 

Other features found on some modern compasses are map and romer scales for measuring distances and plotting positions on maps, luminous markings on the face or bezels, various sighting mechanisms (mirror, prism, etc.) for taking bearings of distant objects with greater precision, "global" needles for use in differing hemispheres, adjustable declination for obtaining instant true bearings without resort to arithmetic, and devices such as inclinometers for measuring gradients.

The military forces of a few nations, notably the United States Army, continue to utilize older lensatic card compass designs with magnetized compass dials instead of needles. A lensatic card compass permits reading the bearing off of the compass card with only a slight downward glance from the sights (see photo), but requires a separate protractor for use with a map. The official U.S. military lensatic compass does not use fluid to dampen needle swing, but rather [[electromagnetic induction]] to dampen the needle. A "deep-well" design is used to allow the compass to be used globally with little or no effect in accuracy caused by a tilting compass dial. As induction forces provide less damping than fluid-filled designs, a needle lock is fitted to the compass to reduce wear, operated by the folding action of the rear sight/lens holder. The use of air-filled induction compasses has declined over the years, as they may become inoperative or inaccurate in freezing temperatures or humid environments.

Mariner's compasses can have two or more magnetic needles permanently attached to a compass card. These move freely on a pivot. A ''lubber line'', which can be a marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle indicates the ship's heading on the compass card. Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as ''rhumb''s), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points. The [[glass]]-covered box (or bowl) contains a suspended [[gimbal]] within a [[binnacle]]. This preserves the horizontal position.

Some modern military compasses, like the SandY-183, contains the radioactive material [[tritium]] (<small>3</small>H) and a combination of phosphors. The SandY-183 contained 120mCi (millicuries) of tritium. The purpose of the tritium and phosphors is to provide illumination for the compass. This illumination is a form of [[Self-powered lighting#Physics behind the light|fluorescence]], not requiring the compass to be "recharged" by sunlight or artificial light. The name SandY-183 is derived from the name of the company, Stocker and Yale (SandY)<ref>[http://www.orau.org/PTP/collection/radioluminescent/armycompass.htm Military Compass<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

===Points of the compass===
{{main|Boxing the compass}}
Originally, many compasses were marked only as to the direction of magnetic north, or to the four cardinal points (north, south, east, west). Later, mariners divided the compass card into thirty-two equally spaced points divided from the cardinal points. For a table of the thirty-two points, see [[Boxing the compass#Compass points|compass points]].

The 360-degree system later took hold, which is still in use today for civilian navigators. The degree dial spaces the compass markings with 360 equidistant points. Other nations adopted the "grad" system, which spaces the dial into 400 grads or points.

Most military defense forces have adopted the "mil" system, in which the compass dial is spaced into 6400 units (some nations use 6000) or "mils" for additional precision when measuring angles, laying artillery, etc.  The value to the military is that one mil subtends approximately one metre at a distance of one kilometer.

Former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries ([[Soviet Union]], [[GDR]] etc.) used a 60<U+00B0> graduation, often counterclockwise (see picture of wrist compass). This is still in use in Russia.

===Gyrocompass===
{{main|Gyrocompass}}
A '''gyrocompass''' is similar to a gyroscope. It is a [[compass]] that finds [[true north]] by using an (electrically powered) fast-spinning wheel and friction forces in order to exploit the rotation of the Earth. Gyrocompasses are widely used on [[ship]]s. They have two main advantages over magnetic compasses:
* they find ''true north'', i.e., the direction of [[Earth]]'s rotational axis, as opposed to [[Magnetic_North_Pole#Magnetic_North_and_Magnetic_Declination|magnetic north]],
* they are not affected by ferrous metal in a ship's hull. (No compass is affected by nonferrous metal, although a magnetic compass will be affected by non-ferrous wires with current running through them.)

Large ships typically rely on a [[gyrocompass]], using the magnetic compass only as a backup. Increasingly, electronic [[fluxgate compass]]es are used on smaller vessels. However compasses are still widely in use as they can be small, use simple reliable technology, are comparatively cheap, often easier to use than [[GPS]], require no energy supply, and unlike GPS, are not affected by objects, e.g, trees that can block the reception of electronic signals. 

===Solid state compasses===
Small compasses found in clocks, [[cell phone]]s, e.g., the [[Nokia 5140i]], and other electronic gear are [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices, usually built out of two or three magnetic field sensors that provide data for a microprocessor. Using [[trigonometry]] the correct heading relative to the compass is calculated.

Often, the device is a discrete component which outputs either a digital or analog signal proportional to its orientation. This signal is interpreted by a [[microcontroller|controller]] or [[microprocessor]] and used either internally, or sent to a display unit. An [http://www.robotics.com/arobot/compass.html example implementation], including parts list and circuit schematics, shows one design of such electronics.
The sensor uses ''precision magnetics'' and highly calibrated internal electronics to measure the response of the device to the Earth's magnetic field. The electrical signal is then processed or [[digital electronics|digitized]].

=== Specialty compasses ===
A range of specialty compasses would include a [[Qibla compass]], which is used by Muslims to show the direction to Mecca for prayers. Similarly, a Jerusalem compass <ref>[http://www.jewishsoftware.com/products/The_Incredible_Jerusalem_Compass_813.asp?bhcd2=1177746874 The Incredible Jerusalem Compass - kosher jerusalem compass jerusalem kosher compass<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is used by Jews to point the direction of Jerusalem for prayers.

Other specialty compasses include the optical or prismatic hand-bearing compass, often used by surveyors, cave explorers, or mariners. This compass uses an oil-filled capsule and magnetized compass dial with an integral optical or prismatic sight, often fitted with built-in photoluminescent or battery-powered illumination. Using the optical or prism sight, such compasses can be read with extreme accuracy when taking bearings to an object, often to fractions of a degree. Most of these compasses are designed for heavy-duty use, with solid metal housings, and many are fitted for tripod mounting for additional accuracy.

== Using a compass ==
[[Image:CompassUseMapMarked.jpg|thumb|Turning the compass scale on the map (D - the local magnetic declination)]]
[[Image:CompassUseTargetMarked.jpg|thumb|When the needle is aligned with and superimposed over the outlined orienting arrow on the bottom of the capsule, the degree figure on the compass ring at the direction-of-travel (DOT) indicator gives the magnetic bearing to the target (mountain).]]

The simplest way of using a compass is to know that the arrow always points in the same direction, magnetic North, which is roughly similar to true north. Except in areas of extreme magnetic declination variance (20 degrees or more), this is enough to protect from walking in a substantially different or even opposite direction than expected over short distances, provided the terrain is fairly flat and visibility is not impaired. In fact, by carefully recording distances (time or paces) and magnetic bearings traveled, one can plot a course and return to one's starting point using the compass alone.

However, compass navigation used in conjunction with a map (''terrain association'') requires a different compass method. To take a map bearing or ''true bearing'' (a bearing taken in reference to true, not magnetic north) to a destination with a [[protractor compass]], the edge of the compass is placed on the map so that it connects the current location with the desired destination (some sources recommend physically drawing a line). The orienting lines in the base of the compass dial are then rotated to align with actual or true north by aligning them with a marked line of longitude (or the vertical margin of the map), ignoring the compass needle entirely. The resulting ''true bearing'' or map bearing may then be read at the degree indicator or direction-of-travel (DOT) line, which may be followed as an ''azimuth'' (course) to the destination. If a ''magnetic'' north bearing or ''compass bearing'' is desired, the compass must be adjusted by the amount of magnetic declination before using the bearing so that both map and compass are in agreement. In the given example, the large mountain in the second photo was selected as the target destination on the map.

The modern hand-held [[protractor compass]] always has an additional direction-of-travel (DOT) arrow or indicator inscribed on the baseplate. To check one's progress along a course or azimuth, or to ensure that the object in view is indeed the destination, a new compass reading may be taken to the target if visible (here, the large mountain). After pointing the DOT arrow on the baseplate at the target, the compass is oriented so that the needle is superimposed over the orienting arrow in the capsule. The resulting bearing indicated is the magnetic bearing to the target. Again, if one is using "true" or map bearings, and the compass does not have preset, pre-adjusted declination, one must additionally add or subtract [[magnetic declination]] to convert the ''magnetic bearing'' into a ''true bearing''. The exact value of the magnetic declination is place-dependent and varies over time, though declination is frequently given on the map itself or obtainable on-line from various sites. If not, any local walker club should know it. If the hiker has been following the correct path, the compass' corrected (true) indicated bearing should closely correspond to the true bearing previously obtained from the map.

===Compass correction===
{{main|Magnetic deviation}}
[[Image:MuseeMarine-compas-p1000468.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[binnacle]] containing a ship's steering compass, with the two iron balls which correct the effects of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials]]

Like any magnetic device, compasses are affected by nearby ferrous materials as well as by strong local electromagnetic forces. Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should never be used in close proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields (batteries, car bonnets (automobile hoods), engines, steel pitons, wristwatches, etc.)

Compasses used in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles are particularly difficult to use accurately, even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the vehicle's ignition and charging systems generally result in significant compass errors.

At sea, a ship's compass must also be corrected for errors, called [[Magnetic deviation|deviation]], caused by [[iron]] and [[steel]] in its structure and equipment. The ship is ''swung'', that is rotated about a fixed point while its heading is noted by alignment with fixed points on the shore. A compass deviation card is prepared so that the navigator can convert between compass and magnetic headings. The compass can be corrected in three ways. First the [[lubber line]] can be adjusted so that it is aligned with the direction in which the ship travels, then the effects of permanent magnets can be corrected for by small magnets fitted within the case of the compass. The effect of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials in the compass's environment can be corrected by two iron balls mounted on either side of the compass binnacle. The coefficient <math>a_0</math> representing the error in the lubber line, while <math>a_1,b_1</math> the ferromagnetic effects and <math>a_2,b_2</math> the non-ferromagnetic component.

A similar process is used to calibrate the compass in light general aviation aircraft, with the compass deviation card often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel. 

Fluxgate compasses can be calibrated automatically, and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading.

===Compass balancing===
Because the Earth's magnetic field's inclination and intensity vary at different latitudes, compasses are often balanced during manufacture. Most manufacturers balance their compass needles for one of five zones, ranging from zone 1, covering most of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], to zone 5 covering [[Australia]] and the southern oceans. This balancing prevents excessive dipping of one end of the needle which can cause the compass card to stick and give false readings.
