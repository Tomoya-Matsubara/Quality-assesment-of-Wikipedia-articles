'''Millennium Park''' is a public [[park]] located in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in Illinois, USA. It is a prominent [[civic center]] of the city's [[Lake Michigan]] lakefront that covers a {{convert|24.5|acre|adj=on}} section of northwestern [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. The area was previously occupied by [[Illinois Central]] rail yards and parking lots. The park, which is bounded by [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], [[Randolph Street]], [[Columbus Drive]] and East Monroe Drive, features a variety of [[public art]]. As of 2009, Millennium Park trailed only [[Navy Pier]] as a Chicago tourist attraction.<ref name=crain>{{cite news|title=Crain's List: Chicago's Largest Tourist Attractions (Sightseeing): Ranked by 2009 attendance|date=March 22, 2010|page=21|publisher=[[Crain Communications Inc.]]|work=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref>

Planning of the park began in October 1997. Construction began in October 1998, and Millennium Park was opened in a ceremony on July 16, 2004, four years behind schedule. The three-day opening celebrations were attended by some 300,000 people and included an inaugural concert by the [[Grant Park Orchestra]] and Chorus. The park has received awards for its [[accessibility]] and green design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpark.org/newsandmedia/pdfs/4.1%20Millennium%20Park%20Awards.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chicago's New Millennium Park Wins Travel & Leisure Design Award For "Best Public Space", And The American Public Works Association "Project Of The Year" Award|accessdate=June 24, 2008|date=April 12, 2005|publisher=City of Chicago|author=Ryan, Karen}}</ref> Millennium Park has free admission,<ref name=LFC>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EED71E3BF930A25754C0A9629C8B63|title= Letter From Chicago; A Prized Project, a Mayor and Persistent Criticism|accessdate=May 31, 2008|date=July 13, 2004|work= [[The New York Times]] |author=Kinzer, Stephen}}</ref> and features the [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]], ''[[Cloud Gate]]'', the ''[[Crown Fountain]]'', the [[Lurie Garden]] and other attractions. The park is connected by the [[BP Pedestrian Bridge]] and the [[Nichols Bridgeway]] to other parts of Grant Park.  Because the park sits atop a parking garage and former railroad tracks, it is considered the world's largest [[rooftop garden]].

Plans for the park were officially announced in March 1998 and construction began in September of that year.<!-- http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba/pdfs/2009/MP.FINAL.pdf --> Initial construction was under the auspices of the Chicago Department of Transportation, because the project bridges the railroad tracks. However, as the project grew and expanded, its broad variety of features and amenities outside the scope of the field of transportation placed it under the jurisdiction of the city's Public Buildings Commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbg.org/public_works/millennium_park.htm|title=Following the Money for Millennium Park|accessdate=July 28, 2008|publisher=Neighborhood Capital Budget Group}}</ref>

''Cloud Gate'' is a three-story steel sculpture that has been dubbed "The Bean" by Chicagoans, because of its legume-like shape. The sculpture is the first public artwork in the United States by world-renowned artist [[Anish Kapoor]]. The privately-funded piece cost $23&nbsp;million, considerably more than the original estimate of $6&nbsp;million. Composed of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly-polished exterior has no visible seams.

==Budget==
During development and construction of the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8&nbsp;million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra pilings to be driven into the bedrock to support the added weight, the cost of the bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3&nbsp;million.

The Grant Park Music Festival (formerly Grant Park Concerts) is an annual 10-week [[classical music]] concert series,<ref name=Mviii/> which features the [[Grant Park Symphony Orchestra]] and the Grant Park Chorus as well as guest performers and conductors.<ref name=M168/> Since 2004, the festival has been housed in the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park.<ref name = JPPMP/> On occasion, the festival has been held at the Harris Theater instead of the Pritzker Pavilion.<ref name="Harris Theater">{{cite web|url=http://www.harristheaterchicago.org/current/companies/1379|title=Harris Theater: Current Season: Grant Park Music Festival|accessdate=April 13, 2010|publisher=Harris Theater}}</ref><ref name="von Rhein, John">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-03-18/entertainment/0903170335_1_petrillo-music-shell-grant-park-music-festival-chorus|title=Grant Park Music Festival promises big 'Plans'|accessdate=April 17, 2010|date=March 18, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune|author=von Rhein, John}}</ref>

Over time the festival has had various financial supporters, three primary locations and one name change. At times it has been broadcast nationally on the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Corporation]] (NBC) and [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting Service]] (CBS) radio networks, and many of the world's leading classical musicians have performed there.<ref>Knox, p. 15</ref> In 2000, the festival organizers agreed to release some of the concerts to the public via [[compact disc]] recordings.<ref>Macaluso, p. 204</ref>

==Criticism and controversy==
===Height restrictions===
[[File:Pritzker pavilion looking north night logan reed.jpg|thumb|left|Jay Pritzker Pavilion is classified as a work of art to avoid legal restrictions on its height]]
In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated,<ref name=M12-3>Macaluso, pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref> the Board of Canal Commissioners held public auctions for the city's first lots. Foresighted citizens, who wanted the lakefront kept as public open space, convinced the commissioners to designate the land east of Michigan Avenue between [[Randolph Street]] and Park Row (11th Street) "Public Ground<U+2014>A Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever."<ref name=G3-4>Gilfoyle, pp. 3<U+2013>4</ref> Grant Park has been "forever open, clear and free" since, protected by legislation that has been affirmed by four previous [[Illinois Supreme Court]] rulings.<ref>Sinkevitch, p. 37</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=121435C3FB5CE640&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Mayor gets what he wants <U+2013> Council OKs move 33-16 despite opposition|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=June 12, 2008|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Spielman, Fran}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1212F083B836ABB8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=The taking of Grant Park|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=June 8, 2008|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=120B5E8D060726E0&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=13<U+2013>2 vote for museum <U+2013> Decision on Grant Park sets up Council battle|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=May 16, 2008|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Spielman, Fran and Art Golab}}</ref> In 1839, [[United States Secretary of War]] [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]] declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue "Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings".<ref name=M12-3/> 

[[Aaron Montgomery Ward]], who is known both as the inventor of [[mail order]] and the protector of Grant Park, twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and to keep it from building new ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/538.html|title=Grant Park|accessdate=July 28, 2008|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|author=Grinnell, Max}}</ref><ref>Macaluso, pp. 23<U+2013>25</ref>  In 1890, arguing that Michigan Avenue property owners held [[easement]]s on the park land, Ward commenced legal actions to keep the park free of new buildings. In 1900, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that all landfill east of Michigan Avenue was subject to dedications and easements.<ref>City of Chicago v. A Montgomery Ward, 169 Ill. 392 (1897)</ref>  In 1909, when Ward sought to prevent the construction of the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in the center of the park, the courts affirmed his arguments.<ref>Gilfoyle, p. 16</ref><ref>E. R. Bliss v. A. Montgomery Ward, 198 Ill. 104; A. Montgomery Ward v. Field Museum of Natural History, 241 Ill. 496 (1909); and South Park Commissioners v. Ward & Co., 248 Ill. 299</ref>  

As a result, the city has what are termed Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park. However, the ''Crown Fountain'' and the {{convert|139|ft|m|adj=on}} Pritzker Pavilion were exempt from the height restrictions, because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures.<ref name=G181>Gilfoyle, p. 181</ref><ref name=IafoGPCmfasr/> According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the pavilion is described as a work of art to dodge the protections established by Ward, who is said to continue to rule and protect Grant Park from his grave.<ref name=IafoGPCmfasr/> The Harris Theater, which is adjacent to Pritzker Pavilion, was built almost entirely underground to avoid the height restrictions.<ref name=G181/>  The height of the ''Crown Fountain'', which is also exempted as a work of art, has been described as stemming from a "pissing contest" with other park feature artists.<ref name=G290-1/><ref name=G181/>

===Financial issues===
The Millennium Park project has been the subject of some criticism since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; ''The New York Times'' reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign.<ref name=LFC/> The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.<ref name=cloutheavycafe>{{cite news |first1=Tim |last1=Novak |first2=Steve |last2=Warmbir |first3=Robert |last3=Herguth |first4=Mark |last4=Brown|title=City puts heat on clout-heavy cafe; Changes ordered at Park Grill, with Daley cronies among backers |work=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=February 11, 2005 |page=6, News section}}</ref><ref name=oversight>{{cite news |title= Millennium Park oversight plan advances  |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=May 9, 2007  |first=Fran |last=Spielman|page=66, Financial section}}</ref>
[[Image:SBC Plaza.JPG|thumb|A corporate underwriter's stone marker. ([[SBC Communications|SBC]] Plaza is now [[AT&T Plaza]].)]]
Concerns have also been raised over the mixed use of taxpayer and corporate funding and associated naming rights for sections of the park. While a monument in Wrigley Square honors the park's many private and corporate donors, many park features are also named for their corporate underwriters, with the sponsors' names prominently indicated with stone markers (The Boeing Gallery, The Exelon Pavilion, The AT&T Plaza, The Wrigley Square). Some critics have deemed this to be inappropriate for a public space. Julie Deardorff, ''Chicago Tribune'' health and fitness reporter, described the naming of the McDonald's Cycle Center as a continuation of the "&nbsp;'McDonaldization' of America" and as somewhat "insidious" because the company is making itself more prominent as the social sentiment is to move away from [[fast food]].<ref name=IMismnam/> Timothy Gilfoyle, author of ''Millennium Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark'', notes that a controversy surrounds the "tasteless" corporate naming of several of the Park's features, including the BP Bridge, named for an [[Oil major|oil company]].<ref>Gilfoyle, p. 345.</ref>  Naming rights were sold for high fees,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EED71E3BF930A25754C0A9629C8B63|title=Letter from Chicago; A Prized Project, a Mayor and Persistent Criticism |accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=July 13, 2004|author=Kinzer, Stephen|work=The New York Times}}</ref> and Gilfoyle was not the only one who chastised park officials for selling naming rights to the highest bidder.

Ticket prices for both the Harris Theater and the Pritzker Pavilion have been controversial. John von Rhein of the ''Chicago Tribune'' notes that the theater's size poses a challenge to performers attempting to fill its seats, and feels that it overemphasizes high-priced events.<ref name = "von Rhein">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-09-14/news/0809120449_1_eighth-blackbird-chicago-symphony-harris-theater|title=Expanding audiences and ambitions|accessdate=April 15, 2010|date=September 14, 2008|work=Chicago Tribune|author=von Rhein, John}}</ref>  In 2009<U+2013>2010, the theater introduced two discounted ticket programs:<ref name=CHTtWBBaLLi2/> a $5 lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-09-04/entertainment/0909030160_1_troupe-hubbard-street-dance-chicago-dance-lovers|title=Harris Theater ushers in lunchtime dance performances|accessdate=April 13, 2010|date=September 4, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Smith, Sid}}</ref> and a $10 ticket program for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90&nbsp;minutes before performances.<ref name=CHTtWBBaLLi2/>  Once the pavilion was built, the initial plan was that the lawn seating would be free for all events.

Almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events in 2005 and 2006.

===Surveillance cameras===
In November 2006, the ''Crown Fountain'' became the focus of a public controversy when the city added [[surveillance camera]]s atop each tower. Purchased with a $52&nbsp;million [[Department of Homeland Security]] grant, the cameras augmented eight others covering all of Millennium Park.<ref name=Asaaclp/> City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but not Plensa himself.<ref name=Janega/> Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras as inappropriate and a blight on the towers.<ref name=ATWABS/><ref name=Janega/>  The city said that the cameras would be replaced with permanent, less intrusive models in several months;<ref name=ATWABS/> it contended that the cameras, similar to those used throughout Chicago in high-crime areas and at traffic intersections, had been added largely for security reasons but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out LED lights on the fountain.<ref name=Janega/> The ''Chicago Tribune'' published an article on the cameras and the public reaction; the cameras were removed the next day, with Plensa's support.<ref name=ATWABS/>
