'''Bethlehem''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''<U+0628><U+064A><U+062A> <U+0644><U+062D><U+0645>''' {{Audio|ArBethlehem.ogg|'''Bayt La<U+1E25>m'''}} "house of meat"; [[Standard Hebrew]] '''<U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05EA> <U+05DC><U+05D7><U+05DD>''' "house of bread", '''Bet l<U+00E9><U+1E25>em''' / '''Bet l<U+00E1><U+1E25>em'''; [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''B<U+00EA><U+1E6F> l<U+00E9><U+1E25>em''' / ''' B<U+00EA><U+1E6F> l<U+0101><U+1E25>em'''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''<U+0392><U+03B7><U+03B8><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03AD><U+03BC>''') is a city in the [[Bethlehem Governorate]] of the [[West Bank]] under [[Palestinian Authority]] considered a central hub of Palestinian cultural and tourism industries. It is inhabited by one of the oldest Christian communities but now has a Muslim majority, its Christian minority's emigration having accelerated in recent years due to political and economic factors.

The city has great significance for all [[Christians]] as it was the birthplace of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] according to the Gospels. The traditional site of [[Rachel's tomb]], which is an important holy site in [[Judaism]], lies at the city's outskirts. Bethlehem is also home to one of largest [[Palestinian Christian]] communities in the Middle East. It lies about 10 km (6 mi) south of [[Jerusalem]], standing at an elevation of about 765 m (2,510 ft) above the sea, thus 30 m (100 ft) higher than Jerusalem. The Bethlehem [[agglomeration]] includes the small towns of [[Beit Jala]] and [[Beit Sahour]], the latter also having Biblical significance.

The [[Church of the Nativity]], built by [[Constantine the Great]] in 330, stands in the centre of Bethlehem over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, which according to Christian tradition is the place where Jesus was born. This is perhaps the oldest existing Christian church in the world. Close to it is another grotto, where [[Jerome]] the Latin father spent thirty years of his life in translating the Scriptures into Latin (see [[Vulgate]]).

Bethlehem is home to [[Bethlehem University]], a [[Roman Catholic]] institution which was founded under the direction of the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

==Geography==
According to the Bethlehem Municipality, the city has a total area of 6.0 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (2.3 [[square miles|m<U+00B2>]]), all land. <ref>Bethlehem Public Relations Department, January 3, 2007</ref>

==History==

===Biblical===
The city, located in  the "hill country" of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], was originally called [[Ephrath]] (Gen. 35:16, 19; 48:7; Ruth 4:11). It was also called Beth-lehem Ephratah (Micah 5:2), Beth-lehem-judah (1 Sam. 17:12), and "the city of [[David]]" (Luke 2:4). It is first noticed in Scripture as the place where [[Rachel]] died and was buried "by the wayside," directly to the north of the city (Gen. 48:7). [[Rachel's tomb]] is located at the roadside near Bethlehem. The valley to the east was the scene of the story of [[Ruth]] the [[Moab]]itess. There are the fields in which she gleaned, and the path by which she and [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] returned to the town.
<U+1E6F>
====City of David====
Bethlehem is the birth-place of [[David]], the second king of Israel, and it is also the place where he was anointed as king by [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] (1 Sam. 16:4-13); and then, it was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his heroes brought water for him at the risk of their lives when he was in the cave of [[Adullam]] (2 Sam. 23:13-17).

====Jesus' birthplace====
Since it was distinguished above every other city as the birth-place of "Him whose goings forth have been of old" (Micah 5:2), it was here that the birth of [[Christ]] was expected. Accordingly, the [[gospel]]s ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2:4 and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 2:1) report that [[Jesus]], whom they proclaim as the Messiah, was born in Bethlehem, although he grew up in [[Nazareth]]. Matthew reports that [[Herod the Great|Herod]] had "all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under" [[Massacre of the Innocents|killed when Jesus was born]] (Matt. 2:16, 18; Jer. 31:15). Jesus' family escaped this fate for him, by [[Flight into Egypt|fleeing to Egypt]] and then returning after Herod had died, shortly thereafter.

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
[[Image:BethlehemInsideCN.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Interior of the Church of the Nativity]]
The city was wrecked during [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] (132-135) and the Romans set up a shrine to [[Adonis]] on the site of the Nativity.  Only in 326 was the first Christian church constructed, when [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], the mother of the first Christian emperor, [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], visited Bethlehem.

During the [[Samaritan revolt]] of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed, but they were soon rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In 614, the [[Persians]] invaded Palestine and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the Church of the Nativity on seeing the [[magi]] depicted in Persian clothing in one of the mosaics.

===Arab rule and the Crusades===
In 637, shortly after [[Jerusalem]] was captured by the Muslim armies, the Caliph [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] visited Bethlehem and promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use.

In 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]], who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The town prospered under their rule. On Christmas Day 1100 [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], first king of the Frankish [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a [[Roman Catholic|Latin]] episcopate was also established in the town.

In the 1160s the nave of the [[Church of the Nativity]] was redecorated with mosaics showing the councils of the church. An ally of King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]] of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], was one of the patrons of the work. On the south wall, an inscription in Greek reads: "the present work was finished by Ephraim the monk, painter and mosaicist, in the reign of the great emperor Manuel Porphyrogenitos Comnenus and in the time of the great king of Jerusalem, Amalric." Interestingly, the emperor's name was placed first, in recognition of his role as overlord and protector of the Crusaders at the time.

However, in 1187, [[Saladin]] captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders, and the Latin clerics were forced to leave. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, the town suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade. Bethlehem was briefly returned to Crusader control by treaty between 1229 and 1244. In 1250, with the coming to power of [[Rukn al-Din Baibars]], tolerance of Christianity declined, clergy left the town, and in 1263 the walls of the town were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to the town over the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica, and in 1347 the [[Franciscans]] gained possession of the Grotto of the Nativity as well as the right to administer and maintain the Basilica.

===Bethlehem under the Ottoman Empire===
[[Image:Bethlehem1894.png|thumb|300 px|View of Bethlehem in 1894 with pilgrims (drawing by Karl Oenike)]]
During the years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control from 1517 on, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches.

From 1831 to 1841 Palestine was under the rule of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]. During this period the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter by troops, apparently as a reprisal for murder and rape. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once more, and so it remained until the end of the [[First World War]] and the imposition of the [[British Mandate of Palestine]].

===Twentieth century===
In the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s [[1947 UN Partition Plan|1947 resolution to partition Palestine]], Bethlehem was included in the special [[Corpus separatum|international enclave]] of [[Jerusalem]] to be administered by the [[United Nations]]. [[Jordan]] occupied the city during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. Many refugees from areas captured by [[Israeli]] forces in 1947 - 1948 came to Bethlehem, setting up encampments in the north of the city near the road to Jerusalem and on the hillside to the south between the city and Solomon's Pools. These later became the official refugee camps of Beit Jibrin (or al-'Azza) and 'A'ida (in the north) and [[Deheisheh]] in the south. This influx of refugees changed the demography of Bethlehem considerably, changing the Christian majority into a minority.

Jordan retained control of the city until the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], when Bethlehem was captured by Israel along with the rest of the [[West Bank]].

On [[December 21]], [[1995]], Bethlehem became one of the areas under the full control of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in conformance with the [[Oslo Accords]]. It is capital of the [[Bethlehem Governorate]]. The current population of the town is about 40,000. The Christian population is a decreasing minority, 12% in 2006, but a special statute requires that the mayor and a majority of the municipal council must nevertheless be Christian.<ref>[www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=423126&in_page_id=1770 ]</ref> The mayor is [[Victor Batarseh]].

==Recent events==
===Church of the Nativity Siege===

{{main|Siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem}}
With the escalation of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], Bethlehem has been the site of many confrontations. In May 2002, during an [[Israel Defense Forces]] raid into the city, a number of locals (some of whom were armed) occupied the [[Church of the Nativity]]. It became the site of a 5-week stand-off. The number of people inside was estimated between 120 and 240. It was alleged by Palestinians that several Palestinians inside the church compound were shot dead by Israeli snipers during the siege. The siege ended with an agreement for 13 militants to be sent via Cyprus to various European counties and another 26 to be sent to Gaza. The rest were set free. The IDF stated that 40 explosive devices were found and removed from the compound after the standoff was concluded. [http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2002/05/10/church_bethle020510]

===Movement restrictions===
[[Image:BethlehemRoad.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Main entrance into Bethlehem from Jerusalem, July 2005]]
Most entrances into and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the [[West Bank]] are currently subject to [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|Israeli checkpoint]]s and roadblocks, with the level of access varying based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Israeli-controlled Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Acquiring such permits to enter, what in the past served in many ways as an urban anchor to Bethlehem, has become exceedingly rare <ref name=OCHA>{{cite web|title=Costs of Conflict: The Changing Face of Bethlehem|publisher=United Nations|author=Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) & Office of the Special Coordinator for the Peace Process in the Middle East|date=December 2004|url=http://www.miftah.org/Doc/Reports/2004/Beth_Rep_Dec04_En.pdf]}}</ref> since the onset of the violence surrounding the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], though Israel has subsequently erected a terminal for the stated-aim of easing transit between the two adjoining cities. After the Intifada's onset, Bethlehem was periodically placed under strict curfews which prevent residents from leaving their homes. [[Palestinians]] are not allowed to enter the Jewish holy site of [[Rachel's Tomb]], which is on the outskirts of the city. Since Bethlehem and the nearby biblical [[Solomon's Pools]] lie in [[Oslo Accords|Area A]], [[Israel]]i citizens cannot go there without a permit from the Israeli military authorities.

===West Bank barrier===
The construction by Israel of the [[West Bank barrier]] has had a severely negative impact on Bethlehem; politically, socially, and economically. <ref name=OCHA/> The barrier runs along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within metres of houses in 'A'ida refugee camp on the one side, and the [[Jerusalem]] municipality on the other.

==Christian minority==
{{seealso|Palestinian Christian}}
The percentage of Christians in the population of Bethlehem has been steadily falling, above all due to continuous emigration, as well as owing to the lower birth rate among the local Christians compared to the Muslims. In 1947, Christians accounted for 75 percent of the population of Bethlehem, but by 1998, their share had dropped to 33 percent.<ref>Pacini, Andrea. "Socio-Political and Community Dynamics of Arab Christians in Jordan, Israel, and the Autonomous Palestinian Territories". In Andrea Pacini, ed. ''Christian Communities in the Arab Middle East: the Challenge of the Future'', p. 282. Clarendon Press, 1998. ISBN 0-19-829388-7</ref> Bethlehem's former mayor, Hanna Nasser, says an estimated 2,000 Christians in Bethlehem have emigrated during the period of 2000 - 2003.

On this subject, the current mayor of Bethlehem, Dr. [[Victor Batarseh]] explains that, "Due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority, and it is because it is easier for a Christian family to emigrate, because they have family abroad already, in the U.S. in South or Central America, or Australia, or Canada," said Dr. Batarseh. "That is why Christian emigration is more apparent. We need this city to remain as a model of co-existence between the two religions. The more emigration we get this model will dissolve." <ref>{{cite news|title=Christians Disappearing in the Birthplace of Jesus|author=Jim Teeple|publisher=Voice of America|date=24 December 2005|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-12/2005-12-24-voa17.cfm?CFID=43253380&CFTOKEN=44091067}}</ref> 

The [[Palestinian Authority]] rule following the [[Oslo Accords]] officially promised equality to Christians of the Bethlehem area, but at times corruption in its judiciary enabled theft from them, and tolerated or even favoured the attempts by religious zealots to enforce [[Sharia]] on the Christian population. On occasion the lawless atmosphere witnessed violence such as a 1997 incident where PA Police opened fire on and wounded six Christian residents of [[Beit Sahour]]. During the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], the [[Tanzim]] [[The shooting on Gilo|staged shootings onto Israeli homes]] from Christian homes and institutions in [[Beit Jala]] against the wishes of the inhabitants, and Israeli return fire often destroyed the firing positions, which was especially linked to Christian flight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp490.htm|publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]|title=The Beleaguered Christians of the Palestinian-Controlled Areas|author=David Raab|date=[[5 January]][[2003]]}}</ref><ref>Associated Press, as reported in Yoram Ettinger, "The Islamization of Bethlehem by Arafat," Jerusalem Cloakroom #117, Ariel Center for Policy Research, December 25, 2001</ref>

During his March 2000 visit to Bethlehem, [[Pope John Paul II]] urged Palestinian Christians: "Do not be afraid to preserve your Christian heritage and Christian presence in Bethlehem."<ref>http://198.62.75.1/www1/ofm/sites/TSbtppHOMen.html</ref>

As owners of many of the hotels and services which cater to foreign tourists, the violence and resultant tourism downturn of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] also affected the Christian minority severely, leaving many economically stricken.<ref name=DailyMail>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=423126&in_page_id=1770|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|title=O, Muslim town of Bethlehem...|author=Elizabeth Day|date=[[December 16]][[2006]]}}</ref> A statistical analysis of why Christians are leaving the area blamed the lack of economic and educational opportunities, especially due to the Christians' middle-class status and higher education.<ref>Leonard Marsh, Palestinian Christianity <U+2013> A Study in Religion and Politics, International Journal for the Study of the Christian Church, Vol. 57, No. 7, July 2005, 147<U+2013>166.</ref>

The current [[Hamas]] government's official position has also been to support the city's Christian population, which it feels can be useful in negotiating with the United States, though it has also been criticised for taking steps seen as trying to impose Islam on Christian neighbourhoods. Under Hamas, the Christian population has continued to suffer from a lack of law and order which has left it susceptible to land theft by elements that take advantage of ineffective courts and the reality that the often affluent, but not politically powerful, Christian population is unlikely to stand up for itself.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881946344&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|title=Is Christianity dying in Bethlehem?|author=Joerg Luyken|date=[[21 December]][[2006]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&cid=1167467807655&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|title=Bethlehem Christians fear neighbors|author=[[Khaled Abu Toameh]]|date=[[January 25]][[2007]]}}</ref><ref name=DailyMail/>  <ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/world/middleeast/11christians.html?_r=1&oref=slogin</ref>
