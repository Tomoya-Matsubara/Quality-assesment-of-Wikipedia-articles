The '''Falkland Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|f|<U+0254><U+02D0>|l|k|l|<U+0259>n|d}}; {{lang-es|Islas Malvinas}} {{IPA-es|mal<U+02C8><U+03B2>inas||}}) are an [[archipelago]] in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the [[Patagonian Shelf]]. The principal islands are about 300 miles (500&nbsp;km) east of [[South America]]'s southern [[Patagonia]]n coast, at a latitude of about 52<U+00B0>S. The archipelago, with an area of 4,700 square miles (12,200&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), comprises [[East Falkland]], [[West Falkland]] and 776 smaller islands. As a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]], the Falklands have [[self-governing|internal self-governance]], with the [[United Kingdom]] taking responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands' capital is [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], on East Falkland.

Controversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had [[France|French]], [[Great Britain|British]], [[Spain|Spanish]], and [[Argentina|Argentine]] settlements. Britain [[Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)|reasserted its rule in 1833]], although Argentina maintained its [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|claim]] to the islands. In 1982, after Argentina's [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invasion of the islands]], the [[Falklands War]] resulted in the surrender of Argentine forces and the return of the islands to British administration.

The population (2,932 inhabitants in 2012){{efn-ua|The estimate excludes military personnel serving in the Falkland Islands and their dependents.<ref name=census2012/>}} primarily consists of native [[Falkland Islanders]], the majority of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] and [[Scandinavia]]n. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], and [[Chile]] has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], Falkland Islanders are legally [[British nationality law|British citizens]].

The islands lie on the boundary of the [[Oceanic climate|subarctic and temperate maritime climate]] zones, with both major islands having mountain ranges reaching  {{convert|700|m|ft|disp=flip}}. They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from introduced species. Major economic activities include fishing, tourism and sheep farming, with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports. Oil exploration, licensed by the [[Falkland Islands Government]], remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.

==Etymology==
{{see also|List of Falkland Islands placenames}}

The Falkland Islands take their name from the [[Falkland Sound]], a [[strait]] separating the archipelago's two main islands.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p = 73}} The name "Falkland" was applied to the channel by [[John Strong (mariner)|John Strong]], captain of an [[Kingdom of England|English]] expedition, which landed on the islands in 1690. Strong named the strait in honour of [[Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland]], the [[Treasurer of the Navy]] who sponsored their journey.<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Dotan|2010|p = 165}},
* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.</ref> The Viscount's title originates from the town of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]], [[Scotland]], whose name comes from "folkland" (land held by [[Anglo-Saxon law#Folk-right and privilege|folk-right]]).{{sfn|Room|2006|p = 129}} The name was not applied to the islands until 1765, when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] captain [[John Byron]] of the [[Royal Navy]], claimed them for [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] as "Falkland's Islands".<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Paine|2000|p = 45}},
* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.</ref> The term "Falklands" is a standard abbreviation used to refer to the islands.

The Spanish name for the archipelago, ''Islas Malvinas'', derives from the French ''<U+00CE>les Malouines''<U+2014>the name given the islands by [[Kingdom of France|French]] explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] in 1764.{{sfn|Hince|2001|p = 121}} Bougainville, who founded the islands' first settlement, named the area after the port of [[Saint-Malo]] (the point of departure for his ships and colonists).<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Hince|2001|p = 121}},
* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.</ref> The port, located in the [[Brittany]] region of western France, was in turn named after [[Malo (saint)|St. Malo]] (or Maclou), the Christian [[Evangelism|evangelist]] who founded the city.{{sfn|Balmaceda|2011|loc = Chapter 36}}

At the twentieth session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the [[United Nations Fourth Committee|Fourth Committee]] determined that, in all languages other than Spanish, all UN documentation would designate the territory as ''Falkland Islands (Malvinas)''. In Spanish, the territory was designated as ''Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands)''.{{sfn|Foreign Office|1961|p = 80}} The nomenclature used by the United Nations for statistical processing purposes is ''Falkland Islands (Malvinas)''.<ref name="std_name">{{cite web | url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm | title= Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications | publisher=United Nations Statistics Division | date=13 February 2013 | accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref>

The Falklands remained uninhabited until the 1764 establishment of [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]] on [[East Falkland]] by French captain [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], and the 1766 foundation of [[Port Egmont]] on [[Saunders Island, Falkland Islands|Saunders Island]] by British captain [[John MacBride (Royal Navy officer)|John MacBride]].{{efn-ua|In 1764, Bougainville claimed the islands in the name of [[Louis XV of France]].

Both the British and Spanish settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774, when Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily withdraw from the islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III.{{sfn|Gibran|1998|pp=26<U+2013>27}} Spain's [[Viceroyalty of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] became the only governmental presence in the territory. [[West Falkland]] was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp.{{sfn|Gibran|1998|p=27}} Amid the [[British invasions of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]], caused by the ongoing [[Napoleonic Wars]] in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except for [[gaucho]]s and fishermen who remained voluntarily.{{sfn|Gibran|1998|p = 27}}

Thereafter, the archipelago was visited only by fishing ships; its political status was undisputed until 1820, when Colonel [[David Jewett]], an American [[privateer]] working for the [[United Provinces of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]], informed anchored ships about [[Buenos Aires]]' 1816 claim to Spain's territories in the South Atlantic.<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Gibran|1998|p = 27}},
* {{harvnb|Marley|2008|p = 714}}.</ref>{{efn-ua|According to Argentine legal analyst Roberto Laver, the United Kingdom disregards Jewett's actions because the government he represented "was not recognized either by Britain or any other foreign power at the time" and "no act of occupation followed the ceremony of claiming possession".{{sfn|Laver|2001|p=73}}}} Since the islands had no permanent inhabitants, in 1823 Buenos Aires granted German-born merchant [[Luis Vernet]] permission to conduct fishing activities and exploit feral cattle in the archipelago.{{efn-ua|Before leaving for the Falklands Vernet stamped his grant at the British Consulate, repeating this when Buenos Aires extended his grant in 1828.{{sfn|Cawkell|2001|pp=48<U+2013>50}} The cordial relationship between the consulate and Vernet led him to express "the wish that, in the event of the British returning to the islands, [[Government of the United Kingdom|HMG]] would take his settlement under their protection".{{sfn|Cawkell|2001|p=50}}}} Vernet settled at the ruins of Puerto Soledad in 1826, and accumulated resources on the islands until the venture was secure enough to bring settlers and form a permanent colony.<ref>See:

* {{harvnb|Sicker|2002|p = 32}}.</ref> Buenos Aires named Vernet military and civil commander of the islands in 1829,{{sfn|Pascoe|Pepper|2008|pp=540<U+2013>546}} and he attempted to regulate sealing to stop the activities of foreign whalers and sealers.{{sfn|Gibran|1998|p = 27}} Vernet's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights caused [[Falklands Expedition|a raid]] by the [[United States Ship|American warship]] [[USS Lexington (1825)|USS ''Lexington'']] in 1831,{{sfn|Pascoe|Pepper|2008|pp = 541<U+2013>544}}{{efn-ua|The log of the ''"Lexington"'' only reports the destruction of arms and a powder store, but Vernet made a claim for compensation from the US Government stating that the entire settlement was destroyed.{{sfn|Pascoe|Pepper|2008|pp=541<U+2013>544}}}} when [[United States Navy]] commander [[Silas Duncan]] "declared the island government at an end".{{sfn|Peterson|1964|p = 106}}

Buenos Aires attempted to retain influence over the settlement by installing a garrison, but a mutiny in 1832 was followed the next year by the arrival of British forces who [[Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)|reasserted Britain's rule]].{{sfn|Graham-Yooll|2002|p = 50}} The [[Argentine Confederation]] (headed by Buenos Aires Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]) protested Britain's actions,{{sfn|Reginald|Elliot|1983|pp = 25<U+2013>26}}{{efn-ua|As discussed by Roberto Laver, not only did Rosas not break relations with Britain because of the "essential" nature of "British economic support", but he offered the Falklands "as a bargaining chip&nbsp;... in exchange for the cancellation of Argentina's million-pound debt with the British bank of [[Baring Brothers]]".{{sfn|Laver|2001|pp=122<U+2013>123}} In 1850, Rosas' government ratified the [[Arana<U+2013>Southern Treaty]], which put "an end to the existing differences, and of restoring perfect relations of friendship" between the United Kingdom and Argentina.{{sfn|Hertslet|1851|p=105}}}} and Argentine governments since then continue to register official protests against Britain.{{sfn|Gustafson|1988|pp = 34<U+2013>35}}{{efn-ua|Argentina protested in 1841, 1849, 1884, 1888, 1908, 1927 and 1933, and has made annual protests to the United Nations since 1946.{{sfn|Gustafson|1988|p=34}}}} The British troops departed after completing their mission, leaving the area "a kind of no man's land".{{sfn|Graham-Yooll|2002|pp=51<U+2013>52}} Vernet's deputy, the Scotsman [[Matthew Brisbane]], returned to the islands that year to restore the business, but his efforts ended after, amid unrest at Port Louis, gaucho [[Antonio Rivero]] led a group of "malcontents" to murder Brisbane and the settlement's senior leaders; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order.{{sfn|Graham-Yooll|2002|pp=51<U+2013>52}} In 1840, the Falklands became a [[Crown colony]], and Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community.{{sfn|Aldrich|Connell|1998|p = 201}} Four years later, nearly everyone relocated to Port Jackson, considered a better location for government, and merchant [[Samuel Fisher Lafone|Samuel Lafone]] began a venture to encourage British colonisation.<ref>See:

In the first half of the 20th century, the Falklands served an important role in Britain's territorial claims to [[Subantarctic]] islands and a section of [[Antarctica]]. The Falklands governed these territories as the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies]] starting in 1908, and retained them until their dissolution in 1985.{{sfn|Day|2013|p = 129<U+2013>130}} The Falklands also played a minor role in the two world wars as a military base aiding control of the South Atlantic. In the [[World War I|First World War]] [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914, a Royal Navy fleet defeated an [[German Empire|Imperial German]] squadron. In the [[World War II|Second World War]], following the December 1939 [[Battle of the River Plate]], the battle-damaged [[HMS Exeter (68)|HMS ''Exeter'']] steamed to the Falklands for repairs.{{sfn|Carafano|2005|p = 367}} In 1942, fear of a Japanese seizure of the archipelago caused a battalion en route to [[India]] to be redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison.{{sfn|Haddelsey|Carroll|2014|loc = Prologue}} After the war ended, the Falklands economy was affected by declining wool prices and the political uncertainty resulting from the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina.{{sfn|Bernhardson|2011|loc = Stanley and Vicinity: History}}

Simmering tensions between the UK and Argentina increased during the second half of the century, when Argentine President [[Juan Per<U+00F3>n]] asserted sovereignty over the archipelago.{{sfn|Zepeda|2005|p = 102}} The sovereignty dispute intensified during the 1960s, shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on [[decolonisation]] which Argentina interpreted as favourable to its position.{{sfn|Laver|2001|p = 125}} In 1965, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2065, calling for both states to conduct bilateral negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute.{{sfn|Laver|2001|p = 125}} From 1966 until 1968, the UK confidentially discussed with Argentina the transfer of the Falklands, assuming its judgement would be accepted by the islanders.{{sfn|Thomas|1991|p = 24}} An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971 and, consequently, Argentina built a temporary airfield at Stanley in 1972.{{sfn|Reginald|Elliot|1983|p = 9}} Nonetheless, Falklander dissent, as expressed by their strong lobby in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]], and tensions between the UK and Argentina effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977.{{sfn|Thomas|1991|pp = 24<U+2013>27}}

[[File:Falkland-Islanders.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of two men and a cat standing next to a truck on the side of a road|Falkland Islanders are predominantly of Welsh and Scottish ancestry.{{sfn|Laver|2001|p = 9}}]]
The Falkland Islands are a [[homogeneous]] society, with the majority of its inhabitants descended from [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] immigrants who settled the territory in 1833.{{sfn|Laver|2001|p = 9}}{{efn-ua|Roberto Laver argues this is likely the result of government policies which successfully reduced the number of non-British populations that at one point also inhabited the archipelago. Laver states that "naturalization ordinances" in the first decades of the British colony "show a wide variety of settlers from places in Europe, Northern, and Central America, and a couple from Argentina".{{sfn|Laver|2001|p=9}}}} The 2006 census listed some Falklands residents as descendants of [[French people|French]], [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] and [[Scandinavia]]ns.<ref name="2006Census">{{cite web |url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk//documents/Census%20Report%202006.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101216182057/http://www.falklands.gov.fk//documents/Census%20Report%202006.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-16 |title=Falkland Islands Census Statistics, 2006 |publisher=Falkland Islands Government |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref> That census indicated that one-third of residents were born on the archipelago, with foreign-born residents [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into local culture.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6683677.stm |title=Falklands questions answered |newspaper=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=4 June 2007 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> The legal term for the right of residence is "[[Falkland Islands status|belonging to the islands]]".<ref name="constitutiontext" /> The [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983|British Nationality Act of 1983]] gave [[British nationality law|British citizenship]] to Falkland Islanders.{{sfn|Laver|2001|p = 9}}

A significant [[population decline]] affected the archipelago in the twentieth century, with many young inhabitants departing the islands in search of a modern lifestyle and better job opportunities.<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Gibran|1998|p=18}},
* {{harvnb|Laver|2001|p=173}}.</ref> In recent years, the island's population decline has steadied thanks to immigrants from the United Kingdom, [[Saint Helena]] and [[Chile]].{{sfn|Minahan|2013|p = 139}} In the 2012 census, a majority of residents listed their nationality as [[Falkland Islander]] (59 percent), followed by [[British people|British]] (29 percent), Saint Helenian (9.8 percent), and [[Chileans in the Falkland Islands|Chilean]] (5.4 percent).<ref name="census2012" /> A small number of [[Argentine people|Argentines]] also live on the islands.<ref name="mercopress">{{cite news | url=http://en.mercopress.com/2013/06/28/falklands-referendum-voters-from-many-countries-around-the-world-voted-yes | title=Falklands Referendum: Voters from many countries around the world voted Yes | newspaper=MercoPress | date=28 June 2013 | accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>

The Falkland Islands [[List of South American countries by population|have a low population density]].{{sfn|Royle|2006|p =181}} According to the 2012 census, the average daily population of the Falklands was 2,932, excluding military personnel serving in the archipelago and their dependents.{{efn-ua|At the time of the 2012 census, 91 Falklands residents were overseas.<ref name = census2012/>}} A 2012 report counted 1,300 uniformed personnel and 50 [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]] civil servants present in the Falklands.<ref name="FI Guardian"/> Stanley (with 2,121 residents) is the most-populous location on the archipelago, followed by Mount Pleasant (369 residents, primarily air-base contractors) and Camp (351 residents).<ref name="census2012" /> The islands' age distribution is skewed towards working age {{nowrap|(20<U+2013>60)}}. Males outnumber females (53 to 47 percent), and this discrepancy is most prominent in the {{nowrap|20<U+2013>60}} age group.<ref name="2006Census" /> In the 2006 census most islanders identified themselves as Christian (67.2 percent), followed by those who refused to answer or had no religious affiliation (31.5 percent). The remaining 1.3 percent (39 people) were adherents of other faiths.<ref name="2006Census" />

[[Education in the Falkland Islands]], which follows [[Education in England|England's system]], is free and compulsory for residents aged between 5 and 16 years.<ref name="EDU">{{cite web |url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk/our-people/daily-life/education/|publisher=Falkland Islands Government |title=Education |accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref> Primary education is available at Stanley, RAF Mount Pleasant (for children of service personnel) and a number of rural settlements. Secondary education is only available in Stanley, which offers [[Boarding school|boarding facilities]] and 12 subjects to [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) level. Students aged 16 or older may study at colleges in England for their [[GCE Advanced Level]] or vocational qualifications. The Falkland Islands government pays for older students to attend institutions of higher education, usually in the United Kingdom.<ref name="EDU" />

[[File:Hope-Place.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two men in front of a fireplace about to exchange a drink|[[Gaucho]]s from mainland South America, such as these two men having [[Mate (beverage)|mate]] at Hope Place in East Falkland, influenced the local dialect]]

Falklands culture is "based on the British culture brought with the settlers from the [[British Isles]]", although it has been influenced by the cultures of [[Hispanic America|Hispanic South America]].{{sfn|Minahan|2013|p = 139}} Some terms and place names used by the islands' former Gaucho inhabitants are still applied in local speech.{{sfn|Wagstaff|2001|p = 21}} The Falklands' predominant and official language is [[English language|English]], with the foremost dialect being [[British English]]; nonetheless, inhabitants also speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and other languages.{{sfn|Minahan|2013|p = 139}}  According to naturalist [[Will Wagstaff]], "the Falkland Islands are a very social place, and stopping for a chat is a way of life".{{sfn|Wagstaff|2001|p = 21}}

The islands have two weekly newspapers: ''[[Teaberry Express]]'' and ''[[Penguin News|The Penguin News]]'',{{sfn|Wagstaff|2001|p = 66}} and television and radio broadcasts generally feature programming from the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Minahan|2013|p = 139}} Wagstaff describes local cuisine as "very British in character with much use made of the homegrown vegetables, local lamb, mutton, beef, and fish". Common between meals are "home made cakes and biscuits with tea or coffee".{{sfn|Wagstaff|2001|pp = 63<U+2013>64}} Social activities are, according to Wagstaff, "typical of that of a small British town with a variety of clubs and organisations covering many aspects of community life".{{sfn|Wagstaff|2001|p = 65}}
