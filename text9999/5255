'''Living fossil''' is an informal term for any living [[species]] (or [[clade]]) of [[organism]] which appears to be the same as a species otherwise only known from [[fossil]]s and which has no close living relatives. These species have all survived major [[extinction event]]s, and generally retain low [[taxonomic]] diversities. A species which successfully radiates (forming many new species after a possible [[genetic bottleneck]]) has become too successful to be considered a "living fossil".

A subtle difference is sometimes made between a "living fossil" and a "[[Lazarus taxon]]". A Lazarus taxon is a [[taxon]] (either one species or a [[Systematics|group of species]]) that suddenly reappears, either in the fossil record or in nature (i.e. as if the fossil had "come to life again"), while a living fossil is a species that (seemingly) has not changed during its very long lifetime (i.e. as if the fossil has always lived). The mean species turnover time (the time a species lasts before it is replaced) varies widely among the [[phylum (biology)|phyla]], but averages about 2<U+2013>3 million years. So, a living species that was thought to be extinct (e.g. the [[coelacanth]], ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'') could be called a Lazarus taxon instead of a living fossil. Coelacanths disappeared from the fossil record some 80 million years ago (upper [[Cretaceous]]). If, however, other [[Cenozoic]] ''Latimeria'' fossil species were to be found, the coelacanth would be considered a true living fossil, as that would fill in the gap where the species is "dead". Of course, species do not just appear out of thin air, so all living Lazarus species (excluding disappearing and reappearing [[IUCN Red List|red list species]]) are nonetheless considered living fossils, if it can be shown they are not [[Elvis taxon|Elvis taxa]].

Some living fossils are species that were known from fossils before living representatives were discovered. The most famous examples of this are the coelacanthiform fishes ''Latimeria chalumnae'' and ''Latimeria menadoensis'' and the [[dawn redwood]], ''Metasequoia'', discovered in a remote Chinese valley. Others include [[Glypheoidea|glypheoid lobsters]], [[Mymarommatidae|mymarommatid wasps]], and [[Jurodidae|jurodid beetles]], all of which were first described from fossils, but later found alive (2 species, 10 species, and one species respectively). Others are a single living species with no close living relatives, but which is the survivor of a large and widespread group in the fossil record; perhaps the best-known example is ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'' of the [[ginkgo]] genus, though there are others, such as the ''Syntexis libocedrii'' (the [[cedar wood wasp]]).

Note that just because a living fossil is a surviving representative of an archaic lineage does not necessarily require that it retains ''all'' of the "primitive" features ([[Plesiomorphy|plesiomorphies]]) of the lineage it is descended from; that is, they may possess one to many derived features ([[autapomorphy|autapomorphies]]), that have evolved since the time of their lineage's divergence. All that is required is that they can be unambiguously assigned to an otherwise extinct lineage (rarely are they ''identical'' to the fossil forms). See for example the uniquely and highly autapomorphic [[oxpecker]]s, which are not "true" living fossils (as no fossils are known yet) but nonetheless appear to be the only survivors of an ancient lineage related to [[starling]]s and [[mockingbird]]s.<ref name="Zuccon">{{cite journal |author=Dario Zuccon, Anne Cibois, Eric Pasquet & Per G.

==History==
The term was coined by [[Charles Darwin]] in his ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', when discussing ''[[Ornithorhynchus]]'' (the platypus) and ''[[Lepidosiren]]'' (the South American lungfish):
{{Cquote2
|... All fresh-water basins, taken together, make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land; and, consequently, the competition between fresh-water productions will have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly formed, and old forms more slowly exterminated. And it is in fresh water that we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order: and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world, as the ''Ornithorhynchus'' and ''Lepidosiren'', which, like fossils, connect to a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale. These anomalous forms may almost be called '''living fossils'''; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition.

===Other definitions===
There are quite a lot of (ambiguous) definitions denoting living fossils:
*A living taxon that lived through a large portion of [[geologic time]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}[[File:Elephant shrew.jpg|thumb|Elephant Shrews resemble the extinct ''[[Leptictidium]]'' of [[Eocene]] Europe.]]
:To prove this, all living specimens must belong to the same fossil ''species''. This rules out ''Limulus'', ''Peripatus'', ''Latimeria'', ''Sphenodon'', ''Didelphis'', the platypus, and many others. To allow some flexibility, the genus could be used. [[Paleontological]] [[taxonomy]] relies on hard-part [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] (the paleontological [[species concept]]), so there is a bias towards longer species turnover times, and relationships can only be inferred partially.  Modern molecular biology has shown that genetic rates of change are relatively uniform and not well related to morphological change rates.  So from a more molecular basis of interbreeding capabilities there are essentially no such thing as species that lived through a long geological time. However, with the proviso that we are using the special case of a paleontological species name, the definition does hold together in context.  [[Queensland lungfish]] (''Neoceratodus fosteri'') is an example of an organism that meets this criteria, fossils identical to modern Queensland lungfish have been dated at over 100 million years making this species one of the oldest if not actually the oldest extant vertebrate species.
*A living taxon [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] and/or [[Physiology|physiologically]] resembling a fossil species through a large portion of geologic time (morphological stasis).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2006/20061026-lamprey.html |title=The University of Chicago Medical Center: '&#39;Scientists find lamprey a 'living fossil' '&#39; |publisher=Uchospitals.edu |date=2006-10-26 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref>
:The living specimens need not belong to the same fossil species (or even genus). There must at least be some physiological resemblance.
: The coelacanth for example, is a marine fish. The [[Mesozoic]] coelacanth species lived in salt and fresh water. [[Osmoregulation]] in ''Latimeria'' is handled by ureum retention. Ureum retention is considered to be an indication of fresh water ancestry. This means that the coelacanth lineage has evolved from freshwater to saltwater.
: The resemblance between ''Peripatus'' and ''[[Aysheaia]]'' (an early [[Cambrian]] animal from the [[Burgess Shale]]) is striking (as of now, both are classified in the Tardipolypoda ([[Tardigrada]] and Onychophora), were it not that ''Aysheaia'' was a marine animal, while ''Peripatus'' lives in tropical leaf mould.
*A living taxon with many primitive characteristics.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
:This is a more neutral definition. However, it does not make it clear whether the taxon is truly old, or it simply has many plesiomorphies. Note that, as mentioned above, the converse may hold for true living fossil taxa; that is, they may possess a great many derived features ([[autapomorphy|autapomorphies]]), and not be particularly "primitive" in appearance.[[File:TrapDoorSpiderDorsal.jpg|thumb|The trapdoor spider has segmented plates on its back, making it the most ancient of all living spiders and the closest relative to the scorpions in the spider family.]]
*Any one of the above three definitions, but also with a [[relict distribution]] in [[Wildlife refuge|refuge]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
:Some paleontologists consider "living fossils" with large distributions (such as ''Triops cancriformis'') not to be real living fossils. In the case of ''Triops cancriformis'' (living from the [[Triassic]] until now), the Triassic specimens have lost most of their appendages (mostly only [[carapace]]s remain), and they have not been thoroughly examined since 1938.
*Any of the first three definitions, but the [[clade]] also has a low taxonomic diversity (low diversity lineages).{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
:[[Oxpecker]]s are [[morphology (biology)|morphological]]ly somewhat similar to [[starlings]] due to shared plesiomorphies, but are uniquely adapted to feed on parasites and blood of large land mammals which has always obscured their relationships. This lineage forms part of a radiation that includes [[Sturnidae]] and [[Mimidae]] but appears to be the most ancient one of these groups. [[Biogeography]] strongly suggests that oxpeckers originated in eastern [[Asia]] and only later arrived in Africa, where they now have a relict distribution.<ref name="Zuccon"/> The two living species thus seem to be representatives of an entirely extinct and (as [[Passerida]] go) rather ancient lineage, as certainly as this can be said in the absence of actual fossils. The latter is probably due to the fact that the oxpecker lineage never occurred in areas where conditions were good for fossilization of small bird bones, but of course, fossils of ancestral oxpeckers may one day turn up enabling to test this theory.

An organism's living fossil status can be rejected if the (smallest) clade the species belongs to is species rich, as this would imply (recent) speciation.

==Examples==
[[File:Ginkgo Stamm.jpg|thumb|upright|Ginkgos have not only existed on this planet for a long time, but also have a long life span as well, with some having reached the age of over 2,500 years. Six specimens have even been known to survive the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|A-bomb at Hiroshima]], 1-2 km from ground zero; they still live there today.]]
