[[Major]] '''James Matthew Stronge''' (21 June 1932 &ndash; 21 January 1981) was a soldier and [[Ulster unionism|Unionist]] MP in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], and the later [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]]. He was the son and heir of [[Norman Stronge|Sir Norman Stronge, Bt]], who were both killed by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] at his family home, [[Tynan Abbey]]. 

== Life and career ==
Born into an aristocratic family, he was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]].  

He served as [[Ulster Unionist]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for Mid-Armagh for three years until the prorogation of [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] in 1972 and a member of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973]]-1974.  

Stronge was also an officer in the [[Grenadier Guards]]. Having withdrawn from political and military life, his main interests since were confined to [[merchant banking]] and service as a [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] Reserve Constable.

== Death ==
Stronge was killed alongside his elderly father Sir [[Norman Stronge|Norman]], by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] in the library of his home, [[Tynan Abbey]], on the evening of 21 January 1981.<ref>[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/biographies.html Biographies of Members of the Northern Ireland House of Commons]</ref>

The [[Stronge Baronets|Stronge family's]] home was then burnt to the ground. The bodies of  father and son were later recovered from their blazing home. On seeing the explosions at the house (and a [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flare]] Sir Norman had lit in an attempt to alert the authorities), [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|policemen]] and British troops arrived at the scene and established a road-block at the gate lodge. They encountered at least eight fleeing gunmen. There followed a gunfight lasting 20 minutes in which at least 200 shots were fired. There were no casualties among the security forces.<ref>[http://www.turtlebunbury.com/history/history_family/hist_family_stronge.htm Stronge of Tynan Abbey, Co. Armagh] Turtle Bunbury</ref>

Author [[Tim Pat Coogan]] stated that Sir Norman Stronge and his son were shot because sectarian assassinations were claiming the lives of Catholics, but did not state that they were involved in these killings.<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/docs/coogan/coogan93.htm 'The Green Book: I' from 'The IRA' by Tim Pat Coogan (1993)]</ref>

As Stronge was shot alongside his father, and it is not known who was shot first, he is presumed to have momentarily succeeded as 9th Baronet under the [[legal fiction]] known as the doctrine of survival.<ref>[http://www.burkes-peerage.net Burkes Peerage]</ref>. (This claim is disputed <ref>[http://www.baronetage.org/unproven.htm The SCB]</ref> <ref>[http://www.baronetage.org/succession.htm The SCB]</ref>)

Son and father were buried in [[Tynan]] Parish church, at his funeral a telegram sent from the Queen (to one of Sir Norman's daughters) was read, it stated; "I was deeply shocked to learn of the tragic death of your father and brother; Prince Philip joins me in sending you and your sister all our deepest sympathy on your dreadful loss. Sir Norman's loyal and distinguished service will be remembered".<ref>[http://www.iraatrocities.fsnet.co.uk/stronge.htm Sir Norman Stronge and Son murdered by the IRA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1984, Seamus Shannon was arrested by the [[Garda S<U+00ED>och<U+00E1>na]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and handed over to the RUC on a warrant accusing him of involvement in the killing of the Sir Norman and his son. The [[Irish Supreme Court]] considering his extradition to [[Northern Ireland]] rejected the defence that these were political offences saying that they were "so brutal, cowardly and callous that it would be a distortion of language if they were to be accorded the status of a political offence". The charges were later dropped against Shannon.<ref>[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0139/S.0139.199403240003.html Seanad <U+00C9>ireann - Volume 139 - 24 March, 1994.
