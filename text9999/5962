'''''To the Stars''''' is an album by American [[jazz fusion]] group the [[Chick Corea Elektric Band]], released on August 24, 2004 by [[Stretch Records]]. [[Jazz]] musician [[Chick Corea]], a longtime member of the [[Church of Scientology]], was inspired by [[Scientology]] founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[science fiction]] 1954 novel ''[[To the Stars (novel)|To the Stars]]''. Hubbard's book tells the story of an interstellar crew which experiences the effects of [[time dilation]] due to traveling at near [[Speed of light|light speed]]. A few days experienced by the ship's crew could amount to hundreds of years for their friends and family back on Earth.

Corea was influenced in particular by a scene from Hubbard's work where one of the main characters plays the piano, and he created the album as a [[tone poem]] piece. It was the first time members of his group Chick Corea Elektric Band had gotten together since 1991. Scientology-owned [[Galaxy Press]] reissued the book at the same time as the album's release as a form of [[cross-marketing]]. Corea later produced another album, ''[[The Ultimate Adventure]]'', also inspired by and named after a work by Hubbard.

The album received mostly positive reviews. Christopher Blagg of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' commented: "Somewhere L. Ron Hubbard was smiling," and Mike Hobart of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' described the album as "a fine programme of jazz-fusion". It reached number eight on the U.S. [[Top Contemporary Jazz]] charts in September 2004, and garnered Corea a 2004 [[Grammy Award]] nomination for instrumental arrangement for the track "The Long Passage".

==Inspiration==
{{main|To the Stars (novel)}}

Hubbard's ''To the Stars'' depicts a future where an interstellar ship travelling at near [[Speed of light|light speed]] slows down time experienced for its occupants.<ref name="himes" /> The ship's members are affected by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[time dilation]] theory, and the Earth experiences hundreds of years while only a few days have passed for members of the ship.<ref name="collins">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=504861|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|title=Elektric Band and Chick Corea Resynergize: Jazz great teams up with old band for tour, album with sci-fi literary influence|publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc.|accessdate=2008-06-06|date=December 3, 2004|last=Collins|first=James F.}}</ref> The crew have no family or friends on Earth due to the time that separates them.<ref name="collins" /> Of the album's 17 tracks, 10 are directly based on characters or concepts from the book.<ref name="cober" /> The protagonist of the book (scientist Alan Corday), the ship's captain (Captain Jocelyn), and the ship's name (''Hound of Heaven'') are all titles of tracks on the album.<ref name="himes" /> The other seven tracks are "Port Views", short musical interludes between the larger pieces.<ref name="cober" />

Corea explains at his website how he was motivated to work on music inspired by ''To the Stars'', commenting that he was inspired by a scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chickcorea.com/to_the_stars.html|work=Chick Corea - Official Website|title="To The Stars" - The Chick Corea Elektric Band|publisher=www.chickcorea.com|accessdate=2008-06-05|last=Smith|first=Christopher |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080329091001/http://www.chickcorea.com/to_the_stars.html |archivedate = March 29, 2008}}</ref> He had read the book eight or nine times,<ref name="young">{{cite news  | last =Young | first =Bob | title = MUSIC - Sci-fi on the hi-fi - Chick Corea in interstellar overdrive after inspiration from L. Ron Hubbard's works | work =[[Boston Herald]] | date =November 20, 2004 }}</ref> and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a [[tone poem]] piece.<ref name="collins" /> Previous tone poem albums by Corea include ''The Leprechaun'' (1975), ''My Spanish Heart'' (1976), and ''The Mad Hatter'' (1978).<ref name="weideman" /> The piece is Corea's first attempt at [[musical interpretation]] from one of Hubbard's works.<ref name="collins" />

"The attraction to me was not only the challenge of writing music portraying characters in a fiction book but the fact that I've had such an intimate connection with L. Ron Hubbard and his work in Scientology for 40 years now. I've been a fan of his fiction for 25 years, and once I started into the act of working with his creations, it had an extra special excitement to me," he said in an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref name="harrington" /> "Aside from the content in his message, and the fact that he's the founder of the Church of Scientology and Dianetics, the thing I loved about Hubbard was the aesthetics of his writing. There is a musical wavelength to what he does," said Corea to ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''.<ref name="gilbert" />

==Production==
Corea brought together the original members of Chick Corea Elektric Band for the first time since 1991, including [[bass guitar|bassist]] [[John Patitucci]], [[drum kit|drummer]] [[Dave Weckl]], [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Eric Marienthal]] and [[guitar]]ist [[Frank Gambale]].<ref name="himes">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60024-2004Nov18.html|title=CHICK COREA ELEKTRIC BAND "To the Stars" Stretch/Concord|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|accessdate=2008-06-06|date=November 19, 2004|page=WE07|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey}}</ref> Gambale's [[electric guitar]] playing figures prominently in some of the tracks.<ref name="himes" /> In a statement in ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', Corea commented that ''To the Stars'' represented a synergy of his three greatest passions: "My passion as a composer/performer, my passion for the Elektric Band as a perfect orchestra, and my passion for L. Ron Hubbard as the ideal artist."<ref name="collins" /> The album is his "favorite recording" out of his almost one hundred album [[discography]].<ref name="collins" />

Mike Manoogian designed the cover and book design for the 2004 hardcover edition of the novel ''To the Stars'', and the artwork is copyrighted by the [[L. Ron Hubbard Library]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Hubbard | first =L. Ron | authorlink =L.
