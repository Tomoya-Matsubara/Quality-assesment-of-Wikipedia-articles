In 2010, Sufi Imam Rauf received national attention for his plans to build [[Park51]], an Islamic Community Center, two blocks from [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] in [[Lower Manhattan]].

==Early life==
Rauf was born in [[Kuwait]]. His father, Egyptian Imam and Sunni scholar Muhammad Abdul Rauf (1917<U+2013>2004), moved with the younger Rauf to New York City in the 1960s. The elder Rauf assisted with efforts to create the multimillion dollar [[Islamic Cultural Center of New York]], the first building designed as a mosque in New York City, which took 25 years to complete and opened in 1991.<ref name=divisions>Salazar, Cristian (August 28, 2010), [http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2010/08/28/4990230-imam-behind-nyc-mosque-faces-divisions-over-center Imam behind NYC mosque faces divisions over center], ''[[Newsvine]]'', [[Associated Press]]</ref> His father, Abdul Rauf, was actively involved in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]] with [[Malcolm X]].<ref>[http://www.presstv.ir/detail/149068.html "Growing up X: daughter tells about father"], PressTV, October 31, 2010</ref>

==Career==
After his studies, Rauf focused on his religious aspirations, and became a popular leader of a New York City mosque.<ref name=UCReporter/> He also held jobs in teaching, as a salesman and in real estate.<ref name=divisions/>

Rauf has written three books on Islam and its place in contemporary [[Western culture|Western]] society, including ''What's Right with Islam'', which was later printed in paperback with the changed title ''What's Right with Islam is What's Right with America''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RgFQ06W5UrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=feisal+abdul+rauf&hl=en&ei=CeKITJSJGMP-8AaQ0bXPAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=What's Right with Islam|publisher=Books.google.com|date=|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref> Rauf served as imam of Masjid al-Farah at 245 West Broadway in New York City's [[Tribeca]] district between the years 1983 and 2009.<ref name=ASMABioFAR/>

Rauf worked to build bridges between American society, the American Muslim community and the wider Muslim world. In 1997, he founded the American Society for Muslim Advancement (originally named the American Sufi Muslim Association<ref>Godlas, Dr. Alan, [http://www.uga.edu/islam/sufismwest.html Sufism, the West, and Modernity], [[University of Georgia]]. Retrieved August 22, 2010.</ref>), a civil society organization aimed at promoting positive engagement between American society and American Muslims.

In 2003, Rauf founded the [[Cordoba Initiative]], another registered nonprofit organization with offices in both New York and [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. As CEO of Cordoba Initiative, Rauf coordinates projects that emphasize the bonds that connect the Muslim world and the West.

Rauf is a friend of the [[Nur Ashki Jerrahi Sufi Order]], and in 1983 was appointed prayer leader at their New York City mosque, Masjid al-Farah.<ref>{{cite news | title = Imam behind NYC mosque faces divisions over center | author = Cristian Salazar| url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100828/ap_on_re_us/us_nyc_mosque_imam | agency = Associated Press| date = August 28, 2010| accessdate = September 14, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 1997 he founded the American Sufi Muslim Society (ASMA),<ref>Godlas, Dr. Alan, [http://www.uga.edu/islam/sufismwest.html Sufism, the West, and Modernity], [[University of Georgia]].

British author Karen Armstrong said in the introduction to Rauf's book:

<blockquote>Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf ... is a bridge figure because he has deep roots in both worlds.  He was educated in Egypt, England, Malaysia and the United States, and his mosque in New York City is only a few blocks away from the World Trade Center.  After September 11, people often asked me, "Where are the moderate Muslims? Why are they not speaking out?"  In Imam Rauf, we have a Muslim who can speak to Western people in a way they understand."<ref name="amazon1"/></blockquote>

[[Fareed Zakaria]] praised Rauf for speaking of "the need for Muslims to live peacefully with all other religions", for emphasizing the commonalities among all faiths, for advocating equal rights for women and opposing laws that in any way punish non-Muslims.<ref name="newsweek1">{{cite web|author=by Fareed ZakariaAugust 06, 2010 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/06/the-real-ground-zero.html |title=Fareed Zakaria: Build the Ground Zero Mosque |publisher=Newsweek |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}</ref>

Walter Isaacson, head of [[The Aspen Institute]], says Rauf "has participated at the Aspen Institute in Muslim-Christian-Jewish working groups looking at ways to promote greater religious tolerance. He has consistently denounced radical Islam and terrorism, and promoted a moderate and tolerant Islam."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/17/ground-zero-imam-helped-f_n_685071.html |title='Ground Zero Mosque' Imam Helped FBI With Counterterrorism Efforts |publisher=The Huffington Post}}</ref>

==Controversies==

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], Rauf conducted training and speeches for the [[F.B.I.]] and [[U.S. State Department]].<ref name=UCReporter/>

<br>KHAN: The Soviet Union. And how this was, you know, in CIA terms, a blowback of that. That's what he meant.</blockquote>

At ''[[National Review]]'', Dan Foster wrote:  
<blockquote>When you say that the United States was "an accessory to the crime" of 9/11, as he did, it tends to blunt my ability to pick up the subtleties of what comes after. That interview was equivocal at every turn, and when moral equivalences are trotted out re: 9/11, the tie goes to "you're either with us, or with the terrorists."  In other words, we are perfectly entitled to suspect that the "accessories to the crime" bit represents the investment, while the "condemning terrorism" bit is merely the hedge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/242680/bloggingheads-mosque-and-rangel-and-socialism-and-christie-daniel-foster |title=Bloggingheads: The Mosque (and Rangel, and Socialism, and Christie) <U+2013> The Corner  |publisher=National Review  |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>  The editors of the magazine wrote "While he cannot quite bring himself to blame the terrorists for being terrorists, he finds it easy to blame the United States for being a victim of terrorism."<ref>{{cite web|author=The Editors |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/438963/not-at-ground-zero/the-editors |title=Not at Ground Zero  |publisher=National Review  |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref>

In 2004, he said the U.S. and the West must acknowledge the harm they have done to Muslims before terrorism can end.  Speaking at his New York mosque, Rauf said: <blockquote>The Islamic method of waging war is not to kill innocent civilians.  But it was Christians in World War II who bombed civilians in Dresden and Hiroshima, neither of which were military targets.</blockquote> He also said that there could be little progress in Western-Islamic relations until the U.S. acknowledged backing Middle East dictators, and the U.S. President gave an "American Culpa" speech to the Muslim world, because there are "an endless supply of angry young Muslim rebels prepared to die for their cause and there [is] no sign of the attacks ending unless there [is] a fundamental change in the world".<ref name="Frank Walker"/>

===Views on Hamas===
During an interview on New York [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] radio in June 2010, Rauf declined to say whether he agreed with the [[U.S. State Department]]'s designation of Hamas as a [[terrorist organization]]. Responding to the question, Rauf said, "Look, I'm not a politician. The issue of terrorism is a very complex question... I am a peace builder. I will not allow anybody to put me in a position where I am seen by any party in the world as an adversary or as an enemy."<ref>{{cite news |title=Imam terror error |author=Tom Topousis |newspaper=New York Post |date=June 19, 2010 |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/imam_terror_error_efmizkHuBUaVnfuQcrcabL#ixzz0rJTKPGE6 }}</ref> Sarah Palin and Lazio criticized his refusal to agree with the assessment of the United States that Hamas is a terrorist organization, and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani alleged that Rauf had supported radical causes that sympathized with Islamic terrorism.<ref name="voanews1">{{cite web|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/religion/Muslim-Group-Faces-Opposition-Near-New-Yorks-Ground-Zero-99049124.html |title=Muslim Group Faces Opposition Near New York's Ground Zero |first=Carolyn |last=Weaver |publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=July 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name="sfgate1">{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/08/03/bloomberg1376-L6KYQQ6VJ6RL01-0S5L40PLCGTPOD0RS64DV6DMFD.DTL |first=Simone |last=Baribeau |first2=David |last2=Levitt |first3=Nicholas |last3=Johnston |first4=Stacie |last4=Servetah |first5=Mark |last5=Schoifet |title=Ground Zero Mosque Plans Move Forward After Key Vote |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=August 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="sfgate1"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Haberman |first=Maggie |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/maggiehaberman/0810/Rudy_Mosque_is_a_desecration_.html |title=Rudy: GZ Mosque is a 'desecration,' 'decent Muslims' won't be offended  |publisher=Politico |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Karen |last=Matthews |first2=Beth |last2=Fouhy |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/03/AR2010080300351_2.html?hpid=moreheadlines |title=NYC panel clears way for mosque near ground zero |newspaper=The Washington Post |agency=Associated Press |date=August 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

[[File:45 Park Place Manhattan 1.JPG|thumb|Rauf plans to build [[Park 51|an Islamic center]] at this former [[Burlington Coat Factory]], two blocks from Ground Zero.]]
In 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on the plans for an Islamic center to be established at 45 Park Place, two blocks from Ground Zero: 
<blockquote>A presence so close to the World Trade Center, "where a piece of the wreckage fell", said Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the cleric leading the project, "sends the opposite statement to what happened on 9/11. We want to push back against the extremists...The location is not designated a mosque, but rather an overflow prayer space for another mosque, Al Farah at 245 West Broadway in TriBeCa, where Imam Feisal is the spiritual leader."</blockquote> It was considered to be akin to the [[Chautauqua Institution]], the [[YMCA|92 Street YMCA]] or the [[Jewish Community Center]]:
<blockquote>Joy Levitt, executive director of the Jewish Community Center, said the group would be proud to be a model for Imam Feisal at ground zero. <U+201C>For the J.C.C. to have partners in the Muslim community that share our vision of pluralism and tolerance would be great,<U+201D> she said. Mr. El-Gamal agreed. <U+201C>What happened that day,<U+201D> he said, <U+201C>was not Islam.<U+201D></blockquote>
[[Sharif El-Gamal]], chairman and chief executive of [[Soho Properties]], bought 45 Park Place in July, 2009. "It<U+2019>s really to provide a place of peace, a place of services and solutions for the community which is always looking for interfaith dialogue."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/nyregion/09mosque.html Muslim Prayers and Renewal Near Ground Zero], Ralph Blumenthal and Sharaf Mowjood, ''The New York Times'', December 8, 2009</ref>

Later, the interfaith community center was named ''Cordoba House'', after the [[Great Mosque of C<U+00F3>rdoba]], a mosque built in Spain during the Islamic occupation after being converted by the Umayyad [[Moors]] from the [[Visigothic]] Christian church.
According to the September 8, 2010 statement by Park51:<ref>[http://blog.park51.org/?p=129 Park51 Issues a Statement Regarding the Name of the Planned Muslim Community Center Being Built in Lower Manhattan], Park51, September 8, 2010</ref> 
<blockquote><U+201C>Park51 is the name of the planned Muslim community center being built in lower Manhattan. Park51 is also the name of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity that has already been established, which will fund and oversee this initiative. Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf will be the spiritual leader of the Cordoba House which will be the interfaith and religious component of the center and will reside within Park51.<U+201D><br>
About Park51: Park51 is a nonsectarian community, cultural and interfaith spiritual center along with a Muslim prayer area and a monument to honor all those we lost on 9/11.</blockquote>

Plans for the project include a mosque which would accommodate 1,000<U+2013>2,000 Muslims in prayer. Rauf won support from the local [[Community Boards of New York City|Community Board]], and received both support and opposition from some 9/11 families, politicians, organizations, academics, and others. The initiative was supported by some Muslim American leaders and organizations, including [[Council on American-Islamic Relations|CAIR]], and criticized by some other Muslims such as Sufi [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[Stephen Schwartz (journalist)|Stephen Suleyman Schwartz]], director of the Center for Islamic Pluralism in Washington.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/06/06/a_mosque_at_ground_zero/ A mosque at ground zero?]</ref> Supporters of the project point out that two mosques already have firm roots in [[Lower Manhattan]] and that one of them was founded in 1970, pre-dating the World Trade Center.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/14/nyregion/14mosque.html |title= In Lower Manhattan, 2 Mosques Have Firm Roots |work=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2010 | first=Anne | last=Barnard}}</ref>

Controversy over the location ensued, and in an interview with [[Larry King]] on September 8, 2010 Rauf was asked "...given what you know now, would you have said, listen, let's not do it there? Because it sounds like you're saying in retrospect wouldn't have done it." Rauf answered:
<blockquote>If I knew this would happen, this would cause this kind of pain, I wouldn't have done it. My life has been devoted to peacemaking.<ref name="autogenerated1"/></blockquote>

On September 12, 2010 on ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' with [[Christiane Amanpour]], Abdul Rauf repeated that if complaints had been raised in December 2009 when the project was front page news in ''[[The New York Times]]'', he would have moved it, but at that time there was broad support for it, which did not change until May. He furthermore expressed concern that a move would be used by radicals internationally to claim that "Islam is under attack in the Western world".<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/imam-feisal-abdul-rauf-islam-america-11615895 "Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf on Islam in America"], ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', [[ABC News]]; September 12, 2010</ref>

On January 14, 2011, Park51 developer Sharif el-Gamal surprised Rauf by unilaterally announcing that Rauf would no longer speak for or raise money for Park51, replacing him with Imam Abdallah Adhami.  The split was attributed to a number of differences in vision for the project -- Rauf had wanted a larger interfaith center named Cordoba House, but el-Gamal had changed the name to Park51, wanted it to primarily serve Muslims, and wanted it to have a local rather than global scope.  The removal of Rauf from this leadership role raised concerns that the project would be unable to raise the necessary funds to build the planned center. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/nyregion/15mosque.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss |title= Amid Rift, Imam<U+2019>s Role in Islam Center Is Sharply Cut |work=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 7, 2011 | first=Paul | last=Vitello}}</ref>  On January 29, Rauf announced that he would move the Cordoba House to a different site if one were offered to him and if the new site was "on par, or even better" than the current Park51 site.  He also discussed differences between himself and el-Gamal, saying ""Mr. Gamal is more focused on the Islam aspect than on the multifaith aspect of it. . . He came at this from the point of view of wanting to establish an Islamic center."  <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article327927.ece |title= Cleric open to new site for Islamic center |work=The Buffalo News|date=January 30, 2011 |accessdate=May 7, 2011 | first=Jay | last=Tokasz}}</ref>

===Statements on religious relations and Sharia Law===
Some have referred to Imam Feisal's statements about [[Sharia Law]] and the role of other religions in the Islamic communities as "radical", "worrying", "equivocal" and "deceptive". [[Ibn Warraq]] wrote in the ''[[National Review]]'':

{{cquote|Rauf says one thing to Western audiences and another to Muslim audiences. He is quite capable of writing reassuring things, as in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' earlier this year: "My colleagues and I are the anti-terrorists. We are the people who want to embolden the vast majority of Muslims who hate [[terrorism]] to stand up to the radical [[rhetoric]]. Our purpose is to interweave America's Muslim population into the mainstream society." But when presented with actual opportunities to "interweave America<U+2019>s Muslim population into the mainstream society," Rauf and most of his fellow Muslims decline. Nearly ten years ago, I was the guest of the Pontifical Institute for Arabic and Islamic Studies (PISAI) of Rome. PISAI is dedicated to interfaith dialogue between Christians and Muslims.

But as the director at the time said to me, "There is no real dialogue, since Muslims never reciprocate the goodwill gestures made by the Christians. The result is we sit down together, and the Christians say what a wonderful religion Islam is, and the Muslims say what a wonderful religion Islam is." Rauf was invited to give a sermon in a church and did so, but he never reciprocated by inviting a Christian to give a sermon in a mosque. This, for Rauf and his ilk, would be unthinkable.<ref>Warraq, Ibn. [http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/246268/one-imam-multiple-messages-ibn-warraq?page=2 "One Imam, Multiple Messages"] ''[[National Review]]''; September 13, 2010; Page 2 of 3</ref>}}

Before President [[Barack Obama]]'s planned visit to [[Turkey]], Imam Feisal, writing in the Jordanian newspaper ''Al Ghad'' on March 31, 2009, stated of [[Sharia Law]]:

{{cquote|In the United States, when we have some complaint, we say, "Hey, this is not constitutional! There must be some law." The Declaration of Independence and the subsequent Bill of Rights are the core of what we believe in. But in the Middle East, when someone has some complaint, and says, "There must be a law," he completely knows what law he means. The only law a Muslim needs is in the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]]. People asked me right after the 9/11 attacks as to why do movements with political agendas carry [Islamic] religious names? Why call it <U+2018>Muslim Brotherhood<U+2019> or <U+2018>Hezbollah (Party of Allah)<U+2019> or <U+2018>Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement)<U+2019>? I answer them this <U+2014> that the trend towards Islamic law and justice begins in religious movements, because secularism has failed to deliver what the Muslim wants, which is life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<ref>Rauf, Feisal Abdul.

===Rental properties===
[[File:2206CentralAveByLuigiNovi11.7.10.jpg|thumb|left|Building at 2206 [[Central Avenue (Hudson Palisades)|Central Avenue]] in [[Union City, New Jersey]], one of several in [[Hudson County]] owned by Rauf.]]
Rauf owns several apartment buildings in [[Hudson County, New Jersey]], including four in [[Union City, New Jersey|Union City]], and one in [[North Bergen]] in which he lives. By 2010, numerous residents of Rauf's properties in Union City had alleged that those properties have fallen into disrepair over the course of the prior several years, with some of the residents attributing this to time Rauf spends on his activities in [[Lower Manhattan]]. One resident in particular described Rauf's property at 2206 [[Central Avenue (Hudson Palisades)|Central Avenue]] as "horrible" and a "mess", describing a two-week period during the winter of 2009 in which the residents lacked hot water following the malfunction of the building's boiler. Residents have also cited rat and [[bed bug]] infestations, and have complained that such issues can take up to six months to be resolved. Union City spokesperson Mark Albiez confirmed that multiple health violations have been leveled against Rauf's properties. These allegations have added to the controversy over Park51.<ref name=UCReporter/> On September 8, 2010, Union City Mayor [[Brian P. Stack]], who criticized Rauf as a "slumlord", announced court actions to have a custodial receiver take over management of these properties,<ref name=Slumlord>{{vcite news|title=NJ Mayor Blasts Ground Zero Imam|author=David Lee Miller|work=Fox News|date=September 14, 2010|url=http://liveshots.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/09/14/nj-mayor-blasts-ground-zero-imam/?test=latestnews|accessdate=September 14, 2010}}</ref> and the creation of a Quality of Life Task Force to identify 15 apartment buildings in need of renovations, including Rauf's.<ref>Diaz, Lana Rose. "Stack puts landlords on notice" ''The Union City Reporter''; September 12, 2010; Pages 3 and 7</ref> A September 15, 2010 hearing revealed that following a September 7 inspection that determined imminent hazards, police began monitoring two of Rauf's buildings, due to inoperable fire alarms and sprinklers, and failure on Rauf's part to hire a private fire patrol. Judge Thomas Olivieri gave Rauf's lawyers until September 23 to produce plans and evidence of efforts to address these violations, lest Rauf face loss of control over the buildings. Some Union City residents questioned why the timing of these actions against Rauf's properties did not become an issue in New York City and national media, and why the long-standing problems faced by these properties were not addressed until the larger controversy over Park51 came to light, particularly given that Stack became mayor in 2000.<ref>"UC sues landlord and 'Ground Zero Mosque' imam" ''The Union City Reporter''; Pages 2 and 5</ref> On November 9, Judge Olivieri placed the Central Avenue property into temporary custodial receivership, with $7,000 in rent payments held in [[escrow]] from Rauf's attorney set aside to pay for the repairs.<ref>"Receivership granted for neglected buildings in UC", ''The Union City Reporter'', November 14, 2010, Pages 4 and 31</ref><ref>Mestanza, Jean-Pierre. "Imam's building in receivership", ''[[Hudson Dispatch Weekly]]'', November 18, 2010, pages 1 and 7</ref>

According to 2010 reports by the ''[[Bergen Record]]'', Rauf met with U.S. Senator [[Robert Menendez]] around 1991 when Menendez was Mayor of Union City, to request state funds to renovate three of his properties. As a result, Rauf received $80,000 in city funds, $384,000 from the Union City Community Development Agency, $1.3 million in construction loans from Hudson County's Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and $630,900 from the state. Rauf was also sued for fraud in 2008 by his one-time business partner, James Cockinos, over a $250,000 mortgage that Cockinos gave Rauf for his Central Avenue property, ownership of which Rauf then transferred to Sage Developments for a second $650,000 mortgage. Rauf and his wife, Daisy Khan, made payments to Cockinos for 11 years, but ceased after a fire damaged the property. The two parties settled out of court. ''The Record'' also reported that records beginning thirty years previous indicated that Rauf owned an apartment in North Bergen and in [[Palisades Park, New Jersey|Palisades Park]]. Though records indicate Rauf owns a home on 78th Street in North Bergen, a neighbor indicated that Khan is there more often than the frequently traveling Rauf, and it is unclear if he still owns the Palisades Park property.<ref name=UCReporter/>

==Personal life==
Rauf's first wife was an American woman who converted to Islam. Rauf later married a Malaysian woman. Rauf has two children with each of his first two wives. He has been married to his third wife Daisy Khan since the late 1990s.<ref name=divisions/> Khan, a native of [[Kashmir]], [[India]] is a professional [[interior architecture|interior architect]], but since 2005 has worked full-time for the two non-profit organizations founded by Rauf,<ref name=ASMABioDK>{{cite web|title=People: Daisy Khan|url=http://asmasociety.org/about/b_dkhan.html|publisher=American Society for Muslim Advancement|separator=,|postscript=|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> and at times functions as his spokesperson.
