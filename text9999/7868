'''Stephens City''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>sti<U+02D0>v<U+0259>nz}}) is an [[List of towns in Virginia|incorporated town]] in the southern part of [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick County]], [[Virginia]], United States, with a population of 1,146 at the time of the [[2000 United States Census|2000&nbsp;Census]] and an estimated population of 1,503 in 2009.

Founded by [[Peter Stephens (pioneer)|Peter Stephens]] in the 1730s, the colonial town was chartered and named for Lewis Stephens in September&nbsp;1758.  It was originally settled by German [[Protestant]]s from [[Heidelberg]].  Stephens City is the second-oldest municipality in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] after nearby [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], which is about {{convert|5|mi|km}} to the north. "Crossroads", the first [[free black]] community in the Valley in the pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] years, was founded east of town in the 1850s.  Crossroads remained until the beginning of the Civil War when the freed blacks either escaped or were recaptured.  Stephens City was saved from being burnt in 1864 by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Major Joseph K. Stearns.  The town has gone through several name changes in its history, starting as Stephensburg, then Newtown, and finally winding up as Stephens City, though it nearly became Pantops.  [[Interstate 81]] and [[U.S. Route 11]] pass close to and through the town, respectively.

A large section of the center of the town, including buildings and homes, covering {{convert|65|acre|ha}}, is part of the [[Newtown-Stephensburg Historic District]] and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992.  Stephens City celebrated its 250th anniversary on September 1,&nbsp;2008.  The town is a part of the [[Winchester, VA-WV MSA|Winchester, Virginia-West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area]], an offshoot of the [[Baltimore<U+2013>Washington Metropolitan Area|Washington<U+2013>Baltimore<U+2013>Northern Virginia, DC<U+2013>MD<U+2013>VA<U+2013>WV Combined Statistical Area]].

Town lots were laid out beginning in 1754, and in 1758 the [[Virginia General Assembly]] granted a charter for the town of "Stephensburgh".  The mostly German-speaking residents soon left off the "h"; the town was usually spelled "Stephensburg".<ref name = "History"/>  By the start of the [[Revolutionary War]], Stephensburg was often called simply "New Town" or "Newtown", as the new settlement on the [[Great Wagon Road]] south of Winchester.<ref name="History"/> 

Shenandoah Valley and Newtown's central location attracted heavy traffic through the region, and wagon-making emerged as an important industry for the town; Newtown artisans supplied wagons throughout the state.<ref>Joseph Martin, ''A New and Comprehensive Gazetteer of Virginia and the District of Columbia'', (1835)</ref></blockquote>  By 1830, the town's population had reached 800.<ref>Henry Howe, ''Historical Collections of Virginia'' (1845)</ref>  In the late 1850s, free blacks began a settlement about a mile east of town which became known as Crossroads or Freetown.  The community lasted until the Civil War began, when some of the free blacks left for the North; others were captured and forced to fight for the Confederates.<ref name="History"/>

In June 1864, Major Joseph K. Stearns of the 1st New York Cavalry arrived under orders to burn the town down to help stop Confederate ambushes on the wagon road. Because the remaining population mostly consisted of women, children and the elderly, Stearns allowed the town to stand.

In April&nbsp;1867, the Virginia General Assembly granted a charter to the Winchester and Strasburg Railroad Company.  The company was authorized to construct a rail line between Winchester and Strasburg, linking Newtown to the rest of the nation by railroad for the first time.  Though the railroad improved the local economy, which had lagged after the end of the war, it decimated the wagon-building trade.<ref name="History"/>  In 1880, the United States Post Office Department, faced with nearly a dozen Newtowns in Virginia, announced that the local post office would be renamed Pantops.

===20th century to present===
The 20th century brought improvements to energy and domestic systems: electrical service was introduced in 1915; and in 1941, just before World War II, the town installed a water system.<ref name="History"/>  The construction of [[Interstate 81]] (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town.  The wagon road, which had been made part of [[U.S. Route 11]], had led traffic through the center of town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, encouraging development east of town and causing the downtown businesses to decline.  Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.<ref name="History"/>  

The town surveyed its older buildings to establish architectural significance and to determine those that contributed to the town's historic center.  The [[Newtown-Stephensburg Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in August&nbsp;1992.<ref name="vaNRHPnom">{{cite web|author=Maral S.
