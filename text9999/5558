'''SM ''UB-11''''' was a German [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] [[submarine]] or [[U-boat]] in the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during [[World War I]]. ''UB-11'' was ordered in October 1914 and was [[keel laying|laid down]] at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]] in November. ''UB-11'' was a little under {{convert|92|ft|m}} in length and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] between {{convert|127|and|141|MT|ST}}, depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two [[torpedo]]es for her two bow [[torpedo tube]]s and was also armed with a deck-mounted [[machine gun]]. She was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed as SM ''UB-11'' in March 1915.<ref group=Note>"SM" stands for "Seiner Majest<U+00E4>t" ({{lang-en|His Majesty's}}) and combined with the ''U'' for ''Unterseeboot'' would be translated as ''His Majesty's Submarine''.</ref>

''UB-11''{{'}}s commanding officer at commissioning only remained in charge of the ship for a week. Sources do not report any more commanding officers assigned through the end of the war, so it's not clear if the submarine remained in commission. ''UB-11'' was reported in use as a training vessel at [[Kiel]] in September 1915. The U-boat made no war patrols and sank no ships during the war, which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role. At the end of the war, ''UB-11'' was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at [[Harwich]] with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was [[ship breaking|broken up]] by [[Stinnes]] in February 1920.

== Design and construction ==
After the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the [[German Imperial Navy]] found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off [[Flanders]].<!-- advance, caught w/o equipment --><ref name=Miller-46>Miller, pp. 46<U+2013>47.</ref><ref name=Karau-48>Karau, p. 48.</ref><!-- nature of waters off Flanders --> Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914,<ref name=Karau-48 /> produced the [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about {{convert|92|ft|m}} long and displacing about {{convert|125|MT|ST}} with two [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref name=Miller-46 /><ref group=Note>A further refinement of the design<U+2014>replacing the torpedo tubes with [[mine (naval)|mine]] chutes but changing little else<U+2014>evolved into the [[German Type UC I submarine|Type UC I]] coastal [[minelayer|minelaying]] submarine. See: Miller, p. 458.</ref>

''UB-11'' was part of the initial allotment of seven submarines<U+2014>numbered {{SMU|UB-9||2}} to {{SMU|UB-15||2}}<U+2014>ordered on 15 October from [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]], just shy of two months after planning for the class began.<ref name=Miller-46 /><ref name=Williamson>Williamson, p. 12.</ref> ''UB-11'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] by Weser in Bremen on 7 November.<ref name=UB-11 /> As built, ''UB-11'' was {{convert|91|ft|6|in|m}} long, {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]], and had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|9|ft|10|in|m}}.<ref name=Con-180 /> She had a single {{convert|60|bhp|adj=on}} [[K<U+00F6>rting Hannover|K<U+00F6>rting]] 4-cylinder [[diesel engine]] for surface travel, and a single {{convert|120|shp|adj=on}} [[Siemens-Schuckert]] [[electric motor]] for underwater travel, both attached to a single [[propeller shaft (ship)|propeller shaft]].<ref name=Con-180 /> Her top speeds were {{convert|7.45|knots|km/h}}, surfaced, and {{convert|6.24|knots|km/h}}, submerged.<ref name=Tarrant-172 /> At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to {{convert|1500|nmi|km}} on the surface before refueling, and up to {{convert|45|nmi|km}} submerged before recharging her batteries.<ref name=Con-180 /> Like all boats of the class, ''UB-11'' was rated to a diving depth of {{convert|50|m|ft}}, and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.<ref name=Con-180 />

''UB-11'' was armed with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} [[torpedo]]es in two bow [[torpedo tube]]s. She was also outfitted for a single {{convert|8|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} [[machine gun]] on deck.<ref name=Con-180 /> ''UB-11''{{'}}s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.<ref name=Karau-49>Karau, p. 49.</ref> After work on ''UB-11'' was complete at the Weser yard, she was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 2 March.<ref name=UB-11 />

== Career ==
The submarine was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the German Imperial Navy as SM ''UB-11'' on 4 March 1915 under the command of ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' (''Kapt.'') [[Ralph Wenninger]],<ref name=UB-11 /> a 25-year-old first-time U-boat commander.<ref name=wenninger>{{cite Uboat.net | name = Ralph Wenninger | id = 398 | type = 1comm | accessdate = 19 March 2009 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref><ref group=Note>Wenninger was in the Navy's April 1907 cadet class with 34 other future U-boat captains, including [[Werner F<U+00FC>rbringer]], [[Heino von Heimburg]], [[Hans Howaldt]], and [[Otto Steinbrinck]]. See: {{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI Officer Crews: Crew 4/07 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/crews.html?crew=4%2F07 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdate = 12 March 2009 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref> Wenninger was only in command of ''UB-11'' for a week.<ref name=UB-11 /> Sources do not indicate who, if anyone, succeeded him as commander of ''UB-11'', or if ''UB-11'' remained in commission.

According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, ''UB-11'' had been assigned to the Kiel Periscope School by September 1915.<ref name=GP-63>Gibson and Prendergast, p. 63.</ref> Uboat.net reports that ''UB-11' undertook no war patrols and had no successes against enemy ships, which may indicate that the vessel remained in use only as a training vessel.<ref name=UB-11 />

At the end of the war, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] required all German U-boats to be sailed to [[Harwich]] for surrender. ''UB-11'' was one of eight U-boats deemed unseaworthy and allowed to remain in Germany.<ref name=GP-332>Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 331<U+2013>32.</ref><ref group=Note>The other seven boats were {{SMU|U-1||2}}, {{SMU|U-2||2}}, {{SMU|U-4||2}}, {{SMU|U-17||2}}, and three fellow [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] boats, {{SMU|UB-2||2}}, {{SMU|UB-5||2}}, and {{SMU|UB-9||2}}.</ref> ''UB-11'' was [[ship breaking|broken up]] by [[Stinnes]] on 3 February 1920.<ref name=UB-11 />
