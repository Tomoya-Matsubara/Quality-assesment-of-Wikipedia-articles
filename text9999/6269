'''WNVZ''', also known as '''Z104''', is a [[Rhythmic Top 40]] outlet serving the [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]-[[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]]-[[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]-[[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]]-[[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] radio market. The [[Entercom|Entercom communications]] outlet broadcasts at 104.5&nbsp;MHz with an ERP of 50&nbsp;kW. Its COL and studios are in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]].

==History==
WNVZ originally signed on the air in [[1967]] as a simulcast of Country music outlet 1270 WTID, (which is now separately owned Religious outlet WTJZ ) but by 1973 they would break off the simulcast and  become WQRK, broadcasting a Top 40 format with custom made jingles, sped up records, and a lot of on air audio processing (Then known as  "QRK" and "Super Q" at the time).In 1975 WQRK went from live to automated Top 40,in the late 70s and early 80s they evolved into a Live Adult Contemporary format.

But that would all change in August [[1982]] when they returned to a mainstream [[Top 40]] format as Z104,and debuted the WNVZ calls and '''Z104''' name. (The station marked the retiring of the "'''Q104 1/2'''" moniker and hailed the return of the CHR format on the air with the slogan "The Half Has Become a Whole.") About a year later they were using Mike Joseph's "Hot Hits" format, which had been done in several larger markets, but dropped Joseph by summer of 1985 By [[1993]] they would evolve into a [[Rhythmic Top 40]] direction. Today, it uses the slogan '''"Today's Best Music"''' to describe its broad-based mix of [[Hip hop music|Hip-Hop]]/[[R&B]] and [[Rhythmic|Rhythmic Pop]] hits.  This pits the station against its urban contemporary hip hop/R&B competitor [[WOWI]].

==WNVZ HD2==
On April 25, 2006 Entercom announced that WNVZ's HD2 subchannel will offer an all-comedy format, which debuted in June.

==Trivia==
The station flipped its format and positioning several weeks before acquiring its new call letters in late 1982, which meant that for a short period of time the station was using a new nickname (Z104) that was completely unrelated to its call letters (which were still WQRK). This resulted in a very curious-sounding top-of-the-hour station IDs that went something like: "Z-104 is WQRK, Norfolk"
