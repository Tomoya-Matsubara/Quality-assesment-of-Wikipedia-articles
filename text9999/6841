A total [[solar eclipse]] will take place on Monday, August 21, 2017. {{Total solar eclipse summary}}

It will have a magnitude of 1.0306 that will be visible from a narrow corridor through the [[United States]]. The longest duration of totality will be 2 minutes 40 seconds at {{coord|36|58.5|N|87|39.3|W}} in [[Christian County, Kentucky|Christian County]], [[Kentucky]] just northwest of [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky]].

A [[Solar eclipse|partial solar eclipse]] will be seen from the much broader path of the [[Moon]]'s [[penumbra]], including all of [[North America]], northern [[South America]], western [[Europe]], and [[Africa]].

This eclipse is a member of [[Solar Saros 145|Saros series 145]], the one that also produced the [[solar eclipse of August 11, 1999]].

This eclipse will be the first total solar eclipse visible from the United States since 1991 (just from part of [[Hawaii]])<ref>[http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEatlas/SEatlas2/SEatlas1981.GIF]</ref>, the first visible from the contiguous United States since 1979<ref>[http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEatlas/SEatlas2/SEatlas1961.GIF]</ref>. A 1991 article in ''[[Discover (magazine)]]'' noted that "The [[Solar eclipse of July 11, 1991|total solar eclipse of July 11, 1991]]", that passed over [[Hawaii]] and significant portions of [[Mexico]], "[was] the best anyone will be able to see from the [US land] until 2017."<ref>"The Great Baja Eclipse", ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' January 1991. p. 90.</ref>

The totality of the [[Solar eclipse of February 26, 1979]] passed only through the states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], and [[North Dakota]]. Many visitors traveled to the [[Pacific Northwest]] to view the eclipse, since it would be the last chance to view a total solar eclipse in the United States for almost four decades.<ref>"Thousands Go West for a Total Solar Eclipse Tomorrow; Data May Aid Energy Research Partial Eclipse for New York Best Types of Film Image of Sun on Screen", ''[[The New York Times]]'' February 25, 1979. p. 26.</ref><ref>"Total Eclipse of the Sun Darkens Skies in Northwest; Total Eclipse Casts Two Minutes of Darkness in West Temperature Falls Sharply Learned of Weather Peculiarities Data on Plasma Sought", ''[[The New York Times]]'' February 27, 1979. p. A1.</ref>

Some American scientists and interested amateurs seeking to experience a total eclipse participated in a four-day [[Atlantic Ocean]] cruise to view the [[Solar eclipse of July 10, 1972]] as it passed near [[Nova Scotia]]. Organizers of the cruise advertised in astronomical journals and in planetarium announcements emphasizing the lack of future U.S. total eclipses until this 2017 event.<ref>"Let There Be Darkness, Please; When Mercury Is at Quadrature, the Social Director Is a Lonely Man For Two Extremely Short Minutes Everyone Gaped Into the Sky", ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 30, 1972. p. XX1</ref>

It will be the first with a path of totality crossing the USA's [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] and [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic coast]] since [[Solar eclipse of June 8, 1918|1918]]. 

The path of this eclipse crosses the upcoming path of the total [[solar eclipse of April 8, 2024]], with the intersection of the two paths being in [[Southern Illinois|southern]] [[Illinois]] in [[Makanda, Illinois|Makanda]] just south of [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]]. A small land area, including the cities of Carbondale, [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]], and [[Paducah, Kentucky]], will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of fewer than seven years.

The [[Solar eclipse of August 12, 2045]] will have a very similar path of totality over the USA, about 250 miles to the southwest, also crossing the USA's [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] and [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic coast]], however duration of totality will last over twice as long.<ref>[http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/SolarEclipsesGoogleEarthGallery.html Google Earth Gallery for Solar and Lunar Eclipses], Xavier M. Jubier, 2011</ref>

An eclipse of comparable length (up to 3 minutes 8 seconds) occurred over the contiguous United States <ref>[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle1951/SE1970Mar07Tgoogle.html Total Solar Eclipse of 1970 Mar 07], Fred Espinak</ref>  on [[Solar eclipse of March 7, 1970|March 7, 1970]] along the southeast US coast, from Florida to Virginia.
