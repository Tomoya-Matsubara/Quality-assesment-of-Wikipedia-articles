Jogaila was the last pagan ruler of [[medieval Lithuania]]. He held the title ''Didysis [[Kunigaik<U+0161>tis]]''.<ref name="Kunigaikstis">Translated as ''[[Grand Duke|grand duke]]'' or ''[[Grand Prince|grand prince]]''. ''Kunigaik<U+0161>tis'' is a cognate of ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and ''king'', and ''didysis'' magnifies it. See Rowell, 65-69, for the nature of ''didysis kunigaik<U+0161>tis'' in practice.</ref> As King of Poland, he pursued a policy of close alliances with Lithuania against the [[Teutonic Order]]. The allied victory at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, followed by the [[First Peace of Toru<U+0144>]], secured the Polish and Lithuanian borders and marked the emergence of the Polish-Lithuanian alliance as a significant force in Europe. The reign of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II Jagie<U+0142><U+0142>o extended Polish frontiers and is often considered the beginning of [[Polish Golden Age|Poland's "Golden Age"]].

== Early life ==
===Lithuania===

Little is known of Jogaila's early life, and even his date of birth is not certain. Previously historians have given his date of birth as 1352, but some recent research suggests a later date<U+2014>about 1362.<ref name="dob1362">See Tadeusz Wasilewski in "Przegl<U+0105>d Wschodni" 1991 r., and Jan T<U+0119>gowski, ''Pierwsze pokolenia Giedyminowicz<U+00F3>w'', Wroc<U+0142>aw&ndash;Pozna<U+0144> 1999, s. 124<U+2013>125</ref> He was a descendant of the [[Gediminid dynasty]] and probably born in [[Vilnius]]. His parents were [[Algirdas]], Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, [[Uliana Alexandrovna of Tver|Uliana]], daughter of [[Alexander I, Grand Prince of Tver|Alexander I]], Grand Prince of [[Tver]]. 

The Lithuania to which Jogaila succeeded in 1377 was a political entity composed of two different nationalities and two political systems: ethnic Lithuania in the north-west and the vast [[Ruthenia]]n territories of former [[Kievan Rus']], comprising lands of modern Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of western Russia.<ref>Stone, 4; In the late fourteenth century, ethnic Lithuanians are unlikely to have numbered more than 300,000, seven times fewer than the Christian Orthodox inhabitants. Lukowski and Zawadzki, 38<U+2013>9; The former Rus'ian principalities [[Polatsk|Polotsk]], [[Vitebsk]], [[Smolensk]], Kiev, [[Volhynia]], [[Podlasie]], and [[Podolia]] retained the local laws and privileges they had enjoyed before coming under Lithuanian supremacy. Every new grand duke of Lithuania confirmed these privileges and promised not to submit the native populations to the Lithuanian court. Dvornik, 342; The Muscovite and Novgorod authors called Lithuanian Rus' territories "The Lithuanian Land". Plokhy, 46</ref> At first, Jogaila<U+2014>like his father, who had besieged Moscow in 1370<ref>Bojt<U+00E1>r, 180.</ref><U+2014>based his rule in the southern and eastern territories of Lithuania, while his uncle, K<U+0119>stutis, the duke of [[Trakai]], continued to rule the north-western region.<ref>Some historians, for example Vanda Sruogien<U+0117>-Sruoga  in [http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_4_04.htm ''Jogaila (1350<U+2013>1434)''] and J.Deveike in ''The Lithuanian Diarchies'', have called this system a diarchy, but S.C.Rowell suggests that the nature of this dual rule "...reflects political expediency; it certainly does not meet the formal definition of diarchy as 'rule by two independent authorities'...those two leaders were not equal: the grand duke in Vilnius was supreme". Rowell, 68.</ref> Jogaila's succession, however, soon placed this system of dual rule under strain.<ref name="Bojtar"/>

At the start of his reign, Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus' lands. In 1377<U+2013>78, for example, his own half-brother, the russified Andrii the Hunchback, prince of [[Polatsk|Polotsk]], manoeuvred to secede to Moscow.<ref name ="Luk">Lukowski and Zawadzki, 33<U+2013>45.</ref> In 1380, Andrii and another brother, Dmytro, sided with [[Dmitri Donskoi|Prince Dmitri]] of Moscow against Jogaila's alliance with the Tatar Khan [[Mamai]].<ref>Plokhy, 46.</ref> Jogaila failed to arrive with his troops in time to support Mamai,<ref name ="Luk">Lukowski and Zawadzki, 33<U+2013>45.</ref> who was defeated by Prince Dmitri at the [[Battle of Kulikovo]], after which the principality of Moscow posed a heightened threat to Lithuania. In the same year, Jogaila began a struggle for supremacy with K<U+0119>stutis.

In the north-west, Lithuania faced constant armed incursions from the monastic state of the [[Teutonic Order]]<U+2014>founded after 1226 to fight and convert the pagan Baltic tribes of [[Prussians]], [[Yotvingians]] and [[Lithuanians]]<U+2014>which had established itself as a centralised regional power. In 1380, Jogaila secretly concluded the [[Treaty of Dovydi<U+0161>k<U+0117>s]] with the Order, in which he agreed to the [[Christianisation of Lithuania]] in return for the Order's backing against K<U+0119>stutis;<ref name="Bojtar"/>  but K<U+0119>stutis discovered the plan, seized Vilnius, overthrew Jogaila, and pronounced himself grand duke in his place.<ref name="Jones">''New Cambridge Medieval History'', 709<U+2013>712.</ref>

[[Image:Wladyslaw-Jagiello.jpg|thumb|left|[[King Jagiello Monument in Central Park|Equestrian statue of Wladyslaw II Jagiello]], [[Central Park]], [[New York]]]]

In 1382, Jogaila raised an army from his father's vassals and confronted K<U+0119>stutis near Trakai. K<U+0119>stutis and his son [[Vytautas]], under a promise of safe conduct from [[Skirgaila]], Jogaila's brother, entered Jogaila's encampment in Vilnius for negotiations but were tricked and imprisoned in the castle of [[Kreva]], where K<U+0119>stutis was found dead, probably murdered, a week later.<ref> "Jogaila murdered the stubborn uncle in a quarrel at the end of 1382." [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9639116424&id=5aoId7nA4bsC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&vq=Jogaila&dq=Wigand+Poland&sig=hRbejRY9-Ay7Gy3_tYc3_CyZzLk#PPA181,M1 Endre Bojt<U+00E1>r, 181.] "Jogaila himself had come to power in 1382 with the murder of his uncle K<U+0119>stutis." Lukowski and Zawadzki, p 34. Vytautas, during his second Prussian refuge of 1390, was recorded as saying: "Jogaila captured our father and killed him; he also killed our mother and imprisoned me". Quoted by [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042008342&id=Nl0_nXQD5i4C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&vq=Jogaila&dq=Wigand+Poland&sig=DoKb27Z8XzT8ZZP3qQnwuL3-pqw Mick<U+016B>nait<U+0117>, 157,] from a Teutonic chancellery document titled ''dis ist witoldes sache wedir jagaln und skirgaln''. But Sruogien<U+0117>-Sruoga calls the murder "mysterious" and notes that there are "several hypotheses" about what really happened. ''[http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_4_04.htm Jogaila (1350<U+2013>1434)''].</ref> Vytautas escaped to the Teutonic fortress of [[Malbork|Marienburg]] and was baptised there under the name Wigand.<ref name="Jones">''New Cambridge Medieval History'', 709<U+2013>712.</ref>

Jogaila conducted further talks with the Order, renewing his promises of Christianisation and granting the Knights an area of [[Samogitia]] up to the [[Dubysa]] river. The Knights, however, pretending to assist both cousins at once, entered Lithuania in summer 1383 and seized most of Samogitia, opening a corridor between Teutonic Prussia and [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Teutonic Livonia]] further north. Having taken arms with the Knights, Vytautas then accepted assurances from Jogaila about his inheritance and joined him in attacking and looting several Prussian castles.<ref name = "Mick">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042008342&id=Nl0_nXQD5i4C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&vq=Jogaila&dq=Wigand+Poland&sig=DoKb27Z8XzT8ZZP3qQnwuL3-pqw Mick<U+016B>nait<U+0117>, 157.]</ref>

===Baptism and marriage===
:''See also: [[Jadwiga of Poland]]''

When the time came for Jogaila to choose a wife, it became clear that he intended to marry a Christian. His Russian mother urged him to marry Sofia, daughter of [[Dmitri Donskoi|Prince Dmitri of Moscow]], who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy.<ref>The historian [[John Meyendorff]] suggests Jogaila may have already been an Orthodox Christian: "In 1377, Olgerd of Lithuania died, leaving the Grand Principality to his son Jagiello, an Orthodox Christian...". ''Byzantium and the Rise of Russia'', 205. Dmitri, however, made it a condition of the marriage that Jogaila "should be baptized in the Orthodox faith and that he should proclaim his Christianity to all men". Document quoted by Dvornik, 221.</ref> That option, however, was unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Order, who regarded Orthodox Christians as schismatics and little better than heathens.<ref name="Jones">''New Cambridge Medieval History'', 709<U+2013>712.</ref><ref name="Bojtar"/>

[[Image:Wie<U+017C>e katedry na wawelu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Wawel Cathedral]]'s towers]]

Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a Catholic and marry the eleven-year-old Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland]].<ref>Jadwiga had actually been crowned [[king of Poland]] (''rex poloni''), because the Polish political system made no provision for a queen regnant. Stone, 8.</ref><ref>The nobles of Malopolska, not without suspicion from the nobles of Wielkopolska, made this offer to Jogaila for many reasons. For example, they were "concerned to neutralize the dangers from Lithuania itself and to secure the fertile territories of Halych-Rus'." Lukowski and Zawadzki, 42. Dvornik suggests that the Polish nobles saw the offer as an "opportunity for increasing their privileges". Dvornik, 129. They also wished to avoid Austrian influence, Jogaila agreeing to "pay off" Jadwiga's previous fianc<U+00E9> Wilhelm von Habsburg. Lukowski and Zawadzki, 37.</ref>
He was also to be legally adopted by Jadwiga's mother, [[Elisabeth of Hungary]], so retaining the throne in the event of Jadwiga's death.<ref name="Jones">''New Cambridge Medieval History'', 709<U+2013>712.</ref> On these and other terms, on [[14 August]] [[1385]] at the castle of Kreva, Jogaila [[Union of Kreva|agreed to]] adopt Christianity, repatriate lands "stolen" from Poland by its neighbours, and ''terras suas Lithuaniae et Russiae Coronae Regni Poloniae perpetuo applicare'', a clause interpreted by historians to mean anything from a personal union between Lithuania and Poland to a prenuptial agreement superseded when the marriage took place.<ref>Lukowski and Zawadzki read the clause to imply  that "The Kreva Act seemingly promised that he would incorporate Lithuania into Poland." Lukowski and Zawadzki, 41. Sruogien<U+0117>-Sruoga points out in [http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_4_04.htm ''Jogaila''] that "Lithuanians probably reasoned that this agreement was only temporary, a kind of wedding formality." The Kr<U+0117>va Union was short-lived and was succeeded by several other agreements between Lithuania and Poland. According to modern historian G. Rhode, and other researchers, the Kr<U+0117>va Union did not annihilate Lithuanian sovereignty, as interpreted by most Polish historians. G.Rhode. ''Grundzuge der Geschichte Litauens'', 141, 1966. Daniel Z. Stone says, "The exact intent of this union has been hotly debated by historians, but it seems likely that Jogaila and the Poles both intended to unite the realms fully". Stone, 8.</ref> The agreement at Kr<U+0117>va has been described both as far-sighted and as a desperate gamble.<ref>It "reflects the exceptional far-sightedness of the political elites ruling both countries." [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521364299&id=ecdye8hk_tgC&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=Wladyslaw+Jagiello&sig=i7WQnkOW8IwppCQatda_KPJa6o0 K<U+0142>oczowski, 55.] It was "a desperate gamble by Jogaila to avert a seemingly inevitable subjugation."

Jogaila was duly baptised at the [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] on [[15 February]] [[1386]] and from then on formally used the name W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw or Latin versions of it.<ref>"...was given the Christian name Vladislovas (Wladyslaw)". Vanda Sruogien<U+0117>-Sruoga, [http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_4_04.htm ''Jogaila'' (1350<U+2013>1434)]. A Slavic name that roughly translates as ''glorious rule'', W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw is often [[Latinisation|Latinised]] into either Wladislaus or Ladislaus.

Before W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's arrival in Krak<U+00F3>w for the wedding, Queen Jadwiga despatched one of her knights, [[Zawisza Ole<U+015B>nicki|Zawisza the Red]], to confirm that her future husband was really a human, as she had heard he was a bear-like creature, cruel and uncivilised.<ref name="Kosman">Kosman, ''Jagie<U+0142><U+0142>o kr<U+00F3>lem Polski: z dziej<U+00F3>w unii Polski i Litwy'', 79.</ref> Despite her misgivings, the marriage went ahead on [[4 March]] [[1386]], two weeks after the baptism ceremonies, and Jogaila was crowned King W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw. In time, the Poles discovered their new ruler to be a civilised monarch with a high regard for Christian culture, as well as a skilled politician and military commander. An athletic man, with small, restless, black eyes and big ears,<ref>Physiognomical details provided by the chronicler [[Jan D<U+0142>ugosz]]. Turnbull, ''Tannenberg 1410: Disaster for the Teutonic Knights'', 23.</ref> W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw dressed modestly and was said to be an unusually clean person, who washed and shaved every day, never touched alcohol, and drank only pure water.<ref name="Kosman"/><ref>"Wherever he traveled, he always carried a razor, scissors, brushes, and an ivory comb. He shaved his beard daily, and to the surprise of all the Poles, he even bathed every day." M.Kuczynski, quoted by Vanda Sruogien<U+0117>-Sruoga, [http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_4_04.htm ''Jogaila'' (1350<U+2013>1434)]</ref> His pleasures included listening to Ruthenian fiddlers and hunting.<ref>And according to mid-fifteenth-century chronicler Jan D<U+0142>ugosz, his pleasures further included the exercise of a prodigious sex drive, "not only in permitted ways but also in forbidden ones". Quoted by Turnbull, ''Tannenberg 1410: Disaster for the Teutonic Knights'', 23.</ref> Some medieval chroniclers attributed such model behaviour to Wladyslaw's conversion.<ref>Stone, 8.</ref>

[[Image:Grobowiec krolowej Jadwigi.jpg||thumb|right|Jadwiga's sarcophagus, [[Wawel Cathedral]]]]

W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw and Jadwiga reigned as co-monarchs; and though Jadwiga probably had little real power, she took an active part in Poland's political and cultural life. In 1387, she led two successful military expeditions to [[Red Ruthenia]], recovered lands  [[Louis I of Hungary|her father]] had transferred from Poland to Hungary, and secured the homage of [[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I, Voivode of Moldavia]].<ref name="Jasienica">[[Pawe<U+0142> Jasienica|Jasienica]], 80<U+2013>146.</ref> In 1390, she also personally opened negotiations with the Teutonic Order. Most political responsibilities, however, fell to W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, with Jadwiga attending to the cultural and charitable activities for which she is still revered.<ref name="Jasienica"/>

Soon after W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's accession to the Polish throne, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw granted [[Vilnius]] a city charter like that of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], modelled on the [[Magdeburg Law]]; and Vytautas issued a privilege to a Jewish commune of [[Trakai]] on almost the same terms as privileges issued to the Jews of Poland in the reigns of [[Boleslaus the Pious]] and [[Casimir the Great]].<ref name="Jasienica-legal">Jasienica, 74<U+2013>80.</ref> W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial and uneven at first but achieved a lasting influence.<ref name="Jasienica"/><ref>By the time of the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, there was not much difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland. Dvornik, 344.</ref> 

One effect of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's measures was to be the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied the Orthodox boyars.<ref>Magocsi, 134.</ref> As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian identity in the fifteenth century.<ref name = "Rus">Serhii Plokhy identifies a "mobilisation of Rus' identity" during the 1430s.

===Challenges===
[[Image:Vytautas the great.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vytautas]]]]

W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's baptism entirely failed to end the crusade of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his conversion was a sham, perhaps even a heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that pagans remained in Lithuania.<ref name="Jones">''New Cambridge Medieval History'', p 709<U+2013>712.</ref><ref name="Housley">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0198221363&id=JQP2F2q9xDkC&pg=RA3-PA354&lpg=RA3-PA354&dq=Raciaz+1404&sig=aFCILlC6gyVKKL9zfezZR4UrLME Housley, 354.]</ref> From now on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain the cause of a crusade and faced the growing threat to its existence posed by a genuinely Christian Lithuania.<ref name="Sedlar">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0295972904&id=ANdbpi1WAIQC&pg=PA388&lpg=PA388&dq=Union+Radom+1401&sig=8kP56Imi0z7Jw6f6wzpIoBY9QgA Sedlar, 388.]</ref><ref name="Turnbull">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1841767123&id=F3wzkSHR4j4C&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&vq=Jagiello&dq=Wigand+of+Marburg&sig=1pW_fe3qpsmGtxU-pVxizK4IiQc Turnbull, ''Crusader Castles of the Teuton Knights (2)'', 22.]</ref>

If anything, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw and Jadwiga's policy of Catholicising Lithuania served to antagonise rather than disarm their Teutonic rivals. They sponsored the creation of the [[Archdiocese of Vilnius|diocese of Vilnius]] under [[bishop of Vilnius|bishop]] [[Andrzej Wasilko]], the former confessor of [[Elisabeth of Hungary]].

This protracted period of war between the Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights was ended on [[12 October]] [[1398]] by the treaty of Sallinwerder, named after the islet in the [[Neman River]] where it was signed. Lithuania agreed to cede Samogitia and assist the Teutonic Order in a campaign to seize [[Pskov]], while the Order agreed to assist Lithuania in a campaign to seize [[Novgorod]].<ref name="Jasienica"/> Shortly afterwards, Vytautas was crowned as a king by local nobles; but the following year his forces and those of his ally, Khan [[Tokhtamysh]] of the [[White Horde]], were crushed by the [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurids]] at the [[Battle of the Vorskla River]], ending his imperial ambitions in the east and obliging him to submit to W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's protection once more.<ref name="Bojtar"/><ref name="Dvornik"/>

== King of Poland ==
On [[22 June]] [[1399]], Jadwiga gave birth to a daughter, baptised El<U+017C>bieta Bonifacja; but within a month both mother and baby were dead from birth complications, leaving the fifty-year-old king sole ruler of Poland and without an heir. Jadwiga's death, and with it the extinction of the [[Angevin]] line, undermined W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's right to the throne; and as a result old conflicts between the nobility of [[Lesser Poland]], generally sympathetic to W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, and the gentry of [[Greater Poland]] began to surface. In 1402, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying [[Anna of Celje]], a granddaughter of [[Casimir III of Poland]], a political match which re-legitimised his monarchy.

The [[Union of Vilnius and Radom]] of 1401 confirmed Vytautas's status as grand duke under W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw rather than those of Vytautas: should W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw die without heirs, the Lithuanian [[boyar]]s were to elect a new monarch.<ref name="Jasienica-103">Pawe<U+0142> Jasienica, 103-105.</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0295980931&id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=Union+Radom+1401&sig=Q4G503PKUiw-3t1zJXrm6nz_Rx8 Stone, 11.]</ref> Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, the act's implications were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent [[defensive alliance]] between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part.<ref name="Sedlar"/><ref name="Dvornik"/> While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw a measure of support in Lithuania.<ref name="Jasienica"/> 

In late 1401, the new war against the Order overstretched the resources of the Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's brothers, the malcontent [[<U+0160>vitrigaila]], chose this moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke.<ref name="Housley">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0198221363&id=JQP2F2q9xDkC&pg=RA3-PA354&lpg=RA3-PA354&dq=Raciaz+1404&sig=aFCILlC6gyVKKL9zfezZR4UrLME Housley, 354.]</ref> On [[31 January]] [[1402]], he presented himself in [[Malbork|Marienburg]], where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.<ref name="Jasienica-103"/>

The war ended in defeat for W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw. On [[22 May]] [[1404]] in the Treaty of Raci<U+0105><U+017C>, he acceded to most of the Order's demands, including the formal cession of Samogitia, and agreed to support the Order's designs on [[Pskov]]; in return, [[Konrad von Jungingen]] undertook to sell Poland the disputed [[Dobrzy<U+0144> Land]] and the town of [[Z<U+0142>otoryja]], once pawned to the Order by [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Opolski]], and to support Vytautas in a revived attempt on [[Novgorod]].<ref name="Jasienica-103"/> Both sides had practical reasons for signing the treaty at that point: the Order needed time to fortify its newly acquired lands, the Poles and Lithuanians to deal with territorial challenges in the east and in [[Silesia]].

Also in 1404, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw held talks at [[Wroc<U+0142>aw|Vratislav]] with [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]], who offered to return Silesia to Poland if W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw would support him in his power struggle within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>The imperial electors had deposed Wenceslaus as [[King of the Romans]] four years earlier.

In December 1408, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw and Vytautas held strategic talks in [[Navahrudak]], where they decided to foment a revolt against Teutonic rule in Samogitia to draw German forces away from [[Pomerelia]]. W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw promised to repay Vytautas for his support by restoring Samogitia to Lithuania in any future peace treaty.<ref name="Zakrzewski">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04173453&id=TfQKAAAAIAAJ&q=Jagiello+1408&dq=Jagiello+1408&pgis=1 Karwasi<U+0144>ska, 21.]</ref> The uprising, which began in May 1409, at first provoked little reaction from the Knights, who had not yet consolidated their rule in Samogitia by building castles; but by June their diplomats were busy lobbying W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's court at [[Oborniki]], warning his nobles against Polish involvement in a war between Lithuania and the Order.<ref name="Jasienica-106">Jasienica, 106<U+2013>107.</ref> W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, however, bypassed his nobles and informed new Grand Master [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] that if the Knights acted to suppress Samogitia, Poland would intervene. This stung the Order into issuing a declaration of war against Poland on [[August 6]], which W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw received on [[August 14]] in [[Nowy Korczyn]].<ref name="Jasienica-106"/> 

The castles guarding the northern border were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at Z<U+0142>otoryja, [[Dobrzy<U+0144>]] and [[Bobrowniki]], the capital of [[Dobrzy<U+0144> Land]], while German burghers invited them into [[Bydgoszcz]] (German: Bromberg). W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw arrived on the scene in late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came to terms with the Order on [[October 8]]. During the winter, the two armies prepared for a major confrontation. W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw installed a strategic supply depot at [[P<U+0142>ock]] in [[Masovia]] and had a [[pontoon bridge]] constructed and transported north down the [[Vistula]].<ref>Turnbull, ''Tannenberg 1410: Disaster for the Teutonic Knights'', 32<U+2013>33.</ref>

Meanwhile, both sides unleashed diplomatic offensives. The Knights despatched letters to the monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens;<ref>French chronicler [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]'s perspective on the conflict reveals how ingrained was the crusading view of events: "The King of Poland, who was a great enemy of the Grand Master of Prussia and had just recently pretended to become a Christian in order to win the Polish crown, came with his Poles to the aid of the Saracens".

===Battle of Grunwald===
[[Image:Grunwald bitwa.jpg|thumb|250px|right|thumb|[[Battle of Grunwald]], 1410. Painting by Jan Matejko]]

When the war resumed in June 1410, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw advanced into the Teutonic heartland at the head of an army of about 20,000 mounted nobles, 15,000 armed commoners, and 2,000 professional cavalry mainly hired from Bohemia. After crossing the Vistula over the pontoon bridge at [[Czerwi<U+0144>sk]], his troops met up with those of [[Vytautas]], whose 11,000 light cavalry included Ruthenians and [[Tatars]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0295980931&id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o+Malbork&sig=LfV8OrikMBYKUA53cZ3Uwya5Rf4#PPA16,M1 Stone, 16.]</ref> The Teutonic Order's army numbered about 18,000 cavalry, mostly Germans and 5,000 infantry.

Thousands of troops were reported to have been slaughtered on either side.<ref>Stone, 16.</ref>

[[Image:Malbork zamek zblizenie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Teutonic Order's castle at Marienburg]]

The road to the Teutonic capital [[Marienburg]] now lay open, the city undefended; but for reasons the sources do not explain, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw hesitated to pursue his advantage.<ref>"There can be few other examples in history of a battle so decisively won and a subsequent campaign that so singularly failed to achieve its aims." From the introduction to Stephen Turnbull's ''Tannenberg 1410: Disaster for the Teutonic Knights'', 7.</ref> On July 17, his army began a laboured advance, arriving at Marienburg only on July 25, by which time the new Grand Master, [[Heinrich von Plauen]], had organised a defence of the fortress.<ref name="Stone-17">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0295980931&id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o+Malbork&sig=LfV8OrikMBYKUA53cZ3Uwya5Rf4 Stone, 17.]</ref><ref>What we know about this delay, as Stephen Turnbull describes, is that with Marienburg less than sixty miles away, the Polish-Lithuanian army, perhaps due to casualties, waited for two days before marching on, and then only at a rate of nine miles (14 km) a day. The delay, which Turnbull calls "perhaps understandable but fatal", allowed Heinrich von Plauen to reach Marienburg with around 2000 (some sources say 3000 men), evacuate the town, and dig in for a long siege. Turnbull, ''Tannenberg 1410: Disaster for the Teutonic Knights'', 73.</ref> The apparent half-heartedness of the ensuing siege, called off by W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw on September 19, has been ascribed variously to the impregnability of the fortifications, to high casualty figures among the Lithuanians, and to W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's unwillingness to risk further casualties; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation. [[Pawe<U+0142> Jasienica]], in his monumental ''Polska Jagiellon<U+00F3>w'' (''Poland of the Jagiellons'') suggests W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, as a Lithuanian, might have wished to preserve the equilibrium between Lithuania and Poland, the Lithuanians having suffered particularly heavy casualties in the battle.<ref>Jasienica, 113<U+2013>120</ref> Other historians point out that W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw might have assumed Marienburg was impregnable and therefore seen no advantage in a lengthy siege with no guarantee of success.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0295980931&id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o+Malbork&sig=LfV8OrikMBYKUA53cZ3Uwya5Rf4 Stone, 17.]</ref>

==Final years==
===Dissent===
[[Image:Polish and Lithuanian Conflict with Prussia. 1377-1435..png|thumb| right|Polish and Lithuanian conflict with Teutonic Prussia, 1377<U+2013>1434.]]

The war ended in 1411 with the [[Peace of Toru<U+0144> (1411)|Peace of Toru<U+0144>]], in which neither Poland nor Lithuania drove home their negotiating advantage to the full, much to the discontent of the Polish nobles. Poland regained [[Dobrzy<U+0144> Land]], Lithuania regained Samogitia, and Masovia regained a small territory beyond the [[Wkra]] river. Most of the Teutonic Order's territory, however, including towns which had surrendered, remained intact. W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw then proceeded to release many high-ranking Teutonic Knights and officials for apparently modest ransoms.<ref>The cumulative expense of the ransoms, however, proved a drain on the Order's resources. "The defeat at Grunwald cost the Order vast sums in ransom money." ''New Cambridge Medieval History'', 364. The Order never recovered its strength after Grunwald: in an effort to meet their expenses, the Knights introduced riot-provoking taxes and debased their currency, but by 1419, 20% of Order land had been deserted<U+2014>in southern Pomerelia, more than 50% of landholdings lay abandoned and in the Schwetz ([[<U+015A>wiecie]]). [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0295980931&id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o+Malbork&sig=LfV8OrikMBYKUA53cZ3Uwya5Rf4 Stone, 17.]</ref> This failure to exploit the victory to his nobles' satisfaction provoked growing opposition to W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's regime after Toru<U+0144>, further fuelled by the granting of [[Podolia]], disputed between Poland and Lithuania, to Vytautas, and by the king's two-year absence in Lithuania.<ref name="Jasienica-121">Jasienica, 121<U+2013>124.</ref> 

A lingering Polish distrust of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, who never became fluent in Polish, was expressed later in the century by the chronicler and historian [[Jan D<U+0142>ugosz]]:

{{cquote|He loved his country Lithuania and his family and brothers so much that without hesitation he brought to the Polish kingdom all kinds of wars and troubles. The crown's riches and all it carried he donated towards the enrichment and protection of Lithuania.<ref>D<U+0142>ugosz also delivered the following verdict on W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw: "He was so far removed from the bloodshed that he forgave even the chief offenders, and to the conquered he was always merciful... His unsensible generosity harmed the country more than did those who were stingy and greedy for wealth". Vanda Sruogien<U+0117>-Sruoga, [http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_4_04.htm ''Jogaila'' (1350<U+2013>1434)] </ref>}}

In an effort to outflank his critics, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw promoted the leader of the opposing faction, bishop [[Miko<U+0142>aj Tr<U+0105>ba]], to the archbishopric of [[Gniezno]] in autumn 1411 and replaced him in Krak<U+00F3>w with [[Wojciech Jastrz<U+0119>biec]], a supporter of Vytautas.<ref name="Jasienica-121"/> He also sought to create more allies in Lithuania. In 1413, in the [[Union of Horod<U+0142>o]], signed on [[October 2]], he decreed that the status of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was "tied to our Kingdom of Poland permanently and irreversibly" and granted the Catholic nobles of Lithuania privileges equal to those of the Polish [[szlachta]]. The act included a clause prohibiting the Polish nobles from electing a monarch without the consent of the Lithuanian nobles, and the Lithuanian nobles from electing a grand duke without the consent of the Polish monarch.<ref>Stone, 11; Dvornik, 342<U+2013>3; ''New Cambridge Medieval History'', 775<U+2013>6.</ref>

===Last conflicts=== 
In 1414, a sporadic new war broke out, known as the "[[Hunger War]]" from the Knights' [[scorched earth|scorched-earth]] tactics of burning fields and mills; but both the Knights and the Lithuanians were too exhausted from the previous war to risk a major battle, and the fighting petered out in the autumn.<ref name="Jasienica-121"/> Hostilities did not flare up again until 1419, during the [[Council of Constance]], when they were called off at the papal legate's insistence.<ref name="Jasienica-121"/>

The Council of Constance proved a turning point in the Teutonic crusades, as it did for several European conflicts. Vytautas sent a delegation in 1415, including the metropolitan of Kiev; and Samogitian witnesses arrived at Constance at the end of that year to point out their preference for being "baptised with water and not with blood".<ref>Housley, 361; ''New Cambridge Medieval History'', 733.</ref> The Polish envoys, among them [[Miko<U+0142>aj Tr<U+0105>ba]], [[Zawisza Czarny]], and [[Pawe<U+0142> W<U+0142>odkowic]], lobbied for an end to the forced conversion of heathens and to the Order's aggression against Lithuania and Poland.<ref>[[Pawel Wlodkowic]]'s ''Tractatus de potestate papae et imperatoris respectu infidelium'' (''Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor Over the Infidels'') condemned the Teutonic Order for its wars of conquest and the extermination of native non-Christian peoples in Prussia and Lithuania, likened W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw to the apostles for the Christianisation of Lithuania, and proposed that pagan and Christian nations live together in peace. K<U+0142>oczowski, 73.</ref> As a result of the Polish-Lithuanian diplomacy, the council, though scandalised by W<U+0142>odkowic's questioning of the monastic state's legitimacy, denied the Order's request for a further crusade and instead entrusted the conversion of the Samogitians to Poland-Lithuania.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0198221363&id=JQP2F2q9xDkC&pg=RA3-PA354&lpg=RA3-PA354&dq=Raciaz+1404&sig=aFCILlC6gyVKKL9zfezZR4UrLME Housley, 351<U+2013>361.]</ref>

The diplomatic context at Constance included the revolt of the Bohemian [[Hussite]]s, who looked upon Poland as an ally in their wars against [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw on condition he accept the religious principles of the [[Four Articles of Prague]], which he was not prepared to do.<ref>After W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's nephew, [[Sigismund Korybut]], attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success. Bideleux, 233<U+2013>235; Turnbull, ''The Hussite Wars'', 11<U+2013>12. Vytautas accepted Sigismund's offer of a royal crown in 1429<U+2014>apparently with W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's blessing<U+2014>but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled. Stone, 11; ''New Cambridge Medieval History'', 353.</ref>

In 1422, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw fought another war, known as the [[Gollub War]], against the Teutonic Order, defeating them in under two months before the Order's imperial reinforcements had time to arrive. The resulting [[Treaty of Lake Melno]] ended the Knights' claims to Samogitia once and for all and defined a permanent border between Prussia and Lithuania.<ref>Lithuania was given the province of Samogitia, with the port of [[Palanga]], but the city of [[Klaip<U+0117>da]] was left to the Order.

Further [[Polish-Teutonic War (1431-1435)|sporadic warfare]] broke out between Poland and the Knights between 1431 and 1435.

Cracks in the cooperation between Poland and Lithuania after the death of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw supported his brother [[<U+0160>vitrigaila]] as grand duke of Lithuania,<ref name = "Sru">Sruogien<U+0117>-Sruoga, [http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_4_04.htm ''Jogaila'' (1350<U+2013>1434)]</ref> but when <U+0160>vitrigaila, with the support of the Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles,<ref name = "Rus">Serhii Plokhy identifies a "mobilisation of Rus' identity" during the 1430s. Plokhy, 98.</ref> rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop [[Zbigniew Ole<U+015B>nicki]] of Krak<U+00F3>w, occupied [[Podolia]], which W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and [[Volhynia]].<ref>Stone, 11. How much influence the aged W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw had on these events is not clear. Sruogien<U+0117>-Sruoga says that he wished to restore Lithuanian independence and at one point instructed the leader of the Lithuanian army not to listen to Polish orders. Plokhy, on the other hand, says that he sided with the Poles over Podolia. Plokhy, 98.</ref> In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas's brother [[Sigismund Kestutaitis|<U+017D>ygimantas]] as grand duke,<ref name = "Sru">Sruogien<U+0117>-Sruoga, [http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_4_04.htm ''Jogaila'' (1350<U+2013>1434)]</ref> leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's death.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0295980931&id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=Union+Radom+1401&sig=Q4G503PKUiw-3t1zJXrm6nz_Rx8 Stone, 11.]; Plokhy, 98.</ref>

=== Succession ===
[[Image:WJagie<U+0142><U+0142>o.JPG|thumb| Tomb effigy of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II Jagie<U+0142><U+0142>o, [[Wawel Cathedral]]]]

W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's second wife, Anna of Celje, had died in 1416, leaving a daughter, [[Jadwiga of Lithuania|Jadwiga]]. In 1417, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw married [[Elisabeth of Pilica]], who died in 1420 without bearing him a child, and two years later, [[Sophia of Halshany]], who bore him two surviving sons. The death in 1431 of Princess Jadwiga, the last heir of Piast blood, released W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw to make his sons by Sophia of Halshany his heirs, though he had to sweeten the Polish nobles with concessions to ensure their agreement, since the monarchy was elective. W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw finally died in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, [[Wladyslaw III of Poland|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw III]], and Lithuania to his younger, [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir]], both still minors at the time.<ref>Sedlar, 282; New Cambridge Medieval History, 711. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken for granted. "Jagiello's death in 1434 ended the personal union between the two realms, and it was not clear what would take its place." Stone, 22.</ref>
