'''New York State Route 990V''' (officially '''New York State Reference Route 990V''') is a [[reference route (New York)|reference route]] in [[Schoharie County, New York]]. It is one of only four reference routes that has been marked as a touring route in [[New York State]]. The route is an east-west running highway, spanning a distance of roughly six miles between its western terminus at [[New York State Route 30|NY 30]] in [[Gilboa, New York|Gilboa]] and its eastern terminus at County Route 3 in [[Conesville, New York|Conesville]]. Route 990V was once part of [[New York State 342 (1930s)|New York State Route 342]] until being decommissioned for a routing in Jefferson County (over former NY 181). 

==Route description==
[[Image:990v.jpg|left|thumb|The western terminus of NY 990V at NY 30 in Gilboa.]]
NY 990V begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 30|NY 30]] in the town of [[Gilboa, New York|Gilboa]] northwest of the [[Schoharie Reservoir]]. The route heads south-east around the reservoir to the hamlet of Gilboa, where it crosses [[Schoharie Creek]] a short distance downstream from the [[Gilboa Dam]]. Outside of Gilboa, NY 990V turns to the southeast and parallels the eastern edge of the reservoir into the town of [[Conesville, New York|Conesville]]. The route remains the primary waterside roadway up to the hamlet of West Conesville, where NY 990V splits from the roadway and enters the [[Manor Kill Creek]] valley. The road continues eastward through West Conesville to the hamlet of Conesville, where it becomes County Route 3 at an intersection with Champlin Road and Bear Kill Road (CR 18) near the confluence of Manor Kill Creek and the [[Bear Kill River]].<ref name="google">{{cite map|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from%3A%20RT-990V%20%4042.391287%2C%20-74.460270%20to%3A%20RT-990V%20%4042.386926%2C%20-74.376266&um=1&sa=N&tab=wl|title=Overview map of NY 990V|accessdate=2008-05-11|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|cartography=[[NAVTEQ]]}}</ref>

The presence of touring route signage is unusual among [[reference route (New York)|reference route]]s. While most reference routes lack signage since they are considered too small or are known by other names or numbers, NY 990V is signed as a touring route, as are [[New York State Route 961F|NY 961F]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gribblenation.net/nyroutes/images/photos/routes/961f/961f-00590e.jpg|title=Image of NY 961F at NY 70 |accessdate=2008-09-14 |work=Mark Sinsabaugh |publisher=Mark Sinsabaugh |date=2006 }}</ref>, [[New York State Route 962J|NY 962J]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alpsroads.net/roads/ny/ny_434/e962j.jpg|title=Night image of signs along NY 962J|accessdate=2008-09-14 |work=Steve Alpert |publisher=Alps' Roads |date=2006 }}</ref> and [[New York State Route 990L|NY 990L]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gribblenation.net/nyroutes/images/photos/routes/990l/990l-01.jpg|title=Image of a crude NY 990L shield|accessdate=2008-09-14 |work=Mark Sinsabaugh |publisher=Mark Sinsabaugh |date=2007}}</ref>, all reference routes. In fact, 990V is well-signed, and apparently is considered a minor touring route.<ref name="signage">{{cite web |url=http://www.gribblenation.net/nyroutes/images/photos/routes/990v/990v-01.jpg |title=Image of NY 990V at Champlain Road |accessdate=2008-09-14 |work=Adam Prince |publisher=Mark Sinsabaugh |date=2006-10-06 }}</ref>

==History==
What is now NY 990V was originally designated as '''New York State Route 342''' in the 1930s. NY 342 also continued east to [[New York State Route 145|NY 145]] in [[Durham, New York|Durham]] by way of Schoharie County Route 3, Durham Road, and Greene County Route 20.<ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1938/39 edition, (W.A. Thibodeau, 1938).</ref> By 1947, the route was shifted westward to begin at [[New York State Route 23|NY 23]] at South Gilboa Station and end at the modern junction of CR 3 and Durham Road in Manorkill.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/250k/txu-pclmaps-topo-us-binghamton-1948.jpg|title=Binghamton, NY Quadrangle|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=1948|scale=1:250,000|series=Eastern United States 1:250,000|accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref>

By 1970, NY 342 was reassigned to the stretch of former [[New York State Route 181|NY 181]] between [[Pamelia, New York|Pamelia]] and [[Fort Drum, New York|Fort Drum]] in [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greaternyroads.info/pdfs/state70.pdf|title=Official Description of Touring Routes in New York State|date=[[1970-01-01]]|author=[[State of New York Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref> giving way to a [[reference route (New York)|reference route]] (990V), as is often the case whenever a state route is removed or reassigned. The unique property of this "replacement route" is that, contrary to standard procedure, the reference route was signed as a typical touring route.<ref name="signage"/>
