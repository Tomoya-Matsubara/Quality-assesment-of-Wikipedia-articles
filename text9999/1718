==College career==
===Freshman season (2012<U+2013>2013)===
As a freshman, Hanlan started all 33 games.  He arrived with most of the players being either freshman or sophomores.  During Hanlan's freshman season, he scored 15.4 points per game and led his team to the quarterfinals in the 2013 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament.  Hanlan's first breakout game as a freshman was on November 21, 2012 vs. [[2012<U+2013>13 Auburn Tigers men's basketball team|Auburn]] when he had 19 points and made the game-winning shot in a 50-49 victory for the Eagles.  After that game, Hanlan was very consistent including having 17 vs. [[2012<U+2013>13 Miami Hurricanes men's basketball team|Miami]], 22 vs. [[2012<U+2013>13 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|UNC]], and 20 vs. [[2012<U+2013>13 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]].  However, he did miss a free throw vs. Miami (FL) that would have sent the game into overtime, and missed a shot that would have won the game vs. Duke.  From mid-February until the end of the season, Hanlan scored 12+ points every game.  His second breakout game was on February 19, 2013 vs. [[2012<U+2013>13 Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team|Maryland]] when he scored a career high 26 points in a 69-58 win for the Eagles.  Hanlan then set an ACC Basketball Tournament freshman record for scoring with 41 points against Georgia Tech on March 14, 2013.  The Eagles won 84-64.  Hanlan went on to win [[Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Rookie of the Year|ACC rookie of the year]].<ref name="bio" />
