==Plot==
10-year-old Arthur is living with his grandmother in a quiet country house. He has recently lost his grandfather, and sees little of his parents. His grandmother entertains him by reading stories to him. One of these stories is about the friendship of the tall bogomatassalai and the Minimoys <U+2014> tiny [[elf]]in beings living underground in the [[garden]] of his grandparents' house. According to these stories, the Minimoys hold a wondrous and expensive treasure of rubies given by the bogomatassalai to Arthur's grandfather in gratitude for his help. Arthur has become enamoured with a picture of Selenia, princess of the Minimoys. 

Arthur's grandmother has been given a two-day deadline to pay a large sum of money to a building developer named Davido, who has bought up her mortgage from the bank and plans to evict the two. Arthur takes it upon himself to find the rubies in order to pay off the debt. After stumbling across various clues written a few years previously by his grandfather, Arthur manages to find the key to the Minimoys' world. He is met in the garden by  the "bogomatassalai", tall men resembling [[Maasai]] tribals, who tell Arthur how to get into the Minimoys' world by way of shrinking down to their size. This is done by means of a [[telescope]] and the power of a shining [[full moon]]. When Arthur is underground with the Minimoys, he learns of a danger to the little people's future <U+2014> the plans of Malthazar, the leader of an [[army]] of [[mosquito]]-riding rebels named Seides living in nearby "Necropolis", who plan to conquer the Minimoys by flooding their city. Malthazar was once a Minimoy himself; a war hero corrupted by a seductive [[weevil]], by whom he has a son called Darkos. After his corruption, Malthazar became a [[warlord]] known as the "Evil M" (people fear his true name will bring bad luck). Arthur's grandfather is his prisoner, and the rubies form his [[throne]].

Arthur, in a moment reflecting his legendary British namesake, draws a sacred [[sword]] from its recess, which he then uses to protect his new friends from Malthazar's soldiers. The [[Monarch|king]] gives permission for Arthur to travel to Necropolis, sending with him the princess Selenia as well as her younger brother. Armed with Arthur's new sword <U+2013>  the use of which they share <U+2013> the trio embark. ''En route'' to Necropolis, they are numerous times put in danger by Malthazar's soldiers, who are making plans for the coming [[flood]]. During their travel Selenia explains Arthur that she is going to be 1000 years old in two days, so she would succeed her father until her own children get 1000 years old, so she has two days to find a husband, Arthur gets sad because of the age difference, until he learns they count years differently and really they are about the same age. (Betameche explains Minimoys are considered adults at 360 years old).   Eventually, the questors arrive in Necropolis, but where the stubbornly independent Selenia takes the sword, and kisses Arthur, which as the first kiss of a princess, transfers her powers to Arthur, seals  their wedding and makes Arthur the future king. Then Selenia confronts Malthazar alone. Malthazar wishes the first kiss of the princess to restore his original beauty, but after learning she has already kissed Arthur and she can no longer give him her powers, he decides to kill her; she, is captured and incarcerated, and put in a cell where she founds her companions are already captured. (The kiss scene was cut in the U.S. version, and the order of the scenes was changed)

While in prison, they find Arthur's grandfather Archibald, who like his grandson after him has become a Minimoy. This transformation has altered the proportions of his body, giving him a larger head, thinner limbs, long ears, and broad extremities. He has been teaching all his knowledge to Malthazard in exchange of food. Selenia feels defeated, but Arthur comforts her.

Malthazar lets then escape, just 3 minutes ahead of the flood, so he would make them suffer, but they could out run it using as their vehicle a clockwork car that Arthur, in his human form, recently possessed. 

During the adventure, Arthur's infatuation of Selenia has been supplemented by comradeship, as well as by her own affection for him. While Arthur learns that custom says that newlyweds should not kiss again for at least ten moons, the princess Selenia decides she does not wish to wait and gives Arthur a long passionate kiss, before he returns to his human form. Now he still has an hour to save the Minimoys form the flood

After return to his own world, with the help of a royal advisor's long-lost son, Miro, Arthur is able to prevent the flood from destroying the Minimoys, redirecting it to Necropolis instead. Malthazar abandons the plan, as well as his army and his son, and flees. 

They pay Davido with one ruby, but then he tries to steal all, Davido explains he wanted the farm because the ruby, since he once heard Arthur<U+00B4>s grandpa speaking of them. But the bogomatassalai capture him, and give him to the authorities (scene cut in the us edition).

The story closes with their vows, spoken by Arthur in his human form to Selenia, who sits in a tree, to wait patiently until the time is right for them to be together.

The ending credits then proceed, alongside scenes of every significant character (as well as the director, Luc Besson) appearing in Minimoy form to take a bow.

==Reception==
The film was budgeted at US$86 million.<ref name="mojo">[http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=arthurandtheinvisibles.htm BoxOfficeMojo.com: ''Arthur and the Invisibles'']</ref> By [[Boxing Day]], ''Arthur'' earned over US$20 million in France alone.<ref name="mojo" />. While in general, it was well received by the international public and critic, it failed in the US.

In the [[United States]], the movie's Los Angeles run garnered 20% positive reviews at the critics-aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes|RottenTomatoes.com]].<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/arthur_and_the_invisibles/ RottenTomatoes.com: ''Arthur and the Invisibles'']</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reviewer [[Alex Chun]] wrote that, "Director Luc Besson admits he knew nothing about animation before he started this project, and it shows".<ref>[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-arthur29dec29,0,238109 ''Los Angeles Times'' (Dec. 29, 2006): "'Arthur and the Invisibles': A film with no shortage of well-known talent makes an awkward transition from live action to animation"]</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s [[Robert Koehler (writer)|Robert Koehler]] called it "alienating and dislikable" and specifically noted that, "Having [[African-American]] [[thesp]]s [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Anthony Anderson]] voice creatures that are basically humanoid monkeys shows poor taste".<ref>[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932356.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 ''Variety'' (Dec. 21, 2006): ''Arthur and the Invisibles'' (review by Robert Koehler)]</ref> Many found it derivative of sources ranging from [[King Arthur]]'s sword-in-the-stone to the films ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' and ''[[The Ant Bully]]'', which itself was based on a children's book written three years before Besson's. "It all simply looks as if [conceptual artist Patrice] Garcia and Besson couldn't decide on any one thing to copy", said [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'', "so they copied them all".<ref>[http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003526516'' ''Film Journal International'' (posted online Dec. 29, 2006): ''Arthur and the Invisibles'' (review by Frank Lovece)]</ref> Lovece also noted that, "the whole thing gets seriously creepy when [the animated versions of] the grown-up, pinup-beauty princess and the 10-year-old boy fall for each other. [[Mary Kay Letourneau]] comes uncomfortably to mind".

Besson, in a May 2007 interview. blamed American distributor [[The Weinstein Company]] for the film's poor critical reception in the U.S., saying "Why the critics didn't like ''Arthur'' was because [Weinstein] changed so much of the film and tried to pretend the film was American. ... This was the only country where the film was changed. The rest of the world has the same film as France".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Luc+Besson+and+Rie+Rasmussen/|title=Luc Besson and Rie Rasmussen|accessdate=2007-05-27|last=Epstein|first=Daniel Robert|date=[[2007-05-18]]|publisher=[[SuicideGirls]]}}</ref>

==Awards==
On February 1, 2007, the film received the Imagina Award in the category Prix du Long-M<U+00E9>trage.<ref>[http://www.imagina.mc/ Imagina]</ref> 

== Production notes==
The animation was done by the French company [BUF Compagnie], which hired approximately 100 animators, most of them from French animation schools and without any previous experience. Besson wanted a [[photorealistic]] environment, and BUF initially used microlenses to film physical environments, but eventually instead used [[photogrammetry]], where a digitized photograph of a real object is manipulated with a computer. Sets were built to 1:3 scale, which allowed the animators to use natural elements, such plants and  grass. While the film did not use [[motion capture]], real actors were, however, used as reference, and recorded with 13 to 14 [[video cameras]], but without the markers used in motion capture. Besson directed their performances. In terms of [[lip sync]] with actors' dialog, the French animators could not cope with the English [[phonemes]]. For [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]] and [[David Bowie]], a camera was used to record their lips to help the animators. The animation was done with proprietary software.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
*'''Arthur''': The main protagonist. 10-year-old Arthur largely lives with his grandmother because his parents have little time to spend with him; a fact Arthur resents. His grandfather has mysteriously vanished. Arthur is determined to find him and the treasure of the Minimoys so that he can pay off the unscrupulous debt-collectors who covet his grandmother's land. Arthur, judging by his aptitude for finding clues and thwarting his enemies, has inherited his grandfather's intelligence. 

*'''[[Sel<U+00E9>nia|Princess Selenia]]''': The daughter of the King of the Minimoys; the proud and headstrong Princess Selenia, despite appearing haughty and arrogant, is an honourable and caring individual who is determined to protect her people from the evil of Malthazar. She has a somewhat antagonistic relationship with Arthur at first (believing him to be her inferior). However, after he draws the Sword of the Minimoys from the Stone, she comes to respect him. During their journey they fall in love. Selenia is a formidable fighter and possesses great intelligence. 

*'''Betameche''': Selenia's younger brother. Betameche is 300 years old, which is quite young for a Minimoy. He is a mischievous youth who enjoys teasing his extremely egotistical elder sister. 

*'''[[Malthazar|Malthazard]]''': The [[arch-villain]], Malthazard, also known as '''Malthazard the Evil''' or '''Malthazard the Cursed''' is the corrupt emperor of the Forbidden City of Necropolis. With his army of minions, the Sades, he is determined to conquer the land of the Minimoys and claim the Princess Selenia as his queen. He possesses the treasure of the Minimoys and keeps it in his stronghold in Necropolis, where it forms his throne. Malthazar was once a noble warrior, but because of his [[pride]] and [[lust]] for [[power]], he turned to the path of [[evil]] and betrayed his own people. Although the film refers to him as Malthazard, his name in the book was [[Malthazar]] and some film versions refer to him as Maltazard. He was corrupted to the path of evil by a beautiful but [[seduction|seductive]] [[weevil]] and by her he is a father to a boyish bully named Darkos.

==Other characters==
*'''Grandma''': Arthur's long suffering grandmother is a major character in the film and book. She possesses a dry sense of wit and is very protective of Arthur given the fact that his parents aren't there most of the time on account of trying desperately to get new jobs in the wake of the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash]]. Her husband, Archibald mysteriously disappeared a few years ago in search of the treasure of the Minimoys. 

*'''Archibald''': Arthur's grandfather, he mysteriously disappeared years ago during his quest for the Treasure of the Minimoys. The legal courts have declared him legally dead, but he is actually alive in the dungeons of Necropolis. He is a brilliant explorer and adventurer; traits evidently imitated or inherited by his grandson, Arthur. He teaches the Sades novelties in return for food during his incarceration in Malthazar's dungeons. He is known to the Minimoys as Archibald the Benevolent. 

*'''Ernest Davido''': A greedy and sinister landowner who presides over the multi-national Davido Corporation, which specializes in property development. Davido is determined to evict Arthur and his grandmother from their land so that he can demolish their home and build flats in their vacated land. He also hopes to obtain the rubies called the Treasure of the Minimoys, of which Archibald had told him during a moment of inebriation. Davido appears [[emotional immaturity|emotionally immature]].

* '''Darkos''': Malthazar's vicious but dim-witted son, Darkos is the only survivor of seven children whom Malthazar sired through a union with a weevil. Malthazar takes advantage of his son's loyalty by bidding him remain behind when the flood enters Necropolis.

*'''The King''': The King of the Minimoys is the father of Betameche and Selenia, as well as a benevolent and kind ruler. He is balky when faced by violence, although possessive of his children. He rides atop a large, furry animal called a Gamoul, so as to compensate for his diminutive size.

==DVD==
The US edtion DVD was released on [[May 15]], [[2007]] with just the English-language version and cut down about 10 minutes from the original French version. The international DVD versions include the uncut English-language version and the local-language version.

==Trivia==
* Since this movie takes place in 1960, one anachronism is the [[The Bee-Gees]] song "[[Stayin' Alive]]" (1977) coming from the [[phonograph]].

* When Darkos first appears in the Stunning Rapids Bar, the visible words behind his head spell out "Stupid".

==Sequel==
Besson announced in 2007 that he is directing two sequels, ''Arthur et la Vengeance de Maltazard'' (''Arthur and the Vengeance of Maltazard''), planned for 2009, and ''Arthur et la Guerra des Deux Mondes'' (''Arthur and the War of Two Worlds''), planned for 2010. <ref>[http://www.scifi-universe.com/fiche_actu.asp?id=4878 SciFi-Universe.com (Jan. 6, 2007): "''Arthur et Les Minimoys'' de Retour"], citing ''Film Francais'' article (in French)</ref> <ref>[http://www.luc-besson.com/ Luc Besson official site] (in French)</ref> .
