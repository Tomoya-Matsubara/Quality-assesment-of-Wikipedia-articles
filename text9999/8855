'''Martin G<U+00E9>linas''' ({{IPA-fr|<U+0292>eli<U+02C8>na}}; born June 5, 1970) is a Canadian former [[ice hockey]] forward who played [[List of NHL players with 1000 games played|1,273 games]] in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Quebec Nordiques]], [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Carolina Hurricanes]], [[Calgary Flames]], [[Florida Panthers]] and [[Nashville Predators]].  A first round selection of the [[Los Angeles Kings]], 7th overall, at the [[1988 NHL Entry Draft]], G<U+00E9>linas never played for the team as he was included in one of the most significant trades in NHL history while he was still playing [[junior hockey]] for the [[Gatineau Olympiques|Hull Olympiques]].  He was sent to the Oilers as a part of the [[Wayne Gretzky]] trade in 1988.

G<U+00E9>linas reached the [[Stanley Cup]] finals with four teams. He was a member of Edmonton's [[1990 Stanley Cup Final|1990]] championship team and also reached the final in [[1994 Stanley Cup Final|1994]] with Vancouver, [[2002 Stanley Cup Final|2002]] with Carolina and [[2004 Stanley Cup Final|2004]] with Calgary. He tied a record in the 2004 by scoring three series-winning goals in one playoff year.  After playing his final professional season with [[SC Bern]] in the Swiss [[National League A]] (NLA), G<U+00E9>linas turned to coaching and plater development.  He is currently an assistant coach with the Calgary Flames
