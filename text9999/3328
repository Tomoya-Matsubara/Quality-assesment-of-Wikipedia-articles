'''Ante Markovi<U+0107>''' (born [[November 25]], [[1924]] in [[Konjic]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (now [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]])) was the last [[prime minister]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. He is a Bosnian [[Croat]].

He graduated from the Electrotechnical Department of the Technical Faculty of the [[University of Zagreb]] in [[1954]].<ref name=golden_plaque>{{cite web|author=Kristijan Zimmer|title=Dodijeljene Zlatne diplome i priznanja "Josip Lon<U+010D>ar"|year=2004|url=http://www.fer.hr/zivot/proslave?@=1g9}}</ref>

In 1986. he became president of the Presidency of Socialist Republic of Croatia (thus becoming 7th Croatian president) replacing Ema Derosi-Bjelajac. He held that position until 1988. when he was replaced by Ivo Latin.

He became prime minister in March of [[1989]] following the resignation of [[Branko Mikuli<U+0107>]]. At the end of the year, Markovi<U+0107> launched a new and ambitious program of unprecedented economic reforms, including stabilization of [[currency]] and [[privatization]] by giving employees company shares. The result of his monetary reform was a halt to inflation, which had plagued Yugoslavia in previous decades, and a short-lived but spectacular rise in the standard of living. This made Markovi<U+0107> one of the most popular politicians in Yugoslav history.

Markovi<U+0107> owed his popularity to the image of new, modern Western-style politician who doesn't shy away from applying make-up before television appearances or starring in television commercials. As such, he quickly became the darling of liberal circles who wanted Yugoslavia to be transformed into modern, democratic federation. Markovi<U+0107> also maintained popularity by staying out of increasingly virulent quarrels within the leadership of [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist Party]] or trying to act as mediator between various republics.

When CPY broke up in January [[1990]], Markovi<U+0107> had only his popularity and apparent success of his programme on his side. In July 1990, he formed the [[Union of Reform Forces]] (''Savez reformskih snaga''), a political party supporting reformed Yugoslavian federation. According to a poll conducted by the Federal Executive Council (SIV), this party had support of 14% of people in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], and less than 5% in other republics<ref name=SRS>http://www.danas.co.yu/20030912/feljton1.html</ref>.

Later, his programme was sabotaged by [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] and Serbian government, and the authority of federal government was diminished by secessionist moves in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]]. Last months of his tenure Markovi<U+0107> tried to find compromise between secessionists and those demanding that Yugoslavia remains as single entity. His efforts, although favoured by new democratic governments in Bosnia and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], ultimately failed, because [[Yugoslav People's Army|army]] - which was supposed to be his greatest ally - sided with Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> and Serb nationalists. 

In 1991, the [[USA]] cut off all financial aid to Yugoslavia until all 6 republics held free elections (''1991 Foreign Operations Appropriations Law 101-513''), contributing to another destabilization of the economy, along the with already big [[foreign debt]] of the country<ref name=law>{{cite web|author=Sara Flounders|title=Origins of the breakup<U+2014>a U.S. law|year=1995|url=http://www.iacenter.org/bosnia/origins.htm}}</ref>.

Markovi<U+0107> remained in office even after the start of the war, only to resign in December 1991, insulated and without any authority.

After that, Markovi<U+0107> disappeared from the public eye. In [[1993]] he was rumoured to be [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man|Tu<U+0111>man]]'s choice for [[Prime Minister of Croatia|Croatian prime minister]], apparently due to his economic expertise. The post ultimately fell to [[Nikica Valenti<U+0107>]], who had used some of Markovi<U+0107>'s recipes to halt inflation.

Markovi<U+0107> instead dedicated himself to a business career. In the early 2000s he worked as an economic advisor to the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]n government.

He appeared as a witness at [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>|Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>'s]] trial at the [[ICTY]] in [[2003]]. This appearance broke his 12 years of silence; after that testimony, he gave an interview to the [[Zagreb]]-based [[Globus (weekly)|Globus]] news magazine. In his testimony he stated that both Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> and [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man|Tu<U+0111>man]] confirmed to him that in March 1991 in [[Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>evo]] they made an agreement to get himself out of politics.
