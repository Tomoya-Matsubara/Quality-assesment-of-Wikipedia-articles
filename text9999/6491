==Background==

"Ayakaji no Ne" was Natsukawa's first album after her first greatest hits album, "[[Rimi Natsukawa Single Collection Vol. 1]]." It was preceded by two singles: {{nihongo|"[[Kokoro Tsutae]]"|<U+30B3><U+30B3><U+30ED><U+30C4><U+30BF><U+30A8>|Heart Report}} in December 2004 and {{nihongo|"[[Say<U+014D>nara Arigat<U+014D>]]"|<U+3055><U+3088><U+3046><U+306A><U+3089> <U+3042><U+308A><U+304C><U+3068><U+3046>|Good-Bye, Thank You}} in November 2005. "Say<U+014D>nara Arigat<U+014D>" was re-arranged and re-released after the album as {{nihongo|"[[Say<U+014D>nara Arigat<U+014D> (Ama no Kaze)/Mirai|Say<U+014D>nara Arigat<U+014D> (Ama no Kaze)]]"|<U+3055><U+3088><U+3046><U+306A><U+3089> <U+3042><U+308A><U+304C><U+3068><U+3046><U+FF5E><U+5929><U+306E><U+98A8><U+FF5E>|Good-Bye, Thank You (Sky Wind)}}, and features in this version on her following studio album, "[[Umui Kaji]]."

==Collaborations==

Much like "[[Kaze no Michi]]" before it, the album centres around original songs composed by high profile artists. "Sagaribana" was written by [[Hitoshi Uechi]] of [[Begin (band)|Begin]], "[[Say<U+014D>nara Arigat<U+014D>]]" was written by [[Kentar<U+014D> Kobuchi]] of [[Kobukuro]], "Shinobu Hana" by [[Kazufumi Miyazawa]]  of [[The Boom]], "[[Kokoro Tsutae]]" by singer-songwriter [[Shinji Tanimura]] and "Chiharu-zaka" by Okinawan singer-songwriter [[Yasukatsu <U+014C>jima]].

Many of the songs were in collaboration with artists previously worked with. "Shimadachi" was written by [[Tetsuya Murakami]] of [[The Gospellers]] (Natsukawa collaborated with Gospellers members [[Yutaka Yasuoka]] and [[Kaoru Kurosawa]] on her former album "[[Kaze no Michi]]"). "Tamachiyu no Ashibi" was written in collaboration with [[Parsha Club]] guitarist [[Masaaki Uechi]] ("Tsuki no Niji" on Kaze no Michi was written by him also). 

"Koi Uta" had its lyrics written by [[Ryoko Moriyama]], and "Unai-jima" had lyrics by [[Misako Koja]] (Natsukawa covered their songs "[[Nada S<U+014D>s<U+014D>]]"/"Dare ni mo Ienai Kedo" and "[[Warabigami]]"/"Kui nu Hajimi" respectively).

"Ai no Chikara" was a collaboration between two famous Okinawan singers, lyrics by [[Mamoru Miyagi]] and music by [[Johnny Ginowan]].

"Tokotowa no Uta" was between [[Chikuzen Sato]] (leader of band [[Sing Like Talking]]) and [[Departures (film)|Departures]]' screenwriter [[Kundo Koyama]].
