The '''Treaty''' or '''Peace of Venice''', [[1177 in Italy|1177]], was an important [[peace treaty]] between the [[papacy]] and its allies, the north Italian city-states of the [[Lombard League]], and [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The Norman [[Kingdom of Sicily]] also took part in negotiations and the treaty thereby determined the political course of all [[Italy]] for the next several years. 

The treaty followed on the heels of the [[Battle of Legnano]] of 29 May 1176, a defeat for Frederick Barbarossa. Frederick quickly thereafter sent envoys to [[Pope Alexander III]] at [[Anagni]], asking for an end to the schism between him and Frederick's [[antipope]], [[Antipope Callixtus III|Callixtus III]]. After a preliminary agreement was reached, a conference was scheduled for July 1177. Frederick spent some time in the interim interfering in Venetian rivalries in hopes of securing a pro-Imperial group in power at the time of the confrontation. 

On 24 July, the pope from the [[Basilica di San Marco]] sent a delegation of cardinals to the emperor in the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]], at the mouth of the Venetian Lagoon. The emperor formally acknowledged Alexander as pope and abandoned his own antipope; the cardinals formally lifted the excommunication that had hitherto been placed upon him. [[Sebastian Ziani]], the [[doge of Venice]], and [[Ulrich II von Treven]], the [[patriarch of Aquileia]], then escorted the emperor into Venice itself. The delegates of the king of Sicily were [[Romuald, Archbishop of Salerno]], a chronicler of his time who left us a great eyewitness account of the whole scene, and Count [[Roger of Andria]]. 

In the treaty that was concluded, the emperor recognised the temporal rights of the popes over the city of [[Rome]], despite which the city did not surrender to the pope and forced him to leave in 1179. A fifteen-year peace was concluded between Frederick and [[William II of Sicily]], paving the way for Sicily's golden years of peace and prosperity. Likewise a six-year truce was concluded with the Lombard League, but negotiations were to continue, and the emperor finally recognised the independence of the Lombard cities in the [[Peace of Constance]] of 1183.
