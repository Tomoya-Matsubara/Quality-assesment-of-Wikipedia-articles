'''Stuyvesant High School''' (commonly '''Stuy''') is a [[public high school]] in [[New York City]] that specializes in [[mathematics|math]] and [[science]]. It is one of several [[Specialized High Schools of New York City|specialized schools]] run by the [[New York City Department of Education]]. The school opened in 1904 on [[Manhattan]]'s East Side, and it only admitted boys for 65 years. Since 1969, Stuyvesant has been a [[coeducation]]al school, and after moving to its [[Battery Park City, Manhattan|Battery Park City]] building, the facilities for girls were put on par with those for boys.

Admission to Stuyvesant is by [[Specialized High Schools Admissions Test|competitive examination]] and is open to all residents of New York City with no [[tuition]] fee. The school is noted for its [[List of Stuyvesant High School people|famous alumni]], its academics, and the large number of its graduates attending prestigious universities.  There has been a friendly long-standing rivalry between Stuyvesant and the [[Bronx High School of Science]] over students' awards from the [[Intel Science Talent Search]], with both schools claiming dominance at various times.

Classes were in session at Stuyvesant when a terrorist attack destroyed the nearby [[World Trade Center]] towers, and the school building served as a command post for several weeks afterwards.  The school was temporarily relocated and shared facilities with [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] until it could return to its own building. The special issue of the ''The Stuyvesant Spectator'' on the tragedy was reprinted in ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Stuyvesant High School routinely engages well-known cultural, academic, and political figures to speak at its annual [[graduation|commencement ceremonies]]. Former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] addressed the Class of 2002; United Nations Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] addressed the Class of 2004; and late night talk show host [[Conan O'Brien]] addressed the Class of 2006.

==History==
[[Image:Old-stuy-building-1909.gif|right|thumb|[[Postcard]] art featuring the 15<sup>th</sup> Street Stuyvesant building]]
Stuyvesant High School is named after [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the last [[Netherlands|Dutch]] governor of [[New Netherland]] before the ownership of the colony was transferred to [[England]] in 1664.<ref>{{cite paper|title=(Former) Stuyvesant High School|publisher=Landmarks Preservation Commission|url=http://www.stuyvesant.ourstrongband.org/LandMarkDesignation/Stuy%20Landmark%20Designation.pdf|date=[[1997-05-20]]|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> 

The school was established in 1904 as a [[Vocational education|manual training]] school for boys, hosting 155 students and 12 teachers. In 1907, it moved from its original location at 225 East [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] to 345 East 15th Street, where it remained for the following 85 years. Its reputation for excellence in math and science continued to grow, and enrollment was restricted based on previous scholastic achievement starting in 1919.<ref name="cfs_timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuyvesant.ourstrongband.org/Timeline%20Annual.htm|title=Stuyvesant High School Timeline by Class Year|publisher=The Campaign for Stuyvesant|accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref>

The school went on a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students. The practice allowed double use of classroom space, with some students attending in the morning and others in the afternoon and early evening. All students still studied a full set of courses. Double sessions would run until 1956.<ref name="cfs_timeline"/> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/segal73.htm|title=Interview with George Segal|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Archives of American Art]]|first=Paul|last=Cummings|date=1973-11-26|accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref>

In the 1930s, entrance examinations were implemented, making admission to the school even more competitive. During the 1950s, the building underwent a $2 million renovation to update its classrooms, shops, libraries and cafeterias.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuy-pa.org/files/documents/04-05ParentHandbook.pdf|title=History of Stuyvesant High School|first=Eugene|last=Blaufarb|work=Stuyvesant High School Parent Handbook|publisher=Stuyvesant Parents Association|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>

In 1969, 14 girls enrolled at Stuyvesant, marking the school's first co-educational year. Now, approximately 43% of students are female.<ref name="NYCDOE2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycenet.edu/daa/SchoolReports/03asr/171475.pdf|title=2002-2003 Annual Report, Stuyvesant High School|format=PDF|author=Manhattan Superintendancy|publisher=New York City Public Schools|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref>

In 1957, a team of 50 students began construction of a [[cyclotron]], a project sponsored by the physics department. By 1962, a low-power test of the device succeeded. Matt Deming '62 remembered that a later attempt at full-power operation "tanked the electrical system for the building and surrounding area".<ref name="OSB_cyclotron">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuyvesant.ourstrongband.org/extracurriculars.htm#cyclotron|title=The Cyclotron Committee|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref> <ref name="stuy_timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuy100.org/stuy-timeline.html|title=Stuyvesant 100 Year Timeline|accessdate=2006-06-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041014033551/www.stuy100.org/stuy-timeline.html|archivedate=2004-10-14}}</ref> According to Abraham Baumel, Stuyvesant principal from 1983 to 1994, "... I can tell you with certainty that the cyclotron never worked at Stuyvesant any more than it did for [[Ernest Lawrence]], and he was awarded a Nobel Prize for his invention of the cyclotron. The Russians never succeeded in getting one to work, either".<ref name="OSB_cyclotron"/>

In 1972, Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, Stuyvesant and [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts]] were chosen by the New York State Legislature as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science and Stuyvesant High School. The exam, named the [[Specialized High Schools Admissions Test]] (SHSAT), tested students in math and science. Admission to LaGuardia High School was by audition rather than examination, in keeping with its artistic mission.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_2_how_gothams_elite.html|title=How Gotham<U+2019>s Elite High Schools Escaped the Leveller<U+2019>s Ax|first=Heather|last=Mac Donald|date=Spring 1999|publisher=City Journal|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> 

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, at least four Stuyvesant teachers died from [[AIDS]].{{fact}}

In 1992, a new, waterfront building was constructed to house the high school (see [[Stuyvesant High School#School facilities|school facilities]]).

Stuyvesant is a quarter-mile (approx. 400 metres) from [[World Trade Center site|the former site]] of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. The school was evacuated during the ordeal and the students were temporarily relocated to Brooklyn Tech starting [[September 21]] while the Stuyvesant building was used as one of several bases of operations by rescue and recovery workers. This caused serious congestion at Brooklyn Tech and required the students to go to school in two shifts. Normal classes resumed three weeks later on [[October 9]].
[[Image:Spectator 9-11.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The 9/11 issue of ''The Spectator''.]]
Because of Stuyvesant's close proximity to [[Ground zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]], some were initially concerned about the possibility of [[asbestos]] exposure to Stuyvesant. Indeed, the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) initial suggestion that the area was safe is not accurate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuypa.org/Environment/OIG%20Summary%2009-15-03.doc|title=Parents' Association briefing about EPA report|first=Dave|last=Newman|date=[[2003-09-15]]|format=MS-Word|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref>  However, the EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos. Some problems have been reported, including respiratory problems of former teacher Mark Bodenheimer, who accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases similar to Bodenheimer's have been reported. Nonetheless, there is no definite evidence that such cases relate to Stuyvesant at all, and current exposure to asbestos at Stuyvesant is improbable. {{fact}}

Alumni who were killed during the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center include Daniel D. Bergstein '80 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.september11victims.com/september11victims/VictimInfo.asp?ID=519|title=Daniel D.

[[Richard Ben-Veniste]] '60 was on the [[9/11 Commission]].

On [[October 2]] [[2001]], the school paper, ''The Spectator'', included a special full-color 9/11 insert containing student photos, reflections and stories. The insert was reprinted in the [[November 20]] [[2001]] issue of ''[[The New York Times]]''.
[[Image:With their eyes.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''With Their Eyes'']]
In the months after 9/11, Annie Thoms, an English teacher at Stuyvesant, a 1993 alumna, and the theater adviser at the time, suggested that the students take accounts of staff and students' reactions during and after 9/11 and turn them into a series of monologues. Thoms then published these monologues as ''With Their Eyes: September 11th <U+2013> The View from a High School at Ground Zero'' (ISBN 0060517182). Alexander Epstein of ''The Stuyvesant Standard'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuystandard.org|title=The Stuyvesant Standard|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref>, an independent newspaper serving the school's community, contributed the section ''Out of the Blue'' to the book ''At Ground Zero: Young Reporters Who Were There Tell Their Stories'' (ISBN 1560254270).

In the early 2000s, Gary He '02 started the now-defunct stuynet.com, a website where students could rate their teachers, although he later shut down the evaluation section after mathematics teacher Bruce Winokur threatened a libel suit. Words left on the website read "Teacher Evaluations is currently down but will soon be back better than ever. The vox populi must be heard".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loper.org/~george/trends/2001/Jun/52.html|title=Freedom of Expression: Student Criticism and Teacher Evaluations|accessdate=2006-06-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030514092600/http://loper.org/~george/trends/2001/Jun/52.html|archivedate=2003-05-14}}</ref> [[image:Stuy100logo.jpg|right|90px|Stuyvesant centennial logo]] When Stuyvesant's official web site crashed on [[September 11]] [[2001]], and during the days right after, Gary He's website was the only online source of information and moral support for the distraught Stuyvesant community. Stuynet.com now lives on under its new alias, stuycom.net.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuycom.net|title=Stuycom.net|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref>

During the 2003-2004 school year, Stuyvesant celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding with a full year of activities. Events included a parade from the 15<sup>th</sup> Street building to the Chambers Street one; a meeting of the [[National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology]]; an all-class reunion; and visits and speeches from notable alumni. [[United Nations Secretary-General|United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] spoke at the graduation of Stuyvesant's class of 2004.

==Enrollment==
Stuyvesant has a total enrollment of about 3,200 and is open to residents of New York City entering either [[ninth grade|ninth]] or [[tenth grade]]. Enrollment is based solely on performance on the [[Specialized High Schools Admissions Test|Specialized High School Admission Test]] (SHSAT).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycenet.edu/OurSchools/HSDirectory/SpecializedHighSchoolsStudentHandbook.htm|title=NYC DoE Specialized High Schools Student Handbook|year=2005|publisher=New York City Dept. of Education|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref> The list of schools using the SHSAT has since grown to include all of New York's specialized high schools except LaGuardia High School, where entry is by audition rather than examination. Since its relocation to its [[Battery Park City, Manhattan|Battery Park City]] campus, the test score necessary for admission to Stuyvesant has been higher than that needed for admission to the other schools using the test.<ref name="NYCDOE_round">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycenet.edu/Offices/StudentEnroll/HSAdmissions/hsProcess/Specialadm/special.htm|title=Specialized Admissions Round|publisher=New York City Dept. of Education|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref> Admission is currently based on an individual's score on the examination and his or her pre-submitted ranking of Stuyvesant among the other specialized schools. Each year, about 22,000 of New York City's 90,000 [[eighth grade|eighth-graders]] sit for the test, with only approximately 800 highest scoring applicants are admitted to their first choice school. Ninth and rising tenth graders are also eligible to take the test for enrollment, though far fewer students are admitted this way.

[[Image:Stuy building.jpg|left|thumb|250px|View of the Stuyvesant building from the corner of West and Chambers Streets. The Tribeca Bridge is in the foreground.]]

Those who score in the second-highest score bracket are offered admission to their second-choice school, while those who score in the third-highest bracket are offered admission to their third choice school. According to Article 12 of New York education law, "Admissions to the Bronx High School of Science, Stuyvesant High School, and Brooklyn Technical High School shall be solely and exclusively by taking a competitive, objective, and scholastic achievement examination, which shall be open to each and every child in the city of New York".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counsel.nysed.gov/Decisions/volume35/d13477.htm|title=Appeal of CARY MARK GOODMAN, on behalf of his son, MOSAH FERNANDEZ GOODMAN, from action of the Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York regarding a specialized high school test|date=[[1995-08-30]]|author=Corporation Counsel|publisher=New York City Dept. of Education|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref> The current admission policy is available from the NYC Department of Education.<ref name="NYCDOE_round"/> According to the Department of Education, Stuyvesant accepts students solely based on their performance on the SHSAT, although former Mayor [[John Lindsay]] and community activist group [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]] have argued that the exam may be biased against [[African American|African]] and [[Hispanic|Hispanic Americans]].  <ref name="ACORN_SA2RRR">{{cite web|url=http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=540|title="Secret Apartheid II: Race, Regents, and Resources"|publisher=ACORN|accessdate=2006-05-06}}</ref>  

Stuyvesant has contributed to the education of several [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates, winners of the [[Fields Medal]] and the [[Wolf Prize]], and a host of other accomplished alumni. It consistently leads the nation in the number of [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholarships]] awarded and regularly trades off the leading position in the number of Intel Science Talent Search Semi-Finalists and Finalists with Bronx Science.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.sciserv.org/sts/press/20010117.asp|title=Intel Science Talent Search Awards $600,000 to 300 Student Semifinalists and 166 Schools|accessdate=2006-07-09|date=[[2007-01-17]]|publisher=[[Science Service]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.uncc.edu/~hbreiter/doc9.htm|title=Nurturing Science's Young Elite: Westinghouse Talent Search|first=Scott|last=Huler|publisher=[[The Scientist]]|date=[[1991-04-15]]|accessdate=2006-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[New York Times]]|title=At Stuyvesant, Kudos for Scientific Creativity in the Shadow of Ruin|date=[[2002-01-17]]|first=Yilu|last=Zhao}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[New York Times]]|title=Stuyvesant Defeats Inertia To Lead Intel Rivals Again|date=[[2003-01-16]]|first=Jennifer|last=Medina}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[New York Times]]|title=Stuyvesant Again Leads in Science Contest|date=[[2004-01-14]]|first=Kimetris|last=Baltrip}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[New York Times]]|title=New York Students Dominate Intel Science Contest.

Stuyvesant also was the high school with the highest number of [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] exams taken, and also the highest number of students reaching the mastery level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/26/education/26advanced.html|title=New York Tops Advanced Placement Tests|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[2006-01-26]]|first=Susan|last=Saulny|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref>

==School facilities==

[[Image:Danny-Jaye---Rothenberg-mem.jpg|right|thumb|The Rothenberg memorial.]]
By the 1980s, the East 15th Street building was no longer a quality educational facility by modern standards, and the number of students had also increased to several thousand and could not be accommodated by the five-story building. The New York City Board of Education secured an agreement with the Battery Park City Authority for a new building, and construction began in 1989. The new ten-floor building, located near lower Manhattan's [[Financial District, Manhattan|financial district]], was constructed at a cost of about $148 million, and included 65 classrooms with about 450 computers on 13 networks, 7 pairs of [[escalator]]s, various indoor sporting facilities including two [[gym|gymnasiums]] and a pool built to [[PSAL|Public Schools Athletic League]] standards, a theater with acoustics and lighting to accommodate music and drama productions, two lecture halls with movable partitions, a skylit [[cafeteria]] overlooking the [[Hudson River]], 12 science laboratories (including a [[molecular biology]] lab and an [[analytical chemistry]] lab) and special shops for instruction in [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[photography]], [[Woodworking|wood]], [[plastic]]s, [[metalworking|metal work]], [[robot]]ics and energy studies. One room in the Stuyvesant building, called the "Museum Room", was built as a replica of a room in the 15<sup>th</sup> Street Stuyvesant building, with desks, chairs, a table and blackboard brought from there, as well as paint and flooring in its style. The room was dedicated to teacher Dr. A. Edward Stefanacci, who died in 1993. The school's library has a capacity of 40,000 volumes and overlooks Battery Park City.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDB1531F935A35755C0A965958260|title=ARCHITECTURE VIEW On the Hudson, Launching Minds Instead of Ships|first=Herbert|last=Muschamp|date=[[1993-06-06]]|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>

The New York City Department of Education reports that public per student spending at Stuyvesant is slightly lower than the city average.<ref name="NYCDOE2003"/>  However, Stuyvesant also receives some private contributions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourstrongband.org/Videos/CampaignForStuyvesant_Broadband.wmv|title=Stuyvesant promotional video|format=video (WMV)|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref> Shortly after the new building was completed, the $10 million TriBeCa Bridge was built to allow students to enter the building without having to cross the busy West Street.

The new building is one of the 5 additional sites of P721M, a school for older (aged 15-21) students with multiple [[disability|disabilities]] and [[mental retardation]]. Wheelchair-bound students can sometimes be seen throughout the building. Some teachers remark on the unusual [[juxtaposition]] of the [[gifted]] with the disabled.

Glass boxes set into various places in the building's wall hold mementos from the year of each graduating class. Items displayed include water from most large rivers, mud from the [[Dead Sea]], a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] button, pieces of the 15<sup>th</sup> Street Stuyvesant building and of monuments around the world, and various chemical compounds. In 1997, the eastern end of the mathematics floor (in which the math department office is located) was dedicated to Dr. Richard Rothenberg, the math department chairman before his death from a sudden heart attack in 1997. The Rothenberg memorial, commissioned in his honor, is a wall made up of 49 of these boxes, each featuring a concept in mathematics.

==Academics==
Stuyvesant students undergo a [[university-preparatory school|college preparatory]] curriculum including four years of [[English language|English]], [[history]], and a laboratory-based [[science]], three years of [[mathematics|math]] (though most students opt to take four years) and foreign language, a semester each of introductory [[art]], [[music]], [[health]], [[computer science]], and two lab-based technology courses (although there are several exemptions by which students may be excused from technology education in their senior years).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuy-pa.org/files/documents/04-05ParentHandbook.pdf|title=Graduation Requirements|work=Stuyvesant High School Parent Handbook|publisher=Stuyvesant Parents Association|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.stuy.edu/program_office/grad_reqs.html|title=Graduation Requirements|publisher=Stuyvesant High School|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>

Stuyvesant offers students a broad selection of elective courses. Some of the more unusual offerings include robotics, [[musical acoustics|physics of music]], [[astronomy]], and the mathematics of [[financial market]]s.<ref name="STUY_COURSES">{{cite web|url=http://register.stuy.edu/program_office/course_descriptions.html|title=Online Course Guide|publisher=Stuyvesant High School|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>  Most students take [[calculus]], and the school offers math courses through [[differential equation]]s and [[linear algebra]].  A year of [[technical drawing]] used to be required; students learned how to draft by hand in its first semester and how to draft using a computer (CAD) in the second.  Now, students take a one-semester class called Technology Graphic Communications (equivalent to the former year of drafting), and a semester of introductory computer science in order to introduce the mainly science-oriented students to computer programming early in their careers.  

[[Image:Stuydoors.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Entrance from the TriBeCa Bridge]]

A variety of Advanced Placement courses (31 are available at Stuyvesant <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuy100.org/about.html|title=Stuyvesant H.S. 100 Year Anniversary|accessdate=2006-06-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050305222753/http://www.stuy100.org/about.html|archivedate=2005-03-05}}</ref>) offer students the chance to earn college credits. A few students earn enough college credit to start college as sophomores.  In 2004, Stuyvesant began complying with Department of Education regulations mandating that [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] courses be weighted by a factor of 1.1 in [[grade (education)#United States|grade point averages]].  However, this caused widespread outcry among students, faculty, and teachers, and in 2005, Stuyvesant was granted special permission to revert the weight of AP courses back to 1. {{fact}}

Computer science enthusiasts can take two additional computer programming courses after the completion of advanced placement computer science: systems level programming and [[computer graphics]]. There is also a 2 year [[computer networking]] sequence which can earn students [[Cisco Career Certifications|Cisco Certified Network Associate]] (CCNA) certification.

Stuyvesant's foreign language offerings rival those of many colleges, including the basics like [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as well as [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].  In 2000, [[Chinese language|Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] for native speakers were introduced in response to Stuyvesant's burgeoning [[Asian American]] population.  Courses are also offered in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], but these courses, along with Korean, may only be taken as electives.

Stuyvesant's [[Biology]] and Geo-science department offers courses in molecular biology (a course sequence comprised of a molecular science class in the Fall and a molecular genetics class in the Spring), [[human physiology]], [[medical ethics]], medical and veterinary diagnosis, human disease, [[anthropology]] and [[sociobiology]], [[vertebrate zoology]], [[laboratory]] techniques, medical human [[genetics]], [[botany]], the molecular basis of cancer, nutrition science, and [[psychology]]. The Chemistry and Physics department offers [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], astronomy, [[engineering]] mechanics, and [[electronics]].<ref name="STUY_COURSES"/>

Although primarily known for its strength in math and science, Stuyvesant is also home to a robust music program and offers students ten music groups, ranging from a symphony [[orchestra]] and [[jazz]] ensemble to a chamber [[choir]].  Comprehensive programs in the [[humanities]] offer students courses in British and classical literature, [[philosophy]], [[existentialism]], [[debate]], [[acting]], [[journalism]], and a host of [[creative writing]] and [[poetry]] classes.  The history core requires a year of [[ancient history|ancient]], [[History of Europe|European]] and [[History of the United States|American history]], as well as a semester of [[economics]] and [[government]].  Humanities electives include American [[foreign policy]], [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law]], [[Jewish history]], "[[prejudice]] and [[persecution]]", "[[race]], [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] and [[gender]] issues", small business [[management]], and [[Wall Street]].

Stuyvesant has recently entered into an agreement with [[City College of New York]], in which the college funds advanced after-school courses that are taken for college credit but taught by Stuyvesant teachers.  Some of these courses include physical chemistry, linear algebra, advanced Euclidean geometry, and women's history. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectator.stuy.edu/display.cgi?id=1361|title=Stuyvesant Students Get a Taste of College After School|date=[[2004-10-18]]|fisrt=Jin-ji|last=Kim|accessdate=2006-06-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050223090251/http://spectator.stuy.edu/display.cgi?id=1361|archivedate=2005-02-23}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectator.stuy.edu/display.cgi?id=1360|title=Staff Editorial|accessdate=2006-06-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050223084654/http://spectator.stuy.edu/display.cgi?id=1360|archivedate=2005-02-23}}</ref>

Grade point averages at Stuyvesant are calculated to two decimal places; some argue that the distinction is overly fine and encourages excessive grade competition, while  others use the theory of [[significant figures|significant digits]] to argue that they are irrelevant.  Nevertheless, the practice continues.  The practice is not entirely unprecedented; in calculations for honors and other designations, the [[University of Chicago]] calculates grade point averages to four decimal places. {{fact}}

==Extracurricular activities==
===Sports===
Stuyvesant fields 26 [[varsity team|varsity teams]], including a [[swimming]] team, as well as [[golf]], [[bowling]], [[volleyball]], [[football (soccer)|soccer]], [[basketball]], [[gymnastics]], [[amateur wrestling|wrestling]], [[fencing]], [[baseball]]/[[softball]], [[team handball|handball]], [[tennis]], [[Athletics|track]]/[[Cross country running|cross country]], [[cricket]] and [[American football|football]] teams. In addition, Stuyvesant club teams include boys' varsity and junior varsity, and girls' varsity [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]] teams. The Stuyvesant Track and Field team were [[PSAL|Public Schools Athletic League]] Cross Country City Champions in 2004 and 2005. The Stuyvesant Swimming Team, the Pirates, have been PSAL City Champions consecutively since 2000 and Opens champions since 1995. The Stuyvesant Bowling Team has been the PSAL Manhattan Borough Champion consecutively since 1990. The girls soccer team, the Mimbas, brought home the City Championship title in 2001, 2004, and 2005, despite a severe lack of practice space and lack of a home field. {{fact}}

Unlike most American high schools, every sports team at Stuyvesant has its own name, like the Peaches (softball), the Ballers (boys soccer), the Penguins (girls swimming), the Phoenix (girls basketball), and the Mimbas (girls soccer). These names tend to change with time and lend each Stuyvesant team a unique flavor.

In 2000, Stuyvesant added a varsity ice hockey team, the first public school in New York City to do so. The team was run by students without administrative assistance for several years.  There is also an annual alumni game, where notable Stuyvesant alumni hockey players such as Tim Robbins and Len Berman often appear. The team has been in first place in its 8-team [[Chelsea Piers]] league every year, though it often plays teams from outside the league. Stuyvesant is also a powerhouse in fencing with a string of city championships from 1986 through 1989. Stuyvesant does not, however, have a football field, baseball field, or tennis court, though the new building does have a pool. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://physed.stuy.edu/sportsteam.html|title=Stuyvesant Athletics|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref>

===Clubs===
Stuyvesant offers clubs, publications, teams and other opportunities under a system similar to that of many colleges.  It hosts over 200 clubs ranging from "PottyRings", a club dedicated to [[Harry Potter]] and the [[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]], to Pink LEMONed, a Japanese rock culture club, to Help the Helpless, dedicated to community service, and the Robotics Team, which competes in the international [[FIRST|FIRST Robotics Competition]].<ref name="clubsandpubs">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuysu.org/cp|title=Clubs and Pubs|publisher=Stuyvesant High School|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> The [[oratory|speech]] and debate team is nationally recognized and arguably one of Stuyvesant's most successful teams, with a 25+ year history of winning national championship tournaments on both individual and team levels.  Other debating clubs include [[Junior State of America]] (a political debate club) and [[Model United Nations]]. The Stuyvesant Theater Community puts on three student-run productions a year (a fall [[musical theatre|musical]], a winter [[drama]], and a spring [[comedy]]) as well as a one-act festival and several smaller studio productions. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuytheater.org|title=Stuyvesant Theater Community|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref>

===Publications===
[[Image:Math-survey-vol-75-no-1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Math Survey'', Stuyvesant's resident mathematics publication]]

Stuyvesant hosts 25 publications, including many departmental [[magazine]]s. <ref name="clubsandpubs"/>

====The Spectator====
''The Spectator'' is Stuyvesant's official school [[newspaper]]. It contains 11 sections: news, features, [[editorial|op-ed]], arts & entertainment, sports, photography, art, layout, copy, business, and web. The departments are each headed by at least two editors, all of whom encompass the editorial board of the paper. The editorial board meets daily in the Spectator [[journalism]] class and is headed by the Editor in Chief and Managing Editor. At the start of their term, the Editor in Chief and Managing Editor select four editors to be members of the Managing Board, a group that advises the Editor in Chief and Managing Editor on matters relating to the paper. There are over 250 total staff members who help to produce the bi-weekly publication. The Spectator is independent from the school, but it remains the prime news source for students, teachers, and adminstrators. 

The Spectator, founded in 1915, is one of Stuyvesant's oldest publications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuyvesant.ourstrongband.org/extracurriculars.htm#Spectator|title=The Spectator|work=Stuyvesant High School Extra-curricula's|publisher=The Campaign for Stuyvesant|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>  It has a long-standing connection with its older namesake, [[Columbia University|Columbia University's]] ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'', and it has been recognized by the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism's]] [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]] on several occasions, most recently in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cspa/docs/awards-to-people/sullivan/recipients/index.html|title=Awards to People|publisher=[[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]]|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>

====The Stuyvesant Standard====
Founded in 2001, ''The Stuyvesant Standard'' is a bi-weekly, independent newspaper published by Stuyvesant students for the community in and around the school. It covers news at school, city, state, national and international levels and contains "interest sections" such as Business, Science, Literary and Puzzle (Leisure), alongside the standard departments of Opinions, Sports, and Arts & Entertainment. Always a laboratory for innovative columns, its current columns include: "Meet This Teacher," "The Critical Lens," a space on students' opinions, "Sports Beat" and "Tomorrow's Technology Today." The Standard is distributed within Stuyvesant and throughout the surrounding community. 

Despite its youth, The Standard is now one of the largest organizations at Stuyvesant. Its alumni remain close to the current staff and are very active in the paper.

====Other publications====
*''Caliper'', Stuyvesant's biannual literary magazine.  Caliper is one of the oldest high school literary publications in the nation, and along with monthly open mic sessions, helps the Stuyvesant literary community flourish in an environment focusing on math and science.
*''Indicator'', the Stuyvesant year book.
*''Math Survey'', the annual Math Department publication.  Many of Stuyvesant's notable mathematicians were first published in Math Survey.  The [http://65.104.11.121/Srv1948F/index.html 1948 edition] is available online.
*''Political Fire:'' An unofficial newspaper started in 2006 which deals solely with political issues.
*''The Broken Escalator:'' A now-defunct humor publication, which has not been printed since 2005.

===Academic Teams=== 
Stuyvesant's academic teams include speech and debate, [[quizbowl|Quiz Bowl]], [[chess]], science olympiad, and math, which regularly compete successfully at major regional, national, and &mdash; at least in the case of the math team &mdash; international tournaments. A FIRST Robotics team, called Stuypulse, <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuypulse.com|title=Stuyvesant Robotics 694|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref> was founded in 2000 and has since won the New York City Regional ('03), and the New York Chairman's Award ('05). Stuyvesant also has a [[Model United Nations]] team, a JSA ([[Junior State of America]]) chapter, and a Model Congress team which competes at regional colleges.

===SING!=== 
[[Image:Stuy sing v 1977.jpg|right|thumb|150px|SING V program, 1977]]
The annual theater competition known as [[SING! (musical)|''SING!'']] pits seniors, juniors, and "soph-frosh" (freshmen and sophomores working together) against each other in a race to put on the best performance. Started in 1947 at [[Midwood High School]] in [[Brooklyn]], SING! is a tradition at many New York City high schools. At Stuyvesant, SING! started as a small event in 1972, and has grown to a huge school-wide event &mdash; in 2005, nearly 1,000 students participated. The entire production is written, produced, and funded by students. Their involvement ranges from cast, chorus, Irish Jig, Step, Bollywood Dance, Latin Dance, and tech crews. SING! begins in late November and culminates in final performances on three nights in March/April. The show sells out all three nights, raising over $30,000 for Stuyvesant's Clubs and Pubs via the Student Union Budget. {{fact}}

==Student body==
[[Image:Stuy students on Tribeca bridge.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Students entering through the Tribeca bridge]]
For most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the student body at Stuyvesant was heavily [[Jew]]ish, however [[Asian American|Asian]] students began a significant influx in the 1970s.  As of 2005, the student body was approximately 51 percent Asian and 38 percent [[White (people)|Caucasian]], with [[African American|Blacks]] and [[Hispanic]]s each constituting roughly four percent of the population apiece.  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycenet.edu/OurSchools/Region9/M475/default.htm|title=Stuyvesant High School|publisher=New York City Dept. of Education|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref> Russian and Indian students are well-represented, and Jews continue to comprise a large portion of the student body. Stuyvesant possesses a disproportionate amount of historical minorities in comparison to national and local population distributions.<ref name="Stern2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.educationnext.org/20033/20.html|title=Fa<U+00E7>ade of Excellence|first=Sol|last=Stern|year=2003|publisher=[[Hoover Institution]]|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref><ref name="NYCDOE2003"/> (See also [[New York City#Demographics|Demographics of New York City]])

Although Stuyvesant students must reside in New York City, there is a long-standing belief that some students reside in New Jersey or Long Island, in contravention of New York City law.

=== Racial profile ===
Jeffrey Hart wrote for the ''[[The Dartmouth Review|Dartmouth Review]]'', "When I went to Stuyvesant [in 1944], it was about 85% Jewish. Today it is about half Asian." <ref name=DartmouthReview1997>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartreview.com/archives/1997/05/28/destroying_excellence.php|title=Destroying Excellence|date=[[1997-05-28]]|first=Jeffrey|last=Hart|accessdate=2006-06-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041030110521/http://www.dartreview.com/archives/1997/05/28/destroying_excellence.php|archivedate=2004-10-30}}</ref> Yun Hee Kim called it an "Asian-dominated" school.  When asked at a college information session whether Asians could claim minority status on college applications, college advisor Carol Katz answered, "Look to your right, look to your left.  Asians are not a minority."

New York City Department of Education statistics reveal that as of 2005, the student body was approximately 51% Asian and 38% Caucasian, with Blacks and Hispanics each constituting roughly three percent of the population.  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycenet.edu/OurSchools/Region9/M475/default.htm|publisher=NYC Dept. of Education|title=Stuyvesant High School|accessdate=2006-05-06}}</ref> Russian and Indian students are well-represented, and Jews continue to maintain a strong presence.  About 30% of the incoming freshman class are immigrants to the United States, while 20% are first-generation Americans. <!-- ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b6/Case.pdf|title=?|accessdate=0000-00-00}}</ref -->   As of 2005, the most common countries of origin of immigrant students were [[China]], [[Russia]], and [[Bangladesh]].  <ref name="NYCDOE2003"/>

=== Controversy ===
==== Accusations of bias in admission tests ====
[[Image:ACORNlogo.gif|thumb|right|ACORN argued that the SHSAT was biased against minorities.]]
The school's off-center demographic profile and relative paucity of Black and Hispanic students have often been a source of consternation for some city administrators.  John Lindsay, mayor of New York City from 1966 to 1973, argued that the test was culturally biased against Black and Hispanic students and sought to implement an [[affirmative action]] program.  At the protest of parents, however, the plan was scrapped and led to the passage of Article 12, stating that admissions would continue to be by examination only.  Despite this, however, a small number of students judged to be economically disadvantaged and who come within a few points of the cut-off score may be given an extra chance to pass the test. <ref name="Stern2003"/>

In 1996 community activist group ACORN published two reports called "Secret Apartheid" and "Secret Apartheid II", calling the SHSAT "permanently suspect" and a "product of an institutional racism", and claiming that Black and Hispanic students did not have access to proper test preparation materials. <ref name="ACORN_SA2RRR"/>Along with Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, they began an initiative for more diversity in NY's gifted and specialized schools, in particular demanding that since only a few districts send the majority of Stuyvesant's and Bronx Sciences's students, that the SHSAT be suspended altogether "until the Board of Education can show that the students of each middle school in the system have had access to curricula and instruction that would prepare them for this test regardless of their color or economic status".  Jesse Shapiro, Stuyvesant valedictorian, and Micah C. Lasher, then a sophomore, published several editorials in response, and the outcome was averted. <ref name="stuy_timeline"/> <ref name=DartmouthReview1997/>

==== Self-segregation ====
In the early 2000s, Ling Wu Kong '01 published several articles in ''The Spectator'', the school's paper <ref  name="raceatstuy">{{cite web|url=http://spectator.stuy.edu/display.cgi?id=212|title=Race at Stuy|accessdate=2006-06-27|archiveurl=http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:-IoH4wuu3y0J:spectator.stuy.edu/display.cgi%3Fid%3D212|archivedate=2005-07-15}}</ref>, bemoaning an apparent lack of interaction between the different ethnic groups at Stuyvesant, while a junior echoed his claim, saying "Each group owns a location.  On the 6th floor is the Asian [[clique]].  The 5th floor is Blacks and Hispanics.  Whites hang out on the 2nd and 4th floors and outside at the wall."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abacusguide.com/stuyvesant_high_school.htm|title=Abacus Guide to Stuyvesant High School|first=Emily|last=Glickman|year=2002|accessdate=2006-05-06|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050311172311/http://www.abacusguide.com/stuyvesant_high_school.htm|archivedate=2005-03-11}}</ref> Most students prefer to socialize within their own ethnic groups, and like many ethnically diverse colleges and universities in the U.S., Stuyvesant has developed into a "[[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]]" &mdash; with different sections of the Stuyvesant building being implicitly reserved for members of particular ethnic groups.  A series of ''Spectator'' editorials titled "Race @ Stuy" have also attempted to tackle the subject.

An Asian Students Association and a Black Students' League exist, although a 2000 request for a White Students' League was denied, with administration claiming the name connoted racism. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectator.stuy.edu/display.cgi?id=56|title=White Students' League Denied By Administration|accessdate=2006-06-27|archiveurl=http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:fHst-WZgjHUJ:spectator.stuy.edu/display.cgi%3Fid%3D56|archivedate=2005-07-15}}</ref>

=== Student profile ===
As it is a public school, Stuyvesant students attend tuition-free. Although poor students abound, the dominant social group is upper-middle class, split largely between the White Manhattanites, the Brooklynite Jews, a few African Americans and Asians from [[Queens]].

Stuyvesant is like most high schools in that many pay attention to fashion; perennial favorites for girls include [[bell-bottoms|flares]], either denim or nylon, while the boys' preferences are more fickle, ranging from ''[[JNCO|JnCos]]'' during the mid-1990s to smaller jeans and ''North Face'' jackets in the later 1990s.  Beat up sneakers <U+00E0> la ''[[Moby]]'' and brightly colored clothing are popular among Stuy's Manhattan "raver" contingent, while a few clad themselves in black gothic apparel.  Fishnet stockings and thigh-high boots are not uncommon.  Stuyvesant has no dress code, save the physical education department, which allows students to wear shorts and t-shirts of their choice.

==Notable people==
{{Main|List of Stuyvesant High School people}}

Stuyvesant has produced a steady stream of professional mathematicians, including more leading figures in the field than are associated with most major universities.  A number of leading physicists and chemists are also Stuyvesant alumni, as well as several well known entertainers and authors, including ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' star [[Lucy Liu]] and ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' star [[Tim Robbins]].

Stuyvesant alumni include four Nobel laureates:
*[[Joshua Lederberg]] (1941) - 1958 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]
*[[Robert Fogel]] (1944) - 1993 [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Memorial Prize in economics]]
*[[Roald Hoffmann]] (1954) - 1981 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]
*[[Richard Axel]] (1963) - 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]

Author [[Frank McCourt]] taught English at Stuyvesant before the publication of his novels ''[[Angela's Ashes]]'', ''[['Tis]]'', and ''[[Teacher Man]]''.  ''Teacher Man'''s third section, titled ''Coming Alive in Room 205'', is all about McCourt's time at Stuyvesant, and mentions a number of students and faculty.

==In pop culture==
The Stuyvesant High School building in Battery Park City was one of the main settings of the film ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'', although it was not mentioned by name.  As in the film, Stuyvesant has no pool on the roof, despite a long history of seniors selling "rooftop pool passes" to new freshmen. It does, however, have an Olympic-sized pool on the groud floor and a roof deck for its technology classes. In an episode of ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'', a female Stuyvesant student is murdered.  The investigation leads Detectives [[Robert Goren|Goren]] and [[Alexandra Eames|Eames]] to the school, where they interview her classmates.  The 2004 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] featured an ad campaign with a stylized depiction of the school entitled "Fast Times at Stuyvesant High." Also, the entrance to the high school is visible in the [[Beastie Boys]]' music video for the song ''Ch-Check It Out''. It is seen in the beginning of the video, where the three rappers are walking down the TriBeCa Bridge.

One of the members of the Beastie Boys in the ''[[Fight For Your Right (To Party)]]'' music video is wearing a boy's red Stuyvesant High School Physical Education Leader T-shirt.  This has occasionally sparked a rumor that one or all of the Boys attended Stuyvesant.  They did not, however [[Kate Schellenbach]], the band's original drummer, did.

Stuyvesant has been chronicled in popular literature based in New York City. The [[Jonathan Lethem]] novels ''Motherless Brooklyn'' and ''Fortress of Solitude'' are prominent examples of this trend.

Actress Amanda Bynes, as "Holly", attends Stuyvesant in the primetime television show [[What I Like About You (TV series)|What I Like About You]]. 

A [[documentary film|documentary]], entitled ''[[The Ticket (film)|THE TICKET]]'', is currently being filmed about the Student Union elections at Stuyvesant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suhfilms.com|title=THE TICKET (a documentary film)|publisher=Suh Films|accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref> Alec Klein '85, a reporter for the [[Washington Post]], is currently researching a book "which strives to explain what sets Stuyvesant apart from other high schools". <ref>The Alumni Spectator, Spring 2006</ref>
