'''Robert Granville "Bob" Lemon''' (September 22, 1920 <U+2013> January 11, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] right-handed [[pitcher]] and [[manager (baseball)|manager]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). Lemon was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] as a player in 1976.

Lemon was raised in [[California]] where he played high school baseball and was the state player of the year in 1938. At the age of 17, Lemon began his professional baseball career in the [[Cleveland Indians]] organization, with whom he played for his entire professional career. Lemon was called up to Cleveland's major league team as a [[utility player]] in 1941. He then joined the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]] and returned to the Indians in [[1946 Major League Baseball season|1946]]. That season was the first Lemon would play at the pitcher position. 

The Indians played in the [[1948 World Series]] and were helped by Lemon's two [[win (baseball)|pitching wins]] as they won the club's first championship since [[1920 Major League Baseball season|1920]]. In the early 1950s, Cleveland had a starting pitching rotation which included Lemon, [[Bob Feller]], [[Mike Garcia (AL pitcher)|Mike Garcia]] and [[Early Wynn]]. During the [[1954 Major League Baseball season|1954]] season, Lemon had a career-best 23&ndash;7 [[win-loss record (pitching)|win-loss record]] and the Indians set a 154-game season AL-record win mark when they won 111 games before they won the [[American League]] (AL) [[pennant (sports)|pennant]]. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] for seven consecutive seasons and recorded seven seasons of 20 or more pitching wins in a nine-year period from 1948&ndash;1956. 

Lemon was a [[manager (baseball)|manager]] with the [[Kansas City Royals]], [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]]. He was named Manager of the Year with the White Sox and Yankees. In [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]], he was fired as manager of the White Sox. He was named Yankees manager one month later and he led the team to a [[1978 World Series]] title. Lemon became the first AL manager to win a World Series after assuming the managerial role in the middle of a season.

==Early life==
Bob Lemon was born in [[San Bernardino, California]]. Lemon's father, Earl Lemon, ran an ice business and later moved the family to [[Long Beach, California]]. There, Lemon attended [[Wilson Classical High School]] and played [[shortstop]] on the school's baseball team.<ref name="Martin">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f3E_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=ulQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=7192,4228341&dq=bob+lemon+wilson+high+school&hl=en|title=My Favorite Big League Ball Player &ndash; Bob Lemon|date=6 April 1951|accessdate=9 September 2012|last=Martin|first=Johnny|newspaper=[[The Mount Airy News]]|page=13}}</ref> He was recognized as the state baseball player of the year by the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) [[CIF Southern Section|Southern Section]] in 1938.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.torranceca.gov/archivednewspapers/Herald/1960%20Mar%2020%20-%20July%2031/PDF/00000870.pdf|newspaper=The Torrance Herald|page=8|date=18 June 1960|accessdate=9 September 2012|title=Baseball Knows No Sympathy|last=Schipper|first=Bill|publisher=Torranceca.gov}}</ref> 

Later that same year, at the age of 17, Lemon began his professional baseball career in the farm system of the [[Cleveland Indians]] as a member of the Oswego Netherlands of the [[Canadian-American League]] and later that year, the [[Middle Atlantic League]]'s [[Springfield Indians]]. In 75 games with the Netherlands he recorded a .312 [[batting average]]. The following season he played 80 games with Springfield, and hit .293, and then joined the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] of the [[Southern Association]], where Lemon hit .309. He spent the next two seasons at the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] level with the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]]'s [[Wilkes-Barre Barons (baseball)|Wilkes-Barre Barons]] as he hit .255 in 1940 and .301 in 1941. In his final stint in the minors, Lemon hit .268 with 21 home runs for the 1942 [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] of the [[International League]].<ref name="Minors">{{cite web|title=Bob Lemon Minor League Statistics & History|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=31 August 2012|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=lemon-001rob}}</ref>

Lemon was the Indians' [[center fielder]] for [[Opening Day]] in 1946. On April 30, Indians pitcher [[Bob Feller]] [[no-hitter|no-hit]] the [[New York Yankees]]; Feller later wrote that Lemon's "daring catch" and "throwing to and doubling a man off second base" were key in "saving my" no-hitter.<ref name="Feller">{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=_dDJLRusmv4C&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=bob+lemon&source=bl&ots=HBU8u6uwvB&sig=yjFori47m2xu0Y4u6_7haLircF0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AaxKUMu7GqiZiAePoYCYAQ&ved=0CFsQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=bob%20lemon&f=false|pages=40|title=Bob Feller's Little Black Book of Baseball Wisdom|last1=Feller|first1=Bob|last2=Rocks|first2=Burton|isbn=0-8092-9843-0|year=2001|publisher=Contemporary Books|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> By season's end, however, Lemon had entered more games as a pitcher than a utility player.<ref name="Koppett" /> Before that season, Lemon had only pitched one inning while with Oswego and another while with Wilkes-Barre.

Boudreau discussed the potential move to pitcher with Yankees catcher [[Bill Dickey]], who had also played in the Navy with Lemon.

The [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] hired him as a scout for 1967&ndash;1968. In 1976, Lemon served as pitching coach for the AL champion New York Yankees. The Yankees were owned by Cleveland-area native [[George Steinbrenner]] and they had been the chief antagonists of the Cleveland Indians during Lemon's pitching years.

====New York Yankees====
Yankees manager [[Billy Martin]] resigned on July 24, 1978, and team president [[Al Rosen]] called Lemon to offer him the vacant position. He was announced as the new manager the next day. At their 1978 Old Timers Day five days after the Martin&ndash;Lemon changeover, the Yankees divulged that Lemon would be moved in 1980 to general manager, and they said that Martin would then return as field manager. The announcement was made by public-address announcer [[Bob Sheppard]] after the Old Timers had been announced and it was accompanied by Martin's dramatic entrance from the Yankee dugout. Martin received a long standing ovation from fans. Lemon responded to his new job&mdash;and to the newspaper strike that helped calm down the atmosphere in the Yankees clubhouse&mdash;by guiding the Yankees to the {{By|1978}} pennant. The Yankees, who trailed the Red Sox by 14 games at one point in July, pulled even with the Red Sox by defeating them in a four-game September series known as the "Boston Massacre."<ref name="Gallagher" />{{rp|p.294}} The Yankees pulled ahead by three and a half games, but the Red Sox rallied to tie the Yanks by the final day of the season. A one-game playoff would determine the AL Eastern Division winner.

Guidry was able to pitch "because of Lemon's good planning."<ref name="Gallagher" />{{rp|p.295}} The Yankees defeated Boston for the division title in the [[1978 American League East tie-breaker game|tie-breaker game]], punctuated both by a dramatic three-run home run by [[Bucky Dent]] in the seventh inning, and an eighth-inning homer by [[Reggie Jackson]] that proved the game's winning run.

==Death==
Lemon suffered a stroke in his later years.<ref name="Recognize" /> Lemon died in 2000 in [[Long Beach, California]], where he had been a permanent resident since his career as a player. Former teammate Bob Feller said, "Bob had a good curve, a good slider, and a vicious sinker pitch. He wasn't overly fast, but he always stayed ahead of the hitters and he didn't walk many batters, which is the key to success in the majors. When Bob passed away in 2000, it saddened me deeply."<ref name="Feller" />
