The '''Port of Albany-Rensselaer''', widely known as the '''Port of Albany''', is a major [[port]] operating year-round on both sides of the [[Hudson River]] within [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]], [[New York]]. The name Port of Albany-Rensselaer came into use in 1925, though separate private and public port facilities have existed in both cities since the 17th century.<ref name=Colonial/>  The [[Port of Albany-Rensselaer#History|Albany Basin]] and [[Erie Canal]] were both constructed with public funds in 1825 leading to a huge boost in the shipping industry.<ref name=Welfare/><ref name=Treasury/> The current port location was constructed in 1932 under [[Governor]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<ref name=Guide/> Public and private facilities not owned by the Port of Albany continue to exist in both cities, though they tend to be recreational and non-commercial. In 2004 it was the second busiest port in the state of New York by annual tonnage and 66th in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web | title = AAPA 2004 Port Cargo Tonnage Rankings.| publisher = [[American Association of Port Authorities]] | access date = 2008-11-30 | url = http://www.aapa-ports.org/files/Statistics/2004%5FUS%5FPORT%5FCARGO%5FTONNAGE%5FRANKINGS.xls}}</ref>

==Geography==
The Port of Albany consists of roughly {{convert|236|acre|ha}}, of which approximately 202 acres (82 ha) is in Albany and 34 acres (14 ha) in Rensselaer. It is 124&nbsp;[[nautical miles]] north of [[New York Harbor]].<ref name=Facilities>{{cite web | title = Port facilities.| publisher = Albany Port District | access date = 2008-11-30 | url = http://www.portofalbany.com/pages03/facilities.html}}</ref> From New York Harbor to the [[Federal Dam (Troy)|Federal Dam]] three miles north of Albany, the Hudson River is an [[estuary]] of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Jeffrey S.

==History==
Since the founding of Albany in 1624 as a trading post,<ref>{{cite web | title = Visitors-The Official Site of the City of Albany, NY. | publisher = City of Albany | access date = 2009-01-02 | url = http://www.albanyny.org/Visitors.aspx}}</ref> shipping has been important to its growth and prosperity. Furs (especially beaver), timber, and farm produce were important exports while European people and goods were shipped in. The Dongan Charter, which established Albany as a city, made Albany the exclusive market town in the upper [[Hudson River Valley]]. From its beginning the port consisted of hastily-built docks built every spring and destroyed every winter by erosion, flooding, ice, and tidal action.<ref name=Colonial>{{cite web | author = Stefan Bielinski | title = River People in Early Albany: 1686-1800 | publisher = New York State Museum and the Colonial Albany Project | access date = 2009-01-11 | url = http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/art/art-rpea.html}}</ref> Three city-owned [[dock (maritime)|docks]] were established in 1766,<ref>{{cite web | title = Collections on the History of Albany: Volume 1 | author = Joel Munsell | page = 166 | year = 1865 | access date = 2009-01-09 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA166&dq=albany+three+docks&as_brr=1#PPP17,M1}}</ref> the northern and southern ones later being expanded into [[wharves]].[[Image:Patroon Island - Before & After.jpg|right|thumb|262px|Albany Basin and [[Erie Canal]] before 1960 on left/[[I-787]] and modern shoreline on right]]Many historically significant ships used Albany as their home port.

In 1825 a 4,300&nbsp;foot long and 80&nbsp;foot wide pier was constructed 250 feet from, and perpendicular to, Albany's shoreline.<ref name=Welfare>{{cite book | author = William J.

The basin could accommodate 1,000 canal boats and 50 steamboat moorings.<ref name=Welfare/> Along the Erie Canal within the city's North Albany neighborhood private wharves and [[slipways|slips]] were constructed for use in the lumber trade, this soon became a large and prosperous lumber district of local and state importance. In 1860 Albany, along with nearby [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]] and [[Troy, New York|Troy]], was the largest lumber market in the state.<ref>{{cite web | title = Gazeteer of Albany, NY | author = J.

</ref> A Master Plan adopted in 2000 called for the port to be transformed into a [[container port]],<ref name=Comptroller/> which led to the purchase of the largest harbor crane in the state. In 2002 the Port District Commission took the lead in the development of Albany's Riverfront Park in the Corning Preserve as part of a development to enhance Albany's access to the river. The port helped in financing the project and in the construction of two bulkheads which have seasonal floating docks attached.<ref>{{cite web | title = Waterfront Development | publisher = Albany Port District | access date = 2009-01-10 | url = http://www.portofalbany.com/pages03/waterfront.html}}</ref> In a 2005 audit the [[New York State Comptroller|Office of the State Comptroller]] questioned the port's involvement in the construction and financing. Two issues raised were the port district's lack of authority to build docks for non-commercial use and that the port would receive no income for facilities it was financing.<ref name=Comptroller/> The port received $3.3&nbsp;million in 2002 to upgrade and become a member of the [[Inland Distribution Network]], a select group of ports that are used as satellite locations for the distribution of container cargo from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, resulting in less congestion at [[Downstate New York|downstate]] ports and highways.<ref>{{cite web | title = Port of Albany to Get $3.3 M for Container Barge Service. | date = December 13, 2002 | publisher = Maritime News and Engineering Reports | access date = 2008-12-02 | url = http://www.marinelink.com/Story/Port+of+Albany+to+Get+$3.3M+for+Container+Barge+Service-10198.html}}</ref>

On December 9, 2003 the Stellamare, a Dutch owned ship, [[capsize]]d at the port, killing three Russian crewmembers. The Stellamare was hauling [[General Electric]] generators when it overturned. The [[United States Coast Guard]] determined that poor communication resulting from the supervisors speaking Dutch while the crew spoke Russian, with English being as a relay, was a contributing factor to mismanagement of [[ballast tanks]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Claims settled in deadly Stellamare capsizing. | publisher = Albany Times Union | access date = 2008-09-08 | url = http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=747508&category=ALBANY&BCCode=&newsdate=12/8/2008}}</ref> In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper.<ref>{{cite web | author = David Filkins | title = Albany man charged in copper theft | date = April 8, 2008 | publisher = ''Albany Times Union'' | access date = 2008-12-23 | url = http://www.iowacoldcases.com/copper_theft_epidemic.html}}</ref> This in turn led to investigations of employee theft which resulted in the arrest of an operations manager and a maintenance foreman for larceny.<ref>{{cite web | title = Albany's port head leaving | publisher = ''Albany Times Union'' | date = June 2, 2008 | access date = 2008-12-23 | url = http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=692907&category=&BCCode=&newsdate=6/2/2008}}</ref> In 2008 the port received two awards from the Railway Industrial Clearance Association.

In late March 2008 a proposal for a $350 million ethanol plant was approved by the Albany Port District Commission,<ref>{{cite web | title = $350M ethanol plant planned for Port of Albany.| publisher = [[The Business Review]] (Albany) | access date = 2008-11-30 | url = http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2008/03/31/daily15.html}}</ref> but the project has been held up due to financing issues.

==Governance==
The Albany Port District Commission is a public benefit corporation created by the state of New York to develop and manage port facilities anywhere in the cities of Albany and Rensselaer. The commission has five members, four of which are nominated by the mayor of Albany and one is nominated by the mayor of Rensselaer. The governor of New York then appoints them to three year terms.<ref name=Law/> The commissioners serve without pay, but are compensated for business related expenses.<ref name=Comptroller/> The commission is considered to be a unit of the city of Albany and is included in the city's financial statements. Any deficit in the finances of the commission are assessed against both Albany and Rensselaer. In 1932 the state decided that any deficit assessment would be based on Albany owing 88% of the total and Rensselaer 12%.<ref name=Tonnage/> In 2005 the commission had a staff of 35 employees; eight in administrative duties, five in maintenance, and 22 as part-time security.<ref name=Comptroller>{{cite web | title = Internal Controls Over Financial Operations Report: 2005 | publisher = Office of the State Comptroller, State of New York | access date = 2009-01-10 | url = http://www2.osc.state.ny.us/audits/allaudits/093006/05s47.pdf}}</ref>

==Economy==
The Port of Albany and the private companies located there bring to the [[Capital District]]'s economy $428 million in direct spending and 1,382 jobs.<ref name=Thriving/> The port has a [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|U.S. Customs]] office as it is a [[port of entry]]. The Albany Port Customs District includes all of the following counties: [[Albany County, New York|Albany]], [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia]], [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware]], [[Fulton County, New York|Fulton]], [[Greene County, New York|Greene]], [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]], [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego]], [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]], [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]], [[Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]], [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie]], [[Warren County, New York|Warren]], and [[Washington County, New York|Washington]]; along with the parts of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]], [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]], and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties north of 41<U+00B0>&nbsp;42'&nbsp;N.&nbsp;latitude.

==Connections==
The Port of Albany is roughly 260&nbsp;miles east of Buffalo, 225&nbsp;miles south of [[Montreal]], 175&nbsp;miles west of [[Boston]], and 135&nbsp;miles north of the city of [[New York City|New York]] which makes it a location for regional distribution in the [[Northeastern United States]] and parts of [[Canada]]. As part of the Inland Distribution Network, the Port of Albany has a twice-weekly barge service to and from the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] terminals. Shipments into the port can leave through many modes of transportation, including by truck and rail. [[Albany International Airport]] is 15&nbsp;minutes away with cargo facilities. Canals allow for further water transportation on barges further into the interior of [[North America]]. The port also handles commodities that are not carried on ships. Grain, molasses, animal feed, wood pulp, and steel often go from inbound trains to outbound trucks.<ref name=Multimodal/>

===Rail===
