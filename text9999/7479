==History==
===The beginning===
This station began broadcasting in 1950 as a daytime-only facility with 250 [[watt]]s of power on a frequency of 1050 [[kHz]] as '''KVAS'''.<ref name="bc51">{{cite book |date=1951 |title=Broadcasting-Telecasting 1951 Yearbook |chapter=Directory of AM, FM, and TV Stations of the United States |publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc |location=Washington, DC |page=255}}</ref>  The station's original license holder, Clatsop Video Broadcasters, was owned in partnership by Leroy E. "Ed" Parsons, E.W. Littlehales, and J.W. Spencer.<ref name="bc51"/>  A year earlier, Parsons had created the first [[cable television]] system in the United States and he is acknowledged as the "father of [[Cable television in the United States#History and regulation|community antenna television]]".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=The Cable Center |title=Leroy E.

KVAS moved to the current 1230 khz frequency in February 1952 and the shift permitted them to begin 24-hour operation at the 250 watt power level.<ref name="bc52">{{cite book |title=1952 Broadcasting Yearbook |date=1952 |page=238 |chapter=Directory of the AM and FM stations of the United States |publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc |location=Washington, DC}}</ref>  The partners had the [[broadcast license]] transferred to a new company, KVAS, Inc., but it was unable to overcome the financial difficulties it faced.<ref name="bc53">{{cite book |date=1953 |title=1953 Broadcasting Yearbook |chapter=Directory of the AM and FM stations of the United States |publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc |location=Washington, DC |page=244}}</ref>  The station was transferred to William Ohlmann acting as receiver for KVAS, Inc., and in January 1954 he sold it to owners on more solid financial footing.<ref name="bc54">{{cite book |date=1954 |title=1954 Broadcasting Yearbook |publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc |page=264 |chapter=Directory of the AM and FM stations of the United States |location=Washington, DC}}</ref>
