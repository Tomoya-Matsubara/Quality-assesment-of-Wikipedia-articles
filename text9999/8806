The '''humpback whale''' (''Megaptera novaeangliae'') is a species of [[baleen whale|baleen]] [[whale]]. One of the larger [[rorqual]] species, adults range in length from {{convert|12|-|16|m|ft}} and weigh approximately {{convert|36000|kg|lb}}. The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with unusually long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is an acrobatic animal, often [[Whale surfacing behaviour|breaching]] and slapping the water. Males produce a complex [[Whale sounds|song]], which lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and is repeated for hours at a time. The purpose of the song is not yet clear, although it appears to have a role in mating.

Found in [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s around the world, humpback whales typically [[animal migration|migrate]] up to {{convert|25000|km|mi}} each year. Humpbacks feed only in summer, in [[Polar region|polar]] waters, and migrate to [[tropics|tropical]] or [[sub-tropical]] waters to breed and give birth in the winter. During the winter, humpbacks [[Fasting|fast]] and live off their [[Blubber|fat]] reserves. The species' diet consists mostly of [[krill]] and small [[fish]]. Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the bubble net feeding technique.

Like other large whales, the humpback was and is a target for the [[whaling]] industry. Due to over-hunting, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a whaling moratorium was introduced in 1966. Stocks have since partially recovered; however, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and noise pollution also remain concerns. There are at least 80,000 humpback whales worldwide. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, humpbacks are now sought by [[whale watching|whale-watchers]], particularly off parts of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], South America, [[Canada]], and the United States.

Humpback whales are [[rorqual]]s (family [[Balaenopteridae]]), a family that includes the [[blue whale]], the [[fin whale]], the [[Bryde's whale]], the [[sei whale]] and the [[minke whale]]. The rorquals are believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder [[Mysticeti]] as long ago as the middle [[Miocene]].<ref name="evolution">{{cite book <!--

Though clearly related to the giant whales of the [[genus]] ''[[Balaenoptera]]'', the humpback has been the sole member of its genus since [[John Edward Gray|Gray]]'s work in 1846. More recently though, DNA sequencing analysis has indicated the Humpback is more closely related to certain rorquals, particularly the [[fin whale]] (''Balaenoptera physalus''), and possibly to the [[gray whale]] (''Eschrichtius robustus''), than it is to rorquals such as the [[minke whale]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

The humpback whale was first identified as "''baleine de la Nouvelle Angleterre''" by [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson]] in his ''[[Regnum Animale]]'' of 1756. In 1781, [[Georg Heinrich Borowski]] described the species, converting Brisson's name to its [[Latin]] equivalent, ''Balaena novaeangliae''. Early in the 19th century [[Bernard Germain de Lac<U+00E9>p<U+00E8>de|Lac<U+00E9>p<U+00E8>de]] shifted the humpback from the [[Balaenidae]] family, renaming it ''Balaenoptera jubartes''. In 1846, [[John Edward Gray]] created the genus ''Megaptera'', classifying the humpback as ''Megaptera longpinna'', but in 1932, [[Remington Kellogg]] reverted the species names to use Borowski's ''novaeangliae''.<ref name="WJ">{{cite book

A humpback whales can easily be identified by its stocky body with an obvious hump and black [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] coloring. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called [[tubercle (anatomy)|tubercle]]s, which are actually [[hair follicle]]s, and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which it lifts above the surface in some dive sequences, has wavy trailing edges.<ref name="plan">{{Cite book| title = Recovery Plan for the Humpback Whale (''Megapten Novaeangliae'')

The two most enduring mention the higher maneuverability afforded by long fins, and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates. Humpbacks also have '[[rete mirable]]', a heat exchanging system, which works similarly in humpbacks, sharks and other fish.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[Image:Humpback_whale_fluke_(2).jpg|right|thumb|A tail from a different individual - the tail of each humpback whale is visibly unique.|alt=Photo of vertical humpback displaying only white tail underside and rear body segment]]
Humpbacks have 270 to 400 darkly coloured [[baleen]] plates on each side of the mouth. The plates measure from a mere {{convert|18|in|cm}} in the front to approximately {{convert|3|ft|m}} long in the back, behind the hinge. [[Ventral]] grooves run from the lower jaw to the [[Navel|umbilicus]] about halfway along the underside of the whale. These grooves are less numerous (usually 16<U+2013>20) and consequently more prominent than in other [[rorqual]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The stubby [[dorsal fin]] is visible soon after the [[Blowhole (biology)|blow]] when the whale surfaces, but disappears by the time the flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a {{convert|3|m}} heart-shaped to bushy blow, or exhalation of water through the blowholes. Because Humpback Whales breathe voluntarily, researchers{{who|date=December 2010}} have said that it is possible that the whales shut off only half of the brain when sleeping. Early whalers also noted blows from humpback adults to be {{convert|10|-|20|ft}} high.

Newborn calves are roughly the length of their mother's head. At birth, calves measure {{convert|20|ft|m}} at {{convert|2|ST|MT|lk=on}} The mother, by comparison, is about {{convert|50|ft|m}}. They nurse for approximately six months, then mix nursing and independent feeding for possibly six months more. Humpback milk is 50% fat and pink in color. Some calves have been observed alone after arrival in [[Alaska]]n waters.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Females reach sexual maturity at the age of five, achieving full adult size a little later. Males reach sexual maturity at approximately 7 years of age. The humpback whale lifespan ranges from 45<U+2013>100 years.<ref>Dawes 2008, p.291</ref>

Fully grown, the males average {{convert|15|-|16|m}}. Females are slightly larger at {{convert|16|-|17|m}}, and {{convert|40000|kg|short ton}}; the largest recorded specimen was {{convert|19|m|ft}} long and had pectoral fins measuring {{convert|6|m|ft}} each.<ref name=Clapham>Clapham 2002, p.589<U+2013>592</ref>

Females have a ''hemispherical lobe'' about {{convert|15|cm|in}} in diameter in their genital region. This visually distinguishes males and females. The male's penis usually remains hidden in the genital slit. Male whales have distinctive scars on heads and bodies, some resulting from battles over females.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Identifying individuals===
The varying patterns on the tail flukes are sufficient to identify individuals. Unique visual identification is not currently possible in most cetacean species (other exceptions include [[orca]]s and [[right whale]]s), making the humpback a popular study species.{{fact|date=November 2011}} A study using data from 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates, and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the [[mark-release-recapture]] technique (Katona and Beard 1982). A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is currently maintained by [[College of the Atlantic]].<ref>{{cite web

==Life history==
===Reproduction===
Females typically breed every two or three years. The gestation period is 11.5 months, yet some individuals have been known to breed in two consecutive years.  The peak months for birth are January, February, July, and August.  There is usually a 1-2 year period between humpback births.  Humpback whales were thought to live 50<U+2013>60 years, but new studies using the changes in amino acids behind eye lenses proved another baleen whale, the [[Bowhead whale|bowhead]], to be 211 years old. This animal was taken by the [[Inuit]] off Alaska.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Recent research on humpback [[mitochondrial DNA]] reveals that groups that live in proximity to each other may represent distinct breeding pools.<ref name=hotz>

===Social structure===
[[Image:Humpback stellwagen edit.jpg|right|thumb|Humpbacks frequently breach, throwing two thirds or more of their bodies out of the water and splashing down on their backs.|alt=Photo of humpback in profile with most of its body out of the water, with back forming acute angle to water]]
[[File:Jubartes em Abrolhos.jpg|thumb|left|A humpback in the waters of the [[Abrolhos Archipelago]]]]
{{See also|Whale surfacing behaviour}}
The humpback social structure is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live alone or in small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. These whales are not excessively social in most cases. Groups may stay together a little longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. It is possible that some females retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. The humpback's range overlaps considerably with other [[whale]] and [[dolphin]] species <U+2014> for instance, the [[minke whale]]. However, humpbacks rarely interact socially with them, though humpback calves in [[Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary|Hawaiian waters]] sometimes play with [[bottlenose dolphin]] calves.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Courtship===
[[Courtship]] rituals take place during the winter months, following migration toward the equator from summer feeding grounds closer to the poles. Competition is usually fierce, and unrelated males dubbed ''escorts'' by researcher [[Louis Herman]] frequently trail females as well as mother-calf dyads. Groups of two to twenty males gather around a single female and exhibit a variety of behaviors over several hours to establish dominance of what is known as a ''competitive group''. Group size ebbs and flows as unsuccessful males retreat and others arrive to try their luck. Behaviors include breaching, [[spyhopping]], [[lob-tailing]], [[tail-slapping]], fin-slapping, [[peduncle throws]], charging and parrying. Less common "super pods" may number more than 40 males, all vying for the same female. (M. Ferrari et al.)

Whale song is assumed to have an important role in mate selection; however, scientists remain unsure whether song is used between males to establish identity and dominance, between a male and a female as a mating call, or both.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

===Song===
{{Main|Whale song}}

[[Image:HumBack2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Spectrogram]] of Humpback Whale vocalizations. Detail is shown for the first 24 seconds of the 37-second recording "Singing Humpbacks". The ethereal whale "songs" and echolocation "clicks" are visible as horizontal striations and vertical sweeps respectively. Spectrogram generated with Fatpigdog's PC based [http://www.fatpigdog.com/SpectrumAnalyzer/ Real Time FFT Spectrum Analyzer]. {{Listen|filename=Humpbackwhale2.ogg|title=Singing Humpbacks|description=Recording of Humpback Whales singing and Clicking.|format=[[Ogg]]}}]] Both male and female humpback whales ''vocalize'', however only males produce the long, loud, complex "songs" for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a low [[register (music)|register]] that vary in [[amplitude]] and [[frequency]], and typically lasts from 10 to 20 minutes.<ref name="asc"/> Humpbacks may sing continuously for more than 24 hours. [[Cetacean]]s have no vocal cords, so whales generate their song by forcing air through their massive nasal cavities.

Whales within a large area sing the same song. All North Atlantic humpbacks sing the same song, and those of the North Pacific sing a different song. Each population's song changes slowly over a period of years without repeating.<ref name="asc"/>

Scientists are unsure of the purpose of whale song. Only males sing, suggesting that one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, and results in conflict. Singing may therefore be a challenge to other males.<ref>{{cite web

All these behaviors also occur absent potential mates. This indicates that they are probably a more general communication tool. Scientists hypothesize that singing may keep migrating populations connected. (Ferrari, Nicklin, Darling, et al.) Some observers report that singing begins when competition for a female ends.<ref>www.whaletrust.com</ref>

Humpback whales have also been found to make a range of other social sounds to communicate such as "grunts", "groans", "thwops", "snorts" and "barks".<ref>Cecilia Burke, '[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/a-whales-varied-vocabulary.htm 'A whale's varied vocabulary', Australian Geographic], AG Online.

Humpbacks inhabit all major oceans, in a wide band running from the Antarctic ice edge to 77<U+00B0> N [[latitude]], though not in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] or the [[Baltic Sea]].

Humpbacks are migratory, spending summers in cooler, high-latitude waters and mating and calving in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] waters.<ref name="asc">{{cite web

==Whaling==
{{Main|Whaling}}
{{See also|Whaling in Japan}}
One of the first attempts to hunt humpbacks was made by [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]] in 1614 off the coast of [[Maine]]. Opportunistic hunting is likely to have occurred long before. By the 18th century, they had become a common target for whalers.

By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean, and to a lesser extent in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and Pacific Oceans. It was, however, the late 19th century introduction of the [[explosive harpoon]] that allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the [[Antarctic Ocean]] beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations.

It is estimated that during the 20th century, at least 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%, with North Atlantic populations estimated to have dropped to as low as 700 individuals.<ref name=breiwick>Breiwick JM, Mitchell E, Reeves RR (1983) Simulated population trajectories for northwest Atlantic humpback whales 1865<U+2013>1980. ''Fifth biennial Conference on Biology of Marine Mammals, Boston'' Abstract. p14</ref>
In 1946, the International Whaling Commission was founded to oversee the whaling industry.  They imposed rules and regulations for hunting whales and set open and closed hunting seasons.
To prevent [[extinction]], the [[International Whaling Commission]] banned commercial humpback whaling in 1966. By that time the population had been reduced to around 5,000.<ref>{{cite journal

As of 2004, hunting of humpback whales is restricted to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island [[Bequia]] in the nation of [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]].<ref name="Recplan91"/> The take is not believed to threaten the local population.

Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its [[Institute for Cetacean Research|JARPA II]] research program, starting in November 2007. The announcement sparked global protests.<ref name="scoop">scoop.co.nz: [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0705/S00320.htm Leave Humpback Whales Alone Message To Japan] 16 May 2007</ref>
After a visit to Tokyo by the chairman of the IWC, asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and anti-whaling nations on the Commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed that no humpback whales would be caught for the two years it would take for the IWC to reach a formal agreement.<ref>{{cite news

The United States is considering listing separate humpback populations, so that smaller groups, such as North Pacific humpbacks, which are estimated to number 18,000-20,000 animals, might be delisted. This is made difficult by humpback's extraordinary migrations, which can extend the {{convert|5157|mi|km}} from [[Antarctica]] to [[Costa Rica]].<ref name=hotz/>

==Whale-watching==
{{Main|Whale watching}}
[[File:MauiActivities&Tours.jpg|thumb|Humpback near [[Maui, HI]]]]

Humpback whales are generally curious about objects in their environment. Some individuals, referred to as "friendlies", approach whale-watching boats closely, often staying under or near the boat for many minutes. Because humpbacks are often easily approachable, curious, easily identifiable as individuals, and display many behaviors, they have become the mainstay of [[whale-watching]] tourism in many locations around the world. Hawaii has used the concept of "eco tourism" to use the species without killing them. This whale watching business attracts 1 million visitors a year, which results in a profit of $80 million.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

There are many commercial whale-watching operations on both the humpback's summer and winter ranges:{{fact|date=November 2011}}

As with other cetacean species, however, a mother whale is generally extremely protective of her infant, and places herself between any boat and her calf before moving quickly away from the vessel. Skilled tour operators avoid stressing the mother.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

==Famous humpbacks==
===Migaloo===
A presumably [[albino]] humpback whale that travels up and down the east coast of Australia has become famous in the local media, on account of its extremely rare all-white appearance. Migaloo is the only known all-white humpback whale in the world.<ref>{{cite news
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8126237.stm
|title=Exclusion zone for special whale
|date=2009-06-30
|publisher=BBC News
|accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref> First sighted in 1991 and believed to be 3<U+2013>5 years old at that time, Migaloo is a word for "white fella" from one of the languages of the Aboriginals, the [[Indigenous Australians]]. Speculation about Migaloo's sex was resolved in October 2004 when researchers from Southern Cross University collected sloughed skin samples from Migaloo as he migrated past Lennox Head, and subsequent genetic analysis of the samples proved he is a male. Because of the intense interest, environmentalists feared that he was becoming distressed by the number of boats following him each day. In response, the Queensland and New South Wales governments introduce legislation each year to create a 500&nbsp;m (1600&nbsp;ft) exclusion zone around the whale. Recent close up pictures have shown Migaloo to have skin cancer and/or skin cysts as a result of his lack of protection from the sun.<ref>{{cite web

One of the most notable humpback whales is Humphrey the Whale, twice-rescued by [[The Marine Mammal Center]] and other concerned groups in [[California]].<ref>Tokuda W (1992) ''Humphrey the lost whale'', Heian Intl Publishing Company. ISBN 0-89346-346-9</ref><ref>Callenbach E & Leefeldt C ''Humphrey the Wayward Whale'', ISBN 0-930588-23-1</ref> In 1985, Humphrey swam into [[San Francisco Bay]] and then up the [[Sacramento River]] towards [[Rio Vista, California|Rio Vista]].<ref>Jane Kay, ''San Francisco Examiner'' Monday, 9 October 1995</ref> Five years later, Humphrey returned and became stuck on a [[bay mud|mudflat]] in San Francisco Bay immediately north of [[Sierra Point, Brisbane, California|Sierra Point]] below the view of onlookers from the upper floors of the [[Dakin Building]]. He was pulled off the mudflat with a large [[cargo net]] and the help of the Coast Guard. Both times he was successfully guided back to the Pacific Ocean using a "sound net" in which people in a flotilla of boats made unpleasant noises behind the whale by banging on steel pipes, a Japanese fishing technique known as "oikami." At the same time, the attractive sounds of humpback whales preparing to feed were broadcast from a boat headed towards the open ocean.<ref>Toni Knapp, ''The Six Bridges of Humphrey the Whale''. Illustrated by Craig Brown. Roberts Rinehart, 1993 (1989)</ref> Since leaving the San Francisco Bay in 1990 Humphrey has been seen only once, at the [[Farallon Islands]] in 1991.
