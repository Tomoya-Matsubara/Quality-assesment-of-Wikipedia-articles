'''Mark John Thompson''' (born 31 July 1957)<ref name=WW><U+201C>THOMPSON, Mark John Thompson,<U+201D> in ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who 2009]]'' (London: [[A & C Black]], 2008); online ed., (Oxford: OUP, 2008), [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U37546] (accessed January 25, 2009).</ref> is [[Director-General of the BBC|Director-General]] of the [[BBC]], a post he has held since 2004, and a former [[Chief executive officer|chief executive]] of [[Channel 4]].  He is the highest paid employee of any public-sector organisation in the UK earning between <U+00A3>800,000 and <U+00A3>900,000 per year.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11333472 Public Sector pay: The numbers] ''[[BBC News]]'', 20 September 2010</ref> 

Thompson was born in [[London]] and brought up in [[Welwyn Garden City]], [[Hertfordshire]],<ref name=Beliefs>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/dec/16/channel4.broadcasting|title=The Observer Profile | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Arlidge | date=16 December 2001 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> by his mother, Sydney Corduff, his sister, Katherine, and father, Duncan John Thompson. He was educated by [[Jesuits]] at the independent school [[Stonyhurst College]], and from there went up to [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], [[Oxford]], where he took a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first]] in [[English literature|English]].<ref name=WW/> He edited the university magazine ''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]''.<ref name=NS>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=NS Profile - Mark Thompson |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200405030021 |work=[[New Statesman]] |publisher= |date=3 May 2004 |accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref>

==Appointment as Director-General==
Thompson was appointed Director-General on 21 May 2004.<ref name=Bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/executives/markthompson.shtml|title=BBC Press Office: Biographies - Mark Thompson|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> He succeeded [[Greg Dyke]], who resigned on 29 January 2004 in the aftermath of the [[Hutton Inquiry]]. Although he had originally stated he was not interested in the role of Director-General and would turn down any approach from the BBC, he changed his mind, saying the job was a "one-of-a-kind opportunity". The decision to appoint Thompson Director-General was made unanimously by the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|BBC Board of Governors]], headed by the then new Chairman [[Michael Grade]] (another former chief executive of Channel 4). His appointment was widely praised: [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Tessa Jowell]], Shadow Culture Secretary [[Julie Kirkbride]] and [[Greg Dyke]] were amongst those who supported his selection. He took up the role of Director-General on 22 June 2004<ref name=Bio/> ([[Mark Byford]] had been Acting Director-General since Dyke's resignation). On his first day he announced several management changes, including the replacement of the BBC's sixteen-person executive committee with a slimmed-down executive board of nine top managers.

==Editorial guideline breaches==

In 2007 it emerged that the BBC had been involved in a number of editorial guideline breaches. Mark Thompson, as BBC editor-in-chief investigated these breaches, and presented his interim report to the [[BBC Trust]] on 18 July 2007.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/about/minutes/18_July07.pdf Minutes of Trust meeting 18 July 2007]</ref> The Trust felt that the BBC<U+2019>s values of accuracy and honesty had been compromised, and Thompson outlined to the Trust the actions he would take to restore confidence.

Later that day he told BBC staff, via an internal televised message,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6905158.stm Key points: Thompson speech to staff on editorial breaches]</ref> that deception of the public was never acceptable. He said that he, himself, had never deceived the public - it would never have occurred to him to do so, and that he was sure that the same applied to the "overwhelming majority" of BBC staff. He also spoke on [[BBC News 24]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6900000/newsid_6905200/6905245.stm?bw=bb&mp=wm&news=1&nol_storyid=6905245&bbcws=1# News 24 interview on editorial guideline breaches (video)]</ref> and was interviewed by [[Gavin Esler]] for [[Newsnight]]. He stated that "from now on, if it [deceiving the public] happens we will show people the door."<ref>[http://newsarchive.awardspace.com/mark_thompson_18_july_2007.html Transcript of Newsnight interview on editorial breaches and staff honesty]</ref> Staff were emailed on 19 July 2007<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/07_july/19/email.shtml Email from Mark Thompson to BBC staff on integrity]</ref> and later in the year all staff, including the Director-General undertook a Safeguarding Trust course.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/25/nbbc125.xml BBC to teach its stars honesty] [[Daily Telegraph]] retrieved 8 March 2008</ref>

In October 2008, Thompson had to cut short a family holiday to return to Britain to deal with the [[Russell Brand Show prank telephone calls row]].  Thompson took the executive decision to suspend the BBC<U+2019>s highest paid presenter, [[Jonathan Ross]], from all his BBC work for three months without pay.  He also said it was the controversial star<U+2019>s last warning.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7700816.stm Ross suspended for three months]</ref>
Nevertheless, Thompson reiterated the BBC<U+2019>s commitment to Ross<U+2019> style of edgy comedy, claiming that <U+201C>BBC audiences accept that, in comedy, performers attempt to push the line of taste<U+201D>.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/response/2008/10/081027_res_russellbrand_radio2_andrewsachs.shtml Russell Brand programme, BBC Radio 2, 18 October 2008]</ref>
Thompson had previously defended the star<U+2019>s conduct and salary in 2006, when he described Ross as <U+201C>outstanding<U+201D> and claimed that "the very best people" deserved appropriately high salaries.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5159328.stm BBC defends Ross pay and conduct]</ref>

==Controversy==
===Programme production===
In late 2007, Thompson's directorship at the BBC was criticised.  [[Sir Richard Eyre]], former artistic director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], accused the BBC under Thompson's leadership failing to produce programmes 'that inspired viewers to visit galleries, museums or theatres'.<ref name=Eyre>{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/news/story/0,,2220530,00.html|title=The Guardian: Arts chief warns of cultural 'apartheid'|accessdate=2007-09-12 | location=London | first=Anushka | last=Asthana}}</ref>  He was also criticised by [[Tony Palmer]], a multi-award winning film-maker.  Of the BBC, Palmer stated that "[it] has a worldwide reputation which it has abrogated and that's shameful. In the end, the buck stops with Mark Thompson. He is a catastrophe."<ref name=Palmer>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/dec/09/bbc.tvnews|title=The Guardian: Director blasts 'BBC ignorance'|accessdate=2007-09-12 | location=London | first=David | last=Smith}}</ref>

===Jerry Springer: The Opera===
He was severely criticised in relation to the broadcast of ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'', with a private prosecution brought against the BBC for blasphemy. [[David Pannick]] QC appeared and won the case for [[BBC]] director-general Mark Thompson. The High Court ruled that the cult musical was not blasphemous, and Pannick stated that: "Judge Tubbs had acted within her powers and made the only decision she could lawfully have made; while religious beliefs were integral to British society, so is freedom of expression, especially to matters of social and moral importance."<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/05/njerry105.xml  telegraph.co.uk, Jerry Springer play ruled not blasphemous]</ref>

===Accusations of Pro-Israeli editorial stance===
A number of commentators have suggested that Thompson has a pro-Israeli editorial stance, particularly since he supported the controversial decision by the BBC not to broadcast the [[BBC controversies#2009: Gaza DEC Appeal|DEC Gaza appeal]] in January 2009.<ref name="BBC and the Gaza appeal">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/mark_thompson/|title=Mark Thompson's Blog}}</ref> Complaints to the BBC, numbering nearly 16,000, about the decision were directed to a statement by Thompson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/01/bbc_and_the_gaza_appeal.html|title=BBC and the Gaza appeal}}</ref>

Journalist [[Yvonne Ridley]] wrote in [[CounterPunch]] that "D-G Mark Thompson might not care much for the BBC<U+2019>s reputation but he should have a duty of care to his staff because it looks as if his pro-Israel stance is now endangering the safety of his own news teams, many of whom find his views repugnant in any case" and with respect to his 2005 meeting with [[Ariel Sharon]], wrote "Never before had any BBC Director-General embarked on such a meeting and references to it are removed continually from Thompson<U+2019>s biography on Wikipedia, an indication of just how sensitive the whole event remains." 
<ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/ridley06072010.html Whitewashing Atrocity, Why You Won't See Me on the BBC, By YVONNE RIDLEY]</ref> [[Tam Dean Burn]] wrote in [[The Herald (Glasgow)]] "I would argue that this bias has moved on apace since Thompson went to Israel in 2005 and signed a deal with prime minister Ariel Sharon on the BBC's coverage of the conflict." <ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/to-my-mind-and-it-appears-to-millions-of-others-the-bbc-is-increasingly-biased-towards-israel-in-this-conflict-1.828428 To my mind and, it appears, to millions of others, the BBC is increasingly biased towards Israel in this conflict, Heraldscotland staff]</ref> Journalist [[Muhammad Idrees Ahmad]] wrote in [[CounterPunch]] that "the BBC's director general Mark Thompson can hardly be described as a disinterested party: in 2005 he made a trip to Jerusalem where he met with Ariel Sharon in what was seen in Israel as an attempt to 'build bridges' and 'a "softening" to the corporation's unofficial editorial line on the Middle East'"<ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/idrees02032009.html The Way of Izvestia, The BBC's Nadir, By MUHAMMAD IDREES AHMAD]</ref>

===Nick Griffin===
In October 2009, Thompson defended the decision by the BBC to invite [[British National Party]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] to appear on the ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' programme following criticism by Labour politicians including [[Home Secretary]] [[Alan Johnson]] and [[Secretary of State for Wales]] [[Peter Hain]]. The decision also led to protests outside [[BBC Television Centre]] by [[Unite Against Fascism|UAF]] campaigners. Thompson said: "It is a straightforward matter of fact that <U+2026> the BNP has demonstrated a level of support which would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on ''Question Time''. It is for that reason alone <U+2026> that the invitation has been extended. The case against inviting the BNP to appear on ''Question Time'' is a case for censorship <U+2026> Democratic societies sometimes do decide that some parties and organisations are beyond the pale. As a result they proscribe them and/or ban them from the airwaves. My point is simply that the drastic steps of proscription and censorship can only be taken by government and parliament <U+2026> It is unreasonable and inconsistent to take the position that a party like the BNP is acceptable enough for the public to vote for, but not acceptable enough to appear on democratic platforms like ''Question Time''. If there is a case for censorship, it should be debated and decided in parliament. Political censorship cannot be outsourced to the BBC or anyone else."<ref>{{cite news | url=  http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/21/bbc-bnp-mark-thompson| title= BBC is right to allow BNP on Question Time, says Mark Thompson | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Robert | last=Booth | date=22 October 2009 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>

===Sale of Formula One broadcast rights===
Mark Thompson was Director General of the BBC when on the 29th July 2011 it was announced the Corporation would no longer televise all Formula One Grands Prix live, instead choosing to split the broadcast between the BBC and [[Sky Sports]]. This prompted an outcry from several thousand fans and a motion on the UK Government e-petition site. On 2 September 2011, Thompson and several "senior BBC figures" were called upon by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to answer questions over the exact nature of the broadcast arrangement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/94168 | work=Autosport | date=2 September 2011}}</ref>

===Earnings===
In January 2010, Thompson was strongly criticised over the size of his <U+00A3>834,000 pay packet, and was told by one of his own journalists that "there are huge numbers of people in the organisation who think your salary is plain wrong and corrosive."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6992387/Your-salary-is-wrong-and-corrosive-Mark-Thompson-BBC-director-general-told.html | title='Your salary is wrong and corrosive', Mark Thompson , BBC director general, told | work=The Telegraph | location=London | first=Murray | last=Wardrop | date=15 Jan 2010 | accessdate=19 July 2010}}</ref>

== Ranking ==
In 2009 Thompson was ranked as the 65th [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's Most Powerful People|most powerful person in the world]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/20/power-09_The-Worlds-Most-Powerful-People_Rank_2.html |title=The World's Most Powerful People |accessdate=November 12, 2009 |publisher=Forbes |date=11 November 2009}}</ref>
