'''Abu Musa Isa ibn al-Shaykh ibn al-Salil al-Dhuhli al-Shaybani''' (died 882/3) was an [[Arab]] leader of the [[Shayban (tribe)|Shayban]] tribe. Taking advantage of the [[Anarchy at Samarra|domestic turmoil]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], he created a virtually independent [[bedouin]] state in [[Palestine]] and southern [[Syria]] in ca. 867<U+2013>870, before an Abbasid army forced him to exchange his domains with the governorship of [[Arminiya|Armenia]] and [[Diyar Bakr]]. In Armenia, he struggled to contain the rising power of the Christian princes, but after failing to suppress the revolt of one of his own subordinates, abandoned the country and returned to his native [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]]. There he spent his last years until his death in a struggle with a rival strongman, the ruler of [[Mosul]] [[Ishaq ibn Kundajiq]].

==Life==
Isa's early life is obscure. He was a member of the [[Shayban (tribe)|Shayban]] tribe from the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], but otherwise not even the exact name of his father is known, it being variously given as al-Shaykh, Ahmad or abd al-Razzak.<ref name="EI2-88">Canard (1997), p. 88</ref> Isa first appears in 848, in the ranks of the [[Abbasid]] army under [[Bugha al-Sharabi]] that was sent against the rebel [[Muhammad ibn al-Ba'ith]] in his stronghold of [[Marand]]. Muhammad and most of his followers belonged to the [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] tribal group, the same that the Shayban were part of. Consequently Bugha employed Isa as an envoy to the rebels, and Isa managed to convince several among them to surrender.<ref name="EI2-88"/><ref name="Cobb38">Cobb (2001), p. 38</ref>

===Career in Syria and Palestine===
[[File:Droysen - Bilad al-Scham.png|thumb|Map of medieval Syria (''[[Bilad al-Sham]]'') under the early Caliphates]]
It has been suggested that Isa served as governor of [[Damascus]] in 861, but according to M. Canard this is a confusion with [[Isa ibn Muhammad al-Nawshari]]. In 865, according to [[al-Tabari]], he defeated and captured a [[Kharijite]] rebel named al-Muwaffaq.<ref name="EI2-88"/><ref name="Cobb38"/> At the time, he held a post in [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], since al-Tabari records him asking for aid from the Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] in preparing a raid against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], including four ships to be set ready in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].<ref>Canard (1997), pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref> He was probably already governor of [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]] at the time, a post which he seems to have held, according to [[Ya'qubi]], at the time of the deposition of [[al-Musta'in]] in January 866.<ref name="Cobb38"/><ref name="EI2-89">Canard (1997), p. 89</ref> According to Ya'qubi, Isa was one of the governors who refused to immediately acknowledge the new Caliph, al-Mu'tazz, perhaps because his old patron Bugha still remained loyal to al-Musta'in. This led al-Nawshari to campaign against him, and the two armies clashed by the [[Jordan River]]. Al-Nawshari's son was killed, but Isa was defeated and fled to Egypt with what wealth he could gather, while al-Nawshari occupied the capital of Palestine, [[Ramla]].<ref name="Cobb38"/><ref name="EI2-89"/> In Egypt, Isa finally conceded the oath of loyalty (''[[bay'ah]]'') to al-Mu'tazz, while al-Nawshari in his turn fell out with the Caliph, who had not sanctioned his seizure of Ramla and dispatched an army under Muhammad ibn al-Muwallad to drive him out. Isa then returned to Palestine, bringing with him money, supplies, and possibly troops recruited in Egypt, and built a fortress called al-Husami, situated between Ramla and [[Lod|Ludd]]. From this base, he managed to withstand the repeated attacks of Ibn al-Muwallad, until<U+2014>probably after a truce was agreed<U+2014>both returned to the caliphal capital, [[Samarra]].<ref name="EI2-89"/><ref>Cobb (2001), pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref>

There, in December 866, Isa secured his re-appointment to the governorship of both Palestine (''Filastin'') and the province of Jordan (''[[Jund al-Urdunn]]''). Al-Tabari attributes this to the influence of Bugha al-Dharabi, whom he bribed with 40,000 [[gold dinar]]s, while [[al-Mas'udi]] claims that this was because of the riches he brought with him from Egypt, as well as 70 [[Alids]] who had fled from the [[Hijaz]].<ref name="EI2-89"/><ref name="Cobb39">Cobb (2001), p. 39</ref> He did not immediately return to Palestine, instead sending his lieutenant Abu'l-Maghra' ibn Musa ibn Zurara there as his deputy. When he finally arrived in Ramla, Isa used the ongoing [[Anarchy at Samarra|anarchy in Iraq]] to set himself up as a virtually independent ruler. He kept the province's revenues for himself, and even intercepted the tax caravans from Egypt. He then used this money to secure the loyalty of the local Arab tribes, the Rabi'a in the north and the [[Banu Kilab]] in the south, with whom he even formed a marriage alliance, marrying a Kilabi wife. Soon, his nascent Bedouin state was strong enough that he seized Damascus itself.<ref name="EI2-89"/><ref name="Cobb39"/><ref name="Gil300">Gil (1997), p. 300</ref> 

When Caliph [[al-Muhtadi]] ascended the throne in July 869, he offered a general amnesty, and wrote to Isa, offering a pardon in exchange for him handing over the treasure he had wrongfully appropriated, according to [[al-Kindi]] amounting to a sum of 750,000 dinars. When Isa refused, the Caliph ordered the new governor of Egypt, [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], to march against him. Ibn Tulun, complied, but no sooner had he reached [[Arish]] with his army orders came to turn back. In 870, the new Caliph, [[al-Mu'tamid]], again sent envoys to Isa to persuade him to return the money, but Isa again refused, and an army under the Turk [[Amajur al-Turki]], who was named governor of Damascus. Initially based in Tyre, Isa managed to push back Amajur's numerically much inferior forces<U+2014>al-Tabari reports that Isa had 20,000 men while Amajur only 200<U+2013>400<U+2014>to Damascus, but in a battle before the city Isa's son al-Mansur fell, and he was defeated and he was forced to withdraw to Ramla. Instead of an army there came a new embassy from the Caliph (in 870 or 871), offering him the governorship of [[Arminiya|Armenia]] if he would abandon Syria. Isa agreed, and left for his new post in May 871.<ref name="EI2-89"/><ref name="Cobb39"/><ref name="Gil300"/>

===In Armenia and the Jazira===
[[File:81ArabAbbasidPeriod750-885.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Transcaucasia]] under Muslim rule: the province of Armenia<U+2013>Azerbaijan]]
The governorship of Armenia included not only [[Armenian Highland|Armenia proper]], but also [[Arran (Caucasus)|Azerbaijan]] and the [[Diyar Bakr]] in the Jazira,<ref name="EI2-89"/> the latter being the main settlement area of the Shayban and Isa's own homeland.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan (1976), pp. 25<U+2013>26, 29</ref> Soon after his appointment, Isa (called "Yise, son of <U+0160>eh" by Armenian sources) was approached by the [[Uthmanids]] and the [[Kaysites]], local dynasties of Arab emirs established around [[Lake Van]], who were threatened by the rise of the Christian Armenian ruler [[Ashot Artsruni]], prince of [[Vaspurakan]]. Ashot was preparing to besiege the Uthmanid fortress of Amiwk, when Isa assembled a league of the emirs of Armenia, and with 15,000 men came to Vaspurakan. Unable to confront these numbers, the [[Artsruni]] backed down and concluded a peace with Isa.<ref name="EI2-89"/><ref>Ter-Ghevondyan (1976), pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> 

Isa's situation in Armenia was precarious, however. Without any hope of support from the Abbasid government, Armenia was effectively left to its own devices, and the two great Christian dynasties of the Artsruni in the south and the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratids]] in the north had effectively partitioned the country and acted as independent princes. This necessitated a careful balancing act by Isa, who could not afford to alienate the various Armenian rulers, especially after his lieutenant in Azerbaijan, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahid al-Tamimi al-Yamami, rebelled in 877. Isa besieged Muhammad in the provincial capital, [[Bardha'a]], but despite receiving aid from [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot the Bagratid]] (the future [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|King of Armenia]]), after 13 months of fruitless siege he was forced to abandon it. Isa then departed Armenia altogether, returning to [[Amid]] in the Diyar Bakr. Although regarded by the Armenian and Arab historians nominally as governor of Armenia until his death in 882/3, he never again left the Jazira.<ref name="EI2-89"/><ref>Ter-Ghevondyan (1976), p. 57</ref>

[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), with its provinces, in medieval times]]
In the Jazira, he faced a major rival in the person of the Turk [[Ishaq ibn Kundajiq]], who ruled [[Mosul]] and had ambitions to govern all of the Jazira. Isa and his long-time lieutenant, Abu'l-Maghra', allied with other enemies of Ibn Kundajiq, the local Kharijites under a certain Ishaq ibn Ayyub and the [[Taghlib]]i chieftain [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]].<ref name="EI2-89"/> This coalition managed to defeat Ibn Kindajiq, but the latter's position was soon bolstered by receiving appointment by the Caliph as governor of [[Diyar Rabi'a]] and Armenia (879/80), although he never seems to have exercised any authority over the latter. The Shaybanids then offered peace on the basis of maintaining the territorial ''status quo'', and in exchange for an annual tribute of 200,000 dinars.<ref name="EI2-89"/> 

Ibn Kundajiq initially accepted, but in 880/1 the coalition against him was renewed, and open warfare broke out. This time, Ibn Kundajiq was victorious in a battle fought in April/May 881, driving his opponents before him to Amid, which he left under siege. A few inconclusive skirmishes followed, and the situation was not resolved by the time of Isa's death in 882/3, as Ibn Kundajiq became involved in the Abbasid efforts to recover Syria from the [[Tulunids]].<ref>Canard (1997), pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref> Isa was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad ibn Isa al-Shaybani|Ahmad]], who ruled the Diyar Bakr as an independent prince. Ahmad expanded his territory into southern Armenia, and, after Ibn Kundajiq's death in 891/2, occupied even Mosul. In the next year, however, the resurgent Abbasids under Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] wrested the city from him, and in 899 the rest of the family's Jaziran domains from Ahmad's heir, [[Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Shaybani|Muhammad]].<ref name="EI2-90">Canard (1997), p. 90</ref><ref>Kennedy (2004), p. 182</ref>

==Legacy==
As "rulers by usurpation" (''<U+02BF>al<U+0101> sab<U+012B>l al-taghallub''), Isa and his son Ahmad are judged harshly by contemporary Muslim historians, but according to M. Canard, "in the disturbed period in which these Mesopotamian Arabs lived, they were no worse in their behaviour than the other soldiers of fortune of the Abbasid regime".<ref name="EI2-90"/> Isa in particular had a "certain reputation for magnificence and generosity" (Canard),<ref name="EI2-90"/> and like all the Shayban, Isa and Ahmad too were esteemed for the quality of their [[Arabic poetry]].<ref>Bianquis (1997), pp. 391<U+2013>392</ref>
