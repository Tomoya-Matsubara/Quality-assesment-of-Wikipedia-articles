'''Birchington-on-Sea''' is a [[village#United Kingdom|village]] in northeast [[Kent]], [[England]], with a population of around 9,800. It is part of the [[Thanet (district)|Thanet district]] and forms the [[civil parish]] of Birchington. It lies on the coast of the [[Thames Estuary]], between the seaside resorts of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] and [[Margate]].

As a [[seaside resort]], the village is a notable tourist and retirement destination. The village's Minnis Bay is a family beach with attractions such as sailing, windsurfing, a paddling pool and coastal walking routes. Its three smaller beaches are surrounded by chalk cliffs, cliff [[stack (geology)|stacks]] and caves. 

The village was first recorded in 1240. Its parish church, All Saints, dates to the 13th century and its churchyard is the burial place of the 19th-century [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist, [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. Quex Park, a local 19th century manor house, is home to the Powell Cotton Museum of stuffed exotic animals and a twelve-bell tower built for [[change ringing]].

==History==
Birchington was first recorded in 1240 as Birchenton, a name derived from the Old English words 'bircen tun', meaning a farm where [[birch]] trees grow.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Kent place names | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/places/names/names_b.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}</ref> Archaeological evidence has shown the area was inhabited before the existence of the village: Roman and prehistoric artefacts have been discovered in the area, and Minnis Bay was once the site of an [[Iron Age]] settlement.<ref name="Old Margate">{{cite book  | title = Old Margate| last=Mirams| first=Michael| publisher = Maresborough Books| date = 1984 }}</ref>

Birchington railway station was opened in 1863 and the Railway Hotel, now the Sea View Hotel pub, was opened in 1865. Station Road was subsequently built to serve as Birchington's main shopping street. Coast Guard cottages were built at Minnis Bay in the 1870s and the first shops appeared by the bay in 1903.<ref name="Old Margate"/>

The village is built beside four sandy bays; Minnis Bay to the west, Grenham Bay and Beresford Gap towards the centre and Epple Bay to the east. The village is situated on the [[Isle of Thanet]], which was a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred years ago, when the channel in between became silted up. The area to the west of the village, between Birchington and Herne Bay, was once part of the channel and is now low-lying marshland. In the east of the village the land rises, forming chalk cliffs and cliff stacks around the beaches at Grenham Bay, Beresford Gap and Epple Bay. A sea wall stretches along the foot of the cliffs to prevent further erosion. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the [[English Channel]] broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall.<ref name="Isle of Thanet">{{cite web  | title = Isle of Thanet    | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/content/articles/2006/05/15/thanet_history_feature.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Geological Sites Map | publisher = Natureonthemap.org.uk | url = http://www.natureonthemap.org.uk/map.aspx  | accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}</ref> 

The drinking water in the village is classed as being '[[Hard water|very hard]]', having just over 120&nbsp;mg of [[calcium]] per litre. The hardness is due to water being obtained from underground chalk sources by the water company [[Southern Water]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Drinking water quality | publisher = Southern Water| url =http://www.southernwater.co.uk/homeAndLeisure/whereILive/default.asp  | accessdate = 2007-06-21 }}</ref> Waste water is discharged into the sea after being treated at a sewage works in Margate.
