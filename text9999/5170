The recorded [[history of Manchester]] began with the [[civilian]] settlement associated with the [[Castra|Roman fort]] of ''[[Mamucium]]'', which was established in [[Circa|c.]] 79 AD on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers [[River Medlock|Medlock]] and [[River Irwell|Irwell]]. Historically, Manchester was in [[Lancashire]], although areas of [[Cheshire]], south of the [[River Mersey]] were incorporated into the city during the 20th century.<ref>The first to be included, Wythenshawe, was added to the city in 1931.</ref> Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] Manchester remained a [[manorialism|manorial]] [[Township (England)|township]] but began to expand "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century. Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]],<ref name="Cotton">{{cite book|title=The Cotton Industry|last=Aspin|first=Chris|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|year=1981|isbn=0-85263-545-1|page=3}}</ref> and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city.<ref name="Industrial city">{{cite book|title=Manchester: A History| last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|publisher=Carnegie Publishing| location=Lancaster|isbn=1-85936-128-5}}<br /><U+2022> {{cite book|title=Tradition in Action.

In 1877, the [[Neo Gothic]] [[Manchester Town Hall]] was built and in 1894 the 36 mile [[Manchester Ship Canal]] opened; which at the time was the longest river navigation canal in the world, which in turn created the [[Port of Manchester]] linking the city to sea. Manchester's fortunes decreased in the subsequent years after WW2 due to [[deindustrialization]] however investment in the last two decades spurred by the [[1996 Manchester bombing]]- which was the largest bomb ever detonated in peacetime Britain- spearheaded extensive regeneration of Manchester.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Manchester}}

=== Etymology ===
The name Manchester originates from the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] name ''[[Mamucium]]'', the name of the Roman fort and settlement, generally thought to be a [[Latin]]isation of an original [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name (possibly meaning "[[breast-like hill]]" from ''mamm-'' = "breast"), with later added [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ceaster'' = "town" (which is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[castra]]'' = "camp" or "forts").<ref name="Place names">{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_Titles__2B_05|last=Mills|first=A.D.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-852758-6}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> An alternative theory suggests that the origin is [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic]] ''mamma'' = "mother", where the "mother" was a river-goddess of the [[River Medlock]] which flows below the fort. ''Mam'' means "female [[breast]]" in [[Irish Gaelic]] and "mother" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>The Antiquaries Journal (ISSN 0003-5815) 2004, vol. 84, pp. 353<U+2013>357</ref>

=== Early history ===
The [[Brigantes]] were the major [[Celtic tribes in Britain and Ireland|Celtic tribe]] in what is now [[Northern England]]; they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which [[Manchester Cathedral]] now stands, opposite the banks of the [[River Irwell]].<ref name="Cooper">{{cite book |first=Glynis |last=Cooper |title=Salford: An Illustrated History |publisher=The Breedon Books Publishing Company |year=2005 |isbn=1-85983-455-8|page=19}}</ref> Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] and [[Stretford]]. Following the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in the 1st century, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|General Agricola]] ordered the construction of a [[Castra|Roman fort]] named [[Mamucium]] in the year 79 to ensure that Roman interests in [[Deva Victrix]] ([[Chester]]) and [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) were protected from the Brigantes.<ref name="Cooper"/> Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time.<ref name="Roman">{{cite book | title=Halloween: from Pagan Ritual to Party Night| url=http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780195168969| last=Rogers| first=Nicholas| year=2003| page=18| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| isbn=0-19-516896-8}}</ref> A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the Roman fort is visible in [[Castlefield]]. The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century; the ''[[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]]'', or civilian settlement, appears to have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century, although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Richard (ed) |title=Roman Manchester: The University of Manchester's Excavations within the Vicus 2001<U+2013>5 |page=190 |publisher=Oxbow Books |year=2007 |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-84217-271-1}}</ref> By the time of the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, the focus of settlement had shifted to the confluence of the rivers Irwell and [[River Irk|Irk]].<ref name="Kidd">{{cite book|title=Manchester: A History| last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|pages= 12, 15<U+2013>24, 224|publisher=Carnegie Publishing|location=Lancaster|isbn=1-85936-128-5}}</ref> Much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent [[Harrying of the North]].<ref name="Hylton">{{cite book|title=A History of Manchester|last=Hylton|first=Stuart|year=2003|pages=1<U+2013>10, 22, 25, 42, 63<U+2013>67, 69|publisher=Phillimore & Co|isbn=1-86077-240-4}}</ref><ref name="Arrowsmith">{{cite book|title=Stockport: a History|last=Arrowsmith|first=Peter|year=1997|page=30|publisher=Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council|isbn=0-905164-99-7}}</ref>

Thomas de la Warre, [[lord of the manor]], founded and constructed a collegiate church for the [[Manchester (ancient parish)|parish]] in 1421.

During the [[English Civil War]], Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long lasting, [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] granted it the right to elect its own MP. [[Charles Worsley]], who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the [[Rule of the Major Generals]]. He was a diligent [[puritan]], turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.<ref>{{cite book | title= Cromwell's major generals: godly government during the English Revolution | series= Politics, culture, and society in early modern Britain | author=Durston, Christopher | year= 2001 | publisher=Manchester University Press | location= Manchester | isbn= 0-7190-6065-6 | url= http://books.google.com/?id=Hw622QZHTcYC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22charles+worsley%22 | accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>

Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton [[fustian]]s, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance.<ref name="Kidd"/> The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The [[Bridgewater Canal]], Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at [[Worsley]] to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton.<ref name="Kidd"/><ref name="Hartwell"/> Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns.<ref name="Kidd"/> A [[commodities exchange]], opened in 1729,<ref name="Hylton"/> and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce.

In 1780, [[Richard Arkwright]] began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill.<ref name="Hylton"/><ref name="Hartwell"/>

=== Industrial Revolution ===
[[File:McConnel & Company mills, about 1820.jpg|thumb|[[Cotton mill]]s in [[Ancoats]] about 1820]]

Manchester's history is concerned with [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]. The great majority of [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]] took place in the towns of [[Greater Manchester|south Lancashire and north Cheshire]], and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing,<ref name="GM Arch">{{cite book|author=McNeil, Robina|coauthors=Michael Nevell|title=A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of Greater Manchester|publisher=Association for Industrial Archaeology|year=2000|isbn=0-9528930-3-7}}</ref> and later the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods.<ref name="Kidd"/><ref name=Hall>{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Peter | title = Cities in Civilisation | publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-297-84219-6 | chapter = The first industrial city: Manchester 1760<U+2013>1830}}</ref> Manchester was dubbed "[[Cottonopolis]]" and "Warehouse City" during the [[Victorian era]].<ref name="GM Arch"/> In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term "manchester" is still used for household linen: sheets, pillow cases, towels, etc.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Manchester, n | encyclopaedia=Oxford English Dictionary | year=2009 | month=March | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00300853?query_type=word&queryword=manchester+goods&first=1&max_to_show=10&single=1&sort_type=alpha | accessdate=4 May 2009 | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> The industrial revolution brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchester's  population.

Manchester began expanding "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city for work from Scotland, Wales, Ireland and other areas of England as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.timelines.tv/index.php?t=0&e=12# | title = Timelines.tv Urban Slums | publisher=Timelines.tv|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/10/03/031007_migrant_history_manchester_feature.shtml|title=Manchester: migrant city|last=Schofield|first=Jonathan|work=BBC Manchester:New Kids From The Bloc|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|title=The Cotton Industry|last=Aspin|first=Chris|publisher=Shire Publications|location=Aylesbury|year=1981|isbn=0-85263-545-1|page=3}}</ref> It developed a wide range of industries, so that by 1835 "Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world."<ref name=Hall/> Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, but diversified into general manufacture. Similarly, the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes, but expanded into other areas. Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance.{{multiple image

}} Trade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the world's first intercity passenger railway<U+2014>the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down.<ref name="Kidd"/> In 1878 the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] (the forerunner of [[BT Group|British Telecom]]) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.<ref name="GPO">{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/1851to1880/1878.htm|title=Events in Telecommunications History|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=BT Archives|year=1878}}</ref>

The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was built in 1894, in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey, running {{convert|58|km|mi|0}}<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aina.org.uk/aina_members/Directory-MSC.htm|title= Directory <U+2013> MSC<!-- Bot generated title -->}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> from [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canal's banks, just outside the borough, the world's first industrial estate was created at [[Trafford Park]].<ref name="Kidd"/><!--1993, p103 --> Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.

A centre of capitalism, Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes. One such gathering ended with the [[Peterloo Massacre]] of 16 August 1819. The economic school of [[Manchester capitalism]] developed there, and Manchester was the centre of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] from 1838 onward.

Manchester has a notable place in the history of [[Marxism]] and left-wing politics; being the subject of [[Friedrich Engels]]' work ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]''; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester,<ref name="Engles">{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm|title=Marx-Engels Internet Archive <U+2013> Biography of Engels|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=Marx/Engels Biography Archive|year=1893}}</ref> and when [[Karl Marx]] visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library.

At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen<U+2014>new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]], promoting [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation.

Many of the great public buildings (including [[Manchester Town Hall]]) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the [[Hall<U+00E9> Orchestra]]. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a [[county borough]] with even greater autonomy.

Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian [[Simon Schama]] noted that "Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke". An American visitor taken to Manchester<U+2019>s blackspots saw "wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Victoria and Her Sisters |series= A History of Britain |serieslink= A History of Britain (TV series) |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 4 June 2002 |number=13}}</ref>

The number of [[cotton mill]]s in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853.<ref name="GM Arch"/> Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by [[Bolton]] in the 1850s and [[Oldham]] in the 1860s.<ref name="GM Arch"/> However, this period of decline coincided with the rise of city as the financial centre of the region.<ref name="GM Arch"/> Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area.<ref name="Kidd"/> The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

=== The Second World War and the Manchester Blitz ===
Like most of the UK, the Manchester area mobilised extensively during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. For example, casting and machining expertise at [[Beyer, Peacock and Company]]'s locomotive works in [[Gorton]] was switched to bomb making; [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]'s rubber works in [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]] made [[barrage balloon]]s; and just outside the city in [[Trafford Park]], engineers [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] made [[Avro Manchester]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] built the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the [[Luftwaffe]], and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets. The biggest took place during the "[[Manchester Blitz|Christmas Blitz]]" on the nights of 22/23 and 24 December 1940, when an estimated {{convert|467|long ton|t}} of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses were damaged.<ref>{{cite book | last= Hardy | first= Clive | title= Manchester at War | edition= 2nd | year= 2005 | location= Altrincham| isbn= 1-84547-096-6 | pages=75<U+2013>99 | chapter= The blitz | publisher=First Edition Limited }}</ref> [[Manchester Cathedral]] was among the buildings seriously damaged; its restoration took 20 years.<ref name="WWII">{{cite web | url= http://www.manchestercathedral.org/content/blogcategory/33/158/8/40/ | title= Timeline | accessdate=5 May 2009 | publisher=Manchester Cathedral Online | year= 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081206171002/http://www.manchestercathedral.org/content/blogcategory/33/158/8/40/|archivedate=6 December 2008}}</ref>

Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans, including the [[Manchester Martyrs]] of 1867, arson in 1920, a series of explosions in 1939, and two bombs in 1992. On Saturday 15 June 1996, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) carried out the [[1996 Manchester bombing]], the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb injured over 200 people, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows half a mile away. The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at <U+00A3>50&nbsp;million, but this was quickly revised upwards.<ref name="1996 IRA costs">{{cite book | title= A History of Manchester| first= Stuart | last=Hylton| year= 2003| pages=227<U+2013>230 | publisher=Phillimore & Co | location= Chichester | isbn= 1-86077-240-4}}</ref> The final insurance payout was over <U+00A3>400&nbsp;million; many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade.<ref name="IRA business">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/3704943.stm | title= Panorama <U+2013> The cost of terrorism | accessdate=5 May 2009 |publisher=BBC  | date= 15 May 2004}}</ref>

[[File:Map of Manchester.png|thumb|left|upright|The City of Manchester. The [[land use]] is overwhelmingly urban]]
The name Manchester, though officially applied only to the metropolitan district within Greater Manchester, has been applied to other, wider divisions of land, particularly across much of the Greater Manchester county and urban area.

For purposes of the [[Office for National Statistics]], Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]], the United Kingdom's third largest conurbation.

Manchester's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] to [[contemporary architecture]]. The widespread use of [[red brick]] characterises the city. Much of the architecture in the city harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade.<ref name="Hartwell"/> Just outside the immediate city centre is a large number of former [[cotton mill]]s, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space. [[Manchester Town Hall]], in [[Albert Square, Manchester|Albert Square]], was built in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] style and is considered to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in England.<ref>Robinson (1986), ''The Architecture of Northern England'', p.&nbsp;153</ref>

Manchester also has a number of [[Tallest Buildings of Manchester|skyscrapers]] built during the 1960s and 1970s, the tallest of which was the [[CIS Tower]] located near [[Manchester Victoria station]] until the [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] was completed in 2006; it is an example of the new surge in high-rise building and includes a [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton hotel]], a restaurant, and apartments.

Manchester is home to the largest group of [[consul (representative)|consuls]] in the UK outside London. The expansion of international trade links during the Industrial Revolution led to the introduction of the first consuls in the 1820s and since then over 800, from all parts of the world, have been based in Manchester.
