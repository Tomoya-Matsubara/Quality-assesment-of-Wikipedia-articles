'''[[Kentucky colonel|Colonel]] Harland David Sanders{{efn|Sanders was given the honorary title "[[Kentucky colonel|Kentucky Colonel]]" in 1935 by [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] [[Ruby Laffoon]].}}''' (September 9, 1890&nbsp;<U+2013> December 16, 1980) was an American businessman, restaurateur and [[goodwill ambassador]] for [[KFC]].

Sanders held a number of jobs in his early life, such as a [[Stoker|fireman]], [[insurance]] salesman and running [[filling stations]]. He began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in [[Corbin, Kentucky]], during the [[Great Depression]]. Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant [[restaurant franchise|franchising]] concept, and the first [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)]] franchise opened in Utah in 1952. The company's rapid expansion across the United States and overseas saw it overwhelm him however, and in 1964 he sold the company to a group of investors led by [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] and [[Jack C. Massey]] for $2 million.

==Early life==
Sanders was born on September 9, 1890 in a thin-walled, four room shack on a country road {{convert|3|mi|km}} east of [[Henryville, Indiana]].<ref name=autogenerated3>The Human Tradition in the New South  By James C. Klotter 130</ref> He was the oldest of three children born to Wilbur David and Margaret Ann (nee Dunlevy) Sanders.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> The family attended the [[Advent Christian Church]].<ref name=advent>{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Harland|title=The Incredible Colonel|year=1974|publisher=Creation House|location=Illinois|page=13|isbn=978-0-88419-053-0}}</ref> The family were of mostly Irish and English ancestry.

His father was a mild and affectionate man who tried to make a living as a farmer on the 80 acres of land that he owned, but after a fall he broke his leg and had to give up his profession.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> He worked as a butcher in Henryville for the next two years.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> One summer afternoon in 1895, he came home with a fever and died later that day.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Sanders' mother obtained work in a tomato-canning factory; and the young Harland was required to look after and cook for his siblings.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> When he was 10 he began to work as a farmhand for local farmers Charlie Norris and Henry Monk.

Sanders' mother remarried in 1902, and the family moved to [[Greenwood, Indiana]].<ref name=celebritychef>{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Harland|title=The Autobiography of the Original Celebrity Chef|year=2012|publisher=KFC|location=Louisville|page=|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/colcookbook/us/pdf/English_FullBook.pdf|isbn=978-0-9855439-0-7|accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref> Sanders argued with his stepfather, so he moved out after a year.<ref name=celebritychef /> Sanders dropped out of school when he was 13.<ref name=celebritychef /> He went to live and work on a nearby farm.<ref name=celebritychef /> He then took a job painting horse carriages in [[Indianapolis]].<ref name=celebritychef /> When he was 14 he moved to southern Indiana to work as a farmhand for two years for Sam Wilson.<ref name=celebritychef /> In 1906, with his mother's approval, he left home to live with his uncle in [[New Albany, Indiana]].<ref name=autogenerated2>The Human Tradition in the New South  By James C. Klotter 131</ref> His uncle worked for the [[streetcar]] company, and got Sanders a job as a conductor.<ref name=oz8>{{cite book|last=Ozersky|first=Josh|title=Colonel Sanders and the American Dream|year=2012|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-74285-7|page=8}}</ref>

==Early career==
Sanders falsified his date of birth and enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in November 1906, completing his service commitment as a [[teamster]] in [[Cuba]].<ref name=autogenerated2 /> He was honorably discharged after three months and in 1907 moved to [[Sheffield, Alabama]], where an uncle lived.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> His brother Clarence had also moved there, in order to avoid his stepfather.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> His uncle worked for the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railroad]], and got Sanders a job there as a blacksmith's helper in the workshops.<ref name=celebritychef /> After two months, Sanders moved to [[Jasper, Alabama]] where he got a job cleaning out the ash pans of trains from the Northern Alabama Railroad (a division of the Southern Railroad) when they had finished their run.<ref name=celebritychef /> Sanders progressed to become a [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] while still only 16.<ref name=celebritychef />

Sanders married Josephine King in 1909 and started a family, but after his boss fired him for insubordination while he was on a trip, Josephine stopped writing him letters. He then learned that Josephine had left him, given away all their furniture and household goods, and taken the children back to her parents<U+2019> home. Josephine<U+2019>s brother wrote Sanders a letter saying, "She had no business marrying a no-good fellow like you who can<U+2019>t hold a job." He had a son, Harland, Jr., who died at an early age, and two daughters, Margaret Sanders and Mildred Sanders Ruggles.<ref name=NYTObit/><ref>Josh Kegley, [http://www.kentucky.com/2010/09/25/1449490/daughter-of-colonel-sanders-dies.html  Daughter of Colonel Sanders dies at age 91], ''Lexington Herald-Leader'', September 25, 2010.</ref>

In 1909 Sanders found laboring work with the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]].<ref name=celebritychef /> He then found work as a fireman on the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], and he and his family moved to [[Jackson, Tennessee]].<ref name=celebritychef /> Meanwhile, Sanders studied law by correspondence at night through the [[La Salle Extension University]].<ref name=celebritychef /> Sanders lost his job at Illinois after brawling with a work colleague.<ref name=brawl>{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Harland|title=The Incredible Colonel|year=1974|publisher=Creation House|location=Illinois|page=30|isbn=978-0-88419-053-0}}</ref> While Sanders moved to work for the [[Rock Island Railroad]], Josephine and the children went to live with her parents.<ref name=celebritychef /> After a while, Sanders began to practice law in [[Little Rock]] for three years, and he earned enough fees for his family to move with him.<ref name=celebritychef /> His legal career ended after he got engaged in a courtroom brawl with his own client.<ref name=oz12>{{cite book|last=Ozersky|first=Josh|title=Colonel Sanders and the American Dream|year=2012|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-74285-7|page=12}}</ref>

After that, Sanders moved back with his mother in Henryville, and went to work as a laborer on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].<ref name=celebritychef /> In 1916, the family moved to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], where Sanders got a job selling [[life insurance]] for the [[Prudential Life Insurance Company]].<ref name=celebritychef /> Sanders was eventually fired for insubordination.<ref name=oz14>{{cite book|last=Ozersky|first=Josh|title=Colonel Sanders and the American Dream|year=2012|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-74285-7|page=14}}</ref> He moved to Louisville and got a salesman job with [[Mutual Benefit Life]] of [[New Jersey]].<ref name=oz14 />

In 1920, Sanders established a ferry boat company, which operated a river boat between Jeffersonville and Louisville.<ref name=celebritychef /> He canvassed for funding, becoming a minority shareholder himself, and was appointed secretary of the company.<ref name=celebritychef /> The ferry was an instant success.<ref name="Klotter2005">{{cite book|last=Klotter|first=James C.|title=The Human Tradition in the New South|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nzlEdUaG_xkC&pg=PA133|year=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4616-0096-1|page=134}}</ref> He then got a job as secretary at the [[Columbus, Indiana]] [[Chamber of Commerce]].<ref name=celebritychef /> He admitted to not being very good at the job, and resigned after less than a year.<ref name=celebritychef /> Sanders cashed in his ferry boat company shares for $22,000 and used the money to establish a company manufacturing [[acetylene]] lamps.<ref name=celebritychef /> The venture failed after [[Delco Electronics|Delco]] introduced an electric lamp that they sold on credit.

Sanders moved to [[Winchester, Kentucky]], to work as a salesman for the [[Michelin Tire Company]].<ref name=celebritychef /> In 1924, Michelin closed their tire factory, and Sanders lost his job.<ref name=michelin>{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Harland|title=The Incredible Colonel|year=1974|publisher=Creation House|location=Illinois|page=45|isbn=978-0-88419-053-0}}</ref> In 1924, by chance, he met the state manager for [[Standard Oil]], who asked him to run a [[Filling station|service station]] in [[Nicholasville]].<ref name=celebritychef /> In 1930, the station closed as a result of the Great Depression.<ref name=oz19>{{cite book|last=Ozersky|first=Josh|title=Colonel Sanders and the American Dream|year=2012|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-74285-7|page=19}}</ref>

[[File:FirstKFC.jpg|thumb|The world's first KFC franchise, located in [[South Salt Lake, Utah]]]]
In 1930, the [[Shell Oil Company]] offered Sanders a service station in [[Corbin, Kentucky]] rent free, whereby he paid them a percentage of sales.<ref name=celebritychef /> Sanders began to cook chicken dishes and other meals such as [[country ham]] and [[steak]]s for customers.<ref>[http://www.kfc.co.uk/about-kfc/kfc-history KFC.co.uk | About Us | KFC History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since he did not have a restaurant, he served customers in his adjacent living quarters. He was commissioned as a [[Kentucky Colonel]] in 1935 by Kentucky governor [[Ruby Laffoon]]. His local popularity grew, and in 1939 food critic [[Duncan Hines]] visited Sanders's restaurant and included it in ''Adventures in Good Eating'', his guide to restaurants throughout the US. The entry read:
{{quote|[[Corbin, Kentucky|Corbin, KY.]] &nbsp; [[Harland Sanders Caf<U+00E9> and Museum|Sanders Court and Caf<U+00E9>]]<br />''41 <U+2014> Jct. with 25, 25 E. <U+00BD> Mi. N. of Corbin.

L.&nbsp;50<U+00A2> to $1; D.,&nbsp;60<U+00A2> to $1}}

In July 1939 Sanders acquired a motel in [[Asheville]], [[North Carolina]]. His Corbin restaurant and motel was destroyed in a fire in November 1939, and Sanders had it rebuilt as a motel with a 142 seat restaurant (on a site that would later be designated the [[Harland Sanders Caf<U+00E9> and Museum]]).<ref name = SandersCafe/> By July 1940, Sanders had finalized his "[[Colonel's secret recipe|Secret Recipe]]" for frying chicken in a [[Pressure frying|pressure fryer]] that cooked the chicken faster than [[pan frying]]. As World War II broke out, gas was rationed, and as the tourists dried up, Sanders was forced to close his Asheville motel. He went to work as a restaurant supervisor in Seattle until the latter part of 1942.<ref name=celebritychef /> He later ran cafeterias for the government at an Ordinance Works in Tennessee, followed by a job as an assistant manager at a cafeteria in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].<ref name=celebritychef /> He left his mistress Claudia Price as manager of the Corbin restaurant and motel.<ref name=celebritychef /> In 1942 he sold the Asheville business.<ref name=celebritychef />

In 1947, he and Josephine divorced and Sanders married Claudia in 1949, as he had long desired.<ref name=autogenerated4>The Human Tradition in the New South  By James C. Klotter 142</ref> He was "re-commissioned" as a Kentucky Colonel in 1949 by his friend, Governor [[Lawrence Wetherby]].<ref name = SandersCafe/>

In 1952, Sanders franchised "Kentucky Fried Chicken" for the first time, to [[Pete Harman]] of [[South Salt Lake, Utah]], the operator of one of that city's largest restaurants.<ref name="mash">{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595057690/Colonels-landmark-KFC-is-mashed.html|title=Colonel's landmark KFC is mashed|accessdate=October 28, 2007|publisher=Deseret Morning News|year=2004|author=Nii, Jenifer K.}}</ref> In the first year of selling the product, restaurant sales more than tripled, with 75% of the increase coming from sales of fried chicken.<ref name=autogenerated30>Chicken Big and the Citizen Senior By Jodi Lawrence. The Washington Post, Times Herald (1959<U+2013>1973) [Washington, D.C] November 9, 1969: 305.</ref> For Harman, the addition of fried chicken was a way of differentiating his restaurant from competitors; in Utah, a product hailing from Kentucky was unique and evoked imagery of [[Southern hospitality]].<ref name=autogenerated26>{{cite news |title=Pete Harman |author=Liddle, Alan |newspaper=Nation's Restaurant News |date=May 21, 1990}}</ref> Don Anderson, a sign painter hired by Harman, coined the name ''Kentucky Fried Chicken''.<ref name="autogenerated26"/>

[[File:Colonel Harland Sanders in character.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sanders signing his autograph, 1974.]]
At age 65, Sanders' store failed due to the then-new [[Interstate 75]] reducing his restaurant's customer traffic.{{r|ozersky20100915}}<ref>''[[I've Got A Secret]]'' interview, originally broadcast April 6, 1964 (rebroadcast by GSN March 30, 2008).</ref> Sanders decided to begin to franchise his chicken concept in earnest, and traveled the US looking for suitable restaurants.

The franchise approach became successful; KFC was one of the first fast food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada and later in England, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. However, the company's rapid expansion saw it overwhelm the aging Sanders. In 1964 he sold the Kentucky Fried Chicken corporation for $2 million to a partnership of Kentucky businessmen headed by [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] The deal did not include the Canadian operations.{{CN|date=November 2013}}

In 1965 Sanders moved to [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]] to oversee his Canadian franchises and continued to collect franchise and appearance fees both in Canada and in the U.S. Sanders bought and lived in a bungalow at 1337 Melton Drive in the [[Lakeview, Mississauga|Lakeview]] area of Mississauga from 1965 to 1980.<ref>[http://news.ca.msn.com/ontario/mississauga/kfc-nixes-mississaugas-col-sanders-for-new-upmarket-restaurant KFC nixes Mississauga's Col.

For example, his 80th birthday was held at the [[Inn on the Park]] in [[North York, Ontario]], hosted by [[Jerry Lewis]] as a [[Canadian Muscular Dystrophy Association]] fundraiser.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dinner for Col.

Klotter 153</ref> He also befriended [[Billy Graham]] and [[Jerry Falwell]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In 1973, he sued [[Heublein Inc.]]<U+2014>the then parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken<U+2014>over the alleged misuse of his image in promoting products he had not helped develop. In 1975, Heublein Inc. unsuccessfully sued Sanders for libel after he publicly described their gravy as "wallpaper paste" to which "sludge" was added.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kleber |first=John E. |authorlink= |coauthors=Thomas D.

==Public image==
After being recommissioned as a [[Kentucky colonel]] in 1950 by Governor [[Lawrence Wetherby]], Sanders began to dress the part, growing a goatee and wearing a black [[frock coat]] (later switching to a white suit), a [[string tie]], and referring to himself as "Colonel".<ref name = SandersCafe>{{cite web |url=http://www.corbinkentucky.us/sanderscafe.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041022135543/http://www.corbinkentucky.us/sanderscafe.htm |archivedate=2004-10-22 |title=KFC - Colonel Sanders Cafe & Museum - America's First Kentucky Fried Chicken |publisher=Corbinkentucky.us |date=February 18, 1964 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref> His associates went along with the title change, "jokingly at first and then in earnest", according to biographer [[Josh Ozersky]].<ref name="ozersky20100915">{{cite news|last=Ozersky|first=Josh|title=KFC's Colonel Sanders: He Was Real, Not Just an Icon|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,2019218,00.html|accessdate=September 18, 2010|newspaper=Time|date=September 15, 2010}}</ref>

He never wore anything else in public during the last 20 years of his life, using a heavy wool suit in the winter and a light cotton suit in the summer.<ref name="ozersky20100915" /> He bleached his mustache and goatee to match his white hair.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

Sanders later used his stock holdings to create the Colonel Harland Sanders Trust and Colonel Harland Sanders Charitable Organization, which used the proceeds to aid charities and fund scholarships. His trusts continue to donate money to groups like the [[Trillium Health Care Centre]]; a wing of their building specializes in women's and children's care and has been named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trilliumhealthcentre.org/about/mississauga.html |title=About Us: Tillium Health Center |publisher=Trilliumhealthcentre.org |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> The [[Sidney, British Columbia]] based foundation granted over $1,000,000 in 2007, according to its  2007 tax return.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/chrts/menu-eng.html|title=Harland Sanders Foundation on the CRA web site}}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref>

He was buried in his characteristic white suit and black western string tie in [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] in Louisville.

Since his death, Sanders has been portrayed by voice actors in Kentucky Fried Chicken commercials in radio and an animated version of him has been used for television commercials.

The Japanese [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] league has developed an [[urban legend]] of the "[[Curse of the Colonel]]". A statue of Colonel Sanders was thrown into a river and lost during a 1985 fan celebration, and (according to the legend) the "curse" has caused Japan's [[Hanshin Tigers]] to perform poorly since the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/bbw/2003-08-21-leading-off_x.htm|title=The Colonel's curse runs deep|first=Paul|last=White|date=August 21, 2003|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=May 28, 2009}}</ref>

Watanabe put on the famous suit after placing the winning bid at the auction event in Dallas, Texas.

A manuscript of a book on cooking, which Sanders apparently wrote in the mid-1960s, has been found in KFC archives. It includes some cooking recipes from Sanders as well as stories. KFC plans to try some of the recipes, and to offer the book online.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.athenstalks.com/colonel-sanders-harbored-more-one-secret|title=Colonel Sanders harbored more than one secret|last=Schreiner|first=Bruce|work=[[News & Record]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref>
