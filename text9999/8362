'''Wollaton Hall''' is a [[country house]] standing on a small but prominent hill in [[Wollaton Park]], [[Nottingham]], England. The house is now [[Nottingham Natural History Museum]], with [[Nottingham Industrial Museum]] in the out-buildings.  The surrounding park land is regularly used for large-scale [[Wollaton Park#Events|outdoor events]] such as rock concerts, sporting events and festivals.

==History==

[[File:Wollaton Hall by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm 1773.jpg|thumb|left|Wollaton Hall, drawn by [[Samuel Hieronymus Grimm]], 1773]]

Wollaton Hall was built between 1580 and 1588 for [[Francis Willoughby (1547-1596)|Sir Francis Willoughby]] and is believed to be designed by the Elizabethan architect, [[Robert Smythson]], who was the architect of [[Hardwick Hall]]. The style is  [[Elizabethan architecture|Elizabethan]] with early [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] elements. The floor plan has been said to derive from [[Serlio]]'s drawing (in Book III of his ''Five Books of Architecture'') of [[Giuliano da Majano]]'s Villa Poggio Reale near Naples of the late fifteenth century, with elevations derived from [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]].<ref>Sir [[John Summerson]] (1954) Architecture in Britain, 1530 to 1830. (Pelican History of Art) London: Penguin Books, p31.</ref> The architectural historian [[Mark Girouard]] has suggested that the design is in fact derived from Nikolaus de Lyra's reconstruction, and [[Josephus]]'s description, of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem,<ref>Mark Girouard, "Solomon's Temple in Nottinghamshire" in ''Town and Country'' Yale University Press, 1992, pp187-197</ref> with a more direct inspiration being the mid-sixteenth century [[Mount Edgcumbe House|Mount Edgcumbe]] in Cornwall, which Smythson knew.<ref>Mark Girouard, Elizabethan Architecture: Its Rise and Fall, 1540<U+2013>1640 (Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art) Yale University Press 2009 p.87</ref> The building is of [[Ancaster stone]] from [[Lincolnshire]], and is said to have been paid for with coal from the Wollaton pits owned by Willoughby. [[Cassandra Willoughby, Duchess of Chandos]] recorded in 1702 that the master masons, and some of the statuary, were brought from Italy. The decorative but ludicrous [[gondola]] mooring rings carved in stone on the exterior walls offer some evidence of this, as do other architectural features. There are also obvious French and Dutch influences.

The building consists of a high central hall, surrounded by four towers.  Unfortunately, a fire caused damage to Smythson's interior decoration of some of the ground floor rooms, but little structural damage occurred. Remodelling was carried out by [[Jeffry Wyattville|Wyattville]] in 1801 and continued intermittently until the 1830s.

The gallery of the main hall contains Nottinghamshire's oldest [[pipe organ]], thought to date from the end of the seventeenth century, possibly by the builder Gerard Smith. It is still blown by hand. Paintings on the ceilings and one wall are attributed to [[Antonio Verrio]] or his assistant [[Laguerre]]. Directly over the main hall is a 'prospect room', from which there are extensive views of the Park. Beneath the hall are many cellars and passages, and a [[water well|well]] and associated reservoir tank, in which some accounts report that an [[admiral]] of the Willoughby family took a daily bath.

The Willoughbys were noted for the number of explorers they produced, most famously [[Hugh Willoughby|Sir Hugh Willoughby]] who died in the Arctic in 1554 attempting a [[North East passage]] to [[Cathay]]. [[Willoughby's Land]] is named after him.

In 1881, the house was still owned by the head of the Willoughby family, [[Digby Willoughby, 9th Baron Middleton]], but by then it was "too near the smoke and busy activity of a large manufacturing town... now only removed from the borough by a narrow slip of country", so that the previous head of the family, [[Henry Willoughby, 8th Baron Middleton]], had begun to let the house to tenants and in 1881 it was vacant.<ref>Leonard Jacks, [http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/Jacks1881/wollaton.htm Wollaton] (1881), online at nottshistory.org.uk</ref>

The hall reopened in April 2007 after being closed for refurbishment. The prospect room at the top of the house, and the kitchens in the basement, were opened up for the public to visit, though this must be done on one of the escorted tours. The latter can be booked on the day, last about an hour, and a small charge is made.

In 2011, key scenes from the [[Batman]] movie ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' were filmed outside Wollaton Hall.<ref>{{cite news|last=Heath|first=Neil|title=Batman boost as The Dark Knight Rises at Wollaton Hall|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-13679676|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 June 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> The Hall was featured as the latest [[Wayne Manor]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/film/865934-the-dark-knight-rises-finds-new-home-for-batman-in-nottingham|title=The Dark Knight Rises finds new home for Batman in Nottingham|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=20 August 2012|work=[http://www.metro.co.uk/ Metro.co.uk]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Limited]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/City-paid-Batman-filming/story-12854596-detail/story.html|title=City was paid for Batman filming|work=[http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/ This is Nottingham]|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>
