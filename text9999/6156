== History ==
The headland known as Ram's Head overlooks the entrance to Cork Harbour - one of the world's largest natural harbours, and historically of strategic defensive and naval importance to Ireland and the region.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ireland Green Guide Michelin 2012-2013| publisher=Michelin Green Guides |isbn=9782067182172 |date=2011}}</ref> The first harbour defences built at Ram's Head date from 1550 and were originally known as ''James' Battery''.<ref name="timeline"/> This fortification was extended in 1600, but fell into disuse after the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].<ref name="history"/> The fort was reinforced in 1690 to [[Siege of Cork|defend Cork Harbour]] during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], but a party secretly came ashore and took the fort in an overland assault.<ref name="history"/> The ports at Cork and Kinsale were later captured by forces under the Williamite [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]].

By the Napoleonic War (1779) the defences were known as the ''Ram's Head Battery'',<ref name="journal"/> and upgraded and remodelled to compliment other installations at [[Haulbowline]], Spike Island (Fort Westmoreland/Mitchell) and Whitegate (Fort Carlisle/Davis). In 1795 these fortifications were named ''Fort Camden'' for [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden]], then [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].<ref name="examiner">{{cite news|url= http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/politics/fort-needs-10m-to-fulfil-potential-167187.html |title=Fort needs <U+20AC>10m to fulfil potential |publisher=Irish Examiner Newspaper |date=12 September 2011 | accessdate=5 June 2014}}}</ref>

By the 1830s, Fort Camden had been reduced to a token force, and the fort was briefly repurposed as a prison.<ref name="history"/> However, a Royal Commission in the 1850s gave renewed consideration to the strategic importance of the harbour, and proposed enhancements to landward defences and seaward gun batteries.<ref name="history"/> This construction work started in 1861 - using convict, military and civilian labour. The fort was extended to 45 acres - 65% of structures being constructed underground.<ref name="independent"/> The current structures of the fort are attributable primarily to these works.<ref name="report">{{Cite report |author=John Miller (Cork Civic Trust) |date=November 2010 |title= Fort Camden Development Project - Feasibility and Development Strategy - Report |url=http://www.corkharbour.ie/pages/FortCamdenDevelopmentProject_Study2011.pdf | publisher=Cork Civic Trust, Cork County Council |accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>

In the 1880s and 1890s the guns were upgraded with breech-loading rifled guns, newer larger cannon were installed, a minefield was laid across the channel and a launching position was added for the "world's first ''practical'' guided weapon", the "[[Brennan Torpedo]]".<ref name="gray"/><ref name="victorianforts"/>

During the [[First World War]], the harbour was used as a naval base to cover the western approaches, an anti-submarine net was added and further upgrades were applied to harbour defences. After the [[Irish War of Independence]], under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] the harbour defences remained in the control of British government. These [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Port installations]], including Fort Camden, were handed-over to the Irish authorities in July 1938. The fort was renamed ''Fort Meagher'' for [[Thomas Francis Meagher]] - who had fought in the [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848]]. (Similarly, "Fort Westmoreland" on Spike Island was renamed "Fort Mitchell", and "Fort Carlisle" at Whitegate was renamed "Fort Davis").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishamericancivilwar.com/2013/06/19/a-yankee-and-rebel-side-by-side-in-cork-harbour/ |title=A Yankee and Rebel Side by Side in Cork Harbour | publisher=Irish in the American Civil War |accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>
 
During "[[the Emergency (Ireland)|the Emergency]]" (1939-1945), elements of the Coastal Defence Artillery (CDA) of the [[Artillery Corps (Ireland)|Irish Artillery Corps]] operated from the fort and the nearby Templebreedy Battery.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.militaryarchives.ie/collections/offline-collections/coastal-defence-artillery-collection |title=Military Archives - Coastal Defence Artillery Collection | publisher=Irish Defence Forces - Military Archives |accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> By the mid- to late-20th Century the CDA was merged into other artillery regiments of the [[Irish Army]], and the fort was used primarily for training of [[Civil Defence Ireland|Civil Defence]] and [[Reserve Defence Forces]].<ref name="journal"/> In the 1980s the army handed-over the fort to the local civil administration authority, [[Cork County Council]].<ref name="history"/><ref name="report"/> The facility remained disused however, and became overgrown and derelict in the following decades. In 2010 Cork County Council afforded a lease to community members from Crosshaven,<ref name="history"/> who instrumented a volunteer campaign to clear, conserve, redevelop and operate the fort as a heritage tourism site.<ref name="journal"/>

[[File:CamdenFortMeagherCorkReenactorsDisplay.JPG|thumb|Historical reenactors on the fort's parade ground]]
From 2010, under a "Rescue Camden" banner, a community group of volunteers began reclaiming and restoring Camden Fort Meagher. With input from Cork County Council, [[Foras <U+00C1>iseanna Saothair]] (the Training and Employment Authority), and other partners, the group began to clean, restore, develop and (ultimately) operate the fort as a tourism and heritage centre. Some of these works were covered in documentary programming by [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rte.ie/tv/dirtyoldtowns/fortcamden.html |title=RT<U+00C9> Television - Factual - Dirty Old Towns - Camden|publisher=Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann| accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref> As of 2014, the fort is opened to visitors - but limited to weekends between June to September.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camdenfortmeagher.ie/tickets-admission/ |title=Official Camden Fort Meagher Website - Admission |publisher=Camdenfortmeagher.ie  accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>

A significant portion of the site has been restored for self-guided and guided tours - though several areas are not accessible to visitors with reduced mobility. A number of exhibits and installations cover the British and Irish military heritage of the fort, and the site houses the only resident 9/11 exhibit outside of the United States.<ref name="nineeleven"/> There is a caf<U+00E9> with views of the harbour mouth, and [[historical reenactment]] events are occasionally held on the parade square.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/regionals/corkman/news/crosshavens-fort-camden-to-host-military-reenactment-27086161.html |title=Crosshaven's Fort Camden to host military re-enactment |publisher=Irish Independent |date=28 July 2011 | accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>
