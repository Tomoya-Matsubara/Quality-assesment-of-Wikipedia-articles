===Greekonomics===

In October 2012, [[Biteback Publishing]] brought out her book, [[Greekonomics]], a discussion of the crises in the eurozone, with the focus especially as the title indicates on the country of her birth. This book is intended for a broad, not merely an academic, audience.

It paints a vivid picture of what a Greek exit from the eurozone might mean: "A serious possibility of exit -- and how could it be kept completely secret? -- would lead to a full-scale run on the banks. Clearly any country wishing to exit the eurozone would have to nationalize or take temporary control of the banks and reintroduce controls on the movement of capital. The government would also need to reintroduce stringent border controls to stop people leaving the country with euro notes and coins in their luggage or in their underwear! In countries like Greece, where taking to the streets is part of the political way of life, the population would probably react by attempting to physically remove their savings, breaking into the banks -- and then for good measure attacking Parliament. So in Greece a euro exit could easily end with troops on the streets and martial law -- just the circumstances that joining the EU was meant to prevent."

==Personal life==
In 1972 she married an LSE academic with the surname of Pryce, whom she divorced in 1981, having had two daughters with him.<ref name=Temko/>

In 1984, Pryce married [[Chris Huhne]], who later became an [[Member_of_the_European_Parliament|MEP]] and then the [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] MP for [[Eastleigh (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastleigh]] and [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]]. They had three children together.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4603240.stm|title=Profile: Chris Huhne  |date=Thursday, 2 March 2006 |work=BBC News |publisher= |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> They divorced in January 2011.<ref name=Echo>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/8229228.MP_Chris_Huhne_leaves_wife_for_another_woman/ |title=Eastleigh MP Chris Huhne splits from wife Vicky Pryce  |publisher=Dailyecho.co.uk |date=2010-06-19 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref><ref>BBC News, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16649877 "Sunday Times drops Chris Huhne emails legal challenge"], ''BBC News Online'', (20 January 2012)</ref>
