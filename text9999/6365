'''Old Town''' is a village on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]] in the [[Isles of Scilly]] located southeast of [[Hugh Town]].<ref name="os">{{cite book|title=Landranger 203: Land's End & Isles of Scilly|url=http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=90945&Y=10332&A=Y&Z=120|publisher=Ordnance Survey|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref> It is thought to be the oldest settlement on the island. There is a [[church (building)|church]], an [[public house|pub]] (the ''Old Town Inn''),<ref name="oldtowninn">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldtowninn.co.uk/|title=Old Town Inn|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref> two cafes, a small convenience shop and a day nursery.

It is a popular tourist area and is only a short distance from the [[St Mary's Airport (Isles of Scilly)|island's airport]]. As well as a number of self-catering holiday properties, Old Town also has a large proportion of dwellings permanently occupied by local residents.

Old Town Bay links the village with the open sea; the ''Gilstone'', a prominent rock off Old Town Bay, should not be confused with a rock of the same name in the [[Western Rocks, Isles of Scilly|Western Rocks]].

==Ennor Castle==
On a small but prominent knoll are the fragmentary remains of a small [[shell keep]] castle dating from the thirteenth or fourteenth century, known as '''Ennor Castle''', the only medieval castle on the islands.<ref>[http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1014994 Historic England] Ennor Castle</ref> It became redundant after [[Star Castle, Isles of Scilly|Star Castle]] was built in the late sixteenth century, and much of its stone was then robbed for buildings in Old Town.<ref name="pastscape">{{cite web | url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=304082 | title=Ennor Castle | publisher=English Heritage | accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref>

On the other side of the bay to the settlement lies [[St Mary's Old Church, St Mary's|St Mary's Old Church]] (commonly known as ''Old Town Church'') which is surrounded by the cemetery for St Mary's.
