According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 601.7 square miles (1,558.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>); this comprises 579.4 square miles (1,500.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of land and 22.3 square miles (57.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of water.
Most of Houston is located on the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|gulf coastal plain]], and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, swamp, or [[prairie]], which are all still visible in surrounding areas. Flatness of the local terrain, when combined with [[urban sprawl]], has made flooding a recurring problem for the city.<ref>[http://www.crwr.utexas.edu/gis/gishyd98/class/trmproj/ahrens/prepro.htm Flood Forecasting for the Buffalo Bayou Using CRWR-PrePro and HEC-HMS].

Houston has four major [[bayou]]s passing through the city. [[Buffalo Bayou]] runs through downtown and the [[Houston Ship Channel]], and has three tributaries: [[White Oak Bayou]], which runs through the [[Houston Heights|Heights]] neighborhood north of downtown and then towards downtown; Braes Bayou, which runs along the [[Texas Medical Center]]; and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of Houston and downtown Houston. The ship channel continues past [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and then into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

===Geology===
Underpinning Houston's land surface are [[Consolidation (geology)|unconsolidated]] [[clay]]s, clay [[shale]]s, and poorly cemented [[sand]]s up to several miles deep. The region's [[geology]] developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. These [[sediment]]s consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic matter that, over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of [[halite]], a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into [[salt dome]] formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.<ref>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/HH/hch7.html Harris County].

There have been no significant historically recorded [[earthquakes]] in Houston, but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes occurring in the deeper past, nor in the future. Land in some communities southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out from the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves.<ref>[http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/eq/faq/tx.htm Texas Earthquakes], ''University of Texas Institute for Geophysics'', July 2001.

===Cityscape===
{{Further|[[Geographic areas of Houston]]|[[List of Houston neighborhoods]]}}
Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the [[Ward (politics)|ward]] system of representation. The ward designation is the progenitor of the nine current-day Houston City Council districts. Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate&nbsp;610 Loop]]. The inside encompasses the [[central business district]] and many residential neighborhoods that predate World War II. More recently, high-density residential areas have been developed within the loop. The city's outlying areas, suburbs and enclaves are located outside of the loop. [[Texas State Highway Beltway 8|Beltway 8]] encircles the city another 5&nbsp;miles (8&nbsp;km) farther out.

Though Houston is the largest city in the United States without formal [[zoning]] regulations, it has developed similarly to other [[Sun Belt]] cities because the city's land use regulations and [[Covenant#In a legal context|legal covenants]] have played a similar role.<ref name=nytzoning>{{Cite web | title = FOCUS: Houston; A Fresh Approach To Zoning | work = New York Times | accessdate = 2009-03-27 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/realestate/focus-houston-a-fresh-approach-to-zoning.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print

Though some<ref name=nozoning/> have blamed the city's low density, [[urban sprawl]], and lack of [[Walkability|pedestrian-friendliness]] on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with a bounty of affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the [[United States housing bubble|2008 real estate crisis]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Lack of zoning has paid off for Houston|work=chron.com, Houston Chronicle|date= 2008-05-27|accessdate=2009-03-27|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/steffy/5804649.html}}</ref> The city issued 42,697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 2009, according to Builder magazine.<ref>{{Cite web | title = The Healthiest Housing Markets for 2009 - Local Markets, Construction, Home Priceses | work = Builder Magazine | date = 2009-02-27 | accessdate = 2009-03-04 | url = http://www.builderonline.com/local-markets/the-healthiest-housing-markets-for-2009.aspx?page=15}}</ref>

Voters rejected efforts to have separate residential and commercial land-use districts in 1948, 1962, and 1993. Consequently, rather than a single central business district as the center of the city's employment, multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to [[Downtown Houston|downtown]] which include [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]], [[Texas Medical Center|Texas&nbsp;Medical&nbsp;Center]], [[Midtown, Houston, Texas|Midtown]], [[Greenway Plaza|Greenway&nbsp;Plaza]], [[Houston Energy Corridor|Energy&nbsp;Corridor]], [[Westchase, Houston, Texas|Westchase]], and [[Greenspoint, Houston, Texas|Greenspoint]].

This system enables pedestrians to avoid the intense summer heat and heavy rain showers while walking from one building to another.

In the 1960s, [[Downtown Houston]] consisted of a modest collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown into one of the largest [[skyline]]s in the United States. Downtown was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with huge projects being launched by [[real estate developer]]s with the energy industry boom. A succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s<U+2014>many by real estate developer [[Gerald D. Hines]]<U+2014>culminating with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, {{convert|1002|ft|m|0|sing=on}}-tall [[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]] (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), which was completed in 1982. It is the tallest structure in Texas, [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|10th-tallest]] building in the United States and the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|30th-tallest]] skyscraper in the world based on height to roof. In 1983, the 71-floor, {{convert|992|ft|m|0|sing=on}}-tall [[Wells Fargo Bank Plaza]] (formerly Allied Bank Plaza) was completed, which became the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas. Based on height to roof, it is the 13th-tallest in the United States and the 36th-tallest in the world. As of 2007, downtown Houston had over 43&nbsp;million square feet (4,000,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) of office space.<ref>[http://www.houstondowntown.com/Home/GeneralInfo/About/FastFacts1/ Fast Facts, Downtown Houston].

Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the [[Uptown Houston|Uptown District]] boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of mid-rise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate 610]] west. Uptown became one of the most impressive instances of an [[edge city]]. The highest achievement of Uptown was the construction of the 64-floor, {{convert|901|ft|m|0|sing=on}}-tall, [[Philip Johnson]] and [[John Burgee]] designed landmark [[Williams Tower]] (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time, it was believed to the be the world's tallest skyscraper outside of a central business district. The Uptown District is also home to other buildings designed by noted architects such as [[I. M. Pei]], [[C<U+00E9>sar Pelli]], and [[Philip Johnson]]. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a mini-boom of mid-rise and [[high-rise]] [[Tower block|residential tower]] construction, with several over 30 stories tall.<ref>[http://www.uptown-houston.com/economic/market/residential.html Residential Real Estate].
