'''John Harkes''' (born March 8, 1967 in [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], [[New Jersey]]) is an [[United States|American]] former [[soccer]] player. Harkes was the first American ever to play in the English [[Premier League]], and the second American to score at [[Wembley Stadium]]. He is a member of the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]]. He appeared in two [[FIFA World Cup]] tournaments, and won two [[MLS Cup]] titles with [[D.C. United]], and was the second American footballer to appear in the final of a major English tournament since [[Julian Sturgis]] in [[1876 FA Cup Final|1876]]. Harkes is of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent. 

A mainstay in the [[United States men's national soccer team|US national team]] [[midfield]] for most of the 1990s, Harkes was named the team's "Captain for Life" by then head coach [[Steve Sampson]] before having that title stripped from him by Sampson soon after. Harkes ended his national team career with 90 [[Cap (football)|caps]] and 6 goals. Harkes was formerly a [[color commentator]] for the [[ESPN Major League Soccer|MLS on ESPN]], since being replaced by Taylor Twellman<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/john-harkes-out-as-lead-espn-us-soccer-analyst-replaced-by-taylor-twellman/2011/11/21/gIQACZI8iN_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>. He called matches in the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] with  [[JP Dellacamera]], and at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] with [[Ian Darke]].

==Personal life==
John Harkes currently resides in Alexandria, Virginia with his wife [[Cindi Harkes]], and his son Ian Harkes. Cindi was recently named as an assistant coach of [[D.C. United Women]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Famer Cindi Harkes Joins D.C. United Women Staff|url=http://www.dcunitedwomen.com/home/519670.html|publisher=D.C.

==Amateur career==
=== High school===
Harkes grew up in the soccer hotbed of [[Kearny, New Jersey]],<ref>Bondy, Filip.

Harkes graduated from [[Kearny High School (New Jersey)|Kearny High School]] in 1985.<ref>Yannis, Alex. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DC1739F931A35755C0A96F948260 "Cosmos Spirit Infuses 2 At Tournament Debut"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 June 1989. Accessed 17 December 2007. "Harkes, who went to Kearny High School, has been the most industrious player for the Americans in their three World Cup qualifying games (1-1-1) thus far."</ref> During his high school career, Harkes played in four [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]] championship matches and led his team to the 1984 Group 4 State Championship and a 24-0 record.  He was the 1984 Parade High School Player of the Year.

In 1999, he was named by ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1980s.<ref>Jandoli, Ron. [http://web.archive.org/web/20030110132039/http://nj.com/hssports/ledger/index.ssf?/hssports/century/stories/bsoccerdecades.html "The Century's Best -- Boys Soccer: Top 10 Players of each decade"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', November 7, 1999, backed up by the [[Internet Archive]] as of January 10, 2003, Accessed September 11, 2008</ref>

===College===
From 1985 to 1987, Harkes played soccer at the [[University of Virginia]] under his future D.C. United head coach [[Bruce Arena]].  He was named the [[Hermann Trophy]] winner by the [[Missouri Athletic Club]] in 1987.  He decided to forego his senior year in order to play full time for the [[United States men's national soccer team|national team]] in 1988.  That was the year the team played in the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in Seoul and began the qualification process for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].

== Professional career ==
===U.S. minor leagues===
Harkes began his professional career with the [[Albany Capitals]] of the [[American Soccer League]] in 1989.  He was a first team [[All Star]] that year.

===England: 1990<U+2013>1996===
Harkes moved to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] of the [[England|English]] [[Football League]] in 1990. In a game that season against Derby County, his 35 yard blast glided into the net past former England World Cup goalkeeper Peter Shilton and earned him English football's "Goal of the Year" award.  That season, Harkes became the second American (after Bill Regan, Romford 1948-49) to play at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] when Sheffield Wednesday reached the 1991 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final.  There, the Second Division (now [[Football League Championship]]) Wednesday upset the First Division (now [[F.A. Premier League|Premier League]]) side [[Manchester United]] 1-0. Also that year, Wednesday won promotion to the First Division.

In 1993, Harkes became the only American to score in a League Cup Final, in a 2-1 loss to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. His goal was the second by an American at Wembley Stadium following [[Mike Masters]]' goal for Colchester United in the [[F.A. Trophy]] Final the year before. He appeared in the [[FA Cup Final]] one month after that League Cup disappointment, with Sheffield Wednesday again losing to Arsenal (2-1 in the replay, after a 1-1 draw in the first game). Harkes played one more season in England after moving to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the summer of 1993.  In 1995, [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) began preparing for its first season, which it first thought would come in the fall of 1995.  As part of that process, MLS signed prominent U.S. players to league contracts.  Harkes was one of the players who signed with MLS, only to discover the league would not begin play until 1996.  Therefore, he, and MLS, negotiated a one year loan to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<sup>[http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/players/john_harkes/]</sup><!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Mls cup2.jpg|thumb|right|Harkes hoisting the first [[MLS Cup]]]] -->

===Major League Soccer: 1996<U+2013>2003===
In 1996, Harkes, along with his U.S. national teammates based overseas, returned to the U.S. for the launch of [[Major League Soccer]].  MLS had signed numerous prominent U.S. players and eventually allocated them throughout the league's teams in order to create an initial equitable distribution of talent.  MLS [[1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations|allocated]] Harkes to [[D.C. United]], making him the team's first player ever.  That first season, he led the club to a [[MLS Cup]] win and a [[U.S. Open Cup]] title.  D.C. United successfully defended its MLS Cup title in 1997, with Harkes assisting on the match-winning goal in the cup final.

Despite the disappointment of being left off the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] squad, Harkes helped United capture the [[Supporters Shield]] for the best regular season record in the league, before losing in the MLS Cup Final to the [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]]. He also helped United become the first MLS club to win the [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] and upset [[Brazil]]'s [[Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama|Vasco Da Gama]] in the [[Interamerican Cup]].<ref name=LookBack>[http://dcunited.mlsnet.com/MLS/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20050928&content_id=44136&vkey=news_dcu&fext=.jsp&team=dcu Looking back: John Harkes] mlsnet.com, September 28, 2005</ref>

At the end of the 1998 season, he traveled back to England for a two week trial with [[Nottingham Forest]].  On January 28, 1999, the team accepted Harkes for a two month loan period.  He played only three games for Forest (including the infamous [[Nottingham Forest F.C. 1<U+2013>8 Manchester United F.C.|8-1]] defeat to Manchester United) before returning to the U.S.  While he was in England, [[D.C. United]] traded him to the [[New England Revolution]] for the Revs first and second round [[1999 MLS College Draft]] picks.  United traded Harkes in order to make room under the [[salary cap]].

Harkes played three seasons in New England before being traded to the [[Columbus Crew]] in the mid-season of 2001. After an injury-plagued 2002 season, Harkes announced his retirement in 2003.

==International career==
John Harkes played in the [[FIFA World Cup 1990|1990]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]s and was controversially cut from the team weeks before the [[FIFA World Cup 1998|1998 tournament]] by national team coach [[Steve Sampson]].

Harkes made his national team debut on 23 March 1987 against [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]]. He quickly established himself as a national team regular and was selected for the [[United States at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]].  That year the U.S. went 1-1-1 and failed to qualify for the second round. Harkes continued to play for the national team as it went through the qualification process for the upcoming World Cup. The team qualified for those games after an improbable 1-0 road victory over [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in the final qualification match.

In 1990, he was a member of a [[1990 FIFA World Cup (squads)#USA|World Cup squad]] made up mostly of college and semi-professional players. The United States side was routed 1-5 by [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], but were respectable losing 0-1 to host nation and eventual semi-finalist [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and 1-2 to [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. Despite losing all three matches, many players from the 1990 squad, including Harkes, Ramos, Meola, [[Marcelo Balboa]] and [[Eric Wynalda]], formed the core of the US national team for most of the decade and played an important role in the development of MLS.

USA fared better as the host nation in the 1994 World Cup, upsetting [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] 2-1 in a group stage match to advance to the Round of 16. Harkes contributed to the [[Andr<U+00E9>s Escobar]] [[own goal]] which likely led to the Colombian defender's shooting death weeks later.<ref>[http://www.planetworldcup.com/GUESTS/mike20020515.html What the world is waiting for] planetworldcup.com</ref> Harkes delivered a cross from the left aimed at [[Earnie Stewart]], which Escobar attempted to clear, but instead sent the ball past his goalkeeper. 

However, Harkes missed the Round of 16 match against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] after receiving his second [[Penalty_card#Yellow_card|yellow card]] of the group stage against [[Romania national football team|Romania]], earning a one-match suspension. Brazil won the match 1-0 and went on to win the World Cup.

In [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica 1995]], Harkes led the United States, a guest team at the tournament, to a 3-0 upset of defending champion [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and a semi-final finish. He was named co-Most Valuable Player of the tournament, along with Uruguyan [[Enzo Francescoli]].

In 1996, before the beginning of the [[Football World Cup 1998 (qualification CONCACAF)|qualifying]] for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], head coach [[Steve Sampson]] named Harkes "Captain For Life", which meant Harkes would be the captain of the national team as long as he wished and Sampson was the coach. He responded by leading the team in assists in qualifying and helped the United States qualify for a third straight World Cup finals appearance.

===1998 World Cup controversy===

<!--  Commented out: [[File:John Harkes book.jpg|thumb|Cover of Harkes' autobiography, ''Captain for Life'']] -->However, Sampson controversially left Harkes off the World Cup squad, citing "leadership issues", although the decision was never fully explained.<ref name=LookBack /> In February 2010 Sampson and former teammate [[Eric Wynalda]] revealed that an alleged affair between Harkes and Wynalda's wife had prompted Harkes' sudden dismissal.<ref>http://www.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_14319062</ref> The bitterness resulting from the omission and the irony of the "Captain for Life" title would serve as the inspiration for his autobiography, ''Captain for Life: And Other Temporary Assignments'' (ISBN 1-886947-49-X), co-written with [[Denise Kiernan]] and published in 1999. In the book, Harkes criticized Sampson for lacking "credibility to a group of guys who had hundreds and hundreds of caps among them" and "putting a huge amount of pressure on young, internationally inexperienced players", and concluded, "I can't think of one thing that Steve did right in the months leading up to the World Cup".<ref>[http://www.soccertimes.com/book/1999/harkes.htm Bitter Harkes closes with blistering shots at Sampson] By Jerry Langdon ''Gannett News Service'' (June 14, 1999)</ref> The 1998 team went on to lose all three games in the group stage, finishing last overall.

Harkes was called up to the national team again by his former college coach, [[Bruce Arena]] in 1999, and helped the United States win the bronze medal in the [[Confederations Cup]] that year. He ended his international career in 2000 with 90 appearances.

==Off the field==
In 1994, Harkes appeared in [[People (magazine)|''People'']] magazine's annual "The 50 Most Beautiful People" issue.

In 2003, John Harkes announced his retirement from professional soccer. He became the Director of Youth Development for D.C. United and a [[color commentator]] for soccer broadcasts on [[Fox Sports Channel]]. 

Harkes was elected to the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] on the first ballot in 2005.

Harkes appeared in the 2005 film ''[[The Game of Their Lives (2005 film)|The Game of Their Lives]]'' in the role of [[Ed McIlvenny]], a member of the US World Cup team that upset [[England national football team|England]] 1-0 in the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]].

Harkes worked as an analyst for ESPN and ABC in broadcasting the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], also working in 2008 as lead soccer analyst for both networks. Harkes returned to his role offering color commentary for ESPN and ABC in those networks' coverage of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].

In July 2006, John Harkes left his job at D.C. United to become an assistant coach for [[New York Red Bulls]] under coach [[Bruce Arena]]. He was let go, though, after Arena was fired.

A long time supporter of childhood youth development, Harkes joined the National Board of [http://www.americascores.org/#/national America SCORES] in 2010. [http://www.americascores.org/#/national America SCORES] provides afterschool programming to elementary and middle school children in under-resourced communities around the country, providing soccer, poetry and community service.
