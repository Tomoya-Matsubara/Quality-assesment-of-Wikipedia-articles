'''Stem cells''' are [[Cell (biology)|cells]] found in most, if not all, multi-cellular [[organisms]]. They are characterized by the ability to renew themselves through [[Mitosis|mitotic]] [[cell division]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiating]] into a diverse range of specialized cell types. Research in the stem cell field grew out of findings by [[Canada|Canadian]] scientists [[Ernest McCulloch|Ernest A. McCulloch]] and [[James Till|James E. Till]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Becker AJ, McCulloch EA, Till JE | title = Cytological demonstration of the clonal nature of spleen colonies derived from transplanted mouse marrow cells | journal = Nature | volume = 197 | pages = 452<U+2013>4 | year = 1963 | pmid = 13970094 | doi=10.1038/197452a0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Siminovitch L, McCulloch EA, Till JE | title = The distribution of colony-forming cells among spleen colonies | journal = Journal of Cellular and Comparative Physiology | volume = 62| pages = 327<U+2013>36 | year = 1963 | pmid = 14086156  | doi = 10.1002/jcp.1030620313}}</ref>
The two broad types of mammalian stem cells are: '''[[embryonic stem cell]]s''' that are isolated from the [[inner cell mass]] of [[blastocyst]]s, and '''[[adult stem cell]]s''' that are found in adult tissues. In a developing [[embryo]], stem cells can differentiate into all of the specialized embryonic tissues. In [[adult]] organisms, stem cells and [[progenitor cell]]s act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells, but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.

Stem cells can now be grown and transformed into specialized cells with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves through [[cell culture]]. Highly plastic adult stem cells from a variety of sources, including [[umbilical cord blood]] and [[bone marrow]], are routinely used in medical therapies. Embryonic [[cell line]]s and [[autologous]] embryonic stem cells generated through [[therapeutic cloning]] have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Tuch BE | title=Stem cells<U+2014>a clinical update | journal=[[Australian Family Physician]] | volume=35 | issue=9 | pages=719<U+2013>21 | year=2006 | pmid=16969445}}</ref>

==Properties==
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possess two properties: 
* '''''Self-renewal''''' - the ability to go through numerous [[cell cycle|cycles]] of [[cell division]] while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
* '''''Potency''''' - the capacity to differentiate into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either '''[[totipotency|totipotent]]''' or '''[[pluripotency|pluripotent]]''' - to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although '''[[multipotent]]''' or '''[[unipotent cell|unipotent]]''' [[progenitor cell]]s are sometimes referred to as stem cells. 

===Potency definitions===
[[Image:Stem cells diagram.png|400px|thumb|right|Pluripotent, embryonic stem cells originate as inner mass cells within a blastocyst. The stem cells can become any tissue in the body, excluding a placenta. Only the morula's cells are totipotent, able to become all tissues and a placenta.]]
[[Image:Human embryonic stem cells.png|thumb|250px|'''Human [[embryo]]nic stem cells''' <br /> A: Cell colonies that are not yet differentiated. <br /> B: [[Nerve]] cell]]
''Potency'' specifies the differentiation potential (the potential to differentiate into different cell types) of the stem cell.<ref name=Schoeler>{{cite book|title=Humanbiotechnology as Social Challenge|editor=Nikolaus Knoepffler, Dagmar Schipanski, and Stefan Lorenz Sorgner|pages=28|chapter=The Potential of Stem Cells: An Inventory|author=Hans R.

* '''[[Totipotency|Totipotent]]''' (a.k.a '''omnipotent''') stem cells can differentiate into embryonic and extraembryonic cell types.  Such cells can construct a complete, viable, organism.<ref name=Schoeler/>  These cells are produced from the fusion of an egg and sperm cell. Cells produced by the first few divisions of the fertilized egg are also totipotent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* '''[[Pluripotency|Pluripotent]]''' stem cells are the descendants of totipotent cells and can differentiate into nearly all cells,<ref name=Schoeler/> i.e. cells derived from any of the three [[germ layer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ulloa-Montoya F, Verfaillie CM, Hu WS |title=Culture systems for pluripotent stem cells |journal=J Biosci Bioeng. |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=12<U+2013>27 |year=2005 |month=Jul |pmid=16233846 |doi=10.1263/jbb.100.12 }}</ref>
* '''[[Multipotency|Multipotent]]''' stem cells can differentiate into a number of cells, but only those of a closely related family of cells.<ref name=Schoeler/>
* '''[[Oligopotency|Oligopotent]]''' stem cells can differentiate into only a few cells, such as lymphoid or myeloid stem cells.<ref name=Schoeler/>
* '''[[Unipotency|Unipotent]]''' cells can produce only one cell type, their own,<ref name=Schoeler/> but have the property of self-renewal which distinguishes them from non-stem cells (e.g. muscle stem cells).

===Identification===
The practical definition of a stem cell is the functional definition - a cell that has the potential to regenerate tissue over a lifetime.  For example, the gold standard test for a bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is the ability to transplant one cell and save an individual without HSCs.  In this case, a stem cell must be able to produce new blood cells and immune cells over a long term,  demonstrating potency.  It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs,  demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.

Properties of stem cells can be illustrated ''[[in vitro]]'', using methods such as [[mesenchymal stem cell|clonogenic assay]]s, where single cells are characterized by their ability to differentiate and self-renew.<ref>{{cite journal

However, ''in vitro'' culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells will behave in a similar manner ''[[in vivo]]''. Considerable debate exists whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.

==Embryonic==
{{main|Embryonic stem cell}}

'''Embryonic stem cell lines''' (ES cell lines) are cultures of cells derived from the [[epiblast]] tissue of the [[inner cell mass]] (ICM) of a [[blastocyst]] or earlier [[morula]] stage embryos.<ref>

}}</ref> A blastocyst is an early stage [[embryo]]<U+2014>approximately four to five days old in humans and consisting of 50<U+2013>150 cells. ES cells are [[pluripotent]] and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary [[germ layer]]s: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult [[human body|body]] when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the [[placenta]].

Nearly all research to date has taken place using mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or human embryonic stem cells (hES).  Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of gelatin and require the presence of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF).<ref>

The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]] as [[embryonic stem cell]]s, because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an [[embryo]]. Additionally, because in some instances adult stem cells can be obtained from the intended recipient, (an [[autograft]]) the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent in these situations.  Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.<ref>

==Lineage==
{{main|Stem cell line}}
To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see ''Stem cell division and differentiation'' diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a [[progenitor cell]] with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally [[cell differentiation|differentiating]] into a mature cell. It is possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]) between the daughter cells.<ref>

An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals.

The signals that lead to reprogramming of cells to an embryonic-like state are also being investigated. These signal pathways include several [[transcription factor]]s including the [[oncogene]] [[Myc|c-Myc]].

Challenging the terminal nature of cellular differentiation and the integrity of lineage commitment, it was recently determined that the somatic expression of combined [[transcription factor|transcription factors]] can directly induce other defined somatic cell fates; researchers identified three neural-lineage-specific transcription factors that could directly convert mouse [[fibroblasts]] (skin cells) into fully-functional [[neuron|neurons]]<ref>Vierbuchen, T.

However, there still exists a great deal of social and scientific uncertainty surrounding stem cell research, which could possibly be overcome through public debate and future research, and further education of the public.

Stem cells, however, are already used extensively in research, and some scientists do not see cell therapy as the first goal of the research, but see the investigation of stem cells as a goal worthy in itself.<ref>

==Controversy surrounding research==
{{main|Stem cell controversy}}
{{seealso|Stem cell laws}}

Opponents of the research argue that embryonic stem cell technologies are a [[slippery slope]] to [[reproductive cloning]] and can fundamentally devalue human life. Some in the [[pro-life]] movement argue that a human embryo is already a human life that is entitled to protection.  

Contrarily, supporters of embryonic stem cell research argue that such research should be pursued because the resultant treatments could have significant medical potential. It is also noted that excess embryos created for [[invitro fertilization|in vitro fertilization]] could be donated with consent and used for the research. 

The ensuing debate has prompted authorities around the world to seek regulatory frameworks and highlighted the fact that stem cell research represents a [[social]] and [[ethical]] challenge.

==Research patents==
The [[patent]]s covering a lot of work on human embryonic stem cells are owned by the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] (WARF). WARF does not charge academics to study human stem cells but does charge commercial users. WARF sold [[Geron Corp.]] exclusive rights to work on human stem cells but later sued Geron Corp. to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron Corp. would keep the rights to only three cell types. In 2001, WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology.<ref name = "stemcellPatent">Regalado, Antonio, David P. Hamilton (July 2006). [http://www.genetics-and-society.org/newsdisp.asp?id=1033 "How a University's Patents May Limit Stem-Cell Researcher."] ''Wall Street Journal''. Retrieved on July 24, 2006.</ref>

These patents are now in doubt as a request for review by the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] has been filed by non-profit patent-watchdogs [http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/ The Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights] and the [[Public Patent Foundation]]  as well as molecular biologist Jeanne Loring of the Burnham Institute. According to them, two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1993 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge states that these techniques, developed by [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James A. Thomson]], are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks. 

The outcome of this legal challenge is particularly relevant to the Geron Corp. as it can only license patents that are upheld.<ref name="Kintisch">Kintisch, Eli (July 18, 2006) [http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2006/718/2 "Groups Target Stem Cell Patents."] ''ScienceNOW Daily News''.

==Key research events==
*'''1908''' - The term "stem cell" was proposed for scientific use by the [[Russia]]n histologist [[Alexander Maksimov]] (1874<U+2013>1928) at congress of hematologic society in [[Berlin]]. It postulated existence of haematopoietic stem cells.
* '''1960s''' - [[Joseph Altman]] and [[Gopal Das]] present scientific evidence of adult [[neurogenesis]], ongoing stem cell activity in the brain; like [[Andr<U+00E9> Gernez]], their reports contradict [[Santiago Ram<U+00F3>n y Cajal|Cajal]]'s "no new neurons" dogma and are largely ignored.
* '''1963''' - [[Ernest McCulloch|McCulloch]] and [[James Till|Till]] illustrate the presence of self-renewing cells in mouse bone marrow.
* '''1968''' - [[Bone marrow]] [[Organ transplant|transplant]] between two siblings successfully treats [[Severe combined immunodeficiency|SCID]].
* '''1978''' - [[Haematopoietic stem cell]]s are discovered in human [[cord blood]].
* '''1981''' - Mouse [[embryonic stem cell]]s are derived from the [[inner cell mass]] by scientists [[Martin Evans]], [[Matthew Kaufman]], and [[Gail R. Martin]]. Gail Martin is attributed for coining the term "Embryonic Stem Cell".
* '''1992''' - Neural stem cells are cultured ''[[in vitro]]'' as neurospheres.
* '''1997''' - Leukemia is shown to originate from a haematopoietic stem cell, the first direct evidence for [[cancer stem cell]]s.
* '''1998''' - [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]] and coworkers derive the first human embryonic [[stem cell line]] at the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]].<ref name=pmid9804556>
