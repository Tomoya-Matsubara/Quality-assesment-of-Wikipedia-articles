'''''Magia''''' ({{lang-en|"Magic"}}) is the debut [[studio album]] by Colombian singer-songwriter [[Shakira]]. It was released in June 1991 by [[Sony Music|Sony Music Colombia]], with whom she signed a three-album recording contract. The record is a collection of dance songs and [[ballads]] Shakira wrote since she was eight years old, with themes inspired from the experience hanging out with males, adventure stories, and dreams of living on the coast.

The album's live performances helped Shakira receive attention on Colombian media, and the LP earned her an award at the [[Vi<U+00F1>a del Mar International Song Festival]]. However, it was not a commercial success, with sales of only 1,200 copies. By Shakira's request, ''Magia'' and its follow-up ''[[Peligro (Shakira album)|Peligro]]'' (1993) were removed from music markets.

==Development and composition==
[[File:Shakira Live in Rotterdam.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Shakira, pictured in 2003.]]
Born in [[Barranquilla]], Colombia,<ref name="driven"/> Shakira began writing songs at the age of 8 years,<ref name=rollingstone/> her first one being "Tus Gafas Oscuras".<ref name="driven"/> Her performances at local competitions led to a meeting with local theater producer Monica Ariza, who later held an audition for her in [[Bogot<U+00E1>]]. She performed three songs for executives of [[Sony Music|Sony Music Columbia]], who were impressed enough to sign her, at the age of 13, to record three albums, which were ''Magia'', ''[[Peligro (Shakira)|Peligro]]'' and ''[[Pies Descalzos]]''.<ref name="driven">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060721213102/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/96614/episode_about.jhtml|title=Driven: Shakira|accessdate=August 6, 2013|publisher=[[VH1]]}}</ref>

The low-budget ''Magia''<ref name = "DiegoXimenap37">Diego, Ximena (2002). p. 37.</ref> was put in almost three months of [[pre-production]],<ref name = "DiegoXimenap36">Diego, Ximena (2002). p. 36.</ref> which involved [[choreography]] of live performances for the album, singing lessons for Shakira, and arranging the songs.<ref name = "DiegoXimenap35"/> The concept of the music still reflected her personality, despite the fact that it was managed by the record label.<ref name = "DiegoXimenap35">Diego, Ximena (2002). p. 35.</ref> The tracks deal with emotions of a person's first time falling in love, and range from a love poem ("Sue<U+00F1>os") to a celebration of dance ("Esta noche voy contigo"). These were influenced from experiences with males such as her ex-boyfriend Oscar Pardo, stories told by her father, and dreams of living on the coast. In the book ''Shakira: Woman Full of Grace'', Ximena Diego wrote that the album "demonstrated her [Shakira's] indisputable potential."<ref name = "DiegoXimenap37"/>

''Magia'' is a collection of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12,<ref name = "DiegoXimenap37"/> mixed [[pop rock]] [[ballad]]s and [[disco]] uptempo songs with [[Electronic music|electronic]] accompaniment, although it was hampered by a lack of recording and production cohesion.<ref name=rollingstone/> It was produced by Miguel E. Cubillos and Pablo Tedeschi, and recorded at Aga Studios in Bogot<U+00E1>,<ref name = "Album notes">{{cite album-notes|title=Magia|artist=Shakira|year=1991|publisher=[[Sony Music|Sony Music Columbia]]|format=back cover|publisherid=14464663}}</ref> when Shakira was 13. A Sony Music Columbia representative said that the recording process was simple and went perfectly fine. But for Shakira, the process was problematic, as she had no ability to decide which tracks would be included and no input into the rhythmic structure or artistic production of the songs.<ref name = "DiegoXimenap36"/>

To promote the launch of the album, as a suggestion from Shakira,<ref name = "DiegoXimenap35"/> live performances were held in locations such as Teatro Amira de la Rosa,<ref name = "DiegoXimenap38">Diego, Ximena (2002). p. 38.</ref> [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Santa Marta]], [[Riohacha]], [[Medellin]], [[Cali]], [[Bogota]], and other various theaters and events,<ref name = "DiegoXimenap39">Diego, Ximena (2002). p. 39.</ref> all of which received print, radio and television coverage.<ref name="DiegoXimenap38"/> The performances featured additional dancers and background vocalists such as Cesar Navarro, Guillermo Gomez, Mauricio Pinilla, and Richard Ricardo. A music video was done for "Magia", which Navarro also starred in.<ref name = "DiegoXimenap36"/> Navarro found working with Shakira enjoyable and relaxing, and recalled her as sensitive and energetic: "She was a tireless worker, but more than anything, she was a total blast."<ref name = "DiegoXimenap39"/> The choreography for the performances was done by Gary Julio and Ray Silva.<ref name = "DiegoXimenap36"/> The album won an award at the [[Vi<U+00F1>a del Mar International Song Festival]] in 1991,<ref name = "ShakiraMagia">[http://shakira.elheraldo.co/discografia/magia Magia].
