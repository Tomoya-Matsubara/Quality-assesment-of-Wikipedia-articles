The AVMA publishes the ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association'' and the ''American Journal of Veterinary Research''.

The AVMA's veterinary student organization is the [[Student American Veterinary Medical Association]] (SAVMA).

==History==
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) was founded in 1863, when 40 delegates representing seven states met for a convention in New York. Originally named the United States Veterinary Medical Association, the USVMA was renamed the AVMA in 1889.<ref name=About>{{cite web| url=http://www.avma.org/about_avma/history/history_avma.asp| title=History of the AVMA| accessdate = 2006-04-06}}</ref>

By 1913, the AVMA consisted of 1,650 members, with membership open only to graduates of accredited veterinary schools.<ref name="About"/>

Today, the AVMA has more than 81,500 members engaged in a wide variety of work. In addition to treating pets, veterinarians work in a number of fields, such as public health, agriculture, food safety, academics, and the military.<ref name="History"/>

==AVMA policy==
{{Generalize|date=October 2009}}

The AVMA produces policies in response to member requests and stakeholder interest. These statements are general and aim to encourage improvement based on the best available scientific evidence.<ref name=Policies>{{cite web| url=http://www.avma.org/issues/animal_welfare/policies.asp| title=AVMA Animal Welfare Policies| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>

In 2005, the AVMA changed its policy on pregnant sow housing, stating that "given the number of variables and large variation in performance within both group and stall systems for pregnant sows, no one system is clearly better than others under all conditions and according to all criteria of animal welfare".<ref name=Housing>{{cite web| url=http://www.avma.org/issues/policy/animal_welfare/pregnant_sow_housing.asp| title=AVMA policy on pregnant sow housing| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>

The AVMA's policy was adopted after a comprehensive review by a multi-disciplinary, multi-perspective task force of experts that produced an accompanying review of housing for pregnant sows.<ref name=Review>{{cite web| url=http://www.avma.org/issues/animal_welfare/sow_housing_tfr.pdf| title=A comprehensive review of housing for pregnant sows| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>

The AVMA has voted on several proposals to take a formal stand against the forced feeding of birds to make [[foie gras]]. Although foie gras has been banned in many countries in Europe, as well as in the U.S. state of California, because of an absence of science specifically addressing the welfare aspects of [[foie gras]] production, as well as conflicting opinions among its membership, the AVMA opted not to take a stand either for or against [[foie gras]]. The AVMA has published a welfare implications of foie gras production backgrounder.<ref name=Backgrounder>{{cite web| url=http://www.avma.org/reference/backgrounders/foie_gras_bgnd.asp| title=Welfare implications for foie gras production| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>
