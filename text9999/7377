'''(Saint) Valentine's Day''' is a [[holiday]] celebrated on [[February 14]] by many people throughout the world. In the West, it is the traditional day on which lovers express their love for each other by sending [[greeting card|Valentine's cards]], [[Valentine's Day flowers|presenting flowers]], or offering [[confectionery]]. The day was originally a pagan festival that was renamed after two Early Christian [[martyr]]s named [[Saint Valentine|Valentine]]. The day became associated with [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] in the circle of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] in the [[High Middle Ages]], when the tradition of [[courtly love]] flourished.

The day is most closely associated with the mutual exchange of love notes in the form of "valentines". Modern Valentine symbols include the heart-shaped outline, doves, and the figure of the winged [[Cupid]]. Since the 19th century, handwritten notes have largely given way to mass-produced [[greeting card]]s.<ref>Leigh Eric Schmidt, "The Fashioning of a Modern Holiday: St. Valentine's Day, 1840-1870" ''Winterthur Portfolio'' '''28'''.4 (Winter 1993), pp. 209-245.</ref> The sending of Valentines was a fashion in nineteenth-century Great Britain, and, in 1847, Esther Howland developed a successful business in her Worcester, Massachusetts home with hand-made Valentine cards based on British models. The popularity of Valentine cards in 19th century America was a harbinger of the future commercialization of holidays in the United States.<ref>Leigh Eric Schmidt, "The Commercialization of the calendar: American holidays and the culture of consumption, 1870-1930" ''Journal of American History'' '''78'''.3 (December 1991) pp 890-98.</ref>

The U.S. [[Greeting Card Association]] estimates that approximately one billion valentines are sent each year worldwide, making the day the second largest card-sending holiday of the year, behind [[Christmas]]. The association estimates that, in the US, men spend on average twice as much money as women.<ref name="american" />

==Saint Valentine==
{{details|Saint Valentine}}
Numerous early Christian martyrs were named [[Saint Valentine|Valentine]].<ref>Henry Ansgar Kelly, in ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine'' ((Leiden: Brill) 1986, accounts for these and further local Saints Valentine (Ch. 6 "The Genoese Saint Valentine and the observances of May") in arguring that Chaucer had an established tradition in mind, and (pp 79ff) linking the Valentine in question to Valentine, first bishop of Genoa, the only Saint Valentine honoured with a feast in springtime, the season indicated by Chaucer. Valentine of Genoa was treated by [[Jacobus de Voragine|Jacobus of Verazze]] in his ''Chronicle of Genoa'' (Kelly p. 85).</ref> Until 1969, the Catholic Church formally recognized eleven Valentine's Days. {{Fact|date=February 2009}} The Valentines honored on February 14 are Valentine of Rome (''Valentinus presb. m. Romae'') and Valentine of Terni (''Valentinus ep. Interamnensis m. Romae'').<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', ''s.v.'' "Valentine": "The [[Acta|Acts]] of both are unreliable, and the Bollandists assert that these two Valentines were in fact one and the same."</ref> Valentine of Rome<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintv06.htm|title=Valentine of Rome}}</ref> was a priest in [[Rome]] who suffered martyrdom about AD 269 and was buried on the [[Via Flaminia]]. His relics are at the Church of Saint Praxed in Rome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novareinna.com/festive/saintval.html|title=Saint Valentine's Day: Legend of the Saint}}</ref> and at [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]] in Dublin, Ireland.

Valentine of Terni<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintv90.htm|title=Valentine of Terni}}</ref> became bishop of Interamna (modern [[Terni]]) about AD 197 and is said to have been killed during the persecution of Emperor [[Aurelian]]. He is also buried on the Via Flaminia, but in a different location than Valentine of Rome. His relics are at the Basilica of Saint Valentine in Terni (''Basilica di San Valentino'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Valentin/English/6/622.php3|title=Basilica of Saint Valentine in Terni}}</ref>

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' also speaks of a third saint named Valentine who was mentioned in early [[martyrology|martyrologies]] under date of February 14. He was martyred in [[Africa]] with a number of companions, but nothing more is known about him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15254a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Valentine}}</ref>

No romantic elements are present in the original early medieval biographies of either of these martyrs. By the time a Saint Valentine became linked to romance in the fourteenth century, distinctions between Valentine of Rome and Valentine of Terni were utterly lost.<ref>The present [[Roman Martyrology]] records, at February 14, "In Rome, on the Via Flaminia near the Milvian Bridge: St. Valentine, martyr."</ref>

In the 1969 revision of the [[Roman Catholic Calendar of Saints]], the feastday of Saint Valentine on February 14 was removed from the General Roman Calendar and relegated to particular (local or even national) calendars for the following reason: "Though the memorial of Saint Valentine is ancient, it is left to particular calendars, since, apart from his name, nothing is known of Saint Valentine except that he was buried on the Via Flaminia on February 14."<ref>''Calendarium Romanum ex Decreto Sacrosancti <U+0152>cumenici Concilii Vaticani II Instauratum Auctoritate Pauli PP. VI Promulgatum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis, MCMLXIX), p. 117</ref> The feast day is still celebrated in [[Balzan]] ([[Malta]]) where relics of the saint are claimed to be found, and also throughout the world by [[Traditionalist Catholics]] who follow the older, pre-[[Vatican II]] calendar.

The Early Medieval ''[[acta]]'' of either Saint Valentine were excerpted by Bede and briefly expounded in ''[[Legenda Aurea]]''.<ref> [http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden169.htm ''Legenda Aurea'', "Saint Valentine"].</ref> According to that version, St Valentine was persecuted as a Christian and interrogated by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius II]] in person. Claudius was impressed by Valentine and had a discussion with him, attempting to get him to convert to Roman paganism in order to save his life. Valentine refused and tried to convert Claudius to Christianity instead. Because of this, he was executed. Before his execution, he is reported to have performed a miracle by healing the blind daughter of his jailer.

''Legenda Aurea'' still providing no connections whatsoever with sentimental love, appropriate lore has been embroidered in modern times to portray Valentine as a priest who refused an unattested law attributed to [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius II]], allegedly ordering that young men remain single. The Emperor supposedly did this to grow his army, believing that married men did not make for good soldiers. The priest Valentine, however, secretly performed marriage ceremonies for young men. When Claudius found out about this, he had Valentine arrested and thrown in jail. In an embellishment to ''The Golden Legend'', on the evening before Valentine was to be executed, he wrote the first "valentine" himself, addressed to a young girl variously identified as his beloved,<ref name =greetings>[http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=882&display_order=1&sub_display_order=1&mini_id=1084 Materials provided by American Greetings, Inc. to History.com]</ref> as the jailer's daughter whom he had befriended and healed,<ref>[http://www.theholidayspot.com/valentine/history_of_valentine.htm History of Valentine's day], TheHolidaySpot.com</ref> or both.

== Attested traditions ==
=== Lupercalia ===
{{main|Lupercalia}}
Though popular modern sources link unspecified Greco-Roman February holidays alleged to be devoted to fertility and love to St Valentine's Day, Professor Jack Oruch of the [[University of Kansas]] argued<ref>Jack B. Oruch, "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February" ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981:534-565)</ref> that prior to [[Chaucer]], no links between the Saints named Valentinus and romantic love existed. In the [[Attic calendar|ancient Athenian calendar]] the period between mid-January and mid-February was the month of Gamelion, dedicated to the sacred [[marriage]] of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]].

In [[Ancient Rome]], [[Lupercalia]], observed February 13 through 15, was an archaic rite connected to fertility. Lupercalia was a festival local to the city of Rome. The more general Festival of [[Juno Februa]], meaning "Juno the purifier "or "the chaste Juno," was celebrated on February 13-14. Pope [[Gelasius I]] (492-496) abolished Lupercalia. <!--Candlemas is treated elsehere; here it is a confusing extraneity: Some historians argue that [[Candlemas]] (then held on February 14, later moved to February 2) was promoted as its replacement, but this feast was already being celebrated in [[Jerusalem]] by AD 381.--><!--the date was established in the martyrologies:"The pope also declared in 496 that the feast of [[St. Valentine]] would be on February 15."-->

It is a common opinion that the Christian church may have decided to celebrate Valentine's feast day in the middle of February in an effort to [[Christianization|christianize]] celebrations of the pagan Lupercalia. The Roman Catholic Church could not abolish the deeply rooted Lupercalia festival, so the church set aside a day to honor the Virgin Mary. <ref>William M. Green ''The Lupercalia in the Fifth Century'' Classical Philology Vol. 26, No. 1 (Jan. 1931), pp60<U+2011>69  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/CP/26/1/Lupercalia*.html pp60<U+2011>69] </ref>

=== Chaucer's love birds ===
While some claim the first recorded association of Valentine's Day with romantic love is in ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'' (1382) by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]<ref>Oruch, Jack B., "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February," ''Speculum,'' '''56''' (1981): 534-65. Oruch's survey of the literature finds no association between Valentine and romance prior to Chaucer. He concludes that Chaucer is likely to be "the original mythmaker in this instance."[http://colfa.utsa.edu/chaucer/ec23.html]</ref> this may be the result of misinterpretation. Chaucer wrote:

<blockquote>''For this was on seynt Volantynys day''<br />''Whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make''.</blockquote>

This poem was written to honor the first anniversary of the engagement of King [[Richard II of England]] to [[Anne of Bohemia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spotlight.ucla.edu/faculty/henry-kelly_valentine/|title=Henry Ansgar Kelly, Valentine's Day / UCLA Spotlight}}</ref> A treaty providing for a marriage was signed on May 2, 1381.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/chaucer/PF.html|title=Chaucer: The Parliament of Fowls}}</ref> (When they were married eight months later, he was 13 or 14, and she was 14.)

Readers have uncritically assumed that Chaucer was referring to February 14 as Valentine's Day; however, mid-February is an unlikely time for birds to be mating in England. Henry Ansgar Kelly has pointed out<ref>Kelly, Henry Ansgar, ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine'' (Brill Academic Publishers, 1997), ISBN 90-04-07849-5. Kelly gives the saint's day of the Genoese Valentine as May 3 and also claims that Richard's engagement was announced on this day. [http://www.iol.co.za/general/newsview.php?art_id=qw981696180625B241&click_id=1890&set_id=1]</ref> that in the liturgical calendar, May 2 is the saints' day for Valentine of Genoa. This St. Valentine was an early [[bishop of Genoa]] who died around AD 307.<ref>[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/day0502.htm Calendar of the Saints: 2 May]; [http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0502.htm Saint Patrick's Church: Saints of May 2]</ref>

Chaucer's ''Parliament of Foules'' is set in a fictional context of an old tradition, but in fact there was no such tradition before Chaucer. The speculative explanation of sentimental customs, posing as historical fact, had their origins among eighteenth-century [[Antiquary|antiquaries]], notably [[Alban Butler]], the author of ''Butler's Lives of Saints'', and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars. Most notably, "the idea that Valentine's Day customs perpetuated those of the Roman [[Lupercalia]] has been accepted uncritically and repeated, in various forms, up to the present"<ref>Oruch 1981:539.</ref>

=== Medieval period and the English Renaissance ===
Using the language of the law courts for the rituals of [[courtly love]], a "[[High Court of Love]]" was established in Paris on Valentine's Day in 1400. The court dealt with love contracts, betrayals, and violence against women. Judges were selected by women on the basis of a poetry reading.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/1999/8.html Domestic Violence, Discourses of Romantic Love, and Complex Personhood in the Law - [1999] MULR 8; (1999) 23 Melbourne University Law Review 211]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Valentin/English/4/422.php3|title=Court of Love: Valentine's Day, 1400}}</ref>

The earliest surviving valentine is a fifteenth-century [[rondeau]] written by [[Charles, Duke of Orleans]] to his "valentined" wife, which commences.
<blockquote>''Je suis desja d'amour tann<U+00E9><br />
''Ma tres doulce Valentin<U+00E9>e<U+2026>''<br /><small>(Charles d'Orl<U+00E9>ans, Rondeau VI, lines 1<U+2013>2)</small></blockquote>

At the time, the duke was being held in the Tower of London following his capture at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.<ref> [http://www.historychannel.com/exhibits/valentine/?page=history1 History Channel].</ref>

Valentine's Day is mentioned ruefully by Ophelia in ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1600-1601):

<blockquote>''To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,''<br /> ''All in the morning betime,''<br />''And I a maid at your window,''<br /> ''To be your Valentine.''<br />''Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,''<br /> ''And dupp'd the chamber-door;''<br />''Let in the maid, that out a maid''<br /> ''Never departed more.''<br /><small>(William Shakespeare, ''Hamlet'', Act IV, Scene 5)</small></blockquote>

[[Image:BigPinkHeart.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Valentine's Day postcard, circa 1910]]
===Modern times===
The reinvention of Saint Valentine's Day in the 1840s has been traced by Leigh Eric Schmidt.<ref>Schmidt 1993:209-245.</ref> As a writer in ''Graham's American Monthly'' observed in 1849, "Saint Valentine's Day... is becoming, nay it has become, a national holyday."<!--holyday in the original--><ref>Quoted in Schmidt 1993:209.</ref> In the [[USA|United States]], the first mass-produced valentines of embossed paper lace were produced and sold shortly after 1847 by [[Esther Howland]] (1828-1904) of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. Her father operated a large book and stationery store, but Howland took her inspiration from an English valentine she had received, so clearly the practice of sending Valentine's cards had existed in England before it became popular in North America. The English practice of sending Valentine's cards appears in [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s ''[[Mr. Harrison's Confessions]]'' (published 1851). Since 2001, the Greeting Card Association has been giving an annual "Esther Howland Award for a Greeting Card Visionary." The U.S. [[Greeting Card Association]] estimates that approximately one billion valentines are sent each year worldwide, making the day the second largest card-sending holiday of the year behind [[Christmas]]. The association estimates that, in the US, men spend in average twice as much money as women.<ref name="american">{{cite web|url=http://pressroom.americangreetings.com/archives/val08/valbiz08.html|title=American Greetings: The business of Valentine's day}}</ref>

Since the 19th century, handwritten notes have largely given way to mass-produced [[greeting card]]s.<ref>Leigh Eric Schmidt, "The Fashioning of a Modern Holiday: St. Valentine's Day, 1840-1870" ''Winterthur Portfolio'' '''28'''.4 (Winter 1993), pp. 209-245.</ref> The mid-nineteenth century Valentine's Day trade was a harbinger of further commercialized holidays in the United States to follow.<ref>Leigh Eric Schmidt, "The Commercialization of the calendar: American holidays and the culture of consumption, 1870-1930" ''Journal of American History'' '''78'''.3 (December 1991) pp 890-98.</ref>

In the second half of the twentieth century, the practice of exchanging cards was extended to all manner of gifts in the United States, usually from a man to a woman.Such gifts typically include [[rose]]s and [[chocolate]]s packed in a red satin, heart-shaped box. In the 1980s, the [[diamond]] industry began to promote Valentine's Day as an occasion for giving [[jewelry]]. The day has come to be associated with a generic [[Platonic love|platonic]] greeting of "Happy Valentine's Day." As a joke, Valentine's Day is also referred to as "[[Singles Awareness Day]]." In some North American [[elementary school]]s, children decorate classrooms, exchange cards, and eat sweets. The greeting cards of these students often mention what they appreciate about each other.

The rise of Internet popularity at the turn of the millennium is creating new traditions. Millions of people use, every year, digital means of creating and sending Valentine's Day greeting messages such as [[e-cards]], [[love coupons]] or printable greeting cards.

{{Love table}}
Valentine's Day has regional traditions in the UK. In [[Norfolk]], a character called 'Jack' Valentine knocks on the rear door of houses leaving sweets and presents for children. Although he was leaving treats, many children were scared of this mystical person. In Wales, many people celebrate [[Dydd Santes Dwynwen]] (''St Dwynwen's Day'') on January 25 instead of or as well as St Valentine's Day. The day commemorates [[Dwynwen|St Dwynwen]], the patron saint of Welsh lovers. In [[France]], a traditionally [[Catholic]] country, Valentine's Day is known simply as "[[Saint Valentine|Saint Valentin]]", and is celebrated in much the same way as other western countries.
In [[Spain]] Valentine's Day is known as "[[Saint Valentine|San Valent<U+00ED>n]]" and is celebrated the same way as in the U.K, although in Catalonia it is largely superseded by similar festivities of rose and/or book giving on [[San Jordi|La Diada de Sant Jordi]] (Saint George's Day). In [[Portugal]] it's more commom refered to it as "Dia dos Namorados" (Boy/Girlfriend's Day).

In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], Valentine's Day (14 Feb) is known as ''Valentinsdag''. It is not celebrated to a large extent, but a lot people take time to eat a romantic dinner with their partner, to send a card to a secret love or give a red rose to their loved one. In Sweden it is called ''Alla hj<U+00E4>rtans dag'' ("All Hearts' Day") and was launched in the 1960s by the flower industry's commercial interests, and due to influence of American culture. It is not an official holiday, but its celebration is recognized and sales of cosmetics and flowers for this holiday are only bested by those for Mother's Day.

In [[Finland]] Valentine's Day is called ''Yst<U+00E4>v<U+00E4>np<U+00E4>iv<U+00E4>'' which translates into "Friend's day". As the name indicates, this day is more about remembering all your friends, not only your loved ones. In [[Estonia]] Valentine's Day is called ''S<U+00F5>brap<U+00E4>ev'', which has a similar meaning.

In [[Slovenia]], a proverb says that "St Valentine brings the keys of roots," so on February 14, plants and flowers start to grow. Valentine's Day has been celebrated as the day when the first works in the vineyards and on the fields commence. It is also said that birds propose to each other or marry on that day. Nevertheless, it has only recently been celebrated as the day of love. The day of love is traditionally March 12, the [[Saint Gregory]]'s day. Another proverb says ''"Valentin - prvi spomladin"'' ("Valentine <U+2014> first saint of spring"), as in some places (especially [[White Carniola]]) Saint Valentine marks the beginning of spring.

In [[Romania]], the traditional holiday for lovers is [[Dragobete]], which is celebrated on February 24. It is named after a character from Romanian folklore who was supposed to be the son of [[Baba Dochia]]. Part of his name is the word ''drag'' ("dear"), which can also be found in the word ''dragoste'' ("love"). In recent years, Romania has also started celebrating Valentine's Day, despite already having Dragobete as a traditional holiday. This has drawn backlash from many groups, reputable persons and institutions<ref>[http://www.cultura.ro/Documents.aspx?ID=190 Valentine`s Day versus Dragobete] {{ro icon}}</ref> but also nationalist organizations like [[Noua Dreapta|Noua Dreapt<U+01CE>]], who condemn Valentine's Day for being superficial, commercialist and imported Western [[kitsch]].

Valentine's Day is called ''Sevgililer G<U+00FC>n<U+00FC>'' in [[Turkey]], which translates into "Sweethearts' Day".

According to Jewish tradition the 15th day of the month of Av - [[Tu B'Av]] (usually late August) is the festival of love. In ancient times girls would wear white dresses and dance in the vineyards, where the boys would be waiting for them ([[Mishna]] Taanith end of Chapter 4). In modern Israeli culture this is a popular day to pronounce love, propose marriage and give gifts like cards or flowers.

==== Central and South America ====
In [[Guatemala]], Valentine's Day is known as "D<U+00ED>a del Amor y la Amistad" (Day of Love and Friendship). Although it is similar to the United States' version in many ways, it is also common to see people do "acts of appreciation" for their friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactomagazine.com/sanvalentin0203.htm|title=D<U+00ED>a del Amor y la Amistad<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

In [[Brazil]], the ''Dia dos Namorados'' (lit. "Day of the Enamored", or "Boyfriends'/Girlfriends' Day") is celebrated on June 12, when couples exchange gifts, chocolates, cards and flower bouquets. This day was chosen probably because it is the day before the [[Festa junina]]<U+2019>s [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony's]] day, known there as the ''marriage saint'', when traditionally many single women perform popular rituals, called ''simpatias'', in order to find a good husband or boyfriend. The February 14's Valentine's Day is not celebrated at all, mainly for [[Culture of Brazil|cultural]] and [[commerce|commercial]] reasons, since it usually falls too little before or after [[Carnival]], a major floating holiday in Brazil <U+2014> long regarded as a holiday of [[Promiscuity|sex]] and [[wikt:debauchery|debauchery]] by many in the country<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900628,00.html The Psychology of Carnaval], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 14, 1969</ref> <U+2014> that can fall anywhere from early February to early March.

In [[Venezuela]], in 2009, President [[Hugo Chavez]] said in a meeting to his supporters for the upcoming referendum vote on [[February 15]], that "since on the 14th, there will be no time of doing nothing, nothing or next to nothing&nbsp;... maybe a little kiss or something very superficial", he recommended people to celebrate a week of love after the referendum vote.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l43rqt12KcE Video of Chavez joking about Valentine's day], youtube.com, 2009-01-31</ref>

In most of [[South America]] the ''D<U+00ED>a del amor y la amistad'' (lit. "Love and Friendship Day") and the ''Amigo secreto'' ("Secret friend") are quite popular and usually celebrated together on the 14 of February (one exception is [[Colombia]], where it is celebrated on September 20). The latter consists of randomly assigning to each participant a recipient who is to be given an anonymous gift (similar to the Christmas tradition of [[Secret Santa]]).

=== Asia ===
Thanks to a concentrated marketing effort, Valentine's Day is celebrated in some Asian countries with [[Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Singapore]]ans, [[China|Chinese]] and [[South Korea]]ns spending the most money on Valentine's gifts.<ref>Domingo, Ronnel.

In [[Japan]], in 1960, [[Morinaga & Company|Morinaga]], one of the biggest Japanese [[confectionery]] companies, originated the present custom that only women may give chocolates to men. In particular, [[Office lady|office ladies]] will give chocolate to their co-workers. One month later, in March 14, there is the [[White Day]], created by the Japanese National Confectionery Industry Association as a "reply day", where men are expected to return the favour to those who gave them chocolates on Valentine's Day. Unlike western countries, gifts such as candies, flowers, or [[dinner date]]s are uncommon. It has become an obligation for many women to give chocolates to all male co-workers. A man's popularity can be measured for how many chocolate they receive on that day; the amount of chocolate received is a touchy issue for men, and they will only comment on it after getting assurances that the amount will not be made public. This is known as ''giri-choko'' (<U+7FA9><U+7406><U+30C1><U+30E7><U+30B3>), from the words ''[[Giri (Japanese)|giri]]'' ("obligation") and ''choko'', ("chocolate"), with unpopular co-workers receiving only "ultra-obligatory" ''ch<U+014D>-giri choko'' cheap chocolate. This contrasts with ''honmei-choko'' (<U+672C><U+547D><U+30C1><U+30E7><U+30B3>); chocolate given to a loved one. Friends, especially girls, may exchange chocolate referred to as ''tomo-choko'' (<U+53CB><U+30C1><U+30E7><U+30B3>); from ''tomo'' meaning "friend".<ref>{{cite book | title = Office Ladies and Salaried Men: Power, Gender, and Work in Japanese Companies | author = Yuko Ogasawara | edition = illustrated | editor = [[University of California Press]] | year = 1998 | isbn = 0520210441 | pages = 98<U+2013>113,142<U+2013>154,156,163 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9_yjfAZo4jIC&pg=PA98&vq=valentine+day&dq=japan+chocolate+saint+valentin&lr=&client=opera&hl=es&source=gbs_search_s&cad=0 | publisher = Univ. of California Press | location = Berkeley }}</ref>

In [[South Korea]], women give chocolate to men on February 14, and men give non-chocolate candy to women on March 14. On April 14 (Black Day), those who did not receive anything on the 14th of Feb or March go to a Chinese restaurant to eat black noodles and "mourn" their single life. Koreans also celebrate [[Pepero Day]] on November 11, when young couples give each other Pepero cookies. The date '11/11' is intended to resemble the long shape of the cookie. The 14th of every month marks a love-related day in Korea, although most of them are obscure. From January to December: Candle Day, Valentine's Day, White Day, [[Black Day]], Rose Day, Kiss Day, Silver Day, Green Day, Music Day, Wine Day, Movie Day, and Hug Day.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

In [[China]], the common situation is the man gives chocolate, flowers or both to the woman that he loves. In Chinese, Valentine's Day is called ({{zh-stp|s=<U+60C5><U+4EBA><U+8282>|t=<U+60C5><U+4EBA><U+7BC0>|p=q<U+012B>ng r<U+00E9>n ji<U+00E9>}}).

In [[Philippines|the Philippines]], Valentine's Day is called "Araw ng mga Puso" or "Hearts Day". It is usually marked by a steep increase in the prices of flowers.

==== Similar Asian traditions ====
In [[Chinese culture]], there is an older observance related to lovers. It is called "[[Qi Xi|The Night of Sevens]]" ({{zh-cp|c=<U+4E03><U+5915>|p=Qi Xi}}). According to the legend, the [[Altair|Cowherd star]] and the [[Vega|Weaver Maid star]] are normally separated by the [[milky way]] (river) but are allowed to meet by crossing it on the 7th day of the 7th month of the [[Chinese calendar]].

An observance on the same day in [[Korea]] is called [[Chilseok]], but its association with romance has long faded.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

In Japan, a slightly different version of <U+4E03><U+5915> (called [[Tanabata]], which is said to mean <U+68DA><U+6A5F> a weaver for a god) is celebrated, on July 7 on the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The legend behind it is similar to the Chinese one. {{Fact|date=February 2009}} However, it is never regarded that the celebration is even remotely related with the St. Valentine's Day or lovers giving gifts to each other.

In [[India]] Valentine's Day is explicitly discouraged by Hindu fundamentalists.<ref name="battle" /> Each year there are violent clashes between shopkeepers dealing in Valentine related items and [[Shiv Sena]] die-hards.<ref name="battle">{{cite news | title = V-Day turns into battlefield | date = 2009-02-14 | author = Arkadev Ghoshal & Hemangi Keneka | work = [[Times of India]] | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Nagpur/V-Day_turns_into_battlefield/articleshow/4127811.cms }}</ref> Especially in [[Mumbai]] and surrounding areas [[Bal Thackeray]] and others sent out signals before the day warning people not having to do anything with Valentine. Those who violate this are dealt with harshly by baton-holding brigands of Shiv Sena who lark in public places especailly parks etc. chasing young people holding hands and others suspected to be lovers.

=== The Middle East ===
Today in [[Iran]] Valentine's day is currently celebrated in [[Iran]] despite some restrictions made by government; young Iranian boys and girls are seen on this day going out and buying gifts and celebrating.

In [[Saudi Arabia]] in 2008, religious police banned the sale of all Valentine's Day items, telling shop workers to remove any red items, as the day is considered an un-[[Islam]]ic holiday. This ban created a [[black market]] of [[roses]] and [[wrapping paper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7239005.stm|title=Saudis clamp down on valentines|author=BBC News}}</ref>
