From 1886-1907 he taught as a private lecturer (Privatdozent) at the Eidgen<U+00F6>ssische Polytechnikum (today known as [[ETH Zurich]] or the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology).  In 1890-91, he was also Associate Professor at the University of Z<U+00FC>rich. His focus of research was [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], a Swiss [[Pedagogy | pedagogue]]; Karl Otto co-founded the [http://stiftung.pestalozzianum.ch Pestalozzianum Research Institute].<ref name="matrikel" />  In 1890, Karl Otto was granted Z<U+00FC>rich citizenship.

Otto Frederick's mother, Luise Pupikofer, was born [[2 Mar]] [[1844]] in [[Weinfelden]], Canton Thurgau, Switzerland to Johannes and Sophia (Scherrer) Pupikofer.<ref>{{Citation |title = Kirchenbuch, 1654-1974, Evangelisch-Reformierte Kirche Bussnang (Thurgau) | volume = (film) 0958734 | publisher = Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}</ref>  She died [[18 Dec]] [[1918]] in [[Bischofszell]], Canton Thurgau.<ref name="sealings" />  Apart from Otto Frederick, children of Karl Otto and Luise include Karl Rudolf (b. 5 Feb 1870, Z<U+00FC>rich), Barbara Luise (17 Jun 1871 - 16 Oct 1871), and Marie Julie (23 Jul 1872 - 30 Jun 1938).

Otto Hunziker spent many early years in [[Goldbach, Zurich | Goldbach]], part of K<U+00FC>snacht.  He graduated from a Swiss agricultural college at age 19.  He might have been influenced by Dr. Niklaus Gerber who studied at the University of Zurich and worked for 2 years at the Swiss-American Milk Co. in Little Falls, NY, USA.  Dr. Gerber developed the Gerber method for analyzing fat content in milk.  This was one focal area for O. F. Hunziker.  In 1893 Otto Frederick Hunziker [[Emigration | emigrated]] to the [[United States]].

In the U.S., O. F. Hunziker initially worked on a dairy farm near [[Attleboro]], [[Massachusetts]].  To improve his English and commercial skills, he studied at [[Bryant_%26_Stratton_College | Bryant and Stratton]] Business College, Providence, RI in 1896.  He returned to Switzerland briefly in 1898 before returning to receive a B.S.

==Professorship at Purdue==
In 1905, Mr. Hunziker accepted a position at [[Purdue University]] in West Lafayette, Indiana as head of Purdue's [http://www.ces.purdue.edu/dairy Dairy] Department.<ref>Cornell Alumni News, [http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3527/34/012_07.pdf Vol XII, No. 7], (10 Nov 1909), p. 82</ref>  Dairy departments were relatively new at American colleges.  The first dairy school in the U.S. was created at the University of Wisconsin in 1890.  Professor Hunziker led Purdue's dairy department through significant growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adsa.org/centennial/posters/17684_purdue.pdf |title= A Century of Dairy Science at Purdue University |accessdate=2008-05-29|last= Chambers|first= James V|format=PDF|publisher=American Dairy Science Association|quote=With the vision and leadership of Otto F. Hunziker, dairy science and technology evolved at Purdue University.  In 1905 Purdue experienced a sharp growth in its agricultural programs.  Professor Hunziker seized upon the opportunities to serve this growing agricultural sector.  He identified needs for developing educational programs to better educate dairymen and needs for instituting adequate dairy laws for the protection of the dairy industry.  His scientific treatises dealt with the solution of problems on dairy farms and in dairy plants.  His research established accuracy of glassware and provided standard methods for the Babcock fat test of milk and cream.  He planned Smith Hall and adjacent creamery which was built in 1913.  A champion for the dairy industry, he won recognition in the fields of butter making, condensed milk and dried milk.  He incorporated scientific principles into every step of the butter-making process.  His textbooks were used by agricultural universities in dairy courses throughout the United States and in other dairy countries.}} From the abstract: "During the organizational year of the American Dairy Science Association (ADSA), Otto F. Hunziker led the dairy program at Purdue University.  A charter member of ADSA and its third president, Dr. Hunziker's brilliant career as a scientist, teacher and author is recognized throughout the world.  At Purdue he provided leadership in developing educational programs to better educate dairymen.  His research programs established the accuracy of glassware and provided standard methods for the Babcock fat test of milk and cream.  He planned Smith Hall, which was built in 1913 to provide facilities for teaching, research and extension work."</ref><ref>The 1906 Purdue yearbook (the Debris Vol 18) lists: "Otto Fred Hunziker, Instructor in Dairying; B.S.A., Cornell University, 1900; M.S.A., 1901; Sigma Xi".{{cite book |title=Debris |url=http://earchives.lib.purdue.edu/u?/debris,9107 |format=JP2 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |volume=18 |year=1906 |publisher=Purdue University |location=West Lafayette, IN |pages=54}}  The only other "dairying" faculty listed is one Hubert Everett Van Norman who is listed as "Resigned".  The 1907 Debris indicates Otto Fred Hunziker was promoted to Associate Professor; the only other "dairying" faculty is one John deMoss Jarvis, Assistant in Dairying.  The following year, Otto Fred Hunziker is listed as a full professor.  In 1910, Otto's position is listed as Professor of Dairy Husbandry and as a member of the Official Dairy Instructors' Association (ODIA).  John deMoss Jarvis remains the only other dairy faculty, but became an instructor in 1909.  In the 1911-14 yearbooks, Otto Fred Hunziker is listed as President of the ODIA as well as member of the Indiana Academy of Science, Indiana State Dairy Association, and Indiana Jersey Cattle Club.  The 1911 Debris also lists two dairy instructors and one assistant.  In the new "Experiment Station" section, O. F. Hunziker is listed "Chief of Dairy Husbandry".  The 1914 Debris lists Alpha Zeta and the Purdue Dairy Club for the first time; apart from Professor Hunziker, two associates and an assistant are listed as faculty members of the dairy club.</ref>

In the summer of 1906, O. F. Hunziker was among 18 teachers and investigators meeting at the University of Illinois, Urbana, to found what was then known as National Association of Dairy Instructors and Investigators.  (The following year, this association changed its name to "Official Dairy Instructors' Association" and, in 1916, changed its name to American Dairy Science Association".<ref>{{cite journal | title = Report of Committee on Change of Name | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 148-149 | publisher = [[American Dairy Science Association]] | url = http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/1/2/148.pdf | accessdate = 2008-06-19}}</ref>)  From 1910 to 1926, Otto Hunziker chaired the Committee on Official Methods of Testing Milk and Cream for Butterfat of the [[American Dairy Science Association]] (ADSA).  In 1911, this committee met in Washington DC with the [[United States Department of Agriculture | U.S. Bureau of Dairying]], the [[American National Standards Institute | U.S. Bureau of Standards]] and manufacturers of glassware.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Herreid | first=Ernest O | title = The Babcock Test; A Review of the Literature | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 342-343 | publisher = American Dairy Science Association | url =http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/25/4/335.pdf | accessdate = 2008-06-19}}</ref>  Standard specifications for [[Babcock test | Babcock glassware]] were published as a result of this meeting.  Professor Hunziker actively pursued numerous improvements to the testing methodology.  It is difficult to overstate the importance that these specifications and efforts had on improving the quality and safety of dairy products.  Otto Hunziker was the third president of [[American Dairy Science Association | ADSA]] from 1910 through 1911.  During Professor Hunziker's presidency, ADSA also created a national score card for scoring dairies, standardized dairy judging contests, secured scholarships for student contests, improved national milk standards, developed ties with breed associations, and provided fora for industry discussions on dairy instruction and extension services.

[[image:Smith_Hall_3.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Smith Hall, [[Purdue University]] - 1913]]Apart from application of improved [[pedagogy]] and scientific methodology, Professor O. F. Hunziker oversaw planning and construction of Smith Hall, the building which thereafter housed Purdue's dairy manufacturing group, [[Cooperative extension service | extension service]], and creamery.  While at Purdue, he published over 50 bulletins, leaflets, and scientific treatises addressing dairy farm and plant problems.<ref name="memorial" />  In 1917, O. F. Hunziker left Purdue to manage manufacturing and research at the [[Blue Valley Creamery Company]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].  At Purdue, the Professor O. F.

==Professional Life==
[[image:OF_Hunziker.jpg|left|thumb|O. F. Hunziker]]Professor Hunziker wrote dairy articles and textbooks used throughout the world, developed dairy curricula, advocated for dairy laws, and developed standard testing methodology.  In particular, Dr. Hunziker authored ''The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory'', a well-known text in the industry that enjoyed at least three editions (1920, 1927, 1940).<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.toronto.ca/health/tfpc_regulatory.pdf | title= The Canadian Regulatory Process for Evaluating Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone in the Dairy Industry: A Critical Review | accessdate=2008-05-23 | author= Toronto Food Policy Council | year=2000 | month=09 | format=PDF | publisher= The City of [[Toronto]]}} ''The Butter Industry'' (or its author) was "recognized by the Ontario Department of Agriculture as an expert on butter quality".</ref>  A book that Dr. Hunziker originally self-published in 1914, ''Condensed milk and milk powder: prepared for the use of milk condenseries, dairy students and pure food departments'', was republished in a seventh edition in October 2007 by Cartwright Press.  According to one book review: "The popularity of this book may be judged by the fact that this is the fourth edition, the three previous editions having long since been exhausted. The book is the most important contribution on the condensed milk and milk powder industry. It should be in the library of the teacher, the student or factory man interested in any phase of the condensed milk and milk powder industry."<ref>{{cite journal | last= | first= | title = Book Review | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 505 | publisher = American Dairy Science Association | url =http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/9/5/505 | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref>  In the 1920's, O.F. Hunziker initiated a "dairy school over the air" - a radio program on [[WGN (AM) | WGN]] for which dairy experts were invited to discuss various issues.

For many years he was the dedicated member of the Journal Management Committee, nurturing the newly founded journal as if it were his very own.  As an administrator, author, and researcher, his presence at a meeting assured its success.  There was authority in his deliberate, well-chosen words.  He represented the dairy manufacturers of America five times at the world's dairy congresses - London, 1928; Copenhagen, 1931; Berlin, 1937; Stockholm, 1949; den Hague, 1953 - a record that stood for many years.  For his sustained enthusiasm for the American Dairy Science Association at home or abroad, he might well have been named 'Mr. ADSA'.  He too, was listed among the 'Ten Master Minds of Dairying'."</ref>  When the World's Dairy Congress was held in the U.S. in 1923, the [[United States Department of Agriculture | U.S. Department of Agriculture]] selected O.
