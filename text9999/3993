This article is about the '''History of St. Mary's College of Maryland''',  for the modern day school, see [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]]

[[St. Mary's College of Maryland]], originally known as '''St. Mary's Female Seminary''', began in 1840 as a [[secular]] state-sponsored boarding school for women. Since 1966 it has been a four-year public liberal arts college. Since 1992 it has been a designated public honors college. One of only two in the nation to hold such a distinction at the time.

The history spans from the early colonial days of St. Mary's City through to the present, including the establishment of religious tolerance and it's later loss, long periods of oppression followed by the expansion of freedom as the result of the [[American Civil War]], and through the 19th and 20th centuries to the modern day public honors college.

In its special research capacity,<ref name="ReferenceA">"Center for the Study of Democracy: Purpose and Inspiration for Our Work", St. Mary's College of Maryland, CFSOD, http://www.smcm.edu/democracy/about/index.html</ref> the school also researches and studies the following historic events and periods as they relate to the local area:<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Colonial St. Mary's City was actually only a town and at its peak had between 500 and 600 residents. However as the colony quickly expanded and settlements spread throughout the Eastern part of what is now Maryland, the town remained the capitol and representatives would travel from all over the colony to participate in the Maryland General Assembly, the colony's first legislative body.

The Colony was founded under a mandate by the colonial proprietor,  [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Cecil Calvert]], the second Lord Baltimore of England, that the new settlers engage in [[religious tolerance]] of each other.<ref name="Cecilius Calvert 1633"/><ref name="stmaryscity.org"/><ref name="Lois Green Carr 1671">Dr. Lois Green Carr, "Margaret Brent (ca. 1601-1671)", MSA SC 3520-2177, Archives of Maryland (Biographical Series), http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/002100/002177/html/bio.html</ref> The first settlers were both Protestant and Catholic during a time of persecution of Catholics.<ref name="Lois Green Carr 1671"/> This mandate was unprecedented at the time, as England had been wracked by religious conflict for centuries.

In 1634, at the time of the arrival of the first colonists, there was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village on the site that was a part of the Yaocomico branch of the [[Piscataway (tribe)|Piscataway Indian Nation]].<ref>"The Founding of St. Mary<U+2019>s City: The Colonists and the Yaocomaco", Historic St. Mary's City, [[co-educational|http://hsmcwitchottproject.blogspot.com/2011_06_01_archive.html]]

When the colonists first came ashore, the paramount chief of the Yaocomico was already well aware of Europeans due to earlier contact with explorers and traders, as well as news from Virginia tribes that were already co-existing with British colonial settlements. The chief was keen to establish trade with the English and he was also in the process of relocating his people due to war with another tribe. Soon after the new colonists arrived in what is now St. Mary's City, he ordered the Indian village cleared and he sold it to the settlers.<ref name="Maryland State Archives Website 20032" /><ref>"The Founding of St. Mary<U+2019>s City: The Colonists and the Yaocomaco", Historic St. Mary's City, [[Maryland|http://hsmcwitchottproject.blogspot.com/2011_06_01_archive.html]]

The colonists initially lived in Indian longhouses from the prior village, along with some remaining Yaocomico people who had stayed 
behind to help them.

In the male-dominated frontier environment of the colonies,<ref name="Lois Green Carr 1671"/><ref name="Notable Maryland Women 1977, page 5"/> far away from the courts of England, Brent was also forced to defend her legal right to manage her own estate before the Maryland Assembly.

During the 1700s the institution of slavery grew massively in Maryland<ref name="College Park page 7"/> and became more and more legally entrenched.<ref name="College Park page 7"/> By the late 1600s there had been about 1,000 slaves in all the different settlements of the Maryland colony combined, but during the first 75 years of the 1700s, the number of enslaved people increased to nearly 100,000, and kept growing.<ref name="College Park page 7"/>

====Maryland penal codes (anti-Catholic laws)====

From 1700 until the 1820s, numerous laws were put in place to "penalize" Catholics for practicing their faith, hence they were called the "penal codes".<ref name="Francis Graham Lee page 22"/>  Catholics were denied the [[right to vote]] in Maryland through most of the 1700s.<ref name="Francis Graham Lee page 22"/><ref name="Brugger">Robert J.

There were also periods where laws denied Catholics the right to purchase or inherit land in Maryland. Catholics were also not allowed to start their own schools.<ref name="Francis Graham Lee page 22"/> Wealthy Catholics would secretly send their children abroad to get religious education, but to discourage this, Maryland laws were passed fining parents who did this.<ref>Francis Graham Lee, "All Imaginable Liberty: The Religious Liberty Clauses of the First Amendment", page 359, University Press of America (June 6, 1995)</ref>  In order to discourage further importation of [[Irish people|Irish]] indentured servants, who were largely Catholic, a prohibitive tax was imposed to try to prevent bringing any more of them to Maryland.<ref name="Brugger" />  Many Catholics hid their faith and worshiped in secret. Others converted to Protestantism or left the state.

Even after legal restrictions eased in the 1820s, hostility towards Catholics and religious tensions continued in Maryland until the first half of the 20th Century.<ref name="Brugger">Robert J.

They quickly won Kennedy's support and together they lobbied the Maryland State legislature. The legislature voted to create, fund and designate a [[nondenominational]] <ref name="Archaeology, Narrative 2012">"Archaeology, Narrative, and the Politics of the Past: The View from Southern Maryland", Page 68, Julia King, University of Tennessee Press; July 30, 2012, ISBN  1572338512, ISBN  978-1572338517</ref>  school in St. Mary's City as a "Living monument to religious freedom".<ref name="Archaeology, Narrative 2012"/> This was a milestone at the time, because only some ten years earlier had the last of Maryland's notorious anti-Catholic "penal codes" been revoked.

===The Monument School===

Due to its designation as a living monument to religious freedom and the founding of the Maryland colony, the school's nickname quickly became '''''The Monument School''''', and has remained so through to the present.  Within a few years the state also required equal representation of all three of the state's major religions on the school's board of trustees.

====Union troops in St. Mary's City====

The school was not a part of the plantation in St. Mary's City, but these events occurred next door to the school,<ref>"Slave Dwelling Project: Talk and Tour", St. Mary's College of Maryland, schedule of events, http://www.smcm.edu/calendar/events/index.php?com=detail&eID=3118</ref>  sometimes within sight of classroom or dorm windows. Students and faculty of the time were witnesses to some of the local history of this era, literally watching the historic struggle and eventually, the resulting expansion of human rights, visible out the windows of the school.

During the Civil War, Union troops occupied St. Mary's County, which like a large part of Maryland at the time, had Southern sympathies.<ref name="Civil War 2012">"Maryland Slaves in the Civil War: How it Happened in St. Mary<U+2019>s County", Terry Brock, November 12, 2012, https://hsmcdigshistory.org/walktogether/index.php/maryland-slaves-in-the-civil-war-how-it-happened-in-st-marys-county/</ref> Piers and wharfs in St. Mary's County were burned by Union forces in order to stop trade with the confederacy which was only across the Potomac River.<ref name="Civil War 2012"/> Brome's Wharf in St. Mary's City was also burned, as it was a part of what was by then the Brome-Howard Plantation, owned by Doctor Brome, a slave-owner and a likely confederate sympathizer. There is archeological evidence that the Union Army may have occupied the plantation for some time.<ref name="Civil War 2012"/> Records show that Brome later complained that Union troops had damaged his piano while ransacking the main plantation house.

Records show that one quarter of the 66 people living under slavery at Doctor Brome's plantation in St. Mary's City escaped during the Civil War<ref name="HSMC, Brome, Civil War">"All of Us Would Walk Together: Taking Freedom", Historic St. Mary's City, https://hsmcdigshistory.org/walktogether/index.php/project/escaping-with-the-military/</ref> and at least two of them then joined the Union Army.<ref name="HSMC, Brome, Civil War" /> Even before slavery was legally abolished, the Union Army had a policy allowing enslaved men to gain their freedom if they became Union soldiers.<ref name="HSMC, Brome, Civil War" /> Other records show that the total number of people living under slavery there during this time was 59.<ref>"Echoes from Past Generations" Anne Dowling Grulich for the Maryland Heritage Project, http://www.smcm.edu/rivergazette/archives/decjan09/echoes.html</ref>

====John Pendleton Kennedy helps lead political campaign for emancipation in Maryland====
Because Maryland was not in the confederacy, the emancipation proclamation did not apply to the state and slavery continued there.<ref name="Miranda S. Spivack 2013"/> Unlike the confederate states, President Lincoln was afraid to emancipate Maryland because he was concerned that would cause it to leave the Union and join the Confederacy, this is why he did not include Maryland in the Emancipation Proclamation. Only the state itself could end slavery at this point,<ref name="Miranda S. Spivack 2013"/> and this was not a certain outcome at all,<ref name="Miranda S. Spivack 2013"/> as Maryland was a [[slave state]] with strong confederate sympathies.<ref name="Miranda S. Spivack 2013"/> John Pendleton Kennedy and other antislavery leaders therefore organized a political gathering<U+2014>On December 16, 1863, a special meeting of the Central Committee of the Union Party of Maryland was called on the issue of slavery in the state<ref name="Maryland 1863"/> (The Union Party was a powerful political party in the state at the time).

Wilkinson, Julia A. King, "St. Mary's, A When-Did? Timeline",  page 16, http://www.smcm.edu/archives/documents/StMarysWhenDidTimeline.pdf</ref>]]

From the founding of the school until 1933, students traveled to the school each year by steamboat,<ref name="Fausz page 73"/> coming down the [[Chesapeake Bay]] from Annapolis and Baltimore.<ref name="Janet Butler Haugaard page 16"/> This usually meant an overnight trip.<ref name="Fausz page 54"/>

The roads of St. Mary's County were largely unpaved and notoriously treacherous until the 1930s, and so water transportation was the best way to access the county. The school also received its mail and supplies by boat. Steamboats would pull up to the school dock, just below the old Statehouse grounds, as often as twice a week. For a fee they would also carry students and faculty on outings over to Piney Point, or to Virginia.

By the 1930s, the steamboat service to the school was more of a tradition than a necessity, and it was losing clientele Bay-wide due to the increased usage of automobiles.<ref name="Fausz page 73"/> The main roads leading to the college were also by then paved. So when a storm destroyed the school dock in 1934,<ref name="Fausz page 73"/> the school let go of the steamboat service and transportation to the college was thereafter only by automobile.<ref name="Fausz page 73"/>

France then embarked on a determined and ultimately successful lobbying campaign in Annapolis.

===School gains prominence in archeology and historical research===

'''1968: Establishment of St. Mary's City Commission (later named "Historic Mary's City"):''' The St. Mary's City Commission was charged with archeological and historical research of St. Mary's City and its rich colonial past, as well as its critical roles in the development of democracy in Maryland and North America as a whole. The commission was also charged with developing historic interpretation programs for the general public.

Although a separate institution from he school, over  time, St. Mary's College and Historic st. Mary's City became highly interdependent institutions.<ref>"Anthropology Department: Historic St. Mary's City", St. Mary's College of Maryland describes close and multi-leveled relationship between Historic St. Mary's City and St. Mary's College of Maryland http://www.smcm.edu/anthropology/historic_smc.html</ref><ref>"Archaeology, Narrative, and the Politics of the Past: The View from Southern Maryland", Page 41, Julia King, University of Tennessee Press; July 30, 2012, ISBN 1572338512, ISBN 978-1572338517</ref>

====Influence on Washington's acting career====

This experience had a lasting influence on the course of Washington's acting career, as he later sought out numerous historical roles, including portrayals of [[Steve Biko]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Rubin "Hurricane" Carter]], [[Herman Boone]] and [[Melvin B. Tolson]].

Washington also later won an [[academy award]] for his role in the film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' where he played the part of Private Silas Trip, who served in a [[United States Colored Troops]] regiment during the American Civil War.

====Historic St. Mary's City starts living history program, involving student actors====

This may have had a lasting influence on Historic St. Mary's as well, although after some debate, the commission at the time discouraged the state for some years afterwards from allowing fictionalized historical theater productions in the historic area. The commission later secured funding for a [[living history]] program, including use of period [[actors]] in order to interpret area history to the public.

The living history program has continued in Historic St. Mary's City for over 30 years, involving students from St. Mary's College of Maryland in acting roles that interpret area history.

Lewis was drawn to the school by its goal of developing a public liberal arts college into an institution that could compete academically with elite private colleges. He served as president from 1982 to 1996 and oversaw the largest advancement of the school's standing in its history. The school went on to win numerous top national rankings and became nationally recognized.

Lewis himself had grown up in a blue collar family in Warwick Rhode Island, his father only had an eighth grade education and so Lewis was in the first generation of his family to attend college. Initially he wasn't able to stay engaged with his studies and he dropped out, but later, after a period of military service, he returned to pursuing an education, following through all the way to obtaining a Doctorate degree and then becoming an educator and later a college administrator. He was also a noted and very prolific poet in his younger days.

During his time as president, Lewis oversaw an expansion of the Brent scholars program for first generation college students. He also oversaw a more than doubling of the school's African-American student population from 6% in 1982, to 14% in 1992.<ref name="nacubo.org">"Trading Dollars for Independence" ''See section entitled "Autonomy Woes"'', Business Officer magazine, National Association of University and College Business Officers, Laurie Stickelmaier, http://www.nacubo.org/Business_Officer_Magazine/Magazine_Archives/April_2004/Trading_Dollars_for_Independence.html</ref> During this era, the State Legislature also charged the school with a mission to remain affordable to public education sector students,<ref name="chronicle.com"/> while offering a Liberal Arts education normally only available at private liberal arts colleges.<ref name="chronicle.com"/>

'''Growing pains:''' The college struggled to meet this cost containment goal, as it had also been required by the state to grow considerably at the same time, across numerous dimensions, in order to fulfill its new role as the state's public honors college.<ref name="nacubo.org"/> This era also saw steady increases in tuition.<ref name="nacubo.org"/>

====2013: African-American student enrollment hits record low====

in 2013, African-American student enrollment hit a record low of 7%. A major reason cited is growing tuition and a feeling that the state is not funding the schools adequately. Ivy league schools are also competing heavily for top minority students. First generation college students of all races come from families still recovering from the recession.

By spring 2014, the number had rebounded slightly to 8%. The college has been undergoing a multi-front effort to to greatly increase African-American student enrollment.

====2014: School's first African-American President appointed====
