The '''Swords and Ploughshares Museum''' is a private [[military museum]] located south of the village of [[Kars, Ontario|Kars]], [[Ontario]].<ref name="OMAREF">{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title = ''Ontario Museum Association - Museum Guide'' | publisher = Ontario Museum Association | year = 2011 | url = http://www.museumsontario.com/en/58//88?searchFor=2116 | format = Web | accessdate = 2012-01-12 }}</ref> The Museum is focused on a specific aspect of [[Canada|Canadian]] [[military history]]: the Citizen Soldier (the [[Militiaman]] and [[Reservist]]) at peace and at war. The Museum uses vehicles and artifacts to demonstrate how they could be adapted and used by Citizen Soldiers for both [[military]] and [[civilian]] purposes. For example, a [[Ram tank]] from [[World War Two]] that was modified after the war to serve as a [[snowplow]] was a featured display at the Museum for many years.<ref name="M3snowplow">{{cite web | last = Spoelstra | first = Hanno | title = ''The Sherman Register'' | publisher = Hanno Spoelstra | year = 2011 | url = http://web.inter.nl.net/users/spoelstra/g104/ploughshare.htm | format = Web | accessdate = 2012-01-12 }}</ref>

Amongst the artifacts and equipment that the Museum displays is a 1942 [[Bofors 40mm]] Light Anti-Aircraft Gun which is maintained as a living monument and memorial for [[Canada|Canadian]] [[anti-aircraft]] [[gunners]].<ref name="40mmBofors">{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title = ''Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery'' | publisher = www.artillery.net | year = 2008 | url = http://www.artillery.net/new/hergunkars40mm.html | format = Web | accessdate = 2012-01-12 }}</ref>

== History==
The Museum was originally formed in 1987 by [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] (now [[Major]]) M.T. Calnan and Captain M.J. Hilash, [[military history]] enthusiasts and private collectors of [[militaria]].<ref name="SPhistory">{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title = ''Swords and Ploughshares Museum - Background'' | publisher = Swords and Ploughshares Museum | year = 2011 | url = http://www.calnan.com/swords/backgrnd.html | format = Web | accessdate = 2012-01-12 }}</ref> The two combined their efforts and collections to form the Swords and Ploughshares Museum so that they could display their artifacts and further public knowledge of [[Canada|Canadian]] [[military history]]. Land was purchased south of [[Kars, Ontario|Kars]], [[Ontario]] in the late 1980's with construction of a steel building to house the vehicles following in the summer of 1991.

== Outreach Program ==
The Museum does not have a large number of fixed displays and prefers to use [[living history]] practices to provide interactive displays and demonstrations. This includes participating along with [[Historical reenactment|historical re-enactors]] in special commemorative events such as the 50th Anniversary of [[Normandy landings|D-day]] Parade held in [[Ottawa]] in 1994 and the 64th Anniversary of the [[Battle of Britain]] held at the [[Canada Aviation and Space Museum|National Aviation Museum]] in 2004.<ref name="britainparade">{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title = ''Royal Canadian Air Force'' | publisher = Department of National Defence | year = 2008 | url = http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/v2/netpub/index-eng.asp?rid=1000-FA2004-0108a | format = Web | accessdate = 2012-01-12 }}</ref> The Museum also regularly participates in [[Canada Day]] parades in nearby communities such as [[Kemptville]] and [[Merrickville]] as well as in other events such as the [[Richmond, Ontario|Richmond]] Fair and the [[Kars, Ontario|Kars]] Fair.

== Media Appearances ==
A brief interview and [[video]] segment on the Museum was featured in the December 15th, 2008 edition of the ''[[Canadian Army]] News''.<ref name="armynews">{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title = ''Army News'' | publisher = Department of National Defence | year = 2008 | url = http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/land-terre/news-nouvelles/story-reportage-eng.asp?id=3102 | format = Web | accessdate = 2012-01-12 }}</ref>
