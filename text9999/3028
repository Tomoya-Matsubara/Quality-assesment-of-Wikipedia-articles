The '''IEEE 1394 interface''' is a [[serial communications|serial bus]] [[interface standard]] for high-speed communications and [[isochronous]] real-time data transfer, frequently used by [[personal computer]]s, as well as in [[digital audio]], [[digital video]], [[automotive]], and [[aeronautics]] applications. The interface is also known by the brand names of '''FireWire''' ([[Apple Inc.]]), '''i.LINK''' ([[Sony]]), and '''Lynx''' ([[Texas Instruments]]).  IEEE 1394 replaced parallel [[Small Computer System Interface|SCSI]] in many applications, because of lower [[implementation]] costs and a simplified, more adaptable [[cabling]] system.  The 1394 standard also defines a [[backplane]] interface, though this is not as widely used.

IEEE 1394 has been adopted as the [[High Definition Audio-Video Network Alliance]] (HANA) standard connection interface for A/V (audio/visual) component communication and control.<ref>[http://www.hanaalliance.org/docs/whitepaper121405.php About HANA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> FireWire is also available in wireless, [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]], and [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] versions using the isochronous protocols.

Since the mid 1990s, consumer grade [[camcorder]]s had included a four-[[circuit (electronic)|circuit]] 1394 interface, though, except for premium models, this is becoming less common.  It remains the primary transfer mechanism for almost all high end professional audio and video equipment.  Since 2003 many computers intended for home or professional audio/video use have built-in FireWire/i.LINK ports, especially prevalent with [[Sony]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s computers and the older [[iPod]]s.  The legacy (alpha) 1394 port is also available on premium retail [[motherboards]].

==History and development==
[[Image:FireWire cables.jpg|thumb|300px|4-circuit (left) and 6-circuit (right) FireWire 400 alpha connectors]]
[[Image:IEEE 1394 Firewire PCI Expansion Card Digon3.jpg|thumb|300px|a pair of 6-circuit alpha connectors on the edge of an [[expansion card]]]]

FireWire is [[Apple Inc.]]'s name for the [[IEEE]] 1394 High Speed Serial Bus. It was initiated by Apple and developed by the IEEE P1394 Working Group, largely driven by contributions from Apple, although major contributions were also made by engineers from [[Texas Instruments]], [[Sony]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[IBM]], and [[INMOS]]/[[SGS]] [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] (now [[STMicroelectronics]]).

Apple intended FireWire to be a serial replacement for the parallel [[SCSI]] (Small Computer System Interface) bus while also providing connectivity for digital audio and video equipment. Apple's development began in the late 1980s, later presented to the IEEE,<ref name="teener">{{cite web|url=http://www.teener.com/firewire_FAQ/|title=What is Firewire|last=Teener|first=Michael J.|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> and was completed in 1995. As of 2007, IEEE 1394 is a composite of four documents: the original IEEE Std. 1394-1995, the [[#FireWire 400 (IEEE 1394a)|IEEE Std. 1394a-2000]] amendment, the [[#FireWire 800 (IEEE 1394b)|IEEE Std. 1394b-2002]] amendment, and the [[#FireWire S800T (IEEE 1394c)|IEEE Std. 1394c-2006]] amendment. On June 12, 2008, all these amendments as well as errata and some technical updates were incorporated into a superseding standard IEEE Std. 1394-2008.<ref name="1394-2008">{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4659231 |journal=IEEE Std. 1394-2008 |title=IEEE Standard for a High-Performance Serial Bus |date=2008-10-21 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4659233| id=ISBN 978-0-7381-5771-9}}</ref>

Sony's implementation of the system, known as "i.LINK" used a smaller connector with only the four signal circuits, omitting the two circuits which provide power to the device in favor of a separate power connector. This style was later added into the 1394a amendment.<ref name="teener"/> This port is sometimes labeled "S100" or "S400" to indicate speed in Mbit/s.

The system is commonly used for connection of [[data storage device]]s and [[DV]] (digital video) cameras, but is also popular in industrial systems for [[machine vision]] and professional audio systems. It is preferred over the more common [[USB]] for its greater effective speed and power distribution capabilities, and because it does not need a computer host. Perhaps more importantly, FireWire makes full use of all SCSI capabilities and has high sustained data transfer rates, a feature especially important for audio and video editors. Benchmarks show that the sustained data transfer rates are higher for FireWire than for [[USB 2.0]], especially on Apple [[Mac OS X]] with more varied results on [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref name="FireWire&nbsp;<U+2014> USB Comparison">[http://www.usb-ware.com/firewire-vs-usb.htm FireWire - USB Comparison]</ref><ref>[http://www.tomshardware.com/2004/04/02/go_external/ Go External: FireWire 800]</ref>

However, the royalty which Apple Inc. and other [[patent]] holders initially demanded from users of FireWire (US$0.25 per [[end-user]] system) and the more expensive hardware needed to implement it (US$1<U+2013>$2), both of which have since been dropped, have prevented FireWire from displacing USB in low-end mass-market computer peripherals, where product cost is a major constraint.<ref name="teener"/>

==Technical specifications==
{{see also|Coding system of FireWire}}
FireWire can connect up to 63 [[computer peripheral|peripherals]] in a [[network topology#tree|tree topology]] (as opposed to Parallel SCSI's [[electrical bus]] topology). It allows [[peer-to-peer]] device communication&nbsp;<U+2014> such as communication between a [[Scanner (computing)|scanner]] and a [[Computer printer|printer]]&nbsp;<U+2014> to take place without using system memory or the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. FireWire also supports multiple [[server (computing)|hosts]] per bus. It is designed to support [[Plug and play]] and [[hot swapping]]. The copper cable it uses (1394's most common implementation) can be up to {{convert|4.5|m}} long and is more flexible than most Parallel SCSI cables.  In its six-[[circuit (electronic)|circuit]] or nine-circuit variations, it can supply up to 45 [[watt]]s of power per port at up to 30 volts, allowing moderate-consumption devices to operate without a separate power supply.

FireWire devices implement the [[ISO/IEC 13213]] "configuration ROM" model for device configuration and identification, to provide [[plug-and-play]] capability. All FireWire devices are identified by an IEEE [[EUI-64]] unique identifier (an extension of the 48-bit [[Ethernet]] [[MAC address]] format) in addition to well-known codes indicating the type of device and the [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]] it supports.

===Operating system support===
Full support for IEEE 1394a and 1394b is available for [[Microsoft Windows XP]], [[FreeBSD]]<ref>[http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=firewire&sektion=4&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD+7.1-RELEASE FreeBSD firewire(4) man page]</ref>, [[Linux]]<ref>[http://ieee1394.wiki.kernel.org/ Linux FireWire wiki]</ref>, Apple [[Mac OS 8.6]] through to [[Mac OS 9]]<ref>[http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=86020 FireWire 2.2.2 and 2.3.3: Information and Download]</ref>, and [[Mac OS X]] as well as [[NetBSD]] and [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]]. Historically, performance of 1394 devices may have decreased after installing Windows XP Service Pack 2, but were resolved in Hotfix 885222<ref>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/885222/</ref> and in [[SP3]]. Some FireWire hardware manufacturers also provide custom device drivers which replace the Microsoft OHCI host adapter driver stack, enabling S800-capable devices to run at full 800 Mbit/s transfer rates on older versions of Windows (XP SP2 w/o Hotfix 885222) and Windows Vista. At the time of its release, Microsoft [[Windows Vista]] supported only 1394a, with assurances that 1394b support would come in the next service pack.<ref>[http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=187002039 EETimes.com - Microsoft to support 1394b standard]</ref> Service Pack 1 for Microsoft [[Windows Vista]] has since been released, however the addition of 1394b support is not mentioned anywhere in the release documentation.<ref>[http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/005f921e-f706-401e-abb5-eec42ea0a03e1033.mspx Notable Changes in Windows Vista Service Pack 1]</ref><ref>[http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/37f23bde-283a-4341-9a8a-ca6eb86ac8a41033.mspx Release Notes for Windows Vista Service Pack 1]</ref><ref>[http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/20184cb6-7038-4e82-a32c-4bc10ffe56ab1033.mspx Hotfixes and Security Updates included in Windows Vista Service Pack 1]</ref>

===Cable TV system support===
Cable TV providers (in the US, with digital systems) must, upon request of a customer, provide a high-definition capable [[Set-top box|cable box]] with a functional FireWire interface. This applies only to customers leasing high-definition capable [[Set-top box|cable boxes]] from said cable provider after April 1, 2004. The relevant law is CFR 76.640 Section 4 Subsections i and ii.<ref>http://www.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/part76.pdf page 145 </ref>
The interface can be used to display or record Cable TV, including HDTV programming.<ref>[http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/printthread.php?t=386740 AVS Forum - How-To: Mac OS X Firewire HDTV recording<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Node hierarchy===
FireWire devices are organized at the bus in a tree topology. Each device has a unique self-id. One of the nodes is elected root node and always has the highest id. The self-ids are assigned during the self-id process, which happens after each bus reset. The order in which the self-ids are assigned is equivalent to traversing the tree in a [[Depth-first search|depth-first]], post-order manner.

==Standards and versions==
The previous standards and its three published amendments are now incorporated into a superseding standard, '''IEEE 1394-2008'''<ref name="1394-2008" />.  The features individually added gives a good history on the development path.

===FireWire 400 (IEEE 1394-1995)===
[[Image:Firewire6-pin.jpg|thumb|200px|A 6-circuit FireWire 400 alpha connector]]
The original release of IEEE 1394-1995<ref name="1394-1995">{{cite book | author = IEEE p1394 Working Group | title = IEEE Std 1394-1995 High Performance Serial Bus | publisher = IEEE | date = 1996-08-30 | isbn = 1-5593-7583-3 | url = http://shop.ieee.org/ieeestore/Product.aspx?product_no=SH94364}}</ref> specified what is now known as FireWire 400. It can transfer data between devices at 100, 200, or 400 [[Megabit per second|Mbit/s]] [[half-duplex]] data rates (the actual transfer rates are 98.304, 196.608, and 393.216&nbsp;[[Megabit per second|Mbit/s]], i.e. 12.288, 24.576 and 49.152 [[megabyte]]s per second respectively)<ref name="teener"/>. These different transfer modes are commonly referred to as S100, S200, and S400.

Cable length is limited to {{convert|4.5|m|ft|1}}, although up to 16 cables can be [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]]ed using active repeaters; external hubs, or internal hubs are often present in FireWire equipment. The S400 standard limits any configuration's maximum cable length to {{convert|72|m|ft}}. The 6-circuit connector is commonly found on desktop computers, and can supply the connected device with power.

The 6-circuit powered connector, now referred to as an alpha connector, adds power output to support external devices. Typically a device can pull about 7 to 8 watts from the port; however, the voltage varies significantly from different devices.<ref>[http://developer.apple.com/documentation/HardwareDrivers/Conceptual/HWTech_FireWire/Articles/FireW_implementation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003892-SW1 FireWire Developer Note]</ref> Voltage is specified as unregulated and should nominally be about 25 volts (range 24 to 30). Apple's implementation on laptops is typically related to battery power and can be as low as 9 V and more likely about 12 V.

===Improvements (IEEE 1394a-2000)===
An amendment, IEEE 1394a, was released in 2000<ref name=1394a>{{cite book | author = IEEE p1394a Working Group | title = IEEE Std 1394a-2000 High Performance Serial Bus&nbsp;<U+2014> Amendment 1 | publisher = IEEE | year = 2000-06-30 | isbn = 0-7381-1958-X | url = http://shop.ieee.org/ieeestore/Product.aspx?product_no=SH94821}}</ref>, which clarified and improved the original specification. It added support for [[streaming media|asynchronous streaming]], quicker bus reconfiguration, [[packet concatenation]], and a power-saving [[suspend mode]].

1394a also standardized the 4-circuit alpha connector developed by Sony and already widely in use on consumer devices such as [[camcorders]], laptops, and other small FireWire devices. The 4-circuit connector is fully data-compatible with 6-circuit alpha interfaces but lacks power connectors.

===FireWire 800 (IEEE 1394b-2002)===
[[Image:Firewire800plug.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A 9-circuit beta connector.]]
IEEE 1394b-2002<ref name=1394b>{{cite book | author = IEEE p1394b Working Group | title = IEEE Std 1394b-2002 High Performance Serial Bus&nbsp;<U+2014> Amendment 2 | publisher = IEEE | date = 2002-12-14 | isbn = 0-7381-3253-5 | url = http://shop.ieee.org/ieeestore/Product.aspx?product_no=SH94986}}</ref> introduced FireWire 800 (Apple's name for the 9-circuit "S800 bilingual" version of the IEEE 1394b standard)  This specification and corresponding products allow a transfer rate of 786.432&nbsp;[[Megabit per second|Mbit/s]] [[full-duplex]] via a new encoding scheme termed beta mode. It is backwards compatible to the slower rates and 6-circuit alpha connectors of FireWire 400. However, while the IEEE 1394a and IEEE 1394b standards are compatible, FireWire 800's connector, referred to as a beta connector, is different from FireWire 400's alpha connectors, making legacy cables incompatible.  A bilingual cable allows the connection of older devices to the newer port.  In 2003, Apple was the first to introduce commercial products with the new connector.

The full IEEE 1394b specification supports data rates up to 3200&nbsp;[[Megabit per second|Mbit/s]] over beta-mode or optical connections up to {{convert|100|m|yd}} in length. Standard [[category 5 cable|Category 5e]] [[unshielded twisted pair]] supports {{convert|100|m|ft}} at S100.  The original 1394 and 1394a standards used [[Data strobe encoding|data/strobe (D/S) encoding]] (renamed to ''alpha mode'') on the [[circuit (electronic)|circuits]], while 1394b adds a data encoding scheme called [[8B10B]] referred to as ''beta mode''.

====FireWire S1600 and S3200====
In December 2007, the 1394 Trade Association announced that products will be available before the end of 2008 using the S1600 and S3200 modes that, for the most part, had already been defined in 1394b and was further clarified in IEEE Std. 1394-2008<ref name="1394-2008" />.  The 1.6&nbsp;Gbit/s and 3.2&nbsp;Gbit/s devices use the same 9-circuit beta connectors as the existing FireWire 800 and will be fully compatible with existing S400 and S800 devices. It will compete with the forthcoming [[USB 3.0]].<ref name="S3200-pr">{{cite web| url=http://www.1394ta.org/press/TAPress/2007_1212.html| title=1394 Trade Association Announces 3.2 Gigabit per Second Speed for FireWire| work=1394 Trade Association| date=2007-12-12| accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref>.

===FireWire S800T (IEEE 1394c-2006)===
[[Image:Cat 5.jpg|thumb|200px|FireWire is enhanced to share gigabit [[Category 5e cable]]]]
IEEE 1394c-2006 was published on June 8 2007.<ref name=1394c>{{cite journal |title=High Performance Serial Bus&nbsp;<U+2014> Amendment 3 |journal=IEEE Std 1394c-2006 | date=2007-06-08 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2006.371044 |id=ISBN 0-7381-5237-4 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4231513}}</ref>

It provided a major technical improvement, namely new port specification that provides 800 Mbit/s over the same [[8P8C|RJ45 connector]]s with [[Category 5e cable]], which is specified in IEEE 802.3 clause 40 ([[Gigabit Ethernet#1000BASE-T|gigabit Ethernet over copper twisted pair]]) along with a corresponding automatic negotiation that allows the same port to connect to either IEEE Std 1394 or [[IEEE 802.3]] ([[Ethernet]]) devices.

Though the potential for a combined Ethernet and FireWire RJ45 port is intriguing, {{as of|2008|11|lc=on}}, there are no products or chipsets which include this capability.

===Future enhancements (including P1394d) ===
A project named IEEE P1394d was formed by the IEEE on March 9 2009 to add [[single mode fiber]] as an additional transport medium to FireWire.<ref>http://standards.ieee.org/board/nes/0309nesrec.pdf</ref>

Other future iterations of FireWire are expected bring a bump in speed to 6.4 Gbit/s and additional connectors such as the small multimedia interface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lw.pennnet.com/display_article/312227/13/ARTCL/none/none/1/New-developments-in-IEEE-1394-(aka-FireWire) |title=New developments in IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. FireWire) |last=Baxter |first=Les |publisher=Lightwave |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref>


==Comparison to USB==
Although high-speed USB 2.0 nominally runs at a higher signaling rate (480&nbsp;[[megabit|Mbit]]/s) than FireWire 400, data transfers over S400 FireWire interfaces generally outperform similar transfers over USB 2.0 interfaces. Typical USB PC-hosts rarely exceed sustained transfers of 280 Mbit/s, with 240 Mbit/s being more typical. This is likely due to USB's reliance on the host-processor to manage low-level USB protocol, whereas FireWire delegates the same tasks to the interface hardware. For example, the FireWire host interface supports memory-mapped devices, which allows high-level protocols to run without loading the host CPU with interrupts and buffer-copy operations.<ref name="FireWire&nbsp;<U+2014> USB Comparison"/>  Besides throughput, other differences are that it uses simpler [[Bus (computing)|bus]] networking, provides more power over the chain, more reliable data transfer, and uses less CPU resources.<ref>http://www.qimaging.com/support/pdfs/firewire_usb_technote.pdf</ref>

FireWire 800 is substantially faster than Hi-Speed [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], both in theory and in practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/39129/USB_20_Versus_FireWire_pg3.html|title=USB 2.0 Versus FireWire|accessdate=2006-12-04|author=Heron, Robert|publisher=TechTV}}</ref>

==Alternative uses for IEEE 1394==
===Aircraft===
IEEE 1394b is used in military aircraft, where weight savings are desired. Developed for use as the data bus on the [[F-22 Raptor]], it is also used on the [[F-35 Lightning II]].<ref name="avweek_20070205">"The Electric Jet." Philips, E. H. ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]''. February 5, 2007.</ref> NASA's [[Space Shuttle]] also uses IEEE 1394b to monitor debris (foam, ice) which may hit the vehicle during launch.<ref name="avweek_20070205"/> This standard should not be confused with the unrelated [[MIL-STD-1394B]].

===Automobiles===
IDB-1394 Customer Convenience Port (CCP) is the automotive version of the 1394 standard.  <ref>[http://www.idbforum.org/  IDB Forum]</ref>

===Networking over FireWire===
FireWire can be used for ad-hoc (terminals only, no routers except where a FireWire hub is used) [[computer network]]s. Specifically, [[RFC:2734|RFC 2734]] specifies how to run [[IPv4]] over the FireWire interface, and [[RFC:3146|RFC 3146]] specifies how to run [[IPv6]].

[[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Windows ME]], [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], and [[Windows Server 2003]] all include support for networking over FireWire<ref>[http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fwip&sektion=4&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD+7.1-RELEASE FreeBSD 7.1 fwip(4) man page]</ref>. A network can be set up between two computers using a single standard FireWire cable, or by multiple computers through use of a hub. This is similar to [[Ethernet]] networks with the major differences being transfer speed, circuit length, and the fact that standard FireWire cables can be used for [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] communication.

On [[December 4, 2004]], [[Microsoft]] announced<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/IP_1394.mspx Discontinued Support for IP over 1394]</ref> that it would discontinue support for [[Internet protocol suite|IP]] networking over the FireWire interface in all future versions of [[Microsoft Windows]]. Consequently, support for this feature is absent from both [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]].<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943719 IP networking over the IEEE 1394 bus is not supported in Windows Vista and in all later versions of Windows]</ref><ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726965.aspx#ECAA New Networking Features in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista]</ref>

The [[PlayStation 2]] console had an i.LINK-branded 1394 connector. This was used for networking until the release of an Ethernet adapter late in the console's lifespan, but very few software titles supported the feature.

===IIDC===
IIDC (Instrumentation & Industrial Digital Camera) is the FireWire data format standard for live video, and is used by Apple's [[iSight]] A/V camera. The system was designed for [[machine vision]] systems,<ref>[http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/iidc_specifications.php libdc1394: IIDC/DCAM specifications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but is also used for other [[computer vision]] applications and for some [[webcam]]s. Although they are easily confused since they both run over FireWire, IIDC is different from, and incompatible with, the ordinary DV (Digital Video) camcorder protocol.

===DV===
{{main|DV}}

Digital Video ([[DV]]) is a standard [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] used by some digital [[camcorder]]s.
Formerly, all DV cameras had a FireWire interface (usually a 4-circuit), but recently many consumer brands have switched to USB. Labeling of the port varies by manufacturer, with Sony using either its i.LINK trademark or the letters 'DV'. Many [[digital video recorder]]s have a "DV-input" FireWire connector (usually an alpha connector) which can be used to record video from a directly-connected DV camcorder ("computer-free").

The protocol also allows remote control (play, rewind, etc.) of connected devices.

==Security issues==
Devices on a FireWire bus can communicate by [[direct memory access]], where a device can use hardware to map internal memory to FireWire's "Physical Memory Space". The SBP-2 ([[Serial Bus Protocol 2]]) used by FireWire disk drives uses this capability to minimize interrupts and buffer copies. In SBP-2, the initiator (controlling device) sends a request by remotely writing a command into a specified area of the target's FireWire address space. This command usually includes buffer addresses in the initiator's FireWire "Physical Address Space", which the target is supposed to use for moving I/O data to and from the initiator. <ref>[http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=147713&f_src=drweekly:There is a practical attempt to hack windows using firewire vulnerabilities] </ref>

On many implementations, particularly those like PCs and Macs using the popular [[OHCI]], the mapping between the FireWire "Physical Memory Space" and device physical memory is done in hardware, without operating system intervention. While this enables high-speed and low-latency communication between data sources and syncs without unnecessary copying (such as between a video camera and a software video recording application, or between a disk drive and the application buffers), this can also be a security risk if untrustworthy devices are attached to the bus. For this reason, high-security installations will typically either purchase newer machines which map a [[virtual memory]] space to the FireWire "Physical Memory Space" (such as a Power Mac G5, or any Sun workstation), disable the [[OHCI]] hardware mapping between FireWire and device memory, physically disable the entire FireWire interface, or do not have FireWire at all.

This feature can also be used to [[debug]] a machine whose operating system has crashed, and in some systems for remote-console operations. On [[FreeBSD]], the dcons driver provides both, using [[gdb]] as debugger. Under Linux, firescope<ref>[http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/3/301 LKML: Andi Kleen: [ANNOUNCE&#93; firescope for i386/x86-64 released<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and fireproxy<ref>[http://www.suse.de/~bk/firewire Index of /~bk/firewire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> exist.
