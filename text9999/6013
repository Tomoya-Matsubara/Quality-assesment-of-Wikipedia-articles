'''RAF Sculthorpe''' is a helicopter training facility for the United Kingdom's [[Royal Air Force]], situated about 3 miles west of Fakenham in [[Norfolk]]. Over the years has been home to many visiting airmen and support crews of the RAF and [[United States Air Force]].  The airstrip is said to be one of the longest heated airstrips in the world. To a certain extent the base was quite secret, its position on top of a hill meaning that very little can be seen from outside. 

== History ==

=== World War Two ===

RAF Sculthorpe was built as the second satellite airfield of [[RAF West Raynham]] a few miles to the south, the first being [[RAF Great Massingham]].  Work was begun in the Spring of 1942 and the airfield was laid out as a standard RAF Heavy Bomber airfield with concrete runways, dispersals site, mess facilities and accommodation.  Much of the construction work was completed by [[Irish people|Irish]] labour working for the construction company [[Bovis]].  

As work was drawing to a close in May 1943 the first squadrons started to arrive, the first being RAF 342 Lorraine Squadron (Free French Air Force) within 2 Group from [[RAF West Raynham]].  This squadron operated two flights of the [[Douglas Boston]] aircraft along with some [[Douglas Havoc]] aircraft for training, 342 Squadron stayed until 19th July 1943 when the moved to [[RAF Great Massingham]].  

On 20th July 1943 the Royal New Zealand Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force moved in with 487 and 464 Squadrons taking up residence with their [[Lockheed Ventura]] aircraft having moved from [[RAF Methwold]] before converting at Sculthorpe onto the [[De Havilland Mosquito]].  On 20th September 1943 21 Squadron moved in from [[RAF Oulton]], also with Mosquitos to form the Sculthorpe Wing (140 Wing).  The Wing stayed at Sculthorpe completing more than 100 missions before departing for [[RAF Hunsdon]] on the 31st December 1943.

In January 1944 [[No. 100 Group RAF|100 Group Royal Air Force]] No. 214 Squadron moved in with [[Boeing B-17]] aircraft for use in the [[Electronic Warfare]] role, to be joined by crews from the USAAF 96th Bomb Group from [[RAF Snetterton]], known at Sculthorpe and thereafter as the 803rd Bomb Squadron of the USAAF.  In April 1944 the 803rd and 214 Squadron departed for [[RAF Oulton]] leaving Sculthorpe empty for it's redevelopment as a Very Heavy Bomber Base with the work not being completed until the Spring of [[1946]].

Sculthorpe was refurbished for USAF use during Berlin Crisis in [[1949]] and then later, in [[1952]], it became home for the '''47th Bombardment Wing''', who were to stay for a decade.  

The [[Soviet Union]]'s enormous conventional force in Eastern Europe posed a major problem for [[NATO]] due to the Soviets maintaining high personnel levels after World War II ended, most of the American and British forces had demobilized.    The Soviets used the excuse that they were still technically at war with [[Germany]] as the reason for maintaining the [[Red Army]] at war strength.

To counter this Soviet threat to Western Europe, NATO decided to expand their tactical nuclear force by introducing the [[B-45 Tornado|North American B-45 Tornado]] to the UK.   The US [[Strategic Air Command]] had about 100 of these four-engined jet bombers, each capable of dropping five tactical nuclear bombs.   In the summer of 1952, the Pentagon decided to deploy the 47th Bomb Wing to Sculthorpe from [[Langley Air Force Base]], [[Virginia]].

The squadrons of the 47th Bomb Group were:

* 84th Bombardment Squadron (B-45, B-66) (17 Nov 1952 - 22 Jun 1962) (Red Tail Stripe)
* 85th Bombardment Squadron (B-45, B-66) (17 Nov 1952 - 22 Jun 1962) (Yellow Tail Stripe)
* 422d Bombardment Squadron (B-45) (20 Dec 1953 - 23 Mar 1954)
* 86th Bombardment Squadron (B-45, B-66) (23 Mar 1954 - 22 Jun 1962) (Blue Tail Stripe)

* 19th Tactical Reconnaissance (RB-45C) (7 May 1954 - 1 Dec 1958)

Due to a shortage of space at Sculthorpe, the 86th BS operated from [[RAF Alconbury]] as a detachment of the 47th. In addition to the B-47 squadrons at Sculthorpe, the 47th's sister wing, the '''20th Fighter-Bomber Wing''' with the nuclear capable [[F-84 Thunderjet|North American F-84G "Thunderjet"]] were transferred to [[RAF Wethersfield]] in [[Essex]].  

From 1954 to 1958, the '''19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron''' also flew the reconnaissance version of the B-45 known as the RB-45. The 19th TRS was originally part of the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at [[Sembach Air Base]] [[West Germany]].  The 19th TRS was assigned to the 47th Bomb Wing from [[May]] [[1954]] to [[December]] [[1958]]. When the 19th began to re-equip with RB-66<U+2019>s during 1957, its RB-45<U+2019>s were transferred to other squadrons of the 47th Bomb Wing.  The RB-45<U+2019>s carried the same markings as the B-45, except for an added marking on the wingtip fuel tanks. This marking consisted of two stripes coming back off the top and bottom of the circular Squadron Badge in the appropriate Squadron color near the outside front center of the tank.

By [[1957]]. carrying 10,000 personnel it was the biggest [[Strategic Air Command]] bomber base in Europe.  In May [[1958]], the re-equipment of the 47th Bombardment Wing began and [[B-66 Destroyer|Douglas B-66 Destroyer]]s began to replace the B-45s. With this equipment change, the 47th's squadrons was redesignated '''Bombardment Squadron (Tactical)'''.

During [[1960]] - [[1962]] the 47th also performed performed air refueling missions assigning [[B-50 Superfortress|KB-50 tankers]] to the '''420th Air Refueling Squadron''' from [[15 March]] 1960 to [[22 June]] 1962.  The KB-50s were specially equipped with two [[General Electric J47]] turbojet engines that enabled thet takners to match the speed of the faster jet fightrers during refueling.   However most of the KB-50s were more than fifteen years old and were too slow to refuel the faster tactical jets of USAFE.   The 420th ARS was deactivated on [[25 March]] [[1964]].

In [[1962]] Project Clearwater halted large scale rotational bomber deployments to Britain with Sculthorpe,  along with [[RAF Fairford]], [[RAF Chelveston]], and [[RAF Greenham Common]], being turned over to USAFE for tactical air use. As a result, the 49th Bomb Wing was deactivated on [[22 June]] 1962.  A number of the aircraft were reassigned to the 42nd TRS, 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at [[RAF Chelveston]]  and modified with the Electronic Counter-Measures tail system.

With the deactivation of the 47th, Sculthorpe was put under the command of the '''7375th Combat Support Group'''.

During the Spring and Summer of [[1984 in aviation|1984]], units of the [[48th Fighter Wing|48th Tactical Fighter Wing]] deployed to RAF Sculthorpe because their home station, [[RAF Lakenheath]] was having its [[runway]] resurfaced.

The base became inactive at the end of the Cold War. Much of the associated housing and most other buildings have now been sold off by the military. The US quarters have been extensively refurbished and now form a new village called Wicken Green. There is also a fledgling industrial park. 

The airstrip area remains in military hands, officially as an army helicopter training area, and there are exercises about twice a year.
