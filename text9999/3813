== Life ==
Mitrofan Ban's birth name was Marko Ban, and he was born on [[May 15]] [[1841]] in Glavati near [[Grblje]] to Georgije and Anastasija Ban. He attended [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] primary schools in [[Vranovi<U+0107>i]] and [[Kotor]]. In 1865, he took his [[Religious vows|monastic vows]] in the [[Savina monastery]] near [[Herceg Novi]]. He was ordained a [[deacon]] by Bishop [[Stevan Kne<U+017E>evi<U+0107> (bishop)|Stevan Kne<U+017E>evi<U+0107>]] on [[27 June]] [[1865]], and a [[presbyter]] on [[2 October]] [[1866]]. He became the ''nastojatelj'' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0458><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+0459> or ''nastojatelj'') of [[Podlastva monastery]] in 1867, and of [[Mora<U+010D>a monastery]] in 1869. From [[7 September]] [[1870]] he was the [[hegumen]] (<U+0438><U+0433><U+0443><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D> or ''iguman'') of the latter. Both a ''nastojatelj'' and an ''iguman'' are the senior [[monk]] in a [[monastery]]; the difference is so slight they are sometimes considered [[synonym]]s.

He participated in the war against the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1876 to 1878, for which [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola]] decorated him with the Medal of [[Milo<U+0161> Obili<U+0107>|Obili<U+0107>]]. He was ordained a Metropolitan on [[18 April]] [[1885]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The ceremony was conducted in [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] by [[Metropolitan Isidor]] of St. Petersburg and other members of the [[Most Holy Synod|Holy Synod]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], in the presence of [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. Soon after, on 5 September 1884, the relics of [[Saint Arsenije I Sremac|Saint Arsenius]] (the second Serb archbishop) were ceremonially transferred from the [[<U+017D>drebaonik monastery]] in [[Bjelopavli<U+0107>i plain|Bjelopavli<U+0107>i]] to the [[Kosijerevo monastery]].

After 1906, he was a member of the [[Parliament of Montenegro#Serbian National Assembly of the Princedom (Kingdom) of Montenegro (27 September 1906 - 4 January 1916)|National Assembly]] of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]. He stayed in the country during the [[World War I|First World War]] occupation of the Kingdom by [[Austria-Hungary]], and died on [[30 September]] [[1920]], not long after the formation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and the reunification of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], including the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]].

== Quotes ==
During the [[World War I|First World War]], when [[Austria-Hungary]] occupied the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]], the occupying troops razed the [[Mount Lov<U+0107>en#Mausoleum Controversy|chapel]] at the peak of [[Mount Lov<U+0107>en]] and exhumed the remains of [[Petar II Petrovi<U+0107>-Njego<U+0161>]]. At that time, Mitrofan Ban said to Governor Weber: "Njego<U+0161> was not just the ruler of Montenegro, but also a poet of Serbdom, and that act will mournfully echo in all Serbian lands".<ref>[http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko-cg/povijest/njegos-kapela_c.html <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440> <U+0420><U+0430><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B>: <U+040A><U+0435><U+0433><U+043E><U+0448><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430> <U+041A><U+0430><U+043F><U+0435><U+043B><U+0430>]</ref>
