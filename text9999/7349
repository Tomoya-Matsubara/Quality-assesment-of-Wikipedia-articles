'''Giovanni Pico della Mirandola''' (born February 24, 1463, died November 17, 1494) was an Italian [[Renaissance]] [[philosopher]].<ref>"Pico della Mirandola, Giovanni, Conte" in Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge, volume 15, copyright 1991. Grolier Inc., ISBN 0-7172-5300-7</ref> He was celebrated for the events of [[1486]], when at the age of twenty-three, he proposed to defend 900 theses on [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[natural philosophy]] and [[magic]] against all comers, for which he wrote the famous ''Oration on the Dignity of Man'' which has been called the "Manifesto of the Renaissance",<ref>''Oration on the Dignity of Man'' (1486) http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_1/pico.html</ref> and a key text of [[Renaissance humanism]]. 

==Life Story==
Pico was a younger son of the family of the Counts of [[Mirandola]] and Concordia, feudal lords of a small region in the province of [[Emilia-Romagna]]. A precocious child with an amazing memory, he was schooled in [[Latin]], and possibly [[Greek language|Greek]], at a very early age.  Intended for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] by his mother, he was named a papal [[protonotary]] at the age of ten and in 1477 he went to [[Bologna]] to study [[canon law]].  

At the sudden death of his mother two years later, Pico renounced canon law and began to study philosophy at the University of [[Ferrara]].  During a brief trip to Florence, he met [[Angelo Poliziano]], the courtly poet Girolamo Benivieni and probably the young Dominican monk [[Savonarola]].  He would be very close friends with all three, including the ascetic and violently anti-[[Humanism|humanist]] Savonarola, for the rest of his life.  

From 1480 to 1482, he continued his studies at the University of [[Padua]], a major center of [[Aristotelianism]] in Italy.  Already proficient in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], he studied [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in Padua with [[Elia del Medigo]], a Jewish [[Averroist]], and read [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] manuscripts with him as well.  Del Medigo also translated [[Rabbinic literature|Judaic manuscripts]] from Hebrew into Latin for Pico, as he would continue to do for a number of years.  Pico also wrote sonnets in Padua <U+2013> both in Latin and in [[Italian language|Italian]] <U+2013> which he would destroy at the end of his life.

He spent the next four years either at home, or visiting [[Humanism|humanist]] centers in [[Italy]] and in 1485, he traveled to the [[University of Paris]], the most important center for [[Scholastic]] philosophy and theology in Europe <U+2013> and a hotbed of secular [[Averroism]].  It was probably in Paris that Pico began his 900 Theses and conceived the idea of defending them in a public debate.

In 1486, he returned to Florence and met [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] and [[Marsilio Ficino]], on the very day that Ficino completed his translations of the works of Plato from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] under Lorenzo<U+2019>s enthusiastic patronage.  Pico charmed them both immensely.  Until the day Lorenzo died, he would support and protect Pico through some very difficult times.  Indeed, without Lorenzo, it is doubtful that Pico<U+2019>s work would have survived.

Pico left for Rome, with the intention of publishing his 900 Theses and setting up a <U+201C>Congress<U+201D> of scholars from all over Europe to debate them.  But on the way, stopping in [[Arezzo]], he became embroiled in a love affair with the wife of one of Lorenzo de<U+2019> Medici<U+2019>s cousins.   It almost cost him his life.  Pico attempted to run off with the woman, but he was caught, wounded and thrown into prison by her husband.  He was released only upon the intervention of Lorenzo himself.  The incident is wholly representative of Pico's often audacious temperament and of the loyalty and affection he nevertheless could inspire.

Pico spent several months in [[Perugia]] and nearby Fratta, recovering from his injuries.  It was there, as he wrote to Ficino, that "divine Providence [<U+2026>] caused certain books to fall into my hands.  They are [[Chaldean]] books [<U+2026>] of [[Esdras]], of [[Zoroaster]] and of [[Biblical Magi|Melchior]], oracles of the magi, which contain a brief and dry interpretation of Chaldean philosophy, but full of mystery."<ref>http://www.lyber-eclat.net/lyber/mirandola/picbio.html</ref> It was also in Perugia that Pico was introduced to the mystical Hebrew [[Kabbalah]], which fascinated him, as did the [[Late Antiquity|late Classical]] [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] writers, such as [[Hermes Trismegistus]].  The [[Kabbalah]] and the [[Hermetica]] were thought to be as ancient as the Old Testament in Pico's time, and for that reason, he accorded them an almost scriptural status.  It was always Pico's intention to walk completely around a topic and look at it from many possible angles, in order to derive the truest possible vision of the thing itself.  [[Syncretism]], for Pico, was seeing the same absolute from many different points of view:  an unusually modern approach.

Pico based his ideas chiefly on [[Plato]], as did his teacher, [[Marsilio Ficino]], but Pico retained a deep respect for [[Aristotle]].  Although he was a product of the ''studia humanitatis'', Pico was constitutionally an eclectic, and in some respects he represented a reaction against the exaggerations of pure [[humanism]], defending what he believed to be the best of the medieval and Islamic commentators (see [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]]) on [[Aristotle]] in a famous long letter to [[Ermolao Barbaro]] in 1485.  It was always Pico<U+2019>s aim to reconcile the schools of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], since he believed they both used different words to express the same concepts.  It was perhaps for this reason his friends called him "Princeps Concordiae, or "Prince of Harmony" (a pun on Prince of Concordia, one of his family<U+2019>s holdings.<ref>Paul Oskar Kristeller, Eight Philosophers of the Italian Renaissance.  Stanford University Press (Stanford, California, 1964.)  P. 62.</ref>)  Similarly, Pico believed an educated person should also study the Hebrew and [[Talmudic]] sources, and the [[Hermetica|Hermetics]], because he believed they represented the same view seen in the Old Testament, in different words, of God.  

He finished his ''Oration on the Dignity of Man'' to accompany his 900 Theses and traveled to Rome to continue his plan to defend them.  He had them published in December 1486 (''Conclusiones philosophicae, cabalasticae et theologicae'', Rome, [[1486]]) and offered to pay the expenses of any scholars who came to Rome to debate them publicly.

In February 1487, [[Pope Innocent VIII]] halted the proposed debate, and established a commission to review the orthodoxy of the ''Theses.''  Although Pico answered the charges against them, thirteen of the ''Theses'' were condemned.  Pico agreed in writing to retract them, but he did not change his mind about their validity, and proceeded to write an ''Apologia'' ("Apologia J. Pici Mirandolani, Concordiae comitis" published in [[1489]]) defending them, dedicated to Lorenzo.  When the Pope was apprised of the circulation of this manuscript, he set up an inquisitorial tribunal, forcing Pico to renounce the ''Apologia'' as well <U+2013> which he also agreed to do.

Nevertheless, the Pope declared his Theses unorthodox calling them "in part heretical, in part the flower of heresy; several are scandalous and offensive to pious ears; most do nothing but reproduce the errors of pagan philosophers<U+2026>others are capable of inflaming the impertinence of the [[Jews]]; a number of them, finally, under the pretext of "[[natural philosophy]]," favor arts that are enemies to the Catholic faith and to the human race."<ref>lyber-eclat.net  ''op.cit.''</ref>   One of Pico<U+2019>s detractors maintained that "Kabbala" was the name of an impious writer against Jesus Christ.  
<!--[[Image:Lorenzo de Medici_by_Verrochio.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Lorenzo de' Medici, bronze bust by Verrocchio.]] missing image --> 
Pico fled to France in 1488, where he was arrested by [[Philip II, Duke of Savoy|Philippe de Savoie]], at the demand of the papal [[nuncio]]s, and imprisoned at Vincennes.  Through the intercession of several Italian princes <U+2013> all instigated by Lorenzo <U+2013> King [[Charles VIII]] had him released, and the Pope was persuaded to allow Pico to move to Florence and to live under Lorenzo<U+2019>s protection.  But he was not cleared of the papal censures and restrictions until 1493, after the accession of [[Alexander VI]] (Rodrigo Borgia) to the papacy.  

Pico was deeply shaken by the experience.  He reconciled with [[Savonarola]], who remained a dear friend, and it was at Pico<U+2019>s persuasion that Lorenzo invited Savonarola to Florence.  But Pico never renounced his syncretist convictions.  

He settled in a villa near [[Fiesole]] prepared for him by Lorenzo, where he wrote and published the ''Heptaplus id est de Dei creatoris opere'' (1489) and ''De Ente et Uno'' (1491).  It was here that he also wrote his other most celebrated work, the ''Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinicatrium'', which was not published until after his death.  In it, Pico acidly condemned the practices of the astrologers of his day, and shredded the intellectual basis of astrology itself.  Pico was interested in high magic, that enhanced man's dignity and strengthened his will, and there was no room in such a concept for the determinism of the stars.

After the death of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], in 1492, Pico moved to [[Ferrara]], although he continued to visit Florence, where political instability gave rise to the increasing influence of Savonarola, whose reactionary opposition to Renaissance expansion and style had already brought about conflict with the [[Medici]] family (they eventually were expelled from Florence), and would lead to wholesale destruction of books and paintings.  Nevertheless, Pico became a follower of Savonarola, destroying his own poetry and giving away his fortune, with the determination of becoming a monk.  However, he never did decide to make this final commitment. 

Pico died under very mysterious circumstances in 1494. It was rumored that his own secretary had poisoned him, because Pico had become too close to Savonarola.<ref>''ibid.''</ref>  He was interred at San Marco and Savonarola delivered the funeral oration.  [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficino]] wrote:  <U+201C>Our dear Pico left us on the same day that Charles VIII was entering Florence, and the tears of men of letters  compensated for the joy of the people.  Without the light brought by the king of France, Florence might perhaps have never seen a more somber day than that which extinguished Mirandola<U+2019>s light.<U+201D><ref>''ibid.''</ref>

==Writings==
In the Oration on the Dignity of Man (1486), Pico justifies the importance of the human quest for knowledge within a neo-Platonic framework.  He writes that after God had created all creatures, he conceived of the desire for another, sentient being who would appreciate all his works, but there was no longer any room in the [[chain of being]]; all the possible slots from angels to worms had been filled. So, God created man such that he had no specific slot in the chain.  Instead, men were capable of learning from and imitating any existing creature. When man philosophizes, he ascends the chain of being towards the angels, and communion with God.  When he fails to exercise his intellect, he vegetates. Pico did not fail to notice that this system made philosophers like himself among the most dignified human creatures. The idea that man could ascend the chain of being through the exercise of their intellectual capacities was a profound endorsement of the dignity of human existence in this earthly life.  The root of this dignity lay in his assertion that only human beings could change themselves through their own free will, whereas all other changes in nature were the result of some outside force acting on whatever it is that undergoes change.  He observed from history that philosophies and institutions were always in change, making man's capacity for self-transformation the only constant.  Coupled with his belief that all of creation constitutes a symbolic reflection of the divinity of God, Pico's philosophies had a profound influence on the arts, helping to elevate writers and painters from their medieval role as mere artisans to the Renaissance ideal of the artist as genius.

[[Image:GirolamoSavonarola.jpg|thumb|right|Savonarola by Fra Bartolomeo, c. 1498]]
The Oration also served as an introduction to Pico's 900 theses, which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge, and hence a model for mankind's ascent of the chain of being. For a full study and English translation, see the study by S.A. Farmer listed in the external links. The 900 Theses are a good example of humanist [[syncretism]], because Pico combined [[Platonism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Aristotelianism]], [[Hermeticism]] and [[Kabbalah]]. They also included 72 theses describing what Pico believed to be a complete system of physics.

A portion of his '''''Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem''''' was published in Bologna after his death.  In this book Pico presents arguments against the practice of [[astrology]] that have had enormous resonance for centuries, up to our own time.  ''Disputationes'' is influenced by the arguments against astrology espoused by one of his intellectual heroes, [[St. Augustine of Hippo]], and also by ideas held by his teacher, [[Marsilio Ficino]], who may have encouraged him to write it.  Pico<U+2019>s antagonism to astrology seems to derive mainly from the conflict of astrology with Christian notions of free will.  But Pico<U+2019>s arguments moved beyond the objections of Ficino (who was himself an astrologer).  The manuscript was edited for publication after Pico<U+2019>s death by his nephew, an ardent follower of [[Savonarola]], and may possibly have been amended to be more forcefully critical.  This might possibly explain the fact that Ficino championed the manuscript and enthusiastically endorsed it before its publication.

Pico<U+2019>s ''Heptaplus'', a mystico-allegorical exposition of the creation according to the seven Biblical senses, elaborates on his idea that different religions and traditions describe the same God.  ''De ente et uno'', has explanations of several passages in [[Moses]], Plato and Aristotle.

Besides the writings already mentioned, see his complete works (Bologna, [[1496]]; Venice, [[1498]]; Strasburg, [[1504]]; Basle, [[1557]]; [[1573]], [[1601]]). He wrote in Italian an imitation of Plato's ''Banquet''. His letters (''Aureae ad familiares epistolae'', Paris, [[1499]]) are important for the history of contemporary thought. The many editions of his entire works in the sixteenth century sufficiently prove his influence.

A line from the Oration on the Dignity of Man quoted in The Ultra-Renaissance Manifesto by The Ultra-Renaissance art movement founding-artist Mike Wrathell in 1981.  "Ignorant of how to yield to them, let us compete with the angels in dignity and glory."  The Ultra-Renaissance has similar goals with the Italian Renaissance, and artist Mike Wrathell has art with strong da Vinci references, such as "The Mona System" which leads off the documentary "the king of pluto" by sheila franklin.  The documentary won its director an Award of Excellence at the Berkeley Film & Video Festival of 2004.

Of minor interest is a passing reference to Mirandola by H.P. Lovecraft, in the story ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'' (1927).  Mirandola is given as the source of the fearsome incantation used by unknown evil entities as some sort of evocation.  However, this "spell" was first depicted (as the key to a rather simple form of divination, not a great and terrible summoning) by, and in all likelihood created by, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim in his ''De Occulta Philosophia''.  This was written several decades after Mirandola's death and was the first written example of that "spell", so it is almost impossible for Mirandola to have been the source of those "magic words".  One has to wonder what error of research, or perhaps deliberate misquote, led to this attribution by Lovecraft.

In Umberto Eco's novel ''Foucault's Pendulum'' the protagonist Casaubon claims that the idea that the Jews were privy to the enigma of the Templars was "a mistake of Pico Della Mirandola" caused by a spelling mistake he made between "Israelites" and "Ismaelites".
