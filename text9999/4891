'''HMS ''Royal George''''' was a 100-gun [[first-rate]] [[ship of the line]] of the [[Royal Navy]], built at [[Woolwich Dockyard]] and launched on 18 February 1756. The largest warship in the world at the time of launching, she saw service during the [[Seven Years' War]] including being Admiral [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Sir Edward Hawke]]'s flagship at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] and later taking part in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]]. 
She sank undergoing routine maintenance work whilst anchored off [[Portsmouth]] on 29 August 1782 with the loss of more than 800 lives, one of the most serious maritime losses to occur in British waters.

==Service==
Ordered on 29 August 1746, she was laid down at Woolwich Dockyard in 1746 as ''Royal Anne,'' and built to the draught specified by the [[1745 Establishment]]. She was renamed ''Royal George'' during building and launched on 18 February 1756.<ref name="Lavery, SoLv1 p173" /><ref name="rnm">{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_RoyalGeorge.htm |title=The Loss of HMS Royal George &#124; Online Information Bank &#124; Research Collections &#124; Royal Naval Museum at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard |publisher=Royalnavalmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-05}}</ref> At the time of her launch in 1756, she was the largest warship in the world. She served in the [[Seven Years' War]], commissioning under her first commander, Captain Richard Dorrill in October 1755, and after being completed, joined the [[Western Squadron]] or Channel Fleet under Admiral [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Sir Edward Hawke]] in May 1756.<ref name="Winfield">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships in the Age of Sail|page=5}}</ref> Dorrill was succeeded by Captain [[John Campbell (Royal Navy officer)|John Campbell]] in July 1756, who was in turn succeeded by Captain Matthew Buckle in early 1757.<ref name="Winfield"/>  ''Royal George'' was the [[flagship]] of Vice-Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]] at this time, and flew his flag in the [[Raid on Rochefort]] in September that year.<ref name="Winfield"/> Captain Piercy Brett took command in 1758, during which time ''Royal George'' became the flagship of Admiral [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|Lord George Anson]]. Brett was succeeded by Captain [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Alexander Hood]] in November 1758, though ''Royal George''{{'}}s former captain, Richard Dorrill, was back in command the following year, until being invalided out of the ship in June.<ref name="Winfield"/> Dorrill's replacement was another former captain, John Campbell, who commanded her in the blockade of the French fleet at [[Brest, France|Brest]].<ref name="Winfield"/>  She became Sir Edward Hawke's flagship in early November of that year, when his previous flagship, {{HMS|Ramillies|1749|2}}, went into dock for repairs. Hawke commanded the fleet from ''Royal George'' at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]]<ref name="rnm" /> on 20 November 1759, where she sank the French ship [[French ship Superbe|''Superbe'']].

''Royal George'' was commanded by Captain William Bennett from March 1760, and she was present at the [[fleet review]] at [[Spithead]] in July that year.<ref name="Winfield"/> John Campbell returned to command his old ship in August 1760, though Bennett was captain again by December. ''Royal George'' joined Admiral [[Charles Hardy]]<U+2019>s fleet in the Autumn of 1762, and was then paid off on 18 December that year.<ref name="Winfield"/>  She was laid up at the conclusion of the Seven Years' War, undergoing a large repair at [[Plymouth]] between 1765 and 1768.  The outbreak of the [[American War of Independence]] generated a need for more ships and ''Royal George'' was fitted at [[Portsmouth]] for service in the Channel between May 1778 and April 1779.<ref name="Winfield"/>  

She recommissioned under her first new commander, Captain Thomas Hallum, in July 1778, with command passing to Captain [[John Colpoys]] in November that year. ''Royal George'' was at this time the flagship of Vice-Admiral [[Sir Robert Harland, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Harland]], with the Western Squadron.<ref name="Winfield"/>  Harland struck his flag, and in his place Vice-Admiral [[George Darby]] briefly raised his in June 1779, though from August 1779 until December 1781 she was the flagship of Rear-Admiral [[John Lockhart-Ross|Sir John Lockhart Ross]].<ref name="Winfield"/> Meanwhile Captain Colpoys was replaced by Captain John Bourmaster in December 1779, and she joined Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Sir George Rodney's]] fleet in their mission to [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|relieve Gibraltar]]. Under Bourmaster, and flying Ross's flag, ''Royal George'' took part in the [[Action of 8 January 1780|attack on the Caracas convoy]] on 8 January 1780, and the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]] on 16 January 1780, before going on to successfully relieve Gibraltar three days later.<ref name="rnm" /><ref name="Winfield"/>

''Royal George'' returned to Britain with the rest of the fleet, and had her hull [[copper sheathing|coppered]] in April 1780. She returned to service that summer, serving with the Channel Fleet under Admiral [[Sir Francis Geary, 1st Baronet|Francis Geary]], and then George Darby from the Autumn.<ref name="Winfield"/> Both captain and admiral changed in late 1781, Bourmaster being replaced by Captain Henry Cromwell, and Ross striking his flag for ''Royal George'' to become the flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Richard Kempenfelt]]. She served as part of [[Samuel Barrington]]'s squadron from April 1782, with Cromwell replaced by Captain [[Martin Waghorn]] in May.<ref name="Winfield"/> ''Royal George'' then joined the fleet under [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]].<ref name="Winfield"/>

==Loss==

[[File:John Christian Schetky, Loss of the Royal George (exhibited 1840).jpg|thumb|Loss of the Royal George (painting by John Christian Schetky)]]  
On 28 August 1782 ''Royal George'' was preparing to sail with Admiral Howe's fleet to relieve [[Gibraltar]]. The ships were anchored at Spithead to take on supplies. Most of her complement were aboard ship, as were a large number of workmen to speed the repairs. There were also an estimated 200-300 relatives visiting the officers and men, 100-200 'ladies from the Point [at Portsmouth], who, though seeking neither husbands or fathers, yet visit our newly-arrived ships of war', and a number of merchants and traders come to sell their wares to the seamen.<ref name="JT">{{cite book |last=Adkins & Adkins |title=Jack Tar|pages=161<U+2013>3}}</ref> The exact number is unknown but is estimated to be around 1,200.<ref name="JT"/>{{Ref label|A|a|none}}

At seven o<U+2019>clock on the morning of 29 August work on the hull was carried out and ''Royal George'' was [[Sailing#Heeling|heeled]] over by rolling the ship's guns on one side into the centreline of the ship. This caused the ship to tilt over in the water.<ref name="rnm" /> The ship was heeled over too far, passing her [[centre of gravity]]. Realising that the ship was settling in the water, orders were given to move the guns back into position to restore the ship's balance. During these operations the lower deck gunports were not properly secured, causing an inrush of water. At the time of the sinking a [[lighter (barge)|lighter]] was alongside, loading barrels of rum in through the open lower gunports.<ref name="JT"/> The ship rolled on to her side, saved from sinking immediately by the presence of the lighter, which was pushed under the water by the weight of the ''Royal George''{{'}}s masts.<ref name="JT"/> ''Royal George'' quickly filled up with water and sank, taking with her around 900 people, including up to 300 women and 60 children who were visiting the ship in harbour. 255 people were saved, including eleven women and one child. Some escaped by running up the rigging while others were picked up by boats from other vessels.<ref name="JT"/> Kempenfelt was writing in his cabin when the ship sank; the cabin doors had jammed due to the ship heeling and he perished with the rest. Waghorn was injured and thrown into the water but he was rescued.<ref name="rnm" />

Many of the victims were washed ashore at [[Ryde]], [[Isle of Wight]] where they were buried in a mass grave that stretched along the beach. This land was reclaimed in the development of a Victorian esplanade and is now occupied by the streets and properties of Ryde Esplanade and The Strand.<ref>''Portraits of the Isle of Wight'', P. Sanders, Kingsmead Press, Bath, 1979</ref>  In April 2009, Isle of Wight Council placed a new memorial plaque in the newly-restored Ashley Gardens on Ryde Esplanade in memory of ''Royal George''. It is a copy of the original plaque unveiled in 1965 by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] which was moved in 2006 to the Royal George Memorial Garden, also on the Esplanade.
[[File:RoyalGeorge-sunk.jpg|right|thumb|A contemporary illustration of the ''Royal George'' resting at the bottom of the [[Solent]] with its masts sticking up from the surface.]]
A [[court-martial]] failed to attribute blame for the tragedy and acquitted the officers and crew (many of whom had perished), blaming the accident on the 'general state of decay of her timbers' and suggesting that the most likely cause of the sinking was that part of the frame of the ship gave way under the stress of the heel.<ref name="rnm" /> One of the few survivors was the man perhaps most responsible for the loss, Lieutenant [[Philip Charles Durham]], the officer of the watch at the time of the sinking.<ref name="Tracy">{{Cite book|last=Tracy |title=Who's Who in Nelson's Navy |pages=131<U+2013>2}}</ref> Naval historian Nicholas Tracy stated that Durham had allowed water to accumulate on the gundeck. The resulting [[free surface effect]] eventually compromised the ship's stability.<ref name="Tracy"/> Tracy concluded that an 'alert officer of the watch would have prevented the tragedy...'<ref name="Tracy"/> Durham was one of the officers investigated at the court-martial, and was acquitted with the surviving officers in the verdict that decided that the cause of the accident was the state of the timbers.<ref name="Tracy"/>{{Ref label|B|b|none}}

A fund was established by [[Lloyd's Coffee House]] to help the widows and children of the sailors lost in the sinking, which was the start of what eventually became the [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]].<ref name="JT"/>  The accident was commemorated in verse by the poet [[William Cowper]]:

==Salvage attempts==
===Initial attempts===

[[File:1783, Royal George medallion.png|thumb|1783 [[medallion]] commemorating the sinking of the Royal George]]
[[File:Model Royal George.jpg|thumb|Stern of the ''Royal George'': 1779 painting of a model at the [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich]]
Several attempts were made to raise the vessel, both for salvage and because it was a major hazard to navigation, lying as she did in a busy harbour at a depth of only {{convert|65|ft|abbr=on}}.

In 1782 six iron 12-pounder guns and nine brass 12-pounders were recovered using [[diving bell]]s.

===Deane brothers (1834)===
After that no further work was carried out on the wreck until 1834, when [[Charles Anthony Deane]] and his brother [[John Deane (inventor)|John]], using the first air-pumped [[diving helmet]] which they themselves had invented, began work. From 1834<U+2014>1836 they recovered 7 iron 42-pounders, 18 brass 24-pounders and 3 brass 12-pounders for which he received salvage from the [[Board of Ordnance]]. The remaining guns were buried under mud of the timbers of the wreck and they were unable to reach them.

It was during this operation that local fishermen asked the divers to investigate something on the seabed onto which their nets kept snagging. A dive by John Deane, 1&nbsp;km north east of the ''Royal George'', revealed timber and guns from the ''[[Mary Rose]]'', the first time that its resting place had been located for several centuries.<ref name="bbc" />

===Pasley (1839)===
In 1839 Major-General [[Charles Pasley]], at the time a Colonel of the [[Royal Engineers]], commenced operations. Pasley had previously destroyed some old wrecks in the Thames to clear a channel using gunpowder charges; his plan was to break up the wreck of ''Royal George'' in a similar way and then salvage as much as possible using [[Underwater diving|divers]]. The charges used were made from oak barrels filled with gunpowder and covered with lead. They were initially detonated using chemical fuses, but this was later changed to an electrical system using a resistance-heated platinum wire to detonate the gunpowder.

Pasley's operation set many diving milestones, including the first recorded use of the [[buddy system]] in diving, when he ordered that his divers operate in pairs. In addition, a Corporal Jones made the first emergency swimming ascent after his air line became tangled and he had to cut it free. A less fortunate milestone was the first medical account of a [[Barotrauma#Diving barotrauma|diver squeeze]] suffered by a Private Williams: the early diving helmets used had no [[non-return valve]]s; this meant that if a hose became severed, the high-pressure air around the diver's head rapidly evacuated the helmet causing tremendous negative pressure that caused extreme and sometimes life-threatening effects. At the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] meeting in 1842, [[John Richardson (naturalist)|Sir John Richardson]] described the [[Standard diving dress|diving apparatus]] and treatment of diver Roderick Cameron following an injury that occurred on 14 October 1841 during the salvage operations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richardson J |title=Abstract of the case of a diver employed on the wreck of the Royal George, who was injured by the bursting of the air-pipe of the diving apparatus. 1842 |journal=Undersea Biomed Res |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=63<U+2013>4 |year=1991 |month=January |pmid=2021022 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2729 |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref>

Pasley recovered 12 more guns in 1839, 11 more in 1840, and 6 in 1841. In 1842 he recovered only one iron 12-pounder because he ordered the divers to concentrate on removing the hull timbers rather than search for guns. Other items recovered, in 1840, included the [[Ship's doctor |surgeon]]'s brass instruments, [[silk]] garments of [[satin]] weave 'of which the silk was perfect', and pieces of leather; but no woollen clothing.<ref>The Times, London, article CS117993292 dated 12 Oct 1840, retrieved 30 Apr 2004.</ref> By 1843 the whole of the keel and the bottom timbers had been raised and the site was declared clear.<ref>{{cite book | last = Percy | first = Sholto | authorlink = Joseph Clinton Robertson | coauthors = | title = Iron: An Illustrated Weekly Journal for Iron and Steel Manufacturers | publisher = Knight and Lacey | year = 1843 | volume = 39 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>

===Destruction===
In 1840, the broken wreckage was destroyed by the Royal Engineers in a huge controlled explosion that shattered windows as far away as Portsmouth and Gosport.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-14691988 |title=BBC News - The wreck that revealed the Mary Rose |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 4 September 2011|accessdate=2011-09-05}}</ref>

==Surviving timbers and guns==

In the 1850s, timber from the ship was used to make the billiard table, still in use today for the North Wing of [[Burghley House]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Welcome to Burghley visitor leaflet|publisher=www.burghley.co.uk}}</ref> Timber salvaged from the ''Royal George'' was also used to make the coffin for the famous menagerie owner [[George Wombwell]] who died in 1850.<ref>J.L. Middlemiss, ''A Zoo on Wheels: Bostock and Wombwell's Menagerie'' (Burton on Trent: Dalebrook Publications, 1987), p.11</ref>
Several of the salvaged bronze cannon were melted down to form the base of [[Nelson's column]] in London's [[Trafalgar Square]].<ref name="bbc" />
A 24 pounder from the ship is part of the [[Royal Armouries]] collection and is on display at [[Southsea Castle]].<ref name=Boxell1>{{cite book |title=The Ordnance of Southsea Castle |last=Boxell |first=A.L |year=2010 |publisher=Tricorn books |isbn=978-0-9562498-4-5|page=23}}</ref>
