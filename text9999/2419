The '''Jordan River''' in the U.S. state of [[Utah]] is a river about {{convert|51|mi|km}} long. Regulated by pumps at its headwaters at [[Utah Lake]], it flows northward through the [[Salt Lake Valley]] and empties into the [[Great Salt Lake]]. Four of Utah's five largest cities&mdash;[[Salt Lake City]], [[West Valley City, Utah|West Valley City]], [[West Jordan, Utah|West Jordan]] and [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]]&mdash;border the river. More than a million people live in the Jordan Subbasin, which is the part of the Jordan River watershed that lies within Salt Lake and Davis counties. During the [[Pleistocene]], the area was part of [[Lake Bonneville]].

Members of the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Desert Archaic Culture]] were the earliest known inhabitants of the region; an archaeological site found along the river dates back 3,000&nbsp;years. [[Mormon pioneers]] led by [[Brigham Young]] were the first [[European American]] settlers, arriving in July 1847 and establishing farms and settlements along the river and its tributaries. The growing population, needing water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use in an arid climate, dug ditches and canals, built dams, and installed pumps to create a highly regulated river.

Although the Jordan was originally a cold-water [[fishery]] with 13 native species including [[Bonneville cutthroat trout]], it has become a warm-water fishery where [[common carp]] is most abundant. Heavily polluted for many years by raw sewage, agricultural runoff, and mining wastes, the river became cleaner in the 1960s when modern sewage treatment removed many pollutants. In the 21st&nbsp;century, pollution is further limited by the [[Clean Water Act]], and, in some cases, the [[Superfund]] program. Once the home of [[bighorn sheep]] and [[beaver]], the contemporary river is frequented by [[raccoon]]s, [[red fox]]es, and domestic pets. Along with the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake, it is still an important avian resource visited by more than 200 bird species.

[[Big Cottonwood Creek|Big Cottonwood]], [[Little Cottonwood Creek|Little Cottonwood]], [[Red Butte Creek|Red Butte]], Mill, Parley's, and City creeks, as well as smaller streams flow through the subbasin. The [[Jordan River Parkway]] along the river includes natural areas, botanical gardens, golf courses and a proposed {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} bicycle and pedestrian trail, much of which has been completed.

==Course==

The Jordan River is the [[Utah Lake]]'s only outflow, and originates at the northern end of the lake between the cities of [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]] and [[Saratoga Springs, Utah|Saratoga Springs]].  It then meanders north through the [[Utah Valley]] for approximately {{convert|8|mi|km}} until it passes through a gorge in the [[Traverse Mountains]], known as the Jordan Narrows. The  [[Utah National Guard]] base at [[Camp W. G. Williams|Camp Williams]] lies on the western side of the river through much of the Jordan Narrows.<ref name="usgs">{{Citation | url=http://gis.utah.gov/sgid-scanned-maps/by-quad-name-usgs-scanned-topographic-maps-1-100000-geotiff | title=USGS Scanned Topographic Maps (1:100000, GeoTIFF) | publisher=Utah GIS Portal | accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref><ref name="utahgis">{{Citation | url=http://gis.utah.gov/sgid-vector-download/utah-sgid-vector-gis-data-layer-download-index?fc=Municipalities | title=Municipalities | work=Utah SGID: Vector GIS Data Layer Download Index  | publisher=Utah GIS Portal | accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>  The Turner Dam, located {{convert|41.8|mi|km}} from the river's mouth (or at [[river mile]] 41.8) and within the boundaries of the Jordan Narrows, is the first of two dams of the Jordan River.  The Turner dam diverts water to the right or easterly into the East Jordan Canal and to the left or westerly toward the Utah and Salt Lake Canal. Two pumping stations, situated next to the Turner Dam, divert water to the west into the Provo Reservoir Canal, Utah Lake Distribution Canal and Jacob-Welby Canal.  The Provo Reservoir Canal runs north through Salt Lake County, Jacob-Welby runs south through Utah County and the Utah Lake Distribution Canal runs both north and south eventually leading back into Utah Lake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hydrology of Northern Utah Valley|2005|pp=4<U+2013>31}}</ref>  Outside the narrows, the river reaches the second dam, known as the Joint Dam, which is {{convert|39.9|mi|km}} from the river's mouth. The Joint Dam diverts water to the east for the Jordan and Salt Lake City Canals and to the west for the South Jordan Canal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mead|1904|pp=55<U+2013>56}}</ref><ref name="Jordan River TMDL 2009 19">{{Harvnb|Jordan River TMDL|2009|p=19}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Utah Lake and Jordan River Water Rights and Management Plan|1989|pp=1<U+2013>2}}</ref>

The river then flows through the middle of the Salt Lake Valley, initially moving through the town of [[Bluffdale, Utah|Bluffdale]] and then forming the border between the cities of [[Riverton, Utah|Riverton]] and [[Draper, Utah|Draper]].<ref name="usgs" /> The river then enters the city of [[South Jordan, Utah|South Jordan]] where it merges with Midas Creek from the west. Upon leaving South Jordan, the river forms the border between the cities of West Jordan on the west and Sandy and [[Midvale, Utah|Midvale]] on the east.  From the west, Bingham Creek enters in West Jordan. Dry Creek, an eastern tributary, combines with the main river in Sandy. The river then forms the border between the cities of [[Taylorsville, Utah|Taylorsville]] and West Valley City on the west and [[Murray, Utah|Murray]] and [[South Salt Lake, Utah|South Salt Lake]] on the east.  The river flows underneath [[Interstate 215 (Utah)|Interstate 215]] in Murray.  Little and [[Big Cottonwood Creek]]s enter from the east in Murray, {{convert|21.7|mi|km}} and {{convert|20.6|mi|km}} from the mouth respectively. Mill Creek enters on the east in South Salt Lake, {{convert|17.3|mi|km}} from the mouth. The river runs through the middle of Salt Lake City, where the river travels underneath [[Interstate 80 (Utah)|Interstate 80]] a mile west of downtown of Salt Lake City and again underneath Interstate 215 in the northern portion of Salt Lake City.  [[Interstate 80 (Utah)|Interstate 15]] parallels the river's eastern flank throughout Salt Lake County. At {{convert|16|mi|km}} from the mouth, the river enters into the Surplus Canal channel.  The Jordan River physically diverts from the Surplus Canal through four gates and heads north with the Surplus Canal heading north-west.  Parley's, Emigration, Red Butte Creeks converge from the east through an underground pipe, {{convert|14.2|mi|km}} from the mouth.<ref name="usgs" /> City Creek also enters via an underground pipe, {{convert|11.5|mi|km}} from the river's mouth.  The length of the river and the elevation of its mouth varies year to year depending on the fluctuations of the Great Salt Lake caused by weather conditions. The lake has an average elevation of {{convert|4200|ft|m}} which can deviate by {{convert|10|ft|m}}.<ref name="GSLelevation" />  The Jordan River then continues for {{convert|9|to|12|mi|km}} with Salt Lake County on the west and [[North Salt Lake, Utah|North Salt Lake]] and Davis County on the east until it empties into the Great Salt Lake.<ref name="usgs" /><ref name="utahgis" /><ref name="Jordan River TMDL 2009 19"/>

===Discharge===

The [[United States Geological Survey]] maintains a [[stream gauge]] in Salt Lake City that shows annual runoff from the period between 1980<U+2013>2003 is just over {{convert|150,000|acre.ft|m3|lk=in}} per year or 19 percent of the total {{convert|800,000|acre.ft|m3|lk=in}} of water entering the Jordan River from all sources.  The Surplus Canal carries almost 60 percent of the water into the Great Salt Lake with various irrigation canals responsible for the rest.  The amount of water entering the Jordan River from Utah Lake is just over {{convert|400,000|acre.ft|m3|lk=in}} per year.  Inflow from the 11 largest streams feeding the Jordan River, sewage treatment plants and ground water each accounts for approximately 15 percent of water entering the river.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River TMDL|2009|pp=35<U+2013>39}}</ref>

==Watershed==

[[Image:Jordan River Basin.png|left|thumb|alt=The Jordan River Basin is in northern Utah.|Map of the entire Jordan River Basin]]

The Jordan Subbasin, as defined by the United States Geological Survey, is located entirely within Salt Lake and Davis counties in a roughly rectangular area of {{convert|791|sqmi|km2}}. The Subbasin is part of the larger {{convert|3830|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} Jordan River Basin that includes the upper Jordan River, Utah Lake, Provo and Spanish Fork Subbasins.<ref name="Hydro Survey Map p54" /><ref>{{Citation | url=http://watershed.org/?q=node/187 | title=Recommended Watershed Terminology | publisher=Watershed Management Council | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref>  Four of the five largest cities in Utah are in Salt Lake County. The Jordan River flows through Sandy, with a 2008 population of 96,660; West Jordan, population 104,447; West Valley City, population 123,447; and Salt Lake City, population 181,698.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2008-04-49.csv | title=Resident Population for Incorporated Places in Utah, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 (SUB-EST2008-04-49) | publisher=United States Census Bureau | date=July 1, 2009 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref>  Flanked on either side by mountain ranges, the topography of the land varies greatly. The [[Wasatch Mountains]] rise on the east, with a high point of {{convert|11100|ft|m}} above sea level at [[Twin Peaks (Utah)|Twin Peaks]], near the town of [[Alta, Utah|Alta]]. The [[Oquirrh Mountains]] rise on the west, with a high point of over {{convert|9000|ft|m}} above sea level at [[Farnsworth Peak]]. The low point of {{convert|4200|ft|m}} is at the river's mouth, where the river enters the Great Salt Lake.  Both the Oquirrh and Wasatch Mountains are [[fault-block mountain]]s created from [[Fault (geology)#Fault_types|normal-slip faults]] where the mountains rise at the fault and the valley floor drops.  The [[Wasatch Fault]] runs along the western edge of the Wasatch Mountains and the Oquirrh Fault runs along the eastern edge of the Oquirrh Mountains.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paleoseismic investigation on the Salt Lake City segment of the Wasatch zone at South Fork Dry Creek and Dry Gulch Sites, Salt Lake County, Utah|1996|pp=1<U+2013>3}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|The Oquirrh fault zone, Tooele County, Utah: surficial geology and paleoseismicity|1996|pp=1<U+2013>3}}</ref>

From approximately 75,000 to 8,000 years ago, much of what is now northern Utah was covered by a Pleistocene lake called [[Lake Bonneville]]. At its greatest extent, Lake Bonneville reached an elevation of {{convert|5200|ft|m}} above sea level and had a surface area of {{convert|19800|sqmi|km2}}. The lake left behind [[lacustrine plain|lacustrine sediments]], which resulted in a relatively flat lake bed, and the valley floors seen today. As the region experienced increasingly warmer and drier climate over time, Lake Bonneville's water levels receded, leaving the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake as remnants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geology of Utah Lake|1981|pp=25<U+2013>27}}</ref>  The river's greatest slope, {{convert|27|ft/mi|m/km}}, is in the Jordan Narrows, while the rest of the river has a more gentle slope of {{convert|2|to|4|ft/mi|m/km|1}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River Stability Study|1992|pp=3<U+2013>5}}</ref>

Approximately {{convert|237000|acre|km2}} (46 percent of land area) of the Jordan Subbasin is in the Wasatch, Oquirrh and Traverse mountains.<ref name="watershed">{{Citation | url=http://www.waterresources.slco.org/html/jwrc/jrWShed.html | title=Watershed Facts | work=Watershed Planning and Restoration Program | publisher=Salt Lake County | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref>  The [[United States Forest Service]] manages {{convert|91000|acre|km2}} of land in the Wasatch Range. The vast majority of the Oquirrh Range is privately held,<ref>{{Harvnb|Oquirrh Mountains|1999|p=2}}</ref> with [[Kennecott Copper Mine]] owning most of the land. The State of Utah has scattered land holdings of {{convert|9800|acre|km2}} throughout the subbasin and owns the beds of all navigable streams and lakes.<ref name=watershed />

The Jordan Subbasin has two distinct climate zones. The lower elevations are characterized as a [[Semi-arid climate#Cold Semi-arid climates|cold, semi-arid climate]], with four distinct seasons. Both summer and winter are long with hot, dry summers and cold, snowy winters. Salt Lake City receives {{convert|61|in|cm}} of snow annually, part of a total of {{convert|16.5|in|mm}} of precipitation per year.  The mean maximum temperature is {{convert|91|F|C}} in July and {{convert|37|F|C}} in January<ref>{{Harvnb|Salt Lake City Climatology|2004|pp=1<U+2013>3}}</ref>  Areas of higher elevation have two distinct seasons, summer and winter. One of the areas of highest elevation, Alta, Utah, receives {{convert|544|in|cm}} of snow annually, part of a total of {{convert|52|in|mm}} of precipitation per year.  The mean maximum temperature is {{convert|71|F|C}} in July and {{convert|29|F|C}} in January.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alta Climatology|2004|pp=1<U+2013>3}}</ref>

In 1776, Franciscan missionary [[Silvestre V<U+00E9>lez de Escalante]] was trying to find a land route from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]], to [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]]. His party included twelve Spanish colonials and two Utes from the Utah Valley Timpanogots band who acted as guides. On September 23, 1776, the party entered Utah Valley at the present-day city of [[Spanish Fork, Utah|Spanish Fork]]. The local Timanogots villagers hosted them and told them of the lake to the north.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/trappers,_traders,_and_explorers/dominguez-escalanteexpedition.html | last=Alexander | first=Thomas G. | title=Dominguez-Escalante Expedition | work=Utah History to Go | publisher=Utah State Historical Society | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>  In his journal, Escalante described Utah Lake as a "lake, which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long, [and] extends as far as one of these valleys. It runs northwest through a narrow passage, and according to what they told us, it communicates with others much larger."  The Great Salt Lake was described as the "other lake with which this one communicates, according to what they told us, [and] covers many leagues, and its waters are noxious and extremely salty."<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/gateway/diario/diary.html#september25 | title=Derrotero y Diario | work=Early Americas digital archive | publisher=Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>

The next group of Europeans to see the Jordan River was the party of [[<U+00C9>tienne Provost]], a [[French Canadian]] trapper. In October 1824, Provost's party was lured into a Shoshone camp somewhere along the Jordan River, where they were attacked in retaliation for the murder of a local chief.  In truth, the murder was committed by a member of [[Peter Skene Ogden]]'s party. The men were caught off guard, and fifteen perished, but Provost and two others escaped.<ref>{{Citation | last=Alter | first=Cecil | title=Journal of W.A.

On July 22, 1847, the first party of [[Mormon pioneers]] arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, and five days later another party led by [[Brigham Young]] crossed the Jordan River and bathed in the Great Salt Lake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bancroft|1889|p=263}}</ref>  The [[Jordan River|River Jordan]] drains the [[Sea of Galilee]] into the [[Dead Sea]] in a way which the settlers found remarkably similar to the way the as-yet-unnamed local river drained Utah Lake into the saline Great Salt Lake.  This similarity influenced the eventual name of the river, and on August 22, 1847, a conference was held and the name Western Jordan River was decided upon,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bancroft|1889|p=266}}</ref> although it was later shortened to the Jordan River. By 1850, settlements were established along the Jordan River, Big Cottonwood Creek, Little Cottonwood Creek, Mill Creek, Parley's Creek and Emigration Creek.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River Basin Planning for the Future|2010|p=24}}</ref>  In 1850, Captain [[Howard Stansbury]] of the [[United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers#History|United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]] traveled the entire length of the Jordan River,<ref>{{Harvnb|Stansbury|1852|pp=156<U+2013>157}}</ref> surveying<ref>{{Harvnb|Stansbury|1852|p=297}}</ref> and making observations of the wildlife.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stansbury|1852|pp=307<U+2013>397}}</ref>

Around the year 1887 at [[Bingham Canyon, Utah|Bingham Canyon]] in the Oquirrh Mountains, low-grade copper deposits were discovered and [[mining claim]]s were filed.  Bingham Canyon is a [[porphyry copper deposit]] where [[magma]] containing copper, molybdenum, gold and other minerals slowly moved its way to the surface and cooled into rock.<ref>{{Citation | last=Tooker | first=Edwin | title=Gold in the Bingham district, Utah | journal=US Geological Survey Bulletin | volume=1857-E | year=1990}}</ref>  By 1890, underground copper mining had started, and in 1907, Kennecott Copper Mine started [[open pit mining]].<ref>{{Citation | editor-first=Kent | editor-last=Powell | url=http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/k/KENNECOTT.html | title=Kennecott Corporation | encyclopedia=Utah History Encyclopedia | year=1994 | publisher=University of Utah Press | location=Salt Lake City | accessdate=March 21, 2010}}</ref>  In the early 20th century, mills were established near the Jordan River in Midvale and West Jordan to process ore.

Throughout the 19th century and up to the 1940s, water from the Jordan River watershed sustained the agrarian society of the Salt Lake Valley. In 1950, Salt Lake County had {{convert|489000|acre|ha}} devoted to farming.<ref>{{Harvnb|1950 Census of Agriculture|1950|p=3}}</ref>  By 1992, however, the rapid urbanization of the Salt Lake Valley had reduced the amount of land devoted to farming to {{convert|108000|acre|ha}},<ref>{{Harvnb|1992 Census of Agriculture|1992|p=3}}</ref> which was further reduced to {{convert|82267|acre|ha}} by 2002.<ref>{{Harvnb|2002 Census of Agriculture|2002|p=3}}</ref>

===River modifications===

Alterations of the Jordan River watershed began two days after the Mormon Pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley when water was diverted from City Creek for irrigation.<ref>{{Citation | first=Thomas G. | last=Alexander | title=Irrigating the Mormon Heartland: The Operation of the Irrigation Companies in Wasatch Oasis Communities, 1847<U+2013>1880 | journal=Agricultural History | volume=6 | issue=2 | pages=172<U+2013>197 | date=Spring 2002 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bancroft|1889|p=261}}</ref>  The earliest dam and ditch along the Jordan River was constructed in 1849 to irrigate land on the west side of the river near present-day Taylorsville.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mead|1904|p=55}}</ref>  Other ditches include one built by [[Archibald Gardner]], one of the founders of West Jordan in 1850, to provide water for his mill and one built by Alexander Beckstead, a founder of South Jordan, who built the Beckstead Ditch in 1859 to provide water for farmland. Many other small dams and ditches were also constructed in the first 25&nbsp;years, several of which are still used as of 2010.

By the late 1860s, it became apparent that new, larger canals needed to be built if more acreage was to be farmed. The first dam in the Jordan Narrows was constructed in 1872 and raised in 1880, sparking an outcry from residents living near Utah Lake who thought the dam was responsible for raising the level of the lake. After several years of dispute, a commission was established to determine an acceptable compromise for the elevation of Utah Lake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mead|1904|pp=63<U+2013>64}}</ref>  The commission's 1885 decision stated that if the lake level were to rise above the established compromise level, the Jordan River could not be impeded by either dams or flood gates.  Additionally, the commission stated that after water pumps were installed at the source of the river, the pumps should all be working if the lake were to rise above the compromise level.  However, if the lake level fell below the compromise level, pumps could be turned off so that water could be held for storage in Utah Lake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Utah Lake and Jordan River Water Rights and Management Plan|1989|pp=2<U+2013>3}}</ref>

In 1875, the first large canal, the South Jordan Canal, was completed and it brought water to the area above the bluffs of the Jordan River for the first time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mead|1904|p=42}}</ref>  All told, five large canals that originated from the dams in the Jordan Narrows were completed by 1883.<ref name="Mead 1904 60"/>  A second dam was built in 1890 a few miles downstream from the first dam and was constructed to better regulate the flow of two canals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mead|1904|pp=64<U+2013>65}}</ref>  Both dams have been rebuilt in subsequent years and operate as diversion points for canals rather than impounding water by the use of [[sluice gate]]s and head gates.  The drought of 1901<U+2013>1902 caused the Jordan River, on occasion, to stop flowing, and in response to the drought a pumping plant was installed at the outlet from Utah Lake. It was the largest pumping plant in the United States at the time, and contained seven pumps with a total capacity of {{convert|700|cuft|m3}} per second.<ref>{{Harvnb|Utah Lake and Jordan River Water Rights and Management Plan|1989|pp=8<U+2013>9}}</ref>  Twice, during the droughts of 1934 and 1992, Utah Lake levels dropped so low that the pumps were rendered useless and the Jordan River actually ran dry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Utah Lake and Jordan River Water Rights and Management Plan|1989|p=28}}</ref>  In the 1950s, due to flood control measures to increase river velocity, large sections of the river were straightened in Salt Lake County.  As part of the straightening process, meanders or curves in the river were cut off and the channel slope was increased.  The river was also shifted to opposite sides of the flood plain in Midvale and Murray as part of local [[smelter]] operations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River Stability Study|1992|loc=section 3, pp. 9<U+2013>12}}</ref>

Floods in 1983<U+2013>1984 caused Utah Lake to overflow its banks, flooding homes and farmland in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], Lehi and present-day Saratoga Springs. Dikes had to be constructed around [[Interstate 15]] in Provo to prevent Utah Lake flooding the freeway. Big Cottonwood, Parley's, Emigration and City creeks flowed down sand-bag lined streets in order to manage the overflowing streams. Additional dikes were built at the Great Salt Lake to protect railroad lines and [[Interstate 80]].<ref>{{Citation | url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/utah_today/floods.html |last=Sillitoe|first=Linda| title=Floods | work=Utah History to Go | publisher=Utah State Historical Society | accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=33UnAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LIMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4908%2C4432175 |last=Davidson|first=Leo|  title=Floods cause extensive damage as sun melts heavy snowpack | newspaper=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City | date=May 27, 1983 | accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>  As a result of the flooding, the Utah Lake compromise level was amended to {{convert|4489|ft|m}}.<ref name="Utah Lake and Jordan River Water Rights and Management Plan 1989 4"/>

==Ecology==
===Invertebrates and fish===

[[Image:LakePowellCarp5437.jpg|thumb|right|[[Common carp]] from [[Lake Powell]]|alt=photo of several fish in the water]]
In the Jordan River, [[invertebrates]] not only play an important role as a source of food for fish and other aquatic life, they also function as a parameter by which to measure water quality and the health of the river.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River TMDL|2007|p=91}}</ref>  There are 34 different groups of invertebrates found in the Jordan River, most commonly of the class [[Oligochaeta]] (which includes [[earthworms]]), along with [[mosquito]] larvae and [[caddisfly]] larvae. The state of Utah maintains a Sensitive Species List that includes "those species for which there is credible scientific evidence to substantiate a threat to continued population viability."<ref>{{Harvnb|Utah Sensitive Species List|2007|p=1}}</ref> The Lyrate mountainsnail<ref>{{Harvnb|Utah Sensitive Species List|2007|pp=81<U+2013>82}}</ref> and the [[Margaritifera|western pearlshell mussel]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Utah Sensitive Species List|2007|pp=100<U+2013>102}}</ref> both native to the Jordan River watershed, are found on this list.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River Basin Planning for the Future|2010|p=185}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Fishery and Macroinvertebrate Studies|1986|p=32}}</ref>  A 2007 survey of invertebrates and their response to pollution stated that the Jordan River was substantially to severely impaired with organic pollution and that it contained reduced levels of dissolved oxygen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River TMDL|2007|pp=93<U+2013>94}}</ref>

Historically, the Jordan River was a cold-water fishery that contained 13 native species, including the [[Bonneville cutthroat trout]], [[Utah Lake sculpin]], [[June sucker]], [[Mottled sculpin]], [[Utah chub]] and the [[Utah Sucker]]. Today, the Jordan River is a warm-water fishery with the Utah Sucker and the [[Endangered species|endangered]] June Sucker present only in Utah Lake. The Utah chub, however, is still found in the Jordan River.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.junesuckerrecovery.org/utah-nati.html | title=Utah Lake: Native Fish Community  | publisher=June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program | accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref>  The most common species of fish encountered today is the [[common carp]], which was introduced into the Jordan River and Utah Lake as a source of food after overfishing caused the depletion of native species stocks.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KZQdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NjEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1560,916030&dq=canal+jordan-river&hl=en | title=Isciculture in Utah | newspaper=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City | date=November 9, 1889 | accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Carp In Utah Lake Impacting Ecosystem|2004|p=1}}</ref>  The [[Utah Division of Wildlife Resources]] regularly stocks the river with [[catfish]] and [[rainbow trout]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River TMDL|2007|pp=96<U+2013>98}}</ref>

===Wildlife===
===Vegetation===

[[Image:rubber rabbitbrush 01.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A plant in bloom along a river and trail|Rubber rabbitbrush along the Jordan River Parkway]]

Vegetation in the watershed is closely tied to elevation and precipitation levels. About 30 percent of the basin, mostly at higher elevation levels, is populated with [[oak]], [[aspen]] and [[conifer]]ous trees. At the lower levels, 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain-brush, [[sagebrush]], [[Juniperus osteosperma|juniper]] and grasses. About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified as urban.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River Basin Planning for the Future|2010|pp=6<U+2013>7}}</ref>

[[Russian olive]] and [[tamarisk]] or salt cedar trees now dominate the Jordan River floodplain where [[willow trees]] and [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood trees]] would once have been found. Plant species such as [[foxtail barley]], [[saltgrass]], [[Chrysothamnus|rabbitbrush]], [[cattails]] and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River Natural Conservation Corridor Report|2000|loc=section 2, p. 18}}</ref> Exotic pasture grasses such as [[orchard grass]], [[poa|bluegrass]], [[Agrostis gigantea|redtop bentgrass]], [[quackgrass]], [[wheatgrass]] and [[fescue]] have become the common species of grass.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River Natural Conservation Corridor Report|2000|loc=section 2, p.20}}</ref> The [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] flower, [[Spiranthes diluvialis|Ute's Ladies'-tresses]], can also be found along the river.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River Basin Planning for the Future|2010|p=184}}</ref>

==Pollution==

The Jordan River has been a repository for waste since the settling of the Salt Lake Valley. For 100 years, raw, untreated sewage was dumped into the river; farming and animal runoff occurred; and mining operations led to 40 smelters being built and contaminating the river with heavy metals, mostly [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|arsenic]] and [[lead]]. In 1962, the river in Midvale recorded a total [[coliform]] level of about 3 million per 100 milliliters,<ref>{{Citation | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&dat=19621117&id=eDsjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HEoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6634,4068310 | title=Pollution Unit Calls For River Action | publisher=''Deseret News'' | location=Salt Lake City | date=November 16, 1972 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref> even though the state of Utah criteria for the total number of coliform bacteria in water samples should not exceed 5,000 per 100 milliliters. In 1965, a new sewage treatment plant came on-line in Salt Lake City that prevented {{convert|32000000|USgal/d|m3/d}} of raw sewage from being dumped into a canal.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.ci.slc.ut.us/utilities/NewsEvents/news1998/news9281998-1.htm | title=Conduits of Civilization | publisher=Salt Lake City | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>

The [[Utah Division of Water Quality]] and Utah Division of Drinking Water are responsible for the regulation and management of water quality in the State of Utah. Streams that exceed the standard contamination levels are placed on the 303d list in accordance with the [[Clean Water Act]]. The Act also requires states to identify impaired water bodies every two years and develop a [[total maximum daily load]] (TMDL) for pollutants that may cause impairments in the various water bodies.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.waterquality.utah.gov/TMDL/ | title=Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) | publisher=Utah Division of Water Quality | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref>  The Jordan River and Little Cottonwood Creek were included on the 2006 303d list; parameters that exceeded the standard level for at least part of the Jordan River include temperature, [[Dissolved oxygen#Environmental sciences|dissolved oxygen]], [[total dissolved solids]], ''[[Escherichia coli|E. Coli]]'' and salinity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Utah's 2006 Integrated Report Volume II <U+2013> 303(d) List of Impaired Waters|2006|pp=II<U+2013>26 to II<U+2013>27}}</ref>

===EPA Superfund sites===

[[List of Superfund sites in the United States|Superfund sites]] are designated as being among the nation's worst areas with respect to toxic and [[hazardous waste]]. The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares a course of action to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the [[Superfund]] program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.scorecard.org/env-releases/def/land_gen.html | title=Superfund and Other Sources of Land Contamination <U+2013> National Overview | publisher=Green Media Toolshed | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref>

The Kennecott South Zone/Bingham site contains contamination from Kennecott Copper Mine's operation in [[Copperton, Utah|Copperton]], at the base of the [[Oquirrh Mountains]] to Bingham Creek and Butterfield Creek.  A {{convert|72|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} plume of lead, arsenic and [[Sulfates#Environmental effects|sulfates]] (covering 9 percent of the watershed) currently contaminates the ground water from the mine site all the way to the Jordan River. The largest inland [[reverse osmosis]] plant in the country was built in 2006 to clean up the ground water and a second plant has been scheduled for construction; completion of the ground water cleanup, however, is not projected until 2040. In 1998, the site was removed from the Superfund list due to Kennecott's progress in the cleanup and a [[consent decree]] legally obligating Kennecott to continue the rest of the cleanup.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/ut/kennecottsouth/ | title=Kennecott South Zone/Bingham Superfund Program | publisher=Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.allbusiness.com/environment-natural-resources/toxic-hazardous/11813303-1.html | first=Francis | last=Johnson | title=Kennecott invests $400 million in removing Utah land from proposed inclusion on EPA's Superfund list | publisher=The Enterprise | location=Salt Lake City | date=February 16, 2009 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:Jordan River (Utah) in Midvale.JPG||thumb|left|alt=A river with plants on either side. A hill rises on the right side.|The river next to capped [[tailings]] from the Sharon Steel Superfund site]]
The Murray Smelter site was the location of a large lead smelter in operation from 1872 until 1949. The {{convert|142|acre|ha|adj=on}} site contained groundwater contamination from [[arsenic]] and lead, but the majority of the cleanup was completed in 2001.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/ut/murray/index.html | title=Murray Smelter Superfund Program | publisher=Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>

In Midvale, there are two Superfund sites that sit along 4 percent of the Jordan River. The Midvale Slag site is a {{convert|446|acre|ha|adj=on}} site adjacent to {{convert|6800|ft|m}} of the Jordan River. From 1871 to 1958, the site contained five separate smelters that processed ores from Kennecott and other mines. The site was contaminated with lead, arsenic, [[Chromium#Precautions|chromium]], and [[Cadmium#Toxicity|cadmium]]. Cleanup of the property is complete, although the Jordan River Riparian Project still underway as of 2010.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/ut/midvale/ | title=Midvale Slag Superfund Program | publisher=Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Riparian Improvement Project Fact Sheet|2008|pp=1<U+2013>3}}</ref> [[Sharon Steel Corporation|Sharon Steel]] was a {{convert|460|acre|ha|adj=on}} site adjacent to {{convert|4500|ft|m}} of the Jordan River which was used, from 1902 to 1971, for smelting copper from Kennecott Copper Mine. The site was contaminated with lead, arsenic, [[Iron#Precautions|iron]], [[Manganese#Precautions|manganese]], and [[Zinc#Environmental impact|zinc]]. Cleanup has been completed, and the site taken off the Superfund list in 2004.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/ut/sharonsteel/index.html | title=Sharon Steel Superfund Program | publisher=Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>

===Uranium mill tailings===

Vitro Uranium Mill was a {{convert|128|acre|ha|adj=on}} site located in South Salt Lake, surrounded by the Jordan River, Mill Creek, a small wetland and traversed by the South Vitro Ditch. The site, operational from 1953 to 1964, contained a [[uranium]] mill and storage for uranium. In 1989, surface contamination cleanup was completed with tailings, radioactively contaminated soil material, and debris removed from the site.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/umtra/salt_lake_title1.html | title=Salt Lake City Mill Site | publisher=United States Department of Energy, U.S. Energy Information Administration | date=October, 2005 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>  However, {{convert|700000000|USgal|m3}} of contaminated shallow ground water still remain, and studies are underway to determine what action should be taken.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan River Basin Planning for the Future|2010|p=167}}</ref>
