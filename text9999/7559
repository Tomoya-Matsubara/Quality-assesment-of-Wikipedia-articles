He was selected in the fifth round, 116th overall by the [[San Jose Sharks]] in the [[1995 NHL Entry Draft]].  He has also played for [[TPS (ice hockey)|TPS]] of the Finnish [[SM-liiga]] as well as [[AIK Hockey|AIK]] and [[Timr<U+00E5> IK]] of the Swedish [[Elitserien]].  He has represented Finland several times on the international stage, earning silver medals at the [[World Ice Hockey Championships]] in 1999 and 2001, as well as leading the Finns to a surprise second place finish at the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]]. He also helped the Finnish national hockey team win the bronze medal at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].

Kiprusoff began his professional career with TPS in 1994, and was named the [[Urpo Yl<U+00F6>nen trophy|best goaltender]] and [[Jari Kurri trophy|best player of the playoffs]] in 1999 as he led them to the [[Kanada-malja|SM-liiga championship]]. He moved to North America in 1999, and after two all-star seasons in the [[American Hockey League]], made his NHL debut with the Sharks where he served primarily as a backup.  A trade to Calgary in [[2003<U+2013>04 NHL season|2003<U+2013>04]] brought Kiprusoff into a starting role and he set a modern NHL record for lowest [[goals against average]] at 1.69 as he helped the Flames reach the [[2004 Stanley Cup Final]].  He won the [[Vezina Trophy]] as the best goaltender in the NHL in 2006 along with the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for giving up the fewest goals in the league.  He played in his first [[NHL All-Star Game]] in 2007 and is the Flames franchise record holder in [[shutout]]s.

He first played with the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|senior team]] at the [[1999 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] where he recorded a 1.16 [[Goals against average]] in four games to help Finland win the silver medal.  He rejoined the team for the [[2001 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2001 tournament]], again leading the Finns to a silver medal.<ref name="MediaGuideBio" />

He was offered a spot on the Finnish team for the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]], but declined citing a desire to focus on his professional career in North America.<ref>{{cite web |last=McKeon |first=Ross |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article/article?f=/c/a/2001/12/12/SP217245.DTL |title=Kiprusoff says no to Games invite |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2001-12-12 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> Kiprusoff was named the starting goaltender for the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], and earned a shutout against the [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47993-2004Aug30.html |title=Kiprusoff leads Finns in opener |work=Washington Post |date=2004-08-31 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> He posted four wins and a tie, including a second shutout, and a 1.18 GAA to lead the upstart Finns into the championship game against [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Burnside |first=Scott |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/worldcup04/columns/story?id=1880238 |title=Goalie forces foes to take Finns seriously |publisher=ESPN |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref>  In spite of his 30 saves, the Finns were defeated by Canada 3<U+2013>2.  Kiprusoff did not play his best game in the final according to head coach [[Raimo Summanen]], though he expressed pride in his team's effort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/09/14/wcoh040914.html |title=Team Canada captures World Cup over Finland |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref>

Kiprusoff again declined an invitation to play at the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympics]] citing the need to rest a hip injury.  His announcement generated considerable controversy in Finland where the fact that he did not miss a game with the Flames due to the injury led some to question if he was injured at all.<ref>{{cite web |last=MacFarlane |first=Steve |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Olympics/2010Vancouver/News/2009/11/23/11894516-sun.html |title=It's starter or nothing for Kipper |publisher=Sun Media |date=2009-11-23 |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref>  Country-mate [[Teemu Sel<U+00E4>nne]] questioned the goaltender's lack of interest in playing for the national team, a comment that stung Kiprusoff.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Vicki |url=http://www.faceoff.com/story.html?id=c79ea78d-0ccb-4e25-9cac-3a3f7a799fce |title=Kiprusoff dekes media, again |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref>  When considered to play for the Finns at the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver, he said he would join the team, but only if he felt healthy and if he was named the starting goaltender for the team.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cruickshank |first=Scott |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Kiprusoff+Finnish+backup/2259515/story.html |title=Kiprusoff won't be Finnish backup |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> Kiprusoff was named the starter and allowed only four goals in his team's first four games, leading the Finns to a semifinal game against the United States.
