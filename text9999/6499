==Plot==
After [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] sabotages [[Principal Skinner]]'s [[weather balloon]], Skinner decides to punish him by having him help with his amateur [[astronomy]]. Skinner dreams of finding something in the sky and having it named after him. Bart accidentally locates a [[comet]] which is named after him. Scientists soon discover that the comet is heading straight for [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. [[Professor Frink]] plans to launch a [[missile]] at the comet, dispelling everyone's fears. However, the missile flies past the comet, instead blowing up the only bridge out of town, dooming the town.

After a [[United States Congress|Congress]] bill to evacuate Springfield is defeated, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] decides that they should stay in the [[bomb shelter]] that [[Ned Flanders]] built. Anticipating this, Ned had built it large enough for both families. One hour before Springfield is destroyed, the rest of the townspeople arrive, demanding a place in the bunker. Homer is unable to close the door and someone has to leave. Homer decides that the only thing the "world of the future" will not need is [[left-handed]] stores and tells Ned to go. Eventually, Homer feels guilty and leaves as well, followed by the other townspeople and they all converge on a hill to await death. As the comet enters the atmosphere, it burns up in the thick layer of [[pollution]] over Springfield, popping Skinner's weather balloon and destroying Ned's bunker on the way. The town decides to burn down the observatory to prevent a similar incident from ever happening again.

The episode was written by [[John Swartzwelder]] and directed by [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]]. After seeing an issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which presented the threat of comets hitting Earth on its cover, the writing staff decided to have an episode based on the concept of a comet hitting Springfield. They fleshed out the episode's plot over several days and Swartzwelder then set about writing the details of the script.<ref name="Mirkin"/> According to [[showrunner]] [[David Mirkin]], examples of "Swartzwelder humor" in the episode include the American fighter pilots mistaking [[Groundskeeper Willie]] for an Iraqi jet and cutting to [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] and [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Jasper Beardley|Jasper]] outside a 1940s [[General store]].<ref name="Mirkin">Mirkin, David.

[[Kent Brockman]]'s list of gay people is comprised of the show's production staff, who had to sign legal agreements that they would not sue their own show.
