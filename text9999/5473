'''Eleanor Norcross''', born '''Ella Augusta Norcross''' (1854<U+2013>1923), was an American painter who studied under [[William Merritt Chase]] and [[Alfred Stevens (painter)|Alfred Stevens]]. She lived the majority of her adult life in [[Paris]], France as an artist and collector and spent the summers in her hometown of [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]]. Norcross painted [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] portraits and still lifes, and is better known for her paintings of [[wiktionary:genteel|genteel]] interiors.

Her father provided her a comfortable living, under the [[wiktionary:proviso|proviso]] that she would not sell her paintings. With a life mission to provide people from her hometown the ability to view great works of art, Norcross collected art, made copies of paintings of [[Old Master]]s, and systematically documented decorative arts from the 12th through the 19th century. Her funding and art collection were used to establish the [[Fitchburg Art Museum]].

In 1924, her works were shown posthumously in Paris at the [[Louvre]] and [[Salon d'Automne]], where Norcross was the first American to have had a retrospective. Her works were also shown the following year at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].

==Career==

===Father's influence===
Her father provided financial support that allowed Norcross to live comfortably. She exhibited her works in [[art gallery|salons]], according to the agreement with her father that she would not sell any of them;<ref name="Salute to Women" /> he believed that women should give their works away and not enter into the male-oriented business world.<ref name=Mission /> Any paintings that she wanted to give away, Mr. Norcross offered to have "handsomely framed".<ref name="Murray p. 15" />

She lived in Paris for 40 years, and traveled throughout Europe.<ref name="Society p. 77" /> Her father lived with her during the winters after his retirement and until 1898, when he died.<ref name="Society p. 77" /> Joined by his daughter, Amasa Norcross spent his summers in Fitchburg.<ref name=Mission />

===Style and paintings===
Norcross painted portraits and still lifes,<ref name="Society p. 77" /><ref name="Danilov p. 83" /> and she made copies of [[Old Master]]s.<ref name="Danilov p. 83" /> Her portraits and later interiors{{#tag:ref|[[<U+00C9>douard Vuillard]] may have influenced Norcross's interiors, according to Traute M. Marshall, author of ''Art Museums Plus''.<ref name="Marshall p. 162" />|group="nb"}} were executed with "delicate brush strokes".<ref name="Society p. 77" /><ref name="Danilov p. 83" /> She had an adept sense of color and the ability to portray reflections and textures, like metal's gleam, satin's sheen, and velvet's texture. The compositions of her interiors are positioned in a way that leads the viewer to consider what might be through a door or around a corner, as in ''Carpeaux Sevres''.<ref name="Murray p. 16" />

Her painting, ''Woman in a Garden'', reflects influences of Chase, [[Claude Monet|Monet]] and [[French Impressionism]] combined with the skill to draw with a paintbrush learned from Alfred Stevens. Reminiscent of Chase's ''[[en plein air]]'' paintings, the dark background contrasts with the enigmatic, illuminated woman.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ann H. Murray | title=Eleanor Norcross: Artist, Collector and Social Reformer | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1357976| work=Women's Art Journal | date=Autumn 1981 <U+2013> Winter 1982 | pages=15<U+2013>16 | accessdate=September 19, 2014 }}</ref> ''My Studio'' (1891)<U+2014>which depicts her father in an room with "elaborately patterned textiles", antique and oriental furnishings, and flowers<U+2014>is "the most impressive" of her works at the Fitchburg Art Museum. It was also her image of an "ideal home".<ref name=Mission /><ref name="Murray p. 15" /> Of it, Ann H. Murray writes:

{{quote|...the painting itself is reminiscent of Chase in the informality and candidness that pervade the composition. The vacant chair, the mirror reflecting spaces not directly perceivable, and the abundance of rectangular units that impose a geographic organization on the wall<U+2014>all these features occur also in Chase's paintings, as well as in those of [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and [[Mary Cassatt|Cassatt]] who were, along with Monet, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], among her personal acquaintances.<ref name="Murray p. 15" />}}

She exhibited from 1887 until her death in [[Champ de Mars]]' [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nationale des Beaux-Arts]], which was made possible through her close friendship with [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes|Puvis de Chavannes]].<ref name="Murray p. 15" /><ref>{{ cite journal | title=Paris Salon Exhibit Opens:Tone of Paintings Leans Towards Tempered Impressionism | date=April 16, 1908 | work=The Washington Post | page=3 }}</ref> Her works were also shown in Boston, Chicago, and New York City.<ref name="Norcross Bio FAM" /> Norcross shared a studio with Alix d'Anethan, whose paintings, influenced by Puvis, were of pastoral and contemporary life.<ref name="Murray p. 17" />

Norcross began to collect historical European artwork, particularly to be shown in public places in or near her hometown.<ref name="Murray p. 17">{{cite journal | author=Ann H.

===Collection===
She began purchasing art objects with the intention of sending them to America, so that people that were not afforded the luxury of traveling to Europe could view good works of art.<ref name="Danilov p. 83" /> Norcross collected furniture, textiles, porcelains, and other objects during visits to quiet French villages.<ref name="Murray p. 16" />

Works from her collection were given to Wheaton College in 1922 during her 50th-year reunion, including an oil sketch by Alix d'Anethan and a seascape by Alfred Stevens.<ref name="Murray p. 16" /> She loaned her paintings to the Worcester Art Museum,<ref name="Museum1917">{{cite book|author=Worcester Art Museum|title=Report of the Trustees, Officers and List of Sustaining Members|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bwdZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA20|year=1917|publisher=The Museum|pages=20, 24, 27}}</ref> and the Fitchburg Public Library was a beneficiary of photographs, prints, engravings,<ref>{{cite book|author=Fitchburg, Mass.
