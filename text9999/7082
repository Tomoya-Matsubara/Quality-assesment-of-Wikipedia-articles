The University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, formerly known as the Exhibit Museum of Natural History, began in the mid-19th century and expanded greatly with the donation of 60,000 specimens by Joseph Beal Steere, an UM alumnus, in the 1870s. Today, the collections are primarily housed and displayed in the Ruthven Museums Building which was completed in 1928.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/exhibitmuseum/about/history | title=History | publisher=University of Michigan Exhibit Museum of Natural History | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> The Ruthven Building includes a [[planetarium]] and exhibits on [[geology]], [[paleontology]] in Michigan, Michigan wildlife, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture and anthropology.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/exhibitmuseum/about/facts | title=Museum Facts | publisher=University of Michigan Exhibit Museum of Natural History | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref>
