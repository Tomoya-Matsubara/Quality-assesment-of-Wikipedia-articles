It guest starred [[Martin Sheen]] as the real Seymour Skinner. Although it was produced by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] as part of the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]] production code, it aired during the ninth season as a holdover.<ref name=bbc/> The title of the episode is a reference to the book ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'' by [[Mark Twain]].<ref name=bbc/>

"The Principal and the Pauper" has become one of the most controversial episodes of ''The Simpsons''. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the fact that Principal Skinner, who had been a recurring character since the first season, was suddenly revealed to be an imposter. The episode received criticism from series creator [[Matt Groening]] and [[Harry Shearer]], the voice actor of Principal Skinner. Despite this, Ken Keeler considers the episode to be the best work he has ever done for television. The episode received generally negative reviews in several articles and books on ''The Simpsons''.

==Plot==
[[Image:PrincipalandthePauper.JPG|left|200px|thumb|The real Seymour Skinner is sent out of town.]]
[[Seymour Skinner]] prepares to celebrate his 20th anniversary as school principal. The celebration goes well, until a man arrives who claims his name is Seymour Skinner and that [[Agnes Skinner]] is his biological mother. Principal Skinner admits he is not the real Seymour Skinner, and is an impostor named Armin Tamzarian. He reveals he was a punk who stole an old woman's purse and hit a judge with a motorcycle in his teenage years. The judge gave him three choices: apologize, join the army, or jail. Armin chose the army, unaware that the country was in the middle of the [[Vietnam War]]. There he met the real Sergeant Seymour Skinner and warmed up to him as a friend. Skinner showed Armin his mother's picture in a locket and said that his dream was to be an elementary school principal. Seymour eventually ran a clearing just as someone bombed the place, causing Armin to take the news of Seymour's death to his mother. He could not do it, however, and instead assumed Skinner's identity. Agnes also could not accept that her son had died, and whispered to Armin that "your room is the third door on the left," implying she knew the truth but accepted his ruse.

Now that the real Skinner has turned up alive, he still wants to fulfil his dream, and argues that since someone pretending to be him had the job of school principal, the real one ought to be even better at it (it is unclear if the real Skinner actually possessed any qualifications for the position prior to being stationed in Vietnam). He gets the job, but it soon turns out that [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] prefers Tamzarian over the real Skinner. Tamzarian, however, had left Springfield and gone to [[Capital City (The Simpsons)|Capital City]] on his old [[motorcycle]]. Marge devises a plan to get Tamzarian back to Springfield, and she heads off for Capital City with Homer, Lisa, [[Edna Krabappel]], [[Agnes Skinner]], [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]], Bart, Maggie and for an unknown reason, Jasper. After Agnes orders Armin to return home, Homer convinces Mayor Quimby and all the other citizens to allow Armin to stay. However, Sergeant Skinner refuses to give up his dignity just because they prefer Armin over him. Homer comes up with a way of letting Skinner keep his dignity and let Armin Tamzarian get his old job back. The plan consists of giving Sergeant Skinner a "dignified" parade which actually serves to run him out of town, tied to a chair on a [[freight train]] car. Tamzarian returns to his role as Principal Skinner through an order by [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Judge Roy Snyder|Judge Snyder]]. Judge Snyder declares that no one will mention "Tamzarian" again under penalty of [[torture]] and that Tamzarian will retain the name of Principal Skinner, rather than using his birth name.

==Production==
"The Principal and the Pauper" was the last episode written by [[Ken Keeler]], who had also pitched the original idea for the episode. Keeler would often be given difficult episodes to write. At the time of production, there was little opposition, although Harry Shearer was "a little peeved."<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Principal and the Pauper"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] was a favorite of Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and they felt that the episode would be an interesting exploration of who he was.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Principal and the Pauper"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Keeler named the fake Seymour after Armin Tamzarian, a [[claims adjuster]] who assisted after a car accident years before.<ref name="Keeler"/> Tamzarian later became a lawyer in the firm that represented the series.<ref name="Oakley"/> [[Martin Sheen]] was selected to voice the real Seymour Skinner because the producers loved his performance in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', feeling his voice would be an appropriate fit for a Vietnam veteran.<ref name="Weinstein"/> One of the possible titles of the episode was "Skinnersby", a reference to the film ''[[Sommersby]]''.<ref name="Moore">{{cite video | people=Moore, Steven Dean|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Principal and the Pauper"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The title of the episode is a reference to the book ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'' by [[Mark Twain]].<ref name=bbc/>

==Controversy==
"The Principal and the Pauper" caused much controversy amongst fans and critics, who reacted negatively to the episode.<ref name="Moore"/> [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] had been a recurring character since the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]], and his character was suddenly changed after years of development when he was revealed to be an imposter. The episode ended with a self-referential [[deus ex machina]], which left viewers to either "reset" or accept the change.<ref name="Turner"/> Bill Oakley considers it the most controversial episode of his tenure as executive producer.<ref name="Oakley"/> 

===Concept===
{{cquote|This episode is about a community of people who like things just the way they are. Skinner's not really close to these people - he's a minor character - but they get upset when someone comes in and says 'this is not really the way things are' and they run the messenger out of town on the rail. And when the episode aired, lo and behold, a community of people who like things just the way they are got mad. It never seems to have occurred to anyone that this episode is about the people who hate it.|20px|20px|Ken Keeler<ref name="Keeler"/>}}

The producers decided to try something different for the episode, but many fans reacted negatively.<ref name="Weinstein"/> During their time as showrunners, Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein liked to make episodes that pushed the boundaries. This episode was proposed in the same vein, although they feel that part of the problem is that it didn't initially present itself as being an envelope pusher.<ref name="Oakley"/> Ken Keeler based the script on the [[Tichborne Case]], not the story of [[Martin Guerre]] as is commonly believed.<ref name="Keeler">{{cite video | people=Keeler, Ken|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Principal and the Pauper"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Keeler feels that the episode is about people who hate change and how they will try to keep things the way they are, even if the change has little to do with them. The new Skinner was made to be a nice guy, but just not quite Skinner and which is why people were against him.<ref name="Keeler"/> In the original draft, there were two sentences that Keeler felt illustrated this point even better and would have made all of the difference in the episode. However, they were cut for time.<ref name="Keeler"/> The writers wanted the episode's ending to fully reset to the point before Skinner is revealed as an impostor so that the audience need not consider the Tamzarian back story part of Skinner's character.<ref name="Oakley"/>

=== Reaction from the production staff ===
[[Image:Harryshearer.jpg|right|thumb|Voice actor [[Harry Shearer]] opposed "The Principal and the Pauper".]]
Although the episode initially received little opposition from the show's production staff,<ref name="Oakley"/> it has since been both defended and criticized by several. In the DVD commentary for the episode, it is described as "a good episode" by [[Bill Oakley]]<ref name="Oakley"/> and is also defended by [[Josh Weinstein]]<ref name="Weinstein"/> and director [[Steven Dean Moore]], who said it is his favorite episode that he directed.<ref name="Moore"/> Ken Keeler himself said, "I am very proud of the job I did on this episode. This is the best episode of television I feel I ever wrote."<ref name="Keeler"/>

Others have criticized it, including [[Harry Shearer]], the voice of Principal Skinner.<ref name="Turner"/> In a [[2001 in television|2001]] interview with the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'', Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, "That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience."<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/2001-04-27/culture/shearer-delight/2|title=Shearer Delight|author=Wilonsky, Robert|accessdate=2007-10-24|date=[[2001-04-27]]|publisher=East Bay Express}}</ref> In the Season 9 DVD boxset introduction from Matt Groening, he describes "The Principal and the Pauper" as one of his least favorite episodes, although he does not elaborate.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening Matt|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD extra "A Riff From Matt Groening"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, have defended the episode, calling it "one of the series' all-time best episodes, mainly because it shows us a human side, not just of Principal Skinner, but of his hectorish Mom as well. {{interp|...}} Martin Sheen steals the show though in a brief but important slice of Simpsons history."<ref name="bbc"/>  

===Legacy===
A clip from the episode was used in [[The Simpsons (season 11)|season eleven]]'s "[[Behind the Laughter]]" as an example of the show's increasingly "gimmicky and nonsensical plots".<ref>{{cite book |last=McCann |first=Jesse L.|coauthors=Matt Groening|title=The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favourite Family ...Still Continued|year=2002 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers |isbn=0-06-050592-3 |pages=p. 54 }}</ref> This episode was also referenced by [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] in the [[The Simpsons (season 15)|season fifteen]] episode "[[I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot]]", when she tells Skinner "I guess it is, Principal ''Tamzarian''," after he complains about Lisa naming her new cat Snowball II, who had died earlier in the episode.<ref>{{cite episode |title=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot|episodelink=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Greaney, Dan; Grazier, Allen; MacMullan, Lauren |network=Fox |airdate=2004-01-11 |season=15 |number=09}}</ref>
