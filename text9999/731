'''Bacteria''' (singular: '''bacterium''') are unicellular [[microorganism]]s. They are typically a few [[micrometre]]s long and have many different shapes including spheres, rods and spirals. The study of bacteria is [[bacteriology]], a branch of [[microbiology]].

Bacteria are ubiquitous, living in every possible [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] on the planet including soil, underwater, deep in the earth's crust and even such environments as acidic [[hot springs]] and [[nuclear waste|radioactive waste]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fredrickson J, Zachara J, Balkwill D, et al | title = Geomicrobiology of high-level nuclear waste-contaminated vadose sediments at the hanford site, washington state | url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/full/70/7/4230?view=long&pmid=15240306 | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 70 | issue = 7 | pages = 4230 <U+2013> 41 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15240306}}</ref> There are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water; in all, there are around five [[nonillion]] (5 &times; 10<sup>30</sup>) bacteria in the world.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Whitman W, Coleman D, Wiebe W | title = Prokaryotes: the unseen majority | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/12/6578 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 6578 <U+2013> 83 | year = 1998 | id = PMID 9618454}}</ref> Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients and many important steps in [[nutrient cycle]]s depend on bacteria, such as the [[nitrogen fixation|fixation of nitrogen]] from the atmosphere.

The most common bacterial disease is [[tuberculosis]], which kills about 2 million people a year, mostly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. In [[developed countries]], [[antibiotics]] are used to treat bacterial infections and as a result [[antibiotic resistance]] is becoming increasingly common. In industry, bacteria are important in processes such as [[wastewater treatment]], the production of [[cheese]] and [[yoghurt]], and the industrial production of antibiotics and other chemicals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ishige T, Honda K, Shimizu S | title = Whole organism biocatalysis | journal = Curr Opin Chem Biol | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 174 <U+2013> 80 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15811802}}</ref>

Bacteria are [[prokaryote]]s and, unlike animals and other [[eukaryotes]], bacterial [[cell (biology)|cells]] do not contain a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] or other [[cell membrane|membrane-bound]] [[organelle]]s. Although the term ''bacteria'' has traditionally been generally applied to all [[prokaryote]]s, the scientific nomenclature changed after the discovery <!--in the ?1990s-->that prokaryotic life consists of two very different groups of organisms that [[evolution|evolved]] independently from an ancient common ancestor. These [[domain (biology)|evolutionary domains]] are called Bacteria and [[Archaea]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya| url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576 <U+2013> 9 | year = 1990 | id = PMID 2112744}}</ref>

== History of bacteriology==
[[image:Anton van Leeuwenhoek.png|thumb|240px|right|[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], the first person to observe bacteria using a [[microscope]]]]
{{further|[[Microbiology]]}}
The first bacteria were observed by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1674 using a single-lens [[microscope]] of his own design. His observations were published in a long series of letters to the [[Royal Society]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Leeuwenhoek A | title = Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, concerning the Worms in Sheeps Livers, Gnats, and Animalcula in the Excrements of Frogs | url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=4j53731651310230 | journal = Philosophical Transactions (1683<U+2013>1775) | volume = 22 | pages = 509<U+2013>18 | year = 1753}} Accessed 30 Nov. 2006</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Leeuwenhoek A | title = Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, F.

[[Louis Pasteur]] demonstrated in 1859 that the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] process is caused by the growth of [[microorganism]]s, and that this growth is not due to [[spontaneous generation]].  (As an aside, [[yeast]]s and [[mold]]s &mdash; which are commonly associated with [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] &mdash; are not bacteria, but rather [[fungi]])  Along with his contemporary, [[Robert Koch]], Pasteur was an early advocate of the [[germ theory of disease]].<ref>[http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cphl/history/articles/pasteur.htm#paperII Pasteur's Papers on the Germ Theory] LSU Law Center's Medical and Public Health Law Site, Historic Public Health Articles.

Although it was known in the 19th century that bacteria are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available. In 1910, [[Paul Ehrlich]] developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained ''[[Treponema pallidum]]''<U+2014>the [[spirochete]] that causes [[syphilis]]<U+2014>into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz R | title = Paul Ehrlich's magic bullets | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 350 | issue = 11 | pages = 1079<U+2013>80 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15014180}}</ref> Ehrlich was also awarded a Nobel prize for his work on [[immunology]], and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the [[Gram stain]] and the [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain|Ziehl <U+2013> Neelsen stain]].<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/ehrlich-bio.html Biography of Paul Ehrlich] Nobelprize.org Accessed November 26, 2006.</ref>

A major step forward in the study of bacteria was the recognition in 1977 by [[Carl Woese]] that [[archaea]] are a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Woese C, Fox G | title = Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: the primary kingdoms | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 5088<U+2013>90 | year = 1977 | id = PMID 270744}}</ref> This new [[phylogenetic]] [[taxonomy]] was based on the sequencing of [[Svedberg|16S]] [[ribosome|ribosomal]] [[RNA]] and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the [[three-domain system]].<ref name=Woese>{{cite journal | author = Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576<U+2013>79 | year = 1990 | id = PMID 2112744}}</ref>

==Origin and early evolution==
{{further|[[Timeline of evolution]]}}

The ancestors of modern bacteria were single-celled microorganisms that were the [[Origin of life|first forms of life]] to develop on earth, about [[1 E17 s|4 billion years ago]]. For about 3 billion years, all organisms were microscopic and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schopf J | title = Disparate rates, differing fates: tempo and mode of evolution changed from the Precambrian to the Phanerozoic | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=44277&blobtype=pdf | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 91 | issue = 15 | pages = 6735<U+2013>42 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 8041691}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = DeLong E, Pace N | title = Environmental diversity of bacteria and archaea | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 470<U+2013>78 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 12116647}}</ref> Although bacterial fossils exist, such as [[stromatolite]]s, their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the past history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage. The [[last universal ancestor]] of bacteria and archaea was probably a [[thermophile|hyperthermophile]] that lived about 2.5<U+2013>3.2 billion years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Di Giulio M | title = The universal ancestor and the ancestor of bacteria were hyperthermophiles | journal = J Mol Evol | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 721<U+2013>30 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 14745541}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Battistuzzi F, Feijao A, Hedges S | title = A genomic timescale of prokaryote evolution: insights into the origin of methanogenesis, phototrophy, and the colonization of land. | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=15535883 | journal = BMC Evol Biol | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 44 | year = | id = PMID 15535883}}</ref>

Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. The eukaryotes arose when ancient bacteria entered into [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells. This involved the engulfment of alpha-proteobacteria to form [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and cyanobacterial-like organisms to form [[chloroplast]]s.<ref name=Dyall>{{cite journal | author = Dyall S, Brown M, Johnson P | title = Ancient invasions: from endosymbionts to organelles | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5668 | pages = 253 <U+2013> 7 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15073369}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = McFadden G | title = Endosymbiosis and evolution of the plant cell | journal = Curr Opin Plant Biol | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 513-9 | year = 1999 | id = PMID 10607659}}</ref>

==Morphology==
[[Image:Bacterial morphology diagram.svg|right|thumb|350px|Bacteria display a large diversity of cell [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] and arrangements]]

Bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes, called ''[[morphology (biology)|morphologies]]''. Bacterial cells are about 10 times smaller than eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5<U+2013>5.0&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s in length. However, a few species<U+2013>for example ''[[Thiomargarita namibiensis]]'' and ''[[Epulopiscium fishelsoni]]''<U+2013>are up to half a [[millimetre]] long and visible to the unaided eye.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schulz H, Jorgensen B | title = Big bacteria | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 105 <U+2013> 37 | year = | id = PMID 11544351}}</ref> Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', which measure only 0.3&nbsp;micrometres, as small as the largest [[virus|viruses]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Robertson J, Gomersall M, Gill P. | title = Mycoplasma hominis: growth, reproduction, and isolation of small viable cells | journal = J Bacteriol. | volume = 124 | issue = 2 | pages = 1007 <U+2013> 18 | year = 1975 | id = PMID 1102522}}</ref>

Most bacterial species are either spherical, called [[coccus]] (''pl''. cocci, from Greek ''k<U+00F3>kkos'', grain, seed) or rod-shaped, called bacillus (''pl''. bacilli, from Latin ''baculus'', stick). Some rod-shaped bacteria, called vibrio, are slightly curved or comma-shaped; others, called spirilla, form twisted spirals. A small number of species are even known with tetrahedal or cuboidal shapes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fritz I, Str<U+00F6>mpl C, Abraham W | title = Phylogenetic relationships of the genera Stella, Labrys and Angulomicrobium within the 'Alphaproteobacteria' and description of Angulomicrobium amanitiforme sp. nov | url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/54/3/651 | journal = Int J Syst Evol Microbiol | volume = 54 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 651-7 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15143003}}</ref> This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial [[cell wall]] and [[cytoskeleton]] and are important because they can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape [[predation|predators]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cabeen M, Jacobs-Wagner C | title = Bacterial cell shape | journal = Nat Rev Microbiol | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | pages = 601 <U+2013> 10 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16012516}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Young K | title = The selective value of bacterial shape | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 660 <U+2013> 703 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16959965}}</ref>

Many bacterial species exist simply as single cells; others associate in characteristic patterns: ''[[Neisseria]]'' form diploids (pairs), ''[[Streptococcus]]'' form chains, and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' group together in "bunch of grapes" clusters. Bacteria can also be elongated to form filaments, for example the [[Actinobacteria]]. Filamentous bacteria are often surrounded by a sheath that contains many individual cells; certain species, such as the genus ''[[Nocardia]]'', form complex, branched filaments, similar in appearance to fungal [[mycelia]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Douwes K, Schmalzbauer E, Linde H, Reisberger E, Fleischer K, Lehn N, Landthaler M, Vogt T | title = Branched filaments no fungus, ovoid bodies no bacteria: Two unusual cases of mycetoma | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 49 | issue = 2 Suppl Case Reports | pages = S170 <U+2013> 3 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12894113}}</ref>

[[Image:Relative scale.svg|thumb|300px|left|The range of sizes shown by [[prokaryote]]s, relative to those of other organisms and [[biomolecule]]s]]

Bacteria often attach to surfaces and form dense aggregations called [[biofilms]] or microbial mats. These films can range from a few micrometers in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain  multiple species of bacteria, [[protists]] and [[archaea]]. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Donlan R | title = Biofilms: microbial life on surfaces | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 881<U+2013>90 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12194761}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Branda S, Vik S, Friedman L, Kolter R | title = Biofilms: the matrix revisited | journal = Trends Microbiol | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 20<U+2013>26 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15639628}}</ref> In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms.<ref name=Davey>{{cite journal | author = Davey M, O'toole G | title = Microbial biofilms: from ecology to molecular genetics | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 847<U+2013>67 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 11104821}}</ref> Biofilms are also important for chronic bacterial infections and infections of implanted medical devices, as bacteria protected within these structures are much harder to kill than individual bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Donlan RM, Costerton JW | title = Biofilms: survival mechanisms of clinically relevant microorganisms | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 167<U+2013>93 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 11932229}}</ref>

Even more complex morphological changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, [[Myxobacteria]] detect surrounding cells in a process known as [[quorum sensing]], migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500&nbsp;micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Shimkets L | title = Intercellular signaling during fruiting-body development of Myxococcus xanthus. | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 525<U+2013>49 | year = | id = PMID 10547700}}</ref> In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisation. For example, about one in 10 cells migrate to the top of these fruiting bodies and [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into a specialised dormant state called myxospores, which are more resistant to desiccation and other adverse environmental conditions than are ordinary cells.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kaiser D | title = Signaling in myxobacteria | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 75<U+2013>98 | year = | id = PMID 15487930}}</ref>

==Cellular structure ==
[[Image:Prokaryote cell diagram.svg|thumb|320px|right|Diagram of the cellular structure of a typical bacterial cell]]
{{further|[[Bacterial cell structure]]}}
===Intracellular structures===
The bacterial cell is surrounded by a [[lipid]] membrane, or [[cell membrane]], which encompasses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, proteins and other essential components of the [[cytoplasm]] within the cell. As they are [[prokaryotes]], bacteria do not have membrane-bound [[organelles]] in their cytoplasm and thus contain few intracellular structures. They consequently lack a [[nucleus]], [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplast]]s and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells, such as the [[Golgi apparatus]] and [[endoplasmic reticulum]].<ref>Berg J., Tymoczko J. and Stryer L. (2002) ''Biochemistry.'' W. H. Freeman and Company ISBN 0-7167-4955-6</ref>

Many important biochemical reactions, such as energy generation, occur due to [[diffusion|concentration gradient]]s across membranes, creating a potential difference analogous to a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The absence of internal membranes in bacteria means these reactions, such as [[electron transport chain|electron transport]], occur across the cell membrane, between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harold F | title = Conservation and transformation of energy by bacterial membranes | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=4261111 | journal = Bacteriol Rev | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 172<U+2013>230 | year = 1972 | id = PMID 4261111}}</ref>

Bacteria do not have a membrane-bound [[nucleus]] and their genetic material is typically a single circular chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the [[nucleoid]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thanbichler M, Wang S, Shapiro L | title = The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal = J Cell Biochem | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 506<U+2013>21 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15988757}}</ref> The nucleoid contains the chromosome with associated proteins and [[RNA]]. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain [[ribosomes]] for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from those of [[eukaryote]]s and [[Archaea]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Poehlsgaard J, Douthwaite S | title = The bacterial ribosome as a target for antibiotics | journal = Nat Rev Microbiol | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 870<U+2013>81 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16261170}}</ref> The order [[Planctomycetes]] are an exception to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they have a membrane around their nucleoid and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fuerst J | title = Intracellular compartmentation in planctomycetes | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 59 | pages = 299<U+2013>328 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15910279}}</ref>

===Extracellular structures===
{{further|[[Cell envelope]]}}

Around the outside of the cell membrane is the bacterial [[cell wall]]. Bacterial cell walls are made of [[peptidoglycan]] (called murein in older sources), which is made from [[polysaccharide]] chains cross-linked by unusual [[peptide]]s containing D-[[amino acid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = van Heijenoort J | title = Formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan | url=http://glycob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/11/3/25R | journal = Glycobiology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 25R <U+2013> 36R | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11320055}}</ref> Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of [[plants]] and [[fungi]] which are made of [[cellulose]] and [[chitin]], respectively.<ref name=Koch>{{cite journal | author = Koch A | title = Bacterial wall as target for attack: past, present, and future research | url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/16/4/673?view=long&pmid=14557293 | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 673 <U+2013> 87 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 14557293}}</ref> The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria and the antibiotic [[penicillin]] is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.<ref name=Koch/>

There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria, called [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]]. The names originate from the reaction of cells to the [[Gram stain]], a test long-employed for the classification of bacterial species.<ref name=Gram>{{cite journal | last = Gram | first =  HC | authorlink = Hans Christian Gram | year = 1884 | title = <U+00DC>ber die isolierte F<U+00E4>rbung der Schizomyceten in Schnitt- und Trockenpr<U+00E4>paraten | journal = Fortschr.

Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and [[teichoic acids]]. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by an second lipid membrane containing [[lipopolysaccharide]]s and [[lipoprotein]]s. Most bacteria have the Gram-negative cell wall and only the [[Firmicutes]] and [[Actinobacteria]] (previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively) have the alternative Gram-positive arrangement.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hugenholtz P | title = Exploring prokaryotic diversity in the genomic era | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11864374 | journal = Genome Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = REVIEWS0003 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 11864374}}</ref> These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility, for instance [[vancomycin]] can kill only Gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against Gram-negative pathogens, such as ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Walsh F, Amyes S | title = Microbiology and drug resistance mechanisms of fully resistant pathogens. | journal = Curr Opin Microbiol | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 439-44 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15451497}}</ref>

[[Image:Listeria.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' electron micrograph, showing flagella on the cell surface.]]

[[Flagella]] are rigid protein structures, about 20&nbsp;[[metre|nanometre]]s in diameter and up to 20&nbsp;micrometres in length, that are used for motility. Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of ions down an [[electrochemical gradient]] across the cell membrane.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Blair D | title = The bacterial flagellar motor: structure and function of a complex molecular machine | journal = Int Rev Cytol | volume = 233 | issue = | pages = 93 <U+2013> 134 | year = | id = PMID 15037363}}</ref>

[[Fimbriae]] are fine filaments of protein, just 2<U+2013>10&nbsp;nanometres in diameter and up to several micrometers in length.

Capsules or slime layers are produced by many bacteria to surround their cells and vary in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extra-cellular [[polymer]], to a highly structured [[Capsule (microbiology)|capsule]] or [[glycocalyx]].

The assembly of these extracellular structures is dependent on bacterial [[secretion|secretion systems]].

== Metabolism ==
[[Image:Bluegreen algae.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fillaments of [[photosynthetic]] [[cyanobacteria]]]]
{{further|[[Microbial metabolism]]}}

In contrast to higher organisms, bacteria exhibit an extremely wide variety of [[metabolism|metabolic]] types.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nealson K | title = Post-Viking microbiology: new approaches, new data, new insights | journal = Orig Life Evol Biosph | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 73-93 | year = 1999 | id = PMID 11536899}}</ref> The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their [[taxonomy]], but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Xu J | title = Microbial ecology in the age of genomics and metagenomics: concepts, tools, and recent advances | journal = Mol Ecol | volume = 15 | issue = 7 | pages = 1713-31 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16689892}}</ref> Bacterial metabolism can be divided broadly on the basis of the kind of energy used for growth, [[electron donor]]s and [[electron acceptor]]s and by the source of carbon used.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zillig W | title = Comparative biochemistry of Archaea and Bacteria | journal = Curr Opin Genet Dev | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 544-51 | year = 1991 | id = PMID 1822288}}</ref>

Carbon metabolism in bacteria is usually [[heterotroph]]ic, where [[organic compound|organic carbon]] compounds are used as both carbon and energy sources. As an alternative to heterotrophy some bacteria such as [[cyanobacteria]] and [[purple bacteria]] are [[autotrophic]], meaning that they obtain cellular carbon by fixing [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hellingwerf K, Crielaard W, Hoff W, Matthijs H, Mur L, van Rotterdam B | title = Photobiology of bacteria | journal = Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 331 <U+2013> 47 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 7832590}}</ref>

Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on [[phototroph]]y, the use of light through [[photosynthesis]], or on [[chemotroph]]y, the use of chemical substances for energy. Chemotrophs are divided into [[lithotroph]]s that use inorganic electron donors for respiration and [[organotroph]]s that use organic compounds as electron donors. To use chemical compounds as a source of energy, electrons are taken from the [[redox|reduced]] substrate and transferred to a [[terminal electron acceptor]] in a [[redox|redox reaction]]. This reaction releases energy that can be used to drive metabolism. In [[aerobe|aerobic]] organisms, [[oxygen]] is used as the electron acceptor. In [[anaerobe|anaerobic]] organisms other inorganic compounds, such as [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]] or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically-important processes of [[denitrification]], sulfate reduction and [[acetogenesis]], respectively.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zumft W | title = Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification | url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/4/533?view=long&pmid=9409151 | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 533 <U+2013> 616 | year = 1997 | id = PMID 9409151}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Drake H, Daniel S, K<U+00FC>sel K, Matthies C, Kuhner C, Braus-Stromeyer S | title = Acetogenic bacteria: what are the in situ consequences of their diverse metabolic versatilities? | journal = Biofactors | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 13 <U+2013> 24 | year = 1997 | id = PMID 9233536}}</ref> These processes are also important in biological responses to [[pollution]], for example [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] ([[methylmercury|methyl-]] and [[dimethylmercury]]) in the environment.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Morel | first = FMM | coauthors = Kraepiel AML, Amyot M | year = 1998 | title = The chemical cycle and bioaccumulation of mercury | journal = Annual Review of Ecological Systems | volume = 29 | pages = 543&mdash;566}}</ref>  Non-respiratory anaerobes use [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as [[ethanol]] in brewing) as waste. [[Facultative anaerobe]]s can switch between fermentation and different [[terminal electron acceptor]]s depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

[[Lithotroph]]ic bacteria can use inorganic compounds as a source of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[ammonia]] (leading to [[nitrification]]), [[ferrous iron]] and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced [[sulfur]] compounds. Unusually, the gas [[methane]] can be used by [[methanotroph|methanotrophic]] bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dalton H | title = The Leeuwenhoek Lecture 2000 the natural and unnatural history of methane-oxidizing bacteria | url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/16ut607drn2jywbbgxuq/contributions/y/l/6/u/yl6umjthf30e4a59.pdf | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 360 | issue = 1458 | pages = 1207 <U+2013> 22 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16147517}}</ref> In both [[aerobe|aerobic]] [[phototroph]]y and [[chemolithotroph]]y oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, while under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most [[lithotroph]]ic organisms are autotrophic, whereas [[organotroph]]ic organisms are heterotrophic.

In addition to fixing carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, some bacteria also fix [[nitrogen]] gas ([[nitrogen fixation]]) using the enzyme [[nitrogenase]]. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of nearly all the metabolic types listed above, but is not universal.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zehr J, Jenkins B, Short S, Steward G | title = Nitrogenase gene diversity and microbial community structure: a cross-system comparison | journal = Environ Microbiol | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 539 <U+2013> 54 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12823187}}</ref>

== Growth and reproduction ==
{{further|[[Bacterial growth]]}}
Unlike multicellular organisms, in unicellular organisms increases in the size of bacteria ([[cell growth]]) and their reproduction by [[cell division]] are tightly linked. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through [[binary fission]], a form of [[asexual reproduction]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Koch A | title = Control of the bacterial cell cycle by cytoplasmic growth | journal = Crit Rev Microbiol | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 61 <U+2013> 77 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12003041}}</ref> Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eagon R | title = Pseudomonas natriegens, a marine bacterium with a generation time of less than 10 minutes | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=13888946 | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 736 <U+2013> 7 | year = | id = PMID 13888946}}</ref> In cell division, two identical [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that facilitate the dispersal of the newly-formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by ''[[Myxobacteria]]'' and arial [[Hypha|hyphae]] formation by ''[[Streptomyces]]'', or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.

[[Image:Agar_plate_with_colonies.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Solid [[agar plate]] with bacterial colonies]]

In the laboratory, bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media such as [[agar plates]] are used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.<ref name=Thomson>{{cite journal | author = Thomson R, Bertram H | title = Laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system infections | journal = Infect Dis Clin North Am | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 1047 <U+2013> 71 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11780267}}</ref>

Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see [[r/K selection theory]]). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Paerl H, Fulton R, Moisander P, Dyble J | title = Harmful freshwater algal blooms, with an emphasis on cyanobacteria | journal = ScientificWorldJournal | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 76 <U+2013> 113 | year = | id = PMID 12805693}}</ref> Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple [[antibiotics]] by ''[[Streptomyces]]'' that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Challis G, Hopwood D | title = Synergy and contingency as driving forces for the evolution of multiple secondary metabolite production by Streptomyces species | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/suppl_2/14555 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 100 Suppl 2 | issue = | pages = 14555 <U+2013> 61 | year = | id = PMID 12970466}}</ref> In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g. [[biofilm]]s) which may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses.<ref name=Davey/> These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms ([[syntrophy]]).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kooijman S, Auger P, Poggiale J, Kooi B | title = Quantitative steps in symbiogenesis and the evolution of homeostasis | journal = Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 435 <U+2013> 63 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 14558592}}</ref>

[[Bacterial growth]] follows three phases. When a population of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the [[lag time|lag phase]], a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as [[enzyme]]s and [[active transport|nutrient transport]]ers are produced.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Prats C, L<U+00F3>pez D, Gir<U+00F3> A, Ferrer J, Valls J | title = Individual-based modelling of bacterial cultures to study the microscopic causes of the lag phase | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 241 | issue = 4 | pages = 939 <U+2013> 53 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16524598}}</ref> The second phase of growth is the [[logarithmic|logarithmic phase]] (log phase), also known as the exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the ''growth rate'' (''k'') and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the ''generation time'' (''g''). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The final phase of growth is the [[stationary phase]] and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant|antioxidant metabolism]] and [[active transport|nutrient transport]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hecker M, V<U+00F6>lker U | title = General stress response of Bacillus subtilis and other bacteria | journal = Adv Microb Physiol | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 35 <U+2013> 91 | year = | id = PMID 11407115}}</ref>

Bacteria, as asexual organisms, inherit identical copies of their parent's genes (i.e., they are [[Clone (genetics)|clonal]]). However, all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material [[DNA]] caused by [[genetic recombination]] or [[mutation]]s. [[Mutation]]s come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to [[mutagen]]s. Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Denamur E, Matic I | title = Evolution of mutation rates in bacteria | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 820 <U+2013> 7 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16677295}}</ref> Genetic changes in bacterial genomes come from either [[mutation|random mutation]] during replication or "stress-directed mutation", where genes involved in a particular growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wright B | title = Stress-directed adaptive mutations and evolution | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 643 <U+2013> 50 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15101972}}</ref>

Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells. This can occur in three main ways. Firstly, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Often, the genes transferred are not from within the main bacterial chromosome, but are carried on a small circular piece of DNA called a [[plasmid]]. Genes can also be transferred by the process of [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome. The third method of gene transfer is [[bacterial conjugation]], where DNA is transferred through direct cell contact. This gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called [[horizontal gene transfer]] and may be common under natural conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Davison J | title = Genetic exchange between bacteria in the environment | journal = Plasmid | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 73 <U+2013> 91 | year = 1999 | id = PMID 10489325}}</ref> Gene transfer is particularly important in [[antibiotic resistance]] as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different [[pathogen]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hastings P, Rosenberg S, Slack A | title = Antibiotic-induced lateral transfer of antibiotic resistance | journal = Trends Microbiol | volume = 12 | issue = 9 | pages = 401 <U+2013> 4 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15337159}}</ref>

Motile bacteria can move using [[flagellum|flagella]], [[bacterial gliding]], twitching motility or changes of buoyancy.<ref name=Bardy>{{cite journal | author = Bardy S, Ng S, Jarrell K | title = Prokaryotic motility structures | url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/149/2/295?view=long&pmid=12624192 | journal = Microbiology | volume = 149 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 295 <U+2013> 304 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12624192}}</ref> A unique group of bacteria, the [[spirochaete]]s, have structures similar to flagella, called [[axial filament]]s that are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive [[helix|helical]] body that twists about as it moves.<ref name=Bardy/>  In twitching motility, bacterial use their type IV [[pilus|pili]] as a grappling hook, repeatedly extending it, anchoring it and then retracting it with remarkable force (>80 p[[Newton|N]]).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Merz A, So M, Sheetz M | title = Pilus retraction powers bacterial twitching motility | journal = Nature | volume = 407 | issue = 6800 | pages = 98-102 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10993081}}</ref>

Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum ([[monotrichous]]), a flagellum at each end ([[amphitrichous]]), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell ([[lophotrichous]]), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell ([[peritrichous]]). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly.<ref name=Bardy/> The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a motor at the base that uses the [[proton-motive force]] for power. This motor drives the motion of the filament, which acts as a propeller. Many bacteria (such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'') have two distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling allows them to reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional [[random walk]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wu M, Roberts J, Kim S, Koch D, DeLisa M | title = Collective bacterial dynamics revealed using a three-dimensional population-scale defocused particle tracking technique | url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/full/72/7/4987?view=long&pmid=16820497 | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 72 | issue = 7 | pages = 4987 <U+2013> 94 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16820497}}</ref> (See external links below for link to videos.)

Motile bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] in behaviors called ''taxes'': these include [[chemotaxis]], [[phototaxis]] and [[magnetotaxis]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lux R, Shi W | title = Chemotaxis-guided movements in bacteria | journal = Crit Rev Oral Biol Med | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 207-20 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15284186}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Frankel R, Bazylinski D, Johnson M, Taylor B | title = Magneto-aerotaxis in marine coccoid bacteria | journal = Biophys J | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | pages = 994 <U+2013> 1000 | year = 1997 | id = PMID 9251816}}</ref> In one peculiar group, the [[myxobacteria]], individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kaiser D | title = Signaling in myxobacteria | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 75-98 | year = | id = PMID 15487930}}</ref> The [[myxobacteria]] move only when on solid surfaces, unlike ''E. coli'' which is [[motile]] in liquid or solid media.

Several ''[[Listeria]]'' and ''[[Shigella]]'' species move inside host cells by usurping the [[cytoskeleton]], which is normally used to move [[organelle]]s inside the cell. By promoting [[actin]] [[biopolymer|polymerization]] at one pole of their cells, they can form a kind of tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goldberg MB | title = Actin-based motility of intracellular microbial pathogens | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 595 - 626 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11729265 }}</ref>

== Classification and identification ==
{{further|[[Taxonomy]], [[Clinical pathology]]}}

[[Scientific Classification|Classification]] seeks to describe the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified on the basis of cell structure, cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components such as [[DNA]], [[fatty acid]]s, pigments, [[antigen]]s and [[quinone]]s.<ref name=Thomson/> While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was due to the lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as [[lateral gene transfer]] between unrelated species<ref>{{cite journal | author = Boucher Y, Douady CJ, Papke RT, Walsh DA, Boudreau ME, Nesbo CL, Case RJ, Doolittle WF | title = Lateral gene transfer and the origins of prokaryotic groups. | http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.genet.37.050503.084247 | journal = Annu Rev Genet | volume = 37 | pages = 283 - 328 | year = 2003| id = PMID 14616063}}</ref>. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely-related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasizes [[molecular systematics]], using genetic techniques such as [[guanine]] [[cytosine]] [[GC-content|ratio]] determination, genome-genome hybridization, as well as [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the [[rDNA|rRNA gene]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Olsen G, Woese C, Overbeek R | title = The winds of (evolutionary) change: breathing new life into microbiology | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=205007&blobtype=pdf | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 176 | issue = 1 | pages = 1 <U+2013> 6 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 8282683}}</ref>

The term "bacteria" was traditionally applied to all microscopic, single-celled prokaryotes.  However, molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate [[domain (biology)|domain]]s, originally called '''Eubacteria''' and '''Archaebacteria''', but now called '''Bacteria''' and '''[[Archaea]]'''<ref>{{cite journal | author = Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576 <U+2013> 9 | year = 1990 | id = PMID 2112744}}</ref> that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor. These two domains, along with Eukarya, are the basis of the [[three domain system]], which is nowadays the most widely-used classification system in bacteriology.<ref name=Gupta>{{cite journal | author = Gupta R | title = The natural evolutionary relationships among prokaryotes. | journal = Crit Rev Microbiol | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 111-31 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10890353}}</ref> However, due to the relatively recent introduction of molecular systematics and the analysis of genome sequences, bacterial classification remains a changing and expanding field.<ref name=Rappe/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Doolittle RF | title = Evolutionary aspects of whole-genome biology | journal = Curr Opin Struct Biol | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 248 - 253 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 11837318}}</ref> For example, a few biologists argue that Archaea evolved from Gram-positive bacteria.<ref name=Cavalier-Smith2002>{{cite journal | author = Cavalier-Smith T | title = The neomuran origin of archaebacteria, the negibacterial root of the universal tree and bacterial megaclassification. | journal = Int J Syst Evol Microbiol | volume = 52 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 7-76 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 11837318}}</ref>

[[Image:Streptococcus mutans Gram.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Streptococcus mutans'' visualized with a Gram stain.]]
[[Image:Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ziehl-Neelsen stain 02.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' visualized with a Ziehl-Neelsen stain.]]

Identification of bacteria in the laboratory is particularly relevant in medicine, where the correct treatment is determined by the bacterial species causing an infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria. 

The [[Gram stain]], developed in 1884 by [[Hans Christian Gram]], characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls.<ref name=Gram/> The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the "Gram-positive" cell wall stain purple, while the thin "Gram-negative" cell wall appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (Gram-positive cocci, Gram-positive bacilli, Gram-negative cocci and Gram-negative bacilli). Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain, particularly mycobacteria or ''Nocardia'', which show [[acid-fast]]ness on [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain|Ziehl<U+2013>Neelsen]] or similar stains.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Woods G, Walker D | title = Detection of infection or infectious agents by use of cytologic and histologic stains | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=172900&blobtype=pdf | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 382 <U+2013> 404 | year = 1996 | id = PMID 8809467}}</ref> Other organisms may need to be identified by their growth in special media, or by other techniques, such as [[serology]].

Culture techniques are designed to promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting the growth of the other bacteria in the sample. Often these techniques are designed for specific specimens, for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on [[selective media]] to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Weinstein M | title = Clinical importance of blood cultures | journal = Clin Lab Med | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 9 <U+2013> 16 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 8181237}}</ref><ref name=Thomson/> Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns such as ([[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] growth, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|patterns of hemolysis]]) and staining.

As with bacterial classification, identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods. Diagnostics using such DNA-based tools, such as [[polymerase chain reaction]], are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed, compared to culture-based methods.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Louie M, Louie L, Simor AE | title = The role of DNA amplification technology in the diagnosis of infectious diseases | journal = CMAJ | url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/163/3/301 | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 301 - 309 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10951731}}</ref>

==Interactions with other organisms==
Despite their apparent simplicity, bacteria can form complex associations with other organisms. These [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations can be divided into [[parasitism]], [[mutualism]] and [[commensalism]]. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of [[body odor]].

===Mutualists===
Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of [[anaerobic bacteria]] that consume organic acids and produce hydrogen, and [[methanogen|methanogenic]] Archaea that consume hydrogen.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Stams A, de Bok F, Plugge C, van Eekert M, Dolfing J, Schraa G | title = Exocellular electron transfer in anaerobic microbial communities | journal = Environ Microbiol | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 371 <U+2013> 82 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16478444}}</ref> These bacteria are unable to consume the organic acids and grow when hydrogen accumulates in their surroundings, with only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeping the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.

In soil, microorganisms which reside in the [[rhizosphere]] (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out [[nitrogen fixation]], converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Barea J, Pozo M, Azc<U+00F3>n R, Azc<U+00F3>n-Aguilar C | title = Microbial co-operation in the rhizosphere | url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/417/1761 | journal = J Exp Bot | volume = 56 | issue = 417 | pages = 1761 <U+2013> 78 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15911555}}</ref> This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as [[symbiont]]s [[Bacteria in the human body|in humans]] and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human [[gut flora]] of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise [[vitamin]]s such as [[folic acid]], [[vitamin K]] and [[biotin]], as well as fermenting complex undigestable [[carbohydrate]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = O'Hara A, Shanahan F | title = The gut flora as a forgotten organ | journal = EMBO Rep | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 688 <U+2013> 93 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16819463}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Zoetendal E, Vaughan E, de Vos W | title = A microbial world within us | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 1639 <U+2013> 50 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16553872}}</ref> Bacteria that offer some benefit to human hosts include ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' species, which convert milk protein to lactic acid in the gut.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gorbach S | title = Lactic acid bacteria and human health | journal = Ann Med | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 37 <U+2013> 41 | year = 1990 | id = PMID 2109988}}</ref> The presence of this [[gut flora]] also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through [[competitive exclusion]]) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as [[probiotic]] [[dietary supplement]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Salminen S, Gueimonde M, Isolauri E | title = Probiotics that modify disease risk | url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/135/5/1294 | journal = J Nutr | volume = 135 | issue = 5 | pages = 1294 <U+2013> 8 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15867327}}</ref>

===Pathogens===
{{further|[[Bacteria and human health]], [[Pathogen]]}}
[[Image:SalmonellaNIAID.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Color-enhanced scanning electron micrograph showing ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' (red) invading cultured human cells]]
If bacteria form a parasitic association with other organisms, they are classed as [[pathogen]]s. Pathogenic bacteria are an important cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as [[tetanus]], [[typhoid fever]], [[diphtheria]], [[syphilis]], [[cholera]], [[food-borne illness]], [[leprosy]] and [[tuberculosis]]. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, as was the case with [[Helicobacter pylori]] and [[Timeline of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori|peptic ulcer disease]].  Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing [[leaf spot]], [[fireblight]] and [[wilting|wilts]] in [[plant]]s, as well as [[Johne's disease]], [[mastitis]], [[salmonella]] and [[anthrax]] in farm animals.

Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Some organisms, such as ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' or ''[[Streptococcus]]'', can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming [[sepsis]], a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fish D | title = Optimal antimicrobial therapy for sepsis | journal = Am J Health Syst Pharm | volume = 59 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = S13 <U+2013> 9 | year = | id = PMID 11885408}}</ref> Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the [[Rickettsia]], which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes [[typhus]], while another causes [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]]. [[Chlamydia]], another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause [[pneumonia]], or [[urinary tract infection]] and may be involved in [[coronary heart disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Belland R, Ouellette S, Gieffers J, Byrne G | title = Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerosis | journal = Cell Microbiol | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 117 <U+2013> 27 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 14706098}}</ref> Finally, some species, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Burkholderia cenocepacia]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium avium complex|Mycobacterium avium]]'', are [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogens]] and cause disease mainly in people suffering from [[immunosuppression]] or [[cystic fibrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heise E | title = Diseases associated with immunosuppression | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1568899&blobtype=pdf | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 9 <U+2013> 19 | year = | id = PMID 7037390}}</ref><ref name="Saiman">{{cite journal | last = Saiman | first = L |yar = 2004 | title = Microbiology of early CF lung disease | journal = Paediatr Respir Rev. volume = 5 Suppl A | pages = S367&ndash;369}} PMID 14980298</ref>

Bacterial infections may be treated with [[antibiotic]]s, which are classified as [[bacteriocide|bacteriocidal]] if they kill bacteria, or [[bacteriostatic]] if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are [[chloramphenicol]] and [[puromycin]], which inhibit the bacterial [[ribosome]], but not the structurally-different eukaryotic ribosome.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yonath A, Bashan A | title = Ribosomal crystallography: initiation, peptide bond formation, and amino acid polymerization are hampered by antibiotics | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 58 | pages = 233 <U+2013> 51 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15487937}}</ref> Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in [[intensive farming]] to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of [[antibiotic resistance]] in bacterial populations.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Khachatourians G | title = Agricultural use of antibiotics and the evolution and transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=9835883 | journal = CMAJ | volume = 159 | issue = 9 | pages = 1129-36 | year = 1998 | id = PMID 9835883}}</ref> Infections can be prevented by [[antiseptic]] measures such as sterilizating the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] to prevent contamination and infection by bacteria. [[Disinfectants]] such as [[bleach]] are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.

==Significance in technology and industry==
{{Further|[[Economic importance of bacteria]]}}
Bacteria, often ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' in combination with [[yeast]]s and [[mold]]s, have been used for thousands of years in the preparation of [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] foods such as [[cheese]], [[pickle]]s, [[soy sauce]], [[sauerkraut]], [[vinegar]], [[wine]] and [[yogurt]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Johnson M, Lucey J | title = Major technological advances and trends in cheese | journal = J Dairy Sci | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 1174<U+2013>8 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16537950}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Hagedorn S, Kaphammer B | title = Microbial biocatalysis in the generation of flavor and fragrance chemicals | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 773<U+2013>800 | year = | id = PMID 7826026}}</ref>

The ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and [[bioremediation]]. Bacteria capable of digesting the [[hydrocarbons]] in [[petroleum]] are often used to clean up [[oil spill]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cohen Y | title = Bioremediation of oil by marine microbial mats | journal = Int Microbiol | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 189 <U+2013> 93 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12497184}}</ref> Fertilizer was added to some of the beaches in [[Prince William Sound]] in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the infamous 1989 [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]]. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the [[bioremediation]] of industrial [[toxic waste]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Neves L, Miyamura T, Moraes D, Penna T, Converti A | title = Biofiltration methods for the removal of phenolic residues | journal = Appl Biochem Biotechnol | volume = 129 <U+2013> 132 | issue = | pages = 130<U+2013>52 | year = | id = PMID 16915636}}</ref> In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of [[enantiomer|enantiomerically]] pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Liese A, Filho M | title = Production of fine chemicals using biocatalysis | journal = Curr Opin Biotechnol | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 595 <U+2013> 603 | year = 1999 | id = PMID 10600695}}</ref>

Bacteria can also be used in the place of [[pesticide]]s in the [[biological pest control]]. This commonly involves ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (also called BT), a Gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a [[Lepidoptera]]n-specific [[insecticide]]s under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Aronson A, Shai Y | title = Why Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal toxins are so effective: unique features of their mode of action | journal = FEMS Microbiol Lett | volume = 195 | issue = 1 | pages = 1<U+2013>8 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11166987}}</ref> Because of their specificity, these [[pesticide]]s are regarded as [[environmentally friendly]], with little or no effect on [[human]]s, [[wildlife]], [[pollinator]]s and most other [[beneficial insect]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bozsik A | title = Susceptibility of adult Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) to insecticides with different modes of action | journal = Pest Manag Sci | volume = 62 | issue = 7 | pages = 651<U+2013>4 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16649191}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Chattopadhyay A, Bhatnagar N, Bhatnagar R | title = Bacterial insecticidal toxins | journal = Crit Rev Microbiol | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 33<U+2013>54 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15116762}}</ref>

Because of their ability to quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]]. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, [[enzyme]]s and [[metabolic pathways]] in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Serres M, Gopal S, Nahum L, Liang P, Gaasterland T, Riley M | title = A functional update of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11574054 | journal = Genome Biol | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = RESEARCH0035 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11574054}}</ref> This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme kinetic]] and [[gene expression]] data into mathematical models of entire organisms.
