'''Lake Awoonga''' is a dam located 30km (19 miles) from [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]], in [[Central Queensland]], [[Australia]]. It is approximately 30 minutes drive from Gladstone, via [[Benaraby, Queensland|Benaraby]].

[http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/faqs.html "Awoonga Dam"] as it is also known, is the main water supply for the Gladstone region. Its beautiful recreation areas are provided for locals and tourists by the [http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au Gladstone Area Water Board].<ref> http://www.calliope.qld.gov.au/Visitors/docs/attractions.html Attractions in Calliope Shire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Specifications==
Built across the [[Boyne River]] south west of Gladstone, the Awoonga Dam is a rockfill structure with a concrete upstream face slab. The embankment was formed from rock excavated from a quarry on the eastern side of the dam wall. The embankment is over 650 metres in length and 54.4 metres in height, with a volume of approximately 2 million cubic metres of rock. The spillway<U+2019>s height is 40 metres AHD. This design of the current dam allows for further raising, if necessary, through the addition of gates to the top of the spillway. The current capacity of the dam is 777,000 megalitres. 

==Activities==
Swimming is permitted from the shore and there is a boat ramp that provides access for sailing, fishing, and skiing etc.  Various watercraft, including house boats can be hired and organised. Fishing cruises are also available. <ref>[http://www.calliope.qld.gov.au/Visitors/docs/attractions.html Attractions in Calliope Shire<!-- Bot generated title -->][[Image:SwingsLakeAwoonga.JPG|thumb|Playground area at Lake Awoonga]] </ref>

The waters of Lake Awoonga are controlled by Queensland Boating and Fisheries Patrol and [[Queensland Water Police]].

The lake is a popular fishing spot, especially for [[Barramundi]]. [http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/recreation.html The Barramundi closed season] does not apply to Lake Awoonga, although some limits do apply:

==Fauna==
Lake Awoonga is home to a thriving array of small animals, several of which are of conservation significance. Aquatic vegetation maintains an array of small animals that support the fish, eels, turtles, platypus and birds. Other species of birds, reptiles, and native fauna including [[bandicoot]]s, [[rufous bettong]]s, [[kangaroo]]s, [[wallaby|wallabies]], [[Greater Glider]]s, [[Yellow-bellied Glider]]s, and [[Common Brushtail Possum|brushtail possums]] can be found around the lake. <ref name="flora">http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/flora.html</ref>

The Lake hosts more than 210 species of birds. <ref name="flora"/> Species include the [[southern squatter pigeon]] (listed as of conservation significance) and a further twenty-two bird species listed on International Migratory Conservation Agreement Lists. {{Fact|date=June 2008}}

The Gladstone Area Water Board has a [http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/hatchery.html fish breeding program] in place and breeds Barramundi, [[Mangrove red snapper|Mangrove Jack]] and [[Mullet]] for stocking into [http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/faqs.html Lake Awoonga]as well as some of the surrounding waterways. Approximately 300,000 fish are released into [http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/faqs.html Lake Awoonga] each year (200,000 Barramundi and 100,000 Mullet, and small numbers of Mangrove Jack). The fish are bred at a purpose-built fish hatchery, operated jointly by the [http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au Gladstone Area Water Board] and the Central Queensland Ports Authority. The [http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/hatchery.html hatchery] is one of the largest breeders of barramundi fingerlings in Queensland and their mangrove jack breeding program has resulted in [http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/hatchery.html Lake Awoonga] holding the largest stocks in Australia with over 13,000 released. 
[http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/hatchery.html Lake Awoonga] fish include Agassiz's Glass Perch, Banded Grunter, Barramundi, Bony Bream, [[Rainbowfish|Eastern Rainbowfish]], [[Eeltail catfish]], Fly-specked Hardyhead, Forktail Catfish, [[Gudgeon]], Long-finned Eel, [[Alligator gar|Longtom]], Mouth Almighty, Sea Mullet, Snub-nose Garfish, Spangled Perch. (Present in low numbers: Hyrtl<U+2019>s Tandan, Mangrove Jack, [[Saratoga (fish)|Saratoga]], [[Silver Perch]], [[Sleepy Cod]], [[Sooty grunter]], and [[Golden perch|Yellowbelly]]) 
Since 1996, over 2.5 million barramundi fingerlings and 470,000 mullet fingerlings have been released into the Lake. <ref>http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/hatchery.html</ref>. Barramundi in the 10-25kg range are regularly caught from the lake
The [http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au Gladstone Area Water Board] has a continuing fishery monitoring program in place using net surveys, to evaluate the success of the restocking effort. Although not deliberately stocked, redclaw crayfish have become well established at the lake.
