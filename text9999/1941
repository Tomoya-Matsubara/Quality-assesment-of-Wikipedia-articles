'''Walter de Lacy''' (died 27 March 1085) was a Norman nobleman who came to England after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066. He received lands in Herefordshire and Shropshire, and served King [[William the Conqueror|William I of England]] by leading military forces during 1075. He died in 1085 and one son inherited his lands. Another son became an [[abbot]].

==Early life==

Walter was originally from [[Lassy, Calvados|Lassy]], in Normandy. He had a brother, [[Ilbert de Lacy]].<ref name=DP452>Keats-Rohan ''Domesday People'' p. 452</ref> Ilbert was the ancestor of the [[de Lacy]] family of [[Pontefract]]. Both Walter and Ilbert jointly held the Norman lands that were held of the [[Bishop of Bayeux]].<ref name=DNB>Lewis "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15863 Lacy, Walter de (d. 1085)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

==Career in England==

Walter was given the lordship of [[Weobley]] in Herefordshire after the Conquest.<ref name=DP452/> He is already attested in the [[Welsh Marches]] by 1069,<ref name=Green44>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 44</ref> when he is recorded stopping a Welsh attack and then raiding into Wales in retribution.<ref name=Wrightman167>Wrightman ''Lacy Family'' p. 167</ref> Walter and Ilbert may have come to England in the household of [[Odo of Bayeux]], the Bishop of Bayeux and half-brother of King [[William the Conqueror]].<ref name=Green93>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 93</ref> Although some historians, such as W. E. Wrightman, have argued that Walter was a follower of [[William fitzOsbern]],<ref name=Wrightman168/> others, including C. P. Lewis and K. S. B. Keats-Rohan, have argued that Walter was an independent agent in England.<ref name=DP452/><ref name=DNB/> By the time of Walter's death, he held a block of lands in Herefordshire along the border with Wales. Another group of lands was centered on [[Ludlow]] in Shropshire. These two groupings of lands allowed Walter to help defend the border of England against Welsh raids. Walter also had other lands in Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, and Oxfordshire. Walter kept a large number of his manors in [[demesne]], managing them directly rather than giving them as fiefs to his knightly followers.<ref name=Green152>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' pp. 152<U+2013>153</ref> Some of these lands in Hereford, including [[Holme Lacy]], were held of the [[Bishop of Hereford]] through [[fief|feudal tenure]].<ref name=Garnett94>Garnett ''Conquered England'' p. 94</ref> In total, ''[[Domesday Book]]'' records Walter's lands as being worth <U+20A4>423 in income per year and as comprising 163 manors in 7 different counties.<ref name=Found21>Coplestone-Crow "From Foundation to the Anarchy" ''Ludlow Castle'' p. 21</ref> He was one of 21 individuals with land valued at more than <U+20A4>400 at the time of the survey.<ref>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 36</ref>

In 1075, Walter was one of the leaders of the force that prevented [[Roger de Breteuil]] from joining up with the other rebels during the [[Revolt of the Earls]]. Walter had joined forces with [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|Wulfstan]] the [[Bishop of Worcester]], [[<U+00C6>thelwig]] the [[Abbot of Evesham|Abbot of Evesham Abbey]], and [[Urse d'Abetot]] the [[High Sheriff of Worcestershire|Sheriff of Worcester]].<ref name=Williams60>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 60 footnote 61</ref>

==Family and death==

Walter married Emma or Emmelina and they had three sons&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Roger de Lacy|Roger]], Hugh and Walter. Roger was the heir to Weobley and Walter became [[Abbot of Gloucester|Abbot]] of [[Gloucester Abbey]].<ref name=DP452/> Occasionally the elder Walter is claimed to have married twice&nbsp;<U+2013> once to Emma and once to an Ermeline, but this is probably a confusion of the variations of Emma's name. Walter and Emma also had a daughter who became a nun at [[St Mary's Abbey, Winchester]]. A niece was married to Ansfrid de Cormeilles.<ref name=Wrightman168>Wrightman ''Lacy Family'' pp. 168<U+2013>170</ref> Considerable confusion exists about Sybil, the wife of [[Pain fitzJohn]]. C. P. Lewis names her as the daughter of Walter,<ref name=DNB/> but W. E. Wrightman calls her the daughter of Hugh, Walter's son.<ref name=Wrightman175>Wrightman ''Lacy Family'' p. 175</ref> Yet another pedigree has her as the daughter of Agnes, the daughter of Walter. In this rendition, favoured by Bruce Coplestone-Crow, Agnes was married to Geoffrey Talbot.<ref name=Found22>Coplestone-Crow "From Foundation to the Anarchy" ''Ludlow Castle'' p. 22</ref>

The elder Walter died on 27 March 1085,<ref name=DNB/> falling off some scaffolding at [[Saint Guthlac's Priory]] when he was inspecting the progress of the building at that monastery.<ref name=Green427>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 427</ref> He was buried in the [[chapter house]] at Gloucester Abbey.<ref name=DNB/> He was a benefactor to Gloucester Abbey,<ref name=Green398>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 398</ref> as well as Saint Guthlac's.<ref name=DNB/>
