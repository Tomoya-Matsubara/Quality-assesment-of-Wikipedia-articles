Accessed [[September 2]] [[2007]].</ref>

==Murders==
On [[November 17]] [[1980]], 12-year-old Christine Weller of [[Surrey, British Columbia]] was abducted.<ref name="CourtTV">Section source. Kerr, Jan Bouchard. [http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/olson/1.html Clifford Olson: The Case of the Missing Lower Mainland Children] [[Court TV]]. Accessed [[September 2]] [[2007]].</ref> She was found on [[Christmas Day]], [[strangled]] with a belt and stabbed repeatedly. On [[April 16]] [[1981]], Colleen Marian Daignault, 13, vanished. It was five months before her body was found. By then, Daryn Todd Johnsrude, 16, had also been abducted and killed. 16-year-old Sandra Wolfsteiner was murdered on May 19 and 13-year-old Ada Court in April.  

Six victims follow in quick succession in [[July 1981]]: Simon Partington, 9, abducted, raped and strangled on the second day of the month; Judy Kozma, 14, [[rape]]d and strangled a week later; Raymond King Jr., 15, abducted on July 23, raped and bludgeoned to death; Sigrun Arnd, an 18-year old [[German people|German]] tourist, raped and bludgeoned the following day; Terri Lyn Carson, 15, raped and strangled; Louise Chartrand, age 17, the last victim identified, died on July 30.

Olson was an atypical serial killer in that he targeted both boys and girls. His victims were also of varying ages.

==Arrest and plea bargain==
Olson, who had an extensive criminal history,<ref name="CBC">[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/olson-clifford/ Clifford Olson The Beast of British Columbia] CBC Canada. [[July 19]] [[2006]]. Accessed [[September 2]] [[2007]].</ref> was arrested on August 12 on suspicion of attempts to abduct two girls.<ref name="CourtTV"/> He reached a controversial deal with authorities, agreeing to confess to the 11 murders and show police where the bodies of those not recovered were buried, in return for which he wanted $10,000 paid to his wife for each victim; the agreement made, his wife received $100,000 after Olson cooperated with police.<ref name="CBC"/> In [[January 1982]], Olson [[guilty plea|pleaded guilty]] to 11 counts of murder and was given 11 concurrent [[life sentence]]s to be served in Canada's maximum-security [[Special Handling Unit]].<ref name="CTV"/>

==Parole application==
In 1997, Olson was denied [[parole]], for which he applied under Canada's "faint-hope" clause, which allowed a parole hearing for convicts who had served 15 years.<ref name="CBC"/><ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/07/18/olson-hearing.html Clifford Olson 'will kill again' if freed, parole board says in ruling] CBC Canada [[July 18]] [[2006]]. Accessed [[September 2]] [[2007]].</ref>

Canadian law allows inmates convicted of first-degree murder to apply for parole after serving a minimum of 25 years. Olson's second parole hearing, on [[July 18]], [[2006]], was also denied.<ref name="kill again">[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/07/18/olson-hearing.html Clifford Olson 'will kill again' if freed, parole board says in ruling] CBC Canada [[July 18]] [[2006]]. Accessed [[September 2]] [[2007]].</ref> Olson made many bizarre and false claims, including that the [[United States]] had granted him [[clemency]] for providing information about the [[September 11 attacks]] and that the hearing had no jurisdiction over him because of that..<ref name="kill again">[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/07/18/olson-hearing.html Clifford Olson 'will kill again' if freed, parole board says in ruling] CBC Canada [[July 18]] [[2006]].

In 1983, a bill providing for Olson's execution was introduced in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]. However, the Speaker ruled the bill out of order, providing a precedent against such a bill (a [[bill of attainder]]) in the future. <ref>Debates of the House of Commons, May 14, 1983</ref>

== Film and television ==
* ''The Investigation'', a TV movie, was made in 2002, focusing on allegations that [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) bureaucracy delayed the arrest of Olson. It starred [[Nicholas Lea]], [[Reece Dinsdale]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Lochlyn Munro]]<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296685/ The Investigation (2002)], imdb.com.
