==Conflict with Bijoy==
===Beginning===
On 4 April 2010, Mustafa Jabbar, the proprietor of commercial and closed source Bijoy software and CEO of 'Ananda Computers' said in an article in daily [[Janakantha]], hackers were responsible for spreading pirated copies of his Bijoy on the internet. He accused [[UNDP]] to help these hackers. He further claimed that UNDP had remarkable influence for selecting Avro for national ID database project by [[Bangladesh Election Commission]].<ref name='MustafaJabbarJanakantha'>{{cite news | first = Mustafa | last = Jabbar | title = <U+09B8><U+09BE><U+0987><U+09AC><U+09BE><U+09B0> <U+09AF><U+09C1><U+09A6><U+09CD><U+09A7><U+09C7><U+09B0> <U+09AF><U+09C1><U+0997><U+09C7> <U+09AA><U+09CD><U+09B0><U+09A5><U+09AE> <U+09AA><U+09BE> <U+0965> <U+098F><U+0995><U+09C1><U+09B6> <U+09B6><U+09A4><U+0995> | date = 2010-04-04 | publisher = The Daily Janakantha | url = http://www.dailyjanakantha.com/news_view.php?nc=13&dd=2010-04-04&ni=13623 | work = The Daily Janakantha | accessdate = 2010-12-16 | language = Bengali}}</ref> On the other hand, Avro developers denied  all allegation against them. In addition, they charged Jabbar for continuous harassment in different stages and media by calling them thief and for that their petition was ignored there. They said that the developers behind Bengali computing happened to work under threat of legal persecution and law enforcing agencies. They indicated that Jabbar complained against Avro after losing around 5 crore taka business in Bangladesh Election commission that used free Avro software instead of commercial Bijoy in the nation ID database project.<ref>{{Cite news
