"'''Baby Boy'''" is a song recorded by American recording artist [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]], featuring Jamaican [[reggae]] singer [[Sean Paul]]. It was composed by Knowles, Paul, [[Scott Storch]], Robert Waller and [[Jay-Z]] for her 2003 debut studio album ''[[Dangerously in Love]]''. It was also on the [[Grammy Awards]] winning album [[Dutty Rock]] which was re-released in 2003.   Containing a lyrical interpolation of "No Fear" by [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Originoo Gunn Clappaz|O.G.C]], "Baby Boy" is an R&B and [[dancehall]] song with [[Arabic music]] influences; its lyrics detail a woman's fantasies. The song was considered to be a sequel to Knowles' 2002 collaboration with Jay-Z on "[['03 Bonnie & Clyde]]".

[[Columbia Records]] released "Baby Boy", the second single from ''Dangerously in Love'', to United States radios on August 3, 2003. It was well received by music critics, who complimented the [[Music of India|Indian]], [[Middle Eastern music]] and [[dancehall]] styles in the song, as well as Knowles' collaboration with Paul. "Baby Boy" topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for nine consecutive weeks, and was Knowles' longest-running solo number-one single until 2007. It reached the top ten in many countries, and was certified platinum in Australia and the US.

The song's music video was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and mostly shows Knowles dancing in various locations. "Baby Boy" has remained a staple of Knowles' concert [[set list]]. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2005. During the same year, US singer-songwriter Jennifer Armour filed a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit claiming that Knowles had used the primary musical [[hook (music)|hook]] from her song "Got a Little Bit of Love for You". The suit was dismissed.

Scenes featuring Knowles and Paul are shown separately. The video begins with Paul sitting on a throne while [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]; Knowles is leaning against a wall and dancing. In the following scene, Knowles is seen on a bed tossing herself. Paul is shown with several women who are lying on the floor caressing each other. Knowles walks towards the beach; she spots a man, and the two touch and flirt. As the second verse of the begins, Knowles is at a party. At the party Knowles decides to dance with the same man that she interacted with earlier. Then, water floods the floor of the party as she sings "the dance floor becomes the sea". As the second chorus of the song begins, the video is cut with scenes of Knowles and four back-up dancers dancing on a platform in the sand on the beach. The original track is interrupted towards the end with an [[Arabic music|Arabic]] instrumental, designed for the music video. This section showcases Knowles vigorously dancing on the sand.

With regard to the musical hook, the Expert stated in his report, "When the aural comparisons of the two songs are presented in the key of C Minor (for easy comparison) and presented back-to-back, in A<U+2013>B<U+2013>A<U+2013>B fashion, even the least musically inclined listener should immediately determine that the two songs are strikingly similar; I daresay that many listeners may even perceive them as being the same song! And again, transposing a song for this purpose does not alter any fundamental qualities or characteristics of the song but merely assists the ability of those unfamiliar with the technicalities of music in making a comparison."  The district court judge nonetheless ruled that she, herself, could not hear the similarities between the two songs and dismissed the case, denying the motion for the songs or case to be heard by a jury.<ref name="Case"/>

On appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] affirmed the district court's ruling, but ruled with different reasoning.  It held that there was no infringement based on Knowles' claim that Armour's demo tape was received shortly after the writing of Knowles' song had been substantially completed.  However, the court did not address the issue of substantial similarity.<ref name="IE"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C06/06-20934-CV0.wpd.pdf |title=Armour v.
