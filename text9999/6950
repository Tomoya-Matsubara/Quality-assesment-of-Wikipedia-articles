The '''Fokker F.II''' was the first of a long series of commercial aircraft from the Fokker Aircraft Company, flying in 1919. In a biplane age, it presented a distinct clean, high-wing monoplane style that sold successfully across Europe and North America during the development of commercial passenger-carrying aviation.

==Design and development==
The Fokker F.II was a single engined high-wing cantilever monoplane with a design lineage that went back to designer [[Reinhold Platz]]'s [[Fokker Dr.I|Dr.I]] triplane, via the biplane [[Fokker D.VII|D.VII]] and monoplane [[Fokker D.VIII|D.VIII]] fighters and his unflown [[Fokker F.I (airliner)|F.I]] civil design. The Dr.I was the first aircraft <ref>Anderson p.309-310</ref> to use the thick high lift/drag airfoils that enabled high climb rates and also allowed internal wing bracing. Hence the triplane wing needed no external wire bracing and its monoplane successors, apart from attachments to the fuselage were simple cantilever structures.

The F.II had other characteristic early-Fokker design features: a wing constructed of wood, fully skinned in plywood, with ailerons extending beyond the wingtips and a deep sided square section fuselage of welded steel tube covered in fabric which provided enough directional stability that no vertical fin was fitted. The F.II had a fixed undercarriage, the main units of which were joined by a cross-axle.

There was enclosed accommodation for four passengers; a fifth could travel alongside the pilot in his unenclosed cockpit, in a seat originally intended for a mechanic or navigator.
   
The prototype F.II, known by the company designation V.45, was constructed at the Fokker factory in [[Schwerin]], Germany, and made its first flight there in October 1919. When [[Anthony Fokker]] decided to relocate the firm to the Netherlands, the V.45 was illegally flown across the border on 20 March 1920. Even after this, perhaps another three examples were built at Schwerin before production shifted to [[Veere]]. The prototype was powered by a 138&nbsp;kW (185&nbsp;hp) [[BMW IIIa]]. This proved to have cooling problems, and after an experiment with a 133&nbsp;kW (178&nbsp;hp) Mercedes motor, [[KLM]] who took this machine as one of two they ordered fitted it with a 179&nbsp;kW (240&nbsp;hp) [[Armstrong Siddeley Puma]]. Their second F.II was similarly re-engined.

In Germany, however, the technical manager of ''Deutsche Aero Lloyd'', Karl Grulich arranged to build the type under licence for the airline, making a few modifications of his own to the design. These included strengthened landing gear, a redesigned cockpit, and redesigned trapezoidal cabin windows. At least 20, the great majority of F.IIs, were assembled by ''Deutsche Aero Lloyd'' at [[Staaken]], Berlin. They built the fuselages there, but the wings were built by [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] and were then supplied to the airline for final assembly. These rather heavier aircraft were powered by 172&nbsp;kW (230&nbsp;hp) [[BMW IV]] (and later 239&nbsp;kW/320&nbsp;hp [[BMW V]]a) motors.

==Operational history==
[[KLM]] operated two F.IIs between 1920 and 1927, which were then sold to [[SABENA]] who used them on their [[Brussels]]-[[Antwerp]] route. The machines that Fokker had built in Germany were bought by ''[[Deutsche Luftreederei]]'' and registered in the [[Free City of Danzig]]. ''Deutsche Aero Lloyd''{{'}}s aircraft were used right up until the time the airline was absorbed by [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Deutsche Lufthansa]] in 1926, at which point ten machines remained. These were put to use on regional routes linking [[Cologne]] with [[Aachen]], [[Essen]], [[Krefeld]], and [[M<U+00FC>lheim]] until 1934.
