'''Augustus Owsley Stanley''' (May 21, 1867 &ndash; August 12, 1958) was a politician from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kentucky]]. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he served as the thirty-eighth [[governor of Kentucky]] and also represented the state in both the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. From 1903 to 1915, Stanley represented [[Kentucky's 2nd congressional district]] in the House of Representatives, where he gained a reputation as a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive reformer]]. Beginning in 1904, he called for an [[Competition law|antitrust]] investigation of the [[American Tobacco Company]], claiming they were a [[monopoly]] that drove down prices for the [[tobacco]] farmers of his district. As a result of his investigation, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] broke up the American Tobacco Company in 1911. Stanley also chaired a committee that conducted an antitrust investigation of [[United States Steel|U.S. Steel]], which brought him national acclaim. Many of his ideas were incorporated into the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]].

During an unsuccessful senatorial bid in 1914, Stanley assumed an anti-[[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] stance. This issue would dominate his political career for more than a decade and put him at odds with [[J. C. W. Beckham]], the leader of the pro-[[temperance movement|temperance]] faction of the state's Democratic Party. In 1915, Stanley ran for governor, defeating his close friend [[Edwin P. Morrow]] by just over 400 votes. It was the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history. Historian [[Lowell H. Harrison]] called Stanley's administration the apex of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. Among the reforms adopted during his tenure were a state antitrust law, a [[campaign finance reform]] law, and a [[workman's compensation]] law. Near the end of his term, Stanley became a candidate to succeed the recently-deceased senator [[Ollie M. James]]. Stanley was elected to James' seat, but accomplished little in his single term in the Senate. He lost his re-election bid to [[Frederic M. Sackett]] and never again held elected office. He died in [[Washington, D. C.]] on August 12, 1958.

==Early life==
Augustus Owsley Stanley was born in [[Shelbyville, Kentucky]] on May 21, 1867; he was the eldest of seven children of William and Amanda (Owsley) Stanley.<ref name=burckel137>Burckel, p. 137</ref> His father was a minister of the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] and served as a [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|judge advocate]] on the staff of [[Joseph E. Johnston]] in the [[Confederate Army]].<ref name=johnson1109>Johnson, p. 1109</ref> His mother was the niece of former Kentucky governor [[William Owsley]].<ref name=powell82>Powell, p. 82</ref> He attended Gordon Academy in [[Nicholasville, Kentucky]] and the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the [[University of Kentucky]]) before graduating with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[Centre College]] in 1889.<ref name=nga>"Kentucky Governor Augustus Owsley Stanley". National Governors Association.</ref> At both Centre and Kentucky A&M, he competed at the State Oratorical Contest, becoming the only such competitor to represent two different institutions.<ref name=johnson1109 />

For a year after graduation, Stanley served as [[chairperson|chair]] of [[belles-lettres]] at Christian College in [[Hustonville, Kentucky]].<ref name=johnson1109 /> The following year, he was principal of Marion Academy in [[Bradfordsville, Kentucky|Bradfordsville]], then spent two years in the same position at Mackville Academy in [[Mackville, Kentucky|Mackville]].<ref name=johnson1109 /><ref name=congbio>"Augustus O. Stanley". Biographical Directory of the United States Congress.</ref> While he held these positions, he studied law under Gilbert Cassiday.<ref name=appleton145>Appleton in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 145</ref> He was admitted to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in 1894, and opened his practice in [[Flemingsburg, Kentucky]].<ref name=congbio />

==Political career==
Stanley's first venture into the political arena was in 1897 when he made an unsuccessful bid to become [[county attorney]] of [[Fleming County, Kentucky|Fleming County]].<ref name=harrison847>Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 847</ref> He continued to practice law in Flemingsburg until March 1898 when he moved to [[Henderson, Kentucky|Henderson]] because of financial hardships.<ref name="appleton145"/> He served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Electoral College|presidential elector]] on the ticket of [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1900.<ref name=harrison847 />

===House of Representatives===
In 1902, Stanley was elected as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Kentucky's 2nd congressional district]].<ref name=appleton145 /> During his tenure in the House, he served on the [[United States House Committee on Mines and Mining|Committee on Mines and Mining]], the [[United States House Committee on Territories|Committee on Territories]], and the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Committee on Agriculture]].<ref name=johnson1109 /> He advocated for [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] reforms such as more extensive study of mine accident prevention, railroad regulation, a pure food and drug act, and an eight-hour work day.<ref name=burckel144 />

By the time of Stanley's election to the House, the [[American Tobacco Company]] had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business.<ref name=burckel137 /> The company worked with [[Great Britain|British]] [[tobacco]] manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide.<ref name=burckel137 /> Congressman Stanley came to the defense of the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate.<ref name=appleton145 /> In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco.<ref name=burckel138>Burckel, p. 138</ref> The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company.<ref name=burckel138 /> In 1904, he convinced the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.<ref name=burckel138 />

Besides his legislative efforts on behalf of farmers, Stanley also directly encouraged them to organize and keep their crops off the market until prices improved.<ref name=burckel138 /> He helped draft the charter for the Dark District Tobacco Planters Association.<ref name=burckel138 /> Some of the more radical members of this group, known as the "Night Riders", used [[vigilante]] violence to compel membership in the Association during what became known as the [[Black Patch Tobacco Wars]].<ref name=burckel138 /> 

Finally in 1909, Stanley attached his proposed repeal of the tobacco tax as a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] to the [[Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act]].<ref name=burckel140>Burckel, p. 140</ref> The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision.<ref name=burckel140 /> Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law.<ref name=burckel140 /> The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he received much of the credit.<ref name=burckel140 /> In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies.<ref name=burckel140 /> Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.<ref name=nhok281>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 281</ref>

Stanley gained national notoriety for his actions against [[United States Steel|U.S. Steel]]. In 1909, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the company, but it died in the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]]. A second resolution, introduced in June 1910, passed the House, but was ignored by [[President of the United States|President]] [[William Howard Taft]]. Stanley introduced a stronger resolution later that month, but it was killed in committee. After Republicans lost control of the house in the 1910 congressional elections, Stanley reintroduced his resolution. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Champ Clark]] appointed him as chairman of a nine-member committee to investigate U.S. Steel.<ref>Burckel, pp. 141&ndash;142</ref> 

The committee's investigation lasted from May 1911 to April 1912. At its conclusion, the committee split along party lines. Stanley authored the majority report which condemned alleged [[price fixing]] by U.S. Steel and censured President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for his role in U.S. Steel's purchase of the [[Tennessee Coal and Iron Company]]. The minority report, authored by Republican [[Augustus P. Gardner]], absolved Roosevelt and downplayed the price fixing charges. Stanley's report also recommended a number of changes to strengthen the [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]]. Though his recommendations were not enacted into law during his time in the House, many of them were eventually included in the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]].<ref>Burckel, pp. 142&ndash;144</ref>

===1915 senatorial bid===
[[File:J. C. W. Beckham.jpg|thumb|right|J. C. W. Beckham became Stanley's political enemy for the duration of his political career|alt=Black and white image of a clean shaven man with drooping eyelids, aged about forty. He is wearing a black bowler hat, white shirt, tie and dark overcoat.]]
Despite having no serious challengers for his House seat, Stanley declined to seek re-election in 1915, choosing instead to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate.<ref name=burckel144>Burckel, p. 144</ref> He was one of three Democrats seeking the seat, the others being Governor [[James B. McCreary]] and former governor [[J. C. W. Beckham]].<ref name=klotter224>Klotter, p. 224</ref> McCreary was never a serious challenger, and the [[Primary election|primary]] campaign centered on Stanley and Beckham, the leaders of the two largest factions of the state's Democratic party.<ref name=klotter224 /> The two men disliked each other. Stanley had once referred to Beckham as "a [[fungus]] growth on the grave of Goebel" &ndash; an allusion to Beckham's former running mate, Governor [[William Goebel]], whose assassination in 1900 had elevated Beckham to the governorship.<ref name=klotter224 /> During the campaign, Stanley criticized Beckham's use of [[political machine|machine politics]], calling his opponent "[[Little Lord Fauntleroy]]".<ref name=klotter224 />

[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] became the major issue of the campaign. Though both Stanley and Beckham were known to drink liquor, Beckham campaigned on a pro-[[temperance movement|temperance]] platform.<ref name=nhok283>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 283</ref> Stanley, an opponent of prohibition, criticized Beckham's position as hypocritical, saying of pro-temperance politicians in general and Beckham in particular "They keep full of booze and introduce bills to punish the man who sells it to them."<ref name=nhok214>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 214</ref> "[Beckham] would sell out the world to go to the Senate," he added.<ref name=nhok283 />  The support of ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' editor [[Henry Watterson]] and Representative [[Ben Johnson (politician)|Ben Johnson]] were not enough to carry Stanley to victory.<ref name=nhok225>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 225</ref> Beckham secured the Democratic nomination by almost 7,000 votes and went on to win the seat in the general election.<ref name=nhok225 />

===Governor of Kentucky===
Several candidates announced their intention to seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1915, but by late August, only two remained in the race.<ref name=klotter225>Klotter, p. 225</ref> Stanley was the choice of the anti-prohibition faction of the party, while state [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] Harry V. McChesney represented the prohibition faction, backed by Beckham.<ref>Klotter, pp. 225&ndash;226</ref> Stanley won the nomination with 107,585 votes to McChesney's 69,722.<ref name=klotter226>Klotter, p. 226</ref> The Republicans nominated Stanley's close friend [[Edwin P. Morrow]].<ref name=klotter226 /> The two traveled the state together, often speaking from the same stage.<ref name=klotter227>Klotter, p. 227</ref>

Stanley was a powerful orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, and by the end of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat.<ref name="nhok283"/> In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog.<ref name=harrison847 /> Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free.<ref name=harrison847 /> Stanley ridiculed the idea as "Free Old Dog Ring," and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal.<ref name=harrison847 /> On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke.<ref name=nhok285>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 285</ref> When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach."<ref name=nhok285 />

Democrats had been divided in the primary, but united behind Stanley in the general election. Senators Beckham and [[Ollie M. James]] endorsed him, as did Governor [[James B. McCreary]]. [[Samuel Gompers]] praised Stanley for his opposition to trusts while in Congress; endorsements from local chapters of the [[American Federation of Labor]] soon followed. Even Harry McChesney, Stanley's primary opponent, urged Kentuckians to vote a [[Straight-ticket voting|straight Democratic ticket]].<ref>Appleton in ''Register'', pp. 50&ndash;51</ref>

The election was too close to call on election night. Knowing that a challenged election would be decided by the heavily Democratic General Assembly, Morrow conceded a week later. Official results showed that Stanley won the election by 471 votes, the closest gubernatorial vote in the state's history.<ref>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', pp. 285&ndash;286</ref>

Historian [[Lowell H. Harrison]] called Stanley's administration the apex of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive]] Era in Kentucky.<ref name=nhok286>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 286</ref> The most significant legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state [[Competition law|antitrust law]] and a ban on railroads offering free passes to public figures.<ref name=nhok286 /> A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade [[Public utility|public service corporations]] from contributing to any campaign.<ref name=klotter228>Klotter, p. 228</ref> Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first [[workman's compensation]] law, and instituting a convict labor law.<ref name=harrison847 /> The one progressive measure that did not pass, a bill granting [[women's suffrage]], failed in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|House]] by a single vote.<ref name=klotter229>Klotter, p. 229</ref>

Stanley called the General Assembly into special session in February 1917.<ref name=appleton147>Appleton in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 147</ref> At issue was reformation of the state's tax code, which Stanley felt unjustly burdened agricultural interests.<ref name=appleton147 /> The state was also incurring large deficits, ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 annually.<ref name=klotter230>Klotter, p. 230</ref> Though Kentucky was in better shape financially than many of its peers, Stanley still sought to balance the budget.<ref name=klotter230 /> The session lasted sixty days, and the legislature passed of many of the bills he advocated. The most significant created a three-member state tax commission, chaired by [[M. M. Logan]].<ref name=appleton147 /> Additional taxes were passed on [[Distilled beverage|distilled spirits]], oil production, race tracks, and corporate licenses.<ref name=klotter231>Klotter, p. 231</ref> Assessments on the value of property, which had typically been evaluated at one-third to one-half of fair market price, rose dramatically.<ref>Klotter, pp. 230&ndash;231</ref> To balance this increase, legislators reduced the tax rates on certain types of property.<ref name=klotter231 /> With the dramatic increase in funds yielded by the the special session, the General Assembly approved funding increases in nearly every part of state government, including higher education.<ref name=klotter231 /> The State Board of Health was given expanded powers, and county boards of health were established.<ref name=klotter231 />

Stanley's administration was affected by the United States' entry into [[World War I]]. The legislature established and funded a state Council of Defense,<ref name=klotter231 /> but Stanley [[veto]]ed a bill that would have banned the teaching of [[German language|German]] in public schools.<ref name=harrison847 /> 

As in his run for Senate and in the gubernatorial primary, the liquor question was central to Stanley's tenure as governor. Although anti-prohibition forces declared prohibition dead following his election, a prohibition amendment was introduced during the first legislative session following it.<ref name=register52>Appleton in ''Register'', p. 52</ref> The amendment failed by a vote of 20&ndash;14 in the [[Kentucky Senate|state senate]].<ref name=register52 /> In 1918 it was submitted to the state's voters by an overwhelming 95&ndash;17 joint vote of the General Assembly.<ref name=register52 /> Although Stanley was against prohibition, he supported the 1918 amendment in order to settle the liquor issue and clear the legislature's order paper for other measures.<ref name=register53>Appleton in ''Register'', p. 53</ref> In 1919, Kentucky was the first "wet" state to ratify the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], enshrining prohibition into the [[United States Constitution|national constitution]].<ref name=harrison847 />

===U.S. Senator===
[[File:OJames.jpg|thumb|right|Ollie M. James; Stanley succeeded him in the U.S. Senate|alt=A black and white photo of a bald, middle-aged man]]
On August 18, 1918, incumbent senator Ollie M. James died.<ref name=appleton148>Appleton in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 148</ref> Stanley appointed [[George B. Martin]] to finish James' term, which was to expire the following year.<ref name=klotter231 /> James had already been nominated for re-election in 1919 by the Democratic primary, and the task of selecting the party's new nominee fell to the Democratic State Committee, which nominated Stanley.<ref name=klotter231 /> Stanley enjoyed the advantage of a united Democratic party; J. C. W. Beckham supported Stanley for this seat so Stanley would not challenge him for his own seat when he faced re-election.<ref name=klotter231 /> The Republicans chose a relative unknown, Dr. Ben L. Bruner.<ref name=klotter231 /> Stanley was attacked for his veto of the German language bill and for his long-standing views against temperance.<ref name=klotter231 /> Though the national mood was against the Democrats, a letter of support from [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] bolstered Stanley's campaign, and he defeated Bruner by more than 5,000 votes.<ref name=klotter231 /> He resigned as governor to assume the Senate seat in May 1919.<ref name=appleton148 /> As a Democrat in a mostly Republican Senate, he wielded little influence.<ref name=appleton148 />

When Stanley sought re-election to his seat in 1924, he faced an uphill battle. No Kentucky senator had been re-elected to his seat in over forty years.<ref name=klotter281>Klotter, p. 281</ref> His opposition to prohibition cost him the support of pro-temperance voters and Democratic governor [[William J. Fields]].<ref name=nhok354>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 354</ref> He was also opposed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], then a powerful organization in the state, because of his opposition to bigotry and secret organizations.<ref name=finch46>Finch, p. 46</ref> His Republican opponent [[Frederic M. Sackett]] secured the support of the Beckham wing of the Democratic Party.<ref name=nhok355>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 355</ref> Despite having his own private stock of liquor, Sackett took a pro-temperance position in the campaign and was endorsed by the [[Anti-Saloon League]].<ref name=klotter281 /> ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' editor [[Robert Worth Bingham]] added his endorsement, calling Sackett "one of the best men I know".<ref name=klotter281 /> In the general election, Stanley lost his seat by almost 25,000 votes.<ref name=nhok355 /> Sackett's victory meant Kentucky would have two Republican senators for the first time in its history.<ref name=klotter282>Klotter, p. 282</ref>

==Later life and death==
Following his defeat in the Senate, Stanley returned to his legal practice. In the 1927 gubernatorial election, he threw his support to his old enemy, J. C. W. Beckham, hoping to improve his chances of returning to the Senate in 1930.<ref name=finch43>Finch, p. 43</ref> Beckham lost to Republican [[Flem D. Sampson]], greatly diminishing Stanley's chances in the senatorial campaign.<ref name=finch43 />

In 1930, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed Stanley to the [[International Joint Commission]], a body charged with settling boundary disputes between the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].<ref name=harrison847 /> Stanley became its chair in 1933.<ref name=harrison847 /> He was very proud of his service on the Commission, and once noted that nowhere on earth have two great powers lived so long as neighbors with so few disputes.<ref name=powell82 /> He served until 1954 when he resigned under pressure from his own party.<ref name=harrison847 /> 

Stanley died in [[Washington, D.C.]], on August 12, 1958 and was buried in [[Frankfort Cemetery]] in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]. He was survived by his wife, Sue (Soaper) Stanley, and two of his three sons, William and Augustus, Jr.<ref name=appleton148 /> His grandson, [[Owsley Stanley|Augustus Owsley Stanley III]], became a well-known [[LSD]] chemist during the [[hippie movement]].<ref>Jackson, p. 90</ref>
