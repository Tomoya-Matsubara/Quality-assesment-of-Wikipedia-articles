'''''Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker''''' was a [[computer game]] by veteran programmer [[Archer MacLean]], released by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] in [[1991 in video gaming|1991]] for the [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] (later for the [[Sega Mega Drive]]). Although the game was not the first to simulate a [[snooker]] or [[Pocket billiards|pool]] [[Billiard table|table]] in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], it made full use of the [[Instructions per second|processing power]] and [[Graphics card|graphics capabilities]] of [[16-bit]] [[Personal computer|home computers]] and was praised for its then ground-breaking realism and easy-to-use [[User interface design|interface]]. Many remarked{{Who|date=August 2008}} that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table that existed at that time, and that it could be used by a player to refine their real-life snooker skills.

==Development and technology==
The game took MacLean several years to complete; the [[Billiard ball]] [[physics]] alone taking several months of [[Game programming|programming]].{{Fact|date=May 2007}}  One of the reasons why the game runs as quickly as it does is the way in which each {{Cuegloss|Shot|shot}} is played. The next shot is effectively pre-played while the {{Cuegloss|White ball|white ball}} is being {{Cuegloss|Cue|cued}} &ndash; the position and movement of each ball being calculated [[Film frame#Video frame|frame]]-by-frame and kept in a list in [[Computer memory|memory]]. Each frame of the next shot is then displayed by [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] each ball from this list, frame-by-frame, instead of rendering it in [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}}


==Features==
[[Image:JWWS Amiga Taunt.png|thumb|left|A red ball taunts the player.]]Despite being a accurate (for the time) and serious [[Computer simulation|simulation]] of the sport, MacLean's irreverent sense of humour was prominent throughout. The [[sound effect]] used for a successful {{Cuegloss|Pot|pot}} was a resounding "pop" (regardless of the speed at which the ball reached the [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]]) and numerous [[Computer animation|animation]]s provided comic relief should a player take more than a few seconds to take their shot. Balls would sprout eyeballs and arms, making faces at the player or holding up signs that read "Get on with it!" and such. 

Also present was an extensive [[trick shot]] editor, featuring a number of pre-set table arrangements with instructions on how they should be played.  An [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] enabled the option to watch the computer player complete a [[147 break|maximum break]].

The game's title music was similar to (and probably intended to pay homage to) that of snooker TV programme ''[[Pot Black]]''.

==Tournament==
Following the game's release, Virgin launched a nationwide tournament in the UK. Regional heats were held at [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin's stores]]; the eventual winner went on to challenge MacLean himself in the first series of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[GamesMaster]]'' with snooker pro [[Jimmy White]] commentating.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

==Sequels==
The game was followed by ''[[Archer MacLean's Pool]]'' in [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] and ''[[Jimmy White's 2: Cueball]]'' in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].
