A graduate of the [[University of Georgia]] and [[Duke University]], Boyd began in academia as a professor of physics at West Georgia College. He then became a professor at Georgia Tech and a prominent researcher at the Engineering Experiment Station, now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute. At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay, federally funded electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers [[Gerald Rosselot]] and [[Glen P. Robinson]], Boyd was influential in the founding of [[Scientific Atlanta]], where he was a board member for 25 years.<ref name="ross">{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/ROSSELO.TGE.pdf|title=Gerald A.

Neely Research Reactor]].

While he was the third president of West Georgia College (now the University of West Georgia), Boyd increased faculty, degrees, programs, and both undergraduate and graduate enrollment on the campus. Boyd racially integrated the campus in 1963, unprompted by a court order, and oversaw immense construction projects that dramatically expanded the campus to support the increased (and future) enrollment. Hired away to serve as the [[University System of Georgia]]'s Vice Chancellor for Academic Development in 1970, he was almost immediately reassigned to be Georgia Tech's interim president. During his tenure at Georgia Tech from 1971 to 1972, Boyd resolved difficult issues in the attempted takeover of the Engineering Experiment Station by previous Georgia Tech president [[Arthur G. Hansen]] and the poor performance of (and corresponding alumni calls to remove) head football coach [[Bud Carson]].

==Early career==
===Education===
Boyd was born to Emory Fortson and Rosa Lee (n<U+00E9>e Wright) Boyd on July 18, 1906 in [[Tignall, Georgia]], a small town near the eastern border of the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name="boyd5">[[#Ste|Stevenson, p.5]]</ref><ref name="collection">{{cite web|first=Sarah|last=Warren|url=http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/204/124796/James_E_Boyd.pdf|title=James Emory Boyd (1906-1998)|work=Annie Belle Weaver Special Collections|publisher=Ingram Library, University of West Georgia|date=April 2010|page=2|accessdate=2011-04-19}}</ref><ref name="scholinfo">{{cite web|url=http://www.westga.edu/assetsDept/financialAid/1112_Scholarship_Brochure.pdf|title=Emory F. and Rosa W.

In 1946, Boyd returned to Georgia Tech's physics department and its Engineering Experiment Station, where he worked as Assistant Project Director under Frank Lawrence (and, after Lawrence's departure, as Project Director) on an [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]]-sponsored project studying [[microwave]] [[Radio propagation|propagation]]. As part of the project, he conducted long-range line-of-sight experiments between Georgia Tech and [[Mount Oglethorpe]] in North Georgia. In 1947, Boyd co-authored a  study entitled ''Propagation Studies of Electromagnetic Waves'', which resulted in a series of related research contracts, including a large one obtained from the Navy Bureau of Ordinance on [[Fire-control radar|radar-directed fire control]].<ref name="gtri">{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/gtri75/history-makers/dr-james-e-boyd|title=History Makers: Dr. James E.

In 1950, Boyd was named the first head of the newly created Physics Division of the Engineering Experiment Station (now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute). Boyd recruited his former student [[Glen P.

Boyd was promoted to Assistant Director of Research at the Engineering Experiment Station in 1954. He served as director of the station from July 1, 1957, until 1961.<ref name="boyd6"/> While at Georgia Tech, Boyd wrote an influential article about the role of [[research institute|research centers]] at [[institutes of technology]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=James E. |year=1957 |title=Research Center in an Institute of Technology |journal=IRE Transactions on Engineering Management |publisher=[[Institute of Radio Engineers]] |volume=EM-4 |issue=3 |pages=99<U+2013>100 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=5007421 |doi=10.1109/IRET-EM.1957.5007421}}</ref> which argued that research should be integrated with education; Boyd applied this by involving undergraduates in his day-to-day research.<ref name="boyd4"/> Boyd was known for his recruitment of faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research. He was influential enough to be able to override the wishes of [[Joseph Howey]], director of the School of Physics, on occasion: for example, Boyd successfully hired physicist [[Earl W. McDaniel]] in 1954 over Howey's determined opposition.<ref name="boyd3">[[#Ste|Stevenson, p.3]]</ref><ref name="McD">{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/mcdaniel.pdf|title=Earl W.

Boyd dramatically expanded the college during his tenure in both headcount and academic diversity.

==Georgia Tech president==
[[File:James Boyd at Podium cropped.jpg|thumb|James E. Boyd speaking at Georgia Tech.|alt=A man wearing a suit and glasses standing at a podium outside.]]
In a little under a month after Boyd had assumed the vice chancellorship, then-Georgia Tech president [[Arthur G. Hansen]] resigned. Chancellor George L. Simpson appointed Boyd as Acting President of the Georgia Institute of Technology, a post he held from May 1971 to March 1972.<ref name="boyd4"/><ref name="ens400">[[#McM|McMath, p.400]]</ref>

===Engineering Experiment Station===
Simpson's selection of Boyd as interim president was influenced by Boyd's previous experience as an academic administrator and director of the Engineering Experiment Station and Boyd's ongoing position on the station's board of directors.<ref name="ens400"/> The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the Engineering Experiment Station should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money.<ref name="ens400"/><ref name="defend">{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/gtri75/our-75-years/ees-defends-its-independence|title=EES Defends its Independence|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref><ref name="ens399">[[#McM|McMath, p.399]]</ref> The station had sizable and growing support from the state of Georgia and its Industrial Development Council, which developed products and methods and provided technical assistance for Georgia industry.<ref name="ens398">[[#McM|McMath, p.398]]</ref> However, due in part to efforts made by Boyd and previous station director Gerald Rosselot, the station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from the federal government. In 1971, funding to both Georgia Tech's academic units and the Experiment Station began to suffer due to a combination of a sharp decline in state funds and cuts to federal science, research, and education funding after the end of the [[Space Race]] funding boom.<ref name="defend"/> Similar institutions, such as the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], [[Stanford Research Institute]], and the [[Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute]] had weathered this storm by becoming exceedingly good at obtaining research contracts.<ref name="ens398"/>

Boyd's predecessor Arthur G. Hansen's "bold and controversial" solution to both entities' problems was to completely integrate the station into Georgia Tech's academic units.<ref name="ens399"/> On paper, this would dramatically increase Georgia Tech's stated research funding (as all of it would be performed through the academic units), and it would increase options and financial aid for graduate students. Another, less publicized, reason was that Georgia Tech would gain access to the contract organization's reserve fund,{{#tag:ref|The Engineering Experiment Station was renamed the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] in 1984. A separate organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, changed its name to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally to the [[Georgia Tech Research Corporation]] in 1984.<ref name="ens259">[[#McM|McMath, p.259]]</ref><ref name="ens434">[[#McM|McMath, p.434]]</ref> There are legal difficulties when a university attempts to accept contracts from entities, especially the federal government; so the second organization is a contracting organization, a form of a [[shell corporation]] that can accept funding and hold financial and intellectual assets on behalf of the university.

Stelson]], [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] at Georgia Tech, was named to "reorganize" the station. Publicly, Stelson's task was simply to recommend a plan for reorganization, but the administration clearly intended for Georgia Tech and the Engineering Experiment Station to be closely integrated.<ref name="ens399"/> [[Maurice W. Long]], who was director of the station at the time, viewed the move as a violation of the EES's [[charter]] as legislatively established by the [[Georgia General Assembly]] in 1919, and asserted that Georgia Tech did not have the authority to merge the two institutions.<ref name="ens400"/><ref name="ens399"/> EES employees and business executives involved with the station appealed to the [[Georgia Board of Regents]] and to Governor and future United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] (himself a Georgia Tech alumnus), and the controversy was covered in both ''[[The Technique]]'' and the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]''.<ref name="ens400"/><!--it's also covered in the following sources: <ref>{{cite|title=Report of the Director, Engineering Experiment Station|work=Annual Report, 1970-71|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|pages=83-85|date=1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1971-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=[[Atlanta Constitution]]|date=1971-04-01}}</ref>-->

This was the climate into which Boyd entered as interim institute president after Hansen had announced, on April 27, 1971, that he would be departing Georgia Tech to become president of [[Purdue University]] on July 1 of that year.<ref name="ens400"/> Boyd stopped the plan for absolute absorption of the station, but did allow plans for closer control and more aggressive contract solicitation to proceed.<ref name="ens400"/><ref name="defend"/> Among these measures were increased resource-sharing, including increased sharing of physical assets and research staff. The latter was evidenced by the increase in joint faculty appointments between the EES and Georgia Tech. The move paid off, and the fiscal year 1970-1971 saw EES win new contracts and grants, totaling a record $5.2 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5.2|1971|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=1}}}} million today).<ref name="defend"/>{{Inflation-fn|US}}

The complaints were based on a long list of infractions, including "mistreating and humiliating students" and "unsportsmanlike conduct", but the most important issue was his 27<U+2013>27 record. The last straw was his 6<U+2013>6 season record in 1971, which included both a loss to Georgia Tech's [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate|longtime rival]], the [[Georgia Bulldogs]], and to the [[Mississippi State Bulldogs]] in the 1971 [[Peach Bowl]].<ref name="boyd5"/><ref name="cofh">{{cite book | last = Cromartie | first = Bill | title = Clean Old-fashioned Hate: Georgia Vs.
