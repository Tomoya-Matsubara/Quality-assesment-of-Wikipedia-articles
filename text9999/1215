'''Sheerness''' is a town located beside the mouth of the [[River Medway]] on the northwest corner of the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in north [[Kent]], [[England]].           With a population of 12,000 it is the largest town on the island.

Sheerness began as a fort built in the 16th century to protect the River Medway from naval invasion. Because of the [[raid on the Medway]] in 1667, the [[Secretary to the Admiralty]] [[Samuel Pepys]] established a [[Royal Navy]] [[dockyard]] in the town  in 1669, where warships were built and repaired until its closure in 1960.

In the 19th century, Sheerness also became a [[seaside resort]], when a [[pier]] and [[promenade]] were constructed. Industry remains an important part of the town, and the port of Sheerness is one of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] leading car and fresh produce importers. The town is the site of one of the UK's first [[co-operative]] societies and the world's first multi-storey building with a rigid metal frame.

==History==
The first structure in what is now Sheerness was a fort built by order of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to prevent enemy ships from entering the [[River Medway]] and attacking the [[Chatham Dockyard|naval dockyard]] at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]]. In 1666 work began to replace it with a stronger fort. However, before its completion, this second fort was destroyed during the 1667 Dutch [[raid on the Medway]].<ref name="SAccess">{{cite web  | title = History  | publisher = Sheppey Access | url = http://www.clcshe.eclipse.co.uk/history.html  | accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref> The Secretary of the Admiralty, [[Samuel Pepys]], subsequently ordered the construction of a naval dockyard at Sheerness as an extension to that at Chatham,<ref name="1958bbc">{{cite web  | title = 1958: Historic Sheerness docks to close  | publisher = BBC | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/20/newsid_2552000/2552135.stm  | accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref> where naval ships would be built, maintained, and repaired.  Low quality housing and the poor water supply near the dockyard led to a lack of workers and caused construction delays; the first [[dry-dock]] was not completed until 1708. Using materials they were allowed to take from the yard, dockyard construction workers built the first houses in Sheerness. The grey-blue naval paint they used on the exteriors led to their homes becoming known as the Blue Houses. This was eventually corrupted to Bluetown, the modern name of northwest Sheerness.<ref name="SAccess"/>

From the completion of the dockyard until 1960 Sheerness was one of the bases of the [[Nore Command]] of the [[Royal Navy]], which was responsible for protecting British waters in the [[North Sea]]. The command was named after the Nore [[sandbank]] in the [[Thames Estuary]], about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} east of Sheerness.<ref>{{cite web  | title = The Nore  | publisher = The Columbia Encyclopedia | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1E1-Nore.html |date=2006| accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref> In 1797, discontented sailors in the [[Royal Navy]] [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|mutinied]] just off the coast of Sheerness.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Mutiny  | publisher = The Columbia Encyclopedia | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1E1-mutiny.html |date=2006| accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref>

By 1801 the population of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of [[Minster-in-Sheppey|Minster]], reached 5,561.<ref name="visminst">{{cite web  | title =A vision of Minster in Sheppey AP/CP | publisher = VisionOfBritain.org.uk| url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10223015 | accessdate = 2007-07-22 }}</ref> In 1816, one of the UK's first [[co-operative]] societies was started in Sheerness, chiefly to serve the dockyard workers and their families.

In the early 1820s a fire destroyed many buildings at the dockyard, including all the Blue Houses. New houses and a major redevelopment of the dockyard followed. On [[5 September]] [[1823]], the rebuilt dockyard was formally opened by the Duke of Clarence (later [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]). A high brick wall and a moat were constructed around the yard to serve as a defence measure and remained in place until the end of the 19th century. As the settlement expanded eastwards, away from the dockyard and the Blue Houses, the wider area became known as Sheerness,<ref name="SAccess">{{cite web  | title = History  | publisher = Sheppey Access | url = http://www.clcshe.eclipse.co.uk/history.html  | accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref> taking its new name from the brightness or clearness of the water at the mouth of the River Medway.<ref name="RoyalArsenal">{{cite web  | title = Sheerness  | publisher = MaritimeHeritageTrail.co.uk | url = http://www.maritimeheritagetrail.co.uk/EN/loc_history.php?id=8&page=1  | accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref> Completed in 1860 and still standing today, the Sheerness Boat Store was the world's first multi-storey building with a rigid metal frame.<ref name="SAccess"/> In 1863, [[Water supply network|mains water]] was installed in the town, and the Isle of Sheppey's first railway station opened at the dockyard.

In 1944 the United States cargo ship [[SS Richard Montgomery]] ran aground and sank {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} off the coast of Sheerness, with 3,172 tonnes of explosives on board. Due to the inherent danger and projected expense, the ship and its cargo have never been salvaged; if the wreck were to explode, it would be one of the largest non-nuclear explosions of all time. A 2004 report published in ''[[New Scientist]]'' warned that an explosion could occur if sea water penetrated the bombs.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Time Bomb Ready to Blow  | publisher = Evening Standard | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-12667880-details/Timebomb+ready+to+blow/article.do  | date = [[2004-08-19]]|accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref>

In March 1960 the Royal Navy ceased operating the Sheerness dockyard and the Medway Port Authority took over the site for commercial use. The dockyard closure led to thousands of job losses, and most of the nearby houses and shops in the Bluetown area were eventually abandoned and demolished.<ref name="1958bbc">{{cite web  | title = 1958: Historic Sheerness docks to close  | publisher = BBC | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/20/newsid_2552000/2552135.stm  | accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref> By the 1961 census, the population of Sheerness had fallen to 13,691.<ref name="relationsheer">{{cite web  | title =A vision of Sheerness Ch/CP | publisher = VisionOfBritain.org.uk| url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10225449 | accessdate = 2007-07-22 }}</ref> The dockyard closure also led to the decline of the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society, as many of its members were dockyard workers. At the time, the society was the island's main retailer, but it has since been reduced to a few shops and been merged with a larger society.<ref name="heritcoop">{{cite web  | title = The first co-op | publisher = SheernessHeritageCentre.com| url = http://www.sheernessheritagecentre.com/page6sheernesscoop.htm |date=2006| accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref> As of 2007, Bluetown is an industrial area, and Sheerness has become the largest port in the UK for motor imports.<ref name="SAccess"/>

==Governance==
Sheerness is in the [[parliamentary constituency]] of [[Sittingbourne and Sheppey (UK Parliament constituency)|Sittingbourne and Sheppey]]. Since the constituency's creation in 1997, its [[Member of Parliament]] has been [[Derek Wyatt]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Derek Wyatt  | publisher = Guardian.co.uk| url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/0,9290,-5704,00.html  | accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref> Before 1997, Sheppey and Sittingbourne were part of the constituency of [[Faversham (UK Parliament constituency)|Faversham]]. Sheerness is in the [[Districts of England|local government district]] of [[Swale]]. The town is split between the two local government [[Ward (politics)|wards]] of Sheerness East and Sheerness West, which have four of the forty-seven seats on the Swale Borough Council.
