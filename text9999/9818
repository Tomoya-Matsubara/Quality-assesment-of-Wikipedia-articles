The '''African River Martin''' (''Pseudochelidon eurystomina'') is a [[passerine]] [[bird]], one of two members of the [[river martin]] subfamily of the [[swallow]] [[family (biology)|family]], Hirundinidae. When discovered, it was not initially recognised as a swallow, and its structural differences from most of its relatives, including its stout [[beak|bill]] and robust legs and feet, have led to its current placement in a separate subfamily shared only with the Asian [[White-eyed River Martin]]. The African River Martin is a large swallow, mainly black with a blue-green gloss to the head and a greener tint to the back and wings. The under-wings are brownish, the underparts are purple-black, and the [[flight feather]]s are black. This martin has red eyes, a broad orange-red bill and a black, square tail. Young birds are similar in appearance to the adults, but have browner [[plumage]]. This species has a variety of unmusical calls, and displays both in flight and on the ground, although the purpose of the terrestrial display is unknown.

The main breeding areas are in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) along the [[Congo River]] and its tributary, the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi]], in habitats characterised by a mixture of tropical forest types including swampy or seasonally flooded woodland. The African River Martin is [[bird migration|migratory]], wintering in coastal [[savanna]] in southern [[Gabon]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. Breeding also occurs in these coastal areas, but it is unknown whether the migrants are raising a second [[offspring|brood]] or if there is a separate resident population. This martin feeds in flocks throughout the year, catching a variety of insects in the air, especially flying [[ant]]s. It does not use perches during the breeding season, although it will often land on the ground.

The African River Martin nests in burrows in river sand banks, often alongside [[Rosy Bee-eater]]s, but its [[Egg incubation#Avian incubation|incubation]] and [[fledge|fledging]] times are not known. It also digs tunnels in which to spend the night when it is in the wintering areas. It appears to be common within its restricted range, despite being caught in large numbers by the local population for food, and large flocks are sometimes seen. However, due to a lack of detailed information about its breeding range and population numbers, this species is classed as [[Data Deficient]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).

==Taxonomy==
When German zoologist [[Gustav Hartlaub]] first described the African River Martin in 1861, it was not initially thought to be a member of the swallow and martin family, and he placed it with the [[roller]]s.<ref name= Hartlaub>{{cite journal|last= Hartlaub|first=Gustav |authorlink=Gustav Hartlaub|coauthors= |month= |year=1861 |title= Ueber einige neue V<U+00F6>gel Westafrica's|journal= [[Journal f<U+00FC>r Ornithologie]] |volume= 9|issue= 1|page= 12| language =German| doi=10.1007/BF02002444|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/ibis03brit#page/321/mode/1up/search/pseudochelidon}}</ref> Later authors either placed it in its own [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] family, or with the [[woodswallow]]s. A 1938 study of this martin's [[anatomy]] by [[Percy Lowe]] revealed that the species was closest to the swallows and martins, but sufficiently distinct to be placed in a separate subfamily, Pseudochelidoninae.<ref name = Turner>Turner & Rose (1989) pp. 85<U+2013>86.</ref><ref name= lowe>{{cite journal | last= Lowe | first= P R | authorlink = Percy Lowe | year= 1938 | title= Some anatomical notes on the genus ''Pseudochelidon'' (Hartlaub) with reference to its taxonomic position | journal= [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]] | volume= 2 | pages= 429<U+2013>437 }}</ref>

The only other member of the subfamily is the [[White-eyed River Martin]] ''Pseudochelidon sirintarae'', known only from one site in Thailand and possibly extinct. These two species possess a number of features which distinguish them from other swallows and martins, including their robust legs and feet, stout bills, large [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinxes]] (vocal organs) and different [[bronchus|bronchial]] structure.<ref name= Turner/> Genetic studies confirmed that the two river martins form a distinct [[clade]] from the typical swallows in the Hirundininae subfamily.<ref name= sheldon>{{cite journal | last= Sheldon | first= Frederick H | authorlink =Fred Sheldon (ornithologist)| coauthors= Whittingham, Linda A; Moyle, Robert G; Slikas, Beth; Winkler, David W | year= 2005 | title= Phylogeny of swallows (Aves: Hirundinidae) estimated from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA | journal= [[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] | volume= 35 | issue = 1| pages= 254<U+2013>270 | url = |format = | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2004.11.008 | pmid= 15737595 }}</ref>

==Description==

The adult African River Martin is a large swallow, 14&nbsp;cm (5.6&nbsp;in) long. It is mainly black, with a silky blue-green gloss to the head, becoming distinctly green on the back and wing [[Covert (feather)|coverts]]. The underparts, other than the brownish under-wings, are purple-black, and the [[flight feather]]s are black. The black square tail is 4.8&nbsp;cm (1.9&nbsp;in) long,<ref name = Turner/> and the soft [[feather]] shafts project beyond the [[Barb (feather)|barbed]] section. This feature is most pronounced in the two central feathers,<ref name= Hartlaub/> which in the related White-Eyed River Martin are greatly elongated.<ref name= Turner3/> The African River Martin has brown legs with a 1.5&nbsp;cm (0.6&nbsp;in) long [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]], red eyes, pink eye-rings, and a broad orange-red bill. The wing length averages 14&nbsp;cm (5.6&nbsp;in).<ref name = Turner/>

The sexes are similar in appearance.<ref name = Turner/> There are many bird species in which there is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexual dichromatism]] which is not apparent to the human eye, but [[spectroscope|spectroscopic]] analysis of this martin's head feathers suggests that the colour differences between the sexes are small even to the birds' perception.<ref name= eaton>{{cite journal | last= Eaton | first= Muir D | year=2005 | title= Human vision fails to distinguish widespread sexual dichromatism among sexually "monochromatic" birds | journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume= 102 |language = | issue = 31 | pages= 10942<U+2013>10946 | url =http://www.pnas.org/content/102/31/10942.long |format = | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501891102PNAS }}</ref> Juveniles are duller and have sooty brown heads. The [[moult]] to adult plumage takes place in the wintering areas and is largely complete by October.<ref name = Turner/>

The African River Martin has a strong, fast flight interspersed with glides. It is a vocal species with a variety of sounds. It has a jingling song given in the aerial breeding display, and a number of contact calls, ''kee-r-r'', ''chee-chee'' and similar short, unmusical sounds. Flocks call together, ''cheer-cheer-cheer'', as they take to the air, and this martin is very vocal during migration, giving harsh [[gull|gull-like]] calls.<ref name = Turner/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Congo maluku.jpg|thumb|alt=large river with forested banks|Congo River near Maluku]]
The African River Martin breeds along the [[Congo River]] and its tributary, the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), an area estimated at 47,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (18,150&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>).<ref name=IUCN2012/> This part of Africa is poorly known, and this martin may also breed on other tributaries, such as the [[Kasai River|Kasai]], or on other suitable rivers. It also breeds in southern [[Gabon]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. The DRC breeding population is [[bird migration|migratory]], wintering in coastal savanna in Gabon, but it is not known if the birds nesting at the coast are a separate population, or if the migrants are breeding again in the wintering area.<ref name=IUCN2012/><ref name = Turner/><ref>{{cite journal| last = Rand | first = A L| coauthors= Friedmann, H; Traylor M A Jr |year=1959 | title= Birds from Gabon and Moyen Congo|journal= Fieldiana: Zoology|volume=41|issue=2|pages=223<U+2013>411|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/birdsfromgabonmo412rand#page/304/mode/2up/search/pseudochelidon}}</ref> Westwards migration from the DRC is from June to early September, with birds arriving at the coast from mid-August to mid-September. Return migration is mainly from December to March. Three or four birds were seen passing through the southern [[Central African Republic]] in 1994.<ref name=IUCN2012/>

This martin's breeding requirement is forested rivers with islands that have sandy banks for nest burrows,<ref name=IUCN2012/> and its habitat in the DRC is tropical forest with over 200&nbsp;cm (80&nbsp;in) of rain a year. This area is a patchwork of dry, seasonally flooded and permanently wet woodland, and seasonally flooded [[savanna]], all of which are subject to inundation by the Congo River and its tributaries. The swamp forests contain trees such as ''[[Symphonia globulifera]]'', [[Raffia palm]]s and ''[[Mitragyna]]'' species, and the riverbanks are often lined with [[arrowroot]]. This specialised habitat is shared with two other restricted-range birds, the [[Congo Sunbird]] and the [[Congo Martin]].<ref name = wwf>World Wildlife Fund; Sigsgaard, Lene; McGinley, Mark "[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Eastern_Congolian_swamp_forests Eastern Congolian swamp forests]" in Cleveland, Cutler J (ed.)

==Behaviour==
[[File:Pseudochelidoneurystominadubois.jpg|thumb|Adult (foreground) and juvenile]]
The African River Martin has flight displays in which pairs or small groups chase each other while making jingling calls. It also displays on the ground, with the wings drooped and slightly open, and the head raised but held horizontally; the function of these terrestrial displays is uncertain. This species nests in colonies in sandbanks along forested rivers from December to April when the river is low. The colonies, sometimes shared with [[Rosy Bee-eater]]s in Gabon, may contain up to 800 birds, each pair excavating a 1<U+2013>2&nbsp;m (39<U+2013>78&nbsp;in) long tunnel in the sandbar. Two to four unspotted white eggs are laid onto a few twigs and leaves in the pocket at the end of the tunnel. The eggs measure 21.9<U+2013>26.0&nbsp;x&nbsp;16.4<U+2013>18.2&nbsp;mm (0.86<U+2013>1.0&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.65<U+2013>0.72&nbsp;in). The incubation and fledging times are unknown, although it is believed that both parents care for the nestlings.<ref name = Turner/>

In the breeding areas, this martin rarely uses perches other than the ground, and once it has landed, it may walk around or cleanse itself with the sand. It feeds in flocks often far from the colony. Wintering birds use elevated perches much more readily, landing on treetops, wires and roofs, and feed in flight over rivers and forests, often far from water. The flocks feed on [[insect]]s including [[fly|flies]], small beetles and [[Hemiptera|bugs]],<ref name = Turner/> but mainly on winged [[ant]]s.<ref name= fry>{{cite journal | last= Fry | first= C H | year = 1992 | title= Myrmecophagy by ''Pseudochelidon eurystomina'' and other African birds | journal= Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club| volume= 112A | issue = | pages= 87<U+2013>97 | url = |format = | doi = }}</ref> Wintering birds dig tunnels in the sand in which to roost overnight.<ref name = Turner/>

==Status==
The total population size of the African River Martin is unknown. In the late 1980s, it appeared to be common, if local, and large numbers were seen on migration in Gabon. However, it is particularly poorly studied in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and it is not known if there is any relationship between the birds breeding in the DRC and those breeding in coastal areas of Gabon and Congo. Several hundred birds were seen at [[Conkouati-Douli National Park]] in Congo in 1996 and a flock of 15,000 birds was seen in Gabon in 1997.<ref name=IUCN2012/> Investigations in Gabon in September 2003 extended the known range of this martin.
