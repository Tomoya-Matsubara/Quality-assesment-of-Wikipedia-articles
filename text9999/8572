The following are supporting characters from the [[Japan]]ese [[console role-playing game|RPG]] '''''[[Xenogears]]'''''. Extremely minor characters are not included.

{{TOCright}}
{{spoiler}}

===Abel===
{{See also|Side Characters (Xenosaga)#Abel|Abel}}
As a young boy living in the Cosmic War era, '''Abel''' came into contact with Zohar when he accidentally stumbled upon a facility housing a Deus and Zohar connection experiment. The Wave Existence gave Abel its power so he could eventually destroy Zohar, which would free the Existence and allow it to ascend back to the higher dimension. Abel had been searching for his mother when he made contact, and his desire to be with her imparted the Existence with a mother's will when he made contact. It constructed a woman using the biological computer Kadomony, a component of the Deus system, to be with Abel, but Deus transformed the woman into the original Miang. 

Abel was the only human survivor of the Eldridge crash. Together with Elhaym, or Elly as he had come to call her, he lived during the first years of life on the Xenogears planet.  When Cain, Miang and the Gazel Ministry began forming their control mechanisms in the developing human culture, Abel and Elly, now grown adults, challenged them.  Abel, having known the truth of the matter and being the only true human on the planet, saw through Cain's lies and called him on them in front of civilization.  Cain responded by murdering both him and Elly; however, Abel and Elly were continuously reincarnated through the Zohar until 9999 years later, when [[Main Characters (Xenogears)#Fei Fong Wong|Fei Fong Wong]] and [[Main Characters (Xenogears)#Elly Van Houten|Elhaym Van Houten]] were born.  Fei is the last incarnation of Abel and the Contact, who breaks Deus' hold on humanity and frees the Wave Existence.

===Bart's crew===
*'''Falkon, Farrant, and Vind''' &mdash; three of Bart's soldiers, they accompany Fei on his mission to distract the Aveh border fleet.  Falkon, Farrant, and Vind guide Fei through the Aveh fleet to the flagship, the Kefeinzel.  They are killed by Vanderkaum, who is possessed by Grahf's powers.

*'''Franz''' &mdash; a dolphin-like demi-human who serves at the Yggdrasil's radio, radar and sonar operator.  He is capable of determining the nature of all sorts of complex and abstract noises.

*'''Jericho''' &mdash; the helmsman of the Yggdrasil, although he defers to Bart's skill as a helmsman in tricky situations.

*'''General Maitreya''' &mdash; an elite fighter and leader among Bart's sand pirates.  He leads the search for Bart and Fei after they fall into the Stalactite Cave in the Ignas desert outside of Bledavik. He also leads the distraction attack on the Aveh border fleet while Bart attempts to invade Bledavik.  He was killed by Vanderkaum after Grahf arrived and gave him "The Power".

*'''Lawrence Maison''' &mdash; Bart's elderly butler, Maison was raised in Aveh and has been part of the Fatima dynasty for many years. Earlier in his life, Maison was a knight in the service of Bart's father, King Edbart IV.  He often pilots creative but not entirely reliable inventions, like the Land Crab.  He mostly stays in the Gun Room on the Yggdrasil and has a penchant for fine tea.

===Big Joe===
'''Big Joe''' is a man who encounters the party at bizarre moments each with different roles. He is encountered at the Aveh tournament, Nortune Civil Block, Ethos HQ (as a prisoner), the air ducts of Shevat during a Solaris invasion, and the Level two area of Etrenank. In the end of the game he is both a music supplier in Nortune Battle Arena and a shop keeper in the ruins of Zeboim. Before the game, Big Joe was actually living at the Zeboim civilisation, and his real name was Joey Balboa. He was a famous man; however, he fell at a prize ceremony, received brain damage, and began to think he was Elvis. He was later locked in a nanoreactor and placed in suspended animation before Zeboim fell and woke up 4000 years later in the present day Xenogears era, still thinking he was Elvis.

===Cain===
'''Cain''' is the first human to be born on the planet, along with Miang and the Gazel Ministry. He was pre-programmed to carry out the will of Deus and constantly work towards Deus' revival.  His mind was always focused on protecting humanity until the "time of the Gospel", when Deus would be revived using all of humanity as spare parts.  He was instrumental in creating the myths, legends and religions of the world what would be used to keep humanity under his and the Ministry's control.  However, [[#Abel|Abel]] knew the truth and began to speak out to the planet's burgeoning human population against Cain and the Ministry's lies.  Cain killed Abel and the original Elly to silence them; however, the murder plagued his conscience. Consequently, he developed a guilt-driven sympathy for normal surface dwelling Humans, in effect breaking free of his programming to a degree. He served as the Emperor of Solaris and the de facto ruler of all life on the planet through a network of religious and political dummy organizations, all based out of Solaris.  

A long time after the Shevat-Solaris War, Cain reached out and contacted Krelian and Miang at the Ministry's urging.  They saw Krelian as a key asset in their grand plan, so they forged an alliance of mutual dependence with one another.  Although Cain was sincere about helping Krelian, the Ministry was not; they were looking to condemn humanity to death to fulfill Deus' resurrection. As payment for his help, Krelian performed an extensive procedure on Cain to extend his life indefinitely.  These actions, among others over the many years, caused a split between Cain, Miang, and the Ministry.  Because of what he had done to Abel and Elly, Cain was concerned for the well-being of life, the Gazel were only interested in themselves and their gain in the resurrection of Deus, and Miang was only concerned about Deus.  

Cain originally sent Citan to the surface to keep a constant vigil on Fei, Abel's reincarnated form, after he was brought to Lahan by Wiseman.  Cain and Citan communicate via a telepathic link several times over the course of the game and Citan keeps the Emperor abreast of everything happening around Fei and the party. Later in the game, he assassinated by Kharan Ramsus, a clone of Cain created by Krelian to be an artificial Contact. Ramsus was manipulated into doing so by Miang at the behest of the Ministry. Cain's death allowed Miang and the Gazel Ministry to use the Gaetia Key to raise Mahanon, the main hull of the Eldridge, from the ocean floor and turn the better majority of the world's population into Wels, who would then be absorbed into Deus to fulfill that stage of its resurrection.  Cain's face is never shown beyond his orange skull-like mask which is used to keep him alive; although Cain<U+2019>s mask was shattered by Ramsus' sword and fell off, his body is decayed.

===Contact and Antitype===
The '''Contact''' is the person, or reincarnation of the person, who makes contact with the [[List of Xenogears terms#Zohar|Zohar]] and the [[Supporting Characters (Xenogears)#W|Wave Existence]].  The Contact is the only person with the power to destroy both [[Supporting Characters (Xenogears)#D|Deus]] and the Zohar and thus free the Wave Existence from its "corporeal prison" and allow it to ascend back to the higher dimension whence it came. Both Contact and '''Antitype''' are needed to establish a perfect Contact, which is one of the reasons Elly was created. The first Contact was Abel, who made contact with the Wave Existence and the Zohar shortly before the Eldridge crashed.  From there, the Contact, and the corresponding Antitype (Elly), have been reborn as a distinct new person in every generation, yet still looking exactly like the original Contact Abel.  

Known Contacts throughout history have included [[#Kim Kasim|Kim Kasim]], [[#Lacan|Lacan]], and protagonist [[Fei Fong Wong]].  A Contact can use the power of the Zohar at will.  Each Contact throughout history is born with the memories or knowledge of the previous Contact who existed before him.  [[Grahf]] was an '''Imperfect Contact'''; when he found the Zohar, the corresponding Antitype (Sophia/Elly) had already died.  [[Kahran Ramsus]] was an Artificial Contact created by [[Krelian]] with the intent of using him in his plan in Fei's place for his own, personal spin on Project Noah; however, when Fei was discovered, Ramsus was simply disposed of.

===Deus===
The physical aspect of '''Deus''' is part of the Yaweh (see [[Yahweh]]) interplanetary invasion system, along with the Zohar.  Created by an ancient civilization (20xx A.D. , when the Zohar was discovered on Earth), it was coupled with the Zohar to become a tool of unprecedented destruction.  However, its ambition grew out of control and it was disassembled and placed within the Eldridge for removal.  It took over the ship and crashed on the planet where Xenogears takes place, sustaining heavy damage.  To repair this damage, it activated Kadamony, its repair system.  Kadamony created a race of people which would one day revive it.  It is the objective of the Gazel Ministry, Miang, and (initially) Emperor Cain to restore Deus by changing all humans into Wels, which the Deus would absorb.  The name [[Deus]] comes from the [[Latin]] word for "god", as in "[[Deus ex Machina]]" ("God From Machine).

===Elements===
The Elements are a series of Solarian [[Super Soldier]]s, who have a high Ether competency, allowing them to master one of the [[natural element]]s. In ''Xenogears'', they are appointed by Kahran Ramsus.

*'''Dominia Yizkor''' &mdash; the Earth Element, she has a crush on Ramsus and a strong rivalry with Kelvena and Miang.  Dominia's pointy ears and muscular physique betray her status as a demi-human. She is a survivor of the Elru massacre, which was initiated by Id. As such, she has the ability to harness and make use of her emotions to amplify her existing strength. She was saved from being processed in the [[Soylent green|Soylent System]] by Krelian and made into an Element. Dominia pilots the humanoid gear Bladegash, which combines with the other three Element gears to form the massive G-Elements. Dominia's name is similar to the [[Dominion (angel)|Dominion]], an Order of Angels in the Second Hierarchy.

*'''Kelvena''' &mdash; the calm and thoughtful Water Element. While not always very assertive, Kelvena assumes the role of quiet advisor to Dominia during their missions. She is employed by the Intelligence Bureau, and is the leader among the forces associated with the element 'Water'. Her ether potential is so great she is forced to keep her eyes closed to fully control it. In her Jugend days, Kel's life was moderately normal. She and Elly roomed together - like Hyuga and Sigurd - and became very close friends, even when they were both set up to be chosen as Elements. Other than this, no previous connection with Ramsus is mentioned. Kelvena pilots the dolphin-like gear Marinebasher, which combines with the other three Element gears to form the massive G-Elements. Kelvena's name is derived from the [[Cherubim]], an Order of Angels in the First Hierarchy.

*'''Tolone''' - the Wind Element, she is logical and emotionless, with a [[cybernetic]] brain and other robotic implants. She is seen in battle pulling her arm off at the elbow in battle to reveal a powerful laser weapon hidden within her biceps region.  She was saved from being processed in the [[Soylent green|Soylent System]] by Ramsus and made into an Element.  Tolone pilots the bird-like gear Skyghene, which combines with the other three Element gears to form the massive G-Elements. Her name is derived from the [[Thrones]], an Order of Angels in the First Hierarchy.

*'''Seraphita''' - the Fire Element, and a source of comic relief. She is often partnered up with Tolone, her polar opposite.  Seraphita appears to be a demi-human and had rabbit-like ears and a fluffy rabbit tail.  Sera, as she is referred to by her fellow Elements, is normally sent out when extra power is needed, otherwise Domina and Kelvena normally handle all the assignments.  She was saved from being processed in the [[Soylent green|Soylent System]] by Ramsus and made into an Element.  Seraphita pilots the Grandgrowl, a gear that looks like a winged lion.  Together with the other three Element gears it combines to form the massive G-Elements. Seraphita's name is derived from the [[Seraphim]], an Order of Angels in the First Hierarchy.

===Elly's squad===
Elly's five elite Gebler soldiers. In the second disc of the game, Renk and his fellow soldiers become allies of Fei and Elly; they even offered to help Elly when she confronted Krelian and Miang at Golgoda, but Elly told them to stay behind and protect the people of Nisan.  The five disappear after that point and are not seen again.

*'''Renk''' - a dark skinned man with red hair and a short beard, who sees Fei as a rival competitor instead of an enemy.  Despite his rank, his opinions hold considerable weight within the group. Renk pilots one of the two beam-gun wielding winged Wandknight gears.

*'''Stratski''' - a man with long light green hair, he is the quietest of the five. He pilots the Swordknight gear.

*'''Broyer''' - a quiet, large man with dark skin and short blue hair. He pilots the Aegisknight gear.

*'''Vance''' - A cocky man with short wavy brown hair.  He is the most combative and violent of the five and also appears to be addicted to the Solarian performance enhancing psychotic drug, Drive. He pilots the Clawknight gear.

*'''Helmholz''' - a modest intellectual man with short purple hair and glasses.  He helps defend the city of Nisan from his former commander, Ramsus, when he comes in search for Elly.  Helmholz pilots the second of two Wandknight gears.

===Erich===
'''Erich Van Houten''', a Solarian with short blond hair and a mustache, is Elly's father.  After serving with Gebler, he was reassigned as the head of the [[Soylent Green|Soylent]] System, where he saved many surface dwellers ("Lambs") from becoming Wels and later food and medicine for Solaris.  Elly's childhood nanny was one of these rescued Lambs.  He is first seen in Solaris after Elly hacks into his home computer to download information that will help the party. Erich wants to kill Fei, but Elly convinces him otherwise and he lets him go.  He is later arrested by the Imperial Guard when he refuses Krelian's request to hand Elly over.  He is later sprung from prison by Hammer and commandeers a Solarian Eagle soldier gear to help Elly, Fei and everyone else escape from Solaris.  However, Hammer turns on the group and threatens them at gunpoint, while Grahf and the Executioner (Miang) appear.  To protect his daughter, Erich sacrifices himself by charging them with his gear; Miang completely obliterates his gear, killing Erich instantly.

===Gaspar===
'''Gaspar Uzuki''' is of the three Sages of Shevat and the grandfather of Yui Uzuki.  He is seen as an old man with a thick grey beard, a long pointy nose and a mechanical jaw enhancement.  He is more than 500 years old; his life has been extended indefinitely through nanomachines by Krelian as a means of "punishment".  He was once an expert swordsman and taught the art to Yui and her husband, Solarian Guardian Angel Hyuga Ricdeau (later Citan Uzuki).  He was one of Queen Zephyr's main supporters before she ascended the throne of Shevat, and was the only Sage who did not leave Shevat for the surface world.  Eventually, he does go to the surface to help the other two Sages, Taura Melchior and Isaac Balthasar reconstruct Fei's nearly destroyed Gear Weltall. He shares his name with the Guru of Time, Gaspar, from [[Chrono Trigger]].  He is also named after one of the three magi in the New Testament.

===Gazel Ministry===
The '''Gazel Ministry''' is the [[ministry (government department)|government department]] that controls Solaris.  The twelve members of the ministry, along with Cain and Elly, were the first humans to be created by Kadmony (a part of Deus) following the Eldridge crash.  They helped orchestrate the balance of power to start Project Noah, the plan to resurrect Deus. Their manipulation is extensive, including the Zeboim nuclear war, the destruction of multiple nations, and the Ignas civil war between Aveh and Kislev.  They also influenced the struggle between Solaris and Shevat 500 years before the destruction of Deus; around this time, the Ministers were killed, and Krelian placed the bodies of eight of them inside of the SOL-9000.  The Gazel Ministry remained in the SOL-9000 until they were deleted by Krelian. With the Gaetia Key being used by the Ministry, Krelian no longer had any use for them.  Krelian then took complete control of Project Noah for his own motives.  According to Perfect Works, the names of eight of them are Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methushael, Lamech, Jabal, Jubal and Tubal Cain.

===Grahf===
Calling himself "The Seeker of Power", '''Grahf''' is the persona of Lacan that split off after Lacan made contact with the Zohar five hundred years before the start of ''Xenogears''.  Grahf is the personification of Lacan's will, but is not considered to be the "original" Lacan (i.e. the Contact).  The Contact, instead, was reborn in the body of Fei; therefore, Grahf's goal is to merge back with the Contact, awaken the weapon Deus, and destroy all life.  He came to the conclusion that this was the only path to freedom after his contact with the Existence as Lacan.  Grahf learned the ability to pass on from body to body, thus granting him a form of eternal life.

Grahf discovers the new incarnation of the Contact in Fei when Fei is still a child, and attempts to meld with him.  However, Fei's father, Kahn, attempts to stop him.  During their battle, Fei was unable to contain the powers passed onto him by the Existence and released a force so powerful that both Grahf and Fei's mother were killed.  Grahf then passed into the body of Kahn, thus forming a relationship very similar to that of Fei and Id. The other version of Kahn became the Wiseman. Like Id, Grahf possesses immense strength; however, he rarely fights directly, and instead grants what he calls "the Power" to defeated lesser villains, allowing them to challenge Fei again with enhanced abilities. This power invariably leads to madness, and their resulting destruction.

===Hammer===
'''Hammer''' is a demi-human merchant from the D Block of Nortune; like all other demi-humans, he was imprisoned in D Block because of Kaiser Sigmund's harsh anti-demi-human laws and policies. Hammer befriends the party and aids them in certain situations.  He even goes with them to Solaris; however, Krelian promises him a great reward if he can bring Elly back to him.  During the escape from Solaris, Hammer surprises the party when he pulls a gun on Elly and demands that she return with him back to Etrenank.  Elly's mother, Medena, steps in front of the gun; after repeated orders to move out of his way, Hammer shoots her in the head.  When the party escapes Solaris, Hammer stays behind with Krelian at his lab, where he is surgically grafted into the structure of a massive Wel-Gear. In the second disk of the game, he is instructed by Krelian to destroy the party at the second Anima dungeon and again return Elly to him.  After being defeated by the party, Hammer apologizes to Elly, who forgives him.  Hammer dies when his Wel-Gear falls into a massive ravine and self-destructed.

===Id===
'''Id''', a form of the subconscious mind according to psychologist Sigmund Freud, is Fei's destructive side.  This coincides with Freud's principle of the "Id" versus the "Super-ego" (see: [[Ego, super-ego, and id]]).  The Id is the "instinct" side of the subconscious: it craves self-gratification.  The Super-ego, in turn, is the logical and less instinctual side.  Moreover, the Ego is the side that decides the balance between the Id and the Super-ego.  In this case, Fei is the Super-ego.  Id wants to destroy everything and cause chaos, while Fei's Super-ego side is stable and peaceful.  The third, recessive persona existed as a catalyst and the balance between the two: the Coward, which is a representation of the aforementioned "Ego" in Freudian psychology.  In Fei's case, this falls under Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), also known as Multiple Personality Disorder. When Id asserts himself, Fei's hair, eyes, and skin change color.

The seeds of Id were planted because of the trauma that Fei suffered as a child at the hands of his mother, Karen Wong.  As a small boy, Karen was possessed by Miang. Fei was taken to testing labs and hurt mentally and physically.  When he dissociates, he becomes insane, destructive, and extremely powerful.  Because of this, Fei was indirectly responsible for his mother's death, as well as the destruction of Lahan Village.  Also, there is a scene in "Xenogears" where Fei sees into his subconscious mind.  He sees the "Coward" personality, and the "Id" personality.  The Coward and Id walk off, then Id says to Fei, "Sorry, but you can't come". Whenever Id surfaces, Fei's Gear Weltall transforms into Weltall-Id, a blood red Gear of incredible power.

===Isaac===
'''Isaac [[Balthasar]]''', also known as Old Man Bal, is one of the three Sages of Shevat and an advisor to Queen Zephyr.  He has been alive for more than 500 years because his life has been artificially extended by regenerative nanomachines as "punishment" by Krelian.  Old Man Bal is the father of Solarian gear designer Nikolai Balthazar, and grandfather of Shevat operative Maria Balthazar.  He can identify the status of a gear by listening to the noises it makes.  When Fei and Bart stumble across his hermitage in the Stalactite Cave, he shows them the way back to the surface and repairs their damaged gears, but he becomes suspicious when he examines the mysterious [[black box]] parts in Fei's gear Weltall.  Thinking Fei to be the "Slayer of God", he sends his massive remote controlled gear Calamity after him and Bart.  Old Man Bal appears again in disc two to help rebuild and remodel Weltall after it was destroyed by Ramsus' Omnigear, Vendetta.  After he is assured that Fei is not an unstable threat, Isaac helps create Weltall 2 along with the other Sages of Shevat, Taura Melchior and Gaspar Uzuki. His name is the same as the Guru of Reason, Belthasar, from [[Chrono Trigger]].

===Jesse Black===
'''Jesse Black''' is the father of Billy Lee Black and Primera, and is nicknamed '''Jessiah'''.  A gruff and rash gun-wielding ex-Element of Solaris, he was once good friends with his fellow ex-Elements: Sigurd, Citan, and Ramsus.  Ramsus was even willing to practically let him walk in and destroy the Etrenank Gate in Solaris.  He was once the commander of Gebler before Ramsus, but he left the position to head down to the surface with his wife Racquel.  Jessiah had a heated rivalry with fellow Solarian soldier Isaac Stein (Later Ethos Bishop Isaac Stone), and it drove Stein mad. Jesse suffered Stein's eventual wrath when he followed him to the surface and used Wels to brutally murder Racquel, then swooped in under the guise of the benevolent Bishop Stone of the Ethos and consoled his children and turned Billy against his father. Hated by his children at first, Jesse ends up saving the protagonists throughout the story. He had his face surgically altered to mimic the appearance of a deceased old friend from Shevat, Joshua Blanche. 

Jesse enters the game by pointing his shotgun at Elly's head when he thinks she is trying to abduct Primera on the Thames.  When Jesse's past and the truth about the Ethos church are explored, Billy comes to the realization that his father was right in his own way.  Jesse and Billy reconcile their differences after defeating Bishop Stone once and for all. Billy's new mission, stopping Krelian, Miang, and the Gazel Ministry's plot to kill off all humanity to revive Deus drew them away from one another.  Moreover, Jesse is absent from disc 2 of the game.

===Kahn Wong===
'''Kahn Wong''' is a martial arts master and the father of Fei Fong Wong.  He was an operative from Shevat who married a surface dweller named Karen and had a son named Fei.  Kahn's duties to Shevat kept him away from his family often, so he was unaware that while he was gone, his wife, who was actually Miang in Karen's body, was performing ghastly experiments on Fei with the help of Krelian to bring out his powers as the Contact.  Kahn had no idea that Fei had also developed two split personalities because of these treatments.  By that time, Grahf had become aware of Fei's existence and had come seeking him out to inhabit his body and complete the transmigration circle that he started when he was Lacan, the previous Contact.  Id awakened within Fei when Grahf appeared before him and Id used Fei's immense powers as a Contact to severely injure Grahf and protect himself, but also killed his mother Karen in the process.  Kahn took Fei away and began travelling with him, always trying to keep one step ahead of Grahf, who was tirelessly searching for them.  Along the way, Kahn taught Fei everything he knew about the martial arts.  Grahf eventually found them, and when Fei turned into Id again, Grahf took control of him.  Kahn followed them for three years as Grahf turned Id loose on places like Elru to cause chaos and destruction, thereby strengthening Id's powers.  Kahn eventually caught up with them, defeated Grahf, and turned Id back into Fei; however, before Grahf "died", he transmigrated into Kahn's body.  Kahn's strong mind and will could only keep Grahf at bay for a short time, so he assumed the guise of Wiseman and took Fei to the remote village of Lahan.

Over the course of Fei's adventure, Kahn can temporarily wrest control of his body away from Grahf and appear to Fei as Wiseman to give him help advice.  Fei eventually learns through Id that Kahn is Wiseman.  When Fei tries to reunite with his father, Grahf takes control once more and reveals to Fei that not only is he his father, but he is also his most dangerous enemy.  When Fei and his friends finally defeat Grahf, he sacrifices himself to temporarily knock out the Zohar, which is powering Deus.  All four personas perish when his gear self-destructs.

===Karen===
'''Karen Wong''' is a surface dweller who married a man from Shevat named Kahn Wong and had a son named Fei.  At some point during her life, Karen's body was taken over by Miang, who had awakened in her when the previous Miang died.  Miang discovered that the son produced by her host's marriage to Kahn was actually the Contact, the reincarnation of Abel.  While her husband was away on missions for Shevat, Karen took Fei to Krelian's laboratories onboard the Ezekiel, where she and Krelian performed horrible and intrusive experiments on him to validate him as the Contact and bring out his powers.  What Miang was unaware of was that these experiments had fractured Fei's psyche and caused him to create three separate personas: his own "normal" self, the violent and anger-driven Id, and the repressive and recessive Coward.  

Grahf showed up at the Wong home after becoming aware of Fei's existence as the Contact.  Grahf was seeking to inhabit Fei's body, but the other parts of Fei's psyche had other plans. Before Grahf could transmigrate into Fei's body, Id took over and used part of Fei's power as the Contact to obliterate everything in the surrounding area.  Grahf was seriously wounded and driven off, and Karen was killed by the blast.  In her last moments, either Miang abandoned Karen's body, or Karen summoned the will to take control back from Miang and threw herself in front of a blast of energy that had circled back around and was coming back at Fei.  The last thing Fei saw of his mother was a relieved smile when she realised that she had saved her son from certain death before she died.  Karen appeared to be a follower of the Nisan church, as she always wore a pendant of the Nisan cross around her neck, even when she was Miang.  Fei inherited this pendant from his mother and it brings up memories of her in his mind when he sees it or thinks about it; this is the pendant that swings across a black screen during certain flashbacks.

===Kim===
'''Kim Kasim''' was a brilliant doctor and scientist in the field of Nanotechnology during the Zeboim era. He is considered the creator of the Nanotechnology later developed by Krelian and his mentor, Shevat Sage Taura Melchior. Driven by his wife Elly's inability to give birth due to the expanding radioactive poisoning, he allied himself with the Ravine rebel group to sponsor his studies in Molecular Machinery, thus creating Emeralda, who he considered a surrogate daughter.  He was assassinated alongside Elly by the Zeboim Militia, and Emeralda was deconstructed and sealed on the orders of the Zeboim First Lady, Miang.  Kim was the first known reincarnation of Abel the Contact, and his wife Elly was the first known reincarnation of the original Elhaym.

===Lacan===
Once a humble painter from Nisan, '''Lacan''' was the third known incarnation of Abel the Contact.  Lacan was a close friend of Sophia, the Holy Mother of Nisan 500 years before the start of ''Xenogears''.  He had known her since she was a child and was one of the few people to know her by her given name, Elhaym, or Elly.  Lacan was also good friends with Roni and Rene Fatima and Krelian of Nimrod.  When he was commissioned to paint Sophia's portrait, he was initially hesitant and felt he was not good enough to do the job.  Lacan loved Sophia very dearly but did not know how to express it, so he purposefully painted her portrait very slowly just so he could spend more time with her as she modeled for it.  He was so deliberately slow that he never managed to finish it completely before the Shevat-Solaris War broke out. When Sophia sacrificed herself at the end of the war without Lacan expressing his love, it devastated him.  He was plagued by issues of self-weakness, which developed into a hunger for power. His weakness, he felt, lead to Sophia's death and he never wanted to be weak again.  

His subsequent quest for power eventually crossed his path with Miang, who was inhabiting the body of a Solarian soldier imprisoned in Shevat after the Gazel Ministry handed her over to the Shevat government (in exchange for Sophia), citing her as the source of the war.  Miang played on his hunger for power and told him about the source of ultimate power on the planet, the Zohar.  Following Miang's instructions, Lacan found the Zohar and made an imperfect contact with it, thereby gaining significant power. He learned of his past lives, and his role as the Contact; however, what he learned destroyed him. In all his "lives", Elly died protecting him, and the realization that she would always die to save him broke him. He left the name Lacan behind and became Grahf, the ''Seeker of Power''.  He then found the resting place of the legendary Diabolos Gears, autonomous angelic gears of incredible power.  He claimed one of them, the original or "True" Weltall, as his own, and the rest became his army.  He turned the Diabolos on both Shevat and Solaris, and in a single day, he nearly decimated both aerial nations.  He killed the twelve members of the Gazel Ministry along with Rene Fatima; however, at the end of the battle, which became known as the "Day of Destruction", the Diabolos were defeated by the surface dwellers led by Roni Fatima, and Grahf was driven off.  

Lacan survived for more than 500 years as Grahf by transmigrating his soul into other peoples' bodies and taking them over.  Grahf's last host before his ultimate demise was Kahn Wong, the father of Fei Fong Wong, the fourth incarnation of Abel the Contact and the man Lacan was looking to transmigrate into all along.  Lacan eventually died with the Grahf persona and Kahn, when he latched onto the Zohar with his gear and initiated a self-destruct.  The resulting explosion neutralized the function of the Zohar long enough to allow Fei and his companions to stop Krelian and Deus and rescue Elly. Krelian refers to Fei as Lacan, a name that only bears relevance to Fei at the end of the game, when he obtains the memories of all of his past lives.

===Lahan Village residents===
*'''Chief Lee''' &mdash; the wise elder of the village, he was the man to whom Wiseman, otherwise known as Kahn Wong, brought his son Fei.  Lee helped Fei recover and raised him like a son.  He would have approved of Fei marrying Alice; however, Fei was not from Lahan, so he was not permitted to marry anyone from Lahan because of a strict tradition.  After Id's attack on Lahan Village, Chief Lee is never seen again.
*'''Alice''' &mdash; a young woman and the older sister of Dan. She is engaged to Timothy, another Lahan citizen and Fei's best friend. However, she harbors romantic feelings for Fei, and expresses some regret that she could not marry Fei due to village traditions. She is killed in the Lahan village incident along with Timothy and a large portion of the village.
*'''Dan''' &mdash; a mischievous young boy.  When his older sister, Alice, dies in the Lahan incident, he blames it on Fei.  From that day forward, Dan becomes Fei's rival, even challenging him at the Aveh tournament.  Once the truth behind Fei's Id form is revealed, Dan forgives him.
*'''Lucca''' &mdash; a character who provides Fei with useful advice before the destruction of the village.  Like many characters in the game, she shares her name with [[Lucaa (Chrono Trigger)|Lucca]], a main character from ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''.
*'''Timothy''' &mdash; Fei's closest friend in Lahan village, and the fiancee of Alice.  However, when Gebler attacked Lahan, Timothy was killed.  When this happened, Fei grew upset, briefly morphed into Id, and destroyed the village.

===Margie===
'''Marguerite Fatima''' is Bart's first cousin and the reigning Mother of Nisan. Her parents, Elvira and Francis Fatima, Holy Mother and Bishop respectively, were murdered in Shakhan's quest for the Fatima Jasper, and Margie was forced to take her mother's place at the age of ten. Although she acts childish, she is a brave and responsible girl. During the coup, Margie and Bart were both imprisoned and interrogated by Shakhan, but they never broke. Maison saved both of them, and Margie was returned to Nisan. She leaves again later and Shakhan recaptures her, but Bart saves her. Bart and Margie have an arranged marriage.  They are also the last living descendants of their lineage.

===Medena===
'''Medena Van Houten''' is Elly's blond-haired mother.  Elly is resentful of her at first and does not believe she is her real mother.  Elly believes her mother was actually a Lamb, perhaps even her childhood nanny.  Medena is a genuinely sweet person and seems to be supportive of Elly's budding relationship with Fei once she gets over her initial shock of discovering the relationship.  Medena is imprisoned with her husband when the Imperial Guard comes looking for Elly on Krelian's orders.  She is eventually rescued by Hammer; however, he also turns on the group and tries to take Elly to Krelian.  Medena steps in between Elly and Hammer, and Hammer shoots her in the head when she refuses to move.

===Melchior===
Like Gaspar, '''Melchior''' is one of the few Krelian "punished" with eternal life. He was an advisor and sage to Shevat before Queen Zephyr's time, and he stood behind her in her bid for the throne five hundred years before the start of ''Xenogears''. During the Solaris War, he worked with Krelian to bring nanotechnology back into the world; after Sophia's death and Krelian's desertion, he went into hiding and continued his research alone. Melchior has no known family and only minimal contact with Shevat. He prefers to conduct his research in remote areas, and in the game he can be found deep in the forests of the Elru continent. He shares his name with the Guru of Life, Melchior, from [[Chrono Trigger]].

===Midori===
'''Midori Uzuki''' is the only child of Citan and Yui Uzuki and Gaspar Uzuki's granddaughter.  She is a very quiet young girl and does not speak a word of dialogue until disc two.  She appears to have some kind of empathic extrasensory abilities that allow her to tell what people are thinking just by being in their presence. Midori's name is [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for the color green, which is the color of Citan's clothes and Gears.

===Mugwort and Rattan===
'''Mugwort''' and '''Rattan''' were Wel-Gear combinations created by Krelian before the start of the game. Mugwort's gear appears to be an orange roughly humanoid gear with a massive spiked ball on one arm and a long shield on the other, and '''Rattan''' is encased inside the massive chassis of a bird-like green gear with four insectoid legs and a pair of sharp blades on one side of its body. Mugwort and Rattan first appear while accompanying Emerelda to the Sargasso Gate to mount a feigned defence against Fei and the others. They also appear at Golgoda and fight Elly, who kills them with her gear.

===Nikolai===
'''Nikolai Balthasar''' is a brilliant Solarian who was once from Shevat, and the father of Maria.  After being captured and brainwashed by Solaris, he often experimented with gears and humans in the Soylent System.  Eventually, he created a gear that could easily merge with human thought, which practically destroyed his existence.  He comes back when Maria and Chu-Chu attack the gear, and makes peace with his daughter before killing himself.

===Primera===
Billy Lee Black's young sister, '''Primera''' is silent for most of the game.  She stopped talking after she and her older brother Billy witnessed their mother's murder at the hands of the Reapers, or Wels.  She finally starts talking again after witnessing the heroics of her father, Jesse Black, and her brother as they defeat Bishop Stone.

===Racquel===
'''Racquel Black''' is Jesse's wife and Billy and Primera's mother.  She was a young Solarian woman attending the Jugend military academy and vying to become an Element.  She was also the object of affection for two other Jugend recruits, Jessiah Black and Isaac Stein.  Jessiah won her heart and it enraged Stein to no end.  Racquel and Jessiah later abandoned Solaris and moved to the surface to raise a family.  They settled in the Aquvy region on an island close to the Ethos Headquarters.  Stein, who had become a Bishop in the Ethos church under the assumed name of Stone, eventually tracked them down and sent a group of Wels, who the Ethos controlled, to murder Racquel.  Stone's rationale for doing this was that Jesse had "tainted" her and she needed to be killed for her own good.  The Black children were affected by the murder in profound ways.  Billy joined the Ethos, whose lower members fought the same Wels that its higher members secretly control, and also caused him to develop a hatred of his father who was not there to protect his mother.  The event also caused Primera, who was a toddler at the time, to stop speaking completely.

===Rene===
'''Rene Fatima''' is Roni Fatima's brother and the ancestor of Bart and the other members of the Fatima dynasty. Rene shared little resemblance with Roni aside from his jasper blue eyes.  He was a strong ally of Sophia, the Holy Mother of Nisan; Lacan, the painter; Krelian, the Nanoscientist from Nimrod; and Zephyr, the child-queen of Shevat.  He supported Nisan and Shevat in their war against Solaris.  Rene was ultimately killed by the angelic autonomous gears that Lacan released from a 9000 year slumber.

===Roni===
'''Roni Fatima''' is Rene Fatima's brother and the ancestor of the Fatima dynasty, whose members include Bart, Sigurd and Margie. He was man with long blond hair and blue eyes. He was an ally of Sophia, Lacan, Zephyr and Krelian, and he fought in the Shevat-Solaris War.  He also helped defend Ignas against the invasion of the Diabolos Gears after Lacan was driven insane by the loss of Sophia and became Grafh.  He was the original pilot of the Omnigear Andvari and creator of the Yggdrasil series.  Roni created the desert kingdom of Aveh and become its first king.

===Shakhan===
The figurehead leader of Aveh, ''''Shakhan''' is a greedy Solarian who became a cardinal in the false Ethos organization. Using his power, Shakhan overthrew the Fatima dynasty and had King Edbart Fatima, Bart's father, killed to take over Aveh. He then brought in the Gebler forces from Solaris to maintain his rule as the new self-proclaimed Prime Minister of Aveh. However, he was merely a pawn; Shakhan played figurehead while Solaris practically ran the country and Gebler did as they pleased through Aveh, like heating up the ongoing war with the neighboring Kislev Empire. Shakhan was given his false power to allow Solaris to progress Project Noah. After Aveh falls to Bart, Shakhan attempts to claim vengeance by defending the Ignas Gate near Nisan. He is killed in the battle, even after receiving "The Power" from Grahf.

===Sigmund===
'''Sigmund''', the Kaiser of Kislev, is a bearded old man who usually wears red and black robes. Before Sigmund came to power, the Ethos held great influence in Kislev, so when Sigmund kicked everyone involved with the Ethos out of the government and severed all ties with the false church, it created animosity between the Kaiser and the clergy.  The Ethos responded to Sigmund's house cleaning by kidnaping his only son, [[Main Characters (Xenogears)#Rico Banderas|Ricardo "Rico" Banderas]], and sending him to Solaris, where he was turned into a demi-human.  The Kaiser and his wife thought their son was dead and Sigmund's wife herself died soon thereafter, succumbing to overwhelming grief. Sigmund began enacting all sorts of anti-demi-human laws and legislations that made life extremely hard on the demi-human population of Kislev, including Rico, who had been returned to Nortune and placed in the care of a foster mother.  Rico, now a grown man, was so infuriated by the Kaiser's policies that he tried to assassinate or otherwise harm him physically several times, not knowing that the Kaiser was his father nor was Sigmund aware that his attempted killer was his own son.  Even when Sigmund realises that Rico is actually his son, he still orders his execution after Rico again tries to kill the Kaiser.  The Kaiser openly associates with Grahf and his representative, the Executioner (Miang).  Grahf often brings the Kaiser items and technology from Solaris, like Weltall and a Gate Keeper device.

===Sigurd Harcourt===
'''Sigurd''' was born in the remote Aveh province of Norn, to Shalimar Harcourt and Edbart Fatima. He is the product of an affair between the two, and while his mother made sure he knew exactly who his family was, he was kept in Noln to protect both Sigurd and his father. When he was eleven, his mother sent him to Bledavik to work in the palace, and made him promise not to reveal his identity to the king. She died after he left, but he kept his vow. Edbart seemed to know the truth, but never said anything. When he was thirteen, Sigurd was kidnapped and taken to Solaris as a sample, presumably a representative of Norn. He and Midori are the only known characters in the game with extra-sensory abilities. When he was fifteen, they handed him over to Jugend, freshly brainwashed and ready to be trained. At Jugend, Sigurd was a cadet with [[Ramsus|Kahran Ramsus]], [[Miang|Miang Hawwa]], [[Main Characters (Xenogears)#Citan Uzuki|Hyuga Ricdeau (Citan Uzuki)]], [[Supporting characters of Xenogears#Jesse Black|Jessiah "Jesse" Black]], and [[Supporting characters of Xenogears#Stone|Isaac Stein (Bishop Stone)]]. He was also an honors student; when he graduated, he joined Jesiah's new group and became the Fire Element. 

A year later, Solaris' brainwashing wore off, and Sigurd planned to return home. Ramsus failed to keep the promises Sigurd thought he had made, and Shakhan's faction had overthrown the Fatima dynasty at Aveh. Despite being an outsider with his own family in Bledavik, he was very loyal to the Fatimas. He left Ramsus and the others behind, and arrived in Aveh in time to help Maison rescue Bart and Margie from Shakhan. From that point forward, Sigurd dedicated his life to protecting Bart and Margie, teaching the young prince what he would need to know to rule. His intention was to restore Bart to the throne someday.  He keeps his past and his identity a secret from Bart, but his loyalty is unquestionable. Sig and Bart each lost one eye in an accident on the Yggdrasil a few years before the game.  He also acts as the right-hand man to [[Main Characters (Xenogears)#Bartholomew "Bart" Fatima|Bart Fatima]] aboard the [[Gears and Vehicles (Xenogears)#Yggdrasil IV|Yggdrasil IV]].

===Sister Agnes===
'''Sister Agnes''' is the most senior member in the hierarchy of the Nisan Church after Marguerite Fatima, the Holy Mother of Nisan.  She took care of Margie and her cousin [[Main Characters (Xenogears)#Bart Fatima|Prince Bartholomew Fatima]] (Bart) after their parents, Holy Mother Elvira and Bishop Francis Fatima, and King Edbart Fatima IV and Queen Mariel Fatima respectively, were killed by Shakhan's minions during his "revolution".

===Sophia===
'''Sophia''', the Mother of Nisan 500 years before the game, is the third known reincarnation of the original Elly, the Antitype. There was a deep relationship between Sophia, Lacan, and Krelian. Sophia and Lacan had feelings for each other, but never directly expressed it to each other. Krelian was friends with both of them, but was sometimes trying to flirt with Sophia, and knew that she did not like him that much. After the war, Sophia crashed the airship into Merkava. This led Krelian down a path of despair and Lacan to seek power, turning him into Grahf.

===Stone===
'''Bishop Stone''' of the Ethos Church was once known as '''Isaac Stein''', a man from Solaris.  He was a cadet at the Jugend Military Academy in Etrnenak along with [[Ramsus|Kahran Ramsus]], [[Miang|Miang Hawwa]], [[Main Characters (Xenogears)#Citan Uzuki|Hyuga Ricdeau (Citan Uzuki)]], his personal rival [[Supporting Characters (Xenogears)#Jesse|Jessiah "Jesse" Black]], and the love of his life, [[Supporting Characters (Xenogears)#Racquel|Racquel Black]].  Stein's love for Racquel was as intense as his hatred for Jessiah, who he saw as his rival.  Stein was passed up for opportunities because Jessiah was always performing slightly better. Additionally, in Stein's mind at least, Racquel chose Jessiah over him while Stein was tossed aside.  Suffering rejection after rejection, Stein became very bitter and vengeful at his rival Jessiah, who he saw as the cause of all his misery.  When Jessiah, now going by the assumed name of Jesse, moved down to the surface to start a family, Stein followed him looking for revenge.  He joined the Solarian-run false church known as the Ethos Society; he rapidly became a Bishop in the church under the assumed name of Isaac '''Stone'''.  

Stone formulated a plan designed to strike back at Jesse through the Black family.  He sent the Wels, who were produced and controlled by the Ethos leaders, out to Jesse's house to murder Racquel.  He had no qualms about doing in his former object of affection, because in his mind she became 'tainted' when she chose Jesse over him.  After the Wels murdered Racquel, Stone swooped in and was the first one to befriend and console Jesse's children, Billy Lee and Primera.  Using his position as a supposed religious man and a trusted authority figure, he convinced Billy that Jesse was to blame for his mother's death; Billy was inclined to believe him.  He fell for Stone's manipulation and began hating his father while believing everything Bishop told him.  Stone convinced Billy to become an Etone, a member of the church who defends the people of the world against the same Wels that Stone sends out after them.  It only came out years later that Stone was a manipulator.  It broke Billy's heart to learn that Stone never actually cared for him and just used him to strike back at his father.  When Stone's treachery is revealed, he returns to Solaris to seek Krelian's help. Krelian surgically grafted him to the massive Gear, Alkanshel, secretly stored under the Ethos HQ.  He confronts Billy and his new companions in it, but after he is defeated once, he is approached by Grahf, who offers him "the Power".  Stone accepts and Grahf powers up Alkanshel.  Jesse appears and helps Billy destroy the Alkanshel and kill Stone.

===Thames crew===
*'''Captain''' &mdash; a demi-human similar to Franz from the Yggdrasil. He looks like a humanoid walrus in a naval uniform and frequently smokes a large pipe. He is known for his "Men of the Sea" code that he lives by, which is somewhat similar to [[bushido]]. When Deus' awakening caused the Thames to sink, the Captain supposedly went down with the ship.  However, he soon reappears in the ruins of Shevat.
*'''Hans''' &mdash; the dolphin-like demi-human who serves as the radio operator and first officer of the city-ship Thames. After the Thames is sunk during the second disc by the Seraphs, Hans moves to the grounded remains of Shevat with his wife Anna and son Lance.

===Vanderkaum===
'''Vanderkaum''' is an elite Solarian who was the commander of the surface Gebler forces until the arrival of Ramsus.  He is bald, with a purple cross on his face.  His tactical skills favor large weapons over gears; consequently, his sand cruiser, the Kefienzel, is destroyed. His Gear, Dora, was granted power by Grahf, causing Fei's Id to emerge and destroy Vanderkaum. Another character named Vanderkaum also appears in ''[[Xenosaga]]''.

===Wave Existence===
The '''Wave Existence''' is a being from a higher dimension.  It appears as a glowing human silhouette to Fei's eyes. The Existence was trapped inside Zohar during the initial test of the Deus System. It is responsible for the energy that powers the Gears and people's ether abilities, which is why the Zohar appeared to be the main source of power. The Wave Existence used the Contact, in the form of Fei Fong Wong, to free itself from Deus and the Zohar and return to its dimension via the Path of Sephirot.  Krelian also used this chain of events to travel through the Path of Sephirot to the higher dimension, which was his ultimate goal and reason for taking command of Project Noah.

===Wiseman===
Kahn Wong's alter ego would eventually be called '''Wiseman'''.  This masked, hooded and caped figure appears several times throughout the game and gives Fei advice.  Sometimes, he appears to fight or antagonize him; other times, he appears to directly help Fei and the group, such as when he appeared in Zeboim to contain Id.  Wiseman first appears in a flashback when Chief Lee tells Fei that he had brought him to Lahan three years before the start of the game.  Wiseman appears in the flesh just before the Battle Tournament in Bledavik.  The last time Wiseman appears is after Fei and Id have reconciled in Fei's mind and the Xenogears Gear is created.  Wiseman disappears forever when he reveals that he is Kahn Wong, Fei's estranged father.  It is also revealed that Wiseman, Kahn, and Grahf are the same person, and Grahf has taken over Kahn's body and is using him as a host.  Kahn's will allowed him to periodically break free of Grahf's control and act of his own accord.  It is during these times that he appeared as Wiseman.

===Yui===
'''Yui Uzuki''' is the granddaughter of Shevat Sage Gaspar Uzuki, wife of Citan Uzuki, and mother of Midori Uzuki. She is an expert swordswoman and was the best warrior in her native Shevat at one time.  During an attack by Solaris, Yui defeated a young Solarian soldier named Hyuga Ricdeau and took him prisoner.  Instead of killing him, Yui showed him mercy and tended to him while he was in custody.  From this, a bond of love was formed between them; eventually, Yui married him, and he took her name when he constructed a new identity for himself for his upcoming mission on the surface world.  With her new husband, Citan Uzuki, Yui moved down to the surface to a house near Lahan Village and lived there as her husband kept watch on Fei, the newly discovered Contact, for Emperor Cain. After Lahan is destroyed by Id, Yui brings the survivors with her when she returns to Shevat.  While Midori is seen again in Disc 2, Yui, like many minor characters, is absent, although she is still mentioned to be alive.

===Zephyr===
Queen '''Zephyr''' has been the leader of Shevat since the Shevat-Solaris war 500 years before ''Xenogears''.  Along with the Sages of Shevat and several other individuals, she was "punished" with the gift of eternal life through nanomachines for, in Krelian's mind at least, sacrificing Sophia to end the war.  In the second disc of the game, Shevat is destroyed during the resurrection of Deus and crashlands on one of the northern snow-covered islands of the world. She remained queen of the surviving population of Shevat and the rest of the world in the Snowfield Hideout.
