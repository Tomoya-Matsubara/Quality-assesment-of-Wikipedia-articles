Helms first began wrestling in 1991 at the age of 16, and wrestled in numerous [[Independent circuit|independent]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]], including the [[Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts]], winning numerous [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|Light Heavyweight]] and [[Tag team]] [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championships]]. In 1999, he signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), and gained fame as "Sugar" Shane Helms, a member of [[3 Count]]. During his time there he won both the [[WCW Hardcore Championship]] and the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|WCW Cruiserweight title]]. When WCW was bought by the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) (now WWE), Helms' contract was kept by WWF. Helms renamed himself "The Hurricane" and won the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]]. He later picked up a sidekick, [[Matt Anoa'i|Rosey]], and they won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] together.

He dropped the superhero [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] in 2005, and began wrestling under his real name. He once again won the Cruiserweight Championship in early 2006, and held it for over a year, becoming the longest reigning Cruiserweight Champion in history (385 days) and the longest reigning champion of any kind in ''SmackDown'' history. After being out of action for over a year after neck fusion surgery Helms returned to ''SmackDown'' in September 2008, referring to himself as Hurricane Helms, before moving to the ECW brand where he reverted to his Gregory Helms name, and became the backstage interviewer. In mid-2009, he brought back The Hurricane character, and currently appears as both Gregory Helms and The Hurricane on ''ECW''.
