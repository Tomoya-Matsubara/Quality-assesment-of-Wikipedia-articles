'''Swami Sivananda Saraswati''' ([[Sep 8]], [[1887]]<U+2014>[[Jul 14]], [[1963]]), was an [[India]]n spiritual leader and a well known proponent of [[Yoga]] and [[Vedanta]]. Sivananda was born '''Kuppuswami''' in [[South India]]. He studied medicine and served in [[Malaya]] as a [[physician]] for several years before taking up monasticism. He lived most of the later part of his life in [[Rishikesh]]. He is the founder [[Divine Life Society]] and author of over 200 books<ref>http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/teachers/sivananda/sivananda.html</ref> on yoga, vedanta and a variety of other subjects.

==Early life==
Sivananda was born Kuppuswamy in Pattamadai near [[Tirunelveli]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] as the third son to his parents on [[8 September]] [[1887]].<ref name="autobio">[http://dlshq.org/download/autobio.htm ''Autobiography of Swami Sivananda'']</ref> Kuppuswami the boy was very active and promising in academics and gymnastics. He attended medical school in [[Tanjore]], where he excelled. He ran a medical journal called ''Ambrosia'' during this period. Upon graduation he practiced medicine and worked as a [[Physician|doctor]] in [[Malaya]] for ten years, with a reputation for waiving his fee for poor patients needing treatment.<ref name="autobio" /> Over time, a sense that medicine was healing on a superficial level grew in him,<ref name="autobio" /> urging him to look elsewhere to fill the void, and in [[1923]] he left Malaya and retuned to India to pursue a spiritual quest. 

==Initiation==
Upon his return to India he visited [[Varanasi|Banaras]], [[Nashik]], [[Poona]] and various other pilgrimage centres. At [[Banaras]], he had the [[Darshan]] of Lord [[Shiva|Vishvanath]].<ref name="autobio" />

Sivananda next went to [[Rishikesh]] in 1924 where met his guru, [[Swami Vishwananda Saraswati]]. It was Vishwananda who initiated him into the Sannyas order and gave him his monastic name.<ref name="autobio" /> However, since Sivananda spent only a few hours with Swami Vishwananda, the full [[Viraja Homa]] ceremonies were performed later by Swami Vishnudevananda (not to be confused with his own later disciple, [[Swami Vishnu-devananda]]), the [[Mahant]] of [[Sri Kailas Ashram]].<ref name="autobio" /> After initiation, Sivananda settled in Rishikesh and immersed himself in intense spiritual practices. Sivananda performed austerities for many years but he also continued to help the sick. With some money from his insurance policy that had matured, he started a charitable dispensary  at [[Lakshmanjula]] in [[1927]] and served pilgrims, holy men and the poor using his medical expertise.

==Travels==
After a few years, Sivananda went on an extensive pilgrimage and traveled the length and breadth of India to meditate at holy shrines and study with spiritual teachers throughout India. During this Parivrajaka (wandering monk) life, Sivananda visited important places of pilgrimage in the south, including [[Rameshvaram]].<ref name="autobio" /> He conducted [[Sankirtan]] and delivered lectures during his travels. He visited the [[Sri Aurobindo]] Ashram and met [[Maharishi Suddhananda Bharati]]. At the [[Ramana ashram]], he had the [[Darshan]] of [[Ramana Maharshi]] on Maharshi's birthday.<ref name="sivananda_dlshq">http://dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm</ref> He sang [[bhajan]]s and danced in ecstasy with  Maharshi's [[bhakta]]s. He also went on pilgrimages to various places in northern India including [[Kedarnath]] and [[Badrinath]]. He visited [[Mount Kailash|Kailash]]-[[Lake Manasarovar|Manasarovar]] in 1931.

==Foundations==

During Sivananda's stay in Rishikesh and his travels around India, many came to him for guidance in the spiritual path. He permitted some of them to live near him and instructed them. Sivananda  asked his students take copies of his short articles and send them for publication. Slowly, large number of people started coming to him and his circle started growing.

Sivananda founded the [[Divine Life Society]] in [[1936]] on the banks of the holy [[Ganges River]]. The free distribution of spiritual literature drew a steady flow of disciples to the Swami, including the young [[U.G. Krishnamurti]], who studied with him for seven summers, and [[Swami Satyananda Saraswati]], founder of [[Satyananda Yoga]].

In [[1945]], Swami Sivananda created the Sivananda [[Ayurvedic]] Pharmacy, and organized the All-world Religions Federation.  He established the All-world Sadhus Federation in 1947 and Yoga-Vedanta Forest Academy in 1948. He called his yoga the ''Yoga of Synthesis''.

In 1957, Sivananda sent his disciple Swami Vishnu-devananda to the west to spread the teachings of yoga and [[vedanta]]. According to stories, Sivananda placed 10 [[rupees]] in Vishnu-devananda's palm, and simply said, "''People are waiting''<U+201D>.<ref>http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/teachers/swamiji/swamiji.html</ref> Vishnu-devananda's efforts resulted in a great number of Sivananda institutes across the globe, bringing Sivananda's philosophy to a vast audience.

==Authorship==
A prolific author, Swami Sivananda wrote exactly 296 books on a variety of subjects: [[metaphysics]], [[Yoga]], [[religion]], [[western philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[eschatology]], [[fine arts]], [[ethics]], [[education]], [[health]], [[sayings]], [[poems]], [[epistles]], [[autobiography]], [[biography]], [[stories]], [[dramas]], [[messages]], [[lectures]], [[dialogues]], [[essays]] and [[anthology]].<ref>http://www.dlshq.org/allbooks.htm</ref>  Yet his books emphasized the practical application of yoga philosophy over mere theoretical knowledge.  He was known to have said "An ounce of practice is better than tons of theory. Practice Yoga, Religion and Philosophy in daily life and attain Self-realization."<ref>See 'Sadhana Tattva': http://www.dlshq.org/download/allsiva.htm#_VPID_122</ref>

==Death==
Swami Sivananda attained [[mahasamadhi]] on [[14 July]] [[1963]] in his Kutir on the bank of Ganges, in Shivanandanagar.<ref name="sivananda_dlshq" />
