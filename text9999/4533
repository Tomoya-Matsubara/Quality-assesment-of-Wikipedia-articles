The '''''Siegfried'' class''' was a group of six [[coastal defense ship]]s built by the German [[Kaiserliche Marine]] (Imperial Navy) in the late 19th century. The ships were intended to protect the German coastline from naval attacks. The class comprised the lead ship {{SMS|Siegfried||2}}, along with her [[sister ship|sisters]] {{SMS|Beowulf||2}}, {{SMS|Frithjof||2}}, {{SMS|Heimdall||2}}, {{SMS|Hildebrand||2}}, and {{SMS|Hagen||2}}. All six ships were named after [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological figures]].

The ''Siegfried'' class ships were obsolete by the outbreak of [[World War I]], and saw only limited service in their intended role before they were withdrawn from active duty. The ships then served in a variety of secondary duties, including barracks ships, target ships, and in the case of ''Beowulf'', an icebreaker in the [[Baltic Sea]]. All six ships were struck from the [[Navy List|naval register]] on 17 June 1919, days before the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed. Five of the ships were sold for scrapping immediately after they were struck from the register, but ''Frithjof'' was purchased by a shipping company, and converted into a freighter. She served in this capacity until she too was scrapped in 1930.

==Design==
===General characteristics===
The ships of the ''Siegfried'' class were {{convert|76|m|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|79|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. The ships had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.9|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of between {{convert|5.51|m|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|5.74|m|abbr=on}} aft. All six ships were heavily rebuilt, each undergoing refits at various times between 1898 and 1904. During the rebuilding, the ships were lengthened, to {{convert|84.8|m|abbr=on}} at the waterline and {{convert|86.13|m|abbr=on}} overall. The ships' beams remained the same, but their draft was slightly decreased, to {{convert|5.45|m|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|5.47|m|abbr=on}} aft. The ships had a designed displacement of {{convert|3500|MT|sp=us|lk=on}}, and a maximum displacement of {{convert|3741|MT|abbr=on}}. After the reconstruction, the displacement was increased to between {{convert|4000|to|4436|MT|abbr=on}}, depending on the ship.<ref name="Groner10">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 10</ref>

The ships used transverse and longitudinal steel frames in the hull. They had eight [[watertight compartment]]s and a [[double bottom]] that ran for 60% of the hull. After the refits, one more watertight compartment was added. The ships were described as good sea boats; they had gentle motion and were very responsive to commands from the [[Ship's wheel|helm]]. The ships lost significant speed in heavy seas, however. The ships had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men, with an additional 6 officers and 22 men when serving as a [[flagship]]. The refit increased crew requirements, to an additional 31 sailors normally, and the extra flagship crew increased to 9 officers and 34 men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one [[pinnace]], two [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]s, one [[yawl]], and one [[dinghy]].<ref name="Groner11">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 11</ref>

===Propulsion===
The ships were powered by two sets of 3-cylinder [[triple expansion engine]]s, each in its own engine room. These engines drove a pair of three-bladed screws that were {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. The ships had eight marine type boilers, with the exception of ''Hagen'', which was equipped with eight Thornycroft boilers. The ships had similar maximum speeds, with ''Beowulf'' the fastest at {{convert|15.1|kn|lk=on}} and ''Heimdall'' the slowest at {{convert|14.6|kn|abbr=on}}. Each ship had three electric generators that provided between 29&ndash;26&nbsp;kilowatts at 67&nbsp;volts.<ref name="Groner11"/> The ships stored up to {{convert|220|MT|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|220|MT|abbr=on}} of fuel oil, which enabled a range of {{convert|1490|nmi|lk=on}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}. At {{convert|14|kn|abbr=on}}, the ships could only steam {{convert|740|nmi|abbr=on}}. With the refit, fuel bunkerage was more than doubled, to {{convert|580|MT|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|500|MT|abbr=on}} of oil. This dramatically increased the sailing range, to {{convert|3400|nmi|abbr=on}} at 10&nbsp;knots and {{convert|1940|nmi|abbr=on}} at 14&nbsp;knots.<ref name="Groner10"/>

===Armament===
The ships' primary armament consisted of three {{convert|24|cm|adj=on}} SK L/35 guns<ref name="Groner11"/>. In an arrangement very unusual for such large guns, two of which were mounted in a pair of MPL C/88 [[gun turret|turrets]] forward side-by-side, while the third was mounted in a single turret aft. The guns could train 150&nbsp;degrees to either side of the centerline, and depress to -4&nbsp;degrees and elevate to 25&nbsp;degrees. This enabled a maximum range of {{convert|13,000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Navweaps24">{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = Germany 24 cm/35 (9.4") SK L/35 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_945-35_skc88.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 26 November 2007 | accessdate = 12 June 2009 }}</ref> The guns had an ammunition storage of 204 rounds, or 68 shells per gun.<ref name="Groner11"/> The guns had a rate of fire of around 2 shells per minute. The 1895 design for the [[armor piercing]] shell weighed {{convert|140|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Navweaps24"/>

The ships also had a secondary battery of eight {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} SK L/30 guns with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, though ''Siegfried'' only had six of these guns. After the refit, this was increased to ten 8.8&nbsp;cm guns, and the munition storage correspondingly increased to 2,500 rounds.<ref name="Groner11"/> The 8.8&nbsp;cm gun fired a {{convert|10|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} projectile at a muzzle velocity of 590&nbsp;m/s (1,936&nbsp;m/s). The guns could sustain a rate of fire of approximately 15 rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = German 8.8 cm/30 (3.46") SK L/30 8.8 cm/30 (3.46") Ubts L/30  | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_88mm-30_skc97.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 22 March 2007 | accessdate = 5 June 2009 }}</ref> Six [[machine gun]]s were temporarily fitted.<ref name="Groner11"/>

The ships were also equipped with four {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes. One tube was mounted in the stern in an above-water swivel mount, two were placed laterally, also above water, and the fourth was in the bow. The torpedo tubes were supplied with a total of 10 torpedoes. After the refit, the stern and lateral tubes were replaced with {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} weapons, but the lateral torpedo tubes were submerged. They had 8 torpedoes between them. The bow tube was retained, but also moved below the waterline; it had three torpedoes.<ref name="Groner11"/>

===Armor===
The ships' armor consisted of [[Compound armour|compound steel]] for the first three ships and [[Krupp armor]] for the last three, coupled with [[teak]]. The upper section of the main [[armored belt]] was {{convert|240|mm|sp=us}} thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to {{convert|180|mm|abbr=on}} at either end. This was mounted on {{convert|330|mm|abbr=on}} of timber. The lower section of the belt was {{convert|140|mm|abbr=on}} thick in the central area, and {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} on the bow and stern. This portion of the armored belt was mounted on {{convert|290|mm|abbr=on}} of timber. The main armored deck was {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} thick, though on ''Hagen'' and ''Heimdall'' this was increased to {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}}. The [[conning tower]] had a roof that was 30|mm|abbr=on}} thick and sides that were {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick; the armor protection on the conning tower sides was also increased on ''Hagen'' and ''Heimdall'', to {{convert|160|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Groner11"/>

==Construction==
The six ships of the ''Siegfried'' class were built by a combination of private and government shipyards. ''Siegfried'' was laid down at the [[Germaniawerft]] dockyard in [[Kiel]] in 1888. The ship was ordered as the coast defense ship "O" under construction number 44. She was launched on 10 August 1889 and commissioned into the fleet on 29 April 1890. ''Beowulf'' was built at [[AG Weser]] in [[Bremen]] from 1890 to 1892. She had been ordered as "P", under construction number 100. ''Beowulf'' was launched on 8 November 1890 and commissioned on 1 April 1892. ''Frithjof'' was also built at AG Weser, under construction number 101 and the provisional name "Q". She was launched on 21 July 1891 and commissioned into active service on 23 February 1893.<ref name="Groner10-11">Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 10, 11</ref>

''Heimdall'', ''Hildebrand'', and ''Hagen'' were all built at Imperial Navy dockyards, with ''Heimdall'' at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven]] and the latter two at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel]]. ''Heimdall'' was laid down in 1891 under construction number 14 and the provisional name "U"; she was launched on 27 July 1892 and commissioned on 7 April 1894. ''Hildebrand'' and ''Hagen'' were ordered as "R" and "S", respectively. ''Hildebrand'' was laid down in 1890, launched on 6 August 1892, and commissioned on 28 October 1893. ''Hagen'', the last ship of the class, was laid down in 1891, launched on 21 October 1893, and completed on 2 October 1894.<ref name="Groner10-11"/>

==Service history==
[[File:SMS Hagen.jpg|thumb|right|''Hagen'' underway]]
The ships of the ''Siegfried'' class saw only limited service in their intended roles. The revolutions in capital ship building in the first decade of the 20th century rapidly made these ships obsolete. The [[German Naval Laws|Second Naval Law]], passed on 27 March 1908, reduced the service life of all capital ships from 25 years to 20 years. This meant that the ''Siegfried'' class ships, along with a number of other vessels, were to be replaced as soon as possible.<ref>Gardiner and Gray, p. 135</ref> ''Siegfried'', ''Beowulf'', and ''Frithjof'' were replaced by the {{sclass|Helgoland|battleship|1}}s {{SMS|Helgoland||2}}, {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}}, and {{SMS|Oldenburg||2}}.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 24</ref> ''Heimdall'', ''Hildebrand'', and ''Hagen'' were replaced by the {{sclass|Kaiser|battleship|1}}s {{SMS|Kaiser||2}}, {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}}, and {{SMS|Kaiserin||2}}, respectively.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 26</ref>

As the new battleships were intended for offensive operations, the ''Siegfried'' class was still retained for coast defense duties. The ships served in this capacity through the start of [[World War I]], until they were withdrawn from active service in 1915.<ref name="Groner11"/> Afterward, all six ships served in a variety of secondary roles, primarily as barracks ships. All six ships were struck from the [[Navy List|naval register]] on 17 June 1919, shortly before the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which ended the First World War, was signed. ''Siegfried'' was a [[barracks ship]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]] from 1916. She was intended to be rebuilt as a salvage ship, but this plan was abandoned and the vessel was sold to H. Peters, Wewelsfleth in 1919 for 425,000 [[German gold mark|marks]]. She was broken up in 1920 in Kiel. ''Beowulf'' served as a target ship for [[U-boat]]s from 1916 to 1918, when she transitioned to ice-breaking duty in the [[Baltic Sea]]. ''Frithjof'' was a barracks ship in [[Danzig]] after 1916. Following her removal from navy service, she was sold to A Bernstein in Hamburg. She was rebuilt as a freighter by [[Deutsche Werke]], and served in this capacity until she was broken up in 1930. She was the longest service ''Siegfried'' class ship.<ref name="Groner11"/>

''Heimdall'' was a barracks ship for the crews of U-boats and the Ems coast defense flotilla based in [[Emden]]. Like ''Siegfried'', ''Heimdall'' was intended to be reconstructed as a salvage ship, and this was likewise abandoned. She was broken up for scrap metal in 1921. ''Hildebrand'' was a barracks ship in [[Windau]] after she was removed from active duty. She was sold to a Dutch ship-breaking firm in 1919, but while en route to the scrapyard, she became grounded on the Dutch coast. The wreck was blown up in 1933, and eventually scrapped [[:wikt:in situ|in situ]]. ''Hagen'' was a barracks ship in [[Libau]], Danzig, and [[Warnem<U+00FC>nde]] during the remainder of World War I. She was sold for scrapping to Norddeutsche Tiefbauges after the end of the war.<ref name="Groner11"/>
