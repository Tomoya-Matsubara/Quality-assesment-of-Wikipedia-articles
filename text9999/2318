'''Human immunodeficiency virus''' ('''HIV''') is a [[retrovirus]] that causes ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' ([[AIDS]], a condition in [[human]]s in which the [[immune system]] begins to fail, leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections). Previous names for the [[virus]] include '''human T-lymphotropic virus-III''' ('''HTLV-III'''), '''lymphadenopathy-associated virus''' ('''LAV'''), and '''AIDS-associated retrovirus''' ('''ARV''').<ref>{{cite web| author=Rick Sowadsky| year=1999 |url=http://thebody.org/Forums/AIDS/safesex/Archive/origins/Q8777.html |title=What is HTLV-III?| accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref><ref name=Coffin>{{cite journal

Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of [[blood]], [[semen]], [[vaginal fluid]], [[pre-ejaculate]], or [[breast milk]]. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells. The three major routes of transmission are [[unprotected sex|unprotected sexual intercourse]], contaminated needles, and transmission from an infected mother to her baby at [[childbirth|birth]], or through breast milk. Screening of blood products for HIV in the [[developed world]] has largely eliminated transmission through blood transfusions or infected blood products in these countries. 

HIV infection in humans is now [[pandemic]]. [[As of 2006|As of January 2006]], the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized on [[December 1]], [[1981]], making it one of the most destructive [[AIDS pandemic|pandemics]] in recorded history. In 2005 alone, AIDS claimed an estimated 2.4&ndash;3.3 million lives, of which more than 570,000 were children. It is estimated that about 0.6% of the world's living population is infected with HIV.<ref name=UNAIDS2006>{{cite book

HIV primarily infects vital cells in the [[human]] [[immune system]] such as [[helper T cell]]s (specifically CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells), [[macrophages]] and [[dendritic cells]]. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells through three main mechanisms: firstly, direct viral killing of infected cells; secondly, increased rates of [[apoptosis]] in infected cells; and thirdly, killing of infected CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells by [[CD8 cytotoxic lymphocyte]]s that recognize infected cells. When CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cell numbers decline below a critical level, [[cell-mediated immunity]] is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.  If untreated, eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop [[AIDS|AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)]] and die; however about one in ten remain healthy for many years, with no noticeable symptoms.<ref name=Buchbinder>{{cite journal

==Origin and discovery==
{{main|AIDS origin}}
The AIDS epidemic was discovered [[June 5]], [[1981]], when the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported a cluster of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)]] caused by a form of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis carinii'']], now recognized as a distinct species [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis jirovecii'']], in five homosexual men in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=MMWR2>{{cite web

In 1982, the CDC introduced the term AIDS to describe the newly recognized syndrome, though it was still casually referred to as GRID. 

In 1983, scientists led by [[Luc Montagnier]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[France]] first discovered the virus that causes AIDS.<ref name=Barre>{{cite journal

Upon entry of the target cell, the viral RNA [[genome]] is converted to double-stranded [[DNA]] by a virally encoded [[reverse transcriptase]] that is present in the virus particle. This viral DNA is then integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded [[integrase]] so that the genome can be [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]. Once the virus has infected the cell, two pathways are possible: either the virus becomes [[Incubation period|latent]] and the infected cell continues to function, or the virus becomes active and replicates, and a large number of virus particles are liberated that can then infect other cells.

Two species of HIV infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is thought to have originated in southern [[Cameroon]] after jumping from wild [[chimpanzees]] (''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'') to humans during the [[twentieth century]].<ref name=Gao>{{cite journal

Although a variety of theories exist explaining the transfer of HIV to humans, no single hypothesis is unanimously accepted, and the topic remains controversial. The most widely accepted theory is so called 'Hunter' Theory according to which transference from chimp to human most likely occurred when a human was bitten by a chimp or was cut while butchering one, and the human became infected.<ref name="avert">

''[[The Times]]'' published an article in 1987 stating that WHO suspected some kind of connection with its vaccine program and AIDS-epidemic. The story was almost entirely based on statements given by one unnamed WHO advisor. The theory was supported only by weak circumstantial evidence and is now disproven by unraveling the genetic code of the virus and finding out that the virus dates back to the 1930s.<ref name=MAP>The Times, frontpage, 1987/5/11,

Freelance journalist [[Tom Curtis]] discussed one controversial possibility for the origin of HIV/AIDS in a 1992 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine article. He put forward what is now known as the [[OPV AIDS hypothesis]], which suggests that AIDS was inadvertently caused in the late 1950s in the [[Belgian Congo]] by [[Hilary Koprowski]]'s research into a [[polio]] [[vaccine]].<ref name=Curtis>{{cite journal

Hooper's research resulted in his publishing a 1999 book, ''[[Edward Hooper|The River]]'', in which he alleged that an experimental oral [[polio]] [[vaccine]] prepared using [[chimpanzee]] kidney tissue was the route through which [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) crossed into humans to become HIV, thus starting the human AIDS pandemic.<ref name=Hooper>{{cite book

Since the beginning of the [[pandemic]], three main transmission routes for HIV have been identified:
*'''Sexual route.''' The majority of HIV infections are acquired through unprotected sexual relations. Sexual transmission can occur when infected sexual secretions of one partner come into contact with the genital, oral, or rectal [[mucous membranes]] of another.
*'''Blood or blood product route.''' This transmission route can account for infections in intravenous drug users, [[hemophiliac]]s and recipients of [[blood transfusion]]s (though most transfusions are checked for HIV in the developed world) and blood products. It is also of concern for persons receiving medical care in regions where there is prevalent substandard hygiene in the use of injection equipment, such as the reuse of needles in Third World countries. HIV can also be spread through the sharing of leeches. Health care workers such as nurses, laboratory workers, and doctors, have also been infected, although this occurs more rarely. People who give and receive tattoos, piercings, and scarification procedures can also be at risk of infection.
*'''Mother-to-child transmission''' (MTCT). The transmission of the virus from the mother to the child can occur ''in utero'' during the last weeks of pregnancy and at childbirth. In the absence of treatment, the transmission rate between the mother and child is 25%.<ref name=Coovadia /> However, where drug treatment and [[Cesarian section]] are available, this can be reduced to 1%.<ref name=Coovadia /> Breast feeding also presents a risk of infection for the baby.

HIV-2 is transmitted much less frequently by the MTCT and sexual route than HIV-1.

HIV has been found at low concentrations in the [[saliva]], [[tears]] and [[urine]] of infected individuals, but there are no recorded cases of infection by these secretions and the potential risk of transmission is negligible. The use of physical barriers such as the [[latex]] [[condom]] is widely advocated to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV. [[Spermicide]], when used alone or with vaginal contraceptives like a [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]], actually increases the male to female transmission rate due to inflammation of the vagina; it should not be considered a barrier to infection.<ref name="spermicide">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/condom.html#should |title=Should spermicides be used with condoms? |accessdate=2006-10-23 |work=Condom Brochure, FDA OSHI HIV STDs }}</ref> Research is clarifying the relationship between male [[circumcision]] and HIV in differing social and cultural contexts, however critics point out that any correlation between circumcision and HIV is likely to come from cultural factors (which govern not only whether someone is circumcised, but also their sexual practices and beliefs).<ref name=Siegfred>

==Increase==
Resisting [[natural selection]], most HIV sufferers go on to share the disease aware or unaware that they have it. Some propose that since the gene pool is limited to this world and the sufferers are not removed by natural selection and allowed to infect others and even reproduce, a higher percentage of HIV will result, which in turn would result in an even higher percent.[23]<!-- Is this reference still valid?? -->

Of the nine genes that are encoded within the RNA genome, three of these genes, ''gag'', ''pol'', and ''env'', contain information needed to make the structural proteins for new virus particles.<ref name=compendia/> ''env'', for example, codes for a protein called gp160 that is broken down by a viral enzyme to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, ''tat'', ''rev'', ''nef'', ''vif'', ''vpr'', and ''vpu'' (or ''vpx'' in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.<ref name=compendia/> The protein encoded by ''nef'', for instance, appears necessary for the virus to replicate efficiently, and the ''vpu''-encoded protein influences the release of new virus particles from infected cells.<ref name=compendia/> The ends of each strand of HIV RNA contain an RNA sequence called the long terminal repeat (LTR). Regions in the LTR act as switches to control production of new viruses and can be triggered by proteins from either HIV or the host cell.<ref name=compendia/>

==Tropism==
The term ''viral tropism'' refers to which cell types HIV infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as [[Helper T cell|CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells]], [[macrophage]]s, and [[microglial cell]]s. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with [[chemokine]] coreceptors.<ref name=Chan/>

Macrophage (M-tropic) strains of HIV-1, or non-[[syncitia]]-inducing strains (NSI) use the ''<U+03B2>''-chemokine receptor [[CCR5]] for entry and are thus able to replicate in macrophages and CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells.<ref name=Coakley>{{

}}</ref> This CCR5 coreceptor is used by almost all primary HIV-1 isolates regardless of viral genetic subtype. Indeed, macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4<SUP>+</SUP> cells become depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the [[central nervous system]]. In tonsils and adenoids of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells that produce huge amounts of virus. 

T-tropic isolates, or [[syncitia]]-inducing (SI) strains replicate in primary CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells as well as in macrophages and use the ''<U+03B1>''-chemokine receptor, [[CXCR4]], for entry.<ref name=Coakley /><ref name=Deng>

}}</ref> Dual-tropic HIV-1 strains are thought to be transitional strains of the HIV-1 virus and thus are able to use both CCR5 and LESTR as co-receptors for viral entry.

The ''<U+03B1>''-chemokine, SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, suppresses replication of T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating the expression of CXCR4 on the surface of these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed [[R5]], those that only use CXCR4 are termed [[X4]], and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection<ref name=Coakley /> and HIV can also infect a subtype of [[myeloid dendritic cells]],<ref name=Knight>

Sexual intercourse is the major mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV are present in the [[seminal fluid]] which is passed from partner to partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism.

===Entry to the cell===
HIV enters macrophages and CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells by the [[adsorption]] of [[glycoproteins]] on its surface to receptors on the target cell followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane and the release of the HIV capsid into the cell.<ref name=Chan2>{{cite journal |author=Chan D, Kim P |title=HIV entry and its inhibition |journal=Cell |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=681-4 |year=1998 |pmid=9630213}}</ref><ref name=Wyatt>{{cite journal |author=Wyatt R, Sodroski J |title=The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins: fusogens, antigens, and immunogens |journal=Science |volume=280 |issue=5371 |pages=1884-8 |year=1998 | doi=10.1126/science.280.5371.1884 |pmid=9632381}}</ref>

The interactions of the trimeric envelope complex (gp160 spike, discussed above) and both [[CD4]] and a chemokine receptor (generally either CCR5 or CXCR4 but others are known to interact) on the cell surface.<ref name=Chan2/><ref name=Wyatt/> The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and chemokine receptors.<ref name=Chan2/><ref name=Wyatt/> The first step in fusion involves the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4.  Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine binding domains of gp120 and allowing them to interact with the target chemokine receptor.<ref name=Chan2/><ref name=Wyatt/> This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane.<ref name=Chan2/><ref name=Wyatt/> Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1 and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.<ref name=Chan2/><ref name=Wyatt/>

Once HIV has bound to the target cell, the HIV [[RNA]] and various [[enzymes]], including reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease and protease, are injected into the cell.<ref name=Chan2/>

HIV can infect [[dendritic cells]] (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, but another route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as [[DC-SIGN]] can also be used.<ref name=Pope_2003>{{cite journal |author=Pope M, Haase A |title=Transmission, acute HIV-1 infection and the quest for strategies to prevent infection |journal=Nat Med |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=847-52 |year=2003 |pmid=12835704}}</ref> DCs are one of the first cells encountered by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought to play an important role by transmitting HIV to T cells once the virus has been captured in the [[mucosa]] by DCs.<ref name=Pope_2003 />

===Replication and transcription===
Once the viral capsid enters the cell, an [[enzyme]] called ''[[reverse transcriptase]]'' liberates the single-stranded (+)[[RNA]] from the attached viral proteins and copies it into a complementary [[DNA]] of 9 kb size.<ref name=Zheng>

{{cite journal

}}</ref> This process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause [[Resistance to antiviral drugs|drug resistance]]. The reverse transcriptase then makes a complementary DNA strand to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA). This vDNA is then transported into the [[cell nucleus]]. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's [[genome]] is carried out by another viral enzyme called ''[[integrase]]''.<ref name=Zheng/> 

This integrated viral DNA may then lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection.<ref name=Zheng/> To actively produce the virus, certain cellular [[transcription factors]] need to be present, the most important of which is [[NF-kB|NF-''<U+03BA>''B]] (NF kappa B), which is upregulated when T cells become activated.<ref name=Hiscott>

}}</ref> This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are in fact those currently fighting infection.

In this replication process, the integrated [[provirus]] is copied to [[mRNA]] which is then [[Splicing (genetics)|spliced]] into smaller pieces. These small pieces produce the regulatory proteins [[Tat]] (which encourages new virus production) and [[Rev]]. As Rev accumulates it gradually starts to inhibit [[mRNA]] [[splicing]].<ref name=Pollard>

}}</ref> At this stage, the structural proteins Gag and Env are produced from the full-length mRNA. The full-length RNA is actually the virus genome; it binds to the Gag protein and is packaged into new virus particles.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 appear to package their RNA differently; HIV-1 will bind to any appropriate RNA whereas HIV-2 will preferentially bind to the mRNA which was used to create the Gag protein itself. This may mean that HIV-1 is better able to mutate (HIV-1 infection progresses to AIDS faster than HIV-2 infection and is responsible for the majority of global infections).

===Assembly and release===
The final step of the viral cycle, assembly of new HIV-1 virons, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and is transported to the [[Golgi]] complex where it is cleaved by [[protease]] and processed into the two HIV envelope glycoproteins gp41 and gp120. These are transported to the [[plasma membrane]] of the host cell where gp41 anchors the gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. Maturation either occurs in the forming bud or in the immature virion after it buds from the host cell. During maturation, HIV proteases cleave the polyproteins into individual functional HIV proteins and enzymes. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion.<ref name=Gelderblom>{{cite book

HIV differs from many other viruses as it has very high genetic variability. This diversity is a result of its fast [[HIV#Life cycle of HIV|replication cycle]], with the generation of 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10<sup>-5</sup> per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and [[Genetic recombination|recombinogenic]] properties of reverse transcriptase.<ref name=RobertsonDL>

}}</ref> This complex scenario leads to the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient in the course of one day.<ref name=RobertsonDL/> This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping back and forth between the two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes.<ref name=RobertsonDL/> This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.<ref name=RobertsonDL/> 

The closely related [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) exhibits a somewhat different behavior: in its natural hosts, [[African green monkey]]s and [[sooty mangabey]]s, the retrovirus is present in high levels in the blood, but evokes only a mild immune response,<ref>Holzammer, S., Holznagel, E., Kaul, A., Kurth, R. and Norley, S.

Infection with HIV-1 is associated with a progressive decrease of the CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cell count and an increase in [[viral load]]. The stage of infection can be determined by measuring the patient's CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cell count, and the level of HIV in the blood.

The initial infection with HIV generally occurs after transfer of body fluids from an infected person to an uninfected one. The first stage of infection, the primary, or acute infection, is a period of rapid viral replication that immediately follows the individual's exposure to HIV leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood with levels of HIV commonly approaching several million viruses per&nbsp;mL.<ref name=Piatak> {{cite journal | author=Piatak, M., Jr, Saag, M.

This acute viremia is associated in virtually all patients with the activation of [[cytotoxic T cell|CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells]], which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or [[seroconversion]]. The CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts rebound to around 800 cells per&nbsp;mL  (the normal value is 1200 cells per&nbsp;mL ). A good CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.<ref name=Pantaleo1998>

}}</ref> During this period (usually 2-4 weeks post-exposure) most individuals (80 to 90%) develop an influenza or mononucleosis-like illness called [[acute HIV infection]], the most common symptoms of which may include [[fever]], [[lymphadenopathy]], [[pharyngitis]], [[rash]], [[myalgia]], [[malaise]], mouth and esophagal sores, and may also include, but less commonly, [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], enlarged liver/spleen, [[weight loss]], [[thrush]], and neurological symptoms.

}}</ref> Because of the nonspecific nature of these illnesses, it is often not recognized as a sign of HIV infection. Even if patients go to their doctors or a hospital, they will often be misdiagnosed as having one of the more common infectious diseases with the same symptoms. Consequently, these primary symptoms are not used to diagnose HIV infection as they do not develop in all cases and because many are caused by other more common diseases. However, recognizing the syndrome can be important because the patient is much more infectious during this period.

A strong immune defense reduces the number of viral particles in the blood stream, marking the start of the infection's [[incubation period|clinical latency]] stage. Clinical latency can vary between two weeks and 20 years. During this early phase of infection, HIV is active within [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid organs]], where large amounts of virus become trapped in the follicular [[dendritic cell]]s (FDC) network.<ref name=burton>

When CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and infections with a variety of opportunistic microbes appear. The first symptoms often include moderate and unexplained weight loss, recurring respiratory tract infections (such as [[sinusitis]], [[bronchitis]], [[otitis media]], [[pharyngitis]]), [[prostatitis]], skin rashes, and oral ulcerations. Common opportunistic infections and tumors, most of which are normally controlled by robust CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated immunity then start to affect the patient. Typically, resistance is lost early on to oral Candida species and to ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', which leads to an increased susceptibilty to [[oral candidiasis]] (thrush) and [[tuberculosis]]. Later, reactivation of latent [[Herpesviridae|herpes viruses]] may cause worsening recurrences of [[herpes simplex]] eruptions, [[shingles]], [[Epstein-Barr virus]]-induced B-cell lymphomas, or [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], a [[tumor]] of [[endothelial cell]]s that occurs when HIV proteins such as Tat interact with [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|Human Herpesvirus-8]]. Pneumonia caused by the fungus ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'' is common and often fatal. In the final stages of AIDS, infection with [[cytomegalovirus]] (another herpes virus) or [[Mycobacterium avium complex]] is more prominent. Not all patients with AIDS get all these infections or tumors, and there are other tumors and infections that are less prominent but still significant.

HIV-1 testing consists of initial screening with an [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1.

Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate.<ref name=CDC2001>

Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by Western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection.

}}</ref> Although IFA can be used to confirm infection in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. Generally, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate Western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations.<ref name=CDC2001 /> In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.

Because the Bank aims to assist in implementation of national government programmes, their experience provides important insights on how national AIDS programmes can be made more effective.

The development of [[HAART]] as effective therapy for HIV infection and AIDS has substantially reduced the death rate from this disease in those areas where these drugs are widely available. This has created the misperception that the disease has vanished. In fact, as the life expectancy of persons with AIDS has increased in countries where HAART is widely used, the number of persons living with AIDS has increased substantially. In the United States, the number of persons with AIDS increased from about 35,000 in 1988 to over 220,000 in 1996.<ref name=CDC1996>{{

In Africa, the number of MTCT and the prevalence of AIDS is beginning to reverse decades of steady progress in child survival. Countries such as Uganda are attempting to curb the MTCT epidemic by offering VCT (voluntary counselling and testing), PMTCT (prevention of mother-to-child transmission) and ANC (ante-natal care) services, which include the distribution of antiretroviral therapy.
