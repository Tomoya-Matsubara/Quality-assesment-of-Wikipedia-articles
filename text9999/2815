When the other structure, a shop building, burned down in [[1892]], Tech Tower became the oldest building on the Georgia Tech campus, a distinction it continues to hold more than a century later.

On [[October 20]], [[1905]], [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited the Georgia Tech campus.

In [[1978]], Tech Tower and the surrounding [[Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District|Historic District]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Near the entrance to Tech Tower, an [[historical marker]] maintained by the [http://www.georgiahistory.com/ Georgia Historical Society] commemorates this listing as well as the early [[history of Georgia Tech|history of the Georgia Tech campus]].

The Tech Tower Renovation, a restoration project, began in [[1987]], spearheaded by alumnus Eugene M. Clary's gift of new copper shingles with which to replace Tech Tower's aging roof tiles. One of these shingles and a small marker inside the Tech Tower entrance lobby commemorate Clary and his donation.

On [[May 22]], [[1998]], Tech Tower was officially renamed the Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans Administration Building in a ceremony presided over by Tech president [[G.

==Structure and appearance==
[[Image:GeorgiaTechSteamWhistle.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Georgia Tech's steam whistle, with Tech Tower in the background]]
Tech Tower is built in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style with [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] influences. The building's original specifications, according to Georgia Tech's first ''Annual Catalogue'' published in 1888, are listed as 130 feet wide and 120 feet deep.<ref>{{ cite book | title = Annual Catalogue | year = 1888 | publisher = Georgia School of Technology }}</ref> It is constructed primarily of red brick and trimmed with [[granite]]. The [[gable]]d roof, originally [[terra cotta]], was later replaced by copper shingles. The main complex of the building stands four stories high plus a basement. The tower portion stands seven stories high and is topped with four lighted ''TECH'' signs (one on each side) and a high pitched roof. The main entrance to the building is accessed by ascending a small staircase and entering a small porch which forms the base of Tech Tower. Most of the building's windows are simple rectangular frames, with the exception of those on the third floor, which are arched. The entire complex sits on the crest of a hill, giving it the appearance of being larger than it actually is.

===Surroundings===
As Tech Tower is the oldest building on the Georgia Tech campus, it has accumulated a number of peripheral [[monument]]s and sites of interest over the years. Two walkways encircle the building, including the Tower Walk, donated by the Class of [[1950]] in [[2000]]. Georgia Tech's first class memorial, a marble drinking fountain, was donated in [[1911]] by the Class of [[1903]] and is situated east of Tech Tower's main entrance. Also near the main entrance to Tech Tower is a [[marble]]d pair of benches donated by the Class of [[1925]] in memory of those who died in [[World War I]]. A few feet away stands a marbled bench memorial to Paul Howes Norcross, a 1902 Georgia Tech alumnus and former [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] president who perished in the [[M.E. Norman|''Norman'']] boat disaster of [[May 8]], [[1925]]. The headstone of [[Georgia Tech traditions#Sideways the Dog|Sideways]] the dog is located near Tech Tower's rear entrance, as is an informational placard detailing Tech Tower's early history, donated by the Class of [[1932]]. Finally, and perhaps most notably, the Georgia Tech [[Georgia Tech traditions#The Whistle|steam whistle]] sits prominently at the top of the hill near Tech Tower.

==Modern usage==
[[Image:TechTower.jpg|Tech Tower today, with its iconic ''TECH'' signage|right|thumb|300px]]
As its official name suggests, Tech Tower is primarily used for [[academic administration|administrative]] purposes. It houses the Office of the [[Registrar]], the Office of Capital Planning and Space Management (CPSM), the Internal Auditing Department, and offices for the Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning (CETL). In addition, the [[dean (education)|deans]] of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Sciences|College of Sciences]] maintain office space in Tech Tower.

Tech Tower is considered an iconic representation of Georgia Tech and, more generally, higher education in [[Atlanta]]. It is often featured in marketing materials and merchandise for the university and its silhouette is recognized throughout the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]. [[Kessler Campanile]], a stylized bell tower built on the Georgia Tech campus as part of an Institute-wide [[brand|branding]] campaign in the mid-[[1990s]], was designed to look like a modernized version of Tech Tower.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Georgia Tech Kessler Campanile | publisher = Architectural Support Services, Inc. | url = http://assi-cad.com/gatech.html | dateaccessed = 2007-02-01 }}</ref> The campanile is now featured in all Georgia Tech logos, though some have argued that Tech Tower itself would be a more appropriate symbol.<ref name="UseTheTower" />

==Stealing the T==
{{main|Georgia Tech traditions}}
A number of times, students have orchestrated complex plans to steal the huge, symbolic letter T on the Tech Tower's ''TECH'' signs, sometimes called ''climbing''. The T is then returned at the halftime of the [[homecoming]] [[college football|football]] game, and the students' achievement celebrated. Tradition dictates that the first T to be stolen should be the one facing east, as this can most easily be seen from the [[Downtown Connector]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>
===Notable thefts===
The T was first stolen in April of [[1969]] by a secret group of Georgia Tech students calling themselves the "Super Seven." The students, who were inspired by a similar prank that had taken place in [[1968]] at [[Harvard University]], planned the theft as a means of commemorating Institute President [[Edwin D. Harrison]]'s retirement. The T was returned several days later via helicopter at the behest of Atlanta mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.|Ivan Allen]].<ref name="PresidentialOpinions">{{ cite news | title = Presidential opinions change over time | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/2001-08-24/news/12 | date = 2001-08-24 | accessdate = 2007-02-01 | last = Shaw | first = Jody | work = [[The Technique]] }}</ref> The last successful stealing of the T occurred in [[1999]]; the T was not returned. In October [[2005]], a replica of the T was stolen from the Student Services Building and returned two days later.<ref>{{cite news

===Institute reaction===
The Georgia Tech administration's position on stealing the T has been varied. When the T was first stolen in 1969, interim Institute President [[Vernon Crawford]] was so upset he considered canceling classes until it was returned. Afterwards, subsequent presidents opted to [[turn a blind eye]] to the practice, with one president, [[John Patrick Crecine]], going so far as to endorse it.<ref name="PresidentialOpinions" />
{{cquote|I think stealing the <U+2018>T<U+2019> off the Tech Tower is among the all-time greatest rituals.}}
Today, stealing the T is officially prohibited. After a Georgia Tech visitor was accidentally killed while climbing the [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]] in 1999<ref>{{ cite news | title = Accident on campus claims woman's life | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/1999-07-23/news/4 | date = 1999-07-23 | accessdate = 2007-02-01 | last = Dykes | first = Jennifer | work = [[The Technique]] }}</ref>, Institute President [[G.
