'''''Law & Order''''' is <!--Do NOT change this to "was"! The series may have ended production, but the already shot episodes still exist. Just as one wouldn't say "was" for the Casablanca or another film that has already completed production-->an American police procedural and legal drama television series, created by [[Dick Wolf]] and part of the [[Law & Order (franchise)|''Law & Order'' franchise]]. It aired on [[NBC]], and in syndication on various cable networks. ''Law & Order'' premiered on September 13, 1990, and completed its 20th and final season on May 24, 2010. At the time of its cancellation, ''Law & Order'' was the longest-running crime drama on American primetime television, and tied for longest running American drama series of all time with ''[[Gunsmoke]]''; both are the second longest-running scripted series with ongoing characters after ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

Set and filmed in [[New York City]], the series follows a two-part approach: in the first half hour, the investigation of a crime and apprehension of a suspect by New York City police detectives is shown, followed by the prosecution of the defendant by the [[Manhattan District Attorney]]'s office in the second half. Plots are often based on real cases that recently made headlines.

The show has been noted for its revolving cast over the years. Its first season starred [[George Dzundza]] as Detective Sergeant [[Max Greevey]], [[Chris Noth]] as [[Mike Logan (Law & Order)|Mike Logan]], [[Dann Florek]] as Captain [[Donald Cragen]], [[Michael Moriarty]] as Executive Assistant District Attorney [[Benjamin Stone|Ben Stone]], [[Richard Brooks]] as Assistant District Attorney [[Paul Robinette]] and [[Steven Hill]] as District Attorney [[Adam Schiff (Law & Order)|Adam Schiff]]. After several cast shuffles, its final season starred [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Detective [[Cyrus Lupo]], [[Anthony Anderson]] as Detective [[Kevin Bernard]], [[S. Epatha Merkerson]] as Lieutenant [[Anita Van Buren]], [[Linus Roache]] as Executive Assistant District Attorney [[Michael Cutter]], [[Alana de la Garza]] as Assistant District Attorney [[Connie Rubirosa]] and [[Sam Waterston]] as District Attorney [[Jack McCoy]].

The success of the series has led to the creation of additional shows within the ''Law & Order'' franchise, a television film, several video games, and international adaptations of the series. It has won and been nominated for numerous awards over the years, including a number of [[Emmy Award]]s. On May 14, 2010, NBC announced that it had cancelled ''Law & Order'' and would air the final episode on May 24, 2010.<ref name="showcancel1">{{Cite news

==Production==
===History and development===
In 1988, [[Dick Wolf]] developed a concept for a new television series that would depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American criminal justice system. He initially toyed with the idea of calling it ''Night & Day'' but then hit upon the title ''Law & Order''. For the first half of each episode, the show would follow two detectives (a senior and junior detective) and their commanding officer as they investigate a violent crime. The second half of the show would center around the District Attorney's Office and the courts as two prosecutors with advice from the District Attorney himself, attempt to convict the accused. Through this, ''Law & Order'' would be able to investigate some of the larger issues of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines.<ref name="Courrier and Green 17">Courrier and Green (1999), p.&nbsp;17</ref>

Wolf took the idea to then-president of [[Universal Television]] [[Kerry McCluggage]], who pointed out the similarity to a 1963 series titled ''[[Arrest and Trial]]'' that lasted one season. The two watched the pilot of that series, in which a police officer, played by [[Ben Gazzara]], arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half, and the defense attorney, played by [[Chuck Connors]] gets the perpetrator off as the wrong guy. Wolf discovered this was the formula of the show every week, and decided that, while his detectives would occasionally be fallible as Gazzara's was, he wanted a fresh approach to the genre that would go from police procedural to prosecution with a greater degree of realism. In addition, the prosecution would be the hero instead of the defense, a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas.<ref name="Courrier and Green 17-18">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;17<U+2013>18</ref>

Initially, the show was ordered by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] for thirteen episodes with no pilot based on the concept alone. The decision was reversed by then-network head [[Barry Diller]], who loved the idea but did not believe it was a Fox show. Wolf then went to [[CBS]], which ordered a pilot, "[[Everybody's Favorite Bagman]]", written by Wolf, which centered around corrupt city officials involved with the mob. The network liked the pilot but did not order it because there were no breakout stars in the show. In the summer of 1989, NBC's top executives, [[Brandon Tartikoff]] and [[Warren Littlefield]], screened the pilot and liked it, but were concerned the intensity of the series could not be repeated on a week by week basis.<ref name="Courrier and Green 17-18" /> However, there was enough faith from executives that the series was innovative and could appeal to a wide audience that the series was ordered by NBC for a full season in 1990.<ref name="Courrier and Green 21-22">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;21<U+2013>22</ref>

===Filming===
The series is shot on location in New York City and is known for its extensive use of [[Regionalism (literature)|local color]].<ref name="APMercury">{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainmentheadlines/ci_10868230|title=Can "Law & Order" outlive "Gunsmoke"?|last=Carlson|first=Erin|date=2008-10-31|publisher=Associated Press/San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=2008-11-06}}{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref><ref name="TVGuide">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/law-order/cast/100255|title=Law and Order: Cast and details|publisher=TV Guide|accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref> In later seasons, New York City mayors [[Rudy Giuliani]] and [[Michael Bloomberg]], attorney [[William Kunstler]] and Bronx Congressman [[Jos<U+00E9> Serrano]] all have appeared on the show as themselves. Local personalities also have had recurring cameos as fictional characters, such as [[Donna Hanover]] and [[Fran Lebowitz]] as judges. On September 14, 2004, in New York City, a road leading to Pier 62 at [[Chelsea Piers]] (where the series is mostly shot) was renamed "Law & Order Way" in tribute to the series.<ref name="Street">{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/html/news/091604_commissioner_oliver_presents.shtml |title=Commissioner Oliver Presents "Law & Order Way" |work=NYC.gov |accessdate=2004-09-14}}</ref>

The music for ''Law & Order'' is composed by veteran composer [[Mike Post]]. The music is deliberately designed to be minimalist to match the abbreviated style of the series.<ref name="Courrier and Green 69">Courrier and Green (1999), p.&nbsp;69</ref> Post wrote the theme song using electric piano, guitar, and [[clarinet]].<ref name="Entertainment Weekly 1993-02-26">{{cite news | first=Lisa | last=Schwarzbaum |  title=The Jailhouse Rock | date=1993-02-26 |  url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305720,00.html | work =Entertainment Weekly |  publisher =  | accessdate = 2010-01-05 }}</ref> In addition, [[scene (fiction)|scene]] changes are accompanied by a tone generated by Post. He refers to the tone as "The Clang," while ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic Ken Tucker has referred to the sound as the "ominous ''chung CHUNG''"<ref name="Courrier and Green 69" /> and [[Richard Belzer]] as "the Dick Wolf Cash Register Sound."<ref name="Belzer On the Media">{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Scott|date=2008-12-06|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97905053|title=Richard Belzer: 'I Am Not A Cop'|work=On the Media|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> The tone consists of only two notes and was generated electronically by combining six or seven different sounds to get just the right deadbolt effect. Post has noted that one of the sounds the interlude incorporates is the sound of "five hundred Japanese men stamping their feet on a wooden floor.<ref name="Courrier and Green 69" /><ref name="Green and Dawn 60">Green and Dawn (2009), p.&nbsp;60</ref> The sound has become so associated with the ''Law & Order'' brand that it was also carried over to other series of the franchise.<ref name="Green and Dawn 60" />

Epatha Merkerson]] as Van Buren, [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Lupo, [[Anthony Anderson]] as Bernard, [[Sam Waterston]] as McCoy, [[Alana de la Garza]] as Rubirosa, and [[Linus Roache]] as Cutter.]]

For the 1988 pilot, [[George Dzundza]] and [[Chris Noth]] were cast as the original detectives, Sergeant [[Max Greevey]] and [[Mike Logan (Law & Order)|Mike Logan]].<ref name="Courrier and Green 25">Courrier and Green (1999), p.&nbsp;25</ref> Among others, Dzundza was up against [[Jerry Orbach]] for the role,<ref name="Courrier and Green 120-122" /> and the producers felt that Dzundza would be a perfect senior police officer as he was someone the producers felt they could see themselves riding along with in a police cruiser.<ref name="Courrier and Green 110-111">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;110<U+2013>111</ref> Noth and [[Michael Madsen]] were candidates for the role of Logan. Madsen initially was considered the perfect choice for the role, but, in a final reading, it was felt that Madsen's acting mannerisms were repetitive, and Noth received the role instead.<ref name="Courrier and Green 25-26">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;25<U+2013>26</ref> Rounding out the police cast, [[Dann Florek]] was cast as Captain [[Donald Cragen]].<ref name="Courrier and Green 25" />

On the prosecutor's side, [[Michael Moriarty]] was Dick Wolf's choice to play Chief Assistant District Attorney [[Benjamin Stone|Ben Stone]]. The network, however, preferred [[James Naughton]], but, in the end, Wolf's choice would prevail, and Moriarty received the role.<ref name="Courrier and Green 25" /> As his ADA, [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] and [[Eriq La Salle]] were being considered for the role of [[Paul Robinette]]. The network favored La Salle but, once again, the producers' choice prevailed, and Brooks received the role.<ref name="Courrier and Green 26">Courrier and Green (1999), pp&nbsp;26</ref> As their boss, [[Roy Thinnes]] was cast as District Attorney Alfred Wentworth.<ref name="Courrier and Green 25" />

Nearly two years passed between the pilot and production of the series. The producers held options on Dzundza, Noth, Moriarty, and Brooks. Each was paid holding money for the additional year and brought back. Florek also returned. Thinnes, however, was starring in ''[[Dark Shadows (1991 TV series)|Dark Shadows]]'' and declined to return. In his place, the producers tapped [[Steven Hill]] to play District Attorney [[Adam Schiff (Law & Order)|Adam Schiff]],<ref name="Courrier and Green 26" /> a character loosely based on real-life [[Manhattan]] DA [[Robert Morgenthau]]. Hill brought prestige and experience to the show and, as such, the producers allowed Hill to give insight on the direction he thought the character should go.<ref name="Courrier and Green 131-132">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;131<U+2013>132</ref>

Dzundza was disappointed when he realized the show would be more of an ensemble show than a show starring him. Though the cast liked his portrayal of Greevey, they increasingly felt uncomfortable around Dzundza, who was also under stress due to the constant commute between New York City and his home in Los Angeles. Dzundza quit after only one season on the show.<ref name="Courrier and Green 111">Courrier and Green (1999), p.&nbsp;111</ref> Dzundza was replaced on the show by [[Paul Sorvino]] as Detective Sergeant [[Phil Cerreta]], who was considered more even tempered than either Greevey or Logan. Sorvino was initially excited about the role, but would leave after twenty-nine episodes, citing the exhausting schedule demanded by filming of the show, a need to broaden his horizons, and the desire to preserve his vocal cords for singing [[opera]] as reasons for leaving the show.<ref name="Courrier and Green 123-125">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;123<U+2013>125</ref>

Also introduced on a recurring basis in the second season was [[Carolyn McCormick]] as Dr. [[Elizabeth Olivet]], a police psychiatrist brought in on a case-by-case basis. [[NBC]] had been pushing for the producers to add female characters to the all male cast.<ref name="Courrier and Green 144-145">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;144<U+2013>145</ref> She was added to the opening credits as "also starring" in seasons three and four<ref name="Lead">{{cite episode| title = Conspiracy| episodelink = | credits=Writers: Michael S.

[[Jerry Orbach]] was initially hesitant about starring in an hour long drama after witnessing the exhausting effect it had on his friend [[David Janssen]] on ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', but changed his mind as he got older. He had twice before auditioned for the role of the senior detective in 1988 and 1991. When Dzundza and Sorvino were picked instead of him, he made a guest appearance as a defense lawyer in the season two episode "The Wages of Love." While there, Orbach heard Sorvino raving about the quality of the show and how Sorvino believed he had found a winning series to do. After Sorvino's departure during the third season, Orbach decided to audition a third time and was given the role of Detective [[Lennie Briscoe]].<ref name="Courrier and Green 120-122">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;120<U+2013>122</ref>

By the end of the third season, network executives still felt the show did not have enough female characters. On the orders of [[Warren Littlefield]], new female characters had to be added to the cast or the show would face possible cancellation on its relegated Friday night time slot. Wolf realized that, since there were only six characters on the show, someone had to be fired. He chose Florek and Brooks, and later said it was the hardest two phone calls he had ever made. Though producers initially claimed the firings, especially Brooks, who was said not to get along with Moriarty, were for other reasons, Wolf confirmed that the firings were on the orders of Littlefield.<ref name="Courrier and Green 33-34">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;33<U+2013>34</ref> To replace Florek, [[S. Epatha Merkerson]] was cast as Lieutenant [[Anita Van Buren]].<ref name="Courrier and Green 115-117">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;115<U+2013>117</ref> [[Jill Hennessy]] replaced Brooks as Assistant District Attorney [[Claire Kincaid]].<ref name="Courrier and Green 128-131">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;128<U+2013>131</ref>

Meanwhile, Moriarty's behavior both on and off the set became problematic for Wolf. After a public statement in which Moriarty called Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] a "psychopathic Nazi" for her efforts to censor television violence, Moriarty engaged in a verbal confrontation with Reno at a dinner in Washington, D.C. Wolf asked Moriarty to tone down his comments, and Moriarty responded by quitting the show the next week. To replace Moriarty, [[Sam Waterston]] was Wolf's first choice to join the cast as Executive Assistant District Attorney [[Jack McCoy]], a character markedly different from Moriarty's Stone in that McCoy was conceived as more emotionally stable and having more sex appeal than Stone.<ref name="Courrier and Green 35-37">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;35<U+2013>37</ref>

Wolf fired Noth when his contract ended at the end of season five because he felt that Briscoe and Logan were too alike and the writers were having trouble finding ways to write them since they agreed on everything. Noth had been disgruntled with the show since the firings of Florek and Brooks, and remained embittered against Wolf, who he felt was not a friend to his actors. The decision to fire Noth was extremely controversial with fans and critics alike, who felt that Noth's absence left a void on the show that was never filled. Noth was replaced by [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Detective [[Rey Curtis]], who was hired in an attempt to find an actor even sexier than Noth to join the cast.<ref name="Courrier and Green 34-35">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;34<U+2013>35</ref>

Hennessy chose not to renew her three year contract at the end of the sixth season to pursue other projects.<ref name="Courrier and Green 130">Courrier and Green (1999), p.&nbsp;130</ref> She was replaced by [[Carey Lowell]] as Assistant District Attorney [[Jamie Ross (Law & Order)|Jamie Ross]]. Lowell remained with the show for two seasons until the end of season eight, when she left the show to spend more time with her daughter.<ref name="Courrier and Green 134-135">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;134<U+2013>135</ref> Lowell was replaced by [[Angie Harmon]] as Assistant District Attorney [[Abbie Carmichael]], who was conceived as being much louder and outspoken than any of her predecessors. Harmon auditioned with eighty-five other women, including [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]], for the role, and was picked after Wolf heard her Texan accent.<ref name="Courrier and Green 333-335">Courrier and Green (1999), pp.&nbsp;333<U+2013>335</ref>

Bratt left the series at the end of the ninth season, stating it was an amicable departure and he expected to eventually return for guest appearances.<ref name="Bratt departure">{{cite news|last=Huff|first=Richard|date=1999-04-30|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1999/04/30/1999-04-30_bratt_leaving__law___order__.html|title=Bratt Leaving 'Law & Order'; 'Ally' Doc Joining Force |publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Jesse L.

After twelve years on ''Law & Order'', Orbach announced in 2004 that he was leaving the show for the third ''Law & Order'' spin-off, ''[[Law & Order: Trial by Jury]]''.

The fifteenth season would also see the departure of R<U+00F6>hm mid-season.

For most of ''Law & Order'''s run, the [[cold open]] or lead-in of the show began with the discovery of a crime, usually a murder. The scene typically began with a slice of everyday life in New York. The characters would then discover the crime victim, or sometimes the crime would occur in a public place during the scene and they would be witnesses or one of them would be a victim. However, in the first two seasons the characters discovering the crime would generally be beat cops.  In the middle of the 17th season, the lead-in was changed to a short scene of the murder victim in his/her last hours, similarly to ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent|Criminal Intent]]'', followed by a cut to the police investigating the dead body.
 
The police are represented in the show by [[Manhattan]]'s fictional 27th [[police precinct|Precinct]] and two homicide detectives, a senior partner and a junior partner, who report directly to their boss, a police [[Police captain|captain]] or [[lieutenant]]. The detectives investigate the crime, collect evidence (with the help of the Crime Scene Unit), and interview witnesses, then regularly report to their commanding officer. The evidence leads to the arrest of one or more suspects. The matter then is taken over by a pair of prosecutors, a senior and junior [[assistant district attorney]] (ADA) from the office of the [[New York County District Attorney]] (DA). They discuss deals, prepare the witnesses and evidence, and conduct the people's case in the trial. Both the detectives and prosecutors work together and with the [[medical examiner]]'s office, the [[crime lab]]oratory, and psychologists or psychiatrists contracted from the police department or the district attorney's office, depending on who is needed to testify.

During the preliminary crime scene examination, the featured detectives make their first observations and will come up with theories followed by a witticism or two, before the [[title sequence]] begins. The detectives often have few or no good clues<U+2014>they might not even know the victim's identity<U+2014>and must usually chase several dead ends before finding a likely suspect. Towards the middle of a show, the police begin working with the prosecutors to make the arrest, though sometimes the ADAs will on occasion appear early on to arrange a plea-for-information deal or to decide if the detectives have enough evidence for [[search warrant]](s) and/or [[arrest warrant]](s) before arresting the suspect or suspects and an [[arraignment]] scene will follow. The police may reappear to testify in court or to arrest another suspect, but most investigation in the second segment is done by the ADAs, who always consult with the District Attorney for advice on the case.  (In real life, the DA's investigation unit would do any investigating needed to strengthen a case for the prosecution, as the ADAs would be busy with paperwork and prepping witnesses for court.) If the case is very weak then the police would re-investigate.

Unlike many legal dramas (e.g. ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]''), the court proceedings are shown from the prosecution's point of view, with the regular characters trying to prove the defendant's guilt, not innocence. The second half usually opens with the [[arraignment]] of defendants and proceeds to trial preparation, including legal research and plea negotiations. Some episodes include legal proceedings beyond the testimony of witnesses, including [[indictment]]s before [[grand juries]]; [[motion (legal)|motion]] hearings, often concerning [[rules of evidence|admissibility of evidence]]; [[jury selection]]; and [[allocution]]s, usually as a result of plea bargains. Many episodes employ [[In limine|motions to suppress evidence]] as a plot device, and most of these end with evidence or statements being suppressed, often on a [[technicality]]. This usually begins with the service of the motion to the ADAs, follows with argument and case citations of precedent before a judge in some setting, and concludes with visual reaction of the winning or losing attorney.  Sometimes the case might go before an [[appellate court]].

In many episodes, the crime first investigated is not the one that goes to court (a person related to the deceased kills the killer, someone else is found to be involved, evidence of a separate crime is discovered, etc.). This other incident then becomes the focus of investigation.  Although the crimes usually depicted in the series are violations of state law, the ramifications of the story may include [[federal crime in the United States|federal crimes]].  In that case, as well as the city police department and the state-level DA and court systems, the story would also involve members of the corresponding federal organizations: the [[FBI]] (or other agencies such as the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]]), the [[U.S. attorney]]'s office, and the [[United States federal court|federal court]] system.  There would then often be some conflict between the two levels of jurisdiction, depicted from the point of view of the regular characters.

Not all episodes of the show followed the strict formula. Some maximized the investigation of the crime by the police, while some others put more emphasis on the prosecution of the crime in court. The 1991 episode "[[The Violence of Summer (Law & Order episode)|The Violence of Summer]]" turned the format of the show around as the prosecution presented its case first followed by the police investigation of the crime. The 1996 episode "[[Aftershock (Law & Order episode)|Aftershock]]", which closed the sixth season, abandoned the two-part structure in order to follow the lead characters' reactions to having witnessed an execution, culminating in the accidental death of ADA [[Claire Kincaid]]. The series's final episode, aired on May 24, 2010, and titled "[[Rubber Room (Law & Order)|Rubber Room]]", was focused almost entirely on the investigation side, with a subplot involving [[Anita Van Buren]] undergoing tests for cancer.

==="Ripped from the headlines"===
Often the plot of an initial portion of an episode resembles a recognizable aspect of an actual case.<ref name="aol">{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.aol.com/2009/10/22/law-and-order-fictionalizes-taconic-tragedy-is-it-too-soon?icid=main|title='Law & Order' Fictionalizes the Taconic Parkway Tragedy <U+2013> Is It Too Soon?|last=Conroy|first=Tom|date=2009-10-23|publisher=[[AOL|AOL Television]]|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref> In early seasons, the details of these cases often closely followed the real stories, such as the season one episode "[[Subterranean Homeboy Blues]]", which had a woman shooting two attempted muggers and paralleled the [[Bernhard Goetz]] case. Another early episode focused on a racially charged rape case that mimicked the [[Tawana Brawley]] case. Another episode, called "Sick", had elements similar to the [[Michael Jackson]] sexual abuse case. This "ripped from the headlines" style is reflected in the opening credits sequence that evolves from newspaper [[halftone]]s to high-resolution photos. Later seasons would take real life cases as inspiration but diverge more from the facts. Often this would be done by increasing the severity of the crime in question, usually by adding a murder. As a result, the plot would tend to veer significantly from the actual events that may have inspired the episode.<ref name="aol" /> Promotional advertisements of episodes with close real-life case parallels regularly use the "ripped from the headlines" phrase, although a textual disclaimer, within the actual episode, emphasizes that the story and characters are fictional. This format lends itself to exploring different outcomes or motives that similar events could have had under other circumstances.

Some real life crime victims have felt used and exploited,<ref name="aol" /> with one lawyer, Ravi Batra, going so far as to sue the show in 2004 for [[libel]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/05/AR2009030504029.html |title=Ripped From the Headlines <U+2013> and From the Heart|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=2009-03-08|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref>  The show aired an episode entitled "Floater" on November 12, 2003, relating to a corruption scandal in the Brooklyn Supreme Court in which a judge accepted [[bribe]]s in return for giving litigants preferential treatment.<ref name="nycourts1">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/pdfs/2008/2008_30821.pdf |title=''Batra v Wolf'', 2008 NY Slip Op 30821(U)|format=PDF |date=March 14, 2008 |publisher=Supreme Court, New York County |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref>  The episode was "ripped from the headlines" of the case of [[Gerald Garson]], a New York Supreme Court Justice accused (and later convicted) of bribery.<ref name="nycourts1"/>

The chairman of [[NBC Universal]] Television Entertainment, Jeff Gaspin, stated: "The full measure of the collective contributions made by Dick Wolf and his ''Law & Order'' franchise over the last two decades to the success of NBC and Universal Media Studios cannot be overstated.

Angela Bromstad, President, Primetime Entertainment, NBC and Universal Media Studios, said, "''Law & Order'' has been one of the most successful franchises in the history of television, which is why it is so critical that we continue this important brand and our relationship with Dick Wolf and his team with ''L&O: LA'' and ''Law & Order: SVU''."<ref name="showcancel2" />

Following the cancellation announcement, Wolf announced that he still hoped to continue the series, and stated that he was seeking "other offers" from potential outlets to air the series. Wolf also discussed the possibility of airing a two hour TV film on NBC to conclude ''Law & Order'', but said that such a plan had been delayed until he had exhausted every other possibility for continuing the series. Wolf did not specify whether NBC had already offered to air such a movie.<ref name=nytimesnewhome />

Dick Wolf stated that, "The flagship series is in a medically induced coma, waiting for a life-saving medicine." Wolf was pressuring the series' producer [[NBC Universal|NBC/Universal Media Studios]] to make a deal with [[TNT (TV network)|TNT]], which holds syndication rights to the show, for originals if an acceptable license fee could be bargained.

The longevity and success of ''Law & Order'' has spawned a number of series and a television film that all use the name ''Law & Order''. Although there were fears initially that the failure of such shows could hurt the original series, it was felt the brand name was needed because of the commercial desirability such a brand name creates.<ref name="Green and Dawn 10-11">Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&nbsp;10<U+2013>11</ref> To differentiate it from other series in the franchise, ''Law & Order'' is often referred to as "The Mother Ship" by producers and critics.<ref name="Green and Dawn 2">Green and Dawn (2009), p.&nbsp;2</ref>
