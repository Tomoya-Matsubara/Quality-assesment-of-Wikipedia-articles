'''Mytilene''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+039C><U+03C5><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03B7>) is a town and a former [[Communities and Municipalities of Greece|municipality]] on the island of [[Lesbos]], [[North Aegean]], [[Greece]]. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality [[Lesbos]], of which it is a municipal unit.<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref> It is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the island of Lesbos.  Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is also the seat of a metropolitan [[bishop]] of the [[Orthodox church]].

==Geography==
Mytilene is located in the southeastern part of the island, north and east of the Bay of Gera. It has a land area of {{convert|107.46|km2}} and a population of 36,196 inhabitants (2001). With a [[population density]] of 336.8/km<U+00B2> it is by far the most densely populated municipal unit in Lesbos. The next largest towns in the municipal unit are Varei<U+00E1> (pop. 1,254), P<U+00E1>mfila (1,247), M<U+00F3>ria (1,207), and Loutr<U+00E1> (1,118). The [[Greek National Road 36]] connects Mytilene with [[Kalloni]]. Farmlands surround Mytilene, the mountains cover the west and to the north. The [[Mytilene International Airport|airport]] is located a few kilometres south of town.

==Province==
The province of Mytilene ({{lang-el|<U+0395><U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03C7><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+039C><U+03C5><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2>}}) was one of the [[provinces of Greece|provinces]] of the Lesbos Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipal units Mytilene, [[Agiasos]], [[Evergetoulas]], [[Gera, Greece|Gera]], [[Loutropoli Thermis]], [[Mantamados]] and [[Polichnitos]].<ref name=census91>{{PDFlink|[http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00086.pdf Detailed census results 1991]|39&nbsp;MB}} {{el icon}} {{fr icon}}</ref> It was abolished in 2006.

==History==

[[File:Port Mytilene.jpg|thumb|View of the port, with the dome of St Therapon.]]

As an ancient city, lying off the east coast, Mytilene was initially confined to a small island just offshore that later was joined to [[Lesbos]], creating a north and south harbour.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Mytilene contested successfully with [[Methymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the 7th century BC and became the centre of the island<U+2019>s prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece|Seven Sages of ancient Greece]]). The city was famed for its great output of [[electrum]] coins struck from the late 6th through mid-4th centuries BC.<ref>[http://www.asiaminorcoins.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=56 Asia Minor Coins - ancient coins of Mytilene]</ref>  Mytilene revolted against Athens in 428 BC but was overcome by an Athenian expeditionary force.  The Athenian public assembly voted to massacre all the men of the city and to sell the women and children into slavery but [[Mytilenian Debate|changed its mind]] the next day.  A fast [[trireme]] sailed the {{convert|186|nmi|km}} in less than a day and brought the decision to cancel the massacre.

[[Aristotle]] lived on Mytilene for two years, 337-335 BC, with his friend and successor, [[Theophrastus]] (a native of the island), after becoming the tutor to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], son of King [[Philip II of Macedon]].<ref>[http://www.ivu.org/history/greece_rome/theophrastus.html Bio of Theophrastus] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/authors/about_aristotle.html Grade Saver bio on Aristotle] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><!---but not Alexander the Great just yet. That was later--->

The Romans, among whom was a young [[military career of Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar]], successfully besieged Mytilene in 80 BC.  Although Mytilene supported the losing side in most of the great wars of the 1st century BC her statesmen succeeded in convincing Rome of her support of the new ruler of the Mediterranean and the city flourished in Roman times.

In AD 56 [[Paul_of_Tarsus#Third_missionary_journey|Paul the Apostle]] stopped there on the return trip of his third missionary journey({{bibleverse||Acts|20:14|KJV}}). The novel ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'', by [[Longus]],  is set in the country around it and opens with a   description of the city.

In the Middle Ages, it was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It was occupied for some time by the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuqs]] under [[Tzachas of Smyrna]] in 1085. In 1198, the [[Republic of Venice]] obtained the right to commerce from the city's port. In the 13th century, it was captured by the [[Emperor of Nicaea]], [[Theodore I Laskaris]]. In 1335 the Byzantines, with the help of Ottoman forces, reconquered the island, then property of the Genoese nobleman Domenico Cattaneo. In 1354 emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] gave to the Genoese adventurer [[Francesco I Gattilusio|Francesco Gattilusio]], who married his sister, Maria.  They renovated the fortress in 1373 and itt remained in Genoese hands until 1462, when it was captured by the Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed II]].

==Education==
There are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]]. Here also is [[Rector (academia)#Academic rectors in Europe|the Rector]], the central administration of the Foundation{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}, the Central Library and the Research Committee of Aegean University. The University of Aegean is housed in privately owned buildings, in rented buildings located in the city centre, and in modern buildings on University Hill.

Mytilene has a port with ferries to the nearby islands of [[Lemnos]] and [[Chios]] and [[Ayval<U+0131>k]] and at times Dikili in Turkey. The port also serves the mainland cities of [[Piraeus]], [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]]. One ship, named during the 2001 [[IAAF]] games in [[Edmonton]] ''Aeolos Kenteris'', after [[Kostas Kenteris]], used to serve this city (his hometown) with 6-hour routes from Athens and Thessaloniki. The main port serving Mytilene on the Greek mainland is [[Piraeus]].

The city produces [[ouzo]]. There are more than 15 commercial producers on the island.

The city exports [[sardines]] harvested from the Bay of [[Kalloni]] and [[olive oil]] and [[woodwork]].

==Archaeology==
{{wide image|Panorama Mytilini.jpg|650px|<center>Panorama of Mytilene.</center>.}}

Archaeological investigations at Mytilene began in the late 19th century when Robert Koldewey (later excavator of Babylon) and a group of German colleagues spent many months on the island preparing plans of the visible remains at various ancient sites like Mytilene.  Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in that city) on the hill on the western side of town.  Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect Vitruvius had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

[[File:Statue_mytilene.jpg|thumb|The [[Statue of Liberty (Mytilene)|Liberty Statue of Mytilene]].]]

Archaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Medieval Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era.  The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses.  Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents.  Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves some remained.  The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Turks built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.

Other excavations done jointly with the K' Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a "vampire" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century CE) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares.  A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the "House of Menander" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Archaeological]] Service under the direction of the archeologist Mme. Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.
