'''Arno Schirokauer''' (1899 - 24 May 1954, [[Baltimore]]<ref>'In Memoriam: Arno Schirokauer', ''Modern language notes'', Vol. 71 (1956), p. 1</ref>) was a German-Jewish literary scholar, best known for his biography of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]].

In 1939 Schirokauer managed to travel to [[Havana, Cuba]] and on to [[Memphis]]. There he taught at [[Rhodes College|Southwestern College]] as a Visiting Lecturer in Medieval Studies - his salary provided by other Jews in Memphis, since college rules prohibited non-Christian faculty - until he moved on to the Carl Schurz Foundation of Philadelphia.<ref>Selma S.
