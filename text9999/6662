'''Knowle West''' is a neighbourhood situated on a low plateau in the south of [[Bristol]], England, about {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the centre of the city. Most of the area is coterminous with the [[Filwood (ward)|Filwood]] ward of [[Bristol City Council]], although a small part of the estate lies within [[Knowle, Bristol|Knowle]] ward to the east. To the west are [[Bishopsworth]] and [[Hartcliffe]]. To the north are [[Bedminster, Bristol|Bedminster]] and [[Windmill Hill, Bristol|Windmill Hill]] and to the south [[Whitchurch Park (ward)|Whitchurch Park]] and [[Hengrove]]. The population as of 2008 was estimated as 11,787. The area is approximately {{convert|1.26|sqmi|km2}} in extent.

There is evidence of late [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlements in the area. At the time of the [[Domesday Book]], Knowle was a rural area assessed at a taxable value of two [[Weregild|geld]] units. Knowle West remained rural in character until the 1930s when a [[council house|council housing]] estate was developed to provide homes for Bristolians displaced by slum clearance in the centre of the city.

Famous former residents include the musician [[Tricky]], the boxer [[Dixie Brown]] and late 1950s [[rock and roll]] band [[The Eagles (UK band)|The Eagles]]. There are five schools and four churches in Knowle West, as well as a number of open spaces, community centres, youth clubs and shopping facilities. Community activities include the Knowle West Media Centre, the Residents' Planning Group and the Knowle West Health Association. There are no major employers in Knowle West but there are many small local enterprises and larger businesses on nearby trading estates. The closure of the [[Imperial Tobacco]] factory at nearby [[Hartcliffe]] in 1990 caused a large number of job losses. Just under a third of the residents are classed as economically inactive and the area is one of the most economically deprived in Bristol.<ref name="TES, Merrywood" /> Knowle West has relatively high indices of crime and drug use, but community efforts to combat this have had some success.

There are a number of small community enterprises in the area, but most of those in work need to drive to other parts of Bristol. The Bristol City Council ''Baseline Briefing'' notes that employment opportunities for those without a car are limited<ref name=BaseBrief1.22>Baseline Briefing: Part 1, p. 22</ref> There is a retail park on the former Imperial Tobacco factory site in Hartcliffe, which has plans for further development.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Heady/story-12779053-detail/story.html |title=Plans for part of ex-tobacco factory site could bring 200 jobs |first= |last=Staff |work=thisisbristol.co.uk |publisher=Northcliffe Media |date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref> In addition, South Bristol Business Park was built on the former Filwood playing fields in the early 21st century.<ref>Filwood Park Playing Fields, p.7</ref>  It was reported that 2,300 residents had local employment in 2008 and 3,264 were classed as economically inactive; that is to say they were not employed and not actively seeking employment.<ref group="note">{{cite web |url= http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/labour-market/people-not-in-work/economic-inactivity |title=Economic Inactivity|first= |last= |work=UK National Statistics|publisher= UK Statistics Authority  |year=2011  |quote=Economically inactive people are not in work and do not meet the internationally agreed definition of unemployment.

===Deprivation===
Six out of eight areas in Knowle West are ranked as being economically deprived.<ref>Filwood Ward Profile 2008, p. 9</ref> The closure of the [[Imperial Tobacco]] factory at nearby [[Hartcliffe]] in 1990 meant the loss of 5,000 jobs and an estimated further 20,000 jobs in service and supporting industries throughout South Bristol. A [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] report noted that this had a seriously negative effect on the area as many people in Knowle West and neighbouring areas lost the opportunity for "manual and semi-skilled employment".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmodpm/1207/120722.htm |title=Hartcliffe and Withywood Community Partnership Background Information|first= |last= |work=House of Commons - Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing, Planning, Local Government and the Regions - Memoranda |publisher=House of Commons|date=28 October 2002|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1995 noted high drug use and associated crime and reported on the establishment of Knowle West Against Drugs, led by local parents concerned about these problems.<ref name=indykwad>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/war-on-drugs-becomes-family-affair-1596047.html |title=War on drugs becomes family affair |first=Michael |last=Prestage |work=[[The Independent]] |date= 13 August 1995|publisher=[[Independent News & Media|INM]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0951-9467 |oclc=185201487 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> In 2006, ''[[BBC News]]'' said "Knowle West has more than its share of social problems.

''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2007 reported "Fed up with the media's view of their community as a hub for drug use, crime and antisocial behaviour, the residents of one of Britain's most notorious housing estates decided to fight back." The article noted that projects such as Knowle West Media were having a positive impact, "Those kids coming out of the media centre aren't the criminals and layabouts everyone expects from Knowle West; they're film-makers, photographers and designers."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/jan/17/communities.guardiansocietysupplement |title=How the Westers won |first= Annie|last=Kelly |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 January 2007 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> According to police statistics the levels of crime and [[anti-social behaviour]] (ASB) in Knowle West are above average for England and Wales, with 241 crimes and ASB incidents reported in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.police.uk/crime/?q=Knowle,%20Bristol,%20City%20of%20Bristol%20BS4,%20UK#neighbourhood |title=Crime maps for Filwood|first= |last=
