==Playing style==
[[File:Mike Cammalleri behind 2011-03-12.JPG|170px|thumb|Cammalleri has played both at centre and the wing during his NHL career|alt=Back view of a hockey player as he leans forward.  He is in a red white and blue uniform wearing the number 13 on his back.]]
Though he stands five feet, nine inches tall, Cammalleri's teammates have argued his small stature is not a drawback.  While at Michigan, teammate Craig Murray said that "a lot of people look at his size and they hold it against him, but there"s no one stronger out there." On the ice, Cammalleri says he tries to play bigger than his opponents.<ref name="Michigan2001" />  His coach at Michigan, [[Red Berenson]], agreed. He stated that Cammalleri played like he was "6-foot-4" with the puck and could beat any opponent one-on-one.<ref name="NCAAProFile" />  ''[[The Hockey News]]'' rates his offensive skills and intelligence on the ice as his greatest strength, but notes that he can be inconsistent away from the puck.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forecaster.thehockeynews.com/hockeynews/hockey/player.cgi?2476 |title=Michael Cammalleri profile |work=The Hockey News |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}</ref> He is a natural goal scorer, and is capable of playing at either [[centre (ice hockey)|centre]] or on the [[winger (ice hockey)|wing]].<ref name="2008FlamesTrade" /> Injuries have been a concern for Cammalleri; his time in Montreal were marked by both shoulder and knee problems.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rioux |first=Benoit |url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2011/08/24/cammalleri-has-new-outlook |title=Cammalleri has new outlook |work=Winnipeg Sun| date=August 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Cammalleri and his girlfriend Jennifer have a daughter, born in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fr.canoe.ca/sports/nouvelles/hockey/lnh/archives/2012/01/20120115-211535.html |title=Cammalleri au repos |language=French |publisher=Canoe/QMI Agency |date=January 15, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}</ref> The couple have been involved in numerous charitable endeavours since Cammalleri joined the NHL.  He has focused on children's charities, supporting the [[Starlight Children's Foundation]], [[World Vision International|World Vision]] and the SickKids Foundation in Toronto among others.<ref name="JeanBeliveauTrophy">{{cite news |last=Tougas |first=Marc |url=http://www.cyberpresse.ca/sports/hockey/201109/26/01-4451540-cammalleri-recoit-le-trophee-jean-beliveau.php |title=Cammalleri re<U+00E7>oit le troph<U+00E9>e Jean-B<U+00E9>liveau |language=French |work=La Presse |date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}</ref>  During his time in Montreal, Cammalleri also supported the military via his "Cammy's Heroes" program.
