'''Percy Francis Westerman''' ([[1876]] - [[February 22]], [[1959]]) was a prolific [[author]] of [[children's literature]], many of his books [[adventure]]s with [[military]] themes.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Portsmouth]], [[England]] in 1876, and educated at [[Portsmouth Grammar School]], before taking up a clerical appointment at Portsmouth Dockyard at the age of twenty. He married Florence Wager, of Portsmouth, in 1900. Always keen sailors, they spent part of their honeymoon sailing in the [[Solent]]. Their son, [[John F.C. Westerman]], born in 1901, also wrote adventure books for boys. 

At the age of 70 he was reluctantly forced by a fall to leave his houseboat for dry land, but he continued writing apace. He died at the age of 82, and his last book, ''Mistaken Identity'' was published posthumously in 1959.

==Writing career==
His writing career allegedly began with a sixpence bet made with his wife that he could write a better story than the one he was reading to his son, who was at the time ill with [[chickenpox]].

His first book for boys, 'A Lad of Grit', was published by [[Blackie and Son Limited]] in 1908. In the same year, [[Baden-Powell]] founded the Scouting movement, which strongly influenced many of Westerman's books - he was a particularly keen supporter of the Sea Scouts.

He published a further three books in 1911, which were so successful that he gave up his Admiralty appointment that year to become a full-time author. He lived on board a [[houseboat]] - a converted [[Thame]]s[[ barge]] - on the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]], where he wrote the majority of his books.

During the [[World War I|First World War]] he was initially employed on coastal duties by the [[Royal Navy]], but in 1918 he was commissioned, like [[W. E. Johns]], in the [[Royal Flying Corps]], as an instructor of [[navigation]]. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he commanded a company of the [[Dorset]] [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]]. He wrote to Blackie of his service in the two wars that "neither appointment seriously interfered with my literary output."

During the 1930s Westerman was voted the most popular author of stories for boys.  His books sold over one and a half million copies in his lifetime (total sales at his death were 1,599,000). He published at least 174 books, with 12 different firms.
