'''Vallabhbhai Patel''' ({{lang-gu|<U+0AB5><U+0AB2><U+0ACD><U+0AB2><U+0AAD><U+0AAD><U+0ABE><U+0A88> <U+0AAA><U+0A9F><U+0AC7><U+0AB2>}}, {{IPA2|<U+028B><U+0259>l<U+02D0><U+0259>b<U+02B1><U+02D0><U+00E4>i p<U+028C><U+0288>el|pron|Hi-Sardar_Vallabhbhai_Patel.ogg}}) (31 October 1875 <U+2013> 15 December 1950) was a [[politics of India|political]] and social leader of India who played a major role in the country's [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] and guided its [[Political integration of India|integration]] into a united, independent nation. In India and across the world, he was often addressed as '''[[Sardar]]''' ({{lang-gu|<U+0AB8><U+0AB0><U+0AA6><U+0ABE><U+0AB0>}}, {{IPA2|s<U+0259><U+027E>d<U+032A><U+00E4><U+027E>}}), which means ''Chief'' in many [[languages of India]].

Raised in the countryside of [[Gujarat]] and largely self-educated, Vallabhbhai Patel was employed in successful practice as a [[lawyer]] when he was first inspired by the work and philosophy of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Patel subsequently organised the peasants of [[Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha|Kheda]], [[Borsad]], and [[Bardoli]] in Gujarat in [[nonviolence|non-violent]] [[civil disobedience]] against oppressive policies imposed by the [[British Raj]]; in this role, he became one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He rose to the leadership of the [[Indian National Congress]] and was at the forefront of rebellions and political events, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937, and promoting the [[Quit India movement]].

As the first [[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Home Minister]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of India]], Patel organised relief for refugees in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Delhi]], and led efforts to restore peace across the nation. Patel took charge of the task to forge a united India from the 565 semi-autonomous [[Indian Princely States|princely states]] and British-era colonial provinces. Using frank diplomacy backed with the option (and the use) of military action, Patel's leadership enabled the accession of almost every princely state. Hailed as the '''Iron Man of India''', he is also remembered as the "Patron Saint" of India's civil servants for establishing [[Indian Administrative Service|modern all-India services]]. Patel was also one of the earliest proponents of property rights and free enterprise in India.

==Early life==
[[Image:Youngersardar.png|thumb|left|Young Vallabhbhai, when a student.]]
Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel was born at his maternal uncle's house in [[Nadiad]], [[Gujarat]]. His actual date of birth was never officially recorded<U+2014>Patel entered 31 October as his date of birth on his matriculation examination papers.<ref>{{cite book

They lived in the village of [[Karamsad]], in the [[Kheda]] district where Jhaverbhai owned a [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]]. Somabhai, Narsibhai and [[Vithalbhai Patel]] (also a future political leader) were his elder brothers. He had a younger brother, Kashibhai and a sister, Dahiba. As a young boy, Patel helped his father in the fields and bimonthly kept a day-long [[fasting|fast]], abstaining from food and water<U+2014>a [[Hindu]] cultural observance that enabled him to develop physical toughness.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> When he was eighteen years old, Patel's marriage was arranged with Jhaverba, a young girl of twelve or thirteen years from a nearby village. As per custom, the young bride would continue to reside with her parents until her husband started earning and could establish their household.

Patel travelled to attend schools in Nadiad, Petlad and Borsad, living self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character<U+2014>a popular anecdote recounts how he lanced his own painful [[boil]] without hesitation, even as the barber supposed to do it trembled.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Patel passed his [[matriculation]] at the late age of 22; at this point, he was generally regarded by his elders as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. But Patel himself harboured a plan<U+2014>he would study to become a [[lawyer]], work and save funds, travel to England and study to become a [[barrister]].<ref>{{cite book

 | title = Patel: A Life
 | pages = 13
}}</ref> Patel spent years away from his family, studying on his own with books borrowed from other lawyers and passed examinations within two years. Fetching Jhaverba from her parents' home, Patel set up his household in [[Godhra]] and enrolled at the bar. During the many years it took him to save money, Vallabhbhai<U+2014>now a pleader<U+2014>earned a reputation as a fierce and skilled lawyer. His wife bore him a daughter, [[Manibehn Patel|Manibehn]], in 1904 and later a son, [[Dahyabhai Patel|Dahyabhai]], in 1906. Patel also cared for a friend suffering from [[Bubonic plague]] when it swept across Gujarat. When Patel himself came down with the disease, he immediately sent his family to safety, left his home and moved into an isolated house in Nadiad (by other accounts, Patel spent this time in a dilapidated temple); there, he recovered slowly.<ref>{{cite book

Patel practised law in Godhra, Borsad and Anand while taking on the financial burdens of his homestead in Karamsad. When he had saved enough for England and applied for a pass and a ticket, they arrived in the name of "V. J. Patel," at Vithalbhai's home, who bore the same initials. Having harboured his own plans to study in England, Vithalbhai remonstrated to his younger brother that it would be disreputable for an older brother to follow his younger brother. In keeping with concerns for his family's honour, Patel allowed Vithalbhai to go in his place.<ref>{{cite book

In 1909, Patel's wife Jhaverba was hospitalised in [[Mumbai]] (then Bombay) to undergo a major surgical operation for cancer. Her health suddenly worsened and despite successful emergency surgery, she died in the hospital. Patel was given a note informing him of his wife's demise as he was cross-examining a witness in court. As per others who witnessed, Patel read the note, pocketed it and continued to intensely cross-examine the witness and won the case. He broke the news to others only after the proceedings had ended.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Patel himself decided against marrying again. He raised his children with the help of his family and sent them to English-medium schools in Mumbai. At the age of 36, he journeyed to England and enrolled at the [[Middle Temple]] Inn in London. Finishing a 36-month course in 30 months, Patel topped his class despite having no previous college background. Returning to India, Patel settled in the city of [[Ahmedabad]] and became one of the city's most successful barristers. Wearing European-style clothes and urbane mannerisms, he also became a skilled [[Contract bridge|bridge]] player. Patel nurtured ambitions to expand his practise and accumulate great wealth and to provide his children with modern education. He had also made a pact with his brother Vithalbhai to support his entry into politics in the [[Bombay Presidency]], while Patel himself would remain in Ahmedabad and provide for the family.<ref>{{cite book

==Fighting for independence==
[[Image:Sardar2 (Small).jpg|thumb|left|Vallabhbhai Patel at the height of his success as a lawyer]]
{{seealso|Indian independence movement|Mahatma Gandhi}}
At the urging of his friends, Patel won an election to become the sanitation commissioner of Ahmedabad in 1917. While often clashing with British officials on civic issues, he did not show any interest in politics. Upon hearing of [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]], he joked to [[Ganesh Vasudev Mavlankar|Mavlankar]] that Gandhi would "ask you if you know how to sift pebbles from wheat. And that is supposed to bring independence."<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> But Patel was deeply impressed when Gandhi defied the British in [[Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha|Champaran]] for the sake of the area's oppressed farmers. Against the grain of Indian politicians of the time, Gandhi wore Indian-style clothes and emphasised the use of one's mother tongue or any Indian language as opposed to English<U+2014>the lingua franca of India's intellectuals. Patel was particularly attracted to Gandhi's inclination to action<U+2014>apart from a resolution condemning the arrest of political leader [[Annie Besant]], Gandhi proposed that volunteers march peacefully demanding to meet her.

Patel gave a speech in Borsad in September 1917, encouraging Indians nationwide to sign Gandhi's petition demanding ''[[Swaraj]]''<U+2014>independence<U+2014>from the British. Meeting Gandhi a month later at the Gujarat Political Conference in [[Godhra]], Patel became the secretary of the [[Gujarat Sabha]]<U+2014>a public body which would become the Gujarati arm of the [[Indian National Congress]]<U+2014>at Gandhi's encouragement. Patel now energetically fought against ''[[veth]]''<U+2014>the forced servitude of Indians to Europeans<U+2014>and organised relief efforts in wake of [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[famine]] in [[Kheda]].<ref>{{cite book

===Satyagraha in Gujarat===
{{seealso|Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha|Bardoli Satyagraha}}
[[Image:SardarPatel.jpg|thumb|Vallabhbhai Patel, after his embrace of Gandhi's philosophy and a completely Indian way of life]]
Supported by Congress volunteers [[Narhari Parikh]], [[Mohanlal Pandya]] and [[Abbas Tyabji]], Vallabhbhai Patel began a village-to-village tour in the Kheda district, documenting grievances and asking villagers for their support for a statewide revolt by refusing the payment of taxes. Patel emphasised potential hardships with the need for complete unity and non-violence despite any provocation. He received enthusiastic responses from virtually every village.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> When the revolt was launched and revenue refused, the government sent police and intimidation squads to seize property, including confiscating barn animals and whole farms. Patel organised a network of volunteers to work with individual villages<U+2014>helping them hide valuables and protect themselves during raids. Thousands of activists and farmers were arrested, but Patel was not. The revolt began evoking sympathy and admiration across India, including with pro-British Indian politicians. The government agreed to negotiate with Patel and decided to suspend the payment of revenue for the year, even scaling back the rate. Patel emerged as a hero to Gujaratis and admired across India.<ref>{{cite book

Patel supported Gandhi's [[Non-Cooperation Movement|Non-cooperation movement]] and toured the state to recruit more than 300,000 members and raise over Rs. 1.5 million in funds.<ref>{{cite book

Patel also supported Gandhi's controversial suspension of resistance in wake of the [[Chauri Chaura]] incident. He worked extensively in the following years in Gujarat against alcoholism, [[Dalit|untouchability]] and [[Indian caste system|caste discrimination]], as well as for the empowerment of women. In the Congress, he was a resolute supporter of Gandhi against his [[Swaraj Party|Swarajist]] critics. Patel was elected Ahmedabad's municipal president in 1922, 1924 and 1927<U+2014>during his terms, Ahmedabad was extended a major supply of electricity and the school system underwent major reforms. Drainage and sanitation systems were extended over all the city. He fought for the recognition and payment of teachers employed in schools established by nationalists (out of British control) and even took on sensitive Hindu-[[Muslim]] Issues.<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:Pic21.jpg|thumb|left|Patel with Bardoli peasants]]
When Gandhi was in prison, Sardar Patel was asked by Congressmen to lead the satyagraha in [[Nagpur]] in 1923 against a law banning the raising of the Indian flag. He organised thousands of volunteers from all over the country in processions hoisting the flag. Patel negotiated a settlement that obtained the release of all prisoners and allowed nationalists to hoist the flag in public. Later that year, Patel and his allies uncovered evidence suggesting that the police were in league with local [[dacoity|dacoits]] in the Borsad taluka even as the government prepared to levy a major tax for fighting dacoits in the area. More than 6,000 villagers assembled to hear Patel speak and supported the proposed agitation against the tax, which was deemed immoral and unnecessary. He organised hundreds of Congressmen, sent instructions and received information from across the district. Every village in the ''[[taluka]]'' resisted payment of the tax, and through cohesion, also prevented the seizure of property and lands. After a protracted struggle, the government withdrew the tax. Historians believe that one of Patel's key achievements was the building of cohesion and trust amongst the different castes and communities, which were divided on socio-economic lines.<ref>{{cite book

In April 1928, Sardar Patel returned to the freedom struggle from his municipal duties in Ahmedabad when Bardoli suffered from a serious predicament of a famine and steep tax hike. The revenue hike was steeper than it had been in Kheda even though the famine covered a large portion of Gujarat. After cross-examining and talking to village representatives, emphasizing the potential hardship and need for non-violence and cohesion, Patel initiated the struggle<U+2014>complete denial of taxes.<ref>{{cite book

 | title = Patel: A Life
 | pages = 149<U+2013>151
}}</ref> Sardar Patel organised volunteers, camps and an information network across affected areas. The revenue refusal was stronger than in Kheda and many sympathy satyagrahas were undertaken across Gujarat. Despite arrests, seizures of property and lands, the struggle intensified. The situation reached a head in August, when through sympathetic intermediaries, he negotiated a settlement repealing the tax hike, reinstating village officials who had resigned in protest and the return of seized property and lands. It was during the struggle and after the victory in Bardoli that Patel was increasingly addressed by his colleagues and followers as '''Sardar'''.<ref>{{cite book

===Leading the Congress===
[[Image:Congressmen.png|thumb|[[Maulana Azad]], Sardar Patel (third from left, in the foreground), and other Congressmen at Wardha]]
As Gandhi embarked on the [[Dandi Salt March]], Patel was arrested in the village of Ras and tried without witnesses, with no lawyer or pressman allowed to attend. Patel's arrest and Gandhi's subsequent arrest caused the [[Salt Satyagraha]] to greatly intensify in Gujarat<U+2014>districts across Gujarat launched an anti-tax rebellion until and unless Patel and Gandhi were released.<ref>{{cite book

After the signing of the [[Gandhi-Irwin Pact]], Patel was elected Congress president for its 1931 session in [[Karachi]]<U+2014>here the Congress ratified the pact, committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and human freedoms, and a vision of a secular nation, minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president in organising the return of confiscated lands to farmers in Gujarat.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Upon the failure of the [[Round Table Conference]] in London, Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened, and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail. During this term of imprisonment, Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other, and the two developed a close bond of affection, trust, and frankness. Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother (Gandhi) and his younger brother (Patel). Despite having arguments with Gandhi, Patel respected his instincts and leadership. During imprisonment, the two would discuss national and social issues, read Hindu epics and crack jokes. Gandhi also taught Patel [[Sanskrit]] language. Gandhi's secretary [[Mahadev Desai]] kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Patel was later moved to a jail in [[Nasik]], and refused a British offer for a brief release to attend the cremation of his brother Vithalbhai, who had died in 1934. He was finally released in July of the same year.

Patel's position at the highest level in the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its [[boycott]] of elections) in the party organization. Based at an apartment in [[Mumbai]], he became the Congress's main fund-raiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] in New Delhi and also for the Provincial elections of 1936.<ref>{{cite book

In 1935, Patel underwent surgery for [[hemorrhoids]], yet guided efforts against plague in Bardoli and again when a drought struck Gujarat in 1939. Patel would guide the Congress ministries that had won power across India with the aim of preserving party discipline<U+2014>Patel feared that the British would use opportunities to create conflicts among elected Congressmen, and he did not want the party to be distracted from the goal of complete independence.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> But Patel would clash with [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]], opposing declarations of the adoption of [[socialism]] at the 1936 Congress session, which he believed was a diversion from the main goal of achieving independence. In 1938, Patel organized rank and file opposition to the attempts of then-Congress president [[Subhash Bose]] to move away from Gandhi's principles of non-violent resistance. Patel considered Bose to be authoritarian and desirous of more power over the party. He led senior Congress leaders in a protest, which resulted in Bose's resignation. But criticism arose from Bose's supporters, socialists and other Congressmen that Patel himself was acting in an authoritarian manner in his defense of Gandhi's authority.

===Quit India===
{{main|Quit India Movement}}
When [[World War II]] broke out, Patel supported Nehru's decision to withdraw the Congress from central and provincial legislatures, contrary to Gandhi's advice, as well as an initiative by senior leader [[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]] to offer Congress's full support to Britain if it promised Indian independence at the end of the war and install a democratic government right away. Gandhi had refused to support Britain on the grounds of his moral opposition to war, while [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] was in militant opposition to the British. The British rejected Rajagopalachari's initiative, and Patel embraced Gandhi's leadership again.<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:Gandhi, Patel and Maulana Azad Sept 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Azad, Patel and Gandhi at an AICC meeting in Bombay, 1940.]]
While Nehru, Rajagopalachari and [[Maulana Azad]] initially criticized Gandhi's proposal for an all-out campaign of civil disobedience to force the British to ''Quit India'', Patel was its most fervent supporter. Arguing that the British would retreat from India as they had from [[Singapore]] and [[Burma]], Patel stressed that the campaign start without any delay.<ref>{{cite book

<blockquote>"The Governor of [[Burma]] boasts in London that they left Burma only after reducing everything to dust. So you promise the same thing to India?... You refer in your radio broadcasts and newspapers to the government established in Burma by Japan as a puppet government? What sort of government do you have in Delhi now?...When France fell before the Nazi onslaught, in the midst of total war, Mr. Churchill offered union with England to the French. That was indeed a stroke of inspired statesmanship. But when it comes to India? Oh no! Constitutional changes in the midst of a war? Absolutely unthinkable...The object this time is to free India before the Japanese can come and be ready to fight them if they come. They will round up the leaders, round up all. Then it will be the duty of every Indian to put forth his utmost effort<U+2014>within non-violence. No source is to be left untapped; no weapon untried. This is going to be the opportunity of a lifetime."<ref>{{cite book

==Independence, integration and Role of Gandhi==
In the 1946 election for the Congress presidency, Patel stepped down in favor of Nehru at the request of Gandhi. The election's importance stemmed from the fact that the elected President would lead free India's first Government. Gandhi asked all 16 states representatives and Congress to elect the right person and Sardar Patel's name was proposed by 13 states representatives out of 16, but Patel respected Gandhi's request to not be the first prime minister. As a Home Minister, Patel merged all parts of India under federal control but Jammu and Kashmir was left out because of Nehru.

After the election of Nehru as the party's president, Patel began directing the Congress campaign for the general elections of the [[Constituent Assembly of India]].
[[Image:Congressmeet.png|thumb|Gandhi (right), Patel (left), and Nehru (back)]]
In the elections, the Congress won a large majority of the elected seats, dominating the Hindu electorate. But the [[Muslim League]] led by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] won a large majority of Muslim electorate seats. The League had resolved in 1940 to demand [[Pakistan]]<U+2014>an independent state for Muslims<U+2014>and was a fierce critic of the Congress. The Congress formed governments in all provinces save [[Sindh]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]], where it entered into coalitions with other parties.

===Cabinet mission and partition===
{{seealso|Partition of India}}
When the [[1946 Cabinet Mission to India|British mission]] proposed two plans for transfer of power, there was considerable opposition within the Congress to both. The plan of 16 May 1946 proposed a loose federation with extensive provincial autonomy, and the "grouping" of provinces based on religious-majority. The plan of 16 June 1946 proposed the partition of India on religious lines, with over [[List of Indian Princely States|600 princely states]] free to choose between independence or accession to either dominion. The League approved both plans, while the Congress flatly rejected the 16 June proposal. Gandhi criticised the 16 May proposal as being inherently divisive, but Patel, realizing that rejecting the proposal would mean that only the League would be invited to form a government, lobbied the [[Congress Working Committee]] hard to give its assent to the 16 May proposal. Patel engaged the British envoys [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] and [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Lord Pethick-Lawrence]] and obtained an assurance that the "grouping" clause would not be given practical force, Patel converted Nehru, [[Rajendra Prasad]] and Rajagopalachari to accept the plan. When the League retracted its approval of the 16 May plan, the viceroy [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Lord Wavell]] invited the Congress to form the government. Under Nehru, who was styled the "Vice President of the Viceroy's Executive Council," Patel took charge of the departments of home affairs and information and broadcasting. He moved into a government house on 1, Aurangzeb Road in Delhi<U+2014>this would be his residence till his death in 1950.

Vallabhbhai Patel was one of the first Congress leaders to accept the partition of India as a solution to the rising Muslim separatist movement led by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. He had been outraged by Jinnah's [[Direct Action Day|Direct Action]] campaign, which had provoked communal violence across India and by the viceroy's vetoes of his home department's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality. Patel severely criticised the viceroy's induction of League ministers into the government, and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British without Congress approval. Although further outraged at the League's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government, he was also aware that Jinnah did enjoy popular support amongst Muslims, and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu-Muslim civil war of disastrous consequences. The continuation of a divided and weak central government would in Patel's mind, result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Between the months of December 1946 and January 1947, Patel worked with civil servant [[V. P. Menon]] on the latter's suggestion for a separate [[dominion]] of [[Pakistan]] created out of Muslim-majority provinces. Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition. Patel, a fierce critic of Jinnah's demand that the Hindu-majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state, obtained the partition of those provinces, thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan. Patel's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public, which had tired of the League's tactics, but he was criticised by Gandhi, Nehru, secular Muslims and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so. When Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947, Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal. Knowing Gandhi's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition, Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over the perceived practical unworkability of any Congress-League coalition, the rising violence and the threat of civil war. At the [[All India Congress Committee]] meeting called to vote on the proposal, Patel said:

{{cquote|I fully appreciate the fears of our brothers from [the Muslim-majority areas]. Nobody likes the division of India and my heart is heavy. But the choice is between one division and many divisions. We must face facts. We cannot give way to emotionalism and sentimentality. The Working Committee has not acted out of fear. But I am afraid of one thing, that all our toil and hard work of these many years might go waste or prove unfruitful. My nine months in office has completely disillusioned me regarding the supposed merits of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Except for a few honourable exceptions, Muslim officials from the top down to the chaprasis ([[peon]]s or servants) are working for the League. The communal veto given to the League in the Mission Plan would have blocked India's progress at every stage. Whether we like it or not, de facto Pakistan already exists in the Punjab and Bengal. Under the circumstances I would prefer a de jure Pakistan, which may make the League more responsible. Freedom is coming. We have 75 to 80 percent of India, which we can make strong with our own genius. The League can develop the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite book

Following Gandhi's and Congress' approval of the plan, Patel represented India on the Partition Council, where he oversaw the division of public assets, and selected the Indian council of ministers with Nehru. However, neither he nor any other Indian leader had foreseen the intense violence and population transfer that would take place with partition. Patel would take the lead in organising relief and emergency supplies, establishing refugee camps and visiting the border areas with Pakistani leaders to encourage peace. Despite these efforts, the death toll is estimated at between five hundred thousand to a million people.<ref>{{cite book|author=French, Patrick|authorlink=Patrick French|year=1997|title=Liberty and Death: India's Journey to Independence and Division|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|pages=347<U+2013>349}}</ref> The estimated number of refugees in both countries exceeds 15 million.<ref name="consequences">{{cite web| url=http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Part.html| title="The Partition of India"| first=Department of English, Emory University| last="Postcolonial Studies" project| accessdate=2006-04-20}}</ref> Understanding that Delhi and Punjab policemen, accused of organising attacks on Muslims, were personally affected by the tragedies of partition, Patel called out the [[Indian Army]] with South Indian regiments to restore order, imposing strict curfews and shoot-at-sight orders. Visiting the [[Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah]] area in Delhi, where thousands of Delhi Muslims feared attacks, he prayed at the shrine, visited the people and reinforced the presence of police. He suppressed from the press reports of atrocities in Pakistan against Hindus and [[Sikh]]s to prevent retaliatory violence. Establishing the [[Delhi Emergency Committee]] to restore order and organising relief efforts for refugees in the capital, Patel publicly warned officials against partiality and neglect. When reports reached Patel that large groups of Sikhs were preparing to attack Muslim convoys heading for Pakistan, Patel hurried to [[Amritsar]] and met Sikh and Hindu leaders. Arguing that attacking helpless people was cowardly and dishonourable, Patel emphasised that Sikh actions would result in further attacks against Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan. He assured the community leaders that if they worked to establish peace and order and guarantee the safety of Muslims, the Indian government would react forcefully to any failures of Pakistan to do the same. Additionally, Patel addressed a massive crowd of an estimated 200,000 refugees who had surrounded his car after the meetings:

{{cquote|Here, in this same city, the blood of Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims mingled in the [[Amritsar Massacre|bloodbath of Jallianwala Bagh]]. I am grieved to think that things have come to such a pass that no Muslim can go about in Amritsar and no Hindu or Sikh can even think of living in Lahore. The butchery of innocent and defenceless men, women and children does not behove brave men... I am quite certain that India's interest lies in getting all her men and women across the border and sending out all Muslims from East Punjab. I have come to you with a specific appeal. Pledge the safety of Muslim refugees crossing the city. Any obstacles or hindrances will only worsen the plight of our refugees who are already performing prodigious feats of endurance. If we have to fight, we must fight clean. Such a fight must await an appropriate time and conditions and you must be watchful in choosing your ground. To fight against the refugees is no fight at all. No laws of humanity or war among honourable men permit the murder of people who have sought shelter and protection. Let there be truce for three months in which both sides can exchange their refugees. This sort of truce is permitted even by laws of war. Let us take the initiative in breaking this vicious circle of attacks and counter-attacks. Hold your hands for a week and see what happens. Make way for the refugees with your own force of volunteers and let them deliver the refugees safely at our frontier.<ref>{{cite book

Following his dialogue with community leaders and his speech, no further attacks occurred against Muslim refugees, and a wider peace and order was re-established soon over the entire area. However, Patel was criticised by Nehru, secular Muslims and taxed by Gandhi over his alleged wish to see Muslims from other parts of India depart. While Patel vehemently denied such allegations, the acrimony with [[Maulana Azad]] and other secular Muslim leaders increased when Patel refused to dismiss Delhi's Sikh police commissioner, who was accused of discrimination. Hindu and Sikh leaders also accused Patel and other leaders of not taking Pakistan sufficiently to task over the attacks on their communities there, and Muslim leaders further criticised him for allegedly neglecting the needs of Muslims leaving for Pakistan, and concentrating resources for incoming Hindu and Sikh refugees. Patel clashed with Nehru and Azad over the allocation of houses in Delhi vacated by Muslims leaving for Pakistan<U+2014>Nehru and Azad desired to allocate them for displaced Muslims, while Patel argued that no government professing [[secularism]] must make such exclusions. However, Patel was publicly defended by Gandhi and received widespread admiration and support for speaking frankly on communal issues and acting decisively and resourcefully to quell disorder and violence.

===Political integration of India===
{{main|Political integration of India}}

This event formed the corner-stone of Patel's popularity in post-independence era and even today, he is remembered as the man who united India. He is, in this regard, compared to [[Otto von Bismarck]] of Germany, who did the same thing in 1860s. Under the 3 June plan, more than 600 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan, or choosing independence. Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede, a vast majority of the people and territory would be fragmented. The Congress as well as senior British officials considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving unification of the princely states with the Indian dominion. Gandhi had said to Patel ''"the problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it".''<ref>{{cite book
 | last = Gandhi
 | first = Rajmohan
 | title = Patel: A Life
 | pages = 406
}}</ref> He was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task. Patel asked [[V. P. Menon]], a senior civil servant with whom he had worked over the [[partition of India]], to become his right-hand as chief secretary of the States Ministry. On 6 May 1947, Patel began lobbying the princes, attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future Government and trying to forestall potential conflicts. Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most monarchs, inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in [[Delhi]]. At these meetings, Patel stated that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order. Nonetheless, he stressed that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith by 15 August 1947. Patel invoked the patriotism of India's monarchs, asking them to join in the freedom of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people. He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic, especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects. He proposed favourable terms for the merger, including creation of ''[[Privy Purse in India|privy purses]]'' for the descendants of the rulers. While encouraging the rulers to act with patriotism, Patel did not rule out force, setting a deadline of 15 August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of accession document. All but three of the states willingly merged into the Indian union<U+2014>only [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Junagadh]], and [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]] did not fall into his basket.

[[Image:Hyderabad state 1909.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hyderabad state]] in 1909. Its area stretches over the present Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]].]]
Junagadh was especially important to Patel, since it was in his home state of [[Gujarat]]. The Nawab had under pressure from Sir [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]] acceded to Pakistan. It was however, quite far from Pakistan and 80% of its population was Hindu. Patel combined diplomacy with force, demanding that Pakistan annul the accession, and that the Nawab accede to India. He sent the Army to occupy three principalities of Junagadh to show his resolve. Following widespread protests and the formation of a civil government, or ''Aarzi Hukumat'', both Bhutto and the Nawab fled to [[Karachi]], and under Patel's orders, Indian Army and police units marched into the state. A plebiscite later organised produced a 99.5% vote for merger with India.<ref>{{cite book

{{cquote|If Hyderabad does not see the writing on the wall, it goes the way Junagadh has gone. Pakistan attempted to set off Kashmir against Junagadh. When we raised the question of settlement in a democratic way, they (Pakistan) at once told us that they would consider it if we applied that policy to Kashmir.

Hyderabad was the largest of the princely states, and included parts of present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], and [[Maharashtra]] states. Its ruler, the [[Nizam]] [[Osman Ali Khan, Asif Jah VII|Osman Ali Khan]] was a Muslim, although over 80% of its people were Hindu. The Nizam sought independence or accession with Pakistan. Muslim forces loyal to Nizam, called the [[Razakars]], under [[Qasim Razvi]] pressed the Nizam to hold out against India, while organising attacks with militant Communists on people on Indian soil. Even though a Standstill Agreement was signed due to the desperate efforts of Lord Mountbatten to avoid a war, the Nizam rejected deals and changed his positions.<ref>{{cite book

The main aim of Mountbatten and Nehru in avoiding a forced annexation was to prevent an outbreak of Hindu-Muslim violence. Patel insisted that if Hyderabad was allowed to continue with its antics, the prestige of the Government would fall and then neither Hindus nor Muslims would feel secure in its realm. After defeating  Nizam, Patel retained him as the ceremonial chief of state, and held talks with him.<ref>{{cite book

==Leading India==
[[Governor-General of India|Governor General]] [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]], Nehru and Patel formed the ''triumvirate'' which ruled India from 1948 to 1950. Prime Minister Nehru was intensely popular with the masses, but Patel enjoyed the loyalty and faith of rank and file Congressmen, state leaders and India's civil services. Patel was a senior leader in the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] and was responsible in a large measure for shaping India's constitution.<ref name="constitution">{{cite web

His intervention was key to the passage of two articles that protected civil servants from political involvement and guaranteed their terms and privileges.<ref name="constitution"/> He was also instrumental in the founding the [[Indian Administrative Service]] and the [[Indian Police Service]], and for his defence of Indian civil servants from political attack, he is known as the "patron saint" of India's services. When a delegation of Gujarati farmers came to him citing their inability to send their milk production to the markets without being fleeced by middlemen, Patel exhorted them to organise the processing and sale of milk by themselves, and guided them to create the [[Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers' Union Limited]], which preceded the [[Amul]] milk products brand. Patel also pledged the reconstruction of the ancient but dilapidated [[Somnath Temple]] in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]<U+2014>he oversaw the creation of a public trust and restoration work, and pledged to dedicate the temple upon the completion of work (the work was completed after Patel's death, and the temple was inaugurated by the first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad).

When the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|Pakistani invasion of Kashmir]] began in September 1947,  Patel immediately wanted to send troops into Kashmir. But agreeing with Nehru and Mountbatten, he waited till Kashmir's monarch had acceded to India. Patel then oversaw India's military operations to secure [[Srinagar]], the Baramulla Pass and the forces retrieved a lot of territory from the invaders. Patel, along with Defence Minister [[Baldev Singh]] administered the entire military effort, arranging for troops from different parts of India to be rushed to Kashmir and for a major military road connecting Srinagar to [[Pathankot]] be built in 6 months.<ref>{{cite book

The Cabinet had approved his point but it was reversed when Gandhi, who feared an intensifying rivalry and further communal violence, went on a fast-unto-death to obtain the release.

In 1949, a crisis arose when the number of Hindu refugees entering [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]] from [[East Pakistan]] climbed over 800,000. The refugees in many cases were being forcibly evicted by Pakistani authorities, and were victims of intimidation and violence.<ref>{{cite book

After much personal deliberation and contrary to Patel's prediction, Gandhi on 30 January 1948 told Patel not to leave the government. A free India, according to Gandhi, needed both Patel and Nehru.

Criticism arose from the media and other politicians that Patel's home ministry had failed to protect Gandhi.

==Criticism and legacy==
[[Image:Patelcoat.jpg|thumb|The coat of Sardar Patel, on display at the Sardar Patel National Memorial, Ahmedabad]]
During his lifetime, Vallabhbhai Patel received criticism of an alleged bias against Muslims during the time of partition. He was criticised by nationalist Muslims such as Maulana Azad as well as Hindu nationalists for readily plumping for partition. Patel was criticised by supporters of [[Subhash Bose]] for acting coercively to put down politicians not supportive of Gandhi. Socialist politicians such as [[Jaya Prakash Narayan]] and [[Asoka Mehta]] criticised him for his personal proximity to Indian industrialists such as the [[Birla family|Birla]] and Sarabhai families. Some historians have criticised Patel's actions on the integration of princely states as undermining the right of self-determination for those states.

However, Patel is credited for being almost single-handedly responsible for unifying India on the eve of independence. He won the admiration of many Indians for speaking frankly on the issues of Hindu-Muslim relations and not shying from using military force to integrate India. His skills of leadership and practical judgement were hailed by British statesmen<U+2014>his opponents in the freedom struggle<U+2014>such as [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Lord Wavell]], Cripps, Pethick-Lawrence and Mountbatten. Some historians and admirers of Patel such as Rajendra Prasad and industrialist [[J.R.D. Tata]] have expressed opinions that Patel would have made a better prime minister for India than Nehru. Nehru's critics and Patel's admirers cite Nehru's belated embrace of Patel's advice regarding the UN and Kashmir and the integration of [[Goa]] by military action. Proponents of free enterprise cite the failings of Nehru's socialist policies as opposed to Patel's defence of property rights and his mentorship of the Amul co-operative project.

Among Patel's surviving family, [[Manibehn Patel]] lived in a flat in Mumbai for the rest of her life following her father's death; she often led the work of the [[Sardar Patel Memorial Trust]]<U+2014>which organises the prestigious annual [[Sardar Patel Memorial Lectures]]<U+2014>and other charitable organisations. [[Dahyabhai Patel]] was a businessman who eventually was elected to serve in the [[Lok Sabha]] (the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]]) as an [[Member of Parliament#India|MP]] in the 1960s.

Patel was officially awarded the [[Bharat Ratna]], India's highest civilian honour posthumously in 1991. Patel's birthday, 31 October,  is celebrated nationally in India as ''Sardar Jayanti''. The [[Sardar Patel National Memorial]] was established in 1980 at the [[Moti Shahi Mahal]] in Ahmedabad. It comprises a museum, a gallery of portraits and historical pictures and a library, which stores important documents and books associated with Patel and his life. Amongst the exhibits are many of Patel's personal effects and relics from various periods of his personal and political life.

Patel is the namesake of many public institutions in India. A major initiative to build dams, canals and hydroelectric power plants on the [[Narmada River|Narmada river valley]] to provide a tri-state area with drinking water, electricity and increase agricultural production was named the ''[[Sardar Sarovar Project|Sardar Sarovar]]''. Patel is also the namesake of the [[Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology]], the [[Sardar Patel University]] and the [[Sardar Patel Vidyalaya]], which are among the nation's premier institutions. India's [[Indian Police Service|national police training academy]] is also named after him. In [[Richard Attenborough]]'s ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), actor [[Saeed Jaffrey]] portrayed Patel. In 1993, the [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Sardar (film)|Sardar]]'' was produced and directed by [[Ketan Mehta]] and featured noted Indian actor [[Paresh Rawal]] as Patel; it focused on Patel's leadership in the years leading up to independence, the partition of India, India's political integration and Patel's relationship with Gandhi and Nehru.
