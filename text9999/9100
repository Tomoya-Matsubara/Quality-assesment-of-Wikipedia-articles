'''William Grose''' (December 16, 1812 &ndash; July 30, 1900) was a lawyer, politician, author, and [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He served in many of the important campaigns and battles of the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], earning a reputation for being "always seen where the bullets flew thickest."<ref>[http://civilwarindiana.com/biographies/grose_william.html Civil War Indiana bio]</ref>

==Early life and career==
Grose was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], to a family with strong military ties. His father had served in the [[United States Army]] under [[William Henry Harrison]] against the [[British Army]] in the [[War of 1812]] and his grandfather Jacob Grose had been killed in the [[American Revolution]]. In the spring of 1813, Grose's family moved to [[Fayette County, Indiana]], and then to [[Henry County, Indiana|Henry County]] in 1829. He worked as a youth as a farm laborer and in a local brickyard. 

Grose studied law in [[New Castle, Indiana]], where he lived the rest of his life. He passed the bar exam in 1842 and established a successful law practice and unsuccessfully ran for the [[United States Congress]] in 1852 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Switching political parties, in 1856 he was a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]], supporting [[John C. Fremont]]'s unsuccessful candidacy for [[President of the United States]]. He was elected in 1860 as a judge of the local [[Indiana Court of Common Pleas|common pleas court]].

==Civil War==
With the outbreak of the Civil War, Grose was appointed [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the [[36th Regiment Indiana Infantry|36th Indiana Infantry]] in October 1861, a [[regiment]] he recruited and trained. He led the regiment during the [[Battle of Shiloh]], where his horse was shot from under him and he was slightly wounded in the shoulder. Shortly afterwards, he replaced the wounded Brig. Gen. [[Jacob Ammen]] in command of a [[brigade]] of [[infantry]] in the [[Army of the Cumberland]] under [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Don Carlos Buell]]. He participated in numerous campaigns and battles, including the pursuit of [[Braxton Bragg]]'s army in the Kentucky Campaign, having another horse killed at the [[Battle of Stones River]].

In 1863, he fought in the [[Tullahoma Campaign]] and the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], where he was wounded in the neck. He and his men performed well during the [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga Campaign]] in late 1863, taking part in the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain|assault on Lookout Mountain]] and received praise in the official reports of the battle.

The following year, Grose led his brigade in the [[Atlanta Campaign]] under [[William T. Sherman]]. During the [[Siege of Atlanta]] in July 1864, he was commissioned a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of U.S. Volunteers. He commanded a brigade in Maj. Gen. [[Nathan Kimball]]'s [[division (military)|division]] in Maj. Gen. [[Thomas J. Wood]]'s [[IV Corps (ACW)|IV Corps]]. Grose accompanied the [[Army of the Tennessee]] northward in pursuit of [[John Bell Hood]] and fought in the [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]], where Hood's army was virtually destroyed. He was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] as a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in August 1865, while serving on administrative duty on a [[court-martial]] of a fellow officer.

==Postbellum==
Following the war, Grose remained in the [[Regular Army]] for a year, and then resigned in January 1866. He returned to New Castle, Indiana, and resumed his law practice. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] appointed him as the collector of internal revenue taxes for his region, a post he held until 1874. 

Interested in social improvement, Grose took a position on the Indiana commission that oversaw the construction of [[mental hospital]]s. In 1878, he was narrowly defeated in a bid for a Congressional seat. In 1887, Grose returned to politics, successfully campaigning for a seat in the [[Indiana State Senate]]. In 1891, he authored the regimental history of the 36th Indiana Infantry and actively participated in its veterans reunions.

Grose died at the age of 87 in his home in [[New Castle, Indiana]], and was buried in South Mound Cemetery.

The [[Gen. William Grose House]] in New Castle is the home of the Henry County Historical Society and open to the public.
