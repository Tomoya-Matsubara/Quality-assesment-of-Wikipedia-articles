'''''Beautiful Garbage''''' (also typeset '''''beautifulgarbage''''') is the third [[album]] by [[alternative rock]] group [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]. The album was released worldwide in October 2001 by [[A&E Records|Mushroom Records UK]] and in [[North America]] by [[Interscope]] and was the followup to the band's [[Grammy|Grammy-nominated]] ''[[Version 2.0]]''. Marking a departure from the sound Garbage had established on their first two records, ''Beautiful Garbage'' was written and recorded over the course of a year, during which time [[lead singer]] [[Shirley Manson]] chronicled their efforts weekly online, becoming one of the first high-profile musicians to keep an internet [[blog]]. The album is marked by expanding on the musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds that mix rock with [[electronica]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[girl group]]s. 
The album's title is taken directly from a lyric in the song "[[Celebrity Skin (song)|Celebrity Skin]]" by [[Hole (band)|Hole]].<ref name="cs" />

Released three weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]], the album suffered from lack of promotion, mixed reaction from critics and fans alike, and the failure of its [[lead single]] "[[Androgyny (song)|Androgyny]]" to achieve high chart positions.<ref>''[[Absolute Garbage#Absolute Garbage DVD|Thanks for the, Uhhh, Support]]'' documentary</ref> Despite faltering in major markets, ''Beautiful Garbage'' debuted at number 13 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], number 1 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Top Electronic Albums]], topped the album charts in [[Australia]], and peaked within the top tens of multiple [[Europe]]an countries. It was named one of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s "Top 10 Albums of the Year".

==Background==
The origins of ''Beautiful Garbage'' came from a three-day September 1999 [[recording session]] during Garbage's [[Version 2.0 tour|world tour]] in support of their second album ''[[Version 2.0]]''.<ref name="Makingmusic">{{cite journal|title=Sweet Insanity|first=Andy|last=Basine|journal=[[Making Music Magazine|Making Music]]''|date=March 2002}}</ref> The sessions resulted in "Silence Is Golden" and "Til the Day I Die", which were written for a proposed [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/garbage/2071|title=VIG TALK FROM GARBAGE|publisher=''NME''|date=1 October 1999|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleedlikeme.4bb.ru/viewtopic.php?id=255#p3725|title=1999.10 "Shirley's Lesbian Kiss ", Kerrang!| publisher=''Kerrang!'' (reproduced on Bleedlikeme.4bb.ru)|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref> Both songs were loose and organic, contrasting the very dense layered production that featured on ''Version 2.0''. "Silence Is Golden" in particular had been written with an odd [[Song structure (popular music)|structure]] for a Garbage song: a [[Time signature|6/8]] [[Swing (jazz performance style)|shuffle]] that progressed to a straight [[Common time|4/4]] [[Beat (music)|beat]].<ref>"Garbage's Pail Kids", written by Ben Bartlett, published in ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' August 2002 issue</ref>

The sale of the band's North American independent record label [[Almo Sounds]] to [[Universal Music Group|UMG]] in early 2000 put the B-sides album on hold; Garbage decided to simply start work on recording their third album instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429322/garbage-regroups-studio.jhtml|title=Garbage Regroups in the Studio|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref> Garbage began writing and recording the album at their own [[Smart Studios]], in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in April of that year. "The only vision we had was that we wanted it to sound different," recalled guitarist [[Duke Erikson]] about the influence that the two new tracks had cast, adding that the band wished to evolve the chemistry that the band had developed from [[Concert tour|touring]] the previous two years.<ref name="SOS">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun02/articles/garbage.asp|title=Recording Garbage (Interview with Duke Erikson, Butch Vig and Billy Bush)|publisher=''[[Sound On Sound]]'' June 2002 issue|accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>

==Composition==
More diverse than their first two studio albums, musically more melodic and lyrically more direct, ''Beautiful Garbage'' featured [[electronica]] fused with contemporary [[hip hop]], with influences coming from 1980s [[New wave music|new wave]] to 1960s [[girl groups]]. Garbage acknowledged the broad span of sounds and styles, which range from [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] to [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] to [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=bio>''Beautiful Garbage'' bio, written by Peter Murphy, published by Mushroom and Interscope, July 2001.</ref> Regarding the melancholic lyrics, Manson stated they happened because after two years touring "we were very isolated and removed from our lives", so when writing the lyrics "I felt an overwhelming sense that I need to reinvest in my 'relations'".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=m-qexhnZaukC&pg=PA81 Call Her Ms. Manson], ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''</ref>

{{Quote box|quote=It was a really interesting experience for me as a musician. I learned a lot. It was quite a liberating experience in a funny way. I was going through a divorce, and I ripped my hair out, basically shaved it. I felt like I had rid myself of all shackles...On the other side of it, you<U+2019>re stuffed in a cage and tied down to all your old ideas, all your old opinions, all your old creative output, and that can be a prison sometimes. So for me, ''Beautifulgarbage'' was really liberating.

Vig stated that the album is a "much simpler record than [[Version 2.0]]". "All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [in Smart Studios] with guitar, bass and drums. Duke might be playing piano or keyboards too. That was the only conscious decision we made -- to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there're about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it's basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing. There aren't 10 extra drum tracks or 10 extra guitars panning back and forth between channels.<U+201D> Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. "A lot of songs took shape in just a few hours as opposed to a few months with the last record.[...]Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn't have been in the studio for a full year. But a lot of them happened very quickly. 'Silence Is Golden' we recorded basically in three days and it was done. 'So Like a Rose,' for the most part, was recorded in three hours. I think we spent a lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [the new album]. Because that was our tendency on the other two records.<U+201D> On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that "[Manson<U+2019>s lyrics] aren't specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, 'Shut Your Mouth' is about all the bullshit that's out there, but it's also a sort of note to self to keep your mouth shut, because she says she's the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels."<ref name="Isthmus">{{cite web|url=http://www.isthmus.com/daily/article.php?article=36628 |title=Garbage: Can the Madison band's new sound succeed in the fickle pop marketplace? |publisher =[[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]] |date=29 April 2012| accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>

Garbage decided the best way to start writing the album was to set up their [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording equipment]], guitars, keyboards, [[drum kit]] and a [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] and "[[Jam session|jam]]" as a group.<ref name="SOS"/> Their [[improvisation]] led the inspiration of a few songs such as "[[Shut Your Mouth (Garbage song)|Shut Your Mouth]]", where the band played for three hours while Manson spontaneously composed melody and [[lyrics]], while "[[Breaking Up the Girl]]" came from both Erikson and drummer [[Butch Vig]] [[strum]]ming acoustic guitars in the studio lounge.<ref name="Pulse">"This Garbage Doesn't Stink!" written by Ken McCallef, published by ''[[Pulse!]]'', October 2001 issue</ref> The band felt that it was foremost that the new songs worked on an emotional level with Shirley's vocals and lyrics.<ref name="SOS"/> The initial sessions ultimately led to around 32 song ideas to develop further.<ref name="Makingmusic"/>

==Recording==
Smart Studios had upgraded their [[mixing console]] to a [[Trident Studios#The Trident 'A' Range Console|Trident A-Range]] model, which the band used extensively. The band [[Multitrack recording|tracked]] directly onto [[Magnetic tape|analogue tape]] using a [[Studer]] tape machine, which was then dumped into [[Pro Tools]] [[digital audio workstation]]. [[Overdubs]] and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] were carried out in Pro Tools.<ref name="SOS"/>

{{Quote box|quote=I think if someone really wanted to figure out the processes we go through, they should listen to all the mixes of one song, all the way through. As soon as we have the basic idea, we jam in the studio, and Shirley comes up with the melody and the lyrics. It might be in a very raw form to start with, but as we go, we constantly make rough mixes. You could probably go from the first one through about 12 or 20 mixes and hear what the change will be. Some of the songs take radical detours to get from point A to point B, when the song's finished.|width=33%|source=<U+2014>[[Butch Vig]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun02/articles/garbage.asp|title=Recording Garbage (Interview with Duke Erikson, Butch Vig and Billy Bush)|publisher=''[[Sound On Sound]]'' June 2002 issue|accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>}}

Vig kept the [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] simpler than before. Percussive tracks were recorded through a thirty-year old [[Roger Mayer (engineer)|Roger Meyer]] [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] to colour the sound (Vig: "It's really saturated and distorted, but in a very musical way").<ref name="SOS"/> Some tracks however were fairly scrutinized: an [[instrumental]] [[bridge (music)|break]] in "Til the Day I Die" incorporated [[reverse tape effects]].<ref name="SOS"/> Vig was not satisfied with his "[[swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]" on a 6/8 [[Groove (music)|groove]] written for a [[falsetto]] vocal Manson had recorded on "Can't Cry These Tears", so he recruited [[Matt Chamberlain]] to play the part. The recorded sequence incorporated Chamberlain's contribution, some of Vig's performance and some light [[Programming (music)|programming]].<ref>"Beauty and The Beast", written by Pat Reid, published by ''[[Rhythm (music magazine)|Rhythm]]'', July 2002 issue</ref> Chamberlain also performed a "chopped-up" [[Drum beat|drum pattern]] for "Cup of Coffee" and a "bitchin' funk groove" on "[[Breaking Up the Girl#Commercial track listings|Confidence]]".<ref name="Soundbarrier">"Breaking The Sound Barrier", written by Adam Budofsky, published by ''[[Modern Drummer]]'', June 2002 issue</ref>

Much of the recorded guitar work was [[Equalization (audio)|heavily processed]], the band using a [[Pod (amp modeler)|Line 6 Pod]] for [[Melody|melodic parts]] and [[Ornament (music)|embellishments]]: for example, for the [[Thirty-two-bar form|middle eight]] of "So Like a Rose", Erikson played a [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] with an [[Ebow|E-bow]] through the Pod, while the [[Synthesizer|synth-like]] [[Introduction (music)|intro]] to "Parade" was created by layering an acoustic guitar part with a clean electric guitar. A [[tremolo]] effect on "Can't Cry These Tears" was inspired by [[Wall of Sound|1960s production techniques]].<ref name="SOS"/> The [[Amplifier modeling|amp modelers]] were used to pre-effect the recording prior to Pro Tools, in order to prevent [[phasing]]. For electric guitar recording, the band utilized [[Isolation cabinet (guitar)|cabinet miking]] - four [[microphone|mikes]] recorded the output of a [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] [[Guitar amplifier|amplifier]]. Acoustics were recorded using a single [[Blue Microphones|Blue Bottle]] mike.<ref name="SOS"/> [[Daniel Shulman]], who had performed bass guitar on ''Version 2.0'' and the band's two world tours, spent two separate weeks laying down bass parts. Shulman was given freedom by the band to come up with parts and be creative, creating new [[bassline]]s on the [[Verse (music)|verses]] of "[[Androgyny (song)|Androgyny]]" and "Nobody Loves You".<ref name="bass">{{cite journal| url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/boylikearose/articles-bass-mar2002.html&date=2009-10-25+13:49:49| title=Daniel Shulman interview|date=March 2002|journal=''[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]'' magazine | accessdate=2008-02-03}}</ref> Shulman revisited "Silence Is Golden", breaking up the [[Swing (jazz performance style)|straight eighths]] of the [[Coda (music)|coda]] to make it more interesting.<ref name="bass"/>

Due to Manson's growing confidence and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals did not require much treatment; "Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing a lot with it. On something like 'Nobody Loves You' she sings really low on the verse, almost at the bottom of her range, and then and the end she's singing three and a half octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound", Vig remarked.<ref name="SOS"/> Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on "So Like a Rose" was recorded on the first [[take]].<ref name="SOS"/> On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s and post effects. "Til the Day Die" featured a digital "[[Scratching|scratch]]"-effect, created by printing her vocal to [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On "Can't Cry These Tears", the four vocal parts were [[Multitrack recording|triple-tracked]] using different mikes, while a [[guitar riff]] was matched to her voice for a section of "Breaking Up the Girl". On "[[Cherry Lips]]", her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd.<ref name="SOS"/> On slower songs such as "Drive You Home", Garbage were not overly concerned with [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]], giving it "a rawer quality".<ref name="Soundbarrier"/> Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1123595/garbages-shirley-manson-hints-at-heavier-new-album/|title=Garbage<U+2019>s Shirley Manson Hints At <U+2018>Heavier<U+2019> New Album|publisher=''MTV''|date=30 August 2000|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

Garbage finished recording ''Beautiful Garbage'' at the end of April 2001, and spent a month completing the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|final mix]] (some songs had gone through as many as 40 rough mixes).<ref name="SOS"/> Final EQ, compressing and [[Music sequencer|sequencing]] on the album was handled by [[Scott Hull (mastering engineer)|Scott Hull]] of Classic Sound in [[New York]].<ref name="SOS"/> Despite running a competition on their website to name the album, Manson's own working title, inspired by a lyric in [[Hole (band)|Hole]]'s "[[Celebrity Skin (song)|Celebrity Skin]]" won out.<ref name="cs">{{cite journal|title=Unforthcoming Attraction|author=[[Peter Robinson (journalist)|Robinson, Peter]]|journal=[[NME]]|date=October 6, 2001}}</ref> The album artwork came from Garbage's wish for it to be "something organic"; The band came up with the fractured [[rose]] idea, thinking that it worked well with the album title. Garbage contracted [[London]]-based designers Me Company to [[Computer-aided design|create the visuals]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Face To Face|first=Ashley|last=Bird|journal=[[Kerrang!]]|date=April 13, 2002}}</ref>

The jaunt ended with two night stint in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/garbage/10923|title=GARBAGE 'PUSH IT' A LITTLE FURTHER|publisher=NME|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> Garbage were supported by [[Abandoned Pools]] and on some shows, by [[White Stripes]]; during the tour, Vig was taken ill (later diagnosed as [[Bell's Palsy]]) and was replaced again by Matt Chamberlain.<ref name="earinfection"/> Garbage wrapped the North American tourdates on June 6 in [[Mexico City]].

A month-long European trek began June 10 in [[Madrid]], covering major [[rock festivals]] including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] and [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]]. [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] stood in for Vig for the rest of the summer.<ref name="earinfection">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75563/garbage-drummer-off-tour-with-ear-infection|title=Garbage Drummer Off Tour With Ear Infection|publisher=Billboard| accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> Garbage performed two shows in [[Nice]] and [[Lyon]] supporting [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and a further two headlining French shows in [[Lille]] and [[Paris]] with [[Mercury Rev]] as support. The European leg ended at [[Esp<U+00E1>rrago Rock]] in Spain on July 12. Throughout the run, Manson was dogged by vocal problems, leading to the cancellation of a few festival appearances. After a six-week break, Garbage returned to the United Kingdom to perform their last European shows of the year - two intimate [[nightclub|club]] gigs in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/garbage/12183|title=Garbage's Ballroom Blitz!|publisher=NME|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref>

Tom Laskin of [[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]] wrote that the "considerable sonic tweaking and abundant sampling that characterized the latter CD have been removed from Garbage's palette", noting that the songs are supported primarily by "bass, drum, and guitar configurations". Manson, who might have been perceived as emotionally detached in past efforts, here "exposes her core emotions with singular intent on two bittersweet reflections on failed relationships, the wistful "Cup of Coffee" and the crepuscular lover's lament "Drive You Home".<U+201D> On observing a musical theme, "it's the band's abandonment of digitally manipulated perfection in favor of rawer guitars and more immediate vocal performances." He added that, overall, the album is "far less commercially accommodating than any of the band's previous work. It embraces no particular sound or style. It comes across with ideas and commentary that challenge rather than coerce, and the playing lacks the burnished, artificial quality that's characteristic of so much youth-oriented music these days."<ref name="Isthmus"/>

[[NME]]'s Peter Robinson wrote that the album was a "departure from the sound Garbage had established on their first two records"; It is "marked by expanding on the musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds that mix rock with hip hop, electronica, new wave, and girl groups."<ref name="cs" /> [[Sound on Sound]] described the band's approach to recording guitars as "distinctive", observing the "distorted crunches cheek-by-jowl with delicate acoustics and treated sounds which are almost unrecognizable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun02/articles/garbage.asp |title=RECORDING GARBAGE |publisher =soundonsound.com |accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>

Michael Paoletta of [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] remarked that audiences expecting "more of the same (that is, the predecessor, ''Version 2.0'') are in for a wonderful surprise. [The album] finds [the band] eschewing disco-infused electronica foundations for more straight-up rock'n'pop ... The anthemic 'Parade' is lyrically deft, questioning all those cookie-cutter wannabes. With the spiky (and transgendered) 'Cherry Lips', replete with 'Chapel of Love'-styled wedding-bell chimes, Garbage has created a storyline for film director [[Gus Van Sant]]. Modern tales for modern times, sung by the vocally versatile Manson, make for one of the year's best."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bhEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=billboard+beautiful+garbage&source=bl&ots=4YkW0GRixA&sig=LLzbIQ2SeS9EzfI4vuSaj2tcZ9o&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0khHVLGiH8a-8gGpsYDIBg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=billboard%20beautiful%20garbage&f=false |title=Garbage - Beautifulgarbage |last=Paoletta|first=Michael|publisher =[[Billboard (magazine)]] |date=13 October 2001|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>

[[Q (magazine)|Q]] described it as "sharp, seductive music from a band at their peak."<ref name="booksamillion.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.booksamillion.com/p/Beautiful-Garbage/Garbage/X606949311520#music_review |title=Beautiful Garbage by Garbage - Music Reviews|website=[[Books-A-Million]] |accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> [[Uncut (magazine)|UNCUT]] gave the album 4.5/5 stars, calling it "their most accomplished and convincing album yet."<ref name="booksamillion.com"/>

[[AllMusic]]'s Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that Garbage's penchant for absorbing elements from various genres, skillfully crafting them together is more evident in this album, in how they "approximate contemporary R&B with the sultry 'Androgyny', or the Minneapolis new wave bubblegum funk of 'Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!),' or the bluesy [[PJ Harvey]] strut of 'Silence Is Golden.'" This penchant is enhanced by an "unabashedly pop coating, an element that Garbage clearly revel in, as well as should the listener. This is every bit as enticingly postmodern as their other albums, and it sounds distinctly Garbage", and although the [[Music genre#Fusion|fusion]] elements are perceptible, "they seem less like magpies, more themselves, which means Beautiful Garbage is a more consistent record."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/beautiful-garbage-mw0000014547|title=Garbage - Beautiful Garbage Review|last=Erlewine, Thomas|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref>

David Browne of [[Entertainment Weekly]] observed Manson's continued "aggressive bite" complemented by "throbbing tracks like 'Till the Day I Die' and 'Shut Your Mouth'", as well as exposing "tender aspects" in "heartfelt" and "subdued" songs like 'Cup of Coffee' and 'So Like a Rose'. He noted however that the band's "experiments with sonic expansion yield more mixed results"; "They thaw their sound by adding elements of trip-hop, which works for 'Cup of Coffee' and the first single, 'Androgyny' ... But on a record that's more self-consciously varied than 1998's ''[[Version 2.0]]'' other attempts are gimmicky and less successful, like the girl-group opulence of the cloying 'Can't Cry These Tears' and the dated, '80s-new-wave bounce of 'Parade'. (Granted, the lyrics of the latter - "So let's pray for something/To feel good in the morning" - take on a new relevance now.) If you didn't know better, you'd think you were listening to a compilation, not a band album. Still, there's just enough to salvage from ''beautifulgarbage''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254200,00.html|title=beautifulgarbage Review|last=Browne|first=David|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1 October 2001|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>
