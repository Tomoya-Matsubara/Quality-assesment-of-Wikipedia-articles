'''Mendelevium''' is a [[synthetic element]] with [[chemical symbol]] '''Md''' (formerly '''Mv''') and [[atomic number]] 101. A metallic [[radioactive]] [[transuranic]] element in the [[actinide]] series, it is the first element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through [[neutron]] bombardment of lighter elements. It is the [[wikt:antepenultimate|antepenultimate]] actinide and the ninth [[transuranic element]]. It can only be produced in [[particle accelerator]]s by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being <sup>258</sup>Md with a [[half-life]] of 51&nbsp;days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived <sup>256</sup>Md (half-life 1.27&nbsp;[[hour]]s) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.

Mendelevium was discovered by bombarding [[einsteinium]] with [[alpha particle]]s in 1955, the same method still used to produce it today. It was named after [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], father of the [[periodic table]] of the chemical elements. Using available [[microgram]] quantities of the isotope einsteinium-253, over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced each hour. The chemistry of mendelevium is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced mendelevium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside of basic scientific research.

==Discovery==

Mendelevium was the ninth [[transuranic element]] to be synthesized. It was first [[discovery of the chemical elements|synthesized]] by [[Albert Ghiorso]], [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], Gregory R. Choppin, Bernard G. Harvey, and team leader [[Stanley G. Thompson]] in early 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced <sup>256</sup>Md ([[half-life]] of 87 minutes) when they bombarded an <sup>253</sup>[[einsteinium|Es]] target consisting of only a [[billion]] einsteinium atoms with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] nuclei) in the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]]'s 60-inch [[cyclotron]], thus increasing the target's atomic number by two. <sup>256</sup>Md thus became the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time. In total, seventeen mendelevium atoms were produced.<ref name=discovery>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.98.1518|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e53sNAOXrdMC&pg=PA101|title=New Element Mendelevium, Atomic Number 101|year=1955|last1=Ghiorso|first1=A.|last2=Harvey|first2=B.|last3=Choppin|first3=G.|last4=Thompson|first4=S.|last5=Seaborg|first5=G.|journal=Physical Review|volume=98|pages=1518|bibcode = 1955PhRv...98.1518G|isbn=9789810214401|issue=5 }}</ref> This discovery was part of a program, begun in 1952, that irradiated [[plutonium]] with neutrons to transmute it into heavier actinides.<ref name="Choppin">{{cite journal|first = Gregory R.|last = Choppin|year = 2003 |title = Mendelevium|journal = Chemical and Engineering News|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/mendelevium.html|volume = 81|issue = 36}}</ref> This method was necessary as the previous method used to synthesize transuranic elements, [[neutron]] capture, could not work because of a lack of [[beta decay]]ing [[isotopes of fermium]] that would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium, and also due to the very short half-life to [[spontaneous fission]] of fermium-258 that thus constituted a hard limit to the success of the neutron capture process.<ref name=NUBASE/>

To predict if the production of mendelevium would be possible, the team made use of a rough calculation. The number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal to the product of the number of atoms of target material, the target's cross section, the ion beam intensity, and the time of bombardment; this last factor was related to the half-life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half-life. This gave one atom per experiment. Thus under optimum conditions, the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be expected. This calculation demonstrated that it was feasible to go ahead with the experiment.<ref name=discovery/> The target material, einsteinium-253, could be produced readily from irradiating [[plutonium]]: one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms, and its three-week [[half-life]] meant that the element 101 experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target. However, it was necessary to upgrade the cyclotron to obtain the needed intensity of 10<sup>14</sup> alpha particles per second; Seaborg applied for the necessary funds.<ref name=Choppin/>

[[File:Md datasheet.jpg|thumb|left|The data sheet, showing stylus tracing and notes, that proved the discovery of mendelevium.]]
While Seaborg applied for funding, Harvey worked on the einsteinium target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using [[<U+03B1>-hydroxyisobutyric acid]] to separate the mendelevium atoms from those of the lighter actinides.<ref name=Choppin/> The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed on the opposite side of the target from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough [[momentum]] to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material.<ref name=discovery/> The recoil target consisted of 10<sup>9</sup> atoms of <sup>253</sup>Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] [[alpha particle]]s in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6<U+00D7>10<sup>13</sup> particles per second over an area of 0.05&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium, and the foil could be replaced.<ref name=discovery/><ref name=book1>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4KcVj3xqsrAC&pg=PA40|pages=40<U+2013>42|title=On beyond uranium: journey to the end of the periodic table|author=Hofmann, Sigurd|publisher=CRC Press&year=2002|isbn=0-415-28496-1|year=2002}}</ref> The removal of the mendelevium atoms from the collector foil was done by acid etching or total dissolution of the thin gold foil.<ref name=Choppin/><ref name=book2>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C&pg=PA11|pages=9<U+2013>11|title=The new chemistry|author=Hall, Nina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-521-45224-4}}</ref>

Initial experiments were carried out in September 1954. No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms; thus, Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by [[electron capture]] to [[fermium]] and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for [[spontaneous fission]] events.<ref name=Choppin/> The repetition of the experiment happened in February 1955.<ref name=Choppin/>

[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|thumb|right|The element was named after Dmitri Mendeleev.]]
On the day of discovery, 19 February, alpha irradiation of the einsteinium target occurred in three three-hour sessions. The cyclotron was in the [[University of California]] campus, while the Radiation Laboratory was on the next hill. To deal with this situation, a complex procedure was used: Ghiorso took the catcher foils (there were three targets and three foils) from the cyclotron to Harvey, who would use [[aqua regia]] to dissolve it and pass it through an [[anion]]-exchange [[resin]] column to separate out the [[transuranium element]]s from the gold and other products. The resultant drops entered a [[test tube]], which Choppin and Ghiorso took in a car to get to the Radiation Laboratory as soon as possible. There Thompson and Choppin used a [[cation]]-exchange resin column and the <U+03B1>-hydroxyisobutyric acid. The solution drops were collected on [[platinum]] disks and dried under heat lamps. The three disks were expected to contain respectively the fermium, no new elements, and the mendelevium. Finally, they were placed in their own counters, which were connected to recorders such that spontaneous fission events would be recorded as huge deflections in a graph showing the number and time of the decays. There thus was no direct detection, but by observation of spontaneous fission events arising from its electron-capture daughter <sup>256</sup>Fm. The first one was identified with a "hooray" followed by a "double hooray" and a "triple hooray". The fourth one eventually officially proved the chemical identification of the 101st element, mendelevium. In total, five decays were reported up till 4&nbsp;a.m. Seaborg was notified and the team left to sleep.<ref name=Choppin/> Additional analysis and further experimentation showed the produced mendelevium isotope to have mass 256 and to decay by electron capture with a half-life of 1.5&nbsp;h.<ref name=NUBASE/>

Being the first of the second hundred of the chemical elements, it was decided that the element would be named "mendelevium" after the Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], father of the [[periodic table]]. Due to the fact that this discovery came during the [[Cold War]], Seaborg had to request permission of the government of the [[United States]] to name the element for a Russian, but it was granted.<ref name=Choppin/> The name "mendelevium" was accepted by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) in 1955 with symbol "Mv",<ref>{{cite book |title=Comptes rendus de la conf<U+00E8>rence IUPAC|year=1955|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WJhYAAAAYAAJ |author1=Chemistry |first1=International Union of Pure and Applied}}</ref> which was changed to "Md" in the next IUPAC General Assembly (Paris, 1957).<ref>{{cite book |title=Comptes rendus de la conf<U+00E8>rence IUPAC|year=1957|url=http://books.google.com/?id=f5hYAAAAYAAJ |author1=Chemistry |first1=International Union of Pure and Applied}}</ref>

In the [[periodic table]], mendelevium is located to the right of the actinide [[fermium]], to the left of the actinide [[nobelium]], and below the lanthanide [[thulium]]. Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and cannot be thus prepared using current methods.<ref name=Silva16345>Silva, pp. 1634<U+2013>5</ref> Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties.<ref name=Silva16345/>

The lanthanides and actinides, in the metallic state, can exist as either divalent (such as [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]]) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have f<sup>''n''</sup>d<sup>1</sup>s<sup>2</sup> configurations, whereas the latter have f<sup>''n''+1</sup>s<sup>2</sup> configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted values for the [[cohesive energy|cohesive energies]] ([[enthalpy|enthalpies]] of crystallization) of the metallic [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s, both as divalent and trivalent metals.<ref name=Silva16268>Silva, pp. 1626<U+2013>8</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.11.2836|title=Generalized phase diagram for the rare-earth elements: Calculations and correlations of bulk properties|year=1975|last1=Johansson|first1=B<U+00F6>rje|last2=Rosengren|first2=Anders|journal=Physical Review B|volume=11|pages=2836|bibcode = 1975PhRvB..11.2836J|issue=8 }}</ref> The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the [Rn]5f<sup>12</sup>6d<sup>1</sup>7s<sup>2</sup> configuration over the [Rn]5f<sup>13</sup>7s<sup>2</sup> configuration for mendelevium was not enough to compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], mendelevium, and [[nobelium]] were expected to be divalent metals.<ref name=Silva16268/> [[Thermochromatography|Thermochromatographic]] studies with trace quantities of mendelevium by Zvara and H<U+00FC>bener from 1976 to 1982 confirmed this prediction.<ref name=Silva16345/> In 1990, Haire and Gibson estimated mendelevium metal to have an [[enthalpy of sublimation]] between 134 and 142&nbsp;kJ<U+00B7>mol<sup><U+2212>1</sup>.<ref name=Silva16345/> Divalent mendelevium metal should have a [[metallic radius]] of around (194&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;10)&nbsp;[[picometer|pm]].<ref name=Silva16345/> Mendelevium's melting point has been estimated at 827&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.<ref>{{cite book|ref=Haynes|editor=Haynes, William M.|year=2011|title= CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition=92nd ed.|publisher= CRC Press|isbn=1439855110|pages=4.121<U+2013>4.123}}</ref>

===Chemical===
The chemistry of mendelevium is mostly known only in solution, in which it can take on the +3 or +2 [[oxidation state]]s. The +1 state has also been reported, but has not yet been confirmed.<ref name=Silva16356>Silva, pp. 1635<U+2013>6</ref>

Before mendelevium's discovery, [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Seaborg]] and Katz predicted that it should be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it [[elution|eluted]] just after fermium in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble [[hydroxide]]s and [[fluoride]]s that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts.<ref name=Silva16356/> Cation-exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide, fermium.<ref name=Silva16356/> Mendelevium can form [[coordination complex]]es with 1,2-cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid (DCTA).<ref name=Silva16356/>

In [[redox|reducing]] conditions, mendelevium(III) can be easily reduced to mendelevium(II), which is stable in aqueous solution.<ref name=Silva16356/> The [[standard reduction potential]] of the ''E''<U+00B0>(Md<sup>3+</sup><U+2192>Md<sup>2+</sup>) couple has been variously estimated as <U+2212>0.10&nbsp;V or <U+2212>0.20&nbsp;V.<ref name=Silva16356/> In comparison, ''E''<U+00B0>(Md<sup>3+</sup><U+2192>Md) should be around <U+2212>1.74&nbsp;V, and ''E''<U+00B0>(Md<sup>2+</sup><U+2192>Md) should be around <U+2212>2.5&nbsp;V.<ref name=Silva16356/> Mendelevium(II)'s elution behavior has been compared with that of [[strontium]](II) and [[europium]](II).<ref name=Silva16356/>

In 1973, mendelevium(I) was reported to have been produced by Russian scientists, who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with [[samarium]](II). It was found to be stable in neutral water<U+2013>[[ethanol]] solution and be homologous to [[caesium]](I). However, later experiments found no evidence for mendelevium(I) and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced, not like the monovalent [[alkali metal]]s.<ref name=Silva16356/> Nevertheless, the Russian team conducted further studies on the [[thermodynamics]] of cocrystallizing mendelevium with alkali metal [[chloride]]s, and concluded that mendelevium(I) had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements, thus cocrystallizing with them. The status of the +1 oxidation state is still tentative.<ref name=Silva16356/>

Although ''E''<U+00B0>(Md<sup>4+</sup><U+2192>Md<sup>3+</sup>) was predicted in 1975 to be +5.4&nbsp;V, suggesting that mendelevium(III) could be easily oxidized to mendelevium(IV), 1967 experiments with the strong oxidizing agent [[sodium bismuthate]] were unable to oxidize mendelevium(III) to mendelevium(IV).<ref name=Silva16356/>

===Atomic===
A mendelevium atom has 101 electrons, of which at least three (and perhaps four) can act as valence electrons. They are expected to be arranged in the configuration [Rn]5f<sup>13</sup>7s<sup>2</sup> (ground state term symbol <sup>2</sup>F<sub>7/2</sub>), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006.<ref name=Silva16334>Silva, pp. 1633<U+2013>4</ref> In forming compounds, three valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a [Rn]5f<sup>12</sup> core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their [Rn]&nbsp;5f<sup>''n''</sup> electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first [[ionization potential]] of mendelevium was measured to be at most (6.58&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;0.07)&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones;<ref name=NIST>{{cite journal |first1=W.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of mendelevium}}

Sixteen isotopes of mendelevium are known, with mass numbers from 245 to 260; all are radioactive.<ref name=Silva16301>Silva, pp. 1630<U+2013>1</ref> Additionally, five [[nuclear isomer]]s are known: <sup>245m</sup>Md, <sup>247m</sup>Md, <sup>249m</sup>Md, <sup>254m</sup>Md, and <sup>258m</sup>Md.<ref name=unc>http://www.nucleonica.net/unc.aspx</ref><ref name=NUBASE/> Of these, the longest-lived isotope is <sup>258</sup>Md with a half-life of 51.5&nbsp;days, and the longest-lived isomer is <sup>258m</sup>Md with a half-life of 58.0&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=unc/><ref name="NUBASE">{{NUBASE 2003}}</ref> Nevertheless, the slightly shorter-lived <sup>256</sup>Md (half-life 1.27&nbsp;hours) is more often used in chemical experimentation because it can be produced in larger quantities from [[alpha particle]] irradiation of einsteinium.<ref name=Silva16301/> After <sup>258</sup>Md, the next most stable mendelevium isotopes are <sup>260</sup>Md with a half-life of 31.8&nbsp;days, <sup>257</sup>Md with a half-life of 5.52&nbsp;hours, <sup>259</sup>Md with a half-life of 1.60&nbsp;hours, and <sup>256</sup>Md with a half-life of 1.27&nbsp;hours. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than an hour, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=Silva16301/><ref name=unc/><ref name=NUBASE/>

The half-lives of mendelevium isotopes mostly increase smoothly from <sup>245</sup>Md onwards, reaching a maximum at <sup>258</sup>Md.<ref name=Silva16301/><ref name=unc/><ref name=NUBASE/> Experiments and predictions suggest that the half-lives will then decrease, apart from <sup>260</sup>Md with a half-life of 31.8&nbsp;days,<ref name=Silva16301/><ref name=unc/><ref name=NUBASE/> as [[spontaneous fission]] becomes the dominant decay mode<ref name=NUBASE/> due to the mutual repulsion of the protons posing a limit to the [[island of stability|island of relative stability]] of long-lived nuclei in the [[actinide]] series.<ref name=Nurmia>{{cite journal|first = Matti|last = Nurmia|year = 2003 |title = Nobelium|journal = Chemical and Engineering News|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/nobelium.html|volume = 81|issue = 36}}</ref>

Mendelevium-256, the chemically most important isotope of mendelevium, decays through [[electron capture]] 90.7% of the time and [[alpha decay]] 9.9% of the time.<ref name=Silva16301/> It is most easily detected through the [[spontaneous fission]] of its electron-capture daughter [[fermium-256]], but in the presence of other nuclides that undergo spontaneous fission, alpha decays at the characteristic energies for mendelevium-256 (7.205 and 7.139&nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]]) can provide more useful identification.<ref name=Silva16313/>

==Production and isolation==
The lightest mendelevium isotopes (<sup>245</sup>Md to <sup>247</sup>Md) are mostly produced through bombardment of [[bismuth]] targets with heavy [[argon]] ions, while slightly heavier ones (<sup>248</sup>Md to <sup>253</sup>Md) are produced by bombarding [[plutonium]] and [[americium]] targets with lighter ions of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. The most important and most stable isotopes are in the range from <sup>254</sup>Md to <sup>258</sup>Md and are produced through bombardment of einsteinium isotopes with alpha particles: einsteinium-253, -254, and -255 can all be used. <sup>259</sup>Md is produced as a [[decay product|daughter]] of <sup>259</sup>[[nobelium|No]], and <sup>260</sup>Md can be produced in a [[transfer reaction]] between einsteinium-254 and [[oxygen-18]].<ref name=Silva16301/> Typically, the most commonly used isotope <sup>256</sup>Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium-253 or -254 with alpha particles: einsteinium-254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half-life and therefore can be used as a target for longer.<ref name=Silva16301/> Using available microgram quantities of einsteinium, [[femtogram]] quantities of mendelevium-256 may be produced.<ref name=Silva16301/>

The recoil [[momentum]] of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually [[beryllium]], [[aluminium]], [[platinum]], or [[gold]]) just behind the target in a vacuum.<ref name=Silva16313>Silva, pp. 1631<U+2013>3</ref> This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target.<ref name=Silva16313/> The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently [[helium]]), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along.<ref name=Silva16313/> Using a long [[capillary tube]], and including [[potassium chloride]] aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of [[metre]]s to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined.<ref name=book2/><ref name=Silva16313/> The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other [[fission product]]s by applying acid to the foil and then [[coprecipitation|coprecipitating]] the mendelevium with [[lanthanum fluoride]], then using a [[cation-exchange]] resin column with a 10% [[ethanol]] solution saturated with [[hydrochloric acid]], acting as an [[eluant]]. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in [[aqua regia]] before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using [[anion-exchange]] [[chromatography]], the eluant being 6&nbsp;M&nbsp;hydrochloric acid.<ref name=Silva16313/>

Mendelevium can finally be separated from the other trivalent actinides using selective elution from a cation-exchange resin column, the eluant being [[ammonia <U+03B1>-HIB]].<ref name=Silva16313/> Using the gas-jet method often renders the first two steps unnecessary.<ref name=Silva16313/> The above procedure is the most commonly used one for the separation of transeinsteinium elements.<ref name=Silva16313/>

Another possible way to separate the trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using [[bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid]] (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and [[nitric acid]] as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.<ref name=book2/><ref name=Silva16313/>

Another method to isolate mendelevium exploits the distinct elution properties of Md<sup>2+</sup> from those of Es<sup>3+</sup> and Fm<sup>3+</sup>. The initial steps are the same as above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with [[terbium fluoride]] instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50&nbsp;mg of [[chromium]] is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1&nbsp;M&nbsp;hydrochloric acid with [[zinc]] or [[mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name=Silva16313/> The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using [[hydrogen peroxide]] and then isolated by selective elution with 2&nbsp;M&nbsp;hydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6&nbsp;M&nbsp;hydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium).<ref name=Silva16313/> It is also possible to use a column of [[cationite]] and zinc amalgam, using 1&nbsp;M&nbsp;hydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the [[alkaline earth metals]].<ref name=Silva16313/> Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium [[hexafluoroacetylacetonate]]: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.<ref name=Silva16313/>
