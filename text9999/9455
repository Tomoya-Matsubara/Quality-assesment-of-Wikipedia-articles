Leopold von Sedlnitzky was a [[nineteenth century]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[bishop of Wroc<U+0142>aw]], who after abdicating as [[bishop]] converted to [[Protestantism]].

==Early Life==

Leopold von Sedlnitzky also known as Count Leopold Sedlnitzky Odrow<U+0105><U+017C> Choltitz  was born July 29 1787 in [[Rzedziwojowice|Geppersdorf]], [[Austrian Silesia]].<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bsedl.html   Catholic Heirachy].com</ref> He came from the Moravian-Silesian [[nobility|noble family]] of [[Sedlnitzky Choltitz]]. His parents, Joseph Imperial Count of Sedlnitzky and Maria Josepha, Countess of Haugwitz influenced his spiritual outlook early on. His brother Joseph was an Austrian civil servant. 

==Career==

He studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the [[University of Wroc<U+0142>aw]] but returned home to continue his studies privately in 1807 when Wroc<U+0142>aw was affected by the [[Napoleonic wars]]. He graduated and was [[ordination|ordained]] in 1811.

In 1819 he became a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] in [[Wroclaw]] and  in 1830, with royal support, provost. In December 1832 he was made a [[vicar]]. 

The [[Prussian]] government chose him to be [[bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wroc<U+0142>aw|Wroc<U+0142>aw]] in 1835, but was forced by the [[pope]] to [[abdicate]] in October 1840. <ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bsedl.html   Catholic Heirachy].com</ref> After abdicating he moved to [[Berlin]] where he was made a privy-councillor by King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]].<ref>Isaac August Dorner (ed.): Autobiography of Count Leopold of Sedlnitzky Choltitz. Berlin 1872 Berlin 1872 </ref><ref> Constantin von Wurzbach : Sedlnitzky, Leopold Count In. Biographical Dictionary of the Empire of Austria . Volume 33, published by LC Zamarski, Vienna, 1877, pp. 295-299.</ref> 

Then On 30 November 1862 he became a [[protestant]].

His interest in education continued as a protestant. He founded the Paulinum, a dormitory for Protestant high school students, and in 1869 the Johanneum, a boarding school for Protestant theology students. In his will, he also gave to the Wroclaw Evangelical Theological college.

==Churchmanship==

In his youth he was accused of membership of the [[Johann Michael Sailer]] Society, and as Prince-Bishop  he was neither clear nor firm in his maintenance of the doctrines of the Church including on the question of [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s. As Bishop held a toleration of non-Catholic children's education.  [[Pope Gregory XVI]], asked him to resigned his see in 1840, afterwhich he went to [[Berlin]], and where he became a [[Protestant]] in 1862. 

In 1871 he died in Berlin and was buried on the Protestant cemetery in R<U+0119>k<U+00F3>w, [[Sob<U+00F3>tka]](Poland).
