'''American Airlines Flight 77''' was the third flight [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] as part of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and it was deliberately crashed into the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]].  The scheduled [[United States|U.S.]] domestic flight from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], near [[Washington, D.C.]], to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] was hijacked by five individuals less than 35&nbsp;minutes into the flight.  The hijackers stormed the cockpit and forced the passengers to the rear of the aircraft. [[Hani Hanjour]], one of the hijackers trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard were able to make calls to loved ones and relay information on the hijacking.

The aircraft crashed into the western facade of the Pentagon at 09:37&nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. All 64 people on board and 125 in the building were killed, including the hijackers. Dozens of people witnessed the crash and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and ignited a large fire. A portion of the Pentagon collapsed and firefighters spent days trying to fully extinguish the blaze. Subsequent investigation recovered hundreds of identifiable human remains. The damage to the Pentagon was later rebuilt and as of 2008, an outdoor memorial is being completed at the crash site.

===Hijacking===
The [[9/11 Commission]] estimated that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, just minutes after [[American Airlines Flight 11|the first hijacked plane]] had struck the [[World Trade Center]] in [[Manhattan]] at 08:46. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to [[air traffic control]] occurred at 08:50:51.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gregor |first=Joseph A. |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/ATC_%20Report_AA77.pdf |format=PDF|title=ATC Report American Airlines Flight 77 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref> At 08:54, American Airlines Flight&nbsp;77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south.<ref name="911-ch1"/> The hijackers set the flight's [[autopilot]] heading for Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/autopilot_AA77_UA93_study.pdf |format=PDF|title=Study of Autopilot, Navigation Equipment, and Fuel Consumption Activity Based on United Airlines Flight&nbsp;93 and American Airlines Flight&nbsp;77 Digital Flight Data Recorder Information |last=O<U+2019>Callaghan |first=John |coauthors=Bower, Daniel |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2002-02-13 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref> By 08:56, the flight was turned around, and the [[transponder]] had been disabled. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] was aware at this point that there was an emergency aboard the plane. By this time, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] had already crashed into the [[World Trade Center]], and [[United Airlines Flight 175]] was known to have been hijacked. After learning of this second hijacking involving American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving [[United Airlines]], American Airlines Executive Vice President Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline.<ref name="911-ch1"/> The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft. At the time the plane was hijacked, it was flying over an area of limited radar coverage.<ref name="Wash4">{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Don |title=Pentagon Crash Highlights a Radar Gap; Limited System in One Area Made Flight&nbsp;77 Invisible to Controllers for Half-Hour |date=2001-11-03 |work = The Washington Post}}</ref> With air controllers unable to contact the flight by radio, an Indianapolis official declared that the plane had possibly crashed at 09:09.<ref name="Wash4" />

Two people on American Airlines Flight&nbsp;77 made phone calls to contacts on the ground. At 09:12, flight attendant Renee May called her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas.<ref name="Summary" /> During the call, which lasted nearly two minutes, May said her flight was being hijacked by six individuals and they had been moved to the rear of the plane.<ref name="911-ch1"/><ref name="Summary" /> May also asked her mother to contact American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did.<ref name="911-ch1"/> American Airlines was already aware of the hijacking.

A plane was detected again by Dulles controllers on radar screens as it approached Washington, turning and descending rapidly.

The pilot, Lt. Col. [[Steven O'Brien]], told them it was a Boeing&nbsp;757 or 767, and its silver fuselage meant it was probably an American Airlines jet. He had difficulty picking out the plane in the "East Coast haze", but then saw a "huge" fireball, and initially assumed it had hit the ground. Approaching the Pentagon, he saw the west side and reported to Reagan control, "Looks like that aircraft crashed into the Pentagon sir".<ref name="911-ch1" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Schmitt |first=Eric |coauthors=Lichtblau, Eric |title=To the Minute, Panel Paints a Grim Portrait of Day's Terror |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/18/politics/18minutes.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5007&en=c6fa52b1957732f6&ex=1402977600&partner=USERLAND |date=2004-06-18 |work = The New York Times |accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref>

''[[USA Today]]'' reporter Mike Walter was driving on Washington Boulevard, also witnessed the crash and remarked: "I looked out my window and I saw this plane, this jet, an American Airlines jet, coming.

Rescue efforts began immediately after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within half an hour of the impact.<ref name="Pent51">Goldberg et al., p. 51.</ref> Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building. Within minutes, the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards.<ref name="Pent51" /> The [[Arlington County Fire Department]] (ACFD) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10&nbsp;minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented the [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies.<ref>Goldberg et al., p. 72.</ref> It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational.<ref>Goldberg et al., p. 77.</ref> Firefighters from [[Fort Myer]] and [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan National]] arrived within minutes.<ref>Goldberg et al., p. 78.</ref><ref name="acfd">{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/Fire/edu/about/docs/after_report.pdf |format=PDF|title=Arlington, Virginia After-Action Report |publisher=[[Arlington County Fire Department]] |accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.<ref name="Pent80">Goldberg et al., pp. 80<U+2013>82.</ref>

As firefighters attempted to extinguish the fires, they watched the building in fear of a structural collapse. One firefighter remarked that they "pretty much knew the building was going to collapse because it started making weird sounds and creaking".<ref name="Pent80" /> Officials saw a cornice of the building move and ordered an evacuation. Minutes later, at 10:15, the upper floors of the damaged area of the Pentagon collapsed.<ref name="Pent80" /> The collapse area was about {{convert|95|ft|m|0}} at its widest point and {{convert|50|ft|m|0}} at its deepest.<ref name="Pent80" /> This amount of time between impact and collapse allowed everyone on the fourth and fifth levels to evacuate safely before the structure collapsed.<ref>Goldberg et al., p. 20.</ref> After the collapse, the interior fires intensified, spreading through all five floors.<ref name="Pent86">Goldberg et al., pp. 86<U+2013>90.</ref> After 11:00, firefighters mounted a two-pronged attack against the fires. Officials estimated temperatures of up to {{convert|2000|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}}.<ref name="Pent86" /> While progress was made against the interior fires by late afternoon, firefighters realized a flammable layer of wood under the Pentagon's slate roof had caught fire and begun to spread.<ref name="Pent91">Goldberg et al., pp. 91<U+2013>95.</ref> Typical firefighting tactics were rendered useless by the reinforced structure as firefighters were unable to reach the fire to extinguish it.<ref name="Pent91" /> Firefighters instead made [[firebreak]]s in the roof on [[September 12]] to prevent any further spreading. At 18:00 on the 12th, Arlington County issued a press release stating the fire was "controlled" but not fully "extinguished". Firefighters continued to put out smaller fires that ignited in the succeeding days.<ref name="Pent91" />

===Conspiracy theories===
{{main|9/11 conspiracy theories#Pentagon not hit by a Boeing 757|l1=9/11 conspiracy theories}}
The 9/11 attacks have spawned a number of conspiracy theories challenging 
the mainstream account. One of the most well-known theories was put forward by [[Thierry Meyssan]] which contends that the Pentagon was not hit by a Boeing&nbsp;757, but by a missile launched by the American military.<ref name="CNNFRA">{{cite web |author=Bittermann, Jim |title=French buy into 9/11 conspiracy |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/06/26/france.book/ |publisher=CNN |date=2002-06-26 |accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref> Proponents say that the {{convert|75|ft|m|sing=on}} hole is too small to account for an aircraft with a wingspan of {{convert|124|ft|m|0}}.<ref name="TIMEGO">{{cite news |last=Grossman |first=Lev |title=Why the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories Won't Go Away |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1531304,00.html |work=Time |date=2006-09-03 |accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref> Conspiracy advocates also point to other minutiae such as small amount of debris or condition grass on the lawn.<ref name="TIMEGO">Page 3</ref> Mete Sozen, a member of the [[ASCE]] team onsite after the crash, explained that an airplane does not create a "cartoon-like outline of itself" when crashing into a [[reinforced concrete]] building.<ref name="PopMec">{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/1227842.html?page=6 |title=Debunking the 9/11 Myths: Special Report |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=March 2005 |accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref> The documentary film ''[[Loose Change (film)|Loose Change]]'' asserts that there were no discernible pieces of debris from Flight&nbsp;77.<ref>{{cite video |people=Dylan Avery (Director) |date2=2006-06-01 |title=Loose Change: Second Edition |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0831315/ |medium=Documentary |publisher=Louder than Words |accessdate=2008-06-21 |time=0:15:55}}</ref> Blast expert Allyn E. Kilsheimer was the first structural engineer to arrive at the Pentagon after the crash and helped coordinate the emergency response. He states that Flight&nbsp;77 "was absolutely a plane. I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the building. I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them. I held in my hand the tail section of the plane, and I found the black box." In addition, Kilsheimer's account is supported by the photos of plane wreckage inside and outside the building.<ref name="PopMec" />
