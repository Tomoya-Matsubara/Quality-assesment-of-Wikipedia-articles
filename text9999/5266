The '''United Church of Christ''' ('''UCC''') is a [[mainline Protestant|mainline]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian denomination]] primarily in the [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] tradition but also historically influenced by [[Lutheranism]].<ref name=formulaagreement>[http://www.ucc.org/ecumenical/lutheranreformed-formula-of.html Lutheran/Reformed 'Formula of Agreement]</ref><ref name=reformroots>[http://www.ucc.org/about-us/short-course/our-reformation-roots.html Our Reformation Roots]</ref>  The [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]] and the [[Congregational Christian Churches]] united in 1957 to form the UCC. These two denominations, which were themselves the result of earlier unions, had their roots in Congregational, Evangelical, and Reformed denominations. The UCC's 5,287 congregations claim 1,080,199 members, primarily in the [[United States]].<ref name="UCC-report">{{Cite web| title = 2010 Annual Report| url = http://www.ucc.org/about-us/2010-annual-report.html| accessdate = 2011-05-23}}</ref>

The UCC maintains [[full communion]] with other mainline Protestant denominations, while many congregations choose to practice [[open communion]].<ref>http://www.ucc.org/ecumenical/ecumenical-partnerships-and.html</ref> The denomination places high emphasis on participation in worldwide [[interfaith]] and [[ecumenical]] efforts.<ref>http://www.ucc.org/ecumenical/interfaith-relations.html</ref><ref>http://www.ucc.org/ecumenical/</ref> The national settings of the UCC have historically favored [[liberalism|liberal]] views on social issues, such as [[civil rights]], [[gay rights]], [[women's rights]] and [[abortion rights]]. However, United Church of Christ congregations are independent in matters of doctrine and ministry and may not necessarily support the national body's theological or moral stances. It is self-described as "an extremely pluralistic and diverse denomination".<ref name="Zikmund">Zikmund, Barbara B.

Within this locally-focused structure, however, there are central beliefs common to the UCC. The UCC often uses four words to describe itself: "[[Christian]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]], [[Congregational]] and [[Protestantism|Evangelical]]".<ref name ="UCC-BriefHistory">{{Cite web

The UCC is generally [[Liberal Christianity|theologically liberal]], and the denomination notes that the "Bible, ''though written in specific historical times and places'', still speaks to us in our present condition".<ref name ="UCC-BriefHistory" />

The motto of the United Church of Christ comes from [[John 17:21]]: "That they may all be one". The denomination's official literature uses broad doctrinal parameters, emphasizing freedom of individual conscience and local church autonomy.

===Historic confessions===
In the United Church of Christ, [[creed]]s, [[Confession of faith|confessions]], and affirmations of faith function as "testimonies of faith" around which the church gathers rather than as "tests of faith" rigidly prescribing required doctrinal consent. As expressed in the United Church of Christ constitution:

<blockquote>The United Church of Christ acknowledges as its sole Head, Jesus Christ, Son of God and Savior. It acknowledges as kindred in Christ all who share in this confession. It looks to the Word of God in the Scriptures, and to the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, to prosper its creative and redemptive work in the world. It claims as its own the faith of the historic Church expressed in the ancient creeds and reclaimed in the basic insights of the Protestant Reformers. It affirms the responsibility of the Church in each generation to make this faith its own in reality of worship, in honesty of thought and expression, and in purity of heart before God. In accordance with the teaching of our Lord and the practice prevailing among evangelical Christians, it recognizes two sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion.<ref name="UCC-Constitution" /></blockquote>

The denomination, therefore, looks to a number of historic confessions as expressing the common faith around which the church gathers, including:
* The [[Apostles' Creed]],
* The [[Nicene Creed]],
* The [[Heidelberg Catechism]] (inherited from both the German Reformed and German Evangelical heritages),
* [[Luther's Small Catechism]] (inherited from the German Evangelical heritage),
* The [[Kansas City Statement of Faith]] (a 1913 statement in the Congregationalist tradition),
* The Evangelical Catechism (a 1927 catechism in the German Evangelical tradition), and
* The [[Statement of Faith of the United Church of Christ]] (written at the founding of the denomination).

===Studies and surveys of beliefs===
In 2001, Hartford Institute for Religion Research did a "Faith Communities Today" (FACT) study<ref name="UCC-denom ident">{{cite web | last=Lang | first=Andy | authorlink= | coauthors= |date= | year=2001 | month=April | url=http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/apr01/identity.htm | title=Denominational identity still important | work= | pages= |publisher=ucc.org | language= | accessdate=2006-12-24 | curly= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061220052944/http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/apr01/identity.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-20}}</ref> that included a survey of United Church of Christ beliefs. Among the results of this were findings that in the UCC, 5.6% of the churches responding to the survey described their members as "very liberal or progressive," 3.4% as "very conservative," 22.4% as "somewhat liberal or progressive," and 23.6% as "somewhat conservative." Those results suggested a nearly equal balance between liberal and conservative congregations. The self-described "moderate" group, however, was the largest at 45%. Other statistics found by the Hartford Institute show that 53.2% of members say "the Bible" is the highest source of authority, 16.1% say the "Holy Spirit," 9.2% say "Reason," 6.3% say "Experience," and 6.1% say "Creeds."

David Roozen, director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research who has studied the United Church of Christ, said surveys show the national church's pronouncements are often more liberal than the views in the pews but that its governing structure is set up to allow such disagreements.<ref name="Divided">{{cite web | last=Smith | first=Peter | authorlink= | coauthors= |date=2006-11-05 | month=November | url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061105/NEWS01/611050403/1008/NEWS01 | title=United Church of Christ Divided | format= | work= | pages= |publisher=courier-journal.com | language= | accessdate=2006-12-24 | curly=}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Starting in 2003, a task force commissioned by General Synod 24 studied the diverse worship habits of UCC churches.

"95 percent of our congregations use the [[Revised Common Lectionary]] in some way in planning or actual worship and preaching" and "96 percent always or almost always have a [[sermon]], 86 percent have a [[Children's message|time with children]], 95 percent have a time of sharing joys and concerns, and 98 percent include the [[Lord's Prayer|Prayer of Our Savior/Lord<U+2019>s Prayer]]." Clergy and laity were invited to select two meanings of baptism that they emphasize. They were also to suggest the meaning that they thought their entire church emphasized. Baptism as an <U+201C>entry into the Church Universal<U+201D> was the most frequent response. Clergy and laity were invited to identify two meanings of Holy Communion that they emphasize. While clergy emphasized Holy Communion as <U+201C>a meal in which we encounter God<U+2019>s living presence,<U+201D> laity emphasized <U+201C>a remembrance of Jesus<U+2019> last supper, death, and resurrection.<U+201D>

===Relationships with other religions===

==Structure==
Quoting the United Church of Christ Constitution, "The basic unit of the life and organization of the United Church of Christ is the [[local church]]." An interplay of wider interdependence with local [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] characterizes the organization of the UCC. Each "setting" of the United Church of Christ relates ''covenantally'' with other settings, their actions speaking "to but not for" each other.

The ''ethos'' of United Church of Christ organization is considered "[[Covenant theology|covenantal]]." The ''structure'' of UCC organization is a mixture of the [[Congregationalist church governance|congregational]] and [[Presbyterian church governance|presbyterian]] [[Ecclesiastical polity|polities]] of its predecessor denominations. With ultimate authority on most matters given to the local church, many see United Church of Christ polity as closer to congregationalism; however, with ordination and pastoral oversight conducted by Associations, and General Synod representation given to Conferences instead of congregational delegates, certain presbyterian similarities are also visible.

===Local churches===
[[Image:First Congregational United Church of Christ copyright Kaihsu Tai 20080203.jpg|thumb|right|[[First Congregational Church (Long Beach, California)|First Congregational Church]][http://FirstChurchLB.org] of [[Long Beach, California]], a local church of the United Church of Christ.]]
The basic unit of the United Church of Christ is the ''local church'' (also often called the ''congregation''). Local churches have the freedom to govern themselves, establishing their own internal organizational structures and theological positions. Thus, local church governance varies widely throughout the denomination. Some congregations, mainly of Congregational or Christian origin, have numerous relatively-independent "boards" that oversee different aspects of church life, with annual or more frequent meetings (often conducted after a worship service on a Sunday afternoon) of the entire congregation to elect officers, approve budgets and set congregational policy. Other churches, mainly of Evangelical and Reformed descent, have one central "church council" or "consistory" that handles most or all affairs in a manner somewhat akin to a [[Presbyterian]] [[Presbyterian polity#The Session|session]], while still holding an annual congregational meeting for the purpose of electing officers and/or ratifying annual budgets. Still others, probably those congregations started after the 1957 merger, have structures incorporating aspects of both, or other alternative organizational structures entirely.

In almost all cases, though, the selection of a minister for the congregation is, in keeping with the Reformed tradition of the "priesthood of all believers," vested in a congregational meeting, held usually after a special ''ad hoc'' committee searches on the congregation's behalf for a candidate. Members of the congregation vote for or against the committee's recommended candidate for the pastorate, usually immediately after the candidate has preached a "trial sermon;" candidates are usually presented one at a time and not as a field of several to be selected from. Typically the candidate must secure anywhere from 60 to 90 percent affirmative votes from the membership before the congregation issues a formal call to the candidate; this depends on the provisions in the congregation's particular constitution and/or by-laws. Local churches have, in addition to the freedom to hire ministers and lay staff, the sole power to dismiss them also. However, unlike purely congregational polities, the association has the main authority to [[Ordination|ordain]] clergy and grant standing to clergy coming to a church from another association or another denomination (this authority is exercised "in cooperation with" the person being ordained/called and the local church that is calling them). Such standing, among other things, permits a minister to participate in the UCC clergy pension and insurance plans. Local churches are usually aided in searching for and calling ordained clergy through a denominationally-coordinated "search-and-call" system, usually facilitated by staff at the conference level. However, the local church may, for various reasons, opt not to avail itself of the conference placement system, and is free to do so without fear of retaliation, which would likely occur in synodical or presbyterian polities. Participation in the process, though, is usually a sign of the congregation's loyalty to the larger denomination and its work.

At the end of 2008, 5,320 churches were reported to be within the UCC, averaging 210 members. Sixteen churches were reported to have over 2,000 members, but 64% had fewer than 200 members.<ref name="UCC-Research">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/research/|title=Research Services|publisher=ucc.org|accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref> The latter statistic probably indicates where most of the denomination's declining membership has occurred, in formerly mid-sized congregations between 200 and 500 members or so. The reduction in a typical church's size has also meant that, increasingly, many congregations are no longer able, as they once were, to afford a full-time, seminary-educated pastor, and that some of them have to rely on alternatives such as one of their members serving the church under a license, the use of recently retired clergy on a short-term basis, or ordained ministers serving the church on a half-time (or less) basis while earning their primary income from chaplaincies or other occupations. While this has been occurring to a lesser degree in other mainline denominations as well, the UCC's congregational polity allows for churches to adopt such approaches without ecclesiological restraint, as would happen in a more hierarchical denominational structure.

===Larger organizations===
====Associations====
{{See also|Associations of the United Church of Christ}}
Local churches are typically gathered together in regional bodies called ''Associations''. Local churches often give financial support to the association to support its activities. The official delegates of an association are all ordained clergy within the bounds of the association together with lay delegates sent from each local church. The association's main ecclesiastical function is to provide primary oversight and authorization of ordained and other authorized ministers; it also is the ecclesiastical link between the local congregation and the larger UCC. The association ordains new ministers, holds ministers' standing in covenant with local churches, and is responsible for disciplinary action; typically a specific ministerial committee handles these duties. Also, an association, again with the assistance of the ministerial committee, admits and removes local congregations from membership in the UCC.

Associations meet at least once annually to elect officers and board members and set budgets for the association's work; fellowship and informational workshops are often conducted during those meetings, which may take place more frequently according to local custom. In a few instances where there is only one association within a conference, or where the associations within a conference have agreed to dissolve, the Conference (below) assumes the association's functions.

====Conferences====
{{See also|Conferences of the United Church of Christ}}
Local churches also are members of larger ''[[Conferences of the United Church of Christ|Conferences]]'', of which there are 38 in the United Church of Christ. A conference typically contains multiple associations; if no associations exist within its boundaries, the conference exercises the functions of the association as well. Conferences are supported financially through local churches' contribution to "Our Church's Wider Mission" (formerly "Our Christian World Mission"), the United Church of Christ's denominational support system; unlike most associations, they usually have permanent headquarters and professional staff. The primary ecclesiastical function of a conference is to provide the primary support for the search-and-call process by which churches select ordained leadership; the conference minister and/or his or her associates perform this task in coordination with the congregation's pulpit search committee (see above) and the association to which the congregation belongs (particularly its ministerial committee). Conferences also provide significant programming resources for their constituent churches, such as Christian education resources and support, interpretation of the larger UCC's mission work, and church extension within their bounds (the latter usually conducted in conjunction with the national Local Church Ministries division).

Conferences, like associations, are congregationally representative bodies, with each local church sending ordained and lay delegates. Most current UCC conferences were formed in the several years following the consummation of the national merger in 1961, and in some instances were the unions of former Congregational Christian conferences (led by superintendents) and Evangelical and Reformed synods (led by presidents, some of whom served only on a part-time basis). A few have had territorial adjustments since then; only one conference, the Calvin Synod, composed of Hungarian-heritage Reformed congregations, received exemption from the geographical alignments, with its churches scattered from [[Connecticut]] westward to [[California]] and southward to [[Florida]]. Only one conference has ever withdrawn completely from the denomination: [[Puerto Rico]], expressing disapproval of national UCC tolerance of homosexuality (as well as that of a large number of mainland congregations), departed the denomination in 2006, taking all of its churches.

====General Synod====
{{See also|Resolutions of the United Church of Christ}}

The denomination's churchwide deliberative body is the ''[[General Synod]]'', which meets every two years. The General Synod consists of delegates elected from the Conferences (distributed proportionally by conference size) together with the boards of directors of each of the four covenanted ministries (see below, under National Offices).

While General Synod provides the most visible voice of the "stance of the denomination" on any particular issue, the covenantal polity of the denomination means that General Synod speaks ''to'' local churches, associations, and conferences, but not ''for'' them. Thus, the other settings of the church are allowed to hold differing views and practices on all non-constitutional matters.

General Synod considers three kinds of resolutions:
* '''Pronouncements''': A Pronouncement is a statement of Christian conviction on a matter of moral or social principle and has been adopted by a two-thirds vote of a General Synod.
* '''Proposals for Action''': A Proposal for Action is a recommendation for specific directional statements and goals implementing a Pronouncement. A Proposal for Action normally accompanies a Pronouncement. (See link above regarding Pronouncements.)
* '''Resolutions and Other Formal Motions''' Which may consist of the following three types:
** ''Resolutions of Witness'': A Resolution of Witness is an expression of the General Synod concerning a moral, ethical, or religious matter confronting the church, the nation, or the world, adopted for the guidance of the officers, Associated, or Affiliated Ministries, or other bodies as defined in Article VI of the Bylaws of the United Church of Christ; the consideration of local churches, Associations, Conferences, and other bodies related to the United Church of Christ; and for a Christian witness to the world. It represents agreement by at least two-thirds of the delegates voting that the view expressed is based on Christian conviction and is a part of their witness to Jesus Christ.
** ''Prudential Resolutions'': A Prudential Resolution establishes policy, institutes or revises structure or procedures, authorizes programs, approves directions, or requests actions by a majority vote.
** ''Other Formal Motions''

====National offices: covenanted, affiliated, and associated ministries====
As agents of the General Synod, the denomination maintains national offices comprising four "covenanted ministries", one "associated ministry", and one "affiliated ministry". The current system of national governance was adopted in 1999 as a restructure of the national setting, consolidating numerous agencies, boards, and "instrumentalities" that the UCC, in the main, had inherited from the Congregational Christian Churches at the time of merger, along with several created during the denomination's earlier years.

=====Covenanted ministries=====
These structures carry out the work of the General Synod and support the local churches, associations, and conferences. The head executives of these ministries comprise the five member ''Collegium of Officers'', which are the non-hierarchical official officers of the denomination. (The Office of General Ministries is represented by both the General Minister, who serves as President of the denomination, and the Associate General minister). According the UCC office of communication press release at the time of restructure, "In the new executive arrangement, the five will work together in a Collegium of Officers, meeting as peers. This setting is designed to provide an opportunity for mutual responsibility and reporting, as well as ongoing assessment of UCC programs." The main offices of the Covenanted ministries are at the "Church House", the United Church of Christ national headquarters at 700 Prospect Avenue in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].
* The '''Office of General Ministries (OGM)''' is responsible for administration, common services (technology, physical plant, etc.), covenantal relations (ecumenical relations, formal relations to other settings of the church), financial development, and "proclamation, identity and communication". The current General Minister and President is the [[Rev. Dr. Geoffrey Black]] and the current Associate General Minister is Mr. W. Mark Clark.
* '''Local Church Ministries (LCM)''' is responsible for evangelism, stewardship and church finance, worship and education, Pilgrim Press and United Church Resources (the publishing house of the United Church of Christ), and parish life and leadership (authorization, clergy development, seminary relations, parish leadership, etc.). The current Executive Minister of Local Church Ministries is the Rev. J. Bennett Guess.
* '''Wider Church Ministries (WCM)''' is responsible for partner relations* (relations with churches around the world, missionary work, etc.), local church relations* (as relates to world ministries and missions), global sharing of resources, health and wholeness ministry, and global education and advocacy*. The starred '*' ministries are carried out through the Common Global Ministries Board, a joint instrumentality of the United Church of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), based in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. The current Executive Minister for Wider Church Ministries is the Rev. Rev. Jim Moos.
* '''[[Justice and Witness Ministries]] (JWM)''' is responsible for ministries related to economic justice, human rights, justice for women and transformation, public life and social policy, and racial justice. In addition to its offices in Cleveland, JWM also maintains an office on [[Capitol Hill]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The current Executive Minister for Justice and Witness Ministries is Rev. M. Linda Jaramillo. JWM also maintains an office called "Minister for Children, Families and Human Sexuality Advocacy" that promotes the [[Our Whole Lives]] [[sex education]] curriculum.

=====Affiliated ministry=====
The '''Pension Boards of the United Church of Christ (PB-UCC)''' operates the employee benefits systems for all settings of the United Church of Christ, including health, dental, and optical insurance, retirement annuity/pension systems, disability and life insurance, and ministerial assistance programs. The Pension Boards offices are located in [[New York City]], where the headquarters of all UCC national bodies had been located prior to their move to Ohio in the early 1990s.

=====Associated ministry=====
'''United Church Funds (UCF)''', formerly known as '''The United Church Foundation''', provides low cost, socially responsible,  professionally managed Common Investment Funds (CIFs) and other trustee services to any setting of the United Church of Christ. United Church Funds' offices are also located in [[New York City]].

=====Other related ministry=====
'''The Insurance Board''' is a nonprofit corporation collectively "owned" by the [[Conferences of the United Church of Christ]]. It is run by a president/CEO and a 19-member Board, with the full corporate board consisting of participating Conference ministers. The IB administers a [[property insurance]], [[liability insurance]], and [[risk management]] program serving the United Church of Christ, the Presbyterian Church USA, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) churches and related entities.<ref>[http://www.insuranceboard.org/about_us/who_we_are.aspx United Church of Christ Insurance Board Who We Are<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Apology Resolution====
United Church of Christ was recognized in the [[s:Public Law 103-150|Apology Resolution]] to [[Native Hawaiians]]. In the [[Apology Resolution|Resolution]], Congress recognized the reconciliation made by the UCC in the [[Resolutions of the United Church of Christ#1971 - Eighth General Synod|Eighteenth General Synod]] for their actions in [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrowing the Kingdom of Hawaii]].

====Statement on the relationship between Israel and Palestinians====
{{Main|Resolutions of United Church of Christ General Synod XXV}}
{{See also|Resolutions of United Church of Christ }}
United Church of Christ General Synod XXV also passed two resolutions concerning the conflict between Israel and Palestinians in the Middle East. One calls for the use of economic leverage to promote peace in the Middle East, which can include measures such as government lobbying, selective ''investment'', shareholder lobbying, and selective ''[[divestment]]'' from companies which profit from the continuing Israel-Palestine conflict. The other resolution, named "Tear Down the Wall", calls upon Israel to remove the [[separation barrier]] between Israel and the West Bank. Opponents of the "Tear Down the Wall" resolution have noted that the wall's purpose is to prevent terrorist attacks, and that the resolution does not call for a stop to these attacks. The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] stated that the July 2005 UCC resolutions on divestment from Israel were "functionally [[anti-Semitic]]".<ref name="Wiesenthal">[http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nl/content.asp?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&b=312458&content_id={01D1316F-EAA5-42EC-91BB-81E250805BFC}&notoc=1 Simon WIESENTHAL Center].</ref> The [[Anti-Defamation League]] stated that those same resolutions are "disappointing and disturbing" and "deeply troubling".<ref name="ADL">[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/4749_62.htm Anti-Defamation League].</ref> In addition to the concerns raised about the merits of the "economic leverage" resolution, additional concerns were raised about the process in which the General Synod approved the resolution. Michael Downs of the [http://www.pbucc.org/ United Church of Christ Pension Boards] (who would be charged with implementing any divestment of the UCC's Pension Board investments) wrote a letter<ref name="Thomas">[http://www.ucctruths.com/JohnThomas1Synod.pdf].</ref> to UCC President [[John H. Thomas]] expressing concern "with the precedent-setting implications of voted actions, integrity of process and trust."

===Sex Education===
The United Church of Christ, along with the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations created several sexual education classes designed for many different age groups. Called [[Our Whole Lives]], or OWL, these courses aim to provide scientific and unbiased information regarding sexuality, birth control and condoms, and physical biology.

==="God Is Still Speaking," identity campaign===
At the 2003 General Synod, the United Church of Christ began a campaign with "emphasis on expanding the UCC's name-brand identity through modern advertising and marketing."<ref name="UCC-Billion">{{cite web | last=Winslow | first=William | authorlink= | coauthors= |date= | year=2003 | month=July<U+2013>August | url=http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/aug03/billion.htm | title=UCC leader asks for $1 billion in annual giving by 2007 | work= | pages= |publisher=ucc.org | language= | accessdate=2006-12-25 | curly= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061220025141/http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/aug03/billion.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-20}}</ref> that was formally launched Advent 2004. The campaign included coordinated program of evangelism and hospitality training for congregations paired with national and local television "brand" advertising, known as the "God is Still Speaking" campaign or "The Stillspeaking Initiative." The initiative was themed around the quotation "Never place a period where God has placed a comma," and campaign materials, including print and broadcast advertising as well as merchandise, featured the quote and a large "comma," with a visual theme in red and black. United Church of Christ congregations were asked to "opt in" to the campaign, signifying their support as well as their willingness to receive training on hospitality and evangelism. An evangelism event was held in Atlanta in August 2005 to promote the campaign.<ref name="UCC-Evangelism">{{cite web | last=Thomas | first=John | authorlink= | coauthors= |date= | year= | month= | url=http://www.ucc.org/evangelism/nee/index.html | title=National Evangelism Event | work= | pages= |publisher=ucc.org | language= | accessdate=2006-12-25 | curly= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061219214529/http://www.ucc.org/evangelism/nee/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-19}}</ref> Several [[renewal group]]s panned the ad campaign for its efforts to create an [[Open and affirming|ONA]]/progressive perception of the UCC identity despite its actual majority in [[centrist]]/[[moderate]] viewpoints.<ref name="Truths">[http://www.ucctruths.com/Archive/2004DecemberArchive.html December 2004 Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="Witness">[http://www.biblicalwitness.org/pdf/Witness%25202005%2520Winter.pdf Witness 2005 - Winter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> According to John Evans, associate professor of sociology at University of California, San Diego, "The UCC is clearly going after a certain niche in American society who are very progressive and have a particular religious vision that includes inclusiveness...

==Criticism==
The church's diversity and adherence to covenantal polity (rather than government by regional elders or bishops) give individual congregations a great deal of freedom in the areas of worship, congregational life, and doctrine. Nonetheless, some critics, mainly social and theological conservatives, are vocal about the UCC's theology, political identity, and cultural milieu.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=November 2010}}

Outcries have been so strong among conservative congregations that they have ended their affiliations with the denomination, in many cases terminating decades of association with one of the UCC's four major traditions. This became especially pronounced in the months following the decision of General Synod 25 to endorse same-sex marriage. Three denominations have in particular been beneficiaries of their decisions: the [[National Association of Congregational Christian Churches]] (founded in the late 1950s in opposition to the UCC merger), the [[Conservative Congregational Christian Conference]] (founded in the 1940s as a fundamentalist alternative), and the [[Evangelical Association of Reformed and Congregational Christian Churches]] (founded in the 1990s, mostly by E&R-heritage churches). However, quite a number of withdrawing congregations have decided to operate independently, influenced perhaps by the recent growth and success of non-denominational fellowships throughout the U.S. 

Still other congregations have decided to remain in the denomination but withhold financial support for "Our Church's Wider Mission" (OCWM). They say their goal is to avoid funding conference and national programs and policies they find objectionable. Many of those churches are openly affiliated with two conservative "renewal" organizations, the [[Biblical Witness Fellowship]] and the [[North Carolina]]-based Faithful and Welcoming group, both of which have tried, largely unsuccessfully, to lobby the General Synod (and some conferences) to renounce politically and theologically liberal stances on a number of issues.

However, some individuals and families have deserted those congregations remaining loyal to the UCC, in favor of more theologically and politically moderate mainline churches or conservative evangelical congregations. Even so, it has been reported at General Synod 2011 that 175 new churches have joined the UCC in the two previous years, which amounts to more than any similar time period in the last 40 years. The new churches represent new church starts as well as existing churches who were associated with other denominations or loosely associated with the UCC.

==Barack Obama and the UCC==
A controversy arose over Obama speaking at UCC gatherings, but the IRS found that the UCC had adhered to the prohibition against churches campaigning for political candidates.

In 2007, US Presidential candidate and longtime UCC member [[Barack Obama]] spoke at the UCC's Iowa Conference meeting and at the General Synod 26.<ref>[http://www.ucc.org/news/a-week-before-synod.html One week before Synod speech, Obama addresses UCC's Iowa Conference]</ref> A complaint filed with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] alleged that the UCC promoted Obama's candidacy by having him speak at those meetings.<ref>[http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11986 The American Spectator<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Barry W. Lynn|Barry Lynn]], an ordained UCC minister and the executive director of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], stated that although he personally would not have invited a Presidential candidate to speak at the meetings, he believed "the Internal Revenue Service permits this to happen."<ref>[http://www.onenewsnow.com/2007/06/barry_lynn_obamas_ucc_speech_n.php OneNewsNow.com - Your News Right Now<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The church had consulted lawyers prior to the event to make sure they were following the law and had instructed those in attendance that no Obama campaign material would be allowed in the meeting. Nevertheless, in February 2008, the IRS sent a letter to the church stating that it was launching an inquiry into the matter.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jlQQQuZKZmCSwpSPaZL-1qFIFX8QD8V2C8NO1 The Associated Press: IRS Investigates Obama's Denomination<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On February 27, 2008, in an open letter to UCC members, [[John H. Thomas|Rev. John H. Thomas]] announced the creation of The UCC Legal Fund, to aid in the denomination's defense against the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].<ref>[http://unitedchurchofchrist.blogspot.com/2008/02/support-uccs-legal-defense-against-irs.html The United Church of Christ: Support the UCC's legal defense against the IRS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> While the denomination expects legal expenses to surpass six figures, it halted donations after raising $59,564 in less than a week.

In May 2008, the IRS issued a letter which states that the UCC had taken appropriate steps and that the denomination's tax status was not in jeopardy.

==Membership==
At the time of its formation, the UCC had over 2 million members in nearly 7,000 churches.<ref name="Yearbook">{{cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1463.asp| title = Historic Archive CD and ''Yearbook of American & Canadian Churches''|publisher = The National Council of Churches|accessdate = 2009-12-18}}</ref> The denomination has suffered a 44 percent loss in membership since the mid-1960s.<ref>http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=3&DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=624&PID=0&IID=3147&TTL=Mainline_American_Christian_</ref> By 1980, membership was at about 1.7 million and by the turn of the century had dropped to 1.3 million.<ref name="Yearbook"/> In 2006, the UCC had roughly 1.2 million members in 5,452 churches.<ref name="Yearbook"/>  According to its 2008 annual report, the United Church of Christ has about 1.1 million members in about 5,300 local congregations.<ref name="UCC-2008">{{cite web | last= | first= | authorlink= | coauthors= |date= | year= | month= | url=http://www.ucc.org/about-us/2008-annual-report.html | title=2008 Annual Report | work= | pages= |publisher=ucc.org | language= | accessdate=2009-07-05 | curly=}}</ref> However the 2010 report confirms that there has been a decline of 31 thousand members and a loss of 33 congregations since then. It's possible that the church will record higher membership and affiliation rates in future as many congregations already affiliated to denominations, such as the Disciples of Christ, request dual membership. 

Membership is concentrated primarily in the Northeast and Midwest, the two regions of the U.S. where population has declined the strongest since the denomination's inception. Pennsylvania, a bastion of the German Reformed tradition, has the largest number of members and churches. As of 2000, the state had over 700 congregations and over 200,000 members.<ref name="2000 RCMS">{{cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/maps/map.asp?variable=437&state=101&variable2=| title = 2000 Religious Congregations and Membership Study|publisher = Glenmary Research Center|accessdate = 2009-12-18}}</ref> The highest membership rates are in the states of Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, situated in the heartland of the American Congregationalist movement.<ref name="2000 RCMS"/>
