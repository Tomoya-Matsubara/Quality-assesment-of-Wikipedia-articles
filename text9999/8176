Members of the '''Catholic Church''' have been active in the '''politics of the United States''' since the mid 19th century. The U.S. has never had an important religious party (unlike Europe and Latin America). There has never been a Catholic religious party, either local, state or national.

In 1776 Catholics comprised less than 1% of the population of the new nation, but  their presence grew rapidly after 1840 with immigration from Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland and elsewhere in Catholic Europe from 1840 to 1914, and also from Latin America in the 20th century.  Catholics now comprise 25% to 27% of the national vote, with over 68 million members today. 85% of today's Catholics report their faith to be "somewhat" to "very important" to them.<ref>[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/cathusa.htm CARA's New Book Identifies Trends in U.S. Catholic Church], Catholicism USA</ref><ref>[http://www.officialcatholicdirectory.com/ ''The Official Catholic Directory'' 2009].</ref>

From the mid-19th century down to 1964 Catholics were solidly Democratic, sometimes at the 80%-90% level. The Catholics formed a core part of the [[New Deal Coalition]], with overlapping memberships in the Church, labor unions, and big city machines, and the working class, all of which promoted [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal policy positions]] in domestic affairs and [[anti-communism]] during the [[Cold War]]. Since the election of a Catholic President in 1960, Catholics have split about 50-50 between the two major parties in national elections.

With the decline of unions and big city machines, and with upward mobility into the middle classes, Catholics have drifted away from liberalism and toward [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] on economic issues (such as taxes). Since the end of the [[Cold War]], their strong anti-Communism has faded in importance. On social issues the Catholic Church takes strong positions against [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] and has formed coalitions with Protestant evangelicals.<ref>Donald T. Critchlow, ''Intended Consequences: Birth Control, Abortion, and the Federal Government in Modern America'' (2001) p. 196</ref>

Currently there are 25 Catholics in the [[United States Senate]], 16 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 134 (out of 435) Catholics in the [[United States House of Representatives]], including the current House Speaker [[John Boehner]]. [[Joseph Biden]] is a Catholic, the first  ever elected Vice President.

Religious tensions were major issues in the presidential elections of [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]] when the Democrats nominated [[Al Smith]], a Catholic who was defeated, and in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]] when the Democrats nominated [[John F. Kennedy]], a Catholic who was elected. In 2004, with the nomination of [[John Kerry]] by the Democrats, who was at odds with the Church in the issues of abortion and same-sex marriage, his Catholic religion failed to attract significant votes, as slightly more Catholics voted for [[George W. Bush]] than for him.

==19th century==

[[Image:Charles Carroll of Carrollton - Michael Laty.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Carroll]]

Before 1840 Catholics constituted a small minority and therefore played a relatively minor role in early [[American history]].{{r|silk20081103}} Only in Maryland were there significant numbers, and Baltimore became an early Catholic center. During the [[American Revolution]] until the late 18th century, only about 1% of the American population (about 30,000) was Catholic. Still, Catholics were among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] and part of the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]]; [[Daniel Carroll]] serving [[Maryland]]'s [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th congressional district]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000187 | title=CARROLL, Daniel, (1730 - 1796) | publisher=United States Congress | work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | accessdate=2008-10-03}}</ref> and [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] serving as the first senator from Maryland.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000185 | title=CARROLL, Charles (of Carrollton), (1737 - 1832) | publisher=United States Congress | work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | accessdate=2008-10-03}}</ref> Presidential candidates did not seek Catholic votes until [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Henry Clay]] did so in [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832]].{{r|silk20081103}}

===Wave of European immigration===
The role of Catholics in American culture and politics changed dramatically as a result of the mass immigration of Catholics from Europe, especially [[Germany]] and [[Ireland]]. By 1840, there were about 600,000 Catholics in the United States. In the 1840s, 200,000 Irish immigrated to escape poverty.  The [[Irish Potato Famine]] in 1845 caused the Irish population in America to reach 962,000, the number doubling in the next ten years.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/history/americanhistory/immigrants-and-immigration-aaw-02/ Immigrants and Immigration], Americans at War, Macmillan Reference USA</ref> Even larger numbers of immigrants arrived from traditionally Catholic regions of Germany and other parts of Europe. To the extent that these new arrivals remained inside ethnic communities, they typically joined the local Catholic parish and were loyal to Rome; how many cut their ties with the Catholic Church is a matter of speculation.<ref>Roger Finke and Rodney Stark, ''The Churching of America, 1776-1990: Winners and Losers in Our Religious Economy<U+200E>'' (1993) p. 273. Apart from the formation in 1897 of a [[Polish National Catholic Church]], there were no alternative Catholic denominations formed for immigrants. By contrast the Lutherans formed numerous denominations in the U.S.</ref> The Irish Catholics took controlling positions in the Catholic Church, labor unions, and Democratic organizations in the big cities, thus forming overlapping centers of strength. The sudden new arrival of so many Catholics, charges of political corruption, and fears of papal interference caused [[anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholicism]] to grow, including the short-lived [[Know Nothings]] party in the 1850s which demanded a purification of politics from Catholic influence.{{r|silk20081103}}

Many Catholics served in the Civil War armies, both North and South, and the bishops rejected the antiwar and anti-draft sentiments of some members. The rapid rise of the Irish out of poverty, and the continued growth in membership, especially in industrial and urban areas, made the church the largest denomination in the U.S. Distrusting public schools dominated by Protestants, Catholics built their own network of parochial elementary schools (and, later, high schools), as well as colleges, and public funding for parochial schools was a controversial issue.{{r|silk20081103}} As the [[Bennett Law]] episode in 1890 in Wisconsin demonstrated, Catholics were willing to cooperate politically with Protestants to protect their parochial schools. A distinct Catholic vote existed, however; in the late 19th century, 75% of Irish, German, and French Catholics in America voted for Democratic presidential candidates.{{r|silk20081103}}

===Labor union movement===
{{See|Knights of Labor}}

The Catholic Church exercised a prominent role in shaping America's labor movement.  From the onset of significant immigration in the 1840s, the Church in the United States was predominantly urban, with both its leaders and congregants usually of the laboring classes. Over the course of the second half of the nineteenth century, nativism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-unionism coalesced in Republican politics, and Catholics gravitated toward unions and the Democratic Party.{{r|silk20081103}}

The [[Knights of Labor]] was the earliest labor organization in the United States, and in the 1880s, the was the largest labor union in the United States.  and it is estimated that at least half its membership was Catholic (including [[Terence Powderly]], its president from 1881 onward).

In [[Rerum Novarum]] (1891), [[Pope Leo XIII]] criticized the concentration of wealth and power, spoke out against the abuses that workers faced and demanded that workers should be granted certain rights and safety regulations.  He upheld the right of voluntary association, specifically commending labor unions. At the same time, he reiterated the Church<U+2019>s defense of private property, condemned socialism, and emphasized the need for Catholics to form and join unions that were not compromised by secular and revolutionary ideologies.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html Rerum Novarum]</ref>

Rerum Novarum provided new impetus for Catholics to become active in the labor movement, even if its exhortation to form specifically Catholic labor unions was widely interpreted as irrelevant to the pluralist context of the United States. While atheism underpinned many European unions and stimulated Catholic unionists to form separate labor federations, the religious neutrality of unions in the U.S. provided no such impetus. American Catholics seldom dominated unions, but they exerted influence across organized labor. Catholic union members and leaders played important roles in steering American unions away from socialism.

==20th century==

By 1900, Catholics represented 14 percent of the total U.S. population, soon became the single largest religious denomination in the country.<ref>Terry Matthews: [http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html Catholicism in Nineteenth Century America], Lectures for Religion, Wake Forrest University</ref>  Still, Catholics did not hold many high offices in politics. Of the first 54 justices on the [[United States Supreme Court]], only one was Catholic, [[Roger B. Taney]], appointed in 1836.

===Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction===
{{Main|Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction}}

Following [[World War I]], many hoped that a new commitment to social reform would characterize the ensuing peace. The Council saw an opportunity to use its national voice to shape reform and in April 1918 created a Committee for Reconstruction.  [[John A. Ryan]] wrote the Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction. Combining Progressive thought and Catholic theology, Ryan believed that government intervention was the most effective means of affecting positive change for his church as well as working people and the poor.

On February 12, 1919, the National Catholic War Council issued the "Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction," through a carefully planned public relations campaign.

The Program received a mixed reception both within the Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a voluntary organization with no canonical status. Its ability to speak authoritatively was thus questioned. Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, but some, like Bishop William Turner of Buffalo, and more notably, William Henry O'Connell of Boston, opposed it. O'Connell believed some aspects of the plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backing it, for example, and business groups criticizing it.

===Compulsory Education Act===
{{Main|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}

After World War I, some states concerned about the influence of immigrants and "foreign" values looked to public schools for help. The states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture.

In 1921, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] arrived in [[Oregon]] from central [[California]] and quickly attracted as many as 14,000 members, establishing 58 klaverns by the end of 1922.  Given the small population of non-white minorities outside Portland, the Oregon Klan directed its attention almost exclusively against Catholics, who numbered about 8% of the population.

In 1922, the [[Freemasons|Masonic]] Grand Lodge of Oregon sponsored a bill to require all school-age children to attend public schools.  With support of the Klan and Democratic Governor [[Walter M. Pierce]], endorsed by the Klan, the Compulsory Education Act was passed by a vote of 115,506 to 103,685.  Its primary purpose was to shut down Catholic schools in Oregon, but it also affected other private and military schools. The constitutionality of the law was challenged in court and ultimately struck down by the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) before it went into effect.<ref>Howard, J. Paul. [http://www.shibleyrighton.com/pdf/Howard/CEAArticleApril2001.pdf "Cross-Border Reflections, Parents<U+2019> Right to Direct Their Childrens<U+2019> Education Under the U.S. and Canadian Constitutions"], ''Education Canada'', v41 n2 p36-37 Sum 2001.</ref>

The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools.  In [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]] (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that that has been called "the Magna Carta of the parochial school system."

[[Pope Pius XI]], in 1929, explicitly referenced this Supreme Court case in his [[encyclical]] ''Divini illius magistri''<ref>{{cite web|title=Divini illius magistri|author=[[Pope Pius XI]]|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html|date=1929-12-31|accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref> on [[Catholic school|Catholic education]]. He quoted in a footnote the part of the case that says:<blockquote>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right coupled with the high duty, to recognize, and prepare him for additional duties.</blockquote>

===1928 Presidential election===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1928}}

[[Image:AlSmithWaves.jpg|thumb|right|Al Smith]]

In 1928, [[Al Smith]] became the first Roman Catholic to gain a major party's nomination for President.<ref>Hostetler, (1998).</ref>  His religion became an issue during the [[United States presidential election, 1928|campaign]] and was one of the factors in his loss.  Many feared that he would answer to the pope and not the constitution.
Another major controversial issue was the continuation of [[Prohibition]]. Smith was personally in favor of relaxation or repeal of Prohibition laws despite its status as part of the nation's Constitution, but the Democratic Party split north and south on the issue. During the campaign Smith tried to duck the issue with noncommittal statements.  He was also criticized for being a drunkard because of the stereotypes placed on Irish Catholics of the day.<ref>DeGregorio, (1984).</ref><ref>Lichtman (1979)</ref>

Smith swept the entire Catholic vote, which had been split in 1920 and 1924, and brought millions of Catholics to the polls for the first time, especially women.  The fact that Smith was Catholic garnered him support from [[immigrant]] populations in New England, which may explain his narrow victories in traditionally Republican [[Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]], as well as his narrow 2% loss in [[New York]] (which previous Democratic presidential candidates had lost by double digits).<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Haskell House Publishers |isbn = 9780838314272 | last = Rice | first = Arnold S.  | title = The Ku Klux Klan in American Politics | date = 1972}}</ref>

===Catholic Worker Movement===
{{Main|Catholic Worker Movement}}
[[Image:Dorothy Day 1934.jpg|thumb|right|Dorothy Day]]

The Catholic Worker movement began as a means to combine Dorothy Day's history in American social activism, [[anarchism]], and [[pacifism]] with the tenets of Catholicism (including a strong current of [[distributism]]), five years after her 1927 conversion.<ref>"[http://www.cjd.org/paper/pacifism.html "Dorothy Day, Prophet of Pacifism for the Catholic Church"]" from "Houston Catholic Worker" newspaper, October 1997</ref>
The group started with the ''[[Catholic Worker]]'' [[newspaper]], created to promote [[Catholic social teaching]] and stake out a neutral, [[pacifism|pacifist]] position in the war-torn 1930s. This grew into a "[[house of hospitality]]" in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the [[United States]], and to [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; more than 30 independent but affiliated CW communities had been founded by 1941. Well over 100 communities exist today, including several in [[Australia]], the United Kingdom, Canada, [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web |title=List of Catholic Worker Communities |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm  |accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref>

====National Catholic Welfare Conference====
:''See: [[National Catholic Welfare Council#National Catholic Welfare Conference]]''

{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

===1930s===
Historian John McGreevey notes: "Priests across the country in the 1930s encouraged their parishioners to join unions, and some like Pittsbugh's [[Charles Owen Rice|Charles Rice]], Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo's]] Monsignor [[John P. Boland (labor priest)|John P.Boland]], served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations."  The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and [[Dorothy Day]] grew out of the same impetuses to put [[Catholic social teaching]] into action.

===Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems===
{{Main|Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems}}

The [[Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems]] (1923<U+2013>1937) was conceived by Fr. Raymond McGowan as a way of bringing together Catholic leaders in the fields of theology, labor, and business, with a view to promoting awareness and discussion of Catholic social teaching. Its first meeting was held in Milwaukee. While it was the venue for important discussions during its existence, its demise was due in part to lack of participation by business executives who perceived the dominant tone of the group as anti-business.

=== 1960s===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1960}}
[[Image:John F. Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States]]

Religion became a divisive issue during the [[United States presidential election, 1960|presidential campaign of 1960]]. Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] of Massachusetts was vying to become the nation's first Catholic president.  A key factor that was hurting  Kennedy in his campaign was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some [[Protestants]] believed that, if he were elected President, Kennedy would have to take orders from the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]].  When offered the opportunity to speak before a convention of Baptist ministers, decided to try to put the issue to rest.

To address fears that his Roman Catholicism would impact his decision-making, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, "I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters <U+2014> and the Church does not speak for me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|title=Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|accessdate=2007-09-17|last=Kennedy|first=John F.|date=2002-06-18|work=American Rhetoric}}</ref> He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him.  Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Roman Catholic.

Even so, it was widely believed after the election that Kennedy lost some heavily Protestant states because of his Catholicism.  His address did not please everyone: many non-Catholics remained unconvinced that a Catholic could be president without divided loyalties; and many Catholics thought he conceded too much in his profession of belief in an "absolute" [[separation of church and state]]. The speech is widely considered to be an important marker in the history of Catholicism (and anti-Catholicism) in the United States.

Kennedy went on to win the national popular vote over [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) - the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the [[electoral college]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).  There was a <U+201C>narrow consensus<U+201D> among the experts that Kennedy had won more votes than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,<ref>New York Times, November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5</ref> as Catholics rallied to Kennedy as an affirmation of their religion and their right to have a Catholic president.

===The present===
Since Kennedy, the Catholic vote&mdash;now about a quarter of the total&mdash;has come to reflect the nation as a whole instead of being predominantly Democratic.{{r|silk20081103}} [[Ronald Reagan]] won about half of the Catholic vote in his successful [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] campaign against [[Jimmy Carter]], greatly improving on Nixon's about one third of Catholics in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]]. "[[Reagan Democrats]]", many of them blue-collar Catholics, comprised 25% of the Democrats who voted for Reagan, and formed an important part of his support in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]] as well. Despite Catholic [[Geraldine Ferraro]]'s presence on the Democratic ticket as [[Walter Mondale]]'s vice-presidential running mate that year Reagan won 54 to 61% of the Catholic vote, only slightly different from the overall 59%. Although the majority of Catholics in 1984 remained Democrats, compared to 1980 Catholic votes switched to Reagan at about the same level as most Protestant groups. Reagan's vice president [[George H. W. Bush]] won about the same number of votes as [[Michael Dukakis]], making [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]] the third presidential election in a row in which Catholics failed to support the Democratic candidate as they traditionally did.{{r|prendergast1999}}{{rp|186-187,191-192,194}}

Although only about one third of Catholics voted for Bush's reelection in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]], most Catholic defectors switched to independent [[Ross Perot]], not the successful Democrat [[Bill Clinton]]. Unlike previous elections (such as in [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]], when [[George McGovern]]'s Catholic support was eight percentage points higher than overall) the Catholic vote was not more Democratic than the overall electorate, but split almost identically to it. The trend away from a Democratic dominance of the Catholic vote continued in [[United States elections, 1994|1994]], when for the first time in history Democrats did not receive a majority of Catholic votes in elections for the House of Representatives; as with 1992, the Catholic vote split resembled that of the overall electorate. This trend reversed slightly in [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]], when Clinton's share of Catholics was four percentage points ahead of overall, and they comprised about half of the margin between him and the unsuccessful challenger [[Robert Dole]]. The 1990s ended, however, with Catholics as "the largest swing vote in American politics."<ref name="prendergast1999">{{cite book | title=The Catholic vote in American politics | author=Prendergast, William B. | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B9nFwo5B1BQC | publisher=Georgetown University Press | location=Washington DC | isbn=0878407243}}</ref>{{rp|200-201,207,218}}

Their party independence continued into 2000, and Catholics became the large religious grouping that most closely reflected the total electorate, ahead of [[mainline Protestant]]s. 50% of Catholics voted for [[Al Gore]] versus 47% for [[George W. Bush]] in the very close [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] election. 52% of Catholics voted for Bush's successful reelection compared to 47% for the Catholic [[John Kerry]] in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], versus 51% to 48% overall.<ref name="silk20081103">{{cite news | url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=11181 | title=A Past Without a Future? | accessdate=March 26, 2011 | author=Silk, Mark; Walsh, Andrew | date=2008-11-03 | publisher=America}}</ref> [[Barack Obama]], who chose the Catholic [[Joe Biden]] as his running mate, received 54% of the Catholic vote in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] compared to [[John McCain]]'s 45%, again close to the overall 52%/46%.<ref name="csh20081106">{{cite news | url=http://www.catholicstarherald.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2687:voters-split-on-obama-mccain-by-religion-religious-practice&catid=102:latest-news&directory=300010 | title=Voters split on Obama, McCain by religion, religious practice | accessdate=March 26, 2011 | date=2008-11-06 | publisher=Catholic Star-Herald, the Diocese of Camden}}</ref>

==Representation in government==
===Congress===
Today, Catholics represent 30% of [[Demographics of the United States Congress|Congress]].

===Supreme Court===

{{As of|2009}}, the Supreme Court has a Catholic majority.  Catholics represent two-thirds of the Justices on the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].<ref>[http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/10/04/a-catholic-court-let-the-arguments-begin/ A Catholic Court? Let the Arguments Begin], Politics Daily</ref>  In the early 1980s, there was only one Catholic justice.  This changed in the mid 1980s when President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Anthony Kennedy]] to the court, both Catholic. The first President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] nominated [[Clarence Thomas]] (a Catholic who at the time of his appointment was attending Episcopalian services, though he has since become an active Catholic) along with [[David Souter]], an Episcopalian. The second President [[George W. Bush]] appointed [[John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]], both Catholics. President [[Barack Obama]] appointed Catholic [[Sonia Sotomayor]].

The four Catholic Supreme Court justices nominated in the last decade have become reliable votes for abortion restriction. In[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]] (1989), [[City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health]] (1990), [[Hodgson v. Minnesota]] (1990), and [[Rust v. Sullivan]] (1991), Scalia and Kennedy upheld the restrictions in question .  Only one Catholic judge has ever ruled against abortion restrictions, and that was in one of six cases. This appears to establish a reliable voting pattern in the Supreme Court on abortion issues.<ref>{{cite web |first=William |last=Saletan |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2129120/ |title=The political advantages of Catholic justices |publisher=slate.com |date=November 1, 2005}}</ref>

==Present day==
Religion plays a part in American politics.  The emergence of gay rights, abortion rights, and current immigration issues have had an impact on voting patterns. Both gay rights, abortion rights, and even the [[Terri Schiavo case|<U+201C>right to die<U+201D>]] have not only tested the values of the Catholic Church, but have united [[evangelicals]] and Catholics. 

According to Dr. John Green of University of Akron, "There isn't a Catholic vote anymore; there are several Catholic votes." A survey conducted by the Gallup organization in 2009 revealed that, despite the opposition of the Church to abortion and embryonic stem-cell research, there is no significant difference between the opinions of Catholics and non-Catholics on these questions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117154/catholics-similar-mainstream-abortion-stem-cells.aspx |title=Catholics Similar to Mainstream on Abortion, Stem Cells |date=2009-03-30 |accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref>

In 2004, [[Catholic Answers]], a private Catholic group with no official connection to the [[USCCB]], published its ''Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics''.<ref>[http://www.caaction.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=54&Itemid=95 Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics]</ref>  It also published ''Voter's Guide for Serious Christians'' for non-Catholics.<ref>[http://www.caaction.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=55&Itemid=95 Voter's Guide for Serious Christians]</ref>  In 2006, it revamped the guides and published them on its Catholic Answers Action web site.<ref>{{cite web|author=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=20967 |title=Some issues morally <U+2018>non-negotiable,<U+2019> says <U+2019>06 Catholic voter<U+2019>s guide - U.s. - Catholic Online |publisher=Catholic.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref>

===Homosexual activity===
The Roman Catholic Church defines [[marriage]] as a [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] "by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life and which is ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring."<ref>{{cite web|title=CIC|work=1055 <U+00A7>1|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3V.HTM}}</ref> The church teaches that "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved."<ref name="ccc_homosexuality">{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=2357<U+2013>2359|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#-2E5|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House}}</ref> Nevertheless, homosexuals "must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided."<ref name="ccc_homosexuality"/> Some Roman Catholics take this to mean that voting in favor of "benefits for lifelong partners" is a compassionate act, whereas others see voting in favor of "benefits for lifelong partners" as merely promoting behavior contrary to natural law. According to a 2009 survey, 59% of practicing Catholics oppose same-sex marriage, while those who are not practicing support it by 51%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Majority Continues To Support Civil Unions|work=The Pew Forum on Religious and Public Life|url=http://pewforum.org/Gay-Marriage-and-Homosexuality/Majority-Continues-To-Support-Civil-Unions.aspx}}</ref> Cardinal [[John Joseph O'Connor]] was an outspoken critic of homosexuality; other prominent Catholics who were outspoken critics have included [[David Vitter]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Rick Santorum]], [[Bobby Jindal]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Bob McDonnell]], [[Mel Martinez]], [[Michael Steele]], [[Donald Carcieri]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Sam Brownback]], and Democrat [[Bill Richardson]]. Catholics [[Rudolph Giuliani]], [[Chris Christie]], and [[Bob Casey, Jr.]] have supported gay rights and civil unions but not same-sex marriage.

=== Abortion ===
In accordance with its teachings, the Catholic Church opposes abortion in all circumstances and often leads the national debate on abortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/prolife/issues/abortion/teaching.shtml |title=Pro-Life Activities - The Catholic Church is a Pro-Life Church |publisher=USCCB |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> The Roman Catholic Church has been a fierce opponent of liberalized abortion laws and has organized political resistance to such legislation in several Western countries.

Before the [[Roe v. Wade]] decision making abortion legal in the United States, the pro-life movement in the United States consisted of elite lawyers, politicians, and doctors, almost all of whom were Catholic.<ref name=munson>[http://books.google.com/books?id=UFaCtYtIAjgC&pg=PA85&dq=history+catholic+church+pro-life&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=&f=false The making of pro-life activists: how social movement mobilization works]  By Ziad W. Munson</ref> The only coordinated opposition to abortion during the early 1970s came from the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] and the [[Family Life Bureau]], also a Catholic organization. Mobilization of a wide-scale pro-life movement among Catholics began quickly after the Roe v. Wade decision with the creation of the [[National Right to Life Committee]] (NRLC). The NRLC also organized non-Catholics, eventually becoming the largest pro-life organization in the United States.<ref name=munson/> the pro-life wing of the Democratic Party was also led by Catholic [[Robert P. Casey|Robert P. Casey, Sr.]] other pro-life Democrats including, [[Sargent Shriver]], [[Raymond Flynn]] and [[Bob Casey, Jr.]]

Some Catholics have raised questions of pro-choice politicians receiving communion.  	
In 2004, [[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]], then-prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], instructed American bishops in a confidential memorandum that Communion must be denied to Catholic politicians who support legal abortion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/7/6/152916.shtml |title=Cardinal Ratzinger Orders Kerry Communion Ban |date=2004-07-06 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref> However, Cardinals O'Malley, Egan, McCarrick, Wuerl, Mahoney and George have said they would not refuse communion to a person in public life who is pro-choice.  [[Cardinal Burke]] and [[Charles Chaput]], Arcbishop of Philadelphia, have made statements against giving communion but neither has ever refused someone. Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have given communion to pro-choice politicians.<ref>http://uspolitics.about.com/od/abortion/a/08052004.htm</ref>

During the 2004 presidential campaign, a few bishops called for Catholic politicians who voted for Kerry to be barred from receiving Communion.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/20/politics/20bishop.html |title=Democrats Criticize Denial of Communion by Bishops |date=2004-05-20 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |work=The New York Times |first=Laurie |last=Goodstein}}</ref> This tactic provoked a negative reaction which caused the Catholic Church to adopt a different approach for the 2008 election. The new message was compiled into a brochure titled "Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship," which "emphasized that issues involving 'intrinsically evil' actions could not be equated morally with others," according to the Times. The brochure cited abortion as the "prime example," but also mentioned euthanasia, torture, genocide, unjust war and racism.

In the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, as many as 89 Catholic bishops proclaimed that Catholics should make abortion their defining issue in the election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/18548449.html |title=89 Catholic Bishops Speak Out: In This Election, Abortion is the Defining Issue |publisher=ChristianNewsWire}}</ref>

In November 2009, Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy disclosed that Bishop Thomas Tobin had instructed him not to take communion because of Kennedy's position in favor of unrestricted abortion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/11/22/patrick-kennedy-denied-holy-communion-by-catholic-church/ |title=Patrick Kennedy Denied Holy Communion by Catholic Church |date=2009-11-22 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>  Other bishops, archbishops and cardinals however have not denied communion to pro-choice politicians.  

Some Catholic commentators viewed the 54-45% majority of Catholic voters choosing Obama in the 2008 presidential election as a repudiation of certain bishops who had warned that voting for Obama, a pro-choice candidate, could constitute a grave sin.<ref name=CatholicVote>{{cite journal |journal=National Catholic Reporter |url=http://ncronline.org/node/2430 |title=The Catholic Vote: Complex, significant but no realignment |first=Michael |last=Humphrey |date=2008-11-07|accessdate=2009-04-24}}</ref> A dispute within the Church arose when the [[University of Notre Dame]], a Catholic institution, named President Barack Obama commencement speaker at its 2009 graduation and bestowed  an honorary doctorate degree on him. The invitation drew intense criticism from conservative Catholics and some conservative members of the church hierarchy because of Obama's policies in favor of legal and funding abortion. 

Polling shows an increase in the number of Catholics classifying themselves as pro-life; a 2009 poll showed a 52% majority identifying as pro-life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/118399/More-Americans-Pro-Life-Than-Pro-Choice-First-Time.aspx |title=More Americans <U+201C>Pro-Life<U+201D> Than <U+201C>Pro-Choice<U+201D> for First Time |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref>

=== Immigration ===
The [[immigration]] debate has also changed relations between Republicans and Roman Catholic voters.  Roughly 30% of the Roman Catholic population is [[Hispanic]] and that percentage continues to rise steadily. [[Pope John Paul II]] advocated that countries should accommodate people fleeing from economic hardship if they are able.

The Roman Catholic leadership in the U.S. has opposed restrictions on immigration. For example, [[Raymond Leo Burke|Cardinal Raymond Burke]] has been involved in rallies to allow undocumented workers a chance at citizenship.  By welcoming migrant workers, many of whom are Catholic, Burke says, "we obey the command of Our Lord, who tells us that when we welcome the stranger, we welcome [[Christ]] Himself." {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Most immigration to the U.S. is from predominately Roman Catholic nations and about <U+00BE> of all [[Lapsed Catholic|lapsed Catholics]] have been replaced by immigrant Catholics in the United States.<ref name="Pew Forum">{{cite web|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|author=[[Pew Forum]]|date=February 2008|title=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey: Religious Affiliation: Diverse and Dynamic|quote=<U+201C>Catholicism has experienced the greatest net losses as a result of affiliation changes. While nearly one-in-three Americans (31%) were raised in the Catholic faith, today fewer than one-in-four (24%) describe themselves as Catholic. These losses would have been even more pronounced were it not for the offsetting impact of immigration. The Landscape Survey finds that among the foreign-born adult population, Catholics outnumber Protestants by nearly a two-to-one margin (46% Catholic vs. 24% Protestant); among native-born Americans, on the other hand, Protestants outnumber Catholics by an even larger margin (55% Protestant vs. 21% Catholic).<U+201D> (p. 6).<br><br><U+201C>...the Catholic share of the U.S. adult population has held fairly steady in recent decades, at around 25%. What this apparent stability obscures, however, is the large number of people who have left the Catholic Church. Approximately one-third of the survey respondents who say they were raised Catholic no longer describe themselves as Catholic. This means that roughly 10% of all Americans are former Catholics. These losses, however, have been partly offset by the number of people who have changed their affiliation to Catholicism (2.6% of the adult population) but more importantly by the disproportionately high number of Catholics among immigrants to the U.S.<U+201D> (p. 7).}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony|Cardinal Roger Mahony]] controversially announced that he would order the clergy and laity of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archdiocese of Los Angeles]] to ignore [[H.R. 4437]] if it were to become law.<ref name="kerwin">{{cite news | url=http://www.catholic.org/views/views_news.php?id=19737&pid=0 | title=Immigration reform: what the Catholic Church knows | author=Donald Kerwin | date=2006-05-08 | accessdate=2007-05-11 | publisher=Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070421181750/http://www.catholic.org/views/views_news.php?id=19737&pid=0 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-21}}</ref> Cardinal Mahony personally lobbied senators [[Barbara Boxer]] and [[Dianne Feinstein]] to have the Senate consider a comprehensive immigration reform bill, rather than the enforcement-only bill that passed the House of Representatives.<ref name="NCR">{{cite news | url=http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006b/041406/041406h.php | title=Mahony on immigration | author=John L.

On the other hand, the Roman Catholic laity may be out of step with the "high" priestly leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. on this issue.  Many prominent opponents of mass immigration to the U.S., such as, most notably, [[Pat Buchanan]], are Roman Catholics who base their "conservatism" in their faith.  Since, for one, immigration is a sensitive issue for many, it is difficult to gauge the effects of conservative Roman Catholic thinkers on the immigration debate.  The mainstays of the so-called "paleoconservative" and related immigration-reform movements are largely Roman Catholic:  Pat Buchanan, [[Thomas Fleming (political writer)|Thomas Fleming]], [[Russell Kirk]], [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William Buckley]], etc.
