[[Image:Swim bladder.jpg|thumb|333px|The swim bladder of a [[Rudd]]]]The '''swim bladder''', '''gas bladder''', '''fish maw''' or '''air bladder''' is an internal gas-filled [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] that contributes to the ability of a [[fish]] to control its [[buoyancy]], and thus to stay at the current water depth without having to waste energy in swimming.<ref name="Orr">{{cite encyclopedia | title =Fish | encyclopedia =Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 1999  | publisher =Microsoft | date =1999}}</ref>  The swim bladder is also of use as a stabilizing agent because in the upright position the center of mass is below the center of volume due to the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] position of the swim bladder. Another function of the swim bladder is the use as a [[resonator|resonating chamber]] to produce or receive sound.

The swim bladder is evolutionarily [[Homology_(biology)|homologous]] to the [[lungs]], and [[Charles Darwin]] himself remarked upon this in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>"The illustration of the swim bladder in fishes is a good one, because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose, namely, flotation, may be converted into one for a widely different purpose, namely, respiration. The swim bladder has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fishes. All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous, or <U+201C>ideally similar<U+201D> in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to doubt that the swim bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or an organ used exclusively for respiration.  According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient and unknown prototype, which was furnished with a floating apparatus or swim bladder."  Darwin, Origin of Species.</ref>

==Species==
Swim bladders are only found in [[ray-finned fish]]. In the embryonic stages some species have lost the swim bladder again, mostly bottom dwellers like the [[weather fish]]. Other fishes like the [[Opah]] and the [[Pomfret]] use their pectoral fins to swim and balance the weight of the head to keep a horizontal position. The normally bottom dwelling [[sea robin]] can use their pectoral fins to produce lift while swimming. The [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] (e.g. sharks and rays) and [[lobe-finned fish]] do not have swim bladders. They can control their depth only by swimming (using [[dynamic lift (fish)|dynamic lift]]); others store fats or oils for the purpose.

==Structure and function==

The swim bladder normally consists of two gas-filled sacs located in the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] portion of the fish, although in a few primitive species, there is only a single sac. It has flexible walls that contract or expand according to the ambient [[pressure]].  The walls of the bladder contain very few [[blood vessels]] and are lined with [[guanine]] crystals, which make them impermeable to gases. By adjusting the gas pressure using the gas gland or oval window the fish can obtain neutral buoyancy and ascend and descend to a large range of depths. Due to the dorsal position it gives the fish lateral stability.

In [[physostome|physostomous]] swim bladders, a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], the '''pneumatic duct''', allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by "gulping" air and filling the swim bladder. Excess gas can be removed in a similar manner.

In more derived varieties of fish, the [[physoclisti]] connection to the gastric duct is lost. In early life stages, fish have to rise to the surface to fill up their swim bladders, however, in later stages the connection disappears and the [[gas gland]] has to introduce gas (usually [[oxygen]]) to the bladder to increase its [[volume]] and thus increase [[buoyancy]]. In order to introduce gas into the bladder, the gas gland excretes [[lactic acid]] and produces [[carbon dioxide]]. The resulting acidity causes the [[hemoglobin]] of the blood to lose its oxygen ([[hemoglobin|Root effect]]) which then [[diffusion|diffuses]] partly into the swim bladder. The blood flowing back to the body first enters a [[rete mirabile]] where virtually all the excess carbon dioxide and oxygen produced in the gas gland diffuses back to the arteries supplying the gas gland. Thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained, which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the [[eel]], requiring a pressure of hundreds of [[bar (unit)|bars]]<ref>http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/16/6/287</ref>. Elsewhere, at a similar structure known as the ''oval window'', the bladder is in contact with blood and the oxygen can diffuse back. Together with oxygen other gases are salted out in the swim bladder which accounts for the high pressures of other gases as well<ref name="biolbull.org">http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/3/440</ref>.

The combination of gases in the bladder varies. In shallow water fish, the ratios closely approximate that of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], while deep sea fish tend to have higher percentages of oxygen. For instance, the [[eel]] ''[[Synaphobranchus]]'' has been observed to have 75.1% oxygen, 20.5% [[nitrogen]], 3.1% [[carbon dioxide]], and 0.4% [[argon]] in its swim bladder.

Physoclist swim bladders have one important disadvantage: they prohibit fast rising, as the bladder would burst. Physostomes can "burp" out gas, though this complicates the process of re-submergence.

In some fish, mainly freshwater species (e.g. [[common carp]], [[wels catfish]]), the swim bladder is connected to the [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|labyrinth]] of the inner [[ear]] by the [[Weberian apparatus]], a bony structure derived from the vertebrae, which provides a precise sense of [[water pressure]] (and thus depth), and improves hearing.<ref name="biolbull.org"/>

==Evolution==
Swim bladders are evolutionarily closely related (i.e. [[homology (biology)|homologous]]) to [[lung]]s. It is believed that the first lungs, simple sacs connected to the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] that allowed the organism to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions, evolved into the lungs of today's terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s and some fish (e.g. [[lungfish]], [[gar]], and [[bichir]]) and into the swim bladders of the [[ray-finned fish]].<ref name=farmer>{{Cite journal|title=Did lungs and the intracardiac shunt evolve to oxygenate the heart in vertebrates|author=Colleen Farmer|journal=Paleobiology|date=1997|url=http://www.biology.utah.edu/farmer/publications%20pdf/1997%20Paleobiology23.pdf|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> In [[embryo]]nal development, both lung and swim bladder originate as an outpocketing from the gut; in the case of swim bladders, this connection to the gut continues to exist as the pneumatic duct in the more "primitive" ray-finned fish, and is lost in some of the more derived [[teleost]] orders.  There are no animals which have both lungs and a swim bladder.

The [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] (e.g. sharks and rays) split from the other fishes about 420 million years ago and lack both lungs and swim bladders, suggesting that these structures evolved after that split.<ref name="farmer"/> Correspondingly, these fish also have a [[Fish_anatomy#Types_of_fin|heterocercal]] fin which provides the necessary lift needed due to the lack of swim bladders. On the other hand, teleost fish with swim bladders have neutral buoyancy and have no need for this lift.<ref>Kardong, KV (1998) ''Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution''2nd edition, illustrated, revised.

In some Asian cultures, the swim bladders of certain large sea fishes are considered a food delicacy. It is usually served braised or in stews.  Swim bladders are also used in the food industry as a source of collagen.  Swim Bladders can also be made into a strong, water-resistant glue. Swim bladders are also used to make [[isinglass]] for the clarification of [[beer]].

The gas/tissue interface at the swim bladder produces a strong reflection of sound, which is used in [[sonar]] equipment to find fish.

==Similar structures in other organisms==
[[Siphonophores]] have a special swim bladder that allows the jellyfish-like colonies to float along the surface of the water while their tentacles trail below. This organ is unrelated to the one in fish.<ref name="Clark1961">{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=F. E.|coauthors=C. E.
