This is a list of '''seasons played by the Philadelphia Phillies professional baseball club''' of [[Major League Baseball]].  The list documents the season-by-season records of the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]]' franchise including their years as the "Quakers" and the years where they shared the names "Quakers" and "Phillies." The team was formed in the [[National League]] after the dissolution of the [[Worcester Worcesters|Worcester Ruby Legs]] in {{by|1883}}, though there is no additional connection between the teams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/history/timeline01.jsp|title=Philadelphia Phillies History: A timeline|accessdate=2008-04-15 |author= |date= |work=Phillies.com |publisher=}}</ref> 

At times, the Phillies' search for a championship has been seen as an exercise in futility,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/12/sports/PHILADELPHIA.php|title=Baseball: Phillies near 10,000th loss|accessdate=2008-04-25 |author=Longman, Jere |date=June 12, 2007 |work=International Herald Tribune |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.postgazette.com/pg/07170/795230-192.stm|title=Baseball futility: The Pirates, the Phillies and how to define failure|accessdate=2008-04-25 |author= |date=June 19, 2007 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=}}</ref> because of their long stretches of losing seasons,<ref name = bbalm>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/phillies.shtml|title=Philadelphia Phillies|accessdate=2008-04-15 |author= |date= |work=Baseball-Almanac.com |publisher=}}</ref> including an [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]-record sixteen straight from {{by|1933}} to {{by|1948}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08090/869175-63.stm |title=Losing has lost its luster |accessdate=2008-04-15 |author=Dvorchak, Robert |date=March 30, 2008 |work= |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}</ref> However, the Phillies do own four National League pennants, won in {{by|1915}}, {{by|1950}}, {{by|1983}}, and {{by|1993}}, as well as a [[World Series]] victory in [[1980 World Series|1980]] over the [[Kansas City Royals]]. The Phillies have also enjoyed an extended period of success in their history from {{by|1975}} to {{by|1983}}, wherein they won five [[National League East|East Division]] championships as well as the first-half championship in the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened 1981 season]].<ref name = bbalm/> The team can also be described as currently having a period of extended success, wherein they have finished with a [[winning percentage]] under .500 only once since {{by|2000}}; however, this has not translated to playoff success, as the team had been consistently left out until their division championship in {{by|2007}}.

Over their 124 completed seasons (through 2007), they have played 18,881 games, winning 8,853 and losing 10,028, for a winning percentage of .469. The Phillies are also a combined total of 22&ndash;38 (.367) in [[Playoff|post-season]] play.<ref name = bbref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PHI/|title=Philadelphia Phillies History & Encyclopedia  |accessdate=2008-04-15 |author= |date= |work=Baseball-Reference.com |publisher=}}</ref>

The Phillies posted their franchise record for losses in a season during their record-setting streak of sixteen consecutive losing seasons in {{by|1941}} with 111,<ref name=1941Phl/> just shy of the modern (post-[[dead-ball era]]) Major League record of 120 losses in a season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/notebooks/20030921basnot7.asp|title=Baseball Notebook: Losses and Tigers and Mets ... oh my!|accessdate=2008-04-15 |author=Ziants, Steve|date=September 21, 2003 |work= |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/history/year_by_year_results.jsp|title=History: Mets year-by-year results|accessdate=2008-05-02 |author= |date= |work=MLB.com |publisher=Major League Baseball}}</ref> During the 2007 season, the franchise also became the first [[professional sports|professional sports team]] in [[United States of America|American]] history to reach 10,000 losses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/phillies/2007-07-02-Loser-Phillies_N.htm |title=Phillies are No. 1 in loss column |accessdate=2008-04-15 |author=Antonen, Mel |date=July 2, 2007 |work= |publisher=USA Today}}</ref> The Phillies have twice eclipsed [[100 (number)|the century mark]] for wins in a season: in {{by|1976}} with 101 wins,<ref name=1976Phl/> when they made their first playoff appearance in 26 seasons, and again [[1977 in baseball|the next season]] when they matched that mark.<ref name=1977Phl/>
