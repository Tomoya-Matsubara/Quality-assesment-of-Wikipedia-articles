'''Blaxploitation''' is a [[film genre]] that emerged in the [[United States]] in the early 1970s when many [[exploitation film]]s were made specifically (and perhaps exclusively) for an audience of urban [[black people]]; the word itself is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "black" and "exploitation." Blaxploitation films were the first to feature [[soundtrack]]s of [[funk]] and [[soul music]]. These films starred primarily black actors.<ref name="Ebertreview">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040611/REVIEWS/406110302 |title=Review of ''Baadasssss!'' |accessdate=2007-01-04 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2004-06-11 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Chicago ''Sun-Times'' |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'' magazine]] credited ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'' with the invention of the blaxploitation genre.

==Common qualities==
When set in the [[Northern United States|Northeast]] or [[Western United States|West Coast]] of the U.S., Blaxploitation films tend to take place in the [[ghetto]], dealing with [[hit man|hit men]], [[drug dealer]]s and [[pimp]]s. The genre frequently takes place in an atmosphere of crime and drug-dealing. [[Ethnic slur]]s against whites (e.g., "[[honky]]"), and negative white characters like corrupt cops, politicians, prostitutes and gullible gangsters were common. Blaxploitation films set in the [[Southern United States|South]] often take place on a [[plantation]], dealing with [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[miscegenation]].<ref>[http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/18/18_blax.html Bright Lights Film Journal | Blaxploitation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DD103FF93AA35755C0A9669C8B63&pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Holden | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

Blaxploitation includes several types of films, including crime (''[[Foxy Brown (film)|Foxy Brown]]''), action/martial arts (''[[Three the Hard Way (film)|Three the Hard Way]]''), horror (''[[Abby (film)|Abby]]''), comedy (''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]''), nostalgia (''[[Five on the Black Hand Side]]''), coming-of-age/courtroom drama (''[[Cooley High]]/[[Cornbread, Earl and Me]]''), and musical (''[[Sparkle (1976 film)|Sparkle]]''). The primary quality of the blaxploitation film is the targeted marketing to black audiences with the use of exploitable elements such as a black cast and subject matter of interest to [[Black-American]]s.

Following the lead of ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'', many of these films featured [[funk]] and [[soul jazz]] soundtracks with heavy bass, funky beats and wah-wah guitars. These soundtracks are notable for a degree of complexity that was not common for radio-friendly funk tracks and rich orchestration that included uncommon instruments such as flutes and violins.<ref>{{cite web

==Stereotypes==
These films were accused of stereotyping blacks--their target audience--as pimps and drug dealers. This dovetailed with common white stereotypes about black people, and as a result, many called for the end of the blaxploitation genre. The [[NAACP]], the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], and the [[Urban League]] joined together to form the Coalition Against Blaxploitation. Backed by many black film professionals, this group received much media exposure and hastened the death of the genre by the late 1970s.

Blaxploitation films such as ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'', provided the opportunity for future filmmakers to address racial controversies regarding [[inner city]] [[poverty]], and in the early 1990s, a new wave of acclaimed black filmmakers focused on black urban life in their movies, particularly [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' and [[John Singleton]]'s ''[[Boyz N the Hood]]'', among others.

==Famous blaxploitation films==

It is stylistically very different from the original film. It can also be viewed as a 1970s cop film prior to ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' but similar in style.
* ''[[Cotton Comes to Harlem (film)|Cotton Comes to Harlem]]'' was written by Chester Himes and directed by [[Ossie Davis]] in 1970. It featured two black NYPD detectives Coffin Ed played by [[Raymond St. Jacques]] and Gravedigger Jones played by [[Godfrey Cambridge]] who were looking for a money filled bale of cotton stolen by a corrupt reverend named Deke O<U+2019>Malley. ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' star [[Cleavon Little]] makes an appearance in the film.

===1971===
* ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'' (1971) Written, produced, scored, directed by, and starring [[Melvin Van Peebles]], this film is considered by many {{Weasel-inline|date=October 2009}} to be the film that triggered the "blaxploitation" trend.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}<!--who is "many"?--> The hero is raised among prostitutes and is arrested for a crime he did not commit; during his arrest, he saves a [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] from a police beating by attacking the (white) police officers. He becomes a fugitive from (white) police authority and heads for Mexico. After various adventures and assistance from an array of colorful characters, the hero finally crosses the border to safety.

It spawned two sequels, ''[[Shaft's Big Score]]'' (1972) and ''[[Shaft in Africa]]'' (1973), as well as a short-lived TV series starring Roundtree. The concept was revived in 2000 with an all-new [[Shaft (2000 film)|spin-off starring Samuel L. Jackson]] as the nephew of the original John Shaft. <!-- Is it a spin-off or a sequel? Sequel means that it takes place in the same continuity as the original Shaft; to be a spin-off, it would have to follow the story of characters in the original Shaft without being a direct sequel or dealing with the original character Shaft -->
* ''[[Hit Man (film)|Hit Man]]'' (1971) This is the story of an [[Oakland]] hit man or contract killer, played by former [[NFL]] player [[Bernie Casey]], who comes to [[Los Angeles]] after his brother is murdered.

* ''[[Black Dynamite]]'' (2009) starring [[Michael Jai White]], is a spoof of blaxploitation films.

==Later influence and media references==
An early blaxploitation tribute can be seen in the character of "Lite" played by [[Sy Richardson]] in ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' (1984). Richardson would later go on to write ''[[Posse (1993 film)|Posse]]'' (1993), which could be described as a kind of blaxploitation [[Western (genre)|Western]].

Later movies such as ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002), ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'' (2007), and ''[[Undercover Brother]]'' (2002), as well as [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'' (1997), ''[[Kill Bill]], Vol. 1'' (2003), and '' [[Death Proof]]'' (2007) feature [[pop culture]]  nods to the blaxploitation genre. The parody ''Undercover Brother'', for instance, starred [[Eddie Griffin]] as an Afro-topped agent for a clandestine organization satirically known as the ''"B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D."'' Likewise, ''Austin Powers in Goldmember'' co-stars [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] as the [[Tamara Dobson]]/[[Pam Grier]]-inspired [[hero]]ine, ''[[Foxxy Cleopatra]].'' In the 1977 parody film ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', a mock trailer for ''Cleopatra Schwartz'' depicts another Pam Grier-like action star married to a Rabbi. Furthermore, the acclaimed film ''auteur'' and noted fan of [[exploitation film]]s, [[Quentin Tarantino]], has made countless references to the blaxploitation genre in his films, in addition to ''Jackie Brown''. In a famous scene in ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', for instance, the main characters engage in a brief discussion regarding ''[[Get Christie Love!]]'', a mid-1970s blaxploitation [[television series]]. Similarly, in the catalytic scene of ''[[True Romance]]'', the characters are seen viewing the movie ''[[The Mack]]''.

[[John Singleton]]'s remake of ''[[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]]'' (2000) is a modern-day interpretation of a classic blaxploitation film. The 1997 film ''Hoodlum'' starring [[Laurence Fishburne]] was an attempt at gangster blaxploitation, portraying a fictional account of black mobster [[Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson]]. In 2004, [[Mario Van Peebles]], Melvin's son, released ''[[Baadasssss!]]'', a movie based on the making of his father's movie in which Mario played his father. 2007's [[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]], based on the true story of heroin dealer [[Frank Lucas]], takes place in the early 1970s in Harlem and has many elements similar in style to blaxploitation films, specifically when the song [[Across 110th Street]] is played.

Furthermore, blaxploitation films have made a profound impact on contemporary [[hip hop culture]]. Several prominent [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists including [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Ice T]], [[Slick Rick]], and [[Too Short]]) have taken the no-nonsense [[pimp]] persona popularized first by ex-pimp [[Iceberg Slim]]'s 1967 book ''Pimp'' and then by films such as ''[[Super Fly (film)|Super Fly]]'', ''[[The Mack]]'', and ''[[Willie Dynamite]]'', as inspiration for their own works. In fact, many hip-hop artists have paid tribute to pimping within their lyrics (most notably [[50 Cent]]'s hit single "''[[P.I.M.P.]]''") and have openly embraced the pimp image in their [[music videos]], by including entourages of scantily-clad women, flashy jewelry (known as "''[[bling-bling]]''"), and luxury [[Cadillac Eldorado|Cadillacs]] (referred to as "''[[pimpmobile]]s''"). Perhaps the most famous scene of ''[[The Mack]]'', featuring the "Annual [[Players Ball]]", has become an often-referenced [[pop culture]] icon, most recently by ''[[Chappelle's Show|Chapelle's Show]]'', where it was parodied as the "''Player-Haters<U+2019> Ball''."  The genre's overseas influence extends to artists such as Norway's [[Madcon]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ync5XfNNPo Beggin']</ref>

Blaxploitation's influence has carried over into the new medium of webcomics.  In 2009, cartoonist Jay Potts introduced ''World Of Hurt'',<ref>[http://www.worldofhurtonline.com]</ref> a serial, adventure webcomic that pays homage to Black action movies of the 1970s, such as ''Shaft'' or ''Slaughter's Big Rip-Off''.  However, unlike most recent works that reference Blaxploitation, the genre is treated seriously within the strip, not as a source of parody or humor.

In the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], the term 'Brownsploitation' was termed as a play on the word in literary circles, referring to the body of conspiracy fiction that became popular after the success of author [[Dan Brown]]'s "[[The Da Vinci Code]]" and its [[prequel]], "[[Angels and Demons]]."

==Cultural references and parodies==
The notoriety of the genre has led to a number of [[parody|parodies]], some of them humorous, others satirical. The earliest attempts to mock the genre, [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]'' and [[Rudy Ray Moore]]'s ''[[Dolemite]]'', were both made during the heyday of the genre, in 1975. The satirical film ''Coonskin'' was intended to deconstruct racial stereotypes ranging from early [[minstrel show]] stereotypes to more recent stereotypes found in blaxploitation films of the era. However, the work encountered a strong amount of controversy before its release when it was protested by the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], and its distribution was handed to a smaller distributor who advertised ''Coonskin'' as an exploitation film. However, it developed a cult followinng with black viewers.<ref name="DariusJames"/> ''Dolemite'' was less serious in tone and produced as a spoof. ''Dolemite'' centered around a sexually active black pimp played by Moore, who based the film on his [[stand-up comedy]] act. The film was followed by a sequel, ''[[The Human Tornado]]''.

Later spoofs parodying the blaxploitation genre include ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka|I<U+2019>m Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', ''[[Pootie Tang]]'',  ''[[Undercover Brother]]'' and ''[[The Hebrew Hammer]]'', which featured a [[Jew]]ish protagonist, and was jokingly referred to by its director as a "''Jewsploitation''" film. 

A more recent parody is the invention of the ''[[Botsploitation]]'' genre championed by the website botsploitation.com featuring robotic version of famous cultural personalities.

[[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]]'s comedy ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' features a young black actor who is tempted to take part in a white-produced blaxploitation film.

The [[anime]] series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' features several episodes with blaxploitation themes, particularly ''Mushroom Samba'' which extensively parodies blaxploitation movies.

''[[The Onion|The Onion's]]'' book ''[[Our Dumb Century]]'' has an article from the 1970s entitled "Congress Passes Anti-Blaxploitation Act: Pimps, Players Subject to Heavy Fines."

[[Fox Entertainment Group|FOX]]'s network television comedy, "[[MADtv]]", has frequently spoofed the [[Rudy Ray Moore]]-created franchise ''[[Dolemite]]'', with a series of sketches performed by comic actor [[Aries Spears]], in the role of ''"The Son of Dolemite."'' Other sketches include the characters "[[Funkenstein]]", "[[Dr. Funkenstein]]" and more recently [[Condoleezza Rice]] as a blaxploitation superhero. A recurring theme in these sketches is the inexperience of the cast and crew in the Blaxploitation era, with emphasis on ridiculous scripting and shoddy acting, sets, costumes and editing. The sketches are testaments to the poor production quality of the films, with obvious boom mike appearances and intentionally poor cuts and continuity. There was even an episode where the Son of Dolemite met and faced off against [[Black Belt Jones]].

In the movie ''[[Leprechaun in the Hood]]'', a character played by [[Ice-T]] pulls a baseball bat from his afro; this scene is a satire of a similar scene in ''[[Foxy Brown (1974 film)|Foxy Brown]]'', in which [[Pam Grier]] hides a revolver in her afro.

Adult Swim's ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' series has a recurring character called "Boxy Brown" (A play on [[Foxy Brown (1974 film)|Foxy Brown]], a lead character in another blaxploitation film). An imaginary friend of [[Meatwad]], Boxy Brown is a cardboard box with a crudely drawn face with a goatee on it that dons an afro. Whenever Boxy speaks, <U+2019>70s funk music, typical of blaxploitation films, is played in the background. The cardboard box also fronts a confrontational attitude and [[Jive (dialect)|dialect]] similar to many heroes of this film genre.

Some of the TVs found in the action video game ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne]]'' feature a blaxploitation-themed parody of the original ''[[Max Payne]]'' game called ''Dick Justice'', after its main character. In the original Max Payne, there is a dialogue between two mercenaries, one of whom admits that he has christened his gun "Dick Justice." Dick behaves much like the original Max Payne (down to the "constipated" grimace and metaphorical speech) but wears an afro and mustache, and talks in [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics]].

[[Duck King]], a fictional character created for the video game series "[[Fatal Fury (series)|Fatal Fury]]", is a prime example of foreign black stereotypes.

The animated series ''[[Drawn Together]]'' features a character named [[Foxxy Love]] who spoofs both 1970s [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons and blaxploitation characters. Her name is derived from those of the characters [[Foxy Brown (1974 film)|Foxy Brown]] and [[Get Christie Love!|Christie Love]]. Another blaxploitation example is the repeated minor character named [[Judge Fudge]], a talking piece of fudge who is a judge in his own TV show, ''The Judge Fudge Adventure Power Hour.''

The sub-cult movie short ''[[Crackerkillers from Outer Space]]'', a blaxploitation-like science fiction oddity directed by Danish filmmaker DJ and singer [[Morten Lindberg]].

Strip No. 5 of the [[webcomic]] [[Sinfest]] is "The New Blaxploitation Funk Bible," which parodies various biblical events.

Jefferson Twilight, a character in ''The Venture Bros.'', is a parody of the comic-book character Blade (a black, half-vampire vampire-hunter), as well as a blaxploitation reference: he has an afro, sideburns, and a mustache; carries swords; dresses in stylish 1970s clothing; and says that he hunts "Blaculas." He looks and sounds somewhat like Samuel L. Jackson.

The intro credits in [[Beavis and Butthead Do America]] has a Blaxploitation style, even having the theme sung by [[Isaac Hayes]].

[[Professional wrestler]] [[Human Tornado]]'s gimmick is done in vein to blaxploitation films.

[[Family Guy]] has parodied Blaxploitation numerous times using fake movie titles such as "Black to the Future" ([[Back to the Future]]) and "[[Love Blactually]]" ([[Love Actually]]). These parodies occasionally feature a black version of [[Peter Griffin]].

On ''[[30 Rock]]'', [[Tracy Jordan]] claims to have been in a remake of ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'' entitled ''A Blaffair to Rememblack''.
