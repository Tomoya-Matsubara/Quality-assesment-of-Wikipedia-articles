==Early and personal life==
Younis was born in [[Vehari]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] in a Jatt Muslim family in Pakistan. He was educated in [[Sadiq Public School]] in [[Bahawalpur]] in Pakistan, the Pakistani College ([[Pakistan Islamia Higher Secondary School]]) in Sharjah and the Government College in Vehari. He was raised in [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]], where his father was a contract worker. He returned to Pakistan and started playing cricket there during his adolescent years.

He is married to Dr. Faryal Waqar Younis, a [[Pakistani Australian]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Cricket/Waqar-swings-in-for-new-life-on-the-Hill/2005/01/27/1106415736723.html |title=Waqar swings in for new life on the Hill |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=28 January 2005 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> They have a son Azaan Waqar and a daughter Maira Waqar and now lives in [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] in [[Australia]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Cricket/Waqar-swings-in-for-new-life-on-the-Hill/2005/01/27/1106415736723.html Waqar swings in for new life on the Hill]. ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]].'' Retrieved 15 June 2007.</ref> Younis has also worked as a television sports commentator for the [[Nine Network]] in Australia and for [[Ten Sports]] in the United Arab Emirates. He is 6 feet exact .

==Playing career==
Waqar began his cricket career in 1987/88 Pakistan, playing for several [[first-class cricket]] clubs. However he suffered an injury when he had cut and removed his little finger on his left hand,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/281943.html | title=World Cup 2006/07 <U+2013> Fingers optional as Oram pursues dream | publisher=ESPNcricinfo | accessdate=28 February 2007 }}</ref> after he had jumped into a canal. He recovered from this accident and went on to continue his sporting career. He was eventually discovered by former Pakistan captain, [[Imran Khan]] and was selected to be part of the national side.<ref name=cricages>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricages.com/columns/the-two-ws-wasim-and-waqar/ |title=The two W<U+2019>s <U+2013> Wasim and Waqar |publisher=cricages.com |date=21 April 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}</ref>
He had played only six first class games when he got picked for the Pakistan camp out of the blue. Waqar says "I remember Imran was not feeling well at the time, and was not present at the camp. Luckily the Super Wills Cup was going on, and there was a match between United Bank and Delhi XI. Saleem Jaffar got injured, and I got the opportunity to play that game. Imran watched me on TV, and actually came to the ground to watch the end of the game. The very next day, he met me and told me that I will be going to Sharjah next month. Just meeting Imran at the time was enough of an experience for me, but for him to notify me of my selection was just out of this world."

===Domestic===
English audiences became aware of Waqar's talent during the early 1990s, when he played for [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. By taking 113 wickets in 582 overs for Surrey in 1991, at a mere 14.65 apiece, and by carrying on his shoulders an otherwise moderate county attack, he announced himself as one of the finest contemporary bowlers.<ref name=WISDEN>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154426.html |title=CRICKETER OF THE YEAR 1992 <U+2013> Waqar Younis |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}</ref> There he displayed excellent cricketing performances and attracted attention from the sporting public. He went on to win the English County Championship with [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in 1997. He took 7 wickets for 25 against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] at Liverpool on 21 June 1997, which included a hat-trick achieved after narrowly missing a hat-trick earlier in the innings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/INTERACTIVE/AWARDS/CIPOM_JUN1997.html |title=Player of the Month <U+2013> June 1997: Waqar Younis |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}</ref>

===International===
Waqar made his International cricket debut for Pakistan against [[India cricket team|India]] on 16 November 1989, in the same match that Indian batsman [[Sachin Tendulkar]] made his debut. Waqar took 4 wickets in the drawn match including the wickets of Tendulkar and [[Kapil Dev]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65847.html |title=Champions Trophy <U+2013> 2nd match |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |date=14 October 1989 |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}</ref> He made an immediate impression with his speed and became known in the cricket media as "Wiki"<ref name="waqar_nick">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/team_pages/pakistan/player_profiles/default.stm |title=Cricket World Cup 2003 <U+2013> Waqar Younis |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |date=15 January 2007 |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}</ref> or the "Burewala Express".<ref name = waqar_nick/> Waqar along with [[Wasim Akram]] opened the bowling attack regularly for Pakistan, becoming a feared and potent attack.<ref name="Deadly duos">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/greatestteams/content/story/545226.html |title=Greatest Partnerships <U+2013> Deadly duos |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}</ref> At his peak, he developed into a very quick fast bowler and also became famous for achieving a [[hat-trick (cricket)|hat-trick]] in a One Day International match against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1994.<ref name="Deadly duos">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/66014.html |title=Mandela Trophy <U+2013> 11th match |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |date=19 December 1994 |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}</ref> During the early periods of 2000, he stayed out of the Pakistan team for a brief period allegedly due to suspension and conflicts with bowling partner and captain Akram.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/133685.html |title=Mudassar: Wasim and Waqar rivalry undermined Pakistan cricket |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |date=15 September 2003 |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pakpassion.net/ppforum/showthread.php?p=1537155 |title=The days of Waqar vs Wasim |publisher=PakPassion |date=21 June 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}</ref>

The World Twenty20 was followed with the [[2010 Asia Cup]] in which Pakistan lost to Sri Lanka by a narrow margin as Pakistan's top order collapsed and [[Shahid Afridi]]'s 109 just failed to guide Pakistan to victory.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/asia2010/content/story/463203.html | title=Malinga helps super Sri Lanka survive Afridi | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | date=21 June 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> In the following match Pakistan lost narrowly against India courtesy of a six by [[Harbhajan Singh]] from the third ball of the final over.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/asia2010/content/story/463841.html | title=Pakistan eliminated in cliffhanger | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | date=19 June 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> The following match was a dead rubber between Pakistan and Bangladesh and another Afridi century meant Pakistan scored 385 runs and they comfortably won the match by 139 runs<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/asia2010/content/current/story/464102.html | title=Afridi's century flattens Bangladesh | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | date=21 June 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref>

A tour of England followed, with two Twenty20's against Australia and two Test matches. Pakistan won both Twenty20's comfortably and the first Test saw Pakistan defeated by 154 runs. Pakistan rallied in the second Test and for the first time in 15 years Pakistan defeated Australia in a Test match. The previous victory in 1995 was also assisted by a superb bowling spell by Waqar Younis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-australia-2010/content/story/468696.html | title=Pakistan prevail in thrilling finale | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | date=24 July 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref>

This tour was followed by a controversial tour of England as Pakistan headed in to the final Test match needing to win it to level the series 2<U+2013>2. The [[News of the World]] broke the news that [[Mohammad Amir]], [[Mohammad Asif]] and captain [[Salman Butt]] were involved in [[Spot-fixing]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/8953757.stm | title=Pakistan spot-fixing scandal: the key figures | publisher=BBC | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> This saw the three players temporarily suspended<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-pakistan-2010/content/story/475624.html | title=ICC suspend trio under anti-corruption code | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | date=2 September 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> and Pakistan lost by an innings and 225 runs <U+2013> their biggest defeat in history.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-pakistan-2010/content/story/474943.html | title=Pakistan slump to massive defeat amid huge scandal | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | date=26 August 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> Low team morale meant the next two T20 matches were won comfortably by England, and the subsequent ODI series was won 3<U+2013>2 by England as well.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-pakistan-2010/engine/series/426350.html | title=Pakistan tour of England, 2010 / Results | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref>

This was followed by a tour of Abu Dhabi against South Africa. Pakistan lost the first Twenty20 match by six wickets following a batting collapse. Pakistan also lost the ODI series of five matches 3<U+2013>2.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/461563.html | title=South Africa tour of United Arab Emirates, 2010/11 / Results  | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> Pakistan won the second ODI due to [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]]'s superb performance of 109* off 72 balls.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-south-africa-2010/content/story/484507.html | title=Rampant Razzaq stuns South Africa | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | date=31 October 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> The Test series of two matches with South Africa was drawn.

Pakistan started the World Cup campaign in a strong fashion winning 5 out their 6 group matches and finishing on top of their group. Pakistan went on to beat West Indies in the quarter-finals by 10 wickets but lost to India in the semi-finals by 29 runs. Waqar eventually stepped down as Pakistan coach in August of 2011 citing personal reasons but a rift with captain Shahid Afridi may have been a contributing factor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/528774.html | title=Waqar Younis Resigns as Pakistan Coach | publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] | date=20 August 2011 | accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref>

In May 2014, Waqar was reappointed as the head coach of [[Pakistan Cricket team]] for a period of two years, commencing from June 2014, hence serving in that capacity for the second time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/742267.html |title=Waqar Younis given second term as Pakistan coach |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2014 }}</ref>

==Style==
Waqar is one of several Pakistani fast bowlers, beginning with [[Sarfraz Nawaz]], who have been successful at bowling [[reverse swing]].<ref name="king">{{cite news|title=The king of reverse swing|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/134276.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|date=8 April 2004|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="Swing">{{cite news|title=Swing and seam bowling|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/4155734.stm|publisher=BBC|date=19 August 2005|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> In partnership with Akram, Younis opened the Pakistan bowling attack in the 1990s. Cricket critics and scholars attribute Younis and Akram to be one of the most effective fast bowling partnerships in cricket, due to their ability to swing the ball at high speed. The ability to reverse swing and his speed led to him becoming one of the most talented bowlers in modern cricket.<ref name="cricages"/><ref name="Deadly duos"/>

Waqar explained his ability to reverse swing by the manipulation of an old ball; with one side shiny, one side rough, the ball would move in the opposite direction to conventional swing.<ref name="king"/> This led to Waqar having the ability to bowl [[inswinger]]s and [[outswinger]]s in the cricket pitch and in effect both Waqar and Akram became successful in taking wickets by this variation of [[swing bowling]].<ref name="Swing"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Reverse swing <U+2013> a rough guide|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/144221.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|year=2000|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The advent of reverse swing|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/469995.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|date=7 August 2010|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> His fastest delivery in cricket was 153&nbsp;km/h or 95.1&nbsp;mph, a delivery he bowled against South Africa in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fire fight gets hotter|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/1927767.stm|publisher=BBC|date=13 April 2002|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Records / All cricket records (including minor cricket) / Miscellaneous records / Bowling speeds (1)|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/95065.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> He was also effective in the use of [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncers]] or short pitch deliveries; Waqar's bowling against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] in [[Sheikhupura]] in Pakistan, is remembered for his effective use of the short pitched delivery.

Following Pakistan's victory during the Test match series versus [[England cricket team|England]] in 1992, the English media were suspicious of the reverse swing delivery. It was relatively unknown to the cricketing world during that period and this led to accusations of foul play by [[critic]]s, however cricket officials found no evidence of foul play and the skill of the reverse swing delivery has been accepted in cricket.<ref>{{cite news|title=WISDEN: Subtle law change would free Waqar and co from controversy, 1993 <U+2013> Pakistani bowling <U+2013> fair or foul?|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152058.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ENGLAND v PAKISTAN 1992|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152067.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=Banana>{{cite news|title=The Joy of Six: great England batting collapses|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/feb/11/englandcricketteam-cricket|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 April 2012|location=London|first=Rob|last=Smyth|date=11 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=An oriental art comes full circle|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/216694.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|date= 21 August 2005|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref>

Sri Lanka fast bowler, Lasith Malinga, who became the first bowler in World Cup history to take two hat-tricks, has said that he learnt to bowl his deadly yorkers by watching Pakistan's legendary pair of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis.<ref>{{cite news|title=I learnt a lot from watching Waqar and Wasim <U+2013> Malinga|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/content/story/503774.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|date= 1 March 2011|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=I learned from Waqar, Wasim <U+2013> Lasith

The title of Banana Swing Bowler was given to Waqar Younis because of his unique technique of swinging the ball in the air at very high speed before hitting the ground. In most of his hat tricks he has delivered banana swing balls which were unplayable.<ref name=Banana/>

Despite his qualities as a fast bowler, he was expensive at times and sometimes lacked the consistency of bowlers such as [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian]] fast bowler [[Curtly Ambrose]] and [[Australian cricket team|Australian]] fast bowler [[Glenn McGrath]]. This may be partly due to the mentality of his former captain, [[Imran Khan]], who prioritised aggression and speed.<ref name="cricages"/>

==Fan following==
The world's fastest sprinter and runner [[Usain Bolt]], who is from [[Jamaica]] (in the West Indies), once famously replied while being asked about who were his heroes when he was a child: "When I was really small I loved the Pakistan cricket team. Waqar Younis was one of the greatest bowlers ever, and I was a bowler so I really enjoyed watching him. I was a big Pakistan fan until I got older, when I noticed that I should actually support my home team." When asked what if there was a match between Pakistan and Windies, Bolt remarked "I would still have supported Pakistan, that<U+2019>s what I<U+2019>m saying <U+2013> when I was little, it was all about Pakistan."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/7877158.stm|title=A great day to be a Windies fan <U+2013> Usain Bolt|work=BBC | date=7 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2012/08/26/bolt-a-fan-of-pakistan-and-waqar-younis/|title=Bolt <U+2013> a fan of Pakistan and Waqar Younis|work=Dawn|date=26 August 2012|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>
