'''Samuel Bruce "Sammy" Vick''' (April 12, 1895 <U+2013> August 17, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] professional [[right fielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. He played for the [[New York Yankees]] from 1917 to 1920, and the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1921. He stood {{height|ft=5|in=10}}, and weighed 163&nbsp;lb., and he batted and threw [[right-handed]]. He was born in [[Batesville, Mississippi]], and attended [[Millsaps College]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].

After playing one season of [[minor league baseball]] in 1917, Vick was signed by the Yankees and was used sparingly by them later that same season. He became their starting right fielder in 1919. With [[Babe Ruth]]'s arrival, and [[Bob Meusel]]'s emergence in 1920, Vick's productivity and playing time dimished. Following the season, he was traded to the Red Sox in a deal that brought future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] pitcher [[Waite Hoyt]] to the Yankees. In his five-season career, Vick had a .248&nbsp;[[batting average]], with two [[home run]]s and 50&nbsp;[[run batted in|RBIs]] in 213&nbsp;games played. 

After his major league career ended after the 1921&nbsp;season, he returned to the minor leagues and played in various leagues until 1930. Vick died, after a long illness, in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], at age 91.

==Career==
===New York Yankees===
Vick made his [[Major League Baseball]]&nbsp;(MLB) debut with the Yankees on September&nbsp;20, 1917.<ref name=retrovick/> He finished the season with the Yankees, playing in 10&nbsp;games, all in right field. In 36&nbsp;[[at bat]]s during that stretch, he collected 10&nbsp;[[hit (baseball)|hits]] for a .278&nbsp;batting average.<ref name=retrovick/> He played in just two games during the early part of the 1918&nbsp;season, before being drafted into the military.<ref name=retrovick/><ref name="stour73">Stout, p. 73</ref> The first appearance occurred on April&nbsp;19, in the second game of a [[double header]] against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. He relieved starting right fielder [[Frank Gilhooley]] late in the game, and collected a hit in each of his two at bats in against Red Sox [[pitcher]], [[Babe Ruth]]. He had a [[run batted in]]&nbsp;(RBI) and scored a [[run (baseball)|run]] in the game, although the Red Sox won the game by a score of 9 to 5.<ref name=boxscore41917>{{cite web|title=Boston Red Sox 9, New York Yankees 5 (2)|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1918/B04192BOS1918.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref> His other appearance that season was as a [[pinch hitter]] in a game against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] on April&nbsp;25, and failed to collect a hit.<ref name=boxscore42518>{{cite web|title=Washington Senators 7, New York Yankees 5|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1918/B04250NYA1918.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref>

In 1919, Vick became the Yankees's starting right fielder.<ref name=1919roster>{{cite web|title=The 1919 New York Yankees Regular Season Roster|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1919/UPNYA01919.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref> On April&nbsp;30, in his fourth appearance of the season, he led off the bottom of the first inning with a [[home run]] off of [[Mule Watson]] of the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]]: his first career home run.<ref name=1919gamelog>{{cite web|title=The 1919 NY A Regular Season Batting Log for Sammy Vick|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1919/Ivicks1010031919.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=homerunlog>{{cite web|title=Sammy Vick Career Home Runs|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/event_hr.cgi?id=vicksa01&t=b|work=baseball-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref>  He struggled at the plate during the first two months of the season, with a batting average of .208&nbsp;after the June 1 game. However, he began to increase his productivity in June and July. By early August, he had raised his average to a season-high of .266.<ref name=1919gamelog/> It was during that time period when he hit his second, and last, major league home run. It was a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] off of [[Allan Sothoron]] in a game on August&nbsp;7: a 8<U+2013>2&nbsp;victory over the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]].<ref name=homerunlog/><ref name=boxscore871919>{{cite web|title=New York Yankees 8, St. Louis Browns 2 (2)|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1919/B08072NYA1919.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref> For the remainder of the season, Vick's production had a steady, slow decline; he finished the season with a .248&nbsp;batting average, along with 27&nbsp;RBIs, 15&nbsp;doubles, and nine triples.<ref name=referencevick/>

Vick's playing time dwindled in 1920 with the arrival of Babe Ruth, an off-season purchase from the Red Sox.<ref name=retroruth>{{cite web|title=Babe Ruth|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/R/Pruthb101.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref> The Yankees now had an outfield that consisted of Ruth, established players of [[Duffy Lewis]] and [[Ping Bodie]], and [[Bob Meusel]], a [[rookie]].<ref name=1920yankees>{{cite web|title=The 1920 New York Yankees Regular Season Roster|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1920/UPNYA01920.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}</ref> Injuries to Lewis and Bodie allowed for periods of lengthy playing time for Vick in July and September.<ref name=torontoworld1920>{{cite news|title=Desperate Battles in Major Drives|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K0pLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6ikDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2854,3762330&dq=vick+yankees&hl=en|accessdate=May 17, 2012|newspaper=''The Toronto World''|date=September 9, 1920}}</ref><ref name=vickgamelog1920>{{cite web|title=The 1920 NY A Regular Season Batting Log for Sammy Vick|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1920/Ivicks1010041920.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref> Later in the season, Vick and his manager [[Miller Huggins]] got into a heated arguement, during which Vick punched Huggins.

He was so much so that they proclaimed that any time someone ate a large meal, they were "doing a Sammy Vick."<ref name="wagenheim63">Wagenheim, p. 63</ref>

===Boston Red Sox===
The Yankees felt that Vick had not lived up to his potential during his four seasons with the team. Considering the team now had a solid outfield of Ruth, Meusel, Lewis, and Bodie, and the Yankees needed pitching; Vick became expendable.<ref name=bigtrade1920>{{cite news|title=Yanks And Boston Close Big Trade|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0091EFE3C5810738DDDAF0994DA415B808EF1D3|accessdate=May 17, 2012|newspaper=''The New York Times''|date=December 16, 1920}}</ref> On December&nbsp;15, 1920, the Yankees traded Vick, [[Muddy Ruel]], [[Del Pratt]] and [[Hank Thormahlen]] to the Red Sox for [[Waite Hoyt]], [[Harry Harper]], [[Wally Schang]] and [[Mike McNally]].<ref name=retrovick/>

Vick began the 1921&nbsp;season with an injured leg, which did not allow him the play in either April or May.<ref name=globevickinjury>{{cite news|title=Washington Routs The Red Sox Twice|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/718769832.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jul+05%2C+1921&author=&pub=Boston+Daily+Globe+(1872-1922)&desc=WASHINGTON+ROUTS+THE+RED+SOX+TWICE&pqatl=google|accessdate=May 17, 2012|newspaper=''[[Boston Globe]]''|date=July 5, 1921}}</ref> He did not appear in a game until June&nbsp;2, and was mostly used as a pinch hitter and late-game replacement. He was absent from the line-up for most of July as well, until August when again, he was used mainly as a pinch hitter.<ref name=gamelog1921>{{cite web|title=The 1921 BOS A Regular Season Batting Log for Sammy Vick|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1921/Ivicks1010051921.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref> In total, he played in just 44&nbsp;games for the Red Sox, with only 15&nbsp;games in the outfield; 12 of them starting the game. Vick had a season-total of 77&nbsp;at bats, a .260&nbsp;batting average, and nine RBIs.<ref name=retrovick/>

==Post major league career==
After the 1921&nbsp;season, Vick continued his baseball career in the minor leagues. In 1922, he played for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[International League]], batting .233&nbsp;in 50&nbsp;games played. He returned to the Memphis Chickasaws for one season in 1923, improving his average to .290. For the 1924 season, he joined the [[Brookhaven, Mississippi|Brookhaven]] Truckers of the [[Cotton States League]]&nbsp;(CSL) as [[player-manager]], and he produced the best offensive numbers up to this point in his career. He batted .322 with 16&nbsp;home runs, 21&nbsp;doubles, and 11&nbsp;triples.<ref name=vickminors/> 

In 1925, Vick stayed in the CSL, but became the [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]] Lumberjacks's non-playing [[manager (baseball)|manager]] for two seasons. However, in 1926, his tenure was short, and he joined the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] of the SA as a player only for the remaining 32&nbsp;games of the season. After batting .348 in 1926, he improved his average to .350 in 1927, along with career-highs in hits with 194, doubles with 39, and triples with 16. Staying in New Orleans for the 1928&nbsp;season, his offensive numbers dropped, but he still batted .302&nbsp;in 109&nbsp;games played. His 1929&nbsp;season was split between three teams; the Pelicans, the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]] of the SA, and the [[Dallas Rangers|Dallas Steers]] of the [[Texas League]]. That season, he hit a career-high 17&nbsp;home runs, along with a .333&nbsp;batting average. He finished his minor league career back with Memphis in 1930.<ref name=vickminors/>

===Later life===
According to the 1930 U.S. Census, he became a teacher at a public school in [[Panola County, Mississippi]], following his baseball career. He was married to Lois M., had three sons, and had one daughter.<ref name=1930census>{{cite web|title=1930 United States Federal Census about Samuel B Vick|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=1&new=1&MSAV=0&msT=1&gss=angs-g&gsfn=Samuel+Bruce&gsln=Vick&mswpn__ftp=Tennessee%2c+USA&mswpn=45&mswpn_PInfo=5-%7c0%7c1652393%7c0%7c2%7c3246%7c45%7c0%7c0%7c0%7c0%7c&msbdy=1895&uidh=ao4&pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&h=37508443&db=1930usfedcen&indiv=1|work=ancestry.com|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref> Vick died on August&nbsp;17, 1986 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] after a long illness, and is interred at Forrest Memorial Park located in Batesville.<ref name=retrovick/><ref name=vickobit>{{cite web|title=The Obit for Sammy Vick|url=http://www.thedeadballera.com/Obits/Obits_V/Vick.Sammy.Obit.html|work=thedeadballera.com|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref>
