'''''Vance v. Terrazas''''', [[Case citation|444 U.S. 252]] (1980), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that [[Stare decisis|established]] that a [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizen]] cannot have his or her citizenship [[United_States_nationality_law#Loss_of_citizenship|taken away]] unless he or she has acted with an intent to give up that citizenship.  The Supreme Court overturned portions of an act of Congress which had listed various actions and had said that the performance of any of these actions could be taken as conclusive, irrebuttable proof of intent to give up U.S. citizenship.  However, the Court ruled that a person's intent to give up citizenship could be established through a standard of [[preponderance of evidence]] (i.e., more likely than not) <U+2014> rejecting an argument that intent to relinquish citizenship could only be found on the basis of [[Clear and convincing evidence|clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence]].<ref name=ABA_Journal>{{cite journal | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=83VMMk9dyu0C&pg=PA374&lpg=PA374 | title=Supreme Court Report | journal=ABA Journal | date=March 1980 | page=374 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zktPurWpQyYC&pg=SA9-PA78&lpg=SA9-PA78 | title=Multistate and Multinational Estate Planning | volume=1 | date=2009 | publisher=CCH | first=Jeffrey A. | last=Schoenblum | page=9-78 }}</ref>

Laurence Terrazas was born in the United States in 1947.<ref name=577F2d7_para2>{{cite court | url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/577/7/112973/ | litigants = Terrazas v.

Before the 1967 Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]],'' U.S. law had provided for numerous ways for U.S. citizens to lose their citizenship.  In its ''Afroyim'' ruling, the Supreme Court held that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] barred Congress from revoking anyone's U.S. citizenship without their consent.  Specifically, the court held that a law automatically revoking the U.S. citizenship of anyone who had voted in a foreign election was unconstitutional and unenforceable.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1dtn0olA8PcC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71 | encyclopedia=Dictionary of Politics: Selected American and foreign political and legal terms | first=Walter John | last=Raymond | title=Citizenship | page=71 | date=1992 | publisher=Brunswick Publishing }}</ref>  However, U.S. law continued after ''Afroyim'' to list several other "expatriating acts," the voluntary performance of any of which would result in automatic loss of citizenship.<ref name=8usc1481>[[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Nationality Act]], sec. 349; 8 [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1481.html sec. 1481].  The phrase ''"voluntarily performing any of the following acts with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality"'' was added in 1986, and various other changes have been made over time to the list of expatriating acts; see [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001481----000-notes.html notes].</ref>

The [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that according to ''Afroyim v. Rusk,'' "Congress is constitutionally devoid of the power" to revoke citizenship<ref name=577F2d7_para18>{{cite court | url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/577/7/112973/ | litigants = Terrazas v.

== Opinion of the Court ==
A 5-to-4 majority of the Supreme Court held, first, that it was not enough for the government to prove "the voluntary commission of an act, such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation, that 'is so inherently inconsistent with the continued retention of American citizenship that Congress may accord to it its natural consequences, i. e., loss of nationality.'"  Rather, the court held that its 1967 ruling in ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' "emphasized that loss of citizenship requires the individual's 'assent,' . . . in addition to his voluntary commission of the expatriating act"<U+2014>and that "the trier of fact must in the end conclude that the citizen not only voluntarily committed the expatriating act prescribed in the statute, but also intended to relinquish his citizenship."<ref name=ABA_Journal />  On this point, the Supreme Court agreed with the 7th Circuit ruling in Terrazas's favor.

The majority then turned its attention to the question of a standard of proof in loss-of-citizenship cases.  Terrazas had argued<U+2014>and the 7th Circuit had agreed<U+2014>that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted in ''Afroyim,'' had left Congress without any constitutional authority to set the standard of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of clear and convincing evidence. The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of [[preponderance of evidence]] (i.e., more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of U.S. citizenship were involved.<ref name=ABA_Journal />

Finally, the Supreme Court majority upheld the validity of another aspect of the law as enacted by Congress<U+2014>namely, that it was all right for the government to assume that a potentially expatriating act had been performed voluntarily, and that any claim that a person had acted under duress was up to the person involved to establish by preponderance of evidence.<ref name=ABA_Journal />

The Supreme Court did not explicitly rule on whether or not Terrazas had lost his U.S. citizenship; rather, it [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed the case back to the original trial court (a [[United States District Court|Federal District Court]] in [[Illinois]]) for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling.

Although the court's membership was divided on the question of whether a "preponderance of evidence" standard was sufficient for establishing someone's intent to give up their U.S. citizenship, all nine justices <U+2014> the five who joined in the majority opinion, and also the four who dissented (see below), unanimously agreed with the key holding in ''Afroyim v. Rusk'' that U.S. citizenship was safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment and could not be taken away by an act of Congress from a person who had not wanted to give it up.

=== Dissents ===
The four justices who disagreed with the majority filed three separate dissenting opinions.  All of the dissenting justices supported the ''Afroyim v. Rusk'' principle that retention of U.S. citizenship was a constitutionally protected right, and they all agreed (contrary to the court's majority) that Terrazas's actions should not have led to the loss of his U.S. citizenship.

Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] rejected the majority's decision that an intent to give up U.S. citizenship could be established merely by a preponderance of evidence. Arguing that "the Court's casual dismissal of the importance of American citizenship cannot withstand scrutiny",<ref>{{cite court | litigants=Vance v. Terrazas | url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/444/252/case.html | vol=444 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=252 | date=1980 | pinpoint=271 }}</ref> he said he "would hold that a citizen may not lose his citizenship in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that he intended to do so."<ref>{{cite court | litigants=Vance v. Terrazas | url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/444/252/case.html | vol=444 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=252 | date=1980 | pinpoint=272 }}</ref>

Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] also argued that "a person's interest in retaining his American citizenship is surely an aspect of 'liberty' of which he cannot be deprived without due process of law," and that "due process requires that a clear and convincing standard of proof be met" in Terrazas' case or others like it.<ref>{{cite court | litigants=Vance v. Terrazas | url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/444/252/case.html | vol=444 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=252 | date=1980 | pinpoint=274 }}</ref>  Additionally, Stevens felt that Congress had not adequately addressed the question of specific intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship.  "Since we accept dual citizenship," he wrote, "taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign government is not necessarily inconsistent with an intent to remain an American citizen.  Moreover, as now written, the statute cannot fairly be read to require a finding of specific intent to relinquish citizenship."<ref>{{cite court | litigants=Vance v. Terrazas | url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/444/252/case.html | vol=444 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=252 | date=1980 | pinpoint=272 }}</ref>

Justices [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]], and [[Potter Stewart]] argued that since Terrazas was born a dual U.S./Mexican national, his having taken an oath of allegiance to Mexico was not in any way inconsistent with his also being a citizen of the U.S.  In Brennan's words:  "The formal oath [of allegiance to Mexico] adds nothing to the existing foreign citizenship and, therefore, cannot affect his United States citizenship."<ref>{{cite court | litigants=Vance v. Terrazas | url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/444/252/case.html | vol=444 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=252 | date=1980 | pinpoint=276 }}</ref>  Brennan argued, in addition, that since "Congress has provided for a procedure by which one may formally renounce citizenship" before U.S. consular officials<U+2014>a procedure which it was conceded by all that Terrazas had not availed himself of<U+2014>Terrazas was still a U.S. citizen.<ref>{{cite court | litigants=Vance v. Terrazas | url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/444/252/case.html | vol=444 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=252 | date=1980 | pinpoint=275 }}</ref>

== Subsequent developments ==
After receiving Terrazas' case back from the Supreme Court on remand, the district court again ruled that Terrazas had lost his U.S. citizenship.<ref>{{cite court | litigants=Terrazas v. Muskie | vol=494 | reporter=F.Supp. | opinion=1017 | court=N.D. Ill. | date=1980 }}</ref>  On subsequent appeal, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed its earlier decision and<U+2014>this time using a preponderance-of-evidence standard per the instructions of the Supreme Court<U+2014>ruled against him, finding this time that there was "abundant evidence that plaintiff intended to renounce his United States citizenship when he acquired the Certificate of Mexican Nationality willingly, knowingly, and voluntarily."<ref>{{cite court | litigants=Terrazas v. Haig | vol=653 | reporter=F.2d | opinion=285 | court=7th Cir. | date=1981}}</ref>  Since the office of [[U.S. Secretary of State]] changed hands twice following the Supreme Court's ruling in the case <U+2014> [[Edmund Muskie]] replacing [[Cyrus Vance]] in 1980, and [[Alexander Haig]] assuming the position in 1981 <U+2014> the subsequent lower court cases are known as ''Terrazas v. Muskie'' and ''Terrazas v. Haig.''

Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1986 to specify, as required by ''Vance v. Terrazas,'' that a potentially expatriating act may result in loss of U.S. citizenship only if it was performed "with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality".<ref name=8usc1481 /><ref>Public Law 99-653; 100 Stat. 3655; 1986 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News 6182.</ref>

Although the ''Terrazas'' ruling left intact Congress's right to specify a preponderance-of-evidence standard for judging intent to give up U.S. citizenship, the State Department in 1990 adopted a policy which, in most cases, pursues loss-of-citizenship proceedings only when an individual affirmatively states that he or she intends to relinquish U.S. citizenship.<ref>67 ''Interpreter Releases'' 799 (July 23, 1990); 67 ''Interpreter Releases'' 1092 (October 1, 1990).</ref>  When a case involving possible expatriation comes to the attention of a U.S. consular officer, the officer will normally "simply ask the applicant if there was intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship when performing the act.  If the answer is no, the consular officer will certify that it was '''not''' the person's intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship and, consequently, find that the person has retained U.S. citizenship."<ref>[http://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_778.html ''Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Citizenship and Dual Nationality''] (U.S. State Department web site).</ref>

A bill was introduced in 2005 which sought, among other things, to force the State Department to abolish the above policy on loss of citizenship and reinstate its pre-1990 policy "of viewing dual/multiple citizenship as problematic and as something to be discouraged, not encouraged."<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:hr3938: H.R. 3938 (109th Congress), sec. 703.]</ref>  However, this bill never made it to the floor of the House and died in committee when the [[109th Congress]] adjourned.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HR03938:@@@X All Congressional actions] for H.R. 3938 (109th Congress).</ref>
