==League sports==
The following is a list of the sports that the Greater Middlesex Conference offers. Some sports do not have a team from every school, while other sports have teams from all 33 member schools. Each bullet is an individual team (as in one team for girls and one team for boys &mdash; not a combined unisex team). For example, although the boys and girls track teams from a single school usually practice together and have meets at the same time, there are separate events at their meets for boys and for girls, and therefore, the teams are scored and compete separately.

=== Fall sports ===
*Cross Country
*Field Hockey
*[[American football|Football]]
*Soccer
*Tennis (Girls)
*Volleyball (Girls)

=== Winter sports ===
*Basketball
*Bowling
