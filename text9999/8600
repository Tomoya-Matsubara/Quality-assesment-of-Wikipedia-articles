The '''Treaty of Fort Wise''' of  1861 was a treaty entered into between the United States and six chiefs of the Southern [[Cheyenne]] and four of the Southern [[Arapaho]] [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Indian]] tribes. A significant proportion of Cheyennes opposed this treaty on the grounds that only a minority of Cheyenne chiefs had signed, and without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe. Different responses to the treaty became a source of conflict between whites and Indians, leading to the [[Colorado War]] of 1864, including the [[Sand Creek Massacre]].

==Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)==
By the terms of the 1851 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] between the United States and various tribes including the Cheyenne and Arapaho,<ref name="fortlaramietreaty1851">"Treaty of Fort Laramie with Sioux, Etc., 1851." 11 Stats. 749, Sept. 17, 1851.</ref> the Cheyenne and Arapaho were recognized to hold a vast territory encompassing the lands between the [[North Platte River]] and [[Arkansas River]] and eastward from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to western [[Kansas]]. This area included present-day southeastern [[Wyoming]], southwestern [[Nebraska]], most of eastern [[Colorado]], and the westernmost portions of Kansas.<ref name="greene-27">Greene 2004, p. 27.</ref>  However, the discovery in November 1858 of [[gold]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]] in Colorado<ref name="hoig2-61">Hoig 1980, p. 61.</ref> (then part of the western [[Kansas Territory]])<ref name="greene-12">Greene 2004, p. 12.</ref> brought on a [[Pikes Peak Gold Rush|gold rush]] and a consequent flood of white emigration across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands.<ref name="hoig2-61"/> Colorado territorial officials pressured federal authorities to redefine the extent of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] treaty lands,<ref name="greene-27"/> and in the fall of 1860 A.B. Greenwod, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, arrived at Bent's New Fort along the Arkansas River to negotiate a new treaty.<ref name="hoig2-61"/>

==Treaty of Fort Wise (1861)==
On February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States,<ref name="fortwisetreaty">"Treaty with the Arapaho and Cheyenne, 1861" (Treaty of Fort Wise). 12 Stat. 1163, p. 810.</ref> at [[Bent's_Old_Fort_National_Historic_Site#Destruction|Bent's New Fort]] at [[Big Timbers]] near what is now [[Lamar, Colorado]], recently leased by the U.S. Government and renamed [[Fort Wise]], in which they ceded to the United States most of the lands designated to them by the Fort Laramie treaty.<ref name="greene-27"/>  The Cheyenne chiefs were [[Black Kettle]], White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little Wolf, Tall Bear, and Left Hand; the Arapaho chiefs were Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, and Big Mouth.<ref name="fortwisetreaty"/>

The new reserve, less than one-thirteenth the size of the 1851 reserve,<ref name="greene-27"/> was located in eastern Colorado<ref name="greene-12"/> along the Arkansas River between the northern boundary of New Mexico and Sand Creek.<ref>"Beginning at the mouth of the Sandy Fork of the Arkansas River and extending westwardly along the said river to the mouth of Purgatory River; thence along up the west bank of the Purgatory River to the northern boundary of the Territory of New Mexico; thence west along said boundary to a point where a line drawn due south from a point on the Arkansas River, five miles east of the mouth of the Huerfano River, would intersect said northern boundary of New Mexico; thence due north from that point on said boundary of the Sandy Fork to the place of the beginning."</ref><ref name="greene-27"/> Some bands of Cheyenne including the [[Dog Soldiers]], a militaristic band of Cheyennes and [[Lakota people|Lakotas]] that had evolved beginning in the 1830s, were angry at those chiefs who had signed the treaty, disavowing the treaty and refusing to abide by its constraints.<ref name="greene-12-13">Greene 2004, pp. 12-13.</ref> They continued to live and hunt in the [[bison]]-rich lands of eastern Colorado and western Kansas, becoming increasingly belligerent over the tide of white immigration across their lands, particularly in the Smoky Hill River country of Kansas, along which whites had opened a new trail to the gold fields.<ref name="hoig2-62">Hoig 1980, p. 62.</ref> Cheyennes opposed to the treaty said that it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts. The whites, however, claimed the treaty was a "solemn obligation" and considered that those Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war.<ref name="hyde-118">Hyde 1968, p. 118.</ref>

==Colorado War and Sand Creek Massacre==
{{main|Colorado War|Sand Creek massacre}}

The beginning of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861 led to the organization of military forces in [[Colorado Territory]]. In March 1862, the Coloradans defeated the Texas Confederate Army in the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] in [[New Mexico]]. Following the battle, the [[1st Colorado Volunteers|First Regiment of Colorado Volunteers]] returned to Colorado Territory and were mounted as a home guard under the command of Colonel [[John Chivington]]. Chivington and Colorado territorial governor [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]] adopted a hard line against Indians.<ref name="hoig2-63">Hoig 1980, p. 63.</ref> Continuing escalation led to the [[Colorado War]] of 1864-1865. On November 29, 1864, troops under Chivington attacked a peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho camp at Sand Creek on the reserve established for them under the Treaty of Fort Wise. This event became known as the [[Sand Creek Massacre]].
