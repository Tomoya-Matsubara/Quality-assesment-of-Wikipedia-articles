The '''Frisii''' were an ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] living in the low-lying region between the [[Zuiderzee]] and the [[Ems (river)|River Ems]]. In the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] pre-[[Migration Period]] (ie, before c. 300 AD) the Frisii and the related [[Chauci]], Saxons, and [[Angles]] inhabited the [[European Continent|Continental]] European coast from the [[Zuiderzee|Zuyder Zee]] to south [[Jutland]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|pp=14}}, ''Dark Age Naval Power''. Haywood uses the term 'North German' to distinguish them from the 'Rhine Germans' (the Caninnefates, Batavians, and "Frankish" tribes).</ref> All of these peoples shared a common material culture, and so cannot be defined archaeologically.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|pp=17-19}}, ''Dark Age Naval Power''. Haywood cites Todd's ''The Northern Barbarians 100 BC&ndash;AD 300'' (1987) for this conclusion.</ref>

The Frisii were bordered on the south by Germans who would later coalesce into the [[Franks|Frankish confederation]] in the 3rd century. On the east they were bordered by the [[Ampsivarii]] who lived at the mouth of the Ems until AD 58,<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=253-254}}, ''The Annals'', Bk XIII, Ch 55. Events of AD 54&ndash;58. The Germans under [[Arminius]] had wiped out 3 Roman legions under [[Varus]] at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in AD 9. The Ampsivarii had not supported the German cause and were ostracized as a result. Many years later, c. AD 58, the Chauci took the opportunity to expel them and occupy their land at the mouth of the [[Ems (river)|River Ems]].</ref><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|pp=17-19}}, ''Dark Age Naval Power''. Haywood cites Tacitus as well as a number of other sources.</ref> at which time the Chauci expelled them and gained a border with the Frisii.

The Chauci and other tribes to the east would merge to form the [[Saxons]] in the 3rd century. Some or all of the Frisii may have joined in either or both of these confederations, but they would retain a separate identity in Roman eyes until at least 296, when they were forcibly resettled as ''[[laeti]]''&nbsp;<ref>{{Citation

The lands of the Frisii would be abandoned by c. 400 due to flooding caused by a [[marine transgression]] and laid empty for a century, when changing environmental conditions again made the region habitable. At that time settlers would repopulate the region and come to be known as '[[Frisians]]'. Medieval and later accounts of 'Frisians' refer to these 'new Frisians' rather than to the ancient Frisii.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Bazelmans|2009|pp=321-337}}, ''The case of the Frisians''.</ref>

==Description==
What little is known of the Frisii is provided by a few Roman accounts, most of them military. [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD 23&ndash;79) said their lands were forest-covered with tall trees growing up to the edge of the lakes.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pliny the Elder|79_3|pp=340-341}}, ''Natural History'', Bk XVI Ch 2: Wonders connected with trees in the northern regions.</ref>
They lived by agriculture<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=253}}, ''The Annals'', Bk XIII, Ch 54. Events of AD 54&ndash;58. This was confirmed by Tacitus when he said that in an incident where the Frisii had taken over land, they then settled into houses, sowed the fields, and cultivated the soil.</ref> and raising cattle.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=147-148}}, ''The Annals'', Bk IV, Ch 72&ndash;74. Events of AD 15&ndash;16. Tacitus specifically refers to the herds of the Frisii.</ref> In the late 1st century the Romans referred to the 'Greater Frisii' as living to the east of the [[Zuiderzee]], and the 'Lesser Frisii' to the west of it, so-called for their proportional power, and with the settlements of both stretching along the border of the Rhine to the ocean.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|98|pp=61-62}}, ''The Germany'', XXXV.</ref>

In his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' [[Tacitus]] would describe all the Germanic peoples of the region as having elected kings with limited powers and influential military leaders who led by example rather than by authority. The people lived in spread-out settlements.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|98|pp=18-19, 23-24, 36-37}}, ''The Germany'', Ch V, VII, XVI.</ref> He specifically noted the weakness of Germanic political hierarchies in reference to the Frisii, when he mentioned the names of two kings of the 1st century Frisii and added that they were kings "as far as the Germans are under kings".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=253}}, ''The Annals'', Bk XIII, Ch 54. Events of AD 54&ndash;58.</ref>

Early Roman accounts of war and raiding do not mention the Frisii as participants, though the neighboring [[Cananefates|Canninefates]] (to the west and southwest) and [[Chauci]] (to the east) are named in that regard. The earliest mention of the Frisii tells of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]]' 12 BC war against the Rhine Germans and the Chauci. The Romans did not attack them after devastating the lands of the Rhine Germans, but merely passed through their territory and along their coast in order to attack the Chauci. The account says that the Frisii were "won over", suggesting a Roman [[suzerainty]] was imposed.<ref>{{Citation

Over the course of time the Frisii would provide Roman auxiliaries through treaty obligations, but the tribe would also appear in its own right in concert with other Germanic tribes, opposing the Romans. Accounts of wars therefore mention the Frisii on both sides of the conflict, though the actions of troops under treaty obligation were separate from the policies of the tribe.

==Wars with the Romans==
The Frisii were little more than occasional and incidental players in Roman accounts of history, which focus on Roman actions that were of interest to Roman readers. Consequently, references to them are disjoint and offer little useful information about them.

When Drusus brought Roman forces through Frisii lands in 12 BC and "won them over", he placed a moderate tax on them. However, a later Roman governor raised the requirements and exacted payment, at first decimating the herds of the Frisii, then confiscating their land, and finally taking wives and children into bondage. By AD 29 the Frisii had had enough. They hanged the Roman soldiers collecting the tax and forced the governor to flee to a Roman fort, which they then besieged. The [[Promagistrate|propraetor]] of [[Germania Inferior|Lower Germany]], [[Lucius Apronius]], raised the siege and attacked the Frisii, but was beaten back after suffering heavy losses. For whatever reason, the Romans did not seek revenge and the matter was closed. The prestige of the Frisii among the neighboring Germanic tribes was raised considerably.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=147-148}}, ''The Annals'', Bk IV, Ch 72&ndash;74. Events of AD 15&ndash;16.</ref>

After their experiences with the predatory Roman governor and Lucius Apronius, the Frisii became disaffected towards Rome. In AD 47 the Frisii along with the Chauci were led by a certain Gannascus of the [[Cananefates|Canninefates]]. They raided along the then-wealthy coast of [[Gallia Belgica]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=189}}, ''The Annals'', Bk XI, Ch 18&ndash;19. Events of AD 47&ndash;48.</ref> The Roman military commander, [[ Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo|Corbulo]], campaigned successfully against the Germanic tribes,<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=400}}, ''The Annals'', Bk XVI, Ch 17. Events of 65&ndash;66 (Rome and Parthia&mdash;Campaigns of Corbulo in the East). Tacitus makes the parenthetical comment that Corbulo had driven the Chauci out of the provinces of Lower Germany which they had invaded in AD 47.</ref> For the and for the Frisii this meant Roman occupation, with the Romans specifying where they must live, with a fort built among them, and forcing a Roman-style senate, magistrates, and constitution upon them.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=189-190}}, ''The Annals'', Bk XI, Ch 18&ndash;19. Events of AD 47&ndash;48.</ref>

The Frisii are next mentioned in 54, when they occupied empty, Roman-controlled land near the [[Rhine]], settling into houses and sowing and plowing fields. The Romans attempted to persuade them to leave, and even invited two Frisii kings to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] to meet [[Nero]], who ordered them to leave. The Frisii refused, whereby a Roman military force coerced them, killing any who resisted.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=253}}, ''The Annals'', Bk XIII, Ch 55. Events of AD 54&ndash;58.</ref>

In AD 69 the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]] and other tribes rose against Roman rule in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]], becoming a general uprising by all the Germans in the region, including the Frisii. Things went well for the Germans at first. One of the early leaders, Brinno of the [[Cananefates|Canninefates]] tribe, quickly defeated a Roman force of 2 cohorts and took their camp.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|105|pp=115}}, ''The Histories'', Bk IV, Ch 14&ndash;15: Revolt of Civilis and the Batavi.</ref> The capable [[Gaius Julius Civilis|Civilis]] ultimately succeeded to leadership of the Germanic side and inflicted huge casualties on the Romans, even besieging Roman strongholds such as Vetera.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|105|pp=126}}, ''The Histories'', Bk IV, Ch 23: The Siege of Vetera.</ref> On the sea, a Roman flotilla was captured by a Germanic one.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|pp=22-23}}, ''Dark Age Naval Power''.</ref> However, the war would not end well for the Germans. Led by [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis |Cerialis]], the Romans ultimately gave as good as they had gotten, forcing a humiliating peace on the Batavi and stationing a legion on their territory.

In the course of the war, both the Frisii and the Chauci had auxiliaries serving under the Romans, and in a siege and assault by Civilis at ''Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis'' (at modern [[Cologne]]), a [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] of Chauci and Frisii had been trapped and burned.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|105|pp=7}}, ''The Histories'', Translator's Summary of Chief Events.</ref><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|105|pp=193}}, ''The Histories'', Bk IV, Ch 79.</ref>

==Final demise of the ancient Frisii==
The emperor [[Constantius Chlorus]] had campaigned successfully against several Germanic peoples during the internecine civil wars that had brought him to sole power over the [[Roman Empire]]. Among them were the Frisii and [[Chamavi]], who were described in the ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' (Manuscript VIII) as being forced to resettle within Roman territory as ''[[laeti]]'' (ie, Roman-era [[serf]]s) in c. 296.<ref>{{Citation

If there were any Frisii left in Frisia, they would fall victim to the whims of nature. After several hundred years of favorable conditions, the environment in all of the low-lying coastal regions of northwestern Europe began to deteriorate c. 250 AD and gradually worsened over the next 200 years. Tectonic [[subsidence]], a rising [[water table]] and [[storm surge]]s combined to flood some areas. The situation was aggravated by a shift to a cooler, wetter climate in the region.<ref>{{Citation

In the 3rd and 4th centuries the population of Frisia steadily decreased, and by the 5th century the population had dropped dramatically. The coastal lands would remain largely unpopulated for the next two centuries. When conditions improved Frisia would receive an influx of new settlers, mostly [[Saxons]], and these would eventually be referred to as 'Frisians', though they were not necessarily descended from the ancient Frisii. It is these 'new Frisians' who are largely the ancestors of the medieval and modern [[Frisians]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Bazelmans|2009|pp=321-337}}, ''The case of the Frisians''.</ref>

===The Frisiavones===
The [[Frisiavones]] (or Frisiabones) are mentioned in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (AD 79). They are listed as a people of the islands in and near the [[Rhine]] River, as are the Frisii.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pliny the Elder|79_1|pp=349}}, ''Natural History'', Bk IV.Ch 29(.15)&mdash;Ninety-six islands of the Gallic ocean.</ref> They also appear as a people of northern Gaul in the chapter on [[Gallia Belgica]],<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pliny the Elder|79_1|pp=354}}, ''Natural History'', Bk IV.Ch 31(.17)&mdash;Gallia Belgica.</ref> their name given between those of the Sunici and Betasi (not to be confused the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]).
[[File:Frisiavones.inscription.Melandra.Castle.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The inscription stone found at Melandra Castle ]]
Tangible evidence of the existence of the Frisavones includes several inscriptions found in Britian, from [[Mamucium|Roman Manchester]] and from [[Ardotalia|Melandra Castle]] near modern [[Glossop]] in [[Derbyshire]]. The Melandra Castle inscription reads "CHO. T. FRISIAVO C. VAL VITALIS", which may be expanded to become "''Cohortis Primae Frisiauonum Centurio Valerius Vitalis''", which may be translated as "''Valerius Vitalis, Centurion of the First Cohort of the Frisiavones''".<ref>{{Citation

Suggestions that the Frisiavones were actually the Frisii center on the similarity in names, combined with the Roman classification of 'Lesser Frisii' to the west of the [[Zuiderzee]] and 'Greater Frisii' to the east of it<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|98|pp=61-62}}, ''The Germany'', XXXV.</ref> (which provides a reason as to why the Frisii might have been known by two different names). However, Pliny's placement of the Frisiavones in northern Gaul is not near the known location of the Frisii, which is acceptable if the Frisavones are a separate people, but not if they are a part of a greater Frisian tribe.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Schmitz|pp=916}}, ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=kIsUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA916 FRISIABONES].</ref>

[[Theodor Mommsen]] (''The Provinces of the Roman Empire from Caesar to Diocletian'', 1885) believed that the Germanic tribes of the region consisted of two parts, one having come under Roman influence and the other having remained outside of Roman influence, and he concluded that the Frisiavones were the same people as the Frisii. However, his reasoning parsed the accounts of Tacitus and Pliny selectively: he interpreted the 'Lesser Frisii' and 'Greater Frisii' of Tacitus to refer to the Roman-influenced Frisavones and the non-Roman-influenced Frisii; he considered Pliny's account that mentioned both the Frisiavones and the Frisii to be consistent with the model; and he rejected Pliny's account placing the Frisiavones in northern Gaul, saying that it "is beyond doubt incorrect".<ref>{{Citation

==Early medieval 'Frisian' references==
The ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' in c. 297 is the last mention of the Frisii by that name. There is no mention of them by any other name for nearly 3 centuries, when the name re-emerges as 'Frisians'. These later references are all connected to the ascendancy of the [[Franks]] under the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]], who referred to the people who had resettled the lands of the ancient Frisii as 'Frisians'.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Bazelmans|2009|pp=328}}, ''The case of the Frisians''.</ref> The interpretation of these references to 'Frisians' as references to the ancient Frisii has occasionally been made.

[[Venantius Fortunatus]] was a poet to the Frankish Merovingian court and wrote a eulogy to the Merovingian king [[Chilperic I|Chilperic]], who had died in 584. A list of peoples who were said to fear Chilperic's power is given and includes the Frisians, as well as the Suebi, Goths, Basques, Danes, Jutes, Saxons, and Britons. The eulogies of this age were intended to praise the high status of the subject, and the sudden reappearance of a list of old tribal names fitted into [[poetic meter]]s is given little historical value.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Bazelmans|2009|pp=329}}, ''The case of the Frisians''.</ref> The context is poetic license rather than historical accuracy.

Coins with the obverse and reverse inscriptions 'AVDVLFVS FRISIA' and 'VICTVRIA AVDVLFO', as well as 'FRISIA' and 'AVDVLFVS' have been found at [[Escharen]], a village in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[North Brabant]]. The stylistic quality suggests that they are of Northern Frankish origin of that era rather than Frisian, besides which a local production using a self-descriptive country name (ie, 'FRISIA') would be unheard of in that era.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Bazelmans|2009|pp=330}}, ''The case of the Frisians''.</ref>

==Other medieval 'Frisian' references==
Frisia appears in the [[Old English language|Old English]] [[heroic poetry|heroic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'', which tells a story of events of the early 6th century. In it the [[King of the Geats|Geatish king]] [[Hygelac]] is killed while raiding Frisia. It has been noted that [[Gregory of Tours]] (c. 538&ndash;594) mentioned a Danish king Chlochilaichus who was killed while invading Frankish territory in the early 6th century, suggesting that in this instance, Beowulf might have a basis in historical facts. However, Gregory was writing little more than fifty years after the events and may have based his story on eyewitness accounts, yet he makes no mention of Frisia or the Frisians. The poem is not considered a rich source of historical facts by Beowulf scholars.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Bazelmans|2009|pp=331-332}}, ''The case of the Frisians''.</ref>

The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' gives a list of 33 ancient cities of Britain, among them 'Cair Peris', its location unspecified. It also contains a reference to the [[Picts]] and [[Orkney]] and a place 'ultra mare Frenessicum'.<ref>{{Citation

}}.</ref>  The 'Cair' in 'Cair Peris' is reasonably taken to be [[Welsh language|Welsh]] 'Caer' (fort), while 'Peris' is a matter of speculation and conjecture, including the supposition that it is a reference to 'Frisians'. In the context of the ''Historia'', the 'mare Frenessicum' coincides nicely with the [[Firth of Forth]]. While the ''Historia'' is often useful to scholars, it is also the source of storyline details that have no discernible provenance. It was written more than 500 years after the last unambiguous reference to the ancient Frisii (the ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' in c. 297), and at a time when medieval Frisia and the Frisians were playing a dominant role in North Sea trade.
