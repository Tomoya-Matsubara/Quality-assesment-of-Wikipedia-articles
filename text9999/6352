{{WoD vampire}}'''The Masquerade''' is a [[fictional]] term found in [[White Wolf Game Studio]]'s ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' [[book]]s and [[role-playing game]]s.

A [[masquerade]] is a facade, intended to deceive and conceal. The [[vampire (World of Darkness)|vampiric]] Masquerade is a shared conspiracy of the [[Camarilla (World of Darkness)|Camarilla]] (the largest grouping of vampire [[Sect (World of Darkness)|sects]]) to keep their existence unknown to mortal human beings.

The Masquerade began in the [[15th century]] as a response to the [[Inquisition]]. Even though there was an ancient tradition of self-concealing among vampires in the [[Dark Ages]], in many cases common people knew or suspected their existence and their works (for example, the [[Tzimisce]] had vast dominions in [[Eastern Europe]] and many human serfs that were aware of the nature of their masters). In any case, most people [[superstition|superstitiously]] believed in many [[supernatural]] entities including vampires.

However, as the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] became more and more powerful, the Inquisition chased and destroyed many vampires, until they became convinced that the only way to survive would be to deny their own existence.

The Masquerade was taught as law in the [[Camarilla (World of Darkness)|Camarilla]] from then on, and took advantage of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], by reinforcing the idea that vampires are a fruit of ignorance and superstition. By the [[19th century]], most educated people in the West laughed at the suggestion that the vampires of old legends were real creatures.

In the timeframe of ''Vampire: The Masquerade'' (end of the [[20th century]] and beginning of the [[21st century|21st]]), the human [[non-player character]]s that might run across vampires performing typically vampiric acts will usually disbelieve their own eyes. The Masquerade requires that humans who know about vampires be promptly killed or otherwise rendered unable to spread the news. It also means that a vampire that breaks the Masquerade will have to fix it or face severe punishment.

==Anarchs==
{{redirect|Anarch|the head of an anarchy|Anarch (sovereign individual)}}
{{otheruses4|[[Vampire: The Masquerade]] role playing game|Vampire: The Eternal Struggle expansion|Anarchs (VTES)}}

The '''Anarchs''' are a fictional [[sect (World of Darkness)|sect]] of [[vampire (World of Darkness)|vampire]]s in [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf Game Studio's]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' [[role-playing game]]. Although they are technically members of the [[Camarilla (World of Darkness)|Camarilla]], they reject the Camarilla's top down power structure, and aim to change it into the grand protector of kindred it claims to be. The name refers to the misconception that they support creating [[anarchy]] instead of [[social order|order]]. This misconception is encouraged by the vampire elders, who hold most of the power in the game world.

In the revised rulebook; the Anarchs, the Sabbat, & the Camarilla are listed as the three main sects that Clans belong to.

=== Membership ===
The membership of the Anarchs is wide and varied, but the majority of its members are drawn from the clans of the Camarilla and the [[Sabbat (World of Darkness)|Sabbat]]. Whilst it is possible for members of independent [[Clan (World of Darkness)|Clan]]s or [[Bloodline (World of Darkness)|Bloodline]]s to join, they are less frequently counted amongst the Anarchs numbers.

=== Formation ===
During the [[14th Century]] there was a gulf in power between the Elder European vampires and their childer, who were often seen as disposable pawns by their progenitors; this was displayed during the [[Inquisition]] when many Elders left, or  sacrificed their childer to the flames in an attempt to escape such a fate themselves. Tensions increased until the [[15th century]] when an attack on the [[Ventrue]] Elder Hardestadt by the [[Brujah]] Tyler ignited a pan-European conflict known as the '''Anarch Revolt'''. This continued for over a century, the [[Lasombra]] Antediluvian itself falling to its fury. The revolt ended in 1493, when the newly formed Camarilla offered an olive branch to the hard-pressed Anarch movement, suggesting that they join and they would be then protected from the majority of reprisals to their actions. The Anarch leaders readily agreed to this, and a great deal of Anarchs joined the fledgling sect; however many Anarchs, particularly those of the [[Lasombra]] or [[Tzimisce]] clans refused to join, heading off on their own, later to become the Sabbat.

=== Organization ===
The Anarchs are often organised into [[gangs]] with no greater structure than that. However some areas are moderated by a '''Baron''', roughly the equivalent to a '''Prince''' of the Camarilla, only with less power and a more precarious position. The more coherent Anarch societies also find places for undervalued and unappreciated 'officers' such as '''Emissaries''' and '''Sweepers'''.

=== Philosophies ===
The Anarchs have a multitude of philosophies within their ranks, ranging from poorly thought out violent rages against the Camarilla, attempts to change it subtly or democratically, to those who when offered a sniff of power return faithfully to its ivory tower.

==Antitribu==

In [[White Wolf Game Studio]]'s [[role-playing game]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'', most [[vampire]] [[Clan (World of Darkness)|clan]]s belong to a sect, either the [[Camarilla (World of Darkness)|Camarilla]] or [[Sabbat (World of Darkness)|Sabbat]] (some vampires and clans are independent). Vampires who belong to a sect other than that of their parent clan are generally called '''''antitribu''''', though this term is occasionally reserved specifically for offshoot [[bloodline (World of Darkness)|bloodlines]] belonging to a different sect than their parent clan.

For example, a [[Lasombra]] who joins the Camarilla would be referred to as a Lasombra ''antitribu'', as his parent clan claims allegiance to the Sabbat (however, no Lasombra uses the term for their own clan). Likewise, a [[Brujah]] in the Sabbat would be considered a Brujah ''antitribu''. However, there are certain offshoot bloodlines of Brujah, specifically [[True Brujah]], that claim allegiance to another sect without being considered ''antitribu''.

Members of independent clans who join one of the sects are treated differently with regards to diplomatic status and title. Independent vampires who live in or commute regularly to Camarilla territory do not have special names. Others, who break away from their parent clans, especially those that choose to side with the Sabbat, could be considered ''antitribu''.

The [[Assamite]]s and [[Setites]] both have divergent bloodlines affiliated with the Sabbat, who could be called ''antitribu'' (though the Setites more often go by the name "Serpents of the Light"). Members of the [[Ravnos]] clan allied with the Sabbat are also often called ''antitribu'', though they are not a separate bloodline.

A large portion of the [[Assamite]] clan (from several bloodlines) has also broken away from their parent clan and permanently sworn allegiance to the Camarilla. Rather than being called ''antitribu'', however, they are called ''schismatics'', named for the [[schism]] between them and their home in Alamut.  Others have fled to the Sabbat, to join their ''antitribu'' brethren.

Recently a group of [[Salubri]] have joined the Sabbat, claiming ''antitribu'' status and expressing a hatred of the Camarilla, especially the [[Tremere]], who they claim destroyed their [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antediluvians_%28World_of_Darkness%29 Antediluvian].  These Salubri ''antitribu'' exhibit powers of combat, once attributed to the extinct warrior Salubri.


==Autarkis==
Autarkis is a [[fictional]] term found in [[White Wolf Game Studio]]'s ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' [[book]]s and [[role-playing game]]s.  It is used to describe vampires who turn their back on the Jyhad, refusing to serve a sect, [[Camarilla (World of Darkness)|Camarilla]] or [[Sabbat (World of Darkness)|Sabbat]], or associate with their [[Clan (World of Darkness)|Clan]].

==Black Hand==
The '''Black Hand''' are a fictional sect of [[vampire|vampires]], composed of several [[clan (World of Darkness)|clans]] and [[bloodline (World of Darkness)|bloodlines]], from [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf Game Studio's]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' books and [[role-playing game|role-playing games]]. The name comes from their symbol, an inverted black hand print.  The sect is often confused with the [[Sabbat (World of Darkness)|Sabbat]] itself and another mysterious sect, the [[Tal'mahe'Ra]]. 

In essence, the Black Hand is a sect within a sect, made up of the most dedicated and capable Sabbat members.  Part paramilitary, part religion, part survivalist militia, these vampires wholeheartedly believe that [[Gehenna (World of Darkness)|Gehenna]] is coming.  They do all they can to prepare for the rise of the [[Antediluvians (World of Darkness)|Antediluvians ]].

==Blood hunt==
In [[White Wolf Game Studio]]'s ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' [[book]]s and [[role-playing game]]s, a '''blood hunt''' is the persecution of a [[vampire]] by the rest of the vampiric society in order to kill him. Another name to a blood hunt is the word ''Amaranth'', in reference to the flower. In the past, an Amaranth flower was given to a vampire who will be killed a week before the hunt began as a warning.

The blood hunt must be officially declared by the local prince. Once the order is given, it is customary to allow the vampire to flee the city. This mercy is extended until midnight, after which any vampire is free to hunt down and destroy the persecuted subject. On occasion, a reward might be offered to the one who delivers or kills the victim.

Any vampire who helps the subject of a blood hunt in any way is considered an accomplice and may himself become an additional target.

In some cases it is traditional to let the victim's [[Sire (vampire)|sire]], who is then allowed to perform [[diablerie]] on his [[childe (vampire)|childe]], perform the execution.

==Caitiff==
Caitiff are a fictional group of clanless [[vampire (World of Darkness)|vampires]] in ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'', a [[role-playing game]] by [[White Wolf, Inc.]]

Lacking patrons or allies, holding no real power as a group, Caitiff are held in contempt by the [[Camarilla (World of Darkness)|Camarilla]]. The [[Sabbat (White Wolf)|Sabbat]]'s Caitiff are treated as a [[Clan (World of Darkness)|clan]]; known as [[Pander (World of Darkness)|Pander]], a title whose namesake is a politically powerful and clanless vampire Joseph Pander, they find direction through the Sabbat.

Since they are clanless, they do not specialize in any particular discipline, but have the freedom to learn any discipline or develop their own. However, finding a mentor for such a pursuit can be difficult.

Clanlessness can stem from many circumstances - the sire rejected the individual, the embrace went wrong, their blood is too thin to develop the peculiar characteristics of the sire's clan, or the sire was also a caitiff.

Some take great pride in lacking a clan, claiming to be descended directly from Caine. Since Caine was the first vampire, he lacked the flaws of his descendants who founded various clans and bloodlines. Caitiff tend to be thin-blooded; far removed from [[Caine (World of Darkness)|Caine]], 13th generation or worse, they can be viewed as omens of [[Gehenna (World of Darkness)|Gehenna]]. Most clans tolerate the Caitiff, as long as they maintain the [[Masquerade (World of Darkness)|Masquerade]], honor the traditions, and stay out of politics.
Still, there are exceptions to this rule; Muktar Bey, the Caitiff Prince of [[Cairo]], has ruled for over 500 years.

Passages of the [[Book of Nod]] allude to the [[Time of Thin Blood]], when the clanless will come to rule.  The increasing number of Caitiff and their strange powers and insights into the [[Jyhad]] has many elders worried.

==Camarilla==
The Camarilla is a [[fiction]]al [[sect (World of Darkness)|sect]] of [[Vampire (World of Darkness)|vampire]]s in the [[World of Darkness]], the setting of [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf]]'s [[role-playing game]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]''. The Camarilla are composed of seven [[clan (World of Darkness)|clan]]s, and are the largest organization of vampires, and possibly of any supernatural creatures, in the World of Darkness. The [[symbol]] of the Camarilla is an [[ankh]] hanging from a [[necklace]].

===Core Clans===
* [[Brujah]]
* [[Malkavian]]
* [[Nosferatu (World of Darkness)|Nosferatu]]
* [[Toreador (World of Darkness)|Toreador]]
* [[Tremere]]
* [[Ventrue]]
* [[Gangrel (World of Darkness)|Gangrel]] (until [[1999]])

===Foundation===
The Camarilla was founded during the [[15th century]] (the first meeting cited was in [[1450]]) in response to the [[Inquisition]] and the Anarch Revolt. Largely, it was formed by the desperation of the vampire elders of its seven main clans as a means to marshal their powers into a united front and beat back the [[Anarchs (World of Darkness)|Anarchs]]. This it managed to do after forty years of fighting, and the Anarch Revolt was officially ended at the Convention of Thorns in [[1493]]. Nevertheless, some Anarchs refused to give up peacefully, and created the sect known as the [[Sabbat (World of Darkness)|Sabbat]], with which the Camarilla is still at war.

In the modern setting of ''Vampire: The Masquerade'', the [[organization]] is [[headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The Camarilla is composed of seven main Clans, though the Camarilla considers that all vampires are, subject to their laws and rules, regardless of whether they want to be or not. The core group of seven clans dropped to six when the Gangrel officially became independent in 1999. Other bloodlines often affiliated include the [[Daughters of Cacophony]], the [[Lasombra]] ''[[antitribu]]'', and the Samedi.

Recently, a second, smaller Anarch Revolt has started. This new Anarch faction has taken power on much of the West Coast of the United States.

The third edition of the game has a different clan composition and puts more emphasis on political diversity within the Camarilla, and gives hints as to the eventual dissolution of the Camarilla, which is not yet considered archaic and exists even to the declared end of the ''Vampire: The Masquerade'' line of products by White Wolf.  The third edition is not fundamentally different from the other editions, but does include more that was once published extraneously to the earlier rulebooks in associated game products.

===Philosophy===
Camarilla policy is that vampires should try to fit in with and hide from the rest of [[human race|humanity]], as to easily feed on them. For this reason, they created a web of lies and misinformation, called the [[Masquerade (World of Darkness)|Masquerade]], to make the public believe that supernatural beings like vampires could not possibly exist.

The Camarilla also believes that the only way the vampire species can survive in these modern nights is if it unites - any breach of the Masquerade by any vampire risks exposing the entire race. Both viewpoints are fundamentally opposed by the Sabbat.

The Camarilla also enforces the Eldest as ruling class over the younger vampires. When in the Dark Ages one Elder claimed land as his and all other vampires had to obey his ruling if traveling his lands. In modern nights the Camarilla still holds to this tradition. The ruling Elder of a so called domain, usually a human metropolitan and surrounding areas, is called the Prince. His rule is essentially that of an autocrat-all power, executive, legislative, and judicial, rests with the Prince. The six fundamental rules of the Camarilla grant the Prince the right to destroy other vampires, grant or deny the right to hospitality and allow him to decide whether or not a vampire is allowed to create offspring.
Besides the Prince usually the oldest Member of each of the Clans holds a fair amount of power and the title [[Primogen]]. The Council of the Primogen usually advices the Prince, but since in modern nights many vampires live in one domain, sometimes a primogen or even more, hold a power similar or even surpassing the power of the Prince.

While the Camarilla is indeed ruled by the old and enforces their right to rule, the sect still maintains the impression, that it is the one, true organisation for all vampires. Whenever there is a greater social tension in an area, the Camarilla might send an one of its enforcers, the Justicars, along with his servants, the Archons, to the scene. There is one such Justicar from each Clan appointed for a 13year term. During meetings, called Conclaves, every vampire, even the young, may speak if they have two advocates. While this creates the impression that the Camarilla officials have an open ear for anyone, the Justicars usually have the obligation to keep a solid 'status quo'. So, before and during Conclaves many boons are made and collected to gain as many influential advocates as possible, so that the Justicar is convinced that one is the best govern the domain.

====Views on Antediluvians====
The official stance of the Camarilla on the matter of the [[Antediluvians (World of Darkness)|Antediluvians]], and [[Gehenna (World of Darkness)|Gehenna]], is that it is nothing more than superstition. They say that the Antediluvians do not exist. This is in stark contrast to the Sabbat, who claim that Gehenna is approaching and that all vampires must prepare for it by readying to fight the Antediluvians.

After the Week of Nightmares, in which the [[Ravnos]] Antediluvian woke, certain upper echelon members of the Camarilla came to realise that Gehenna was an imminent possibility; however, the Camarilla's official stance did not change. This was especially notable when the Camarilla refused to lend aid to the Justicar Xaviar when he encountered what he believed was an Antediluvian, after which he led the [[Gangrel (World of Darkness)|Gangrel]] clan out of the Camarilla.

===Vampire: The Requiem===
In ''[[Vampire: The Requiem]]'', White Wolf's Vampire game in the new [[World of Darkness]] setting, the sects have been replaced by smaller "[[Covenant (World of Darkness)|covenants]]". However, the Camarilla is occasionally referred to as a society of long ago that united all vampires, before it fractured into the covenants. Likely this was a subtle statement by the game designers that, though they have moved on, they have not forgotten their old game line.

More specifically, the ''Requiem'' history states that the Camarilla existed during the Roman empire, endorsing the idea of vampires rising to public dominion of the human world. The Masquerade is stated to have emerged after the collapse of the Camarilla due to an uprising of Anarchs.

The Camarilla was divided into four wings: the Senex, the Legio Mortuum, the Cult of Augurs and the Peregrine Collegia. The Senex were the leaders and patricians, the Legio Mortuum were the military wing, the Cult of the Augurs were the religious wing and the Peregrine Collegia were the commoners.

==Clans==
{{Main|Clans in Vampire: The Masquerade}}
In [[White Wolf Game Studio]]'s [[role-playing game]] [[Vampire: the Masquerade]], a '''clan''' (often spelled '''Clan''', with capitalization) is a group of vampires "related" by blood; i.e. the vampiric equivalent of an [[extended family]] or [[lineage]]. A clan is usually a large group, acknowledged widely in the vampiric society, and not a small offshoot (which is called a [[bloodline (World of Darkness)|bloodline]]).

It is assumed that each clan descended from a single progenitor (called [[Antediluvians (World of Darkness)|Antediluvian]]s in ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Vampire: The Dark Ages]]'', who passed to each of his descendants, or [[childe (World of Darkness)|childer]], his unique gifts and flaws. However, in the original World of Darkness, it is also assumed that each of these Antediluvians came from a common source: commonly accepted to be [[Caine (World of Darkness)|Caine]], the first murderer.

The [[Book of Nod]] names certain clans as the original thirteen; the Kingship Clan (Ventrue), the Clan of the Beast (Gangrel), the Moon Clan (Malkavian), the Clan of the Hidden (Nosferatu), the Wanderer Clan (Ravnos), the Clan of the Rose (Toreador), the Night Clan (Lasombra), the Clan of Shapers (Tzimisce), the Snake Clan (Setites), the Clan of Death (Cappadocians), the Healer's Clan (Salubri), the Clan of the Hunt (Assamites) and the Learned Clan (Brujah).  Other fragments have alluded to the possibility of there being other clans who did not survive into the final nights.

Each clan within a domain will send a representative, called a [[Primogen]], who is usually the eldest and most powerful member of the clan, to attend the prince's advisory council.

==Inconnu==
The '''Inconnu ''' is a [[fiction]]al [[sect (World of Darkness)|sect]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Shapers|author=Ann Lee|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FbsMKh-P_agC|year=2003|isbn=0954317114}}</ref> of [[Vampire (World of Darkness)|vampire]]s in the [[World of Darkness]], the setting of [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf]]'s [[role-playing game]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]''.
Supposedly the oldest known sect, the origin, goals and even very existence of the sect are largely unknown to the supernatural population at large. The inconnu has been linked variously to Infernalism, [[Golconda]], [[Salubri|Saulot]] and a host of other conspiracies.  Several cities in the World of Darkness have Inconnu [[Monitor (World of Darkness)|monitors]], mysterious elder vampires who do little, other than watch the events of their chosen city.

The official storyline for V:TM ended before much was revealed regarding the Inconnu.  They were the last secret left unanswered.  The Inconnu were elders ([[Methuselah]]s) who wished to withdraw from Kindred politics (the [[Jyhad]])<ref>{{cite book|title=Realm X: Beyond our World|author=Latoya Webster|isbn=1411607864|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xiJNi4Et8HkC|year=2006|page=76}}</ref>, kindred seeking Golconda, and hunted clans and bloodlines like the [[Salubri]].

==Kindred of the East==
Kindred of the East is a [[role-playing game|role-playing]] supplement by [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf Game Studio]] to their ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' line.  The vanguard of White Wolf's "Year of the Lotus" theme (which created "Eastern" counterparts to all of their major product lines in the [[World of Darkness]]), this rich sourcebook is a stand-alone setting, requiring only secondary rules to be fully playable.  The setting spans [[Asia]], allowing players to play the so-called Kindred of the East, [[vampire]]s of [[Asia]].

Characters in Kindred of the East (or '''Kuei-jin''', as they call themselves) are [[vampire]]s as depicted in classical [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[India]]n [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Taoist]], [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]] [[mythology]].  Unlike the vampires traditionally associated with [[Dracula]] or [[Caine (World of Darkness)|Caine]], Kuei-jin were once mortals who died with the burden of unfulfilled [[Dharma]] or duties.  Tortured in [[Yomi]] for their inadequacies in life, their [[soul]]s successfully escaped and returned to their bodies.  Now half-alive and half-dead, Kuei-jin must live by stealing [[Qi|chi]] from mortal victims to sustain themselves while trying to fulfill their Dharma.  The most convenient form chi can be stolen in is blood, leading to their vampiric tendencies, but they cannot create new vampires. Practically all Kindred distrust the Kuei-jin. The Kuei-jin are also known to war with the other sects for territory.

Kuei-jin are beings torn by inner conflict, and the themes of the game relate to this heavily.  Unlike Western vampires, Kuei-jin are [[ghost|revenant]]s and thus spiritual beings in nature.

=== Yin vs. Yang ===
The classic opposition of [[Yin Yang|yin and yang]] are important to Kuei-jin not only for philosophical reasons, but because this dichotomy also delineates the two forms of chi they can potentially ingest. An  imbalance of yin or yang chi in their system can lead to dire consequences.  Yin-imbalanced Kuei-jin become corpselike [[zombie]]s suffering from a lack of [[emotion]]. At its worst, yin-imbalance reduces a kuei-jin to a [[Hopping corpse]]. Yang-imbalanced Kuei-jin suffer wild mood swings and impulsive lusts for food, sex, and other forms of stimulation. Possibly the strangest consequence of yang-imbalance is the ability to have or sire children. Such children are called [[Dhampir (World of Darkness)|dhampyr]]s, and are mortal half-vampires.

=== Hun vs. P'o ===
A Kuei-jin's stint in the hells of [[Yomi]] divides the mind into two parts:  The '''Hun''', or high mind, that is the seat of rational thought, and the '''P'o''', or demon mind, that exists to satisfy its own base urges (usually at the expense of the Hun).  As former [[Wraith: The Oblivion|wraiths]], a Kuei-jin has a splinter of the forces of Oblivion in its soul.  While many Kuei-jin see their P'o as a curse, it is important to note that without the P'o, they would never have escaped hell in the first place.  Furthermore, Kuei-jin who stifle and contain their P'o utterly become cold, calculating individuals who lack any ideological spark; such stagnancy can be devastating when the weight of karma (spiritual consequences of actions) is on one's shoulders.

=== Mortal vs. Spirit ===
The Kuei-jin stand between the mortal world (which they can never fully return to) and the spirit world (which they cannot fully embrace).  Many Kuei-jin struggle to find a balance between these two worlds that suits the precise nature of their Dharma.

=== Dharmas ===
A Kuei-jin's existence is a quest for enlightenment.  In their search for karmic resolution, different Kuei-jin follow different paths to ease their karmic discomfort.  The '''Dharmas''', five philosophies accepted by the greater Kuei-jin community as potential paths, each emphasize a particular aspect of Kuei-jin existence:

* '''The Howl of the Devil Tiger''': The Dharma embracing the P'o.
* '''The Way of the Resplendent Crane''': The Dharma embracing the Hun.
* '''The Song of the Shadow''': The Dharma embracing Yin.
* '''The Path of a Thousand Whispers''': The Dharma embracing balance.
* '''The Dance of the Thrashing Dragon''': The Dharma embracing Yang.

In addition to these primary dharmas, a number of '''Heretical Dharmas''' have also come into existence.  Not accepted in Kuei-jin society, these paths nevertheless find some followers:

* '''The Face of the Gods''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and P'o.
* '''The Flame of the Rising Phoenix''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and Yang.
* '''The Spirit of the Living Earth''': A Dharma embracing both Yin and Yang.
* '''The Tempest of Inner Focus''': A Dharma embracing balance.
* '''The Scorpion Eaters''': A Dharma embracing the P<U+00B4>o, whom can consume only Tainted Chi and yet are not Akuma. 

Finally, some Kuei-jin turn their backs on enlightenment entirely, instead swearing fealty to the '''Yama Kings''' (the rulers of Yomi) to become Akuma, the demon people.  Bartering their souls for power, Akuma enter [[Faustian]] deals with the Yama Kings and pursue only power.

=== The Middle Kingdom ===
Kuei-jin are the most visible '''shen''' (supernatural creatures) of the '''Middle Kingdom''' (modern [[Asia]]), but are not alone.  Unlike [[Vampire: The Masquerade|Western Kindred]], they have close ties with the spirit world.  They must also compete with the '''hengeyokai''' ([[Changing Breed|Shapeshifters]] of the East, as it were), [[Mage: The Ascension|mages]], and [[gaki]].

==Sabbat==
{{Main|Sabbat (World of Darkness)}}
The Sabbat (also known as Sword of Caine) are a fictional sect of vampires, composed of several clans and bloodlines, from White Wolf Game Studio's Vampire: The Masquerade books and role-playing games. Their symbol is an inverted, spiked ankh. Named in reference to the times of the Anarch revolt, when ravening groups of vampires were assumed to be witches sabbats.

==Tal'mahe'Ra==
The '''Tal'mahe'Ra''' are a [[fiction|fictional]] [[sect (World of Darkness)|sect]] of [[vampire]]s, composed of several [[clan (World of Darkness)|clans]] and [[bloodline (World of Darkness)|bloodlines]], from [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf Game Studio's]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' [[book]]s and [[role-playing game]]s. The sect is often confused with the [[Black Hand (World of Darkness)|Black Hand]]. 

The so called True Black Hand is very secretive and mysterious, with infiltrators in many other sects.  Dedicated to bringing about [[Gehenna (World of Darkness)|Gehenna]] and the return of the [[Antediluvians (World of Darkness)|Antediluvians]], these vampires hope to serve the ancients and gain positions as favoured servants.

The extent of Tal'mahe'Ra power and infiltration is debatable, due to the very nature of the sect.  In any case the question may be considered academic as the heart of the Tal'mahe'Ra was eviserated at the start of the [[Wraith: The Oblivion|Sixth Maelstrom]] in the shadowlands.  The surviving servants have 
quietly blended into the sects they once infiltrated.

The Clans composing this sect are the Old Clan [[Tzimisce]] who are on a neverending quest to eradicate the "evil entity Vicissitude," the [[True Brujah]] who wish to avenge their Antedeluvian Ilyes, who was diablerized by his childer Troile, who is the founder of the mainstream Brujah clain and finally the Nagaraja, necromancers who claim to have invented the Vaulderie long before the Tzimisce. The individual Clans are often scoffed at or shunned entirely, causing some to wonder if it was simply three freak bloodlines coming together in some pathetic attempt to validate themselves. 

The Shadow Crusade of the Sect, a campaign against Vicissitude which they claim to be some horrid parasitic entity contracted by the Tzimisce Methusulah Andeleon while in plane of reality known as the Deep Umber, came to a halt when their base of operations, the shadow realm answer to the classic Enoch, was destroyed. They chose that place not only for its historic value, but also because a group of four Methusulah hide within it, in Torpor. While their spirits are visible through Auspex, they are impossible to find. It is later realized that it was not Enoch, but the illusion created by at least one of the Torpid ancients to better mask his presence. In the end, the Shadow Crusade was crushed, as Vicissitude was revealed to be an active piece of the Tzimisce's Antedeluvian, their holy Enoch was nothing and the revenge of the True Brujah was denied. The surviving members skulked away into obscurity.

In [[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines]], the player has a chance to pick up a fabled blade of the Tal'mahe'Ra in the Hallowbrook Hotel.
