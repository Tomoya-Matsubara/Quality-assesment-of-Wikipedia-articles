'''Charles Duane "Charlie" Baker, Jr.''' (born November 13, 1956), is an [[United States|American]] businessman and politician from [[Massachusetts]]. He was a cabinet official under two Massachusetts governors, spent ten years as [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Harvard Pilgrim Health Care]], and was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate in the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 Massachusetts gubernatorial election]].

Raised in [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], [[Massachusetts]], Baker is the son of a Republican [[United States federal executive departments|executive]] official who worked under [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Richard Nixon]]. He graduated from [[Harvard College]] and obtained an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Kellogg School of Management]]. In 1991, he became Massachusetts Undersecretary of Health and Human Services under Governor [[William Weld]].  In 1992, he was appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services of Massachusetts. He later served as Secretary of Administration and Finance under Weld and his successor [[Paul Cellucci]].

After working in government for eight years, Baker left to become CEO of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates and later [[Harvard Pilgrim Health Care]], a non-profit health benefits company. During this time he served three years as a [[board of selectmen|selectman]] of [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]], Massachusetts, and considered a run for governor in 2006. He stepped down in July 2009 to run for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] on a platform of [[fiscal conservatism]] and [[social liberalism]]. He was unopposed in the Republican primary but lost in the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2010|general election]] to incumbent [[Deval Patrick]].

Baker's father was a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], his mother a [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and the family was often drawn into political arguments at the dinner table.<ref name="english" /> His father became vice president of Harbridge House, a [[Boston]] management consulting firm, in 1965. In 1969, the family moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where the elder Baker was named [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Deputy Under Secretary]] of the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] under President [[Richard Nixon]], and the next year became the department's Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs.<ref name="english" /><ref name="reagan" />

==State government career==
In the late 1980s, Baker was hired as codirector of the newly founded [[Pioneer Institute]], a Boston-based [[libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]]. [[Lovett C. Peters]], the institute's founder, later recommended him to [[William Weld]], the incoming [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Governor of Massachusetts]].<ref name="moskowitz" /> Weld took office in January 1991 and hired him as Undersecretary of Health and Human Services.

In cutting back state programs and social services, Baker caused controversy from early on. However, some government officials called him an "innovator" and "one of the big stars among the secretariats and the agencies".<ref name="phillips-1992" /> Baker was promoted to Secretary of Health and Human Services in November 1992,<ref name="phillips-1992" /> and was later made Secretary of Administration and Finance, a position he continued to hold after Weld resigned in 1997 and [[Paul Cellucci]] took over as acting governor. In mid-1998, Cellucci offered him the lieutenant governor spot on the [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], but Baker declined.<ref name="moskowitz" />

As Secretary of Administration and Finance, Baker was a main architect of the [[Big Dig]] financing plan. In 1997 the federal government was planning to cut funding for the Big Dig by $300 million per year.<ref name="rezendes-2010">Rezendes, Michael; Bierman, Noah (June 13, 2010). "[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/13/bakers_role_in_big_dig_financing_process_was_anything_but_small/ Baker's role in Big Dig financing process was anything but 'small']." ''The Boston Globe''. Retrieved September 17, 2010.</ref> The state set up a trust and sold [[GARVEE|Grant Anticipation Note]]s (GANs) to investors.

According to a 2007 [[blue-ribbon panel]], the cost overruns of the Big Dig, combined with Baker's plan for financing them, ultimately left the state transportation system underfunded by $1 billion a year.<ref name="rezendes-2010" /> Baker defended his plan as responsible, effective, and based on previous government officials' good-faith assurances that the Big Dig would be built on time and on budget.<ref name="rezendes-2010" /> However, as he was developing the plan, Baker had also had to take into account that Governor Cellucci was dead-set against any new taxes or fees.<ref name="rezendes-2010" /> Former State Transportation Secretary [[James J. Kerasiotes]], the public face of the Big Dig, praised Baker's work on the financing and said, <U+201C>We were caught in a confluence of events," adding that <U+201C>Charlie had a job to do, and he did his job and he did it well".<ref name="rezendes-2010" />

==Health industry career==
In September 1998, Baker left state government and became CEO of [[Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates]], a [[New England]]<U+2013>based physicians' group.<ref name="moskowitz" /> In May 1999, he was named president and CEO of Harvard Vanguard's parent company, [[Harvard Pilgrim Health Care]], a non-profit health benefits organization.<ref name="harris">Harris, Elizabeth (November 16, 1999).

''[[American Medical News]]'' '''43''' (3): p. 1.</ref> and was predicted to lose over $90 million in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Baker responded by  cutting the workforce by 90 people, increasing premiums, establishing new contracts with Massachusetts physicians, reassessing the company's financial structure, and [[outsourcing]] its information technology.<ref name="harris" /><ref name="gaudin">Gaudin, Sharon (December 18, 2000).

In mid-2007, Baker was invited to join the board of trustees of [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]]. Because of Baker's role in the insurance business, the appointment caused controversy, but he and the hospital's CEO, [[Paul F. Levy]], denied any [[conflict of interest]].<ref name="vesely">Vesely, Rebecca (December 17, 2007). "Insurer joins hospital board." ''[[Modern Healthcare]]'' '''37''' (50): p. 14.</ref> Baker also serves on the board of directors of the [[Kenneth B.

Schwartz Center homepage. Accessed September 27, 2010.</ref>
It is rumored that Baker will take Paul Levy's spot as President of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center upon Mr. Levy's resignation.

==Return to politics==
Baker ran for the [[board of selectmen]] of [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]], [[Massachusetts]], in 2004, and won by a "landslide".<ref name="moskowitz" /> While on the board, he was noted for a businessman-like approach to local issues; his fellow selectmen described him as "low key" and budget-oriented.<ref name="rosenberg">Rosenberg, Steven (July 14, 2009). "Baker left his mark as a selectman." ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' '''276''' (14): p. B1.</ref> After serving three years, he chose not to run for re-election in 2007.<ref name="laidler">Laidler, John (May 24, 2007). "13 new selectmen settle in for challenges." ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' '''271''' (144): p. B1.</ref>

In mid-2005, there were indications that Governor [[Mitt Romney]] would not seek re-election in the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election]]. Baker was widely considered a top contender to take Romney's place as the Republican candidate.<ref name="phillips-2005" /> Analysts wrote that Baker was unlikely to defeat Lieutenant Governor [[Kerry Healey]], who had already announced her candidacy. Healey was the 2<U+2013>1 favorite among Republican voters in a ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' poll and had much stronger financial backing. Furthermore, ethics guidelines at Harvard Pilgrim prevented Baker from carrying out any political fundraising while he held an executive position.<ref name="phillips-2005" /> After "giving serious consideration" to the idea, he announced in August 2005 that he would not run, citing the burden it would be on his family and the difficulty of campaigning against Healey.<ref name="phillips-2005">Phillips, Frank (August 30, 2005). "Baker picks family over campaign." ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' '''268''' (61): p. B1.</ref>

In late 2006, Baker was named to a Budget and Finance working group for incoming Governor [[Deval Patrick]]'s transition committee.<ref>Patrick<U+2013>Murray Transition Committee (November 22, 2006). "[http://web.archive.org/web/20070110152159/http://www.patrickmurraytransition.org/press/Transition_Groups112206.pdf Deval Patrick/Tim Murray announce transition working groups and members]."</ref> In 2008, he joined the Public Advisory Board of the [[New Hampshire Institute of Politics]] (NHIOP) at [[Saint Anselm College]].<ref>"[http://www.anselm.edu/nhiop/about/public+advisory+board/ Public Advisory Board]."

In 2009 Baker was again rumored to be a contender for the Massachusetts gubernatorial election.

Baker ran against Patrick in an atmosphere of voter discontent, with a slow economy and high unemployment, which he used to his advantage during the campaign.
