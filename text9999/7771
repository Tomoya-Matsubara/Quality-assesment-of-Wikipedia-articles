'''Roy Lunn''' (born in 1925) is an [[engineer]] in the automotive industry. He has forty-one years in the design development and production of vehicles and most notably served as the head of engineering at [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) from 1971 to 1987.

== Early life ==
Roy Lunn was educated in England with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical engineering. Lunn was in the [[Royal Air Force]] for two years as a pilot. Trained as a jig and a toolmaker and designer, he entered the auto industry in 1946 when [[AC Cars]] hired Lunn as a designer. After one year, he moved to [[Aston Martin]] as the assistant chief designer and was responsible for the [[Aston Martin DB2|DB2]] program. He joined [[Jowett]] in 1949 as chief designer and was involved in a variety of projects, including the first plastic-bodied car. Lunn also participated in automobile races. He was the co-driver with Marcel Becquart, winning the 1952 [[RAC International Rally]].

== Ford Motor Company ==
In 1953, Lunn joined [[Ford Motor Company]] in England and was assigned the task of starting a new Research Center in [[Birmingham]]. This center made the first [[prototype]] of what became the 105-E [[Ford Anglia|Anglia]]. Lunn transferred to Ford plant in [[Dagenham]] as the car<U+2019>s product planning manager to follow the 105-E into [[mass production]].

He [[Emmigration|emigrated]] to the United States in 1958 and became manager of the Ford Advanced Vehicle center. He participated in the development of a {{convert|170000|lb|kg|0|adj=on}} [[gross vehicle weight rating]] highway [[truck]], as well as the Cardinal, Ford<U+2019>s first [[front-wheel drive]] automobile that became the 15-M [[Ford Taunus|Taunus]].

In 1962, Lunn became a U.S. citizen. In 1962, Lunn and his team of engineers developed a two-seat [[Ford Mustang I]] prototype in just 100 days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Leffinwell |first=Randy |year=2001 |title=American Muscle: Muscle Cars From the Otis Chandler Collection |publisher=Motorbooks|page=15 |isbn=9780879384654 }}</ref> He was also put on a special assignment to design and develop a GT racing car along with Ray Geddes and [[Donald N. Frey]].<ref>{{cite journal |editor-last=Bailey |editor-first=L.

In 1963, under the direction of Lunn, work began on an all-new racecar, loosely based on the [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola GT]].<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.classicdriver.de/uk/magazine/3500.asp?id=11342 |title=Ford GT40 2003 - sales structure and price guide announced |date=15 October 2002 |publisher=Ford Media at Classic Driver |accessdate=16 October 2012 }}</ref> In April 1964, the [[Ford GT40]] was presented to the press for the first time.

As the [[pony car]] wars continued, [[Semon Knudsen|"Bunkie" Knudsen]] ordered Ford's large {{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Cobra Jet V8 into the 1969 [[Ford Mustang]]'s engine bay. Lunn was charged to build the "ultimate Mustang" and worked with Kar Kraft, the [[Brighton, Michigan]], specialty shop that built many of Ford's racing cars at the time, to produce the [[Boss 429]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1969-1970-ford-mustang5.htm |title=1969 Ford Mustang Boss 429 |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=howstuffworks.com |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2012 }}</ref>

== American Motors ==
Lunn joined American Motors in 1971 as the director of engineering for [[Jeep]], which had recently been purchased by AMC from Kaiser. Lunn quickly advanced at AMC to the position of Vice President of Engineering. His notable accomplishments include the [[AMC Eagle]], the compact [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]], which was the first of the modern range of SUV vehicles, as well as the development of the [[AMC Straight-4 engine]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Ackerson |first=Robert C. |title=The 50 year History of the Jeep |publisher=Motorbooks |year=1991 |isbn=9780854295333 }}</ref> and the Jeep 4.0 Liter engine that were based on the "modern era" [[AMC Straight-6 engine]].

As Jeep's chief engineer, Lunn orchestrated 4WD's next leap ahead when he joined the [[AMC Concord]] body with a reconstituted Jeep driveline. According to former AMC chairman, [[Gerald C. Meyers]], "our initial reaction to Lunn's concoction was, 'What the hell is it?' The body was raised an extra four inches for transfer-case clearance and the wheel wells were wide open."<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-69103689.html |last=Sherman |first=Don |title=All-Wheel-Drive Revisited - AMC's 1980 Eagle pioneered the cross-over SUV |journal=Automotive Industries |month=February |year=2001 |accessdate=16 October 2012 }}</ref> This became the AMC Eagle, which was America<U+2019>s first four-wheel drive car.

Lunn was also active in the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE International) becoming their technical committee chairman in 1983. He was elected a Fellow of the Society in 1985.

He completed his career at American Motors by forming and becoming President of Renault Jeep Sport to centralize all AMC and Renault racing activities in the U.S.

Lunn also designed and put into production a low-cost racing car for the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA), of which more than 864 '''Sports Renault''' purpose-built race cars (later: [[Spec Racer Ford]]) have been built.

In 1984 he headed the first American entry to drive the [[Dakar Rally|Paris-Dakar rally]]. He retired in 1985 and was immediately called back to become vice president of engineering for the [[AM General]] division of AMC. The [[High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle]] military Jeep (Hummer) was going into production and Lunn was charged with overseeing the corrective actions to achieve acceptance by the U.S. Army.

== Retirement ==
Lunn retired to his home in Florida in 1987.
