'''Camilo Jos<U+00E9> Vergara''' (born 1944) is a Chilean-born, [[New York]]-based writer, photographer and documentarian.  He was born in [[Santiago, Chile]].

Vergara has been compared to [[Jacob Riis]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gillette|first=Howard|title=Review Essay: The New American Ghetto by Camilo Jose Vergara|journal=American Studies International|date=October 1996|volume=34|issue=2|pages=118-119|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23458456|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hedstrom|first=Matthew|title=Seeing Religion Happen in the Other America|journal=American Quarterly|date=March 2009|volume=61|issue=1|pages=163-171|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v061/61.1.hedstrom.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>  for his photographic documentation of [[United States|American]] slums and decaying urban environments.  Beginning in the 1980s, Vergara applied the technique of [[rephotography]] to a series of American cities, photographing the same buildings and neighborhoods from the exact vantage point at regular intervals over many years to capture changes over time.  Trained as a sociologist with a specialty in urbanism, Vergara turned to his systematic documentation at a moment of [[urban decay]], and he chose locales where that stress seemed highest:  the housing projects of [[Chicago]]; the [[South Bronx]] of New York City; Camden, New Jersey; and [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], among others.

== Education ==

Vergara received a B.A. (1968) in [[sociology]] from the [[University of Notre Dame]] and an M.A. (1977) in sociology from [[Columbia University]], where he also completed the course work for his Ph.D. (not yet awarded).

== Career ==

Vergara began as a [[humanistic]] New York [[street photographer]] in the early '70s, when he moved to the city.<ref>some examples of the early street work can be found in a ''Slate'' series, "The Harlem That Was"</ref> This work changed significantly in the middle 1970s, when graduate work in sociology at Columbia University increasingly sensitized him to the complexities of environmental influences on social behavior. The advent of [[Kodachrome]] 64 film in 1974 alerted Vergara to the possibilities of permanent color photographic records of changing urban landscapes and their features.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vergara|first=Camilo|title=Homage to Kodachrome 64: They just discontinued the film that changed my photography career.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/gallery/2009/06/homage_to_kodachrome_64.html|work=Slate|publisher=Slate|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>  He began at that time to work systematically, using techniques adapted from sociological methodologies;  traveling from one subway stop to the next, he would emerge onto the street and then photograph the surrounding blocks, fanning steadily outward.  By 1977, he had come upon a rough approximation of his lifelong working method, returning to the same locales over time to photograph changes in the makeup of the communities in question.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meyers|first=William|title=Camilo Jos<U+00E9> Vergara: 2012 National Humanities Medalist|url=http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/national-humanities-medals/camilo-jos<U+00E9>-vergara|work=National Endowment for the Humanities|publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> 

With more than a decade of photographs to document the extraordinary phenomenon of [[de-urbanization]] (including the conversion of buildings from one function to a second, then a third, before their abandonment, and the process by which nature recolonized long-urban areas), Vergara published ''The New American Ghetto'' with [[Rutgers University Press]], for which he received the Robert E. Park Award of the American Sociological Association in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Robert E. Park Book Awards|url=http://www.commurb.org/Park_Book_Award.htm|publisher=Community and Urban Sociology Section of the American Sociological Association|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>

The rephotographic method, with its rigorous demands for systematic return, exact replication of vantage point, angle of view, and lens choice, had emerged originally out of the need for scientific evidence of change over time in ecological niches.<ref>Peter B. Hales,<U+201C>Landscape and Documentary: Questions of Rephotography,<U+201D> Afterimage, Summer, 1987, pp. 10<U+2013>14</ref> Vergara's use of the technique was not exclusive; indeed, Vergara made other pictures, including of residents and smaller details.  Beginning with ''The New American Ghetto'', Vergara increasingly interwove these photographs, along with quotes from outside writers, fragments of comments by citizen-dwellers in the cityscapes he developed, and his own writing. Vergara's work was the subject of a 1999 exhibit at the [[National Building Museum]], "El Nuevo Mundo: The Landscape of [[Latino]] [[Los Angeles]]." The exhibit was shown later in 1999 at the [[Cooper-Hewitt]], [[National Design Museum]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]. "The New American Ghetto", an earlier exhibition, opened at the [[National Building Museum]] and was later shown at The [[Municipal Arts Society]] in [[New York City]].  After the publication of his second major work, ''American Ruins'', Vergara's reputation was fully established; he won a [[MacArthur Foundation]] "genius grant" in 2002 and served as a fellow at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Center for the Humanities (MARCH) at [[Rutgers University]] in 2003/2004.

The advent of sophisticated internet combinations of mapping, visual archiving, and hyperlinking have enabled Vergara to present his work in ways that can combine both the vertical (change over time) and the horizontal (change across space) and link the visual images to texts and databases. Since 2004, Vergara's main work has been conveyed in a website called "[http://invinciblecities.camden.rutgers.edu/ Invincible Cities]" in addition to a continuing series of exhibitions, books, and magazine projects, including a collection of pictures of Chicago's public housing for the new literary magazine ''Granta'''s Fall, 2009 issue.<ref>Granta 108, Fall, 2009</ref> ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' and "[[Time (magazine)|Time]]" magazines have also commissioned him to produce "mines" of his work<U+2014>collections that feature topics or themes, from GM automobiles<ref>http://www.slate.com/id/2208239/</ref> to distant traces of the World Trade Towers.<ref>http://lightbox.time.com/2011/09/06/twin-towers-and-the-metropolis-1970-2011/</ref> 

In 1995, Vergara made a controversial proposal that 12 square blocks of downtown [[Detroit]] be declared a "skyscraper ruins park," an "American [[acropolis]]," for the preservation and study of the deteriorating and empty skyscrapers.  "We could transform the nearly 100 troubled buildings into a grand national historic park of play and wonder, an urban [[Monument Valley]].... Midwestern prairie would be allowed to invade from the north.  Trees, vines, and wildflowers would grow on roofs and out of windows; goats and wild animals<U+2014>squirrels, possum, bats, owls, ravens, snakes and insects<U+2014>would live in the empty behemoths, adding their calls, hoots and screeches to the smell of rotten leaves and animal droppings."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vergara|first=Camilo Jose|title=Downtown Detroit: "American acropolis" or vacant land -- what to do with the world's largest concentration of pre-depression skyscrapers|journal=Metropolis|date=April 1995}}</ref> This proposal was met with criticism by the city's business leaders, among others,<ref>{{cite news|last=Bennet|first=James|title=A Tribute To Ruin Irks Detroit|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/10/us/a-tribute-to-ruin-irks-detroit.html|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 10, 1995}}</ref> and continues to feature in discussions about [[Deindustrialization|deindustrialization]] and [[Ruins photography|ruins photography]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arens|first=Robert M.|title=Say Nice Things About Detroit: Private Visions and Public Debate|journal=Architecture Material and Imagined|date=1997|issue=85th ACSA Annual Meeting Proceedings, Architecture: Material and Imagined|pages=634-638|url=http://apps.acsa-arch.org/resources/proceedings/uploads/streamfile.aspx?path=ACSA.AM.85&name=ACSA.AM.85.147.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>http://oa.upm.es/5978/1/FernandezAgueda_ponencia_2010_02.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Leary|first=John Patrick|title=Detroitism|url=http://www.guernicamag.com/features/leary_1_15_11/|work=Guernica|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=January 15, 2011}}</ref>

His work has been published in eight books. His ''Harlem:  The Unmaking of a Ghetto'', published in December 2013 by the University of Chicago Press, uses photographs made over decades in that iconic Manhattan community, and the visual, social and cultural effects of gentrification on what was historically among the richest repositories of African-American culture in the urbanized North.

== Awards ==
In 2010, Vergara was rewarded a [[Berlin Prize]] fellowship and spent the academic spring semester 2010 at the University.<ref name="AmAcad10">{{cite web | url=http://www.americanacademy.de/home/person/camilo-jose-vergara | title=Berlin Prize Fellow, Class of Spring 2010 | publisher=American Academy in Berlin | accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>
