The '''2007 NBA Finals''' was the championship series of the [[2006<U+2013>07 NBA season|2006-07 National Basketball Association season]], and was the conclusion of the [[2007 NBA Playoffs]]. The best-of-seven series was played between the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion [[San Antonio Spurs]] and the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion  [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. This was Cleveland's first trip to the NBA Finals in their franchise history and San Antonio's fourth. The Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4-0. [[Tony Parker]] was named the series' [[NBA Finals MVP|MVP]]. The series was televised on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] under the [[ESPN on ABC]] branding, producing remarkably low television ratings.

==Format==
The Finals are played using the current 2-3-2 format, where the first two and last two games are held at the team with [[home court advantage]]. The NBA, after experimenting in the early years, restored this original format for the Finals in 1985. The other playoff series are played in the 2-2-1-1-1 format.

The [[Playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven series]] began on June 7, 2007, with the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion San Antonio Spurs playing the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion Cleveland Cavaliers. Because the San Antonio Spurs had a better regular season win-loss record, they had home court advantage.

===San Antonio Spurs===
The previous season saw the San Antonio Spurs drop a heartbreaking seventh game at home to the rival [[Dallas Mavericks]] in the second round.  As the new season began, the Spurs saw the Mavericks rolling through their regular season, on their way to a franchise best 67 win campaign. Meanwhile, the Spurs struggled through their season through January.  With the main focus lying on Dallas, and the [[Phoenix Suns]], the Spurs found themselves flying under the radar.  However, the Spurs used a late season surge en route to a 58-24 regular season record, good enough for third seed in the Western Conference. 

In the playoffs, the Spurs met the [[Denver Nuggets]] and their duo of [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Carmelo Anthony]].  Although the Nuggets took Game One, the Spurs rallied off 4 straight wins to take the series in five games.  As San Antonio prepared to face off against the second seed Phoenix Suns, the top ranked Dallas Mavericks suffered a stunning first round exit at the hand of the [[Golden State Warriors]].  With the Mavs gone, the stakes of the Suns-Spurs series shot up dramatically, and the result was a closely competitive and controversial series. 

The Suns, due to their better season record, had [[homecourt advantage]], but that would not last past Game One. In a hotly contested battle of Western Conference heavyweights, each team tried to deliver a knockout blow to the other. The Spurs finally landed it, but by accident. With the game in the balance [[Tony Parker]] and [[Steve Nash]] collided head-to-head. A large gash opened along Nash's nose and though the medical staff tried admirably, they could not stop the bleeding and he was forced to sit the final 45 seconds and watch as the Spurs won Game One 111-106. Game Two saw the Suns rebound and blow out the Spurs to a 101-81 beating. After this game, Suns center [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] labeled the Spurs a dirty team. Game Three switched back to San Antonio and saw a return of the physical play, resulting in [[Manu Gin<U+00F3>bili]] receiving a bruised and bloodied eye and Nash being kneed in the groin by Bruce Bowen. However, [[Tim Duncan]] led the Spurs to a 108-101 victory.

Games Four and Five were the most controversial of the series. The Spurs, after being comfortably in control of Game Four, saw their 11-point fourth quarter lead dwindle away, to a 2-point Suns lead. With 18 seconds left [[Robert Horry]] bodychecked Steve Nash in which he threw his arms in the air, into the scorers table. Nash's teammates jumped to his defense; during the ensuing altercation, Stoudemire and [[Boris Diaw]] left the bench heading toward the altercation. Their action violated NBA rules, resulting in the decision by league commissioner [[David Stern]] to suspend both players for Game Five (Horry was also suspended two games for his flagrant foul against Nash). In Game Five, played in Phoenix, the short-handed Suns jumped out early and enjoyed a 16 point lead on the Spurs, but in a reversal of Game Four, this time the Spurs came back in the final seconds and won the game 88-85, giving San Antonio a 3-2 series lead.

The Spurs won Game Six of the series 114-106 in San Antonio, sending them to their fifth Western Conference Finals since 1999.

San Antonio went on to beat the [[Utah Jazz]] in five games to advance to the franchise's fourth NBA Finals.

===Cleveland Cavaliers===
In the replay of the previous year's playoff with the Cavs holding homecourt advantage against [[Washington Wizards]], the Cavs took care of the Wizards in a four game sweep after the season ending injuries of both [[Gilbert Arenas]] and [[Caron Butler]]. In the second round of the playoffs the Cavs faced off against the [[New Jersey Nets]]. Again the Cavs had homecourt and battled with the Nets through 6 games before becoming victorious in the series. The Cavs for only the third time in franchise history were moving on to the Conference Finals, and this time they were facing a familiar foe. The [[Detroit Pistons]], the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference, with their homecourt advantage, were waiting for the Cavs. This was the same Detroit team that knocked the Cavs out of the second round last year. The expectations were high after a long 7 game series the previous year and these two teams would not disappoint.

The first two games were close and saw Cleveland fall by identical 79-76 scores. Down 0-2 in the series, the spotlight shifted back to Cleveland and [[LeBron James]]. Another hard fought set ensued, with the Cavs taking the two games at home 88-82 and 91-87 respectively. Game 5  switched back to Detroit and produced one of the greatest moments in NBA history.

With 6:14 to go in regulation and his team clinging to a one point 79-78 lead, LeBron James took over. He scored 11 of the final 12 points to end regulation tied 91-91. In the 1st overtime, James scored all 9 of the Cavaliers points ending this period tied 100-100. In the 2nd overtime, James again scored all 9 of the teams points to win game five 109-107.  Thus, in the last 16:14 of play, James scored the Cavaliers last 25 points and 29 of the last 30 points.

The Cavaliers beat the Pistons at home in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals to advance to the franchise's first ever trip to NBA Finals. Cleveland became the third team in NBA history to win a best-of-seven Conference Final after going down 0-2 in a series.

==Game summaries==
===Game 1===
The [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] entered the 2007 Finals as newcomers. Game 1 was their first NBA Finals game in franchise history, and the first for each of its players (other than reserve point guard [[Eric Snow]]). However, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] had been to the Finals in three of the past eight seasons, winning a championship each time. With solid performances by [[Tim Duncan]], [[Tony Parker]], and [[Manu Gin<U+00F3>bili]], the Spurs won the series opener in convincing fashion, limiting LeBron James to 14 points on 4-16 shooting.

===Game 2===
The Spurs took a stranglehold on momentum in Game 2. The Spurs' big three overwhelmed the Cavs and the Spurs led by as many as 29 points in the third quarter. They absolutely dominated game during first 3 quarters and played show-time basketball. A furious 25-6 rally by Cleveland in the final quarter wasn't enough as the Spurs took a 2-0 lead in the series.

===Game 3===
Rookie [[Daniel Gibson]] started Game 3 in place of the injured [[Larry Hughes]] but scored a series-low 2 points on 1-10 shooting. As a team the Cavs shot only .367 but out-rebounded the Spurs 48-41. [[Zydrunas Ilgauskas]] had a 2006-07 season high 18 rebounds. On the game's final play, [[LeBron James]] missed a potential game-tying 29 foot 3-pointer. 

Game 3 was the lowest-scoring Finals game since [[1955 NBA Finals|1955]], with [[Tim Duncan]] of the Spurs having his lowest scoring game in his NBA Finals career, with 14 points.

===Game 4===
San Antonio started out strong through the first three quarters, leading by as many as 11.  Cleveland would stage a rally near the end of the third quarter and the first five minutes of the fourth, scoring 14 consecutive points to take its first second-half lead of the series.  However, the Spurs would stage a 12-3 rally of their own to retake the lead and win the series in a 4-0 sweep.

==Broadcasting==
{{see also|NBA on ABC|NBA on ESPN|NBA on ESPN Radio}}
Coverage was produced by [[ESPN]] and televised on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States, [[The Sports Network|TSN]] in Canada, [[Sky Sports]] in the United Kingdom, [[Canal+]] in France, [[Premiere (pay television network)|Premiere]] in Germany, and more than 100 other broadcasters in over 200 countries.

[[Play-by-play]] announcer [[Mike Breen]], analysts [[Mark Jackson]] & former [[Houston Rockets|Rockets]] head-coach [[Jeff Van Gundy]], and courtside reporters [[Michele Tafoya]] & [[Stuart Scott]] provided commentary and analysis for the North American market. The radio coverage on [[ESPN Radio]] features play-by-play man [[Mike Tirico]] and color analysts [[Dr. Jack Ramsay]] and [[Hubie Brown]].

The featured song, aired throughout the playoffs, was [[The Pussycat Dolls]] "[[Right Now (1962 song)|Right Now]]."

Another song featured in the 2007 NBA Finals series, "[[It Ends Tonight]]" by [[The All-American Rejects]], was aired at the end of the pre-game promo for Game 4.

===Ratings===
{{see also|National Basketball Association Nielsen ratings}}
According to ESPN, the NBA Finals series was a television bust in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2905923&type=story|title=Ratings for 2007 finals down 27 percent from last year|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=June 15, 2007|date=June 15, 2007|author=Associated Press}}</ref> San Antonio's four-game sweep of Cleveland finished with a record-low 6.2 television rating and 11 share on ABC, Nielsen Media Research said on June 15, 2007.

That was down 27 percent from the 8.5/15 for [[Miami Heat|Miami]]'s six-game victory over [[Dallas Mavericks|Dallas]] from [[2006 NBA Finals|the previous year]] and 5 percent under the previous low, a 6.5/12 for San Antonio's six-game win over [[New Jersey Nets|New Jersey]] in {{nbafy|2003}}.

San Antonio's series-winning 83-82 victory on Thursday night got a 6.5/12, down 17 percent from the 7.8/14 for Game 4 in 2006.

The ratings of the 2007 NBA Finals surpassed that of the [[2003 NBA Finals]] as the lowest-rated series in NBA Finals history. It is suggested that these poor ratings have been attributed to numerous things, such as the fact that [[Cleveland]] and [[San Antonio]] (especially San Antonio) are generally smaller markets in comparison to [[Los Angeles Lakers|Los Angeles]], [[Miami Heat|Miami]] and [[Detroit Pistons|Detroit]], cities that recently had their NBA teams in the Finals and not having major basketball star such as [[Kobe Bryant]] (Lakers) and [[Dwyane Wade]] (Heat), aside from [[LeBron James]] (Cavaliers).{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Additionally, many critics believe the Spurs outmatched the Cavaliers and made the series into a low scoring, defensive battle. The series was to bill [[LeBron James]] at the highest point in his career. He did account for a vast majority of the Cavaliers' performance in the playoffs, however, he struggled throughout the Finals against the Spurs' defense.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Coverage controversy===
Additionally, ESPN on ABC's coverage of the Finals placed far more emphasis on the legacy of the game. More was seemingly directed towards league stars [[Michael Jordan]], [[Magic Johnson]], and [[Larry Bird]], three players responsible for the league's success in the 1980s and 1990s. In addition, there was increased emphasis celebrity and cross-network promotion, much of which centered on [[Eva Longoria]], star of ABC's ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' and then-fiancee of Spurs' Point Guard [[Tony Parker]] was featured at times during the games.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Controversies==
In October 2007, [[Detroit Pistons]] [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Rasheed Wallace]] commented on the loss, stating that the Cavaliers didn't beat the Pistons, but rather that the Pistons lost because they fell prey to the NBA wanting the Cavaliers in the finals.  Wallace stated that the NBA was becoming "fake", like [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]] addressed the comments, calling them "disrespectful."  He rebuked Wallace for such statements, but did not issue a fine against the Pistons forward.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wallace gets Stern rebuke&mdash;Commissioner infers forward's comments on league wanting Cavaliers in Finals disrespectful|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=October 27, 2007|first=Chris|last=McCosky|page=3C}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rasheed's comments draw ire of Stern|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/21505333/|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=May 28, 2011|date=October 27, 2007}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The Spurs continued to stay competitive in the Western Conference, but age began to take its toll. The Spurs won 56 games in the [[2007-08 NBA season|2007-08 season]], but had to cede the [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division title]] to the [[New Orleans Hornets]] due to a tie-breaker. The Spurs had the last laugh, though, defeating the Hornets in seven games. But their chance of defending their title was denied by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in five games of the conference finals. After that the Spurs proceeded to win only a single playoff series in three years ([[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]], vs. [[Dallas Mavericks|Dallas]] 4-2 of the first round), culminating in a six-game first-round upset by the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in the [[2011 NBA Playoffs]], after the Spurs won 61 games that season. 

The Cavaliers won 45 games in the 2008 season, despite early-season contract issues involving center [[Anderson Varej<U+00E3>o]] and guard [[Aleksandar Pavlovi<U+0107>|Sasha Pavlovi<U+0107>]], and a mid-season trade for [[Ben Wallace]]. They [[2008 NBA Playoffs|fell in the second round]] by the eventual NBA champions [[Boston Celtics]] in seven games, after a hard-fought duel involving LeBron James and [[Paul Pierce]]. The Cavaliers would earn the league's best record for the next two years (66 and 61 wins, respectively) and boast the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA's MVP]] in James. However, they were unable to win it all, losing to the [[Orlando Magic]] in six games of the [[2009 NBA Playoffs|2009 Eastern Conference Finals]] and the Celtics in six games of the [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010 Eastern Conference Semifinals]]. After that season James bolted to the [[Miami Heat]] and helped them reach the [[2011 NBA Finals]], while the Cavaliers sunk to an Eastern Conference-low 19 wins in the [[2010-11 NBA season]], which included a [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|26-game losing streak]].
