The '''Council of Lithuania''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos Taryba}}, {{lang-de|Litausher Landesrat}}, {{lang-pl|Rada Litewska}}), after [[July 11]] [[1918]] ''' The State Council of Lithuania''' (Lithuanian: ''Lietuvos Valstyb<U+0117>s Taryba''), was convened at the [[Vilnius Conference]] that took place between September 18 and 23, 1917. The council was granted the executive authority of the Lithuanian people and was entrusted to establish an independent Lithuanian state.<ref name=eidintas>{{cite book |last=Eidintas |first=Alfonsas |coauthors=Vytautas <U+017D>alys, Alfred Erich Senn |editor=Ed.

==Historical background and Vilnius Conference==
After the last [[partitions of Poland|Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795, Lithuania had become part of the [[Russian Empire]]. During the 19th century, both the Poles and the Lithuanians attempted to restore their independence. They rebelled during the [[November Uprising]] in 1830 and the [[January Uprising]] in 1863, but the first realistic opportunity came about during the [[World War I]]. In 1915, Germany occupied Lithuania as its troops marched towards Russia. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, opportunities for independence opened up. Germany, avoiding direct annexation, tried to find a middle path that would involve some kind of union with Germany.<ref name=gerutis/> In the light of upcoming peace negotiations with Russia, the Germans agreed to allow the Vilnius Conference, hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to be detached from Russia and wished for a closer relationship with Germany.<ref name=el>{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Simas Su<U+017E>ied<U+0117>lis | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title = Council of Lithuania | year = 1970-1978 | publisher = Juozas Kapo<U+010D>ius | volume = I | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = {{LCC|74-114275}} | pages = 581-585}}</ref> However, the conference, held between September 18 and 23, 1917, adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with [[Germany]] would depend on whether it recognized the new state.<ref name=el/> On September 21st, the attendees at the conference elected a 20-member Council of Lithuania to establish this resolution. The German authorities did not allow that resolution to be published, but they did permit the council to proceed.<ref name=el/> The authorities censored the Council's newspaper, ''Lietuvos aidas'' (''Echo of Lithuania''), preventing the Council from reaching a wider public audience.<ref name=eidintas/> The Vilnius Conference also resolved that a constituent assembly should be elected by popular vote as soon as possible.

==Structure and Membership==

The twenty men who comprised the Council were of different ages (the youngest was 25; the oldest 66), social status, professions, and political affiliations. There were eight lawyers, four priests, three [[agronomy|agronomists]], two [[financier]]s, a doctor, a publisher, and an engineer.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite web| url=http://www.lnm.lt/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=172&Itemid=231 |title=Lietuvos taryba |publisher=National Museum of Lithuania| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> Eight of the members were [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and seven were not affiliated. All except one held degrees in higher education,<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite web| first=Sigitas |last= Jegelevi<U+010D>ius |url= http://www.lrt.lt/sites/static.php?strid=215331& |title= Vasario 16-osios Akto signatarai |publisher= [[Lithuanian National Radio and Television]] | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> and all were [[multilingual]], fluent at a minimum in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] and often in [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[German language|German]] as well. The Council's last surviving member, [[Aleksandras Stulginskis]], passed away in September 1969.

During the first meeting on September 24, [[Antanas Smetona]] was elected as the chairman of the council. The chairman, two vice-chairmen, and two secretaries made up the presidium. The vice-chairs and secretaries would change from time to time, but Smetona retained the chairmanship until 1919 when he was elected the first [[President of Lithuania]].<ref name=el/> Smetona was succeeded by [[Stasys <U+0160>ilingas]] as the chairman. He was not among the original twenty members. The first change in membership took place on July 13, 1918, when six new members (Martynas Y<U+010D>as, [[Augustinas Voldemaras]], Juozas Purickis, Eliziejus Draugelis, Jurgis Alekna and Stasys <U+0160>ilingas) were admitted and four (Kairys, Vilei<U+0161>is, Bir<U+017E>i<U+0161>ka, Narutavi<U+010D>ius) resigned.<ref name=cd-1015>{{lt icon}} {{cite book |last= Skirius |first=Juozas |title=Gimtoji istorija.

==Declaration of Independence==
{{main|Act of Independence of Lithuania}}
[[Image:Nepriklausomybes aktas.gif|thumb|[[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Declaration of Independence]] on February 16]]
Soon after the council was elected, major developments took place in Russia. The [[October Revolution]] brought the [[Bolshevik]]s to power. They signed a [[truce]] with Germany on [[December 2]], [[1917]] and started peace negotiations. Germany needed some documentation of its relationship with Lithuania. In the so-called Berlin Protocol Germany offered to recognize Lithuanian independence if the latter agreed to form a firm and permanent federation with Germany, based on conventions concerning military affairs, transportation, [[customs]], and currency.<ref name=el/> The council agreed, on condition that Lithuania would decide its own internal affairs and foreign policy. The Germans rejected this proposal. On December 11, the council adopted a resolution agreeing to a "firm and permanent alliance" with Germany on the basis of the four conventions. Only fifteen members voted for this resolution, but all twenty signed it.<ref name=el/> 

The Germans broke their promise and did not recognize the state and did not invite its delegation to the negotiations of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. Lithuanians, including those living abroad, disapproved of the December 11 declaration.<ref name=eidintas/> The declaration, seen as pro-German, was an obstacle in establishing diplomatic relations with England, France and the United States, the enemies of Germany.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite book |last= Skirius |first=Juozas |title=Gimtoji istorija.

The amendments were rejected by the Germans and it was made clear that the Council would serve only advisory functions.<ref name=eidintas/> The council was torn apart and a few members threatened to leave.  On February 16th, the council, temporarily chaired by [[Jonas Basanavi<U+010D>ius]], decided to re-declare independence, this time mentioning nothing specific about a relationship with Germany. That was left for a constituent assembly to decide. February 16th is now one of Lithuania's two official Independence Days.<ref>{{lt icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=134377 Lietuvos Respublikos <U+0161>ven<U+010D>i<U+0173> dien<U+0173> <U+012F>statymas], <U+017D>in., 1990, Nr. 31-757, [[Seimas]].

==Establishing independence==

The Germans were not satisfied with the new declaration and demanded that the council go back to the December 11 decision.<ref name=cd-1015/> On March 3, Germany and Bolshevik Russia signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. It declared that the [[Baltic states|Baltic nations]] were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On March 23, Germany recognized independent Lithuania on the basis of the December 11 declaration.<ref name=el/> However, nothing in essence changed either in Lithuania or in Council's status: any efforts to establish administration were hindered.<ref name=gerutis>{{cite book |last=Gerutis |first=Albertas |editor= Ed. Albertas Gerutis |others= translated by Algirdas Budreckis|title= Lithuania: 700 Years |year=1984 |edition=6th |publisher= Manyland Books|location= New York|id={{LCC|75-80057}}. ISBN 0-87141-028-1 |pages=151-162 |chapter=Independent Lithuania}}</ref> The form of government, however, was left undecided. Germany, ruled by a [[kaiser]], obviously preferred a monarchy. They proposed a personal union with the [[Prussia]]n [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]].<ref name=el/> As an alternative, on June 4 the council voted to invite Duke Wilhelm of Urach, Count of W<U+00FC>rttemberg, to become the monarch of Lithuania. He agreed and was elected [[King of Lithuania]] ([[Mindaugas II]]) on July 13, 1918. The decision was very controversial and four members of the council left in protest.<ref name=TB>{{lt icon}} {{cite web| url=http://www.bernardinai.lt/index.php?url=articles/54471 |title=Karali<U+0161>kojo kraujo paie<U+0161>kos: Lietuva ir <U+0161>imto dien<U+0173> karalius|publisher=Bernardinai.lt| accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> 

Germany did not recognize the new king and its relationship with the council remained tense.<ref name=TB/> The council was not allowed to determine the borders of Lithuania, establish an embassy in Berlin, or begin forming a stable administrative system. It received small funds to cover its expenses only in September of 1918.<ref name=gerutis/> The situation changed when the [[German Revolution]] started and Germany lost the war in fall of 1918 - it was no longer in a position to dictate terms. On November 2, the council adopted the first provisional [[constitution]]. The decision to invite King Mindaugas II was annulled and this helped to reconcile the political factions.<ref name=gerutis/> The functions of government were entrusted to a 3-member presidium, and [[Augustinas Voldemaras]] was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers.<ref name=eidintas/> The first government was formed on [[November 11]], [[1918]], the day that Germany signed the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|armistice in Compi<U+00E8>gne]]. The council began to organize an army, police, local government, and other institutions. It also expanded to include ethnic minorities ([[Jews]] and [[Belarussians]]).<ref name=cd-1015/>

As German forces retreated and [[Bolshevik]] forces approached [[Vilnius]], on [[January 2]], [[1919]] the council moved to [[Kaunas]]. The [[Freedom wars of Lithuania|Freedom Wars]] started. On April 4, the second provisional constitution was adopted, creating the office of [[President of Lithuania]]. Antanas Smetona, as the chairman of the council, became the first president. The German forces did not leave Lithuania until July 1919. Due to wars and other turmoil, elections to the [[Constituent Assembly of Lithuania]] were not held until spring of 1920. The council adjourned on [[May 15]], [[1920]].
