The '''Sarayk<U+00F6>y Nuclear Research and Training Center''' ({{lang-tr|Sarayk<U+00F6>y N<U+00FC>kleer Ara<U+015F>t<U+0131>rma ve E<U+011F>itim Merkezi}}), known as '''SANAEM''', is a [[nuclear research]] and training center of [[Turkey]]. The organization was established on July 1, 2005 as a subunit of [[TAEK|Turkish Atomic Energy Administration]] ({{lang-tr|T<U+00FC>rkiye Atom Enerjisi Kurumu}}, TAEK) at [[Kazan, Ankara|Kazan]] district in northwest of [[Ankara]] on an area of {{convert|42.3|ha|acre|abbr=on}}.<ref name="tk">{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/belgeler-formlar/func-directinfo/736/ |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=T<U+00FC>rkiye Atom Enerjisi Kurumu-Sarayk<U+00F6>y N<U+00FC>kleer Ara<U+015F>t<U+0131>rma ve E<U+011F>itim Merkezi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}</ref>

==Gamma radiation facility==
Three [[gamma radiation]] units are in service for sterilization of disposable medical supplies and food irradiation.<ref name="tk"/> 

==Electron accelerator facility==
The electron accelerator is the only one in the country. It has 500 [[Electronvolt|KeV]] energy and 20 [[Ampere|mA]] current.<ref name="tk"/>

==Proton accelerator facility==
The country's first proton accelerator facility ({{lang-tr|Proton H<U+0131>zland<U+0131>r<U+0131>c<U+0131> Tesisi}}, TAEK-PHT) is housed in a separate building of two stories built on a ground area of {{convert|3100|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}. The building consists of a [[cyclotron]] room, four target rooms, six production laboratories, three quality control laboratories, a R&D laboratory and storage rooms for material and waste.<ref name="tk"/>

Facility's groundbreaking was held on February 24, 2010. The building was constructed by the Turkish Housing Development Administration (TOK<U+0130>), and it was completed on December 12, 2010. The installation of the [[particle accelerator|proton accelerator]] and all the equipment needed concluded in 2011.<ref name="taek2">{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/sanaem/30-arastirma-ve-gelistirme-bolumu/855-proton-hizlandirici-tesisi.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=Proton H<U+0131>zland<U+0131>r<U+0131>c<U+0131> Tesisi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}</ref> The facility was officially opened on May 30, 2012 by Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo<U+011F>an]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-opens-first-particle-accelerator.aspx?pageID=238&nID=22014&NewsCatID=341 |newspaper=[[H<U+00FC>rriyet Daily News]] |title=Turkey opens first particle accelerator |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/sanaem.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=TAEK Proton H<U+0131>zland<U+0131>r<U+0131>c<U+0131>s<U+0131> Tesisi A<U+00E7><U+0131>ld<U+0131> |date=2012-05-31 |language=Turkish |accessdaye=2012-05-31 }}</ref>

The [[cyclotron]] type proton accelerator "CYCLONE-30" has a variable beam energy between 15 and 30 MeV and variable beam current up to 1.2 mA. It was designed, manufactured and installed by Belgian Ion Beam Applications S.A. (IBA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iba-cyclotron-solutions.com/sites/default/files/ressources/CBR_Cyclone30_R01.pdf |publisher=IBA Cyclotron Solutions |title=Cyclone 30 |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}</ref> The cyclotron cost 11.6 million EUR.<ref name="c">{{cite web |url=http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=67826 |publisher=[[CERN]] |title=TAEK Proton H<U+0131>zland<U+0131>r<U+0131>c<U+0131> Tesisi Kapsam<U+0131> ve Hedefleri |author=Y<U+00FC>ksel, Alper Nazmi |date=2009--09-10 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}</ref>

With the cyclotron, four [[beamline]]s can be generated, three beamlines for radiositope production and one for research and development works.<ref name="tk"/><ref name="c"/> With the proton bombardment following radioisotopes are produced in three separate target rooms:
* [[Indium-111]], [[Gallium-67]], [[Thallium-201]] on solid target material,
* [[Fluorine-18]] on liquid target material,
* [[Iodine-123]] on evaporated target material.<ref name="c"/>

These radioisotopes and [[radiopharmaceutical]]s produced from those radioisotopes are used for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases like [[cancer]], [[neurological disorder]], brain physiology and pathology as well as [[coronary artery disease]].<ref name="taek2"/>

By producing radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, the facility conducts research work in the fields of medicine, industry, agriculture, food, [[biotechnology]], animal husbandry and heath physics.<ref name="taek1">{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/sanaem.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=Sarayk<U+00F6>y N<U+00FC>kleer Ara<U+015F>t<U+0131>rma ve E<U+011F>itim Merkezi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}</ref>
