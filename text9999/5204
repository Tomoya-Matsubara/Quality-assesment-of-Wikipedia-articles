In [[Occitan language|Occitan]] literature, a '''''tornada''''' ({{IPA-oc|tur<U+02C8>na<U+00F0><U+0254>, tu<U+0280><U+02C8>nad<U+0254>|lang}}, {{IPA-ca|tur<U+02C8>na<U+00F0><U+0259>, to<U+027E><U+02C8>na<U+00F0>a|lang}}; "turned, twisted") refers to a final, shorter stanza (or ''[[Cobla (Occitan literary term)|cobla]]'') that appears in [[lyric poetry]] and serves a variety of purposes within several poetic forms.  The word ''tornada'' derives from the [[Old Occitan]] in which it is the feminine form of ''tornat'', a [[past participle]] of the verb ''tornar'' ("to turn, return").  It is derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''tornare'' ("to turn in a lathe, round off").<ref>{{cite web|title=tornada|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tornada|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref>  

Originating in the [[Provence]] region of present-day [[France]], Occitan literature spread through the tradition of the [[troubadour]]s in the [[High Middle Ages]].  The tornada became a hallmark of the language's lyric poetry tradition which emerged {{circa}} 1000, in a region called [[Occitania]] that now comprises parts of modern-day France, [[Italy]] and [[Catalonia]] (northeastern Spain).  Under the influence of the troubadours, related movements sprang up throughout medieval Europe: the ''[[Minnesang]]'' in [[Germany]], ''[[trovadorismo]]'' in [[Galicia]] (northeastern Spain) and [[Portugal]], and that of the ''[[trouv<U+00E8>res]]'' in northern France.  Because of this, the concept embodied in the tornada has been found in other [[Romance language]] literatures that can directly trace several of their techniques from the [[Occitan literature|Occitan lyric tradition]].  The tornada appears in Old French literature as the ''[[envoi]]'', in  Galician-Portuguese literature as the ''finda'', and in Italian literature as the ''congedo'' and ''commiato''.<ref name="Levin 1984 p. 297">Levin 1984 p. 297</ref> The tornada has been used and developed by poets in the [[Renaissance]] such as [[Petrarch]] (1304<U+2013>1374) and [[Dante Alighieri]] (c.1265<U+2013>1321),<ref name="Levin 1984, p. 301<U+2013>308.">Levin 1984, p. 301<U+2013>308.</ref> and it continues to be invoked in the poetic forms that originated with the Occitan lyrical tradition that have survived into modernity.

By {{circa|1170|lk=no}} it had evolved to include a set of generic concepts developed by troubadours, poets who composed and performed their poetry;<ref name="Preminger 1993, p. 1310">Preminger 1993, p. 1310</ref> the majority of their poems can be categorised as ''cansos'' (love songs), ''sirventes'' (satires), and the ''cobla'' (individual stanzas).<ref name="Preminger 1993, p. 852">Preminger 1993, p. 852</ref>  Since they are composed of a variable number of lines, an individual tornada can also be known as by more general poetic labels that apply to stanza length, according to where it is used; for instance, the tornada of a [[sestina]], comprising three lines, is also known as a [[tercet]].<ref name="Preminer 1993 p. 1146">Preminger 1993 p. 1146</ref>  For example, in a sestina (a poetic form that is derived from the troubadour tradition), the tornada serves as a short, concluding stanza that should contain all of the six so-called "rhyme-words" that are repeated throughout the form.  When employed, this form of the tornada (as a sestina) has traditionally take a rhyming pattern of 2<U+2013>5, 4<U+2013>3, 6<U+2013>1.  The first rhyme-word of each pair can occur anywhere in the line, while the second iteration must end the line.<ref name="Fry 2007 p. 234.">Fry 2007, p. 234.</ref> However, as the form developed, the end-word order of the tornada was no longer strictly enforced.<ref name="Fry 2007 p. 237.">Fry 2007, p. 237.</ref>

Tornadas can be employed to serve a number of discrete purposes within poems and often contain useful information about the poem's composition.  The ''tornada'' can identify the location and date where the poem was written, the identity of members of the [[troubadour]]'s circle, and several ''tornadas'' serve as dedications to a friend or patron of the poet.<ref name="Preminger 1993 p. 1295.">Preminger 1993, p. 1295.</ref> An additional purpose of the tornada is to focus and reflect on the theme of the poem, commenting on the surrounding material within the poem,<ref name="Levin 1984, p. 297." /> and to act as a concluding stanza for the poem.  However, in several examples the device can sometimes be used to create new narrative material.  For instance, in [[Malcabru]]'s ''[[pastorela]]'' <U+201C>L<U+2019>autrier jost<U+2019>una sebissa<U+201D> (trans. "The other day along a hedgerow"), the narrator is attracted to a shepherdess for her feisty wit and professes that "country-men want country-women / in places where all wisdom's lacking."<ref>In the original Proven<U+00E7>al: ''E<U+2022>il vilans ab la vilana; / En tal loc fai sens fraitura.''

Retrieved 25 February 2013.</ref>  The shepherdess replies in the tornada in a way that "creates some tension with the enigma she seems to introduce suddenly at the end."<ref name="Koelb 2008, p. 54.">Koelb 2008 p. 54.</ref> by saying "and some will gawk before a painting / while others wait to see real manna."<ref>In the original Proven<U+00E7>al: ''Que tals bad' en la peintura / Qu'autre n'espera la mana.''

In the original Occitan model, the tornada was a stanza that metrically replicated the second half (''sirima'') of the preceding [[strophe]] (a structural division of a poem containing stanzas of varying length). Since the poems of the troubadours were very often accompanied by music, the music of the tornada would have indicated the end of the poem to an audience.<ref name="Levin 1984, p. 297.">Levin 1984, p. 297.</ref>  Comparatively, the Sicilian tornada was larger, forming the entire last strophe of the song or [[ballad]] being performed (''canzone''), and varied little in terms of its theme<U+2014>typically a [[Anthropomorphism|personification]] of the poem, with a request for it to deliver instructions from the poet.<ref name="Levin 1984, p. 299.">Levin 1984, p. 299.</ref> The ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'', a thirteenth-century literary movement in Italian Renaissance poetry, deployed the stanza form in their ''[[ballata]]'' and [[sonnet]]s. The movement's principal figures<U+2014>Dante and [[Giovanni Cavalcanti (poet)|Cavalcanti]]<U+2014>extended the use of the tornada throughout an entire poem, as opposed to being used as a concluding stanza.<ref name="Levin 1984, pp. 299<U+2013>300.">Levin 1984, pp. 299<U+2013>300.</ref> In his poem "Sonetto, se Meuccio t<U+2019><U+00E8> mostrato", Dante personifies the poem as a "little messenger boy":<ref name="Levin 1984, p. 301.">Levin 1984, p. 301.</ref>

As the form developed, the purpose of the tornada evolved from a purely stylistic device to include emotional aspects; Levin summarises that "[the tornada] developed in the Italian lyric from a simple concluding formula to a sophisticated projection of the poet's message through the medium of a human character."<ref name="Levin 1984, p. 308">Levin 1984, p. 308</ref> Whereas tornadas had primarily been an extension of the poet's voice, the innovation of the Dolce Stil Novo movement was to provide them with an autonomous human voice, often in the form of a unique character.<ref name="Levin 1984, pp. 300<U+2013>301.">Levin 1984, pp. 300<U+2013>301.</ref>
