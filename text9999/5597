Walker, Jr.]] before becoming a federal attorney, serving as assistant U.S. attorney for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] for three years. In 1994, he moved into comedy writing when he was hired for ''[[The Simpsons]]'', writing seven episodes of the show including "[[Mother Simpson]]". He moved on to become [[showrunner]] and [[executive producer]] of ''[[King of the Hill]]'' before creating the sitcom ''[[A.U.S.A.]]''. He then worked on ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' before co-creating ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''. He was married to the novelist [[Mona Simpson (novelist)|Mona Simpson]].

==Early life and law career==
Appel was born May 21, 1963 in [[New York City]],<ref name=media>{{cite news|title=The comic appeal of Rich Appel|work=Electronic Media|author=Freeman, Michael|pages=16<U+2013>17|date=2002-11-11}}</ref><ref name=bite>{{cite news|title=Rich Appel takes a bite out of showbiz|date=2003-01-26|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=1}}</ref> to Nina and [[Alfred Appel]].<ref name=prime/> His mother was a lawyer, taught law and served as dean of [[Loyola University Chicago]]'s law school from 1983<U+2013>2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luc.edu/law/faculty/appel.html|title=Nina S.

Appel became interested in comedy from a young age, noting: "I grew up watching ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' and always thought that what [[Rob Petrie]] did for a living was what I wanted to do." His father introduced him to the works of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]] and encouraged him to "read comic books and watch quality television",<ref name=bite/> while he and a friend produced parody adverts and news pieces with a [[Betamax]] and often engaged in prank phone calls. At high school he wrote sketches and routines and dreamt of being a comedy writer, but "didn't know anyone who did it, and it didn't seem like a career that was open to me."<ref name=prime/>

He attended [[Harvard University]] and wrote for the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'', alongside [[Conan O'Brien]] and [[Greg Daniels]], both of whom he beat for the chance to give the comic graduation speech, the Ivy Oration. [[Tad Friend]] noted: "Everyone thought it would be Conan automatically, but Rich's speech was funny and self-deprecating, in a way that was both silly and profound."<ref name=prime/> After graduating in 1985 with a degree in history and literature<ref>{{cite news|title=From Harvard to Hollywood - Ivy Leaguers are now writing TV sitcoms|work=[[The Deseret News]]|date=1997-12-02|author=Sterngold, James|page=C10}}</ref> he attended [[Harvard Law School]] rather than moving into comedy, "appealed" by the idea of following his mother and grandfathers in to the legal profession. He then, for two years, worked as a law clerk for federal justice [[John M. Walker, Jr.]] at the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], working on the trials of people such as [[Michael Milken]] and [[Leona Helmsley]]. Subsequently, for three years from 1990, Appel served as assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Fellow attorney Geoffrey Berman stated Appel "was an excellent lawyer. He was good on his feet, articulate, with a sense of the law that was common-sensical, more intuitive than based on books." Appel still harboured dreams of becoming a comedy writer despite the security working as a lawyer offered him, but in 1993 after his wife became pregnant Appel was "reminde[d] that this was [his] life and [he] could shape it." Three months later Appel got an agent, had written and submitted two spec-scripts and moved to California.<ref name=bite/><ref name=prime>{{cite news|title=In His Prime Time|date=1998-12-06|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Ulin, David L.|page=14}}</ref>

When starting out as a comedy writer, Appel recalled: "One reason I caught up to my contemporaries is that when I started to send out my scripts, the idea that I'd been on the ''Lampoon'', even 8 or 10 years before, was a credential I could use."<ref name=prime/> Appel got his first television job when [[David Mirkin]] hired him for the writing staff of ''The Simpsons'' in 1994, initially on a ten-week contract,<ref name=bite/> and served as a writer and producer there for four years.<ref name=media/><ref name=hr/> There, he wrote seven episodes, often employing the use of "joke sequences, a narrative approach to humor that eschews the quick laugh in favor of something that develops over time."<ref name=prime/> Appel found work on ''The Simpsons'' to be a learning curve because it was a "very tough show to write for."<ref name=bite/> His first episode was [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven's]] "[[Mother Simpson]]". Appel was desperately trying to think of a story idea to show and decided that he had to really reach out and opted to do something about [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. He named her [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona Simpson]], after his wife.<ref name="Appel"/> Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced.<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "Mother Simpson"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The writers used the episode to solve several little puzzles, such as where [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s intelligence came from.<ref name="Appel"/> Also for season seven he penned "[[Bart on the Road]]", in which he utilized the plot devices of "go to work with you parents day" and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] getting a driving license,<ref name="Appel2">{{cite video | people=Appel, Richard|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "Bart on the Road"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and contributed to the episode "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]"; the two segments he wrote for the episode (one about [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], the other about [[Lionel Hutz]]) were both cut.<ref name=Appel3>{{cite video | people=Appel, Richard|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Appel wrote two episodes from [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]], "[[Bart After Dark]]" and "[[The Secret War of Lisa Simpson]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season8/page5.shtml|title=Bart After Dark|year=2000|publisher=[[BBC]]|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season8/page25.shtml|title=The Secret War of Lisa Simpson|year=2000|publisher=[[BBC]]|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> as well as [[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine's]] "[[The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons]]" and [[The Simpsons (season 10)|season 10's]] "[[When You Dish Upon A Star]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season9/page7.shtml|title=The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons|year=2000|publisher=[[BBC]]|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season10/page4.shtml|title=When You Dish Upon A Star|year=2000|publisher=[[BBC]]|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>

Daniels hired Appel as executive producer and showrunner on ''[[King of the Hill]]'' in 1997, leading the show's writing process and overseeing all aspects of the show. Daniel's noted: "It was essential that Rich was a good writer who could deal with people, who could help manage the business in the room. But equally important was the fact that he was someone I could trust, who had a similar sense of taste and values."<ref name=prime/> He stayed until 2001.<ref name=bite/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/tv/cover-story-hear-the-one-about-the-funny-lawyer.html?pagewanted=all|title=Hear the One About the Funny Lawyer?|author=Hart, Hugh|date=2003-03-02|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> For his work on ''The Simpsons'' and ''King of the Hill'', Appel won three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=Richard+Appel&program=&start_year=1950&end_year=2009&network=All&web_category=All&winner=All|title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search|publisher=Emmys.org|accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref> Appel created the short-lived series ''[[A.U.S.A.]]'', which aired in 2003, which he based on his own experiences as a U.S. assistant attorney.<ref name=awful>{{cite news|title='A.U.S.A' is awful|work=[[The Deseret News]]|date=2003-02-03|author=Pierce, Scott D.|page=C08}}</ref> He conceived it in 2001 and [[NBC]] ordered 13 episodes the following year; the show's original pilot used a [[single-camera setup]] but the NBC's executives felt it would have more appeal as a [[multiple-camera setup]], so it was re-shot.<ref name=media/> Appel noted of the show: "There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows maybe have something to prove to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. My own experience has been fortunate. I haven't felt that. But I know it exists."<ref name=bite/> He was inspired by the comedic side of working as a lawyer when writing the show: "Whether you're working on a case that you're proud to tell you mother and grandmother about, you're still going to encounter possibly really shifty dishonest lawyers, or a judge who is a little crazy, or witnesses who self-destruct on the stand."<ref>{{cite news|title=A comedy writer in Uncle Sam's court - Producer of 'A.U.S.A.' knows how to spoof the feds -- he was one|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2003-02-03|author=Walker, Dave|page=Living 01}}</ref> The show was not acclaimed: Scott D.
