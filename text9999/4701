This is a '''list of temples operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''', in chronological order. In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], also called the Mormon Church, a [[temple (Mormonism)|temple]] is a building dedicated to be a House of the [[Lord]], and considered by Church members to be the most sacred structures on earth.</onlyinclude> Upon completion, temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time (an "Open House"), and then they are dedicated as a "House of the Lord," after which only members in good standing are permitted entrance, thus they are not churches but rather places of worship. {{LDS Temple status}}

Within temples, members of the Church make [[Covenant (theology)|covenants]], receive instructions, and perform sacred  [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]], such as: [[baptism for the dead]], [[washing and anointing]] (or "initiatory" ordinances), the "[[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]]," and [[Celestial marriage|eternal marriage]] [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealings]]. Ordinances are a vital part of the theology of the church, which teaches that they were practiced by the Lord's covenant people in all [[Dispensationalist theology|dispensations]]. Additionally, members consider the temple a place to [[Direct Revelation|commune with God]], seek God<U+2019>s aid, understand the will of God, and receive [[Revelation#Latter Day Saint concept of revelation|personal revelation]]. 

==History==
In 1832, shortly after the formation of the Church, [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] said that the Lord desired the [[Latter-day Saints|saints]] build a temple;<ref>Recorded in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], Smith wrote that the Lord commanded the Saints to "establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;" (see {{lds|D&C|dc|88|119|120}})</ref> and they completed the [[Kirtland Temple]] in 1836. Initially, the Church constructed temples in areas where there were large concentrations of members: Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Hawai'i (all in the USA), and Alberta (Canada). In the mid 20th century, because of the importance of temples in the theology, the Church tried to balance density with the travel requirements that attending the temple imposed upon members. Thus, temples were built in Europe (Switzerland-1955 and England-1958); the Pacific Islands (New Zealand-1958); and Washington, D.C. (1974 - first American temple East of Utah since [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo]] in 1846) when membership alone might not have justified the effort. 

In the 1980s, [[Spencer W. Kimball]] directed the Church to build smaller temples according to standardized plans<ref>Before this time, all but the Switzerland temple were at least 45,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (4,100&nbsp;m<U+00B2>), and the average size of the first 20 temples was 103,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (9,600&nbsp;m<U+00B2>). The new temples varied in size but were generally less than 25,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (2,300&nbsp;m<U+00B2>). By comparison, the Nauvoo temple, built in the 1840s, was 54,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (5,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>). Some of these temples have been remodeled since the original construction to provide additional rooms.</ref> allowing temples to be built where there were fewer members. As a result the first temples in South America (Brazil-1978); Asia (Japan-1980); and Central America (Mexico City-1983) were built and the number of temples doubled from 15 to 36. Current [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)#Presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|church president]] and [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophet]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] has also accelerated the construction of temples through the use of an even smaller standardized base design.<ref>Hinckley announced the use of smaller standardized temples in 1997({{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,49-1-32-20,00.html |title=Some Thoughts on Temples, Retention of Converts, and Missionary Service |accessdate=2006-10-30 |author=Gordon B. Hinckley |authorlink=Gordon B. Hinckley |work=167th Semiannual General Conference, October 1997 }}). The base design is about 10,700&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (1,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>), and temples built from the design are generally between 10,000 and 18,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (900 and 1,700&nbsp;m<U+00B2>). These temples generally do not include a large laundry facility, provide members with the ability to rent temple clothing, or provide a cafeteria for patrons (Almanac, 2000).</ref>
In 1998 when there were only 51 temples, Hinckley set a goal to have 100 temples before 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,49-1-26-35,00.html |title=New Temples to Provide "Crowning Blessings" of the Gospel |accessdate=2006-10-30 |author=Gordon B. Hinckley |authorlink=Gordon B. Hinckley |work=168th Annual General Conference, April 1998 }}</ref>
The effort succeeded with 102 before 2001. During Hinckley's service as president, the number of temples has more than doubled from 47 to 124.<ref>Because the two prior [[President of the Church (Mormonism)#Presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Presidents of the Church]] before Hinckley (Kimball and [[Ezra Taft Benson]]) had incapacitating illnesses during the latter part of their service as prophet, Hinckley has dedicated a total of 84 temples, even though, during his presidency, 14 temples were dedicated by others: [[James E. Faust]]&nbsp;(7), [[Thomas S. Monson]]&nbsp;(6), and [[Boyd K. Packer]]&nbsp;(1).</ref>
