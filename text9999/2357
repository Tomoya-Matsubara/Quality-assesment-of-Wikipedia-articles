==Election history==
Facing challenges from the Democrats, the team of [[Peter McDonough]] in the Senate and [[Donald DiFrancesco]] and [[William J. Maguire]] in the Assembly won re-election in 1977.<ref>Narvaez, Alfonso A. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C13F6355B167493C2A8178BD95F438785F9 "G.O.P. Expected to Maintain Strength In Morris, Union and Essex Counties"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 10, 1977. Accessed July 22, 2010.</ref>
In the wake of redistricting following the [[1980 United States Census]], McDonough chose not to run for re-election, setting off a 1981 primary battle between Assemblymembers DiFrancesco and Maguire. DiFrancesco won the Senate seat while [[Bob Franks]] and [[Maureen Ogden]] won election in the Assembly.<ref>Edge, Wally. [http://vip.politickernj.com/wallye/38277/bob-franks-story "The Bob Franks Story"], [[Politicker Network|PolitickerNJ.com]], April 11, 2010. Accessed July 22, 2010.</ref>

In redistricting following the [[1990 United States Census]], [[Maureen Ogden]] was switched to the 21st District, where she won election to the Assembly, and [[Richard Bagger]] won the now-vacant ballot spot in the 22nd District.

[[Alan Augustine]] left office as of March 31, 2001, just several weeks before his death, due to health problems, and was succeeded by [[Thomas Kean, Jr.]]<ref>Bowman, Bill. [http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030927/NEWS/70821078 "Ex-governor's son swims upstream"], ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'', September 27, 2003. Accessed July 22, 2010. "Kean, who was appointed to the Assembly in March 2001 upon the resignation of the late Alan Augustine, won re-election in 2001. He was appointed to his 21st District Senate seat earlier this year after the resignation of Richard H. Bagger."</ref>

As of January 21, 2001, DiFrancesco became the 51st [[Governor of New Jersey]] after [[Christine Todd Whitman]] left office to become [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]], with DiFrancesco simultaneously holding his post as Senate President. In the [[New Jersey Legislative Districts, 2001 redistricting|2001 redistricting]] following the [[2000 United States Census]], several of the suburban, Republican-leaning municipalities in the district were replaced by Linden, Plainfield and Rahway, which gave the district a distinct Democratic tilt. Bagger and Kean were relocated to the 21st District and the three legislative seats were taken by Democrats [[Joseph Suliga]] in the Senate and [[Jerry Green (politician)|Jerry Green]] and [[Linda Stender]] in the Assembly.

Suliga did not run for re-election in 2003 after a scandal involving his alleged drunken sexual harassment of a woman in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. He resigned and entered rehabilitation for alcoholism and was replaced on the ballot and in the Senate by fellow Linden Democrat [[Nicholas Scutari]].<ref>via [[Associated Press]]. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-85478685.html "Democrats allowed to substitute candidate -- Union state senator quit after his arrest"], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', October 4, 2003. Accessed July 22, 2010. "Democratic leaders named Nicholas P. Scutari to replace Sen. Joseph Suliga, D-Union, who dropped out of the 22nd District election race last week to seek treatment for 'an alcohol-related problem.'"</ref>
