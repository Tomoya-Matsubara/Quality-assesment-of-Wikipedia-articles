'''The Cobra Group or Appco group''' is a [[door-to-door]] selling and marketing company headquartered in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="businessweek">[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=23110234 The Cobra Group plc - Company Overview]. ''[[Business Week]]''. Retrieved on 2008-07-21.</ref> It generally uses [[multi-level marketing]] strategy.

The company is based in [[London]], [[UK]] and [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and has an affiliate network of legally independent sales companies in 25 countries throughout Europe and Asia. The company was originally founded in Sydney as an offshoot of the now defunct American direct marketing company ''DS-Max'', and the founder was an employee of that group at the time Appco was founded. Appco has since shifted its main operations to the UK, and is also no longer formally associated with ''DS-Max'' or any of its currently existing partners. Despite this, Appco still controversially uses the same techniques established by [[parent company]] ''DS-Max''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wolfram.org/scam/ds_max/index.html |title= A detailed explanation of Ds-max, Cydcor and Granton Marketing |publisher=Wolfram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10}}</ref>

The Cobra Group represents firms in industries such as [[telecommunications]], home security, energy and financial services. The group is also contracted by some charitable organisations to collect donations in the form of a pledge and enlist new donors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090108032359/http://www.savethechildren.net/australia/corporate/cobra/cobra_school.html |title=Save the Children is Australia's leading independent emergency relief and development organisation for children.

==Responses within the community==
Although The Cobra Group is known for some contributions towards socially benevolent causes (such as work with ''[[Save the Children]]''), the organisation has also received negative press, including investigations by the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''<ref>[http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/investigations/2005/08/just-6-for-eight-days-work-for.html ]{{Daily Mirror}}</ref> and the ''[[BBC]]''. The BBC found misleading practices by representatives, leading the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] Energy Select Committee to release a report<ref>{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmberr/32/3206.htm |title=House of Commons - Business and Enterprise - First Report |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2008-12-15 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref> threatening to ban energy companies from using [[direct sales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/home/shutting-the-door-on-doorstep-salesmen/2061883.article |title=Shutting the door on doorstep salesmen &#124; Archive |publisher=Marketing Week |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref> Video footage from past investigations offers proof of Cobra Group contracted companies participating in bad practices such as lying to potential customers, and according to this report (in which the Cobra group is specifically named) the year 2002 saw 12000 consumer complaints against salespeople in this industry. Some past and current sales people for the company have also commented on questionable sales methods and the repercussions for the salespeople involved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series4/rogue_salesman.shtml |title=BBC Inside Out - Rogue salespeople |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2003-10-13 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref>

==Sponsorship==
The Cobra Group (and founder Chris Niarchos) have [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] various types of [[motorsports]] drivers since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportsjournal.com/archives/2008/01/sky_to_sponsor.php |title=Sky To Sponsor Cr Scuderia |publisher=Motorsports Journal |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=277559&FS=BGTC-- |title=GT: BGTC: Media giant Sky to sponsor CR Scuderia &#124; News |publisher=Motorsport.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref> Chris Niarchos, through the Cobra Group, partnered with Andrew Kirkaldy in 2006 to the form the [[United Kingdom|British]] racing team then known as "AKA Cobra". This partnership led to the formation of [[CRS Racing]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crscuderia.com/crs/1-about.php?sectionnumber=1 |title=crscuderia.com |publisher=crscuderia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref>

==Legal issues==

Some examples of the ill-treatment of workers in companies contracted by the Cobra Group are documented in a successful [[unfair dismissal]] case in [[Ireland]] in 2008. A Zimbabwean woman was awarded <U+20AC>50000 by the [[Equality Tribunal]] after successful [[litigation]] against her former employer Steven Broadey of Boss Worldwide Promotions Ltd. (BWPL). The payment ordered by the equality officer responsible for the case was for [[financial compensation|compensation]] of <U+20AC>5000 for "[[harassment]] and [[discriminatory]] treatment" and another <U+20AC>45000 compensation for discriminatory dismissal.<ref>[http://www.equalitytribunal.ie/index.asp?locID=120&docID=1680 ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> The main argument used by Broadey in defending his case was that the worker in question had been a [[self-employed]] [[sole trader]] and not actually an [[employee]] of his company. Prior to the dismissal the worker in question had been lauded as the highest [[fundraiser]] within Boss Worldwide Promotions Ltd, and was given a positive mention in Cobra Group promotional literature for this reason.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shanahan |first=Catherine |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2008/0115/world/50000-for-unfairly-dismissed-woman-52617.html |title=<U+20AC>50,000 for unfairly dismissed woman &#124; Irish Examiner |publisher=Archives.tcm.ie |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref>
