===Operation ''Torch''===
Embarking 5,600 army troops and sailors, on 2 November 1942 ''Hermitage'' departed [[New York]] with her skipper acting as convoy commodore. Six days later the [[Operation Torch|North African invasion]] began, and ''Hermitage'' on 10<U+2013>25 November debarked her passengers at [[Casablanca]] to participate in the momentous campaign. Returning to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] 11 December, ''Hermitage'' next headed for the [[Pacific]] with nearly 6,000 passengers embarked. After embarking and debarking passengers at Balboa, [[Noumea]], [[Brisbane]], [[Sydney]], [[Pago Pago]], and [[Honolulu]], the former luxury liner put in at [[San Francisco]] 2 March 1943.

===Pacific operations===
''Hermitage'''s next swing westward, begun 27 March took her to [[Wellington, New Zealand]]; [[Melbourne]]; and [[Bombay]]. At Bombay she embarked some 707 Polish refugees, including nearly a hundred children, for a voyage back to [[California]] which ended 25 June. In the next year ''Hermitage'' made three similar cruises through the South Pacific, with battle-bound marines, soldiers and sailors, civilians, and [[China|Chinese]] and [[India]]n refugees among her diversified passengers. ''Hermitage'' reached New York 28 May from the South Pacific via Noumea, [[Goodenough Island]], and the Panama Canal.

===Operation ''Overlord''===
Departing New York 16 June 1944 with over 6,000 passengers, most of them bound for the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of Europe]] just begun at [[Normandy]], ''Hermitage'' sailed to [[Liverpool]] and Belfast to debark the troops before returning to New York 12 July. From then until the end of the war she made 10 more such voyages, principally to [[Le Havre]], to bring replacements to the [[Europe]]an theater and transport wounded [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers and [[prisoners of war]] back to the States. [[V-E Day]], 8 May 1945, found ''Hermitage'' part of the celebration in Le Havre harbor as Allied ships greeted the end of 6 years of war with a cacophony of bells, whistles and sirens screaming through air illuminated by hundreds of signal flares and rockets.

On that ship that day was 23 year old Eileen Mary (Leeburn) Kelley and her 4 month old son.   They sailed for Boston.   For 68 years I have been searching for our fellow passengers. What are the chances that any are reading these words?  Terence Kelley

===After hostilities===
War's end did not mean the end of ''Hermitage'''s duty as she continued to cross the [[Atlantic]], this time bringing veterans home through December. Departing New York 12 December, the well-traveled transport sailed to [[Nagoya, Japan]] to embark some 6,000 homeward bound veterans and return to [[Seattle]] 4 February 1946. Assigned to the San Francisco-[[Marianas]] run for [[Operation Magic Carpet|Operation ''Magic Carpet'']], the return of thousands of Pacific troops, she made three further voyages before decommissioning at San Francisco 20 August 1946.

===Summary of WWII service===
While serving with the Navy, the former luxury liner had sailed approximately 230,000 miles and transported 129,695 passengers, including [[United States|American]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Australia]]n, [[France|French]], and [[Netherlands]] fighting men as well as Chinese, American, [[Poland|Polish]], and British civilians and [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|talian]] prisoners.

==Postwar career==
''Hermitage'' was returned to the Italian Government in May 1947 and renamed ''SS Conte Biancamano'', after which she served once more as a passenger liner until being retired in 1960. During her 1961 scrapping at the Italian port of La Spezia, her bridge superstructure was disassembled and shipped to the [[Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia "Leonardo da Vinci"|Museo della Scienza]] in Milano.<ref>[http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/navali_biancamano.asp ''SS Conte Biancamano''], Museo Scienza website.</ref> This three-storey structure was reassembled inside a new pavilion and includes the pilot house, a few first-class cabins, and a circular ballroom.<ref>[[SS Conte Biancamano|Wikipedia ''SS Conte Biancamano'' article]]</ref>
