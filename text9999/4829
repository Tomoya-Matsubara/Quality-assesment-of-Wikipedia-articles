==Early life==
Born to [[missionary]] parents in [[Japan]], Taylor lived in that country until he was 16 years old. His parents were conventional [[Liberalism|liberals]], and so was he until the age of 30.<ref>[http://amren.com/interviews/RNInterview.htm American Renaissance<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1973 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Philosophy]], and graduated from ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences Po)'' in 1978 with a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|MA]] in  [[International economics]]. Taylor speaks fluent [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[French language|French]]. In the 1980s, Taylor was West Coast editor of [[PC Magazine]] and a consultant before founding the ''American Renaissance'' periodical in 1990.  Taylor has taught Japanese to [[summer school]] students at [[Harvard University]].

==Books==
He is the author of ''Shadows of the Rising Sun: A Critical View of the Japanese Miracle'' (1983) ISBN 0-688-02455-6, in which he wrote that Japan was not an appropriate economic or social model for the United States, and criticized the Japanese for excessive preoccupation with their own uniqueness.

Taylor first turned to race in ''Paved With Good Intentions: The Failure of Race Relations in Contemporary America'' (1993) ISBN 0-9656383-4-0,<ref>[http://www.amren.com/store/paved_with_good.html Paved with Good Intentions, by Jared Taylor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in which he argued that racism is no longer a convincing excuse for high black rates of crime, poverty, and school failure. He also edited ''The Real American Dilemma: Race, Immigration, and the Future of America'', (1998) ISBN 0-9656383-0-8.<ref>[http://www.amren.com/store/real_american_dilemma.html The Real American Dilemma, edited by Jared Taylor (0965638308)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Taylor supervised preparation of the New Century Foundation monograph, ''The Color of Crime'' (1998, 2005), which cites government statistics showing that blacks and Hispanics commit violent crimes at considerably higher rates than whites, and Asians at lower rates than whites.<ref>http://www.amren.com/newstore/cart.php?page=color_of_crime</ref> He is the main contributor to a collection of articles from ''American Renaissance'' magazine called ''A Race Against Time: Racial Heresies for the 21st Century'', (2003) ISBN 0-9656383-2-4<ref>[http://www.amren.com/store/race_against_time.html A Race Against Time (0965638324)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and editor of a collection of essays by the late [[Samuel Francis]] entitled ''Essential Writings on Race,'' (2007) ISBN 978-0-9656383-7-1.<ref>[http://www.amren.com/store/essential_writings.html Essential Writings on Race, by Sam Francis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Views==
Taylor has summarized the basis for his views in the following terms:

<blockquote>Race is an important aspect of individual and group identity. Of all the fault lines that divide society<U+2014>language, religion, class, ideology<U+2014>it is the most prominent and divisive. Race and racial conflict are at the heart of the most serious challenges the Western World faces in the 21st century... Attempts to gloss over the significance of race or even to deny its reality only make problems worse.<ref>[http://amren.com/siteinfo/index.html About American Renaissance]</ref></blockquote>

He has questioned the capacity of blacks to live successfully in a civilized society. In an article on the chaos in [[New Orleans]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]], Taylor wrote "when blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western Civilization<U+2014>any kind of civilization<U+2014>disappears. And in a crisis, civilization disappears overnight."<ref>[http://www.amren.com/mtnews/archives/2005/09/africa_in_our_m.php American Renaissance News: Africa in our Midst: Lessons from Katrina<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Taylor believes in the direct link between [[race and intelligence]], where blacks are generally less intelligent than whites, and whites are generally less intelligent than East Asians, as expressed in ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. Taylor has said in an interview:

<blockquote>I think Asians are objectively superior to Whites by just about any measure that you can come up with in terms of what are the ingredients for a successful society. This doesn't mean that I want America to become Asian. I think every people has a right to be itself, and this becomes clear whether we're talking about Irian Jaya or Tibet, for that matter.<ref>Carol Miller Swain & Russell Nieli, ''Contemporary Voices of White Nationalism in America'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 102.</ref></blockquote>

Taylor has described himself as a "[[race realist]]",<ref name=white>{{cite web|url=http://www.amren.com/mtnews/archives/2010/07/race_realist_ja.php|title=Race Realist Jared Taylor Declares the Civil Rights Struggle Was Won Long Ago|first=Jared|last=Taylor|publisher=[[amren.com]]|date=July 20, 2010|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref> and espouses a program of [[white nationalism]].

Taylor has made remarks on the growing number of non-whites in [[Europe]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Australia]]. On the greater number of non-whites in [[Holland]] compared with [[Denmark]], Taylor has commented; "Europeans travel a lot within Europe, and they see dark-skinned bums sleeping on the streets [in] [[Rotterdam]]. In Denmark they don't see dark-skinned bums sleeping on the streets, and they are not so stupid as to be unable to understand that immigration has something to do with this."<ref>[http://www.amren.com/news/news04/02/27/jtconf2004talk.html American Renaissance News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In January 2005, Taylor reviewed a book by Frank Salter, ''On Genetic Interests: Family, Ethnicity and Humanity in an Age of Mass Migration'', and agreed with Salter that, from an exclusively genetic point of view, an Englishman would be better off resisting the immigration of two hypothetical Bantu immigrants, than he would be to rescue one of his own children from drowning. He also noted that this was an "extreme" conclusion.<ref>[http://www.amren.com/mtnews/archives/2007/05/what_we_owe_our.php American Renaissance News: What We Owe Our People<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Taylor has also given support to [[Hans Hoppe]]'s attempts to persuade [[libertarian]]s to oppose immigration; he generally approves of Hoppe's work, although he sees the pursuit of a society with no government at all to be "the sort of experiment one might prefer to watch in a foreign country before attempting it oneself".<ref>[http://www.vdare.com/taylor/hoppe.htm VDARE.com: 12/28/01 - Democracy vs. Freedom (And The Nation-State)? by Jared Taylor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In a speech delivered on May 28, 2005, to the British self-determination group, ''Sovereignty'', Taylor said of his personal feelings to interracial marriages, "I want my grandchildren to look like my grandparents. I don't want them to look like [[Anwar Sadat]] or [[Fu Manchu]] or [[Whoopi Goldberg]]."<ref>[http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/demog3.html Demographic Change In White Western European World Uk Usa<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Taylor is somewhat unique among American white nationalists for his opposition to [[anti-semitism]]. In his 1983 book ''Shadows of the Rising Sun'' , he denounced [[imperial Japanese]] [[links]] to [[Nazi Germany]]. At the ''American Renessiance'' group's very first conference, held in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] in 1994, [[rabbi]] Mayer Schiller was the dinner speaker. In 1997, he removed [[Holocaust deniers]] and [[neo-Nazis]] off the groups' e-mail list.<ref name=differences/>

==Praise and criticism==
{{POV|date=April 2011}}
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] describes Taylor as "a courtly presenter of ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacist <U+2014> a kind of modern-day version of the refined but racist colonialist of old."<ref>http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/profiles/jared-taylor</ref> A 2005 feature in the [[Pittsburg Post Gazette]] described Taylor as "a racist in the guise of expert"<ref>Dennis Roddy "Jared Taylor, a Racist in the Guise of 'Expert'" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) Sunday, January 23, 2005 [http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0123-02.htm]</ref>

[[Paul Gottfried]], professor of humanities at Elizabethtown College, also disagrees with what he calls "the value of white nationalism," but writes: "In comparison to the generally shabby lot of journalists I have known, Jared is a true paragon of tolerance." He also notes what he calls Taylor's "classical liberal sense of fair play."<ref>[http://www.amren.com/mtnews/archives/2008/07/paul_gottfried.php Paul Gottfried Replies to His Critics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Mark Potok]] and Heidi Beirich, writers in the ''[[Intelligence Report]]'' (a publication of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]), has written that "Jared Taylor is the cultivated, cosmopolitan face of white supremacy. He is the guy who is providing the intellectual heft, in effect, to modern-day [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansmen]]." He has also stated that "''American Renaissance'' has become increasingly important over the years, bringing a measure of intellectualism and seriousness to the typically thug-dominated world of white supremacy".<ref name=differences>{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=644&printable=1|title=Schism Threatens White Nationalist Group|publisher=''[[Intelligence Report]]''|date=Summer 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2010|author=[[Mark Potok]] and Heidi Beirich}}</ref>
