The '''2006 Manchester, New Hampshire police shooting''' was an incident that took place on [[October 16]], [[2006]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], [[United States]]. The incident occurred when [[police officer]] Michael Briggs was shot while on duty. Briggs was later transported to the [[hospital]] before dying of his injuries. The suspect, Michael "Styx" Addison, fled the state of [[New Hampshire]], prompting a [[manhunt]] by police. 15 hours after the shooting, Addison was arrested in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]] and was extradited back to New Hampshire.<ref name="c">{{cite web|author=New Hampshire Police Association|title=Officer Michael Briggs|accessdate=2006-12-07|url=http://www.nhpolice.com/memorial/Briggs.htm}}</ref> Addison was charged with the shooting of Michael Briggs and fleeing police.

A week after the shooting, a memorial service was held on [[October 21]], [[2006]], and state and local politicians and various charity organizations expressed their condolences to the Briggs family and the community of Manchester. In January 2007, the [[Manchester Police Department]] retired Michael Briggs' badge number in honor of the fallen officer. In March 2007 a trial date for Addison was set for early September of 2008. 

The capital murder trial of Michael Addison was the first for the state of [[New Hampshire]] since Gordon E. Perry was indicted for capital murder charges for the shooting of Officer Jeremy Charron.

==Background==
===Michael Briggs===
Michael Briggs (1971-2006) was born in [[Epsom, New Hampshire]], and served in the [[United States Marines]] from 1991-1995 after graduating from [[Pembroke Academy]] in 1990. From 1995-2001 he worked as a correctional officer and police officer for the [[Epsom Police Department]]. On [[May 2]], [[2001]], Briggs became a police officer for the Manchester Police Department and was assigned as a bicycle police officer. Briggs graduated from the [[New Hampshire Police Academy]] in November 2001. In 2004, he received a life-saving medal after saving residents from a burning building. He was awarded the [[Congressional Law Enforcement Award]] in October 2005 for the same actions. Briggs was a member of the [[New Hampshire Police Association]] and friend and co-worker of Jeremy Charron, who died in 1997. <ref name="a"/><ref>{{cite web|author=WMUR|year=2006|title=Biography of Officer Michael Briggs|accessdate=2006-12-07|url=http://www.wmur.com/news/10095475/detail.html}}</ref><ref name="c"/>

===Michael "Styx" Addison===
Michael "Styx" Addison (b. 1980) was a resident of Manchester, New Hampshire. Before the [[October 16]], [[2006]] shooting, Addison had previous run-ins with the police. In 1997, Addison was charged with [[assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]] after an armed robbery attempt, that resulted in Addison being sentenced 2-3 years in prison for that crime and three years of probation upon his release on his 21st birthday. In 2000, however, Addison was sentenced to jail again for violating his probation. In October 2003, Addison was arrested in Londonderry, NH, and charged with false imprisonment.<ref name="addison">{{cite web|author=Kathryn Marchocki|title=Addison has violent past|publisher=New Hampshire Union Leader|accessdate=2006-12-15|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Addison+has+violent+past&articleId=c6894d38-f1ab-4801-bdfc-4f9b7e5e17e7}}</ref> A month later, Addison pled guilty to [[criminal restraint]], a misdemeanor, in the dispute over drug money.

Addison is the adopted son of Lucious Addison, a disabled Viet Nam veteran, and was primarily reared by his grandmother in North Carolina.<ref>{{cite web|author=Laurel Sweet and Liz Fiandaca|year=2006|title=Addison's family had high hopes for him|publisher=New Hampshire Union Leader|accessdate=2007-02-09|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Addison%27s+family+had+high+hopes+for+him&articleId=201a47a9-3a75-49be-b02e-8d3d0152a213}}</ref>Many family relatives described him as a loving and responsible parent to his son despite his criminal record.

==October 16, 2006 Shooting==
On [[October 16]], [[2006]], Officer Michael Briggs and his partner John Breckenridge were responding to a domestic disturbance call involving Addison and Antonie Bell-Rodgers. When the two officers spotted the suspects, Briggs ordered them to stop. Bell-Rodgers stopped but Addison continued walking away. When Officer Briggs commanded Addison to stop, Addison turned and shot Briggs. Bell-Rodgers surrendered to police but Addison fled the [[crime scene]]. Later, police found Addison's gun and t-shirt.<ref name="ph">{{cite web|author=Seacoast Online|year=2006|title=Capital murder case goes forward|publisher=Portsmouth Herald|accessdate=2006-12-15|url=http://www.yorkweekly.com/news/11182006/nhnews-ph-nh-officershot.html}}</ref> In a court reenactment, eyewitnesses claimed that moments before the shooting, they saw a dark gray van and two men jumping out of it and running north towards [[Lincoln Street]] where the shooting took place. <ref>{{cite web|author=Pat Grossmith|year=2007|title=Charges upgraded to capital murder|publisher=New Hampshire Union Leader|accessdate=2007-02-06|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Charges+upgraded+to+capital+murder&articleId=1b2e1a99-9344-4bd0-9605-37fdee955e1d}}</ref>

A [[manhunt]] was launched after the shooting, as [[SWAT]] teams and local police searched throughout the city of Manchester looking for Addison. A SWAT team showed up at an apartment building where Addison's girlfriend Angela Swist lived and found clothing stained with blood in a [[bathtub]] and a bottle of bleach nearby and questioned Swist.

===Extradition and charges===
Addison was extradited back to New Hampshire<ref name="c"/> and denied his role in the murder. During a taped interview, Addison told his story six different times before confessing to authorities that he shot at the police officers coming towards him.<ref name="ull"/> The [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester District Court]] charged Addison with [[capital murder]]. <ref name="rutland">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=2006|title=Officer once gave first aid to his accused killer|publisher=Rutland Herald|accessdate=2007-02-06|url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061020/NEWS/610200328/1004/NEWS03}}</ref>As a result of the charge, prosecutors against Addison sought the [[death penalty]] as stated under [[Capital punishment in New Hampshire|New Hampshire state law]] that a murder of a police officer is punishable by death. <ref>{{cite web|author=Kathryn Marchocki|year=2007|title=Officer's Murder Described in Court Hearing|publisher=New Hampshire Union Leader|accessdate=2007-02-06|url=http://www.nhpolice.com/memorial/Briggs%20Murder.html}}</ref> Later Addison was also charged with [[armed robbery]], [[conspiracy]] and felony possession of a firearm in relation to a five day crime spree that started a week before the shooting.<ref name="ackrt">{{cite web|author=Kathryn Marchocki|year=2006|title=Accused cop killer returns to court|publisher=New Hampshire Union Leader|accessdate=2007-02-06|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Accused+cop+killer+returns+to+court&articleId=6203b588-3c0f-4cd8-8abd-070434aea6ed}}</ref>

===Investigation and further arrests===
An investigation conducted by local officials followed the shooting. During the investigation two women connected to Michael Addison turned themselves in to police after authorities issued [[Warrant (law)|warrants]]<U+2014> for their arrest and the fact that they were accused of robbing a [[7-Eleven]] store five days before the shooting. During an interview with police, one of the women, Angela Swist, told officers that she drove Addison and Anthonie Rodgers to the 7-Eleven on [[October 11]], where Addison and his accomplice robbed the store and fled. She also admitted that she was the driver of the get-away car. <ref name="wa">{{cite web|author=Son Hoang|year=2006|title=Women connected to Addison, Hudson robbery arraigned|publisher=New Hampshire Union Leader|accessdate=2007-02-07|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Women+connected+to+Addison%2c+Hudson+robbery+arraigned&articleId=f9c05470-3ca7-4453-816f-6b76cb85a198}}</ref>

Antoine Bell-Rogers, one of the men arrested at the scene of the [[October 16]], [[2006]] shooting, was charged with firing a [[handgun]] at an apartment and felony possession of a firearm but was not charged in connection with the shooting of officer Michael Briggs.

* [[March 23]], [[2007]]: Attorneys defending Michael Addison planned to contest the use of [[Capital punishment in New Hampshire|capital punishment]].
