==Etymology==
[[Image:Kenyon Corn Meal Company.jpg|thumb|right|Kenyon Corn Meal Company, a [[gristmill]] in [[Usquepaug, Rhode Island]].  The building shown was built in 1886, and company history dates from the early 1700s or earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/travel/explorene/rhodeisland/galleries/johnny_cakes/|title=Jonnycakes from the Kenyon Corn Meal Company|last=Meehan|first=Mary Beth|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=2008-11-06 | date=2 August 2006}}</ref>]]

===Johnnycake===
The earliest attestation of the term "johnny cake" is from 1739 (in South Carolina); the spelling "journey cake" is only attested from 1775 (on the Gulf coast), but may be the earlier form.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia

The word is likely based on the word "Jonakin," recorded in New England in 1765, itself derived from the word "jannock," recorded in Northern England in the sixteenth century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weir|first=Robert M.|coauthors=Karen Hess|title=The Carolina Rice Kitchen: The African Connection|publisher=U of South Carolina P|year=1998|page=125|isbn=9781570032080|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_yIJBQDY0H0C&pg=PA125|accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref> According to [[Edward Ellis Morris]], the term was the name given "by the [American] negroes to a cake made of Indian corn (maize)."<ref name="morris">{{cite book|last=Edward Ellis Morris|first=Edward Ellis Morris|title=Austral English: a dictionary of Australasian words, phrases, and usages, with those aboriginal-Australian and Maori words which have become incorporated in the language and the commoner scientific words that have had their origin in Australasia|publisher=Macmillan and Co|year=1898|pages=223<U+2013>24|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BL8CAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA223|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref>

===Shawnee cake===
Another suggested derivation is that it comes from ''Shawnee cake'' although some writers disagree.<ref>{{cite book|last=Randolph|first=Mary|title=The Virginia House-Wife|year=1824|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oszKiYe2RyAC&pg=PA277&dq=%22Shawnee+cake%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CISuT8-uEdSZ8gOR3q3WDQ&ved=0CGsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22Shawnee%20cake%22&f=false|page=277}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Stavley|first=Keith|title=America's Founding Food: The Story of New England Cooking|year=2004|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0807828946|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=PIiuT5T6DcPM0QWir8y3BA&id=xGzF54OaJE4C&dq=%22Shawnee+cake%22&q=shawnee#v=snippet&q=shawnee&f=false|coauthors=Kathleen Fitzgerald|page=34}}</ref>

===Hoecake===
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term hoecake first occurs in 1745, and the term is used by American writers such as [[Joel Barlow]] and [[Washington Irving]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia

Hoes designed for cotton fields were large and flat with a hole for the long handle to slide through; the blade would be removed and placed over a fire much like a [[griddle]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Austin|first=Daniel F.|title=Florida ethnobotany|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|page=731|isbn=9780849323324|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eS7lX_rC3GEC&pg=PA731|accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref>

==Origin==

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were using ground corn for cooking long before European explorers arrived in the New World. The johnnycake originates with the native inhabitants of Northern America; the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] of the [[Atlantic seaboard]] are credited with teaching Europeans how to make the food.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keane|first=Augustus Henry|authorlink=Augustus Henry Keane |title=The world's peoples: a popular account of their bodily & mental characters, beliefs, traditions, political and social institutions|publisher=G.

Southern [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture ([[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]]) is the "cornerstone" of Southern cuisine. From their culture came one of the main staples of the Southern diet: [[maize|corn]] (maize), either ground into meal or limed with an alkaline salt to make [[hominy]], also called masa, in a Native American technology known as [[nixtamalization]].<ref>
{{cite book
|title=The Cornbread Gospels |author=Dragonwagon, Crescent |publisher=Workman Publishing |year=2007

</ref> Corn was used to make all kinds of dishes from the familiar [[cornbread]] and [[grits]] to [[liquor]]s such as [[whiskey]] and [[moonshine]], which were important trade items. Cornbread was popular during the [[American Civil War]] because it was very cheap and could be made in many different sizes and forms.  It could be fashioned into high-rising, fluffy loaves or simply fried for a fast meal. 

<blockquote>
To a far greater degree than anyone realizes, several of the most important food dishes that the Southeastern Indians live on today is the "soul food" eaten by both black and white Southerners. Hominy, for example, is still eaten ... Sofkee live on as grits ... cornbread [is] used by Southern cooks ... Indian fritters ... variously known as "hoe cake", ... or "Johnny cake." ... Indian boiled cornbread is present in Southern cuisine as "corn meal dumplings", ... and as "hush puppies", ... Southerners cook their beans and field peas by boiling them, as did the Indians ... like the Indians they cure their meat and smoke it over hickory coals.<ref name=c_hudson>{{Cite book | last = Hudson | first = Charles | title = The Southeastern Indians | year = 1976 | publisher = The University of Tennessee Press | chapter = A Conquered People | pages = 498<U+2013>499 | isbn = 0-87049-248-9 }}</ref>

==Preparation==
Johnnycakes are a type of unleavened [[cornbread]] made of cornmeal (but see the Australian version below), salt, and water. The dough was set on a wooden board or barrel stave and placed at an angle in front of an open fire to bake.<ref name="vogel">"Johnny cake was baked on a board made for this purpose, about ten inches wide and fifteen inches long and rounding at the top. The thick corn dough was placed on the board which was set against a chunk of wood near the fire. After one side had been baked to a nice brown, the other side was treated the same way. The resulting cake was often delicious. If a johnny-cake board was not at hand, a hoe, without a handle, was cleaned and greased with bear's oil. The dough was baked on this metal surface and was called a hoe-cake." {{cite book|last=Vogel|first=William Frederick|title=Home Life in Early Indiana|year=1954|page=9|url=http://ia311317.us.archive.org/3/items/homelifeinearlyi00voge/homelifeinearlyi00voge.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref> Hoecake was traditionally cooked on a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]: "Hoe-Cake: A cake of Indian meal, baked before the fire.

In the American south during the 18th century versions were made with rice or hominy flour and perhaps cassava.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weir|first=Robert M.|coauthors=Karen Hess|title=The Carolina Rice Kitchen: The African Connection|publisher=U of South Carolina P|year=1998|page=127|isbn=9781570032080|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_yIJBQDY0H0C&pg=PA125|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref> A 1905 cookbook includes a recipe for "Alabama Johnny Cake" made with rice and 'meal'. <ref>{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Estelle Woods|title=The Original Buckeye Cook Book and Practical Housekeeping|year=1905|publisher=Reilly & Britton Company|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FUCucBKftisC&pg=PA31&dq=%E2%80%9CAlabama+Johnny+Cake%E2%80%9D&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pIWuT63aM8LL0QXs3vi_CQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CAlabama%20Johnny%20Cake%E2%80%9D&f=false|page=31}}</ref>

The difference between johnnycake and hoecake originally lay in the method of preparation, though today both are often cooked on a griddle or in a skillet. Some recipes call for baking johnnycakes in an oven,<ref>{{cite book|last=Dojny|first=Brooke|coauthors=Scott Dorrance|title=Dishing Up Maine: 165 Recipes That Capture Authentic Down East Flavors|publisher=Storey Publishing|year=2006|page=211|isbn=9781580178419|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Nw_m49ZJ-l0C&pg=PA211|accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref> similar to [[corn pone]]s which are still baked in the oven like they were traditionally.<ref>Hundley, ''Social Relations in Our Southern States,'' p. 87-88: "Corn-dodger, corn-pone, and hoe-cake are different only in the baking. The meal is prepared for each precisely in the same way. Take as much meal as you want, some salt, and enough pure water to knead the mass. Mix it well, let it stand for fifteen or twenty minutes, not longer, as this will be long enough to saturate perfectly every particle of meal; bake on the griddle for hoe-cake, and in the skillet or oven for dodger or pone. The griddle or oven must be made hot enough to bake, but not to burn, but with a quick heat. The lid must be heated also before putting it on the skillet or oven, and that heat must be kept up with coals of fire placed on it, as there must be around and under the oven. The griddle must be well supplied with live coals under it. The hoe-cake must be put on thin, not more than or quite as thick as your forefinger; when brown, it must be turned and both sides baked to a rich brown color. There must be no burning&mdash;baking is the idea. Yet the baking must be done with a quick lively heat, the quicker the better."</ref>

Johnnycakes may also be made using [[Leavening agent|leavening]], with or without other ingredients more commonly associated with American [[pancake]]s, such as eggs or solid fats like butter. Like pancakes, they are often served with [[maple syrup]], [[honey]], or other sweet toppings.<ref name="necs" />

According to the manuscript of ''America Eats'', a WPA guide to American food culture in the beginning decades of the twentieth century, Rhode Island "jonny cakes" were made in the 1930s as follows:

<blockquote>
In preparation, [white corn] meal may or may not be scalded with hot water or hot milk in accordance to preference. After mixing meal with water or milk it is dropped on a smoking hot spider [pan] set atop a stove into cakes about 3"x3"x1/2" in side. The secret of cooking jonny cakes is to watch them closely and keep them supplied with enough sausage or bacon fat so they will become crisp, and not burn. Cook slowly for half an hour, turn occasionally, and when done serve with plenty of butter.<ref>Mark Kurklansky, "The Food of a Younger Land," Penguin Books, 2009</ref>
</blockquote>

==Variations==
===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the word "Johnnycake" refers to a [[quick bread]] made with [[flour]] rather than cornmeal; the cakes are baked in the hot ashes of a fire or fried in fat in a skillet.<ref name="morris"/>

===Bermuda===
Bermudian Johnny Bread is made of butter, margarine, or shortening, flour, baking soda, an egg, and milk, and typically fried in a 1/2 inch of oil. Raisins are optional.

===Dominican Republic===
[[image:Yaniqueques_2012.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Typical Dominican style Yaniqueques]]
'''Yaniqueques''' or '''yanikeke''' are a [[Dominican Republic]] version of the jonnycake, supposedly brought over in the 19th century by the [[Cocolo]]s, or English-speaking migrants (possibly of Afro-Caribbean descent). Like the Australian version, these cakes are made with flour, baking soda, and water; they are, however, typically deep-fried.<ref name="clara">{{cite book|last=Gonz<U+00E1>lez|first=Clara R.|coauthors=Ilana Benady, Jill Wyatt|title=Traditional Dominican Cookery|publisher=Lulu|year=2007|page=32|isbn=9789945045017|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RzKs7BO5eSwC&pg=PA34}}</ref><ref name="aunt">{{cite book|last=Benady|first=Ilana|title=Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook|publisher=Lulu|year=2005|pages=12, 25|isbn=9781411663251|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YY-9XZ92RhIC|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref> They are a popular beach snack, especially in [[Boca Chica]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Quisqueya la bella: the Dominican Republic in historical and cultural perspective|last=Cambeira|first=Alan|title=9781563249365|publisher=M.E.

===Jamaica===
In Jamaica, johnny cake is also known as "fried dumpling" is the most popular breakfast item. It is made of flour, baking powder, and salt; kneaded and shaped round then flattened in the palms. The dough is fried slowly in a 1/4 inch of coconut oil. Some people in rural areas like to roast/bake the dough in ashes from their outdoor kitchen fire. When cooked, the johnny cake is sliced and a variety of fillers (meat, fish, egg, vegetable) is placed inside to form a sandwich.

===United States===
The modern jonnycake is a staple in the cuisine of [[New England]]<ref name="necs">[http://books.google.com/books?id=5IEnJBtqfRsC&source=gbs_navlinks_s New England Country Store Cookbook by Peter W. Smith (iUniverse 2003)]</ref> and New Englanders claim it originated in [[Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kurlansky|first=Mark|title=The food of a younger land: a portrait of American food, before the national highway system, before chain restaurants, and before frozen food, when the nation's food was seasonal, regional, and traditional:  From the lost WPA files|publisher=Penguin|year=2009|page=86|isbn=9781594488658|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kCRVWMcNPEwC&pg=PA86|accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref> A modern jonnycake is fried [[gruel]] made from yellow or white [[cornmeal]] that is mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and sometimes sweetened. In the [[Southern United States]], the same food is referred to as hoecake.
