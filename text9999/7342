'''David Alexander Johnston''' (December 18, 1949 <U+2013> May 18, 1980) was an American [[volcanologist]] with the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) who was killed by the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|1980 eruption]] of [[Mount St. Helens]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. One of the principal scientists on the monitoring team, Johnston died while manning an observation post about 6 miles ({{Nowrap|10 km}}) from the volcano on the morning of May 18, 1980. He was the first to report the eruption, transmitting the  message "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!" before being swept away by the [[lateral eruption|lateral blast]] created by the collapse of the mountain's north flank. Though Johnston's remains have never been found, remnants of his [[USGS]] trailer were found by state highway workers in 1993.

Johnston's comprehensive, although truncated, career took him across the United States, where he studied [[Augustine Volcano]] in [[Alaska]], the [[San Juan volcanic field]] in [[Colorado]], and long-extinct volcanoes in [[Michigan]]. Johnston was a meticulous and talented scientist who was known for his analyses of [[volcanic gas]]es and their relationship to eruptions. This, along with his enthusiasm and positive attitude, made him liked and respected by many of his co-workers. After his death, other scientists lauded his character both verbally and in dedications and letters. Johnston felt that scientists must do what is necessary, including taking risks, to help protect the public from natural disasters. His work and that of his fellow USGS scientists convinced the authorities to close Mount St. Helens to the general public prior to the 1980 eruption, and to maintain the closure in spite of heavy pressure to re-open the area; their work saved thousands of lives. His story has become part of the popular image of volcanic eruptions and their threat to society, and also part of the history of volcanology. To date, Johnston is one of just two American volcanologists known to have been killed in volcanic eruptions.

Following his death, Johnston was commemorated in several ways, including a memorial fund set up in his name at the [[University of Washington]] to fund graduate-level research. Two volcano observatories were established and named after him: one in [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], Washington, and the other on the ridge where he died. Johnston's life and death have been featured in several documentaries, films, docudramas and books about the eruption. Along with other people killed by the volcano, Johnston's name is inscribed on memorials dedicated to their memory.

His father worked as an engineer at a local company and his mother as a newspaper editor. Johnston often took photographs for his mother's newspaper and contributed articles to his school's newspaper. He never married.<ref name=LDN/>

After graduating from high school, Johnston attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. He planned to study journalism, but became discouraged after a poor grade in a large lecture class. He was intrigued by an introductory [[geology]] class, and changed his major.<ref name=LDN/> His first geologic project was a study of the [[Precambrian]] rock that forms [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula]]. There he investigated the remains of an ancient volcano: a suite of [[metamorphism (geology)|metamorphosed]] [[basalt]]s, a [[gabbro]]ic [[sill (geology)|sill]], and volcanic roots in the form of a [[diorite|dioritic]] and gabbroic [[intrusion (geology)|intrusion]]. The experience planted the seed of Johnston's passion for volcanoes. After working hard to learn the subject,<ref name=LDN/> he graduated with "Highest Honors and Distinction" in 1971.<ref name=Hildreth>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/geology/publications/circ/838/memoriam.htm|title=Geological Survey Circular 838|author=Hildreth, Wes|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2006-03-28|accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref><ref name="dedication">{{cite book|last=Lipman|first=Peter W.|coauthors=Mullineaux, Donal R|title=The 1980 eruptions of Mount St. Helens, Washington|editor=Lipman, Peter W., and Mullineaux, Donal R|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|series=USGS Professional Paper|volume=1250|chapter=Dedication, David A.

Johnston spent the summer after college in the [[San Juan volcanic field]] of [[Colorado]] working with [[volcanologist]] Pete Lipman in his study of two extinct [[caldera]]s.<ref name=LDN/><ref name=Hildreth/> This work became the inspiration for the first phase of his graduate work at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle, in which he focused on the [[Oligocene]] [[Cimarron Volcano|Cimarron]] [[Andesite|andesitic]] volcanic complex in the western San Juans.<ref name=Hildreth/><ref name="masters">{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=David A.|title=Volcanistic facies and implications for the eruptive history of the Cimarron Volcano, San Juan Mountains, SW Colorado|publisher=University of Washington|location=Seattle, WA, US|year=1978|series=Master's Thesis}}</ref> Johnston's reconstruction of the eruptive history of the extinct volcanoes prepared him to study active volcanoes.<ref name=Hildreth/> Johnston's first experience with active volcanoes was a [[Geophysics|geophysical]] survey of [[Mount Augustine]] in [[Alaska]] in 1975. When Mount Augustine erupted in 1976, Johnston raced back to Alaska, shunting his former work on the Cimmaron Volcano into a [[Master's degree|master's thesis]], and making Mount Augustine the focus of his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] work. He graduated in 1978 with his Ph.D., having shown that (1) the emplacement mechanism of the [[pyroclastic flow]]s had changed over time, as they became less [[pumice|pumaceous]], (2) the magmas contained high quantities of volatile water, chlorine, and sulfur, and (3) underground mixing of the [[felsic]] (silicic) magmas with less-viscous [[mafic]] (basaltic) magmas could have triggered eruptions. Mount Augustine was also the site of an early near-disaster for Johnston, when he became trapped on the mountain during an eruption after high winds grounded the first two evacuation aircraft.<ref name="eugene">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UXsRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SeIDAAAAIBAJ&dq=david%20johnston%20augustine%20helicopter&pg=6058%2C5082171|title=Geologist's kin delay sad visit: Parents await quieter time to see site where son died|last=Associated Press|date=1981-05-18|publisher=Eugene Register-Guard|pages=1B|accessdate=2010-04-12|location=Eugene, OR, US.}}</ref>

During the summers of 1978 and 1979, Johnston led studies of the ash-flow sheet emplaced in the 1912 eruption of [[Mount Katmai]] in the [[Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes]].<ref name=Hildreth/> The [[Volcanic gas|gas]] phase is extremely important in propelling volcanic eruptions. Because of this, Johnston mastered the many techniques required to analyze [[Melt inclusions|glass]]-[[Fluid inclusions|vapor inclusions]] in [[phenocryst]]s embedded in lavas, which provide information about gases present during past eruptions. His work at Mount Katmai and other volcanoes in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes paved the way for his career, and his "agility, nerve, patience, and determination around the jet-like summit fumaroles in the crater of [[Mount Mageik|Mt. Mageik]]" impressed his colleagues.<ref name=Hildreth/>

Later in 1978, Johnston joined the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), where he monitored volcanic emission levels in the [[Cascades]] and [[Aleutian Arc]]. There he helped to strengthen the theory that eruptions can be predicted, to some degree, by changes in the makeup of [[volcanic gas]]es.<ref name=USGS>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/CVO_Info/david_johnston.html|title=David A. Johnston December 1949&nbsp;<U+2013> May 18, 1980|author=Lyn Topinka|publisher=USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington |date=2007-12-28|accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> Fellow volcanologist Wes Hildreth said of Johnston, "I think Dave's dearest hope was that systematic monitoring of [[fumarole|fumarolic]] emissions might permit detection of changes characteristically precursory to eruptions&nbsp;... Dave wanted to formulate a general model for the behavior of magmatic volatiles prior to explosive outbursts and to develop a corollary rationale for the evaluation of hazards."<ref name=Hildreth/> During this time, Johnston continued to visit Mount Augustine every summer and also assessed the [[geothermal energy]] potential of the [[Azores]] and [[Portugal]]. In the last year of his life, Johnston developed an interest in the health, agricultural, and environmental effects of both volcanic and [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] emissions to the atmosphere.<ref name=Hildreth/>

Johnston was based at the [[Menlo Park, California]], branch of the USGS, but his work on volcanoes took him all over the Pacific Northwest region. When the first [[earthquake]]s shook Mount St. Helens on March 16, 1980, Johnston was nearby at the [[University of Washington]], where he had pursued his doctorate. Intrigued by the possible advent of an eruption, Johnston contacted Stephen Malone, a professor of geology at the university. Malone had been his mentor when Johnston had worked at the San Juan complex in Colorado, and Johnston admired his work.<ref name=LDN/> Malone stated that he "put him to work" almost instantly, allowing Johnston to escort interested reporters to a place near the volcano.<ref name=Hill33>Hill, p. 33.</ref> Johnston was the first geologist on the volcano,<ref name=Hildreth/> and soon became a leader within the USGS team, taking charge of monitoring of volcanic gas emissions.<ref name=Hill33/>

=== Precursor activity ===

Since its last eruptive activity in the mid-19th century, Mount St. Helens had been largely [[inactive volcano|dormant]]. [[Seismograph]]s were not installed until 1972. This period of more than 100 years of inactivity ended in early 1980. On March 15, a cluster of tiny earthquakes rocked the area around the mountain. For six days, more than 100 earthquakes clustered around Mount St. Helens, an indication that magma was moving. There was initially some doubt as to whether the earthquakes were precursors to an eruption.<ref name=EdKLT>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/May18/MSHThisWeek/32228/32228.html|author=Klimasauskas, Ed, and Topinka, Lyn|title=Mount St. Helens Precursory Activity: March 22<U+2013>28, 1980|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> By March 20, a [[Richter scale|magnitude]] 4.2 earthquake shook the wilderness around the volcano. The next day, seismologists installed three seismic recorder stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/May18/MSHThisWeek/31521/31521.html|author=Klimasauskas, Ed, and Topinka, Lyn|title=Mount St. Helens Precursory Activity: March 15<U+2013>21, 1980|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> After March 25, seismic activity drastically increased. By March 24, volcanologists at the USGS<U+2014>including Johnston<U+2014>became more confident that the seismic activity was a sign of an impending eruption. By March 26, more than seven earthquakes over magnitude 4.0 had been recorded, and the next day, hazard warnings were publicly issued.<ref name=EdKLT/> On March 27, a [[phreatic eruption]] took place, ejecting a plume of ash nearly {{convert|7000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} into the air.<ref name=EdKLT/>

Similar activity continued at the volcano over the following weeks, excavating the crater, forming an adjacent caldera, and erupting small amounts of steam, ash, and [[tephra]]. With each new eruption, the plumes of steam and ash from the volcano rose, eventually climbing to {{convert|20000|ft|m|-3}}. By late March, the volcano was erupting up to 100 times per day.<ref name=Bryson220>Bryson, p. 220.</ref>  Spectators congregated in the vicinity of the mountain, hoping for a chance to see its eruptions. They were joined by reporters on helicopters, as well as mountain climbers.<ref name=Bryson220/>

On April 17, a bulge was discovered on the mountain's north flank, suggesting that Mount St. Helens could produce a [[lateral blast]].<ref name=Fisher91>Fisher, p. 91.</ref> Johnston was one of few people who believed this, along with a professor of geology at a Tacoma community college, Jack Hyde. Observing that Mount St. Helens did not possess visible vents, Hyde suggested that pressure would increase until the mountain exploded. Because Hyde was not a part of the USGS or in a position of responsibility, his opinion was generally dismissed.<ref>Bryson, p. 221.</ref> However, both were to be proven correct. Rising [[magma]] under Mount St. Helens had veered off to the north flank, creating a growing bulge on the surface.<ref name=Fisher91/>

=== Final signs and primary blast ===
Given the increasing seismic and volcanic activity, Johnston and the other volcanologists working for the USGS in its Vancouver branch prepared to observe any impending eruption. Geologist Don Swanson and others placed reflectors on and around the growing domes,<ref>Parchman, pp. 108<U+2013>109.</ref> and established the Coldwater&nbsp;I and II observation posts to use [[laser ranging]] to measure how the distances to these reflectors changed over time as the domes deformed. Coldwater&nbsp;II, where Johnston died, was located just {{convert|6|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north of the mountain. To the astonishment of the USGS geologists, the bulge was growing at a rate of 5 to 8 feet (1.5 to 2.4 meters) per day.<ref name="NatGeo">{{cite journal|last=Balog|first=James|author-link=James Balog|date=2004-12 / 2005-01|title=Back to the Blast|journal=National Geographic Adventure|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|location=Washington, DC, US|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0412/excerpt2.html|accessdate=2010-04-11}}</ref>

[[Tiltmeter]]s installed on the volcano's north side displayed a northwest trending tilt for that side of the mountain, and a southwest trending tilt was observed on the south side. Worried that the amount of pressure on the magma underground was increasing, scientists analyzed gases by the crater, and found high traces of [[sulfur dioxide]]. After this discovery, they began to regularly check the fumarolic activity and monitor the volcano for dramatic changes, but none were observed. Disheartened, they instead opted to study the growing bulge and the threat an avalanche could have for humans relatively near the volcano.<ref name=TopinkaM1017>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/May18/MSHThisWeek/510517/510517.html|title=Mount St. Helens Precursory Activity: May 10<U+2013>17, 1980|year=2010|author=Topinka, Lyn|accessdate=2010-04-01|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]}}</ref>  An evaluation of the threat was carried out, concluding that a landslide or avalanche in the [[Toutle River]] could spawn [[lahar]]s, or mudflows, downstream.<ref name=Fisher91/>

At that point, the previously consistent [[phreatic]] activity had become intermittent. Between May 10 and May 17, the only change occurred on the volcano's north flank, as the bulge increased in size. On May 16 and 17, the mountain stopped its phreatic eruptions completely.<ref name=TopinkaM1017/>

The active Mount St. Helens was extremely different from its dormant form, now featuring an enormous bulge and several craters. In the week preceding the eruption, cracks formed in the north sector of the volcano's summit, indicating a movement of magma from the bulge and towards the caldera.<ref name=TopinkaM1017/>

At 8:32 a.m. local time the next day (18 May), an earthquake measuring magnitude 5.1 on the Richter scale rocked the area, triggering the landslide that started the main eruption. In a matter of seconds, vibrations from the earthquake loosened {{convert|2.7|km3|cumi|1|sp=us}} of rock on the mountain's north face and summit, creating a massive landslide. With the loss of the confining pressure of the overlying rock, the caldera of Mount St. Helens began to rapidly emit steam and other volcanic gases. A few seconds later, it erupted laterally, sending swift [[pyroclastic flow]]s down its flanks at near [[supersonic]] speeds. These flows were later joined by lahars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/May18/description_may18_1980.html|date=2005-03-28|title=Description: May 18, 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> Before being struck by a series of flows that at their fastest would have taken less than a minute to reach his position, Johnston managed to radio "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!" to his USGS co-workers. Seconds later, the signal from the radio went silent.<ref name=DBNJ/> Initially, there was some debate as to whether Johnston had survived; records soon showed a radio message from fellow eruption victim and amateur radio operator Gerry Martin, located near the Coldwater peak and further north of Johnston's position, reporting his sighting of the eruption enveloping the Coldwater&nbsp;II observation post. As the blast overwhelmed Johnston's post, Martin declared solemnly, "Gentlemen, the uh, camper and the car sitting over to the south of me is covered. It's gonna get me, too. I can't get out of here&nbsp;..." before his radio, too, went silent.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stepankowsky, Andre|url=http://www.helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/article_314586af-d2be-5df2-a55d-4cfb5e370b8f.html|title=Memories, lessons from mountain's fury|work=The Daily News|date=2005-05-16|accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref>

The extent, speed and direction of the avalanche and pyroclastic flows that overwhelmed Johnston, Martin, and others were later described in detail in a paper titled 'Chronology and Character of the 18 May 1980 Explosive Eruptions of Mount St. Helens', published in 1984 in a collection published by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]'s Geophysics Study Committee.<ref name="Moore and Rice">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=James G.|coauthors=Rice, Carl J.|title=Explosive Volcanism: Inception, Evolution, and Hazards|editor=[[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (U.S.), Geophysics Study Committee|year=1984|publisher=[[United States National Academies|National Academies]]|series=Studies in Geophysics|chapter=Chronology and Character of the May 18, 1980 Explosive Eruptions of Mount St. Helens|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2j4rAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA133}}</ref> In this paper, the authors examined photographs and satellite images of the eruption to construct a chronology and description of the first few minutes.

These six photographs, taken sideways on to the lateral blast, vividly show the extent and size of the avalanche and flows as they reached northwards over and beyond Johnston's position. Figure 10.7 from the same paper is an overhead diagram showing the position of the pyroclastic surge front at half-minute intervals, with the positions of Johnston (Coldwater&nbsp;II) and Martin included.<ref name="Moore and Rice"/>

The eruption was heard hundreds of miles away,<ref name="Tilling">{{cite book|last=Tilling|first=R.I|coauthors=Topinka, L., and Swanson, D.A.|title=Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|location=Reston, VA, US|year=1990|series=U.S. Geological Survey Special Interest Publication|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Publications/MSHPPF/MSH_past_present_future.html|accessdate=2010-04-11}}</ref> but some of those who survived the eruption declared that the landslide and pyroclastic flows were silent as they raced down the mountain. Krau Kilpatrick, an employee of the [[United States Forest Service]], recalled, "There was no sound to it, not a sound. It was like a silent movie and we were all in it."<ref>Sandler, p. 91.</ref> The reason for this discrepancy is a "quiet zone", created as a result of the motion and temperature of air and, to a lesser extent, upon local topography.<ref name="Tilling"/>

Famous for telling reporters that being on the mountain was like "standing next to a dynamite keg and the fuse is lit",<ref name="TSR">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19800328&id=w_gRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RO4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4234,6692615|title=Speeding rock, ash possible|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=1980-03-28|accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> Johnston had been among the first volcanologists at the volcano when eruptive signs appeared, and shortly after was named the head of volcanic gas monitoring. Though a careful analyst, Johnston strongly believed that scientists needed to take this risk for themselves in order to prevent civilian deaths, and therefore chose to partake in dangerous on-site monitoring. He and several other volcanologists prevented people from being near the volcano during the few months of pre-eruptive activity, and successfully fought pressure to re-open the area.<ref name=USGS/> Their work kept the death toll at a few tens of individuals, instead of the thousands who possibly could have died had the region not been closed off. Johnston supported the lateral blast theory: he believed the explosive eruption would be ejected sideways out of the volcano, not upward. He also believed that the eruption would originate from the bulge. Because of this, he was more aware than most of the threat of a north-directed eruption.<ref name=USGS/>

The other locations marked are three lakes (Spirit Lake, Bear Cove, and Coldwater lake) and a river (North Fork Toutle River).]]
Many USGS scientists worked on the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student [[Harry Glicken]] who had been manning the Coldwater&nbsp;II observation post for the two and a half weeks immediately preceding the eruption.<ref name="Parchman46">Parchman, p. 46.</ref> The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston in the hallway and asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day.<ref name="Parchman21"/> That Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone.<ref name="Driedger">{{cite news|url=http://www.theworldlink.com/articles/2004/10/04/news/news07.txt|title=For scientists, this volcano study is personal|last=Callimachi|first=Rukmini|author-link=Rukmini Maria Callimachi|date=2004-10-04|publisher=The World|accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref> While at Coldwater&nbsp;II, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption.<ref>Harris, p. 205.</ref> Just prior to his departure, at 7&nbsp;p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13<U+00BD> hours before the eruption, Glicken took a photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation post trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling.<ref name=TopinkaM1017/>

Immediately, rescue workers were dispatched to the area. The official USGS pilot, Lon Stickney, who had been flying the scientists to the mountain, conducted the first rescue attempt. He flew his helicopter over the scarred remains of trees, valleys, and the Coldwater&nbsp;II observation post ridge, where he saw bare rock and uprooted trees.

Frantic and guilt-stricken, Harry Glicken convinced three separate helicopter pilots to take him up on flights over the devastated area in a rescue attempt, but the eruption had so changed the landscape that they were unable to locate any sign of the Coldwater&nbsp;II observation post, which had been swept away and buried in the blast.

=== Consequences and response ===
The public was shocked by the extent of the eruption, which had lowered the elevation of the summit by {{convert|1313|ft|m|0|sp=us}}, destroyed {{convert|230|sqmi|km2|0|sp=us}} of woodland, and spread ash into other states.<ref name=1980eruption>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Publications/MSHPPF/MSH_past_present_future.html|title=Report: Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future|author=Topinka, Lyn|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2006-12-27|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>  The lateral blast that killed Johnston started at {{convert|220|mph|km/h|0|sp=us}} and accelerated to {{convert|670|mph|km/h|0|sp=us}}.<ref name="Tilling"/> Even USGS scientists were awed. With a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] value of 5, the eruption was catastrophic. More than 50 people were killed or missing, including Johnston, mountain resident [[Harry Randall Truman]], and ''[[National Geographic]]'' photographer [[Reid Blackburn]].<ref name=1980eruption/>

The disaster was the deadliest and most destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States of America. A total of 57 people are known to have died<!--largely redundant of previous paragraph-->, and more were left homeless when the ash falls and pyroclastic flows destroyed or buried 200 houses. In addition to the human fatalities, thousands of animals perished. The official estimate from the USGS was 7,000 game animals, {{Nowrap|12 million}} salmon fingerlings, and 40,000 salmon.<ref name=1980eruption/>

Two years after the eruption, the United States government set aside {{convert|110000|acre|km2}} of land for the [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]]. This protected area, which includes the Johnston Ridge Observatory and several other research and visitor centers, serves as an area for scientific research, tourism, and education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/|title=Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument|publisher=[[United States Forest Service]]|date=2010-03-31|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>

Johnston, known to his friends as Dave, was commemorated by both his fellow scientists and by the government. Known for his diligent and particular nature, he was called "an exemplary scientist" by a USGS dedication paper, which also described him as "unaffectedly genuine, with an infectious curiosity and enthusiasm".<ref name=USGS/> He was quick to "dissipate cynicism" and believed that "careful evaluation and interpretation" was the best approach to his work.<ref name=USGS/>  An obituary notice for Johnston stated that at the time of his death he had been "among the leading young volcanologists in the world" and that his "enthusiasm and warmth" would be "missed at least as much as his scientific strength".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Death of David Johnston at St. Helens|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/Reports/bulletin/contents.cfm?issue=special#sean_0505|publisher=Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network|date=May 1980|volume=SEAN 05:05|journal=Scientific Event Alert Network}}</ref> Co-worker Andrew Alden states that Johnston had great potential, declaring that he "had many friends and a bright future".<ref name="Alden"/> Following the eruption, Harry Glicken and other geologists at the USGS dedicated their work to Johnston.<ref name="Parchman142">Parchman, p. 142.</ref>

Because Johnston was believed to be safe at the Coldwater&nbsp;II observation post, the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died "doing what he wanted to do."<ref name="missing"/> His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, "Not many people get to do what they really want to do in this world, but our son did.&nbsp;... He would tell us he may never get rich but he was doing what he wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's Day, he told us it's a sight very few geologists get to see."<ref name="missing"/> Dr. Stephen Malone agreed that Johnston died doing what he loved, and stated that he "was very good at his work".<ref name=Hill33/>

Johnston's role in the study of the volcano in the weeks leading up to the eruption was acknowledged in 1981 in a chronology of the eruption, published as part of the USGS report titled 'The 1980 Eruptions of Mount St. Helens, Washington': {{quotation|Among the many contributors of data, none was more essential to the systematic reconstruction of the events of 1980 at Mount St. Helens than David Johnston, to whose memory this report is dedicated.

Since Johnston's death, his field of [[Prediction of volcanic activity|volcanic eruption prediction]] has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are now able to predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in advance.<ref name="dzurisin">{{cite journal|author=Dzurisin, Daniel|title=A comprehensive approach to monitoring volcano deformation as a window on the eruption cycle|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2003/2001RG000107.shtml|publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|date=2003-02|volume=41|issue=1|page=1001|doi=10.1029/2001RG000107|journal=Reviews of Geophysics}}</ref> Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity.<ref>{{cite book|last=McNutt|first=S.R|title=International Handbook of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology|editor=Lee, W.H.K, Kanamori, H., Jennings, P.C., and Kisslinger, C|volume=Part A|chapter=25. Volcano Seismology and Monitoring Eruptions|isbn=978-0-12-440658-2}}</ref> In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-[[period (physics)|period]] earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They can also use [[carbon dioxide]] emission as a proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the Coldwater&nbsp;I and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of [[InSAR]] (interferometry), surveys of networks of [[GPS]] monuments, microgravity surveys in which scientists measure the change in [[gravitational potential]] or [[gravitational acceleration|acceleration]] because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, [[strain (mechanics)|strain]] meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic eruptions.<ref name="dzurisin"/>

Despite the deaths of other volcanologists in later eruptions at [[Mount Unzen]] and [[Galeras]], prediction methods similar to Johnston's allowed scientists to convince residents of settlements near the [[Mount Pinatubo]] volcano to evacuate, preventing thousands of deaths.<ref name="Alden">{{cite web|url=http://geology.about.com/od/volcanology/a/aa051897MSH.htm|title=Mount St. Helens Eruption of 1980: The man who gave everything|author=Alden, Andrew|year=2010|accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> In addition to his work, Johnston himself has become part of the history of volcanic eruptions.

Early acts of commemoration included two trees that were planted in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]],<ref name="eugene"/> and the renaming of a community center in Johnston's hometown as the "Johnston Center". These actions were reported in newspapers during the first anniversary of the eruption in May 1981.<ref name="eugene"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olparks.com/parks%20&%20facilities/facilty_johnston.htm|title=David Johnston Center, 9400 S.

Johnston's connections with the [[University of Washington]] (where he had carried out his masters and doctoral research) are remembered by a memorial fund that established an endowed graduate-level fellowship within what is now the department of Earth and Space Sciences. By the time of the first anniversary of his death, the fund had exceeded [[United States dollar|$]]30,000. Known as the 'David A. Johnston Memorial Fellowship for Research Excellence', a number of awards of this fellowship have been made over the years since it was launched.<ref name="eugene"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ess.washington.edu/ess/education/studentservices/awards.html|title=Student Awards|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-04-11}}</ref>

Following the eruption, the area where the Coldwater&nbsp;II observation post had been was sectioned off. Eventually, an observatory was built in the area in Johnston's name, and opened in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s-syAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2QcGAAAAIBAJ&pg=4938,3606463|title=Center allows views of mountain's crater|author=Tim Klass (Associated Press)|work=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|date=1997-05-17|accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> Located just over {{convert|5|mi|0|km|sp=us}} from the north flank of Mount St. Helens, the Johnston Ridge Observatory (JRO) allows the public to admire the open crater, new activity, and the creations of the 1980 eruption, including an extensive basalt field.

There are several public memorials where Johnston's name is inscribed in a list of those known to have died in the eruption. These memorials include a large curved granite monument at an outside viewing area at the Johnston Ridge Observatory, which opened in 1997, and a plaque at the Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center, which was unveiled in a memorial grove in May 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=20000520&id=iHcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tesDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2916,5446206|title=Plaque dedication rekindles memories|author=Associated Press|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|date=2000-05-20}}</ref>

David Johnston's name can be seen beneath the rose, slightly to the left.|alt=Refer to caption.]]
There have been several tellings of Johnston's story in documentaries, films and [[docudrama]]s about the eruption. Documentaries such as ''[[The Eruption of Mount St. Helens!]]'' (1980) appeared the same year, while a movie was filmed in the year following the eruption and released to coincide with the first anniversary. The story of Mount St. Helens and Johnston continues to be told in documentaries and reconstructions several decades after the eruption took place.

In the 1981 film ''[[St. Helens (film)|St. Helens]]'', actor [[David Huffman]] starred as a renamed Johnston (David Jackson). Controversially, Huffman's character became involved in a love affair and was killed by the blast while on top of the mountain. Johnston's parents criticized the production of the film, arguing that it possessed not "an ounce of David in it" and portrayed "him as a daredevil rather than a careful scientist".<ref name=DBNJ/> They threatened to sue over the fact that they felt their son's memory had been contaminated. Johnston's mother stated that the film had changed many true aspects of the eruption, and depicted her son as "a rebel" with "a history of disciplinary trouble".<ref name=DBNJ>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xY8zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C-EFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2878,164920|title=Family Unhappy With Film Portrayal Of Son|work=[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]|publisher=The News-Journal Corporation|date=1980-12-01|accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref>

Prior to the film's release during the one-year anniversary of the eruption, 36 scientists who knew Johnston signed a letter of protest. They wrote that, "Dave's life was too meritorious to require fictional embellishments," and that, "Dave was a superbly conscientious and creative scientist."<ref name="Parchman206">Parchman, p. 206.</ref>  Don Swanson, a USGS geologist who was Johnston's friend and who, due to other commitments, had convinced Johnston to take his place at the Coldwater&nbsp;II observation post on the day of the eruption,<ref name="Parchman21">Parchman, pp. 21<U+2013>22.</ref> believed that a movie based on Johnston's true life and exploits would have been a hit because of his friend's character.<ref name="Parchman206"/>

Several documentaries and docudramas have covered the history of the eruption, including archive footage and dramatisations of Johnston's story. These include ''Up From the Ashes'' (1990) by [[KOMO-TV]], an episode of the 2005 second series of ''[[Seconds From Disaster]]'' broadcast by the [[National Geographic Channel]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/seconds-from-disaster/2384/Overview|title=Seconds From Disaster&nbsp;<U+2013> Mount St. Helens Eruption|work=[[National Geographic Channel]]|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> and an episode of the 2006 series ''[[Surviving Disaster]]'', broadcast on the [[BBC]] and [[Discovery Channel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcactive.com/BroadcastLearning/MediaSupportFiles/Surviving%20Disaster%20information.pdf|title=Surviving Disaster, press release|work=BBC Active|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2010-04-03}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
