'''''Jaws''''' is a 1975 American thriller film directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and based on [[Peter Benchley]]'s [[Jaws (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The police chief of Amity Island, a fictional summer resort town, tries to protect beachgoers from a giant [[great white shark]] by closing the beach, only to be overruled by the town council, which wants the beach to remain open to draw a profit from tourists during the summer season. After several attacks, the police chief enlists the help of a [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and a professional shark hunter. [[Roy Scheider]] stars as police chief Martin Brody, [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as marine biologist Matt Hooper, [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as shark hunter Quint, [[Murray Hamilton]] as the Mayor of Amity Island, and [[Lorraine Gary]] as Brody's wife, Ellen.

''Jaws'' is regarded as a watershed film in motion picture history, the father of the summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster film]] and one of the first "[[high concept]]" films.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Rise of the Blockbuster|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1653733.stm|date=2001-11-16|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref><ref name="Wyatt 21">{{harvnb|Wyatt|1994|p=21}}</ref> Due to the film's success in advance screenings, studio executives decided to distribute it in a much wider release than ever before. ''[[The Omen]]'' followed suit in the summer of 1976 and then ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' one year later in 1977, cementing the notion for movie studios to distribute their big-release action and adventure pictures (commonly referred to as ''tentpole pictures'') during the summer. ''Jaws'' is widely regarded as one of [[Films considered the greatest ever|the greatest films of all time]]. It was number 48 on [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|100 Years... 100 Movies]]'', a list of the greatest American films of all time, dropping down to number 56 on the [[AFI's 100 Years<U+2026>100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10 Year Anniversary list]]. It ranked second on a similar list for thrillers, ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills|100 Years... 100 Thrills]]''. The film was followed by three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley. A video game titled ''[[Jaws Unleashed]]'' was produced in 2006.

==Plot==

During a late night beach party on the fictional Amity Island in [[New England]] a young woman named Chrissie Watkins ([[Susan Backlinie]]) goes skinny dipping alone. She dives into the water, where she is suddenly jerked around and then pulled under by an unseen force. The next morning, Amity's new police chief Martin Brody ([[Roy Scheider]]) is notified that Chrissie is missing, and finds her mutilated remains washed up on the shore. The medical examiner informs Brody that the death was due to a shark attack. Brody plans to close the beaches, but is overruled by the town mayor, Larry Vaughn ([[Murray Hamilton]]), who fears that reports of a shark attack will ruin the summer tourist season, as it is the town's largest source of income. The medical examiner reverses his diagnosis and attributes the death to a boating accident. Brody reluctantly goes along with the explanation.

A short time later, a young boy is killed by a shark while swimming off a crowded beach. His mother places a $3,000 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on the shark, sparking an amateur shark hunting frenzy and attracting the attention of local professional shark hunter Quint ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]). Brought in by Brody, [[ichthyologist]] Matt Hooper ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) conducts an autopsy on Chrissie's remains and concludes she was killed by a shark.

A large [[tiger shark]] is caught by a group of fishermen, leading the town to believe the problem is solved, but Hooper is unconvinced the corpse is the killer and asks to examine the contents of the shark's stomach. Vaughn refuses to make the "operation" public, so Brody and Hooper return after dark and discover the dead shark does not contain any human remains. Scouting aboard Hooper's boat, they come across the half-sunken wreckage of a fisherman's boat. Hooper dons a wetsuit and while exploring the vessel underwater discovers the fisherman's severed head. Vaughn still refuses to close the beach and on the Fourth of July, numerous tourists arrive. The shark enters an estuary, kills a man, and nearly takes the life of Brody's son. Brody forces a stunned Vaughn to hire Quint. Brody and Hooper join the hunter on his fishing boat, the ''Orca'', and the trio set out to kill the man-eater.

At sea, Brody is given the task of laying a [[Chumming|chum]] line while Quint uses deep-sea fishing tackle to try to hook the shark. As Brody continues chumming, an enormous [[great white shark]] suddenly looms up behind the boat. The trio watch the great white circle the ''Orca'' and estimate it weighs 3 tons (2.7 metric tonnes) and is 25 feet (7.5 meters) long. Quint harpoons the shark with a line attached to a flotation barrel, designed to prevent the shark from being able to submerge as well as to track it on the surface, but the shark pulls the barrel under and disappears.

Night falls without another sighting, so the men retire to the boat's cabin, where Quint tells of his experience with sharks as a survivor of the World War II sinking of the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. The shark reappears, damages the boat's hull, and then slips away. In the morning, the men make repairs to the engine. Quint destroys the radio to prevent Brody from calling the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] for help. The shark attacks again, and after a long chase, Quint harpoons it to another barrel. The men tie the barrels to the stern; but the shark drags the boat backwards, forcing water onto the deck and into the engine, flooding it. Quint harpoons it again, attaching three barrels in all to the shark, while the shark continues to tow them. Quint is about to cut the ropes with his machete when the cleats are pulled off the stern. The shark continues to attack the boat and Quint powers towards shore with the shark in pursuit, hoping to draw the animal into shallow waters, where it will be beached and drowned. In his [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Ahab-like]] obsession to kill the shark, Quint overtaxes ''Orca'''s damaged engine, causing it to seize.

With the boat immobilized, the trio try a desperate approach: Hooper dons his SCUBA gear and enters the ocean inside a [[shark proof cage]], to stab the shark in the mouth with a hypodermic spear filled with [[strychnine]]. The shark instead destroys the cage, but gets tangled in the remains, allowing Hooper to hide on the seabed. As Quint and Brody raise the remnants of the cage, the shark throws itself onto the boat, crushing the [[Transom (nautical)|transom]]. As the boat starts sinking, Quint slides into the shark's mouth and is killed. Brody retreats to the boat's partly submerged cabin, and forces a pressurized air tank into the shark's mouth. Brody takes Quint's [[M1 Garand]], and climbs the mast of the rapidly sinking vessel. After temporarily driving the shark off with a harpoon, Brody begins shooting at the air tank still wedged in the shark's mouth. He explodes the tank, blowing the shark to pieces. As the shark's dead body drifts toward the seabed, Hooper reappears on the surface. The survivors quickly lament Quint's loss and then cobble together a raft out of debris and paddle back to Amity Island.

==Production==
===Development===
[[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], producers at [[Universal Pictures]], heard about Peter Benchley's [[Jaws (novel)|novel]] at the same time at different locations. Brown came across it in the fiction department of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', a lifestyle magazine then edited by his wife, [[Helen Gurley Brown]]. A small card gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment "might make a good movie".<ref name="brown">Brown, David, "A Look Inside ''Jaws''", produced by Laurent Bouzereau, available as a bonus feature on some laserdisc and DVD releases of ''Jaws''</ref> The producers each read it overnight and agreed the next morning that it was "the most exciting thing that they had ever read" and that, although they were unsure how they would accomplish it, they wanted to produce the film.<ref name="zanuck">Zanuck, Richard D., "A Look Inside ''Jaws''", produced by Laurent Bouzereau, available as a bonus feature on some laserdisc and DVD releases of ''Jaws''</ref> Brown claimed that had they read the book twice they would have never have made the film because of the difficulties in executing some of the sequences.<ref name="McBride 231">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=231}}</ref> They purchased the film rights to Benchley's novel in 1973 for approximately $175,000.<ref name="Brode 50">{{harvnb|Brode|1995|p=50}}</ref>

Zanuck and Brown had originally planned to hire [[John Sturges]] to direct the film, before considering [[Dick Richards]].<ref name="McBride232">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=232}}</ref> However, they grew irritated by Richards' vision of continually calling the shark "the whale"; Richards was subsequently dropped from the project.<ref name="McBride232"/> Zanuck and Brown then signed Spielberg in June 1973 to direct before the release of his first theatrical film, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'' (also a Zanuck/Brown production).<ref name="McBride232"/> Spielberg wanted to take the novel's basic concept, removing Benchley's many [[subplot]]s.<ref name="Brode 50"/>  Zanuck, Brown and Spielberg removed the novel's adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper because it would compromise the camaraderie between the men when they went out on the ''Orca''.<ref name="brown"/>

When they purchased the rights to his novel, the producers guaranteed that the author would write the first draft of the [[screenplay]]. Overall, Benchley wrote three drafts before deciding to bow out of the project (although he appeared in the final film, a cameo appearance as a news reporter).<ref name="Brode 50"/> Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright [[Howard Sackler]] happened to be in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite, and since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchley's drafts, they quickly accepted his offer.<ref name="Jaws">''Spotlight on Location: The Making of Jaws'', ''Jaws'' 30th Anniversary DVD documentary, [2005]</ref>  Spielberg sent the script to [[Carl Gottlieb]] (who appears in a [[supporting actor|supporting acting]] role in the film as Meadows, the politically connected editor of the local paper), asking for advice.<ref name="Jaws"/> Gottlieb rewrote most scenes during principal photography, and [[John Milius]] contributed dialogue polishes. Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear if the other screenwriters drew on his material. The authorship of Quint's monologue about the fate of the cruiser [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']] has caused substantial controversy as to who deserves the most credit for the speech. Spielberg described it as a collaboration among John Milius, Howard Sackler, and actor Robert Shaw.<ref name="Friedman167">{{harvnb|Friedman|2006|p=167}}</ref> Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius' contribution.<ref name="Gottlieb208">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2005|p=208}}</ref>

===Casting===
Spielberg offered the role of Brody to [[Robert Duvall]], but the actor was only interested in portraying Quint.<ref name="McBride237">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=237}}</ref> Roy Scheider became interested in the project after overhearing a screenwriter and Spielberg at a party talking about having the shark jump up onto a boat.<ref name="Jaws"/> Spielberg was initially apprehensive of hiring Scheider, fearing he would portray a "tough guy", similar to his role in ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]''.<ref name="McBride237"/>

The role of Quint was originally offered to actors [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Sterling Hayden]], both of whom passed.<ref name="Jaws"/><ref name="McBride237"/> Producers Zanuck and Brown had just finished working with Robert Shaw on ''[[The Sting]]'', and suggested him to Spielberg as a possible Quint. For the role of Hooper, Spielberg initially wanted [[Jon Voight]].<ref name="Jackson20">{{harvnb|Jackson|2007|p=20}}</ref> Richard Dreyfuss initially passed on the role of Matt Hooper, but after being disappointed by his own performance in a pre-release screening of ''[[The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (film)|The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz]]'', a film he had just completed, he immediately called Spielberg and accepted the role, fearing that no one would want to hire him once ''Kravitz'' was released. Due to the film's dissimilarities to the novel, Spielberg asked Dreyfuss not to read the book before offering the role.<ref name="Roan30Years">{{cite news|last=Harvey|first=Neil|work=[[The Roanoke Times]]|title=30 years of 'Jaws'|url=http://www.roanoke.com/extra%5C25348.html|date=2005-06-13|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> The first person actually cast for the film was Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-studio chief, Sid Sheinberg.<ref name="Jaws"/>

===Filming===
{{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote="We started the film without a script, without a cast and without a shark."|source=<U+2014>actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] on the film's troubled production<ref name="SharkTale"/>}}

[[Principal photography]] began in May 1974.<ref name="McBride233">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=233}}</ref> Three mechanical sharks were made for the production: a full version for underwater shots, one that moved from camera-left to right (with its hidden side completely exposing the internal machinery), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered.<ref name="Brode 50"/> Their construction was supervised by production designer [[Joe Alves]] and special effects artist Bob Mattey. After the sharks were completed, they were shipped to the shooting location, but had not been tested in water and when placed in the ocean the full model sank to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it.<ref name="Jaws"/> The model required 14 operators to control all of the moving parts.<ref name="Roan30Years"/>

Location shooting occurred on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], chosen because the ocean had a sandy bottom while {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} out at sea.<ref name="Jaws"/> This helped the mechanical sharks to operate smoothly and still provide a realistic location. The film nonetheless had a famously troubled shoot and went considerably over budget. David Brown said that the budget "was $4 million and the picture wound up costing $9 million".<ref name="Prigg<U+00E9>8">{{harvnb|Prigg<U+00E9>|2004|p=8}}</ref> Shooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras were soaked, and the ''Orca'' once began to sink with the actors onboard. The mechanical shark frequently malfunctioned, due to the hydraulic innards being corroded by salt water.<ref name="Jaws"/> The three mechanical sharks were collectively nicknamed "Bruce" by the production team after Spielberg's lawyer.<ref name="McBride241">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=241}}</ref> Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname "Flaws".<ref name="Roan30Years"/><ref name="McBride241"/>

[[File:Mechashark.JPG|thumb|210px|right|alt=A large model shark is hoisted by a crane as two men watch it.|Bruce, the full model mechanical shark, attached to special rigging]]
To some degree, the delays in the production proved serendipitous. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot most of the scenes with the shark only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is represented by the floating yellow barrels. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin due to its ease of filming. This forced restraint is widely thought to have increased the suspense of these scenes, giving it a [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] tone.<ref name="Roan30Years"/><ref name="Sinyard36">{{harvnb|Sinyard|1989|p=36}}</ref>

The scene where Hooper discovers fisherman Ben Gardner's body in the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] of his wrecked boat was added after an initial screening of the film. Actor Craig Kingsbury had to press his head into a latex mold to make an exact copy, which was then attached to a fake body and placed in the wrecked boat's hull. The team filmed many takes of the scene where the head suddenly appears. After reactions to that screening, Spielberg said he was greedy for "one more scream" and, with $3,000 of his own money, financed the scene after he was denied funding from Universal Pictures.<ref name="Jaws"/>

Footage of real sharks was shot by [[Ron & Valerie Taylor|Ron and Valerie Taylor]] in the waters off Australia, with a dwarf actor in a miniature shark cage to create the illusion that the shark was enormous.<ref name="Jaws"/><ref name="McBride234">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=234}}</ref> Originally, the script, following the novel, had the shark killing Hooper in the shark cage, but during filming, one of the sharks became trapped in the girdle of the cage, and proceeded to tear the cage apart.<ref name="Jaws"/> The cage contained no one at the time, so the script was changed to allow Matt Hooper to live and the cage to be empty.<ref name="Jaws"/>

Although filming was scheduled to take 55 days, it eventually ended in September 1974 after 159 days.<ref name="Roan30Years"/><ref name="McBride233"/> Spielberg, reflecting on the extended delay, stated: "I thought my career as a filmmaker was over. I heard rumors ... that I would never work again because no one had ever taken a film 100 days over schedule."<ref name="Roan30Years"/> Spielberg himself was not present for the shooting of the final scene where the shark explodes. He believed that the crew were planning to throw him in the water when this scene was complete. It has since become a tradition for Spielberg to be absent when the final scene of a film he directs is being filmed.<ref>{{cite web|work=sharkisstillworking.com|title=Interview with Richard Dreyfuss|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080307073711/http://www.sharkisstillworking.com/video2.asp|accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref>

==Reaction==
===Box office performance===
''Jaws'' was the first film to use "wide release" as a distribution pattern. As such, it is an important film in the history of film distribution and marketing.<ref name="Kochberg31">{{harvnb|Kochberg|1996|p=31}}</ref></blockquote> Prior to the release of ''Jaws'', films typically opened slowly, usually in a few theaters in major cities, which allowed for a series of "premieres." As the success of a film increased, and word of mouth grew, distributors would forward the prints to additional cities across the country. Some films eventually achieved a wide release, such as ''[[The Godfather (film)|The Godfather]]'', but even that blockbuster had originally debuted in just five theaters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f8kMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SGEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1546,2043387&dq|title='Godfather' Proves Crime Does Pay|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=April 17, 1972|agency=New York Times Service|publisher=Google News|accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref>

''Jaws'' was the first film to open nationwide, on hundreds of screens simultaneously, coupled with a national marketing campaign<U+2014>a then-unheard of practice. The film became the first to use extensive television advertising.<ref name="Jaws100million">{{cite news|first=Hass|last=Nancy|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/28/movies/film-the-blockbuster-can-no-longer-live-by-muscle-alone.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Blockbuster Can No Longer Live By Muscle Alone|date=2000-05-28|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> The media blitz "included approximately twenty-five thirty-second advertisements per night on prime-time network TV" between 18-20 June 1975.<ref name="Kochberg31"/> Universal executive [[Sidney Sheinberg]]'s rationale was that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print than if a slow, scaled release were carried out. Scheinberg's gamble paid off, with ''Jaws'' becoming a box office smash hit and the father of the summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/may2006/nf20060522_1037.htm |title=The Biggest Summer Blockbusters |first=Joseph |last=Pisani  |date=May 22, 2006 |work=Business Week |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ayres|first=Alice|coauthor=Alice Fordham|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article730585.ece|title=Man who gave summer blockbuster its bite dies |work=The Times |date=February 14, 2006|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref>

After the release of ''Jaws'', journalists and critics detailed its impact on how films were released in theaters. [[Peter Biskind]] wrote, "[The film] diminish[ed] the importance of print reviews, making it virtually impossible for a film to build slowly, finding its audience by dint of mere quality. ... In a sense, Spielberg was the Trojan horse through which the studios began to reassert their power."<ref name="Friedman176">{{harvnb|Friedman|2006|p=176}}</ref> Author Thomas Schatz also wrote on the film's impact: "If any single film marked the arrival of the New Hollywood, it was ''Jaws'', the Spielberg-directed thriller that recalibrated the profit potential of the Hollywood hit, and redefined its status as a marketable commodity and cultural phenomenon as well. The film brought an emphatic end to Hollywood's five-year recession, while ushering in an era of high-cost, high-tech, high-speed thrillers."<ref name="Friedman176"/> Following the success of ''Jaws'', major studio films have almost universally been distributed and marketed on a national scale. In addition, when summer was usually a season to dump films likely to be poor performers, the success of ''Jaws'' caused studios to shift their action and thriller films out of winter releases.<ref name="Friedman176"/>

When ''Jaws'' was released on June 20, 1975, it opened at 464 theaters.<ref name="Morris44">{{harvnb|Morris|2007|p=44}}</ref> The release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to a total of 675 theaters, the largest simultaneous distribution of a film in motion picture history at the time. During the first weekend of wide release, ''Jaws'' grossed more than $7 million, and was the top grosser for the following five weeks.<ref name="BOMO"/> During its run in theaters, the film beat the $89 million domestic rental record of the reigning box-office champion, ''[[The Exorcist]]'', becoming the first film to reach more than $100 million in U.S. box office receipts.<ref name="Jaws100million"/><ref>{{cite news|first=Helen|last=Kennedy |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/05/27/1997-05-27_spielberg_takes_bite_out_of_.html|work=[[New York Daily News]]|title=Spielberg Takes Bite Out of Life|date=1997-05-27|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref>

''Jaws'' eventually grossed more than $470 million worldwide (${{Inflation|US|.470|1975|2010|r=1}} billion in 2010 dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}) and was the highest grossing box office film until ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' debuted two years later.<ref name="Buckland86">{{harvnb|Buckland|2006|p=86}}</ref><ref name="BOMALL">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/|title=All Time Box Office|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref> ''Jaws'' and ''Star Wars'' are retrospectively considered to have marked the beginning of the new business model in [[Cinema of the United States|American filmmaking]] and the beginning of the end of the [[New Hollywood]] period.

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews. It holds a 100% "Fresh" rating on the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jaws/</ref> In his original review, [[Roger Ebert]] called it "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings".<ref>{{cite news| author=Ebert, Roger | title=Jaws | publisher=rogerebert.suntimes.com |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750101/REVIEWS/501010332/1023| date=1975-01-01| accessdate = 2006-08-03}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s A.D.

It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in ''Jaws'' are those where we don't even see the shark.<ref name="McBride256">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=256}}</ref>

The film was not without its detractors. [[Vincent Canby]], of ''[[The New York Times]]'', said "It's a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims...In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like ''Jaws'', characters are simply functions of the action. They're at its service. Characters are like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary," but also noted that "It's the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun".<ref>{{cite news| author=Canby, Vincent| publisher=nytimes.com|title=Entrapped by 'Jaws' of Fear|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/21/movies/moviesspecial/21JAWS.html| date=1975-06-21| accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Charles Champlin]] disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that  "''Jaws'' is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age." He goes on to say: "It is a coarse-grained and exploitive work which depends on excess for its impact.

==Inspirations and influences==
[[File:UniversalStudiosJawsSharkCloseup.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A large replica of the film's shark hangs from a wooden frame. A sign next to it says "Jaws" and a man standing nearby is about a third of the height of the shark. A pulley and rope are used to pretend to hold the shark's mouth open.|Closeup of the shark]]
''Jaws'' bears similarities to several literary and artistic works, most notably ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]]. The character of Quint strongly resembles [[Moby-Dick#Ahab|Captain Ahab]], the obsessed captain of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'' who devotes his life to hunting a [[sperm whale]]. Quint's monologue reveals his similar vendetta against sharks, and even his boat, the ''Orca'', is named after [[Orca|the only natural enemy of the white shark]]. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to Ahab's death in Melville's novel.<ref>{{cite news | publisher=tonmo.com | author=Ellis, Richard | title=Book and Movie Review: Beast |url=http://www.tonmo.com/reviews/beast.php| accessdate=2006-11-22}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in the original screenplay, which introduced Quint by showing him watching the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|film version of ''Moby-Dick]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author=Benchley, Peter | publisher=jawsmovie.com | title=Jaws Final Draft Screenplay |url=http://www.jawsmovie.com/1/benchscript2.htm| accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> His laughter throughout makes people get up and leave the theater ([[Wesley Strick]]'s screenplay for ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'' features a similar scene). However, the scene from ''Moby-Dick'' could not be licensed from [[Gregory Peck]], the owner of the rights.<ref>{{cite news | author=Woelfel, Jay | publisher=ez-entertainment.net | title="Tribute to Gregory Peck" |url=http://www.ez-entertainment.net/features/Gregory_Peck.htm| accessdate=2006-08-11}}</ref> In the novel and original screenplay, when the ''Orca'', like the ''Pequod'', is sunk by the creature, only the character of Brody survives. Some have also noticed the influences of two 1950s horror films, ''[[The Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author=Carpenter, Gerry | publisher=scifilm.org | title=Creature from the Black Lagoon |url=http://www.scifilm.org/reviews/blacklagoon.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060908002842/http://www.scifilm.org/reviews/blacklagoon.html |archivedate=2006-09-08| accessdate=2006-08-28}}</ref>

Critics such as Neil Sinyard have noticed similarities to [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[An Enemy of the People]]''.<ref name="Sinyard32">{{harvnb|Sinyard|1989|p=32}}</ref> The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town's medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and form of revenue, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in ''Jaws'' by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. In the film, Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a "deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play".<ref name="Sinyard32"/>

''Jaws'' was a key film in establishing the benefits of a wide national release backed by heavy media advertising, rather than a progressive release that let a film slowly enter new markets and build support over a period of time.<ref>{{cite web | work=pbs.org | title=Jaws <U+2013> The monster that ate Hollywood |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/hollywood/business/jaws.html| accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> Rather than let the film gain notice by word-of-mouth, Hollywood launched a successful television marketing campaign for the film, which added another $700,000 to the cost.<ref name="SharkTale">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Neil|publisher=BBC News|title=Shark tale that changed Hollywood|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4600557.stm|date=2005-06-03|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref>

Similar to the fear of showers created by the pivotal scene in the 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''Jaws'' caused viewers to be afraid to enter the ocean.<ref name="Gordon33">{{harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=33}}</ref><ref name="Jackson23">{{harvnb|Jackson|2007|p=23}}</ref> The film was credited with reduced beach attendance in the summer of 1975.<ref name="Reelviews" />

Although it is considered a thriller-horror classic, the film is widely recognized as being responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior.<ref name="NGSharks">{{cite news|last=Lovgren|first=Stefan|work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]| title="Jaws" at 30: Film Stoked Fear, Study of Great White Sharks|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0615_050615_jawssharks.html|date=2005-06-15|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> Author Peter Benchley stated that he would not have written the original novel had he known what sharks are really like in the wild.<ref>{{cite news | author=Metcalf, Geoff | publisher=geoffmetcalf.com | title=Great white shark, the fragile giant |url=http://www.geoffmetcalf.com/qa/19634.html| accessdate=2006-08-04}}</ref> Benchley later wrote ''Shark Trouble'', a non-fiction book about shark behavior, and ''Shark Life'', another non-fiction book describing his dives with sharks. Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to convince the public that sharks should be protected.<ref>{{cite news|author=Chapple, Mike | publisher=icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk | title=Great white hope|page=3|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/entertainment/previewsandreviews/tm_objectid=15919800%26method=full%26siteid=50061%26page=3%26headline=great%2dwhite%2dhope-name_page.html|  date=2005-09-01|accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref>

''Jaws'' set the template for many future horror films, so much so that the script for [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 science fiction film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' was pitched to studio executives with one tag line: "''Jaws'' in space."<ref>{{cite web | author=Hays, Matthew | publisher=montrealmirror.com | title=A Space Odyssey |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2003/102303/film1.html| accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

==Music==
[[John Williams]] contributed the [[film score]], which was ranked sixth on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores|100 Years of Film Scores]]. The main "shark" theme, a simple alternating pattern of two [[note]]s, E and F,<ref name="Film Score Friday">{{cite news |author=Matessino, Michael |publisher=filmscoremonthly.com |title=Letter in response to "A Study of Jaws' Incisive Overture To Close Off the Century" |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/1999/24_Sep---Film_Score_Friday.asp| date=1999-09-24 |accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref> became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger (see [[leading-tone]]). Williams described the theme as having the "effect of grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable."<ref name="Friedman174">{{harvnb|Friedman|2006|p=174}}</ref> The soundtrack piece was performed by tuba player [[Tommy Johnson (session musician)|Tommy Johnson]]. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that he wanted it to sound "a little more threatening".<ref>{{cite news |author=Chaundy, Bob |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |title=Spies, sports, and sharks |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6107576.stm |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2006-11-06}}</ref> When the piece was first played for Spielberg, he was said to have laughed at Williams, thinking that it was a joke. Spielberg later said that without Williams' score the film would have been only half as successful, and Williams acknowledges that the score jumpstarted his career.<ref name="Jaws"/> He had previously scored Spielberg's feature film debut ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'' and went on to collaborate with him on almost all of his films.<ref name="Friedman174"/>

The score contains echoes of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', particularly the opening of "The Adoration of the Earth" and "Auguries of Spring".<ref>{{cite news |author=Scheurer, Timothy E. |publisher=findarticles.com | title=John Williams and film music since 1971 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2822/is_n1_v21/ai_20633217 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070213082036/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2822/is_n1_v21/ai_20633217 |archivedate=2007-02-13| accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> The music has drawn comparisons to [[Bernard Herrman]]'s score for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the ominous music for the off-screen hunter in ''[[Bambi]]'', in which the music enhances the presence of an unseen terror, in this case the shark.<ref name="Overture">{{cite news |author=Tylski, Alexandre |publisher=filmscoremonthly.com |title=A Study of Jaws' Incisive Overture To Close Off the Century |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/1999/14_Sep---A_Study_of_Jaws_Incisive_Overture.asp |accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref>

There are various interpretations on the meaning and effectiveness of the theme. Some have thought the two-note expression is intended to mimic the shark's heartbeat, beginning slow and controlled as the killer hunts and rising to a frenzied, shrieking climax as it approaches its prey.<ref>{{cite web | work=filmtracks.com | title=Jaws |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/jaws.html| accessdate=2006-08-25}}</ref> Others have stated that the music at first sounds like the creaking and groaning of a boat, and therefore is inaudible when it begins so that it never seems to start, but simply rises out of the sounds of the film. One critic believes the true strength of the score is its ability to create a "harsh silence," abruptly cutting away from the music right before it climaxes.<ref name="Overture"/> Furthermore, the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme, since the score is never used as a [[Red herring (narrative)|red herring]].<ref name="Friedman174"/> It only plays when the real shark appears. This is later exploited when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction. Regardless of the meaning behind it, the theme is widely acknowledged as one of the most recognized scores of all time.<ref name="Reelviews"/>

The [[Jaws (soundtrack)|original soundtrack for ''Jaws'']] was released by MCA in 1975, and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that John Williams redid for the album. In 2000, two versions of the score were released: one in a re-recording of the entire ''Jaws'' score performed by the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]] and conducted by [[Joel McNeely]]; and another to coincide with the release of the 25th anniversary DVD by Decca/Universal, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score. Fans prefer the Decca release over the Var<U+00E8>se Sarabande re-recording.<ref>{{cite news |author=Dursin, Andy | publisher=filmscoremonthly.com | title=Thoughts on the Anniversary Video & CD Releases of Jaws|url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2000/25_Jul---What_Lies_Beneath_the_X_Men.asp| accessdate=2006-08-25}}</ref>

==Releases and sequels==
The first [[Laserdisc]] title marketed in North America was the MCA [[DiscoVision]] release of ''Jaws'' in 1978. A second Laserdisc was released in 1991, before a third and final release came under the MCA/Universal Home Video's "Signature Collection" imprint. This release was an elaborate boxset, which included the film, along with deleted scenes and outtakes, a new two-hour documentary on the making of the film, a copy of the novel ''Jaws'', and a CD of John Williams' soundtrack.<ref name="dvdreview">{{cite web |title=Jaws (1975) |url=http://www.dvdreview.com/reviews/pages/1352.shtml |work=DVD Review |date=June 13, 2000 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref>

''Jaws'' was first released on DVD in 2000 for the film's 25th anniversary. It featured a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (an edited version of the one featured on the 1995 laserdisc release), with interviews from Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Peter Benchley and other cast and crew members. Other extras included deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, production photos, and storyboards.<ref name="dvdreview"/> In June 2005, on the 30th anniversary of the film's release, a festival named JawsFest was held in [[Martha's Vineyard]].<ref>{{cite web |work=mvy.com |title=JawsFest |url=http://www.mvy.com/jaws/ |accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> ''Jaws'' was then re-released on DVD, this time including the full two-hour documentary produced by Laurent Bouzereau for the LaserDisc. As well as containing most of the same bonus features the previous DVD contained, it included a previously unavailable interview with Spielberg conducted on the set of ''Jaws'' in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/dvd/jaws |title=Jaws (12) |work=Total Film |date=August 29, 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref>

In the 2000s, an independent group of fans produced a feature length documentary. ''[[The Shark is Still Working]]'' features interviews with a range of cast and crew from the film, and some from the sequels. It is narrated by Roy Scheider and dedicated to Peter Benchley who died in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=First look: 'The Shark is Still Working' |work=spielbergfilms.com |url=http://www.spielbergfilms.com/jaws/1346 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070317211802/http://www.spielbergfilms.com/jaws/1346 |archivedate=2007-03-17 |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Shark is Still Working |url=http://www.sharkisstillworking.com/ |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

''Jaws'' spawned three sequels, which failed to match the success of the original. Indeed, their combined domestic grosses barely cover half of the original's.<ref name="BOMO">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jaws.htm|title=Jaws - Total Grosses|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> Spielberg was unavailable to do a sequel, as he was working on ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' with Richard Dreyfuss.<ref name="McBride257">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=257}}</ref> ''[[Jaws 2]]'' was directed by [[Jeannot Szwarc]]; Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton reprised their roles from the original film. The next film, ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'', directed by Joe Alves, was released in the [[3-D film|3-D]] format, although the effect did not transfer to television or home video, where it was renamed ''Jaws 3''. [[Dennis Quaid]] as Michael Brody and [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] starred in the movie. ''[[Jaws: The Revenge]]'', directed by [[Joseph Sargent]], featured the return of Lorraine Gary and is considered one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst movies ever made]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|title=The 25 Worst Sequels Ever Made <U+2013> 10.

In February 2010, film website [[Cinema Blend]] reported that a source from Universal Pictures has indicated that Universal is "strongly considering" remaking ''Jaws'' in [[3-D film|3-D]], following the commercial success of ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a202152/universal-planning-3d-jaws-remake.html |title=Universal planning 3D 'Jaws' remake? |work=Digital Spy |date=2010-02-09 |accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref> The source also reported that ''[[30 Rock]]'' star [[Tracy Morgan]] was considered to portray Matt Hopper in the remake, which they say could be more comedic and make more use of special effects.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19824 |title=Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws' Returning to Theaters in 3-D? |work=Bloody Disgusting |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> The studio has not officially commented upon the rumor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Universal-Planning-A-3D-Remake-Of-Jaws-16954.html |title=Universal Planning A 3D Remake Of Jaws With Tracy Morgan? |first=Dave |last=Zani |work=Cinema Blend |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.sky.com/jaws-to-be-remade-in-3d |title=Jaws To Be Remade in 3D? |work=Sky Movies |accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>
