==Life==
Born '''John Thomas Barber''' on 21 December 1774 in the parish of [[St Marylebone]], London, he assumed in 1812, for unknown reasons, the additional name of '''Beaumont''' (which was retained by his descendants) and was often known as "Barber Beaumont".

===Artist===
An accomplished painter, Barber Beaumont focused on [[history painting]] and [[Portrait miniature|miniature painting]]. He had his works displayed at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in [[London]] and was appointed miniature painter to the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]], the future king William IV of [[Great Britain]].<ref name=hathway527>{{cite book |last=Hathaway |first=Sibyl |authorlink=Sibyl Hathaway |coauthors= |title=Dame of Sark: An Autobiography. 2nd printing. |year=1962 |publisher=[[Coward-McCann, Inc]] |location=[[New York]] |id= | url =http://www.archive.org/details/dameofsark006367mbp

===Rifle corps===
In 1803, when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] threatened to invade England, Beaumont raised a rifle corps named [[The Duke of Cumberland's Sharp Shooters]].<ref name=nc/> His troops were reported to be such accurate shots that on one occasion he held a target in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[London]] while the corps fired at it from a distance of 150 yards.<ref name=nc/>  In 1835 the corps changed its name to Royal Victoria Rifle Club and then later became Queen Victoria's Rifles.<ref name=nc/>

===In  business===
Beaumont established in 1806 the Provident Institution and Savings Bank in [[Covent Garden]]. In 1807 he founded the County Fire and the Provident Life insurance offices.<ref name=DNB>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Beaumont, John Thomas Barber}}</ref> In 1816<U+2013>8 he took on [[Thomas Bignold]] of [[Norwich Union]] in a costly publicity war. Beaumont was a supporter of Queen [[Caroline of Brunswick]] in her long-running dispute with [[George IV of England]], and had the County Fire office in [[Regent Street]] decorated with lamps to celebrate her tactical victory over the royal divorce bill in 1820.<ref>Robin Pearson, ''Insuring the Industrial Revolution: fire insurance in Great Britain, 1700-1850'' (2004), p. 158; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=orWMbX2RWTgC&pg=PA158 Google Books].</ref> He resisted a fraudulent claim made on the fire company in 1823 by Thomas Thurtell, and ultimately secured the committal of Thurtell and associates to [[Newgate Prison]]. [[John Thurtell]], the brother of Thomas, took up the quarrel, and made an attempt to murder Beaumont, which failed. Beaumont also took an active part in the exposure of a fraudulent insurance office, the West Middlesex, writing a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' about it in 1839.<ref name=DNB/><ref>John Francis, ''Annals, Anecdotes and Legends: a chronicle of life assurance'' (1853); [http://www.archive.org/stream/annalsanecdotesl00franrich#page/230/mode/2up archive.org].</ref> 

Beaumont, an investor in South America and supporter of its independence from colonial rule, knew [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], during his stay in London, and set up the Rio de La Plata Agricultural Association, with shares held also by [[Rudolph Ackermann]]. In 1825 British emigrants sailed to what is now Argentina, settling at [[Entre R<U+00ED>os Province|Entre R<U+00ED>os]] and [[San Pedro, Buenos Aires Province|San Pedro]]. The [[Cisplatine War]], between the [[United Provinces of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] and the [[Empire of Brazil]], intervened to make further settlement and even communication difficult. The troubled affairs of the intended colony were described in an 1828 book ''Travels in Buenos Ayres'' written by John Augustus Barber Beaumont, son of Barber Beaumont, who had tried to help the remaining colonists.<ref>Joselyn M. Almeida, ''Reimagining the Transatlantic, 1780-1890'' (2011), p. 163 with note 26; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vf8QAz4ROdoC&pg=PA163 Google Books].</ref><ref>''Belle assembl<U+00E9>e: or, Court and fashionable magazine'' vol. 7 (1828), p. 291; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4sERAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA291 Google Books].</ref><ref>Desmond Gregory, ''Brute New World: the rediscovery of Latin America in the early nineteenth century'' (1992), p. 27;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V2hBAHD9BOUC&pg=PA27 Google Books].</ref>

In 1825 Beaumont fought against the Board of Stamps, which charged his company with defrauding the [[Inland Revenue]], and came off victorious.<ref name=DNB/> In 1835 he founded the Provident Institution or Bank for Savings in London's [[Covent Garden]] district.<ref name=nc/>

===Death===
Beaumont was a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], and of the [[Geological Society]]. He died on 15 May 1841 at his residence in Regent Street.<ref name=GM>''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'', vol. 170, pp. 96<U+2013>8; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BvAIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA96 Google Books].</ref>

==Works==
In 1802 Beaumont published an illustrated ''Tour throughout South Wales and Monmouthshire''. In 1803 he wrote articles on sharpshooters and defence; and set up a periodical, the ''[[Weekly Register]]''.<ref>''[[The European Magazine]]'' vol. 81, June 1822, pp. 491<U+2013>3; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tPIRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA491 Google Books].</ref>
[[File:Carew Castle Barber.jpg|thumb|[[Carew Castle]], engraving by [[Samuel Alken]] after John Thomas Barber.]] 
In 1816 he published an essay on ''Provident or Parish Banks''; and in 1821 an ''Essay on Criminal Jurisprudence''.<ref name=DNB/>

==Legacy==
In 1839<U+2013>40 Beaumont founded the '''Beaumont Philosophical Institution''', in Beaumont Square in [[Mile End]], [[E postcode area|E1]], in London's [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Borough of Tower Hamlets]].<ref name=nc/> The Square was part of the Beaumont Estate, a housing development, and the Institution was on the north-west corner of the square.<ref>[http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.asp?ID=THM008 London Gardens Online, ''Beaumont Square Gardens''].</ref> It was created for the welfare and entertainment of people in the neighbourhood. The opening was on 29 October 1840, with a [[temperance movement|temperance]] meeting led by [[Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope]].<ref>[[James Dawson Burns]], ''The Temperance Dictionary'' (1861), p. 202; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6pIBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA202 Google Books].</ref> The Institution comprised a museum, reading-room, and chapel. When Beaumont died in 1841 he left <U+00A3>13,000 for the maintenance  of the institute.<ref name=nc/><ref>{{ODNBweb|id=12542|title=Harwood, Philip|first=R. K.|last=Webb}}</ref> In 1844 the museum offered [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], and [[conchology]], and there were singing classes and concerts.<ref>''[[Phrenological Journal]]'' vol. 17 (1844), p. 58; [http://www.archive.org/stream/phrenologicaljo07unkngoog#page/n76/mode/2up archive.org].</ref> Initially the chapel was used for broad-minded services, where the ministers were [[Philip Harwood]], and Thomas Wood of the [[Brixton]] Unitarian congregation, and using a liturgy by [[Robert Fellowes (philanthropist)|Robert Fellowes]].<ref>Mark S. Micale, Robert L. Dietle, Peter Gay, ''Enlightenment, Passion, Modernity: historical essays in European thought and culture'' (2000), p. 121; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2Xv0ITuzSqwC&pg=PA121 Google Books].</ref> By 1851 the "moral lectures" required by the founder for Sunday mornings had been transferred to weekday evenings, and the income of <U+00A3>400 per annum went mainly on concerts.<ref>[[James William Hudson]], ''The History of Adult Education'' (1851), p. 173; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zpJDAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA173 Google Books].</ref>

The Institution was administered by the '''Beaumont Trust''': the initial trustees were Fellowes with Henry Churchill, [[John Elliotson]], [[Alexander Henderson (physician)|Alexander Henderson]], [[Charles Hennell]], and Henry B. Kerr.<ref name=GM/> In its original form it closed down in 1879.<ref>Deborah E. B. Weiner, ''Architecture and Social Reform in Late-Victorian London'' (1994), p. 186; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2hYNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA186 Google Books].</ref> Its successor, the '''People's Palace''', was opened in 1887; it was built by the Trust on the [[Mile End Road]] site of the old [[Bancroft's School]], under the influence of [[Walter Besant]], and to a design by [[Edward Robert Robson]]. It later came under the control of East London College. In 1931 fire damage necessitated the construction of the '''New People's Palace''' on an adjacent site; it was opened in 1937.<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-505211-the-former-new-peoples-palace-bow British Listed Buildings, ''The Former New Peoples Palace, Bow'']</ref><ref>[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=15816&inst_id=118&nv1=browse&nv2=sub Archives in London and the M25 area, ''Beaumont Institution and People's Palace''].</ref>

In the longer term the Institution  was one of the organisations leading up to the founding of [[Queen Mary, University of London]], which now has a Barber Beaumont Chair of Humanities, currently occupied by [[Quentin Skinner]].<ref>[http://www.history.qmul.ac.uk/staff/skinnerq.html Queen Mary official page, ''Professor Quentin Skinner, FBA Barber Beaumont Professor of the Humanities''].</ref>
