Garea often appeared on WCW's wrestling programme broadcast on the [[Nine Network]] while in Australia. He was the first New Zealander to appear on ''Big Time Wrestling'', a short-lived Australian programme aired in his home country in 1973, and joined New Zealand promoter [[Steve Rickard]]'s All Star-Pro Wrestling after Barnett left for the United States the following year. In 1975, he and [[The Bushwhackers|The Sheepherders]] ([[Butch Miller]] and [[Luke Williams (wrestler)|Luke Williams]]) were among the first standout talent of ''[[On the Mat]]'' and started touring the country. Garea also wrestled overseas as well visiting such faraway countries as Thailand, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Japan in Asia, the South Pacific islands of Fiji and Tahiti, and in the United States.<ref name="Bio"/> He was able to get bookings in various [[List of NWA territories|NWA territories]] and, partly due to his connections with his brother Tony, briefly wrestled for the [[World Wrestling Federation]].<ref name="Simpson"/><ref name="Byers">{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/131232/Into-the-Indies-03.09.10:--NWA-On-the-Mat.htm |title=Into the Indies 03.09.10: NWA On the Mat |author=Byers, Ryan |date=March 9, 2010 |work=Columns |publisher=411mania.com |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>

Garea would continue to appear on ''On the Mat'' for nearly a decade<ref name="Simpson"/> during which time he faced off against many of the top names not only in Australasia, such as Steve Rickard, [[John da Silva]], [[Robert Bruce (wrestler)|Robert Bruce]] and [[Al Hobman]], but from around the world including former World Champion [[Tiger Jeet Singh]], [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]] and [[Mark Lewin]] from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], and Big Bad John, [[Rocky Johnson]], [[Don Muraco]], and [[Rick Martel]] from the [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]].

After the cancellation of ''On the Mat'' in 1984, Garea remained with All Star-Pro Wrestling and eventually became involved in a near 5-year feud with [[Bruno Bekkar]] over the [[NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship]] during the mid-to late 1980s, winning the title twice, before losing the title back to Bekkar in 1990.<ref name="Wrestling-Titles">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/nz/nz-h.html |title=New Zealand Heavyweight Title |author= |year=2003 |work=Wrestling-Titles.com |publisher=Puroresu Dojo |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> Garea went into semi-retirement with All Star-Pro Wrestling closing in 1992 and eventually became a rancher with a sizable [[lifestyle block]] in [[Warkworth, New Zealand|Warkworth]].<ref name="Simpson"/><ref name="Bio"/>
