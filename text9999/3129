'''G.W.C. Tait''', also known as '''George William Campbell Tait''' (April 28, 1912 &ndash; March 9, 1993), was an inventor and pioneer in the field of health physics in Canada and at the Chalk River Project.

Tait lived in Canada and Vienna. His residences included [[Deep River, Ontario]], [[Canada]], and [[Gibsons, British Columbia]], [[Canada]] and [[Vienna, Austria]].
1951-1958, Head of Radiation Hazard Control, National Research Council, [[Chalk River Laboratories|Chalk River Project]], [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]].
1958-1960, Director, Division of Health Safety and Waste Disposal, [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], Vienna, Austria.<ref>Tait, G.W.C. (2 June 1960). Effects of Radiation on Man: An International Experiment. The New Scientist. 7(185): 1397-1401.</ref>
Tait was involved in early work at the Chalk River Project and during his productive career produced at least two patents that involved gas sampling equipment.<ref>Tait, G. W. C. (1955).
