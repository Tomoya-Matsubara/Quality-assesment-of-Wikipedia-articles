'''California State University, Los Angeles''' (also known as '''Cal State L.A.''', '''CSULA''', or "'CSLA"') is a [[public university]], part of the [[California State University]] system. The campus is located in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles, California, United States]], in the [[University Hills, Los Angeles, California|University Hills]] district at the center of Los Angeles [[metropolitan area]] just five miles from Los Angeles civic and cultural center. Located next to two major [[interstate highway system]]s; [[Interstate 10]] Freeway and [[Interstate 710]] Freeway.

Serving approximately 21,000 students primarily from the [[greater Los Angeles area]]. CSULA has more than 190,000 alumni. CSULA operates year round on the quarter system. Four quarters, each 11 weeks in duration. Cal State L.A. is organized into six colleges that incorporate 50 academic departments and divisions offering a variety of [[academic major|majors]].<ref>http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/aa/dcc/indexcollege.htm</ref> Six colleges offer nationally recognized science, arts, business, criminal justice, engineering, nursing, education and humanities programs at Cal State LA. CSULA is home to the critically-acclaimed Luckman Jazz Orchestra and to a unique university center for gifted students as young as 10.

The 175-acre hilltop campus core is home to the nation's first Charter College of Education, a [[NASA]]-funded SPACE program, a [[National Science Foundation]] funded environmental research center and other award-winning engineering programs. [[U.S. News & World Report|U.S. News]] has ranked CSULA's undergraduate business program as one of the best in the Los Angeles area.

The teacher credential program has awarded more credentials in the state of California than any other public institution. Cal State L.A. also has the nation's largest early/pre-teen collegiate program, and the only graduate Criminalistics program west of the Mississippi River. [[Cal State LA Studios|The Television, Film, and Media Studies]] program is one of the foremost film schools in the CSU system, coordinating film and TV production experiences with the neighboring [[Hollywood]] film industry. The university awards more bachelor's degrees to [[Hispanic]]s than any other California [[college]] or [[university]].

It is also home to the [[Los Angeles County High School for the Arts]], a prestigious arts high school, notable for being the only arts high school in Los Angeles that allows for students from any district within Los Angeles County to attend. Classrooms are shared with Cal State L.A., however, LACHSA activities tend to be separate from those of Cal State L.A's. Notable LACHSA alumni include singer [[Josh Groban]], actress [[Jenna Elfman]].<ref>http://www.lachsa.org</ref> actor/singer [[Corbin Bleu]] and renowned Los Angeles [[Clippers]] executive Ron "Country Club" Kobata.

==History==
[[Image:CSULA GOLDEN EAGLE.jpg||right|thumb|'''Golden Eagle''' A bronze sculpture of CSULA mascot.]]
The campus is nestled among rolling hills on a site that once housed one of [[California]]'s 36 original adobes, built in [[1776]] by [[Franciscan]] missionaries and destroyed by fire in 1908. These lands once were part of a Spanish land grant known as the Rancho Rosa Castilla, created by the family of Juan Batista Batz, a [[Basque people|Basque]] rancher from northern [[Spain]] who settled here in the 1850s. The inspiration for the name of the rancho, according to local historians, was the wild rose that once grew near the ranch home.

CSULA was founded in [[1947]] by an act of the California [[legislature]] and opened for classes on the campus of [[Los Angeles City College]], itself the former location of [[UCLA]], as the Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences. P. Victor Peterson was LACC's first president. The shared-campus experiment proved to be unwieldy and the school moved to its present location in [[1955]].<ref>http://www.lacitycollege.edu/public/75thAnniversary/75th_pages/history.htm</ref>

In [[1964]] the school was renamed California State College at Los Angeles (CSCLA) when it became part of the California State College (CSC) system. In [[1972]], CSCLA was awarded University status and was renamed the California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA).

==Campus life and cost of university==
[[Image:CSULA 004.jpg|left|thumb|CSULA main walkway]]
Cal State LA has one of the lowest tuition fees, even though quarterly fees have nearly doubled since the 2001-02 academic year. Tuition and fees for in-state is $3,035 and $11,171 for out-of-state. There are different places inside the campus where they serve food and coffee. In addition the university food court owned by [[Pepsi-Co]], offers a selection of fast food chain restaurants that include [[El Pollo Loco]], [[Carl's Jr.]], Rice Garden and Kikka Sushi. A $30 million University-Student Union building under construction scheduled to be completed on September 2007 will offer a place for students and faculty to congregate and interact after or before class.

===Student housing===
First on-campus housing was opened on June 1984 and three years later second residential life complex was opened. CSULA has a student housing complex where students can rent a house at double occupancy for $413.00 per month (as of September 2006). During [[1984 Summer Olympics]] that took place in [[Los Angeles]] CSULA student houses were upgraded and expanded because it housed the athletics of the 1984 Summer Olympics.<ref>http://www.calstatela.edu/univ/housing/index.htm</ref>

===''University Times''===
[[Image:CSULA CAFE.jpg|thumb|right|Cafe Dolcini located at King Hall]]
The ''University Times'' is a student-run newspaper. The first student newspaper, at that time called ''The College Times'', was published in June 1948 for the first time. In 1965 ''The College Times'' was named the best newspaper by California Intercollegiate Press. On [[October 2]], [[1972]] ''The College Times'' changed its name to ''University Times'', in accordance with the change in university status.

In January 2007, ''The University Times'' changed its publication schedule from a twice weekly paper to a weekly paper, publishing on Tuesdays. The format change to a style similar to the alternative newspaper, LA Weekly, allowed for a greater number of pages to run and allow more in-depth coverage of news stories relevant to the student body and surrounding community.

During the Summer of 2007, the University Times underwent a transition period as the paper started a merger process with its new online presence, Cool State. The paper scaled back production to four issues at the end of the Summer quarter and began to gear up for a formal re-launching with the start of the Fall Quarter.

==Parking and public transportation==
[[Image:CSULA 002.jpg|left|thumb|Auxilary Services]]
Cal State LA has ample parking spaces for its students and staff. Student permits for parking at Cal State LA cost about $84 (as of September 2007) for a one quarter parking permit.

Cal State LA is uniquely commuter friendly. There are several large parking structures, and surface lots for automobiles. In addition, the school is home to the first commuter rail station on a college campus, the [[Cal State L.A. (Metrolink station)|Cal State L.A. station]] on [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink's]] [[Metrolink San Bernardino Line|San Bernardino Line]], which opened in October 1994. The school is also accessible from the [[California State University, Los Angeles (LACMTA station)|California State University, Los Angeles]] station on the [[El Monte Busway]]; both stations are located at the south end of the campus. [[Metro Local]] lines 665, 71, and 256, as well as neighborhood shuttles serve the school.

==Programs==
[[Image:CSULA 001.jpg|thumb|right|CSULA]]  
===Early Entrance Program=== 
The [[Early Entrance Program (CSU)|Early Entrance Program]] (EEP) is designed to allow students between the ages of 11 and 16 to enter college at a significantly early age. Each year, 30 students are chosen for this opportunity. Criteria include grades, test performance, a maturity evaluation, and successful completion of two Cal State L.A. courses. Once admitted, 'EEPsters' take both regular and honors classes, and follow a normal course of college-level study. Altogether, the program's participants number about 150. Some of the programs that provides to students and community include an [[National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH]] and Rockefeller-supported humanities center, [[NASA]]-funded center for space research.

===Forensic Sciences===
The school has had a growing [[Forensics|forensic science]] program, which has been a part of the school curriculum since the founding of the school. The university<U+2019>s Department of [[Criminal Justice]] and [[Criminalistics]] is in the process of relocating from its current location in King Hall to the new Los Angeles Regional [[Crime Lab]]. The new Hertzberg-Davis Forensic Science Center, which was dedicated on [[May 11]], [[2007]], will jointly house, besides the department, the [[LAPD]]<U+2019>s Scientific Investigation Division, the L.A. County Sheriff<U+2019>s Department Scientific Services Bureau and the California Forensic Science Institute at Cal State L.A.

==Future developments==
[[Image:CSULA 003.jpg|thumb|left|CSULA Physical Sciences Building]]
The University has several construction projects slated for the next five years. Construction on wing An of the new science complex, which was constructed on the site of the university's former tennis and basketball courts, is expected to be completed by Fall of 2007. In addition, construction on Wing B has begun as of the Spring of 2007. The maintenance yard at the south entrance of the campus will be redesigned to replace the exiting shacks with one building.

Another building has been proposed at the north end of campus, in front of parking lot F. The new building will house additional classrooms for the Los Angeles High School for Performing Arts. Construction on that building is set to begin sometime in 2009. Another building scheduled for construction is the Steve and Eva Stern Charter School, which will be located in the southern end of Parking Lot 2. There is no scheduled construction timeline set for the charter school.
