{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy XIII'''''|<U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30A4><U+30CA><U+30EB><U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30B8><U+30FC>XIII|Fainaru Fantaj<U+012B> S<U+0101>t<U+012B>n}} is a [[Video game console|console]] [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square Enix]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and the [[Xbox 360]]. Released in 2009 in Japan and 2010 in North America and [[PAL region]]s, it is the thirteenth installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. The game includes fast-paced [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Parties and battles|combat]], a new system for the series for determining which abilities are developed for the characters called "Crystarium", and a customizable "Paradigm" system to control which abilities are used by the characters. ''Final Fantasy XIII'' includes elements from the previous games in the series, such as [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Summoner|summoned monsters]], [[chocobo]]s, and [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Airships and transport|airships]].

The game takes place in the fictional floating world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier Lightning begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.

Development began in 2004 and the game was first announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) 2006. ''Final Fantasy XIII'' is the flagship title of the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy|Fabula Nova Crystallis]]'' collection of ''Final Fantasy'' games and is the first game to use Square Enix's [[Crystal Tools]] engine. ''Final Fantasy XIII'' received mostly positive reviews from [[video game journalism|video game publications]], which praised the game's graphics, presentation, and battle system. Reviewers were more mixed in their opinion about the game's story and [[Nonlinear gameplay|linearity]] compared to previous games in the series. Selling 1.7&nbsp;million copies in Japan in 2009, ''Final Fantasy XIII'' became the fastest-selling title in the history of the series. As of May 2010, the game had sold 6.2&nbsp;million copies  worldwide. On January 18, 2011, Square Enix announced a sequel titled ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]'', to be released later that year.

==Gameplay==
The player directly controls the on-screen character through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360<U+00B0> view of the surroundings.<ref name="MANUAL10"/> The world of ''Final Fantasy XIII'' is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier ''Final Fantasy'' games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the [[overworld|world]] by foot or by [[Chocobo]].<ref name="MANUAL16"/> Players may save their game to a hard disk drive using save stations, where the player can also purchase items from retail networks or upgrade their weapons.<ref name="MANUAL19"/> An in-game datalog provides a [[bestiary]] and incidental information about the world of ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name="MANUAL12"/> The ''Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International'' version of the game, released in Japan, also contains an "Easy" mode option.<ref name="VG247epilogue"/>

===Battle system===
[[File:Final Fantasy XIII battle.png|left|thumb|250px|The ''Final Fantasy XIII'' battle system, with the "Paradigm Shift" option, the Active Time Battle (ATB) bar filling beneath it with five slots and two actions queued, and the three active characters' health and roles displayed. The enemy's name and damage percentage are shown in the upper right corner.]]

As in ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', enemies are integrated into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles.<ref name="SEe306"/> A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Parties and battles|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] and first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Under this system, the player selects an action from the [[Menu (computing)|menus]], such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six.<ref name="IGN update"/> The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.<ref name="IGN update"/> 

Each enemy has a meter, called a chain counter, consisting of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to the enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air.<ref name="gradar_review" /> The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Warrior|warrior]]-type role; Ravager, a [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Black Mage|black mage]]-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a [[Final Fantasy character jobs#White Mage|White Mage]]-type role which can heal; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthens allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities.<ref name="eurog_review"/> Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle.<ref name="eurog_review"/> The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.<ref name="gradar_review" />

Each character can summon a specific Eidolon into battle.<ref name="IGN update"/> These [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Summoner|summoned creatures]] include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr.<ref name="SEofficial"/> When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party.<ref name="IGNpreview"/> While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, in which the Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.<ref name="1UPpreview"/>

===Crystarium===
The Crystarium is a leveling system consisting of six crystals and resembles the [[Final Fantasy X#Sphere Grid|Sphere Grid]] from ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''.<ref name="1UPcryst"/><ref name="OFFGUIDE154"/> Each crystal in the Crystarium represents one of the six Paradigms, and is divided into ten levels. Each level contains various nodes that supply bonuses to health, strength, or magic, or provide new abilities and accessory slots. These nodes are connected by a semi-linear path. The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points, which are awarded after defeating enemies.<ref name="MANUAL36"/> The full Crystarium is not available to the player at the beginning of the game; at specific points in the game's plot, the player gains access to new crystals or levels.<ref name="EUROGcryst"/>

==Plot==
=== Setting ===
''Final Fantasy XIII'' is set within the world of Gran Pulse. Central to the story is Cocoon, a massive artificial sphere that floats above Pulse's surface and is ruled by the Sanctum, a [[Theocracy|theocratic]] government. The two worlds are controlled by fal'Cie ({{pron-en|f<U+00E6>l<U+02C8>si<U+02D0>}}), beings with godlike power. The Cocoon fal'Cie are responsible for keeping Cocoon floating, as well as providing light and water to the people that live inside. Each fal'Cie handles a specific task.<ref name="DATALOGfalcie"/> The fal'Cie have the capability of marking the humans that live in Pulse and Cocoon as their servants. These servants, called l'Cie, are branded with a symbol representing either Pulse or Cocoon and are given a "Focus"<U+2014>a task to complete.<ref name="xbox trailer"/> If the l'Cie complete their task in time, they are transformed to crystal and according to legend gain eternal life; otherwise they become mindless monsters called Cie'th.<ref name="HopeScan"/> The l'Cie are not explicitly told their Focus, but are instead given visions that they must interpret.<ref name="DATALOGlcie"/>

Several hundred years before the events of the game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse attacked and ripped a large hole in Cocoon.<ref name="DATALOGwar"/> Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power.<ref name="DATALOGartifacts"/> The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and PSICOM, the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse.<ref name="DATALOGpsicom"/> The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans.<ref name="DATALOGamp"/>

===Story===
[[File:Final Fantasy XIII Cast.png|256px|thumb|The playable cast of ''Final Fantasy XIII''. From left to right: [[Characters of Final Fantasy XIII#Sazh Katzroy|Sazh Katzroy]], [[Characters of Final Fantasy XIII#Snow Villiers|Snow Villiers]], [[Characters of Final Fantasy XIII#Hope Estheim|Hope Estheim]], [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]],  [[Characters of Final Fantasy XIII#Oerba Yun Fang|Oerba Yun Fang]], and [[Characters of Final Fantasy XIII#Oerba Dia Vanille|Oerba Dia Vanille]]]]

''Final Fantasy XIII'' begins in Cocoon as the citizens of the town of Bodhum are being evicted, or Purged, from Cocoon after coming in contact with something from Pulse.<ref name="DATALOGpurge"/> Over the course of the game, the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous 13 days, which began when a fal'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum. Lightning's sister Serah had found the fal'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l'Cie by it. Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah.  In the subsequent battle, Snow leads his resistance group, NORA, to rescue the Purge exiles. Several of them, including Hope's mother, are killed. As Snow heads to the fal'Cie Anima to save Serah, he is joined by two of the exiles: Hope and Vanille. The two groups meet at the fal'Cie, and find Serah just as she turns to crystal. Anima then brands them all as l'Cie and they are cast out into a different part of Cocoon. During this transformation, the newly crested l'Cie all have the same vision: a monster called Ragnarok.<ref name="DATALOGragnarok"/> The group, arguing over the ambiguous nature of the dreamed Focus, find Serah in her crystallized form; Snow remains with her as the others leave. 

Snow meets Cid and Fang after being captured and detained aboard the [[airship]] ''Lindblum''. Meanwhile, the others escape from PSICOM, but are separated during an air strike; Hope and Lightning travel to Palumpolum, while Sazh and Vanille travel to Nautilus. In Lightning's scenario, she unintentionally supports Hope's goal of killing Snow as revenge for his mother's death.<ref name="DATALOGassassinate"/> In Vanille's scenario, Sazh discusses how his son Dajh was turned into a l'Cie by a Cocoon fal'Cie and was taken by PSICOM to discover his Focus.<ref name="QUOTEdajh"/> At Palumpolum, Lightning tries to persuade Hope not to go through with his revenge and meets Snow and Fang. Fang reveals that she and Vanille were l'Cie from Pulse who were turned into crystals; they were turned back into humans 13 days prior to the start of the game, sparking the Purge.<ref name="QUOTEfang"/> Hope attempts to murder Snow, but after Snow saves him from an airstrike, he decides not to go through with it.<ref name="DATALOGnoraover"/> The party then escapes the city with Cid's aid. At Nautilus, Vanille reveals herself to Sazh as a l'Cie from Pulse, and indirectly the reason that Dajh was turned into a l'Cie.<ref name="QUOTEvanille"/> PSICOM then captures Sazh and Vanille and detains them on board the airship ''Palamecia''. 

The other members of the party stage a rescue mission and reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch.  Dysley reveals himself as the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus.<ref name="QUOTEdysley"/> He tells them that their Focus is to transform into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse. Slaying the fal'Cie Orphan will result in the destruction of Cocoon. The party escapes and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves.<ref name="DATALOGorphan"/> Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries prior, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan.<ref name="DATALOGfangragna"/> The party flies away to Pulse and travels to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where they hope to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. They are unsuccessful, and Dysley confronts the group again. He tells them that he is forcing Cid, now the head of the Sanctum, to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]].<ref name="DATALOGcoup"/>

The party infiltrates Cocoon with the goal of preventing its destruction. They head towards Orphan only to find that the Cavalry have been turned into Cie'th. The party encounters Dysley and overpowers him, but Orphan awakens and merges with Dysley, then compels Fang to finish her Focus as Ragnarok while the others are seemingly transformed into Cie'th. The group reappears in human form, preventing Fang from transforming. The party engage and defeat Orphan<ref name="QUOTEfinalbattle"/> and escape Cocoon, which is now falling towards Pulse. As the rest of the party turns to crystal for completing their Focus, Vanille and Fang remain on Cocoon and transform into Ragnarok together. They prevent a collision between Cocoon and Pulse by turning themselves into a crystal pillar between the two worlds. The rest of the party awaken from their crystallization on Pulse and find their l'Cie brands gone. The game ends with Lightning and Snow reuniting with Serah and Sazh reuniting with Dajh.

==Development==
[[File:Motomu Toriyama - Game Developers Conference 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Director & scenario designer [[Motomu Toriyama]] at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]].]]
Development of ''Final Fantasy XIII'' began in April 2004, after the release of ''[[Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission]]'' in Japan.<ref name=ultimania/> The game was developed by [[Square Enix#Production teams|Square Enix Product Development Division 1]].<ref name=ultimania/> At the time, the game was intended to be released on the [[PlayStation 2]].<ref name=ultimania/><ref name="1UP 2006"/> However, after the positive reception of the tech demo of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' in May 2005, the team decided to moved the game to the [[PlayStation 3]] and developed it with the new [[Crystal Tools]] engine, a [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] multiplatform [[game engine]] created by Square Enix for its next generation games.<ref name=ultimania/><ref name="IGNupdate"/><ref name="Development"/> Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project, though it would initially cause a delay in the game's development. However, the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to ''XIII''.<ref name="GDpostmortem"/> ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was first shown at the 2006 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] convention.<ref name="E3 06"/> The [[trailer (film)|trailer]] shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game, since at the time there was no playable form of the game.<ref name="GDpostmortem"/> Announced alongside the game was ''[[Final Fantasy Versus XIII]]'' and the [[PlayStation Portable]] game ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]'', originally titled ''Final Fantasy Agito XIII'', the three of which form the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy]]'' series.<ref name="IGNe306"/> Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked, they are not directly related in terms of story.<ref name="FFXIII showcased"/>

The developers for ''Final Fantasy XIII'' were divided into multiple areas, with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in-game area or modeling characters.<ref name="GDpostmortem"/> Each physical area of the game was developed separately; after an initial design was approved, teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas.<ref name="BUmapint"/> Several of the game's developers had worked on previous installments of the series. Director [[Motomu Toriyama]] had worked on ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2|X-2]]''; producer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] had worked on ''V'' through ''VIII'' and as the producer for ''X'' and ''X-2''; main-character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] had performed the same role for ''VII'', ''VIII'', ''X'', and ''X-2'', and battle-system director [[Toshiro Tsuchida]] reprised that role from ''Final Fantasy X''.<ref name="IGNstaff" /><ref name="GPversus"/> As ''XIII'' was the first ''Final Fantasy'' game for the PlayStation 3, the development team's internal goal was for the game to have the same "gameplay and craftmanship" impact that ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''X'' had as the first games of the series on their respective consoles. They aimed to sell five&nbsp;million copies of the game.<ref name="GDpostmortem"/> Toriyama wanted the game to be "the ultimate single player [[role-playing game#single player|RPG]]"<ref name="Toriyama Interview"/> and for the game's plot to be "a dramatic story focused on the emotions of the characters."<ref name="SUscenint"/>

Tsuchida's concept for the battle system was to maintain the strategic nature of command-based battles. The system stemmed from a desire to create battles similar to those found in the film ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]''.<ref name="EUROGadvent"/> [[Magic point]]s (MP), which had been a part of the battle system in previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles, were removed in the game's battle system as Tsuchida and the other designers felt that it gave players an incentive to not use their most powerful magic attacks due to the MP cost, in turn making battles less interesting. The Paradigm system was designed early in the battle system's development, with the intent of making battles rely on quickly changing strategies and feel fast-moving. Originally there were only five roles, but the Saboteur was later added as the designers felt that its abilities were missing from the game and did not fit with the other roles. Together with the maximum of three characters in a combat situation, the groupings of enemies were designed to force the player to switch Paradigms to keep them engaged in the battles.<ref name="BUBATTLEint"/>

Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a new type of female character with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series.<ref name="1UP 2006"/><ref name="1UP E3 2008"/> His guideline to Nomura was to make her "strong and beautiful", and she was intended to be reminiscent of ''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s [[Cloud Strife]].<ref name="1UP 2006" /><ref name="Famitsu1001"/> Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development.<ref name="IGNfang"/> The game's villains were intended by Kitase to have "their own motivations and beliefs" and act realistically.<ref name="GC 2009 Interview"/> The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features.<ref name="SUCHARint"/> This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games.<ref name="SUARTint"/> Nomura did not take an involved role in the creation of the [[Non-player character#Computer and video games|non-playable characters]].<ref name="SUCHARint"/>

Unlike previous games in the series which were more inspired by Asian locations and culture, ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was intended by the art team to be reminiscent of the United States. Pulse was based on landscape photographs the team took from across the country, and Cocoon was intended to be a "[[melting pot]]" of different ethnicities.<ref name="SUARTint"/> Art director [[Isamu Kamikokuryo]] revealed that many additional scenarios such as Lightning's home, which were functioning in an unreleased build during development, were left out of the final version due to concerns about the game's length and volume.<ref name="content_cut" /> Kamikokuryo said the content they cut was, in itself, enough to make another game.<ref name="content_cut"/> According to Toriyama, the cuts were made in "various stages of [the game's] development", and that some of the content was removed just before the game's completion.<ref name="Toriyama Interview"/> The game, unlike previous titles in the series, includes no explorable town areas; Toriyama said in an interview that the team was unable to make them as graphically appealing as the rest of the game and chose to eliminate them.<ref name="SUint"/> Toriyama intended to have a piece of [[downloadable content]] available for the game that would include a new area, weapons and quests, but was forced to cut it as well due to quality concerns so late in the project and difficulties with the different systems for extra content on the two gaming consoles.<ref name="UOint"/>

A playable demo of ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was included in the Japanese version of ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children#Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete|Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete]]'', released on April 16, 2009.<ref name="PSXEXadvent"/><ref name="IGNdemo"/> Toriyama stated that the release of the demo, which was not in the original development schedule, helped the team recognize a shared vision for what the game should look and feel like, a problem which had been plaguing the development team up until then. It helped the team prioritize the work that still needed to be done, which increased the development speed for the remainder of the project. The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences, and focus groups from both regions were used. The English [[Language localisation|localization]] began while development was still in progress to lessen the delay between the Japanese and worldwide releases.<ref name="GDpostmortem"/> The game was initially going to be released solely for the PlayStation 3, but an Xbox 360 version was announced late in the game's development cycle. The Xbox version, due to technical limitations, runs at a lower resolution (720p maximum) than the PlayStation version.<ref name="EGxbox"/>

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Final Fantasy XIII}}
[[Masashi Hamauzu]] composed the game's soundtrack. His previous work on the series was as a co-composer for ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and as the main composer for ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]''.<ref name="IGNstaff"/> The game was the first main-series ''Final Fantasy'' game to not include any compositions by original series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]; although he was originally announced to compose the main theme of the game, this role was taken over by Hamauzu, after Uematsu signed on to compose the soundtrack to ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]''. The score features some pieces orchestrated by [[Yoshihisa Hirano]], Toshiyuki Oomori, and Kunihito Shiina, with the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref name="SEMOdetails"/><ref name="SEMOinfo"/> The song "My Hands", from British singer [[Leona Lewis]]' second album ''[[Echo (Leona Lewis album)|Echo]]'', was chosen to replace ''Final Fantasy XIII'''s original theme song, "[[Kimi ga Iru Kara]]" by [[Sayuri Sugawara]], for the game's international release.<ref name="WesternRelease"/> Square Enix President [[Yoichi Wada]] later said that it would have been better if the American branch of the company had produced a theme song from scratch, but a lack of staff led to the decision of licensing an existing song.<ref name="DOlicense"/>

Music from the game has been released in several albums. Square Enix released the main soundtrack album, ''Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack'', on four [[Compact Disc]]s in 2010.<ref name="RPGFOST"/> The album sold 16,000 copies the day of its release.<ref name="ORICONcharts"/> Square Enix released selections from the soundtrack on two [[gramophone record]] albums in 2010: ''W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII'' and ''W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII Gentle Reveries''.<ref name="SEVINYL1"/><ref name="SEVINYL2"/> An album of arranged pieces from the soundtrack, ''Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack -PLUS-'', was also released by Square Enix in 2010, as was an album of piano arrangements.<ref name="SEMOOSTP"/><ref name="SEMOOSTPI"/> [[For Life Music]] published a single of the theme song for the Japanese version of the game, "Kimi ga Iru Kara" (<U+541B><U+304C><U+3044><U+308B><U+304B><U+3089>, "Because You're Here"), in 2009.<ref name="RPGFKIR"/>

In March 2010, Square Enix stated that ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was the fastest-selling title in the franchise's history.<ref name="GSpyfast"/> By April of the same year, American game sales for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 reached an estimated 800,000 and 500,000 units respectively.<ref name="IGNsales"/> As of May 18, 2010, ''Final Fantasy XIII'' had shipped 6.2&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref>http://release.square-enix.com/na/2011/09/20_01.html</ref>

''Final Fantasy XIII'' was rated 39 out of 40 by the Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]''.<ref name="FAMITSUreview"/> ''[[Dengeki PlayStation|Dengeki]]'' praised the game for the battle system, stating that the battles are by far the most exciting in the series, and concluded ''Final Fantasy XIII'' deserved a score of 120, as 100 would not be enough.<ref name="Dengeki"/> The game was voted as the second best game of 2009 in Dengeki Online's reader poll,<ref name="DENGEKIreview"/> and in January 2010, it was voted the best game ever in ''Famitsu'''s reader poll.<ref name="FAMITSUpoll"/> The game received a Best RPG of the year award nomination at the [[Spike Video Game Awards]].<ref name="SPIKEnom"/>

Universal praise was given to the technical milestones achieved by the game's graphics and presentation. ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' felt that Cocoon in particular was an "inspired setting [...] blessed with a vibrancy and vivid colour that often leaves you open-mouthed".<ref name="edge_review"/> [[GameSpot]] called the art design "magnificent".<ref name="gspot_review"/> Further praise was given to the [[cutscene|pre-rendered animation sequences]]<ref name="cvg_review" /><ref name="vg_review" /><ref name="wired_review" /> and the almost seamless transition of visual quality between these and the realtime gameplay.<ref name="vg_review" /> Many also appreciated the game's soundtrack,<ref name="cvg_review" /><ref name="gspot_review" /> with Masashi Hamauzu providing "a score with catchy hooks and blood-pumping battle melodies", according to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref name="wired_review" />

The battle system of ''Final Fantasy XIII'' received widespread praise. The increased pace of battles was appreciated, with several reviews describing it as "thrilling";<ref name="eurog_review"/><ref name="cvg_review" /> ''Edge''{{'}}s description of the battle system summarized it as "among the genre's finest".<ref name="edge_review" /> [[1UP.com]] said that "Despite the fact that two-thirds of your party is AI-controlled, FFXIII's battles may be the most involving the series has ever seen."<ref name="1up_review"/> The story got a mixed reception, with ''Wired'' remarking that the plot was "a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games".<ref name="wired_review" /> 1UP.com felt that the story was "hardly world-class writing", but that the writers clearly knew the medium well and had attempted to avoid clich<U+00E9>s.<ref name="1up_review" /> Reviewers felt that the characters worked well together,<ref name="1up_review" /><ref name="gspot_review" /> and that the interactions among them as the game progressed made up for shortcomings in the story.<ref name="eurog_review" />

===Linearity===
While critics generally praised Square Enix's attempt to revitalize the ''Final Fantasy'' series formula, many reacted negatively to the linear nature of the game, especially in the first ten chapters on Cocoon,<ref name="1up_review" /><ref name="joystiq_review"/> an issue which many felt was compounded by the large reduction of towns and interaction with non-player characters.<ref name="gamepro_review" /> ''[[GamePro]]'' described the gameplay as "a long hallway toward an orange target symbol on your mini-map that triggers a cutscene, a boss fight, or both,"<ref name="gamepro_review"/> and 1UP.com criticized the linear aspect as the game's "biggest shortcoming", and felt the first section was "superficial."<ref name="1up_review" /> ''Edge'' and others awarded the game especially lower scores as a result of these aspects, with ''Edge'' in particular lowering the score they awarded the game to a five out of ten primarily due to the game's linear nature.<ref name="edge_review" />

In contrast, reviewers from [[GamesRadar]] and ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' appreciated the  linear nature; the former stated that "the streamlined, focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down",<ref name="gradar_review"/> while the latter felt it was "a clever move",<ref name="cvg_review" /> and kept the player from being "[bogged] down with mundane number crunching, [and] finicky and repetitive leveling-up."<ref name="cvg_review"/> Many negatively noted the gradual unfurling of the player's abilities over this first part of the game, from battle gameplay to selecting the party leader.<ref name="eurog_review" /><ref name="1up_review" /> Due to this aspect, combined with the game's linear nature, some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as "boring" until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed.<ref name="edge_review" /><ref name="wired_review"/><ref name="joystiq_review" /> ''Edge'' noted that while it did not do enough to make up for the opening chapters, at Gran Pulse the game "hits a sweet spot" as the narrative offers "hunting side-quests and the simple joy of exploring to see what visual marvel is around the next corner."<ref name="edge_review" />

===Response to criticism===
After release, director Motomu Toriyama felt that the lower-than-expected review scores for a main ''Final Fantasy'' series game came from reviewers who approached the game from a Western point of view. These reviewers were used to games in which the player was given an [[open world]] to explore, he said, noting that this expectation contrasted with the vision the team set out to create. He noted that it "becomes very difficult to tell a compelling story when you're given that much freedom".<ref name="CVGresponse"/> Toriyama and Kitase later said, in July 2011, that the biggest complaints about the game were that it was too linear and that there was not enough interaction between the player and the world, which they described as a lack of towns and [[Minigames of Final Fantasy|minigames]]. They also named the amount of time it took to access all of the gameplay elements as a common criticism, saying that people interpreted it as a "lengthy tutorial".<ref name="GSKITTORint"/>

Square Enix president [[Yoichi Wada]] made his thoughts about the reception of the game known to [[Gamasutra]]. He said, "Some value it highly, while others really don't like it."<ref name="GSUTRAresponse"/> He added, "Should Final Fantasy become a new type of game or should Final Fantasy not become a new type of game? The customers have different opinions. It's very difficult to determine which way it should go."<ref name="GSUTRAresponse"/>

==Sequel==
{{main|Final Fantasy XIII-2}}
At the Square Enix First Production Department Conference held on January 18, 2011, Square Enix announced that they were developing a direct sequel to ''Final Fantasy XIII'', entitled ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]'', which intends to build on the game's story and characters while taking on board the criticism and other feedback about the original. It has an expected release date of December 15, 2011 in Japan, January 31, 2012 in North America and February 3, 2012 in Europe, for both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.<ref>http://gamerant.com/final-fantasy-13-2-release-date-tao-105659/</ref><ref>http://gematsu.com/2011/09/final-fantasy-xiii-2-dated-special-edition-ps3-announced</ref> Motomu Toriyama and Yoshinori Kitase will reprise their respective roles as director and producer. The game takes place immediately after the events of ''Final Fantasy XIII''. ''Final Fantasy XIII-2'' is set to star Lightning once again, and will feature a modified version of the Active Time Battle system from the original game.<ref name="GSFF13-2"/> Toriyama stated in the ''[[List of Square Enix companion books|Ultimania Omega]]'' companion book prior to the sequel's announcement that he hoped to write a story "where Lightning ends up happy", though at the time Square Enix had no plans to make a sequel.<ref name="UOint"/>
