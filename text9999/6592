In 1989 Reiss was hired along with Jean as the first members of the original writing staff of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and worked on the thirteen episodes of the show's first season (1989).<ref name="TDB"/> They became [[show runner]]s of ''The Simpsons'' at the start of the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]] (1991).<ref name="UGO">{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/aljean/|title=Al Jean interview|last=Epstein|first=Daniel Robert|publisher=[[UGO]]|accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> A show runner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting, and the music.<ref name="TDB"/> The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was "[[Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington]]" (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier.<ref name="JeanWashington">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Jean said "one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough."<ref name="JeanWashington"/> Reiss added that "we were definitely scared.

Jean believes this is one of the reasons that many fans regard season three and four as the best seasons of ''The Simpsons''.<ref name="UGO"/> [[Sam Simon]] has stated "''The Simpsons'' wouldn't have been ''The Simpsons'' without [Reiss]."<ref name=bristol/> Reiss has won four [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for his work on the show.<ref name=speaker>http://www.greatertalent.com/MikeReiss</ref>

They left after season four to create ''[[The Critic]]'', an animated show about film critic [[Jay Sherman]] (voiced by [[Jon Lovitz]]); the show was executive produced by [[James L. Brooks]].<ref name="feare">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Cape Feare"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301117,00.html|title=Gotta Lovitz |author=Svetkey, Benjamin | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=1994-02-11| accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> It was first broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in January 1994 and was well-received by critics,<ref>{{cite news| title=The Critic is worthy follow-up to The Simpsons Animated series gets two thumbs-up|author=Boedecker, Hal| work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]| date=1994-01-26| accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EED91331F930A25752C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|title=Reporter's Notebook; Top Hollywood Agency Reaches for the Stars Of Television News |author=Carter, Bill| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=1994-01-13| accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks.

The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. 'The Critic' is their shot and he should be giving them his support." Reiss stated that he was a "little upset" by Groening's actions and that "this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch ''The Critic''{{'}} all over it."<ref name="LATimes"/> Jean added "What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may get the impression that this ''Simpsons'' episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if 'The Critic' never existed."<ref name="LATimes"/> On Fox, ''The Critic'' was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten internet broadcast [[webisode]]s. The series has since developed a [[cult following]] thanks to reruns on [[Comedy Central]] and its complete series release on DVD.<ref name="Slant">{{cite news|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/dvd_review.asp?ID=296|title=The Critic: The Complete Series |author=Uhlich, Keith| publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]| date=2004-02-03| accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref>

In 1994, they signed a three-year deal with [[Disney]] to produce other TV shows for ABC and the duo created and executive produced ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]'', which was canceled in its first season. Reiss said "It was so compromised and overworked. I had 11 executives full-time telling me how to do my job."<ref name=bristol/>

The pair periodically returned to work on ''The Simpsons'', for example, while under contract at Disney they were allowed to produce four episodes of the show, including [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]]'s "[[Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious]]".<ref name="calif">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> When Jean returned to ''The Simpsons'' permanently for season 13, Reiss worked part-time on it<ref name="TDB"/> and is currently credited as a "producer" on the show.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0718514/</ref> He flies to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] one day a week to attend story meetings.<ref name=bristol/> He also co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonsmovie.com/main.html|title=About the DVD|work=The Simpsons Movie.com|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|accessdate=2007-11-29}} On the main page, click on "About the DVD" then on "Production Notes".</ref>

===Solo work===
Along with director [[Xeth Feinberg]], in 2000 Reiss independently produced ''[[Hard Drinkin' Lincoln]]'', a series of 16 [[flash animation]] cartoons for [[Icebox.com]].<ref>[http://www.icebox.com/index.php?id=show&showid=s3 Hard Drinkin' Lincoln]</ref> 

Later, Reiss collaborated with Feinberg again to independently produce a short internet cartoon series entitled ''[[Queer Duck]]'' for Icebox.com. In 2002, the series was picked up by [[Showtime]], where it aired as a supporting feature to ''[[Queer as Folk (U.S.)|Queer as Folk]]''. ''Queer Duck: the Movie'' was released on DVD in 2006.<ref name=speaker/> It was named the 94th greatest cartton of all-time by a [[Channel 4]] poll.<ref>http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/cartoons/results.html</ref>

He has also written a number of screenplays including ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]'',<ref name=bristol/> ''[[Robots (film)|Robots]]''. The first live-action film he wrote was 2009's ''[[My Life in Ruins]]'', starring [[Nia Vardalos]]. Reiss initially wrote the film as a short story but after being rejected by 37 publishers rewrote it as a screenplay and sent it to Vardalos who "snatched it right up". The film garnered a negative critical response with [[Roger Ebert]], for example, stating "there is, in short, nothing I liked about ''My Life in Ruins,'' except some of the ruins" and calling Reiss' script "lousy".<ref>http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090603/REVIEWS/906039991</ref> Reiss defended the film: "''My Life in Ruins'' really makes people happy. It's a relentlessly sweet movie about the basic decency of humanity. It's happy ending kicks in around the 30-minute mark and continues for the next hour. I know those [critics at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]]] were sitting there in that audience. They were sitting there going, 'These 1,498 people were wrong and the two of us are correct.' It makes me a little nuts."<ref name=bristol/>  

He has published ten children's books, including ''How Murray Saved Christmas,'' published by Penguin.<ref name=speaker/> He also won an [[Edgar Award]] for his mystery story "[[Cro-Magnon]] [[private investigator|PI]]".<ref>http://www.mysterywriters.org/?q=Edgars-PastWinners</ref>
