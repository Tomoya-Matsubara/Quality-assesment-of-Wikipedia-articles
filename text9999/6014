The '''Sukhoi Su-33''' ([[NATO reporting name]]: '''Flanker-D''') is an all-weather [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-based]] air defence fighter designed by [[Sukhoi]] and manufactured by [[KnAAPO]]. It is a derivative of the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27 'Flanker']] and was initially known as the '''Su-27K'''. The Su-33 entered service in 1995, aboard the aircraft carrier [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']].{{#tag:ref|Officially, ''Admiral Kuznetsov'' is referred to as a "heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser" as a way around an international treaty prohibiting aircraft carriers to sail through the straits of [[Bosporus]] and [[Dardanelles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|pp=70<U+2013>71}}</ref>|group="N"}} The aircraft officially entered service in August 1998, by which time the designation "Su-33" was used. With the downsizing of the Russian Navy following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the USSR]], only 24 examples were produced. There were negotiations with both the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[India]] regarding purchase, but these did not lead to sales. 

Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened [[undercarriage]] and structure, folding wings and [[stabilator]]s for carrier operations. The wings are enlarged over land-based variants for increased lift. The Su-33 has upgraded engines, twin nose-wheel and is [[Aerial refueling|air refuelable]]. In terms of range and payload, the aircraft is superior to its rival Mikoyan counterpart, the [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]], however the MiG-29 is a [[multirole]] platform with more advanced avionics, making it capable of a wider range of missions. In 2009, the Russian Navy ordered the MiG-29K as a replacement for the Su-33.

== Development ==
=== Background and origins ===
The [[Yakovlev Yak-38]], the Soviet's only operational [[VTOL]] fighter, was unable to undertake its role during the early 1970s. This severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy's [[Kiev class aircraft carrier|Project 1143]] carriers, the ''[[Soviet aircraft carrier Kiev|Kiev]]'', ''[[Soviet aircraft carrier Minsk|Minsk]]'', ''[[Soviet aircraft carrier Novorossiysk|Novorossiysk]]'' and ''[[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov|Baku]]''. It was decided to develop a bigger  and more potent carrier capable of admitting STOL aircraft. During the following period of assessment, a number of carriers were studied <U+2013> the Project 1160 carrier would be able to admit the [[MiG-23]]s and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-24]]s, but was abandoned. Instead effort was concentrated on the Project 1153 carrier, which could accommodate the [[Su-25]]s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier. This particular carrier would be modified to allow for [[Yakovlev Yak-141|Yak-141]], [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] and Su-27K operations.<ref name="Williams p. 126">{{harvnb|Williams|2002|p=126.}}</ref><ref name="Su-33 history">{{Cite web|title=Sukhoi Su-33: Historical background|work=Sukhoi|url=http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/history/|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref>
<!--http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2008/07/22/Outside_View_Russias_carrier_weakness/UPI-46861216749820/-->

To prepare for the operations of the Su-27K, along with the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, namely the development of the [[steam catapult]], [[arresting gear]], optical and radio landing systems, as well as the training of pilots, an establishment was set up in [[Crimea]]. It was named NITKA, for Aviation Research and Training Complex.<ref name="Williams p. 126"/><ref name="Su-33 history"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Flanker poised for navy go-ahead|work=[[Flight International]], ''13<U+2013>19 July 1994''|date=|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1994/1994%20-%201642.html|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> However, in 1981, the Soviet government ordered the abandonment of the catapult system as part of an overall downsize of Project 1143.5 carriers. A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to assure that the MiG29Ks and Su-27Ks would be able to operate from carriers.<ref name="Eden, p. 462">{{harvnb|Eden|2004|p=462.}}</ref> Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their baseline prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (<U+2013>3, <U+2013>24 and <U+2013>25), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests occurred on 28&nbsp;August&nbsp;1982 by Nikolai Sadovnikov. Flight tests indicated a need for a change in ramp profile, resulting in modifications to a [[ski-jump]].<ref name="Eden, p. 462"/> 

Conceptual designs of the Su-27K started in 1978.<ref name="Williams p. 126"/> On 18&nbsp;April&nbsp;1984, the Soviet government instructed Sukhoi to develop an air defence fighter; Mikoyan was ordered to build a lighter multi-role fighter.<ref name="Williams p. 127">{{harvnb|Williams|2002|p=127.}}</ref> Full-scale design of the Su-27K soon started as the "T-10K" under the guidance of Konstantin Marbyshev. Nikolai Sadovnikov was appointed the [[OKB|design bureau]]'s Chief Test Pilot for the programme. By November&nbsp;1984, conceptual design had passed critical design review, with the detailed design finalised in 1986. The two prototypes were constructed in conjunction with KnAAPO in 1986<U+2013>1987.<ref name="Su-33 history"/>

=== Testing ===

The jet blast deflector is erected behind the aircraft. Three men in bright orange fluorescent tops stand underneath the jet's right wing ]]
The first Su-27K prototype, piloted by [[Viktor Pugachyov]], made its [[maiden flight]] on 17&nbsp;August&nbsp;1987 at the NITKA facility; the second followed on 22&nbsp;December.<ref name="Su-33 history"/> Flight tests continued at NITKA, where MiG-29Ks and Su-27Ks demonstrated and validated the feasibility of ski-jump operations. The pilots also practised no-flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck. It was another two years, on 21&nbsp;October&nbsp;1989, that the ''Tbilisi'', subsequently renamed ''Admiral Kuznetsov'', left the shipyard.<ref name="Williams p. 129">{{harvnb|Williams|2002|p=129.}}</ref><ref name="Su-33 history"/>

Viktor Pugachyov, piloting the second Su-27K (the first prototype had crashed), became the first Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989.<ref name="Williams p. 129"/><ref>{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=80.}}</ref> It was found that the carrier's [[jet blast deflector]]s were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60<U+00B0>; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45<U+00B0>. However, when the aircraft was front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a [[Kamov Ka-27|Kamov Ka-27PS]] [[search-and-rescue]] helicopter was flown close to the carrier in the event of an accident.<ref name="gordon">{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=66.}}</ref> 

During the following three-week period, 227 sorties were amassed, along with 35 deck landings.<ref name="Williams p. 129"/> Flight testing continued afterwards, and on 26&nbsp;September&nbsp;1991, naval pilots began testing the Su-27K; by 1994, it had successfully passed the State Acceptance Trials.<ref name="Eden, p. 462"/> During 1990<U+2013>1991, seven production aircraft were rolled out.<ref name="Williams p. 129"/>

=== Further developments ===
Two known versions of the Su-33 were developed. In April&nbsp;1999, Sukhoi test flew a twin-seat version, the Su-33KUB. The aircraft, piloted by Viktor Pugachyov and Sergey Melnikov, flew for 40 minutes near [[Ramenskoye Airport]]. The Su-33KUB (''Korabelny Uchebno-Boevo''", or "carrier combat trainer") was planned to be a trainer, but with the potential to fill other roles.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Velovich|first=Alexander|title=Twin-seat naval Flanker flies|work=[[Flight International]], ''2 June 1999''|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/1999/06/02/51784/twin-seat-naval-flanker-flies.html|date=|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> The variant has a revised forward fuselage and leading edge slats, bigger wings and [[stabilator]]s, and a host of other improvements.<ref name="Williams p. 131">{{harvnb|Williams|2002|p=131.}}</ref>

In 2010, Sukhoi developed a modernised version of the Su-33; flight trials began in October&nbsp;2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=van Leeuwen| first=Marcel |url=http://www.aviationnews.eu/2010/10/07/sukhoi-begins-flight-trials-of-modernized-su-33-fighters/|accessdate=2 July 2011|title=Sukhoi begins flight trials of modernized Su-33 fighters| work=Aviationnews.eu, ''7 October 2010''| date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rusnavy.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=10430|title=Sukhoi tests upgraded Su-33|work=Rusnavy.com, ''10 May 2010''|date=|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20101005/160836124.html |title=Russia's Sukhoi begins Su-33 Flanker-D trials|date=| work=rian.ru, ''10 May 2010''|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> This modernised Su-33 was to compete with a potential Chinese copy of the original Su-33, and to encourage orders from the Russian Navy.<ref>Fisher 2008, pp. 190-191.</ref> Major upgrades to the aircraft included more powerful (13,500&nbsp;kg) AL-31-F-M1 engines and a larger weapons undercarriage; upgrades to the radar and weapons were not possible at the time due to funding constraints.<ref name = 'fish 191'>Fisher 2008, p. 191.</ref> It has been speculated that further upgrades to a new production batch would include a phased-array radar, thrust-vectoring nozzels, and long-range anti-ship missiles.<ref name = 'fish 191'/>

== Design ==
To adapt the original Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi incorporated substantial changes to the basic [[airframe]]. The aircraft's structure and undercarriage was strengthened to withstand the great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings.<ref name="Williams p. 128"/> The [[leading edge slat]]s, [[flaperon]]s and other control surfaces were enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the span remained unchanged.<ref name="Aus Avia"/> The wings features double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping [[aileron]]s; in total, the refinements enlarged the wing area by 10<U+2013>12%.<ref name="Williams p. 128">{{harvnb|Williams|2002|p=128.}}</ref> The wings were modified for folding as to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate; the stabilators are also foldable to allow the Su-33 to use ''Admiral Kuznetsov''{{'}}s edge-deck lift.<ref name="Williams p. 128"/> The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful [[Turbofan|turbofan engines]] to increase [[thrust-to-weight ratio]], as well as an [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refuelling]] probe.<ref name="Williams p. 128"/> The Su-33 sports [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]]s that shorten the take-off distance and improved manoeuvrability, but required reshaping of the [[Leading edge extension#Leading edge root extensions|leading edge root extensions]] (LERX).<ref name="Aus Avia">{{Cite web|last= Kopp|first=Carlo|title=Sukhoi Fullback|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/TE-Fullback-P.pdf|work=Australian Aviation, ''November 2004''|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref> The rear radome was shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking deck during high-Alpha ([[angle of attack]]) landings.<ref name="Eden p. 463">{{harvnb|Eden|2004|p=463.}}</ref>

Compared with the rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's [[maximum takeoff weight]] (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel capacity is more than double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can spend as much time as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordinance capacity.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2002|pp=126, 128.}}</ref> The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as 240&nbsp;km/h (149&nbsp;mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250&nbsp;km/h (155&nbsp;mph) for effective control.<ref name="Williams p. 128"/> However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33.<ref name="Williams p. 128"/> The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.<ref name="Williams p. 126"/>{{#tag:ref|Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Yefim Gordon characterised the rejection of the MiG-29K for the Su-33 as "astonishing", noting that the Su-33 was more expensive and incapable of launching missiles against surface targets.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|Gordon|1998|p=254.}}</ref> However, some analysts have stated the view that the MiG-29K was only a fall-back option if the Su-33 had proven to be too heavy for carrier opeations; and that the Soviet Navy were only interested in fleet air defence, not strike or attack capabilities.<ref name = 'bang 281'>{{harvnb|Bangash|2008|p=281}}</ref>|group=N}}

The Su-33 carries guided missiles such as the [[R-73 (missile)|R-73]] (four) and [[R-27 (air-to-air missile)|R-27E]] (six), supplemented by the 150-round 30&nbsp;mm [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-301|GSh-30-1]].<ref name="Williams p. 128"/> It has 12 [[hardpoint]]s.<ref name="Su-33 arms">{{Cite web|title=Sukhoi Su-33: Armaments|work=Sukhoi|url=http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/arms/|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> It can carry an assortment of unguided missiles, bombs and [[cluster bomb]]s for secondary air-to-ground missions.<ref name="Williams p. 128"/><ref name="Su-33 arms"/> The aircraft can be used in both night and day operations at sea. The radar used, "Slot Back", has been speculated to have poor multi-target tracking, making the Su-33 reliant on other radar platforms and [[airborne warning and control system]] (AWACS) aircraft like the [[Kamov Ka-31]] early-warning helicopter.<ref name="Eden p. 463"/> The R-27EM missiles has the capability to intercept [[anti-ship missile]]s. The [[infra-red search and track]] (IRST) system was placed to provide better downward visibility.<ref name="Aus Avia"/>

== Operational history ==
=== Soviet Union and Russia ===
The Su-27K entered service in the mid-1990s. From December&nbsp;1995 to March 1996, the ''Admiral Kuznetsov'' set sail in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], carrying two [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25UTGs]], nine [[Kamov Ka-27|Ka-27s]], and thirteen Su-27Ks.<ref name="William p. 130">{{harvnb|Williams|2002|p=130.}}</ref><ref name="Su-33 history"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Russian carrier deploys to Adriatic|work=[[Flight International]], ''22<U+2013>28 November 1995''|date=|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%203361.html|accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref> However, the aircraft officially entered service 31&nbsp;August&nbsp;1998 with the 279th Naval Fighter Regiment of the [[Northern Fleet]] based at [[Severomorsk-3]], by which time it was officially designated the "Su-33".<ref name="William p. 130"/> The Russian Navy currently operates 19 Su-33s, however in the long term these need to be replaced.<ref name="New fighters">{{Cite web|url=http://www.barentsobserver.com/new-fighter-jets-for-admiral-kuznetsov.4636606-58932.html|title= New fighter jets for Admiral Kuznetsov|work=Barentsobserver.com, ''25 September 2009''|date=| accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref>

With the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Russian Navy was dramatically downsized, with many shipbuilding programmes stopped. Had the ''[[Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag|Varyag]]'', [[Project 1153 OREL|''Oryol'']] and [[Soviet aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk|''Ulyanovsk'']] been commissioned, a total of 72 production airframes would have been built; the early-airborne warning and MiG-29K would also have proceed, instead of being abandoned.<ref name="Eden, p. 462"/> Only 24 examples were built at the time ''Varyag'' was sold for scrap.<ref name="Williams p. 129"/> In 2009, the Russian Navy announced an order for 24 MiG-29Ks to replace the Su-33, to be delivered from 2011 to 2015.<ref name="New fighters"/><ref name="Russian M-29 purchase">{{Cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091009/156412003.html|title= Russian Navy to buy 24 MiG-29K carrier-based fighters|work=Rian.ru, ''9 October 2009''|date= | accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref>

=== Potential operators ===
Internationally, the [[People<U+2019>s Republic of China]] was identified as a possible export customer.

The plane was destroyed with depth charges to prevent the recovery of classified equipment.<ref>{{Cite news|title=World's best naval flanker Su-33 crashed in Northern Atlantic|publisher=''Pravda.ru'', 6 September 2005|url=http://english.pravda.ru/hotspots/disasters/06-09-2005/8878-sucrash-0/|accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>
