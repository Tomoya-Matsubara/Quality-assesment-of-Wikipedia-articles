In mammals, melatonin is biosynthesized in four enzymatic steps from the essential dietary amino acid [[tryptophan]], with [[serotonin]] produced at the third step. Melatonin is secreted into the blood by the [[pineal gland]] in the brain.  Known as the "hormone of darkness," it is secreted in darkness in both day-active ([[Diurnality|diurnal]]) and night-active ([[Nocturnality|nocturnal]]) animals.<ref name="Challet2007" /> It may also be produced by a variety of peripheral cells such as [[Bone marrow|bone marrow cells]],<ref name="Pp">{{cite journal | author = Maestroni GJ | title = The immunotherapeutic potential of melatonin | journal = Expert Opin Investig Drugs | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 467<U+2013>76 |date=March 2001 | pmid = 11227046 | doi = 10.1517/13543784.10.3.467 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Conti A, Conconi S, Hertens E, Skwarlo-Sonta K, Markowska M, Maestroni JM | title = Evidence for melatonin synthesis in mouse and human bone marrow cells | journal = J.

Melatonin, produced in the pineal gland which is outside of the [[blood<U+2013>brain barrier]], acts as an [[endocrine]] hormone since it is released into the blood.<ref name="pmid19075654">{{cite journal | author = Kaur C, Ling EA | title = Antioxidants and neuroprotection in the adult and developing central nervous system | journal = Curr.

Melatonin can suppress [[libido]] by inhibiting secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) from the [[anterior pituitary]] gland, especially in mammals that have a [[Reproduction|breeding]] season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of [[Polyestrous|long-day breeders]] is [[Estrous cycle#Anestrus|repressed by melatonin]] and the reproduction of [[Polyestrous|short-day breeders]] is stimulated by melatonin.  During the night, melatonin regulates [[leptin]], lowering its levels.

Light/dark information reaches the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus|suprachiasmatic nuclei]] (SCN) from retinal [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s, which are intrinsically photosensitive [[photoreceptor cell]]s that are distinct from those involved in the primary (at least, from one point of view) image formation function of the eye (that is the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] of the retina). These cells represent approximately 2% of all retinal ganglion cells in humans and express the photopigment melanopsin.<ref name="pmid17160354">{{cite journal | author = Nayak SK, Jegla T, Panda S | title = Role of a novel photopigment, melanopsin, in behavioral adaptation to light | journal = Cell.

[[Melanopsin]], often confused with melatonin because of its similar name, is structurally unrelated to the hormone.

Melatonin was used to treat [[periodic limb movement disorder]], a common neurological condition, which, when severe, adversely affects sleep and causes excessive daytime fatigue, in a small trial conducted by Kunz D and Bes F.  In this condition, the sufferer is affected by mini arousals during sleep and limb movements that occur in a frequent rhythmic fashion.  This often involves leg kicking, but sometimes also involves arm movement.

==Adverse effects==
Melatonin appears to cause very few [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] in the short term, up to three months, when healthy people take it at low doses. A systematic review<ref name="Buscemi2006" /> in 2006 looked specifically at efficacy and safety in two categories of melatonin usage: first, for sleep disturbances that are secondary to other diagnoses and, second, for sleep disorders such as [[jet lag]] and [[shift work]] that accompany sleep restriction.<ref name="Buscemi2006" />

The study concluded that "There is no evidence that melatonin is effective in treating secondary sleep disorders or sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction, such as jet lag and shiftwork disorder. There is evidence that melatonin is safe with short term use".<ref name="Buscemi2006" />

A similar analysis<ref name="pmid16423108" /> by the same team a year earlier on the efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin in the management of ''primary'' sleep disorders found that: "There is evidence to suggest that melatonin is safe with short-term use (3 months or less)."

==Availability==
[[File:Melatonin prescription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Helsinki university]] pharmaceutical laboratory prepared melatonin available upon prescription.]]
Legal availability of melatonin varies in different countries, ranging from being available without prescription (e.g. in most of [[North America]] and Finland) to being available only on prescription (e.g. in the UK) or not at all (although its possession and use may not be illegal). It is widely available on the Internet.

The hormone may be administered orally, as capsules, tablets or liquid, sublingually, or as transdermal patches.

The use of melatonin derived from animal pineal tissue may carry the risk of contamination or the means of transmitting viral material. The synthetic form of this medication does not carry this risk.<ref name="Altun2007"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/melatonin.html |title=Melatonin| publisher=[[Drugs.com]]| accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref>

===Dietary supplement===

In the US it is sold as a dietary supplement (sometimes combined with other ingredients, such as vitamins and herbal extracts) and not as a drug.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations applying to medications are not applicable to melatonin.<ref name="Altun2007"/> However, new FDA rules required that by June 2010 all production of dietary supplements must comply with "current [[good manufacturing practice]]s" (cGMP) and be manufactured with "controls that result in a consistent product free of contamination, with accurate labeling."<ref>{{cite press release | title = FDA Issues Dietary Supplements Final Rule | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date = 2007-06-22 | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm108938.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-04}}</ref> The industry has also been required to report to the FDA "all serious dietary supplement related adverse events", and the FDA has (within the cGMP guidelines) begun enforcement of that requirement.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/75250.php | title = FDA Tightens Up Dietary Supplement Manufacturing And Labelling | website= Medical News Today | accessdate = 2 September 2013 | date = 26 June 2007}}</ref>

The FDA is considering whether these food products can continue to be sold with the label "dietary supplements". On January 13, 2010, they issued a warning letter to Innovative Beverage, creators of several beverages marketed as "relaxation drinks," stating that melatonin is not approved as a [[food additive]] because it is not [[generally recognized as safe]].<ref name="FDAwarning">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm201435.htm | title =Warning Letter | author = Rodriguez RR | date = January 13, 2010 | work = Inspections, Compliance, Enforcement, and Criminal Investigations | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}</ref>

===Prolonged release===

[[File:Circadin 2mg.jpg|thumb|Circadin 2mg, prolonged-release melatonin]]
Melatonin is available as a prolonged-release prescription drug, trade-name Circadin, manufactured by Neurim Pharmaceuticals. The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) has approved Circadin 2&nbsp;mg (prolonged-release melatonin) for patients aged 55 or over, as monotherapy for the short-term treatment (up to 13 weeks) of primary insomnia characterized by poor quality of sleep.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/69195.php Medical News Today] Circadin (Prolonged-Release Melatonin) For Primary Insomnia Recommended For Approval In The EU (27 Apr 2007)</ref>
