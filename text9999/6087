'''Cornell University''' is a [[private university|private]] [[university]] located in [[Ithaca, New York]], [[USA]]. Its two medical campuses are in [[New York City]] and in [[Education City, Qatar|Education City]], [[Qatar]].

The youngest member of the [[Ivy League]], Cornell was founded in [[1865]] by [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] as a [[coeducation]]al, non-[[sectarianism|sectarian]] institution where admission was offered irrespective of religion or race. Inaugurated shortly after the [[American Civil War]], its founders intended that the new university would teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge &mdash; from the [[classics]] to the [[science]]s and from the theoretical to the applied.  These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, an 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study."<ref name="motto" />

The university is organized into seven [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] colleges and seven [[graduate school|graduate]] divisions, each defining its own academic programs in near autonomy. Since the mid-20th century, the university has been expanding both its campus resources and influence worldwide. From a new [[residential college]] housing system to its 2001 founding of a medical college in [[Qatar]], Cornell claims "to serve society by educating the leaders of tomorrow and extending the frontiers of knowledge."<ref name='transnational'>{{cite web | url = http://www.cornell.edu/about/mission/ | title = The Cornell University Mission | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-01-01}}</ref> 
Cornell counts more than 240,000 living [[Alumnus|alumni]], 28 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]] and 40 [[Nobel laureate]]s affiliated with the university as faculty or students.<ref name="factbook" /><ref name="nobel">{{cite web | url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/campus/Nobel_Laureates_at_CUk1.shtml | title = Cornell Nobel laureates | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-06-06}}</ref><ref name = "Rhodes Scholars">{{cite web | url = http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1165899600 | title = Uncle Ezra | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2007-01-10}}</ref>

Research is a central element of the university's mission; Cornell spent [[United States dollar|$]]605 million on research and development in a diverse group of fields during the July 2005 to June 2006 fiscal year.<ref name="research">{{cite web | url = http://www.research.cornell.edu/vpr/ResExp/ResExp2006.pdf | title = Research Expenditures | format = PDF | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Cornell University}}
[[Image:Cornell Arts Quad 1919.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The [[Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences#The Arts Quadrangle|Arts Quad]], around which the [[Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] centers]]
Cornell University was created on [[April 27]] [[1865]] by a [[New York State Senate]] bill that named the university as the state's [[land-grant university|land grant]] institution. Senator Ezra Cornell offered his farm in [[Ithaca, New York]], as a site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial [[financial endowment|endowment]]. Fellow senator and experienced educator [[Andrew Dickson White]] agreed to be the first president. During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the initial two buildings and traveled about the globe, attracting students and [[faculty (university)|faculty]].<ref name='founding'>{{cite book | last = Becker | first = Carl L. | authorlink = Carl L.

The university was inaugurated on [[October 7]], [[1868]], and 412 men were enrolled the next day.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cornell.edu/search/index.cfm?tab=facts&q=&id=37 | title = Archives, Cornell University | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-04-06}}</ref> Two years later, Cornell admitted its first women students, making it the first [[coeducation]]al school among what came to be known as the [[Ivy League]]. Scientists [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[James Crafts]] were among the faculty members.<ref name='founding' />

[[Image:Skorton Speech.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In September 2006, [[David Skorton]] formally became Cornell's 12th and current president]]

Cornell expanded significantly in the 20th century, with its student population growing to its current count of about 20,000 students. The faculty expanded as well; by the century's end, the university had more than 3,400 faculty members. Along with its population growth, Cornell increased its breadth of course offerings. Today, the university has wide-ranging programs and offers more than 4,000 courses.

In the 2000s, Cornell has been expanding its [[#International programs|international programs]]. In 2001, the university founded the [[Cornell University#Qatar campus|Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar]], the first American [[medical school]] outside of the United States.<ref name='aboutqatar'>{{cite web | url = http://www.qatar-med.cornell.edu/aboutUs/index.html | title = Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar - About Us | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-18}}</ref> It continues to forge partnerships with major institutions in [[India]], [[Singapore]], and the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/RawlingsIndia.bpf.html | title = Cornell president joins Indian prime minister to open new chapter in science education | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/04/11.11.04/HotelSchool-Nanyang.html | title = Hotel School, Singapore university establish joint master's program | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov05/Rawlings_China_main.html | title = Rawlings heads to China to sign partnership agreement and deliver keynote address at economic summit in Beijing | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-01-01}}</ref> The university has gone as far as to claim to be "the first [[transnational]] university".<ref name='transnational' />

==Organization==
[[Image:Andrew Dickson White statue and Goldwin Smith Hall.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Goldwin Smith Hall and the [[A.D. White]] statue]]  
Cornell is a private institution, receiving most of its funding through [[tuition]], research [[grant (money)|grants]], and [[alumni]] contributions. Three of its undergraduate schools/colleges and the graduate-level [[Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine|College of Veterinary Medicine]] are called [[contract college]]s. These contract colleges receive significant partial, ongoing funding from the state of New York to support their teaching, research, and service missions. Residents of New York enrolled in the contract colleges pay reduced tuition. Furthermore, the New York State [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]], the [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly]], and the President [[Pro Tem]] of the [[New York State Senate]] all serve as [[ex-officio]] members of Cornell's Board of [[Trustee]]s. Despite some similarities, Cornell's contract colleges are not [[public university|public]] or state schools &mdash; they are [[private university|private]] institutions that Cornell operates by contract with the [[state government]].

Cornell is [[decentralized]], with its colleges and schools exercising wide autonomy. Each defines its own academic programs, operates its own [[college admissions|admissions]] and advising programs, and confers its own [[academic degree|degrees]]. The only university-wide requirements for a [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degree are to pass a [[swimming]] test, take two [[physical education]] courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. Although students are affiliated with their individual college or school, they may take courses in any of the colleges, provided they have fulfilled the course prerequisites. A handful of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one college.

Seven schools provide undergraduate programs and an additional seven provide graduate and professional programs. Students pursuing graduate degrees in departments of these schools are enrolled in the [[Cornell University Graduate School|Graduate School]]. The School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions offers programs for college and high school students, professionals, and other adults.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sce.cornell.edu | title = School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-02}}</ref>

==Campuses==
===Main campus===
[[Image:CentralAvenueCornell2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|McGraw Hall and the clock tower]]
Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in [[Ithaca, New York]], overlooking the town and [[Cayuga Lake]].  When the university was founded in 1865, the campus consisted of 209.5&nbsp;acres (0.85&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of Ezra Cornell's roughly 300-acre (1.2&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) farm. Since then, it has swelled to about 745&nbsp;acres (3.0&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), encompassing both the hill and much of the surrounding areas.<ref name="ithaca">{{cite web | url = http://www.cornell.edu/visiting/ithaca | title = Cornell University - The Ithaca Campus | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-04-06}}</ref>

Some 260 university buildings are divided primarily between Central and [[Cornell North Campus|North Campuses]] on the [[plateau]] of the Hill, [[Cornell West Campus|West Campus]] on its slope, and Collegetown immediately south of Central Campus.<ref name="ithaca" /> Central Campus has laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost all of the university's academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums.  The only residential facility on Central Campus is the [[Cornell Law School|Law School]]'s [[residential college]], Hughes Hall.  North Campus contains [[freshman]] and [[graduate student]] housing, themed program houses, and 29 [[fraternity and sorority]] houses. West Campus has upperclass residential colleges and an additional 25 fraternity and sorority houses.<ref name='map'>{{cite web | url = http://www.cornell.edu/maps/large.cfm | title = Cornell University Map | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}</ref> Collegetown contains the Schwartz [[performing arts|Performing Arts]] Center and two upperclass [[residence halls]], amid a neighborhood of apartments, restaurants, and businesses.

[[Image:Houston Pond of F. R. Newman Arboretrum.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[F.R. Newman Arboretum]]]]
The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic [[architectural style]]s, including ornate [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] buildings, and less decorative  [[International style (architecture)|international]] and [[Modern architecture|modernist]] structures.  The more ornate buildings generally predate [[World War II]]. Because the student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, grandiosity was neglected in favor of less expensive and more rapidly constructed styles.<ref>{{cite book | first=Daniel | last=Margulis | coauthors=Schroeder, John | title=A Century at Cornell | publisher=[[Cornell Daily Sun]] | location=[[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca, N.Y.]] | year=1980 | id=ISBN 0-938304-00-3 | pages=110-111}}</ref> While some buildings are neatly arranged into [[quadrangle]]s, others are packed densely and haphazardly. These eccentricities arose from the university's numerous, ever-changing master plans for the campus. For example, in one of the earliest plans, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the designer of [[Central Park]], outlined a "grand terrace" overlooking [[Cayuga Lake]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Kermit C. | last=Parsons | title=The Cornell Campus: A History of its Planning and Development | publisher=[[Cornell University#Press|Cornell University Press]] | location=[[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca, N.Y.]] | year=1968 | chapter=Chp. 3: A Quadrangle of Stone}}</ref>  Because the terrace plan was dropped, McGraw Hall appears to face the wrong direction, facing the Slope rather than the Arts Quad.

The Ithaca Campus is among the rolling valleys of the [[Finger Lakes]] region and, atop the Hill, commands a panoramic view of the surrounding area. Two [[Canyon|gorges]] bound Central Campus, which become popular swimming holes during the warmer months. Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,900-acre (11.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) [[Cornell Plantations]], a [[botanical garden]] containing flowers, trees, and ponds along manicured trails.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://explore.cornell.edu/scene.cfm?scene=Natural%20Beauty&stop=CU%20%2D%20NB%20%2D%20Campus%20Gardens | title = Explore Cornell - Natural Beauty - Campus Gardens | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-04-06}}</ref>

===New York City campus===
[[Image:Cornell med 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Weill Medical Center]] in New York City]]
Weill Medical Center, often called Weill Cornell, is on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It is home to two Cornell divisions, [[Weill Medical College]] and [[Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences]], and has been affiliated with the [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]] since 1927.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.med.cornell.edu/about | title = Weill Medical College of Cornell University - About Us | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-07-04}}</ref> Although their faculty and academic divisions are separate, the Medical Center shares its administrative functions with the [[Columbia University Medical Center]]. Weill Medical College is also affiliated with the neighboring [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], [[Rockefeller University]], and the [[Hospital for Special Surgery]]. Many faculty members have joint appointments at these institutions, and Weill Cornell, Rockefeller, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering offer the [[Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program]] to selected entering Cornell medical students.

In addition to the medical center, New York City hosts local offices for some of Cornell's service programs. The Cornell Urban Scholars Program encourages students to pursue public service careers with organizations working with New York City's poorest children, families, and communities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cusp.cornell.edu | title = Cornell Urban Scholars Program | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> The [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology|College of Human Ecology]] and the [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]] provide means for students to reach out to local communities by gardening and building with the Cornell Cooperative Extension.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cce.cornell.edu | title = Cornell Cooperative Extension | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> Students with the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|School of Industrial and Labor Relations]]' Extension & Outreach Program make workplace expertise available to organizations, union members, policy makers, and working adults.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/explore/outreach | title = ILR: Extension & Outreach Program | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> The [[Cornell University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]'s Operations Research Manhattan, in the city's [[Financial District, Manhattan|financial district]], brings together business optimization research and decision support services aimed at strengthening industry and public sector collaboration.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://manhattan.orie.cornell.edu | title = Operations Research Manhattan | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> The [[College of Architecture, Art, and Planning]] has a facility on West 17th Street, near [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], to provide studio and seminar space for students and faculty.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://aap.cornell.edu/aap/explore/nyc.cfm | title = New York City | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref>

===Qatar campus===
Weill Medical College in [[Qatar]] is in [[Education City, Qatar|Education City]], near [[Doha]]. Opened in September 2004, it was the first American medical school outside the United States.<ref name='aboutqatar' /> The college is part of Cornell's program to increase its international influence. The College is a joint initiative with the Qatar government, which seeks to improve the country's academic programs and medical care.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.qatar-med.cornell.edu/aboutUs/purpose.html?name1=Purpose+and+Mission&type1=2Active | title = Cornell Medical College in Qatar | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> Along with its full four-year MD program, which mirrors the curriculum taught at [[Weill Medical College]] in New York City, the college offers a two-year undergraduate [[pre-medical]] program with a separate admissions process. This undergraduate program opened in September 2002 and was the first [[coeducation]]al institute of [[higher education]] in Qatar.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cunews.cornell.edu/releases/April01/weill.qatar.html | title = Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-05-23}}</ref>

The college is partially funded by the Qatar government through the [[Qatar Foundation]], which contributed US$750 million for its construction.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cornellsun.com/node/17482 | title = Cornell, Qatar and Hamas | publisher = The Cornell Daily Sun | accessdate = 2006-06-18}}</ref> The medical center is housed in a large two-story structure designed by [[Arata Isozaki]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cornell.edu/academics/colleges.cfm | title = Colleges, Schools, and Faculties | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> In 2004, the Qatar Foundation announced the construction of a 350<U+2013>bed Specialty Teaching Hospital near the medical college in Education City. The hospital will be completed in 2009 and is supported by an $8 billion endowment.<ref name='aboutqatar' />

===Other facilities===
Cornell University owns and operates many facilities around the world.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.international.cornell.edu/unit | title = International Gateway | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-25}}</ref> The [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]], site of the world's largest single-dish [[radio telescope]], is operated by Cornell under a contract with the [[National Science Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.naic.edu | title = Aricebo Observatory | publisher = National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> The [[Shoals Marine Laboratory]], operated in conjunction with the [[University of New Hampshire]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu | title = Shoals Marine Laboratory | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> is a seasonal marine field station dedicated to undergraduate education and research on 95-acre (0.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) [[Appledore Island]] off the [[Maine]]<U+2013>[[New Hampshire]] coast.

Many Cornell facilities focus on [[conservationism]] and [[ecology]]. The [[New York State Agricultural Experiment Station]], operated by the [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]], is in [[Geneva, New York]], 50&nbsp;miles (80&nbsp;km) northwest of the main campus. The facility comprises 20 major buildings on 130&nbsp;acres (0.5&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of land, as well as more than 700&nbsp;acres (2.8&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of test plots and other lands devoted to horticultural research.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu | title = New York State Agricultural Experiment Station | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> It also operates three substations, Vineyard Research Laboratory in [[Fredonia, New York|Fredonia]], Hudson Valley Laboratory in [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|Highland]] and the Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory in [[Riverhead (town), New York|Riverhead]].

The [[Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology]] in Sapsucker Woods in [[Ithaca, New York]], performs research on [[biodiversity|biological diversity]], primarily in birds. In 2005, the lab announced that it had rediscovered the [[Ivory-billed woodpecker]], long thought to be [[extinct]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.birds.cornell.edu/ivory | title = Ivory-billed Woodpecker | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> The Animal Science Teaching and Research Center in [[Harford, New York]], and the Duck Research Laboratory in [[Eastport, New York]], are resources for information on animal disease control and [[husbandry]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/98/9.24.98/open-house.html | title = Animal Science Teaching Center in Dryden | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.duckhealth.com/ducklab.html | title = Duck Research Laboratory | publisher = International Duck Research Cooperative, Inc. | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> The Arnot Teaching and Research Forest, a 4,075-acre (16.5&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) forest 20&nbsp;miles (32.2&nbsp;km) south of the Ithaca campus, is the primary field location for faculty and student training and research related to professional [[forestry]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://vivo.library.cornell.edu/entity?home=4&id=6412 | title = Arnot Teaching and Research Forest | publisher = Cornell University Library | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> The mission of the Cornell Biological Field Station in [[Bridgeport, New York]], is "to provide a center for long-term ecological research and support the University's educational programs, with special emphasis on [[freshwater]] [[lake|lacustrine]] systems."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/fieldst/cbfs.htm | title = Cornell Biological Field Station | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> In addition, the university operates biodiversity laboratories in [[Punta Cana]], [[Dominican Republic]], and in the [[Amazon rainforest]] in [[Peru]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/03/3.6.03/PuntaCana_consortium.html | title = Biodiversity lab in Punta Cana expands into a new consortium | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://labs.plantbio.cornell.edu/cbl/EsBaran.html | title = Cornell Undergraduate Research Program on Biodiversity | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-30}}</ref>

The Cornell University Library is the eleventh largest academic library in the United States, ranked by number of [[book#Collections of books|volume]]s held.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000262.pdf | title = Top Twenty University Research Libraries Ranked By Number of Volumes Held | publisher = Association of Research Libraries | accessdate = 2006-07-09}}</ref> Organized into twenty divisions, in 2005 it held 7.5 million printed volumes in open stacks, 8.2 million [[microfilm]]s and [[microfiche]]s, and a total of 440,000 maps, motion pictures, DVDs, sound recordings, and computer files in its collections, in addition to extensive digital resources and the University Archives.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://library.cornell.edu/about/Annual-Report_2005.pdf | title = Cornell University Library: Annual Report 2005 | publisher = Cornell University Library | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}</ref> It was the first among all U.S. colleges and universities to allow [[undergraduates]] to borrow books from its libraries.<ref name="factbook" /> In 2006, ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' ranked it as the 11th best college library.<ref name="princeton">{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/rankings.asp?listing=1023589&ltid=1&intbucketid= | title = The Best 361 Colleges Rankings | publisher = The Princeton Review | accessdate = 2006-05-23}}</ref>

The library plays an active role in furthering online archiving of scientific and historical documents. [[arXiv]], an [[e-print]] archive created at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] by [[Paul Ginsparg]], is operated and primarily funded by Cornell as part of the library's services. The archive has changed the way many [[physicist]]s and [[mathematician]]s communicate, making the e-print a viable and popular means of announcing new research.

===Press===
The Cornell University Press, established in 1869 but inactive from 1884 to 1930, was the first university [[publishing]] enterprise in the United States.<ref name="press">{{cite web | url = http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/cup8_presshistory.html | title = The History of the Cornell University Press | publisher = Cornell University Press | accessdate = 2006-01-01}}</ref> It was established in the College of the Mechanic Arts (as [[mechanical engineering]] was called in the 19th century) because engineers knew more than literature professors did about running [[steam-power]]ed [[printing press]]es. From its inception, the press has offered work-study [[financial aid]]: students with previous training in the printing trades were paid for [[typesetting]] and running the presses that printed textbooks, pamphlets, a weekly student journal, and official university publications.

Today, the press is one of the country's largest [[university press]]es.<ref name='factbook' /> It produces approximately 150 nonfiction titles each year in various disciplines including anthropology, Asian studies, biological sciences, classics, history, industrial relations, literary criticism and theory, natural history, philosophy, politics and international relations, veterinary science, and women's studies.<ref name='press' /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/cup8_authors.html | title = Cornell University Press: Information for Authors | publisher = Cornell University Press | accessdate = 2006-06-06}}</ref> The press's acquisitions, editorial, production, and marketing departments have been located in Sage House since 1993, and the financial department is on Cascadilla Street in downtown Ithaca.<ref name="press" />

These clubs and organizations run the gamut from kayaking to full-armor jousting, from varsity and club sports and a cappella groups to improvisational theatre, from political clubs and publications to chess and video game clubs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sao.cornell.edu/SO/search2005.php?squery=&qsubmit=yes | title = SAO - Cornell University | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-03-19}}</ref> They are subsidized financially by academic departments and/or the Student Assembly and the Graduate & Professional Student Assembly, two student-run organizations with a collective budget of $3.0 million per year.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://assembly.cornell.edu/SA/ActivityFee | title = Cornell Assemblies SA Activity Fee | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://assembly.cornell.edu/GPSA/ActivityFee | title = Cornell Assemblies GPSA Activity Fee | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-12-09}}</ref>  The assemblies also finance other student life programs including a concert commission and an on-campus movie theater. Student organizations also include a myriad of musical groups that play everything from classical, jazz, to ethnic styles in addition to the [[Big Red Marching Band]], which performs regularly at football games and other campus events.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mb.bigredbands.org/history.html | title = Cornell University Big Red Marching Band - History | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-09-20}}</ref> Organized in 1868, the oldest student organization is the [[Cornell University Glee Club]]. 

Cornell hosts the second largest [[List of fraternities and sororities at Cornell University|fraternity and sorority system]] in North America, with 66 chapters involving 28% of male and 22% of female undergraduates.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.scorpiontke.org/rush/greek | title = Go Greek! | publisher = Scorpion TKE | accessdate = 2006-06-09}}</ref><ref name="greek">{{cite web | url = http://www.dos.cornell.edu/FSA/PDFs/OFSA_AR05_smaller.pdf | title = Fraternity & Sorority Advisory Council Annual Report 2004-2005 | format = PDF | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> During the 2004-05 academic year, the Greek system committed 21,668 [[community service]] and [[advocacy]] hours and raised $176,547 in philanthropic efforts.<ref name="greek" /> However, the administration has expressed concerns over student misconduct in the system. In 2004-05, of 251 social events registered with the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs, 37 (15%) resulted in a complaint. In that same year, there were five reported instances of property destruction, five reports of [[bias]], three [[hazing]] incidents, and various other allegations.<ref name="greek" /> Student misconduct is reviewed by the Judicial Administrator, Cornell's [[justice system]]. [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], the first intercollegiate [[Greek alphabet|Greek-letter]] fraternity established for [[African American]]s, was founded at Cornell in 1906.  Alpha Phi Alpha's charter was revoked in 1996 due to a hazing incident involving Cornell student Sylvester Lloyd due to allegations of intense physical beatings.{{verify source}}

===Press and Radio===
*'''''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]''''' is the oldest continuously independent college daily newspaper in the United States, having published since September 1880. In 1912, it became the first collegiate member of the [[Associated Press]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cornellsun125.com/index.php?q=node/27 | title = The Sun Also Rises: A history of America's Oldest Continuously Publishing, Independent College Daily | publisher = The Cornell Daily Sun | accessdate = 2006-06-25}}</ref> 

*'''''[[The Cornell Review]]''''' is a fortnightly [[American conservatism|conservative]] [[tabloid]] [[newspaper]] published by students. The ''Review'' incorporated in 1986 as The Ithaca Review, Inc. While the ideological makeup of its staff shifts over the years, the paper has maintained strident criticism of Cornell's perceived [[left-wing politics]] and [[political correctness]].
*'''''[[The Cornell American]]''''' is an independent student-run [[conservatism|conservative]] monthly opinion [[newspaper]], originally founded in [[1992]] by Craig Hymowitz, a chairman of the Cornell [[College Republicans]]. It competes for attention with the more established ''Cornell Review''.

*'''''[[Turn Left]]''''' is an independent student-run publication.  Founded in [[2000]] by three engineering students to counter the domination by the conservative ''Cornell Review'', Calling itself "Cornell's Liberal Voice," it focuses on political and humanitarian issues that it believes are underreported by other media outlets.<ref> Turn Left's mission statement. http://turnleft.theworldoutthere.com/?page=aboutpaper</ref>
*'''''The Cornell Centrist''''' was founded in [[September 2005]], and published its first issue in [[April 2006]].  Its purpose is to publish multiple newspaper-style journals that contain [[Centrism|centrist]], [[center-right]], and [[center-left]] political positions. It was originally conceived with the primary goal of "advancing an intellectual, sophisticated political dialogue on campus."
*The '''''Cornell Moderator''''' is a student publication founded in 2004. Its original name was ''You Turn'', a play on the name of ''Turn Left''. In its early stages, the ''Moderator'''s editorial staff opted to change the publication's name to one which would better reflect its mission. Self-described as "unabashedly unbiased", it is meant to serve as a vehicle for intellectually-honest campus discussion. The paper itself takes no editorial position, allowing the mutually-opposed arguments of its freelance writers to succeed or fail on their own merits.
*'''''[[WVBR]]''''' is an independent radio station owned and operated by Cornell students, but not affiliated with or controlled by the university. During the week, it plays mostly [[rock music]], and switches to specialty shows and community programming on the weekend. It also provides coverage of both Cornell and national sports.
*Other campus publications include the ''[http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/02/AboutChron.html Cornell Chronicle]'' (published forty three times per year) and the campus humor magazine, ''The Cornell Lunatic''.

===Housing===
{{seealso|Cornell North Campus|Cornell West Campus}}
University housing is broadly divided into three sections: [[Cornell North Campus|North Campus]], [[Cornell West Campus|West Campus]], and Collegetown. Since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ri.campuslife.cornell.edu/Ri_article_page_view.asp?action=article&ID=2318 | title = The Residential Initiative: North Campus | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-01-01}}</ref>
The only options for living on North Campus for upperclassmen are the program houses: [[Risley Hall|Risley Residential College]], [[Just About Music]], the [[Cornell North Campus#Ecology House|Ecology House]], [[Cornell North Campus#Holland International Living Center|Holland International Living Center]], the [[Cornell North Campus#Multicultural Living Learning Unit|Multicultural Living Learning Unit]], the [[Cornell North Campus#Latino Living Center|Latino Living Center]], [[Cornell North Campus#Akwe:kon|Akwe:kon]], and [[Cornell North Campus#Ujamaa|Ujamaa]].

[[Image:Risley hall, backyard.gif|right|250px|thumb|[[Risley Hall|Risley]] has served as the basis for the new residential colleges]]
In an attempt to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, the university has undertaken the $250 million residential college project on West Campus.<ref name='houses'>{{cite web | url = http://cornellsun.com/node/22275 | title = Housing Initiative to Finish Two Years Early | publisher = The Cornell Daily Sun | accessdate = 2007-04-07}}</ref> The Class Halls will be demolished and rebuilt as five [[residential college]]s named after notable deceased Cornell professors.  The first, [[Cornell West Campus#House system|Alice Cook House]], was opened to students in 2004, followed by [[Cornell West Campus#House system|Carl Becker House]] in 2005. The third house, [[Cornell West Campus#House system|Hans Bethe House]], opened in January 2007.  The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of [[Risley Hall|Risley Residential College]], the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell. Like Risley, the new houses will have their own dining halls, student governments, in-house lectures, house trips, and [[heraldry|crests]]. The completion of the five-house residential college campus will occur in August 2008.<ref name='houses' />

[[Image:Balch Halls Exterior.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Balch Hall]] is a women-only residence hall on [[Cornell North Campus|North Campus]]]]
Off campus, many homes in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Several high-rise apartment complexes have been constructed in the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although freshmen are not permitted to live in them.<ref name="greek" /> [[Housing cooperative]]s or other independent living units exist, including Watermargin, [[Telluride Association|Telluride House]], the Center for Jewish Living, and the Wait Cooperative.

In its 2006 rankings of college campus food, ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' ranked Cornell's dining services fourth overall.<ref name="princeton" /> The university has 31 on-campus dining locations, and a program called the Cross Country Gourmet Guest Restaurant Series periodically brings chefs, menus, and atmosphere from restaurants to Cornell's eight all-you-care-to-eat dining halls.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dining.cornell.edu/dining.asp | title = Cornell University Dining | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref>

An [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I#NCAA Football Championship Subdivision (former Division I-AA)|Division I-AA]] institution, Cornell is a member of the [[Ivy League#Athletics & competition|Ivy League]] and [[ECAC Hockey League]] and competes in the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC), the largest athletic conference in North America.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ecac.org/about.asp | title = About ECAC | publisher = ECAC | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}</ref> (Note that the ECAC Hockey  League is no longer affiliated with the ECAC.) The men's ice hockey team is the most historically successful of the varsity teams and is the university's most intently followed sport. Generally, although Cornell's varsity athletic teams typically earn their "share" of Ivy League titles, they do not perform well in the ECAC conference or the NCAA overall, and fail to compete consistently for national championships in most sports.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cornellsun.com/node/5304 | title = Bring it Home | publisher = The Cornell Daily Sun | accessdate = 2006-06-21}}</ref> Because of the Ivy League athletic agreement, the university is not permitted to offer academic scholarships for athletic recruiting.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cornellsun.com/node/5763 | title = Now What? A Look at Athletics in the Offseason | publisher = The Cornell Daily Sun | accessdate = 2006-06-21}}</ref>

Cornell University's [[American football|football]] team has won the Ivy League championship three times, last in 1990.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/documents/fb9091.asp| title = 1990 Ivy League Football Record| publisher = Ivy League | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}</ref> The [[Sprint Football]] team won the league championship in 2006.  The men's [[ice hockey]] team has been NCAA champion twice, ECAC champion 11 times and Ivy League champion 19 times, and recorded the only undefeated season in NCAA Division I Hockey history in 1970. The men's [[lacrosse]] team has been NCAA champion three times and Ivy League champion 21 times. The women's [[polo]] team has won the National Women's Polo Championship 11 times and the women's hockey team has been Ivy League champion 8 times. In total, Cornell's varsity athletic teams have been champions of the NCAA, ECAC, or Ivy League 114 times.

Cornell maintains athletic [[sports rivalry|rivalries]] with other collegiate institutions. The men's ice hockey team has a historic rivalry with [[Boston University]], but since BU left what became the [[ECAC Hockey League]] to join [[Hockey East]], [[Cornell-Harvard hockey rivalry|rivalry with Harvard University]] has become predominant. Following tradition, when Harvard plays the men's ice hockey team at Cornell's [[Lynah Rink]], some Big Red fans throw fish on the ice.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.elynah.com/?faq&id=4 | title = Why do we throw fish at Harvard? | publisher = eLynah | accessdate = 2006-05-23}}</ref>

Cornell and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] are long-time rivals in football. With more than 114 games played since their first meeting in 1893, this is the seventh most-played rivalry in college football.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.collegefootballnews.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=24875 | title = Most played college football rivalries | publisher = College Football News | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}</ref>  Cornell's football series against both the University of Pennsylvania and [[Dartmouth College]] are tied for second longest uninterrupted college football match-ups in history, both dating back to 1919.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stories/091404act.html| title = Cornell faces familiar foe in 2004 opener | publisher = CSTV of CBS sports media | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}</ref>  In [[polo]], the men's and women's teams maintain rivalries with the [[University of Virginia]] and the [[University of Connecticut]].

In addition to the school's varsity athletics, club sports teams have been organized as student organizations under the auspices of the Dean of Students. Cornell's intramural program includes 30 sports. Beside such familiar sports such as [[flag football]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], or [[horseshoes]], such unusual offerings as "inner tube [[Water polo#Game variations|water polo]]" and formerly "broomstick polo" have been offered, as well as a sports trivia competition.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nycolleges.org/profiles.php?Inst_ID=25 | title = NYS College Guide Campus Profile: Cornell University | publisher = NYS College Guide | accessdate = 2006-06-16}}</ref> Cornell students also often participate in the [[International Rutabaga Curling Championship]], held annually at the Ithaca Farmers' Market.

===Cornelliana===
{{main|Cornelliana}}
[[Image:Dragon Day 1901.JPG|right|thumb|250px|An early [[Dragon Day]] parade, circa 1920]]
Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian traditions include [[Slope Day]], a celebration held on the last day of classes, and [[Dragon Day]], which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/cu_facts/read_more.cfm?id=55 | title = History of Dragon Day | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-23}}</ref> According to legend, if a virgin crosses the [[Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences#The Arts Quadrangle|Arts Quad]] at midnight, the statues of [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands. The university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least three different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7&nbsp;m) tall McGraw clock tower &mdash; once a 60-pound (27&nbsp;kg) pumpkin, once a banner reading "Who is John Galt?", and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/campus/pumpkin_tale.html | title = Pumpkin Tale | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}</ref>

The school colors are [[carnelian]] (a shade of red) and white, a play on "Cornellian" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot "Touchdown" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.<ref name="mascot" /> The university's [[alma mater]] is "[[Far Above Cayuga's Waters]]" and its [[fight song]] is "[[Give My Regards to Davy]]". People associated with the university are called "[[List of Cornell University people|Cornellians]]". "Cornellian" is also used as an adjective and as the name of the university's [[yearbook]].

==Research==
For the 2004&ndash;05 fiscal year, the university spent $561.3 million on research.<ref name="research" /> The primary recipients of this funding were the colleges of Medicine ($164.2 million), Agriculture and Life Sciences ($114.5 million), Arts and Sciences ($80.3 million), and Engineering ($64.8 million).<ref name="research" /> The money comes largely from federal sources, with federal investment of $381.0 million. The federal agencies that invest the most money are the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[National Science Foundation]] that make up, respectively, 51.4% and 30.7% of all federal investment in the university.<ref name="research" /> Cornell was on the top-ten list of U.S. universities receiving the most [[patent]]s in 2003, and is one of the nation's top five institutions in forming [[start-up companies]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cornell.edu/about/facts/distinction.cfm | title = Facts about Cornell - Marks of Distinction | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-01}}</ref> In 2004<U+2013>05, Cornell received 200 invention disclosures, filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed [[royalties]] of more than $4.1 million to Cornell units and inventors.<ref name='factbook' />

[[Image:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An artist's rendering of a [[Mars Exploration Rover]] as seen on the [[Mars|"Big Red" planet]].]]
Since 1962, Cornell has been involved in unmanned missions to [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/rover/timeline.html | title = Cornell's role in missions to Mars: 1962-2003 | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-01-10}}</ref> In the 21st century, Cornell had a hand in the [[Mars Exploration Rover|Mars Exploration Rover Mission]]. Cornell's [[Steve Squyres]], Principal Investigator for the Athena Science Payload, led the selection of the landing zones and requested data collection features for the [[Spirit rover|Spirit]] and [[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]] rovers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=000B5749-67A2-1150-A5AC83414B7F0000&pageNumber=2&catID=2 | title = Science and Technology at Scientific American.com: Father of Spirit and Opportunity | publisher = Scientific American | accessdate = 2006-01-10}}</ref> [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] engineers took those requests and designed the rovers to meet them. The rovers, both of which have operated long past their original life expectancies, are responsible for the discoveries that were awarded 2004 Breakthrough of the Year honors by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/306/5704/2001 | title = Editorial: Breakthrough of the Year | publisher = Cornell University | publisher = Science | accessdate = 2006-01-10}}</ref>  Control of the Mars rovers has shifted between NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] and Cornell's Space Sciences Building.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.space.com/news/rovers_cornell_041105.html | title = Control of Mars Rovers Shifts to Cornell | publisher = Space.com | accessdate = 2006-01-10}}</ref>

The Automotive Crash Injury Research project was begun in 1952 by John O. Moore at the [[Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory|Cornell Aeronautical Research Laboratories]], which spun off in 1972 as Calspan Corporation.<ref name="cars">{{cite web | url = http://www.carsafety.com/history.htm | title = Calspan Company History and Timeline | publisher = Calspan | accessdate = 2006-06-02}}</ref> It pioneered the use of [[crash test]]ing, originally using corpses rather than [[crash test dummy|dummies]]. The project discovered that improved door locks, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards, and seat belts could prevent an extraordinary percentage of injuries.<ref name="cars" /> The project led [[Liberty Mutual]] to fund the building of a demonstration Cornell Safety Car in 1956, which received national publicity and influenced carmakers.<ref name="cars" /> Carmakers soon started their own crash-test laboratories and gradually adopted many of the Cornell innovations. Other ideas, such as rear-facing passenger seats, never found favor with carmakers or the public.

In 1984, the [[National Science Foundation]] began work on establishing five new [[supercomputer]] centers, including the [[Cornell Theory Center]], to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. In 1985, a team from the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] began the development of [[NSFNet]], a [[TCP/IP]]-based computer network that could connect to the [[ARPANET]], at the Cornell Theory Center and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. This high-speed network, unrestricted to academic users, became a backbone to which regional networks would be connected. Initially a 56-[[kilobit per second|kbit/s]] network, traffic on the network grew exponentially; the links were upgraded to 1.5-[[megabit per second|Mbit/s]] [[Digital Signal 1|T1s]] in 1988 and to 45 Mbit/s in 1991. The NSFNet was a major milestone in the development of the [[Internet]] and its rapid growth coincided with the development of the [[World Wide Web]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf0050/internet/launch.htm | title = The Internet - The Launch of NSFNET | publisher = National Science Foundation | accessdate = 2006-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=103050 | title = A Brief History of NSF and the Internet | publisher = National Science Foundation | accessdate = 2006-01-05}}</ref>

Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as [[Hans Bethe]], contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the [[Manhattan Project]]. In the 1930s, Cornell built the second [[cyclotron]] in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study [[synchrotron radiation]]. During the 1990s, the [[Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source|Cornell Electron Storage Ring]], located beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cerncourier.com/main/article/42/1/11 | title = Cornell's laboratory is at the crossroads | publisher = CERN Courier | accessdate = 2006-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lns.cornell.edu/accelphys/cesr.shtml | title = Accelerator Physics: Cornell Electron Storage Ring | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-07-04}}</ref> They have created the Lab of Ornithology, a research center for birds. It works together with the Birds of North America Online to help conserve and study birds.

Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved in the design of the proposed [[International Linear Collider]] and plan to participate in its construction and operation. The International Linear Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and shed light on questions such as the identity of [[dark matter]] and the existence of extra dimensions.
