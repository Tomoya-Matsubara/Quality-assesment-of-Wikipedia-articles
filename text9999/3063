The '''Drake Well''' is a {{Convert|69.5|ft|adj=on}} deep [[oil well]] in [[Cherrytree Township, Venango County, Pennsylvania|Cherrytree Township]], [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango County]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Pennsylvania]]. The well is the centerpiece of the [[Drake Well Museum]] located {{convert|3|mi|km}} south of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Titusville]]. 

Drilled by [[Edwin Drake]] in 1859, along the banks of [[Oil Creek (Allegheny River)|Oil Creek]], it is the first commerical oil well in the United States. Drake Well was listed on [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966. It was designated a [[Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] in 1979. The well was designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] in 2009, on the  [[wikt:sesquicentennial|sesquicentennial]] of the strike.

== Location and geology ==
The Drake Well is located in [[Cherrytree Township, Venango County, Pennsylvania|Cherrytree Township]], [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango County]] in [[northwestern Pennsylvania]]. situated on the flats {{Convert|150|ft}} from the east bank of [[Oil Creek (Allegheny River)|Oil Creek]]. The site was originally on an [[artificial island]] formed by the creek and a [[mill race]].<ref name="pees 14">Pees, p. 14.</ref> On a [[floodplain]], the well and the museum are protected by an earthen [[dyke (construction)|dike]].<ref name="pees 14"/>

Most of the oil produced in northwestern Pennsylvania was formed in [[sandstone]] [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir rocks]] at the boundary between the [[Mississippian]] and [[Devonian]] rock layers.<ref name="caplinger 6">Caplinger, p. 6.</ref> Over time, the oil migrated toward the surface, became trapped beneath an impervious layer of [[caprock]], and formed a [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]]. The presence of upwards-curving folds in the caprock called [[anticline]]s, or sometimes an inversion of an anticline called a [[syncline]], greatly varied the depth of the reservoirs, from around {{Convert|4000|ft}} to just beneath the surface.<ref name="caplinger 6"/><ref>Caplinger, p. 4.</ref> 

== History ==
Petroleum found along Oil Creek was known to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for hundreds of years through natural [[petroleum seep|seep]]s.<ref name="caplinger 6"/> Europeans became aware of the existence of petroleum in the 1600s. At the time, this "mineral-oil" was used primarily for medicinal purposes and was reputed to cure many ailments, including [[rheumatism]] and [[arthritis]].<ref>Caplinger, p. 12.</ref> Around 1848, [[Samuel Kier]] realized the pontential of the medicinal oil as an illuminant. Kier [[petroleum distillation|distilled]] the oil to make it more suitable in lamps by removing the odor and impurities that created [[soot]] when burned.<ref name="caplinger 13">Caplinger, p. 13.</ref> A sample of oil was brought to [[Dartmouth College]] by [[Francis B. Brewer]] from the Watson, Brewer and Company Farm on Oil Creek around 1853. The sample was acquired by [[George Bissell (industrialist)|George Bissell]] who, along with [[Jonathan Greenleaf Eveleth|Jonathan G. Eveleth]] purchased the farm for $5,000.<ref name="caplinger 13"/> Bissell and Eveleth took another sample of oil to [[Benjamin Silliman]] at [[Yale University]] in 1855 for further investigation. Silliman's report confirmed the quality of the petroleum and described the distallation processes needed to produce [[kerosene]].<ref name="caplinger 13"/> The Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company was incorporated and the farm tranfered to the company.<ref>Bell, p. 310.</ref>

=== Construction and operation ===
[[Edwin Drake]], a former conductor for the [[New York and New Haven Railroad]], invested $200, his entire savings, into the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company.<ref name="nom 8-1">McKithan, &sect; 8, p. 1.</ref> Drake became more involved in the company and traveled to [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Titusville]], [[Pennsylvania]] and the Brewer and Watson Farm in December&nbsp;1857. His report prompted Bissell and Eveleth to organize the Seneca Oil Company in [[Connecticut]] in March&nbsp;1858 and to place Drake in charge of producing petroleum.<ref name="caplinger 13"/><ref name="nom 8-1"/> Because Drake decided that drilling in the manner of [[salt well]]s would yield more petroleum than conventional digging, he hired William A. Smith, a [[Tarentum, Pennsylvania|Tarentum]]-blacksmith and salt-well driller, to aid in the endeavor.<ref name="caplinger 13"/> An engine house and [[derrick]] were constructed, and Drake purchased a {{Convert|6|hp|adj=on}}, horizontal [[steam engine]]. The steam engine was used to ram the drill through the soil until it reached [[bedrock]] {{Convert|32|ft}} down. After it was found that [[groundwater]] would cause the walls of the hole to collapse, Drake acquired {{Convert|50|ft}} of [[cast iron]] pipe to stabilize the hole.<ref name="nom 8-1"/> After reaching bedrock, Drake and Smith were able to drill at a rate of {{Convert|3|ft}} per day.<ref name="caplinger 13"/> Drake's colleagues back in Connecticut gave up on finding any oil by April&nbsp;1859 and after spending $2,500; Drake took out a $500 loan to keep the operation going.<ref name="nyt">{{Cite news |title=When First Oil Flowed |date=July 22, 1934 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=XX-12}}</ref> The drill reached its maximun depth of {{Convert|69.5|ft}} on August&nbsp;27, 1859. Smith visited the well the next day and found oil visible on top of the water {{Convert|5|in}} from the top of the well.<ref name="nom 8-1"/> The oringial structures at the well caught fire in October&nbsp;1859 and were rebuilt by Drake a month later. The well produced {{Convert|12|to|20|oilbbl|lk=on}} a day, but, after the price of plummetted from the resulting [[oil boom]], it was never profitable.<ref name="nyt"/> The well stopped producing in 1861 and the Seneca Oil Company sold the property in 1864. The derrick was moved in 1876 to the [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>Sherman, p. 34.</ref>

=== Preservation ===
The well remained abandoned until 1889, when David Emery of Titusville bought the site, erected a derrick and cleaned out the well. Emery was able to obtain a small quantity of petroleum from the well and attempted to sell it as souvenirs to raise funds "to perpetuate the site", but died before he was able to do so.<ref name="nyt"/> His widow donated the {{Convert|1|acre}} that included the well to the Canadohta Chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] in 1913.

Drake Well was listed on [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] on November&nbsp;13, 1966 by the [[National Park Service]].<ref name="focus"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=List of National Historic Landmarks by State |work=National Historic Landmarks Program |month=June |year=2011 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nhl/designations/Lists/LIST11.pdf |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref> It was designated a [[Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] in October&nbsp;1979.<ref name="asme">{{Cite web |title=#40 Drake Oil Well (1859) |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/history/landmarks/topics-m-z/minerals-extraction-and-refining/-40-drake-oil-well-(1859) |accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref> The [[American Chemical Society]] designated the Drake Well a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] on August&nbsp;27, 2009, the 150th anniversary of the strike.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Development of the Pennsylvania Oil Industry |publisher=American Chemical Society |url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&node_id=924&content_id=CNBP_022829&use_sec=true&sec_url_var=region1&__uuid=a78b4cfa-7180-4e34-930f-82fae0d31d42#P76_12356 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>
