'''Contemporary R&B''' (also known as '''R&B''', '''urban pop''') is a [[music genre]] of [[western culture|western]] [[popular music]]. Although the acronym "R&B" originates from its association with traditional rhythm and blues music, the term ''R&B'' is today most often used to define a style of [[African American]] music originating after the demise of [[disco]] in the 1980s. This newer style combines elements of [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[dance music|dance]], and, from 1986 on with the advent of [[New Jack Swing]] branded R&B, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].

The abbreviation ''R&B'' is almost always used instead of the full ''rhythm and blues'' term, although some sources refer to the style as '''[[urban contemporary]]''' (the name of the [[radio format]] that plays hip hop and contemporary R&B).

Contemporary R&B has a slick, electronic [[record production]] style, [[drum machine]]-backed rhythms, the occasional guitar riff to give the song a [[Rock music|rock]] feel, the occasional [[saxophone]] solo to give a [[jazz]] feel (mostly common in R&B songs prior to the year 1993), and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Uses of hip hop-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop is usually reduced and smoothed out. R&B vocalists are often known for their use of [[melisma]], which was popularized by [[Mariah Carey]].<ref name=TheVillageVoice-Feb2003>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = "Vision of Love" sets off melisma trend | newspaper = [[The Village Voice]] | pages = | year = | date = [[February 4]] [[2003]] | url = }}</ref><ref name=TheNewYorker-Apr2006>{{cite web | last = Frere-Jones | first = Sasha | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = On Top: Mariah Carey's record-breaking career | work = [[The New Yorker]] | publisher = [[Cond<U+00E9>Net]] | date = [[April 3]] [[2006]] | url = http://www.newyorker.com/critics/music/?060403crmu_music | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-08-30 }}</ref><ref name=RollingStone-Nov2008>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The 100 Greatest Singer of All Time : Rolling Stone | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | publisher =  | date = [[November 12]] [[2008]] | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/greatestsingers/page/79 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-11-22 }}</ref>

==History==
===1980s===
With the transition from soul and disco to R&B in the early to mid 1980s, new stars such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Michael Jackson]] rose in pop. Jackson's ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' re-popularized black music with pop audiences after a post-disco backlash among United States mainstream audiences.

Female R&B singers such as [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Janet Jackson]] became very popular during the second half of the 1980s, and [[Tina Turner]] came back with a series of hits with [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] appeal. Also popular was [[New Edition]], a group of teenagers who served as the prototype for later [[boy band]]s.

In 1986, [[Teddy Riley (new jack swing)|Teddy Riley]] began producing R&B recordings that included influences from the increasingly popular genre of hip hop. This combination of R&B style and hip hop rhythms was termed [[new jack swing]], and was applied to artists such as [[Keith Sweat]], [[Guy (band)|Guy]], [[Jodeci]], [[Bell Biv DeVoe]], and the popular late 1980s/early 1990s work of Michael Jackson. Another popular, but short-lived group (with more pronounced R&B roots) was [[Levert]]. Also, H-Bone (Henry O'Sullivan), was one R&B artist who played to the soulful in the back-streets of Chicago. 

In the late 1980s, [[George Michael]] become one of Britain's best-known Contemporary R&B musicians. His debut album ''[[Faith (George Michael album)|Faith]]'' went to the top of the R&B album chart in the [[United States|US]], making him the first white artist to achieve this honor. ''Faith'' produced an amazing chart-topping singles, including a U.S. R&B number-one hit. The album also won several music award including the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. 

=== 1990s ===
During the early 1990s, new jack swing/R&B group [[Boyz II Men]], the most successful R&B male vocal group of all time, re-popularized classic soul-inspired vocal harmonies. Several similar groups (such as [[Shai (band)|Shai]], [[Soul for Real]], [[Az Yet]], [[All-4-One]], and [[Dru Hill]]) followed in their footsteps. Boyz II Men and several of their competitors benefited from producers such as [[Babyface]] and [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. As a solo artist, Babyface and contemporaries such as [[Brian McKnight]] eschewed prominent hip hop influences, and recorded in a smooth, soft style of R&B.

In contrast to the works of Boyz II Men, Babyface and similar artists, other R&B artists from this same period began adding even more of a hip hop sound to their work. The synthesizer-heavy rhythm tracks of new jack swing was replaced by grittier [[East Coast hip hop]]-inspired backing tracks, resulting in a genre labeled [[hip hop soul]] by producer [[Sean Combs]]. Hip hop soul artists such as [[Mary J. Blige]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], [[Brandy (entertainer)|Brandy]], [[Ginuwine]], [[Usher Raymond|Usher]] and [[Aaliyah]] brought more of hip hop slang, suggestive or explicitly sexual lyrics, style, and attitude to R&B music. This subgenre includes a heavy gospel influence in terms of vocal inflections and sounds. The style became less popular by the end of the 1990s, but later experienced a resurgence.

During the mid 1990s, [[Mariah Carey]], girl groups [[TLC (band)|TLC]] and [[SWV]] and Boyz II Men brought contemporary R&B to the mainstream. Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey recorded several [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hits, including "[[One Sweet Day]]", a collaboration between both acts which became the longest-running number-one hit in Hot 100 history.

Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men and TLC released albums in 1994 and 1995&mdash;''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'', ''[[II (Boyz II Men album)|II]]'' , and ''[[CrazySexyCool]]''  respectively &mdash; that sold over ten million copies, earning them diamond [[RIAA certification]]. Other top-selling R&B artists from this era included [[Vanessa L. Williams]],[[Toni Braxton]], Ginuwine, Mary J. Blige, Brandy, Monica, [[Aaliyah]], Usher and R. Kelly, and groups [[En Vogue]], [[BLACKstreet]], [[Salt-N-Pepa]], [[SWV]], [[Jodeci]]/[[K-Ci & JoJo]] and [[Destiny's Child]]. In the late 1990s in 1998, R & B singer [[Aaliyah]] scored a smash hit with the single [[Are You That Somebody?]] off of the Dr Doolittle soundtrack, which many music critics saw the point where she was throned, "The Queen Of Urban Pop"

In the late 1990s, [[neo soul]] (which added 1970s soul influences to the hip hop soul blend) arose, led by artists such as [[D'Angelo]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Lauryn Hill]], and [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]]. Artists such as [[Missy Elliott]] further blurred the line between R&B and hip hop by recording both styles

===2000s===
In the [[United Kingdom]], R&B found its way into the [[UK garage]] subgenre of [[UK garage#2-step|2-step]], typified by R&B-style singing accompanied by [[breakbeat]]/[[drum and bass]] rhythms. Among the most notable 2-step acts are [[Mis-Teeq]], [[Lisa Maffia]] and [[Craig David]], who crossed over to American R&B audiences in the early 2000s.

Soulful R&B continues to be popular, with artists such as [[Mariah Carey]], [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]], [[Mario (singer)|Mario]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Rihanna]], [[Lyfe Jennings]], [[Tyrese]], [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]], and [[John Legend]] showcasing classic influences in their work.
