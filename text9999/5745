'''Emery Molyneux''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8><U+025B>m(<U+0259>)r<U+026A>i <U+02C8>m<U+0251>l<U+0259>no<U+028A>}}, ''[[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|EM-(<U+0259>-)ree MO-l<U+0259>-noe]]'') (died June 1598) was an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] maker of [[globe]]s, mathematical instruments and [[Weapon|ordnance]]. His terrestrial and celestial globes, first published in 1592, were the first to be made in [[England]] and the first to be made by an Englishman.

Known as a [[mathematician]] and maker of mathematical instruments such as [[compass]]es and [[hourglass]]es, Molyneux became acquainted with many prominent men of his age, including the explorers [[Thomas Cavendish]], [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]], [[Francis Drake]] and [[Walter Raleigh]], the writer [[Richard Hakluyt]], and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made in such a way that they were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.

Molyneux emigrated to [[Amsterdam]] with his wife in 1596&ndash;1597. He succeeded in interesting the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]], the parliament of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], in a cannon he had invented but died suddenly in June 1598, apparently in poverty. The globe-making industry in England died with him.

Only six Molyneux globes are believed to be still in existence. Three are in England, of which one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is owned by [[Middle Temple]] and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at [[Petworth House]] in [[Petworth]], [[West Sussex]].

===Construction===
Emery Molyneux is regarded as being both the maker of the first terrestrial and celestial globes in England, and the first English globe-maker.<ref name="Wallis 1951">A manuscript, MS Harl. 5208, at pp. 50&ndash;51, which is an account "by a Freind" of William Sanderson's achievements, describes the globes as "the first soe published in Christendome, for the honor of his countrey, and good of the Schollers, Gentrye and Marriners of the same." No earlier English-made globes are known: {{citation|last=Wallis|first=Helen M[argaret]|authorlink=Helen Wallis|title=The first English globe: A recent discovery|journal=[[The Geographical Journal]]|volume=117|year=1951|page=275, n. 1}}.</ref> Little is known about the man himself.

====Terrestrial globes====
In making his terrestrial globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea)<ref>According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a ''ruttier'' is "[a] set of instructions for finding one's course at sea; a marine guide to the routes, tides, etc.": {{citation|contribution=ruttier, ''n.''|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50211010|title=OED Online|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=December 2007|accessdate=2008-02-04}}.</ref> and pilots (navigational handbooks).<ref>{{citation|contribution=pilot, ''n.'' and ''adj.''|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50179337|title=OED Online|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=December 2007|accessdate=2008-02-04}}.</ref> such as the ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies he gave to [[Thomas Harriot]] in 1590.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", pp. 277<U+2013>278.</ref><ref name="ODNB"/> He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians.<ref>"Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xii.</ref> It is likely, for instance, that he obtained information for a legend in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]<ref>The legend, which appears in the [[Pacific Ocean]], states: "''Islas estas descubrio Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa por la corona de Castilla y Leon desde el a<U+00F1>o 1568 llamolas Islas de Jesus aunque vulgarmente las llaman Islas de Salomon''" ("Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa discovered these islands and claimed them for the crown of [[Castile and Le<U+00F3>n]]. From 1568 onwards, the islands were named the Jesus Islands, though they are more commonly known as the [[Solomon Islands]]"): "Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xxx.</ref> on the terrestrial globe about the [[Solomon Islands]] from Sir Walter Raleigh, who was informed of it by [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]]. In 1584 Sarmiento de Gamboa, a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] explorer sent by [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]] to fortify the [[Strait of Magellan]] after Francis Drake had passed through it, was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks after being captured while on a journey to Europe by an English fleet under Raleigh.<ref>"Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xxx.</ref>

Molyneux accompanied [[Francis Drake]] on his 1577&ndash;1580 [[circumnavigation]] of the world; Ubaldini reported that "[h]e himself has been in those seas and on those coasts in the service of the same Drake".<ref name="Crino & Wallis"/> A legend in [[Latin]] on the terrestrial globe explaining why Molyneux had left out the [[Polar region|polar lands]] and corrected the distance across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[The Lizard]] and [[Cape Race]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] concluded:

On the terrestrial globe, tracks of the voyages of Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish around the world are marked by red and blue lines respectively. These lines were applied when the globe was first made, for they are referred to in a description of Molyneux's globes in ''Blundeville His Exercises'' (1594)<ref>{{cite book|last=Blundeville|first=Thomas|title=M.

This can be discerned from the phrase "''Iodocus Hon: / dius Flan. sc. / 1592''" on the celestial globe that appears together with Sanderson's [[coat of arms]] and a dedication to the Queen dated 1592. Molyneux's own name is set out on the Middle Temple terrestrial globe in the phrase "''Emerius Mulleneux Angl.' / sumptibus Gulielmi&mdash; / Sandersoni Londin<U+0113>: / sis descripsit''" ("Emery Molyneux of England, at the expense of William Sanderson of London, described this").<ref>"Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xxxi. The texts of the inscriptions are from Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 280.</ref>

====Celestial globes====
Molyneux's celestial globe was virtually a copy of [[Gerardus Mercator]]'s globe of 1551, which itself was based on a globe of 1537 by [[Gemma Frisius]] that Mercator had helped to construct.<ref>It has also been stated that Molyneux's celestial globe was based largely on the {{convert|52.5|cm|in|adj=on}} celestial globe made by Dutch globe-maker Jacob Floris van Langren, and that it shows the canonical 48 [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] [[constellation]]s of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] created by the Dutch cartographer [[Petrus Plancius]]: {{citation|author=Susan Doran (ed.)|authorlink=Susan Doran|title=Elizabeth: The Exhibition at the National Maritime Museum|location=London|publisher=[[Chatto and Windus]] in association with the [[National Maritime Museum]]|year=2003|isbn=0701174765|page=134}}.</ref> To the [[constellation]]s featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] and [[Triangulum Australe|Southern Triangle]], rather too far to the west of their true positions. His source appears to have been [[Andrea Corsali]]'s diagram of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] sky published<ref>In {{cite book|last=Ramusio|first=Giovanni Battista (ed.)|title=Primo Volume delle Navigationi et Viaggi nel qual si contiene la descrittione dell'Africa: e del Paese del Prete Ianni, con varii viaggi, dal Mar Rosso <U+00E0> Calicut, et infin all'Isole Molucche... et la Navigatione attorno il Mondo [First Volume of Navigation and Travels which include the Description of Africa: and of the Lands of Prester John, with Several Travels, from the Red Sea to Calicut and finally to the Moluccan Islands... and the Navigation Around the World]|location=&#91;[[Veneto]]&#93;|publisher=Gli Heredi di Lucantonio Giunti [The Heirs of Lucantonio Guinti]|year=1550|language=[[Italian language|Italian]]}}</ref> in 1550.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", pp. 283&ndash;284.</ref>

Molyneux's globes were the first to be constructed in such a way that they were unaffected by humidity at sea. They were made of flour-paste, which was an unusual material for the time. Simon Forman remarked that Molyneux's [[Molding (process)|moulding]] or [[casting]] process was "the only way to caste [anything] whatsoever in perfecte forme... and yt is the perfectest and trewest waie of all wayes... and this was the wai that Mullenax did use to cast flowere [flour] in the verie forme".<ref>[[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Manuscript|MS]] Ashmole 1494, folio 1491.</ref><ref name="ODNB"/>

Molyneux's progress in manufacturing the globes was reported by Ubaldini in letters to the Duke of Milan. Ubaldini was in attendance when Molyneux presented a pair of [[manuscript]] globes to Elizabeth I at [[Greenwich]] in July 1591,<ref>{{citation|author=Susan Doran (ed.)|authorlink=Susan Doran|title=Elizabeth: The Exhibition at the National Maritime Museum|location=London|publisher=[[Chatto and Windus]] in association with the [[National Maritime Museum]]|year=2003|isbn=0701174765|page=134}}. The ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' states that the first pair of Molyneux's globes was presented to Elizabeth I in Greenwich in July 1592.</ref> and noted that "he gave her the globe to let her see at a glance how much of the world she could control by means of her naval forces".<ref name="NMM"/> According to Wallis, the printed globes were published after some delay in the late months of 1592 or some time between January and March 1593.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 280.</ref> Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in [[Newington Butts]] to present these globes to the Queen. His son, also named William, recorded that on being given the terrestrial globe she remarked, "The whole earth, a present for a Prince...". When she was presented the celestial globe at a second entertainment, she said, "Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also: God guide me, to Govern my part of the one, that I may enjoy but a mansion place in this other."<ref>{{citation|author=William Sanderson [the younger]|title=An Answer to a Scurrilous Pamphlet Intituled, Observations upon a Compleat History of...

[[Image:Cannoniere 1652-part.jpg|thumb|left|A diagram of a [[cannon]] from John Roberts' ''The Compleat Cannoniere'' (1652)]]

==Later life==
In the 1590s, Molyneux sought Elizabeth I's patronage for the production of a [[cannon]], which he described as his "new invention, of [[Lead shot|shot]] and [[artillery]], to be used principally in [[naval warfare]]: protection of ports and harbours, a new shot to discharge a thousand [[musket]] shot; with wildfire not to be quenched".<ref>''Calendar of State Papers: Domestic Series'', 1574&ndash;1580; 1595&ndash;1597.</ref> In 1595 the merchant Robert Parkes purchased coal, [[Saltpeter|saltpetre]], [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], oils and waxes for him, possibly for the cannon. In March 1593 Molyneux was issued with a [[Royal Warrant|royal warrant]] and the matter was considered by the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] on [[4 November]] [[1596]], when the [[Admiralty|Lord Admiral]] was urged "to speak to Molyneux, Bussy and the two Engelberts about their offensive engines"<ref>''Calendar of State Papers: Domestic Series'', 1595&ndash;1597, p. 303.</ref> as part of measures to defend England's south coast. It appears the request was ignored. On [[27 September]] [[1594]]<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 307.</ref> the Queen granted Molyneux a gift of <U+00A3>200 and an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] of <U+00A3>50, but he chose to surrender the latter when some time between March or April 1596 and [[4 June]] [[1597]]<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 307.</ref> he and his wife Anne emigrated to [[Amsterdam]], [[Holland]].<ref name="ODNB"/> Wallis has conjectured that he took with him the printing plates for the globes and sold them to Hondius, who had returned to Amsterdam in 1593.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 308.</ref>

Why Molyneux left England for Holland is unclear. The ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' suggests it was to be able to personally distribute his globes to European princes, for Amsterdam was then quickly establishing itself as the centre of globe- and map-making.<ref name="ODNB"/> However, this could not have been his intention if he had sold the globes' plates to Hondius. It is possible that he had decided to concentrate on manufacturing ordnance. On [[26 January]] [[1598]], the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]], the parliament of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], showed interest in Molyneux's cannon and granted him a 12-year privilege on an invention. On [[6 June]] he lodged a second application, but died in Amsterdam almost immediately. His wife was granted [[Administrator of an estate|administration]] of his [[Estate (law)|estate]] in England later that month. It seems that Molyneux died in poverty, as Anne was granted a Dutch compassionate [[pension]] of 50 [[Dutch guilder|florins]] on [[9 April]] [[1599]]. Molyneux apparently had no surviving family, and the English globe-making industry died with him.<ref name="ODNB"/> No other globes appear to have been manufactured in England until the appearance in the 1670s of globes by [[Robert Morden]] and William Berry, and by [[Joseph Moxon]].<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 310.</ref> However, over 40&nbsp;years after Molyneux's death, William Sanderson the younger wrote that his globes were "yet in being, great and small ones, Celestiall and Terrestriall, in both our Universities and severall Libraries (here, and beyond Seas)".<ref>Sanderson, ''An Answer to a Scurrilous Pamphlet'', cited in Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 275.</ref>

Having, it is believed, purchased the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius was granted a ten-year privilege on [[1 April]] [[1597]] to make and publish a terrestrial globe, and in that year produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' ''Tractatus de Globis''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hues|first=Robert|coauthors=[[Jodocus Hondius|Iudocum Hondium]] (transl.)|title=Tractaet Ofte Hendelinge van het gebruijck der Hemelscher ende Aertscher Globe [Treatise or Instructions for the Use of the Celestial and Terrestrial Globes]|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Cornelis Claesz|year=1597|language=[[Dutch language|Dutch]]}} See Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 304.</ref> Despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years from [[31 October]] [[1598]].<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 306.</ref> He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius's world map of 1608 on the Mercator projection relied on Molyneux's globe as it bears a number of legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from the globe.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 277. See also {{citation|last=Hooker|first=Brian|title=New light on Jodocus Hondius' great world Mercator map of 1598|url=http://www.findingnz.co.nz/at/hat2_new_light_j_hondius_world_map_1608.htm|journal=[[The Geographical Journal]]|volume=159|issue=1|date=March 1993|pages=45&ndash;50|doi:10.2307/3451488}}.</ref>

In his globes of 1612, van Langeren incorporated the improvements to Molyneux's globe that Hondius the Elder had made, and it is believed that the Hondius globes spurred [[Willem Blaeu]] to start constructing his large globes in 1616, which were published in 1622. Molyneux's globes therefore had an indirect influence on Dutch globe-making.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", pp. 309&ndash;310.</ref>

===Culture===
The appearance of Molyneux's globes had a significant influence on the culture of his time. In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', written between 1592 and 1594, one of the [[protagonist]]s, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: "No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her."<ref>''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', Act III, scene ii.</ref> The jest gained its point from the globes' publication, and Shakespeare may have personally seen them.<ref>Wallis, "Globes in England up to 1660", p. 276.</ref> [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[dramatist]] [[Thomas Dekker]] wrote in one of his plays published in ''The Gull's Horn-book'' (1609):<ref name="ODNB"/>

{{quote|What an excellent workman, therefore, were he that could cast the globe of it into a new mould.

It has been suggested that the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], the [[playing company]] that Shakespeare worked for as an actor and playwright for most of his career, named their playing space built in 1599 the [[Globe Theatre]] as a response to growing enthusiasm for terrestrial and celestial globes that had been stimulated by those manufactured by Molyneux.<ref>{{citation|last=Cohen|first=A[dam] M[ax]|title=Englishing the globe: Molyneux's globes and Shakespeare's theatrical career|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=37|issue=4|date=Winter 2006|pages=963&ndash;984}}.

In ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (1600&ndash;1601), Shakespeare alluded to the Wright&ndash;Molyneux Map by having Maria say teasingly of Malvolio: "He does smile his face into more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies."<ref name="Virginia"/>

==The globes today==
It appears that only six Molyneux globes are in existence today, two terrestrial globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in [[Zerbst]], [[Nuremberg]] (at the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] (German National Museum)) and [[Kassel]] ([[Hessisches Landesmuseum]] ([[Hesse]] Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum originally had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but this is believed to have been destroyed during [[World War II]]. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is presently owned by [[Middle Temple]] in London and is displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at [[Petworth House]] in [[Petworth]], [[West Sussex]].<ref name="Wallis 1952">{{citation|last=Wallis|first=Helen M[argaret]|authorlink=Helen Wallis|title=A newly-discovered Molyneux globe|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=9|year=1952|page=78}}.</ref>

===Petworth House globe===
[[Image:Petworth House, Geograph.jpg|thumb|[[Petworth House]], [[West Sussex]], in 1986]]

A terrestrial globe<ref>For a photograph of the Petworth House globe, see the [http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-108205-features-curators_choice-gallery_picture Curators' Choice photo gallery] on the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] website. Retrieved on [[11 February]] [[2008]].</ref> was discovered in [[Baron Leconfield|Lord Leconfield]]'s library at [[Petworth House]] in [[Petworth]], [[West Sussex]], in July 1949. According to the tradition of the Wyndham family, who are descended from [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland]], the globe belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh who gave it to Northumberland when they were imprisoned together in the [[Tower of London]]. Northumberland, known as the "Wizard Earl" for his interest in scientific and [[Alchemy|alchemical]] experiments and his library,<ref>{{cite web|last=Singmaster|first=David|title=BSHM Gazetteer: Petworth, West Sussex|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bshm/zingaz/P.html#petw|publisher=[[British Society for the History of Mathematics]]|date=[[2003-02-28]]|accessdate=2008-02-07}} See also {{cite web|last=Singmaster|first=David|title=BSHM Gazetteer: Thomas Harriot|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bshm/zingaz/LondonPeopleH.html#harriot|publisher=[[British Society for the History of Mathematics]]|date=[[2003-02-28]]|accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> was suspected of being involved in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 as his relative [[Thomas Percy (plotter)|Thomas Percy]] was one of the conspirators. Raleigh was imprisoned in the Tower for treason due to his alleged involvement in the [[Main Plot]] against [[James I of England|James I]]. Although the theory is supported by [[circumstantial evidence]], a number of entries in Northumberland's accounts relating to the mending of globes, one dating back to 1596, suggest that the Molyneux globe belonged to him from the beginning and was not Raleigh's.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 311; Wallis, "Globes in England up to 1660", p. 276.</ref> It is, however, almost certain that the globe spent many years in the Tower before being transferred to Petworth House where Northumberland was confined upon his release in 1621.<ref name="Wallis 1952"/>

The Petworth House globe, presently in the North Gallery, is valuable for being the only Molyneux terrestrial globe existing in its original 1592 state. One of Molyneux's "great globes", measuring {{convert|2|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, it was reported in 1952 to have been in poor condition despite restoration by the [[British Museum]] the previous year.<ref name="Wallis 1952"/> The [[northern hemisphere]] was darkened by dirt and badly rubbed in places to the extent that it was hard to read. Some parts of it, and large sections of the [[southern hemisphere]], are missing altogether.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 285.</ref> The restoration work revealed that the globe is weighted with sand and made from layers of small pieces of paper overlaid with a coat of [[plaster]] about {{convert|0.125|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick. On top of this is another layer of paper over which the gores are pasted. The globe retains its wooden horizon circle and brass [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] ring, but its hour circle and index are missing.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 282.</ref> Further restoration took place between 1995 and 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Petworth House: Globe|url=http://www.yeoldesussexpages.com/petworth/norgal.htm|publisher=Ye Olde Sussex Pages|accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref>

The globe was exhibited at the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1951 and 1952.<ref name="Wallis 1952"/>

===Middle Temple globes===
The earliest reference to the Molyneux terrestrial and celestial globes<ref>For a photograph of the Middle Temple globes, see {{cite web|title=Molyneux globes|url=http://www.middletemple.org.uk/Library/Molyneux_Globes.html|publisher=[[Middle Temple]]|year=2006&ndash;2007|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> being in the possession of the Middle Temple is a bill in the accounts for [[11 April]] [[1717]] for "repairing the globes in the library".<ref name="Middle Temple">"The Molyneux globes", an information sheet distributed by Middle Temple during the Temple Open Weekend on 19 and 20 January 2008.</ref> Markham's view was that Robert Ashley (1565&ndash;1641), a [[Barristers in England and Wales|barrister]] of the Middle Temple who was also an ardent [[geographer]], was likely to have owned the globes and left them to the [[Inns of Court|Inn]] together with his books in his will. Ashley's books formed the nucleus of the Inn's original library, and included copies of the second edition of Hues' ''Tractatus de Globis'' and other works on [[cosmography]].<ref>"Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xxxii.</ref> On the other hand, Wallis has said that Markham's view is not supported by any available evidence and the globes are not specifically mentioned in the will. She feels that they were probably acquired on their publication in 1603.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", pp. 287&ndash;288.</ref>

[[Image:Middle-Temple-Library.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of Middle Temple Library in 1892 by Herbert Railton]]

The celestial globe is dated 1592 but the terrestrial globe bears the year 1603, the only example of its kind.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 280.</ref> Wallis has surmised that the globes were made by Hondius in Amsterdam in 1603 after receiving an order from England, perhaps from the Middle Temple itself. The celestial globe was made from the original 1592 printing plates, while the terrestrial globe was produced using revised plates that were redated to 1603.<ref>Wallis, "Globes in England up to 1660", p. 278.</ref> The Petworth House terrestrial globe of 1592 differs from the Middle Temple one in that the latter incorporated Raleigh's discoveries in [[Guyanas|Guiana]]<ref>Probably a reference to [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and [[French Guiana]], three countries on the northeast coast of [[South America]].</ref> and provided new place-names in [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]], and on the continent of [[Africa]]. An island marked "[[Korea|Corea]]" off the coast of [[China]] was also added. The most extensive revision was that to the [[Northeast Passage]], which was amended to take into account discoveries made on [[Willem Barentsz]]'s third voyage to [[Novaya Zemlya]] in 1596. It appears that the revisions to the original plates of Molyneux's globe were completed by 1597, as no discoveries after that year are included.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", pp. 304&ndash;305.</ref> It is possible that Molyneux helped Hondius to update the plates in 1596 or 1597. For instance, if Hondius had obtained a copy of Raleigh's map of Guiana, Molyneux was most likely his source.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", pp. 306, 308.</ref> Unlike the Petworth House globe, the Middle Temple globes are heavily [[varnish]]ed. The varnish could have been first applied as early as 1818 when the globes were repaired by J. and W. Newton, and they were certainly varnished by Messrs. Holland Hannen & Cubitts, Ltd. during maintenance work performed in 1930.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 285.</ref>

At the start of World War II, the globes were sent to [[Beaconsfield]] and stored with part of the [[Wallace Collection]] at Hall Barn in the care of [[Baron Burnham|Lady Burnham]]. They were brought back to London in 1945, and were at one stage placed in the [[King's Library]] on loan to the British Museum.<ref name="Wallis 1952"/><ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 276.</ref> The globes were installed in the position where they now stand in Middle Temple Library when the current library building opened in 1958.<ref name="Middle Temple"/> In 2003, the globes were loaned to the [[National Maritime Museum]] for an exhibition commemorating the life of Elizabeth I.<ref>{{citation|contribution=Molyneux globes|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040419/text/40419w05.htm|title=[[Hansard|House of Lords Hansard]]|volume=660|date=[[2004-04-19]]}}, col. WA18.</ref>

In 2004, Middle Temple proposed the sale of the Molyneux globes, valued at over <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million, to create a scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would-be barristers. Its members eventually decided by a large majority against such a move. There was also a general feeling that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Berlins|first=Marcel|title=Words' worth: Pay-per-word?

===Hessisches Landesmuseum globe===
The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were inherited from the collection of [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|William IV]] (William the Wise), the [[Landgrave]] of [[Hesse-Kassel]], who was a pioneer of [[Astronomy|astronomical]] research. As William died in 1592 it has been surmised that his son and successor, [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Maurice]], purchased the globes for the collection. The globes were first mentioned in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the F<U+00FC>rstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel in the reign of Landgrave Frederick III in 1765.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 288.</ref> Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.
