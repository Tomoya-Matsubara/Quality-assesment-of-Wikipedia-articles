==History==
[[Image:Boston Logan Airport from Terminal E.JPG|thumb|left|Boston's Logan International Airport from the airside lounge of Terminal E, illustrating how the airport is largely surrounded by water. In the foreground is an [[Aer Lingus]] [[Airbus A330-300]].]]
Originally called '''Boston Airport''', Logan opened on September 8, 1923, and was used primarily by the Massachusetts Air Guard and the Army Air Corps. At that time, it was known as '''Jeffery Field'''. The first scheduled commercial passenger flights were initiated by [[Colonial Air Transport]] between Boston and [[New York City]] in 1927.<ref name="Logan History">{{cite web |url=http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/about-logan/Pages/LoganHistory.aspx |title=History | publisher=Massport | year=2010 | accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

The airport has expanded over the years, including the 1940s addition of {{convert|1800|acre}} of landfill in [[Boston Harbor]] and the incorporation of the former [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors]], [[Noddle's Island|Noddle's]] and [[Apple Island (Massachusetts)|Apple]] Islands. In 1943 the state renamed the airport as General [[Edward Lawrence Logan]] International Airport after a [[Spanish-American War]] officer from South Boston.<ref name="Logan History" /> In 1952 the airport became the first in the United States with an indirect rapid transit connection.

The December 1950 diagram shows a familiar layout: {{convert|7000|ft|m|abbr=on}} runway 4L, 10000-ft 4R, 7000-ft 9 and 7650-ft 33. The March 1947 shows {{convert|7000|ft|m|abbr=on}} runway 4 (future 4L) in use, with runways 9 and 33 under construction; a different runway 33 ran {{convert|6700|ft|m|abbr=on}} northwestward from the present intersection of 4R and 9, and runway 25 ran {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}} southwest from the present intersection of 4L and 33.

The era of the jumbo jet began at Logan during the summer of 1970 when [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] inaugurated daily [[Boeing 747]] service to [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Non-stop flights to London now{{when|date=September 2011}} are scheduled by [[British Airways]], [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Atlantic]].

When Terminal E opened in 1974 it was the second largest international arrivals facility in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3734/is_199706/ai_n8764688/ | title=Logan 2000: A world class upgrade for the 21st century | author=Brush, David | date=June 1997 | work=ITE Journal | publisher=Institute of Transportation Engineers | accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref> Since that time the number of international travelers using Logan has tripled.{{when|date=September 2011}} International long-haul travel has been the fastest growing market sector at Logan. Increased passenger traffic led the [[Massachusetts Port Authority]] (Massport) to embark on a major airport renewal project called the "Logan Modernization Project" from 1994 to 2006. The project included a new parking garage, a new hotel, moving walkways, terminal expansions and improvements, and a two-tiered roadway system that separates arrival from departure road traffic.<ref name="Logan History" />

Massport's relationship with neighboring communities has been strained since the mid-1960s,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Nelkin | first = Dorothy | year = 1974 | title = Jetport: the Boston airport controversy | publisher = Transaction Publishers | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=OGyP64Vm7TcC&pg | accessdate = | isbn = 0878555919, 9780878555918 | page = 80}}</ref> when the agency took control of a parcel of residential land and popular fishing area near the northwest side of the airfield. This project was undertaken to extend Runway 15R/33L, which would later become Logan's longest runway.<ref>Nelkin, p. 80-82.</ref> Residents of the neighborhood, known as Wood Island, were bought out of their homes and forced to relocate. Public opposition came to a head when residents lay down in the streets to block bulldozers and supply trucks from reaching the intended construction zone.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0FF408367934CDD2&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Their 2D Run at Runway | author=MacDonald, Christine | date=November 30, 2003 | journal=[[The Boston Globe]] | accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref>

Construction was completed on an additional runway, 14/32, which officially opened to air traffic on November 23, 2006. Runway 14/32 was Logan's first major runway addition in more than forty years. This runway was first proposed in 1973, but had been delayed by court action.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/11/19/judge_allows_long_fought_runway_at_logan/ | title=Judge allows long-fought runway at Logan | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | author=Michael S. Rosenwald and Sean P. Murphy | date=November 19, 2003 | accessdate=July 28, 2006}}</ref>

In April 2007 the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] approved construction of a center field [[taxiway]] long-sought by Massport to alleviate congestion. The {{convert|9300|ft|m|-1|sing=on}} taxiway is between, and parallel to, Runways 4R/22L and 4L/22R. News of the project angered Logan's neighboring residents.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/08/13/taxiway_plan_upsets_neighbors/ |title=Taxiway plan upsets neighbors | author=Rhone, Paysha Stockton | work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=August 13, 2006 | accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref> In 2009 the new taxiway opened ahead of schedule and under budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/airports/environmental/records_decision/media/rod_boston_2007.pdf |title=FAA: Environmental Impact Statement <U+2013> Airside Improvements Planning Project <U+2013> Centerfield Taxiway | publisher=Federal Aviation Administration | date=April 20, 2007 | format=PDF |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref> To ensure the taxiway is not mistaken for a runway "TAXI" is written in large yellow letters at each end.

[[Instrument landing system|ILS]] is available for runways 4R, 15R, 22L, 27, and 33L, with runway 4R being certified for CAT III Instrument Landing operations. The other runways with ILS are certified for CAT I Instrument Landing operations.<ref name="AirNav">{{cite web | url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/KBOS | title=KBOS: General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport | work=FAA Information | publisher=Airnav.com | date=September 23, 2010 | accessdate=October 16, 2010}}</ref> [[Engineered materials arrestor system|EMAS]] pads are located at the starting thresholds of runways 22R and 33L.<ref name="FAA diagram">FAA Airport Diagram.</ref>

The distinctive central control tower, nearly a dozen stories high, is a local landmark with its pair of segmented elliptical pylons and a six-story platform trussed between them.

Logan Airport has two cargo facilities: North Cargo is adjacent to Terminal E and South Cargo adjacent to Terminals A and B.<ref name="FAA diagram" /> North Cargo is also the location of several maintenance [[hangar]]s, including those operated by American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.

===Runway 14/32===
Runway 14-32, which officially opened to air traffic on November 23, 2006, is unidirectional. Runway 32 is used for landings and 14 is used for takeoffs. Massport is barred by a court order from using the runway for overland landings or takeoffs, except in emergencies. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[Image:Loganairportwithplane.JPG|thumb|right|Logan International Airport with an [[Air Canada Jazz]] aircraft taking off over the harbor]]
There was fierce opposition to the construction of 14-32 among communities adjacent to the northwest side of the airport, such as Chelsea and East Boston, as authorities acknowledged that these areas would likely see a slight increase in noise levels. However, residents of Winthrop and [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] also joined in opposition, even though Massport had promised that the new traffic patterns allowed by 14-32 would reduce overflights of those areas.

Since the opening of the new runway, there has been disagreement about when, and how often, the new runway should be operational. Residents have demanded a minimum of {{convert|11.5|kn|km/h|adj=on}} northwest winds, slightly higher than the {{convert|10|kn|km/h|adj=on}} threshold favored by Massport.

The new runway reduces the need for the existing Runway 15L-33R, which, at only {{convert|2557|ft|m|0}} is among the shortest hard-surface runways at major airports in the United States. In 1988, Massport had proposed an {{convert|800|ft|m|-1|sing=on}} extension to this airstrip (a project which would have required additional filling-in of land along a clam bed), but was thwarted by a court injunction.<ref name="Airport Technology">{{cite web | url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/boston-logan/ | title=Logan International Airport Expansion, Boston, Massachusetts, USA | work=airport-technology.com | year=2010 | accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

Boston's [[Hyatt]] Harborside Hotel, which sits only a few hundred yards from the runway threshold, was built primarily to prevent Massport from ever extending the length of 14-32 or using it for takeoffs or landings over the city. Massachusetts state legislators carefully chose the location of the hotel<U+2014>directly in the runway centerline<U+2014>prior to its construction in 1992.<ref>{{Cite news| author=Howe, Peter J. | url=http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2006/11/19/the_30_year_saga_of_1432/ | title=The 30-year saga of 14/32 | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=November 19, 2006 | accessdate=October 26, 2007}}</ref>

According to Massport records, the very first aircraft to use the new airstrip was a [[Continental Express]] [[ERJ-145]] [[regional jet]] landing on Runway 32, on the morning of December 2, 2006.

===FBOs===
The airport is served by several [[Fixed Base Operator]]s (FBO), which handle fueling, ground handling, aircraft cleaning, cargo service, and aircraft maintenance. They include [[Swissport|Swissport USA]] and [[Penauille Servisair]]. General aviation, which is adjacent to the North Cargo area, is handled by Signature Flight Support.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.signatureflight.com/Locations/Pages/fbo.aspx?Loc=BOS | title = Signature at BOS | publisher = Signature Flight Support | year = 2010 | accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

===Public safety===
Police services are provided by the [[Massachusetts State Police]] Troop F.

===Terminal A===
[[Image:Terminal A, Logan International Airport, Boston.jpg|thumb|left|Terminal A]]
Terminal A, which replaced a 1970s-era building designed by [[Minoru Yamasaki]] once occupied by the now-defunct [[Eastern Airlines]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.atca.org/singlenews.asp?item_ID=2569&comm=0 | title = Smooth Takeoff for Terminal A | author = Reed, Keith | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | date = March 17, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-03-07 |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20061008080426/http://www.atca.org/singlenews.asp?item_ID=2569&comm=0 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-08}}</ref> opened to passengers on March 16, 2005. The terminal is divided into a main terminal (housing gates A1-A12) and a satellite building (housing gates A13-A22). The main terminal and the satellite building are connected through an underground walkway.<ref name="Logan Map">{{cite web | url=http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/inside-airport/Pages/logan-interactive-maps.html | title=Boston Logan International Airport Interactive Terminal Map | publisher=Massport | year=2010 | accessdate=October 16, 2010}}</ref> Terminal A houses airline lounges for [[United Airlines]] ([[United Club]])<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.continental.com/web/en-us/content/travel/airport/lounge/locations/all.aspx?SID=0B3C20E5F2A1495D9CFD651F5DDDABC1 | title=All Lounge Locations | publisher=Continental Airlines | year=2010 |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref> and Delta Air Lines ([[Delta Air Lines#Sky Clubs|Delta Sky Club]]).

The building is the first airport terminal in the United States to be [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified for environmentally friendly design by the U.S. Green Building Council. Among the building's features are heat-reflecting roof and windows, low-flow faucets and [[urinal (restroom)#Waterless urinals|waterless urinals]], self-dimming lights, and storm water filtration.<ref name="Airport Technology" />

===Terminal B===
[[Image:Terminal B, Logan International Airport, Boston.jpg|thumb|Terminal B]]
Terminal B is split into north and south buildings, with a parking garage located between the two buildings. The gates of the south building (primarily occupied by US Airways and housing a [[US Airways Club]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usairways.com/awa/content/traveltools/club/locations.aspx#bos | title=US Airways Club Locations |publisher=US Airways | year=2010 | accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref>) are divided into three groups: B1-B3, B4-B14, and B15-B21. Gates B4-14 and B15-B21 are connected by a walkway post-security.

===Terminal C===
[[Image:Terminal C, Logan International Airport, Boston.jpg|thumb|left|Terminal C]]
Terminal C has three groups of gates: C11-C21, C25-C36, and C40-C42.<ref name="Logan Map" /> The two Terminal C security checkpoints providing access to Gates C11 through C21 on the left and Gates C25 to C36 on the right were replaced by a common checkpoint on July 28, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.massport.com/news-room/News/TerminalCCheckpointOpensandEasesPassengerConnections.aspx | title=Terminal C Checkpoint Opens and Eases Passenger Connections | publisher=Massport |date=July 28, 2011 | accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref> The Terminal D gates (the three gates at the north end of Terminal C) were renumbered and labeled as part of Terminal C on February 28, 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2006/02/attention_logan.html | title =Attention Logan passengers: starting Wed. no more Terminal D | author = Howe, Peter | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date =February 28, 2006 | accessdate =November 2, 2006}}</ref> The terminal services for [[Cape Air]], [[Sun Country Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], and mainly for [[Jetblue Airways]].

The airport's [[United Service Organizations|USO]] Lounge is located in the baggage claim area of Terminal C, lower level. It offers most typical amenities as other markets as major as [[Greater Boston]]. Military ID is mandatory. Terminal C also houses a [[United Club]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.united.com/page/article/0,1360,50329,00.html | title=United Airlines <U+2013> Boston | publisher=United Air Lines |year=2010 | accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

===Terminal E (Volpe International Terminal)===
[[Image:Terminal E, Logan International Airport, Boston.jpg|thumb|Terminal E]]
Terminal E, also known as the [[John A.

Unlike the other terminals, where each terminal's upper level is used for departures while the lower level is used for arrivals, in Terminal E the third level is used for departures while the ground level is used for arrivals and [[customs]]. The second level is used for [[border control|passport control]].<ref name="Logan Wayfinder" /> The [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Federal Inspection Station]] (FIS) located in Terminal E is capable of processing over 2,000 passengers per hour.<ref name="Airport Technology" />

[[Image:Boston Logan International Airport Exit Express.jpg|thumb|Exit Express pay stations, allowing expedited exit from the parking garages by reducing lines at the toll plaza.]]

Boston Logan International Airport has the accolade of "Easiest Airport to Get To" in a 2007 article on aviation.com because of the variety of options to/from the airport.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20630299/ | author=Hobica, George | title=The top 10 easiest U.S. airports to get to | work=Aviation.com | publisher=[[msnbc.com]] | date=September 6, 2007 | accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref> These options include cars, taxis, the MBTA Blue and Silver lines, regional bus services, shared ride vans, limousines, and a service offered by few U.S. Airports, Logan Express. Logan is also {{convert|3|mi|km}} northeast of downtown Boston, a very short distance compared with airports in other cities.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Public transportation===
[[File:MBTA Blue Line Airport Subway Station.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Blue Line station, accessible by Massport shuttle buses.]]
Massport's Logan Express bus service also serves the areas of [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]], and the [[Anderson Regional Transportation Center]] in [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] for an adult fare of $12.00 one-way and $22.00 round-trip per passenger. Logan Express operates on the lower level curb of all terminals.

The MBTA operates a water shuttle connecting Logan with downtown Boston, [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]]. On demand service from the airport to various locations on the downtown waterfront is provided by a fleet of [[water taxi]]s. A free shuttle bus ferries passengers between the airport dock and the various terminals.

The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]]'s [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] SL1 [[bus rapid transit]] service connects [[South Station]], a major [[MBTA Commuter Rail]], [[Amtrak]], [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] [[Rapid transit|subway]] and bus transportation hub in the downtown Boston financial district, with all Logan terminals. Silverline bus tickets are sold in every terminal building to the far right of the lower level. There is also an [[Airport Station (MBTA)|Airport stop]] on the MBTA's [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] subway service. The Blue Line stop is not in the airport terminal itself; free shuttle buses 55, 22, and 33 provided by Massport bring passengers from the train station to the terminal buildings.

{{end}}

===Commercial transportation===
[[Limousine]] pickup is also very common at the airport. Limousine drivers are not allowed to leave their vehicles at the designated pickup areas and pickup locations vary depending on the terminal. For Terminal A, the pickup location is on the arrival level, outside baggage claim, in a small parking lot across the road. At Terminal E, pickup is also on the arrival level in a small parking lot across the outermost curb. For Terminal B (both American Airlines and US Airways sides), pickup is at the curbside on the departure level at the outermost curb area. At Terminal C, pickup is also on the departure level at the second and third islands from the building.

[[Taxicab|Taxi]] operations are coordinated at each terminal by Massport. Massport's regulations have reduced the number of taxis allowed to wait in front of the terminal at any one time, and prohibit taxis from picking up fares at any location other than the designated [[taxi stand]]s located at each terminal on the lower level curbs on the far left outside of baggage claim. A large staging area near the South Cargo complex serves as the waiting area for taxis, before they are called to the taxi stands to replenish the supply. Metered-rates from Logan to the Boston-area hotels range from approximately $25.00 to $50.00. The airport fee for trips leaving the airport is $2.25. Additionally, the city of Boston charges a $2.75 fee for trips to Logan Airport.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/police/hackney/taxi_rates.asp | title=Taxi Rates | publisher=City of Boston | year=2010 | accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

===Roads===
[[Image:Boston Logan International Airport Cell Phone Waiting Lot.jpg|thumb|Cell Phone Waiting Lot on Harborside Dr.]]
By public roads, the airport is accessible via Exit 26 on I-90 near the eastern terminus of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] of which I-90 ends at and transitions to [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] to Lynn and [[New Hampshire]], which provides easy access from the west via the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]]. From the south, travellers on [[Interstate 93]] can connect to the Masspike east, through the Ted Williams Tunnel and take exit 26 to reach the airport. From the north, I-93 traffic to the airport uses the [[Callahan Tunnel]], Route 1A North. From the [[North Shore (Massachusetts)|North Shore]], access is via Route 1A South. Additionally, road traffic from most of downtown Boston, [[Back Bay]] and [[Fenway]]/[[Boston University]] should use the Callahan Tunnel. The westbound twin tunnel to the Callahan Tunnel is known as the [[Sumner Tunnel]]. Eastbound travel through the tunnels is free, but there is a [[United States dollar|$]]3.50 toll for westbound travel, and a $5.25 toll for taxis, which passengers are responsible for.

Logan International Airport offers a 30-minute cell phone waiting lot area at the intersection of Hotel Dr. and Service Rd., which is complimentary and five minutes from all terminals by car. This convenience service exists to reduce congestion and pollution problems.

== Alternate airports ==
To address Logan Airport's overcrowding, Massport has designated two out-of-state airports as the second and third airports of Boston: [[Manchester-Boston Regional Airport]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], located approximately {{convert|44|smi|km}} north-northwest of Logan, which converts to an average drive time of 48 minutes via [[Interstate 93|I-93]]; and [[T. F. Green Airport]] in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]], located {{convert|63|smi|km}} south-southwest of Logan, averaging a 1 hour, 8 minute drive to Logan via [[Interstate 95|I-95]], or a 75-minute ride on commuter rail from [[South Station (Boston)|South Station)]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.massport.com/airports/faq.html#q5 | work=Massport | title=Regional Airports: FAQ | year=2008 | accessdate=March 25, 2008 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080221181456/http://www.massport.com/airports/faq.html | archivedate=February 21, 2008}}</ref> Massport does not operate these facilities.

[[Worcester Regional Airport]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], which is also operated by Massport, provides some scheduled airline service. Scheduled airline service also exists at [[Hanscom Field]] in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]], another facility operated by Massport.
