'''Chalcombe Road Halt''' was a railway station on the link line between the [[Great Central main line|Great Central Railway]] and the [[Great Western Railway]]'s [[Chiltern Main Line|Birmingham - London line]], leaving the Great Central at [[Culworth railway station|Culworth Junction]] to connect with [[Banbury railway station|Banbury Junction]]. The station, which served the nearby [[Northamptonshire]] village of [[Chacombe]], opened in 1911 and closed in 1956.

== History ==
In 1893, the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] (MS&LR) obtained [[Act of Parliament|Parliamentary approval]] for the extension of its line from [[Annesley]] in [[Nottingham]] to [[London]]. The final section of the extension saw the line connect with [[Metropolitan Railway]]'s line at [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]] before returning to MS&LR metals at [[Finchley Road tube station|Finchley Road]] and continuing to [[Marylebone railway station|Marylebone]]. Negotiations with the Metropolitan regarding running rights over its line came to deadlock prompting [[William Pollitt|Sir William Pollitt]], the MS&LR's general manager, to reach agreement with the Great Western Railway in March 1896 for a route to London via Banbury which would avoid the Metropolitan.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Dow, George | authorlink=George Dow | coauthors= | title=Great Central: Volume 2 Dominion of Watkin 1864-1899 | year=1962 | publisher=Ian Allan Limited | location=Shepperton, Surrey | isbn= | pages=288<U+2013>289}}</ref>

The link line, which ran for a distance of {{convert|8.25|mi|km}}, was opened without formality on 1 June 1900. The route had no intermediate stations but soon became an important freight route with 60,796 wagons exchanged between the MS&LR (now known as the [[Great Central Railway|Great Central]]) and the Great Western within the first six months of operation; by 1904 this figure had risen by 50%. Two passenger services each way were initially provided by the Great Western, with the Great Central later supplementing this service with three additional trains in each direction.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Dow, George | authorlink=George Dow | coauthors= | title=Great Central: Volume 3 Fay sets the pace 1900-1922 | year=1965 | publisher=[[Ian Allan]] | location=London | isbn=978-0-7110-0263-0 | pages=17<U+2013>18}}</ref> The link was subsequently used for cross-country services, including [[Aberdeen]] to [[Penzance]], [[Oxford]] to [[Leicester]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[Bournemouth]].<ref>[http://www.virgintrainsmediaroom.com/media/adobepdf/9%20CrossCountryE.pdf Virgin Trains Media, "Virgin Trains offers Aberdeen to Penzance from just 4p a mile", 12 August 2003.]</ref>

The line crossed the [[Northamptonshire]]<U+2013>[[Oxfordshire]] county boundary five times between {{stnlnk|Eydon Road Halt}} and {{stnlnk|Banbury}}; at its closest approach to Chacombe, it was on the Oxfordshire side of the boundary, within the parish of Cropredy.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=Ordnance Survey |title=Sheet 145 Banbury |year=1956 |scale=1" = 1 mile |series=One Inch Seventh Series |section=49 44 }}</ref> A small halt (situated between Chacombe and Coton Farm) was opened on 17 April 1911 and named Chalcombe Road Halt.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63799 'Parishes: Cropredy', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 10: Banbury hundred (1972), pp. 157-175.
