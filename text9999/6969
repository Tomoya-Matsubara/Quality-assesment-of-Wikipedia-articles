The '''Andean Condor''' (''Vultur gryphus'') is a species of South American bird in the [[New World vulture]] family [[Cathartidae]] and is the only member of the [[genus]] '''''Vultur'''''.  Found in the [[Andes]] mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, it is the largest flying land bird in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. 

It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], the male is larger than the female. 

The condor is primarily a [[scavenger]], feeding on [[carrion]]. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of [[deer]] or [[cattle]]. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and roosts at elevations of 3,000 to 5,000&nbsp;m (10,000 to 16,000&nbsp;ft), generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world<U+2019>s longest-living birds, with a lifespan of up to 50 years.

The Andean Condor is a  national symbol of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]], and plays an important role in the [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] of the [[South American]] Andean regions. The Andean Condor is considered [[Near Threatened|near threatened]] by the [[IUCN]]. It is threatened by habitat loss and by secondary poisoning from carcasses killed by hunters. [[Captive breeding]] programs have been instituted in several countries.

==Taxonomy==
The Andean Condor was described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the tenth edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and retains its original [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name of ''Vultur gryphus''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The exact [[taxonomic]] placement of the Andean Condor and the remaining six species of [[New World Vulture]]s remains unclear.<ref name="SACC"/> Though both are similar in appearance and have similar [[Ecological niche|ecological roles]], the New World and [[Old World Vultures]] evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world and are not closely related.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Andean Condor is found in [[South America]] in the [[Andes]]. In the north, its range begins in [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]], where it is extremely rare,<ref name="BirdLife"/> then continues south along the Andes in [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]], through [[Bolivia]] and western [[Argentina]] to the [[Tierra del Fuego]].<ref name ="Blake"/> In the early nineteenth century, the Andean Condor bred from western Venezuela to Tierra del Fuego, along the entire chain of the Andes, but its range has been greatly reduced due to human activity.<ref name="Haemig "/> Its habitat is mainly composed of open grasslands and alpine areas up to 5,000&nbsp;m (16,000&nbsp;ft) in elevation. It prefers relatively open, non-forested areas which allow it to spot carrion from the air, such as the [[p<U+00E1>ramo]] or rocky, mountainous areas in general.<ref>{{cite web

In response to the capture of all the wild individuals of the closely related [[California Condor]], in 1988 the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean Condors into the wild in [[California]]. Only females were released to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a [[South America]]n species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean Condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California Condors took place.<ref name="USFW">{{cite web | title = California condor, (Gymnogyps californianus) | publisher= U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| url = http://www.fws.gov/species/species_accounts/bio_cond.html| accessdate = 2007-08-14}}</ref>
