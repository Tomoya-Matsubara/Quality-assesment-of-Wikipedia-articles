'''Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] ([[19 April]] [[1909]] &ndash; [[15 February]] [[1974]]) was a British [[cryptanalyst]], [[chess]] player, and chess writer. He worked on the German [[Enigma machine]] at [[Bletchley Park]] during World War II, and was later the head of the cryptanalysis division at [[GCHQ]] for over 20 years. In chess, he was twice [[British chess champion]] and earned the title of [[International Master]].  He was usually referred to as '''C. H. O'D. Alexander''' in print and '''Hugh''' in person.

==Early life and education==
Hugh Alexander was born on [[19 April]] 1909 in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Ireland]], the eldest child of Conel William Long Alexander, an [[engineering]] professor at [[University College, Cork]], and Hilda Barbara Bennett.<ref name="odnb">Harry Golombek, revised by Ralph Erskine, "Alexander, (Conel) Hugh O'Donel (1909-1974), chess player and cryptanalyst" in the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], 2004</ref> His father died in 1920, and the family moved to [[Birmingham]] in [[England]] where he attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]].<ref name="odnb"/> He won a scholarship to study [[mathematics]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]] in 1928, graduating with a first in 1931.<ref name="odnb"/>

From 1932, he taught mathematics in [[Winchester]], and married Enid Constance Crichton on [[22 December]] 1934.<ref name="odnb"/> In 1938 he left teaching and became head of research at the [[John Lewis Partnership]].<ref name="odnb"/>

==Bletchley Park and GCHQ==

In February [[1940]] Alexander arrived at [[Bletchley Park]], the British codebreaking centre during World War II. He joined [[Hut 6]], the section tasked with breaking German Army and Air Force [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] messages. In [[1941]], he transferred to [[Hut 8]], the corresponding hut working on Naval Enigma. He became deputy head of Hut 8 under [[Alan Turing]]. Alexander was more involved with the day-to-day operations of the hut than Turing, and, while Turing was visiting the United States, Alexander formally became the head of Hut 8 around November 1942.

In October [[1944]], Alexander was transferred to work on the Japanese [[JN-25]] code.

In mid-[[1946]], Alexander joined [[GCHQ]], which was the post-war successor organisation to the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS) at Bletchley Park. By [[1949]], he had been promoted to the head of "Section H" ([[cryptanalysis]]), a post he retained until his retirement in [[1971]].

==Chess career==
He represented [[Cambridge University]] in the Varsity chess matches of 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932 ( he studied at [[King's College, Cambridge]]).
He was twice a winner of the [[British Chess Championship]], in 1938 and 1956.
He represented England in the [[Chess Olympiad]] six times, in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1939, 1954, and 1958. He was also the non-playing captain of England from 1964 to 1970. He was awarded the [[International Master]] title in 1950 and the International Master for Correspondence Chess title in 1970. His best tournament result was first equal (with [[David Bronstein]]) at  [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings Premier]] 1953/54 where he defeated Soviet grandmasters [[David Bronstein]] and [[Alexander Tolush]] in individual games. Alexander's opportunities to appear abroad were limited; as he was not allowed to play chess in the [[Soviet bloc]] because of his secret work in cryptography.<ref name="Hooper&Whyld">{{citation
