'''Heavy metal''' (often referred to simply as '''metal''') is a subgenre of [[rock music]]<ref>Du Noyer (2003), p. 96; Weinstein (2000), pp. 11<U+2013>13.</ref> that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 14</ref> With roots in [[blues-rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]], the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.

Early bands, such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Deep Purple]], attracted large audiences. These bands are widely considered main founders of the genre. However, they were often critically reviled; this was a status common throughout the history of the genre. In the mid-1970s [[Judas Priest]] helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its [[blues]] influence; [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]] introduced a [[punk rock]] sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Bands in the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] such as [[Iron Maiden]] followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal had attracted a worldwide following of fans known as "[[metalhead]]s" or "[[headbanging|headbangers]]".

In the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became a major commercial force with groups like [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]] and [[Twisted Sister]]. [[Underground music|Underground scenes]] produced an array of more extreme, aggressive styles: [[thrash metal]] broke into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]] and [[Megadeth]], while other styles like [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] remain [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles such as [[nu metal]], which often incorporates elements of [[grunge]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]; and [[metalcore]], which blends [[extreme metal]] with [[hardcore punk]], have further expanded the definition of the genre.

== Characteristics ==
Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals. Metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes. ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Jon Pareles]] writes, "In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock<U+2014>the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force."<ref name="JP">Pareles, Jon. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DB113DF933A25754C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all "Heavy Metal, Weighty Words"] ''The New York Times'', July 10, 1988. Retrieved on November 14, 2007. {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> The typical band lineup includes a [[drummer]], a [[bass guitar|bassist]], a [[rhythm guitar]]ist, a [[lead guitar]]ist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. [[Keyboard instruments]] are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound,<ref name="W25">Weinstein (2000), p. 25</ref> but rarely are other instruments incorporated.

[[File:Judas Priest Retribution 2005 Tour.jpg|thumb|[[Judas Priest]], performing in 2005]]
The [[electric guitar]] and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.<ref name="W23">Weinstein (2000), p. 23</ref> The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional "frontman" or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two "contend for dominance" in a spirit of "affectionate rivalry".<ref name="W25"/> Heavy metal "demands the subordination of the voice" to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an "explicit display of emotion" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 26</ref> Critic [[Simon Frith]] claims that the metal singer's "tone of voice" is more important than the lyrics.<ref>Cited in Weinstein (2000), p. 26</ref> Metal vocals vary widely in style, from the multioctave, theatrical approach of Judas Priest's [[Rob Halford]] and Iron Maiden's [[Bruce Dickinson]], to the gruff style of [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]]'s [[Lemmy]] and [[Metallica]]'s [[James Hetfield]], to the [[death growl|growling]] of many [[death metal]] performers, and to the harsh screams of [[black metal]].

The prominent role of the bass is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music "heavy".<ref name="W24">Weinstein (2000), p. 24</ref> Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low [[pedal point]] as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and [[lick (music)|licks]] along with the lead and/or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's [[Cliff Burton]] in the early 1980s.<ref>[http://www.bassplayer.com/article/the-king-metal/Feb-05/164 "Cliff Burton's Legendary Career: The King of Metal Bass"] ''Bass Player'', February 2005. Retrieved on November 13, 2007.</ref>

The essence of metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the "trifecta of speed, power, and precision".<ref>Dawson, Michael. [http://www.moderndrummer.com/updatefull/200001503 "Chris Adler: More Than Meets The Eye"] ''Modern Drummer Online''. Retrieved on November 13, 2007.</ref> Metal drumming "requires an exceptional amount of endurance", and drummers have to develop "considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity...to play the intricate patterns" used in metal.<ref name="Berry">Berry and Gianni (2003), p. 85</ref> A characteristic metal drumming technique is the [[cymbal choke]], which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.<ref name="W24"/>

In live performance, [[loudness]]<U+2014>an "onslaught of sound," in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description<U+2014>is considered vital.<ref name="W23"/> In his book ''Metalheads'', psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as "the sensory equivalent of war."<ref>Arnett (1996), p. 14</ref> Following the lead set by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[The Who]], early heavy metal acts such as [[Blue Cheer]] set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's [[Dickie Peterson|Dick Peterson]] put it, "All we knew was we wanted more power."<ref name = "vdqxbw">Walser (1993), p. 9</ref> A 1977 review of a Mot<U+00F6>rhead concert noted how "excessive volume in particular figured into the band<U+2019>s impact."<ref>Paul Sutcliffe quoted in Waksman, Steve. [http://www.echo.ucla.edu/volume6-issue2/waksman/waksman3.html "Metal, Punk, and Mot<U+00F6>rhead: Generic Crossover in the Heart of the Punk Explosion".] ''Echo: A Music-Centered Journal'' 6.2 (Fall 2004).  Retrieved on November 15, 2007</ref> Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that [[melody]] is the main element of [[Pop music|pop]] and rhythm is the main focus of [[house (music)|house]] music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to "sweep the listener into the sound" and to provide a "shot of youthful vitality."<ref name="W23"/>

=== Musical language ===
==== Rhythm and tempo ====
The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the "rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency."<ref name="W24"/> In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures<U+2014>generally made up of [[eighth note|8th]] or [[sixteenth note|16th notes]]. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a [[staccato]] attack created by using a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] technique on the rhythm guitar.<ref>"Master of Rhythm: The Importance of Tone and Right-hand Technique," ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 99</ref>
[[File:Heavy rythmic pattern.jpg|500px|thumb| An example of a rhythmic pattern used in heavy metal.]]
Brief, abrupt, and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called [[riff]]s, which help to establish thematic [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as [[whole note]]- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo [[power ballad]]s. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be "slow, even ponderous."<ref name="W24"/> By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 [[beats per minute]]) to extremely fast [[blast beat]] tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).<ref name="Berry"/>

==== Harmony ====
One of the signatures of the genre is the guitar [[power chord]].<ref>Walser (1993), p. 2</ref> In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main [[interval (music)|interval]], generally the [[perfect fifth]], though an [[octave]] may be added as a doubling of the [[Root (chord)|root]]. Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord,<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.melbay.com/guitarglossary.asp Glossary of Guitar Terms.] Mel Bay Publications. Retrieved on November 15, 2007</ref> power chords are also based on different intervals such as the [[minor third]], [[major third]], [[perfect fourth]], [[diminished fifth]], or [[minor sixth]].<ref>"Shaping Up and Riffing Out: Using Major and Minor Power Chords to Add Colour to Your Parts," ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 97</ref> Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the [[fingerboard|fretboard]].<ref>Schonbrun (2006), p. 22</ref>

==== Typical harmonic structures ====
Heavy metal is usually based on [[riff]]s created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of [[pedal point]]s. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] and [[Phrygian mode]]s.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 46</ref> Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-VI-VII, I-VII-(VI), or I-VI-IV-VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and <U+266D>II (I-<U+266D>II-I, I-<U+266D>II-III, or I-<U+266D>II-VII for example). Tense-sounding [[chromatic]] or [[tritone]] relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.<ref>Marshall, Wolf. "Power Lord<U+2014>Climbing Chords, Evil Tritones, Giant Callouses," ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 29</ref><ref name="MH">Dunn, Sam (2005). "[http://www.metalhistory.com/ Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]". Warner Home Video (2006). Retrieved on March 19, 2007</ref> The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones<U+2014>such as C and F#<U+2014>was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it ''diabolus in musica''<U+2014>"the devil in music."<ref>The first explicit prohibition of that interval seems to occur with the "development of [[Guido of Arezzo]]'s [[hexachord]]al system which made B flat a [[diatonic]] note, namely as the 4th degree of the hexachordal on F. From then until the end of Renaissance the tritone, nicknamed the 'diabolus in musica', was regarded as an unstable interval and rejected as a consonance" (Sadie, Stanley [1980]. "Tritone", in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 1st ed. MacMillan, pp. 154<U+2013>5. ISBN 0-333-23111-2. See also Arnold, Denis [1983]. "Tritone", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-311316-3). During the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] eras, the interval came to be accepted, though in a specific, controlled way. It is only during the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] and in [[20th century classical music|modern classical music]] that composers have used it freely, exploiting the evil connotations with which it is culturally associated.</ref> Because of that original symbolic association, it came to be heard in Western cultural convention as "evil". Heavy metal has made extensive use of the tritone in guitar solos and riffs, such as in the beginning of "[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]".

Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of [[pedal point]] as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.<ref>Kennedy (1985), "Pedal Point," p. 540</ref>

==== Relationship with classical music ====

[[Robert Walser (musicologist)|Robert Walser]] argues that, alongside blues and R&B, the "assemblage of disparate musical styles known...as 'classical music'" has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days. He claims that metal's "most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal."<ref>Walser (1993), p. 58</ref> The Grove Music Online states that the "1980s brought on ...the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially [[J.S. Bach|Bach]] and [[Vivaldi]], by influential guitarists such as [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]".<ref>Walser, Robert. "Heavy metal". ''Grove Music Online''. Accessed March 6, 2010.http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_gmo (subscription required for access)</ref>

Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices<U+2014>classical in the [[art music]] tradition, metal in the [[popular music]] tradition. As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, "Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions.' An example is Walser<U+2019>s linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from 'art music.'"<ref>See Cook and Dibben (2001), p. 56</ref>

=== Lyrical themes ===
Black Sabbath and the many metal bands they inspired have concentrated lyrically "on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music," according to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward. They take as an example Sabbath's 1970 album ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'', which "included songs dealing with personal trauma<U+2014>'[[Paranoid (song)|Paranoid]]' and '[[Fairies Wear Boots]]' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)<U+2014>as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory '[[War Pigs (song)|War Pigs]]' and '[[Hand of Doom (song)|Hand of Doom]].'"<ref>Hatch and Millward (1989), p. 167</ref> Nuclear annihilation was addressed in later metal songs such as Iron Maiden's "[[2 Minutes to Midnight]]", [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s "Killer of Giants", Megadeth`s "Polaris", and [[Metallica]]'s "Fight Fire With Fire". Death is a predominant theme in heavy metal, routinely featuring in the lyrics of bands as otherwise widely different as [[Slayer]] and [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] The more extreme forms of death metal and grindcore tend to have aggressive and gory lyrics.

Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic<U+2014>a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam and nu metal bands.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 36</ref> Romantic tragedy is a standard theme of gothic and doom metal, as well as of nu metal, where teenage angst is another central topic. Heavy metal songs often feature outlandish, fantasy-inspired lyrics, lending them an escapist quality. Iron Maiden's songs, for instance, were frequently inspired by mythology, fiction, and poetry, such as Iron Maiden's "[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner (song)|Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]", based on the [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] [[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poem]]. Led Zeppelin lyrics often reference [[Lord of the Rings]] as well as other mythology and folklore, such as in the songs "[[The Battle of Evermore]]", "[[Immigrant Song]]", "[[Ramble On]]", "[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]", and "[[Achilles Last Stand]]". Other examples include Black Sabbath's "The Wizard," [[Megadeth]]'s "The Conjuring" and "Five Magics," and Judas Priest's "Dreamer Deceiver". Since the 1980s, with the rise of thrash metal and songs such as Metallica's "[[...And Justice for All (song)|...And Justice for All]]" and Megadeth's "[[Peace Sells]]", more metal lyrics have included sociopolitical commentary. Genres such as melodic death metal, progressive metal, and black metal often explore philosophical themes.

The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, "Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates...a party without limits.... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic."<ref name="JP"/> Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of [[misogyny]] and the occult. During the 1980s, the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement "do it" in a Priest song. While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed.<ref>See, e.g., Ewing and McCann (2006), pp. 104<U+2013>113</ref> In some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values. In countries including Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated.<ref>{{cite web|author=Whitaker, Brian|date=June 2, 2003| title = Highway to Hell| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/02/worlddispatch.brianwhitaker|work=Guardian| accessdate = 2009-03-03 }} {{cite web|date=August 4, 2001| title = Malaysia Curbs Heavy Metal Music| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1473198.stm|publisher=BBC News| accessdate = 2009-03-03 | location=London}}</ref>

=== Image and fashion ===
{{Main|heavy metal fashion}}
[[File:KISS in concert Boston 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] performing in 2004, wearing their famous makeup]]
As with much popular music, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's "image" is expressed in album sleeve art, logos, stage sets, clothing, and [[music video]]s.<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 27</ref> Some heavy metal acts such as [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and [[Gwar]] have become known as much for their outrageous performance personas and stage shows as for their music.

Down-the-back long hair, according to Weinstein, is the "most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion."<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 129</ref> Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair "symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home," according to journalist Nader Rahman. Long hair gave members of the metal community "the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general."<ref>Rahman, Nader. [http://www.thedailystar.net/magazine/2006/07/04/musings.htm "Hair Today Gone Tomorrow"]. ''Star Weekend Magazine'', July 28, 2006. Retrieved on November 20, 2007.</ref>

The classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of "blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots and black leather or jeans jackets.... T-shirts are generally emblazoned with the logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands."<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 127</ref> Metal fans also "appropriated elements from the S&M community (chains, metal studs, skulls, leather and crosses)." In the 1980s, a range of sources, from punk and [[goth]] music to horror films, influenced metal fashion.<ref name="Umelec">Pospiszyl, Tom<U+00E1><U+0161>.

Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname, "hair metal"); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather, or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry.<ref>Thompson (2007), p. 135; Blush, Steven.

Many metal musicians when performing live engage in [[headbanging]], which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair. The [[corna]], or devil horns, hand gesture, also widespread, was popularized by vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] while with Black Sabbath and [[Dio (band)|Dio]].<ref name="MH"/> [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] claims to have been the first to make the gesture in concert.<ref>Appleford, Steve.

Attendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense; Deena Weinstein has argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and "extreme heterosexualist ideology." She identifies two primary body movements that substitute for dancing: headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture.<ref>Weinstein, p. 130</ref> The performance of [[air guitar]] is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home.<ref>Weinstein, p. 95</ref> Other concert audience activities include [[stage diving]], [[crowd surfing]], pushing and shoving in a chaotic m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e called [[moshing]], and displaying the corna hand symbol.

=== Fan subculture ===
{{Main|Metalhead}}

Deena Weinstein argues that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary, strongly masculine subculture.<ref>Weinstein, pp. 103, 7, 8, 104</ref> While the metal fanbase is largely young, white, male, and blue-collar, the group is "tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior."<ref>Weinstein, pp. 102, 112</ref> Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the shared experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites.<ref>Weinstein, pp. 181, 207, 294</ref>

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term ''heavy metal'' in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy. An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by [[counterculture|countercultural]] writer [[William S. Burroughs]]. His 1962 novel ''[[The Soft Machine]]'' includes a character known as "Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid." Burroughs's next novel, ''[[Nova Express]]'' (1964), develops the theme, using ''heavy metal'' as a metaphor for addictive drugs: "With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms<U+2014>Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes<U+2014>And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music."<ref>[[William S. Burroughs|Burroughs, William S]]. "[http://www.efn.org/~dredmond/PP3.html Nova Express]". New York: Grove Press, 1964. Pg. 112</ref>

Metal historian [[Ian Christe]] describes what the components of the term mean in "hippiespeak": "heavy" is roughly synonymous with "potent" or "profound," and "metal" designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 10</ref> The word "heavy" in this sense was a basic element of [[beatnik]] and later countercultural [[slang]], and references to "heavy music"<U+2014>typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare<U+2014>were already common by the mid-1960s. [[Iron Butterfly]]'s debut album, released in early 1968, was titled ''[[Heavy (album)|Heavy]]''. The first recorded use of ''heavy metal'' is a reference to a motorcycle in the [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] song "[[Born to Be Wild]]", also released that year:<ref>Walser (1993), p. 8</ref> "I like smoke and lightning/Heavy metal thunder/Racin' with the wind/And the feelin' that I'm under." A late, and disputed, claim about the source of the term was made by [[Chas Chandler|"Chas" Chandler]], former manager of the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]]. In a 1995 interview on the [[PBS]] program ''Rock and Roll'', he asserted that heavy metal "was a term originated in a ''New York Times'' article reviewing a [[Jimi Hendrix]] performance," in which the author likened the event to "listening to heavy metal falling from the sky." A source for Chandler's claim has never been found.

The first documented use of the phrase to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by [[Barry Gifford]]. In the May 11, 1968, issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he wrote about the album ''[[A Long Time Comin']]'' by U.S. band [[Electric Flag]]: "Nobody who's been listening to [[Mike Bloomfield]]<U+2014>either talking or playing<U+2014>in the last few years could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock."<ref>Gifford, Barry. ''Rolling Stone'', May 11, 1968, p. 20.</ref> Other early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic [[Mike Saunders]]. In the November 12, 1970, issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]: "''[[As Safe As Yesterday Is|Safe As Yesterday Is]],'' their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There were a couple of nice songs...and one monumental pile of refuse." He described the band's latest, [[Humble Pie (album)|self-titled release]] as "more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap."<ref>{{cite web|title=Humble Pie: "Town and Country" (review)|author=Saunders, Mike|work=Rolling Stone|date=1970-11-12|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/158628/review/5944670/town_and_country | accessdate=2007-12-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071130055912/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/158628/review/5944670/town_and_country |archivedate = November 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In a review of [[Sir Lord Baltimore]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (Sir Lord Baltimore album)|Kingdom Come]]'' in the May 1971 ''[[Creem]]'', Saunders wrote, "Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book."<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Lord Baltimore's "Kingdom Come" (review)|author=Saunders, Mike|work=Creem|month=May | year=1971|url=http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/SirLordBaltimore/KingdomCome001.html | accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> ''Creem'' critic [[Lester Bangs]] is credited with popularizing the term via his early 1970s essays on bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 19</ref> Through the decade, ''heavy metal'' was used by certain critics as a virtually automatic putdown. In 1979, lead ''New York Times'' popular music critic [[John Rockwell]] described what he called "heavy-metal rock" as "brutally aggressive music played mostly for minds clouded by drugs,"<ref>Rockwell, John. ''New York Times'', February 4, 1979, p. D22</ref> and, in a different article, as "a crude exaggeration of rock basics that appeals to white teenagers."<ref>Rockwell, John. ''New York Times'', August 13, 1979, p. C16</ref>

Coined by [[Black Sabbath]] drummer, [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]], "downer rock" was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to such acts as Sabbath and [[Bloodrock]]. [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of [[Quaaludes]] and the drinking of wine.<ref>{{Cite news |title=The Lost Pioneers of Heavy Metal |last=Sleazegrinder |magazine=Classic Rock |date=March 2007}}</ref> Later the term would be replaced by "heavy metal."<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FYjcoflzB_sC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22downer+rock%22+-genocide&source=bl&ots=yb_o7mXadU&sig=232u4XSsTxOb7txUDO7MckEX7NE&hl=en&ei=5Jr2SoutI8vU4Qam5pHRAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CA4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22downer%20rock%22%20-genocide&f=false] ''Progressive Rock Reconsidered'' by Denna Weinstein</ref>

The terms "heavy metal" and "[[hard rock]]" have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous.<ref>Du Noyer (2003), pp. 96, 78</ref> For example, the 1983 ''Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' includes this passage: "known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, [[Aerosmith]] was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies."<ref>Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 4</ref>

== History ==
=== Antecedents: mid-1960s ===
While heavy metal's quintessential guitar style, built around distortion-heavy riffs and power chords, traces its roots to the late 1950s instrumentals of American [[Link Wray]],<ref>Strong (2004), p. 1693; Buckley (2003), p. 1187</ref> the genre's direct lineage begins in the mid-1960s. American [[blues music]] was a major influence on the early British rockers of the era. Bands like [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[The Yardbirds]] developed [[blues-rock]] by recording covers of many classic blues songs, often speeding up the [[tempo]]s. As they experimented with the music, the UK blues-based bands<U+2014>and the U.S. acts they influenced in turn<U+2014>developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal, in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound.<ref name = "vdqxbw"/> [[The Kinks]] played a major role in popularizing this sound with their 1964 hits "[[You Really Got Me]]"<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 18; Walser (1993), p. 9</ref> and "[[All Day And All Of The Night]]".  A significant contributor to the emerging guitar sound was the [[feedback]] facilitated by the new generation of amplifiers.

In addition to The Kinks' [[Dave Davies]], other guitarists such as [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] and the Tridents' [[Jeff Beck]] were experimenting with feedback.<ref>Wilkerson (2006), p. 19.</ref> Where the blues-rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex, and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar.<ref name = "eyaqji">Walser (1993), p. 10</ref> Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic. In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, The Who's "bigger-louder-wall-of-[[Marshall Amplification#Marshall Stack|Marshalls]]" approach was seminal.<ref>McMichael (2004), p. 112</ref> Simultaneous advances in amplification and recording technology made it possible to successfully capture the power of this heavier approach on record.

The combination of blues-rock with psychedelic rock formed much of the original basis for heavy metal.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 16</ref> One of the most influential bands in forging the merger of genres was the British power trio [[Cream (band)|Cream]], who derived a massive, heavy sound from [[unison]] riffing between guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] and bassist [[Jack Bruce]], as well as [[Ginger Baker]]'s double bass drumming.<ref>Charlton (2003), pp. 232<U+2013>33</ref> Their first two LPs, ''[[Fresh Cream]]'' (1966) and ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' (1967), are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style. [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s debut album, ''[[Are You Experienced (album)|Are You Experienced]]'' (1967), was also highly influential. [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]]'s virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists and the album's most successful single, "[[Purple Haze]]", is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit.<ref name = "vdqxbw"/> [[Vanilla Fudge]], whose [[Vanilla Fudge (album)|first album]] also came out in 1967, have been called "one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal."<ref>{{cite web | author=Huey, Steve| title=Vanilla Fudge (Biography) | publisher = Allmusic | url=http://www.allmusicguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hifrxqr5ldde| accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref>

=== Origins: late 1960s and early 1970s ===
{{also|Traditional Heavy Metal}}
In 1968, the sound that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce. That January, the San Francisco band [[Blue Cheer]] released a cover of [[Eddie Cochran]]'s classic "[[Summertime Blues]]", from their debut album ''[[Vincebus Eruptum]]'', that many consider the first true heavy metal recording.<ref>McCleary (2004), pp. 240, 506.</ref> The same month, [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] released its [[Steppenwolf (album)|self-titled debut album]], including "[[Born to Be Wild]]", which refers to "heavy metal thunder" in the lyrics. In July, another two epochal records came out: The Yardbirds' "Think About It"<U+2014>B-side of the band's last single<U+2014>with a performance by guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] anticipating the metal sound he would soon make famous; and [[Iron Butterfly]]'s ''[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (album)|In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]'', with its 17-minute-long [[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (song)|title track]], a prime candidate for first-ever heavy metal album. In August, [[The Beatles]]' single version of "[[Revolution (song)|Revolution]]", with its redlined guitar and drum sound, set new standards for distortion in a top-selling context.

The [[Jeff Beck Group]], whose leader had preceded Page as The Yardbirds' guitarist, released its debut record that same month: ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' featured some of the "most molten, barbed, downright funny noises of all time," breaking ground for generations of metal ax-slingers.<ref>Gene Santoro, quoted in Carson (2001), p. 86.</ref> In October, Page's new band, [[Led Zeppelin]], made its live debut. The Beatles' so-called ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'', which also came out that month, included "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]", then one of the heaviest-sounding songs ever released by a major band.<ref>Blake (1997), p. 143</ref> [[The Pretty Things]]' [[rock opera]] ''[[S.F. Sorrow]]'', released in December, featured "proto heavy metal" songs such as "Old Man Going."<ref>{{cite web|author=Strauss, Neil | title=The Pop Life: The First Rock Opera (No, Not "Tommy")| work = New York Times | date=1998-09-03  | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E0D6133FF930A3575AC0A96E958260 | accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref>

[[File:ZepInParis.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Led Zeppelin]] performing in June 1969 for the French TV show ''Tous en sc<U+00E8>ne'']]
In January 1969, Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released and reached number 10 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' album chart. In July, Zeppelin and a power trio with a Cream-inspired, but cruder sound, [[Grand Funk Railroad]], played the [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1969)|Atlanta Pop Festival]]. That same month, another Cream-rooted trio led by [[Leslie West]] released ''Mountain'', an album filled with heavy blues-rock guitar and roaring vocals. In August, the group<U+2014>now itself dubbed [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]]<U+2014>played an hour-long set at the [[Woodstock Festival]].<ref>Though often identified now as "hard rock," the band's official debut album, ''Mountain Climbing'' (1970), placed 85th on the list of "Top 100 Metal Albums" compiled by ''[[Hit Parader]]'' in 1989. In November, [[Love Sculpture]], with guitarist [[Dave Edmunds]], put out  ''Forms And Feelings'', featuring a pounding, aggressive version of [[Khachaturian]]'s "[[Sabre Dance]]".Grand Funk Railroad's ''Survival'' (1971) placed 72nd (Walser [1993], p. 174).</ref> Grand Funk's debut album, ''[[On Time]]'', also came out that month. In the fall, ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' went to number 1 and the album's single "[[Whole Lotta Love]]" hit number 4 on the ''Billboard'' pop chart. The metal revolution was under way.

Led Zeppelin defined central aspects of the emerging genre, with Page's highly distorted guitar style and singer [[Robert Plant]]'s dramatic, wailing vocals.<ref>Charlton (2003), p. 239</ref> Other bands, with a more consistently heavy, "purely" metal sound, would prove equally important in codifying the genre. The 1970 releases by [[Black Sabbath]] (''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'' and ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'') and [[Deep Purple]] (''[[In Rock (Deep Purple album)|In Rock]]'') were crucial in this regard.<ref name = "eyaqji"/> Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to an industrial accident guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] suffered before cofounding the band. Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering.<ref>di Perna, Alan.

[[File:BlackSabbath19720012200.sized.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Tony Iommi]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]] of [[Black Sabbath]] onstage in January 1973]]
On the other side of the Atlantic, the trend-setting group was Grand Funk Railroad, "the most commercially successful American heavy-metal band from 1970 until they disbanded in 1976, [they] established the Seventies success formula: continuous touring."<ref>Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 225</ref> Other bands identified with metal emerged in the U.S., such as [[Dust (band)|Dust]] (first LP in 1971), [[Blue <U+00D6>yster Cult]] ([[Blue <U+00D6>yster Cult (album)|1972]]), and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] ([[Kiss (album)|1974]]). In Germany, [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] debuted with ''[[Lonesome Crow]]'' in 1972. Blackmore, who had emerged as a virtuoso soloist with Deep Purple's ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'' (1972), quit the group in 1975 to form [[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]]. These bands also built audiences via constant touring and increasingly elaborate stage shows.<ref name = "eyaqji"/> As described above, there are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as "heavy metal" or simply as "hard rock." Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. [[AC/DC]], which debuted with ''[[High Voltage (Australian album)|High Voltage]]'' in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 ''Rolling Stone'' encyclopedia entry begins, "Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC..."<ref>Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 1</ref> Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, "Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today.... [They] were a rock 'n' roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal."<ref>Walker (2001), p. 297</ref> The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band "became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition."<ref>Christe (2003), p. 54</ref>

In certain cases, there is little debate. After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's [[Judas Priest]], which debuted with ''[[Rocka Rolla]]'' in 1974. In Christe's description, Black Sabbath's
<blockquote>
audience was...left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of [[Thin Lizzy]], in the stagecraft of [[Alice Cooper]], in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow.... Judas Priest arrived to unify and amplify these diverse highlights from hard rock's sonic palette. For the first time, heavy metal became a true genre unto itself.<ref>Christe (2003), pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref>
</blockquote>
Though Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the U.S. until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a nonbluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 6</ref> While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not enamored of the music. Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice,<ref name = "gnwtey">Walser (1993), p. 11</ref> but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, leading critic [[Robert Christgau]] described it as "dull and decadent...dim-witted, amoral exploitation."<ref>Christgau (1981), p. 49</ref>

=== Mainstream: late 1970s and 1980s ===
[[File:Iron Maiden - bass and guitars 30nov2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Iron Maiden]], one of the central bands in the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]]]]
[[Punk rock]] emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal. Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, [[disco]], and more mainstream rock.<ref name = "gnwtey"/> With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and "[[Low fidelity|lo-fi]]", [[do it yourself]] ethos. Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.<ref>Christe (2003), pp. 30, 33</ref> [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]], founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide. With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed. British music papers such as the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' took notice, with ''Sounds'' writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the "[[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]]".<ref>Christe (2003), p. 33</ref> NWOBHM bands including [[Iron Maiden]], [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]], and [[Def Leppard]] reenergized the heavy metal genre. Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Mot<U+00F6>rhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements, and emphasized increasingly fast tempos.<ref>{{cite web|title="Judas Priest"|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas, and Greg Prato|publisher=Allmusic|date=|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=JUDAS|PRIEST&sql=11:kifrxqe5ldse~T1|accessdate=2007-04-30}} {{cite web|title="Genre<U+2014>New Wave of British Heavy Metal|author=|publisher=Allmusic|date=|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=77:7760|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> In 1980, the NWOBHM broke into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Mot<U+00F6>rhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, other NWOBHM bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Diamond Head (band)|Diamond Head]] would have a significant influence on metal's development.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 44</ref> In 1981, Mot<U+00F6>rhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]''.

The first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight. Deep Purple had broken up soon after Blackmore's departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin broke up following drummer [[John Bonham]]'s death in 1980. Black Sabbath was routinely upstaged in concert by its opening act, the [[Los Angeles]] band [[Van Halen]].<ref>Christe (2003), p. 25</ref> [[Eddie Van Halen]] established himself as one of the leading metal guitar virtuosos of the era<U+2014>his solo on "[[Eruption (song)|Eruption]]", from the band's [[Van Halen (album)|self-titled 1978 album]], is considered a milestone.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 51</ref> [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] also became famed virtuosos, associated with what would be known as the [[neoclassical metal]] style. The adoption of classical elements had been spearheaded by Blackmore and the Scorpions' [[Uli Jon Roth]]; this next generation progressed to occasionally using classical nylon-stringed guitars, as Rhoads does on "Dee" from former Sabbath lead singer [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s first solo album, ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]'' (1980).

In the wake of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and Judas Priest's breakthrough ''[[British Steel (album)|British Steel]]'' (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on [[MTV]], which began airing in 1981<U+2014>sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 79</ref> Def Leppard's videos for ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' (1983) made them superstars in America and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the ''Billboard'' chart with ''[[Metal Health]]'' (1983). One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 [[US Festival]] in California, where the "heavy metal day" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 45</ref> Between 1983 and 1984, heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 12</ref> Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including ''[[Kerrang!]]'' (in 1981) and ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' (in 1984), as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, ''Billboard'' declared, "Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers. The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female."<ref>Walser (1993), pp. 12<U+2013>13, 182 n. 35</ref>

By the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, [[music television]], and the arena concert circuit. New bands such as L.A.'s [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]] and acts from the East Coast like [[Poison (band)|Poison]] and [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] became major draws, while M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e and Ratt remained very popular. Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, [[New Jersey]]'s [[Bon Jovi]] became enormously successful with its third album, ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' (1986). The similarly styled Swedish band [[Europe (band)|Europe]] became international stars with ''[[The Final Countdown (album)|The Final Countdown]]'' (1986). Its [[The Final Countdown (song)|title track]] hit number 1 in 25 countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rock Group Europe Plan Comeback|publisher=BBC News|date=2003-10-03|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3162506.stm|accessdate=2008-11-28 | location=London}}</ref> In 1987, MTV launched a show, ''[[Headbanger's Ball]]'', devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos. However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as "lite metal" or "hair metal."<ref>Walser (1993), p. 14; Christe (2003), p. 170</ref>

One band that reached diverse audiences was [[Guns N' Roses]]. In contrast to their glam metal contemporaries in L.A., they were seen as much rawer and more dangerous. With the release of their chart-topping ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), they "recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years."<ref>Christe (2003), p. 165</ref> The following year, [[Jane's Addiction]] emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with its major label debut, ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]''.

The movement began in the United States, with [[Bay Area thrash metal]] being the leading scene. The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors.<ref name="GTM"/> Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with [[Shred guitar|shredding]] leads. Lyrics often express [[nihilism|nihilistic]] views or deal with [[social issues]] using visceral, gory language. Thrash has been described as a form of "urban blight music" and "a palefaced cousin of rap."<ref>Moynihan, S<U+00F8>derlind (1998), p. 26</ref>

The subgenre was popularized by the "Big Four of Thrash": [[Metallica]], [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]].<ref>Walser (1993), p.14</ref> Three German bands, [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], played a central role in bringing the style to Europe.

While thrash began as an underground scene, and remained largely that for almost a decade, the leading bands in the movement began to reach a wider audience. Metallica brought the sound into the top 40 of the ''Billboard'' album chart in 1986 with ''[[Master of Puppets]]''; two years later, the band's ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' hit number 6, while Megadeth and Anthrax had top 40 records.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5199&model.vnuAlbumId=758988 "Metallica<U+2014>Artist Chart History"]; [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5179&model.vnuAlbumId=933608  "Megadeth<U+2014>Artist Chart History"]; [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=3982&model.vnuAlbumId=728383 "Anthrax<U+2014>Artist Chart History"].

The era of metal's mainstream dominance in North America came to an end in the early 1990s with the emergence of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and other [[grunge]] bands, signaling the popular breakthrough of [[alternative rock]].<ref>Christe (2003), pp. 304<U+2013>6; Weinstein (1991), p. 278</ref> Grunge acts were influenced by the heavy metal sound, but rejected the excesses of the more popular metal bands, such as their "flashy and virtuosic solos" and "appearance-driven" [[MTV]] orientation.<ref name="Covach"/>

Glam metal fell out of favor due not only to the success of grunge,<ref>Christe (2003), p. 231</ref> but also because of the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash [[groove metal]] of [[Pantera]] and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]].<ref>Birchmeier, Jason.

Metallica revamped its image: the band members cut their hair and, in 1996, headlined the alternative musical festival [[Lollapalooza]] founded by Jane's Addiction singer [[Perry Farrell]].

Like Jane's Addiction, many of the most popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the umbrella term "alternative metal."<ref name="alternativemetal">{{cite web|title=Genre<U+2014>Alternative Metal|author=|publisher=Allmusic|date=|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=77:2697|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> Bands in Seattle's grunge scene such as [[Soundgarden]], credited as making a "place for heavy metal in alternative rock",<ref>{{cite web | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| title=Soundgarden (Biography) | publisher = Allmusic | url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:gifixqr5ld0e~T1| accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref> and [[Alice in Chains]] were at the center of the alternative metal movement. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: [[Faith No More]] combined their alternative rock sound with punk, [[funk]], metal, and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]; [[Primus (band)|Primus]] joined elements of funk, punk, [[thrash metal]], and [[experimental music]]; [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[Opeth]] mixed metal and [[progressive rock]]; bands such as [[Fear Factory]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] began incorporating metal into their [[industrial music|industrial sound]], and vice versa, respectively; and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie<U+2014>also identified with alt-metal<U+2014>significant, if partial, exceptions).<ref name="alternativemetal"/> Alternative metal's mix of styles and sounds represented "the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world."<ref>Christe (2003), p. 224</ref>

The mix demonstrated that "pancultural metal could pay off."<ref>Christe (2003), p. 329</ref> Nu metal gained mainstream success through heavy MTV rotation and Ozzy Osbourne's 1996 introduction of [[Ozzfest]], which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 324</ref> In 1999, ''Billboard'' noted that there were more than 500 specialty metal radio shows in the U.S., nearly three times as many as ten years before.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 344</ref> While nu metal was widely popular, traditional metal fans did not fully embrace the style.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 328</ref> By early 2003, the movement's popularity was on the wane, though several nu metal acts such as [[System of a Down]] retained substantial followings.<ref>{{cite web | last = D'angelo | first = Joe | title=Nu Metal Meltdown | publisher = MTV.com | date=2003-01-24  | url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal_meltdown/news_feature_030124/index.jhtml  | accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>

[[Metalcore]], an originally American hybrid of thrash metal and [[hardcore punk]],<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 288; Christe (2003), p. 372</ref> emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s. It is rooted in the [[crossover thrash]] style developed two decades earlier by bands such as [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles]], and [[Stormtroopers of Death]].<ref>Christe (2003), p. 184</ref> Through the 1990s, metalcore was mostly an underground phenomenon. By 2004, melodic metalcore<U+2014>influenced as well by [[melodic death metal]]<U+2014>was popular enough that [[Killswitch Engage]]'s ''[[The End of Heartache]]'' and [[Shadows Fall]]'s ''[[The War Within (album)|The War Within]]'' debuted at numbers 21 and 20, respectively, on the ''Billboard'' album chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Killswitch Engage|author=|publisher=''[[Roadrunner Records]]''|date=|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/KillswitchEngage/bio.aspx/| accessdate = 2007-03-17}} {{cite web|title=Shadows Fall|author=|publisher=''[[Atlantic Records]]''|date=|url=http://www.atlanticrecords.com/shadowsfall/about/| accessdate = 2007-03-17}}</ref> 

[[Bullet for My Valentine]], from Wales, broke into the top 5 in both the U.S. and British charts with ''[[Scream Aim Fire]]'' (2008). In recent years, metalcore bands have received prominent slots at Ozzfest and the [[Download Festival]]. [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], with a related blend of metal styles, hit the ''Billboard'' top 10 in 2006 with ''[[Sacrament (album)|Sacrament]]''. The success of these bands and others such as [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]], which has released both metalcore and straight-ahead thrash albums, and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]], which plays in a progressive/sludge style, has inspired claims of a metal revival in the United States, dubbed by some critics the "[[New Wave of American Heavy Metal]]".<ref>Sharpe-Young, Garry, ''New Wave of American Heavy Metal'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=uIIf03bGyAAC&pg=PP10&dq=nwoahm&ei=a7ohSNGYCrW2iQGP95nFDQ&sig=yhEpvA_dhNF6I5YwMJACJGRA3XY#PPP10,M1 (link)]. {{cite web |author=Edward, James |title=The Ghosts of Glam Metal Past |url=http://www.lotfp.com/content.php?editorialid=64 |publisher=Lamentations of the Flame Princess|accessdate=2008-04-27}} {{cite web| url = http://www.popmatters.com/columns/begrand/051014.shtml|publisher = Popmatters|title = Blood and Thunder: Regeneration|author =Begrand, Adrien| accessdate = 2008-05-14}}</ref>

In continental Europe, especially Germany and Scandinavia, metal continues to be broadly popular. Well-established British acts such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden continue to have chart success on the continent, as do a range of local groups. In Germany, Western Europe's largest music market, several continental metal bands placed multiple albums in the top 20 of the charts between 2003 and 2009, including the long-running German thrash metal band [[Kreator]], German industrial metal group [[Rammstein]], Finnish melodic death metal act [[Children of Bodom]], Norwegian symphonic extreme metal group [[Dimmu Borgir]], and three power metal bands: Germany's [[Blind Guardian]], England's [[DragonForce]] and Sweden's [[HammerFall]].<ref name="GerChart">{{cite web| url =http://www.charts-surfer.de/musiksearch.php|publisher = Charts-Surfer|title = Musik Charts: Suchergebnis| accessdate = 2008-06-17}} (In German). {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> The Swedish melodic death metal act [[In Flames]] took both ''[[Come Clarity]]'' (2006) and ''[[A Sense of Purpose]]'' (2008) to number 6 in Germany;<ref name="GerChart"/> each album topped the Swedish charts.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://swedishcharts.com/search.asp?cat=a&search=In+Flames|publisher = swedishcharts.com|title = Swedish Charts Portal: In Flames| accessdate = 2008-06-17}} (In Swedish).</ref>
