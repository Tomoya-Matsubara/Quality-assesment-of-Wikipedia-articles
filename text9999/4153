'''Holywood Exchange''' is a major retail development on the borders of [[Belfast]] and [[Holywood]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The site was previously known as '''D5''' and '''Harbour Exchange'''. At present the development compromises an 11&nbsp;unit 13,940&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (150,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>) retail warehouse centre, a [[J Sainsbury|Sainsbury's]] store and service station and a [[B&Q]] store. As of July 2007, none of the retail warehouse units have been let, over 3&nbsp;years since their completion in May 2004. An [[IKEA]] store of 29,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> is under construction and expected to open in December 2007.

Like the expansion of the [[Sprucefield]] development, Holywood Exchange has been controversial and the subject of repeated planning problems and legal disputes.

==History==
[[Image:Sainsbury's Holywood Exchange2.jpg|thumb|Sainsbury's Holywood Exchange opened in 2003.]]
The first planning application for what was then known as D5 was made by Aquis Estates Limited, Anglia and General Developments Limited and [[Belfast Harbour Commissioners]] on [[14 November]] [[1995]].  <ref name="Judgement">{{cite paper | author =  Mr Justice Coghlin  | title = In the matter of an application by Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, Belfast City Council and North Down Borough Council for Judicial Review | publisher = Northern Ireland Court Service | date = 2000-09-01 | url = http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/EA5A3490-04E5-4626-8605-D69AF513E6BF/0/j_j_COGF3250.htm | accessdate =2006-08-23  }}</ref> In 1997 the Planning Appeal Commission and the [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|Department of the Environment]]'s Planning Service recommended that approval should be granted.  Formal planning permission was granted on [[13 April]] [[1999]].  On [[21 June]] [[1999]] [[Belfast City Council]] and The [[Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce]] applied for [[judicial review]] of the decision to grant planning permission. On [[9 July]] [[1999]] planning permission for D5 was quashed as it was judged that the Minister did not take the decision with all the relevant information. <ref name="Judgement"/>

Planning permission for the competing [[Tesco]] development on the opposite side of the A2 road had been granted on [[28 November]] [[1998]]. Following the quashing of planning permission for D5 its developers sought judicial review of the permission granted to Tesco, arguing that the same could apply to that development, however this was refused on [[17 September]] [[1999]]. This judgement was slightly controversial, given that the judge refused to rescind planning permission solely due to the fact that the <U+00A3>13&nbsp;million Tesco store was almost complete. <ref>{{cite web | title = Heritage Review No. 3 | publisher = John McMurtry & Co Ltd | date = Spring 2000 | url = http://freespace.virgin.net/mp.hearth/HR2000.pdf#search=%22tesco%20knocknagoney%22 | format = PDF | accessdate =2006-08-23 }}</ref>

The developers resubmitted their planning application and were granted permission on [[21 March]] [[2000]]. This decision was again successfully challenged in September 2000.<ref>{{cite news | title =Judge axes <U+00A3>80m shopping complex | publisher =[[BBC News]] | date =2000-09-01 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/906165.stm | accessdate =2006-08-23}}</ref> Following another appeal planning permission was granted in February 2001.<ref>{{cite news | title = Disputed shopping complex go ahead | publisher =BBC News | date = 2001-02-23 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1186016.stm | accessdate =2006-08-23}}</ref> The Belfast Chamber of Trade lodged a legal challenge with the [[House of Lords]], however its judicial committee refused to grant the chamber of trade leave to appeal.<ref>{{cite news| first = Robin| last = Morton| title = Chamber of Trade faces D5 legal bill| work = Belfast Telegraph| publisher = Belfast Telegraph Newspapers| date = 2001-11-06| accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref> Construction of the [[B&Q]] store commenced in December 2002.

In January 2006 [[IKEA]] announced its intention to build a 25,800&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (278,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>)  store, its first in Northern Ireland. In May 2006 IKEA amended its application for a larger 29,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (312,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>) store. <ref>{{cite news | title =Ikea enlarge planned Belfast shop  | publisher =BBC News | date =2006-05-26 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5017776.stm | accessdate =2006-08-23}}</ref> The application was approved in December 2006,<ref>{{cite news | title =Ikea gets go-ahead for city store | publisher =BBC News | date =2006-12-21 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6199637.stm | accessdate =2007-01-15}}</ref>  work on the store began in January 2007 and it is expected to open on [[13 December]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news | title =Work starting on first Ikea store  | publisher =BBC News | date =2007-01-26 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6300211.stm | accessdate =2007-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release  | title = COUNTDOWN TO IKEA OPENING DAY BEGINS: ONLY 118 DAYS TO GO!  | publisher = [[IKEA]]  | date = [[2007]]-[[08-19]]  | url = http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/press_room/press_release/national/belfast_opening.html  | accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}</ref>

The store will include a 500 seat Restaurant, [[Bistro]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] Shop and have parking for 1455 vehicles.<ref>

==Transport==
The Holywood Exchange developers were able to take advantage existing road connections. The most important element of these connections was a full flyover on the A2, already built for access to the Belfast Harbour Estate. The Belfast to Bangor railway line runs between the site and the A2. There are proposals for a railway halt to serve both Holywood Exchange and the adjacent [[Belfast City Airport]]. However Belfast City Airport argues that constructing the halt adjacent to the airport terminal (further away from Holywood Exchange) would encourage more air travellers to use the rail connection. <ref>{{cite web | title = Belfast City Airport Master Plan to 2030 | publisher = Belfast City Airport | date =  | url = http://www.belfastcityairport.com/UPLOADS/DOCS/MasterPlan2006.pdf  | format = PDF | accessdate =2006-08-23  }}</ref> The Airport has also stated that it will consider providing road access to the airport through Holywood Exchange as a way of reducing congestion on the existing airport access route.

On [[16 January]] [[2007]] the [[Department for Regional Development|Regional Development Minister]] [[David Cairns (politician)|David Cairns]] announced that a feasibility study would be launched into the construction of a rapid transit route linking Holywood Exchange to Belfast city centre. The route would also serve the airport and the [[Titanic Quarter]] development.<ref>{{cite news|first = Robin|last = Morton|title = Light rail plans for Belfast speed up|url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2157770.ece|work = Belfast Telegraph|publisher = Independent News & Media (NI)|date = 2007-01-16 | accessdate = 2007-01-30}}</ref>
