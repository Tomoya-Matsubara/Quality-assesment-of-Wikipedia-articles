'''Edward Forset''' or '''Forsett''' ([[1553 ]] - [[1630]]) was an English writer, known for political works and as a playwright. 

A [[justice of the peace]], he was involved on the prosecution side of the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]].<ref>[http://www.sgwilkinson.freeserve.co.uk/gfawkes.htm]: Forset was a witness to the statement taken from [[Guy Fawkes]] under torture; the others being [[Sir Edward Coke]] and [[Sir William Waad]].</ref><ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=15004]: Report in state papers of James I mentioning him (March 1606).</ref>

In ''A Comparative Discourse'' (1606) he contributed to the traditional [[monarchist]] theory of the king<U+2019>s two bodies: the [[body politic]] and the [[body natural]].<ref>[http://www.constitution.org/cmt/wormuth/wormuth.htm]: ''Without a sovereign, said Edward Forsett, "no people can ever as subjects range themselves into the order, and community of human society, howsoever, as men, or rather as wild savages, they may perhaps breathe a while upon the earth."''</ref> This is considered one important source for later [[divine right]] and [[Cavalier|royalist]] ideas, as well as spinning out the bodily metaphor (the King as the heart).

The 1624 ''Defence of the Right of Kings'' was a belated reply to writings of the [[Jesuit]] [[Robert Parsons (priest)|Robert Parsons]].

His ''Pedantius'' was a Latin comedy. It made fun of [[Gabriel Harvey]].<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/216/1213.html]: the play was set in Cambridge.</ref>
