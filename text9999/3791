'''Animal testing''' or '''animal research''' is the use of non-human [[animals]] in [[Experiment|scientific experimentation]]. It is estimated that 50 to 100 million [[vertebrate]] animals worldwide &mdash;  from [[zebrafish]] to [[Primate|non-human primates]] &mdash; are used annually.<ref>[http://www.buav.org/pdf/VivisectionFAQs.pdf "Vivisection FAQ], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection; [http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/RIA_Report_FINAL-opt.pdf "The Ethics of research involving animals"], Nuffield Council on Bioethics, section 1.6. </ref> Although much larger numbers of [[invertebrate]]s are used and the use of flies and worms as [[model organism]]s is very important, experiments on invertebrates are largely unregulated and not included in statistics. Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment. Sources of laboratory animals vary between countries and species; while most animals are purpose-bred, others may be caught in the wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and [[Animal shelter|pounds]].<ref>"Use of Laboratory Animals in Biomedical and Behavioral Research", Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, The National Academies Press, 1988.

The research is conducted inside universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, farms, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry.<ref name=selectcommintro>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a7 "Introduction"], Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures Report, United Kingdom Parliament.</ref> It includes pure research such as [[genetic]]s, [[developmental biology]], [[animal behaviour|behavioural studies]], as well as applied research such as [[biomedical research]], [[xenotransplantation]], drug testing and [[Toxicology testing|toxicology tests]], including [[Testing cosmetics on animals|cosmetics testing]].  Animals are also used for education, breeding, and defense research.

The topic is highly controversial.

==Definitions==
The terms animal testing, '''animal experimentation''', animal research, '''''in vivo'' testing''', and '''[[vivisection]]''' have similar [[denotation]]s but different [[connotation]]s. Literally, "vivisection" means the "cutting up" of a living animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the [[dissection]] of live animals. The term is now used to refer to any experiment using living animals; for example, the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' defines "vivisection"  as: "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals."<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382118?query=Vivisection&ct= "Vivisection"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2007.

Zed Books, 1999, and [http://www.buav.org/pdf/VivisectionFAQs.pdf "FAQs: Vivisection"], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.</ref> For others, the word has a pejorative connotation, implying torture and suffering.<ref>Carbone, Larry. ''What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare''. Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 22.</ref> The word "vivisection" is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term "animal experimentation."<ref>Paixao, RL; Schramm, FR.

Toxicology testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to a tragedy in 1937 where a drug labeled <U+201C>Elixir of Sulfanilamide<U+201D> killed 73 people, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs, before they could be marketed.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/oc/history/elixir.html Taste of Raspberries, Taste of Death. The 1937 Elixir Sulfanilamide Incident], FDA Consumer magazine June 1981.</ref> Similar laws soon followed in other countries.

The controversy surrounding animal testing dates back to the 17th century. In 1655, the advocate of [[Galen|Galenic]] physiology [[Edmund O'Meara]] said that "the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state."<ref name=Ryder54>[[Richard D. Ryder|Ryder, Richard D.]] ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism''.

''Animal experimentation from antiquity to the end of the eighteenth century: attitudes and arguments''. In N. A. Rupke (ed.) Vivisection in Historical Perspective. Croom Helm, London, 1987, p. 22.</ref> O'Meara and others argued that animal physiology could be affected by pain during vivisection, rendering results unreliable. There were also objections on an [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] basis, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals.<ref name=ANZCCART/> Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle &mdash; many people believed that animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans.<ref name=ANZCCART/>

On the other side of the debate, those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge.

In 1822, the first [[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822|animal protection law]] was enacted in the British parliament, followed by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876|Cruelty to Animals Act (1876)]], the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by [[Charles Darwin]], who wrote to [[Ray Lankester]] in March 1871: "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night."<ref>[http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Life-and-Letters-of-Charles-Darwinx29407.html ''The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Volume II''], ''fullbooks.com''.</ref><ref>Bowlby, John.

Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.<ref>Buettinger, Craig [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-13506650.html Antivivisection and the charge of zoophil-psychosis in the early twentieth century.] ''The Historian'' 1 January 1993</ref>

==Care and use of animals==
{{see also|Animal testing regulations|Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee|Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986}}
===Regulations===
The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species. In the U.S., under the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s (NIH) ''Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'' (the ''Guide''), any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. In general, researchers are required to consult with the institution's veterinarian and its [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]] (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain.<ref name=Carbone68>Carbone, Larry. '"What Animal Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy''. Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 68-69.</ref> The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. Larry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises what he calls a "red flag of special concern."<ref>Carbone 2004, p. 94.</ref>

Mice, rats, and birds are not included in the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act (though they are included in the ''Guide'') and over the years, the definition of "animal" used by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has changed several times to ensure that certain animals are included in protective legislation and that others, particularly farm animals, are excluded.<ref>Carbone 2004, pp. 70-71.</ref>

===Numbers===
[[Image:Types of vertebrates v2.png|right|thumb|right|280px|Types of [[vertebrate]]s used in animal testing in Europe in 2005: a total of 12.1 million animals were used.<ref name=EU2005/>]]
Accurate global figures for animal testing are difficult to obtain. The [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV) estimates that 100 million vertebrates are experimented on around the world every year, 10&ndash;11 million of them in the European Union.<ref name=buavfaq>[http://www.buav.org/pdf/VivisectionFAQs.pdf "Vivisection FAQ], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.</ref> The Nuffield Council on Bioethics reports that global annual estimates range from 50 to 100 million animals.

In 1966, the Laboratory Animal Breeders Association estimated in testimony before Congress that the number of mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits used in 1965 was around 60 million. (Hearings before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Feed Grains, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. House of Representatives, 1966, p. 63.) In 2004, the Department of Agriculture listed 64,932 dogs, 23,640 cats, 54,998 non-human primates, 244,104 guinea pigs, 175,721 hamsters, 261,573 rabbits, 105,678 farm animals, and 171,312 other mammals, a total of 1,101,958, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2004 from 195,157 to 64,932, and from 66,165 to 23,640, respectively.

{{main|Animal testing on invertebrates}}
Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used, these experiments are largely unregulated by law. The most used invertebrate species are ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', a fruit fly, and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a [[nematode]] worm. In the case of ''C. elegans'', the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known,<ref>Antoshechkin I, Sternberg PW (2007) "The versatile worm: genetic and genomic resources for Caenorhabditis elegans research" ''Nat.

However, the lack of an adaptive [[immune system]] and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in medical research such as vaccine development.<ref name=Schulenburg>Schulenburg, H., Kurz, C.L., Ewbank, J.J.

In the U.S., the numbers of rats and mice used is estimated at 20 million a year.<ref name=Trull/> Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils.

Nearly 200,000 fish and 20,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2004.<ref name=HomeOffice2004> [http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm67/6713/6713.pdf "Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain, 2004], British government.</ref> The main species used is the zebrafish, ''[[Danio rerio]]'', which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, ''[[Xenopus laevis]]''. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004.<ref name=HomeOffice2004/> [[Albino]] rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment make the effects easier to visualize.<ref name=HomeOffice2004/> 

*;Cats and dogs
{{see also|Laika|Russian space dogs}}
Cats are most commonly used in neurological research.

Dogs are widely used in biomedical research, testing, and education &mdash; particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle. They are commonly used as models for human diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the [[Humane Society of the United States]].<ref name=HSUSDogs>[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_research/dog.html Dog profile], The Humane Society of the United States.</ref> The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Report for 2005 shows that 66,000 dogs were used in USDA-registered facilities in that year.<ref name=USDA2006/> In the U.S., some of the dogs are purpose-bred, while most are supplied by so-called Class B dealers licensed by the USDA to buy animals from auctions, shelters, newspaper ads, and who are sometimes accused of [[Laboratory animal sources#Bunching|stealing pets]].<ref name=Gillham>Gillham, Christina.

{{main|Animal testing on non-human primates}}
Non-human primates (NHPs) are used in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of [[neurology]], behavior and cognition, reproduction, [[genetics]], and [[xenotransplantation]]. They are caught in the wild or purpose-bred. In the U.S. and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred.<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10774&page=R1 International Perspectives: The Future of Nonhuman Primate Resources], Proceedings of the Workshop Held April 17-19, pages 36-45, 46-48, 63-69, 197-200.</ref> Rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and owl monkeys are imported; around 12,000 to 15,000 monkeys are imported into the U.S. annually.<ref>[http://www.asp.org/research/faq.html Primatology FAQ]</ref> In total, around 70,000 NHPs are used each year in the United States and European Union.<ref name=USDA2006/><ref name=EU2005/> Most of the NHPs used are [[macaque]]s;<ref name="Humaneprimate"/> but [[marmoset]]s, [[spider monkey]]s, and [[squirrel monkey]]s are also used, and [[baboon]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s are used in the U.S; in 2006 there were 1133 chimpanzees in U.S. primate centers.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5811/450 Science article on chimps in the USA]</ref> Notable studies on non-human primates have been part of the polio vaccine development, and development of [[Deep Brain Stimulation]], and their current heaviest non-toxicological use occurs in the monkey AIDS model, [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]].<ref name=TheRoyalSociety/><ref name=Emborg/><ref name="Humaneprimate">Kathleen M.

===Sources===
{{main|Laboratory animal sources|International trade in primates}}
Animals used by laboratories are largely supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied from a few main stock centers.<ref>[http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/comparative_medicine/resource_directory/invertebrates.asp Invertebrate Animal Resources] National Center for Research Resources, Accessed 15th December 2007</ref> For vertebrates, sources include breeders who supply purpose-bred animals; businesses that trade in wild animals; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. [[Animal shelter]]s also supply the laboratories directly.<ref>[http://www.aesop-project.org/Oversight.htm "Who's Who of Federal Oversight of Animal Issues"], Aesop Project.</ref> Large centers also exist to distribute strains of [[genetically-modified organism|genetically-modified animals]]; the [[National Institutes of Health]] '' Knockout Mouse Project'', for example, aims to provide [[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] for every gene in the mouse genome.<ref>Collins FS, Rossant J, Wurst W.

In the U.S., Class A breeders are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell animals for research purposes, while Class B dealers are licensed to buy animals from "random sources" such as auctions, pound seizure, and newspaper ads. Some Class B dealers have been accused of kidnapping pets and illegally trapping strays, a practice known as ''bunching''.<ref>

Four states in the U.S. &mdash; [[Minnesota]], [[Utah]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Iowa]] &mdash; require their shelters to provide animals to research facilities.

In the [[European Union]], animal sources are governed by ''Council Directive 86/609/EEC'', which requires lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a wild animal or a stray.

===Pain and suffering===
{{main|Pain and suffering in laboratory animals}}
{{see|Animal cognition}}
The extent to which animal testing causes pain and suffering, and the capacity of animals to experience and comprehend them, is the subject of much debate.<ref>Duncan IJ, Petherick JC. (1991) [http://jas.fass.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1808195 "The implications of cognitive processes for animal welfare"], ''J. Anim. Sci''., volume 69, issue 12, pages 5017<U+2013>22. PMID 1808195; Curtis SE, Stricklin WR. (1991) [http://jas.fass.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1808193 "The importance of animal cognition in agricultural animal production systems: an overview"], ''J. Anim. Sci.''. volume 69, issue 12, pages 5001<U+2013>7. PMID 1808193</ref> 

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2006 about 670,000 animals (not including rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. About 420,000 were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 84,000 were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved.<ref name=USDA2006/>

In the UK, research projects are classified as mild, moderate, and substantial in terms of the suffering the researchers conducting the study say they may cause; a fourth category of "unclassified" means the animal was [[Anesthesia|anesthetized]] and killed without recovering [[consciousness]], according to the researchers. In December 2001, 39 percent (1,296) of project licenses in force were classified as mild, 55 percent (1,811) as moderate, two percent (63) as substantial, and 4 percent (139) as unclassified.<ref name=RyderSinger>[[Richard Ryder|Ryder, Richard D.]] "Speciesism in the laboratory," in [[Peter Singer|Singer, Peter]].

The idea that animals might not feel pain as human beings feel it traces back to the 17th-century French philosopher, [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]], who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack [[consciousness]].<ref name=Carbone149>Carbone, Larry.

New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. xii, 117-118, cited in Carbone 2004, p. 150.</ref> In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to "prove" that animals are conscious, and to provide "scientifically acceptable" grounds for claiming that they feel pain.<ref name=Rollin117/> Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support,<ref>Griffin DR, Speck GB (2004) "New evidence of animal consciousness" ''Anim.

Anim. Sci.'' volume 76 issue 1 pages 42-7 PMID 9464883</ref><ref name=nuffield45/> The ability of invertebrate species of animals, such as insects, to feel pain and suffering is also unclear.<ref>Lockwood JA (1987) [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0015-4040%28198703%2970%3A1%3C70%3ATMSOIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O The Moral Standing of Insects and the Ethics of Extinction] ''The Florida Entomologist'', Volume 70, Number 1, pages 70-89</ref><ref>DeGrazia D, Rowan A (1991) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p4g44725t17126x0/ Pain, suffering, and anxiety in animals and humans] ''Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics'' Volume 12, Number 3, pages 193-211</ref>

The defining text on animal welfare regulation, "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the USA. It states "The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals."<ref>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, ILAR, National Research Council, 1996 copyright, pg 64</ref> The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms. On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain, the Guide states "The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol".  Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval.

===Euthanasia===
{{see|Euthanasia|Animal euthanasia}}
There is general agreement that animal life should not be taken wantonly, and regulations require that scientists use as few animals as possible.<ref name=Flecknell/> However, policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue, and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering, while others, such as the [[RSPCA]], argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value.<ref>[http://www.apc.gov.uk/reference/costbenefit.pdf Animal Procedures Committee: review of cost-benefit assessment in the use of animals in research] The Animal Procedures Committee, June 2003 p46-7</ref> Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself.<ref name=Carbone2>Carbone, Larry. "Euthanasia," in Bekoff, M. and Meaney, C. ''Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Welfare''. Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 164-166, cited in Carbone 2004, pp. 189-190.</ref> Researchers call the killing of laboratory animals after an experiment "euthanasia" &mdash; literally "good death" &mdash; a term applied to all animals, including the young and healthy, although the same term is used of human beings only when the death will end severe suffering that cannot otherwise be relieved.<ref name=Carbone2/> The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or [[Autopsy|post-mortem examination]]; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days;<ref>[http://www.ahc.umn.edu/rar/euthanasia.html "Euthanasia Guidelines"], Research animal resources, University of Minnesota.</ref> or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.<ref>Close, Bryonyl et al.

Methods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress.<ref>Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, 1996 Edition, Euthanasia section on pg 65</ref> The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal can be made to inhale a gas, such as [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]], by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. [[Sedative]]s or [[anesthetic]]s such as [[barbiturate]]s can be given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as [[tricaine]]. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include [[decapitation]] (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. [[Cervical dislocation]] (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits.  [[Maceration]] (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave [[irradiation]] of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. [[Captive bolt]]s may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious.  [[Electrocution]] may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun.  [[Pithing]] (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious.  Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing [[air embolism]] are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.<ref>[http://www.avma.org/resources/euthanasia.pdf AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia, June 2007 edition] Report of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia, Accessed 08 February 2008</ref>

{{animal testing}}
===Pure research===
Basic or pure research investigates how organisms behave, develop, and function. Those opposed to animal testing object that pure research may have little or no practical purpose, but researchers argue that it may produce unforeseen benefits, rendering the distinction between pure and applied research &mdash; research that has a specific practical aim &mdash; unclear.<ref name=Lords3>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15006.htm Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures Report], House of Lords, Chapter 3: The purpose and nature of animal experiments.</ref>

Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from [[California sea slug|sea slugs]] through to [[armadillo]]s.<ref>[http://www.rds-online.org.uk/pages/page.asp?i_ToolbarID=2&i_PageID=2096 "An A to Z of laboratory animals"] Research Defense Society.

Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include:
*Studies on ''[[embryogenesis]]'' and ''[[developmental biology]]''. Mutants are created by adding [[transposon]]s into their [[genome]]s, or specific genes are deleted by [[gene targeting]].<ref>Venken KJ, Bellen HJ (2005) "Emerging technologies for gene manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster" ''Nat. Rev. Genet.'' volume 6 issue 3 pages 167<U+2013>78 PMID 15738961</ref><ref>Sung YH, Song J, Lee HW (2004) "Functional genomics approach using mice" ''J. Biochem. Mol. Biol.'' volume 37 issue 1 pages=122<U+2013>32 PMID 14761310</ref> By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the [[homeobox]] genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.<ref>Janies D., DeSalle R.

* Breeding experiments to study ''[[evolution]]'' and ''[[genetics]]''. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are [[Inbreeding|inbred]] through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics.<ref>[[Michael Festing|Festing, M.]], ''[http://www.informatics.jax.org/external/festing/mouse/INTRO.shtml "Inbred Strains of Mice and their Characteristics"],'' ''[[The Jackson Laboratory]] '', Retrieved 30 January, 2008</ref> These provide animals of a known genetic background, an important tool for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of [[Selective breeding|inbred domesticated animals]], such as dog or cattle breeds, for [[Comparative genomics|comparative]] purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species, including [[mosquito]]s, [[stickleback]]s, and [[lamprey]]s, to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their [[ecological niche|niche]]) produce [[adaptation]]s in their physiology and [[Comparative anatomy|morphology]].<ref>Casci, T., [http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v3/n2/full/nrg735.html "Evolution: Sticklebacks finally get a map",] ''Nature Reviews Genetics'' 3, 84, 2002</ref>

===Applied research===
Applied research aims to solve specific and practical problems. Compared to pure research, which is largely academic in origin, applied research is usually carried out in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], or by universities in commercial partnerships. These may involve the use of [[animal model]]s of diseases or conditions, which are often discovered or generated by pure research programmes. In turn, such applied studies may be an early stage in the [[drug discovery]] process. Examples include:

*[[Genetic modification]] of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific conditions such as [[Monogenic disorder#Single gene disorders|single gene disorders]], such as [[Huntington's disease]].<ref>Ramaswamy S, McBride JL, Kordower JH (2007) "Animal models of Huntington's disease" ''ILAR J'' volume 48 issue 4 pages 356<U+2013>73 PMID 17712222</ref> Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]],<ref>Rees DA, Alcolado JC (2005) "Animal models of diabetes mellitus" ''Diabet. Med.'' volume 22 issue 4 pages 359<U+2013>70 PMID 15787657</ref> or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of [[cancer]].<ref>Iwakuma T, Lozano G (2007) "Crippling p53 activities via knock-in mutations in mouse models" ''Oncogene'' volume 26 issue 15 pages 2177<U+2013>84 PMID 17401426</ref> These models allow investigations on how and why the disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments.<ref>Frese KK, Tuveson DA (2007) "Maximizing mouse cancer models" ''Nat. Rev. Cancer'' volume 7 issue 9 pages 645<U+2013>58 PMID 17687385</ref> The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient.<ref name=Rosenthal/> Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.<ref name=HOStats/>

*Studies on models of naturally occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals have a natural propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study [[leukemia]] because their natural predisposition to [[FIV]] and [[Feline leukemia virus]].<ref>Dunham SP. "Lessons from the cat: development of vaccines against lentiviruses," ''Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol'', volume 112, issues 1-2, 2006, pp. 67<U+2013>77. PMID 16678276; Vail DM, MacEwen EG. "Spontaneously occurring tumors of companion animals as models for human cancer," ''Cancer Invest'', volume 18, issue 8, 2000, pp. 781<U+2013>92. PMID 11107448</ref> Certain breeds of dog suffer from [[narcolepsy]] making them the major model used to study the human condition. [[Armadillo]]s and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally suffer from [[leprosy]]; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are the primary source of [[bacilli]] used in leprosy vaccines.<ref>Job, C.K.

*Studies on induced animal models of human diseases. Here, an animal is treated so that it develops [[pathology]] and symptoms that resemble a human disease.

====Xenotransplantation====
{{main|Xenotransplantation}}
[[Xenotransplantation]] research involves transplanting tissues, or organs from one species to another, as a way to overcome the shortage of human organs for use in [[organ transplant]]s.<ref>Platt JL, Lin SS (1998) [http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9928201 "The future promises of xenotransplantation"] ''Ann.

The British Home Office released figures in 1999 showing that 270 monkeys had been used in xenotransplantation research in Britain during the previous four years. Documents leaked from [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] to ''The Observer'' in 2003 showed, between 1994 and 2000, wild baboons were imported to the UK from Africa to be used in experiments that involved grafting pigs' hearts and kidneys onto the primates' necks, abdomens, and chests. ''The Observer'' reports that some baboons died after suffering strokes, vomiting, diarrhea, and paralysis, while others died ''en route'' to the UK. The experiments were conducted by Imutran Ltd, a subsidiary of [[Novartis]] Pharma AG in conjunction with Cambridge University and Huntingdon Life Sciences. Novartis told the newspaper that developing new cures for humans invariably means experimenting on live animals.<ref name=Townsend>Townsend, Mark.

The newspaper also wrote that researchers were deliberately underestimating the suffering in order to obtain licences. A report from Imutran said: "The Home Office will attempt to get the kidney transplants classified as 'moderate,' ensuring that it is easier for Imutran to receive a licence and ignoring the 'severe' nature of these programmes."<ref name=Townsend>Townsend, Mark.

===Toxicology testing===
{{main|Toxicology testing}}
{{see|Draize test|LD50|Acute toxicity|Chronic toxicity}}

Toxicology testing, also known as safety testing, is conducted by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], on behalf of a wide variety of customers.<ref name=BUAVHPT>[http://www.buav.org/pdf/HouseholdProductTests.pdf Household Product Tests] [[BUAV]]</ref> According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures.<ref name=EU2005>[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/5th_stat_rep_lab_animals_en.pdf Fifth Report on the Statistics on the Number of Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes in the Member States of the European Union] ''Commission of the European Communities'', published November 2007</ref> According to ''Nature'', 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides.<ref name=Abbott>Abbott, Alison.

[[Image:DraizeTest-PETA.jpg|left|thumb|180px|A rabbit during a [[Draize test]].]]
Toxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as [[pesticide]]s, [[medication]]s, [[food additives]], packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to [[BUAV]], manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label.<ref name=BUAVHPT/>

The substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected [[intravenous]]ly, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[subcutaneous]]ly; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal. 

There are several different types of [[acute toxicity]] tests. The [[LD50]] ("Lethal Dose 50%") test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal [[Statistical population|population]]. This test was removed from [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the [[Fixed Dose Procedure|fixed dose procedure]], which use fewer animals and cause less suffering.<ref>Walum E [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1533392&blobtype=pdf Acute oral toxicity] ''Environ. Health Perspect.'' volume 106 Suppl 2 pages 498<U+2013>499 1998 pmid 9599698</ref><ref>[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/animals_in_research_news/intergovernmental_organization_eliminates_the_ld50_test.html Inter-Governmental Organization Eliminates the LD50 Test], The Humane Society of the United States, accessed 17 January 2008</ref> ''Nature'' writes that, as of 2005, "the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal [toxicity] tests worldwide."<ref name=Abbott/>
[[Image:LD50mouse.jpg||right|thumb|180px|A rat undergoing an [[LD50]] test. Source: Animal Alliance]]
Irritancy is usually measured using the [[Draize test]], where a test substance is applied to an animal's eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the recommended protocol involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but that the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows "continuing signs of severe pain or distress".<ref>[http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/9740501E.PDF OECD guideline 405] Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Accessed 19 January 2008</ref> The [[Humane Society of the United States]] writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness.<ref>[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_research/rabbit.html Species Used in Research: Rabbit] Humane Society of the United States, Accessed 19 January 2008</ref> This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world.<ref>Wilhelmus, K.R. "The Draize eye test," ''Surv Ophthalmol'' volume 45, issue 6, 2001, pages 493<U+2013>515, PMID 11425356</ref> Although no accepted ''in vitro'' alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the ''low volume eye test'' may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results, but it has not yet replaced the original test.<ref>Secchi A., Deligianni V. "Ocular toxicology: the Draize eye test," ''Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol'' volume 6, issue 5, 2006, pp. 367<U+2013>72. PMID 16954791</ref>

The most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting less than a month (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, [[mutagen]]icity, [[carcinogen]]icity, [[teratogen]]icity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.

These toxicity tests provide, in the words of a 2006 [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] report, "critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential".<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11523&page=R1 Toxicity Testing for Assessment of Environmental Agents"] National Academies Press, (2006), p21, Accessed 15th December</ref> However, as ''Nature'' reported, most animal tests either over- or underestimate risk, or do not reflect toxicity in humans particularly well.<ref name=Abbott/> This variability stems from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith LL |title=Key challenges for toxicologists in the 21st century |journal=Trends Pharmacol. Sci. |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=281<U+2013>5 |year=2001 |pmid=11395155}}</ref> Although relationships do exist, opinion is divided on how to use data on one species to predict the exact level of risk in another.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown SL, Brett SM, Gough M, Rodricks JV, Tardiff RG, Turnbull D |title=Review of interspecies risk comparisons |journal=Regul.

[[Image:NoAnimalTesting.gif|left|frame|Products in Europe not tested on animals carry this symbol.]]
====Cosmetics testing====
{{main|Testing cosmetics on animals}}
Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial. Such tests, which are still conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, [[phototoxic]]ity (toxicity triggered by [[ultraviolet]] light) and mutagenicity.<ref>[http://www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/ARI/ARIS_An_Overview_Of_Animal_Testing_Issues.pdf An overview of Animal Testing Issues], Humane Society of the United States. Accessed 27 February 2008</ref>

Cosmetics testing is banned in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK, and in 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union (EU) agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, [[L'Oreal]], has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the [[European Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg]], asking that the ban be quashed.<ref name=Osborn/> The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy.<ref name=Osborn>Osborn, Andrew & Gentleman, Amelia.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/animalrights/story/0,11917,1021527,00.html "Secret French move to block animal-testing ban"], ''The Guardian'', August 19, 2003. Accessed 27 February 2008</ref>

===Drug testing===
[[Image:Dogs6CCcopy.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Beagles used for safety testing of [[pharmaceuticals]] in a British facility.]]
Before the early 20th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. Nowadays all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use. Tests on pharmaceutical products involve:

*''metabolic tests'', investigating [[pharmacokinetics]] - how drugs are absorbed, [[Drug metabolism|metabolized]] and [[Excretion|excreted]] by the body when introduced [[Wiktionary:oral|orally]], [[intravenous]]ly, intraperitoneally, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[Transdermal patch|transdermally]].

*''toxicology tests'', which gauge [[acute toxicity|acute]], sub-acute, and [[chronic toxicity]]. Acute toxicity is studied by using a rising dose until signs of toxicity become apparent. Current European legislation demands that "acute toxicity tests must be carried out in two or more mammalian species" covering "at least two different routes of administration".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML EU Directive 2001/83/EC], p.44. Accessed 27 February 2008</ref> Sub-acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning, in order to discover if any toxic [[drug metabolism|drug metabolites]] build up over time. Testing for chronic toxicity can last up to two years and, in the European Union, is required to involve two species of mammals, one of which must be non-rodent.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML EU Directive 2001/83/EC], p. 45. Accessed 27 February 2008</ref>
*''efficacy studies'', which test whether experimental drugs work by inducing the appropriate illness in animals. The drug is then administered in a [[Randomized controlled trial|double-blind controlled trial]], which allows researchers to determine the effect of the drug and the [[Dose response|dose-response]] curve.
*Specific tests on ''reproductive function'', ''embryonic toxicity'', or ''carcinogenic potential'' can all be required by law, depending on the result of other studies and the type of drug being tested.

===Education, breeding, and defense===
Animals are also used for education and training; are bred for use in laboratories; and are used by the military to develop weapons, vaccines, battlefield surgical techniques, and defensive clothing.<ref name=Lords3/>
[[Image:Rodent52copy.jpg|right|thumb|220px|A technician assessing mice in a typical research [[vivarium]].]]

There are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education.<ref>Dalal, Rooshin et al. [http://www.pcrm.org/resch/anexp/abstract_teaching.html ''Replacement Alternatives in Education: Animal-Free Teaching''] abstract from Fifth World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences, Berlin, August 2005.</ref> Horst Spielmann, German director of the Central Office for Collecting and Assessing Alternatives to Animal Experimentation, while describing Germany's progress in this area, told German broadcaster [[ARD]] in 2005: "Using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous. In many countries, one can become a doctor, vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal."<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1687760,00.html ''Seeking an End to Animal Experimentation''], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[August 23]], [[2005]], retrieved on December 16, 2007.</ref>

==Ethics==
{{see|Animal rights}}
The [[ethics|ethical]] questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to much debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century.<ref>Bernard E. Rollin (2006) "The Regulation of Animal Research and the Emergence of Animal Ethics: A Conceptual History" ''Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics'' Volume 27 Number 4 pages 285-304 DOI 10.1007/s11017-006-9007-8</ref> There remain strong disagreements about which animal testing procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply, and to which species of animals. The dominant ethical position, world-wide, is that achievement of scientific and medical goals using animal testing is desirable, provided that animal suffering and use is minimized.<ref name=1985Amend/> The British government has additionally required that the cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge.<ref name=SelectComm/>

A wide range of minority viewpoints exist as well. The view that animals have moral rights ([[animal rights]]) is a philosophical position proposed by [[Tom Regan]], who argues that animals are beings with beliefs, desires and self-consciousness.<ref>Peter Singer (Ed) "A Companion to Ethics", Blackwell Companions to Philosophy, 1991, Chapter 30 "Animals" by Lori Gruen p346</ref> Such beings are seen as having inherent value and thus possessing [[right]]s. Regan still sees clear ethical differences between killing animals and killing humans, and argues that to save human lives it is permissible to kill animals. However, some such as [[Bernard Rollin]] have taken his position further and argue that any benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an individual animal in ways that do not benefit that individual.<ref>Helga Kuhse and Peter Singer "A Companion to Bioethics", Blackwell Publishing, 1998, Chapter 39 by Bernard E. Rollin "The moral status of animals and their use as experimental subjects." p414</ref> Another prominent position is articulated by [[Peter Singer]], who sees no convincing reason to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] moral considerations.<ref>Singer (1991) ''op. cit.'' p348</ref> Although these arguments have not been widely accepted, in response to these concerns some governments such as the [[Netherlands]] and [[New Zealand]] have outlawed invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the [[Great Apes]].<ref>Gagneux P, Moore JJ, Varki A (2005) "The ethics of research on great apes" ''Nature'' volume 437 issue 7055 pages 27<U+2013>9 PMID 16136111</ref><ref>Vermij P (2003) "Europe's last research chimps to retire" ''Nat.

The [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV) raised concerns about primate experiments at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 2002.

Researchers had trained the monkeys to perform certain tasks before inflicting brain damage and re-testing them. The monkeys were only given food and water for two hours a day, to encourage them to perform the tasks. The judge hearing BUAV's application for a judicial review rejected the allegation that the Home Secretary had been negligent in granting the university a license.<ref>

;Columbia University
{{main|Primate experiments at Columbia University}}
CNN reported in October 2003 that a post-doctoral "whistleblowing" [[veterinarian]] at [[Columbia University]] approached the university's [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]] about experiments being carried out by an assistant professor of [[neurosurgery]], E. Sander Connolly. [http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/10/12/columbia.animals.ap] Connolly was allegedly causing strokes in baboons by removing their left [[eyeball]]s and using the [[eye socket]]s to reach a critical [[blood vessel]] to their brains. A clamp was placed on the blood vessel until the stroke was induced, after which Connolly would try to treat the condition with an experimental drug. In a letter to the [[National Institute of Health]], PETA cited the case of a baboon they said was unable to sit up or eat, and remained slouched over in its cage, before dying two days later.<ref>[http://www.columbiacruelty.com/deathSquad_Connolly.asp "E. Sander Connolly"], PETA.</ref> An investigation by the United States Department of Agriculture found the experiments did not violate federal guidelines. Connolly abandoned the research saying he felt under attack after receiving a threatening e-mail, but continued to believe his experiments were humane and potentially valuable.<ref name=CNNOct12>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/10/12/columbia.animals.ap Columbia in animal cruelty dispute"], CNN, October 12, 2003.</ref>

===Threats to researchers===
;University of California, Los Angeles
In 2006, a primate researcher at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists. The researcher had received a grant to use 30 [[macaque]] monkeys for vision experiments; each monkey was paralyzed, then used for a single session that lasted up to 120 hours, and finally killed. The researcher's name, phone number, and address were posted on the website of the [[Primate Freedom Project]]. Demonstrations were held in front of his home. A [[Molotov cocktail]] was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The [[Animal Liberation Front]] claimed responsibility for the attack.<ref> [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/08/22/animal Throwing in the Towel] David Epstein  ''Inside Higher Education, Aug. 22, 2006</ref> As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating "you win," and "please don<U+2019>t bother my family anymore."<ref>[http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&status=article&id=241311597601024 Predators Unleashed] ''Investor's Business Daily'' 24 August 2006</ref> In another incident at UCLA in June 2007, the [[Revolutionary Cells (RCALB)|Animal Liberation Brigade]] placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children's [[ophthalmologist]] who experiments on cats and rhesus monkeys; the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate.<ref>McDonald, Patrick Range. [http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/monkey-madness-at-ucla/16986/ UCLA Monkey Madness] ''LA Weekly'', August 8, 2007.</ref> UCLA is now refusing [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests for animal medical records.

==Alternatives to animal testing==
{{main|Alternatives to animal testing}}
Scientists and governments state that animal testing should cause as little suffering to animals as possible, and that animal tests should only be performed where necessary. The "three Rs"<ref name=Flecknell>{{cite journal |author=Flecknell P |title=Replacement, reduction and refinement |journal=ALTEX |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=73<U+2013>8 |year=2002 |pmid=12098013}}</ref> are guiding [[Moral obligation|principles]] for the use of animals in research in most countries:

*'''Reduction''' refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals.
*'''Replacement''' refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aim. 
*'''Refinement''' refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals still used.<ref>[http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/page.asp?id=7 The 3Rs] The National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research. Accessed 12 December 2007</ref>

Although such principles have been welcomed as a step forwards by some animal welfare groups,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kolar R |title=ECVAM: desperately needed or superfluous? An animal welfare perspective |journal=Altern Lab Anim |volume=30 Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=169<U+2013>74 |year=2002 |pmid=12513669}}</ref> they have also been criticized as both outdated by current research,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schuppli CA, Fraser D, McDonald M |title=Expanding the three Rs to meet new challenges in humane animal experimentation |journal=Altern Lab Anim |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=525<U+2013>32 |year=2004 |pmid=15656775}}</ref> and of little practical effect in improving animal welfare.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rusche B |title=The 3Rs and animal welfare - conflict or the way forward? |journal=ALTEX |volume=20 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=63<U+2013>76 |year=2003 |pmid=14671703}}</ref>
