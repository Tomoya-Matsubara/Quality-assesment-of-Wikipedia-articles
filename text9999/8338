'''Gerard''' (died 21 May 1108) was an English [[clergy]]man who became [[Archbishop of York]] and [[Lord Chancellor]] of England. He was a member of the cathedral clergy at [[Rouen]] before becoming a royal clerk under King [[William I of England]] and his son King [[William II of England|William II Rufus]]. William I named him Chancellor, and he continued in that office under Rufus. Rufus rewarded him by naming him [[Bishop of Hereford]] in 1096. Possibly he was with the king's hunting party when the king was killed, and Gerard certainly witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, [[Henry I of England]]. Soon after Henry's coronation, Gerard was named to the newly vacant [[Diocese of York|see of York]]. 

As archbishop, Gerard became embroiled in the long running dispute between York and the [[Diocese of Canterbury|see of Canterbury]] over which archbishopric had the primacy over England. As part of that dispute, Gerard secured papal recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland. In the [[Investiture Controversy]], Gerard worked towards securing a compromise between the claims of the king and the claims of Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], which was finally agreed to in 1107. Gerard was known for his patronage of learning, even urging one of his clergy to study the [[Hebrew language]]. He also studied astrology, which led to popular rumours that he studied magic. He died suddenly in 1108, and because of the rumours of being a sorcerer, as well as his attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, he was initially refused burial in [[York Minster]], although later his remains were interred there.

Gerard was the nephew of [[Walkelin]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], and [[Simeon (abbot)|Simon, Abbot of Ely]].<ref name=BHOYork>Greenway [http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=8457 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 6: York: List 1: Archbishops]</ref> His parents were Osbert and Anna,<ref name=DNB>Burton "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10547  Gerard (d. 1108)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> and his brother Peter was also a royal clerk.<ref name=Rufus409>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 409</ref> Where he was born and raised is not known, but he was recorded as a [[precentor]] in [[Rouen]] cathedral,<ref name=Rufus59>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 59</ref><ref name=BHOHere/> of which he had become [[archdeacon]] by 1091.<ref name=BHOHere>Barrow [http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=34422 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops]</ref> He served in the royal chancery under successive kings of England, William I and William II.<ref name=BHOHere/>

==Bishop of Hereford==

Gerard served as Lord Chancellor from 1085 to 1092<ref name=Handbook83>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 83</ref> and was present at William I's deathbed.<ref name=Douglas359>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 359</ref> He continued as Chancellor to William Rufus until 1092, but it is unclear what caused his loss of office.<ref name=Rufus96>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 96</ref> He retained the king's trust, for Rufus employed him in 1095 along with [[William Warelwast]] on a diplomatic mission to Pope [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]] regarding Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] receiving the [[pallium]], the sign of an archbishop's authority.  Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than Antipope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement III]] in return for delivering Anselm's pallium into Rufus' custody, to dispose as he saw fit, as well as securing the deposition of Anselm by the pope. The embassy departed for the pope in February 1095 and returned by [[Whitsun]], with a papal legate, [[Walter of Albano|Walter]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano|bishop of Albano]], who had Anselm's pallium.  The legate secured Rufus' recognition of Urban, but afterwards refused to consider the deposition of Anselm. Rufus then dropped the idea of having Anselm deposed, and at the king's court at Windsor, Rufus consented to Anselm receiving the pallium.<ref name=Vaughn186>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' pp. 186<U+2013>189</ref>

[[Image:Death of William Rufus.JPG|left|thumb|Death of William II, as depicted in ''Ridpath's Universal History'', copyright 1895. Gerard may have been present with the hunting party when the king died.]]
Gerard was rewarded with the [[Bishop of Hereford|Bishopric of Hereford]],<ref name=BHOHere/> and he was [[consecration|consecrated]] by Archbishop Anselm on 8 June 1096.<ref name=Handbook250>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 250</ref> His ordination as a  [[deacon]] and [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] had taken place the previous day.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Bartlett378>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 378</ref> He assisted at the consecration of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] on 9 June 1096.<ref name=BHOHere/> He may have been present with the hunting party in the [[New Forest]] on the day of Rufus' death, for Gerard witnessed the coronation charter of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] issued three days after Rufus' death.<ref name=Rufus420>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 420</ref> Gerard also was present at Henry's coronation on 5 August 1100, along with [[Maurice (Archdeacon of Le Mans)|Maurice, Bishop of London]]. Henry probably was crowned by Maurice, but the medieval chronicler [[Walter Map]] states that Gerard crowned Henry, in return for the promise of the first vacant archbishopric. Gerard probably assisted Maurice in the coronation ceremony.<ref name=Cantor135>Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' pp. 135<U+2013>136</ref>

==Archbishop==

In December 1100, Gerard was made [[Archbishop of York]].<ref name=Handbook281>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 281</ref> No source mentions Gerard being [[Investiture Controversy|invested]] by the king, and as Anselm urged Pope [[Pope Paschal II|Paschal II]] to give Gerard his pallium, it is difficult to see Anselm doing so if Gerard had been invested by Henry.<ref name=Vaughn222>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' p. 222 footnote 36</ref> At [[Whitsun]] in 1101 King Henry I, with Anselm's support, deprived [[Ranulf Flambard]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], of the lands of the see of Durham, because Ranulf had defected to Henry's brother [[Robert Curthose]]. Gerard then deposed Ranulf from his bishopric.<ref name=HenryI135>Hollister ''Henry I'' pp. 135<U+2013>136</ref>  Soon after his translation to York, Gerard began a long contest with Anselm, in which he claimed equal primacy with [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and refused to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long [[Canterbury-York dispute]]. At the [[Synods of Westminster|Council of Westminster]] in 1102, Gerard is reported to have kicked over the smaller chair that was provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with a chair as large as Anselm's.<ref name=Church43>Barlow ''The English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 43</ref> When he travelled to [[Rome]] in 1102, to receive his pallium,<ref name=BHOYork/> he also presented the king's side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding [[investiture]]s.<ref name=Vaughn239>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' p. 239</ref> The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops claimed that the pope had assured them that the decrees would not be enforced. That was denied by Anselm's representatives, and the pope,<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Church299>Barlow ''The English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' pp. 299<U+2013>300</ref> who [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Gerard until he recanted the statement.<ref name=Church301>Barlow ''The English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 301</ref>

Gerard had also secured from the pope a recognition that York was the metropolitan see for the Scots.{{#tag:ref|Paschal II's letter to the Scots bishops is the earliest known papal letter to Scotland<ref>Broun "Church of St. Andrews" p. 113</ref>|group=notes}} Later, Gerard consecrated Roger as [[Bishop of Orkney]], but refused to consecrate [[Thurgot]] to the [[Archbishop of St Andrews|see of St Andrews]] because Thurgot would not recognise the primacy of York. Gerard attempted to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines, and become ordained priests. He also gave generously to the monasteries of his diocese; the medieval chronicler [[Hugh Sottovagina|Hugh the Chantor]] stated that Thomas II, Gerard's successor, accused Gerard of having dissipated the diocese's endowment.<ref name=DNB/> King [[Olaf I of the Isle of Man|Olaf I]] of Man and the Isles wrote to "G", archbishop of York, asking for the consecration of "our bishop" by York, but that consecration does not appear to have taken place under Gerard or his successor.<ref name=Watt110>Watt "Bishops of the Isles" pp. 110<U+2013>111</ref>{{#tag:ref|Olaf had been in exile in England and is likely to have met Gerard there.<ref name=Watt110/>|group=notes}}

During the first four years of Henry's reign, Gerard was one of the king's chief advisors, along with [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert of Meulan]], [[Counts of Meulan|Count of Meulan]] in Normandy and later [[Earl of Leicester]]. Gerard was one of Henry's greatest supporters among the bishops over the [[Investiture Controversy|Investiture Crisis]].<ref name=Cantor238>Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' pp. 238<U+2013>249</ref> After Gerard's return from Rome, he restored [[Ranulf Flambard]] to the [[Bishop of Durham|see of Durham]].<ref name=DNB/> In 1102, after Anselm had refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king, Gerard offered to consecrate them, but two refused.<ref name=Cantor166>Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' pp. 166<U+2013>167</ref> After 1105, Gerard slowly began to support the papal position on investiture of bishops, and withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105, Gerard attempted to join [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Antioch]] who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure. Gerard then worked to craft a compromise in the Investiture Crisis, and by 1107, King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement.<ref name=Cantor238/>

Gerard then agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that his profession made to Anselm when he was consecrated Bishop of Hereford would continue in force. Gerard did so at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office.<ref name=Vaughn334>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' pp. 334<U+2013>336</ref> Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Anselm's death.<ref name=DNB/>

==Death and legacy==

The medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] charged Gerard with immorality, avarice, and the practice of magic. Gerard was associated with the author of the ''[[Quadripartitus]]'' and the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'', two 12th-century law books.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Church72>Barlow ''The English Church 1066<U+2013>1154 p. 72</ref> He also encouraged at least one of his clergy to study [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] which was not a language normally studied at the time.<ref name=Church247>Barlow ''The English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 247</ref> Some chroniclers considered his ownership of a Hebrew [[psalter]] to be disturbing, seeing this as a sign of heresy or secret Judaism. Among the sins that William of Malmesbury imputed to him was the study of [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]] every morning, which to Malmesbury meant that Gerard was a sorcerer.<ref name=Church259>Barlow ''The English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 259</ref> William of Malmesbury also held that Gerard was "lewd and lustful".<ref name=DNB/> In Gerard's favor, Anselm regarded him as learned and very intelligent.<ref name=Cantor238/>

Gerard died suddenly on 21 May 1108,<ref name=Handbook281/> at [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]],<ref name=BHOYork/> on his way to [[London]] to attend a council. His body was found in an orchard, next to a book of "curious arts",<ref name=Church259/> his copy of Julius Firmicus.<ref name=DNB/> His canons refused to allow his burial within his cathedral,<ref name=Church72/> but their hostility probably owed more to Gerard's attempts to reform their lifestyle than to his alleged interest in sorcery. Gerard was at first buried beside the porch at [[York Minster]], but his successor, Thomas, moved the remains inside the cathedral church.<ref name=DNB/>
