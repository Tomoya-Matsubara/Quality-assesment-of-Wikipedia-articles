In his formative years, Brecker studied trumpet with [[William Adam (trumpeter)|Bill Adam]] at Indiana University.

==Early Life==

Born in 1945 in [[Philadelphia]] to a musical family, he attended [[Indiana University]] from 1963 to 1966 studying with [[William Adam (trumpeter)|Bill Adam]], [[David Baker (composer)|David Baker]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/arts/alan-pasqua-peter-erskin-iu-jazz-david-beker/|title=Alan Pasqua And Peter Erskine On IU Jazz And David Baker|publisher=Indiana Public Media|date=April 25, 2012|first=David|last=Wood|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref> and Jerry Coker and later moved to New York and performed with [[Clark Terry]]<U+2019>s Big Bad Band, the [[Duke Pearson]] and the [[The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra]].

==Career==
In 1967, Randy ventured into jazz-rock with the band [[Blood, Sweat and Tears]], recording their first album ''[[Child Is Father to the Man]]'', but left to join the [[Horace Silver Quintet]]. He recorded his first solo album, ''Score<U+2019>', in 1968, featuring [[Michael Brecker]].

After Horace Silver, Randy joined [[Art Blakey]]<U+2019>s Jazz Messengers before teaming up with brother Michael, [[Barry Rogers]], [[Billy Cobham]], and [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]] to form the fusion group [[Dreams (band)|Dreams]]. The group recorded two albums: ''Dreams'' and <U+2018>'Imagine My Surprise<U+2019>'  for [[Columbia Records]] before they disbanded in 1971.

In the early 1970s, Randy performed live with many artists including [[The Eleventh House], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Billy Cobham]]. He also recorded several albums with his brother under pianist/composer [[Hal Galper]].

By 1975, Randy and Michael formed the [[Brecker Brothers]] band. They released six albums on [[Arista Records|Arista]] and garnered seven Grammy nominations between 1975 and 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theamiagency.com/bio/brecker-brothers-reunion-group|title=Brecker Brothers Band Reunion|publisher=[[Addeo Music International]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>  Their first record featured Randy<U+2019>s composition "Some Skunk Funk".

After the Brecker Brothers disbanded in 1982, Randy recorded and toured as a member of [[Jaco Pastorius]]' Word of Mouth big band. It was soon thereafter that he met and later married Brazilian jazz pianist [[Eliane Elias]]. Eliane and Randy formed their own band, touring the world several times and recording one album together, ''Amanda'' on [[Passport Records]].

In 1992 Randy and Michael reunited for a world tour and the triple-Grammy nominated GRP recording <U+2018>'The Return of the Brecker Brothers<U+2019>'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.net/newyork/schedule/moreinfo.cgi?id=10140|title=THE BRECKER BROTHERS BAND REUNION with RANDY BRECKER, MIKE STERN, & More|publisher=[[Blue Note Jazz Club|Blue Note New York]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>  The follow-up, 1994<U+2019>s <U+2018>'[[Out of the Loop (Brecker Brothers album)|Out of the Loop]]'', was a double-Grammy winner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/out-of-the-loop-mw0000121287/awards|title=''Out of the Loop'': Awards|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

In 1997, ''[[Into the Sun (Randy Brecker album)|Into the Sun]]'' (Concord), a recording featuring Brecker's impressions of Brazil, garnered Brecker his first Grammy as a solo artist.

In 2001, Randy released <U+2018>'Hangin<U+2019> in the City<U+2019>' (ESC), a solo project that introduced his alter-ego Randroid with lyrics and vocals by Randroid himself. This CD was released in Europe, [where Randy toured extensively with his own line-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.songkick.com/artists/271670-randy-brecker/gigography|title=Randy Brecker|publisher=[[Songkick]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

Randy<U+2019>s next CD for ESC Records, ''[[34th N Lex]]'', won him his third Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album in 2003. That summer he went back to Europe with the [Bill Evans (saxophonist)|]] Soulbop Band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=21930|title=Soulbop Band Live: Bill Evans / Randy Brecker Soulbop Band|publisher=[[All About Jazz]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

In the summer of 2003 the Brecker Brothers appeared in [[Japan]] at the [[Mount Fuji Jazz Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelbrecker.com/oldWebsite/scroll3.htm|title=Michael Brecker's Tour Schedule|work=Michael Brecker's official website|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

2004 saw Randy touring Europe as co-leader (with Bill Evans) of the band Soulbop. The WDR Big Band also invited Randy to perform at the [Jazz Fest]. The date was of significance to Randy as it was the last time he played with his brother, who took ill shortly thereafter with a rare form of leukemia known as [[Myelodysplastic syndrome|MDS]].

In 2005, Brecken's wife Ada sat in for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=45714&width=&page=1|title=Randy Brecker: A Fusion Legacy|publisher=[[All About Jazz]]|date=November 4, 2013|first=R. J.|last=DeLuke|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref> Brecker's schedule continued with the Randy Brecker Band performing throughout Eastern Europe.

In 2007, [Randy was awarded his fourth Grammy for ''Randy Brecker Live with the WDR Big Band'' (Telarc/BHM), the live recording (also available in DVD format) of his performance with Michael at the Leverkusen Jazz Fest in 2004.<ref name="grammy">{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22randy+brecker%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All&=Search|title=Randy Brecker|publisher=[[The Recording Academy]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref> Michael died that same year on January 13.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/nyregion/14brecker.html?_r=0|title=Michael Brecker Dies at 57; Prolific Jazz Saxophonist|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 14, 2007|first=Ben|last=Ratliff|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

2007 also saw the release of a two-CD set of live recordings of the band Soulbop (BHM) featuring [[Dave Kikoski]], [[Victor Bailey (musician)|Victor Bailey]], [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]], Rodney Holmes and []Hiram Bullock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=23108#.Uuj-E2eQ-md|title=Bill Evans / Randy Brecker: Soul Bop Band Live|publisher=[[All About Jazz]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

Brecker returned to Brazilian music in 2008 for the album <U+2018>'Randy in Brazil<U+2019>', which was recorded in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] with Brazilian musicians and released on [[Summit Records]]. Chosen one of the top 10 CDs of 2008 by [[All About Jazz]], the CD won the Grammy for "Best Contemporary Jazz Album", bringing his Grammy total to five.<ref name="grammy"/>

A ''Tribute to the Brecker Brothers'' featuring Randy and recorded live at the  Hamamatsu Jazz Festival in Japan with Yoichi Murata<U+2019>s Solid Brass & Big Band was released by [[JVC Victor]] in Japan in late 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://b.hamptons.com/The-Arts/Live-Music-View/15327/Sag-Harbor-American-Music-Festival-Inaugural.html#.Un0d9vkm28A|title=Sag Harbor American Music Festival Inaugural Concert And Fundraiser|publisher=Hamptons Online|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

in 2009, Brecker released <U+2018>'Jazz Suite Tykocin<U+2019>', a project initiated and conceived by the Polish pianist and composer W<U+0142>odek Pawlik, featuring Randy as a soloist with members of the Bialystok Philharmonic. [[Tykocin]] is the area in Poland where Brkecken's ancestors (mother<U+2019>s maiden name: Tecosky) hail from, a fact that Pawlik discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/news/nov09.html|title=Pawlik & Brecker's nostalgic journey|work=Polish Music Newsletter|date=November 2009|accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref>

2011 saw the release of <U+2018>'The Jazz Ballad Song Book: Randy Brecker with the Danish Radio Big Band and The Danish National Chamber Orchestra<U+2019>', which garnered four Grammy nominations and critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/exploring-the-grammys-jazz-field-nominees|title=Exploring the Grammys' jazz field nominees|publisher=[[The Recording Academy]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref> In 2012, [[Legacy Recordings]] released the boxed set''The Brecker Brothers <U+2013> The Complete Arista Albums Collection''.

A Brecker Brothers Band Reunion tour of European festivals in the summer of 2013 supported Brecker<U+2019>s ''Brecker Brothers Band Reunion'', a dual-disk project which was released on September 25, 2013 on Piloo Records. It features a live DVD recorded at the [[Blue Note Jazz Club|Blue Note in New York City]] with a new 11-song studio recording featuring members of the Brecker Brothers bands from throughout the years including [[David Sanborn]], [[Mike Stern]], [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]], and [[Dave Weckl]]. [[George Whitty]] produced the album, and Brecker's wife Ada Rovatti also played saxophone. The recording was released in North America by Magenta/E-One, in Europe by Moosicus Records in November and in Japan by Victor. It is dedicated to his brother, Michael, and other departed Brecker Brothers Band members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moosicus.com/brecker-brothers-band-reunion/|title=Brecker Brothers Band Reunion|publisher=Moosicus Records|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.net/newyork/schedule/moreinfo.cgi?id=9220|title=The Brecker Brothers band reunion with Randy Brecker, Mike Stern, Dave Weckl & more|publisher=[[Blue Note Jazz Club|Blue Note New York]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>
