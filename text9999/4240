'''Charles Henry Holden''' [[Doctor of Letters|Litt. D.]] [[Royal Institute of British Architects|FRIBA]] [[Royal Town Planning Institute|MRTPI]] [[Royal Designers for Industry|RDI]] (12 May 1875 <U+2013> 1 May 1960) was a [[Bolton]]-born [[English people|English]] [[architect]] best known for designing many [[London Underground]] stations during the 1920s and 1930s, for [[Bristol Central Library]], the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]]'s headquarters at [[55 Broadway]] and for the [[University of London]]'s [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]]. He also created many war cemeteries in Belgium and northern France for the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Imperial War Graves Commission]].

After working and training in [[Bolton]] and [[Manchester]], Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], but for most of his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing.{{#tag:ref|In architecture, "form" refers to the geometric shapes from which a building's basic design is composed; "massing" refers to the size of the shapes, their bulk and the way in which they are grouped together.|group="note"}} He  believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by the intended functions of buildings. After the [[First World War]] he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and [[modern architecture|modernist]], influenced by European architecture. Holden was a member of the [[Design and Industries Association]] and the [[Art Workers' Guild]]. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.

Although not without its critics, his architecture is widely appreciated. He was awarded the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]' (RIBA's) [[Royal Gold Medal]] for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a [[Royal Designers for Industry|Royal Designer for Industry]] in 1943. His station designs for London Underground became the corporation's design standard influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s. Many of his buildings have been granted [[listed building]] status, protecting them from unapproved alteration. Modestly believing that architecture was a collaborative effort, he twice declined the offer of a [[Knighthood]].

==Early life==
Charles Holden was born on 12 May 1875 at [[Great Lever]], [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]]; he was the fifth and youngest child of Joseph Holden (1842<U+2013>1918), a [[draper]] and [[Hatmaking|milliner]], and Ellen Holden ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Broughton, 1841<U+2013>1890). Holden's childhood was marred by his father's bankruptcy in 1884 and his mother's death when he was fifteen years old.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=23<U+2013>25}}<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=25312 |startpage=412 |endpage=413 |date=25 January 1884 |accessdate=6 August 2010}}</ref> Following the loss of his father's business, the family moved {{convert|15|mi|km}} to [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] (now in [[Merseyside]]) where his father returned to his earlier trade and worked as an [[turning|iron turner]] and [[Machinist|fitter]] and where Charles Holden attended a number of schools.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=23<U+2013>25}}

He briefly had jobs as a laboratory assistant and a railway clerk in St Helens. During this period he attended [[technical drawing|draughting]] classes at the [[YMCA]] and considered a career as an engineer in [[Charles Douglas Fox|Sir Douglas Fox's]] practice.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=26}} In 1891 he began working for his brother-in-law, David Frederick Green, a [[Civil engineering#Surveying|land surveyor]] and architect in Bolton.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=28}} In April 1892 he was [[articled clerk|articled]] to Manchester architect Everard W Leeson and, while training with him, also studied at the [[Manchester School of Art]] (1893<U+2013>94) and [[Manchester Technical School]] (1894<U+2013>96).{{#tag:ref|Holden took one class at Manchester School of Art in "Architectural History" (grade: excellent). At Manchester Technical School he took classes in "Brickwork and Masonry" and "Building Construction and Drawing" (first class honours in both).<ref>{{harvnb|Karol|2007|pp=53 & 55}}</ref>|group="note"}} Holden was an excellent student and was even put in charge of teaching a class.{{sfn|Powers|2007}}

While working and studying in Manchester, Holden formed friendships with artist [[Muirhead Bone]] and his future brother-in-law [[Francis Dodd]].{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=32}} About this time Holden was introduced to the writings of [[Walt Whitman]] and became friends with James William Wallace and a number of the members of Bolton's Whitman society known as the "[[Eagle Street College]]".{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=32}} Whitman's writings and those of [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Edward Carpenter]] were major influences on Holden's life.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=32}} He incorporated many of their philosophies and principles into his style of living and method of working.{{sfn|McCarthy|1981|p=146}}

In 1895 and 1896 Holden submitted designs to ''Building News'' Designing Club competitions using the pseudonym "The Owl".{{#tag:ref|The pseudonym was chosen to reflect his working on the designs at night, sometimes until 3 or 4 o'clock.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=58}}|group="note"}} Although the number of competing submissions made was not always large, from nine competition entries, Holden won five first places, three second places and one third place.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=58}}{{sfn|Allinson|2008|p=308}} In 1897, he entered the competition for the RIBA's prestigious Soane Medallion for student architects. Of fourteen entries, Holden's submission for the competition's subject, a "Provincial Market Hall", came third.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=64}} Holden described the design as being inspired by the work of [[John Belcher (architect)|John Belcher]], [[Edgar Wood]] and [[Arthur Beresford Pite]].<ref>Holden, draft letter to [[John Betjeman]], quoted in {{Harvnb|Karol|2007|p=65}}.</ref>

==Family life==
Around 1898 Holden began living with Margaret Steadman (n<U+00E9>e Macdonald, 1865<U+2013>1954), a nurse and midwife. They were introduced by Holden's older sister, Alice, and became friends through their common interest in Whitman.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=46<U+2013>47}} Steadman had separated from her husband James Steadman, a university tutor, because of his alcoholism and abuse.<ref name="K47">{{harvnb|Karol|2007|p=47}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|According to a letter from Muirhead Bone to his future wife Gertrude Dodd, James Steadman was twice imprisoned: in Edinburgh for living on the earnings of a prostitute and in Liverpool for embezzlement.<ref>Bone, Muirhead (16 January 1902), letter to Gertrude Dodd, quoted in {{harvnb|Karol|2007|p=47}}.</ref>|group="note"}} Steadman and her husband were never divorced and, though she and Holden lived as a married couple and Holden referred to her as his wife, the relationship was never formalised, even after James Steadman's death in 1930.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=47<U+2013>48}}

The Holdens lived in suburban [[Norbiton]], [[Surrey]] (now [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]]) until 1902, when they moved to [[Codicote]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. Around 1906, they moved to Harmer Green near [[Welwyn]], where Holden designed a house for them.{{sfn|Hutton|Crawford|2007}} The house was plainly furnished and the couple lived a simple life, described by Janet Asbee in 1906 as "bananas and brown bread on the table; no hot water; plain living and high thinking and strenuous activity for the betterment of the World".<ref>Ashbee journals (24 June 1906), quoted in {{harvnb|Hutton|Crawford|2007}}</ref> The couple had no children together, though Margaret had a son, Allan, from her marriage.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=46}}{{#tag:ref|Allan Steadman changed his surname to Holden by [[deed poll]] in 1918.<ref name="K47">{{harvnb|Karol|2007|p=47}}.</ref>|group="note"}} Charles and Margaret Holden lived at Harmer Green for the rest of their lives.{{sfn|Hutton|Crawford|2007}}

==Works==
===Early career===
[[File:Belgrave Hospital for Children.jpg|thumb|alt=A large red brick building with steep slate covered roofs|Belgrave Hospital for Children]]
Holden left Leeson's practice in 1896 and worked for Jonathan Simpson in Bolton in 1896 and 1897, working on house designs there and at [[Port Sunlight]],{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=51<U+2013>52}} before moving to London to work for [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] designer [[Charles Robert Ashbee]]. His time with Ashbee was short and, in October 1899, he became chief assistant in H. Percy Adams' practice, where he remained for the rest of his career.{{sfn|Hutton|Crawford|2007}}

A number of Holden's early designs were for hospitals, which Adams' practice specialised in. At this early stage in his career, he produced designs in a variety of architectural styles as circumstances required, reflecting the influences of a number of architects.{{sfn|Hutton|Crawford|2007}} Holden soon took charge of most of the practice's design work.{{sfn|Pevsner|1975|p=386}} From 1900 to 1903, Holden also studied architecture in the evenings at the [[Royal Academy School]].{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=56}} He also continued to produce designs in his spare time for his brother-in-law and Jonathan Simpson.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=149}}

His red brick arts and craft fa<U+00E7>ades for the Belgrave Hospital for Children in [[Kennington]], south London (1900<U+2013>03), were influenced by [[Philip Webb]] and [[Henry Wilson (architect and designer)|Henry Wilson]] and feature steeply pitched roofs, corner towers and stone window surrounds.{{sfn|Sheppard|1956|pp=106<U+2013>08}}{{sfn|Stevens Curl|2006}} The building, now converted to apartments, is [[Grade II listed|Grade II* listed]].{{sfn|Powers|2007}}<ref>{{IoE|204143}}, [[English Heritage]], Retrieved 25 September 2010.</ref>

In 1902, Holden won the [[architectural competition]] to design the [[Bristol Central Library]]. His [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] fa<U+00E7>ades in [[bath stone]] incorporate [[Modern architecture|modernist]] elements complementing the adjacent [[Great Gatehouse, Bristol|Abbey Gate]] of [[Bristol Cathedral]]. The front fa<U+00E7>ade features [[oriel window]]s and sculpture groups with [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Bede]] and [[Alfred the Great]] by Charles Pibworth.<ref name=IoE_BCL>{{IoE|379311}}, [[English Heritage]], Retrieved 25 September 2010.</ref>{{sfn|Foyle|Cherry|Pevsner|2004|pp=76<U+2013>77}} Internally, the design is classical, with the furniture designed by Holden and the stone carving mostly by William Aumonier.{{sfn|Foyle|Cherry|Pevsner|2004|p=75}} It was described by architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]] as "free Neo-Tudor" and "extremely pretty" and by [[Andor Harvey Gomme|Andor Gomme]] as "one of the great masterpieces of the early Modern Movement".<ref name=IoE_BCL/>{{sfn|Pevsner|1975|p=388}} It has been compared with [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]'s [[Glasgow School of Art]] and it is sometimes suggested that Mackintosh's designs for the later part of the school were inspired by Holden's,{{sfn|Powers|2007}} although Pevsner noted that Mackintosh's designs were in circulation earlier.{{sfn|Pevsner|1975|p=388}} The building is Grade I listed.<ref name=IoE_BCL/>

[[File:Chapel at King Edward VII Sanatorium, Midhurst.jpg|thumb|alt=Two colonnaded wings branch diagonally each side from a squat central steeple|V-shaped chapel of King Edward VII Sanatorium ([[:File:Chapel plan annotated.jpg|plan]])]]
At [[Midhurst]], [[West Sussex]], Holden designed Tudor-style fa<U+00E7>ades for the [[Ernest Cassel|Sir Ernest Cassel]]-funded King Edward VII Sanatorium (1903<U+2013>06). The building features long wings of south-facing rooms to maximise patients' exposure to sunlight and fresh air.

For [[The Law Society]] he designed (1902<U+2013>04) a simplified [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] extension to the existing [[Lewis Vulliamy]]-designed building in [[Chancery Lane]] with external sculptures by Charles Pibworth and a panelled arts and crafts interior with carving by William Aumonier and friezes by [[Conrad Dressler]].{{sfn|Powers|2007}}{{sfn|Ward-Jackson|2003|p=80}}<ref>{{IoE|209062}}, [[English Heritage]], Retrieved 25 September 2010.</ref> Pevsner considered the fa<U+00E7>ades to be [[Mannerism|Mannerist]]: "The fashionable term Mannerism can here be used legitimately; for Holden indeed froze up and invalidated current classical [[motif (visual arts)|motifs]], which is what Mannerist architects did in the [[Cinquecento]]."{{sfn|Pevsner|1975|p=391}}

In 1906, Holden won the architectural competition to design a new headquarters for the [[British Medical Association]] on the corner of [[Strand, London|The Strand]] and Agar Street (now [[Embassy of Zimbabwe, London|Zimbabwe House]]). The six-storey L-shaped building replaced a collection of buildings on the site already occupied by the Association and provided it with accommodation for a council chamber, library and offices on the upper floors above space for shops on the ground floor and in the basement.<ref name=bmj02>{{cite journal |title=The British Medical Association, The New Offices |work=[[BMJ|The British Medical Journal]] |date=7 December 1907 |accessdate=18 August 2010|pages=pp. 1661<U+2013>64 |pmc=2356978 |pmid=20763579}}</ref> Described by Powers as "classicism reduced to geometric shapes",{{sfn|Powers|2007}} the first three storeys are clad in grey Cornish granite with [[Portland stone]] above.{{#tag:ref|Holden considered Portland stone "the only stone that washes itself", capable of withstanding London's then [[smog]]gy atmosphere.{{sfn|Karol|2008|pp=6<U+2013>7}}|group=note}} Located at second floor level was a controversial series of {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} tall sculptures representing the development of science and the ages of man by [[Jacob Epstein]].{{sfn|Powers|2007}}<ref name=bmj03>{{cite journal |title=The Association's New Building |work=[[BMJ|The British Medical Journal]] |date=4 July 1908 |accessdate=3 September 2010 |pages=pp. 40<U+2013>43 |pmc=2436923 |pmid=20763951}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The controversy centred on the supposed shocking nakedness of the statues, but Epstein's sculptures were supported by many leaders of the artistic establishment.<ref name=bmj03/> In the 1930s, after the building had been sold to the government of [[Southern Rhodesia]], the sculptures were defaced, supposedly to prevent pieces falling off.|group=note}} The building is Grade II* listed.<ref>{{IoE|428225}}, [[English Heritage]], Retrieved 25 September 2010.</ref> Alastair Service considered it "perhaps his best London building".{{sfn|Service|1977|p=112}}

In 1909, Holden won the design competition for an extension to the [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]]. Subsequently dedicated to the memory of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] (died 1910), the extension (1911<U+2013>12) was built on steeply sloping ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around a courtyard. The plain, abstract blocks have towers on the corners and two-storey [[loggia]]s, and are a further simplification of Holden's style.{{sfn|Foyle|Cherry|Pevsner|2004|pp=150<U+2013>51}} {{#tag:ref|Today, the adjacent 1960s hospital extension hides most of Holden's building from view.|group="note"}}

The practice became Adams & Holden in 1907 when Holden became a partner and Adams, Holden & Pearson when Lionel Pearson became a partner in 1913.{{sfn|Powers|2007}} In 1913, Holden was awarded the RIBA's Godwin medal and <U+00A3>65 to study architecture abroad. He travelled to America in April 1913 and studied the organisation of household and social science departments at American universities in preparation for his design of the [[Christopher Wren|Wren-influenced]] [[Queen Elizabeth College|Kings College for Women]], [[Kensington]].{{sfn|Powers|2007}}{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=196<U+2013>97}} Other buildings by Holden before the First World War include modernist office buildings in [[Holborn]]<ref>{{IoE|478240}}, [[English Heritage]], Retrieved 25 September 2010.</ref> and [[Oxford Street]],<ref>{{IoE|422458}}, [[English Heritage]], Retrieved 25 September 2010.</ref> an extension in red brick of [[Alfred Waterhouse]]'s Shire Hall in [[Bedford]],<ref>{{IoE|35563}}, [[English Heritage]], Retrieved 25 September 2010.</ref> and Arts and Crafts [[Sutton Valence School]], Kent.{{sfn|Powers|2007}} Holden also worked with Epstein on the tomb of [[Oscar Wilde]] at [[P<U+00E8>re Lachaise cemetery]] in Paris (1911<U+2013>12).{{sfn|Stevens Curl|2006}} In 1915, Holden was a founding member of the [[Design and Industries Association]] and he was a member of the [[Art Workers' Guild]] from 1917.{{sfn|Powers|2007}} Unsuccessful competition entries for which Holden produced designs include Strathclyde Royal Infirmary (1901), [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]] (1904), [[County Hall, London|County Hall]] (1907), the [[National Library of Wales]] (1909), Coventry Town Hall (1911) and the [[Board of Trade]] building (1915).{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=481<U+2013>82}}

===War cemeteries and memorials===
The Holdens shared a strong sense of personal duty and service. In the First World War, Margaret Holden joined the "Friends' Emergency Committee for the Assistance of Germans, Austrians and Hungarians in distress" which helped refugees of those countries stranded in London by the conflict. Charles Holden served with the [[British Red Cross|Red Cross]]'s London Ambulance Column as a stretcher-bearer transferring wounded troops from London's stations to its hospitals. Holden also served on the fire watch at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] between 1915 and 1917.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=207<U+2013>08}}

On 3 October 1917, Holden was appointed a temporary lieutenant with the army's Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30342 |startpage=10744 |supp=yes |date=16 October 1917 |accessdate=4 September 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=209}} He travelled to the French battlefields for the first time later that month and began planning new cemeteries and expanding existing ones.{{sfn|Geurst|2010|p=47}} Holden described his experience:

<blockquote>The country is one vast wilderness, blasted out of recognition where once villages & orchards & fertile land, now tossed about & churned in hopeless disorder with never a landmark as far as the eye can reach & dotted about in the scrub and untidiness of it all are to be seen here & there singly & in groups little white crosses marking the place where men have fallen and been buried.<ref>Holden (29 October 1917), letter to James Wallace, quoted in {{harvnb|Karol|2007|p=209}}.</ref></blockquote>

Through his involvement with the Design and Industries Association Holden met [[Frank Pick]], general manager of the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] (UERL).{{sfn|Powers|2007}} Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/VARIBAArchitecturePartnershipexhibitions/UndergroundJourneys/FitnessforPurpose/FitnessforPurpose.aspx |title=Underground Journeys: Fitness for Purpose |publisher= [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] |accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a fa<U+00E7>ade for a side entrance at [[Westminster tube station]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=96}} This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the [[British Empire Exhibition]].{{sfn|Orsini|2010}} Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the [[City and South London Railway]] (now part of the [[Northern line]]) from [[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]] to [[Morden tube station|Morden]]. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, [[Stanley Heaps]], which Pick had found unsatisfactory.{{sfn|Orsini|2010}} The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations.{{sfn|Powers|2007}} The screens feature the [[London Underground#The roundel|Underground roundel]] made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised Heaps on new fa<U+00E7>ades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at [[Bond Street tube station|Bond Street station]] on the [[Central London Railway]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=96}}

During the later 1920s, Holden designed a series of replacement buildings and new fa<U+00E7>ades for station improvements around the UERL's network. Many of these featured Portland stone cladding and variations of the glazed screens developed for the Morden extension.{{#tag:ref|Holden's station work of this period includes new buildings at [[West Kensington tube station|West Kensington]] and, with Stanley Heaps, at [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow West]] and [[Ealing Common tube station|Ealing Common]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=99}} New entrances or fa<U+00E7>ades were designed for [[Mansion House tube station|Mansion House]], [[Archway tube station|Archway]], [[St. Paul's tube station|St. Paul's]], [[Green Park tube station|Green Park]] and [[Holborn tube station|Holborn]].{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=484}} Subsequent reconstructions mean that only West Kensington, Hounslow West, Ealing Common and Holborn remain.|group=note}} At [[Piccadilly Circus tube station|Piccadilly Circus]], one of the busiest stations on the system, Holden designed (1925<U+2013>28) a spacious [[travertine]]-lined circulating concourse and ticket hall below the roadway of the junction from which banks of escalators gave access to the platforms below.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=98}}

In 1926, Holden began the design of a new headquarters for the UERL at [[55 Broadway]] above [[St. James's Park tube station|St. James's Park station]]. Above the first floor,<!-- UK English - this is the first floor above ground --> the [[structural steel|steel-framed]] building was constructed to a [[cruciform]] plan and rises in a series of receding stages to a central clock tower {{convert|175|ft|m}} tall.<ref name="55 Broadway">{{IoE|208839}}, [[English Heritage]], Retrieved 25 September 2010.</ref> The arrangement maximises daylight to the building's interior without the use of [[light well]]s.

Holden again detailed the fa<U+00E7>ades with commissioned sculptures; [[:File:JacobEpstein DayAndNight.jpg|''Day'' and ''Night'']], two compositions by Epstein, are at first floor level, and a series of eight [[bas-relief]]s at the seventh floor represent the [[Anemoi|four winds]] (two for each of the [[cardinal direction]]s, on each side of the projecting wings).{{#tag:ref|The nudity of the Epstein figures again generated controversy, though these have avoided mutilation.

In 1930, Holden and Pick made a tour of Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden to see the latest developments in modern architecture.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=99}} The UERL was planning extensions of the [[Piccadilly line]] to the west, north-west and north of London, and a new type of station was wanted. Adapting the architectural styles he had seen on the tour, Holden created functional designs composed of simple forms: cylinders, curves and rectangles, built in plain brick, concrete and glass. The extensions to the west and north-west were over existing routes operated by the [[District line]] and required a number of stations to be rebuilt to accommodate additional tracks or to replace original, basic buildings. [[Sudbury Town tube station|Sudbury Town]], the first station to be rebuilt in 1931, formed a template for many of the other new stations that followed: a tall rectangular brick box with a concrete flat roof and panels of vertical glazing to allow light into the interior. The Grade II listed building was described by Pevsner as "an outstanding example of how satisfying such unpretentious buildings can be, purely through the use of careful details and good proportions."{{sfn|Cherry|Pevsner|1991|p=140}}{{#tag:ref|Holden called them his "brick boxes with concrete lids".{{sfn|Orsini|2010}} The Sudbury Town pattern was reproduced with adaptations at [[Acton Town tube station|Acton Town]], [[Alperton tube station|Alperton]], [[Eastcote tube station|Eastcote]], [[Northfields tube station|Northfields]], [[Oakwood tube station|Oakwood]], [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayners Lane]], [[Sudbury Hill tube station|Sudbury Hill]] and [[Turnpike Lane tube station|Turnpike Lane]].|group=note}}

For [[Arnos Grove tube station|Arnos Grove station]], one of eight new stations on the northern extension of the line, Holden modified the rectangular box into a circular drum, a design inspired by [[Gunnar Asplund]]'s [[Stockholm Public Library]].{{sfn|Powers|2007}} Also notable on the northern extension is [[Southgate tube station|Southgate station]]; here Holden designed a single-storey circular building with a canopied flat roof. Above this, the central section of roof rises up on a continuous horizontal band of [[clerestory]] windows, supported internally by a single central column. The building is topped by an illuminated feature capped with a bronze ball.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=103}} Other stations show the influence of [[Willem Marinus Dudok]]'s work in [[Hilversum]], Netherlands.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2006|p=166}} In order to handle such a large volume of work, Holden delegated significant design responsibility to his assistants, such as Charles Hutton, who took the lead on Arnos Grove Station.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hanson |first=Brian |title=Singing the Body Electric with Charles Holden |volume=clviii | work=[[Architectural Review]] |date=December 1975 |pages=pp. 349<U+2013>56}}</ref> For some other Piccadilly line stations the design was handled in-house by Stanley Heaps or by other architectural practices.

The UERL became part of [[London Passenger Transport Board|London Transport]] in 1933, but the focus remained on high quality design. Under Pick, Holden's attention to detail and idea of integrated design extended to all parts of London's transport network, from designing bus and tram shelters to a new type of six-wheeled omnibus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/VARIBAArchitecturePartnershipexhibitions/UndergroundJourneys/IntegratedDesign/IntegratedDesign.aspx |title=Underground Journeys: Integrated Design |publisher= [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] |accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> In the late 1930s, Holden designed replacement stations at [[Highgate tube station|Highgate]], [[East Finchley tube station|East Finchley]] and [[Finchley Central tube station|Finchley Central]] and new stations at [[Elstree South tube station|Elstree South]] and [[Bushey Heath tube station|Bushey Heath]] for the [[Northern line]]'s [[Northern Heights|Northern Heights plan]].{{sfn|Beard|2002|p=82}} Holden's designs incorporated sculpture relevant to the local history of a number of stations: [[Dick Whittington]] for Highgate,{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=140}} a Roman [[centurion]] at Elstree South{{sfn|Beard|2002|p=78}} and an archer for East Finchley.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=133}}{{#tag:ref|Dick Whittington was chosen for Highgate because tradition has him "turning again" back to London on Highgate Hill.

[[Eric Aumonier]] provided the statue ''The Archer'', a prominent feature of the station.<ref name="Aumonier_archer"/>

Holden's last designs for London Transport were three new stations for the [[Central line]] extension in north-east London.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=149}} These were designed in the 1930s, but were also delayed by the war and were not completed until 1947. [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#1945<U+2013>1959: the post-War era|Post-war austerity measures]] reduced the quality of the materials used compared with the 1930s stations and the building at [[Wanstead tube station|Wanstead]] was adapted from a temporary structure constructed during the line's wartime use as an underground factory.{{sfn|Emmerson|Beard|2004|p=119}} [[Gants Hill tube station|Gants Hill]] is accessed through subways and has no station building, but is notable for the design of its platform level concourse, which features a [[barrel vault]]ed ceiling inspired by stations on the [[Moscow Metro]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=149}}

===University of London===
{{main|Senate House (University of London)}}
[[File:Senate House, University of London.jpg|thumb|alt=A white stone skyscraper tower with numerous small windows |[[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]], home to the [[University of London|University of London's]] administration offices and library.]]
After the First World War, the [[University of London]] needed a replacement for its overcrowded and scattered accommodation in [[Kensington]]. A site was acquired in [[Bloomsbury]] near the [[British Museum]] and Holden was commissioned in 1931 to design the new buildings, partly due to the success of 55 Broadway.{{sfn|Karol|2008|pp=6<U+2013>7}}

Holden's original plan was for a single structure covering the whole site, stretching almost {{convert|1200|ft|m}} from Montague Place to Torrington Street. It comprised a central spine linked by a series of wings to the perimeter fa<U+00E7>ade and enclosing a series of courtyards. The scheme was to be topped by two towers: a smaller one to the north, and a 19-storey, {{convert|210|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tall Senate House.{{sfn|Karol|2008|pp=6<U+2013>7}}

Construction began in 1932, but due to a shortage of funds, the design was gradually revised and cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, with the buildings for the [[Institute of Education]] and the [[School of Oriental and African Studies|School of Oriental Studies]] completed later.{{sfn|Karol|2008|pp=6<U+2013>7}} The design featured fa<U+00E7>ades of load-bearing brickwork faced with Portland stone. Holden's intention to adorn the building with sculpture was also not fulfilled.{{sfn|Powers|2007}}{{sfn|Stevens Curl|2006}} As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the [[interior design]].{{sfn|Karol|2008|pp=6<U+2013>7}}{{sfn|Rice|2003}} From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=34}}

Senate House divided opinion. Pevsner described its style as "strangely semi-traditional, undecided modernism", and summarised: "The design certainly does not possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holden's smaller Underground stations."{{sfn|Cherry|Pevsner|1998|p=276}} Others have described it as [[Stalinism|Stalinist]],{{sfn|Jenkins|2005}} or as [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] due to its great scale.{{sfn|Karol|2008|pp=6<U+2013>7}} [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] architect [[Erich Mendelsohn]] wrote to Holden in 1938 that he was "very much taken and ... convinced that there is no finer building in London."{{#tag:ref|Mendelsohn, Erich (1938), letter to Holden, quoted in {{harvnb|Karol|2008|pp=6<U+2013>7}}.}} Historian Arnold Whittick described the building as a "static massive pyramid ... obviously designed to last for a thousand years", but thought "the interior is more pleasing than the exterior. There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity, serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece."{{sfn|Whittick|1974|p=515}}

The onset of the Second World War prevented any further progress on the full scheme, although Adams, Holden & Pearson did design further buildings for the university in the vicinity.{{sfn|Powers|2007}}

===Town planning===
With virtually no new work being commissioned, Holden spent the war years planning for the reconstruction that would be required once it was over.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=430<U+2013>31}} Holden was a member of the RIBA's twelve-man committee which formulated the institute's policy for post-war reconstruction. Holden's [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|town planning]] ideas involved the relocation of industry out of towns and cities to new industrial centres in the style of [[Port Sunlight]] or [[Bournville]] where workers could live close to their workplace. The new industrial centres would be linked to the existing towns with new fast roads and reconstruction in town centres would be planned to provide more open space around the administrative centres.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=433<U+2013>35}}

In 1944<U+2013>45 Holden produced plans for the reconstruction of [[Canterbury]], Kent, with the City Architect Herbert Millson Enderby.{{sfn|Hutton|Crawford|2007}} Canterbury had been badly damaged by [[History of the Luftwaffe (1933<U+2013>1945)|Luftwaffe]] bombing including the [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]] in May and June 1942. Holden and Enderby aimed to preserve much of the character of the city, but planned for the [[eminent domain|compulsory purchase]] of {{convert|75|acre|ha}} of the town centre for large scale reconstruction including a new civic way from the cathedral to a new town hall. Outside the city, they planned [[bypass (road)|bypasses]] and a [[ring road]] at a two-mile (3.2-kilometre) radius of the centre. Although approved by the city council, the plan was widely opposed by residents and [[freehold (English law)|freeholders]] and the "Canterbury Citizens Defence Association" issued an alternative plan before taking control of the council at local elections in November 1945. The change in administration ended the proposals, although a new plan prepared in 1947 without Holden's or Enderby's involvement retained some of their ideas including the ring road.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=437<U+2013>39}}

The [[City of London]]'s first reconstruction plan was written by the City Engineer F. J. Forty and published in 1944. It had met with considerable criticism and [[William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil|William Morrison]], Minister for Town and Country Planning, asked the [[City of London Corporation]] to prepare a new plan. Holden was approached, and he accepted provided that [[William Holford, Baron Holford|William Holford]] also be appointed. Holden's and Holford's City of London Plan (1946<U+2013>1947) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of [[Floor Area Ratio|plot ratio]] calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up to five times the ground area.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2006|p=185}}{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=447}} For the bomb-devastated area around [[St Paul's Cathedral]], Holden proposed a new [[precinct]] around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate. The heights of buildings would be strictly defined to protect these views. The plan was accepted by the Minister for Town and Country Planning in 1948 and was incorporated into the wider London Development Plan.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=453, 459<U+2013>60}}

In 1947, Holden planned a scheme on behalf of the [[London County Council]] for the [[South Bank]] of the [[River Thames]] between County Hall and [[Waterloo Bridge]],{{sfn|Hutton|Crawford|2007}}{{sfn|Who Was Who|2007}} including a plan for a concert hall with the council's architect Edwin Williams. The scheme received little attention and was almost immediately superseded by plans to develop the area as the site of the [[Festival of Britain]].{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=463}}{{#tag:ref|The concert hall was realised as the [[Royal Festival Hall]] by [[Leslie Martin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2006|p=178}}</ref>|group="note"}} Holden was also architectural and planning consultant to the [[University of Edinburgh]] and to the Borough of [[Tynemouth]].{{sfn|Who Was Who|2007}}

===Final years===
Although Charles Holden had gradually reduced his workload, he was still continuing to go into the office three days per week during the early 1950s. He did not formally retire until 1958, but even then he visited occasionally. Margaret Holden died in 1954 after a protracted illness which had left her nearly blind since the mid-1940s. In the last decade of his life, Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=17 & 466<U+2013>67}}

One of Holden's last public engagements was when he acted as a sponsor at the award of the RIBA's Royal Gold Medal to [[Le Corbusier]] in 1953.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=472}} The last project that Holden worked on was a much criticised headquarters building for [[English Electric]] in [[Aldwych]], London. In 1952, Adams, Holden & Pearson were appointed by English Electric's chairman, [[George Nelson, 1st Baron Nelson of Stafford|Sir George Nelson]], and Holden designed a monolithic stone building around a courtyard. In 1955, the [[London County Council]] persuaded English Electric to put the scheme aside and hold a limited architectural competition for a new design. Adams, Holden & Pearson submitted a design, but were beaten by Sir John Burnet, Tait and Partners. When that practice later refused Sir George Nelson's request to redesign the fa<U+00E7>ades, Adams, Holden & Pearson were reappointed and Charles Holden revised his practice's competition entry. The new design was criticised by the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]] and a further redesign was carried out by one of Holden's partners to produce the final design, described by Pevsner as "a dull, lifeless building, stone-faced and with nothing to recommend it".{{sfn|Pevsner|Cherry|1973|p=379}}{{#tag:ref|The building, later occupied by [[Citibank]], was demolished so that the site could be redeveloped for a hotel.<ref>{{cite web |last=Eade |first=Christine |title=Silken hotel seeks <U+00A3>110m-plus purse |url=http://www.propertyweek.com/news/silken-hotel-seeks-%C2%A3110m-plus-purse/3152811.article |publisher=''[[Property Week]]'' |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>|group="note"}}

Holden died on 1 May 1960. His body was cremated at Enfield crematorium and his ashes were spread in the garden of the Friends' Meeting House in [[Hertford]]. On 2 June 1960 a memorial service was held at [[St Pancras New Church]], where Holden had designed the altar in 1914. Obituaries were published in daily newspapers ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and in construction industry periodicals including ''[[Building (magazine)|The Builder]]'', ''[[Architectural Review]]'', ''Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects'' and ''Journal of the Town Planning Institute''. Generally, the obituaries were positive about Holden's early work and the stations for London Underground, were neutral about Senate House and were negative about his practice's later works.{{sfn|Karol|2007|pp=469 & 471}} The Harmer Green house and most of its contents were auctioned with the proceeds left to family members. Holden also left <U+00A3>8,400 to friends and staff and <U+00A3>2,000 to charity.{{sfn|Karol|2007|p=469}}

==Holden on architecture==
Holden recognised that his architectural style placed him in "rather a curious position, not quite in the fashion and not quite out of it; not enough of a traditionalist to please the traditionalists and not enough of a modernist to please the modernists."<ref>Holden, quoted in {{harvnb|Karol|2008|pp=6<U+2013>7}}.</ref> He believed that the principal aim of design was to achieve "fitness for purpose",{{sfn|Orsini|2010}} and repeatedly called for a style of architecture that avoided unnecessary architectural adornment.

In 1905, in an essay titled "If Whitman had been an Architect", Holden made an anonymous plea to architects for a new form of modern architecture: "Often I hear of the glory of the architecture of ancient Greece; of the proud Romans; of sombre Egypt; the praise of vast Byzantium and the lofty Middle Ages, too, I hear. But of the glory of the architecture of the Modern I never hear. Come, you Modern Buildings, come! Throw off your mantle of deceits; your cornices, pilasters, mouldings, swags, scrolls; behind them all, behind your dignified proportions, your picturesque groupings, your arts and crafts prettinesses and exaggerated techniques; behind and beyond them all hides the one I love."<ref>{{cite journal |title=If Whitman had been an Architect |work=[[Architectural Review]] |author=Anon (Holden, Charles) |date=June 1905 |page=p. 258}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Karol|2007|pp=167 & 173}}.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Holden confirmed his authorship in 1951.<ref>{{harvnb|Karol|2007|p=174}}</ref>|group="note"}}

In his 1936 speech when presented with the RIBA's [[Royal Gold Medal]], Holden defined his position: "It was not so much a matter of creating a new style, as of discarding those incrustations which counted for style ... surface embroidery empty of structural significance". His method was to focus on "those more permanent basic factors of architecture, the plan, and the planes and masses arising out of the plan."<ref>{{cite journal |title=RIBA Journal |year=1936  |last=Holden |first=Charles |volume=xliii (3rd Series), |page=623}}</ref> He described his ideal building as one "which takes naturally and inevitably the form controlled by the plan and the purpose and the materials. A building which provides opportunities for the exercise and skill and pleasure in work not only to the designer but also for the many craftsmen employed and the occupants of the building."<ref name="H in G">Holden, quoted in {{harvnb|Glancey|2007}}.</ref>

In a 1957 essay on architecture, he wrote "I don't seek for a style, either ancient or modern, I want an architecture which is through and through ''good building''. A building planned for a specific purpose, constructed in the method and use of materials, old or new, most appropriate to the purpose the building has to serve."<ref>Holden (1957), "The Kind of Architecture we want in Britain", ''[[Architectural Review]]'', quoted in {{harvnb|Karol|2007|p=9}}.</ref>
