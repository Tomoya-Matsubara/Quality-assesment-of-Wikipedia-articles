The civil war carried on intermittently until the looming [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] interrupted it, resulting in an organized and temporary [[Second United Front (China)|Chinese resistance to the Japanese]] invasion. The Japanese assault and occupation was an opportunistic attack made possible by China's own state of internal turmoil. Japan's campaign was defeated in August, 1945 by the [[Allies]], marking the end of [[WWII]], and China's full-scale civil war resumed in 1946. Hostilities ended after 23 years in 1950, with an unofficial cessation of major hostilities, with the CPC controlling [[mainland China]] (including [[Hainan|Hainan Island]]) and the KMT restricted to their remaining territories of [[Taiwan]], [[Pescadores]], and the [[list of islands of the Republic of China|several outlying Fujianese islands]]. To this day, no official [[armistice]] has ever been signed, although the two sides have close economic ties.<ref name="so">So, Alvin Y. Lin, Nan. Poston, Dudley L.

== Background ==
The [[Qing Dynasty]] collapsed in 1911.<ref name="so" /> China was left under the control of several major and lesser warlords in the [[Warlord era]]. To defeat the warlords who had seized control of much of [[Northern China]] since the collapse of the [[Qing Dynasty]], the anti-monarchist and national unificationist [[Kuomintang]] party and its leader [[Sun Yat-sen]] sought the help of foreign powers. His efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1921 he turned to the [[Soviet Union]]. For political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established [[Communist Party of China]]. The Soviets hoped for Communist consolidation, but were prepared for either side to emerge victorious. Thus the struggle for power in China began between the KMT and the CPC.

In 1923, a joint statement by Sun and Soviet representative [[Adolph Joffe]] in [[Shanghai]] pledged Soviet assistance for China's unification.<ref name="March">March, G. Patrick. Eastern Destiny: Russia in Asia and the North Pacific. [1996] (1996). Greenwood Publishing Group. ISBN:0275955664. pg 205.</ref> The [[Sun-Joffe Manifesto]] was a declaration for cooperation among the [[Comintern]], [[KMT]] and the [[Communist Party of China]].<ref name="March" /> [[Comintern]] agent [[Mikhail Borodin]] began to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. The CPC joined the KMT to form the [[First United Front (China)|First United Front]].<ref name="Hsiung" />

In 1923, Sun Yat-sen sent [[Chiang Kai-shek]], one of Sun's lieutenants from [[Tongmeng Hui]] days, for several months' military and political study in [[Moscow]].<ref name="ChangH">Chang, H. H. Chang. [2007] (2007). Chiang Kai Shek - Asia's Man of Destiny. ISBN:1406758183. pg 126</ref> By 1924, Chiang became head of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], rising to prominence as Sun's successor as head of the KMT.<ref name="ChangH" /> The Soviets provided much studying material, organization, and munitions for the academy.<ref name="ChangH" /> The Soviets also provided many techniques on mass mobilization. With this dedicated "army of the party," Sun Yat-sen hoped to defeat the warlords militarily. CPC members were also present in the academy, and many of them, including [[Zhou Enlai]], was made a political instructor of the academy.<ref name="HoA">Ho, Alfred K. Ho, Alfred Kuo-liang. [2004] (2004). China's Reforms and Reformers. Greenwood Publishing Group. ISBN:0275960803. pg 7.</ref>

Communist members were allowed to join the KMT on an individual basis.<ref name="March" /> The CPC was still small at the time, having a membership of 300 in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925.<ref name="Fairbank">Fairbank, John King. [1994] (1994). China: A New History. Harvard University Press. ISBN:0674116739.</ref> The KMT in 1923 had 50,000 members.<ref name="Fairbank" /> 

== Northern Expedition (1926&ndash;1928) and KMT-CPC split ==
Just months after [[Sun Yat Sen]]'s death in 1925, Chiang-Kai-Shek, as commander-in-chief of the [[National Revolutionary Army]], set out on the [[Northern Expedition (1926<U+2013>1927)|Northern Expedition]]<ref name="Fairbank" />. By 1926, however, the KMT had divided into left and right wing factions.<ref name="Fairbank" /> The Communist bloc within it was also growing. In the March 1926 [[Zhongshan Warship Incident]], after thwarting an alleged kidnapping attempt against him, Chiang imposed restrictions on CPC members' participation in the top KMT leadership and emerged as the pre-eminent KMT leader.

[[Image:China 1920s.jpg|thumb|280px|Government troops rounding up prisoners.]]

In early 1927, the KMT-CPC rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CPC and the left wing of the KMT had decided to move the seat of the KMT government from [[Guangzhou]] to [[Wuhan]], where Communist influence was strong.<ref name="Fairbank" /> But Chiang and [[Li Zongren]], whose armies defeated warlord [[Sun Chuanfang]], moved eastward toward [[Jiangxi]]. The leftists rejected Chiang's demand and Chiang denounced the leftists for betraying Sun Yat-sen's [[Three Principles of the People]] by taking orders from the Soviet Union. According to [[Mao Zedong]], Chiang's tolerance of the CPC in the KMT camp decreased as his power increased.<ref>Zedong, Mao. Thompson, Roger R. [1990] (1990). Report from Xunwu. Stanford University Press. ISBN:0804721823.</ref>

On April 7, Chiang and several other KMT leaders held a meeting arguing that communist activities were socially and economically disruptive, and must be undone for the national revolution to proceed. As a result of this, on April 12, Chiang turned on the CPC in Shanghai. The incident purged the KMT leftists by arresting and executing hundreds of CPC members.<ref name="Brune">Brune, Lester H.

Attempts were made by CPC to take cities such as [[Nanchang]], [[Changsha]], [[Shantou]], and Guangzhou.

== CPC vs KMT and the Long March (1927&ndash;1937) ==
During the 1920s, Communist Party of China activists retreated underground or to the countryside where they fomented a military revolt, beginning the [[Nanchang Uprising]] on [[August 1]], [[1927]].<ref name="Lee">Lee, Lai to. Trade Unions in China: 1949 To the Present. [1986] (1986). National University of Singapore Press.

It lasted until the [[Xi'an Incident]] when Chiang Kai-shek was forced to form the [[Second United Front (China)|Second United Front]] against the invading [[Japan]]ese.

[[Image:Long-march.jpg|thumb|280px|A Communist leader addressing Long March survivors.]]

In 1930 the [[Central Plains War]] broke out as an internal conflict of the KMT. It was launched by [[Feng Y<U+00FC>-hsiang]], [[Yen Hsi-shan]], and [[Wang Ching-wei]]. The attention was turned to root out remaining pockets of Communist activity in a series of [[Encirclement Campaigns|encirclement campaigns]]. There were a total of five campaigns.<ref name="Lynch">Lynch, Michael Lynch. Clausen, S<U+00F8>ren. [2003] (2003). Mao. Routledge. ISBN:0415215773.</ref> The [[First Encirclement Campaign|first]] and [[Second Encirclement Campaign|second]] campaigns failed and the [[Third Encirclement Campaign|third]] was aborted due to the [[Mukden Incident]]. The [[Fourth Encirclement Campaign|fourth campaign]] (1932-1933) achieved some early successes, but Chiang<U+2019>s armies were badly mauled when they tried to penetrate into the heart of Mao<U+2019>s [[Soviet Chinese Republic]]. During these campaigns, the KMT columns struck swiftly into Communist areas, but were easily engulfed by the vast countryside and were not able to consolidate their foothold.

Finally, in late 1933, Chiang launched a [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign|fifth campaign]] that involved the systematic encirclement of the [[Jiangxi Soviet]] region with fortified [[blockhouse]]s.<ref name="Manwaring">Manwaring, Max G. Joes, Anthony James. [2000] (2000). Beyond Declaring Victory and Coming Home: The Challenges of Peace and Stability operations. Greenwood Publishing Group. ISBN:0275967689. pg 58</ref> Unlike in previous campaigns in which they penetrated deeply in a single strike, this time the KMT troops patiently built blockhouses, each separated by five or so miles to surround the Communist areas and cut off their supplies and food source.<ref name="Manwaring" />

In October 1934, the CPC took advantage of gaps in the ring of blockhouses (manned by the troops of a warlord ally of Chiang Kai-shek's, rather than the KMT themselves) to escape [[Jiangxi]]. The warlord armies were reluctant to challenge Communist forces for fear of wasting their own men, and did not pursue the CPC with much fervor. In addition, the main KMT forces were preoccupied with annihilating [[Zhang Guotao]]'s army, which was much larger than Mao's. The massive military retreat of Communist forces lasted a year and covered 12,500 km (25,000 [[Li (unit)|Li]]), and was known as the famous [[Long March]].<ref name="Zhang">Zhang, Chunhou. Vaughan, C. Edwin. [2002] (2002). Mao Zedong as Poet and Revolutionary Leader: Social and Historical Perspectives. Lexington books. ISBN:0739104063. p 65, p 58</ref> The march ended when the CPC reached the interior of [[Shaanxi]]. [[Zhang Guotao]]'s army, which took a different route through northwest China, was largely destroyed by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his [[Hui|Chinese Muslim]] ally, the [[Ma clique]]. Along the way, the Communist army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor, solidifying its appeal to the masses. Of the 90,000-100,000 people who began the Long March from the Soviet Chinese Republic, only around 7,000-8,000 made it to Shaanxi.<ref name="Bianco">Bianco, Lucien. Bell, Muriel. [1971] (1971). Origins of the Chinese Revolution, 1915-1949. Stanford University Press. ISBN:0804708274. pg 68</ref> The remnants of Zhang's forces eventually joined Mao in Shaanxi, but with his army destroyed, Zhang, even as a founding member of the CPC, was never able to challenge Mao's authority. Essentially, the great retreat made Mao the undisputed leader of the Communist Party of China.

{{main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[Image:Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (pictured here in March 1945) was severely weakened in power by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].]]

During the [[Imperial Japan|Japan]]ese invasion and [[Imperial Japanese colonialism in Manchukuo|occupation of Manchuria]], Chiang Kai-shek, who saw the CPC as a greater threat, refused to ally with the CPC to fight against the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese]]. On [[December 12]], [[1936]], KMT Generals [[Zhang Xueliang]] and [[Yang Hucheng]] kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek and forced him to a truce with the CPC. The incident became known as the [[Xi'an Incident]].<ref name="Ye">Ye, Zhaoyan Ye, Berry, Michael. [2003] (2003). Nanjing 1937: A Love Story. Columbia University Press. ISBN:0231127545.</ref> Both parties suspended fighting to form a [[Second United Front (China)|Second United Front]] to focus their energies and fighting against the Japanese.<ref name="Ye" /> In 1937, Japanese airplanes bombed Chinese cities and well-equipped troops overran north and coastal China. 

The alliance of CPC and KMT Second united front was in name only.<ref name="Buss">Buss, Claude Albert. [1972] (1972). Stanford Alumni Association. The People's Republic of China and Richard Nixon. United States.</ref> The CPC hardly ever engaged the Japanese in major battles but proved efficient in [[guerrilla warfare]]. The level of actual cooperation and coordination between the CPC and KMT during [[World War II]] was minimal.<ref name="Buss" /> In the midst of the Second United Front, the CPC and the KMT were still vying for territorial advantage in "[[Free China (Second Sino-Japanese War)|Free China]]" (i.e. areas not occupied by the Japanese or ruled by [[Manchukuo|Japanese puppet government]]).<ref name="Buss" /> The situation came to a head in late 1940 and early 1941 when there were major clashes between the Communist and KMT forces. In December 1940, Chiang Kai-shek demanded that the CPC<U+2019>s [[New Fourth Army]] evacuate [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]] Provinces. Under intense pressure, the New Fourth Army commanders complied. In 1941 the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] led to several thousand deaths in the CPC.<ref name="schok">Schoppa, R. Keith. [2000] (2000). The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History. Columbia University Press. ISBN:0231112769.</ref> It also ended the Second united front formed earlier to fight the Japanese.<ref name="schok" /> In general, developments in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] were to the advantage of the CPC. The KMT's resistance to the Japanese proved costly to Chiang Kai-shek. In 1944 the last major offensive, [[Operation Ichigo]] was launched by the Japanese against the KMT.<ref name="Lary">Lary, Diana. [2007] (2007). China's Republic. Cambridge University Press.

==Immediate post-war clashes (1945&ndash;1946)==

[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic bombs were dropped]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] in 1945.<ref name="Lary" /> Under the terms of the Japanese [[unconditional surrender]] dictated by the [[United States]], Japanese troops were ordered to surrender to KMT troops and not to the CPC present in some of the occupied areas.<ref name="Zarrow">Zarrow, Peter Gue.

However the KMT had no forces in Manchuria. Chiang kai-shek ordered the Japanese troops to keep fighting the CPC through september, a full month after their surrender.<ref name="Zarrow" /> 

The first post-war peace negotiation was attended by both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in [[Chongqing]] from Aug 28, 1945 to Oct 10, 1945.<ref name="Xu">Xu, Guangqiu. [2001] (2001). War Wings: The United States and Chinese Military Aviation, 1929-1949. Greenwood Publishing Group. ISBN:0313320047. pg 201.</ref> Both sides stressed the importance of a peaceful reconstruction, but the conference did not produce any concrete result.<ref name="Xu" /> Battles between the two sides continued even as the peace negotiation was in progress, until the agreement was reached in January 1946. However, large campaigns and full scale confrontations between the CPC and Chiang's own troops were temporarily avoided.

In the last month of [[World War II]] in [[East Asia]], Soviet forces launched the mammoth [[Operation August Storm]] to attack the Japanese in Manchuria.<ref name="Bright">Bright, Richard Carl. [2007] (2007). Pain and Purpose in the Pacific: 
True Reports of War. Trafford Publishing. ISBN:1425125441.</ref> This operation destroyed the fighting capability of the [[Kwantung Army]] and left the USSR in occupation of all of Manchuria at the end of the war. Consequently, the 700,000 Japanese troops stationed in the region surrendered. Later in the year, Chiang Kai-shek came to the painful realization that he lacked the resources to prevent a CPC takeover of Manchuria following the scheduled Soviet departure. He therefore made a deal with the Russians to delay their withdrawal until he had moved enough of his best-trained men and modern material into the region. KMT troops were then [[airlift]]ed by the United States to occupy key cities in [[North China]], while the countryside was already dominated by the CPC. The Soviets spent the extra time systematically dismantling the extensive Manchurian industrial base (worth up to 2 billion dollars) and shipping it back to their war-ravaged country.<ref>Lilley, James. '' China hands : nine decades of adventure, espionage, and diplomacy in Asia '', PublicAffairs, New York, 2004</ref>

The truce fell apart in June 1946, when full scale war between CPC and KMT broke out on June 26. China then entered a state of [[civil war]] that lasted more than three years.<ref name="Hu">Hu, Jubin. [2003] (2003). Projecting a Nation: Chinese National Cinema Before 1949.

==Fighting on mainland China (1946&ndash;1950)==
[[Image:PLA Enters Peking.jpg|thumb|280px|The PLA enters Beiping in the [[Pingjin Campaign]] and control the capital]]
With the breakdown of talks, an all out war resumed. This stage is referred to in Communist media and historiography as the "War of Liberation" ({{zh-sp|s=<U+89E3><U+653E><U+6218><U+4E89>|p=Ji<U+011B>f<U+00E0>ng Zh<U+00E0>nzh<U+0113>ng}}). The United States assisted the KMT with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new surplus military supplies and generous loans of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment.<ref>p23, U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II, William Blum, Zed Books 2004 London.</ref> They also airlifted many KMT troops from central China to Manchuria. Nevertheless, the CPC, who had already situated themselves in the north and northeast, were poised to strike.

[[George Marshall|General Marshall]] himself stated that he knew of no evidence that the CPC were being supplied by the Soviet Union.<ref>New York Times, 12 Jan 1947, p44.</ref> The CPC did benefit indirectly from the elimination of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] but the Soviets did not provide direct support to the CPC during this period as they expected either a power-sharing arrangement or a KMT victory. The CPC were able to capture a number of weapons abandoned by the Japanese and KMT including some tanks but it was not until large numbers of well trained KMT troops joined the communist force that the CPC were finally able to master the hardware.<ref>Zeng Kelin, ''Zeng Kelin jianjun zishu'' (General Zeng Kelin Tells his story), Liaoning renmin chubanshe, Shenyang, 1997. p. 112-3</ref> Anti-Japanese Koreans also played an important role, with 30-40 thousand Korean troops participating in the war on the Communist side. Koreans are also credited with repairing Manchurian railroads and bridges which were used by Mao.<ref>Tikhomirov, V.V., & Tsukanov, A. M., "Komandirovka v Manchzhuriyu" (Assignment to Manchuria), in Akimov</ref>

In March 1947 the KMT seized the CPC capital of [[Yenan]]. By late 1948 the CPC eventually captured the northern cities of [[Mukden]] and [[Changchun]].<ref>Lilley, James R. China Hands: Nine Decades of Adventure, Espionage, and Diplomacy in Asia.

Workers at War: Labor in China's Arsenals, 1937-1953. [2004] (2004). Stanford University Press. ISBN:0804748969. pg 363.</ref> The KMT position was bleak. Chiang Kai Shek attempted to eliminate the CPC in the North by using troops belonging to northern warlords who had sided with Chiang during the Civil War and then switched sides to join the Japanese during the invasion. This strategy backfired as the effort to suppress the CPC who the peasants remembered as the enemies of the Japanese by using troops who had assisted the hated invaders further eroded any base of popular support which Chiang might have hoped for. Although the KMT had an advantage in their numbers and weapons, and benefited from considerable international support, their low morale hindered their ability to fight. Furthermore, though they administered a larger and more populous territory, their corruption effectively stifled any civilian support. 

The CPC were ultimately able to seize Manchuria after struggling through numerous set-backs while trying to take the cities, with the decisive [[Liaoshen Campaign]].<ref name="Westad">Westad, Odd Arne.

By late 1949, the People's Liberation Army was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China.

==CPC establish People's Republic of China / KMT retreat to Taiwan island==

On [[October 1]], [[1949]], Mao Zedong proclaimed the [[People's Republic of China]] with its capital at Beiping, which was renamed Beijing. Chiang Kai-shek and approximately 2 million Nationalist Chinese retreated from the [[mainland China|mainland]] to the island of [[Taiwan]].<ref name="Cookc">Cook, Chris Cook. Stevenson, John.

{{main|Political status of Taiwan}}
Most observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall in response to a Communist invasion of Taiwan, and the United States initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang's government in its final stand. Things changed radically with the onset of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered the [[U.S. 7th Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan strait]]s to prevent ROC and PRC from attacking each other.<ref name="BushR">Bush, Richard C. [2005] (2005). Untying the Knot: Making Peace in the Taiwan Strait. Brookings Institution Press. ISBN:081571288X.</ref>

In June 1949, the ROC declared a "closure" of all mainland ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships.  The closure covered from a point north of the mouth of [[Min River (Fujian)|Min river]] in [[Fujian province]] to the mouth of the [[Liao River|Liao river]] in Manchuria.<ref name="Tsang">Tsang, Steve Yui-Sang Tsang. The Cold War's Odd Couple: The Unintended Partnership Between the Republic of China and the UK, 1950-1958. [2006] (2006). I.B. Tauris. ISBN:1850438420. p 155, p 115-120, p 139-145</ref>  Since the mainland's railroad network was underdeveloped, north-south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland fishermen.

After losing the mainland, a group of approximately 12,000 KMT soldiers escaped to [[Burma]] and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China. Their leader, General [[Li Mi (ROC general)|Li Mi]], was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of [[Yunnan]]. Initially, the United States supported these remnants and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] provided them with aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the [[United Nations]] in 1953, the U.S. began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954, nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and Li Mi declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times.

After the Republic of China complained to the United Nations against the [[Soviet Union]] supporting the CPC, the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 505]] was adopted on [[February 1]], [[1952]] to condemn the Soviet Union.

Though viewed as a military liability by the United States, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]] as vital for any future campaign to retake the mainland. On [[September 3]], [[1954]], the [[First Taiwan Strait crisis]] began when the PLA started shelling [[Quemoy]] and threatened to take the [[Dachen Islands]].<ref name="Tsang" /> On [[January 20]], [[1955]], the PLA took nearby [[Yijiangshan Island]], with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On [[January 24]] of the same year, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Formosa Resolution]] authorizing the President to defend the ROC's offshore islands.<ref name="Tsang" />  The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung conference]].<ref name="Tsang" />

The [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] began on [[August 23]], [[1958]] with air and naval engagements between PRC and ROC forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of [[Quemoy]] (by the PRC) and [[Xiamen|Amoy]] (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year.<ref name="Tsang" /> PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the United States rejected Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to bomb mainland artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] ships to land supply, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On [[September 7]], the United States escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing. On [[October 25]], the PRC announced an "even-day ceasefire" &mdash; the PLA would only shell Quemoy on odd-numbered days.  The [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in 1995&ndash;96 escalated tensions between both sides when the PRC tested a series of missiles not far from Taiwan.<ref>Behnke, Alison. [2007] (2007). Taiwan in Pictures. Twenty-First Century Books. ISBN:082257148X.</ref>

Since the late 1980s, there has been growing economic exchanges on both sides while the [[Taiwan strait]]s remain a dangerous flash point.<ref name="so" /> Beginning in the early 21st century, there has been a significant warming of relations between the [[KMT]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] with high level exchanges such as the [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|2005 Pan-blue visit]].
