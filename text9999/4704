'''''Velociraptor''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|v|<U+0268>|<U+02C8>|l|<U+0252>|s|<U+0268>|r|<U+00E6>|p|t|<U+0259>r}}; meaning 'swift seizer')<ref name=osborn1924a/> is a [[genus]] of [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that existed approximately 75 to 71&nbsp;[[million years ago]] during the later part of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]].<ref name=PGetal2008/> Two species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past.  The [[type species]] is ''V. mongoliensis''; [[fossil]]s of this species have been discovered in [[Mongolia]].  A second species, ''V. osmolskae'', was named in 2008 for skull material from [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]].

Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Achillobator]]'', ''Velociraptor'' nevertheless shared many of the same [[anatomy|anatomical]] features. It was a [[biped]]al, [[feather]]ed [[carnivore]] with a long, stiffened tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped [[claw]] on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to kill its [[predation|prey]]. ''Velociraptor'' can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low [[skull]], with an upturned snout.

''Velociraptor'' (commonly shortened to 'raptor') is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role in the ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' motion picture series. In the films it was shown with anatomical inaccuracies, including being much larger than it was in reality and without feathers. It is also well known to [[paleontology|paleontologist]]s, with over a dozen described fossil skeletons<U+2014>the most of any dromaeosaurid. One particularly famous specimen preserves a ''Velociraptor'' locked in combat with a ''[[Protoceratops]]''.

==Description==
[[File:Vraptor-scale.png|thumb|left|''V. mongoliensis'' compared in size to a human]]
''Velociraptor'' was a mid-sized [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]], with adults measuring up to {{convert|2.07|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|0.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high at the hip, and weighing up to {{convert|15|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name = paul1988/> The skull, which grew up to {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, was uniquely up-curved, concave on the upper surface and convex on the lower. The jaws were lined with 26&ndash;28 widely spaced teeth on each side, each more strongly serrated on the back edge than the front<U+2014>possibly an adaptation that improved its ability to catch and hold fast-moving prey.<ref name=osborn1924a>{{cite_journal |last=Osborn |first=Henry F. |authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn |year=1924a |title=Three new Theropoda, ''Protoceratops'' zone, central Mongolia |journal=American Museum Novitates |volume=144 |pages=1<U+2013>12 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2246/3223}}</ref><ref name=barsboldosmolska1999>{{cite_journal |last=Barsbold |first=Rinchen |authorlink=Rinchen Barsbold |coauthors=Osm<U+00F3>lska, Halszka |year=1999 |title=The skull of ''Velociraptor'' (Theropoda) from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=189<U+2013>219 |url=http://app.pan.pl/article/item/app44-189.html}}</ref>

''Velociraptor'', like other dromaeosaurids, had a large [[Manus (zoology)|manus]] ('hand') with three strongly curved claws, which were similar in construction and flexibility to the wing bones of modern [[bird]]s. The second digit was the longest of the three digits present, while the first was shortest. The structure of the [[carpal]] (wrist) bones prevented [[pronation]] of the wrist and forced the 'hands' to be held with the [[palmar]] surface facing inwards ([[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right .28lateral.29.2C and medial|medially]]), not downwards.<ref name=paul2002>{{cite_book |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |authorlink=Gregory S.

However, whereas most theropods had feet with three digits contacting the ground, dromaeosaurids like ''Velociraptor'' walked on only their third and fourth digits.  The second digit, for which ''Velociraptor'' is most famous, was highly modified and held retracted off of the ground. It bore a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, typical of dromaeosaurid and [[troodontid]] dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, which could be over {{convert|6.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long around its outer edge, was most likely a predatory device used to tear into prey, possibly delivering a fatal blow.<ref name=barsbold1983>{{cite_journal |last=Barsbold |first=Rinchen  |year=1983 |title=Carnivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Mongolia |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=19 |pages=5<U+2013>119}}</ref><ref name=norellmakovicky1999>{{cite_journal |last=Norell |first=Mark A. |coauthors=Makovicky, Peter J. |year=1999 |title=Important features of the dromaeosaurid skeleton II: information from newly collected specimens of ''Velociraptor mongoliensis'' |journal=American Museum Novitates |volume=3282 |pages=1<U+2013>45 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2246/3025}}</ref>
[[File:Velociraptor BW.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of ''V. mongoliensis'']]
Long bony projections (prezygapophyses) on the upper surfaces of the [[vertebra]]e, as well as [[ossification|ossified]] [[tendon]]s underneath, stiffened the tail of ''Velociraptor''. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. The stiffening forced the entire tail to act as a single rod-like unit, preventing vertical motion between vertebrae. However, at least one specimen preserves a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an ''S''-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility. These adaptations of the tail probably provided balance and stability while turning, especially at high speeds.<ref name=barsbold1983/><ref name=norellmakovicky1999/>

==History==
[[File:Velociraptor mongoliensis AMNH-6515.png|thumb|The [[holotype|type]] skull of ''Velociraptor mongoliensis'' on display at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
[[File:Velociraptor mongoliensis type skull and jaws.jpg|upright|thumb|Henry Fairfield Osborn's drawing of above skull and the associated claw from 1924]]
During an [[American Museum of Natural History]] expedition to the Outer Mongolian [[Gobi Desert]], on 11 August 1923 [[Peter Kaisen]] recovered the first ''Velociraptor'' fossil known to science: a crushed but complete skull, associated with one of the raptorial second toe claws ([[AMNH]] 6515).<ref name=osborn1924a/> In 1924, museum president [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] designated the skull and claw (which he assumed to come from the hand) as the [[type specimen]] of his new genus, ''Velociraptor''. This name is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''velox'' ('swift') and ''raptor'' ('robber' or 'plunderer') and refers to the animal's [[cursorial]] nature and carnivorous diet. Osborn named the type species ''V. mongoliensis'' after its country of origin.<ref name=osborn1924a/> Earlier that year, Osborn had mentioned the animal in a popular press article, under the name "Ovoraptor djadochtari" (not to be confused with the similarly named ''[[Oviraptor]]'').<ref name=osborn1924b>{{cite_journal |last=Osborn |first=Henry F. |authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn |year=1924b |title=The discovery of an unknown continent |journal=Natural History |volume=24 |pages=133<U+2013>149}}</ref> However, because the name "Ovoraptor" was not published in a scientific journal or accompanied by a formal description, it is considered a ''[[nomen nudum]]'' ('naked name'), and the name ''Velociraptor'' retains priority.

While North American teams were shut out of [[communist]] Mongolia during the [[Cold War]], expeditions by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Poland|Polish]] scientists, in collaboration with Mongolian colleagues, recovered several more specimens of ''Velociraptor''. The most famous is part of the legendary "Fighting Dinosaurs" specimen ([[Mongolian Academy of Sciences|GIN]] 100/25), discovered by a Polish-Mongolian team in 1971.

''V. mongoliensis'' has been found at many of the most famous and prolific Djadochta localities.

===Paleoecology===
All of the fossil sites that have yielded ''Velociraptor'' remains preserve an arid environment with fields of sand [[dune]]s and only intermittent [[stream]]s, although the younger Barun Goyot environment seems to have been slightly wetter than the older Djadochta.<ref name=jerzykiewiczrussell1991/> The posture of some complete fossils, as well as the mode of preservation most show within structureless [[sandstone]] deposits, may show that a number of specimens were buried alive during [[Dust storm|sandstorm]] events common to the three environments.<ref name=PGetal2008/>

Many of the same genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was inhabited by ''Velociraptor mongoliensis'', ''[[Protoceratops andrewsi]]'', and ''[[Pinacosaurus grangeri]]'', while the Bayan Mandahu was home to ''Velociraptor osmolskae'', ''[[Protoceratops hellenikorhinus]]'', and ''[[Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus]]''. These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively close to each other geographically.<ref name=PGetal2008/> However, given the lack of any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, it is more likely that those differences indicate a slight time difference.<ref name="Longrichetal10">{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=A new oviraptorid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Upper Cretaceous of Bayan Mandahu, Inner Mongolia |journal=Palaeontology |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=945<U+2013>960 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2010.00968.x|author=Nicholas R.

Other dinosaurs known from the same locality as ''V. mongoliensis'' include the [[troodontid]] ''[[Saurornithoides mongoliensis]]'', the [[oviraptorid]] ''[[Oviraptor philoceratops]]'', and the dromaeosaurid ''[[Mahakala omnogovae]]''. ''V. osmolskae'' lived alongside the [[ceratopsia]]n species ''[[Magnirostris dodsoni]]'', as well as the [[oviraptorid]] ''[[Machairasaurus leptonychus]]'' and the [[dromaeosaurid]] ''[[Linheraptor exquisitus]]''.<ref name="Longrichetal10"/>

==Classification==
[[File:Velociraptor 28-12-2007 15-06-24.jpg|thumb|left|Mounted skeleton cast, Museum voor Natuurwetenschappen, [[Brussels]]]]
''Velociraptor'' is a member of the subfamily [[Velociraptorinae]], a [[derived]] sub-group of the larger family Dromaeosauridae. In [[phylogenetic taxonomy]], Velociraptorinae is usually defined as "all dromaeosaurs more closely related to ''Velociraptor'' than to ''[[Dromaeosaurus]]''." Dromaeosaurid classification is highly variable. Originally, the subfamily Velociraptorinae was erected solely to contain ''Velociraptor''.<ref name=barsbold1983/> Other analyses have included other genera, usually ''Deinonychus'' and ''[[Saurornitholestes]]''.<ref name=currie1995>{{cite_journal |doi=10.1080/02724634.1995.10011250 |last=Currie |first=Philip J. |authorlink=Phil Currie |year=1995 |title=New information on the anatomy and relationships of ''Dromaeosaurus albertensis'' (Dinosauria: Theropoda) |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=576<U+2013>591 |url=http://vertpaleo.org/publications/jvp/15-576-591.cfm}}</ref> A recent [[cladistic]] analysis indicated a [[monophyletic]] Velociraptorinae containing ''Velociraptor'', ''Deinonychus'', ''Tsaagan'', and a closely related (but uncertainly positioned) ''Saurornitholestes''.<ref name=norelletal2006>{{cite_journal |last=Norell |first=Mark A. |coauthors=Clark, James M.; Turner, Alan H.; Makovicky, Peter J.; Barsbold, Rinchen; Rowe, Timothy |year=2006 |title=A new dromaeosaurid theropod from Ukhaa Tolgod (Omnogov, Mongolia) |journal=American Museum Novitates |volume=3545 |pages=1<U+2013>51 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2246/5823 |doi=10.1206/0003-0082(2006)3545[1:ANDTFU]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

In the past, other dromaeosaurid species, including ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and ''Saurornitholestes langstoni'', have sometimes been classified in the genus ''Velociraptor''. Since ''Velociraptor'' was the first to be named, these species were renamed ''Velociraptor antirrhopus'' and ''V. langstoni''.<ref name=paul1988>{{cite_book |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |authorlink=Gregory S.

When first described in 1924, ''Velociraptor'' was placed in the family [[Megalosauridae]], as was the case with most carnivorous dinosaurs at the time (Megalosauridae, like ''[[Megalosaurus]]'', functioned as a sort of 'wastebin' taxon, where many unrelated species were grouped together).<ref name=osborn1924a/> As dinosaur discoveries multiplied, ''Velociraptor'' was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid. All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family [[Archaeopterygidae]] by at least one author (which would, in effect, make ''Velociraptor'' a flightless bird).<ref name=paul2002/>

===Predatory behavior===
[[File:Fightingdinosamnh2.jpg|thumb|The "Fighting Dinosaurs" specimen of ''V. mongoliensis'' and ''Protoceratops andrewsi'']]
The "Fighting Dinosaurs" specimen, found in 1971, preserves a ''Velociraptor mongoliensis'' and ''[[Protoceratops|Protoceratops andrewsi]]'' in combat and provides direct evidence of predatory behavior. When originally reported, it was hypothesized that the two animals drowned.<ref name=barsbold1974/> However, as the animals were preserved in ancient sand dune deposits, it is now thought that the animals were buried in sand, either from a collapsing dune or in a [[Dust storm|sandstorm]]. Burial must have been extremely fast, judging from the lifelike poses in which the animals were preserved. Both forelimbs and one hindlimb of the ''Protoceratops'' are missing, which has been seen as evidence of [[scavenger|scavenging]] by other animals.<ref name=carpenter1998>{{cite_journal |last=Carpenter |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Carpenter |year=1998 |title=Evidence of predatory behavior by theropod dinosaurs |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |pages=135<U+2013>144 |url=http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/9.pdf}}</ref> Comparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral ring]]s of ''Velociraptor'', ''Protoceratops'', and modern birds and reptiles indicates that ''Velociraptor'' may have been [[nocturnal]], while ''Protoceratops'' may have been [[cathemeral]], active throughout the day during short intervals, suggesting that the fight may have occurred at twilight or during low-light conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmitz, L.; Motani, R. |year=2011 |title=Nocturnality in Dinosaurs Inferred from Scleral Ring and Orbit Morphology |journal=Science |volume=332 |issue= 6030|pages= 705<U+2013>8|doi=10.1126/science.1200043 |pmid=21493820}}</ref>

The distinctive claw, on the second digit of dromaeosaurids, has traditionally been depicted as a slashing weapon; its assumed use being to cut and [[disembowel]] prey.<ref name=ostrom1969>{{cite_journal |last=Ostrom |first=John H. |authorlink=John Ostrom |year=1969 |title=Osteology of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'', an unusual theropod from the Lower Cretaceous of Montana |journal=Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History |volume=30 |pages=1<U+2013>165}}</ref> In the "Fighting Dinosaurs" specimen, the ''Velociraptor'' lies underneath, with one of its sickle claws apparently embedded in the throat of its prey, while the beak of ''Protoceratops'' is clamped down upon the right forelimb of its attacker. This suggests ''Velociraptor'' may have used its sickle claw to pierce vital organs  of the throat, such as the [[jugular vein]], [[carotid artery]], or [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] (windpipe), rather than slashing the abdomen. The inside edge of the claw was rounded and not unusually sharp, which may have precluded any sort of cutting or slashing action, although only the bony core of the claw is known. The thick abdominal wall of [[skin]] and [[muscle]] of large prey species would have been difficult to slash without a specialized cutting surface.<ref name=carpenter1998/> The slashing [[hypothesis]] was tested during a 2005 [[BBC]] documentary, ''[[The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs]]''. The producers of the program created an artificial ''Velociraptor'' leg with a sickle claw and used a [[pork belly]] to simulate the dinosaur's prey. Though the sickle claw did penetrate the abdominal wall, it was unable to tear it open, indicating that the claw was not used to disembowel prey. However, this experiment has not been published or repeated by other scientists, so its results cannot be confirmed.

Remains of ''[[Deinonychus]]'', a closely related dromaeosaurid, have commonly been found in aggregations of several individuals.

The pack hunting theory was based on a discovery of several specimens of ''[[Deinonychus]]'' found around the remains of a ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. No other group of dromaeosaurids has been found in close association.<ref>Long, John, and Schouten, Peter. (2008). ''Feathered Dinosaurs: The Origin of Birds''.

In 2011, Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which dromaeosaurs like ''Velociraptor'' may have taken smaller prey. This model, known as the "raptor prey restraint" (RPR) model of predation, proposes that dromaeosaurs killed their prey in a manner very similar to extant [[Accipitridae|accipitrid]] [[birds of prey]]: by leaping onto their quarry, pinning it under their body weight, and gripping it tightly with the large, sickle-shaped claws. Like accipitrids, the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while still alive, until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure. This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors. Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of [[eagle]]s and [[hawk]]s, especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion. The short [[Tarsometatarsus|metatarsus]] and foot strength, however, would have been more similar to that of [[owl]]s. The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of ''Velociraptor'''s anatomy, such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology. The arms, which could exert a lot of force but were likely covered in long feathers, may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop a struggling prey animal, along with the stiff counterbalancing tail. The jaws, thought by Fowler and colleagues to be comparatively weak, would have been useful for eating prey alive but not as useful for quick, forceful dispatch of the prey. These predatory adaptations working together may also have implications for the [[Origin of avian flight|origin of flapping]] in [[paravian]]s.<ref name=fowler2011>Fowler, D.W., Freedman, E.A., Scannella, J.B., and Kambic, R.E.

===Scavenging behavior===
In 2010, Hone and colleagues published a paper on their 2008 discovery of shed teeth of what they believed to be a ''Velociraptor'' near a tooth-marked jaw bone of what they believed to be a ''Protoceratops'' in the Bayan Mandahu Formation.<ref name=Hone2010>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hone | first1 = David | last2 = Choiniere | first2 = Jonah | last3 = Sullivan | first3 = Corwin| last4 = Xu | first4 = Xing | last5 = Pittman | first5 = Michael | last6 = Tan | first6 = Qingwei | title = New evidence for a trophic relationship between the dinosaurs ''Velociraptor'' and ''Protoceratops'' | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume = 291 | pages = 488<U+2212>492 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.03.028 | issue = 3<U+2013>4}}</ref> The authors concluded that the find represented "late-stage carcass consumption by ''Velociraptor''" as the predator would have eaten other parts of a freshly killed ''Protoceratops'' before biting in the jaw area.<ref name=Hone2010/><ref>{{cite news |title= Fossil find shows Velociraptor eating another dinosaur |first= Matt |last= Walker |newspaper=BBC Earth News |date= 2010-04-06 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8596000/8596568.stm |accessdate=2010-08-20 }}</ref> The evidence was seen as supporting the inference from the "Fighting Dinosaurs" fossil that ''Protoceratops'' was part of the diet of ''Velociraptor''.<ref name=Hone2010/> In 2012 Hone and colleagues published a paper that described a ''Velociraptor'' specimen with a long bone of an [[azhdarchid]] [[pterosaur]] in its gut. This was interpreted as showing scavenging behaviour.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.02.021}}</ref>

===Metabolism===
''Velociraptor'' was probably [[warm-blooded]] to some degree, as it required a significant amount of energy to hunt. Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like ''Velociraptor'' did, tend to be warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate [[metabolism]], compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The [[kiwi]] is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a fairly low resting metabolic rate, making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids.<ref name=paul2002/>

===Feathers===
[[File:Velociraptor dinoguy2.jpg|thumb|''Velociraptor mongoliensis'' restored with large wing feathers, as evidenced by fossil quill knobs.]]
Fossils of dromaeosaurids more primitive than ''Velociraptor'' are known to have had [[feather]]s covering their bodies, and fully developed, feathered wings.<ref name=xuetal2003>{{cite_journal |last=Xu|first=Xing |authorlink=Xu Xing (paleontologist) |coauthors=Zhou, Zhonghe; Wang, Xiaolin; Kuang, Xuewen; Zhang, Fucheng; Du, Xiangke |year=2003 |title=Four-winged dinosaurs from China |journal=Nature |issue=  6921|pages=335<U+2013>340 |doi=10.1038/nature01342 | volume = 421 |pmid=12540892}}</ref> The fact that the ancestors of ''Velociraptor'' were feathered and possibly capable of flight long suggested to paleontologists that ''Velociraptor'' bore feathers as well, since even flightless birds today retain most of their feathers.

In September 2007, researchers found [[feathers|quill knobs]] on the forearm of a ''Velociraptor'' found in Mongolia.<ref name="turneretal2007b"/> These bumps on bird wing bones show where feathers anchor, and their presence on ''Velociraptor'' indicate it too had feathers. According to paleontologist Alan Turner,

{{cquote|A lack of quill knobs does not necessarily mean that a dinosaur did not have feathers. Finding quill knobs on ''Velociraptor'', though, means that it definitely had feathers. This is something we'd long suspected, but no one had been able to prove.<ref name=sciencedaily2007feathers>American Museum of Natural History. [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070920145402.htm "Velociraptor had feathers."] ''ScienceDaily'' 2007-09-20. Accessed 2010-08-20.</ref>}}

Co-author Mark Norell, Curator-in-Charge of fossil reptiles, amphibians and birds at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], also weighed in on the discovery, saying:

{{cquote|The more that we learn about these animals the more we find that there is basically no difference between birds and their closely related dinosaur ancestors like velociraptor. Both have wishbones, brooded their nests, possess hollow bones, and were covered in feathers. If animals like velociraptor were alive today our first impression would be that they were just very unusual looking birds.<ref name=sciencedaily2007feathers/>}}

According to Turner and co-authors Norell and Peter Makovicky, quill knobs are not found in all prehistoric birds, and their absence does not mean that an animal was not feathered <U+2013> [[flamingo]]s, for example, have no quill knobs. However, their presence confirms that ''Velociraptor'' bore modern-style wing feathers, with a rachis and vane formed by barbs. The forearm specimen on which the quill knobs were found (specimen number IGM 100/981) represents an animal 1.5 meters in length (5&nbsp;ft) and 15 kilograms (33&nbsp;lbs) in weight. Based on the spacing of the six preserved knobs in this specimen, the authors suggested that ''Velociraptor'' bore 14 secondaries (wing feathers stemming from the forearm), compared with 12 or more in ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', 18 in ''[[Microraptor]]'', and 10 in ''[[Rahonavis]]''. This type of variation in the number of wing feathers between closely related species, the authors asserted, is to be expected, given similar variation among modern birds.<ref name="turneretal2007b"/>

Turner and colleagues interpreted the presence of feathers on ''Velociraptor'' as evidence against the idea that the larger, flightless maniraptorans lost their feathers secondarily due to larger body size. Furthermore, they noted that quill knobs are almost never found in flightless bird species today, and that their presence in ''Velociraptor'' (presumed to have been flightless due to its relatively large size and short forelimbs) is evidence that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids could fly, making ''Velociraptor'' and other large members of this family secondarily flightless, though it is possible the large wing feathers inferred in the ancestors of ''Velociraptor'' had a purpose other than flight. The feathers of the flightless ''Velociraptor'' may have been used for display, for covering their nests while brooding, or for added speed and thrust when running up inclined slopes.<ref name="turneretal2007b"/>

===Pathology===
{{Main|Paleopathology}}
One ''Velociratoptor mongoliensis'' skull bears two parallel rows of small punctures that match the spacing and size of ''Velociraptor'' teeth. Scientists believe that the wound was likely inflicted by another ''Velociraptor'' during a fight. Further, because the fossil bone shows no sign of healing near the bite wounds, the injury probably killed it.<ref name="molnar-pathology">Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic  Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University  Press, p. 337-363.</ref>

==In popular culture==

[[File:Velociraptor mongoliensis jmallon.jpg|thumb|''Velociraptor mongoliensis'']]
''Velociraptor'' are well known for their role as vicious and cunning killers in the 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] and its 1993 [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]], directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], in which they served as the main antagonists. The "raptors" portrayed in ''Jurassic Park'' were modeled after a larger relative, ''[[Deinonychus]]'', which [[Gregory Paul]] at the time called ''Velociraptor antirrhopus''.<ref name=paul1988/> The paleontologists in the film and the novel excavate a so-called ''Velociraptor'' skeleton in [[Montana]], far from the central Asian range of ''Velociraptor'' but well within the range of ''Deinonychus''. A character in Crichton's novel also states that "<U+2026>''Deinonychus'' is now considered one of the velociraptors", indicating that Crichton used Paul's [[taxonomy]], though the "raptors" in the novel are referred to as ''V. mongoliensis''.<ref name=crichton1990>{{cite_book |last=Crichton |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Crichton |year=1990 |title=Jurassic Park |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |pages=117 |isbn=0-394-58816-9}}</ref>

The filmmakers also had the size of the film's ''Velociraptor'' increased for dramatic reasons, and changed the shape of the snout.<ref name=Duncan2006>{{cite_book |last=Duncan |first=Jody |authorlink=Jody Duncan |year=2006 |title=[[The Winston Effect]] |location=London |publisher=Titan Books |pages=175|isbn=1845763653}}</ref><ref name=bakker1995>{{cite_book |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |authorlink=Bob Bakker |year=1995 |title=[[Raptor Red]] |location=New York |publisher=Bantam Books |pages=4|isbn=0-553-57561-9}}</ref> Additionally, the forelimbs of the film animals differed in structure and posture from those of real dromaeosaurids and their tails were too short and flexible, anatomical errors which directly contradict fossil evidence. Another noticeable difference is the lack of feathers for the novel and film version of ''Velociraptor''. In real life, ''Velociraptor'', like many other [[maniraptora]]n theropods, was covered in feathers. ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', however, were released before this was known. In ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', the ''Velociraptor'' are depicted with quill-like structures along the back of the head and neck, although these do not resemble the down-like feathers known from real-life dromaeosaurids, and the quill knobs on some ''Velociraptor'' specimens show that they had fully developed feathers akin to those of modern birds.<ref name="turneretal2007b"/> Also in ''Jurassic Park III'', [[Alan Grant (Jurassic Park character)|Dr. Alan Grant]], played by [[Sam Neill]], states that ''Velociraptor'' were smarter than dolphins, whales and some primates. Given only fossil evidence, this is impossible to ascertain and is purely conjecture.

Due to the success of many ''Jurassic Park''-related products, ''Velociraptor'' has become a ubiquitous representation of dinosaurs in popular culture. It has been featured in numerous [[toy|toy lines]], [[animated films]], video games and television series for children, along with several [[Documentary film|television documentaries]]. In 1995, the city of [[Toronto]] was awarded a [[National Basketball Association]] [[expansion team]], which was named the [[Toronto Raptors]].
