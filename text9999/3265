'''Solar powered flashlights''' are  [[flashlight]]s that can be powered through [[solar energy]] using [[solar cell]]s as well as through [[batteries]]. Most of these flashlights also run on [[LED]] lights<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ledlights.org/LED-Flashlights/LED-Flashlight-Torch.html|title=LED Flashlight Torch|publisher=ledlights.org|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://flashlightnews.org/story1204.shtml|title=Solar LED Flashlight with 20-Lumen Brightness|publisher=flashlightnews.org|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref> due to the low energy consumption cost.<ref name=spf>{{cite web|url=http://www.solarpoweredflashlight.org/|title=Solar Powered Flashlight|publisher=solarpoweredflashlight.org|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref>

== Features ==
The typical flashlight will have a charge time of about 6 hours while providing 8 hours of light. They can penetrate up to 50 meters in the dark, and can be visible up to 2 kilometers. The cell life of the solar energy cells can be as long as 20 years.<ref name=spf/> Flashlights designed to be used in remote locations are sturdy, shockproof and weatherproof<ref name=spf1/> in addition to being able to float.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.y2knorth.com/sunmate_flash.html|title=Solar-Powered Flashlight|publisher=y2knorth.com|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref>

Other models include a wide variety of other features including a built in [[solar cell phone charger]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoseed.org/living-green/consumer-goods/article/48-consumer-goods/1743-solar-powered-torch-and-phone-charger-offered|title=Solar-powered torch and phone charger offered|publisher=ecoseed.org|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref> AM/FM radio that has a high sensitivity the built-in FM antenna, a built in siren which sounds loud and clear to signal for help in an emergency, hand crank dynamo charging for use in night time etc., which can be used during camping, fishing, hunting, any indoor or outdoor sports, emergencies or blackouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flashlightnews.org/story862.shtml|title=Survival Center<U+2019>s New Solar Powered Disaster Preparedness Flashlight/Radio|publisher=flashlightnews.org|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref>

== Battery life ==
To maximize your battery life on the solar flashlight, it is recommended that the battery be fully drained at least once a month. Doing so would erase any [[battery memory]] that is created from half-charges.<ref name=spf/>

== Innovations ==
A solar powered torch the size of a [[credit card]] has been developed by a team of scientists from [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[US]]. This device combines 16 [[solar cell]]s connected in [[Series connection|series]] that are used to [Battery charging|charge]] a [[battery]] that powers a white [[light emitting diode]]. Production required 35 steps, and combined the [[polymer solar cell]] with [[printed circuit board|printed circuitry]] and flexible [[Lithium polymer battery|lithium polymer batteries]]. Tests were run on the lamp to determine its efficiency and study the effects of humidity and design on performance. This pocket-sized flashlight was able to get a yield of 89 per cent and operated for hours at a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2011/August/08081101.asp|title=A torch to fit in your back pocket|publisher=rsc.org|accessdate=2011-08-08|work=}}</ref>

== Advantages ==
* Solar powered lights prevents the need to constantly manually charge as in the case of conventional battery operated flashlights.<ref name=spf/>

* Pollution from discarded batteries used in normal flashlights is eliminated.<ref name=spf1>{{cite web|url=http://www.solarpoweredflashlight.org/how-to-pick-the-best-solar-powered-flashlight/|title=How to Pick the Best Solar Powered Flashlight|publisher=solarpoweredflashlight.org|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref>

* Solar powered flashlights are ideal for use in remote locations where it is impossible to find any source of electricity except for solar power.<ref name=spf1/>

== Significance ==
Solar powered flashlights have been distributed to countries where there is either none or erratic power supply, helping people feel safer leaving their homes at night, and giving children the opportunity to study after sunset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lighthaiti.org/press/USAA_Mag_SunNight.pdf|title=Lighting the world|publisher=lighthaiti.org|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanzanianchildrensfund.org/wish_list.htm|title=Wish List for the Rift Valley Children<U+2019>s Village|publisher=tanzanianchildrensfund.org|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref> A dual purpose solar flashlight, which also functions as a lamp has helped families in such countries spend more time together, surgeries to be performed during power outages and people to travel in the dark under a halo of light.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.rockfound.org/uploads/files/b016baf0-79ab-41b1-94c3-15088e6d5771-sunnight.pdf|title=Case study: SunNight solar|publisher=m.rockfound.org|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edge.rit.edu/content/P08427/public/Business%20Plan.pdf|title=Green Power - Business Plan|publisher=edge.rit.edu|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edweb.sdsu.edu/sdpca/back_issues/v21n1.html|title=Scaling for the Poor - The task of turning good ideas into greater good|publisher=edweb.sdsu.edu|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=}}</ref>
