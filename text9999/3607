'''Hurricane Ginger''' was the [[List of Atlantic hurricane records|second-longest lasting]] [[Atlantic hurricane]] on record. The eighth [[tropical cyclone]] and fifth hurricane of the [[1971 Atlantic hurricane season]], Ginger spent 27.25&nbsp;days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September&nbsp;6 to October&nbsp;3. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, and for the first nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h). On September&nbsp;14, Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near [[Bermuda]] on September&nbsp;23. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.

While over the western [[Atlantic Ocean]], Ginger became the last target of [[Project Stormfury]], which sought to weaken hurricanes by depositing [[silver iodide]] into tropical cyclone [[rainband]]s. Ginger ultimately struck [[North Carolina]] on September&nbsp;30 as a minimal hurricane, lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region. Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left severe crop damage, with 3&nbsp;million [[bushel]]s of corn and 1&nbsp;million bushels of [[soybean]] lost. Damage in the state was estimated at $10&nbsp;million (1971&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000000|1971}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD). Further north, moderate precipitation and winds spread through the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], although no significant damage was reported outside of North Carolina.

==Meteorological history== 
[[Image:Ginger 1971 track.png|left|thumb|Path of Hurricane Ginger, beginning near the Bahamas, extending out to the middle Atlantic Ocean, and curving back to hit the United States]]
Hurricane Ginger originated in a [[cold-core low|cold-core upper-level low]] that persisted for several days in early September in the western Atlantic Ocean.<ref name="prelim1"/> The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] through the central Atlantic, which resembled the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] but at a higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an [[anticyclone]] located over northern [[South America]], which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The weather pattern also led to the formation of [[Hurricane Fern (1971)|Hurricane Fern]], [[Tropical Storm Heidi (1971)|Tropical Storm Heidi]], and two tropical depressions.<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal|author1=R.

After forming, the depression moved slowly southeastward for about 24&nbsp;hours before turning to the northeast, slowly organizing in the process. On September&nbsp;10, the depression turned eastward, and later that day intensified into Tropical Storm Ginger, the seventh [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the year, about 325&nbsp;mi (525&nbsp;ki) south of Bermuda. The storm quickly intensified, and within 24&nbsp;hours reached winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h), making it a hurricane. It turned to the northeast, passing well to the east of Bermuda. Late on September&nbsp;13, Ginger attained its minimum [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of 959&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (28.32&nbsp;[[Inch of Mercury|inHg]]), and early the next day reached peak [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h). After reaching a position about halfway between Bermuda and the [[Azores]], the hurricane's eastward movement halted due to a building [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north and east. It turned sharply southward before turning and beginning a westerly drift, during which Ginger weakened to minimal hurricane status.<ref name="prelim1"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

[[File:Ginger 9-27.PNG|right|thumb|Hurricane Ginger southeast of the United States on September 27]]
For about six days, Ginger maintained minimal hurricane status.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} As it meandered over the central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained an unusually large [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], reaching 80&nbsp;mi (130&nbsp;km) in diameter.<ref name="prelim2">{{cite web|publisher=National Hurricane Center|year=1971|title=Hurricane Ginger September 5 - October 5 (Page 2)|accessdate=2011-02-14|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1971-prelim/ginger/prelim02.gif|format=GIF}}</ref> On September&nbsp;18, Ginger turned to the south and slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September&nbsp;21, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115&nbsp;mi (185&nbsp;km) south of the island on September&nbsp;23 while slowly weakening. On September&nbsp;24, Ginger decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September&nbsp;26, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest.<ref name="prelim1"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=National Hurricane Center|year=1971|title=Preliminary - Tropical Storm Janice, September 21<U+2013>24, 1971|accessdate=2011-02-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1971-prelim/janice/prelim01.gif}}</ref>

For three days, beginning on September&nbsp;26, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] deployed planes into the hurricane as part of [[Project Stormfury]], the fourth hurricane to be a part of the [[weather control]] experiment.<ref name="mwr"/> The plane dropped [[silver iodide]] into the center of the hurricane, although there was no effect due to Ginger's large eye and diffuse nature; this was the last seeding done by the project.<ref>{{cite journal|author=H.

At around 06:00&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] the next day, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h), which it maintained for about 18&nbsp;hours. Afterward, Ginger slowly weakened, and late on September&nbsp;30 it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Morehead City, North Carolina]], with winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression by late on October&nbsp;1. Ginger turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October&nbsp;3, it transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] while crossing [[Hampton Roads]] into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of Ginger continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a [[cold front]] on October&nbsp;5.<ref name="prelim2"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

As the hurricane passed south of Bermuda on September&nbsp;23, it produced heavy waves, as well as [[gale]] force winds for 17&nbsp;hours. The [[Kindley Air Force Base]] reported peak gusts of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="prelim2"/><ref name="upi923"/> There was no reported damage, and the hurricane's passage failed to alleviate persistent drought conditions.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|newspaper=The Sun|agency=Associated Press|date=1971-09-24|title=Ginger Down to a Purr|accessdate=2011-02-17|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-ZplAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AIsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2626,3438192&dq=hurricane+ginger&hl=en}}</ref>

==Record longevity==
Hurricane Ginger formed on September&nbsp;6 and lasted until October&nbsp;3, for a total of 27.25&nbsp;days.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Its duration surpassed that of [[Hurricane Inga (1969)|Hurricane Inga]] in 1969, which was the previous record-holder, by three days.<ref name="prelim1"/> In 2003, it was discovered that the [[1899 San Ciriaco hurricane]] lasted as a tropical cyclone longer than Ginger, although its duration as a tropical cyclone was not continuous. This made Ginger the second longest-lived of any Atlantic hurricane, but it remains the storm that lasted the most consecutive days as a tropical cyclone in the basin.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

Ginger spent 20&nbsp;days as a hurricane from September 11 to September 30, one of the longest durations on record at that intensity. In addition, Ginger co-existed with several other tropical cyclones, including on September 11 when there were four named storms at the same time, a rare occurrence; the others were [[Hurricane Edith (1971)|Hurricane Edith]], Hurricane Fern, and Tropical Storm Heidi.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}
