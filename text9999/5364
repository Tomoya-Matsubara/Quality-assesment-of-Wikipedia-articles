== History ==
:''Main article: [[History of Vilnius]]''

[[Image:Wilno katedra.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vilnius Cathedral|Cathedral]] in Vilnius, seen in [[1912]].]]
Some historians identify the city with [[Voruta]], a legendary capital of [[Mindaugas]] who was crowned in [[1253]] as [[King of Lithuania]]. The city was first mentioned in written sources in [[1323]], in [[Letters of Gediminas|letters of Grand Duke Gediminas]] that were sent to German cities and invited German and Jewish community to settle in the capital city. In [[1387]], the city was granted [[Magdeburg rights|city rights]] by [[Jogaila]], one of Gediminas' successors. 

[[Image:Vilnius Ostra Brama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gate of Dawn]], the only remaining gate in the city wall]]
Between [[1503]] and [[1522]] the city was surrounded with [[city wall|walls]] that had nine [[city gate]]s and three towers. Vilnius reached the peak of its development under the reign of [[Sigismund II Augustus|Sigismund August]], who moved his court there in [[1544]]. In the following centuries, Vilnius became a constantly growing and developing city. This growth was due in part to the establishment of [[Vilnius University]] by the King [[Stefan Batory|Stephen Bathory]] in [[1579]]. The university soon developed into one of the most important scientific and cultural centres of the region and the most notable scientific centre of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Political, economic, and social activities were in full swing in the town. In [[1769]], the [[Rasos Cemetery]], one of the oldest surviving cemeteries in the city, was founded. During its rapid development, the city was open to [[migrants]] from both abroad and far reaches of territories of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Each group made its unique contribution to the life of the city, and crafts, trade and science prospered. During the [[Russo-Polish War (1654-1667)]], Vilnius was occupied by Russia for several years. The city was pillaged and burned, and its population was massacred. The city's growth lost its momentum for many years, but the population rebounded, and by the beginning of the [[19th century]] city's population reached 200,000 making the city one of the largest in Northern Europe.
[[Image:Vilnius Alumni Yard.jpg|thumb|left|The Vilnius Alumni yard]]
After the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in [[1795]], Vilnius was annexed by [[Russia]] and became the capital of a ''[[guberniya]]''. During the Russian occupation the city walls were destroyed, and by [[1805]], only the [[Dawn Gate]] remained. In [[1812]], the city was seized by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] on his [[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia|push towards Moscow]]. Following the [[November Uprising]] in [[1831]], [[Vilnius University]] was closed and Russian repressions halted the further development of the city. During the [[January Uprising]] in [[1863]] heavy fighting occurred within the city, but was brutally [[pacification|pacified]] by [[Mikhail Muravyov]], nicknamed ''The Hanger'' by the population because of the number of executions he organized. After the uprising all civil liberties were withdrawn, and use of the [[Polish language|Polish]] <ref>[http://www.vdu.lt/staff/HMF/Aleksandravicius_an.htm Egidijus Aleksandravi<U+010D>ius], Antanas Kulakauskas; ''Car<U+0173> vald<U+017E>ioje: Lietuva XIX am<U+017E>iuje'' ("Lithuania under the reign of Czars in 19th century"); Baltos lankos, Vilnius 1996.

During [[World War I]] Vilnius &mdash; as with the rest of Lithuania &mdash; was occupied by [[Germany]] from 1915 until 1918. The ''Act of the Restoration of Independence of Lithuania'' was proclaimed in the city on [[February 16]], [[1918]]. After the withdrawal of German forces, Lithuanian forces were made to retreat by the advancing Russian occupation forces. Vilnius changed hands many times: for a while it was controlled by Polish self-defence units, who didn't want the city to be occupied by Russian-[[Bolshevik]] forces. Then the [[Polish Army]] regained control, then [[Soviet]] forces again. Shortly after its defeat in the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)]], the retreating [[Red Army]] ceded the city back to [[Lithuania]] by signing a peace treaty on [[July 12]], [[1920]]. Poland also recognized Vilnius and the Vilnius region as a part of [[Lithuania]] with the ''Treaty of Suwalki'' signed on [[October 7]], [[1920]] ([http://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaizdas:Border-Lithuania-Poland-1919-1939.svg]).  However, on [[October 9]] of the same year, the Polish Army under General [[Lucjan <U+017B>eligowski]] broke the treaty and seized Vilnius after a staged [[coup]]. The city and its surroundings were proclaimed a separate state of [[Central Lithuania]] (''Vidurio Lietuvos Respublika''). On [[February 20]], [[1922]], the whole area was made a part of Poland, with Vilnius as the [[capital]] of the [[Wilno Voivodship]] (Wilno being the name of Vilnius in [[Polish language|Polish]]). The Lithuanian government fled to a temporary capital [[Kaunas]] and stated that Poland had illegally annexed and occupied Vilnius and diplomatic relations between Lithuania and Poland were severed until [[1938]]. Poles and Jews made up a majority of the population of the city, with a small Lithuanian minority of only 0.8%.

[[Image:Vilnius HMG Orthodox church.jpg|thumb|left|Orthodox [[Cathedral of the Theotokos, Vilnius|Cathedral of the Theotokos]], with Gediminas Tower in background.]]
In the meantime, for yet another time in its history, the city enjoyed a period of fast development. Vilnius University was reopened under the name [[Stefan Batory University]] and the city's [[infrastructure]] was improved significantly. By [[1931]], the city had 195,000 inhabitants, making it the fifth largest city in Poland. Some Lithuanians, however, dispute this picture of economic growth and point out that the standard of living in Vilnius at this time was considerably lower compared to that in other parts of contemporary Lithuania. 

[[Image:Vilnius Gediminas tower.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gediminas Tower]]]] 
Following the secret protocol of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], on [[September 19]], [[1939]], Vilnius was seized and annexed by the [[Soviet Union]]. On [[October 10]], [[1939]], after a Soviet [[ultimatum]], the Lithuanian government accepted the presence of Soviet [[military base]]s in various parts of the country in exchange for restoring the city to Lithuania. Though the process of transferring the capital from Kaunas to Vilnius started soon after, the whole of Lithuania was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] in June of [[1940]], before the transfer was completed. A new Communist government was installed, with Vilnius as the capital of the newly created [[Lithuanian SSR]]. Up to 40,000 of the city's inhabitants were arrested by the [[NKVD]] and sent to [[gulag]]s in the far eastern areas of the Soviet Union.

In June [[1941]], the city was seized by [[Germany]]. Two ghettos were set up in the [[Vilnius Old Town|old town]] center for the large Jewish population - the smaller one of which was "liquidated" by October. The larger ghetto lasted until 1943, though its population was regularly decimated in what were known as "Aktionen".  A failed [[ghetto uprising]] on [[September 1]], [[1943]] organized by the [[Fareinigte Partizaner Organizacje]] (the United Partisan Organization, the first Jewish partisan unit in Nazi-occupied Europe), was followed by the final destruction of the ghetto. About 95% of the 265,000-strong Jewish population of Lithuania was murdered by the German units and their local collaborators, many of them in [[Paneriai]], about 10 km west of the old town centre.

[[Image:Vilnius skyline at night.Lithuania.JPG|thumb|left|340px|Vilnius skyline at night]]
In July 1944 Vilnius was retaken by the Soviet Army.  Vilnius was incorporated into the Soviet Union as the capital of the [[Lithuanian SSR]] shortly thereafter.  Immediately after [[World War II]], large numbers of Poles were expelled from Soviet-occupied Lithuania to Poland.  Coupled with the migration of the Lithuanians into Vilnius, this development resulted in a change in the city's demographic fabric.

On [[March 11]], [[1990]], the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR announced its independence from the Soviet Union and restored the independent [[Republic of Lithuania]]. The Soviets responded on [[January 9]], [[1991]], by sending in troops.  On [[January 13]] during the [[Vilnius massacre|Soviet Army attack]] on the State Radio and Television Building and the [[Vilnius TV Tower]], fourteen civilians were killed and more than 700 were seriously injured. The Soviet Union finally recognized Lithuanian independence in August [[1991]].

[[Image:The Presidential Palace in Lithuania .jpg|190 px|thumb|right|[[Presidential Palace, Vilnius|The Presidential Palace]]]]
Since then, Vilnius has rapidly transformed in an attempt to erase its Soviet past and the town has emerged as a modern European city. Many of its older buildings have been renovated, and a business and commercial area is being developed into the ''New City Center'', expected to become the city's main administrative and business district on the north side of [[Neris]] river. This area includes modern residential and retail space, with the [[municipality]] building and a 129-metre (423') [[Europa Tower]] as its most prominent building.  While a number of modern business and retail centers have been built during recent years, many other projects are waiting to be implemented.

In 2009 Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, will be the capital of the European Culture. Among the initiatives promoted by the Lithuanian Country for this event, the historical centre of the city has been restored and its main monuments have been renewed <ref>[http://www.webjournal.unior.it/Dati/17/41/Articolo%20Lituania.pdf O. Niglio, ''Restauri in Lituania. Vilnius Capitale della Cultura Europea 2009'',] in "Web Journal on Cultural Patrimony", 1, 2006

==Coat of arms of Vilnius city==
[[Image:Vilnius_city_COA.gif|thumb|right|190px|Large version of coat-of-arms of city of Vilnius.]]
{{main|Vilnius Coat of Arms}}

The Vilnius [[coat of arms]] depicts [[Saint Christopher|St. Christopher]] (''Kristupas'') wading through water with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] on his shoulders.  It was granted to the city in the seventh year of its first mention ([[1330]]).

==Geography and population==
Vilnius is situated in southeastern Lithuania ({{coor dm|54|41|N|25|17|E|}}) at the [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the [[Vilnia River|Vilnia]] and [[Neris]] Rivers. It is believed that Vilnius, like many other cities, was named after a crossing river, Vilnia. 

Vilnius' non-central location can be attributed to the changing shape of the nation's borders through the centuries; Vilnius was once not only culturally but also geographically at the center of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

Vilnius lies 312 [[kilometre|km]] from the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Klaip<U+0117>da]], the chief Lithuanian [[seaport]]. Vilnius is connected by highways to other major Lithuanian cities, such as [[Kaunas]] (102 km away), [[<U+0160>iauliai]] (214 km away) and [[Panev<U+0117><U+017E>ys]] (135 km away). 

The current area of Vilnius is 402 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]]. Buildings cover 20.2% of the city and in the remaining areas, greenery (43.9%) and waters (2.1%) prevail. <!-- 20.2+43.9+2.1=66.2% !!! -->

According to the [[2001]] [[census]] by the Vilnius Regional Statistical Office, there were 542,287 inhabitants in the [[Vilnius city municipality]], of which 57.8% were [[Lithuanians]], 20.7% [[Poles]], 14% [[Russians]], 4.0% [[Belarusians]] and 0.5% [[Jews]]; the remainder indicated other nationalities or refused to answer.

==Tourism==
[[Image:Lithuania Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|View over the Cathedral roof]]
Vilnius is a [[cosmopolitan]] city with diverse [[architecture]]. There are more than 40 [[church]]es in Vilnius to see. [[Restaurant]]s, [[hotel]]s and [[museum]]s have sprouted since Lithuania declared independence, and young Vilnius residents are building the city's reputation for being the most hospitable in the world, as evidenced by an active participation in the [[Hospitality Club]].

[[Image:Vilnius_Ostrobramska.jpg|thumb|right|Au<U+0161>ros Vartai Street.]]
Like most [[Middle Ages|medieval]] towns, Vilnius was developed around its [[Town Hall, Vilnius|Town Hall]]. The main artery, [[Pilies Street]], links the governor's palace and the Town Hall. Other streets meander through the palaces of [[Feudalism|feudal]] lords and landlords, churches, shops and craftsmen's workrooms. Narrow, curved streets and intimate [[courtyard]]s developed in the radial layout of medieval Vilnius.

The [[Vilnius Old Town|Old Town]], the historical centre of Vilnius, is one of the largest in [[Europe]] (3.6 km<U+00B2>). The most valuable historic and cultural sites are concentrated here. The buildings in the old town <U+2014> there are nearly 1,500 <U+2014> were built over several centuries, creating a splendid blend of many different architectural styles. Although Vilnius is known as a [[Baroque]] city, there are examples of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] (e.g. the [[St. Anne's Church, Vilnius|St Anne's Church]]), [[Renaissance]], and other styles. The main sights of the city are [[Gediminas Castle]] and [[Cathedral Square]], symbols of the capital. Their combination is also a gateway to the historic centre of the capital. Owing to its uniqueness, the Old Town of Vilnius was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] in [[1994]]. In [[1995]], the first [[Sculpture|cast]] of [[Frank Zappa]] in the world was installed near the center of Vilnius with the permission of the government.

==Economy==
[[Image:Europa Tower Lithuania Vilnius.jpg|thumb|right|180px|New City center dominated by [[Europa Tower]]]]

Vilnius is the major economic centre of Lithuania and one of the largest financial centres of the [[Baltic states]]. Even though it is home to only 15% of Lithuania's population, it generates approximately 35% of Lithuania's GDP [http://www.vilnius.lt/new/en/investicijos.php]. Based on these indicators, its estimated [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, based on [[purchasing power parity]], in 2005 is approximately $33,100, above the [[European Union]] average.

Vilnius contributed over 4.6 billion [[Lithuanian litas|litas]] to the national budget in 2004. That makes about 37% of the budget. Kaunas, the second largest city, contributed only 1.5 billion. Vilnius received a return of 360 million litas in the budget, which is only 7.7% of its contribution. This disparity caused some conflicts with the central government because of Vilnius' demand for a greater share of the funds it generated.

==Religion==
:''For ecclesiastical history, see [[Archdiocese of Vilnius]]''
Known as ''Yerushalayim De Lita'' (translated as "Jerusalem of Lithuania"), Vilnius (Vilna) once was comparable only to [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]] as a world center for the study of the [[Torah]], and for its large Jewish population. That is why one part of Vilnius was named ''Jeruzal<U+0117>''. At the end of the [[19th century]], the number of synagogues in Vilnius exceeded one hundred<ref>[http://www.jmuseum.lt/index.asp?DL=E&TopicID=67 The Great Synagogue of Vilnius] The Vilna Gaon Jewish State Museum</ref>. A major scholar of [[Judaism]] and [[Kabbalah]] centered in Vilnius was the famous [[rabbi]] [[Vilna Gaon]]. His students have significant influence among Orthodox Jews in Israel and around the globe. This Jewish life in Vilnius was destroyed during the holocaust of the second world war.

==Climate==
[[Image:Lituania_Vilnius.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Central Vilnius in winter]]
The climate of Vilnius is transitional between [[continental climate|continental]] and [[oceanic climate|maritime]]. The average annual temperature is +6.1<U+00B0>C; in January the average temperature is <U+2212>4.9<U+00B0>C, in July it is +17.0<U+00B0>C. The average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is about 661 mm per year.

Summers can be hot, with temperatures above thirty degrees Celsius throughout the day. Nightlife in Vilnius is in full swing at this time of year, and outdoor bars and caf<U+00E9>s become very popular during the daytime.

Winters can be very cold, with temperatures rarely reaching above freezing - temperatures below minus 25 degrees Celsius are not unheard-of in January and February. Vilnius's rivers freeze over in particularly cold winters, and the lakes surrounding the city are almost always permanently frozen during this time of year. A popular pastime is ice-fishing, whereby fishermen drill holes in the ice and fish with baited hooks, usually drinking quantities of alcohol to keep themselves warm.

==Transport==
Vilnius is the starting point of the Vilnius-Kaunas-[[Klaip<U+0117>da]] [[highway]] that runs across Lithuania and connects the three major cities. The Vilnius-[[Panev<U+0117><U+017E>ys]] highway is a branch of [[European route E67|Via-Baltica]]. Though the river [[Neris]] may be navigable, no regular water routes exist. [[Vilnius International Airport]] serves most Lithuanian international flights to many major European destinations. The Vilnius [[Rail transport|railway]] station is an important hub as well. 

Vilnius has a well-developed [[Public transport|public transportation]] system. There are over 60 bus and 19 [[trolleybus]] routes. Over 230 buses and 250 trolleybuses transport about 500,000 passengers every workday. Students, elderly, and the disabled receive large discounts (up to 80%) on the tickets. A single ride ticket (called a ''talonas'' or [[diminutive]] ''talon<U+0117>lis'') costs up to 1.40 [[Lithuanian litas|litas]] while monthly tickets (called ''nuolatinis'') cost up to 60 litas (about 20 [[United States dollars|USD]]). The first regular bus routes were established in 1926, and the first trolleybus was launched in 1956.

[[Image:MonthlyPassVilniusFrontside.jpg|thumb|left|A sample Vilnius Transport nominal monthly ticket]]
The public transportation system is dominated by the brand new lowerdecker [[Volvo Buses|Volvo]] and [[Mercedes-Benz buses]] as well as [[Solaris Bus & Coach|Solaris]]  trolleybuses. It is a result of a major improvements that started in 2003 when the first 14 brand-new Mercedes-Benz buses were bought. In 2004, a contract was signed with [[Volvo Buses]] to buy 90 brand-new [http://www.vap.lt/volvo.htm 7700 buses] over the next 3 years.
Along with the official public transportation, there are also a number of private bus companies. They charge about the same as the municipal buses and sometimes follow the same routes. There are also a number of different routes, for example from various neighborhoods to the [[Gari<U+016B>nai]] market. In addition there are about 400 [[share taxi]]s that are usually faster than regular buses.

[[Art<U+016B>ras Zuokas]], the Mayor of Vilnius city municipality, has proposed that a [[tram]]way be built. However the plans to install a tram network remain unclear. A number of studies and projects have been prepared but construction dates have not been set yet.



==Sister cities==
Vilnius has 14 [[Town twinning|sister cities]]. In addition, agreements on cooperation have been signed with 16 other cities.

==Trivia==
Vilnius is one of the locations featured in the video game ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon]]'' (photographs comparing the game's locations with their real-life counterparts can be found [http://www.ghostrecon.net/html/real-locations.htm here]). However, although some of the architecture is relatively well-represented, it has to be said that most of the map is fictional and it does not feel like a particularly accurate representation of the city of Vilnius.

Lying very close to Vilnius is a site some claim to be the [[Geographic Center of Europe|Geographical Centre of Europe]].

The rural town of [[Wilno, Ontario|Wilno]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] was named after the Polish name for Vilnius in the [[1860s]]. The village of [[Vilna, Alberta]] was also named for Vilnius.

The city is the birthplace of the fictional character [[Marko Ramius]] from [[Tom Clancy|Tom Clancy's]] novel ''[[The Hunt For Red October]]''.

==Subdivisions==
