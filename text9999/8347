The '''Edo OSE''' was a 1940s [[United States|American]] single-seat multi-role [[floatplane]] designed and manufactured by the [[Edo Aircraft Corporation]].

==Design and development==

The Edo Aircraft Corporation was an established company that produced seaplane floats.  In 1946, Edo designed its first aircraft, the '''Edo OSE'''. Two prototype aircraft (designated XOSE-1) were built and flown in [[1946 in aviation|1946]]. The XOSE-1 was a single-seat low-wing [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]] with a single float and fixed wingtip stabilizing floats. The wings could be folded for shipboard storage. The aircraft was designed for a variety of roles including observation and anti-submarine patrols. Unusually, it was designed to carry a ''rescue cell'' on the underwing hardpoints, which would be capable of carrying a single person when used for air-sea rescue. Eight production aircraft (designated '''OSE-1''') were built to a [[United States Navy]] order but none were accepted into service. A two-seat training conversion was carried out as the '''XTE-1''', but production TE-2 aircraft were cancelled.
