'''Fort Lauderdale Station''' is a [[train station]] in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], [[Florida]], which is served by [[Tri-Rail]] and [[Amtrak]]. The station is located on Southwest 21st Terrace, just south of [[Florida State Road 842|West Broward Boulevard]].  

==History==

[[File:Ft. Lauderdale SAL 1927.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Orange Blossom Special (train)|Orange Blossom Special]]'' arrives at the temporary Seaboard Air Line Railway Fort Lauderdale station in 1927.]]
The original station, which is used by Amtrak, is a former [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad|Seaboard Air Line Railway]] depot built in 1927. Designed in the prevalent [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] style by [[Gustav Maass (architect)|Gustav Maass]] of the West Palm Beach architectural firm Harvey & Clarke, it is virtually identical to the [[Hollywood (Tri-Rail station)|Hollywood Seaboard station]] to the south. The station took the place of a temporary structure that had been hastily erected at the end of 1926 to greet the January 1927 arrival of the first Seaboard passenger train in South Florida, the ''[[Orange Blossom Special (train)|Orange Blossom Special]]''. 

The station was served by the ''Orange Blossom Special'' until 1953 and, among other Seaboard trains, the ''[[Silver Meteor]]'' beginning in 1939.  Amtrak maintained ''Silver Meteor'' service to the station when it took over [[Inter-city rail|intercity]] [[passenger train]] service in 1971. Both the ''Silver Meteor'' and Amtrak's ''[[Silver Star (Amtrak train)|Silver Star]]'' continue to use the station. 

The station consists of a passenger waiting room on the northern end and a baggage room in the center section.  On the southern end is a freight room, which is used by [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], the successor to Seaboard. Just south of the street side entry to the passenger waiting room, and representative of the [[racial segregation]] laws of the era in which the station was constructed, is the entrance to what had been the "colored" waiting room.

===Tri-Rail===     

On January 9, 1989, the [[South Florida Regional Transportation Authority]] began Tri-Rail service to the station, building additional facilities and a pedestrian overpass just north of the original station. A [[park and ride]] lot is available, and is directly accessible via a proprietary exit from [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]] north.
