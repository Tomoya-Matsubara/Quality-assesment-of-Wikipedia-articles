'''King's Highway 70''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 70''', was a [[Highways in Ontario|provincially maintained highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]], which provided a shorter route from [[Ontario Highway 6|Highway&nbsp;6]] and [[Ontario Highway 21|Highway&nbsp;21]] in [[Springmount, Ontario|Springmount]] to Highway&nbsp;6 in [[Hepworth, Ontario|Hepworth]]. The route, which now forms part of Highway&nbsp;6, was {{convert|15.1|km}} long and travelled in a southeast<U+2013>northwest direction west of [[Owen Sound]]. The route followed an early trail blazed by deputy surveyor [[Charles Rankin]] in 1842 that was upgraded to a modern road in the 1920s. Highway&nbsp;70 was designated in 1965 and renumbered as Highway&nbsp;6 in 1997. Another Highway&nbsp;70 existed near [[Kenora]] between 1937 and 1959 before being renumbered as [[Ontario Highway 71|Highway&nbsp;71]]. This designation was applied along the newly opened Heenan Highway, shortly after the [[Ontario Department of Highways|Department of Highways]] (DHO) began numbering routes in northern Ontario. However, a series of renumberings in 1960 led to the entire length becoming part of [[Ontario Highway 71|Highway&nbsp;71]].

== Route description ==
Highway 70 was a short highway that travelled in a northeast<U+2013>southwest direction between the communities of [[Springmount, Ontario|Springmount]], near Owen Sound, and Hepworth. The {{convert|15.1|km|abbr=on}} route, now part of Highway&nbsp;6, passes through an equal mixture of farmland and forests, aside from the community of [[Shallow Lake, Ontario|Shallow Lake]], located at approximately the midpoint of the route. At its southern terminus is the only [[wrong-way concurrency]] in Ontario, between Highway&nbsp;6 and Highway&nbsp;21. The road continues south of the intersection between these highways as Grey County Road&nbsp;18, which serves as a bypass of Owen Sound. At its northern terminus, the route curves to the west and enters Hepworth; Highway&nbsp;70 ended at the intersection of Queen Street and Bruce Street. From there, Highway&nbsp;6 continued north through the [[Bruce Peninsula]].<ref name="2010 mapart">{{cite map

;Rainy River<U+2013>Kenora
{{see also|Ontario Highway 71}}
The Highway&nbsp;70 designation was first used along the [[Heenan Highway]], connecting the Rainy River region to Kenora to provide the first Canadian road link to an area previously accessible only from the United States. In 1922, [[Kenora (electoral district)|Kenora]] MPP [[Peter Heenan]] and Dr. McTaggart<!-- could use a first name here --> approached the government to lobby for construction of a road between [[Nestor Falls, Ontario|Nestor Falls]] and Kenora. Nestor Falls was the northernmost point accessible by road from the Rainy River area. Heenan would become the Minister of Lands and Forests in [[Mitch Hepburn]]'s cabinet.<ref name="fftimes.com">{{cite news

Unlike previously built roads in the area, the Fort Frances <U+2013> Kenora Highway, as it was known prior to its opening, was constructed through the rugged terrain of the [[Canadian Shield]]. Rocks, forests, lakes, [[muskeg]], and insects served as major obstacles during construction of the {{convert|100|km|adj=on}} highway, which progressed from both ends. By late 1935, the only remaining gap in the road was the Sioux Narrows Bridge. Construction on this bridge was underway by March 1936; it was rapidly assembled using [[Douglas fir]] from [[British Columbia]] as the main structural members. The bridge was completed on June&nbsp;15, 1936, completing the link between Fort Frances and Kenora.<ref name="narrows">{{cite web

On July&nbsp;1, 1936, premier Mitch Hepburn attended a ceremony in front of the Rainy Lake Hotel in Fort Frances.<ref name="narrows" /> On a rainy afternoon, at 5:30&nbsp;p.m., Peter Heenan handed Hepburn a pair of scissors with which to cut the ribbon crossing the road and declare the highway open. Hepburn, addressing the crowd that was gathered, asked "What would you say if we call it the Heenan Highway, what would you think of that?". The crowd cheered and Hepburn cut the ribbon.<ref name="fftimes.com"/>

The Heenan Highway was assumed by the DHO shortly after its merger with the Department of Northern Development. Following the merger, the DHO begin assigning trunk roads throughout northern Ontario as part of the provincial highway network.<ref>{{cite book

The original route of Highway&nbsp;70 split in two south of [[Finland, Ontario|Finland]]; Highway&nbsp;70 turned east to [[Off Lake Corner]], then south to Emo, while Highway&nbsp;70A turned west to [[Black Hawk, Ontario|Black Hawk]] then south to [[Barwick, Ontario|Barwick]]. The northern end of the highway was also concurrent with Highway&nbsp;17 for {{convert|21.7|km}} into Kenora, and the southern end concurrent with Highway&nbsp;71 for {{convert|37.0|km}} between Emo and Fort Frances.<ref>{{cite map

During 1952, the highway was extended south from its split to Highway&nbsp;71, midway between Barwick and Emo. By 1953, the new road was opened and informally designated as the new route of Highway&nbsp;70. The old routes were decommissioned on February&nbsp;8, and the new route designated on March&nbsp;10, 1954.<ref>{{cite report

Throughout the mid to late 1950s, a new highway was constructed west from Thunder Bay towards Fort Frances. Initially this road was designated as [[Ontario Highway 120|Highway&nbsp;120]]. In 1959, it was instead decided to make this new link a westward extension of Highway&nbsp;11; a major renumbering took place on April&nbsp;1, 1960: Highway&nbsp;11 was established between Rainy River and Fort Frances, Highway&nbsp;71 was truncated west of the Highway&nbsp;70 junction, and the entirety of Highway&nbsp;70 was renumbered as Highway&nbsp;71.<ref name="1959a">{{cite press release

It was surveyed in 1854 by Ontario's deputy [[surveyor]], Charles Rankin, to provide a short route between the undeveloped Sydenham (now Owen Sound) and Hepworth townsites. This route passed through a large swamp and as a result remained an unimproved one lane trail up until the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book
