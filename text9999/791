"'''Fatbeard'''" is the seventh episode of the [[South Park (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 188th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 22, 2009 and in the United Kingdom on April 24, 2009. It was the mid-season finale, marking the final ''South Park'' episode for six months. In the episode, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] misinterprets news reports about [[Piracy in Somalia]] to mean the return of the [[Golden Age of Piracy|classic era]] of swashbuckling [[Piracy|pirates]], and misleads a handful of South Park boys to voyage to [[Mogadishu]] to start a pirate crew.

The episode was written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[Television content rating systems|TV-MA L]] in the United States for strong to extreme language. "Fatbeard" was a reference to increasing international media attention to Somalian piracy, and the script depicted the pirates in a sympathetic light. The crew of the [[USS Bainbridge (DDG-96)|USS ''Bainbridge'']], the [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] [[Destroyer|guided missile destroyer]] which participated in the rescue of the [[Maersk Alabama hijacking|hijacked]] [[Merchant vessel|MV]] ''[[MV Maersk Alabama|Maersk Alabama]]'', contacted the ''South Park'' creators to praise them for the episode. "Fatbeard" received generally positive reviews and was seen by 2.59 million households in its original broadcast, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production the week it aired.

==Plot==
Having misunderstood the news about a recent upsurge of [[piracy in Somalia]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] excitedly tells his friends the [[Golden Age of Piracy|classic era]] of [[piracy]] has returned, and asks the boys to join him in becoming a pirate in what he describes as a responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise. Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] encourages him to go, even offering to help pay for his ticket. Although [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] and [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Kevin Stoley|Kevin]] are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to [[Cairo, Egypt]]. After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in [[Mogadishu|Mogadishu, Somalia]] dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in an impoverished [[failed state]] and [[anarchy]], completely opposite their expectations.

They quickly find the pirates, who are shocked that anyone would knowingly venture into their lair. The pirates decide to ransom the boys to the first European vessel they find. The boys confidently go with them, believing they are being taken to a pirate ship, but are once again disappointed when they are taken to a small motorboat. Eventually, the pirates find a French [[schooner]] and demand a ransom of five thousand [[euro]]s in exchange for the lives of the boys. Meanwhile in South Park, Kyle happily claims partial credit for sending Cartman to Somalia and expects things will be better without Cartman around. But when his parents read him a farewell letter from Ike, Kyle realizes his brother has run off with Cartman to Somalia, and he sets off for Mogadishu to bring his brother home. Back in Somalia, the ransom is paid and the boys are surrendered. Once on board, however, Cartman assumes control of the [[schooner]] and orders the crew to get onto the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]. Although the captain initially refuses, Kevin brandishes a toy [[lightsaber]], frightening the French crew into abandoning ship. Cartman and the boys return to Mogadishu with the captured vessel, giving several bundles of euros to the pirates, who are initially shocked, but begin to respect Cartman, who, unimpressed by their lack of traditional "pirate" traits, in turn leads them in raiding ships, and starts fashioning them into a stereotypical crew, leading them a traditional [[sea shanty]] called "Somalian Pirates, We".

Meanwhile, the French crew is discovered by a cargo ship, and the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] is deployed by [[NATO]] due to the news that the pirates now have advanced weaponry (meaning the lightsaber, which was reported to be real). Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When they say that they left because they were tired of things like school, chores, homework, and being hollered at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them going to school was his ultimate dream, but he was forced to become a pirate because he was desperately poor and his family would otherwise die. Butters and Ike, realizing how irresponsible they all have been, admit that a life of piracy is one of suffering and hardship, not fun and adventure, and tell Cartman they want to return home. Cartman, however, refuses to give up his romantic delusions and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted, however, when a U.S Navy ship appears off the coast carrying snipers, who kill all of Cartman's pirates with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.

While most ''South Park'' episodes feature Parker and Stone almost exclusively providing voice acting, "Fatbeard" included several French-speaking actors providing the lines of the schooner crew. Outside voice actors were also brought in for the role of the Somlian pirates, including Abdi Fatah Adawe, Dahir Ali, Abdullahi Prime, Sebastian Yu and Julien Zeitouni.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=4&year=2010|title=FAQ - South Park Studios |publisher=[[South Park|South Park Studios]] (Official) |date=April 26, 2010 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> The week after its original broadcast, in response to requests by fans, the full 90-second version of episode's sea shanty song, "Somalian Pirates, We" was made available for download on ''South Park Studios'', the official ''South Park'' website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/3679 |date=2009-04-29 |title=News: The Pirate Song |publisher=[[South Park|South Park Studios]] |accessdate= 2009-05-03}}</ref> Shortly after "Fatbeard" was originally broadcast, the site also featured six different types of T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode.<ref name="Shirt1">{{Cite web |title=southpark: AHOY |work=[[Zazzle]] |date=2009-04-23 |url=http://www.zazzle.com/southpark/gifts?cg=196267186031043122 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref><ref name="Shirt2">{{Cite web |title=southpark: All Right, Ye Booty Lovers |work=[[Zazzle]] |date=2009-04-23 |url=http://www.zazzle.com/southpark/gifts?cg=196010070620379159 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref><ref name="Shirt3">{{Cite web |title=southpark: All the Booty and Plunder |work=[[Zazzle]] |date=2009-04-23 |url=http://www.zazzle.com/southpark/gifts?cg=196146092657722160 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref><ref name="Shirt4">{{Cite web |title=southpark: Butters, Ahoy! |work=[[Zazzle]] |date=2009-04-23 |url=http://www.zazzle.com/southpark/gifts?cg=196538003069577171 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref><ref name="Shirt5">{{Cite web |title=southpark: Gingers Can't Be Pirates |work=[[Zazzle]] |date=2009-04-23 |url=http://www.zazzle.com/southpark/gifts?cg=196797668742337134 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref><ref name="Shirt6">{{Cite web |title=southpark: I Am Captain Cartman |work=[[Zazzle]] |date=2009-04-23 |url=http://www.zazzle.com/southpark/gifts?cg=196785291198159209 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref>

==Cultural references==
Ike indicates he will "vomit my balls out through my mouth" if he has to hear anything more about [[Susan Boyle]], the Scottish amateur singer who gained worldwide attention around the time of the episode's airing for her performance of the song "[[I Dreamed a Dream]]" from ''[[Les Mis<U+00E9>rables (musical)|Les Mis<U+00E9>rables]]'' on the show ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "Fatbeard" was watched by 2.59 million overall households, according to the [[Nielsen ratings]], making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Updated: ''WWE RAW'', ''NFL Draft'' and ''Yankees / Red Sox'' Lead Weekly Cable Viewing |last=Seidman |first=Robert |date=2009-04-28 |publisher=TV by the Numbers |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/04/28/wwe-raw-nfl-draft-and-yankees-red-sox-lead-weekly-cable-viewing/17595 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> The episode received generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of ''If'' magazine, who gave the episode an A- grade, particularly praised the Cartman and Ike characters and called the ending "perfect". Delgado said of the show's creators, "These guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through the news desk. And because ''South Park'' can be made in like a week<U+2014>and I<U+2019>m talking start to finish, from concept to finished product<U+2014>they end up being the most socially conscious and timely show on television today."<ref name="IfMag" /> Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the episode and the Somalian pirate song, and complimented the show for presenting the pirates as sympathetic human beings.<ref name="EW0422" /> Sean O'Neal of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said the portrayal of Somalian pirates was a predictable storyline, but said he enjoyed the episode because of the pacing: "Rather than a cobbled-together collection of gags, everything progressed very organically."<ref name="AVClub" /> IGN writer Travis Fickett said the episode was amusing but not exceptional. Fickett enjoyed the takeover of the French vessel and the extent to which Cartman's delusion about pirates takes him, but he said the pirate plot "isn't entirely in good taste (and) it never really gathers a full head of steam".<ref name="IGN0423" />
