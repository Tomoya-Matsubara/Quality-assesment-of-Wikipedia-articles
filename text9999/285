==Early years==
In 1996, voters in [[King County, Washington|King]], [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce]], and [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish]] counties approved increases in [[sales tax]]es and vehicle excise taxes to pay for a [[US$]]3.9 billion transit package that included $1.7 billion for a 25 mile light rail system. The system included a line in [[Tacoma, Washington]] and another line from the [[University District, Seattle, Washington|University District]] in north Seattle to [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Sea-Tac Airport]] south of Seattle, originally planned to open in 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2358535&date=19961106&query=light+rail | title=Voters Back Transit Plan On Fourth Try | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=David Schaefer | date=November 8, 1996 | accessdate=February 26, 2007}}</ref>  Two years later the recently created Sound Transit revealed an [[environmental impact analysis|environmental impact study]] that increased the cost of the project to [[US$]]2.2 billion and added three miles to the line by adding connections to [[Northgate, Seattle, Washington|Northgate]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2787123&date=19981204&query=Sound+Transit+Light+Rail | title=Big Plans For Light Rail -- Sound Transit Suggests 24-Mile Route From Seatac To Northgate | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=David Schaefer | date=December 4, 1998 | accessdate=February 24, 2007}}</ref> However, the EIS was quickly met with objections from the poorer neighborhoods south Seattle in [[Rainier Valley, Seattle|Rainier Valley]] that complained that the plan unfairly impacted their neighborhoods by having the line running on the surface instead of below ground like much of the rest of the route starting at Beacon Hill.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2940938&date=19990127&query=Sound+Transit+light+rail | title=The Light-Rail Transit Plan -- On Wrong Track? -- Many People Who Live And Work Along Martin Luther King Jr. Way South Believe The Current Transit Plan Unfairly Favors Residents Of North Seattle | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Tom Brune | coauthors=Barbara A.

== Dark years ==

Beginning in early 1999, the light rail program became beset with problems that mired Sound Transit and local governments in political ire. In late February 1999, a financial analysis stated that building light rail out as far as Northgate might not be possible for over a dozen years due to decreases in the amount of federal grant money available to local transit authorities and Seattle-North King County having used so much of its local taxing authority and ability to borrow money to pay for light rail.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2945777&date=19990223&query=Sound+Transit+light+rail | title=Light Rail To Northgate?

Differences between the University of Washington and Sound Transit over station locations, impacts from the route's running under several science buildings on the campus, and construction impact deferments threatened to delay the project and raise costs.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=4001808&date=20000128&query=%22light+rail%22  | title=All aboard?

This news prompted concerns that Sound Transit could lose out on $500 million in federal grants, but King County Executive [[Ron Sims]] said he had been in contact with FTA officials who said the grant was still possible.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=4053431&date=20001117&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Price puts tunnel on hold | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=November 17, 2000 | accessdate=February 27, 2007}}</ref> This announcement coincided with the resignation of light rail's chief, Paul Bay. Two weeks later, Lyndon Wilson Jr., the man credited with turning around [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]'s [[MAX Light Rail]] project, was tapped as the systems interim director.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=TT0T2FLEV&date=20001129&query=Lyndon+Wilson+Sound+Transit | title=Sound Transit taps Portlander | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Cindy Zetts | date=November 29, 2000 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>

Within days of Wilson's arrival, more bad news came out as new estimates from Sound Transit staff increased the cost of the 21-mile project from $1.9 billion to $3.8 billion and added three years to the construction time. The report cited the frequent changes made to the route in order to appease community members, third-parties, and the wishes of board members and the ambitious construction schedule as reasons for the cost increase.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=TTGI2KF2J&date=20001213&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Light-rail cost soars $1 billion | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=December 13, 2000 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref> Just days later, Capitol Hill business and civic leaders withdrew their support from the project due to concerns that two years of construction needed to build the station on Capitol Hill would drive customers away from area businesses and force those businesses to close.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=TTNO2NPGA&date=20001221&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Transit doubt runs deep on Capitol Hill | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Tim Boyer | date=December 21, 2000 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>

In January 2001, the Sound Transit board accepted a $500 million grant from the FTA even though the FTA had not completed the review of the project it started when the cost overruns were announced in December and had not offered Sound Transit the grant.  The decision effectively locked Sound Transit into building a 7-mile route from Lander Street to the University of Washington.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound12m&date=20010112&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Sound Transit votes to take $500 million | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=January 12, 2001 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref> Days later, the chairman of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies|House Appropriations transportation subcommittee]], [[Hal Rogers]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Kentucky|KY]]) sent a letter to [[Transportation Secretary]] [[Rodney E. Slater|Rodney Slater]] saying his committee could not approve the grant and requesting a review by the [[Inspector General]]. Despite this, Sound Transit was still optimistic that the grant would be approved later that week.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound18m&date=20010118&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Congressman wants to delay light-rail money | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=January 18, 2001 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref> [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jennifer Dunn]] (R-[[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]]), [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]'s ranking House Republican, voiced her support for the independent audit, but stopped short of calling for the FTA to not approve the grant.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound19m&date=20010119&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Dunn backs rail-project review | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=January 19, 2001 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref> Despite these questions, on his last day as Transportation Secretary, Rodney Slater, signed the agreement granting Sound Transit $500 million in annual installments through 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound20m&date=20010120&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Half-billion allocated for Sound Transit | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=January 20, 2001 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>

However, the grant approval still was not enough to prevent the resignation of Sound Transit's executive director, Bob White. White cited a need for new leadership to restore public confidence in the agency.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=webtransit23&date=20010123&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Sound Transit executive director resigns | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=January 23, 2001 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>

March was another difficult month for the light rail project. On March 9, Sound Transit's citizen oversight committee criticized the agency's optimistic assumptions about building costs, its reliance on receiving an additional $931 million in federal grants, and that the agency was in danger of repeating prior mistakes.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound09m&date=20010309&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Its own watchdog bites Sound Transit; panel fears light-rail budget unrealistic | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=March 9, 2001 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref> The next day, Representative Rogers summoned Sound Transit and its opponents to [[Washington, D.C]] to testify in front of his subcommittee about the "problem" project.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound10m&date=20010310&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Light rail labeled 'problem' project | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=March 10, 2001 | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref> By the end of March, Link light rail was in danger of losing its first installment of federal grant money as Rogers noted the project's local opposition, cost overruns, and reliance on record levels of federal money as troubling.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound30m&date=20010330&query=light+rail | title=Federal aid in jeopardy for light rail | author=Andrew Garber | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=March 30, 2001 | accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref>

In April, the [[Seattle City Council]]'s unwavering support started to falter when a proposal requesting a Sound Transit citizen panel to explore alternatives to light rail was proposed by Councilman [[Nick Licata]].  The proposal would have had little to no effect on Sound Transit's plans if it had passed in its proposed form, but by the time it passed the contents of the proposal had been replaced with language praising the agency and explaining the cost overruns as unavoidable and out of Sound Transit's control.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound04m&date=20010404&query=light+rail | title=Light rail survives attack: City Council rejects anti-Sound Transit move | author=Jim Brunner | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=April 4, 2001 | accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref> Avoiding the City Council's attack was only a short term victory as the next date the US Inspector General's office recommended that federal funding be suspended until the agency is able to provide a final estimate for the project. The Inspector General's report also estimated the cost of the project at $4.1 billion, meaning the cost of the project had increased by $2.5 billion in seven months.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=inspector05m0&date=20010405&query=light+rail | title=Suspension of light-rail funds urged | author=Andrew Garber | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=April 5, 2001 | accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref>  The day after the IG's report brought a suspension of the $75 million federal grant for the next year, Sound Transit learned that the $50 million grant from the current year was also in danger.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound06m&date=20010406&query=light+rail | title=Sound Transit troubles, Day 2 | author=Andrew Garber | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=April 6, 2001 | accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref>

== Shortening of the line ==

On April 9, Mayor [[Paul Schell]] sent a letter requesting that due to the challenges facing the northern segment of the route (South Lander Street to the [[University District, Seattle, Washington|University District]]), Sound Transit should focus on building the southern fourteen miles of the line.<ref name="South end">{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound10m&date=20010410&query=light+rail | title=Schell: Put South End segment of light rail first | author=Andrew Garber | coauthors=Jim Brunners | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=April 10, 2001 | accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref>  Schell's proposal was supported by one of his mayoral election rivals, [[Greg Nickels]], and King County Commissioner [[Ron Sims]], but Sims also suggested continuing the line beyond South Lander and into the [[Metro Bus Tunnel (Seattle)|bus tunnel]].<ref name="South end"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound11m&date=20010411&query=light+rail | title=Sims agrees: Start light rail in South End | author=Eric Pryne | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=April 11, 2001 | accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref> However, Councilman Licata was of the opinion that Schell's proposal didn't go far enough because it did not consider scrapping light rail completely and focusing the money on [[carpool lane]]s and expanding [[Seattle monorail|the monorail]].<ref name="South end"/>

Part of Schell's request was for the review board to find out if it would be possible to build the southern route without federal assistance, but within days Sound Transit's acting executive director said federal assistance would still be required, an opinion that was echoed by the acting light-rail director.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound12m&date=20010412&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Federal help needed even if light rail starts south | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=April 12, 2001 | accessdate=April 27, 2007}}</ref>  The day after saying the southern route could not be built without federal money, Sound Transit admitted that its current plans for light rail was no longer feasible due to a decrease in the amount of money it expected to get from the federal government, which caused at least a $190 million shortfall. However, there was hope that with modifications to the route, stations, or the amount of tunneling the full 21 miles could still be built.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound13m0&date=20010413&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Light rail can't be built as planned | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=April 13, 2001 | accessdate=April 27, 2007}}</ref> By the end of the month, Sound Transit staffers revealed that it was unlikely that the whole project could be completed before the end of the decade, but some of it could be completed.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound27m&date=20010427&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Light rail can't be finished by 2009 | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=April 27, 2001 | accessdate=April 27, 2007}}</ref>

Despite all of the problems with cost overruns and schedule slippages related to the project, a poll conducted by Elway Research for [[The Seattle Times]] and [[Northwest Cable News]] between April 28 and May 1 revealed that only 40 percent of Puget Sound voters wanted to put a stop to a project, with 37 percent wanting to build a smaller line with existing funds, and 14 percent in favor of increasing taxes to pay for the full line. This contrasts with when Sound Move passed in 1996. At that time, 54 percent of Seattle residents favored stopping the project.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=transitpoll06m&date=20010506&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Thin majority still backs some light rail | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Susan Gilmore | date=May 6, 2001 | accessdate=April 27, 2007}}</ref>

By the late May, Sound Transit's board began to seriously consider shortening the line, including what to do with the money allocated to light rail if it was scrapped.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound20m0&date=20010520&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Light-rail talk grim: Time to cut losses? | author=Andrew Garber | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=May 20, 2001 | accessdate=June 10, 2007}}</ref>  Support in the board began to form around four alternative plans, two of which included a tunnel through Capitol Hill that divided the board, with Ron Sims saying "Taking us to Capitol Hill is fatal to any light-rail project".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound25m&date=20010525&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Capitol Hill tunnel splits transit panel | author=Andrew Garber | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=May 25, 2001 | accessdate=June 10, 2007}}</ref> Sims would later join a group of current and former community leaders sent a letter to the board urging them to develop a route through [[South Lake Union, Seattle, Washington|South Lake Union]] to avoid the tunnel through Capitol Hill.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound15m&date=20010615&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Rail agency is urged to skip tunnel | author=Andrew Garber | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=June 15, 2001 | accessdate=June 10, 2007}}</ref>

In June, it was announced that two key staff members would be leaving the project, the interim director, Lyndon Wilson, and chief engineer, Bill Houppermans.  Two current staffers were chosen as interim replacements.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound06m&date=20010606&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Sound Transit losing two of its key people | author=Andrew Garber | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=June 6, 2001 | accessdate=June 10, 2007}}</ref>

The board decided to instruct staffers to focus their attention on building the southern segment of the line in late June and to provide alternatives to choose from by September.<ref name="Shorter line decision">{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound29m0&date=20010629&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Sound Transit looks south for its first line | author=Jim Brunner | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=June 29, 2001 | accessdate=June 10, 2007}}</ref> Supporters of the plan noted that by building the southern segment Sound Transit would be showing that they can get something built and that once it is built, money and support would follow. Critics said that by focusing on the southern segment the line wouldn't attract as many riders and that major population and job centers would not be serviced.<ref name="Shorter line decision"/>

== Light at the end of the tunnel ==

The decision to shorten the line from 21 miles to 14 miles marked a turning point for the embattled project. While the path to completion would not be trouble free, Sound Transit would at least make progress towards starting construction.

Amidst the turmoil caused by the resignation of two of the light rail projects high ranking members and decisions regarding the shortening of the line, Sound Transit received some good news when a federal court judge lifted a court injunction preventing them from contacting Rainier Valley residents about purchasing their property and tossed out a majority of the lawsuit filed by other Rainier Valley residents.<ref name="Lawsuit trimmed">{{cite news| url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=rail17m&date=20010717&query=light+rail | title=Light-rail suit cut down: Judge tosses out most claims made by Rainier Valley group | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=July 17, 2001 | accessdate=July 3, 2007}}</ref> Of the three issues in the lawsuit, the judge removed two of the claims made by the residents' group, the first claim that was tossed out was that Sound Transit was violating the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Fair Housing Act]] and the other that it was violating the [[National Environmental Policy Act]].  The one claim that the judge left in the lawsuit was whether Sound Transit intentionally discriminated against Rainer Valley by choosing a surface option instead of tunneling through the valley as it had done in more affluent and less racially and ethnically diverse neighborhoods.<ref name="Lawsuit trimmed"/> A month later, in August, the Rainier Valley group dropped the remaining issue of discrimination due to a lack of funds to continue the lawsuit and because Sound Transit had not yet finalized the route.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=soundtransit10m&date=20010810&query=light+rail | title=Rainier Valley group drops claim against Sound Transit | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Janet I. Tu | date=August 10, 2001 | accessdate=July 3, 2007}}</ref>

Light rail would soon have competition to provide mass transit to Seattle.  All three of the major candidates for mayor of Seattle in 2001 endorsed a [[monorail]] project despite no details being known about the project.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=monorail28m0&date=20010828&query=light+rail | title=Major mayoral hopefuls climb aboard monorail | author=Andrew Garber | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=August 28, 2001 | accessdate=July 3, 2007}}</ref> According to the head of the University of Washington's Transportation Research Center, "Maybe the best thing going for monorail is that it's not light rail." However, while the [[Seattle Monorail Project]] would ultimately pass a [[referendum]] in 2002, it too would be plagued by many of the same cost overruns and delays that afflicted Link Light Rail and in 2005, Seattle residents voted against a new plan and essentially killed the monorail project.

In September, the Sound Transit Board announced that they had enough money to fund a 14-mile route, later to be called [[Central Link]], that began in Downtown Seattle at the [[Washington State Convention and Trade Center]], proceeded through Downtown in the [[Metro Transit Tunnel]], then through Rainier Valley and Tukwila before ending one mile short of Sea-Tac Airport.<ref name=14-mile>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=transit13m&date=20010913&query=Light+Rail | title=Sound Transit says it can build 14-mile line; light rail stops short of airport | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Susan Kelleher | date=September 13, 2001 | accessdate=July 14, 2007}}</ref> The decision to stop this "starter" line a mile short of the airport would later be criticized by light rails opponents,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound28m&date=20010928&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title=Shorter light-rail line OK'd | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=September 28, 2001 | accessdate=July 14, 2007}}</ref> but the explanation provided by Sound Transit was that it was that the designs were not completed for a planned remodel of Sea-Tac<ref name=14-mile/> and that they only had $12 million to extend the line when the projected cost to do so was between $350 million and $500 million.<ref name=Initially_Approved>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound26m&date=20010926&query=Light+Rail | title=Light rail lite goes to vote tomorrow; 1st leg would link Seattle, Tukwila | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=September 26, 2001 | accessdate=July 14, 2007}}</ref> An audit by [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu|Deloitte & Touche]] discovered that while Sound Transit was much better than before, it still ran a risk of cost overruns by not having better procedures to control [[scope creep]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound27m&date=20010927&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title=Sound Transit's budget warning | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Andrew Garber | date=September 27, 2001 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref>

On September 25, the Sound Transit Board finally voted to approve the new, shorter, 14-mile line with an estimated cost of $2.1 billion, clearing the way for construction to begin as early as the summer of 2002. While concerns were raised that the project was wasting money, others noted that it was time to get construction started.<ref name=Initially_Approved/> The line was officially approved on November 29, but some opponents threatened lawsuits to stop construction.<ref name=Approved>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound30m0&date=20011130&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title= Sound Transit adopts 14-mile route; light-rail construction could start in summer | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Eric Pryne | date=November 30, 2001 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref>

At the end of 2001 and beginning of 2002, the project encountered more conflict.  After having most of their lawsuit dismissed by a federal judge in mid-July and then dropping the remainder in August, the Rainier Valley community group filed an appeal on December 26, stating the judge had incorrectly ruled when dismissing the discrimination claims.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=valley27m0&date=20011227&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title=Rail-line foes file appeal of ruling | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Eric Pryne | date=December 27, 2001 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> [[Tim Eyman]], a [[political activist]] known in Washington for filing anti-tax [[initiative]]s and referendums, filed an initiative that would remove an [[Excise tax in the United States|excise tax]] on car tabs that goes to transit,<ref name=initiative>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=eyman08m&date=20020108&query=%22light+rail%22 | title= Revised I-776 launched | publisher=The Seattle news | date=January 8, 2002 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> while another group of opponents threatened a referendum to block light rail from using the Downtown bus tunnel.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=tunnel09m&date=20020109&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title= Rail foes threaten to try referendum | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Eric Pryne | date=January 9, 2002 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> The result of the initiative, if passed, would remove $67 million of funding from Sound Transit's $270 million annual income.<ref name=initiative/> Yet another group questioned the legality of the shortened line, urged Sound Transit to have another public vote, and threatened legal action if Sound Transit did not listen to its urging.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=rail05m&date=20020205&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title= Light-rail foes open new battle | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Eric Pryne | date=February 5, 2002 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> Sound Transit declined the request citing that they would be required to pay for both their court costs and their opponents, bonds were not needed for another two years, and the legal proceedings would tie Sound Transit's hands politically.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sane01m&date=20020301&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title= Rail foes push for court ruling, but Sound Transit declines to test its own legality | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Eric Pryne | date=March 1, 2002 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref>

In late January 2002, Sound Transit began working to repair their image in the nation's capital and paid a visit to federal officials to show that the project had left behind its problems from the previous year.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=soundweb23&date=20020123&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title= Sound Transit officials, Seattle mayor visit nation's capital | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=January 23, 2002 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref>

[[Ron Sims]], Sound Transit's chairman, announced that it may be possible to extend the line to the University of Washington without raising taxes as long as route modifications to the route saved enough money, they were able to get help from the federal government, and their financial plans were changed to allow more borrowing.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound02m&date=20020302&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title= Sims: Light rail might reach U District without new taxes | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Eric Pryne | date=March 2, 2002 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> The route to the University had previously been narrowed down to two options both with tunnels under [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]], one under [[Montlake Cut]] and another near [[University Bridge (Seattle)|University Bridge]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound15m&date=20020215&query=%22Light+Rail%22 | title=Light-rail route options in north narrowed to two | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Eric Pryne | date=February 15, 2002 | accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref>

== Construction ==

In March 2002, Sound Transit began the process of acquiring land in the Rainier Valley when its board authorized the agency to purchase all of sixty-four properties and parts of two hundred and thirty-two others.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=sound15m&date=20020315&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Sound Transit gets green light to buy land for light rail | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Eric Pryne | date=March 15, 2002 | accessdate=July 21, 2007}}</ref> Sound Transit was also informed that Link Light Rail received a rating of "Recommended" from the Federal Transit Administration, making it eligible for federal funding. Critics of the project viewed it as further troubles for the project because prior to the previous year's problems the project had a rating of "Highly Recommended", while supporters viewed the rating as an affirmation of the progress the project had made since then.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=transit23m&date=20020323&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Light rail's rating slips a bit, but Sound Transit still eligible for federal money | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Peyton Whitely | date=March 23, 2002 | accessdate=July 21, 2007}}</ref>

In an attempt to ease the worries of Rainier Valley residents about the impact of light rail, Mayor Nickels proposed over $50 million in investments in the neighborhood, including paying off small business loans, burying power lines, and other [[community development]]s.  The proposal was unanimously approved by the city council, but not without some complaints that the timing of the funding was questionable as the city was facing budget cuts and that it was the city that was making the funding and not Sound Transit.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=rainierfund30m&date=20020430&query=%22light+rail%22 | title=Millions OK'd for Rainier Valley to mitigate effects of light rail | publisher=The Seattle Times | author=Jim Brunner | date=April 30, 2002 | accessdate=July 21, 2007}}</ref>

The main line from [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]] to Downtown Seattle (Westlake Center) is currently in service. The extension from Downtown to the University District via Capitol Hill will open in 2016.

== Temporary Link Light Rail Airport Connector Bus ==
[[Sound Transit]] contracted with [[Pierce Transit]] to operate an interim shuttle bus from the initial endpoint of [[Central Link]] at [[Tukwila International Boulevard (Link station)|Tukwila International Blvd Station]] to [[SeaTac/Airport (Link station)|SeaTac/Airport Station]] until the extension to the airport was finished. Pierce Transit was awarded the contract in February 2009, as an expansion of their contract to operate a connector bus between [[Tacoma Dome (Sounder station)|Tacoma Dome Station]] and Lakewood Station.<ref>http://www.soundtransit.org/documents/pdf/about/board/motions/2009/Motion%20M2009-20.pdf</ref> For the service Pierce Transit placed four 1991 [[Orion International|Orion I]] coaches back into service that had been mothballed for several years.<ref>http://www.busdude.com/HTML/PT_obi_1991_1508_439s.htm</ref> The Link airport connector ran every ten to fifteen minutes from both stops, and riders had to have a valid ticket, transfer, or pass to ride from Tukwila station to the Airport. This service ended at the end of the day on December 19, 2009, when direct service to the airport commenced.<ref>http://www.soundtransit.org/Documents/pdf/riding/airportconnector.pdf</ref>
