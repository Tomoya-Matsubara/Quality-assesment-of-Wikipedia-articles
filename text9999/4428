'''''Phineas and Ferb''''' (also known as '''''Disney's Phineas and Ferb''''') is an American [[animated television series]]. Originally broadcast as a preview on August 17, 2007 on [[Disney Channel]], the series follows two suburban<ref>{{cite episode|title=Leave the Busting to Us!| Season= 1|number= 26|credits=Writers: Bobby Gaylor, Martin Olson; Director: Zac Moncrief|channel=Disney Channel|series=Phineas and Ferb}}</ref> stepbrothers<ref name="AM1">{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/1|title= From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", Page 1.|author=Strike, Joe|work=Animation World Magazine|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> on summer vacation. Each day the pair devise ambitious, involved plans and inventions to stave off boredom, often bringing them into conflict with their snoopy sister. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the [[B-Plot]] almost always features the boys' pet [[platypus]] acting as a [[Espionage|secret agent]] to fight an evil scientist named Heinz Doofenshmirtz.

Creators [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] worked together on the [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. ''Phineas and Ferb'' was conceived after Povenmire sketched a triangular boy&nbsp;<U+2014> the blueprint for the titular Phineas&nbsp;<U+2014> in a restaurant. Povenmire and Marsh developed the series concept together and pitched to networks for 16 years before securing a run on the [[Disney Channel]].<ref name="AM1"/>

The series is also known for its musical numbers, which have appeared in every episode since the first-season "[[Flop Starz]]". Disney's managers particularly enjoyed the episode's song, "Gitchee, Gitchee Goo", and requested that a song appear in each subsequent episode.<ref name="AM2">{{cite web|url= http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/2|title= From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", Page 2.|author=Strike, Joe.|work=Animation World Magazine|date=February 1, 2008|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> The show's creators write and record each number, and vary musical tempo depending on each song's dramatic use.<ref name="MSN"/> The music has gotten the series two Emmy nods for songwriting in 2008.<ref name="Media">{{cite web|url=http://disneychannelmedianet.com/web/showpage/showpage.aspx?program_id=3113788&type=factsheet|title=Phineas and Ferb&nbsp;<U+2014> Show description|work=Disney Channel Medianet|author=Yoo, Jean|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Platypus.jpg|thumb|left|A platypus was included in the series due to its interesting appearance.<ref name="QA"/>]]
The series' main characters live in a [[blended family]], a premise the creators considered underused in children's programming and which reflected Marsh's own upbringing. Marsh considers explaining the family background "not important to the kid's lives. They are a great blended family and that's all we need to know."<ref name="Tampa">{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/parenting/article993119.ece|title=Quick wit, funny characters drive ''Phineas and Ferb''|author=Robinson, Sherry|date=2009-04-18|accessdate=2009-08-16|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|location=[[St. Petersburg, Florida]]}}</ref> The choice of a [[platypus]] as the boys' pet was similarly inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit its striking appearance.<ref name="QA">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0bc78baf8235f8b4159fd786ff9f8736|title= Q&A: Dan Povenmire|archiveurl= http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:h-TlYnF0OCMJ:www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0bc78baf8235f8b4159fd786ff9f8736+Emmy+nominee+Dan+Povenmire&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a|archivedate=2009-07-31|author= Bond, Paul.|date= 7 June, 2009|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> The platypus also gives them freedom to "make stuff up" since "no one knows very much about [them]."<ref name="Tampa"/>

The creators sought to distinguish the show by characterizing its cast as fun-loving, not spiteful or cruel. Marsh called the characters "cool, edgy and clever without [...] being mean-spirited." According to Povenmire, their animation director, Rob Hughes, agreed: "in all the other shows every character is either stupid or a jerk, but there are no stupid characters or jerks in this one."<ref name="AM2"/>

''Phineas and Ferb'' follows structural conventions Povenmire and Marsh developed while writing ''Rocko's Modern Life'', whereby each episode features "a song or a musical number, plus a big action/chase scene".<ref name="AM2"/> Both creators had musical backgrounds, as Povenmire performed rock 'n' roll music in his college years<ref name="USC"/> and Marsh's grandfather was the bandleader [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]].<ref name="411 news"/>

The creators' original pitch to Disney emphasized Perry's signature "secret agent theme" and the song ''Gitchee Gitchee Goo'' from the episode "[[Flop Starz]]". Disney's managers enjoyed the songs and asked Povenmire and Marsh to write one for each episode.<ref name="AM2"/>

The songs span many genres, from [[16th-century]] [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]] to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[show tunes]].<ref name="AM2"/> Each is written in an intensive session during episode production: a concept, score, and lyrics are developed quite quickly.<ref name="MSN">{{cite video|url= http://tv.msn.com/phineas-and-ferb/?gt1=28137&silentchk=1&|title= A Day With 'Phineas and Ferb' |archiveurl=http://entertainment.msn.com/news/article.aspx?news=352619|publisher=MSN TV.|accessdate=July 2, 2009|archivedate=2009-07-31}}</ref> Together, Marsh and Povenmire can "write a song about almost anything" and in only one hour at most.<ref name="Tampa"/> After they finish writing the song, Povenmire and Marsh sing it over the [[answering machine]] of series composer Danny Jacob on Friday nights.

The title sequence music, performed by American band [[Bowling for Soup]],<ref name="ex"/> was nominated for an [[Emmy]] award in 2008.<ref name="Media"/> The creators originally wrote a slower number, more like a "classic Disney song", but the network felt changes were needed to appeal to modern children and commissioned a rock/alternative version which made the final cut.<ref name="OSP"/>

==Origins==
===Early inspirations===
Co-creator Dan Povenmire attributes the show's genesis to growing up in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]], where his mother told him never to waste a day of summer. To occupy himself Povenmire undertook projects like hole-digging and home movie-making. Povenmire recalled, "My mom let me drape black material all the way across one end of our living room to use as a space field. I would hang little models of spaceships for these little movies I made with a Super 8 camera."<ref name="AM1"/><ref name="OSP">{{cite video|title=Original Pitch By Dan Povenmire|medium=DVD|people=Dan Povenmire, Jeff "Swampy" Marsh|publisher=[[Disney DVD]]|year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://blog.al.com/entertainment-press-register/2008/05/disney_animator_sees_summers_i.html#more|title= Disney animator sees summers in Mobile as inspiration|author=Brantley, Mark|work= Alabama press|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}</ref> Artwork wise, he was a prodigy and displayed his very detailed drawings at art shows.<ref name="USC"/> Meanwhile, Marsh grew up in a large, blended family.<ref name="411 news"/> As with Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in several different activities in order to have fun.<ref name="AM2"/>

===Conception===
[[File:Phineas original sketch.jpg|thumb|Drawn on [[butcher paper]], this first drawing of Phineas began a rapid growth of characters and the outline of the artistic style.<ref name="AM2"/>]]
When Povenmire grew up, he went to the [[University of Southern California]] and started a daily comic strip called ''Life is a Fish,'' getting money from the merchandise that was designed based on his series. Povenmire eventually dropped out and started drawing people on street corners to make a living, until he was finally called by [[Tommy Chong]] to work on a short bit of animation in the film ''[[Far Out Man]].'' Povenmire began to take up animation professionally, working on shows such as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.<ref name="USC">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://74.125.113.132/search?q=cache:CdA_4QDEdOcJ:www.dailytrojan.com/2.1792/usc-dropout-makes-it-big-in-animation-1.201942+basically+brushed+me+off+Dan+povenmire&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a|archivedate=2009-09-24 |title= USC dropout makes it big in animation|author=Perez, Lauren|date=May 12, 2008|work=[[Daily Trojan]]|url=http://www.dailytrojan.com/2.1792/usc-dropout-makes-it-big-in-animation-1.201942|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> Marsh had become a vice president of sales and marketing for a computer company, until he "freaked out" and decided to quit. His friend helped him put together a portfolio and go into the animation business.<ref name="411 news"/>

Povenmire and Marsh eventually started working across from each other as [[layout artist]]s on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. The two bonded over mutual tastes in humor and music, becoming fast friends. They continued their working relationship as a writing team on the Nickelodeon series ''Rocko's Modern Life,''<ref name="AM1"/> where they conceived the idea for their own series<ref name="AM1"/> Whilst eating dinner at a Wild Thyme restaurant in [[South Pasadena, California]], Povenmire drew a quick sketch of a "triangle kid" on [[butcher paper]]<ref name="AM3">{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/3|title= From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", Page 3.|author=Strike, Joe|work=Animation World Magazine|date=February 1, 2008|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref>. He tore it out and called Marsh that night to report, "Hey, I think we have our show."<ref name="QA"/>

The triangle [[doodle]] sparked rapid development of characters and designs.<ref name="AM3"/> Povenmire decided that his sketch "looked like a Phineas", and named Ferb after a friend who "owns more tools than anyone in the world."<ref name="CC"/> The creators based their character designs on angular shapes in homage to the famous ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' animator/director [[Tex Avery]], adding geometric shapes to the backgrounds for continuity.<ref name="AM3"/>

===Pitching and pickup===
[[File:Disneychannelheadquarters.jpg|thumb|168px|right|[[Disney Channel]] was the first network to give the series a chance, though initially declined when [[Dan Povenmire]] originally pitched it to them.]]
Their early attempts to pitch the show failed and, though they remained committed to the concept, Povenmire and Marsh began to drift apart after their work on ''Rocko's''. Marsh moved to [[London, England|London]] and worked on shows including ''[[Postman Pat]]'' and ''[[Bounty Hamster]].'' Povenmire began working on the primetime FOX show ''[[Family Guy]],''<ref name="AM1"/> always carrying a ''Phineas and Ferb'' portfolio<ref name="QA"/> for convenient pitching to networks like [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Fox Kids]]. These networks passed on the show, believing the series' premise was too complex to succeed.<ref name="AM1"/>

Povenmire persisted and later pitched the series to Nickelodeon, where it was considered by high-level executives but rejected again as too complicated.<ref name="AM1"/> Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney. The network did not immediately accept the show, but told Povenmire they would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed this meant an end to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually "means they throw it in the trash later." Disney then surprised him by accepting.<ref name="USC"/> Said Povenmire, "Disney was the first to say, 'Let's see if you can do it in 11 minutes.' We did it in the pilot and they said, 'Let's see if you can do it for 26 episodes.'"<ref name="AM2"/>

Povenmire worried that his work on ''Family Guy''<U+2014>an adult show known for its lowbrow humor<U+2014>would concern Disney, which markets primarily to children. But the Disney Channel's Senior Vice President of Original Series, Adam Bonnett, was a ''Family Guy'' fan who appreciated Povenmire's connection to the show and received his pitch well.<ref name="AM2"/>

After the Disney Channel accepted the show, Povenmire and Marsh turned their attention to the company's overseas executives. Instead of a normal script, the two drew out storyboards and played them in a reel. Povenmire voiced over the reel with his dialogue and added sound effects. This novel approach secured the executives' support.<ref name="OSP"/>

==Production==
===Writing style===
The show uses four major writers to devise story ideas according to "strict guidelines", such as that the boys' schemes never be "magical." Stories are reviewed at weekly sessions on a Monday, then simultaneously scripted and storyboarded. A very rough design is built before the storyboard, featuring little more than suggested scenes and dialogue, is drafted; the writers then gather for a "play-by-play" walkthrough of the storyboard in front of the whole crew, whose reactions to the jokes are assessed before rewrites are made.<ref name="Rocko">{{cite web|url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=134287|title='Rocko' writers return to TV with 'Phineas and Ferb'|work=Reading Eagle|date=April 18, 2009|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> The writers as well include running gags in every episode, which are generally lines spoken by characters.<ref name="AM1"/><ref name="trails"/> Almost every episode is set into two eleven-minute segments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/10314|title=''Phineas and Ferb'' Creators Talk About Emmy Nom!|author=Zahed, Ramin|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref>

===Visual aspects and animation===

Dan Povenmire said of this inclusion, "There's a little bit of Tex Avery in there&nbsp;<U+2014> he had that very graphic style [in his later cartoons]."<ref name="AM3"/> Triangles are featured as an [[easter egg]] in the background of every episode, sometimes in trees or buildings.<ref name="411 news"/>

Bright colors are also a prominent element of the animation. Marsh elaborates, "The idea at the end of the day was candy. One of the things that I think works so well is that the characters are so bright and candy-colored and our backgrounds are a much more realistic depiction of the world: the soft green of the grass, the natural woods for the fence. In order for all of the stuff {{sic}} that they do to work, their world needs to be grounded in reality." The designers sought to keep their characters visually simple, so that kids "would easily be able to draw [them] themselves." Characters were also crafted to be recognizable from a distance, a technique the creators say is based on [[Matt Groening]]'s goal of making characters recognizable by silhouette.<ref name="411 news">{{cite web|url=http://www.resource411.com/411Update/Issue/Articles/Story.cfm?StoryID=1020|title=Phineas and Ferb: Music, Mischief, And The Endless Summer Vacation|work=411 News|author=Galas, Marjorie|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}</ref>

The show's casting organization is responsible for selecting most of the [[voice actors]] and actresses, choosing actors such as [[Vincent Martella]] and [[Mitchel Musso]] for major roles based on perceived popularity with target demographics. Co-creators [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] select guest stars, casting people that they "really want to work with".

==Reception and achievements==
===Reviews===
''Phineas and Ferb'' has received generally very positive reviews. The ''[[New York Times]]'' commented favorably, describing the show as "''[[Family Guy]]'' with an espionage subplot and a big dose of magical realism".

[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] noted the show's appeal to all ages with its "sense of wit and irreverence."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935998.html?categoryid=32&cs=1|title=Phineas and Ferb Review|author=Lowry, Brian|date=January 31, 2008|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-08-20}}</ref> Similar reviews have emphasized the series' popularity with adults; ''Elastic Pop'''s Rebecca Wright wrote, in a review for the volume one DVD, "As an adult, I really enjoyed watching this Phineas and Ferb DVD, and I think it is one that the whole family can enjoy." Wright also called the series' "irreverent style" reminiscent of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]].''<ref name="EP">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://74.125.113.132/search?q=cache:rFTOlDTLJdsJ:www.elasticpop.com/2008/08/dvd-review-phineas-and-ferb-th.htm+As+an+adult,+I+really+enjoyed+watching+this+Phineas+and+Ferb+DVD,+and+I+think+it+is+one+that+the+whole+family+can+enjoy&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a|archivedate=2009-09-24|url=http://www.elasticpop.com/2008/08/dvd-review-phineas-and-ferb-th.htm|title=DVD Review: Phineas and Ferb&nbsp;<U+2014> The Fast and the Phineas|author=Wright, Rebecca|date=August 5, 2008|work=Elastic Pop|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'s'' Matt Blum has stated in reviews on the series that he "can stand to watch just about anything with <nowiki>[his]</nowiki> kids, but <nowiki>[he]</nowiki> actually look<nowiki>[s]</nowiki> forward to watching ''Phineas and Ferb'' with them."<ref name="wired"/>

Among the negative reviews is one that charges the series with a lack of originality. Maxie Zeus of Toon Zone argued that the show is "derivative, but obviously so, and shorn of even the best features of what has been stolen." Zeus took issue with the writing, feeling that certain jokes and conventions were "ripped-off" from other shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/articles/21300/phineas-and-ferb-spawn-of-frankenstein|title="Phineas and Ferb": Spawn of Frankenstein|work=Toon Zone|author=Zeus, Maxie|date=February 1, 2008|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> Kevin McDonough of ''Sun Coast Today'' criticized the show for it's plot complexity, constant action, and "characters [that] can do just about anything." McDonough stated that "it's never clear whether P&F are intended to entertain children or are merely a reflection of grown-up animators engaged in a juvenile lark."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080201/LIFE/802010340|title='Phineas and Ferb' is frantic from start to finish|work=Sun Coast Today|author=McDonough, Kevin|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2009-08-20}}</ref> Marylin Moss of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described ''Phineas and Ferb'' as "Pretty mindless but kids of all ages might find a humorous moment in it."

In 2009 Disney licensed a [[Nintendo DS]] game, simply titled "[[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|Phineas and Ferb]]." The game's story follows Phineas and Ferb as they try to build a roller coaster to alleviate boredom over the summer. The player controls Phineas, Ferb, and occasionally Agent P. Phineas scavenges for spare parts for the roller coaster while Ferb fixes various objects around town, gaining access to new areas as a result. Ferb can also construct new parts of the roller coaster and its vehicle-themed carts. Each activity features a short mini-game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/16586-phineas-and-ferb-ds-game-review |title=Phineas and Ferb :: DS Game Review |publisher=Kidzworld |date= |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/phineas-and-ferb|title=Phineas and Ferb&nbsp;<U+2014> Nintendo DS|work=GameSpy|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/game/phineas-and-ferb/11032|title=Phineas and Ferb Video Game|work=Game Trailers|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref> The game was well received and garners a 76.67% on [[GameRankings]].<ref name="GR">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/DS/955460-phineas-and-ferb/index.html|title=Phineas and Ferb for the DS|work=Game Rankings|accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref> Povenmire and Marsh have announced that there is a ''Phineas and Ferb'' [[Wii]] game in development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/09/phineas-and-ferb-interview/|title=''Phineas and Ferb:'' A Sci-Fi Episode, a Soundtrack Album, and an Interview!|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=2009-09-18|accessdate=2009-09-20|author=Blum, Matt}}</ref>
