'''Atari Democrat''', a phrase first popularized during the early 1980s, references both the [[video game]] company [[Atari]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic legislators]] who suggested that the support and development of [[high tech]] and related businesses would stimulate the economy and create jobs.

==Definition==
The definition of an ''Atari Democrat'' varies. A 1984 article for the ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]],'' defined the term as "a young [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] trying to push the party toward more involvement with high-tech solutions."<ref name="motherlode">{{Citation

}}</ref> The ''New York Times'' also discussed a gender gap which developed during the 1980s between  older liberals who maintained an interest in traditional visions of [[social liberalism]] and Atari Democrats who attempted to find a middle ground:

{{cquote|When the ''Atari Democrats'' first emerged in the early [[Reagan Administration|Reagan years]], their commitments to free markets and investment won them much criticism from older liberals, who considered their [[neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] as warmed-over [[Reaganomics|Reaganism]]. Mr. Leahy, who combines his environmentalism with an old-fashioned commitment to social programs, argues that the cutbacks of the Reagan years suggested that it had been a mistake for members of his Congressional class to take the old programs for granted. But some of the Atari Democrats argue that their commitment to innovative uses of markets and to the environment are complementary. Mr. Wirth, for example, has sought to bring his two passions together by arguing that market forces can be harnessed to protect the environment and work better than 'command-and-control regulations.' <ref name=nytgreen/>}}

==Politicians==
Specific individuals have been identified with ''Atari Democrats''. [[Al Gore]]'s "passion for technological issues, from biomedical research and genetic engineering to the environmental impact of the "greenhouse effect," linked him with other technophiles on Capitol Hill known as ''Atari Democrats.''"<ref name=biosen>{{cite web
