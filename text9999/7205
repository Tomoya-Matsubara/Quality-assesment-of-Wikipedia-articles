'''Roach Motel''' is a brand of a [[roach bait]] device designed to catch [[cockroach]]es. Although the term is the subject of a [[trademark]] registration by the insect control brand [[Black Flag (insecticide)|Black Flag]], the phrase has come to be used as a reference to all traps that use a [[scent]] or other form of [[bait (luring substance)|bait]] to lure cockroaches into a compartment in which a sticky substance causes them to become trapped. Introduced in late 1976 in response to the success of D-Con's roach trap, the Roach Motel quickly became a successful entrant in the industry. By 1979, ''[[New York Magazine]]'' reported:

Early versions of the Roach Motels used food-based bait, but later designs incorporated [[pheromone]]s. The widely known [[tagline]] of the Roach Motel was "Roaches check in, but they don't check out!" 

The name "Roach Motel" is United States federal trademark No. 1,059,314, for which Black Flag claims a date of earliest use of May 7, 1976.
