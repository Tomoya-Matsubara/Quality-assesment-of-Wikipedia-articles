==History==
Melkridge lies close to the ancient course of [[Hadrian's Wall]], one of the most significant Roman monuments in Britain.  Hadrian's Wall was constructed in [[122]] [[AD]]. The extent of Hadrian's Wall is 117 kilometres, spanning the width of Britain; the wall incorporated [[Agricola]]'s Ditch and was constructed mainly of stone in the eastern reaches<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18177 C.Michael Hogan (2007) ''Hadrian's Wall'', ed. Andy Burnham, The Megalithic Portal]</ref> such as at Melkridge.  The wall was constructed primarily to prevent raids by small [[Pict]]ish bands or unwanted [[immigration]] from the north, not as a fighting line for a major invasion.<ref>Stephen Johnson (2004) ''Hadrian's Wall'', Sterling Publishing Company, Inc, 128 pages, ISBN 0713488409</ref>
