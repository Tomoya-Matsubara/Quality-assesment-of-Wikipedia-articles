'''''Supernature''''' is the third [[album]] by British [[Electronic music|electronic]] duo [[Goldfrapp]]. It was released by [[Mute Records]] on 22 August 2005 in the United Kingdom, and was the duo's first album to receive mixed reviews. Most critics complimented its blend of [[Pop music|pop]] and electronic music, while others called it uninspiring.<ref name="metacritic">[http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/goldfrapp/supernature?q=supernature "''Supernature'' by Goldfrapp"]. Metacritic.com.

The album represented a change in Goldfrapp's musical style, and featured pop and electronic-dance music; inspirations were [[Disco|disco music]] artist [[Donna Summer]] and [[New Wave (music)|New Wave]] band [[New Order]]. ''Supernature'' received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination in 2007 for "[[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Electronic/Dance Album]]".<ref name="grammy">[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx#02 "2007 Grammy Award Nominations"].

==Recording and production==
''Supernature'' contains music in the same pop and electronic-dance styles featured on Goldfrapp's 2003 album ''[[Black Cherry (album)|Black Cherry]]'' (especially ''Black Cherry'''s singles "[[Strict Machine]]" and "[[Twist (Goldfrapp song)|Twist]]"), but it focuses on subtle [[hook (music)|hook]]s instead of large choruses. Goldfrapp's lead singer [[Alison Goldfrapp]] called the album's writing process "an electronic, glam cross between [[Berlin]], [[New York]] and north-east [[Somerset]]",<ref name="disco">[http://www.chartsingles.net/news/music-news/1252/ "Week 34 Chart Roundup"]. ChartSingles.net. 30 August 2005. Retrieved 18 February 2006.</ref> and said that she was inspired by artists such as [[Donna Summer]] and [[New Order]].<ref name="disco"/>

Goldfrapp and [[Will Gregory]] recorded the bulk of ''Supernature'' in late 2004 in the countryside of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England<U+2014>the same place they recorded ''Black Cherry''. They had rented a small house and spent some months writing music; they later explained that the unpopulated location kept them from distractions and that the majority of the process was "very basic".<ref name="rollingstone">Lash, Jolie.

''[[Rolling Stone]]''. 7 March 2006. Retrieved 25 March 2006.</ref> Goldfrapp has said that the duo respect certain boundaries when writing [[lyrics]],<ref name="cmj">Grow, Kory.

In an interview with ''[[College Music Journal]]'', Goldfrapp explained that they had never intended to create [[dance music]].<ref name="cmj"/> However, the singles released from ''Black Cherry'' were successes across nightclubs in North America, and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album.<ref name="billboardsingles">[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=408637&model.vnuAlbumId=766707 "Billboard U.S. Single Positions"].

Retrieved 25 March 2006.</ref> Before its composition, the duo avoided the use of the guitar because of the guitar's overly recognizable rhythm.<ref name="cmj"/> [[Four-on-the-floor]] [[bass drum]]s are also present on several of the album's tracks, and the [[piano pop|piano]] [[ballad]] "Let It Take You" features evening-effects composed on a synthesizer.<ref name="dvd">''Supernature''.

Alison Goldfrapp named the Roland String synth as one of her favourite [[musical keyboard|keyboards]].<ref name="keyboard"/> "Number 1" features an old synth and a [[bass guitar|bass]] arrangement that the group began to use frequently after recording the song. Another Roland String model, the SH-09, is another favourite; she played the duo's song "[[Train (Goldfrapp song)|Train]]" (2003) on it and enjoys the sounds that it makes.<ref name="keyboard"/> Goldfrapp was also impressed by a Russian synth, enamored with its [[Russian language|Russian-language writing]].<ref name="keyboard"/>

==Critical response==
''Supernature'' received mixed reviews from pop music critics. In a review for [[PopMatters]], Adrien Begrand said that "although ''Supernature'' lacks the imagination of ''Felt Mountain'' and the saucy brilliance of ''Black Cherry'', it doesn't pander to the pop crowd".<ref name="popmatters">Begrand, Adrien.
