The '''Battle of Muong Khoua''' took place between April 13 and May 18, 1953, in northern [[Laos]] during the [[French Indochina War]]. A garrison of a dozen [[France|French]] and 300 [[Laos|Laotian]] troops occupied a fortified outpost in the hills above the village of Muong-Khoua, across the border from [[Dien Bien Phu]]. Moung-Khoua was among the last French outposts in Northern Laos, following the decision of the French High Command to string several isolated garrisons through the region to buy time to fortify the major Laotian cities against Viet-Minh invasion. 

Many of these garrisons were given orders by radio to dig in and fight the approaching Viet-Minh forces. Following the fall of a satellite strong point at Sop-Nao, the troops at Moung-Khoua, under Captain Teullier, resisted a [[Viet-Minh]] siege force for thirty-six days while supported by air-dropped supplies and [[air strikes]]. The small French force resisted several direct attacks and enduring a series of artillery bombardments. Two of the three strong points of the outpost eventually fell in the early morning of May 18, and by mid-day the French force lay defeated. 

Four soldiers &ndash; two French and two Laotian &ndash; reached another French position 80 kilometres away after six days of travel through the jungle, however no one else was recovered. The resistance of the French garrison became a popular rallying cry for French troops in [[Indochina]], as well serving as a precursor to French and Viet-Minh strategies at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] the following year.<ref name="street without joy">{{cite book|last=Fall|first=Bernard B.|title=Street Without Joy|publisher=The Stackpole Company|date=1961|pages=116-130|isbn=0811732363}}</ref> 

==Prelude==
===Viet-Minh in Laos===

In early 1953, the Viet-Minh under [[Vo Nguyen Giap]] commenced an invasion of [[Laos]] to exert additional pressure on [[Paris]] and the French forces stationed in Indochina. The long supply lines of several divisions were enabled by the work of 200,000 porters.<ref name="vietnam at war"/> In the area of Muong Khoua, it was the Viet-Minh 312th, 308th and 316th Divisions.<ref name="vietnam at war"/> The French command &ndash; headed then by [[Raoul Salan]] &ndash; ordered the series of French outposts in Northern Laos to resist the Viet-Minh invading forces for as long as possible to enable the fortification of [[Luang Prabang]] and [[Vientiane]], the capital cities of Laos. The [[King of Laos]], [[Sisavang Vong]], remained in Luang Prabang, which added greater impetus to French efforts.<ref name="street without joy"/> The terrain of Northern Laos, and the local climate, isolated many of the outposts with night-time [[fog]] &ndash; known as ''crachin'' &ndash; thick jungle, a lack of roads and steep terrain. Each were given a certain number of days to withstand Viet-Minh forces, including Muong-Khoua which was issued its orders on April 13 to hold for fourteen days &ndash; until April 27.<ref name="street without joy"/>

Muong-Khoua, together with its satellite outpost Sop-Nao, was under the command of Captain Teullier, with the satellite outpost being overseen by Lieutenant Gr<U+00E9>zy. Muong-Khoua was situated at the confluence of the rivers Nam Pak and Nam Hou, 40 miles from Dien Bien Phu, and approximately 100 miles to the south-west of the [[Black River]] in [[Vietnam]].<ref name="vietnam at war"/> The outpost itself consisted of three separate strongholds, referred to as ''The Mousetrap'', ''Pi'' and ''Alpha'', situated on three hills to the west, south-south-east and south-south-west of the confluence of the Nam Hou and Nam Pak. Each were roughly 200 meters from the other, forming a triangle. The village of Muong-Khoua itself lay at the western foot of ''The Mousetrap'', protected from the river by a large [[sandbank]], and striding the road to Phong Saly, another French outpost 50 miles to the north.<ref name="street without joy"/>

===Sop-Nao===

Sop-Nao lay 30 miles to the east of Muong-Khoua, along the path of Viet-Minh advance; roughly 20 miles south-west of Dien Bien Phu, and only a few miles from the Vietnam-Laos border, and 75 miles south of the [[T'ai]] Highlands. Gr<U+00E9>zy, the French Lieutenant in command of the Sop-Nao garrison, commanded a reinforced platoon. On the evening of April 3 a Viet-Mind battalion entered Laos near Dien Bien Phu and [[Battle of Na San|Na San]] and reached Sap-Nao.<ref name="street without joy"/><ref name="vietnam at war"/> 

Finding themselves surrounded by the Viet-Minh, the French at Sop-Nao withstood for six days while in radio contact with Teullier at the mother-strong point. The survivors, following authorisation from the French Captain, retreated during the night of April 9/10 along a round-about route following the assumption by Gr<U+00E9>zy that the Viet-Minh had laid ambushes along the most direct path. The French hacked a new path through the jungle until they reached Laotian tribesmen on April 11, who warned them of Viet-Minh units following them. The French attempted to turn for Phong-Saly to the north, and met an allied convoy travelling down the Nam Hou in [[canoe]]s. The two forces combined, and sailed down the river towards Muong-Khoua.<ref name="street without joy"/>

On April 12, the convoy ran into a Viet-Minh ambush 600 yards from the Muong-Khoua strong point. Using a barrier of floating tree trunks, the Viet-Minh attacked the convoy with machine guns and mortars which destroyed the first canoe. The remaining French and Laotian troops returned fire, and with the assistance of forces from Muong-Khoua who had heard the firing, routed the Viet-Minh troops, who left 13 dead and four wounded behind. The French themselves suffered seven missing, one dead and one wounded. The remainder joined the French at Muong-Khoua, with the canoe's and the convoy's equipment incorporated into the defence. Meanwhile, the 910th Battalion of the 148th Regional Regiment of the 312th Division,<ref name="vietnam at war">{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Phillip B.|title=Vietnam At War|publisher=Oxford University Press US|date=1991|pages=150-156|isbn=019506792}}</ref> and a heavy mortar company from the 316th Division, drew near.<ref name="street without joy"/>

==Battle==
===Siege===

While the French troops from Sop-Nao were making their way via canoe to the mother-strong point, Teullier and his forces were noting what Fall referred to as ''L'asphyxie par le vide'' (choking-off by creating a void) &ndash; the result of a Viet-Minh presence which the French viewed as an indicator of imminent enemy attack. The local villagers no longer spoke to the French, when they had previously been communicative, and the population began leaving; both the farms and the markets were deserted.<ref name="street without joy"/> Referred to officially as a "relatively small" force,<ref name="relatively small"/> the 300 ''Chasserus Laotiens'' and "handful"<ref name="street without joy"/> of French [[NCO]]s and two officers were equipped with three 81mm and two 60mm mortars and two machine guns, and were ordered on April 13 to hold for fourteen days by Colonel [[Boucher de Cr<U+00E9>vecoeur]], who promised air support.<ref name="street without joy"/>

At 2300 hours that evening, April 13, mortar shells began landing on the slopes of ''Alpha''.<ref name="street without joy"/><ref name="vietnam at war"/> These bombardments would take place every night, and the Viet-Minh launched their first direct assault which failed and left 22 dead. This defeat prompted a reversion to previous tactics of slowly "gnawing away" at the French outpost, and Giap ordered the 312th to leave some forces behind to continue a siege while the remainder of the Division moved on.<ref name="vietnam at war"/> Meanwhile overhead, French [[B-26]]s bombed Viet-Minh positions, and cargo planes dropped supplies, 'Luciole' flares, and ammunition on the French positions.<ref name="street without joy"/> This 'air bridge' enabled the garrison to survive, and fourteen days later on April 27 it remained intact; the French High Command dropped a [[Legion of Honor]] and several [[Croix de Guerre]]s for Teullier and a number of his men respectively. Teullier and a small group left ''The Mousetrap'' to deliver the relevant decorations to ''Pi'' and ''Alpha'', however movement between the positions was otherwise extremely difficult.<ref name="street without joy"/> 

Was was possible, however, was a small patrol through the village of Muong Khoua, which had been by now deserted. These French patrols served as an early warning system and an ambush for Viet-Minh assaults during the ''crachin''-dominated night. This pattern continued into May. Meanwhile, French forces liberated [[Xieng Khouang]] and reached a position 40 miles from Muong Khoua.<ref name="street without joy"/> On May 17, the French patrol deployed to the Muong Khoua village overheard barking dogs &ndash; one of which yelped &ndash; alerting the French to an impending Viet-Minh attack. By 2300, the Viet-Minh were visible in the fog, and the patrol returned to ''The Mousetrap''. Teullier issued an alert via radio.<ref name="street without joy"/>

A bombardment from [[Soviet Russia]] 120mm mortars and 57mm [[Recoilless rifle|recoilless guns]] and [[phosphorous]] grenades begun at 0030 on May 18. Teullier instructed radio operator Sergeant Ren<U+00E9> Novak to request air-dropped flares and air support, while mortar fire landed on ''Alpha'' and ''The Mousetrap'', but not ''Pi'', where Gr<U+00E9>zy was in command. ''Pi'' continued to support the other two areas of the outpost with its own mortar fire.

By 0110 hours, the western flank of ''Mousetrap'' fell to Viet-Minh bombardment. By 0130, the garrison was informed that weather conditions prevented air support, and by 0230 the Viet-Minh forces launched successive assault waves which overran Teullier and his men, including attacks which flanked the position using the nearby sandbanks. At the same time, ''Alpha'' was overran by Viet-Minh forces, and by 0350 no more firing was heard on ''The Mousetrap''.<ref name="street without joy"/> ''Alpha'' survived the remainder of the night, and was seen fighting by French aircraft at 0900 later that morning.<ref name="street without joy"/> [[C-47]] transport craft returned to resume supply drops, however by 1200 the [[Tricolor]] and the [[Laos]] flag had been removed from ''Pi''{{'}}s command bunker.<ref name="street without joy"/>

===Survivors===

{{Quote box
 | quote ="Like Christ off the Cross" was an expression which became current in Indochina to describe survivors from those harrowing retreats through the jungle. And usually that is exactly what they looked like: worn down to skeletons from hunder and dysentery, sunken eyes, the typical tropical pallor... their emaciated faces curtained by shaggy bears, and their skins covered with festering sores, from heat rash to leech bites and jungle rot.

On May 22, four days after the fall of the Muong-Khoua garrison, French Sergeant Novak, the garrison radio operator, and two Laotian soldiers reached the only remaining French outpost in northern Laos, Phong-Saly. Fall records "he was only twenty-five years old, but he looked fifty; he kept on walking like an automaton to the centre of the post before he was stopped by come of the men staring at him as at a ghost."<ref name="street without joy"/> Novak and the two other soldiers had spent the four days moving through the jungle of Laos following the defeat of their unit. Two days later, Sergeant Pierre Blondeau also arrived at the outpost. His account detailed 57 hours spent hiding from the Viet-Minh, before a three day march without food or navigational aids before encountering native tribesmen who provided food and a [[pony]], with which he reached the French forces.<ref name="street without joy"/>

==Legacy==

The French High Command released an assessment of the defeat at Muong Khoua in ''Communique No. 14'' stating "During the night of May 17 to 18, the post of Muong-Khoua, which had victoriously resisted since the beginning of the Viet-Minh offensive, succumbed under the overwhelming mass of assailants."<ref name="street without joy"/> The Vietnamese and French media, however, had awarded considerable attention to the conflict, and newspapers world-wide had covered the battle.<ref name="street without joy"/> [[Bernard Fall]] made note of the significance of the battle as "epic" in both his 1961 ''Street Without Joy'' and the 1967 ''Hell in a Very Small Place''.<ref name="street without joy"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Fall|first=Bernard B.|title=Hell in a Very Small Place|publisher=Lippincott|date=1967|pages=73|isbn=030681157X}}</ref>

The [[United Kingdom|British]] ''[[The Times]]'' began covering the conflict on April 23, reporting the retreat from Sop Nao to Muong Khoua, however despite correctly identifying half of the Viet-Minh attacking force, it rated the garrison at the mother-strong point as numbering 1,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hillmen Become Irregulars|date=April 23, 1953|work=The Times|pages=8; Issue 52603; col A |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> It received scant attention during the siege,<ref name="relatively small">{{cite news|title=Outpost Overrun By Viet-Minh|date=May 5, 1953|work=The Times|pages=5; Issue 52613; col C |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> before the garrison fell &ndash; whereupon coverage remained positive at the thought of French survivors, and speculative on the future of the French military prescence and the new commander, [[Henri Navarre]].<ref name="fall newspaper">{{cite news|title=More Viet-Minh Attacks In Indo-China|date=May 21, 1953|work=The Times|pages=8; Issue 52627; col A |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> The area of Muong Khoua later became a critical supply route across Dien Bien Phu for the Viet-Minh, and by 1963 was the site of a construction project for the proposed Route 19.<ref name="langland">{{cite journal|last=Langland|first=Stanley G.|title=The Laos Factor in the Vietnam Equation|journal=International Affairs|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|volume=Volume 45|issue=No. 4|pages=638-640}}</ref>
