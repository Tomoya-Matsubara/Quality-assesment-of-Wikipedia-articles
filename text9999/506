[[Silviculture]], a related science, involves the growing and tending of [[tree]]s and forests. Modern forestry generally embraces a broad range of concerns, including assisting forests to provide [[timber]] as [[raw material]] for [[wood]] products, [[wildlife habitat]], natural [[Water resources|water quality management]], [[recreation]], landscape and community protection, employment, aesthetically appealing [[landscape]]s, [[biodiversity]] management, [[watershed management]], [[erosion control]], and preserving forests as '[[Carbon dioxide sink|sink]]s' for [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]].  A practitioner of forestry is known as a [[forester]]. The word "forestry" can also refer to a forest itself.

Forest [[ecosystems]] have come to be seen as the most important component of the [[biosphere]],<ref>http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biology/biology-iv/ecosystem/ecosystem-definition.php ecosystem part of biosphere</ref> and forestry has emerged as a vital field of science, [[applied art]], and [[technology]].

==History==
{{See also|Outline of forestry#History of forestry}}

In the 5th century monks established a plantation of [[Stone pine]], for use as a source of fuel and food, in the then Byzantine [[Romagna]] on the [[Adriatic]] coast.<ref name="Pines">{{cite book|last1=T. Mirov|first1=Nicholas|last2=Hasbrouck|first2=Jean|title=The story of pines|year=1976|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington and London|isbn=0-253-35462-5|page=111|chapter=6}}</ref> This was the beginning of the massive forest mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri]] in his 1308 poem [[Divine Comedy]].<ref name="Pines"/>
Formal forestry practices were developed by the [[Visigoths]] in the 7th century when, faced with the ever increasing shortage of wood, they instituted a code concerned with the preservation of [[oak]] and [[pine]] forests.<ref name="Pines"/> The use and management of many forest resources has a long history in [[China]], dating from the [[Han Dynasty]] and taking place under the landowning [[gentry]]. It was also later written of by the [[Ming Dynasty]] Chinese scholar [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562<U+2013>1633). In [[Europe]], control of the land included hunting rights, and though peasants in many places were permitted to gather firewood and building timber and to graze animals, hunting rights were retained by the members of the nobility. Systematic management of forests for a sustainable yield of timber is said to have begun in the 16th century in both the [[Germany|German]] states{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and [[Japan]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = Forestry in Yashino | work =  | publisher = City of [[Nara, Nara]] | date =  | url = http://www.pref.nara.jp/nara/kaido/eg/syugen/d5_trad/trad1.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}</ref> Typically, a forest was divided into specific sections and mapped; the harvest of timber was planned with an eye to regeneration.

[[Image:TJ harvesteri.jpg|thumb|right|[[Logging|Timber harvesting]] is a common component of forestry]]

The practice of establishing tree plantations in the [[British Isles]] was promoted by [[John Evelyn]], though it had already acquired some popularity. [[Louis XIV]]'s minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]'s oak [[Forest of Tron<U+00E7>ais]], planted for the future use of the [[French Navy]], matured as expected in the mid-19th century: "Colbert had thought of everything except the steamship," [[Fernand Braudel]] observed.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Braudel | first = Fernand | title = The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism: 15th-18th Century (Volume II) | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1979 | location =  | pages = 240 | isbn = 978-0-520-08115-4}}</ref> Schools of forestry were established beginning in the late 18th century in [[Hesse]], [[Russia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Sweden]], [[France]] and elsewhere in Europe. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, forest preservation programs were established in British India, the United States, and Europe. Many foresters were either from continental Europe (like [[Dietrich Brandis|Sir Dietrich Brandis]]), or educated there (like [[Gifford Pinchot]]).

The enactment and evolution of forestry laws and binding regulations occurred in most Western nations in the 20th century in response to growing conservation concerns and the increasing technological capacity of [[logging]] companies.

Tropical forestry is a separate branch of forestry which deals mainly with equatorial forests that yield woods such as [[teak]] and [[mahogany]]. [[Dietrich Brandis|Sir Dietrich Brandis]] is considered the father of tropical forestry.

==As a science==
Over the past centuries, forestry was regarded as a separate science. With the rise of [[ecology]] and [[environmental science]], there has been a reordering in the applied sciences. In line with this view, forestry is one of three primary land-use sciences. The other two are [[agriculture]] and [[agroforestry]].<ref>Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2002) Agroecological Perspectives in Agronomy, Forestry and Agroforestry. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH, 356p.</ref> Under these headings, the fundamentals behind the management of natural forests comes by way of natural ecology. Forests or tree plantations, those whose primary purpose is the extraction of forest products, are planned and managed utilizing a mix of ecological and agroecological principles.<ref>Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2006) Undoing the Damage: Silviculture for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH, 313p.</ref>

== Today ==
[[Image:Laser guided cutting of wood inside modern woodmill.jpg|thumb|right|A modern [[sawmill]] ]]

Today a strong body of [[research]] exists regarding the management of [[Forest ecology|forest ecosystems]] and genetic improvement of [[Tree breeding|tree species and varieties]]. Forestry also includes the development of better methods for the planting, protecting, [[thinning]], [[controlled burn]]ing, [[felling]], extracting, and processing of [[timber]]. One of the applications of modern forestry is [[reforestation]], in which trees are planted and tended in a given area.

In many regions the forest industry is of major ecological, economic, and social importance. Third-party [[certification]] systems that provide independent verification of sound forest [[stewardship]] and [[Sustainable forest management|sustainable forestry]] have become commonplace in many areas since the 1990s. These certification systems were developed as a response to criticism of some forestry practices, particularly deforestation in less developed regions along with concerns over resource management in the [[developed world]]. Some certification systems are criticised for primarily acting as marketing tools and lacking in their claimed independence.

In topographically severe forested terrain, proper forestry is important for the prevention or minimization of serious soil [[erosion]] or even [[landslide]]s. In areas with a high potential for landslides, forests can [[Erosion control|stabilize soils]] and prevent property damage or loss, human injury, or loss of life.

Public perception of [[forest management]] has become controversial, with growing public concern over perceived mismanagement of the forest and increasing demands that forest land be managed for uses other than pure timber production, for example, indigenous rights, [[Outdoor recreation|recreation]], [[watershed management]], and preservation of [[wilderness]], [[waterways]] and [[Habitat|wildlife habitat]]. Sharp disagreements over the role of [[forest fires]], [[logging]], [[motorized recreation]] and other issues drives debate while the public demand for [[wood products]] continues to increase.

== Foresters ==
{{Main|Forester}}
[[image:Sanpablotregua.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Foresters of [[Southern University of Chile|UACh]] in the [[Valdivian forest]]s of San Pablo de Tregua, Chile]]
Foresters work for the timber industry, government agencies, conservation groups, local authorities, [[urban area|urban]] parks boards, citizens' associations, and private landowners. The forestry profession includes a wide diversity of jobs, with educational requirements ranging from college bachelor's degrees to PhDs for highly specialized work. Industrial foresters plan forest regeneration starting with careful harvesting. Urban foresters manage trees in urban green spaces. Foresters work in [[plant nursery|tree nurseries]] growing [[seedling]]s for woodland creation or regeneration projects. Foresters improve tree [[genetics]]. Forest engineers develop new building systems.
Professional foresters [[timber cruise|measure]] and [[Growth and yield modelling|model]] the growth of forests with tools like [[GIS|geographic information systems]]. Foresters may combat [[insect]] infestation, disease, forest and [[grassland]] [[wildfire]], but increasingly allow these natural aspects of forest [[ecosystem]]s to run their course when the likelihood of [[epidemic]]s or risk of life or property are low. Increasingly, foresters participate in wildlife [[Conservation movement|conservation]] planning and [[Drainage basin|watershed]] protection. Foresters have been mainly concerned with timber management, especially reforestation, maintaining forests at prime conditions, and fire control.<ref>"forestry." The Columbia Encyclopedia.

== Forestry plans ==
Foresters develop and implement forest management plans relying on mapped resource [[Forest inventory|inventories]] showing an area's [[Topography|topographical]] features as well as its distribution of trees (by species) and other plant cover. Plans also include landowner objectives, roads, [[culvert]]s, proximity to human habitation, water features and hydrological conditions, and soils information. Forest management plans typically include recommended silvicultural treatments and a timetable for their implementation.

Forest management plans include recommendations to achieve the landowner's objectives and desired future condition for the property subject to ecological, financial, logistical (e.g. access to resources), and other constraints.  On some properties, plans focus on producing quality wood products for processing or sale. Hence, tree species, quantity, and form, all central to the value of harvested products quality and quantity, tend to be important components of silvicultural plans.

Good management plans include consideration of future conditions of the stand after any recommended harvests treatments, including future treatments (particularly in intermediate stand treatments, and plans for natural or artificial regeneration after final harvests.

The objectives of landowners and [[leaseholders|leaseholder]] influence plans for harvest and subsequent site treatment. In Britain, plans featuring "good forestry practice" must always consider the needs of other stakeholders such as nearby communities or rural residents living within or adjacent to woodland areas. Foresters consider tree felling and environmental legislation when developing plans. Plans instruct the sustainable harvesting and replacement of trees. They indicate whether road building or other forest engineering operations are required.

[[Agriculture]] and forest leaders are also trying to understand how the [[climate]] change legislation will affect what they do. The information gathered will provide the data that will determine the role of agriculture and forestry in a new climate change regulatory system.<ref>"Study Targets Climate Change Impact on Agriculture, Forestry."

== Education ==

===History of forestry education===

{{See also|List of historic schools of forestry}}

The first dedicated forestry school was established by [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]] at [[Hungen]] in the [[Wetterau]], [[Hesse]], in 1787, though forestry had been taught earlier in central Europe, including at the [[University of Giessen]], in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]].

In Spain, the first forestry school was the Forest Engineering School of Madrid ([[Escuela T<U+00E9>cnica Superior de Ingenieros de Montes]]), founded in 1844. 

The first in [[North America]], the [[Biltmore Forest School]] was established near [[Asheville]], North Carolina, by [[Carl A. Schenck]] on September 1, 1898, on the grounds of [[George Washington Vanderbilt II|George W. Vanderbilt's]] [[Biltmore Estate]]. Another early school was the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]], established at [[Cornell University]] just a few weeks later, in September 1898. Early 19th century North American foresters went to Germany to study forestry. Some early German foresters also emigrated to North America.

In [[South America]] the first forestry school was established in Brazil, in [[Vi<U+00E7>osa]], [[Minas Gerais]], in 1962, and moved the next year to become a faculty at the [[Federal University of Paran<U+00E1>]], in Curitiba.<ref>{{Cite journal | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = News of the world | journal = Unasylva | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages =  |publisher = [[FAO]] | location = | year = 1969 | url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/93269e/93269e0a.htm | issn =  | doi = | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}</ref>

===Forestry education today===

{{See also|List of forestry universities and colleges|List of forestry technical schools}}

[[Image:Burn9582.JPG|thumb|right|[[Prescribed burning]] is used by foresters to reduce fuel loads]]

Today, forestry education typically includes training in general [[biology]], [[botany]], [[genetics]], [[soil science]], [[climatology]], [[hydrology]], [[economics]] and [[forest management]]. Education in the basics of [[sociology]] and [[political science]] is often considered an advantage.

In India, forestry education is imparted in the [[List of agricultural universities and colleges#India|agricultural universities]] and in Forest Research Institutes (deemed universities). Four year degree programmes are conducted in these universities at the undergraduate level. Masters and Doctorate degrees are also available in these universities.

In the [[United States]], [[Higher education|postsecondary]] forestry education leading to a [[Bachelor's degree]] or [[Master's degree]] is accredited by the [[Society of American Foresters]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=SAF Accredited and Candidate Forestry Degree Programs |publisher=Society of American Foresters |date=2008-05-19 |url=http://www.safnet.org/education/forestry_degree_programs.pdf |format=PDF |language= |accessdate= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=The Society of American Foresters grants accreditation only to specific educational curricula that lead to a first professional degree in forestry at the bachelor's or master's level.}}</ref>

In [[Canada]] the Canadian Institute of Forestry awards silver rings to graduates from accredited university BSc programs,  as well as college and technical programs.<ref>http://www.cif-ifc.org/site/silver_ring_program</ref>

In many European countries, training in forestry is made in accordance with requirements of the [[Bologna Process]] and the [[European Higher Education Area]].

The [[International Union of Forest Research Organizations]] is the only international organization that coordinates forest science efforts world-wide.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Discover IUFRO:The Organization | work =  | publisher = IUFRO | date =  | url = http://www.iufro.org/discover/organization/ | format =  | doi = | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}</ref> Organizations such as the [[Forest Policy Education Network]] are dedicated to facilitating international forest politics and exchanging information on the subject.
