[[Nine Inch Nails]], an [[industrial rock]] band [[frontman|fronted]] by [[Trent Reznor]], has performed throughout the world, including tours in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, Japan, and China. While Reznor controls the creative and musical direction of Nine Inch Nails in-studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs in live settings. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as [[Woodstock '94]], [[Lollapalooza]] 1991 and 2008, as well as many other one-off performances including the [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist [[Alessandro Cortini]] said that "if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity".<ref name="Wigney">{{cite web

The only constant member of the live band is Reznor, who cites the long periods of time between major tours as one reason for the ever-changing live lineup.  Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with [[Rob Sheridan]]. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries.

Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease touring with the band after a 2009 farewell tour.

Reznor assembled the first live line-up in 1988 to support the Canadian [[industrial music]] band [[Skinny Puppy]] on tour. The three-piece band consisted of Reznor on guitars and lead vocals, Ron Musarra on drums, and [[Chris Vrenna]] on keyboards. The band was poorly received, however, and they were asked to leave the tour after 10 dates.<ref name="Getting Down in It" /> After the Skinny Puppy tour the band was rearranged and expanded to include a fourth member; Vrenna was moved to drums, Nick Rushe and later David Hymes contributed on keyboards, while [[Richard Patrick]] was added as guitarist.

After the 1994 release of ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'', the live band embarked on the Self-Destruct tour in support of the album.  Vrenna and Woolley returned on drums and keyboards respectively. [[Robin Finck]] replaced Patrick on guitar, while bassist [[Danny Lohner]] was added to the line-up.

The main leg of the tour featured [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] as the supporting act, who Reznor had recently signed to his [[Nothing Records]] label. At the time, Marilyn Manson featured bassist [[Jeordie White]] (then playing under the pseudonym "Twiggy Ramirez"), who would later play bass with Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007.  After another tour leg supporting the remix album ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', Nine Inch Nails contributed to the [[Alternative Nation Festival]] in Australia.

Nine Inch Nails were scheduled to perform at the 2005 [[MTV Movie Awards]], but dropped themselves from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of [[George W. Bush]] as a backdrop to the band's performance of "[[The Hand that Feeds]]". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on the official Nine Inch Nails website: "apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me".<ref name = "E! Online">{{cite web

In April 2007, Nine Inch Nails fans received in-game telephone-calls in which they were invited to a "resistance meeting" in Los Angeles.  At the meeting, fans attended a fictional [[Characters and organizations in the Year Zero alternate reality game|Art is Resistance]] meeting, and were later rewarded by an unannounced performance by Nine Inch Nails.

Later that year, the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' reported that the September 18 show in [[Honolulu]] would be the last performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Reznor told the newspaper "at this point, I want to switch things around a bit.  Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again.

On July 26, Trent Reznor introduced an "unplugged" portion into the live show in which the band steps to the front of the stage about an hour into the show, with Reznor on vibraphone and bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen playing an upright bass. The 20-minute jazzy, acoustic set is taken mostly from ''Ghosts I - IV''.  The stage show also featured mesh LED curtains that projected various visuals, ranging from falling rain to static to a ruined city, and made the band appear to be playing on "a stage that appeared to be constructed entirely out of lights."<ref>http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=101899</ref> [[Nine Inch Nails]] later confirmed that the tour was to extend to South America  and it was thought this would be the last [[Americas]] set of dates but soon after Reznor announced yet more North American dates including two dates in tourist capital [[Florida]].

On October 8, 2008, after finishing up their last show in South America, Trent Reznor posted on the official Nine Inch Nails website blog that Josh Freese would be leaving the band following the completion of the current tour.<ref>http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=106557</ref> Shortly after, it was announced that Alessandro Cortini would also be leaving the band. On November 15, 2008, Reznor announced via the official Nine Inch Nails website that [[Ilan Rubin]] of [[Lostprophets]] would be replacing Josh Freese after his departure at the end of 2008. No replacement was announced for Cortini, and the band subsequently toured as a 4-piece without a full time keyboard player.

In 2008, Reznor decided to put Nine Inch Nails on indefinite hiatus. He later clarified that "NIN as a touring live band or live band that's on the road all the time [would be] stopping" after a comprehensive tour, but that he would continue to produce music thereafter.<ref>http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090713-215297/Trent-Reznor-20-years-later</ref>

After a set of shows in Australia and New Zealand, NIN embarked on a North American tour of amphitheatres with [[Jane's Addiction]] and [[Street Sweeper Social Club]] dubbed "NIN/JA 2009". Concerts in Europe and Asia were also announced before Reznor added a series of smaller-venue shows in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The final show was on September 10th, 2009.

==Visual elements==
Visual elements employed during Nine Inch Nails concerts have often included numerous lighting, stage and projection effects employed to accompany and augment presentation.<ref name="unogateway">{{cite news

I want it to be drama. I want my rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The [[Kurt Cobain]]s of the world, I<U+2019>m sick of that shit. I don<U+2019>t want a gas station attendant being my hero. I grew up with [[Gene Simmons]]. I grew up with [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]."<ref name="bleak" />

Many songs are typically accompanied with specially designed visual aids, including synchronized lighting effects and projected stock-footage montages.  Early performances of the song "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]", for example, were accompanied by a projected montage of clouds, charred bodies, mushroom clouds, maggots, and war refugees,<ref name="Fort Worth Star">{{cite journal

Since 1999, the visual presentation of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been directed by [[Rob Sheridan]], while Bill Viola designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour.<ref name="Gergiev" />  The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery.  ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.<ref>{{cite news

For the Live: With Teeth tour, Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design respectively.<ref name="WT lighting">{{cite journal

  | publisher = ''Projection, Lights and Staging News''
  | first = Steve 
  | last = Jennings 
  | date = 2005-12-08}}</ref>  Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that much of the lighting was done using a series of [[Light-emitting diode|LED lights]] arranged in "stalactites or stalagmites [formations] to tie in to the album artwork".  [[DLP]] projectors were also used to project images onto a gauze screen in front of the stage.  

[[Image:Nine Inch Nails Moline 08.jpg|thumb|right|A Nine Inch Nails performance during the Live: With Teeth tour featuring the "teeth" lighting fixtures]]
Using the gauze projection-screen, Phillips, Reznor, and Sheridan devised a "gag" where they projected "a sheet of glass shattering onto a downstage kabuki scrim that would drop as the glass shatters fell. ... We settled on Trent swinging his guitar at the gauze [and] shattering it, but with all the pieces falling up as the [screen] flew out".<ref name="WT lighting" />  This technique can be seen in the tour documentary ''Beside You in Time''.  In contrast to the lighting of previous tours, Performance 2007 featured minimal lighting that was designed to shadow Reznor and the band.<ref>{{cite news

==Live band members==
{{main|List of Nine Inch Nails live-band members}}
The configuration of the band has evolved since first touring in 1988. Early incarnations of the band had three people playing [[guitar]]s, [[drum kit|drums]], [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]]s, and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]].  Later incarnations replaced the keyboards and samplers with an additional guitarist, and incarnations after that added a multi-instrumentalist whose main role was as a [[bass guitar|bassist]] but also played [[electric guitar|guitars]] and [[Musical keyboard|keyboards]] on a number of songs. Finally, the live component of Nine Inch Nails has settled as a five-piece band since the ''Self Destruct'' tour from 1994. On the Performance 2007 tour, some songs from the ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' album were performed as a 3 piece band, featuring Reznor, keyboard player Alessandro Cortini and guitarist Aaron North, using a combination of live guitars and triggered loops.<ref>{{cite web

  | publisher = Trent Reznor via Bebo
  | date = Unknown
  | accessdate = 2009-05-30}}</ref> In September 2007, Reznor expressed his interest in moving away from the "rock band configuration" to explore "other ways [to] present the material in concert",<ref name="break-up" /> though once again the 2008 incarnation consisted of five positions, but adding a variety of instruments not normally used in Nine Inch Nails such as [[double bass]], various [[Percussion|percussion instruments]], [[steel guitar]], [[vibraphone]] and other acoustic instruments as well as sampled sounds triggered from a variety of electronic instruments. No replacement was hired for keyboard player Alessandro Cortini after he left the band in late 2008, and the 2009 live band is a four-piece, with the role of keyboard player being shared between all members.

Describing the selection process, early contributor [[Chris Vrenna]] told ''[[Gannett News]]'' "coming from the same emotional background, I feel, is more important than how well you can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger".<ref>{{cite journal

So I took some young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it.  The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' "<ref name="Thrasher 1990">{{cite journal
