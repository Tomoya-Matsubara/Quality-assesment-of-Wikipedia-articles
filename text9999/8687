<!-- ==Murder Trilogy==
Two of the songs on the album ("Jenny Was a Friend of Mine" and "Midnight Show") are a continuing story along with "Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf" from ''[[Sawdust (album)|Sawdust]]'', which is known as the Murder Trilogy. The band have also said they may expand this in the future.

The order of the songs is the reverse of how they appeared on the albums, with "Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf" being first, followed by "Midnight Show" and finally "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine".

In their official biography <ref>[http://www.universalmusicpublishing.com/spotlight.aspx?ID=2127 The Songs of The Killers</ref> the Killers explain a few of the theories behind the Murder Trilogy. For example Brandon Flowers says "There was water involved, although he didn<U+2019>t drown her."

The line in "Jenny Was A Friend of Mine" "she couldn't scream while I held her close/ I swore I'd never let her go" is thought {{fact|August 2008}} to mean that he suffocated her against his chest. The track begins with sirens, and helicopter noises, and several lines ("I know my rights..." "there aint no motive for this crime") imply that the police are involved, and perhaps questioning him.

"Oh crashing time can't hide a guilty girl/ With jealous hearts that start with blossom curls/ I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier"
This line from "Midnight Show" seems {{fact|August 2008}} to tell us more about the murder. "crashing time" seems {{fact|August 2008}} to allude to the ocean, so perhaps her body was thrown into the ocean. The phrase "jealous hearts" coincides with the jealous theme of "Leave The Bourbon On The Shelf" which could point {{fact|August 2008}} to jealousy as a motive for the crime. "I took my baby's breath" could {{fact|August 2008}} definitely mean death by suffocation, which works well with the lines from "Jenny".
