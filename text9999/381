'''Harold Warren Moon''' (born [[November 18]], [[1956 in sports|1956]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]) is a former [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]] [[quarterback]] who played for the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Edmonton Eskimos]] and the [[National Football League]]'s [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]].

He is the only player ever to be enshrined by both the  [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] and [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]].  [[Bud Grant]] is also enshrined in both, but as a coach. Moon was also the first, and currently only, modern African-American quarterback elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Moon held the record for most passing yardage in professional football until surpassed by [[Damon Allen]] on [[September 4]], [[2006]].

==Biography==
===College years===
Moon attended [[Alexander Hamilton High School (Los Angeles)|Hamilton High School]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. He was recruited by a number of colleges, but some, like [[UCLA]], wanted to convert Moon to another position as was the norm for many major colleges recruiting [[African American|black]] high school quarterbacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nflhs.com/News/PlayersSpotlight/MoonMinute_11092001_sim.asp|title=Moon's Minute: My Recruitment Experience|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> Moon decided to attend [[West Los Angeles College]] in 1974-75 where he was a record-setting quarterback. After Moon showed his ability at West L.A., the [[University of Washington]] was one of the few four-year colleges that was willing to sign the rifle-armed Moon, who was adamant that he play quarterback, considering himself to be perhaps a slightly above-average athlete who was either too small, too slow, or not strong enough to play other positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nflcflfutures.com/NFLCFLFuturesNews03/0911.html|title=How Warren Moon Improved His Athleticism In High School|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> The Huskies went 11-11 in Moon's first 2 seasons as a starter; but during his senior year, Moon led the Huskies to a 27-20 win over the favored [[Michigan Wolverines|University of Michigan Wolverines]] in the [[1978 in sports|1978]] [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] and was named the game's [[Most Valuable Player]] on the strength of two short [[touchdown]] runs and a third quarter 28-yard touchdown pass to [[wide receiver]] Robert "Spider" Gaines.

===CFL career===
Despite his collegiate success, Warren Moon went undrafted in the National Football League.  Many pundits believe that it was because Moon was black and refused to switch positions - Moon has stated in interviews that before the draft some scouts advised him to switch to tight end.  With no takers in the NFL, his only alternative was the [[Canadian Football League]].  Moon signed with the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], where he and [[Tom Wilkinson (football player)|Tom Wilkinson]] shared signal-calling duties and helped lead the Eskimos to an unprecedented five consecutive [[Grey Cup]] victories in [[66th Grey Cup|1978]], [[67th Grey Cup|1979]], [[68th Grey Cup|1980]], [[69th Grey Cup|1981]] and [[70th Grey Cup|1982]].<ref name=CFL>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=62|title=CFL Legends >> Warren Moon|accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> Of note is that in the 1981 Grey Cup, the quarterback of the opposing team was [[J.C. Watts]]. Moon won the offensive [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player]] award in the 1980 and 1982 games.  In his final CFL season of [[1983 CFL season|1983]], Moon threw for a league record 5,648 yards, and won the [[CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award]]. Throughout his CFL career, Moon amassed 1,369 completions on 2,382 attempts (57.4 completion percentage) for 21,228 yards and 144 touchdown passes.  He also led his team to victory in 9 of 10 postseason games.  He was inducted into the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] in [[2001 in sports|2001]] and the Edmonton Eskimos [[Edmonton Eskimos#Wall of Honour|Wall of Honour]]. In 2006, he was #5 on a list of the [[TSN Top 50 CFL Players|greatest 50 CFL players]] presented by Canadian sports network [[The Sports Network|TSN]].

===NFL career===
Moon's decision to enter the NFL touched off a bidding war for his services, won by the [[Houston Oilers]]. However, with the NFL field being so much shorter and narrower than the CFL's, Moon had a difficult adjustment period.  Even so, he still threw for a franchise record 3,338 yards in his first season with Oilers in 1984.  It was only in [[1986 in sports|1986]] when Oilers head coach [[Jerry Glanville]] found ways to best utilize Moon's strong arm that he began having success.  In [[1987 in sports|1987]], a season shortened by a players' strike that eliminated the third week of the regular NFL season, the Oilers posted a 9-6 record.  It was the Oilers' first winning season since [[1980 in sports|1980]], when [[Bum Phillips]] was the head coach and [[Ken Stabler|Ken "The Snake" Stabler]] was the quarterback.  Moon then passed for 237 yards and a touchdown while leading the Oilers to a 23-20 overtime win over the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in the wildcard round of the playoffs in his first NFL postseason game.

Before the start of the 1989 season, Moon was given a 5 year, $10 million contract extension, which made him the highest paid player in the National Football League at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D6113AF93BA35757C0A96F948260|title=Moon Says New Pact Is Richest in N.F.L.|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> In 1990, Moon led the league with 4,689 passing yards. He also led the league in attempts (584), completions (362), and touchdowns (33), and tied [[Dan Marino]]'s record with nine 300-yard games in a season. The following year, he again led the league in passing yards 4,690. At the same time, he joined Marino and [[Dan Fouts]] as the only quarterbacks to post back-to-back 4,000-yard seasons. Moon also established new NFL records that season with 655 attempts and 404 completions. In 1991, Moon threw for a career-high 655 passes.

In 1992, Moon played only 11 games due to injuries, but still managed to lead the Oilers to a 10-6 record, including a victory over the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the final game of the season.  Moon and the Oilers then faced the Bills again in the first round of the AFC playoffs.  Aided by Moon's 222 passing yards and 4 touchdowns in the first half, Houston built up a 28-3 halftime lead, and then increased it to 35-3 when Buffalo quarterback [[Frank Reich]]'s first pass of the third quarter was intercepted and returned for a touchdown.  But the Bills managed to storm back with 5 unanswered second half touchdowns to take a 35-38 lead with time running out in the final period.  Moon managed to lead the Oilers on a last second field goal drive to send the game into overtime, but threw an interception in the extra period that set-up Buffalo kicker [[Steve Christie]]'s game winning field goal.  It was the largest comeback victory in NFL history and is now known in [[NFL Lore]] simply as [[The Comeback (American football)|The Comeback]].  Moon finished the game with 36 completions for 371 yards and 4 touchdowns, with 2 interceptions.

[[1993 in sports|1993]] was the Houston Oilers' best season with Warren Moon under center &mdash; and it would also be his last season with the team. The Oilers went 12-4 and won the old [[AFC Central|AFC Central division]] crown, but lost to [[Joe Montana]] and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] 28-20 in the divisional round of the playoffs.  

As a Houston Oiler, Moon set a franchise record for wins with 70, which stood until [[Steve McNair]] broke it in 2004, long after the team had become the [[Tennessee Titans]].

He was traded to the Minnesota Vikings after the season, where he passed for over 4,200 yards in each of his first two seasons, but missed half of the [[1996 in sports|1996]] season with a broken [[collarbone]]. After the season he signed with the [[Seattle Seahawks]] as a free agent. The Vikings' starting quarterback job was given to [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] after Moon refused to take a $3.8 million pay cut to serve as Johnson's backup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EEDD103EF931A15751C0A961958260&sec=&spon=|title=Vikings Release Moon|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> After a two year stint in the [[Pacific northwest]], an aging Moon signed as a free agent with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] as a backup in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E3D9153DF934A15757C0A96F958260&sec=&spon=|title=Moon Joins Chiefs|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> He played in only three games in 2 years with the Chiefs before announcing his retirement in January 2001.

Combining his NFL and CFL stats, Moon's numbers are staggering:  5,357 completions for 70,553 yards and 435 touchdowns, total yards being massively higher than the NFL record ([[Brett Favre]] is in reach of the other 2 categories).  Even if his Canadian League statistics are discounted, Warren Moon's career is still exceptional: 3,988 completions for 49,325 yards (the fourth-highest in NFL history), 291 touchdown passes, 1,736 yards rushing, and 22 rushing touchdowns.

During his NFL career, Warren Moon was named to nine [[Pro Bowl]] games (1988-1995, 1997).  Moon currently works as a broadcaster for the Seattle Seahawks.  He was elected into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2006, becoming both the first [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]]r, first undrafted quarterback and the first African-American quarterback to be so honored.  Moon was elected in his first year of eligibility.  The [[Tennessee Titans]] retired his number at halftime on [[October 1]] vs the [[Dallas Cowboys]], and on [[October 29]] the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] also retired his jersey.

== Personal life ==
Moon married the former Felicia Fontenot Hendricks on [[March 8]], [[1981]]. Felicia's and Warren's daughter, Blair, was a member of [[Tulane]]'s Women's [[Volleyball]] team. Following his retirement, Moon has become a well-known fantasy football fan. He and fellow QB [[Erik Kramer]] host a fantasy football sports show, "Ultimate Fantasy Football", during the season on Fox Sports Net. Moon serves as a [[color commentator]] on the Seahawks' radio broadcasts, and has also provided commentary on preseason TV broadcasts for the Seahawks and Titans.
