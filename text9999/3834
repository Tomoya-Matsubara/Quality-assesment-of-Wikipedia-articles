[[Major General]] '''Louis James Lipsett''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (14 June 1874 &ndash; 14 October 1918), was a senior officer in the [[British Army]] and [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. He commanded the [[3rd Canadian Division]] during some of the bitterest battles of the war, taking over in 1915 after his predecessor was killed. He himself was killed in action less than a month before the end of the war during a reconnaissance mission observing German positions along the [[River Selle]].

A highly experienced officer, Lipsett had previously seen action in the [[Tirah Campaign]] and the [[Second Boer War]] with the British Army, serving as an officer with the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684-1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]]. He was later instrumental in developing military training and education throughout Canada and expanding the shore defences of [[British Columbia]] in response to the threat of the German East Asian Cruiser Squadron under [[Maximilian von Spee|von Spee]]. An experienced and capable officer, Lipsett was popular with both his men and his superiors and his death was considered "a deplorable loss to the Division".<ref name="DCB"/>

==Early military career==
Born in [[Ballyshannon]], [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]], to Richard and Etty Lipsett in June 1874, Lipsett was raised in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Wales]], and [[Bedford]], [[England]], following his father's death in 1887. He was educated at [[Bedford Grammar School]] and took the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] entrance examination against the wishes of his tutors, entering the college and graduating 35th from his class of 120. In 1894, Lipsett was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684-1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]],<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=26559|startpage=5688|date=9 October 1894|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> and took ship to [[British India|India]] where he served for the next five years on the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901<U+2013>1955)|Northwest Frontier]], participating in the [[Tirah Campaign]] against the [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi]].<ref name="FFW.com"/> During these campaigns he conducted himself with distinction, being promoted to [[lieutenant]] but also contracting a near-fatal bout of [[cholera]].<ref name="DCB"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=26885|startpage=4726|date=24 August 1897|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

In 1899 he and his regiment were ordered to South Africa for service in the [[Second Boer War]]. Although he did not serve in any significant actions Lipsett performed his duties well, in 1901 was promoted to [[captain (OF-2)|captain]] and on his return to England in 1903 was recommended to the [[Staff College, Camberley]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=27305|startpage=2620|date=16 April 1901|accessdate=2007-12-20}}<br/>{{LondonGazette|issue=27526|startpage=1132|date=20 February 1903|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref><ref name="BRT1"/> In 1905 he returned to South Africa as a staff officer ([[Adjutant general|Deputy-Assistant Adjutant]] and [[Quartermaster-General]]),<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=27778|startpage=2276|date=24 March 1905|accessdate=2007-12-20}}<br/>{{LondonGazette|issue=27856|startpage=7823|date=21 November 1905|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> to aid in the reconstitution of colonial government, a task he performed until 1907, when he was posted back to his regiment.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=28127|startpage=2756|date=10 April 1908|accessdate=2007-12-20}}<br/>{{LondonGazette|issue=28012|startpage=2505|date=12 April 1907|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> Based at [[Aldershot]], Lipsett conducted both regimental business and operated as an aide-de-camp to the commander of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], [[Theodore Stephenson|Theodore Edward Stephenson]].<ref name="DCB"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=28002|startpage=1740|date=8 March 1907|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

In 1911, Lipsett responded to the call from the Colonial Office for young staff officers to operate in colonial military academies, as military education had been standardised throughout the [[British Empire]] in 1909.<ref name="FFW.com"/> Lipsett was sent to Canada and promoted to [[Major (UK)|major]] (in 1913), working hard to improve training in the Dominion.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=28524|startpage=6225|date=22 August 1911|accessdate=2007-12-20}}<br/>{{LondonGazette|issue=28782|startpage=9255|date=16 December 1913|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> He instigated numerous new training courses and special schools, establishing close ties with the Canadian military establishment and personally training most of the next generation of Canadian staff officers and generals.<ref name="DCB"/>

==First World War==
At the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] Lipsett was dispatched to [[British Columbia]], the Pacific coastline of which was largely undefended and was believed to be at risk from the German East Asian Cruiser Squadron under [[Maximilian von Spee]], which had embarked on a raiding campaign in the [[Pacific Ocean]] that would culminate in the [[Battle of Coronel]] and the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. Lipsett recognised that there was no immediate threat to the Canadian coast and calmed fears whilst simultaneously organising the local militia forces and deploying the two submarines purchased by provincial Premier [[Richard McBride]].<ref name="DCB"/> His task completed in British Columbia, Lipsett took over command and training of the [[8th Battalion, CEF|8th Battalion]] of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]].<ref name="BRT1"/> A friend recalled that as a commanding officer he was "always accessible and charming in manner, yet there was that about him which made him respected and no one ever presumed on his kindness, except the few old soldiers, who with their war ribbons up, and uncanny intuition, never failed to touch a soft spot in his heart."<ref name="DCB"/>

In 1915 the 8th Battalion joined the [[British Army]] in France as part of the [[3rd Canadian Division]]. At the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] his troops faced the brunt of the German assault, involving the first use of [[poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] in modern warfare.<ref name="DCB"/> Lipsett is credited with issuing the first order to counteract the effects of poison gas, when he ordered his men to urinate on strips of cloth and tie them to their faces to neutralise the chlorine. Lipsett's battalion was instrumental in holding the line during the action and he was consequently rewarded by being made a [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]], promoted to acting [[Brigadier (UK)|brigadier-general]] and given command of the [[Canadian 2nd Brigade]], which he trained during the spring of 1916 to conduct major trench raids on German lines.<ref name="LG1">{{LondonGazette|issue=29202|supp=yes|startpage=6113|endpage=6114|date=23 June 1915|accessdate=2007-12-20}}<br/>{{LondonGazette|issue=29364|startpage=11205|date=12 November 1915|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref><ref name="DCB"/>

===2nd Canadian Division===
On 2 June 1916, Lipsett's commanding officer [[Malcolm Mercer]] was killed by enemy shellfire at [[Mount Sorrel]] in [[Belgium]] and Lipsett was given an acting promotion to replace him in command of the [[3rd Canadian Division]],<ref name="BRT2">P.95, ''Bloody Red Tabs'', Davies & Maddocks</ref>  and a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=29608|supp=yes|startpage=5563|endpage=5564|date=2 June 1916|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> The Canadian Minister of Militia and Defence Minister Sir [[Sam Hughes]] attempted to have him removed from the division in favour of Hughes' son Garnet, but Lipsett was so highly regarded in the Canadian military establishment that [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|General Byng]] overruled Hughes.<ref name="DCB"/> Lipsett led his division through the worst of the campaigns in 1916, including extensive operations during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. He received promotion to substantive Lieutenant-Colonel in February 1917,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=30247|supp=yes|startpage=8670|date=21 August 1917|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> and in April 1917 Lipsett's division was instrumental in the Canadian success at the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]]. The following September however the division took heavy casualties in bitter fighting at the [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. After each of these battles, Lipsett was forced to reconstitute and retrain his units with fresh drafts, so severe were the casualties the division took. In August, 1918 he was involved in the planning and execution of an assault on German positions by the entire Canadian Corps which is known as the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] which was completely successful and for which he was made a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]].<ref name="DCB"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=30450|supp=yes|startpage=1|endpage=2|date=28 December 1917|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> Through the rest of the month he was engaged in combat with the division,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=31111|supp=yes|startpage=344|endpage=345|date=3 January 1919|accessdate=2007-12-20}}<br/>{{LondonGazette|issue=31143|startpage=1265||date=24 January 1919|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> but at the start of September [[Arthur Currie]] and [[Douglas Haig]] arranged his transfer to the command of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 4th Division]] in order that the [[Canadian Corps]] be entirely officered by Canadians.<ref name="DCB"/>

===Death===
Although Lipsett was unhappy about the transfer, he acquiesced and took energetic command of the division during the [[Hundred Days Offensive]]. On 14 October 1918, whilst planning an assault at [[Saulzoir]] in France he was crawling along a bank overlooking the [[River Selle]] with several officers of his own staff and some of the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division|49th Division]], when at about 3:15 in the afternoon the party was spotted and a German [[machine gun]] opened fire from across the river. The party went to ground but a single bullet struck Lipsett in the face. He was able to stagger back to his own lines but there collapsed from massive blood loss and never regained consciousness.<ref name="BRT1">P.82-83, ''Bloody Red Tabs'', Davies & Maddocks</ref> He was the last British general to be killed during the First World War. Lipsett was buried the following day in [[Qu<U+00E9>ant Communal Cemetery]]<ref name="CWGC">[http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=316130 Casualty details: Major-General Louis James Lipsett], ''[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]'', Retrieved 27 August 2007</ref> at a funeral attended by dozens of officers from the British and Canadian armies in France. The burial party was provided by the 8th Battalion, C.E.F. and amongst the mourners was the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]].<ref name="BRT1"/> After the war  he was posthumously awarded the Croix d'officier de la [[Legion d'honneur]] and the [[Croix de Guerre]] by the French government.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=31150|supp=yes|startpage=1445|date=29 June 1919|accessdate=2007-11-08}}<br/>{{LondonGazette|issue=31465|supp=yes|startpage=9219|endpage=9221|date=18 July 1919|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref><ref name="FFW.com">[http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/lipsett.htm Who's Who: Louis James Lipsett], ''First World War.com'', Retrieved 26 August 2007</ref> 

Lipsett is remembered in the [[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] as "arguably the best" Canadian officer of the Great War, "a shrewd and thoughtful tactician whose pre-war professional dedication paid off under fire from Ypres to Amiens" and who "set an example of fearlessness and disregard of danger to those under him at all times and in all places; in fact to lead and not to follow was the ideal which he set for himself and lived up to the end."<ref name="DCB">[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=7536 Lipsett, Louis James], ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', Retrieved 26 August 2007</ref>
