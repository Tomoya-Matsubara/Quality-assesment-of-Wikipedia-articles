'''Loyola''' is a [[census-designated place]] and an unincorporated town in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,478 at the 2000 census.  The area is located between the cities of [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]] and [[Los Altos Hills, California|Los Altos Hills]]. While ''Loyola'' is unfamiliar to locals, an adjoining business district in Los Altos is called '''Loyola Corners'''. 

The name comes from a 1904 plan by the [[Jesuit]]s of [[Santa Clara University]] to build a new university named for their founder, St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], in the area. If the plan had come to fruition, the university would have been located in the area of the present-day golf course on Country Club Drive. The Los Altos project succumbed to delays and financing problems stemming from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Blitzer | first = Carol | title = Neighborhoods: Loyola Corners, Los Altos | publisher = Palo Alto Online | url = http://www.paloaltoonline.com/neighborhoods/loyolacorners.php | accessdate = [[2008-10-25]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = McDonald | first = Don  | title = Los Altos History: Loyola Corners | publisher = Los Altos Town Crier | date = [[2007-10-31]] | url = http://www.paloaltoonline.com/neighborhoods/loyolacorners.php | accessdate = [[2008-10-25]]}}</ref>
