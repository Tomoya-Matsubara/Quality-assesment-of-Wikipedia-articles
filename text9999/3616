'''SMS ''Pfeil''''' was an [[aviso]] of the [[Imperial German Navy]], the second and final member of the {{sclass-|Blitz|aviso|4}}. She had one sister ship, {{SMS|Blitz}}. ''Pfeil'' was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] shipyard in [[Wilhelmshaven]] in 1881, launched in September 1882, and commissioned in November 1884. Throughout her career, ''Pfeil'' served in various units in the German fleet and participated in numerous training exercises. In 1889&ndash;90, she was sent to [[German East Africa]] to assist in the suppression of a colonial revolt. In 1894&ndash;99, she was used as a fishery protection ship, and after 1904, she was used as a tender for the battle fleet. She served in this capacity until 1919. ''Pfeil'' was stricken from the [[naval register]] in February 1922 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

''Pfeil'' was {{convert|78.43|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.9|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.07|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|1486|MT}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2-cylinder [[double expansion engine]]s. Steam for the engines was provided by eight coal-fired cylindrical boilers. The ship's propulsion system provided a top speed of {{convert|15.6|kn|abbr=on}} and a range of approximately {{convert|2440|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|9|kn|abbr=on}}. ''Pfeil'' had a crew of 7&nbsp;officers and 127&nbsp;enlisted men.<ref name=G91>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 91</ref>

As built, the ship was armed with one [[12.5 cm K L/23 gun|{{convert|12.5|cm|abbr=on}} K L/23]] gun placed in a pivot mount. The gun was supplied with 100 rounds of ammunition. The ship was also equipped with four [[8.7 cm K L/23 gun|8.7&nbsp;cm K L/23]] guns in single mounts. ''Pfeil'' also carried one {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]] mounted in the bow. In 1891&ndash;92, the ship was rearmed with six [[8.8 cm SK L/30 gun]]s in single mounts and three 35&nbsp;cm torpedo tubes, one in the bow and one on each [[broadside]], all submerged in the hull.<ref name=G91/>

==Service history==
''Pfeil'' was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] shipyard in [[Wilhelmshaven]] in 1881. She was launched on 16 September 1882, and commissioned into the German fleet on 25 November 1884.<ref>Gardiner, p. 256</ref> From her commissioning, she was employed as a tender for the fleet.<ref name=G91/> ''Pfeil'' participated in the annual maneuvers in the summer of 1885. She was assigned to the unarmored division, along with the old sailing [[corvette]]s {{SMS|Stein||2}}, {{SMS|Olga||2}}, and {{SMS|Sohpie||2}}. Independent division exercises took place in June, and in August, the divisions, which also included an armored division composed of several [[ironclad warship|ironclads]] and a torpedo boat division led by ''Pfeil''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] {{SMS|Blitz||2}}, joined for combined fleet maneuvers that lasted until September.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 162</ref>

In 1889, ''Pfeil'' and the cruiser {{SMS|Schwalbe||2}} were sent to [[German East Africa]] to participate in the suppression of local resistance to German colonial rule. By November 1890, the rebellion had been defeated and German imperial rule returned. ''Pfeil'' was the first steel-hulled, unrigged warship ever sent by Germany to its African colonies.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 203</ref> In 1891, ''Pfeil'' served in the Training Squadron as a torpedo boat flotilla leader, along with ''Blitz'' and the aviso {{SMS|Jagd||2}}. During the annual summer exercises, the Training Squadron served as the hostile fleet, and conducted a mock attack on the harbor at [[Kiel]].<ref>''Notes on the Year's Naval Progress'', p. 257</ref> In early 1894, ''Pfeil'' was assigned to the I Division of the Maneuver Squadron as the dispatch vessel for the four {{sclass-|Sachsen|ironclad|1}}s.<ref>Cleveland, p. 663</ref> Later that year, the ship was used for fishery protection duties.<ref name=G91/> She participated in the summer fleet exercises in 1897, where she acted in the simulated hostile fleet.<ref>Garbett, p. 1559</ref> 

Her service as a fishery protection ship lasted until 1899, when she returned to service with the fleet. She was withdrawn from active service in 1904, when she resumed her old tender duties.<ref name=G91/> In 1912, ''Pfeil'' was assigned as the tender for the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s of the [[II Battle Squadron]].<ref>Courtney, p. 795</ref> While in the II Squadron, she wore a yellow identification band on her funnel, to distinguish her from her sister ''Blitz'', which wore a white identification stripe.<ref>''Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers'', p. 1053</ref> She remained in her tender duties through 1919. She was stricken from the [[naval register]] on 16 February 1922 and broken up for scrap at Wilhelmshaven.<ref name=G91/>
