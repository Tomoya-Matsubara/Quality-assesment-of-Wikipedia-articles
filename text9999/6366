{{dablink|This article discusses the universe from a physical or [[empirical]] viewpoint. For other uses, see [[{{{1|Universe (disambiguation)}}}]]}}
{{Cosmology}}
The word "universe" is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Old French]] ''[[Wiktionary:univers|univers]]'', which in turn comes form the [[Latin]] roots ''[[Wiktionary:unus|unus]]'' ("one") and ''[[Wiktionary:versus|versus]]'' (a form of ''vertere'', "to turn"). Physicists' concept of '''the Universe''' is motivated by the attempt to describe the whole of [[space-time]], including all [[matter]] and [[energy]] and events which occur, as a single system corresponding to a [[mathematics|mathematical]] model. [[Theoretical physics|Theoretical]] and [[Physical cosmology|observational cosmologists]] vary in their usage of the term '''Universe''' to mean either this whole system or just a part of this system. 

As used by [[Physical cosmology|observational cosmologists]], '''the Universe''' (upper case "U") most frequently refers to the finite part of space-time which is directly observable by making [[discovery (observation)|observation]]s using [[telescope]]s and other detectors and using the methods of theoretical and empirical [[physics]] for studying the basic components of the Universe and their interactions. Physical cosmologists assume that the [[observable universe|observable part]] of ([[comoving coordinates|comoving]]) space (also called: "our universe") corresponds to a ''part'' of a model of the whole of space, and usually not to the ''whole'' space. They frequently use the term '''the Universe''' to mean ''either'' the observable part of space, the observable part of space-time or the entire space-time. [[Theoretical physics|Theoretical]] cosmologists study models of the whole of space-time which is [[topology|connected]] together, and search for models which are consistent with physical cosmologists' model of space-time on the scale of the [[observable universe]]. Their models are speculative but use the methods of [[theoretical physics]]. These models are usually referred to using the term '''universe''' (lower case "u"). Sometimes theorists use '''the Universe''' (upper case "U") to refer to the whole of the specific space-time in which we live.<ref name="EllisKS03">{{cite journal

A majority of cosmologists believe that the [[observable universe]] is an extremely tiny part of the "whole" (theoretical) Universe and that it is impossible to observe the whole of [[comoving coordinates|comoving]] space. It is presently unknown whether or not this is correct, since according to studies of the [[shape of the Universe]], it is possible that the observable universe is of nearly the same size as the whole of space, but the question remains under debate.<ref name="lumrouk99">{{cite conference

Some theorists extend their model of "all of space-time" beyond a single connected space-time to a [[set]] of disconnected space-times, or [[multiverse (science)|multiverse]]. In order to clarify the terminology, [[George Ellis]], U. Kirchner and W.R. Stoeger recommend using the term '''the Universe''' for the theoretical model of all of the connected space-time in which we live, '''universe domain''' for the observable universe or a similar part of the same space-time, '''universe''' for a general space-time (either our own '''Universe''' or another one disconnected from our own), "multiverse" for a [[set]] of disconnected space-times, and "multi-domain universe" to refer to a model of the whole of a single connected space-time in the sense of [[chaotic inflation]] models.<ref name="EllisKS03" />

== Expansion and age, and the Big Bang theory ==
{{main | Age of the universe}}

The most important result of [[physical cosmology]]&mdash;that the universe is [[metric expansion of space|expanding]]&mdash;is derived from [[redshift]] observations and quantified by [[Hubble's Law]]. Extrapolating this expansion back in time, one approaches a [[gravitational singularity]], an abstract mathematical concept that may or may not correspond to reality. It gave rise to the [[Big Bang]] [[theory]], the dominant model in cosmology today. The [[age of the universe]] from the time of the Big Bang, according to current information provided by [[NASA]]'s [[WMAP]] (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe), is estimated to be about 13.7 [[1 E9|billion]] (1.37 &times; 10<sup>10</sup>) years, with a [[margin of error]] of about 1 % (&plusmn; 200 million years). Other methods of estimation give different ages ranging from 11 billion to 20 billion.<ref> {{cite web

The speed with which a [[galaxy]] recedes from the [[earth]] increases as the distance from the Earth to that galaxy. The same phenomenon can also be seen in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], which is the much-attenuated radiation that originated soon after the Big Bang. This background radiation is remarkably uniform in all directions, which cosmologists have attempted to explain by an early period of [[inflationary expansion]] following the Big Bang. 

In the 1977 book ''[[The First Three Minutes]]'', Nobel Prize-winner [[Steven Weinberg]] laid out the physics of what happened just moments after the [[Big Bang]]. Additional discoveries and refinements of theories prompted him to update and reissue that book in 1993.

=== Pre-matter soup ===

Until recently, the first hundredth of a second was a bit of a mystery, leaving Weinberg and others unable to describe exactly what the universe would have been like. New experiments at the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] in [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] have provided physicists with a glimpse through this curtain of high energy, so they can directly observe the sorts of behavior that might have been taking place in this time frame.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bnl.gov/rhic/heavy_ion.htm | title = Heavy Ion Collisions | publisher = Brookhaven National Laboratory | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}</ref>

At these energies, the [[quark]]s that comprise [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s were not yet joined together, and a dense, superhot mix of quarks and [[gluon]]s, with some electrons thrown in, was all that could exist in the microseconds before it cooled enough to form into the sort of matter particles we observe today.<ref>{{cite web | author = Thomas Ludlam, Larry McLerran | date = October 2003 | url = http://www.aip.org/pt/vol-56/iss-10/p48.html | title = What Have We Learned From the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider? | publisher = Physics Today | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}</ref>

=== First galaxies ===

Fast forwarding to after the existence of matter, more information is coming in on the formation of galaxies. It is believed that the earliest galaxies were tiny "dwarf galaxies" that released so much radiation they stripped gas atoms of their electrons. This gas, in turn, heated up and expanded, and thus was able to obtain the mass needed to form the larger galaxies that we know today.

Current telescopes are just now beginning to have the capacity to observe the galaxies from this distant time. Studying the light from [[quasars]], they observe how it passes through the intervening gas clouds. The ionization of these gas clouds is determined by the number of nearby bright galaxies, and if such galaxies are spread around, the ionization level should be constant. It turns out that in galaxies from the period after cosmic reionization there are large fluctuations in this ionization level. The evidence seems to confirm the pre-ionization galaxies were less common and that the post-ionization galaxies have 100 times the mass of the dwarf galaxies. 

The next generation of telescopes should be able to see the dwarf galaxies directly, which will help resolve the problem that many astronomical predictions in galaxy formation theory predict more nearby small galaxies.

==Composition==
The currently observable universe appears to have a geometrically flat space-time containing the equivalent mass-energy density of 9.9 &times; 10<sup>-30</sup> grams per cubic centimetre. The primary constituents appear to consist of 73% [[dark energy]], 23% cold [[dark matter]] and 4% atoms. Thus the density of atoms is on the order of a single Hydrogen nucleus for every four cubic meters of volume.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hinshaw | first = Gary |date= February 10, 2006 | url = http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni/uni_101matter.html | title = What is the Universe Made Of? | publisher = NASA WMAP | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref> The exact nature of dark energy and cold dark matter remain a mystery.

During the early phases of the big bang, equal amounts of matter and [[Antimatter|anti-matter]] were formed. However, through a [[CP-violation]], physical processes resulted in an asymmetry in the amount of matter as compared to anti-matter. This asymmetry explains the amount of residual matter found in the universe today, as
nearly all the matter and anti-matter would otherwise have annihilated each other when they come into contact.<ref>{{cite web | date = October 28, 2003 | url = http://www.pparc.ac.uk/ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp | title = Antimatter | publisher = Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council | accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}</ref>

Prior to the formation of the first stars, the chemical composition of the Universe consisted primarily of [[Hydrogen]] (75% of total mass), with a lesser amount of [[Helium]] <sup>4</sup>He (24% of total mass) and trace amounts of other elements.<ref>{{cite web | last =  Wright | first = Edward L. |date= September 12, 2004 | url = http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html | title = Big Bang Nucleosynthesis | publisher = UCLA | accessdate = 2007-01-05 }}</ref> A small portion of these elements were in the form of the [[isotope]]s [[Deuterium]], <sup>3</sup>He and [[Lithium]] <sup>7</sup>Li.<ref>{{cite journal | author=M.

The big bang left behind a background flux of photons and [[neutrino]]s.

==Physical structure==
===Size===
[[Image:Universe.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The deepest visible-light image of the cosmos, the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]].]]
{{main | Observable universe}}

Very little is known about the size of the universe. It may be trillions of light years across, or even infinite in size. A 2003 paper <ref>Neil J. Cornish, David N. Spergel, Glenn D. Starkman, and Eiichiro Komatsu, ''Constraining the Topology of the Universe''. [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310233 astro-ph/0310233]</ref> claims to establish a lower bound of 24 gigaparsecs (78 billion light years) on the size of the universe, but there is no reason to believe that this bound is anywhere near tight<!--no, this is not a misspelling of "right"-->. See [[Shape of the Universe]] for more information.

The ''observable'' (or ''visible'') universe, consisting of all locations that could have affected us since the Big Bang given the finite [[speed of light]], is certainly finite. The [[comoving distance]] to the edge of the visible universe is about 46.5 billion light years in all directions from the earth; thus the visible universe may be thought of as a perfect sphere with the earth at its center and a diameter of about 93 billion light years. Note that many sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe, ranging from 13.7 to 180 billion light years. See [[Observable universe]] for a list of incorrect figures published in the popular press with explanations of each.

===Shape===
{{main | Shape of the universe | Large-scale structure of the cosmos}}
{{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}}
An important open question of cosmology is the shape of the universe. Mathematically, which [[manifold|3-manifold]] best represents the spatial part of the universe?

Firstly, whether the universe is spatially ''flat'', i.e. whether the rules of [[Euclidean geometry]] are valid on the largest scales, is unknown. Currently, most cosmologists believe that the observable universe is very nearly spatially flat, with local wrinkles where massive objects distort [[spacetime]], just as the surface of a lake is nearly flat. This opinion was strengthened by the latest data from [[WMAP]], looking at "acoustic oscillations" in the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature variations.

Secondly, whether the universe is [[multiply connected]] is unknown. The universe has no spatial boundary according to the standard Big Bang model, but nevertheless may be spatially finite ([[compact space|compact]]). This can be understood using a two-dimensional analogy: the surface of a [[sphere]] has no edge, but nonetheless has a finite area. It is a two-dimensional surface with constant curvature in a third dimension. The [[3-sphere]] is a three-dimensional equivalent in which all three dimensions are constantly curved in a fourth.

{{tone}}
If the universe is compact and without boundary (described in the previous paragraph) then traveling in a "straight" line, in any given direction, could, theoretically, cause one to eventually arrive back at the starting point.  In this case, the stars and galaxies may appear to repeat.  If, further, the universe is multiply-connected and sufficiently small (and of an appropriate, perhaps complex, shape) then it is conceivable that one might be able to see once or several times around it in various<U+2014>and, perhaps, all<U+2014>directions.  Although this possibility has not been ruled out, the results of the latest [[cosmic microwave background]] research make this appear very unlikely. {{fact}}

===Homogeneity and isotropy===
While there is considerable fractalized structure at the local level (arranged in a hierarchy of clustering), on the highest orders of distance the universe is very homogeneous. On these scales the density of the universe is very uniform, and there is no preferred direction or significant asymmetry to the universe. This homogeneity is a requirement of the [[Friedmann-Lema<U+00EE>tre-Robertson-Walker metric]] employed in modern cosmological models.<ref>{{cite journal | author=N. Mandolesi, P. Calzolari, S. Cortiglioni, F. Delpino, G. Sironi | title=Large-scale homogeneity of the Universe measured by the microwave background | journal=Letters to Nature | year=1986 | volume=319 | pages=751-753 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v319/n6056/abs/319751a0.html }}</ref>

[[Image:WMAP.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Fluctuations in the microwave background radiation. ''NASA/WMAP image.'']]
The question of anisotropy in the early universe was significantly answered by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]], which looked for fluctuations in the microwave background intensity.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hinshaw | first = Gary |date= November 29, 2006 | url = http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm.html | title = New Three Year Results on the Oldest Light in the Universe | publisher = NASA WMAP | accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}</ref> The measurements of this anisotropy have provided useful
information and constraints about the evolution of the universe.

To the limit of the observing power of astronomical instruments, objects radiate and absorb energy according to the same [[physical law]]s as they do within our own galaxy.<ref>{{cite web | last = Strobel | first = Nick |date= May 23, 2001 | url = http://www.astronomynotes.com/starprop/s7.htm | title = The Composition of Stars | publisher = Astronomy Notes | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref> Based on this, it is believed that the same physical laws and constants are universally applicable throughout the observable universe. No confirmed evidence has yet been found to show that physical constants have varied since the big bang, and the possible variation is becoming well constrained.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part4/section-4.html | title = Have physical constants changed with time? | publisher = Astrophysics (Astronomy Frequently Asked Questions) | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref>

==Ultimate fate==
{{main | Ultimate fate of the universe}}

Depending on the average density of matter and energy in the universe, it will either keep on expanding forever or it will be gravitationally slowed down and will eventually collapse back on itself in a "[[Big Crunch]]". Currently the evidence suggests not only that there is insufficient mass/energy to cause a recollapse, but that the expansion of the universe seems to be accelerating and will accelerate for [[eternity]] (see [[accelerating universe]]). Other ideas of the fate of our universe include the [[Big Rip]], the [[Big Freeze]], and [[Heat death of the universe]] theory. For a more detailed discussion of other theories, see the [[ultimate fate of the universe]].

== Multiverse ==
{{main | Multiverse (science)}}

There is some speculation that multiple universes exist in a higher-level [[Multiverse (science)|multiverse]] (also known as a megaverse), our universe being one of those universes. For example, matter that falls into a [[black hole]] in our universe could emerge as a Big Bang, starting another universe. However, all such ideas are currently untestable and cannot be regarded as anything more than speculation. The concept of parallel universes is understood only when related to [[string theory]]. String theorist [[Michio Kaku]] offered several explanations to possible [[parallel universe]] phenomena.

== Other terms ==

[[Image:Universum.jpg|thumb|300px|Colorized version of the [[Flammarion woodcut]].  The original was published in Paris in 1888.]]

Different words have been used throughout [[history]] to denote "all of space", including the equivalents and variants in various languages of "heavens," "[[cosmos]]," and "world." [[Macrocosm]] has also been used to this effect, although it is more specifically defined as a system that reflects in large scale one, some, or all of its component systems or parts. (Similarly, a [[microcosm]] is a system that reflects in small scale a much larger system of which it is a part.)

Although words like [[world]] and its equivalents in other languages now almost always refer to the planet [[Earth]], they previously referred to everything that exists <U+2014> see [[Copernicus]], for example <U+2014> and still sometimes do (as in "the whole wide world"). Some languages use the word for "world" as part of the word for "outer space", e.g. in the [[German language|German]] word "Weltraum"

This card represents the principle of Totality, Individuation/Wholeness and stands for the integration of inner paradoxes and contradictions, and for cutting one's limitations and 'weaving them to a web, on which the one can dance'.
