'''Wentworth Military Academy and College''' is a private four-year [[college preparatory]] [[high school]] and [[military junior college]].  It is located in [[Lexington, Missouri]], part of the Greater [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]].  Wentworth is the oldest [[military academy]] west of the [[Mississippi River]], and the campus is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  Wentworth is nationally known for preparing young men and women for successful civilian and military careers.  It is one of five military junior colleges in the United States.  Among the programs that Wentworth offers is the Army's two-year [[Early Commissioning Program]] (ECP), an Army [[Reserve Officers Training Corps]] (ROTC) program through which qualified students can earn a commission as a [[Second Lieutenant]] after only two years of college.  According to its website, Wentworth also has had 100% acceptance into the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] over the past 18 years through its [[Falcon Foundation]] Scholarship program.  Because the high school shares the campus with the junior college, many high school students accelerate their education and gain college credit during their junior and senior years.  Over 95% of Wentworth graduates go on to college.  The strength of Wentworth<U+2019>s academic program is reflected by the fact that over the last twenty-five years, the Academy has sent more than 150 cadets to top twenty colleges, as ranked by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'', including the [[University of California]], [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]], [[Harvard]], [[Yale]], [[Cornell]], the [[London School of Economics]], the [[Air Force Academy]], [[West Point]], and the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]].  Thousands more Wentworth students have gone on to earn degrees at private and public colleges and universities throughout the country.

==High school==

Wentworth takes advantage of the fact that it is one of few schools in the United States that has a college and high school sharing the same campus by encouraging all its high school students to gain college credit before they graduate from high school.  In 2007, Wentworth announced that they would offer a three-tiered program designed to serve the needs of its students.  The most advanced program, the [[Accelerated Scholars Program]], allows its students to graduate from high school and obtain an [[Associate's degree]] from the junior college simultaneously.

===Wentworth Launching Scholars===

For students with high academic potential, this program provides eligible students an opportunity to take both college and high school classes, earn simultaneous high school graduation credit for the college classes, and graduate with approximately 1 semester (6-12 credit hours) or more of college already complete.  

===Wentworth Distinguished Scholars===

Designed for honor students, this program affords eligible students an opportunity to take both college and high school classes, earn simultaneous high school graduation credit for the college classes, and graduate with approximately one year (24 - 32 credit hours) or more of college already complete.

===The Accelerated Scholars Program===

The [[Accelerated Scholars Program]] is an [[early college entrance program]] for top flight students entering their junior year of high school.  After two years, those who successfully complete the program are awarded with both their high school diplomas AND either their [[Associate of Arts]] or [[Associate of Science]] degrees. They are then eligible to enter most four-year colleges and universities as a college junior.

This two-year program is modeled after Wentworth's nationally recognized Air Force Academy preparatory program.<ref>[http://www.wma1880.org/htmls/military_falcons.htm Wentworth - The Success School (TM)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In addition to the challenging academic curriculum, the Accelerated Scholars also receive formal leadership instruction through a number of sources which include college level classroom instruction, supervised leadership practical exercises, confidence and team building activities, and everyday opportunities to place learned leadership skills into practice with their peers.  Among the eligibility requirements for the Accelerated Scholars Program are: (1) successfully complete the 10th grade; (2) possess a cumulative GPA of 3.5; (3) have a composite ACT score of 23; (4) complete a comprehensive application which includes a personal interview and up to 6 academic evaluation forms.<ref>[http://www.wma1880.org/htmls/wma_acc_sch_prgrm.htm Earn Your 2 Year College Degree AND High School Diploma in 2 Years!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Camp LEAD summer program===

Wentworth<U+2019>s Camp Lead summer program allows students to earn up to 6 college credits and participate in programs such as [[Marine Biology]] (in which they earn lifetime [[SCUBA]] certification), [[Aviation]] (including ground school and flight orientation), or Advanced Military Skills, where students learn advanced leadership and can be awarded a conditional college [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) scholarship.

===Study Time===
Call to Quarters (CQ) is a two-hour study session held every school night (Sunday <U+2013> Thursday), from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.  If a student is caught up with his or her studies, he or she can use CQs to get ahead or write a letter home or other quiet activity.  Those who require more study time can request it.  Members of the faculty are assigned as Duty Officers and are available on each floor to assist cadets who need help.

==College and Senior ROTC program==

Wentworth's College provides the opportunity to receive a commission in the [[U.S. Army]], [[Army Reserve]] or [[Army National Guard]].  Wentworth<U+2019>s Senior Army ROTC offers two and four-year programs for becoming an Army Officer.  Wentworth also has a one-year Service Academy Prep program.  Other college graduates do not pursue the military, but choose to continue on to the nation's most competitive four-year colleges and universities as rising juniors.

===Two-Year Early Commissioning Program===

Wentworth<U+2019>s [[Early Commissioning Program]] (ECP) is a two-year ROTC program that allows college students to receive a U.S. Army commission as a Second Lieutenant upon graduation as a college sophomore.  Wentworth<U+2019>s ECP graduates have a number of advantages compared with a graduate of a four-year ROTC commissioning program.   In addition to the valuable intensive leadership training obtained, those Wentworth college sophomores who are commissioned as second lieutenants have a two year head start toward promotions and retirement. 

The ECP is tailored for those who have completed one of three requirements: 
#three or more years of [[JROTC]]; 
# Leaders Training Course at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]] or [[Basic Training]]; and/or 
# AIT with the National Guard or Army Reserve.  
Applicants who meet this criteria are eligible for two different two-year scholarship opportunities: the Military Junior College Scholarship (MJC) or the Campus-based Scholarship.  Recipients of the MJC Scholarship serve in a Guard or Reserve Unit while enrolled, while Campus-based recipients cannot serve in the Guard or Reserve.  Upon graduation from Wentworth with an [[Associate's degree]] and a commission, recipients must complete their bachelor<U+2019>s degree at a four year college of their choice that offers ROTC, and they must graduate within three years of commissioning.  Recipients will also serve with a Guard or Reserve unit while completing their bachelor<U+2019>s degree.

===Four-Year Commissioning Program===
 
Wentworth<U+2019>s four-year program is known as the 2+2 Scholarship Program.  This is a unique, one-of-a-kind, four-year ROTC scholarship broken into two separate, but significant parts.  Recipients attend their freshman and sophomore years at Wentworth, enrolled in the basic [[Military Science]] Program (Military Science Levels I and II).  Upon completion at Wentworth, students earn an [[Associate of Arts]] or [[Associate of Science]] Degree, then transfer to either [[Missouri Valley College]] in [[Marshall, Missouri]], or the [[University of Central Missouri]] in [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], to complete their junior and senior year.  They then complete the advanced Military Science Program (Military Science Levels III and IV).  Successful completion of the 2+2 Scholarship Program culminates with a bachelor<U+2019>s degree and a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army, Army Reserve, or National Guard.  

===Air Force Academy Falcon Scholarship Program===

Wentworth partners with the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] and the Falcon Foundation to offer academically talented students a one-year scholarship at Wentworth that leads to an appointment at the United States Air Force Academy, one of the most selective higher education institutions in the country.  Wentworth traditionally accepts fewer than one in seven applicants. Over the past 18 years, Wentworth has had a 100% success rate getting its Falcon Scholars accepted to the USAFA.  Wentworth also has sent a number of students on to [[West Point]] and the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] through its Service Academy Prep program.

==Regional civilian college programs==
===Extension sites and commuter college program===

In addition to the main campus in Lexington for about 250 resident full-time students comprising the Corps of Cadets, Wentworth serves several hundred local area commuter college students.  Wentworth also has three extension centers located around the state of Missouri in [[Cameron, Missouri|Cameron]], [[Hermitage, Missouri|Hermitage]], and  [[Lamar, Missouri|Lamar]], serving a total of over 1500 commuter full- and part-time students.

===Dual enrollment with area high schools===

Wentworth<U+2019>s college partners with numerous high schools within Missouri and Kansas to offer a dual enrollment program. This program provides qualifying high school junior and seniors the opportunity to earn college credits while completing their high school graduation requirements within the setting of their own high school. Approved college-certified faculty teach students using a college level curriculum. At completion, the student receives credit for the appropriate high school course in addition to earning college credit hours from Wentworth. College credits earned through Wentworth's dual enrollment program will transfer to most colleges and universities.

==Accreditation==

Wentworth's high school is accredited by the North Central Association, and Wentworth's college is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.  In addition, Wentworth is a member of such organizations as the [[National Association of Community Colleges]], [[The Association of Boarding Schools]], the [[Association of Military Colleges and Schools of the United States]], and others.<ref>www.wma.edu</ref>

==Student life==
===Corps of Cadets===
The Wentworth Corps of Cadets consists of approximately 250 students, ranging from 9th grade through junior college sophomores.  The corps is divided up into five companies, and junior college cadets provide most of the corps' leadership, supervised by Wentworth staff and faculty.  When cadets begin at Wentworth, they undergo a process of learning and preparation called the <U+201C>RAT<U+201D> phase.  RAT stands for Recruit-at-Training, based on [[Virginia Military Institute]] traditions put in place by Wentworth's first commandant in the 1880s.  The RAT system is designed to help new students adapt quickly to the Academy<U+2019>s unique demands and requirements, which allow the RAT to master the habits of success, including time-management skills, character growth, self-discipline, critical thinking, and leadership development. At the end of the RAT period, cadets are <U+201C>promoted<U+201D> from New Boy to Old Boy, making them full-fledged members of the Corps of Cadets.

===Athletics===

Wentworth offers a wide variety of organized and intramural athletics for both High School and College.  Wentworth<U+2019>s campus features four full-sized outdoor athletic fields and eight tennis courts.  The 65,000 square foot Wikoff Athletic Center includes three basketball courts, a Laykold-type indoor track, a racquetball court, a weight room, a wrestling room, a Jacuzzi and an Olympic-size pool.

The high school is a member of the Missouri State High School Activities Association (Division 1-A) and the Mid-State Conference. The high school Wentworth Red Dragons compete in football, basketball, soccer, wrestling, track and field, cross country, volleyball, swimming, golf, and tennis.  

The college is affiliated with the Missouri Community College Conference and National Junior College Athletic Association, and competes in track, wrestling, soccer, cross country, tennis and golf.

For many years, the annual football game with rival [[Kemper Military School and College]] in [[Boonville, Missouri]] was a huge event on Thanksgiving Day, with both corps of cadets boarding trains and either meeting on their home fields, or sometimes meeting on a neutral field in [[Sedalia]] or [[Marshall, Missouri]]. The Kansas City and St. Louis newspapers referred to the gridiron battle as the <U+201C>Little Army-Navy Game<U+201D>, and gave front page coverage to the outcome.

===Extracurricular activities===
Cadets participate in a range of extracurricular activities normally two days a week.  The remaining days are dedicated to ROTC lab exercises or athletics.  Activities vary by season and sponsor but usually include aviation, newspaper, yearbook, camera club, quiz bowl, jazz band, chorus, horseback riding, swimming, SCUBA diving, paintball, rock climbing, archery, Rangers, rifle team, scouting, and more.  

===Honor Guard===
Wentworth<U+2019>s Honor Guard was formed in 1945 and is comprised primarily from the top academic students of the corps.  One of the Guard's main functions is to assist the cadre with the enforcement of the institution's rules and regulations.  But its primary function is as an elite drill team, performing what is known as the <U+201C>Silent Drill<U+201D> - a ten minute sequence of intricate marching maneuvers requiring absolute precision and perfection. 

===Marching band===
During the 1896-1897 school year, Captain [[E. J. Stark]] organized the first Wentworth band of fifteen pieces.  When Captain Stark left in 1905 to become a noted ragtime composer and arranger, he was succeeded by Captain F.A. Day who led the band for the next 31 years.  In 1955, new band director Captain James Bell inaugurated a routine which formed the basis of Wentworth<U+2019>s famous "Snap Drill", still being performed today.  In the 1970s, under the direction of Captain Roger Kendall, now a music professor at [[UCLA]], the band reached new heights, winning national band competitions, and performing and recording Captain Kendall<U+2019>s original <U+201C>Centennial Symphony<U+201D>, produced especially for Wentworth<U+2019>s centennial year in 1980.  Through the years, the band has performed in countless parades including [[Mardi Gras]], the [[National Cherry Blossom Festival|Cherry Blossom]] parade, presidential inaugural parades, and gubernatorial inaugural parades, as well as appearing at [[Kansas City Royals]] games, [[Kansas City Chiefs]] games, and numerous band competitions.  The band is still Wentworth<U+2019>s premier public relations vehicle.

===Community service===
Wentworth college and high school cadets are all encouraged to perform community service,  Such service is a graduation requirement for high school cadets. Seniors must complete 20 hours, juniors 18, sophomores 16, and freshman 14 per academic year to fulfill the requirement.   This past year, Wentworth cadets supported a variety of charitable causes in Lafayette County and Kansas City and contributed 2,768 hours of service, with some cadets personally contributing in excess of 50 hours.

==History==
===Background===
Lexington's [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Battle of Lexington I|Battle of the Hemp Bales]] was still a recent memory when [[Stephen G. Wentworth]] founded Wentworth Military Academy in 1880.  By the 1870s, the town had already attained the reputation as the <U+201C>Athens of the West<U+201D> for its fine academic institutions.  Lexington was home to three outstanding schools for girls.  [[Lexington Baptist Female College]] was started in 1850 in the old county courthouse that had been abandoned upon the construction of the new [[Lafayette County Courthouse]], built in 1847 and still in use today.  In 1869 the Baptist Female College moved its operation to the former home of [[Pony Express]] Founder [[William B. Waddell]] at the corner of 13th and South Streets.  Elizabeth Aull Seminary was opened in the fall of 1860 and operated in a large building on Highland Avenue.  Central Female College, later [[Central College for Women]], began in 1868 and, in 1871, took over the old [[Masonic College]] on the grounds of the Battlefield.

However, Lexington<U+2019>s educators, business leaders and ministers had made numerous attempts to establish a school for boys and young men.  Public schools were not yet widespread and there was a glaring need for a boys' school, but none had been successful.  Perhaps the most notable failed effort was the Masonic College of Missouri, which moved to Lexington in 1847 and operated until 1859.

===Wentworth Male Academy===

On May 12, 1879, Wentworth<U+2019>s twenty-seven year old son William died.  As a memorial, Wentworth focused his attention on finally making a school for boys a reality in Lexington.  In the spring of 1880, Mr. Wentworth announced that a new school named Wentworth Male Academy would begin operation in the fall.  Mr. Wentworth had a long record of public service to Lexington.  A local editorial writer proclaimed that Wentworth was <U+201C>One of our oldest, most generous and most worthy citizens<U+201D> and <U+201D>no nobler name can this community furnish [the new school].<U+201D>   On May 24, 1880, Mr. Wentworth bought the <U+201C>New Presbyterian Church<U+201D> at the southwest corner of 18th and Main Streets, directed that it be fitted up for the next term, and gave the school solid financial backing.  Although his financial involvement was limited to the Academy<U+2019>s early years of operation, his foresight led to the establishment of the first board of trustees and his generosity provided a firm foundation for the school.

Wentworth also announced that twenty-two year old Benjamin Lewis Hobson, the son of the local Presbyterian minister who had run a fledgling private boys<U+2019> school in town the previous year, would be given charge of W.M.A.  Young Hobson had graduated from [[Centre College]] in [[Danville, Kentucky]] with a degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1877, and had spent the next two years as teacher and then principal of [[Spencer Institute]] in [[Taylorsville, Kentucky]].  In the summer of 1879, he had returned to his hometown of Lexington and started Hobson<U+2019>s Select School for Boys.

Benjamin Hobson knew that he could not operate the new school alone, and he turned to [[Sandford Sellers]], a twenty-six year-old friend and former classmate at [[Centre College]] in [[Kentucky]].  Sellers eagerly accepted Hobson<U+2019>s invitation to join him as co-principal at Wentworth Male Academy.  When Hobson left to pursue a career in the ministry at the end of the 1880-81 school year, Sellers took full charge of the academy.

===Wentworth Military Academy===

Sandford Sellers became the force who forged Wentworth<U+2019>s national reputation, and his hand would ably guide the school for the next 58 years.  In the early days, he handled all the institution<U+2019>s administrative affairs, academic planning, and student recruitment on his own, canvassing surrounding areas on horseback.  In 1882, Wentworth became a [[military school]], and Sellers hired Captain David W. Fleet, a graduate of [[Virginia Military Institute]], as the first Commandant.  Fleet brought VMI terms such as "rats", "rears", and "Old Boys" to the school, all still familiar to cadets today.  The school officially changed its name to '''Wentworth Military Academy''' in 1890.

Sellers' skills as educator, administrator, businessman, and promoter saw the institution through its remarkable first half-century, and his vision is still evident today.  He led the school through economic panics of the 1890s, when he struggled to keep enrollment above 100, and through the boom times of [[World War I]], when enrollment more than doubled to over 500 cadets.  He also oversaw the addition of the junior college in 1923.  
 
By the mid-1920s, Sandford Sellers, handed over much of the day-to-day operations of the school to his sons, [[Sandford Sellers, Jr.]], superintendent from 1923 to 1933, and [[James M. Sellers]], Commandant and Assistant Superintendent.  But Sandford Sellers stayed very involved until his death in 1938 after a fall in the school gymnasium.

===From the Great Depression to post-World War II prosperity===

When the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s hit the country, Wentworth, like many institutions across the country, struggled to survive.  In 1933, Colonel [[James M. Sellers]] assumed the superintendency of the school and was soon joined at the helm by Colonel [[Lester B. Wikoff]], Treasurer and Business Manager.  Together, Sellers<U+2019> natural leadership and Wikoff<U+2019>s business acumen would lead the school to new heights.  Colonel Sellers and Colonel Wikoff led the school through the lean years of the 1930s and into the prosperity of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  During their term of leadership, Wentworth added a number of buildings to the campus, including the Sellers-Wikoff Scholastic Building, the Memorial Chapel, Sandford Sellers Hall, and the Wikoff Field House.  In addition, a unique military aviator training program complete with its own airport was launched to train pilots.  A highlight of the Sellers-Wikoff era was President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s speech to the cadet corps at Wentworth's 75th Anniversary celebration in 1954. In 1960, Sellers retired as Superintendent but remained as President of the school, and Wikoff served as Superintendent from 1960 to 1971.  During that time, Wentworth had unparalleled enrollment, averaging over 600 students a year.

===Continuity and change in the post-Vietnam era===

In 1973, a third generation of the Sellers family assumed leadership of the Academy when Colonel [[James M. Sellers, Jr.]], a 1945 Wentworth graduate, was named as Superintendent.  In the early 1970s, the school was again faced with crisis.  Anti-military backlash from the country<U+2019>s continued involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], combined with double digit inflation, caused enrollment to plummet.  Many military schools across the country simply closed their doors.  Wentworth was dealt an additional blow when, in 1975, a fire destroyed two buildings and severely damaged others, causing the loss of over {{convert|32000|sqft|sqm|-2}} of space.

Despite these setbacks, Colonel J. M. Sellers, Jr., was able to stabilize enrollment by 1978 and lead the Academy through another period of growth.  In 1980, Wentworth celebrated its centennial year, with Vice-President [[Walter Mondale]] addressing the corps of cadets at commencement.  In the early 1980s, enrollment continued to rise, peaking at over 400 cadets in 1984.  In 1990, Colonel Sellers, Sr., who taught Latin until he was 95 years old, died, and Colonel Sellers, Jr., resigned as superintendent, ending a remarkable 110 years of the Sellers family<U+2019>s continuous involvement in the operation of the Academy.

===Modern expansion===

In the 1990s, Wentworth regrouped.  Female cadets were admitted for the first time in 1993, and today they make up about twenty-five percent of the corps.  In 2002, Major General [[John H. Little]], Wentworth Class of 1961, returned to campus as Superintendent.  Under his stewardship, a new state-of-the-art barracks, Tillotson Hall, was constructed, and the growth of the Wentworth Foundation put the school on solid financial footing.

Wentworth is now in its 128th year and new Superintendent Captain [[Basil Read]] (USN ret.) has brought a clear new vision for the future, taking advantage of the fact that Wentworth is one of few schools in the country where a high school shares a campus with a college.  Captain Read has established Wentworth's Accelerated Scholars program, Distinguished Scholars program, and Launching Scholars program, and now all Wentworth high school cadets will graduate with some college credit.  He also is expanding Wentworth Junior College's dual enrollment program with area high schools, and has strengthened and expanded the programs within the military junior college.
