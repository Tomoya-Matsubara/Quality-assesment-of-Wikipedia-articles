'''US Highway&nbsp;27''' ('''US&nbsp;27''') is a part of the [[US Highway System]] that now runs from [[Miami, Florida]], to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. In the US state of [[Michigan]], it was a [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] that entered the state south of [[Kinderhook, Michigan|Kinderhook]] and ended south of [[Grayling, Michigan|Grayling]]. Its route consisted of a freeway [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|Interstate&nbsp;69]] (I-69) from the state line north to the [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] area before it followed its own freeway facility northward to [[St. Johns, Michigan|St. Johns]]. From there north to [[Ithaca, Michigan|Ithaca]], US&nbsp;27 was an [[limited-access highway|expressway]] before continuing as a freeway to a terminus south of Grayling.

Created with the rest of the US Highway System on November 11, 1926, US&nbsp;27 replaced a pair of state highways between the state line and the [[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]] area. For a time, US&nbsp;27 even extended from Cheboygan to St. Ignace over the [[Mackinac Bridge]]. The highway was converted into a series of freeways starting in the late 1950s. The northernmost section between Grayling and [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]], bypassing Cheboygan, became part of [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]], and US&nbsp;27 was truncated to Grayling. Starting in the 1960s, the southern sections were included in I-69. The last section of Interstate in Michigan was completed in 1992 when I-69/US&nbsp;27 opened southwest of Lansing. In the 1990s, a bypass of [[St. Johns, Michigan|St. Johns]] north of Lansing was built, the last freeway segment of US&nbsp;27 to open before the designation was decommissioned in 2002. Former segments of US&nbsp;27 from its pre-freeway configuration are still state highways in the form of [[M-27 (Michigan highway)|M-27]] between [[Indian River, Michigan|Indian River]] and Cheboygan or the various [[business route]]s in the state that previously bore Business US&nbsp;27 (BUS US&nbsp;27) designations.

==Route description==
===Southern Michigan===
I-69/US&nbsp;27 in Michigan began at the Indiana state line southeast of [[Kinderhook, Michigan|Kinderhook]], just north of an interchange with the [[Indiana Toll Road]] ([[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]]/[[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]]). From there, I-69/US&nbsp;27 ran northward through a mixture of [[Southern Michigan]] farmland and woodland in [[Branch County, Michigan|Branch County]]. A few miles north of the state line, the freeway passes [[Coldwater Lake State Park]] and its namesake body of water; north of the lake, there is a [[welcome center]] for the northbound lanes. I-69/US&nbsp;27 curved around the east side of [[Coldwater, Michigan|Coldwater]], connecting to the city's [[Interstate 69 Business (Coldwater, Michigan)|business loop]] on the south of town. The freeway intersects the northern end of the business loop immediately east of downtown at an interchange that also features [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|US&nbsp;12]] (Chicago Road). A third interchange, some {{convert/spell|3|mi|km}} further north, features a [[distribution center]] for [[Walmart]] stores in the region.<!-- the DC opened in 1998--> Further north, the freeway curves around to the northwest into Calhoun County and crosses over the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]]. I-69/US&nbsp;27 turned back northward and bypassed [[Tekonsha, Michigan|Tekonsha]] to the town's west, intersecting [[M-60 (Michigan highway)|M-60]] in the process.<ref name=MDOT02>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Official Department of Transportation Map |cartography= MDOT |year= 2002  |scale= 1&nbsp;in:14.5&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |section= }}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |title= Overview Map of Former US&nbsp;27 in Michigan |url= http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=I-69+N&daddr=US-127+N&hl=en&sll=44.586922,-84.70401&sspn=0.014732,0.014892&geocode=FVozfQIdrCnv-g%3BFbBRqAIdlXnz-g&t=h&mra=ls&z=8 |accessdate= August&nbsp;24, 2013}}</ref>

Curving around [[Nottawa Lake]], I-69/US&nbsp;27 continued northward through southern Calhoun County. It passed through an interchange that marked the southern terminus of [[M-227 (Michigan highway)|M-227]], a highway that runs northward into [[Marshall, Michigan|Marshall]]. The freeway crosses the [[Kalamazoo River]] and through an interchange with [[M-96 (Michigan highway)|M-96]] west of downtown Marshall. From that interchange northward, the [[Interstate 94 Business (Marshall, Michigan)|BL I-94]] designation was overlaid on I-69/US&nbsp;27; the business loop ends at the [[cloverleaf interchange]] with I-94 northwest of Marshall. North of I-94, I-69/US&nbsp;27 had one more interchange before crossing into Eaton County.<ref name=MDOT02/><ref name=google/>

[[File:I-96 and I-496, Lansing.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Aerial view looking north from the I-496 interchange along I-96/I-69/US&nbsp;27 west of Lansing]]
In southern Eaton County, the freeway parallels the [[Battle Creek River]] north of the junction with [[M-78 (Michigan highway)|M-78]]. Near [[Olivet, Michigan|Olivet]], I-69/US&nbsp;27 began to turn in a northeasterly direction. As it continued in that direction, it ran to the north side of Olivet. On the south side of [[Charlotte, Michigan|Charlotte]], I-69/US&nbsp;27 turned northward, traversing an area to the east of downtown and crossing the former routing of US&nbsp;27, which is now part of the [[Interstate 69 Business (Charlotte, Michigan)|business loop for the city]]. Further north, the freeway has a junction with [[M-50 (Michigan highway)|M-50]], a bridge over the Battle Creek River, and an interchange with the northern end of the business loop next to [[Fitch H. Beach Airport]]. North of the airport, I-69/US&nbsp;27 turned northeasterly again and paralleled Lansing Road, the former route of US&nbsp;27/M-78. The freeway meets the southern end of [[M-100 (Michigan highway)|M-100]] near [[Potterville, Michigan|Potterville]] and continues onto the Lansing<U+2013>[[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] metropolitan area. Southwest of the state's capital city, I-69/US&nbsp;27 crossed over Lansing Road near [[Lansing Delta Township Assembly]], a factory for [[General Motors]]; northeast of the complex, I-69/US&nbsp;27 merged into I-96. The combined I-96/I-69/US&nbsp;27 ran northward through the suburban edges of the Lansing area, intersecting the western ends of [[Interstate 496|I-496]] and the [[Interstate 69 Business (Lansing, Michigan)|BL I-69 for Lansing]]. The freeway enters [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]], and just north of a crossing of the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]], I-69/US&nbsp;27 turned eastward to separate from I-96. As a part of the larger interchange with I-96, I-69/US&nbsp;27 crossed [[Interstate 96 Business (Lansing, Michigan)|BL I-96]] ([[Grand River Avenue]]) without any connections.<ref name=MDOT02/><ref name=google/>

===Mid-Michigan to Grayling===
After leaving the I-96 concurrency, I-69 changes cardinal orientation and is signed as east<U+2013>west from that point on. The freeway continues parallel to the [[Looking Glass River]] through suburban areas north of [[Capital Region International Airport]]. North of East Lansing, I-69/US&nbsp;27 met [[U.S. Route 127 in Michigan|US&nbsp;127]] at a cloverleaf interchange, and US&nbsp;27 turned northward to separate from I-69. The US&nbsp;27 freeway ran through farmland and crossed the Looking Glass River. At Price Road, US&nbsp;27 met its southernmost business loop, the [[U.S. Route 27 Business (St. Johns, Michigan)|BUS US&nbsp;27]] for [[St. Johns, Michigan|St. Johns]]. The freeway continues due north and intersects [[M-21 (Michigan highway)|M-21]] east of town before it turns northwesterly to round the northern side of St. Johns. North of downtown, US&nbsp;27 met the northern end of the business loop and the freeway ends. Continuing northward as an [[limited-access road|expressway]], the highway has four lanes divided by a [[median (road)|median]] with [[grade separation|at-grade]] intersections at the cross roads.<ref name=MDOT02/><ref name=google/>

In [[Gratiot County, Michigan|Gratiot County]], US&nbsp;27 was named Bagley Road. North of Wilson Road, the expressway crosses the [[Maple River (Grand River)|Maple River]] on a causeway through a wetland area in the [[List of Michigan state game areas|Maple River State Game Area]].<ref name=MDOT02/><ref name=google/> North of the river, the expressway crosses a branch line of the [[Great Lakes Central Railroad]],<ref name=google/><ref name=MDOT-RR>{{cite map |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_Official_Rail_130897_7.pdf |title= Michigan's Railroad System |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |month= January |year= 2011 |cartography= Michigan Center for Shared Solutions & Technology Partnerships |accessdate= February&nbsp;1, 2011 |format= PDF}}</ref> then has an interchange with [[M-57 (Michigan highway)|M-57]]. About {{convert/spell|6|mi|km}} further north, US&nbsp;27 turned to the northwest, separating from Bagley Road. The expressway transitions back to a full freeway as the trunkline turns north and curves around the east side of [[Ithaca, Michigan|Ithaca]], meeting the southern end of [[U.S. Route 27 Business (Ithaca, Michigan)|Ithaca's business loop]] at Center Road, and the opposite end north of town.<ref name=MDOT02/><ref name=google/>

Further north, US&nbsp;27 angled northwesterly between [[Alma, Michigan|Alma]] and [[St. Louis, Michigan|St. Louis]]. Each city has its own business loop, accessible on the south side through a pair of partial interchanges at Lincoln and State roads. The freeway crosses the [[Pine River (Chippewa River)|Pine River]] before intersecting [[M-46 (Michigan highway)|M-46]] and the two business loops at another pair of interchanges north of downtown Alma. After US&nbsp;27 crossed into [[Isabella County, Michigan|Isabella County]], it turned northwesterly near [[Shepherd, Michigan|Shepherd]]. After a few miles, a short freeway spur carrying the [[U.S. Route 27 Business (Mount Pleasant, Michigan)|BUS US&nbsp;27]] for [[Mount Pleasant, Michigan|Mount Pleasant]] splits off and the main freeway turns back to the north. The two highways continue in parallel through town before turning to converge north of Mount Pleasant by [[Mount Pleasant Municipal Airport (Michigan)|the airport]]. After the freeway stub at the northern end of the business loop merges in, the main freeway crosses the [[Chippewa River (Michigan)|Chippewa River]].<ref name=MDOT02/><ref name=google/>

US&nbsp;27 continued through northern Isabella County to pass east of [[Rosebush, Michigan|Rosebush]]. South of the [[Clare County, Michigan|Clare County]] line in [[Clare, Michigan|Clare]], US&nbsp;27 met the southern end of Clare's [[U.S. Route 27 Business (Clare, Michigan)|BUS US&nbsp;27]]. The freeway turns northeasterly, crosses [[U.S. Route 10 Business (Clare, Michigan)|BUS US&nbsp;10]] and the county line before merging with [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]]. US&nbsp;27/US&nbsp;10 curved around [[Lake Shamrock]] on the northern end of town before meeting the northern end of BUS US&nbsp;27/BUS US&nbsp;10. The freeway continues north, past a [[welcome center]] in the median, and US&nbsp;10 splits off to the west.<ref name=MDOT02/><ref name=google/>

North of Clare, US&nbsp;27 ran through forest, where it passed to the east of [[Harrison, Michigan|Harrison]]. On the east side of that town, the freeway crosses between Little Long and Sutherland lakes before meeting the northern end of the [[U.S. Route 27 Business (Harrison, Michigan)|Harrison business loop]]. The freeway then crosses into [[Roscommon County, Michigan|Roscommon County]]. East of the community of [[Houghton Lake Heights, Michigan|Houghton Lake Heights]] and the city of [[Houghton Lake, Michigan|Houghton Lake]], US&nbsp;27 intersected [[M-55 (Michigan highway)|M-55]]. North of that interchange, the freeway parallels the western shore of [[Houghton Lake (Michigan)|Houghton Lake]] and crosses the [[Muskegon River]]. The freeway then turns a bit northeasterly toward [[Higgins Lake]] and follows that lake's western shore before crossing into [[Crawford County, Michigan|Crawford County]]. Once across the county line, US&nbsp;27 curved around to the northeast for about {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km}} before terminating at [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] south of Grayling.<ref name=MDOT02/><ref name=google/>

==History==

===Predecessor highways===
[[File:Michigan's Indian trails.png|left|thumb|upright| Map of the pre-statehood Indian trails]]
The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trails.<ref name=morrison1>[[#Morrison|Morrison]], p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Only one of these followed part of the path of US&nbsp;27; the [[Mackinac Trail]] roughy paralleled the route of US&nbsp;27 from Grayling north.<ref name=mason18>[[#Mason|Mason]], p.&nbsp;18.</ref>

The [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|State Trunkline Highway System]] was created on May 13, 1913, by an act of the [[Michigan Legislature]]; at the time, no one of the system's divisions corresponded to US&nbsp;27. Division&nbsp;3 followed a course from Lansing northward to an intersection with Division&nbsp;2. Combined with the northernmost sections of Division&nbsp;2 to the Straits of Mackinac, these highways roughly described the future route of US&nbsp;27.<ref name=STLHA>[[#MichLeg|Michigan Legislature]], p.&nbsp;1868</ref> In 1919, the [[Michigan State Highway Department]] (MSHD){{#tag:ref|The Michigan State Highway Department was reorganized into the Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation on August&nbsp;23, 1973.<ref name="MMM27">[[#Kulsea|Kulsea]], p.&nbsp;27.</ref> The name was shortened to its current form in 1978.<ref name="MMM30-1">[[#Kulsea|Kulsea]], pp.&nbsp;30<U+2013>1.</ref>|name=MDOT|group=lower-alpha}} signposted the highway system for the first time,<ref name=press-1919-09-20>{{cite news |title=Michigan May Do Well Following Wisconsin's Road Marking System |work= [[The Grand Rapids Press]] |date= September&nbsp;20, 1919 |page= 10 |oclc= 9975013}}</ref> and two different highways followed sections of the future US&nbsp;27 corridor. The original [[M-29 (Michigan highway)|M-29]] ran from the Indiana state line north to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. The second highway was [[M-14 (Michigan highway)|M-14]] from Lansing north to [[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]].<ref name=MSHD19LP>{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan State Highway Department]] |title= State of Michigan: Lower Peninsula |date= July&nbsp;1, 1919 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref>

===United States Numbered Highways era===
[[File:Old US 27 (MI).jpg|thumb|right|100px|The US&nbsp;27 marker originally used in Michigan]]
On November 11, 1926, the [[United States Numbered Highway System]] was approved by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO),<ref name="USH">{{cite web |url=http://wwwcf.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/numbers.cfm |title= From Names to Numbers: The Origins of the U.S. Numbered Highway System |last= Weingroff |first= Richard F. |work= Highway History |publisher= [[Federal Highway Administration]] |accessdate= April 21, 2009 |date=January 9, 2009}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|AASHO was renamed the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) on November 13, 1973.<ref>{{cite web |author= Staff |date= December 4, 2012 |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byday/fhbd1113.htm |title= November 13 |work= Highway History |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |accessdate= August 18, 2013}}</ref>|name=AASHTO|group=lower-alpha}} and the new US&nbsp;27 replaced M-29 from the state line northward to Lansing; from Lansing northward, US&nbsp;27 replaced M-14 to Cheboygan.<ref name=MSHD26-12>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= Official Highway Service Map |date= December&nbsp;1, 1926 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref> By the end of the next year, [[M-78 (Michigan highway)|M-78]] was extended from Charlotte along US&nbsp;27 to run north and east of Lansing to a junction with [[M-47 (Michigan highway)|M-47]] near [[Pittsburg, Michigan|Pittsburg]].<ref name=MSHD27-12>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= Official Highway Service Map |date= December&nbsp;1, 1927 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref> In 1929, the route of US&nbsp;27/M-18 was realigned south of [[Roscommon, Michigan|Roscommon]] on the east side of [[Higgins Lake]]. The same year, another realignment moved US&nbsp;27 to run due north from the [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton]]<U+2013>[[Gratiot County, Michigan|Gratiot]] county line to [[M-43 (Michigan highway)|M-43]] at [[Ithaca, Michigan|Ithaca]], and a third change rounded a corner near [[Shepherd, Michigan|Shepherd]] in [[Isabella County, Michigan|Isabella County]].<ref name=MSHD29-05>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= Official Highway Service Map |date=May&nbsp;1, 1929 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref><ref name=MSHD30-01>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= Official Highway Service Map |date= January&nbsp;1, 1930 |cartography= [[H.M. Gousha]] }}</ref>

When a new roadway was built in the [[St. Louis, Michigan|St. Louis]] area in 1930, the former routing into [[Alma, Michigan|Alma]] was redesignated US&nbsp;27A; another US&nbsp;27A was created in Shepherd around the same time.<ref name=MSHD30-07>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= Official Highway Service Map |date= July&nbsp;1, 1930 |cartography= H.M.

The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designated as a [[#Truck route|truck route]].<ref name=MSHD36-06L/> By the end of the year, another realignment straightened out a series of turns from the county line northward to [[Wolverine, Michigan|Wolverine]] in [[Cheboygan County, Michigan|Cheboygan County]].<ref name="MSHD36-06">{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= 1936 Official Michigan Highway Map |date= June&nbsp;1, 1936 |cartography= Rand McNally |section= F10 }}</ref><ref name="MSHD36-12">{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= 1936/7 Official Michigan Highway Map |date= December&nbsp;15, 1936 |edition= Winter |cartography= Rand McNally |section=  F10}}</ref> The following year, US&nbsp;27 was extended to follow [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]] between Cheboygan and [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]].

In the latter half of 1940, US&nbsp;23 was rerouted to follow the [[Lake Huron]] shoreline northwest of Alpena; after this change was completed, US&nbsp;27's concurrency with US 23 was shortened to start in downtown Cheboygan instead of south of town.<ref name=MSHD40-07>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= 1940 Official Michigan Highway Map |date= July&nbsp;15, 1940 |edition= Summer |cartography= Rand McNally |section=E10<U+2013>F13 }}</ref><ref name=MSHD40-12>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= 1940 Official Michigan Highway Map |date= December&nbsp;1, 1940 |edition= Winter |cartography= Rand McNally |section= E10<U+2013>F13 }}</ref>

Also by the end of the same year, the highway was shifted to follow a new freeway routing from the southwest of Ithaca to Grayling, bypassing Ithaca, St. Louis, Mount Pleasant, Clare and Harrison. The old route was turned over to local control except through the aforementioned cities where it was reused for business loops. The US&nbsp;27A through Alma was also bypassed by the new freeway, and it was redesignated BUS US&nbsp;27 as well.

A northern freeway bypass of the Lansing area opened in 1984. MDOT rerouted US&nbsp;27 to follow I-96 around the west side of the city and over the new freeway to reconnect with the exiting routing north of Lansing. The former US&nbsp;27 through downtown Lansing was redesignated BUS&nbsp;27 that that time.<ref name=MDOT84>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Official Transportation Map |year= 1984 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:14.5&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;in:23&nbsp;km |section=L11 }}</ref><ref name=MDOT85>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Official Transportation Map |year= 1985 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:14.5&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;in:23&nbsp;km |section= L11 }}</ref> Another segment of freeway opened in 1987 in [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]] between [[U.S. Route 127 in Michigan|US&nbsp;127]] near DeWitt and TEMP I-69 near [[Bath, Michigan|Bath]].<ref name=MDOT87>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Official Transportation Map |year= 1987 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:14.5&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;in:23&nbsp;km |section= L11 |cartography= MDOT}}</ref><ref name=MDOT88>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Department of Transportation Map |year= 1988 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:14.5&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;in:23&nbsp;km |section= L11 |cartography= MDOT }}</ref>

In 1991, MDOT and the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]] petitioned AASHTO to remove the US&nbsp;27 designation from its concurrency with I-69 in the two states; this request was denied by the association's Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering at its October 11, 1991, meeting because it would have resulted in a section of US&nbsp;27 north of Lansing disconnected from the remainder of the highway south of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Tabb |first= John |date= October 11, 1991 |title= Report to the Executive Committee |publisher= Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering, [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] |accessdate= August 25, 2013 |url= http://route.transportation.org/Documents/1991-USRN_Cmte.pdf |format= PDF }}</ref> The final segment of I-69/US&nbsp;27 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing.

A few years later, the statutory definition of the [[Interstate 73|I-73]] corridor was amended in 1995 to have a branch that would encompass the section of US&nbsp;27 north of Lansing. This new Interstate was to follow [[U.S. Route 223|US&nbsp;223]] and US&nbsp;127 between [[Toledo, Ohio]], and Lansing before continuing north to I-75 near Grayling. From Grayling northward, the I-73 corridor was defined to follow I-75 to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste.

Over its history, US&nbsp;27 had several [[business loop]]s associated with it. Since the conversion of the highway into a freeway starting in the 1950s, these business loops served Marshall, Charlotte, Lansing, St. Johns, Ithaca, Alma, St. Louis, Mount Pleasant, Clare and Harrison. The business loops north of Lansing were redesignated as business loops of US&nbsp;127 in 2002 while the Charlotte loop had been reassigned BL I-69 with the completion of I-69 through the area. In addition, Michigan had a US&nbsp;27A designation through Alma and a Truck US&nbsp;27 in Lansing.

'''TRUCK US&nbsp;27''' was a former [[truck route]] through the city of Lansing. It started at the corner of Capitol Avenue and Main Street and ran along Main Street to Grand Avenue. There, it turned north on Grand Avenue to Kalamazoo Street and turned east on Kalamazoo over the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]]. At Larch Street, TRUCK US&nbsp;27 continued north to rejoin the mainline at the corner of Larch and Saginaw streets.<ref name=MSHD50-04L/>

By the middle of 1936, the US&nbsp;27/M-78 routing through Lansing was split into two. The mainline was restricted to cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designated as a truck route.<ref name=MSHD36-06L>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1936 Official Michigan Highway Map |year=June 1, 1936 |cartography= Rand McNally |inset= Lansing}}</ref> In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and mainline US&nbsp;27/M-78 was rerouted to use it to connect to Larch Street. From there north, US&nbsp;27/M-78 followed Larch Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.<ref name=MSHD50-04L>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Michigan Official Highway Map |year=April 15, 1950 |inset= Lansing}}</ref><ref name=MSHD50-07L>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Map |year=July 1, 1950 |inset= Lansing}}</ref>
