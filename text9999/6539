"'''In a Mirror, Darkly'''" is the 18th and 19th episodes of the fourth season of American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', and originally aired on April 22 and 29, 2005. The episode was developed to be a sequel to ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' episode "[[The Tholian Web]]" and a prequel to "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]". The decision to set an ''Enterprise'' episode in the mirror universe originated with a pitch to enable [[William Shatner]] to appear in the series. The teleplays for both parts of the episode were written by [[Mike Sussman (TV series writer/producer)|Mike Sussman]], with [[Manny Coto]] contributing the story for the second part. 

Set in the 22nd century, the series normally follows the adventures of the first [[Starfleet]] starship ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'', registration NX-01. However, these episodes feature a [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|mirror universe]] [[Jonathan Archer]] ([[Scott Bakula]]) and his crew. The mirror universe features evil duplicates of the normal universe characters, who instead of being part of the Federation, they instead serve the Terran Empire. In the first part, the ISS ''Enterprise'' encounters a Starfleet ship from the future of the main universe which is being stripped for parts by the [[Tholian]]s, and seeks to take the ship from the aliens. The second part sees the crew transferred to the USS ''Defiant'' and seeking to takeover Starfleet after dealing with an alien infiltrator.

The episode saw the re-use of footage from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' and the creation of an alternative opening credits sequence which included footage from other [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] properties such as the film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''. A three-quarters around bridge from ''The Original Series'' era was constructed, as well as other sets from a [[Constitution class starship]]. A [[Gorn (Star Trek)|Gorn]] and a Tholian were both created using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], with the Gorn utilising [[motion capture]] techniques. The episode also saw the return of [[Vaughn Armstrong]] after his main universe character was killed on screen earlier in the season in the episode "[[The Forge (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Forge]]". The critical response to the episode was initially mixed, but it subsequently appeared in several lists of the best episodes of ''Star Trek: Enterprise''. It was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Hairstyling For A Series in 2005.

==Plot==
===Part I===
In 2063, a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] ship descends and lands on Earth, making first contact with humans (as previously seen in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''). However instead of peacefully greeting the aliens, [[Zefram Cochrane]] ([[James Cromwell]]) shoots the lead Vulcan and the humans rush onto the ship to loot it. The episode jumps forward to 2155 aboard the ISS ''Enterprise'' as Dr [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Phlox]] ([[John Billingsley]]) and Major [[Malcolm Reed]] ([[Dominic Keating]]) demonstrate the new torture device, the agony booth, to Captain [[Maxwell Forrest|Maximilian Forrest]] ([[Vaughn Armstrong]]) and Commander [[Jonathan Archer]] ([[Scott Bakula]]). Afterwards, Archer suggests to Forrest that travel into [[Tholian]] space, as he has heard rumours of a technology they might wish to steal. The two begin to argue, and Archer only backs down under the threat or torture. Forrest returns to his quarters where he is comforted by [[Hoshi Sato]] ([[Linda Park]]) in her role as the "Captain's woman". When he leaves, he is ambushed by Archer and several marines and sent to the [[brig]]. Archer travels to the bridge and announces over the communications system to the rest of the ship that he has taken command in a [[mutiny]]. He orders a change of course and tells [[T'Pol]] ([[Jolene Blalock]]) to help install a [[cloaking device]] they had captured from the [[Suliban]].

Archer promotes T'Pol to first officer and assigns Sergeant [[Travis Mayweather]] ([[Anthony Montgomery]]) as his personal guard. Hoshi arrives as Mayweather departs, and she proposes that she continues the relationship she had with Forrest but instead with Archer in his new position. The ''Enterprise'' drops out of warp and attacks a Tholian vessel, capturing it's single inhabitant by [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter beam]]. Dr Phlox reveals that under torture the Tholian told of a Terran (the terminology for Humans in the mirror universe) vessel they had captured. When T'Pol and Chief Engineer [[Trip Tucker|Charles Tucker]] attempt to install the cloaking device, it emits an electrical discharge suggesting [[sabotage]]. Archer questions Forrest, who denies all knowledge, and Reed tortures Tucker in the agony booth expecting him to be the saboteur. Archer has Hoshi send a criptic message to Starfleet command about their mission to free the captured Terran vessel.

T'Pol leads a team to successfully free Forrest from the brig, and afterwards takes back the bridge. However, Archer has locked helm controls onto their destination. Forrest subsequently has Archer tortured in the agony booth for ten hours, but orders his release after he received a message from Starfleet who agreed with Archer's plans. Forrest holds a staff briefing where Archer shows images of the captured Terran vessel which he purchased from a freed former slave of the Tholians. It is the USS ''Defiant'' (previously seen in "[[The Tholian Web]]"). Afterwards, Tucker threatens T'Pol after he finds out she used a series of [[Mind meld|mind melds]] to make him sabotage the cloaking device in order to provide a distraction so she could free Forrest. The two successfully install the device and the ship goes under cloak prior to approaching the Tholian shipyard where the ''Defiant'' is located. An assault team including Archer, T'Pol and Tucker transport across to the ''Defiant''. They make their way to the bridge, and Archer orders Tucker to begin powering up the vessel. Four Tholian vessels approach and attack the ''Enterprise'' encasing it in a Tholian web. Forrest orders the crew to abandon ship but remains behind as the ''Enterprise'' is destroyed.

===Part II===
The crew on board the ''Defiant'' have difficulty releasing the docking clamps, and by the time they do, several Tholian ships have created a Tholian web over the opening of the dock to prevent the ship from leaving. T'Pol and Tucker restore power to the weapon systems, and the ship destroys the web and some of the Tholian ships. The ''Defiant'' manoeuvres out of the dock and Archer orders that the escape pods from the ''Enterprise'' be retrieved. Tucker is ordered to restore power to the [[warp drive]] with the help of the former Tholian slaves left on board the ship. After a staff meeting, Archer is angry at T'Pol for her betrayal, who pledges her loyalty to him once more. Hoshi goes to the captain's quarters and finds that Archer has changed into the uniform of the ''Defiant''{{'s}} former captain. The two discuss the ship's records which includes information on themselves from the other universe for the next hundred years. Meanwhile Ensign Kelby ([[Derek Magyar]]) is attacked while in a jefferies tube attempting to fix the warp drive systems. His body is found, and the crew discover after questioning one of the slaves that the assailant is a [[Gorn (Star Trek)|Gorn]] named Slar.

Archer begins to hallucinate that his other universe version is talking to him. He decides to communicate with the Gorn who offers to return some stolen components in return for being able to leave in a [[Shuttlecraft (Star Trek)|shuttlecraft]]. Archer decides to lead an assault team which includes Reed to take on the Gorn. Reed and three marines are killed by a trap left by the Gorn. Archer and the last marine track down the Gorn, and after a fight, the Gorn is killed. With the components retrieved, Tucker is able to repair the warp drive and the ship continues on its way. The ''Defiant'' saves the ISS ''Avenger'' from an attack by four rebel spacecraft. The ''Avenger''{{'s}} commanding officer, Admiral Black ([[Gregory Itzin]]) comes aboard the ''Defiant'' for a tour accompanied by his first officer, [[Soval]] ([[Gary Graham]]). After Black refuses Archer's request for a battlefield commission to Captain, Archer again hallucinates his other universe version. Archer pulls out a phaser and disintegrates Black.

Archer gives a speech to the officers of the ''Defiant'' and ''Avenger'' saying that they should move against Starfleet command using the advanced technology of the ''Defiant''. Soval and T'Pol meet, sharing their fears that Archer will decimate the Vulcans and make a plan to sabotage the ''Defiant''. Archer and Sato discuss his plan to transfer all non-humans off of the ''Defiant'' with the exception of Phlox. The Doctor is summoned to the ''Avenger'' where T'Pol and Soval convince him to join their movement. When T'Pol returns to the ''Defiant'', she is captured by Sato and a team of marines, but Phlox manages to decrease the power settings on board the ''Defiant''. This prompts Soval on the ''Avenger'' to launch an attack against the ''Defiant'', but after Tucker finds Phlox and restores power, the ''Defiant'' destroys the other ship. Sato and Archer celebrate in the captain's quarters. Archer collapses to the floor, discovering too late that Sato has betrayed him and was working with Mayweather, whom she embraces. The ''Defiant'' enters orbit of Earth, and Sato contacts Admiral Gardner ([[John Mahon (actor)|John Mahon]]) and demands Earth's surrender or else the ''Defiant'' will attack. Gardner does not know who she is, and she advises him that he should address her as "Empress Sato".

==Production==
===Writing and filming===
[[image:William Shatner at Comic-Con 2012 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The idea to include the mirror universe in ''Enterprise'' originated from a pitch which would have featured William Shatner.]]
The idea of returning to the mirror universe in ''Enterprise'' was first suggested by [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]]. In "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]", the tantalus field was used on several occasions and was thought to be a [[Disintegrator ray|disintegrator]]. The Reeves-Stevens proposed that it could be explained that instead of killing its victims, the field instead transported them back through time to a [[penal colony]] in the main universe. The ''Enterprise'' would then come across the penal colony, meeting [[James T. Kirk|Tiberius]], portrayed by [[William Shatner]].<ref name=cotoreveal>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michelle Erica|title=Coto, Writers Reveal Mirror Universe Backstory|url=http://www.trektoday.com/news/170305_02.shtml|publisher=[[TrekNation]]|date=March 17, 2005|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}</ref>

Tiberius would seek to use the transporter aboard the ''Enterprise'' to return to his own universe, but discovers that it has not yet diverged from the main universe and does not exist. The episode would then have explored the creation of the mirror universe through actions by Tiberius and Captain Archer. The storyline was pitched by Shatner, who had worked with the Reeves-Stevens on the [[Shatnerverse]] series of ''Star Trek'' novels, to [[Manny Coto]], [[Brannon Braga]] and [[Rick Berman]]. However, Berman had already received a pitch by [[Mike Sussman (TV series writer/producer)|Mike Sussman]] which would have Shatner portray an ancestor of Captain Kirk, who happened to be the chef on the ''Enterprise'' (NX-01). The three pitched the idea to Shatner, but negotiations fell through and terms were not agreed for him to appear on the show.<ref name=cotoreveal/>

===Visual effects and costuming===
The opening sequence featured the re-use of footage from ''Star Trek: First Contact'', where Zefram Cochrane makes first contact with the Vulcans, for which both James Cromwell and [[Cully Fredricksen]] agreed to accept [[Screen Actors Guild]] minimum salaries. [[Herman Zimmerman]] had kept the lower portion of the Vulcan vessel from that scene, and made it available to use for re-shoots.<ref name=commentrynation>{{cite news|last=Green|first=Michelle Erica|title=StarTrek.com Offers Commentary on 'In a Mirror, Darkly"|url=http://www.trektoday.com/news/270405_02.shtml|accessdate=March 15, 2013|newspaper=TrekNation|date=April 27, 2005}}</ref> While ''Enterprise'' was normally shot in digital, the mirror-''First Contact'' scenes were shot on film so that they would match the appearance of the original footage.<ref name=commentrynation/> An alternative opening credits sequence was created, which Sussman credited Coto for. It included footage used in other [[Paramount Pictures]] productions including ''Konovalov'' firing a [[torpedo]] from ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''.<ref name=commentrynation/> Other elements include an atomic explosion, battleships, tanks and fighter jets.<ref name=treknationreview>{{cite news|last=Green|first=Michelle Erica|title=In a Mirror, Darkly|url=http://www.trektoday.com/reviews/enterprise/inamirrordarklypartone.shtml|accessdate=March 15, 2013|newspaper=TrekNation|date=April 23, 2005}}</ref>

Zimmerman led the construction of a full three-quarters around set to represent the bridge of the USS ''Defiant'', which was used from the final day of filming the first part of this episode. It was the first time that a bridge set of that scale from a Constitution-class starship from ''The Original Series'' had been used since the final episode "[[Turnabout Intruder]]" was aired in 1969. Senior illustrator [[Doug Drexler]] was involved in the design; he had previously worked on the research that went into re-creating parts of ''The Original Series'' era [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] for the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]", as well as a set which was exhibited in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in London. Other designers included in the creation of the set were [[Ahna Packard]], [[Mike Okuda]] and [[James Van Over]].<ref name=part1prod/> The actual construction of the set was in the hands of Tom Arp and his team.<ref name=part1prod/> Sussman said of the set, "I think the bridge set is remarkable. I hope fans will be thrilled to see that set again in all of its glory. I feel that it probably looks better than the original in many respects, if you compare them side by side."<ref name=part2prod/>
[[image:WonderCon 2012 - original series Star Trek uniforms.jpg|thumb|right|upright|This episode saw the return of ''Original Series'' style uniforms, with the wraparound green tunic worn by Scott Bakula as Jonathan Archer]]
The bridge of the ''Enterprise'' had previously been recreated twice in ''Star Trek'' series since the end of ''The Original Series''. In the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode "[[Relics (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Relics]]", only the engineering console was reconstructed, with the Captain's chair and the navigation consoles rented from a fan and the remaining consoles were edited in digitally using [[Chroma key|blue screens]].<ref>{{cite web|last=DeCandido|first=Keith|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Rewatch: "Relics"|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/09/star-trek-the-next-generation-qrelicsq|publisher=[[Tor Books{{!}}Tor.com]]|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref> Incomplete sets were also recreated for the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode "Trials and Tribble-ations", but these involved digitally inserting the actors into previous footage of ''The Original Series'' and so a full bridge set was not re-created.<ref>{{cite web|last=Atkinson|first=Torie|coauthor=Myers, Eugene|title=Tribbles Week: Re-watching Deep Space Nine<U+2019>s "Trials and Tribble-ations"|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/04/tribbles-week-lemgdeep-space-9lemgs-trials-and-tribble-ations|publisher=[[Tor Books{{!}}Tor.com]]|date=April 14, 2010|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref>

Further sets for the ''Defiant'' were created for the second part of the episode, which included designs previously used in "Trials and Tribble-ations" for the [[Jefferies tube]]. The other sets included the Rec Room, Captain's quarters and the briefing room. Classic ''Original Series'' style uniforms were worn by some the main cast in the second episode, although as each vessel of that era had a slightly different Starfleet logo, one had to be designed for the Defiant as it hadn't previously been seen on screen.<ref name=part2prod/> Bakula wore the wrap-around green uniform previously worn by Shatner in several episodes including "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]", while Trineer, Keating and Montgomery donned [[Redshirt (character)|red shirts]]. Bakula joked <U+201C>Did we run out of material for Jolene's skirt?<U+201D> as Blalock wore the science-blue miniskirt in the style of that worn by [[Christine Chapel]]. The normal ''Enterprise'' costumes also underwent changes, with those worn by female members of the crew having a portion removed to reveal their midriffs.<ref name=part2prod/>

''Original Series'' props such as phasers and PADDs were also created for the episode.<ref name=part2prod/> Despite the mirror-''Enterprise'' being destroyed in the first episode, during the second episode the standing sets were re-used to represent the USS ''Avenger''.<ref name=part2prod/> Both a Tholian and a Gorn were created in post production using CGI. The Gorn in particular required an actor in a tracking suit to allow the actors to interact with the character and give the animators something to overlay the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] on. Stunt coordinator [[Vince Deadrick, Jnr]] wore the suit for scenes that required movement, while David Anderson wore it for static shots.<ref name=part2prod/> Sussman also wrote biographies for Archer and Hoshi that would briefly appear on screen. Included in these were references to Archer becoming President of the [[Federation (Star Trek)|Federation]] and that a planet called Archer IV that had previously appeared in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' was in fact named after him.<ref name=sussmaninterview />

===Casting===
[[image:Vaughn Armstrong.JPG|thumb|right|upright|"In a Mirror, Darkly" saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong to ''Enterprise'' as the mirror universe version of his previous character]]
The episode saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong as Captain Maximilian Forest. His main universe character, Rear Admiral Maxwell Forest had been killed earlier in the season in the episode "[[The Forge (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Forge]]". Both Bakula and Armstrong joked about the character suffering two deaths during the same season, although Armstrong also said of the relationship between mirror-Forrest and mirror-Hoshi that "In 25 years [of acting], I haven't gotten the girl, but I come back here and I get the girl! This is great."<ref name=part1prod/> Gary Graham returned as the Vulcan Soval, who was a science officer aboard the Avenger in the mirror universe rather than his normal position of the Vulcan Ambassador. Graham was given a goatee beard in reference to the mirror universe [[Spock]] from "Mirror, Mirror".<ref name=part2prod/>

Other guest stars in "In a Mirror, Darkly" included Gregory Itzin, who had previously appeared as a Vulcan commando in "[[Shadows of P'Jem]]" as well as episodes of ''Star Trek: Voyager'' and ''Deep Space Nine''. Derek Magyar returned for his third appearance as Kelby after previously appearing in "[[Affliction (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Affliction]]" and "[[Bound (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Bound]]". Writer Mike Sussman also appeared on screen, as one of the dead ''Defiant'' crew-members.<ref name=part2prod/> With this episode, actress [[Majel Barrett]], widow of ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], became the only actor to participate in every ''Star Trek'' series, including the Animated Series, as well as both the ''Original Series''-based and ''Next Generation''-based film series.

The episodes saw significant changes to the characters of the main cast. Linda Park, who plays Hoshi Sato in the series, later said that they were her favourite episodes of the show. She later explained that "Mirror Hoshi was strong in the way that [[Medea]] is strong, in the way that [[Clytemnestra]] is strong, in this very archetypal, warrior-woman way."<ref name=parkinterview>{{cite web|title=Linda Park Interview|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/linda-park-interview|publisher=Star Trek.com|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref> She credited the role she played in this episode as demonstrating that she could play a tougher character, something which allowed her to gain other roles once the series ended.<ref name=parkinterview/>

===Critical response===
David Bianculli at the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' thought that "In a Mirror, Darkly" was the best episode of ''Enterprise'' so far and enjoyed that the actors could play against type for their characters. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four and said that the episode was so much fun that "had they adopted this attitude from the start, "Enterprise" probably would still be flying missions next season."<ref>{{cite news|last=Bianculli|first=David|title='Star Trek': The final frontier|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/302351p-258821c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050507030809/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/302351p-258821c.html|archivedate=May 7, 2005|accessdate=March 16, 2013|newspaper=Daily News|date=April 22, 2005}}</ref> When reviewing the first part of the episode for [[TrekNation]], Michelle Erica Green said that her favourite part of the episode was the modified opening sequence, and described it as "fun and lighthearted in a twisted sort of way" but thought that the closing episodes of the series would have been better if they had concentrated on the real crew and ship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michelle Erica|title=In a Mirror, Darkly|url=http://www.trektoday.com/reviews/enterprise/inamirrordarklypartone.shtml|publisher=TrekNation|date=April 23, 2005|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref> She thought that the second episode saw the series "stretching a clever idea too thin",<ref name=greenreview2>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michelle Erica|title=In a Mirror, Darkly Part Two|url=http://www.trektoday.com/reviews/enterprise/inamirrordarklyparttwo.shtml|publisher=TrekNation|date=May 1, 2005|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref> and that a "one-hour 'Mirror' would have made more sense in terms of the pacing and for Enterprise as a whole."<ref name=greenreview2/> 

Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website "Jammer's Reviews" gave the first episode a score of three out of four,<ref name=jammer1>{{cite web|last=Epsicokhan|first=Jamahl|title=Star Trek: Enterprise "In a Mirror, Darkly, Part I"|url=http://www.jammersreviews.com/st-ent/s4/mirror1.php|publisher=Jammer's Reviews|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref> and the second part a score of two and a half.<ref name=jammer2>{{cite web|last=Epsicokhan|first=Jamahl|title=Star Trek: Enterprise "In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II"|url=http://www.jammersreviews.com/st-ent/s4/mirror2.php|publisher=Jammer's Reviews|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref> He described it as an "evil comic book",<ref name=jammer1/> and regarding the first part, "To call this episode over-the-top would be an understatement. This is a go-for-broke hour of lunatic madness."<ref name=jammer1/> His view on the second part was that while the re-created sets were impressive, but "it goes so far over the top that it comes back around and kicks itself in its own ass. It's overplayed, overacted, and over-goofy."<ref name=jammer2/>

"In a Mirror, Darkly" has been featured in several "Best of" episode lists. In 2009, it was ranked the best episode of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' by James Hunt at the website ''[[Den of Geek]]''.<ref name=geektop10>{{cite news|last=Hunt|first=James|title=Top 10 Star Trek: Enterprise episodes|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek/20237/top-10-star-trek-enterprise-episodes|accessdate=March 16, 2013|newspaper=Den of Geek|date=November 4, 2009}}</ref> He said that "although the novelty value of seeing the cast playing cartoonishly evil versions of themselves is a good enough reason to watch this 2-parter, In a Mirror, Darkly manages to include some of ''Enterprise''{{'s}} most inventive moments, not least the revised opening credits".<ref name=geektop10/> ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked it the second best episode behind another final season episode, "[[Terra Prime]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=Star Trek: The Best And Worst Episodes: Enterprise|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/best-and-worst-star-trek-episodes/5.asp|accessdate=March 16, 2013|newspaper=Empire}}</ref> Jay Garmon at [[TechRepublic]] ranked it as the fifth best episode, saying that the writers managed to include a "gleefully malicious and fatal series of unexpected double-crosses, but also work in some of the most satisfying and coherent mythology gags that ''Enterprise'' ever displayed".<ref>{{cite web|last=Garmon|first=Jay|title=The five best Star Trek: Enterprise episodes of all time!|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/geekend/the-five-best-star-trek-enterprise-episodes-of-all-time/9800|publisher=TechRepublic|date=July 12, 2012|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref>
