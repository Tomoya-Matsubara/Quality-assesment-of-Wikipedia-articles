'''USS Cockrill (DE-398)''' was an [[Edsall-class]] [[destroyer escort]] built for the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She served in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] and provided destroyer escort protection against [[submarine]] and air attack for Navy vessels and [[convoys]]. 

She was named in honor of ensign Dan Robertson Cockrill who died after his ship was torpedoed. She was launched [[29 October]] [[1943]] by [[Brown Shipbuilding]] Co., [[Houston, Texas]]; sponsored by Mrs. Cockrill, mother of ''Lieutenant Cockrill''; commissioned [[24 December]] [[1943]], Lieutenant Commander S. Farnham in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

== World War II North Atlantic operations==
 
''Cockrill'' cleared [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[23 February]] [[1944]] on [[convoy]] escort duty for [[Casablanca]], returning to [[New York]] [[5 April]]. After training and repairs, she conducted various operations off the east coast until [[24 July]], when she cleared Norfolk for a convoy to [[Bizerte]] returning to New York [[7 September]]. Coastwise escort duty and training at [[Bermuda]] followed until [[4 December]], when she put to sea for a [[submarine]] search in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. She voyaged to Bermudan waters [[26 December]]-[[16 January]] [[1945]] for operational training with [[USS Bogue (CVE-9)]] and an escort unit, and then took part in carrier qualification training in [[Narragansett Bay]] and training at [[Casco Bay]].

== Sinking of German Submarine U-546 ==
 
From [[11 April]] to [[11 May]] [[1945]] ''Cockrill'' was on an [[antisubmarine]] patrol, with the Bogue group. Taking station in a barrier of carrier groups in position from [[Greenland]] to the ''Carolinas'' against the known presence of a large number of [[U-boats]], ''Cockrill'' participated [[24 April]] in the attack on [[U-546]], which was forced to the surface and scuttled by its crew.

== Transfer to the Pacific Ocean ==
 
''Cockrill'' sailed from New York [[19 May]] for [[Charleston, South Carolina]], [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]], the [[Panama Canal]], and [[San Diego, California]], arriving [[14 July]]. Two days later she cleared for [[Pearl Harbor]], for training until [[20 August]], when she sailed for [[Saipan]] arriving [[30 August]]. Assigned to convoy escort duty, she operated from [[Saipan]] and [[Guam]] to [[Okinawa]] and Japanese ports in support of the occupation. She continued training out of Guam from [[14 November]] [[1945]] to [[11 January]] [[1946]] then sailed to call at [[San Pedro, California]], before continuing to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], arriving [[26 February]].

== Post-War Deactivation and Decommissioning ==

After coastwise operations, ''Cockrill'' reported to the Reserve Fleet at [[Green Cove Springs, Florida]], where she was decommissioned [[21 June]] [[1946]]. On [[1 August]] [[1973]] she was struck from the [[Navy list]] and, on [[19 November]] [[1974]], she was sunk as target off [[Florida]].
