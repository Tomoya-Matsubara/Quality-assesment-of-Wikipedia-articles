The '''2011 Korean Grand Prix''', formally the '''2011 Formula 1 Korean Grand Prix''' was a [[Formula One]] [[Auto racing|motor race]] that was held on 16 October 2011 at the [[Korea International Circuit]] in [[Yeongam]], [[Jeollanam-do|South Jeolla]], [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2010/Pages/wmsc_031110.aspx|title=World Motor Sport Council: 03/11/2010|work=fia.com|publisher=[[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]|date=3 November 2010|accessdate=21 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110622005933/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2010/Pages/wmsc_031110.aspx| archivedate= 22 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It was the sixteenth round of the [[2011 Formula One season]], the second running of the [[Korean Grand Prix]], and the first race after [[Sebastian Vettel]] claimed the {{F1|2011}} [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]].

The race, contested over 55&nbsp;laps, was won by Vettel, after starting from second on the grid. [[Lewis Hamilton]] finished in second place for [[McLaren]], and [[Mark Webber]] completed the podium in third position.<ref name="Race">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/formula_one/15326210.stm|title=Sebastian Vettel wins Korean Grand Prix from Lewis Hamilton|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=16 October 2011|accessdate=16 October 2011|first=Sarah|last=Holt}}</ref> As a consequence of the race, podium finishes for both Vettel and Webber ensured that [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] defended their [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|World Constructors' Championship]] title, extending their lead to 140&nbsp;points over McLaren, with only 129 points available at the final three races.

Polesitter Hamilton broke Red Bull's streak of pole positions, which had started at the [[2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]], and continued for another 15 races. Prior to this race, the last time Red Bull failed to take pole was at the [[2010 Brazilian Grand Prix]], when [[Nico H<U+00FC>lkenberg]], driving for [[Williams F1|Williams]], was the polesitter.

With [[Sebastian Vettel]] clinching the {{F1|2011}} championship title at the {{F1 GP|2011|Japanese}}, four drivers remained in contention for the runner-up position behind Vettel. [[Jenson Button]], the winner in Japan, held an eight-point lead over [[Fernando Alonso]], with [[Mark Webber]] a further eight points behind, and [[Lewis Hamilton]] another sixteen back in fifth place. [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] entered the race weekend with the opportunity of winning the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]] for the second consecutive season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/12102011/2/formula-statistics-korean-gp.html|title=Formula One statistics for Korean GP|work=[[Yahoo!]] [[Eurosport]]|publisher=[[TF1 Group]]|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref>

With the World Drivers' Championship settled in Japan, [[Pirelli]] promised an "aggressive" tyre selection for the final four races of the season, with motorsport director Paul Hembery predicting four-stop strategies throughout the race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/95287|title=Pirelli promises Korean GP tyre choice will give teams a challenge|first1=Jonathan|last1=Noble|first2=Matt|last2=Beer|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>

Tyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the harder "prime" tyre and the red-banded super-soft compound as the softer "option" compound, as opposed to the previous year where Bridgestone brought the silver-banded hard compound as the prime.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pirelli announce tyre choices for remaining races|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2011/10/12604.html|work=Formula1.com|publisher=[[Formula One Group]]|date=7 October 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>

A single DRS (Drag Reduction System) Zone was used in the Korean race. The detection point was located 30m after the first turn, while the DRS activation point was halfway (516m after turn 2) in between turn 2 and 3, down the long straight. Hence, the DRS was used for maximising top speed rather than acceleration.<ref>{{cite news|title=Short DRS zone for Korean Grand Prix|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2011/10/13/short-drs-zone-korean-grand-prix/|first=Keith|last=Collantine|work=F1 Fanatic|publisher=Keith Collantine|date=13 October 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>

Following a collision between [[Jaime Alguersuari]] and [[Nico Rosberg]] during the second free practice session in which Rosberg made contact with Alguersuari as the Toro Rosso driver emerged from the pit lane, a system of warning lights was installed on the approach to the first turn.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/95358|title=F1 drivers to be warned with lights about rivals exiting the pits in Korea|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=14 October 2011|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> Following the accident, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] drivers [[Fernando Alonso]] and [[Felipe Massa]] called for the pit exit to be reconfigured in future so as to prevent similar incidents from occurring.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/95342|title=Korea Friday quotes: Ferrari|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=14 October 2011|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> [[Nico Rosberg]] and [[Jenson Button]] almost had a collision coming out of the pit lane. It involved the two cars sharing the pit lane to get out in one piece. Rosberg managed to get out first but was overtaken by Button. Button was then taken over by Rosberg again.

The Grand Prix was the 700th in which the [[McLaren]] team competed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mclaren.com/page/700-and-counting-mclaren-celebrates-gp-milestone-in-korea|title=700 and counting!

===Qualifying===
[[Lewis Hamilton]] stopped Red Bull's run of 16 consecutive pole positions by setting the fastest time in Saturday's qualifying session. It was his first pole since the [[2010 Canadian Grand Prix]]. [[Sebastian Vettel]] was still on the front row of the grid because his final flying lap was not good enough to beat Hamilton's time but still left him in second position. [[Jenson Button]] was three tenths slower than teammate Hamilton, but only a tenth slower than Vettel. The second Red Bull of [[Mark Webber]] lined up fourth, in front of the two Ferraris, where [[Felipe Massa]] had out-qualified [[Fernando Alonso]] for the fourth time in six races. [[Nico Rosberg]], [[Vitaly Petrov]] and the [[Force India]]s of [[Paul di Resta]] and [[Adrian Sutil]] completed the top ten, after all making the third part of qualifying. [[Jaime Alguersuari]] and [[Sebastien Buemi]] did well to qualify an unusually high eleventh and thirteenth for the [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] team. The [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] of [[Michael Schumacher]] was only twelfth, in between them. [[Kamui Kobayashi]], [[Bruno Senna]], [[Pastor Maldonado]] and [[Sergio P<U+00E9>rez]] were the other drivers who made it into Q2, filling spaces 14 to 17 on the grid in that order. This meant that [[Rubens Barrichello]] could not qualify higher than eighteenth. The three new teams completed the back of the grid; [[Heikki Kovalainen]] out-qualified [[Jarno Trulli]] at [[Team Lotus (2010<U+2013>11)|Lotus]], [[Timo Glock]] was faster than [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me d'Ambrosio]] at [[Virgin Racing|Virgin]] and [[Daniel Ricciardo]] failed to set a lap time due to electrical problems, but would be allowed start twenty-fourth and behind [[HRT F1|HRT]] teammate, [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]].

===Race===

The race started with contact at the back, between a Sauber and the Toro Rosso of S<U+00E9>bastien Buemi. Vettel positioned his car behind Hamilton to pick up the slipstream from his car, in order to move close enough to make a passing manoeuvre, and passed Hamilton for the lead at Turn 4. In the meantime, Massa had moved up to third position, passing both Webber and Button. Into turn 4, Button tried to pass Massa around the outside of the turn, but both drivers were delayed enough to allow Webber to pass them both, and Alonso further displaced Button through turn 6. At the end of the lap, Liuzzi was forced to pit, to replace a damaged front wing. On lap 14, there was a pit stop battle between Button and Rosberg. They entered the pits, Button ahead, and Rosberg emerged from his box ahead of Button, after a quicker pit stop. When the pair exited the pits, Rosberg braked too late, and Button passed him. Rosberg then deployed his [[Drag Reduction System|DRS]], and would pass Button again, before Button reversed the move the following lap.

On lap 17, there was a crash between Petrov and Schumacher, causing both cars to retire with damage, and the safety car to be deployed. Petrov and Alonso had been battling over track position on the straight, but both missed the braking zone, and Petrov rammed into the back of Schumacher, damaging Schumacher's rear wing. Petrov was later given a five-place grid penalty for the {{F1 GP|2011|Indian}}, for causing an avoidable collision. The safety car came in on lap 20, where Vettel extended his lead once again. On lap 27, Rosberg was defending fifth place, from Massa and Alonso, but Rosberg missed his braking point and lost track position to them both. Pastor Maldonado was given a drive-through penalty for entering the pit lane too fast, and later retired due to a clutch problem. On lap 33, the battle for second place between Hamilton and Webber saw both drivers pit, with Hamilton returning to the track ahead. Webber dived up the inside of Hamilton to take second place at Turn 6. Hamilton continued alongside Webber on the run to the next corner, and Webber had to yield, thus handing the place back to Hamilton.

Later in the race Ferrari pitted Massa, but Alonso decided to stay out, consequently leading the race for a few laps. This worked out best for Alonso, because Massa was held up in traffic, and Alonso was not. Later on, after Alonso had pitted, Alonso was closing in on the cars ahead. He caught up with only a few laps to spare, setting a fastest lap on the way. Alonso then came on the radio saying "I give up. I give up." It was later revealed that he meant he had arrived too late, and there was nothing he could do, so he kept fifth. Vettel took his tenth victory of the season, ahead of Hamilton <U+2013> who took his first podium since the {{F1 GP|2011|German}} <U+2013> and Webber, the latter's result ensuring that [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] became {{F1|2011}} Constructors' World Champion with three races remaining. Button was fourth, and Alonso finished fifth, followed by Massa, Alguersuari, Rosberg, Buemi and di Resta, who completed the points scoring positions.
