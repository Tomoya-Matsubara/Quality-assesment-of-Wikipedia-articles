'''Lisa del Giocondo''' ([[June 15]] [[1479]] &ndash; [[July 15]] [[1542]] or c. [[1551]]), born and also known as '''Lisa Gherardini''', '''Lisa di Antonio Maria (Antonmaria) Gherardini''' and '''Elisabetta Gherardini''', also known as '''Lisa del Gioconda''', was a member of the Gherardini family of [[Florence]] and [[Tuscany]] in [[Italy]]. Her name was given to ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', her [[portrait painting|portrait]] commissioned by her husband and painted by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]].

Little is known about Lisa's life. Married as a teenager to a cloth and silk merchant who later became a local official, she was mother to five children and led what is thought to have been a comfortable and ordinary middle-class life. Lisa outlived her husband,   who was about 20 years her senior.

Centuries after Lisa's death, ''Mona Lisa'' became the world's most famous painting<ref>{{cite news|author=Riding, Alan|title=In Louvre, New Room With View of 'Mona Lisa'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/06/arts/design/06lisa.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=[[April 6]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> and took on a life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made the work of art a globally-recognized [[icon]] and an object of commercialization. During the early 21st century, a discovery made at a university library was powerful enough evidence to end speculation about the sitter's identity, and reunited Lisa's portrait with her person.

==Life and family==
[[Image:Leonardo design attributed.jpg|thumb|left|Another view of Lisa in a cartoon for ''Mona Lisa'' attributed to Leonardo]]
Lisa was the daughter of Antonmaria di Noldo Gherardini and Lisa di Giovanni Filippo de Carducci, who married in 1466 and lived on farm income. The family lived in Florence, originally near [[Santa Trinita]] and later in rented space near [[Santo Spirito, Florence|Santo Spirito]], most likely because they could not afford repairs to their former house when it was damaged. They also owned a small country home in St. Donato in the village of Poggio about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} south of the city.<ref name=Z4>Z<U+00F6>llner 1993, p. 4</ref>

On [[March 5]], [[1495]], Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo (1460<U+2013>1528 or c. 1539<ref name=Z4 />), a modestly successful [[textile|cloth]] and [[silk]] merchant, becoming his third wife at age 15. Francesco's first two wives, Camilla di Mariotto Rucellai whom he married in 1491 and Tommasa di Mariotto Villani whom he married in 1493, both may have died in childbirth. Lisa's dowry was 170 [[Italian coin florin|florins]] and land near her family's country home, a sign that the Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and reason to think she and her husband loved each other. Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her [[social status]] because her husband's family may have been richer than her own.<ref name=Z5>Z<U+00F6>llner 1993, p. 5</ref> Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an "old name".<ref name=Kemp />

[[Image:Del Giocondo-Gherardini-Firenze-map.jpg|thumb|Central Florence. Francesco and Lisa lived on Via della Stufa (red), about {{convert|.5|mi|km|0}} north of the [[Arno River]]. Lisa's parents lived closer to the river, at first north and later south (purple).]]
Lisa and Francesco had five children: Piero, Camilla, Andrea, Giocondo and Marietta, four of them between 1496 and 1507.<ref name=Johnston>{{cite news|author=Johnston, Bruce|title= Riddle of Mona Lisa is finally solved: she was the mother of five|work=Telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/08/01/wmona01.xml&sSheet=/news/2004/08/01/ixworld.html|date=[[January 1]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> One of their daughters died in 1499 and was buried in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella|Basilica di Santa Maria Novella]].<ref name=M154>M<U+00FC>ntz 1898, p. 154</ref> Lisa's stepmother Caterina di Mariotto Rucellai and Francesco's first wife, both members of the prominent Rucellai family, were sisters. Lisa and her new family lived in shared accommodation until [[March 5]], [[1503]], when Francesco was able to buy a house next door to his family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226503&CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226503&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500816&bmUID=1155229237450&bmLocale=en|publisher=Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref><ref name=Z9>Z<U+00F6>llner 1993, p. 9</ref>

Francesco became an official in Florence. He was elected to the ''[[Signoria of Florence|Dodici Buonomini]]'' in 1499 and to the [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]] in 1512, where he was confirmed as a ''Priori'' in 1524. He may have had ties to [[Medici]] family political or business interests. In 1512 when the government of Florence feared the return of the Medici from exile, Francesco was imprisoned and fined 1,000 florins. He was released in September when the Medici returned.<ref name=Masters>{{cite book|author=Masters, Roger D.|title=Fortune is a River: Leonardo da Vinci and Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli's Magnificant Dream of Changing the Course of Florentine History (online notes for Chapter 6)|publisher=Free Press via Dartmouth College (dartmouth.edu)|date=[[June 15]] [[1998]]|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rmasters/fourtune/notes/06.html|isbn=0-6848-4452-4}}</ref><ref name=M154 />

In one account by an amateur scholar, Francesco died in the plague of 1528. Lisa fell ill and was taken by her daughter Marietta, a [[nun]], to the convent of Sant'Orsola, where she died about four years later at the age of 63.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lorenzi, Rossella|title=Mona Lisa Grave Found, Claims Scholar|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/01/19/monalisa_his.html?category=history&guid=20070119134500|work=Discovery Channel News|publisher=|Discovery Communications|date=[[January 19]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref><ref name=Lorenzi>{{cite news|author=Lorenzi, Rossella|title=Mona Lisa's Identity Revealed?|work=Discovery Channel News|publisher=Discovery Communications|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/05/02/monalisa_arc.html?category=archaeology&guid=20070502143030|date=[[May 2]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> In a scholarly account of their lives, Francesco lived to be 80 years old.

Like other Florentines of their financial means, Francesco's family were art lovers and patrons. His son Bartolommeo asked Antonio di Donnino Mazzieri to paint a fresco at the family's burial site in the [[Santissima Annunziata, Florence|Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze]]. [[Andrea del Sarto]] painted a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for another member of his family.<ref name=M154 /> Francesco gave commissions to Leonardo for a portrait of his wife and to [[Domenico Puligo]] for a painting of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]]. He is thought to have commissioned Lisa's portrait to celebrate both Andrea's birth and the purchase of the family's home.<ref name=Z9 />

''Mona Lisa'' fulfilled 15th- and early 16th-century requirements for portraying a woman of virtue. The position of Lisa's right hand, which rests over her left, signals that she was a faithful wife. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Her dark garments and black veil were a Spanish-influenced high fashion style; they are not a depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is also strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.<ref name=Z12>Z<U+00F6>llner 1993, p. 12</ref>

[[Image:Mona_Lisa_stolen-1911.jpg|thumb|The theft of the ''Mona Lisa'' from the Louvre in 1911 and its travels to Asia and North America during the 1960s and 1970s contributed to the painting's [[icon|iconization]] and fame.<ref>Sassoon 2001, p. 14<U+2013>16</ref>]]
Leonardo had no income during the spring of 1503, which may in part explain his interest in a private portrait.<ref name=Z7>Z<U+00F6>llner 1993, p. 7</ref><ref name=Masters /> But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on ''Mona Lisa'' when he received payment for starting the ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February 1505.<ref name=M136>M<U+00FC>ntz 1898, p. 136</ref> In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished.<ref name=Clark /> He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client.<ref name=Z6>Z<U+00F6>llner 1993, p. 6</ref> The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life and he may have completed ''Mona Lisa'' many years later in France,<ref name=Kemp /> in one estimation by 1516.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Mona Lisa 1503-16|url=http://www.universalleonardo.org/work.php?id=197|date=|publisher=University of the Arts, London|accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref>
