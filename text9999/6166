'''Hurricane Georges''' was the seventh tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the [[1998 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The [[tropical cyclone]] made seven landfalls on its long track through the [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] during September, becoming the second most destructive storm of the season.  Georges killed 603 people, mainly on the island of [[Hispaniola]], and caused nearly $6 billion (1998 [[US dollars]], $7 billion 2006 USD) in damages, mostly in [[Puerto Rico]] and Hispaniola.

The hurricane affected at least six different countries ([[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[Haiti]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Cuba]], and the [[United States]]) &mdash; more than any other hurricane since [[Hurricane Inez]] of the [[1966 Atlantic hurricane season|1966 season]]<!-- 32 years??? This needs a source.-->, and more than any other hurricane until [[Hurricane Wilma]] in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]] affected ten different countries.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref>

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Georges 1998 track.png}}
A tropical wave exited the coast of [[Africa]] on [[September 13]]. Moving westward, the large system quickly developed a closed circulation, and was classified Tropical Depression Seven on the 15th. A strong upper-level ridge forced the depression to the west-northwest, where warm water temperatures allowed it to strengthen to a tropical storm on the 16th. Georges's circulation developed strong banding features around a well-organized [[tropical cyclone#Structure and classification|Central Dense Overcast]], and with the aid of a developing anti-cyclone, Georges attained hurricane status late on [[September 17]].<ref name="tcr"/>

[[Image:Hurricane Georges on September 19th.gif|thumb|right|Georges as a Category 3 hurricane]]

Conditions became nearly ideal for continued development, including warm water temperatures, low-level inflow to the hurricane's north, and good upper-level outflow. A banding eye developed, and Georges reached major hurricane strength on [[September 19]] while 675&nbsp;[[mile]]s (1085&nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]]) east-southeast of [[Antigua]]. Rapid intensification continued, and Georges peaked at 155&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]] (250&nbsp;[[km/h]]) on the 20th. Shortly after peaking, upper-level wind shear from the development of an upper-level low weakened the hurricane as it approached the [[Leeward Islands]]. <ref name="tcr"/>

[[Image:Hurricane Georges 28 sept 1998 2043Z.jpg|right|thumb|Georges making landfall in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]]]

On [[September 21]], Georges made landfall directly on [[Antigua]] and [[St. Kitts]], though its wide windfield affected many other islands. After weakening to a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2 hurricane]] over the [[Caribbean Sea]], upper-level shear decreased, and Georges strengthened again before making landfall near [[Fajardo, Puerto Rico]] as a 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) hurricane. Over the mountainous terrain of the island, the hurricane weakened to a Category 2 storm again, but over the [[Mona Passage]] it again re-intensified to hit eastern [[Dominican Republic]] with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) on the 22nd. Like in [[Puerto Rico]], Georges was greatly weakened by the mountainous terrain, and after crossing the [[Windward Passage]], it struck 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km) east of [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]] on the 23rd. Well-defined upper-level outflow allowed the hurricane to remain well organized, and while paralleling the northern coastline of the island Georges retained minimal hurricane status.<ref name="tcr"/>

Hurricane Georges reached the [[Straits of Florida]] on [[September 24]], and as it had done earlier in its lifetime, quickly restrengthened to Category 2 status on the 25th due to warm water temperatures and little upper-level shear. It continued to the west-northwest, and struck [[Key West]] later on the 25th with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h). Despite moving over warmer water, Georges only managed to peak at 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) in the Gulf of Mexico, likely due to its disrupted inner core. A mid-tropospheric anticyclone pushed the hurricane slowly north-northwestward, forcing Georges to make its 7th and final landfall near [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] on the 28th. Within 24 hours, Georges had weakened to a tropical depression, and due to weak steering currents the storm looped over southern [[Mississippi]], then drifted to the east. The weak circulation moved eastward over the interior of the [[Florida Panhandle]], and dissipated on [[October 1]] near the [[Florida]]/[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] border.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
In the days prior to the hurricane's arrival, thousands of citizens in [[Puerto Rico]] prepared for the major hurricane by boarding windows and purchasing supplies. Puerto Rican governor [[Pedro Rossell<U+00F3>]] activated the island's National Guard, opened 416&nbsp;shelters, and enacted a temporary prohibition on alcohol sales. More than 28,000&nbsp;people across the island evacuated their homes to the shelters in the northern portion of the island. Both [[FEMA]] and the [[American Red Cross]] deployed workers there with supplies for a potentially deadly event.<ref name="puertoprep">[http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9809/21/hurricane.georges.01/ Puerto Rico Preparations]</ref><ref name="puertorico">[http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/03a244915646dfc9c1256689004cd2ad?OpenDocument Puerto Rico Preparations II]</ref> The National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings for the island 37&nbsp;hours prior to Hurricane Georges's landfall.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref>

Due to initial forecasts of the hurricane brushing the northern portion of the country, the [[Dominican Republic]] was caught off guard. Instead, like in Puerto Rico, Georges traversed the entire country, and passed close to [[Santo Domingo]]. Neighboring [[Haiti]] expected the worst, opening shelters and evacuating vulnerable people from low-lying coastal areas.<ref name="hisprep">[http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9809/22/georges.04/index.html Preparation in Hispaniola]</ref> 

Prior to making landfall, more than 200,000&nbsp;people were evacuated from coastal areas in eastern [[Cuba]]. In the potentially impacted area, Cuba's revolutionary army was sent to farm lands to harvest crops that could be destroyed during the storm. Members of the Cuban government travelled door-to-door to alert everyone of the hurricane. In addition to this, President [[Fidel Castro]] spoke live on national television to explain the country's plans to withstand the hurricane, as well as ensuring a quick recovery effort by using all of the nation's resources.<ref name="cubaprep">[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43/105.html Preparation in Cuba]</ref> The Cuban Government issued Hurricane Warnings 30<U+00BD>&nbsp;hours prior to landfall.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref>

Initial forecasts of a southeastern [[Florida]] landfall forced over 1.2&nbsp;million to evacuate, including much of the [[Florida Keys]]. Despite the mandatory evacuation order, 20,000&nbsp;people, including over 7,000&nbsp;[[Key West]] citizens, refused to leave. Some of those who remained to ride out the storm were shrimpers, whose boats were their entire livelihood. Insurance companies refused to insure some of the older shrimp boats, leading shrimpers to ride it out with all they had left.<ref name="keys">[http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9809/25/georges.05/ Florida Keys Impact]</ref> Due to lack of law enforcement, those who stayed in Key West went through red lights, double-parked, and disobeyed traffic laws. Long-time Florida Keys citizens noted the solitude of the time and enjoyed the island for how it once was, rather than the large crowds of tourists.<ref name="keyss">[http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9809/24/georges.04/index.html Florida Keys Impact II]</ref>

In the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], Georges was forecast to attain major hurricane status and make landfall in southeastern [[Louisiana]]. Because of this, portions of the state were evacuated, including [[New Orleans]]. There, the [[Louisiana Superdome]] was, for the first time in its history, used as a refuge of last resort for those unable to evacuate New Orleans. More than 14,000&nbsp;citizens rode out the storm in the facility, causing difficulties to supply necessities. The building had no problems related to the weather, though evacuees looted the building, stole furniture, and damaged property. However, the damage was much less than in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.<ref name="super">[[Louisiana Superdome|Damage to Louisiana Superdome]]</ref> Many citizens in southern [[Mississippi]] were told to leave due to a mandatory or recommended evacuation. Of those in the evacuation area, 60% actually left. Most of those who stayed remained because they believed their house was safe enough for the storm. Of those who left, most went to a relative's house in their own county.<ref name="storn">[http://www.floridadisaster.org/bpr/Response/Plans/Nathaz/hurricanes/georges.pdf Before and After Effects]</ref> Prior to making landfall, Georges's track was very uncertain. This forced for the mandatory evacuations of [[Alabama]]'s two coastal counties, [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] and [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]] Counties, with a combined population of over 500,000&nbsp;people.<ref name="carib">[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/huricane/1998/wgrgedmg.htm Overall Impact]</ref> Despite the order, only 67% of the area actually left to a safer place. Most of those who remained stayed because they believed their house would be able to withstand the hurricane. The majority of those who did leave went to a relative's house in a safer portion of the state.<ref name="storn">[http://www.floridadisaster.org/bpr/Response/Plans/Nathaz/hurricanes/georges.pdf Before and After Effects]</ref> In the days before making landfall, only 22% of the population in recommended evacuation areas along the [[Florida Panhandle]] actually left. However, most of them were prepared to leave if the situation became worse. Those who did leave were concerned about the severity of the storm, while those who stayed felt their home was safe enough for the hurricane's effects. Floridians who evacuated typically left for a friend or relative's house, and only went to another area of their county.<ref name="storn">[http://www.floridadisaster.org/bpr/Response/Plans/Nathaz/hurricanes/georges.pdf Before and After Effects]</ref> <!-- Is it ''really'' necessary to include all of these three states separately when they all say the same thing? I don't know how to rewrite it though.-->

A long-lasting hurricane, Hurricane Georges brought torrential rainfall and mudslides along much of its path through the [[Greater Antilles]]. In all, the hurricane caused $5.9 billion (1998 [[USD]], $6.9 billion 2006 USD)) in damage to the [[United States]] and its possessions, and resulted in 603 fatalities. In the two months after Georges's final landfall, the American [[Red Cross]] spent $104 million (1998 USD, $120 million 2005 USD) on relief aid through [[Puerto Rico]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]], and [[Mississippi]], making Georges the costliest disaster aid in the program's 125-year history.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref>

===Leeward Islands===
Upon moving through the [[Leeward Islands]], Georges brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, amounting to a maximum of 7.5&nbsp;inches (190&nbsp;mm) at [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John]].<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref> 

In [[Antigua]], strong winds caused severe property damage, mostly caused to roofs. 10-20% of houses were greatly impacted, including three schools. High winds during the passage of the hurricane downed telephone and power lines, causing loss of communication and power across much of the island.<ref name="lees">[http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/c2f0e3a1839e89fec125668a0045c53c?OpenDocument Leeward Islands Effects]</ref> Between [[Barbuda]] and Antigua, Georges killed 2 people and left 3,800 homeless.<ref name="overall">[http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/1999/summ9809.txt Overall Effects]</ref>

After passing through Antigua, Georges produced strong winds of up to 115&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]] (185&nbsp;[[km/h]]) while passing over [[St. Kitts]], downing power lines, telephone lines, and trees across the island. Lack of electricity resulted in damage to water facilities, as well. Georges's high winds caused extensive property damage, damaging 80-85% of the houses on the island, and destroying 20-25% of homes. Many schools, businesses, hospitals, and government buildings lost their roofs, while the airport experienced severe damage to its main terminal and control tower, limiting flights to the daytime. St. Kitts' economy was disrupted from severe agricultural losses, including the devastation of 50% of their sugar crop. In addition, damaged hotels and piers created a long-term impact through lack of tourism - an industry the island relies on. In all, Hurricane Georges caused 5&nbsp;fatalities, left 3,000&nbsp;homeless, and resulted in $445&nbsp;million (1998 USD) in damage on the island.<ref name="kittnevis">[http://website.lineone.net/~stkittsnevis/hurrican.htm St. Kitts and Nevis effects]</ref>

In the other part of [[St. Kitts and Nevis|the country]], [[Nevis]] fared better. Like on St. Kitts, high winds downed power and telephone lines, damaging the water system there. 35% of homes on the island were damaged, though none were destroyed. Rainfall and debris killed several hundred livestock and seriously damaged coconut trees, amounting to $2.5&nbsp;million (1998&nbsp;USD) in agricultural damage. There were no casualties reported on the island, and damaged amounted to $39&nbsp;million (1998&nbsp;USD).<ref name="kittnevis">[http://website.lineone.net/~stkittsnevis/hurrican.htm St. Kitts and Nevis effects]</ref>

In other nearby islands, Georges's impact was relatively minor. Power outages, flooding, and minor to moderate structural damage was common.<ref name="carib">[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/huricane/1998/wgrgedmg.htm Overall Impact]</ref>

===Puerto Rico===
[[Image:Georges River Flooding.jpg|right|thumb|Debris runoff in central Puerto Rico]]
[[Image:Damaged Earthflow from Georges.JPG|left|thumb|Damage from mudslides]]
On making landfall, Georges brought a 10&nbsp;foot (3&nbsp;m) storm surge, along with 20&nbsp;foot (6&nbsp;m) waves on top of it.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref><ref name="wave">[http://www.arrl.org/w1aw/1998-arlb076.html Puerto Rico Wave Heights]</ref> The hurricane spawned 2&nbsp;tornadoes on the island, though they caused little damage. Georges dropped immense precipitation in the mountain regions, amounting to a maximum of 30.51&nbsp;inches (775&nbsp;mm) in [[Jayuya, Puerto Rico|Jayuya]] with many other locations reporting over 1&nbsp;foot (300&nbsp;mm).<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref> <ref name="hpc">[http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/georges1998.html HPC Georges Rainfall Report for U.S.]</ref> The mountain flooding drained off in the island's rivers, causing every river to overflow its banks. Near the coast, the surfeit of water carved new channels from the record discharge rate. The storm's strong winds caused [[coastal erosion|beach erosion]] in many places along the coastline. Eroded beaches, flooding, and debris left many roads impassable or destroyed, isolating some villages on the western portion of the island.<ref name="puertovirgin">[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/sju/public_report.html Puerto Rico Damage Information]</ref> Over 22,000&nbsp;people were sheltered in 139&nbsp;shelters in cities throughout the island. All experienced power outages, and after the storm passed through, lack of water and sewer systems was a serious problem.<ref name="storn">[http://www.floridadisaster.org/bpr/Response/Plans/Nathaz/hurricanes/georges.pdf Before and After Effects]</ref>

[[Image:Georges PR Damage.jpg|right|thumb|Puerto Rico Damage]]

Hurricane Georges was the first hurricane to cross the entire island since the [[1932 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Seven|San Ciprian Hurricane]] in 1932.<ref name="puertovirgin">[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/sju/public_report.html Puerto Rico Damage Information]</ref> Its large circulation brought fierce winds to the entire island, damaging 72,605&nbsp;houses and destroying 28,005 homes. This left tens of thousands homeless after the storm's passage.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref> High winds downed nearly half of the island's electric and telephone lines, leaving 96% of the population powerless and 8.4% of telephone customers without service. Lack of electricity greatly damaged the water system, resulting in the loss of water and sewers for 75% of the island. Georges's deluge of rainfall caused significant damage to the agricultural industry, including the loss of 75% of its coffee crop, 95% of its banana or plantain crop, and 65% of its live poultry.<ref name="puertovirgin">[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/sju/public_report.html Puerto Rico Damage Information]</ref>

[[Image:Georges1998prrain.gif|thumb|left|Total rainfall in Puerto Rico from Georges]]
In all, Hurricane Georges caused $1.9&nbsp;billion in damage (1998 [[USD]], $2.25 billion 2006 USD), but due to well-executed warnings there were no reported casualties.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref>

In the nearby small island of [[Culebra]], Georges destroyed 74&nbsp;houses and damaged 89&nbsp;others, although damage estimates are not available there.<ref name="puertovirgin">[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/sju/public_report.html Puerto Rico Damage Information]</ref>

===Hispaniola===
Though there are no recorded amounts, satellite-derived rainfall estimates show up to 39&nbsp;inches (990&nbsp;mm) of rain falling in the mountainous terrain of the countries. This heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides and flooding, killing a total of 589&nbsp;people across the island.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref>

====Dominican Republic====
[[Image:GeorgesDR2.jpg|right|thumb|View of Santo Domingo's coastal boulevard during the storm]]
In the [[Dominican Republic]], Georges brought strong winds and very heavy rains, along with a 7&nbsp;foot (2&nbsp;m) storm surge. Nearly 10 &nbsp;hours of continuous rainfall resulted in mudslides and overflown rivers across the mountainous country, damaging many cities along the southern coastline, including the capital. 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) winds downed and uprooted trees across much of the country, littering streets with debris and mud. Thousands of houses were destroyed, while many were completely destroyed from the flooding and winds. The entire country was without electricity during the aftermath of the storm, damaging water and communication systems.<ref name="domrep">[http://stormcarib.com/georges/gdomrep3.htm Personal Accounts of Damage in Dominican Republic]</ref> Heavy wind damage and flooding caused extensive damage to the airport in [[Santo Domingo]], restricting usage to military and non-commercial flights.<ref name="car">[http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/00d7d4b29c36d5b18525668d005b110c?OpenDocument Caribbean Totals]</ref>

[[Image:GeorgesDR1.jpg|left|thumb|Knocked-down trees blocked hundreds of streets in Santo Domingo]]
Most impacted by Hurricane Georges was the agricultural industry. The areas hardest hit by the hurricane coincided with the country's main crop-growing areas, including the provinces around Santo Domingo. After a severe drought in 1997, extreme rainfall damaged around 470,000&nbsp;acres (1,900&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of food crops, including various types of vegetables, fruits, and roots &mdash; some of the country's main diet food. Substantial amounts of tobacco and sugar plantations, the country's most important export crop, were severely damaged. The extreme flooding caused great losses in the poultry industry, an important economy in the area. The Dominican Republic had to import significant amounts of rice and other crops to compensate for the losses.<ref name="crop">[http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/004/x0058e/x0058e00.htm Crop Damage]</ref>

Death toll reports were slow in the wake of the storm, but a total of 380&nbsp;people died from Hurricane Georges.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref> Damage in the Dominican Republic amounted to $1.2&nbsp;billion (1998&nbsp;[[USD]], $1.4&nbsp;billion 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="dpdamage">[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/1998/wgdomini.htm Damage Totals in Dominican Republic]</ref>

====Haiti====
Upon reaching [[Haiti]], Georges was a weakened hurricane, but it still brought heavy rainfall across the entire country. The capital city of [[Port-au-Prince, Haiti|Port au Prince]] was largely unharmed, with the exception of flooding in low-lying coastal areas, damaging the main commercial port.<ref name="car">[http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/00d7d4b29c36d5b18525668d005b110c?OpenDocument Caribbean Totals]</ref> The rest of the country, however, experienced a significant number of mudslides due to deforestation along the mountains.<ref name="hait">[http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/disaster/deathtoll.htm Haiti Reports]</ref> These mudslides destroyed or severely damaged many houses, leaving 167,332&nbsp;homeless.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref> Damage was greatest along the northern coastline from [[Cap-Haitien]] to [[Gonaives]] due to the flooding and mudslides.<ref name="hispd">[http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/sp/sp38/part2.html Hispaniola Damage]</ref> Lack of electricity led to a total disruption of the water supply system, causing a decrease in sanitary conditions across the poorest country in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name="haiti">[http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/7445f2d058e4a12dc125668e004cc37f?OpenDocument Damage totals in Haiti]</ref> In all, 209&nbsp;people died in [[Haiti]].<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref>

Like in the Dominican Republic, the agricultural sector suffered extreme damage. After a severe drought in 1997, Georges's severe flooding stopped any chances of recovering quickly. Most of the country's significant crop land, including [[Artibonite Valley]], suffered total losses. Up to 80% of banana plantations were lost, while vegetable, roots, tubers, and other food crops were ruined. In addition, thousands of small farm animals were either killed or lost.<ref name="crop">[http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/004/x0058e/x0058e00.htm Crop Damage]</ref> Total agricultural losses amounted to $179&nbsp;million (1998&nbsp;USD, $210 million 2006 USD).<ref name="caribd">[http://iys.cidi.org/disaster/98b/0076.html Caribbean Damage]</ref> The country requested food assistance in the aftermath of the hurricane to alleviate the serious losses.<ref name="crop">[http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/004/x0058e/x0058e00.htm Crop Damage]</ref>

===Cuba===
Upon making landfall, Hurricane Georges produced torrential rainfall, amounting to a maximum of 24.41&nbsp;inches (620&nbsp;mm) at Limonar in the province of [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Province|Guant<U+00E1>namo]]. Several other locations reported over a foot (300&nbsp;mm) of precipitation as well.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref> Storm surge of 4&ndash;6&nbsp;feet (1&ndash;2&nbsp;m) was expected along the eastern coastline, along with dangerous waves on top of the surge. Though winds were reduced by the time Georges hit Cuba, it still retained winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h), along with stronger gusts in squalls.<ref name="pubadvcuba">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/pub/PAL0798.035 Hurricane Georges Public Advisory Number 35]</ref>

The hurricane's heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides along the mountainous terrain. This, combined with strong winds, damaged 60,475&nbsp;homes, of which 3,481 were completely destroyed.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref> In the country, 100,000 were left homeless due to Hurricane Georges.<ref name="seasum">[http://www.hurricanecity.com/dam/dam1998.htm 1998 Hurricane City Seasonal Summary]</ref> High winds downed power lines, trees, and telephone poles, leaving many in eastern Cuba without electricity in the aftermath of the storm. Along the coast, severe flooding washed out railroad and highway bridges. Though eastern Cuba was the area most affected, the central and western portion of the island, including [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]], experienced torrential rains and strong wind gusts.<ref name="cubad">[http://iys.cidi.org/disaster/98b/0069.html Cuba Damage]</ref> There, strong waves broke over the [[seawall]], and caused heavy flood damage to some of the town's old buildings.<ref name="havana">[http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y98/sep98/28e9.htm Havana Effects]</ref>

Like in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, the severe drought during the [[El Ni<U+00F1>o]] of 1997 exacerbated the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, despite the effort to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply.<ref name="crop">[http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/004/x0058e/x0058e00.htm Crop Damage]</ref>

Well-executed evacuations and warnings limited the death toll to six, <ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref> while damage amounted to $40 million (1998 USD, $46 million 2005 USD). <ref name="cubdam">[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/NHR-Cuba.pdf Cuba Hurricanes and their Effects]</ref>

===Bahamas===
Though Georges was forecast to move through [[the Bahamas]], it passed to the south of the archipelago. It brought 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) winds to [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] and [[South Andros]], as well as precipitation in the storm's outer bands. Though damage was minimal, one person died in the country.<ref name="baha">[http://www.bahamasweather.org.bs/tropical/history/index.php Bahamas Effects]</ref><ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref>

Georges's strong storm surge caused extensive beach erosion and flooding on the [[Chandeleur Islands]], the first line of protection for the coasts of Louisiana and [[Mississippi]]. The long island chain was reduced to a few banks of sand in the Gulf. Grand Gosier, the home to a flock of the endangered [[Brown Pelican]]s, experienced severe flooding, destroying their habitats.<ref name="after">[http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/02/georges.aftermath/ United States totals]</ref>

Upon making landfall, Hurricane Georges brought a storm surge of up to 8.9&nbsp;feet (2.7&nbsp;m) in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]. While stalling over the southern portion of the state, it produced torrential rainfall, amounting to 16.7&nbsp;inches (420&nbsp;mm) in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]]. The heavy flooding caused significant river overflowing, including the Tchoutacabouffa River at [[D'Iberville, Mississippi|D'Iberville]], which set a record crest of 19&nbsp;feet (5.7&nbsp;m). The overflown rivers in the southern portion of the state flooded homes and forced more to evacuate just days after the hurricane came through.<ref name="tcr">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998georges.html NHC Georges Report]</ref> In addition, squall lines spawned multiple tornadoes, damaging evacuation shelters in Pascagoula and Gautier.<ref name="power">[http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9809/28/georges.05/ Gulf Coast Effects]</ref>

===Retirement===
{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricanes}}
The name Georges was retired in the spring of 1999 and will never again be used in the [[Atlantic basin]].  It was replaced with [[Hurricane Gaston (2004)|Gaston]] in the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004 season]].

==Trivia==
From [[September 25]] to [[September 26]], Hurricane Georges was one of four simultaneous hurricanes in the [[Atlantic basin]]. Previously, the last recorded occurrence of this was in the [[1893 Atlantic hurricane season|1893 season]].

Georges greatly affected the 1998 college football season. Undefeated [[UCLA]] had been originally been scheduled to play the [[University of Miami]] at the [[Miami Orange Bowl]] in late September, but the game was postponed until December due to the danger that Georges posed to [[Florida]]. UCLA entered the game against Miami in December with a #1 ranking and a 10-0 record, but were defeated by the Hurricanes, eliminating them from the national championship race.

Hurricane Georges was also mentioned in comedian [[Ron White]]'s comedy special, ''They Call Me Tater Salad'', as was [[Hurricane Carla]].

The [[Eagle (ship)|wreck of the Eagle]] at the [[Florida Keys]] was torn in two parts by Georges.
