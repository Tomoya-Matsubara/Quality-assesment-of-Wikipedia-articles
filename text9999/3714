'''''A Streetcar Named Desire''''' is a 1947 [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[United States|American]] playwright [[Tennessee Williams]] for which he received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1948. The play opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on [[December 3]] [[1947]] and closed on [[December 17]] [[1949]] in the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]]. The Broadway production was directed by [[Elia Kazan]] and starred [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Kim Hunter]], and [[Karl Malden]].

In 1951, a film adaptation of the play, directed by [[Elia Kazan]], won several awards, including an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Vivien Leigh]] as Best Actress in the role of Blanche.  In 1995, it was made into an [[A Streetcar Named Desire (opera)|opera]] with music by [[Andre Previn]] and presented by the [[San Francisco Opera]].

==Plot synopsis==
Widely considered a landmark play, ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' deals with a culture clash between two symbolic characters, [[Blanche DuBois (character)|Blanche DuBois]], a pretentious, fading relic of the [[Old South]], and [[Stanley Kowalski]], a rising member of the industrial, urban immigrant class. 
The play presents [[Blanche DuBois (character)|Blanche DuBois]], a fading but still-attractive [[Southern belle]] whose pretensions to virtue and culture only thinly mask [[alcoholism]] and delusions of grandeur. Her poise is an illusion she presents to shield others, but most of all herself, from her reality, and an attempt to make herself still attractive to new male suitors. Blanche arrives at the apartment of her sister [[Stella Kowalski]] in the [[Faubourg Marigny]] of [[New Orleans]], on [[Elysian Fields Avenue]]; the local transportation she takes to arrive there includes a streetcar route named "Desire". The steamy, urban ambiance is a shock to Blanche's nerves.  Explaining that her ancestral southern plantation, Belle Reve (translated from French as "Beautiful Dream", though the correct French phrase is actually Beau R<U+00EA>ve), in Laurel, Mississippi, has been "lost" due to the "epic fornications" of her ancestors, Blanche is welcomed with some trepidation by Stella, who fears the reaction of her husband Stanley. Here "epic fornications" may be interpreted as the debauchery of her ancestors which in turn caused them financial losses. Blanche explains to them how her supervisor told her she could take time off from her job as an English teacher because of her upset nerves, when in fact, she has been fired for having an affair with a 17-year-old student.  This turns out not to be the only seduction she has engaged in&mdash;and, along with other problems, has left Laurel to escape. A brief marriage scarred by discovery of her spouse, Allen Grey, having a homosexual affair and his subsequent suicide has led Blanche to live in a world in which her fantasies and illusions are seamlessly mixed with her reality.  

In contrast to both the self-effacing and deferent Stella and the pretentious refinement of Blanche, Stella's husband, [[Stanley Kowalski]], is a force of nature: primal, rough-hewn, brutish and sensual.  He dominates Stella in every way and is physically and emotionally abusive. Stella tolerates his primal behaviour as this is part of what attracted her in the first place; their love and relationship is heavily based on powerful even animalistic sexual chemistry, something that Blanche finds impossible to understand.

The arrival of Blanche upsets her sister and brother-in-law's system of mutual dependence. Stella's concern for her sister's well-being emboldens Blanche to hold court in the Kowalski apartment, infuriating Stanley and leading to conflict in his relationship with his wife. Stanley's friend and Blanche's would-be suitor [[Harold Mitchell (A Streetcar Named Desire character)|Mitch]] is trampled along Blanche and Stanley's collision course.  Stanley discovers Blanche's past through a co-worker who travels to Laurel frequently, and Stanley confronts Blanche with the things she has been trying to put behind her, partly out of concern that her character flaws may be damaging to the lives of those in her new home, just as they were in Laurel, and partly out of a distaste for pretense in general.  However, his attempts to "unmask" her are predictably cruel and violent.  Their final confrontation&mdash;a rape&mdash;results in Blanche's nervous breakdown.  Stanley has her committed to a mental institution, and in the closing moments, Blanche utters her signature line to the kindly doctor who leads her away: "Whoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers," reminding us of one of the flaws that has led her to this point--relying too heavily on the attentions of men to fulfill and rescue her.

The reference to the [[tram|streetcar]] called ''Desire''&mdash;providing the aura of New Orleans geography&mdash;is symbolic.  Blanche not only has to travel on a streetcar route named "Desire" to reach Stella's home on "[[Elysium|Elysian Fields]]" but her desire acts as an irrepressible force throughout the play&mdash;she can only hang on as her desires lead her.

The character of Blanche is thought to be based on Williams' sister Rose Williams who struggled with her mental health and became incapacitated after a [[lobotomy]].

==Themes and motifs==
===Illusion versus reality===

A recurring theme found in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' is a constant conflict between reality and fantasy, actual and ideal.  Blanche says "I don't want realism, I want magic."  This recurring theme is read most strongly in Williams' characterization of Blanche DuBois and the physical tropes that she employs in her pursuit of what is magical and idealized:  the paper lampshade she employs to cover the harsh white light bulb in the living room, her chronically deceptive recounting of her last years in Belle Reve, the misleading letters she presumes to write to Shep Huntleigh, and a pronounced tendency toward excess consumption of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. As one critic writes, "Blanche spins a cocoon linguistically for protection."{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Blanche creates her own fantasy world through the characters she plays, such as the damsel, southern belle or school teacher. She wears her costumes creating a fa<U+00E7>ade to hide behind, concealing her secrets and attempting to reach her former glory, and illustrating her inability to relate to others in a "normal" sense.

Notably, Blanche's deception of others and herself is not characterized by malicious intent, but rather a heart-broken and saddened retreat to a romantic time and happier moments before disaster struck her life (her previous loved one, the refined Allan Gray, committed suicide during a Varsouviana Polka, as a reaction to Blanche's revulsion when she discovered he was homosexual, after she accidentally encountered him having sex with another man).

===Abandonment of chivalric codes===
In most fairy tales, the ailing princess or the damsel in distress is often rescued by a heroic white knight.  ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' is characterized by the conspicuous absence of the male protagonist imbued with heroic qualities.  Indeed, the polar opposite of what a literary chivalric hero might be, is represented in the leading male character of the play, Stanley Kowalski.  Stanley is described by Blanche as a "survivor of the [[Stone Age#The Stone Age in popular culture|Stone Age]]" and is further depicted in this primitive light by numerous traits that he exhibits: uncivilized manners, demanding and forceful behavior, lack of empathy, crass selfishness, and a chauvinistic attitude towards women.  The replacement of the heroic white knight by a character such as Stanley Kowalski further heightens Williams' theme of the demise of the romantic "Old South."

==Stage productions==
===Original Broadway production===
[[Image:Marlon Brando 1948.jpg|thumb|right|A 24 year old [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Stanley Kowalski]] on the set of the stage version of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]] in 1948.]]
The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production was produced by [[Irene Mayer Selznick]]. It opened at the [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert]] in [[New Haven]] shortly before moving to the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on [[December 3]], [[1947]]. Selznick originally wanted to cast [[Margaret Sullavan]] and [[John Garfield]], but settled on [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Jessica Tandy]], who were both virtual unknowns at the time. Brando was given car fare to [[Tennessee Williams]]' home in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], where he not only gave a sensational reading, but did some house repairs as well. Tandy was cast after Williams saw her performance in a West Coast production of his one-act play ''Portrait of a Madonna''. The opening night cast also included [[Kim Hunter]] as Stella and [[Karl Malden]] as Mitch. Later in the run, [[Uta Hagen]] replaced Tandy, and [[Anthony Quinn]] replaced Brando. Hagen and Quinn took the show on a national tour and then returned back to Broadway for additional performances. Early on, when Brando broke his nose, [[Jack Palance]] took over his role. [[Ralph Meeker]] also took on the part of Stanley both in the Broadway and touring companies. Tandy received a [[Tony Award]] for Best Actress in a Play. The production received no other Tony nominations. Brando portrayed Stanley with an overt [[Human male sexuality|sexuality]] that made him, the character of Stanley, and Tennessee Williams into cultural touchstones.

===London production===
[[Vivien Leigh]], who won an [[Academy Award]] for the [[A Streetcar Named Desire (film)|1951 film version]], appeared in a 1949 [[London]] production, at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], which was directed by her husband, [[Laurence Olivier]]. [[Bonar Colleano]] co-starred as Stanley.

===Revivals===
[[Tallulah Bankhead]], whom Williams had in mind when writing the play, starred in a 1956 [[New York City Center Company]] production directed by [[Herbert Machiz]]. The production, which was staged at the [[Coconut Grove Playhouse]] in [[Miami]], was not well received and only ran 16 performances.

The first Broadway revival of the play was in 1973. It was produced by the [[Lincoln Center]],  at the [[Vivian Beaumont Theatre]], and starred [[Rosemary Harris]] as Blanche and [[James Farentino]] as Stanley.  

A highly publicized 1992 revival starred [[Alec Baldwin]] as Stanley and [[Jessica Lange]] as Blanche. This production proved so successful that it was filmed for television. The stage revival was staged at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]], the same theatre the original production was staged in. It featured [[Timothy Carhart]] as Mitch and [[Amy Madigan]] as Stella, as well as future ''[[Sopranos]]'' stars [[James Gandolfini]] and [[Aida Turturro]]. Gandolfini was Carhart's understudy. Baldwin received a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Actor in a Play.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
{{main|A Streetcar Named Desire (film)}}

In 1951, [[Elia Kazan]] directed a movie based on the play. References to Allan Gray's homosexuality are essentially removed, due to [[United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930|censorship common at the time]].  Instead, the reason for his suicide is changed to a general "weakness".<ref>{{cite book | last=Cohan  | first=Steven | pages=p. 254 | title=Masked Men: Masculinity and the Movies in the Fifties | location=Bloomington, IN | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=1997 | isbn=0253211271 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UACyelofecEC&pg=PA254&lpg=PA254&dq=%22allan+gray%22+suicide+blanche&source=web&ots=VgIQLYb6yG&sig=oiTGezngRkFrlbUy5jXsV-gusY4#PPA254,M1 | accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> The play is referenced in [[Pedro Almodovar]]'s 1999 [[Academy Award]]-winning film, ''[[All About My Mother]]'', in which a [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] version of the play is seen being performed by some of the supporting characters. However, some of the dialogue is based on the 1951 film version, not the original stage version.

===Opera and ballet ===
{{main|A Streetcar Named Desire (opera)}}
In 1995, an opera was adapted and composed by [[Andr<U+00E9> Previn]] with a libretto by Philip Littell, after the play by Tennessee Williams had its premiere at the [[San Francisco Opera]] during the 1998-99 season. It featured [[Renee Fleming]] as Blanche.

A 1952 ballet production, which was staged at Her Majesty's Theatre in [[Montreal]], featured the music of [[Alex North]], who also composed the music for the film version.

===Television ===
{{main|A Streetcar Named Desire (1984 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire (1995 film)}}
In 1955, the television program ''[[Omnibus (TV series)|Omnibus]]'' featured [[Jessica Tandy]] reviving her original Broadway performance as Blanche, with her husband, [[Hume Cronyn]], as Mitch. It aired only portions of the play that featured the Blanche and Mitch characters.

The multi-[[Emmy Award]]-winning 1984 television version featured [[Ann-Margret]] as Blanche, [[Treat Williams]] as Stanley, [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Stella and [[Randy Quaid]] as Mitch. It was directed by [[John Erman]] and the teleplay was adapted by [[Oscar Saul]]. The music score by composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]]. Ann-Margret, D'Angelo and Quaid were all nominated for [[Emmy Awards]], but none won.  However, it did win four Emmys, including one for [[cinematographer]] [[Bill Butler (cinematographer)|Bill Butler]]. Ann-Margret won a [[Golden Globe]] award for her performance and Treat Williams was nominated for Best Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie.

A 1995 television version was based on the highly successful Broadway revival that starred [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Jessica Lange]]. However, only Baldwin and Lange were from the stage production. The TV version added [[John Goodman]] as Mitch and [[Diane Lane]] as Stella. This production was directed by [[Glenn Jordan]]. Baldwin, Lange and Goodman all received [[Emmy Award]] nominations.  Lange won a [[Golden Globe]] award (for Best Actress in a Miniseries or TV Movie), while Baldwin was nominated for Best Actor, but did not win.

In 1998, [[PBS]] aired a taped version of the opera adaptation that featured the original [[San Francisco Opera]] cast. The program received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination for Outstanding Classical Music/Dance Program.

==Streetcar revival in New Orleans==
Over 50 years after the play opened, the revival of [[Streetcars in New Orleans|the streetcar system]] in [[New Orleans]] is credited by many to the worldwide fame gained by the [[streetcar]]s made by the [[Perley A. Thomas Car Works, Inc.]] which were operating on the Desire route in the play, and have been carefully restored and continue to operate there in 2004 (though not on the Desire Street route.)  Streetcars along the Canal Street in downtown New Orleans are up and running. Previously, the St. Charles Avenue line was in partial service due to damages sustained during [[Hurricane Katrina]] but as of January 2008, it is in full operation.  Presently, though, there is merely a bus named Desire.  Plans have recently been made to revive the streetcar line and funding was allocated for the project in the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]]'s FY97 budget.  However, the projected was halted prior to Hurricane Katrina and there is no word, as of yet, to when it will resume.

==A Streetcar Named Success==
''A Streetcar Named Success'' is an [[essay]] by [[Tennessee Williams]] about art and the artist's role in society. It is often included in paper editions of A Streetcar Named Desire.

A version of this essay first appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'', November 30, 1947, four days before the opening of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]''.  Another version of this essay, titled "The Catastrophe of Success " is sometimes used as an introduction to ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''.
