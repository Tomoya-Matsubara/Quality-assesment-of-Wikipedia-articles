'''John Donkin Dormand, Baron Dormand of Easington''' (27 August 1919 &ndash; 18 December 2003), known as '''Jack Dormand''', was a British [[education]]ist and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician from the [[coal mining]] area of [[Easington, County Durham|Easington]] in [[County Durham]], in the [[North East England|north-east of England]]. He was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Easington (UK Parliament constituency)|Easington constituency]] from 1970 until his retirement in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/ecommons1.htm |title=House Of Commons Constituencies Beginning With "E" |author=Leigh Rayment |work=Leigh Rayment's Peerage Pages |date= |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Dormand was born near Easington at the workingmen's club in the village of [[Haswell, County Durham|Haswell]], when his father Bernard, a former miner, was steward.<ref name="rebel-without-applause"/> He was educated locally at Wellfield Grammar School. Although he later took up [[rugby football|rugby]],,<ref name="independent-obit" /> he was a skilled [[Association football|football]]er in his youth, good enough to have professional trials with both [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].<ref name="times-obit">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article837379.ece |title=Lord Dormand of Easington: Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party who found his loyalties divided over the 1984 miners<U+2019> strike |author= |work=[[The Times]] |date=23 December 2003 |accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref> Sport remained a major part of his life; until his death he remained a member [[Houghton-le-Spring]] Rugby Club and of [[Bournmoor|Burnmoor]] Cricket Club, last playing both games at the age of 63.<ref name="northern-echo-obit">{{cite news |url= |title=Politician who never stopped fighting for his home ground |author= |work=[[Northern Echo]] |date=20 December 2003 |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

== Political career ==
Dormand had been a member of the Labour Party since the age of 18. He was elected to Haswell [[parish council]] at the age of 26, and at 30 to Easington [[rural district|rural district council]].<ref name="guardian-obit">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1110807,00.html |title=Lord Dormand of Easington, genial chairman during Labour's hard times |author=[[Andrew Roth]] |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 December 2003 |accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref>

[[Manny Shinwell, Baron Shinwell|Manny Shinwell]], the then 85-year-old veteran Labour [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Easington (UK Parliament constituency)|Easington constituency]], announced in 1969 that he would not contest the next general election. Dormand, who had been secretary of the Easington [[Constituency Labour Party]] throughout the 1960s and Shinwell's presumed successor,<ref name="independent-obit" /> was selected as the new Labour candidate to contest the ultra-[[safe seat]] (Shinwell had been re-elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966]] with over 80% of the votes<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge66/i07.htm |title=UK general election results March 1966, D&ndash;E |author= |work=Richard Kimber's Political Science Resources |date= |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>). At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]] in which [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government was defeated, Dormand was returned to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with a barely-reduced 79.8% share of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge66/i70.htm |title=UK general election results 1970, D&ndash;E |author= |work=Richard Kimber's Political Science Resources |date= |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>

===Education===
His [[maiden speech]] on 8 July 1970 focused on education and on the needs of Durham as an "excepted district", and in particular on those classed as "slow learners". It was well-received and the then [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] was seen to be making notes.<ref name="independent-obit" /> Dormand's views on education were supportive of [[comprehensive school|comprehensive education]], and in July 1973 he urged the abolition of private schools (attacking particularly those Labour MPs who sent their children to be educated privately).<ref name="Roth" />

Dormand opposed Britain's membership of the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC),<ref name="telegraph-obit" /> and at the time of the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|referendum on EEC membership]] in 1975 he was an advocate for the United Kingdom leaving the EEC and rejoining the [[European Free Trade Association]].<ref name="Roth" /> His main work in opposition was as a member of [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] on [[Nationalization|nationalised industries]], where his knowledge and inquisitorial skills won him the respect of the committee's left-wing chair [[Ian Mikardo]].<ref name="independent-obit" /> In February 1972 he called for employment for miners who had been made redundant, and became Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party's Northern Group in 1973.<ref name="Roth" />

===Republicanism===
Dormand later described himself as "a republican for as long as I can remember having an interest in politics" and was a long-serving secretary of the all-party Parliamentary republican group.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2002/2/7/146506.html |title=Patriot games, by invitation only |author= |work=Northern Echo |date=7 February 2002 |accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> He spoke out in opposition to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]], declaring in 1971 that "the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow".<ref name="times-obit" /> He extended his criticism to the [[hereditary peer]]age in February 1973.<ref name="Roth" /> In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP [[Willie Hamilton]] took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it.<ref name="telegraph-obit" /> The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for "scores of miners" to be honoured as they were just as worthy.<ref name="Honours list">"Labour MP wants miners in the honours list", ''The Times'', 30 January 1974, p. 7.</ref>     

==Government whip==
Labour was returned to government at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]], and Dormand was appointed as an assistant government whip under [[Bob Mellish, Baron Mellish|Bob Mellish]]. He was promoted to be a [[Lord of the Treasury]] (full Government whip) in a reshuffle after the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October election]].<ref name="British Political Facts">[[David Butler (academic)|David Butler]] and Gareth Butler, "Twentieth Century British Political Facts" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2000), p. 37.</ref> 

The post of a Whip normally required silence in the chamber of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], but in February 1976 Dormand was involved in a difficult situation which required him to give an explanation. The Conservative opposition had called a vote censuring the [[Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform|Secretary of State for Industry]] [[Eric Varley, Baron Varley|Eric Varley]] by reducing his salary by <U+00A3>1,000. Dormand was appointed as one of the tellers to count the vote, but both he and his Conservative opposite number miscounted and lost the true count. When Mellish announced the confusion to the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (UK)|Speaker]], the Speaker agreed to hold another vote. Embarrassingly for Dormand, many Labour MPs had not stayed to hear the result and were no longer present, resulting in the Conservatives winning the vote by a majority of five.<ref name="Miscounted division">"'Not a true vote'-Government Chief Whip", ''The Times'', 12 February 1976, p. 6.</ref> The Government decided that the result was not a true indication of the House's opinion and overturned the vote a few days later.

When [[James Callaghan]] succeeded Wilson as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1976, Mellish resigned and was replaced by [[Michael Cocks]], and Dormand was promoted within the Whip's office to be the pairing whip, a job which involved co-ordinating agreed absences MPs from one party with those of another so that the outcome of parliamentary votes is not affected.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19961222/ai_n14072695 |title=Whips' tricks kill the House's trusty system |author=Paul Routledge |work=[[The Independent]] |date=22 December 1996 |accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref>  The Home Secretary [[Merlyn Rees, Baron Merlyn-Rees|Merlyn Rees]] had urged Callaghan to appoint Dormand as Chief Whip rather than [[Michael Cocks]].<ref name="independent-obit"/>

The role of the pairing whip remained a crucial one as the government's slim majority turned to a minority through defeats at by-elections, and Dormand was credited with a central role in helping the government stay in office,<ref name="BBC-obit" />  telling Wilson that he was too "bloody knackered at the end of the day" to record the events surrounding the late-night votes.<ref name="guardian-obit" /> In January 1978 Dormand was named in a report by the [[Serjeant-at-Arms]] as having assisted in blocking one of the Division lobbies in an attempt to prevent a vote on part of the Government's legislation to devolve power to Scotland.<ref name="Division lobby blocking">Michael Hatfield, "Ministers plan moves to salvage Scotland Bill as Tories prepare for battle in the Lords", ''The Times'', 28 January 1978, p. 2.</ref>

On free votes he did not always help the Government. In July 1977, Dormand voted against the European Assembly Elections Bill which brought in direct elections to the [[European Parliament]].<ref name="European elections bill">Michael Hatfield, "Six Cabinet ministers among vote rebels", ''The Times'', 8 July 1977, p. 1.</ref>

== In opposition ==
When Labour lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], Dormand served for two years as an opposition whip. He was an active opposition frontbencher who was particularly vocal in criticising the effects of the Thatcher government's economic policy on the manufacturing industry of the Northern region: in June 1980 he said that the policies were "crucifying" the region and it was "becoming a scene of devastation".<ref name="Thatcher economic policies">"PM refuses to tax more, borrow more or print more money", ''The Times'', 27 June 1980, p. 14.</ref> He specifically called on Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir [[Geoffrey Howe]] to abandon [[monetarism]].<ref name="Monetarism">"Chancellor says he is following same monetary policy as his predecessor", ''The Times'', 7 November 1980, p. 9.</ref>      
      
===Parliamentary Labour Party chair===
In the 1970s, Dormand had opposed left-wing infiltration into the Labour Party,<ref name="telegraph-obit" /> and in foreign affairs, he was pro-American and pro-[[NATO]]<ref name="guardian-obit" /> at a time when the party's left-wing was becoming increasingly hostile to both. In October 1981, Dormand stood for the vacant position of Chairman of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]], supported by the centre-Right Manifesto Group of Labour MPs. The strength of the left-wing in the Constituency Labour Parties at the time had spurred the Manifesto group to improve its organisation, and Dormand (nominated by former Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]])<ref name="Callaghan nominated">Philip Webster, "Foot asserts control over Labour NEC ", ''The Times'', 29 October 1981, p. 28.</ref> defeated the main challenger, left-wing MP [[Ian Mikardo]] by 102 votes to 65, and Mikardo then withdrew.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x6ZtOT3bFXkC&pg=PA70&dq=jack+dormand&sig=Bxf8-oOi9WxdPoJW7GelPFgWuYE |title=Fightback!: Labour's Traditional Right in the 1970s and 1980s |author=Dianne Hayter |work= |year=2005 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0719072719 |page=70 |accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> The other three candidates were [[Harry Ewing, Baron Ewing of Kirkford|Harry Ewing]] (22 votes), [[Willie Hamilton]] (11 votes) and [[Frank Hooley]] (11 votes) but all withdrew so no second ballot was held.<ref name="PLP Chair election 1981">Philip Webster, "Ex-whip is new PLP chairman", ''The Times'', 6 November 1981, p. 2.</ref> Dormand held the chairmanship until he retired from the House of Commons in 1987.

Dormand had a difficult job in trying to unite a fractious Parliamentary party at a time when the Labour Party was growing unpopular. In November 1982, amidst rumours that a majority of Labour MPs wanted to replace party leader [[Michael Foot]], Dormand gave a radio interview insisting that "I have absolutely no doubt whatever that the vast majority think that Michael Foot is the man for the job at the moment, and will take us into the next general election". In response, Foot's critics noted Dormand's use of the words "at the moment".<ref name="Foot leadership">Anthony Bevins, "MPs enraged by Foot's failure to unite party", ''The Times'', 26 November 1982, p. 1.</ref>

===Kingmaker for the Speaker===
After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], Dormand played a key role in the accession to the Speakership of [[Bernard Weatherill]], seconding his nomination for the post. Weatherill had been an opposition whip when Dormand had been working in the Government whip's office in the late 1970s, but had not been appointed to the Thatcher government; in supporting him, Dormand pointed out to Labour cheers that Weatherill "is his own man" and would "ensure that the rights of backbenchers were safeguarded".<ref name="Weatherill">"Weatherill pledges to be faithful", ''The Times'', 16 June 1983, p. 4.</ref> In July 1983 he worked with his Conservative opposite number [[Edward du Cann]] (Chairman of the [[1922 Committee]]) to agree an increase in MPs' pay over that which the Government proposed.<ref name="MPs pay">"Pay rises for MPs as they decide their own incomes policy to 1988", ''The Times'', 21 July 1983, p. 4.</ref>

Like most Labour MPs, Dormand opposed the decision of [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] president [[Arthur Scargill]] to call a [[UK miners' strike (1984<U+2013>1985)|national strike in 1984 to 1985]], but he supported the miners in the Durham coalfield when his local Easington Colliery and others joined the strike.<ref name="independent-obit" /> He accused the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] of washing her hands of the dispute like "Pontius Pilate".<ref name="telegraph-obit" />

Despite his age, he remained physically active. In the 1970s he had campaigned successfully for the establishment of a parliamentary gym,<ref name="telegraph-obit" /> continued playing cricket and rugby until the age of 63, and cycled from the House of Commons to his flat near [[Millbank]].<ref name="rebel-without-applause" /> The then [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[John Biffen]], recounted how Dormand would "swathe himself in luminous strips" before setting off,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YcMlAAAAMAAJ&q=jack+dormand&dq=jack+dormand&pgis=1 |title=Inside the House of Commons: Behind the Scenes at Westminster |author=[[John Biffen]] |publisher=Grafton |year=1989 |isbn=0246134798 |page=97 |accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> and although he abandoned the bicycle in 1987, deterred by London's heavy traffic, he took up walking instead.<ref name="rebel-without-applause" />

=== House of Lords ===
Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]] was expected to ask him to be government chief whip if Labour won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]],<ref name="guardian-obit" /> but Dormand thought it right to retire at the age of 67.<ref name="independent-obit" /> His successor [[John Cummings (politician)|John Cummings]] was the first miner to become MP for the area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/9772/New-standard-bearer-for-Labour.3175639.jp |title=New standard bearer for Labour in Easington |author=[[John Cummings (politician)|John Cummings]] |work=Hartlepool Mail |date=5 September 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref>

A staunch republican who deplored all forms of social privilege, including hereditary peerages,<ref name="telegraph-obit" /> he accepted Kinnock's offer of a seat in the [[House of Lords]] with some reluctance, receiving a [[life peer]]age as '''Baron Dormand of Easington''', of Easington in the [[County Durham|County of Durham]] on 13 October 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leighrayment.com/peers/peersd4.htm |title=Peerage: Dormand to Duffus |author= |work=Leigh Rayment's peerage pages |date= |accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref>

However, once in the Lords he thrived, serving on numerous select committees, including education, trade and industry, and the liaison and procedure committees.<ref name="independent-obit" /> He was also appointed as deputy chairman of the [[Teesside Development Corporation]], whose {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} of de-industrialised land included part of his former constituency.<ref name="guardian-obit" /> The Corporation was later condemned by Labour MP [[Ashok Kumar (British politician)|Ashok Kumar]] for having left a legacy of limited and "often inappropriate and threadbare development".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,318943,00.html |title=Police inquiry into grant by agency: Government redevelopment money was allegedly diverted |author= Peter Hetherington |work=The Guardian |date=27 May 2000 |accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref>

His areas of expertise included the film industry and tourism,<ref name="independent-obit" /> continuing the work he had begin in the Commons as chair of the all-party parliamentary tourism committee in seeking the promotion of tourism in previously overlooked parts of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article992941.ece |title=Lives Remembered: Lord Dormand of Easington |author=[[Conal Gregory]] |work=The Times |date=12 January 2004 |accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref>  He was also a member of the select committee on committee structure of the House of Lords and its chairman at the end of 1991, and later became Labour Peer<U+2019>s Representative on the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]].<ref name="loughborough-degree-speech" />

Dormand had been brought up a Christian, an allegiance which continued into adulthood, when he sat on the parochial church council.
