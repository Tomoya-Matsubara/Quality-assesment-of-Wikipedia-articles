'''Gij<U+00F3>n''' ([[Asturian language|Asturian]]: '''Xix<U+00F3>n''') is a coastal industrial city and its [[municipality]] in the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Asturias]] in [[Spain]]. Early mediaeval texts mention it as "Gigia".  It was an important regional [[Roman Empire|Roman]] city, although the area has been settled since earliest history. The name was originally applied to a small peninsula presently referred to as Cimadevilla, literally "top of village," between two beaches, one of which has a recreational port today. The main port, one of the largest in the north of Spain, is called "[[El Musel]]". Gij<U+00F3>n has a growing population of approximately 275,000 (2005).

== Geography ==
The city is situated on the central Asturian coast, from sea level to an altitude of 513 metres at Picu San Martin and 672 metres at [[Pe<U+00F1>a de los Cuatro Jueces]], bordered on the West by [[Carre<U+00F1>o]], the East by [[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]], and to the South by [[Siero]] and [[Llanera, Asturias|Llanera]]

The city is situated along the Asturian coast and is distinguished by the peninsula of Cimadevilla (the original settlement) which separates the beach of San Lorenzo and adjacent neighborhoods to the east from the beaches of Poniente and Arbeyal, the shipyards, and the recreational port and the Port of [[El Musel]] to the west. It is close to the other main Asturian cities, [[Oviedo]] and [[Avil<U+00E9>s]].

== Access == 
The A-66 motorway (Ruta de La Plata), A-8 (Autopista del Cant<U+00E1>brico) and the AS-1 (Autov<U+00ED>a Minera) are the main highway accesses. By train, Gij<U+00F3>n has daily service to [[Madrid]], [[La Coru<U+00F1>a]], [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], and [[Barcelona]]. Cruise ships call at El Musel, and the Airport of Asturias is located in the not far away municipality of [[Castrill<U+00F3>n]] with daily flights to major Spanish and European cities.<br />
A [[Subway (rail)|subway]] system, called ''Metrotren'', is currently under construction to improve the public transport in Gij<U+00F3>n.<br />
There are 22 regular lines of bus and 4 "night lines" of bus called "Buho" and special lines in special events like the ''Feria Internacional de Muestras'' de Gijon (Gijon International Exposition Fair) or the ''Semana Negra'' (literally ''Black Week'')[http://www.semananegra.org/], the city's famous one-week Festival based on [[Hardboiled]] literature.
