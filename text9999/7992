'''Bats''' are flying [[mammal]]s in the order '''Chiroptera''' ({{pron-en|ka<U+026A><U+02C8>r<U+0252>pt<U+0259>r<U+0259>}}). The forelimbs of bats are webbed and developed as [[wing]]s, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained [[flight]]. By contrast, other mammals said to [[Flight|fly]], such as [[flying squirrel]]s, [[Greater Glider|gliding possum]]s and [[colugo]]s, [[Gliding (flight)|glide]] rather than fly, and can only glide for short distances. Bats do not flap their entire forelimbs, as [[bird]]s do, but instead flap their spread out [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]],<ref name=molecule>{{cite journal |last=Hunter |first=P. |year=2007 |month=September |title=The nature of flight.

==Classification and evolution==
[[File:Golden crowned fruit bat.jpg|thumb|[[Giant Golden-crowned Flying-fox]], ''Acerodon jubatus''.]]
Bats are [[mammal]]s. Sometimes they are mistakenly called "flying [[rodent]]s" or "flying rats", and they can also be mistaken for [[insect]]s and birds. There are two traditionally recognized suborders of bats:

* [[Megabat|Megachiroptera]] (megabats)
* [[Microbat|Microchiroptera]] (microbats/echolocating bats)

Not all megabats are larger than microbats. The major distinctions between the two suborders are:
* Microbats use [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]: megabats do not with the exception of ''[[Rousettus]]'' and relatives.
* Microbats lack the [[claw]] at the second [[toe]] of the [[forelimb]].
* The [[ear]]s of microbats do not close to form a ring: the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear.
* Microbats lack [[underfur]]: they are either naked or have [[guard hair]]s.

Megabats eat fruit, [[nectar]] or [[pollen]] while most microbats eat [[insect]]s; others may feed on the [[blood]] of animals, small mammals, fish, frogs, fruit, pollen or nectar. Megabats have a well-developed [[visual cortex]] and show good [[visual acuity]], while microbats rely on [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] for navigation and finding prey.

The phylogenetic relationships of the different groups of bats have been the subject of much debate. The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflects the view that these groups of bats have evolved independently of each other for a long time, from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]] that was already capable of flight. This hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group.<ref name=simmons2008>{{cite journal|unused_data=14 February 2008|journal=Nature| doi=10.1038/nature06549|title=Primitive Early Eocene bat from Wyoming and the evolution of flight and echolocation|author=Nancy B.

Researchers have proposed alternate views of chiropteran phylogeny and [[Biological classification|classification]], but more research is needed.

[[Genetics|Genetic]] evidence indicates that megabats originated during the early [[Eocene]] and should be placed within the four major lines of microbats.

Consequently, two new suborders based on molecular data have been proposed. The new suborder [[Yinpterochiroptera]] includes the [[Megabat|Pteropodidae]] or megabat family as well as the [[Horseshoe bat|Rhinolophidae]], [[Hipposideridae]], [[Craseonycteridae]], [[Megadermatidae]], and [[Rhinopomatidae]] families. The new suborder [[Yangochiroptera]] includes all the remaining families of bats (all of which use laryngeal echolocation). These two new suborders are strongly supported by statistical tests. Teeling (2005) found 100% bootstrap support in all maximum likelihood analyses for the division of Chiroptera into these two modified suborders. This conclusion is further supported by a fifteen-base pair deletion in BRCA1 and a seven-base pair deletion in PLCB4 present in all Yangochiroptera and absent in all Yinpterochiroptera.<ref>Teeling et al. 2005. A Molecular Phylogeny for Bats Illuminates Biogeography and the Fossil Record. Science 307: 580<U+2013>584.</ref> The Chiropteran phylogeny based on molecular evidence is controversial because microbat paraphyly implies that one of two seemingly unlikely hypotheses occurred. The first suggests that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice in Chiroptera, once in Yangochiroptera and once in the rhinolophoids.<ref>Teeling et al. 2000. Molecular evidence regarding the origin of echolocation and flight in bats.

Integrated fossil and molecular data reconstruct bat echolocation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 98: 6241<U+2013>6246.</ref>

[[Image:Pipistrellus pipistrellus01.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Common Pipistrelle]], ''Pipistrellus pipistrellus''.]]

Analyses of the sequence of the "vocalization" gene, ''FoxP2'' was inconclusive of whether laryngeal echolocation was secondarily lost in the pteropodids or independently gained in the echolocating lineages.<ref>Li et al. 2007. "Accelerated FoxP2 Evolution in Echolocating Bats". PLOS ONE.</ref> However, analyses of the "hearing" gene, ''Prestin'' seemed to favor the independent gain in echolocating species rather than a secondary loss in the pteropodids.<ref>Li et al. 2008. "The hearing gene Prestin reunites the echolocating bats". Proc. Natl. Academy. Sci. U.S.A.</ref>

In addition to Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, the names Pteropodiformes and Vespertilioniformes have also been proposed for these suborders.<ref name="hutchkirsch2006">{{cite web| url=http://www.bio.georgiasouthern.edu/bio-home/hutcheon/hutchkirsch2006.pdf |title=A moveable face: deconstructing the Microchiroptera and a new classification of extant bats |author=James M.

In the 1980s, a hypothesis based on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] evidence was offered that stated that the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera. The so-called [[flying primates theory]] proposed that when adaptations to flight are removed, the Megachiroptera are allied to [[primate]]s by anatomical features that are not shared with Microchiroptera. One example is that the brains of megabats show a number of advanced characteristics that link them to primates. Although recent genetic studies support the monophyly of bats,<ref>{{cite web | title=Primitive Early Eocene bat from Wyoming and the evolution of flight and echolocation | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/abs/nature06549.html | accessdate=2008-07-03 | date=2008-02-14 | work=Nature}}</ref> debate continues as to the meaning of available genetic and morphological evidence.<ref name="pmid18367343">{{cite journal |author=Pettigrew JD, Maseko BC, Manger PR |title=Primate-like retinotectal decussation in an echolocating megabat, Rousettus aegyptiacus |journal=Neuroscience |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=226<U+2013>31 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18367343 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.02.019 |url=}}</ref>

Little fossil evidence is available to help map the [[evolution]] of bats, since their small, delicate [[skeleton]]s do not fossilize very well. However a [[Late Cretaceous]] tooth from South America resembles that of an early Microchiropteran bat. The oldest known definitely identified bat fossils, such as ''[[Icaronycteris]]'', ''[[Archaeonycteris]]'', ''[[Palaeochiropteryx]]'' and ''[[Hassianycteris]]'', are from the early [[Eocene]] period, {{Ma|52.5}}.<ref name=simmons2008/> These fossil bats were already very similar to modern microbats. ''Archaeopteropus'', formerly classified as the earliest known megachiropteran, is now classified as a microchiropteran.

Bats were formerly grouped in the superorder [[Archonta]] along with the [[treeshrew]]s (Scandentia), [[colugo]]s (Dermoptera), and the [[primate]]s, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic studies have now placed bats in the superorder [[Laurasiatheria]] along with [[carnivora]]ns, [[pangolin]]s, [[odd-toed ungulate]]s, [[even-toed ungulate]]s, and [[cetacea]]ns.<ref name="classification"/>

Megabats primarily eat fruit or nectar. In New Guinea, they are likely to have evolved for some time in the absence of microbats. This has resulted in some smaller megabats of the genus ''[[Nyctimene (genus)|Nyctimene]]'' becoming (partly) insectivorous to fill the vacant microbat ecological niche. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the fruit bat genus ''[[Pteralopex]]'' from the [[Solomon Islands]], and its close relative ''[[Fijian Monkey-faced Bat|Mirimiri]]'' from [[Fiji]], have evolved to fill some niches that were open because there are no nonvolant or non-flying mammals in those islands.

===Fossil bats===
There are few fossilized remains of bats, as they are terrestrial and light-boned. An [[Eocene]] bat, ''[[Onychonycteris|Onychonycteris finneyi]]'', was found in the fifty-two-million-year-old [[Green River Formation]] in South Dakota, United States, in 2004.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7243502.stm (''BBC News'') "Bat fossil solves evolution poser"] 13 February 2008.</ref> It had characteristics indicating that it could [[Flying and gliding animals|fly]], yet the well-preserved skeleton showed that the [[cochlea]] of the inner ear lacked development needed to support the greater hearing abilities of modern bats. This provided evidence that flight in bats developed well before echolocation. The team that found the remains of this species, named ''Onychonycteris finneyi'', recognized that it lacked ear and throat features present not only in echolocating bats today, but also in other known [[prehistory|prehistoric]] species. Fossil remains of another [[Eocene]] bat, ''[[Icaronycteris]]'', were found in 1960.

The appearance and flight movement of bats 52.5 million years ago were different from those of bats today. ''Onychonycteris'' had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws appearing on two digits of each hand. It also had longer hind legs and shorter forearms, similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches such as [[sloth]]s and [[gibbon]]s. This palm-sized bat had broad, short wings suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. Instead of flapping its wings continuously while flying, ''Onychonycteris'' likely alternated between flaps and glides while in the air. Such physical characteristics suggest that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats do, rather flying from tree to tree and spending most of its waking day climbing or hanging on the branches of trees.<ref>[http://www.discoverychannel.ca/reports/article.aspx?aid=7047 (''Discovery Channel article'') "Prehistoric bats learned to fly before they could see"] February 13, 2008.{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

==Habitats==
Flight has enabled bats to become one of the most widely distributed groups of mammals.  Apart from the Arctic, the Antarctic and a few isolated oceanic islands, bats exists all over the world.<ref>{{cite web

Bats are found in almost every habitat available on Earth.  Different species select different habitat during different seasons&nbsp;<U+2014> ranging from seasides to mountains and even deserts&nbsp;<U+2014> but bat habitats have two basic requirements: roosts, where they spend the day or hibernate, and places for foraging.  Bat roosts can be found in hollows, crevices, foliage, and even human-made structures; and include "tents" that bats construct by biting leaves.

===Echolocation===
[[Image:PipiBat.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Spectrogram]] of Pipistrellus Bat vocalizations.  Detail is shown as the pulse [[duty cycle]] increases during a close approach to prey.  The bat appears to use a hybrid pulse which combines a sharp falling frequency [[chirp]] with an extended constant frequency tail.  Such a [[waveform]] may offer combined benefits of range estimation as well as Doppler shift detection.  Spectrogram generated with Fatpigdog's PC based [http://www.fatpigdog.com/SpectrumAnalyzer/ Real Time FFT Spectrum Analyzer]. {{Listen|filename=Pipistrellus.ogg|title=Pipistrellus Pulses|description=Recording of Pipistrellus bat approaching its prey.|format=[[Ogg]]}}]] Bat echolocation is a perceptual system where ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes the brain and auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize and even classify their prey in complete darkness. At 130 decibels in intensity, bat calls are some of the most intense airborne animal sounds.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones, K. E., O. R. P. Bininda-Emonds, and J. L. Gittleman |title=Bats, clocks, and rocks: diversification patterns in chiroptera |journal=Evolution |volume=59 |year=2005 |pages=2243<U+2013>2255 |pmid=16405167 |issue=10 }}</ref>

To clearly distinguish returning information, bats must be able to separate their calls from the echoes they receive. Microbats use two distinct approaches.
# Low Duty Cycle Echolocation: Bats can separate their calls and returning echos by time. Bats that use this approach time their short calls to finish before echoes return.  This is important because these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call so that they can avoid deafening themselves.  The time interval between call and echo allows them to relax these muscles so they can clearly hear the returning echo.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Teeling, E. C. |title=Hear, hear: the convergent evolution of echolocation in bats? |journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution |volume=24 |year=2009 |pages=351<U+2013>354 |doi=10.1016/J.Tree.2009.02.012 |pmid=19482373 |issue=7}}</ref>  The delay of the returning echos provide the bat with the ability to estimate range to their prey.
# High Duty Cycle Echolocation: Bats emit a continuous call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned to a specific frequency range. They emit calls outside of this range to avoid self-deafening. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range by taking advantage of the [[Doppler shift]] of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning echos yield information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey.  These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones, G., and M. W. Holderied |title=Bat echolocation calls: adaptation and convergent evolution |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B-Biological Sciences |volume=274 |year=2007 |pages=905<U+2013>912 |doi=10.1098/Rspb.2006.0200 |pmid=17251105 |issue=1612 |pmc=1919403}}</ref>

The new Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera classification of bats that are supported by molecular evidence, suggest two possibilities for the evolution of echolocation. It may have been gained once in a common ancestor of all bats and was then subsequently lost in the Old World fruit bats, only to be regained in the Horse-Shoe bats; or echolocation was evolved independent in both the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochirpotera lineages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DesRoche, K., M. B. Fenton, and W. C. Lancaster |title=Echolocation and the thoracic skeletons of bats: a comparative morphological study |journal=Acta Chiropterologica |volume=9 |year=2007 |pages=483<U+2013>494 |doi=10.3161/1733-5329(2007)9[483:EATTSO]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref>

Two groups of [[moth]]s exploit a bat sense to echolocate: [[Arctiidae|tiger moths]] produce [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] signals to warn the bats that they (the moths) are chemically protected or [[aposematic]]. This was once thought to be the biological equivalent of "[[radar jamming]]", but this theory has yet to be confirmed. The moths [[Noctuidae]] have a hearing organ called a [[tympanal organ|tympanum]], which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive manoeuvres.

===Other senses===
Although the [[eye]]s of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor [[visual acuity]], none of them are blind. Vision is used to navigate microbats especially for long distances when beyond the range of echolocation. It has even been discovered that some species are able to detect [[ultraviolet]] light. They also have a high quality sense of smell and hearing. Bats hunt at night to avoid competition with birds, and travel large distances at most 800&nbsp;km, in their search for food.<ref name=molecule/>

===Wings===
[[Image:wiki bat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Thermographic image of a bat using trapped air as insulation.]]

The finger bones of bats are much more flexible than those of other mammals. One reason is that the [[cartilage]] in their fingers lacks [[calcium]] and other [[mineral]]s nearer the tips, increasing their ability to bend without splintering. The cross-section of the finger bone is also flattened compared to the circular cross section that human finger bones have, and is very flexible. The skin on their wing membranes has more elasticity and so can stretch much more than other mammals.

The wings of bats are much thinner than those of birds, so bats can maneuver more quickly and more accurately than birds. It is also delicate, ripping easily.<ref name=ideas>{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=W.C. |year=2006 |month=October |title=Facts and ideas from anywhere |journal=Proceedings (Baylor University.

This receptor cell is sensitive to the stretching of the membrane.<ref name=Calhoun2005/> The cells are concentrated in areas of the membrane where insects hit the wings when the bats capture them.

===Other===
The teeth of microbats resemble [[insectivora]]ns. They are very sharp to bite through the [[sclerotization|hardened]] armor of insects or the skin of fruit.

Mammals have one-way valves in [[vein]]s to prevent the blood from flowing backwards, but bats also have one-way valves in [[artery|arteries]].

One species of bat has the longest [[tongue]] of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial to them in terms of pollination and feeding. Their long narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some [[flower]]s. When their tongue retracts, it coils up inside their rib cage.<ref name="NGtongue">{{cite web

==Behaviour==
Most microbats are nocturnal and are active at twilight. A large portion of bats [[Bird migration|migrate]] hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens,<ref name=MBF>{{cite book |last=Fenton |first=M. Brock |year=2001 |title= Bats|publisher= Checkmark Books|location=New York|pages= 60<U+2013>62|isbn= 0-8160-4358-2}}</ref> some pass into [[torpor]] in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active.<ref name=MBF2>{{cite book |last=Fenton |first=M.

The social structure of bats varies, with some bats leading a solitary life and others living in caves colonized by more than a million bats.<ref name=MBF3>{{cite book |last=Fenton |first=M. Brock |year=2001 |title= Bats|publisher= Checkmark Books|location=New York|pages= 95<U+2013>107|isbn= 0-8160-4358-2}}</ref> The [[fission-fusion society|fission-fusion social structure]] is seen among several species of bats. The term "fusion" refers to a large numbers of bats that congregate together in one roosting area and "fission" refers to breaking up and the mixing of subgroups, with individual bats switching roosts with others and often ending up in different trees and with different roostmates.

Studies also show that bats make all kinds of sounds to communicate with others. Scientists in the field have listened to bats and have been able to identify some sounds with some behaviour bats will make after the sounds are made.<ref name=MBF3/>

70% of bat species are insectivorous, locating their prey by means of [[Animal echolocation#Bats|echolocation]]. Of the remainder, most feed on [[fruit]]s.<ref name=MBF4/> Only three species sustain themselves with [[blood]]. Some species even prey on [[vertebrate]]s: these are the [[leaf-nosed bat]]s (''Phyllostomidae'') of [[Central America]] and [[South America]], and the two [[bulldog bat]] (''Noctilionidae'') species, which feed on [[fish]]. At least two species of bat are known to feed on bats: the [[Spectral Bat]], also known as the American False Vampire bat, and the [[Ghost Bat]] of [[Australia]].<ref name=MBF4>{{cite book |last=Fenton |first=M. Brock |year=2001 |title= Bats|publisher= Checkmark Books|location=New York|pages= 4<U+2013>5|isbn= 0-8160-4358-2}}</ref> One species, the [[Greater Noctule bat]], catches and eats small [[bird]]s in the air.

Predators of bats include [[Bat Hawk|bat hawk]]s and [[Bat Falcon|bat falcon]]s.

===Reproduction===
[[File:Pipistrellus pipistrellus baby.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Newborn Common Pipistrelle, ''Pipistrellus pipistrellus''.]]
[[Image:Myotis myotis, nursery roost.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Colony of [[Mouse-eared bats]], ''Myotis myotis''.]]

Most bats have a breeding season, which is in the spring for species living in a temperate climate. Bats may have one to three litters in a season, depending on the species and on environmental conditions such as the availability of food and roost sites. Females generally have one offspring at a time, which could be a result of the mother's need to fly to feed while pregnant. Female bats nurse their youngsters until they are nearly adult size; this is because a young bat cannot forage on its own until its wings are fully developed.

Female bats use a variety of strategies to control the timing of pregnancy and the birth of young, to make delivery coincide with maximum food ability and other ecological factors. Females of some species have delayed fertilization, in which sperm are stored in the reproductive tract for several months after mating. In many such cases, mating occurs in the fall, and fertilization does not occur until the following spring. Other species exhibit delayed implantation, in which the egg is fertilized after mating, but remains free in the reproductive tract until external conditions become favorable for giving birth and caring for the offspring. In yet another strategy, fertilization and implantation both occur but development of the fetus is delayed until favorable conditions prevail. All of these adaptations result in the pup being born during a time of high local production of fruit or insects.

At birth the wings are too small to be used for flight. Young [[microbat]]s become independent at the age of 6 to 8 weeks, while [[megabat]]s do not until they are four months old.

A single bat can live over 20 years, but the bat population growth is limited by the slow [[birth rate]].<ref>http://www.batworld.org/main/main.html Retrieved 22 October 2006.</ref>

===Hunting, feeding, and drinking===
[[File:BAT.young-Tamil Nadu-202.ogv|150px|A very young bat in [[Tamil Nadu]].|thumb|right]]
Newborn bats rely on the milk from their mother<U+2019>s nipples for sustenance.<ref name="Wilson BiQ 1997">Wilson, Don. Bats in Question. London: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997</ref> When they are a few weeks old, bats are expected to fly and hunt on their own. It is up to them to find and catch their prey, along with satisfying their thirst.<ref name="Lauber P 1968">Lauber, Patricia. Bats: Wings in the Night. New York: Random House, 1968</ref>

====Hunting====
Most bats are nocturnal creatures. Their daylight hours are spent grooming, sleeping, and resting; it is during the nighttime hours that they hunt. The means by which bats navigate while finding and catching their prey in the dark was unknown until the 1790s, when [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] conducted a series of experiments on a group of blind bats. These bats were placed in a room submerged in total darkness, with silk threads strung across the room. Even then, the bats were able to navigate their way through the room. Spallanzani concluded that the bats were not using their eyes to fly through complete darkness, but something else.

Spallanzani decided that bats were able to catch and find their prey through the use of their ears. To prove this theory, Spallanzani plugged the ears of the bats in his experiment. To his pleasure, he found that the bats with plugged ears were not able to fly with the same amount of skill and precision that they were able to without their ears plugged.

Bats seem to use their ears to locate and catch their prey, but how they accomplish this wasn<U+2019>t discovered until the 1930s, by one Donald R. Griffin. Griffin, who was a biology student at Harvard College at the time, discovered that bats use echolocation to locate and catch their prey. When bats fly, they produce a constant stream of high-pitched sounds that only bats are able to hear. When the sound waves produced by these sounds hit an insect or other animal, the echoes bounce back to the bat, and guide them to the source.<ref name="Lauber P 1968"/>

====Feeding and diet====
The majority of food consumed by bats includes insects, fruits and flower nectar, vertebrates and blood.<ref name="ReferenceA">Johnson, Sylvia. Bats. Minneapolis: Lerner Publications Company, 1985</ref> Almost three-fourths of the world<U+2019>s bats are insect eaters. Insects consumed by bats include both aerial insects, and ground-dwelling insects. Each bat is typically able to consume one third of its body weight in insects each night, and several hundred insects in a few hours. This means that a group of one thousand bats could eat four tons of insects each year. If bats were to become extinct, the insect population is calculated to reach an alarmingly high number.<ref name="ReferenceB">Shebar, Sharon. Bats. New York: Franklin Watts, 1990</ref>

=====Vitamin C=====
In a test of 34 bat species from six major families of bats, including major insect and fruit-eating bat families, found that bats in all tested families have lost the ability to make vitamin C, and this loss may derive from a common bat ancestor, as a single mutation.<ref>A trace of GLO was detected in only 1 of 34 bat species tested, across the range of 6 families of bats tested: See Jenness, R., E. Birney, and K. Ayaz. 1980. Variation of L-gulonolactone oxidase activity in placental mammals. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology 67B:195-204. Earlier reports of only fruit bats being deficient were based on smaller samples.</ref>

=====Aerial insectivores=====
Watching a bat catch and eat an insect is difficult. The action is so fast that all one sees is a bat rapidly change directions, and continue on its way. Scientist Frederick A. Webster discovered how bats catch their prey. In 1960, Webster developed a high-speed camera that was able to take one thousand pictures per second. These photos revealed the fast and precise way in which bats catch insects.<ref name="Lauber P 1968"/> Occasionally, a bat will catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, and eat it in the air. However, more often than not, a bat will use its tail membrane or wings to scoop up the insect and trap it in a sort of <U+201C>bug net<U+201D>.<ref name="Wilson BiQ 1997"/> Then, the bat will take the insect back to its roost. There, the bat will proceed to eat said insect, often using its tail membrane as a kind of napkin, to prevent its meal from falling to the ground.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

=====Forage gleaners (diet of non-flying insects)=====
These bats typically fly down and grasp their prey off the ground with their teeth, and take it to a nearby perch to eat it. Generally, these bats don<U+2019>t use echolocation to locate their prey. Instead, they rely on the sounds produced by the insects. Some make unique sounds, and almost all make some noise while moving through the environment.<ref name="Wilson BiQ 1997"/>

=====Fruits and flower nectar=====
[[File:Great Fruit-eating Bat (Artibeus lituratus).jpg|thumb|upright|A colony of [[Great Fruit-eating Bat]]s]]
Fruit-eating, or frugivory, is a specific habit found in two families of bats. Megachiropterans and microchiropterans both include species of bat that feed on fruits. These bats feed on the juices of sweet fruits, and fulfill the needs of some seeds to be dispersed. The fruits preferred by most fruit-eating bats are fleshy and sweet, but not particularly strong smelling or colorful.<ref name="Wilson BiQ 1997"/> To get the juice of these fruits, bats pull the fruit off the trees with their teeth, and fly back to their roost with the fruit in their mouth. There, the bat will consume the fruit in a specific way. To do this, the bats crush open the fruit and eat the parts that satisfy their hunger. The remainder of the fruit; the seeds and pulp, are spat onto the ground. These seeds take root and begin to grow into new fruit trees.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> <U+201C>Over one hundred and fifty types of plants depend on bats in order to reproduce<U+201D>.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Some bats prefer the nectar of flowers to insects or other animals. These bats have evolved specifically for this purpose. For example, these bats possess long muzzles and long extrusible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants.<ref name="Wilson BiQ 1997"/> When they sip the nectar from these flowers, pollen gets stuck to their fur, and is dusted off when the bat takes flight, thus pollinating the plants below them.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The rainforest is said to be the most benefitted out off all the biomes that bats live in, because of the large variety of appealing plants.<ref>Hodgkison, Robert, Sharon T. Balding, Akbar Zuibad, and Thomas H. Kunz. "Fruit Bats (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) as Seed Dispersers and Pollinators in a Lowland Malaysian Rain Forest." Biotropica 35.4 (2003): 491<U+2013>502</ref> Because of their specific eating habits, nectar-feeding bats are more prone to extinction than any other type of bat.<ref>Arita, Hector T., and Karina Santos-del-Prado. "Conservation Biology of Nectar-Feeding Bats in Mexico." Journal of Mammalogy 80.1 (1999): 31<U+2013>41</ref> However, according to a study, bats benefit from eating fruits and nectar just as much from eating insects.<ref>M, L. Gerardo H., Keith A. Hobson, Adriana M. A, Daniel E. B, Victor Sanchez-Corero, and German M. C. "The Role of Fruits and Insects in the Nutrition of Frugivorous Bats: Evaluating the Use of Stable Isotope Models." Biotropica 33.3 (2001): 520<U+2013>28</ref>

=====Vertebrates=====
Although most bats are not included in this group, there is a small group of carnivorous bats which feed on other vertebrates and are considered the top carnivores of the bat world.<ref name="Wilson BiQ 1997"/> These bats typically eat a variety of animals, but normally consume frogs, lizards, birds, and sometimes other bats.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> For example, one vertebrate predator, ''Trachops cirrhosus'', is particularly skilled at catching frogs. These bats locate large groups of frogs by distinguishing their mating calls from other sounds around them. They follow the sounds to the source and pluck them from the surface of the water with their sharp canine teeth.<ref name="Wilson BiQ 1997"/> Another example is the [[Greater Noctule bat]] which is believed to catch birds on the wing.

There are also several species of bat that feed on fish. These types of bats are found on almost all continents. They use echolocation to detect tiny ripples in the water<U+2019>s surface to locate fish. From there, the bats swoop down low, inches from the water, and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish out of the water. The bats then take the fish to a feeding roost and consume the animal.<ref name="Wilson BiQ 1997"/>

=====Blood=====
There are a few species of bat that consume blood exclusively as their diet. This type of diet is referred to as hematophagy, and three species of bat exhibit this behavior. These species include the [[Common Vampire Bat]], the [[White-winged Vampire Bat]], and the [[Hairy-legged Vampire Bat]]. The Common Vampire Bat typically consumes the blood of mammals, while the Hairy-legged and White-winged feed on the blood of birds.<ref>Greenhall, Arthur M. 1961. Bats in Agriculture. A Ministry of Agriculture Publication. Trinidad and Tobago</ref>

====Results of eating====
Bats<U+2019> dung, or [[guano]], is so rich in nutrients, that it is mined from caves, bagged, and used by farmers to fertilize their crops. Also, guano was used in the [[U.S. Civil War]] to make [[gunpowder]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

There comes a time in the year that some bats will not eat to supply themselves with food for the night, but for the coming months. These bats are beginning to hibernate. To do this, the bat will eat as much food as its body can contain, being as fat as possible. The bat<U+2019>s body then takes from the supply of fat for energy, but very slowly, because all body activities have slowed down. This supply of fat will last until the spring season arrives.<ref name="Lauber P 1968"/>

====Drinking====
Generally, bats drink water. In 1960, Frederic A. Webster discovered how bats are able to acquire this water. To do this, Webster developed a high-speed camera and flashgun that could take one thousand photos per second. Webster's camera captured the bat's method of skimming the surface of a body of water, and lowering its jaw to get just one drop of water. It then skims again to get a second drop of water, and then again to get a third, and so on, until it has had its fill of water. Its precision and control is very fine, and it almost never misses.<ref name="Lauber P 1968"/> Other bats such as the [[flying fox]] or [[fruit bat]] gently skim the water's surface, then land nearby to lick water from their chest fur.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jones |first=V. |title=Drinking in the river|url=http://www.bellingen.com/flyingfoxes |year=2000 |publisher=Vivian Jones |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref>

==Conservation efforts==
Through conservancy efforts, such as the [[Organization for Bat Conservation]], bats are becoming better understood and people beginning to understand the crucial role bats play in insect control and pollination.

In the [[United Kingdom]] all bats are protected under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act]]s, and even disturbing a bat or its roost can be punished with a heavy fine.

In [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]] bats are protected species under the Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998 (see [[Malaysian Wildlife Law]]). The large Naked bat (see [[Mammals of Borneo]]) and Greater Nectar bat are consumed by the local communities.

Bats can be a tourist attraction. The [[Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge|Congress Avenue Bridge]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] is the summer home to [[North America]]'s largest urban bat colony, an estimated 1,500,000 [[Mexican free-tailed bat]]s, which eat an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 pounds of insects each night. An estimated 100,000 tourists per year visit the bridge at twilight to watch the bats leave the roost.

===Artificial roosts===
[[Image:06-09TlhFLBatHouse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Very large bat house, Tallahassee, Florida, United States.]]
Many people put up bat houses to attract bats just like many people put up [[Nest box|birdhouses]] to attract birds. Reasons for this vary, but mostly center around the fact that bats are the primary nocturnal insectivores in most if not all ecologies. Bat houses can be made from scratch, made from kits, or bought ready made. Plans for bat houses exist on many web sites, as well as guidelines for designing a bat house.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20020124162143/www.batcon.org/</ref> Some conservation societies are giving away free bat houses to bat enthusiasts worldwide{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

In Britain, [[British hardened field defences of World War II]] have been converted to make roosts for bats. Pillboxes that are well dug-in and thick walled are naturally damp and provide a stable thermal environment that is required by bats that would otherwise hibernate in caves. With a few minor modifications, suitable pillboxes can be converted to artificial caves for bats.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.eurobats.org/documents/pdf/AC9/Doc_AC9_15_Protecting_underground_sites.pdf| title=Protecting and managing underground sites for bats (pdf), see section 6.4.| accessdate=2006-05-18|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4885642.stm| title=Pillbox converted to bat retreat, BBC website| accessdate=2006-05-18 | date=2006-04-06}}</ref>

Again in the UK, purpose-built bat houses are occasionally built when existing roosts are destroyed by developments such as new roads; one such has been built associated with [[bat bridge]]s on the new (2008) A38 [[Dobwalls]] bypass.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

}} Note: This could be considered a lay summary of the various scientific publications cited in the preceding sentence.</ref> Their high mobility, broad distribution, and social behaviour (communal roosting, fission-fusion social structure) make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Many species also appear to have a high tolerance for harbouring pathogens and often do not develop disease while infected. However, contrary to folklore, this is not true of rabies, which is as fatal to bats as it is to all other species. However, a bat may be ill with rabies for a longer time than other mammals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In regions where rabies is endemic, only 0.5% of bats carry the disease. However, of the few cases of [[rabies]] reported in the [[United States]] every year not caused by dogs, most are caused by bat [[bite (medicine)|bites]].<ref name="CDC1999">{{cite journal

Although one should not have an unreasonable [[fear of bats]], one should avoid handling them or having them in one's living space, as with any wild animal. If a bat is found in living quarters near a child, mentally handicapped person, intoxicated person, sleeping person, or pet, the person or pet should receive immediate medical attention for rabies. Bats have very small teeth and can bite a sleeping person without being felt. There is evidence that it is possible for the bat rabies virus to infect victims purely through airborne transmission, without direct physical contact of the victim with the bat itself.<ref name="cons">{{cite journal

If a bat is found in a house and the possibility of exposure cannot be ruled out, the bat should be sequestered and an animal control officer called immediately, so that the bat can be analysed. This also applies if the bat is found dead. If it is certain that nobody has been exposed to the bat, it should be removed from the house. The best way to do this is to close all the doors and windows to the room except one that opens to the outside. The bat should soon leave.

Due to the risk of rabies and also due to health problems related to their faecal droppings ([[guano]]), bats should be excluded from inhabited parts of houses. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] provides full detailed information on all aspects of bat management, including how to capture a bat, what to do in case of exposure, and how to bat-proof a house humanely.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/bats.html Center for Disease Control's website on bats and rabies]</ref> In certain countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], it is illegal to handle bats without a license.

Where rabies is not endemic, as throughout most of [[Western Europe]], small bats can be considered harmless. Larger bats can give a nasty bite. They should be treated with the respect due to any wild animal.

==Mythology==
[[Image:NightwingSculpture.JPG|thumb|275px|"Nightwing," a work of art by Dale Whistler in [[Austin, Texas]].]]

The bat is sacred in [[Tonga]] and is often considered the physical manifestation of a separable [[soul]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. Bats are closely associated with [[vampire]]s, who are said to be able to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into bats, [[fog]], or [[wolf|wolves]]. Bats are also a symbol of [[ghost]]s, [[death]], and [[disease]]. Among some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], such as the [[Creek (people)|Creek]], [[Cherokee]] and [[Apache Tribe|Apache]], the bat is a [[trickster]] spirit.

[[China|Chinese]] lore claims the bat is a symbol of longevity and happiness, and is similarly lucky in [[Poland]] and geographical [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and among the [[Kwakiutl]] and [[Arab]]s. The bat is also a heraldic animal of the Spanish autonomous community of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]].

[[Pre-Columbian]] cultures associated animals with gods and often displayed them in art. The [[Moche]] people depicted bats in their ceramics.<ref>Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueol<U+00F3>gico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames and Hudson]], 1997.</ref>

In [[Western Culture]], the bat is often a symbol of the night and its foreboding nature. The bat is a primary animal associated with fictional characters of the night, both [[villain]]s like [[Dracula]] and [[hero]]es like [[Batman]]. The association of the fear of the night with the animal was treated as a literary challenge by [[Kenneth Oppel]], who created a best selling series of novels, beginning with ''[[Silverwing (novel)|Silverwing]]'', which feature bats as the central heroic figures much as anthropomorphized [[rabbit]]s were the central figures to the classic [[novel]] ''[[Watership Down]]''.

An [[old wives' tale]] has it that bats will entangle themselves in people's hair. One likely source of this belief is that insect-eating bats seeking prey may dive erratically toward people, who attract [[mosquito]]es and [[gnat]]s, leading the squeamish to believe that the bats are trying to get in their hair.

===Mesoamerica===
[[Image:Mochebat.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bat, Moche Culture 100 A.D. [[Larco Museum]] [[Lima]], [[Peru]].]]

In [[Mesoamerica]]n [[mythology]] during the Classic-Contemporary period, bats symbolized the land of the dead, which was considered to be the underworld.<ref>http://www.aztec-history.net/aztec_symbols</ref> They also symbolized destruction and decay. Bats may have symbolized in this way because they fly only at night and dwell in caves during the daytime and are associated with human skulls and bones by classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ceramists. Central Mexicans sometimes depicted bats having snouts that looked like ''sacrificial knives and carrying human head'' in the Postclassic era.<ref>Kay Almere Read and Jason J. Gonzalez. 2000. Mesoamerican Mythology. Oxford University Press. pp. 132</ref> Bat images were engraved onto funerary urns and were emphasized with large claws and round ears by [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]]. They were commonly associated with death.<ref>http://www.oaxacanwoodcarving.com/mythnatr.html</ref> The depiction of bats on funeral urns and goods took on some the characteristics of the [[jaguar]] which was and still is another entity of the night and the underworld. There have also been instances where bats are portrayed next to other unseemly animals including [[scorpion]]s and other nocturnal animals such as [[owl]]s.

A gigantic, life-size ceramic bat-man has been discovered and dug up from the [[Templo Mayor]]. The [[Templo Mayor]] is located in the center of the [[Mexica]] capital of [[Tenochtitlan]]. Known as a god of death, this statue has the clawed feet and hands of a bat, but the body of a man. The statue's human-like eyes bulged out from the bat-like head, making the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] images very realistic and living. It was said that in the 1930s the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] Maya proclaimed that the bat was the Devil<U+2019>s provider. [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] would leave the Devil<U+2019>s underworld home and collect blood from the animals to be used for scrumptious meals to feed the Devil. <U+201C>In the myths, the beast of prey and the animal that is preyed upon play two significant roles. They represent two aspects of life<U+2014>the aggressive, killing, conquering, creating aspect of life, and the one that is the matter or, you might say, the subject matter<U+201D>.<ref>Joseph Cambell and Bill Moyers. 1988. The Power of Myth. Doubleday. pp. 91</ref> In the Devil<U+2019>s underworld, dead sinners would work off their sins in order to get to heaven, indicating that the bat was too a sinner and worked under the authority of the Devil.<ref name="Jason J. Gonzalez 2000. pp. 132-134">Kay Almere Read and Jason J. Gonzalez. 2000. Mesoamerican Mythology. Oxford University Press. pp. 132<U+2013>134</ref>

===Oaxaca===
[[Oaxaca]]ns believe that the jealousy of the bat in wanting birds' feathers that gently fit their bodies led him to become nocturnal. The bat feeling isolated and undesirable spoke to God after that he complained he was extremely cold. God, fair and just turned to birds in the animal kingdom and asked if they would show compassion and donate a feather to the bat so the feathers would keep him warm. The birds all agreed, and began to pluck one feather from their bodies to give to the bat. With all of the feathers, the bat became much magnificent looking than all birds, even able to spread color to the night sky. During daylight, the bat created rainbows that reflected vibrant colors from the sun. The bat soon became overly arrogant and conceited, due having this new and improved look. The birds grew tired of the bat<U+2019>s self conceitedness and glorification, and so decided to fly up to heaven and speak to God to do something. The birds informed to God of the bat's behaviour, God was surprised and so decided to take a look himself. When on Earth, God called on the bat to show him what he was doing. The bat began to fly across the light blue sky, where one by one each feather began to fall out, uncovering the bat<U+2019>s natural ugly looking body. The bat became ashamed and distressed of his appearance after all feathers came off, missing the beautiful, plentiful feathers that he had, that he decided to hide in caves during the day. He would only come out during the night, searching high and low for the feathers to avoid embarrassment that he will not be seen during his search.<ref name="Jason J. Gonzalez 2000. pp. 132-134"/>

===East Nigeria===
According to a particular East Nigerian tale, the bat developed its nocturnal habits after causing the death of his partner the bush-[[rat]]. The bat and the bush-rat would share activities such as rummaging through the [[grass]] and [[tree]]s, hunting, talking and bonding during the day. When at night, the bat and the bush-rat would alternate in cooking duties cooking what was caught, and eat together. It appeared to a dedicated partnership, however the bat hated the bush-rat immensely.
The bush rat always found the bat<U+2019>s [[soup]] more appetising so when eating dinner one night asked the bat why the soup tasted better than his own and also asked how it was made. The bat agreed to show him how to make it the next day but instead was forming a malicious plan.

Next day as bat prepared his soup, the bush-rat came, greeting him and asked if he could be shown what was agreed yesterday. Earlier, the bat has found a pot looking exactly like the one he used usually, but it held warm water and so decided to use this instead. The bat explained to the bush-rat that to make his soup, he had to boil himself prior to serving the soup where sweetness and flavor of the soup came from the [[flesh]]. The bat jumped in the pot seemingly excited, with the bush-rat mesmerised. After a few minutes the bat climbed out and while the bush-rat was distracted, switched pots. The bat then served his soup out of the soup pot, both tasted it. Over anxious and eager, the bush-rat, jumped into the pot of warm water. He stayed much longer in the pot dying in the process.

When the bush-rat<U+2019>s [[wife]] returned that night to find her [[husband]] dead, she wept and ran to the [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the land's house telling him about what happened and what she was sure what the bat had done. In hearing this, the chief became angry, ordering for the immediate arrest of the bat. It just so happened that the bat was flying over the house and overheard what was just said. He quickly went into hiding high up in a tree. When the chief<U+2019>s men went looking for the bat, he could not be found. The search to arrest the bat carried on over several days, but still could not be found. The bat needed to eat, so flew out of hiding every night to [[Hunting|hunt]] for [[food]] to escape of being arrested. This, according to Eastern Nigeria mythology, is why bats only fly at night.<ref>Arnott, Kathleen. 1962. African Myths and Legends. Oxford University Press. Pp. 150<U+2013>152</ref>

===Heraldry===
{{Main|Bat (heraldry)}}
[[File:Flag of rcnv.png|thumb|Burgee of the Royal Valencia Yacht Club.]]

The bat is sometimes used as a [[heraldry|heraldic symbol]]. The coats of arms of certain cities in eastern [[Spain]], like [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], [[Palma de Mallorca]] and [[Fraga]] have the bat over the shield. Formerly the [[Barcelona]] city coat of arms also had a bat crowning it, but the bat has been removed in the present-day versions.

The heraldic use of the bat in Valencia, [[Catalonia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] has its origins in a winged dragon ([[European dragon#Dragons in Catalan mythology|''vibra'']] or ''vibria''), which featured in [[James I of Aragon|King James I of Aragon]]'s helmet or [[:ca:Cimera del Casal de Barcelona|''cimera reial'']]. This is the most widely accepted theory, although there is also a legend that says that due to the intervention of a bat, King James was able to win a crucial battle against the [[Saracen]]s that allowed him to win Valencia for his kingdom.

The use of the bat as a heraldic symbol is prevalent in the territories of the former [[Crown of Aragon]] and it is little used elsewhere. However, it can be found in a few places, as in the coats of arms of the city of [[Albacete]], in Spain, as well as the town of [[Montchauvet, Yvelines|Montchauvet (Yvelines)]], in [[France]].

Certain Spanish [[soccer]] clubs including [[Valencia CF]] and [[Levante UD]] use bats in their badges.

The [[Burgee]] of the Royal Valencia Yacht Club (Reial Club N<U+00E0>utic de Val<U+00E8>ncia) displays a bat on a golden field in its center.

===In popular culture===
In [[Western Culture]], bats are a symbol of darkness and forbidden nature, something that is associated with fictional dark characters. For example: [[superheroes]] like [[Batman]], villains like [[Dracula]] and videogame characters like [[Rouge the Bat]] of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' videogame series]].

===State symbols===

Three U.S. states have an official [[U.S. state bats|state bat]].  Texas and Oklahoma are represented by the [[Mexican free-tailed bat]].  Virginia is represented by the [[Virginia big-eared bat]].<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.netstate.com/states/tables/state_bats.htm | title = Official state bats | accessdate = February 13, 2011 | work = netstate.com | publisher = NSTATE, LLC.|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x2xEXoK2 |archivedate=March 08, 2008}}</ref>
