The '''Desert Column''' was a [[British Empire]] army corps which operated in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of the [[First World War]]. The column had been formed in December 1916,<ref group="Note">Chetwode arrived on 22 December, 1916. There is no war diary for Desert Column for December. See [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1347]</ref> under the command of Lieutenant General [[Philip W. Chetwode]] as part of Eastern Force commanded by Lieutenant General [[Charles Dobell|C. M. Dobell]], part of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] commanded by General [[Archibald Murray|A. J. Murray]]. In mid 1917 when General [[Edmund Allenby]] took command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, Desert Column was reformed and renamed to become the [[Desert Mounted Corps]] commanded by Lieutenant General [[Harry Chauvel|Henry G. Chauvel]].

Chetwode was appointed on 7 December 1916 to command a force composed of the [[42nd (East Lancashire) Division]], the [[52nd (Lowland) Division]], the [[Anzac Mounted Division]] and the [[Imperial Camel Corps Brigade|Imperial Camel Brigade]] composed of eighteen companies, six of which were yeomen.<ref>Woodward 2006 p. 53</ref> Chetwode arrived El Arish to take up his appointment on 22 December 1916.<ref>Bruce 2002, p. 82</ref><ref>Powles 1922, p. 50</ref>
