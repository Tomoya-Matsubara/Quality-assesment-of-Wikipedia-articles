'''John Adair''' (January 9, 1757 {{ndash}} May 19, 1840) was an [[United States|American]] pioneer, soldier and statesman. He was the seventh [[governor of Kentucky]] and represented the state in both the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Adair enlisted in the state [[militia]] and served in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], where he was held captive by the British for a period of time. Following the war, he was elected as a delegate to South Carolina's convention to ratify the [[United States Constitution]]. 

Adair moved to Kentucky and became active in politics, serving a total of eight years in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]] between 1793 and 1803. He served as Speaker of the Kentucky House in 1802 and 1803, and was a delegate to the state's constitutional conventions in 1792 and 1799. He ascended to the United States Senate to fill the seat vacated when [[John Breckinridge (1760-1806)|John Breckinridge]] resigned to become [[Attorney General of the United States]]. He failed to win a full term in the subsequent election. Adair's promising political career was threatened when General [[James Wilkinson]] accused him of being involved in the [[Burr conspiracy]]. Although Adair was later cleared of any wrongdoing and Wilkinson was ordered to issue an apology, the negative publicity kept him out of politics for more than a decade.

Adair's participation in the [[War of 1812]] restored his reputation, and he returned to the state House in 1817. His commanding officer in the war, twice governor [[Isaac Shelby]], appointed him [[adjutant general]] of the state militia. In 1820, Adair was elected governor on a platform of financial relief for Kentuckians hit hard by the [[Panic of 1819]]. His primary measure toward this end was the creation of the Bank of the Commonwealth. Many of his other financial reforms were deemed unconstitutional by the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]]. Following his term as governor, Adair served one term in the United States House of Representatives, but did not run for re-election. He died May 19, 1840 at his farm in [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky|Harrodsburg]]. He is the namesake of several places, including [[Adair County, Kentucky]], [[Adair County, Missouri]], [[Adair County, Iowa]], and the towns of [[Adairville, Kentucky]] and [[Adair, Iowa]].

==Early life==
John Adair was born in [[Chester County, South Carolina]], a son of [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants Baron William and Mary (Moore) Adair.<ref name=harrison1>Harrison, p. 1</ref><ref name=smith168>Smith, p. 168</ref> He was educated at schools in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].<ref name=congbio>Congressional Bio</ref> Adair served in the South Carolina militia during the [[American Revolution]], and was held as a [[prisoner of war]] by the British.<ref name=collins>Collins, et al., pp. 165&ndash;166</ref> After the war, he was a delegate to the South Carolina convention to ratify the [[U.S. Constitution]].<ref name=congbio />

In 1784, he married Katherine Palmer.<ref name=bussey26>Bussey, p. 26</ref> They had twelve children, ten of them daughters.<ref name=bussey26 /> In 1788, Adair moved to [[Mercer County, Kentucky|Mercer County]] on the [[Kentucky]] frontier.<ref name=collins /> He led Kentucky militiamen in the Northwest Indian War against the [[Western Confederacy|Miami Confederacy]].<ref name=congbio /> Adair enrolled as a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]], but was promoted to [[major]] under General [[James Wilkinson]], and later to [[lieutenant colonel]] under [[Charles Scott (governor of Kentucky)|Charles Scott]].<ref name=smith168 /> He fought in several campaigns, and was present at the disastrous defeat by Chief [[Little Turtle]] near Fort St. Clair in [[Ohio]].<ref name=smith168 />

==Political career==
Adair was a delegate to the Kentucky constitutional conventions in 1792 and 1799.<ref name=harrison2>Harrison, p. 2</ref> Upon Kentucky's admission to the Union, he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1793 to 1795. He would serve in that body again in 1798 and from 1800 to 1803. In 1802 and 1803, he presided as Speaker of the Kentucky House.<ref name=congbio />

===Charged with disloyalty===
In 1805, Adair became registrar of the United States land office. Later that year, he ascended to the [[United States Senate]] to fill the vacancy left when John Breckinridge resigned to become Attorney General.<ref name=congbio /> His close association with [[Aaron Burr]] during the Burr conspiracy damaged his credibility, and he lost the election for a full term in the next year.<ref name=collins /> He immediately left the Senate, resigning on November 18, 1806.<ref name=congbio />

In December 1806, Adair departed for [[Louisiana]] to inspect a tract of land he had purchased. On his arrival in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], he was arrested on the order of his former commander, James Wilkinson, who charged him with disloyalty. Adair counter-sued, and in a court battle that spanned several years, it was revealed that Wilkinson had no actual evidence against Adair. Wilkinson was ordered to issue a public apology and pay $2,500 in damages to Adair.<ref>Bussey, pp. 26&ndash;27</ref>

===Service in the War of 1812===
{{seealso|Kentucky in the War of 1812}}
At the outbreak of the War of 1812, former governor Isaac Shelby asked Adair to serve as his aide. Adair rendered commendable service in the [[Canada|Canadian]] campaign, most notably at the [[Battle of the Thames]] in [[Ontario]] in 1813. The following year, he led 1,100 Kentucky riflemen in support of [[Andrew Jackson|General Jackson]]'s expedition that ended with the victory in the [[Battle of New Orleans]]. Following the war, Adair spent two years corresponding with Jackson, defending his fellow Kentuckians against Jackson's charge that they had acted in a cowardly manner at the Battle of New Orleans.<ref name=powell26>Powell, p. 26</ref>

Adair's participation in the War of 1812 restored his reputation. On February 10, 1816, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a resolution thanking Adair for his service at the Battle of New Orleans and for his defense of the soldiers accused by Jackson.<ref name=young126>Young, p. 126</ref> The voters returned Adair to the state's House in 1817.<ref name=congbio /> He was appointed adjutant general of the state's militia and was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] to the rank of [[brigadier general]].<ref name=congbio />

===Term as governor===
A period of land [[speculation]] followed the war.<ref name=bussey27>Bussey, p. 27</ref> In response, the federal government created the [[Second Bank of the United States]].<ref name=bussey27 /> The bank's strict credit policy hit Kentucky hard, and contributed to the financial Panic of 1819.<ref name=bussey27 /> In the gubernatorial election of 1820, Adair ran on a platform of bringing relief to the state's debtors.<ref name=harrison2 /> He was elected over three fellow [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]: [[William Logan (Kentucky)|William Logan]], [[Joseph Desha]], and [[Anthony Butler]].<ref name=harrison2 />

During his term, several banking crises and recession brought the state government near to failure, and many of his administration's actions were related to the state's financial troubles. He oversaw the abolition of the practice of debt incarceration, and sanctioned rigorous gambling legislation.<ref name=nga>NGA Bio</ref> Perhaps the most important measure implemented during Adair's administration was the creation of the Bank of the Commonwealth in 1820. The bank made generous loans and issued paper money. Creditors who refused to accept notes issued by the bank were prohibited from pressing their claims for two years. Many of Adair's other relief measures were struck down as unconstitutional  by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the state's highest court at the time, because they impaired the obligation of contracts.<ref name=harrison2 /> These decisions set the stage for the [[Old Court-New Court controversy]].

Among Adair's accomplishments not directly related to finances were the establishment of the state's university system and endorsement of the [[Missouri Compromise]].<ref name=nga /> He advocated for prison reform and better treatment of the insane.<ref name=harrison2 /> He also oversaw the enactment of a plan for internal improvements, including improved navigation on the [[Ohio River]].<ref name=harrison2 />

==Later life and death==
Following his term as governor, Adair spent most of his time on his farm.<ref name=harrison2 /> He did make one more appearance in national affairs, when he was elected to the [[Twenty-second United States Congress|U.S. House]] as a Jackson [[American Democratic Party|Democrat]] for the 1831 to 1833 term.<ref name=congbio /> During his term, he served on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Military Affairs]].<ref name=smith170>Smith, p. 170</ref> He did not run for re-election.<ref name=congbio />

Adair died at home in Harrodsburg, and was buried on the grounds of his estate, White Hall.<ref name=powell26 /> In 1872, his grave was moved to the [[Frankfort Cemetery]] in the state capital. Adair County, Kentucky, Adair County, Missouri, Adair County, Iowa, and the towns of Adairville, Kentucky and Adair, Iowa were named after John Adair.<ref>Gannett, p. 16</ref><ref>Eutaek, ''Jesse James''</ref>
