'''Fr<U+00E4>nk Ren<U+00E9> Schleck''' (born 15 April 1980) is a [[Luxembourg]]ish professional [[road bicycle racer]] who last rode for [[UCI ProTeam]] {{ct|RLT}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uciworldtour.com/Modules/SUCI/TEAMS/TeamDetails.asp?id=NDA3Mg&RefDate=10.01.2013&MenuId=MTYzMDE&LangId=1&BackLink=%2Ftemplates%2FUCI%2FUCI2%2Flayout%2Easp%3FMenuId%3DMTYzMDE%26LangId%3D1|title=RadioShack-Leopard (RLT) <U+2013> LUX|accessdate=10 January 2013|work=[[UCI World Tour]]|publisher=[[Union Cycliste Internationale]]}}</ref> Schleck is the older brother of [[Andy Schleck|Andy]], winner of the [[2010 Tour de France]]. Their father, [[Johny Schleck]], was a professional road bicycle racer between 1965 and 1974, as was their grandfather, Gustave Schleck, who contested events in the 1930s. 

Fr<U+00E4>nk's greatest achievements include winning a [[2006 Tour de France, Stage 12 to Stage 20#Stage 15, Tuesday, July 18: Gap - L'Alpe-d'Huez, 187<U+00A0>km|blue riband mountain stage]] in the [[2006 Tour de France]] which finished on the [[Alpe d'Huez]], the [[2006 Amstel Gold Race|2006 edition]] of the [[Amstel Gold Race]] [[cycling classic|classic]], and an alpine stage of the [[2009 Tour de France]], finishing in the sole company of his brother Andy and [[Alberto Contador]]. On 30 January 2013, Schleck was suspended for 12 months following a positive test for [[xipamide]] at the [[2012 Tour de France]]. The ban, backdated to the date of the positive test, is due to expire on 13 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Disgraced Schleck will miss Tour de France after failing drug test during last year's race|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2270898/Frank-Schleck-miss-Tour-France-failing-drug-test-years-race.html#axzz2JfEkYvH8|accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref>

==Cycling career==
After riding for the [[Military of Luxembourg|Luxembourg military]] sports programme, he moved to [[Italy]] to ride for [[De Nardi-Pasta Montegrappa]]. In 2001, he tried out as a [[Bicycling terminology#stagiaire|stagiaire]] for {{ct|FES|2001}}, but when the team folded after the season, Schleck was left with no contract. He contacted Team CSC manager [[Bjarne Riis]] through their common youth coach [[Marcel Gilles]] of the [[ACC Contern]] amateur team.<ref>[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/riders/2005/interviews/?id=frank_schleck05 Flying high close to home], ''CyclingNews'', 1 December 2005</ref> Schleck rode 2002 as a stagiaire on Team CSC and signed to a pro contract by Team Manager Bjarne Riis in 2003.

===2005===
At the start of 2005, Schleck was joined by his younger brother [[Andy Schleck|Andy]] on {{ct|SAX|2005}}, and they split the 2005 national championships between them, with Fr<U+00E4>nk winning the [[Bicycling terminology#open road race|road race]] and Andy winning the [[Individual time trial|time trial]]. Schleck's breakthrough came in 2005, with three podium places in the last month of the season. He finished all three races behind [[Paolo Bettini]] ([[Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games - Road Race Men|2004 Olympic Road Race]] winner) and [[Gilberto Simoni]] (two times [[Giro d'Italia]] winner), losing [[Z<U+00FC>ri-Metzgete]] to Bettini, the [[Giro dell'Emilia]] to Simoni, and finishing third behind both in the [[Giro di Lombardia]]. Schleck ended 2005 ranked 13th on the [[UCI ProTour 2005#2005 ProTour Individual Rankings|2005 ProTour riders list]]. He extended his contract with Riis and Team CSC until 2008, one of three riders in the team with a three-year contract.

===2006===
The 2006 season started with a fifth-place finish in [[Paris<U+2013>Nice]]. After a crash in the [[Tour of the Basque Country]], he suffered a concussion.<ref>[http://www.team-csc.com/ny_news.asp?n_id=862 Schleck Crashes Out], ''Team-CSC'', 5 April 2006</ref> He made his comeback in the [[Amstel Gold Race]] that month. Sitting with the favorites with ten kilometers to go, Schleck broke away alone up the Cauberg in [[Valkenburg aan de Geul|Valkenburg]] for a solo finish while team mate [[Karsten Kroon]] disrupted the chase. Three days later he finished 4th in [[La Fl<U+00E8>che Wallonne]] after a vigorous ride up the [[Muur de Huy]] where Spanish rider [[Alejandro Valverde]] proved unbeatable. Schleck's form continued days later with the [[2006 Li<U+00E8>ge<U+2013>Bastogne<U+2013>Li<U+00E8>ge|Li<U+00E8>ge<U+2013>Bastogne<U+2013>Li<U+00E8>ge]] race, where he rode at the front for much of the latter half and finished 7th. In the Tour de France, he won stage 15 from Gap to [[Alpe D'Huez]], where he broke away from [[Damiano Cunego]] 1.5&nbsp;km from the finish.

===2007===
The 2007 season started with a 9th place finish in Paris<U+2013>Nice. In the Amstel Gold race, he crashed with 47&nbsp;km to go, eventually finishing 10th. His recovery continued at the Fl<U+00E8>che Wallone where he finished 7th, but the day before Li<U+00E8>ge<U+2013>Bastogne<U+2013>Li<U+00E8>ge, it was announced that he had a fractured vertebra. He rode despite the injury and launched the decisive attack a few kilometers from the finish with [[Danilo di Luca]]. Di Luca attacked with one kilometer to go and Schleck faded to 3rd. Schleck won the fourth stage of the Tour de Suisse, taking the yellow jersey; he eventually finished 7th. He could only manage 17th at the Tour de France but was part of the successful attack in the world championship, finishing fourth.

===2008===
In the [[Amstel Gold Race]] 2008 Schleck finished 2nd, behind [[Damiano Cunego]] of Italy. In [[Li<U+00E8>ge<U+2013>Bastogne<U+2013>Li<U+00E8>ge]] Fr<U+00E4>nk and his talented younger brother [[Andy Schleck]] put on a show. Only two riders were able to follow the two brothers when they attacked on the final hills of the day : [[Alejandro Valverde]] and [[Davide Rebellin]]. Andy had to let the other three riders go and finished 4th. In the final sprint Fr<U+00E4>nk came 3rd.
In the [[Tour de Suisse]] Schleck crashed during a dangerous descent and fell into a ravine. Miraculously, he was mostly uninjured.
A week later, Schleck became national champion of Luxembourg for the second time in his career.
In the [[Tour de France 2008]] he came 3rd in the first mountain stage. This took him to 2nd place in the overall classification, only one second behind the yellow jersey. Eight days later Schleck took the [[maillot jaune]] and the lead in the Tour after claiming the single second he needed to pass [[Cadel Evans]]. He later lost the yellow jersey on Stage 17 to his own teammate, Carlos Sastre. At the end of the Tour he finished in 6th position overall.

===2009===

[[File:Fr<U+00E4>nk Schleck Tour 2010 team presentation.jpg|thumb|upright|Schleck at the [[2010 Tour de France]], wearing the colours of the Luxembourg national champion.]]

The 2009 cycling season started with the [[Tour of California]], where Schleck managed to win stage eight. In March, Schleck placed second overall in [[Paris<U+2013>Nice]]. On the 19 April, while attempting to repeat his winning [[2006 Amstel Gold Race]] effort, Schleck crashed badly together with [[Matthew Lloyd (cyclist)|Matthew Lloyd]]. He was taken to hospital with a concussion, but was released the same evening.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://velonews.com/article/90889/schleck-lloyd-crash-out-of-amstel-gold|title=Schleck, Lloyd crash out of Amstel Gold}}</ref> Schleck made a rapid recovery, winning his home race, the [[Tour de Luxembourg]], in June. No Luxembourger rider had won the competition since 1983.<br />
On the 22 July he won the 17th stage of the [[Tour de France]], reaching the finish line in the company of overall leader [[Alberto Contador]] and his own brother, [[Andy Schleck]]. He later finished 5th that year

===2010===
In 2010, Schleck won Stage 3 in the Tour de Suisse and then he put in a surprise in the final time trial. He ended up winning the race.  While riding in Stage 3 of the 2010 Tour de France, Schleck suffered a triple fracture of his [[clavicle]], which was sustained on a cobble-stoned section of the stage, and was forced to retire from the race. He later then rode the Vuelta a Espana where he finished 5th.

On 29 July 2010, Schleck and his brother [[Andy Schleck|Andy]] announced their departure from Team Saxo Bank at the end of 2010. They plan on forming a brand-new Luxembourg-based team, with former Team Saxo Bank director [[Kim Andersen (cyclist)|Kim Andersen]].<ref>Devaney, Jason. [http://www.universalsports.com/blogs/blog=shiftinggears/postid=485983.html "Schlecks Confirm Departure from Saxo Bank."] ''Universal Sports <U+2013> Cycling.'' 30 July 2010.</ref> In October 2010, one of the managers of the Luxembourg cycling project revealed the team website, which is labeled Leopard True Racing, leading to speculation that the team might race under this name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/6134/Could-the-Luxemburg-team-of-Schleck-brothers-be-named-Leopard-True-Racing.aspx |title=Could the Luxembourg team of Schleck brothers be named Leopard True Racing? |publisher=Velonation.com |date=2010-10-24 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref>

===2011===

By the 2011 season, Frank's new team was confirmed as {{ct|LEO|2011}} and Schleck won the [[Crit<U+00E9>rium International]], along with a podium finish at [[2011 Li<U+00E8>ge<U+2013>Bastogne<U+2013>Li<U+00E8>ge|Li<U+00E8>ge<U+2013>Bastogne<U+2013>Li<U+00E8>ge]], and he also defended his Luxembourg National Road Race title. At the [[2011 Tour de France|Tour of France]];, Schleck had a solid year. He finished the race third along with his brother's second, marked the first time in Tour history that siblings had shared the podium. Schleck and his brother then signed with RadioShack-NissanTrek for the 2012 season.

===2012<U+2013>2013===
Schleck started his season slowly as a member of the [[RadioShack-Nissan]] team. He decided to ride the Giro d'Italia but withdrew on stage 15. Schleck then showed his form when he finished third in the Tour of Luxembourg and then finished second in the Tour de Suisse. He was then selected to ride the [[2012 Tour de France|Tour de France]].  On the 6th stage of the 2012 tour, Schleck crashed with about 25&nbsp;km left, and lost just over 2 minutes, seriously hurting his chances of possibly winning the tour. 

Schleck left the Tour de France after the [[International Cycling Union]] revealed he had tested positive for the banned substance [[diuretic]] [[xipamide]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Frank Schleck to leave Tour de France after failing doping test|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/17/sport/cycling-tour-schleck-doping/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/cycling/Tour-de-France-star-Frank-Schleck-positive-for-diuretic-UCI/articleshow/15024378.cms| title= Tour de France star Frank Schleck positive for diuretic: UCI| date=18 July 2012}}</ref>

On 4 July 2013 {{ct|RLT}} announced that they would not be renewing Schleck's contract, leaving him without a team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/frank-schleck-surprised-by-radioshack-dumping |title=Fr<U+00E4>nk Schleck Surprised By RadioShack Dumping |publisher=Cyclingnews.com |date=2012-07-14 |accessdate=2013-07-05}}</ref>

== Doping allegations ==

=== 2008 ===
On 25 July 2008, one day prior to a decisive penultimate stage of the Tour de France 2008, the German daily newspaper [[S<U+00FC>ddeutsche Zeitung]] alleged a contact between Schleck and the infamous Spanish doctor [[Eufemiano Fuentes]] in December 2005. Authorities stated that no evidence had been obtained that would support such a claim.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/557/303552/text/ Schleck unter Verdacht], Sueddeutsche Zeitung, 25 July 2008</ref> The allegations in connection with Schleck followed a series of strong performances of the rider who wore the yellow jersey over several days and whose father's car had been the subject of a detailed search by French customs authorities during the Tour. 

Prior to the [[2008 UCI Road World Championships]] in [[Varese]], Italy, on 26 September 2008, the S<U+00FC>ddeutsche Zeitung published a further article on the connections between Schleck and Fuentes after claiming to have seen evidence on a bank transfer of <U+20AC>7000 from Schleck to a Swiss bank account linked to Fuentes. The existence of the evidence was revealed by German police and subsequently confirmed by Luxembourg prosecutors.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/961/311881/text/ Schleck war Fuentes Kunde], Sueddeutsche Zeitung, 26 September 2008</ref>

Following Schleck's public admittance of such payment on 3 October 2008, [[Bjarne Riis]] and {{ct|SAX|2008b}} decided to temporarily suspend Schleck from any further races until the outcome of the doping allegations towards Schleck would be fully clarified.<ref>[http://www.riis-cycling.com/ny_news.asp?n_id=2147 Press Release regarding Fr<U+00E4>nk Schleck], Team CSC Saxo Bank, 3 October 2008</ref>
Schleck was cleared from all allegations by the doping authorities of Luxembourg at the beginning of December.

=== 2012 ===
On 17 July 2012, Schleck was removed from the [[Tour de France]] by his team [[RadioShack-Nissan]] during the second rest day after his A-sample returned traces of [[Xipamide]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Williams in Pau |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/17/tour-de-france-frank-schleck |title=Frank Schleck tests positive for banned diuretic and is out of Tour |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref> Schleck's B-sample confirmed the positive result.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fr<U+00E4>nk Schleck doping positive confirmed|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/frank-schleck-doping-positive-confirmed|publisher=Cyclingnews|accessdate=20 July 2012}}</ref> Following the positive B-Sample the [[RadioShack-Nissan]] team suspended him<ref>{{cite web|author=Justin Davis in Pau |url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2012/07/news/schleck-controversy-deepens-radioshack-woes_230364 |title=Schleck controversy deepens RadioShack woes |publisher=VeloNews |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/12453/Frank-Schlecks-B-sample-also-positive-for-diuretic-Xipamide-doping-hearing-looming-for-rider.aspx|title=Frank Schleck<U+2019>s B sample also positive for diuretic Xipamide; doping hearing looming for rider|work=VeloNation|publisher=Velo Nation LLC|date=20 July 2012|accessdate=30 January 2013|author=Shane Stokes}}</ref> 

In January 2013, it was announced that Schleck was handed a ban of one year by the Luxembourg Anti-Doping Agency, who specified that Schleck "had not ingested the substance intentionally" and as a result the standard two-year suspension was reduced to twelve months.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/13823/Frank-Schleck-handed-one-year-ban-by-Luxembourg-Anti-Doping.aspx|title=Fr<U+00E4>nk Schleck handed one year ban by Luxembourg Anti-Doping|work=VeloNation|publisher=VeloNation LLC|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=30 January 2013|author=Ben Atkins}}</ref> The ban became effective from the point of the original positive, 14 July 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/frank-schleck-given-one-year-doping-ban|title=Fr<U+00E4>nk Schleck given one-year doping ban|work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>
