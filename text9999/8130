Quinctius Flamininus]] with his allies and king Philip were present, and at which peace with Philip was discussed.  Alexander dissuaded his friends from any peaceful arrangement with Philip.<ref>[[Polybius]], xviii. 19, &c.</ref><ref>[[Appian]], ''Maced.'' vii. 1</ref>  In [[195 BC]], when a congress of all the Greek states that were allied with Rome was convoked by Flamininus at [[Corinth]], for the purpose of considering the war that was to be undertaken against the [[Sparta]]n king [[Nabis]], Alexander spoke against the [[Athens|Athenians]], and also insinuated that the Romans were acting fraudulently towards Greece.<ref>[[Livy]], xxxiv. 23</ref>  When in [[189 BC]],  [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior]], after his victory over [[Antiochus III the Great]], was expected to march into Aetolia, the Aetolians sent envoys to Athens and [[Rhodes]]; and Alexander Isius, together with Phaneas and Lycopus, were sent to Rome to sue for peace.  Alexander, now an old man, was at the head of the embassy; but he and his colleagues were made prisoners in [[Cephalenia]] by the [[Epeirots]], for the purpose of extorting a heavy ransom.  Alexander, however, although he was very wealthy, refused to pay it, and was accordingly kept in captivity for some days, after which he was liberated, at the command of the Romans, without any ransom.<ref>[[Polybius]], xxii. 9</ref>
