'''Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas''' encompasses the visual [[art]]istic traditions of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from ancient times to the present. These include works from South America, Mesoamerica, North America including [[Greenland]], as well as [[Siberian Yup'ik]] peoples who have great cultural overlap with [[Native Alaskan]] [[Yup'ik]]s.

==Lithic and Archaic stage==
{{See also|Pre-Columbian art|Petroglyph|Pictogram|Petroform|Rock art|Stone tools}}
In North America, the [[Lithic stage]] or [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian period]] is defined as approximately 18,000<U+2013>8000 BCE.  The period from around 8000<U+2013>800 BCE is generally referred to as the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]]. The production of [[bannerstone]]s, [[Projectile point]], [[Lithic reduction]] styles and pictographic cave paintings are some of the art that remains from this time period.

Belonging in the Lithic stage, the oldest known art in the Americas is a carved [[megafauna]] bone, possibly from a mammoth, etched with a profile of walking [[mammoth]] or [[mastodon]] that dates back to 11,000 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pasthorizons.com/index.php/archives/06/2011/ice-age-art-from-florida|title=Ice Age Art from Florida|publisher=Past Horizons|date=23 June 2011|accessdate=23 June 2011}}</ref> The bone was found early in the 21st century near [[Vero Beach, Florida]], in an area where human bones ([[Vero man]]) had been found in association with extinct [[pleistocene]] animals early in the 20th century. The bone is too [[Fossil|mineralized]] to be dated, but the carving has been authenticated as having been made before the bone became mineralized. The anatomical correctness of the carving and the heavy mineralization of the bone indicate that the carving was made while mammoths and/or mastodons still lived in the area, more than 10,000 years ago.<ref>[http://www.verobeach32963.com/news/News060409/060409_BoneCarvingFind.htm University of Florida: Epic carving on fossil bone found in Vero Beach]<br>{{cite web|last=Viegas|first=Jennifer|title=Earliest Mammoth Art: Mammoth on Mammoth|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/earliest-american-art-mammoth-110622.html|publisher=Discovery News|accessdate=23 June 2011}}<br>{{cite news|last=The Associated Press|title=Ancient mammoth or mastodon image found on bone in Vero Beach|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20110622/ARTICLES/110629821/-1/news?Title=Ancient-mammoth-or-mastodon-image-found-on-bone-in-Vero-Beach|accessdate=23 June 2011|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|date=22 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Purdy|first=Barbara A., Kevin S.

===Arctic===
{{See also|Inuit art|Alaska Native Art}}
The [[Yup'ik]] of Alaska have a long tradition of carving [[Yup'ik masks|masks]] for use in [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanic]] rituals. Indigenous peoples of the Canadian arctic have produced objects that could be classified as art since the time of the [[Dorset culture]]. While the walrus ivory carvings of the Dorset were primarily shamanic, the art of the [[Thule people]] who replaced them c. 1000 CE was more decorative in character. With European contact the historic period of Inuit art began. In this period, which reached its height in the late 19th century, Inuit artisans created souvenirs for the crews of whaling ships and explorers. Common examples include [[cribbage]] boards. Modern Inuit art began in the late 1940s, when with the encouragement of the Canadian government they began to produce prints and [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] sculptures for sale in the south.

Greenlandic Inuit, or [[Kalaallit]] have a unique textile tradition intregrating skin-sewing, furs, and appliqu<U+00E9> of small pieces of brightly dyed marine mammal organs. Women create elaborate netted beadwork collars. They have strong mask-making tradition and also are known for an art form called ''[[tupilaq]]'' or an "evil spirit object." Traditional art making practices thrive in the [[Ammassalik]].<ref>Hessel, 20</ref> [[Sperm whale]] ivory remains a valued medium for carving.<ref>Hessel, 21</ref>

===Subarctic===
Cultures of interior Alaska and Canada living south of the [[Arctic Circle]] are [[Subarctic peoples]]. While humans have lived in the region far longer, the oldest known surviving Subarctic art is a petroglyph site in northwest [[Ontario]], dated to 5000 BCE. [[Caribou]], and to a lesser extent [[moose]], are major resources, providing hides, antlers, sinew, and other artistic materials. Porcupine [[quillwork]] embellishes hides and birchbark. After European contact with the influence of the [[Grey Nuns]], moosehair [[tufting]] and floral glass beadwork became popular through the Subarctic.<ref>[http://www.native-art-in-canada.com/nativeart.html A History of Native Art in Canada and North America.] ''Native Art in Canada.'' 11.June.2010</ref>

The art of the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Heiltsuk]], [[Tsimshian]] and other smaller tribes living in the coastal areas of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]], [[Oregon]], and [[British Columbia]], is characterized by an extremely complex stylistic vocabulary expressed mainly in the medium of woodcarving. Famous examples include [[Totem pole]]s, [[Transformation mask]]s, and canoes. In addition to woodwork, two dimensional painting, and after contact - silver/gold/copper engraved jewelry became important.

===Eastern Woodlands===

====Northeastern Woodlands====
The [[Eastern Woodlands]], or simply woodlands, cultures inhabited the regions of North America east of the [[Mississippi River]] at least since 2500 BCE. While there were many regionally distinct cultures, trade between them was common and they shared the practice of burying their dead in earthen mounds, which has preserved a large amount of their art. Because of this trait the cultures are collectively known as the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]].

The [[Woodland Period]] (1000 BCE<U+2013>1000 CE) is divided into early, middle, and late periods, and consisted of cultures that relied mostly on hunting and gathering for their subsistence. Ceramics made by the [[Deptford culture]] (2500 BCE-100 CE) are the earliest evidence of an artistic tradition in this region. The [[Adena culture]] are another well-known example of an early Woodland culture. They carved stone tablets with [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] designs, created [[Hopewell pottery|pottery]], and fashioned costumes from animal hides and antlers for ceremonial rituals. Shellfish was a mainstay of their diet, and engraved shells have been found in their burial mounds.

The [[Middle Woodland Period]] was dominated by cultures of the [[Hopewell tradition]] (200-500). Their [[Hopewell tradition#Artwork|artwork]] encompassed a wide variety of jewelry and sculpture in stone, wood, and even human bone.

The [[Late Woodland Period]] (500-1000 CE) saw a decline in trade and in the size of settlements, and the creation of art likewise declined.

From the 12th century onward, the [[Iroquois]] and nearby coastal tribes fashioned [[wampum]] from shells and string; these were [[mnenomic]] devices, currency, and records of treaties.

Iroquois people carve [[False Face mask]]s for healing rituals, but the traditional representatives of the tribes, the Grand Council of the [[Haudenosaunee]], are clear that these masks are not for sale or public display.<ref name=false>Shenadoah, Chief Leon.

Stone tools found at Poverty Point were made from raw materials which originated in the relatively nearby Ouachita and Ozark Mountains and from the much further away [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Tennessee River]] valleys. Vessels were made from [[soapstone]] which came from the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian foothills]] of [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/parks/ipvertypt.aspx|title=CRT-Louisiana State Parks Fees, Facilities and Activities|accessdate=2 March 2009}}</ref> Hand-modeled lowly fired clay objects occur in a variety of shapes including anthropomophic figurines and cooking balls.<ref name="metmuseum.org"/>

The [[Mississippian culture]] flourished in what is now the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]], [[Eastern United States|Eastern]], and [[Southeastern United States]] from approximately 800 CE to 1500 CE, varying regionally.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-707 Mississippian Period: Overview]</ref> After adopting [[maize]] agriculture the Mississippian culture became fully agrarian, as opposed to the hunting and gathering supplemented by part-time agriculture practiced by preceding woodland cultures. They built [[platform mound]]s larger and more complex than those of their predecessors, and finished and  developed more advanced ceramic techniques, commonly using ground [[mussel]] shell as a tempering agent. Many were involved with the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]], a pan-regional and pan-linguistic religious and trade network. The majority of the information known about the S.E.C.C. is derived from examination of the elaborate artworks left behind by its participants, including [[Mississippian culture pottery|pottery]], [[shell gorget]]s and cups, [[Mississippian stone statuary|stone statuary]], [[Mississippian copper plates|copper plates]] such as the [[Wulfing cache]] and [[Long-nosed god maskette]]s. By the time of European contact the Mississippian societies were already experiencing severe social stress, and with the social upsets and diseases introduced by Europeans many of the societies collapsed and ceased to practice a Mississippian lifestyle, with an exception being the [[Natchez people]]. Other tribes descended from Mississippian cultures include the [[Caddo]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee Creek]], [[Wichita (tribe)|Wichita]], and many other southeastern peoples.

A large number of pre-Columbian wooden artifacts have been found in Florida. While the oldest wooden artifacts are as much as 10,000 years old, carved and painted wooden objects are known only from the past 2,000 years. Animal effigies and face masks have been found at a number of sites in Florida. Animal effigies dating to between 200 and 600 were found in a mortuary pond at [[Fort Center]], on the west side of [[Lake Okeechobee]]. Particularly impressive is a 66&nbsp;cm tall carving of an eagle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Purdy|first=Barbara A.|title=Indian Art of Ancient Florida|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1462-X|pages=31<U+2013>33}}</ref>

{{commons|Key Marco}}
More than 1,000 carved and painted wooden objects, including masks, tablets, plaques and effigies, were excavated in 1896 at [[Key Marco]], in [[southwestern Florida]]. They have been described as some of the finest prehistoric native American art in North America. The objects are not well dated, but may belong to the first millienium of the current era. Spanish missionaries described similar masks and effigies in use by the [[Calusa]] late in the 17th century, and at the former [[Tequesta]] site on the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] in 1743, although no examples of the Calusa objects from the historic period have survived. A south Florida effigy style is known from wooden and bone carvings from various sites in the [[Belle Glade culture|Belle Glade]], [[Caloosahatchee culture|Caloosahatchee]], and [[Glades culture]] areas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Robin C.|title=Florida's First People|year=1994|publisher=Pineapple Press|location=Sarasota, Florida|isbn=1-56164-032-8|pages=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hahn|first=John H.|title=Indians of Central and South Florida 1513-1763|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-2645-8|pages=46<U+2013>47}}</ref>

===The West===

====Great Plains====
Tribes have lived on the [[Great Plains]] for thousands of years. Early Plains cultures are commonly divided into four periods: Paleoindian (at least c. 10,000<U+2013>4000 BCE), Plains Archaic (c. 4000<U+2013>250 BCE), Plains Woodland (c. 250 BCE<U+2013>950 CE), Plains Village (c. 950-1850 CE).<ref>Pyburn, Anne. [http://www.indiana.edu/~arch/saa/matrix/naa/naa_web/mod10.html "Peoples of the Great Plains".] ''Indiana University.''. Retrieved 29 January 2010</ref> The oldest known painted object in North American was found in the southern plains, the [[Cooper Bison Skull]], found in Oklahoma and dated 10,900-10,200 BCE. It's painted with a red zizzag.<ref name=bement/>

In the Plains Village period, the cultures of the area settled in enclosed clusters of rectangular houses and cultivated [[maize]]. Various regional differences emerged, including Southern Plains, Central Plains, [[Oneota]], and Middle Missouri. Tribes were both nomadic hunters and semi-nomadic farmers. During the ''Plains Coalescent period'' (1400-European contact) some change, possibly drought, caused the mass migration of the population to the Eastern Woodlands region, and the Great Plains were sparsely populated until pressure from American settlers drove tribes into the area again.

The advent of the horse revolutionized the cultures of many historical Plains tribes. [[Horse culture]] enabled tribes to live a completely nomadic existence, hunting buffalo. Buffalo hide clothing was decorated with [[quillwork|porcupine quill embroidery]] and beads <U+2013> dentalium shells and elk teeth were prized materials. Later coins and glass beads acquired from trading were incorporated into Plains art. Plains [[beadwork]] has flourished into contemporary times.

Buffalo was the preferred material for [[Plains hide painting]]. Men painted narrative, pictorial designs recording personal exploits or visions. They also painted pictographic historical calendars known as [[Winter count]]s. Women painted geometric designs on tanned robes and rawhide [[parfleche]]s, which sometimes served as maps.<ref>[http://www.conservationgis.org/native/native1.html "Native American and First Nations' GIS."] ''Native Geography.'' Dec 2000. Retrieved 29 January 2010</ref>

During the Reservation Era of the late 19th century, buffalo herds were systematically destroyed by non-native hunters. Due to the scarcity of hides, Plains artists adopted new painting surfaces, such as muslin or paper, giving birth to [[Ledger art]], so named for the ubiquitous ledger books used by Plains artists.

====Great Basin and Plateau====
Since the archaic period the Plateau region, also known as the [[Intermontane|Intermontaine]] and upper [[Great Basin]], had been a center of trade. Plateau people traditionally settled near major river systems.<ref>Berlo and Phillips, 131</ref> Because of this, their art carries influences from other regions <U+2013> from the Pacific Northwest coasts and Great Plains. [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]], [[Yakama]], [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]], and [[Cayuse]] women weave flat, rectangular corn husks or [[hemp dogbane]] bags, which are decorated with "bold, geometric designs" in false embroidery.<ref>Berlo and Phillips, 132</ref> Plateau beadworkers are known for their contour-style beading and their elaborate horse regalia.

[[Great Basin tribes]] have a sophisticated basket making tradition, as exemplified by [[Louisa Keyser]] ([[Washoe people|Washoe]]), [[Lucy Telles]], [[Carrie Bethel]] and [[Nellie Charlie]]. After being displaced from their lands by non-Native settlers, Washoe wove baskets for the commodity market, especially 1895 to 1935.<ref>Berlo and Phillips, 136</ref> [[Paiute]], [[Shoshone]] and Washoe basketmakers are known for their baskets that incorporate seed beads on the surface and for waterproof baskets.<ref>Garey-Sage, Darla.

==== California ====
The [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#California|Native Americans in California]] have a tradition of exquisitely detailed [[basket weaving]] arts. In the late 19th-century Californian [[basket]]s by artists in the [[Cahuilla]], [[Chumash people|Chumash]], [[Pomo]], [[Miwok]], [[Hupa]] and many other tribes became popular with collectors, museums, and tourists. This resulted in great innovation in the form of the baskets. Many pieces by [[List of Native American artists#Basket weavers|Native American basket weavers]] from all parts of California are in museum collections, such as the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at [[Harvard University]], the [[Autry National Center|Southwest Museum]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of the American Indian]].

California has a large number of [[pictograph]]s and [[petroglyphs]] [[rock art]]. One of the largest densities of [[petroglyphs]] in North America, by the [[Coso People]], is in [[Big and Little Petroglyph Canyons]] in the [[Coso Rock Art District]] of the northern [[Mojave Desert]] in California.

The most elaborate pictographs in the U.S are considered to be the [[rock art of the Chumash people]], found in [[cave painting]]s in present day [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]], and [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo Counties]]. The [[Chumash people|Chumash]] [[cave painting]] includes examples at [[Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park, California|Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park]] and [[Burro Flats Painted Cave]].

In the [[Southwestern United States]] numerous pictographs and petroglyphs were created. The [[Fremont culture]] and [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] and later tribes' creations, in the [[Barrier Canyon Style]] and others, are seen at present day [[Buckhorn Draw Pictograph Panel]] and [[Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)|Horseshoe Canyon]], amongst other sites. Petroglyphs by these and the [[Mogollon culture]]'s artists are represented in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] and at [[Newspaper Rock State Historic Monument|Newspaper Rock]].

The [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Ancestral Pueblo]], or Anasazi, (1000 BCE<U+2013>700 CE) are the ancestors of today's [[Pueblo peoples|Pueblo tribes]]. Their culture formed in the American southwest, after the cultivation of corn was introduced from Mexico around 1200 BCE. People of this region developed an agrarian lifestyle, cultivating food, storage gourds, and cotton with irrigation or [[xeriscaping]] techniques. They lived in sedentary towns, so pottery, used to store water and grain, was ubiquitous.

For hundreds of years, Ancestral Pueblo created utilitarian grayware and black-on-white pottery and occasionally orange or red ceramics.  In historical times, [[Hopi]] created [[olla]]s, dough bowls, and food bowls of different sizes for daily use, but they also made more elaborate ceremonial mugs, jugs, ladles, seed jars and those vessels for ritual use, and these were usually finished with polished surfaces and decorated with black painted designs. At the turn of the 20th century, Hopi potter [[Nampeyo]] famous revived [[Sikyatki]]-style pottery, originated on First Mesa in the 14th to 17th centuries.<ref>[http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/nampeyo/sikyatki.shtml "Ancestral Hopi Pottery."] ''Arizona State Museum.'' 2007. Retrieved 14 August 2010</ref>

Southwest architecture includes [[Cliff dwelling]]s, multi-story settlements carved from [[rock-cut architecture|living rock]]; [[pit house]]s; and [[adobe]] and [[sandstone]] [[pueblo]]s. One of the most elaborate and largest ancient settlements is [[Chaco Canyon]] in [[New Mexico]], which includes 15 major complexes of sandstone and timber. These are connected by a network of roads. Construction for the largest of these settlements, [[Pueblo Bonito]], began 1080 years [[before present]]. Pueblo Bonito contains over 800 rooms.<ref>[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/northamerica/chaco.html "Chaco Canyon."] ''Minnesota State Museum, Mankato.''. Retrieved 14 August 2010</ref>

[[Turquoise]], jet, and spiny oyster shell have been traditionally used by Ancestral Pueblo for jewelry, and they developed sophisticated [[inlay]] techniques centuries ago.

Around 200 CE the [[Hohokam]] culture developed in Arizona. They are the ancestors of the [[Tohono O'odham]] and [[Akimel O'odham]] or Pima tribes. The [[Mimbres culture|Mimbres]], a subgroup of the [[Mogollon culture]], are especially notable for the narrative paintings on their pottery.

Within the last millennium, [[Athabaskan]] peoples emigrated from northern Canada in the southwest. These include the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]]. [[Sandpainting]] is an aspect of Navajo healing ceremonies that inspired an art form. Navajos learned to weave on upright looms from Pueblos and wove blankets that were eagerly collected by [[Great Basin]] and [[Plains Indians|Plains tribes]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the introduction of the railroad in the 1880s, imported blankets became plentiful and inexpensive, so Navajo weavers switched to producing [[Navajo rug|rugs]] for trade.

In the 1850s, Navajos adopted [[silversmith]]ing from the Mexicans. [[Atsidi Sani]] (Old Smith) was the first Navajo silversmith, but he had many students, and the technology quickly spread to surrounding tribes. Today thousands of artists produce silver jewelry with turquoise. [[Hopi#Culture|Hopi]] are renowned for their overlay silver work and cottonwood carvings. [[Zuni people|Zuni]] artists are admired for their cluster work jewelry, showcasing turquoise designs, as well as their elaborate, pictorial stone inlay in silver.

==Mesoamerica and Central America==
[[File:Mesoamerica english.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Mesoamerican cultural region.]]
{{See also|Pre-Columbian art#Mesoamerica and Central America}}
The cultural development of ancient [[Mesoamerica]] was generally divided along east and west. The stable Maya culture was most dominant in the east, especially the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula, while in the west more varied developments took place in subregions. These included [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|West Mexican]] (1000-1), Teotihuacan (1-500), Mixtec (1000<U+2013>1200), and Aztec (1200<U+2013>1521).

[[Central America]]n civilizations generally lived to the regions south of modern-day Mexico, although there was some overlap.

===Mesoamerica===
{{See also|Mesoamerican architecture|Mesoamerica#Chronology_and_culture}}
Mesoamerica was home to the following cultures, among others:

====Olmec====
{{Main|Olmec figurine|Olmec#Art}}
The Olmec (1500-400 BCE), who lived on the gulf coast, were the first civilization to fully develop in Mesoamerica. Their culture was the first to develop many traits that remained constant in Mesoamerica until the last days of the Aztecs: a complex astronomical calendar, the ritual practice of a [[Mesoamerican ball game|ball game]], and the erection of [[stela]]e to commemorate victories or other important events.

The most famous artistic creations of the Olmec are [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal basalt heads]], believed to be portraits of rulers that were erected to advertise their great power. The Olmec also sculpted votive [[Olmec figurine|figurines]] that they buried beneath the floors of their houses for unknown reasons. These were most often modeled in terracotta, but also occasionally carved from [[jade]] or [[Serpentinite|serpentine]].

====Teotihuacano====
[[Teotihuacan]] was a city built in the [[Valley of Mexico]], containing some of the largest [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramidal structures]] built in the [[pre-Columbian]] [[The Americas|Americas]]. Established around 200 BCE, the city fell between the 7th and 8th century CE. Teotihuacan has numerous well-preserved [[mural]]s.<!-- (Add more about masks) -->

"The Bat God was one of the important deities of the Maya, many elements of whose religion were shared also by the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]. The Bat God in particular is known to have been revered also by the Zapotec [...] He was especially associated [...] with the underworld."<ref>Mason 1929, p. 182, from Richardson 1932, pp. 48<U+2013>9.</ref> An important Zapotec center was [[Monte Alban]], in present-day [[Oaxaca]], Mexico. The Monte Alban periods are divided into I, II, and III, which range from 200 BCE to 600 CE.

The native civilizations were most developed in the [[Andes mountains|Andean region]], where they are roughly divided into Northern Andes civilizations of present- day [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]] and the Southern Andes civilizations of present- day [[Peru]] and [[Chil<U+00E9>]].

Hunter-gatherer tribes throughout the [[Amazon rainforest]] of [[Brazil]] also have developed artistic traditions involving tattooing and body painting. Because of their remoteness, these tribes and their art have not been studied as thoroughly as Andean cultures, and many even remain [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted]].

Traditionally limited in access to stone and metals, Amazonian [[indigenous people]]s excel at featherwork, painting, textiles, and ceramics. [[Caverna da Pedra Pintada]] (Cave of the Painted Rock) in the [[Par<U+00E1>]] state of [[Brazil]] houses the oldest firmly dated art in the Americas <U+2013> rock paintings dating back 11,000 years. The cave is also the site of the oldest ceramics in the Americas, from 5000 BCE.<ref name=cave>Wilford, John Noble.

The Island of [[Maraj<U+00F3>]], at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] was a major center of ceramic traditions as early as 1000 CE<ref name=cave/> and continues to produce ceramics today, characterized by cream-colored bases painted with linear, geometric designs of red, black, and white [[Slip (ceramics)|slips]].

With access to a wide range of native bird species, Amazonian [[indigenous people]]s excel at feather work, creating brilliant colored headdresses, jewelry, clothing, and fans. Iridescent beetle wings are incorporated into earrings and other jewelry. Weaving and basketry also thrive in the Amazon, as noted among the [[Urarina]] of Peru.<ref>Bartholomew Dean.

==Modern and contemporary==
[[File:Phoenix indian school 1900.jpg|thumb|280px|Drawing class at the Phoenix Indian School, 1900]]

===Beginnings of contemporary Native American art===
Pinpointing the exact time of emergence of "modern" and contemporary Native art is problematic. In the past, Western art historians have considered use of Western art media or exhibiting in international art arena as criteria for "modern" Native American art history.<ref>Berlo and Phillips, 209.</ref> Native American art history is a new and highly contested academic discipline, and these Eurocentric benchmarks are followed less and less today. Many media considered appropriate for easel art were employed by Native artists for centuries, such as stone and wood sculpture and mural painting. [[Ancestral Pueblo]] artists painted with tempera on woven cotton fabric, at least 800 years ago.<ref>Dunn, p. xxviii.</ref> Certain Native artists used non-Indian art materials as soon as they became available. For example, [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcocan]] artist [[Fernando de Alva Cort<U+00E9>s Ixtlilxochitl]] painted with ink and watercolor on paper in the late 16th century. Bound together in the [[Codex]] Ixtlilxochitl, these portraits of historical Texcocan leaders are rendered with shading, modeling and anatomic accuracy.<ref>Levenson, pp. 554-5.</ref> The [[Cuzco School]] of Peru featured [[Quechua people|Quechua]] easel painters in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] in the 16th century, precursors to modern museums, featured Native American art.

It should be noted that the notion that fine art cannot be functional has not gained widespread acceptance in the Native American art world, as evidenced by the high esteem and value placed upon rugs, blankets, basketry, weapons, and other utilitarian items in Native American art shows. A dichotomy between [[fine art]] and [[craft]] is not commonly found in contemporary Native art. For example, the [[Cherokee Nation]] honors its greatest artists as Living Treasures, including frog- and [[Gigging|fish-gig]] makers, [[Knapping|flint knappers]], and [[Basket weaving|basket weavers]], alongside sculptors, painters, and textile artists.<ref>Chavez, Will. [http://www.cherokeephoenix.org/2179/Article.aspx 2006 Cherokee National Living Treasure artists announced.] ''The Cherokee Phoenix.'' 2006. Retrieved 1 March 2009</ref> Art historian Dawn Ades writes, "For from being inferior, or purely decorative, crafts like textiles or ceramics, have always had the possibility of being the bearers of vital knowledge, beliefs and myths."<ref>Ades, 5</ref>

Recognizable art markets between Natives and non-Natives emerged upon contact, but the 1820-1840s were a highly prolific time. In the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes region, tribes dependent upon the rapidly diminishing fur trade adopted art production a means of financial support. A painting movement known as the [[Iroquois Realist School]] emerged among the Haudenosaunee in [[New York]] in the 1820s, spearheaded by the brothers [[David Cusick|David]] and [[Dennis Cusick]].<ref>Sturtevant, p. 129</ref>

African-Ojibwe sculptor, [[Edmonia Lewis]] maintained a studio in Rome, Italy and carved [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassicist]] marble sculptors from the 1860s-1880s. Her mother belonged to the [[Mississaugas|Mississauga]] band of the [[Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation|Credit River Indian Reserve]]. Lewis exhibited widely, and a testament to her popularity during her own time was that President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] commissioned her to carve his portrait in 1877.<ref>Wolfe, pp. 12, 14, 108, and 120</ref>

[[Ho-Chunk]] artist, [[Angel DeCora]] was the best known Native American artist before World War I.<ref>Hutchinson, p. 740</ref> She was taken from her reservation and family to the [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]], where she began her lengthy formal art training.<ref>Hutchinson, p. 742</ref> Active in the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], DeCora exhibited her paintings and design widely and illustrated books by Native authors. She strove to be tribally specific in her work and was revolutionary for portraying Indians in contemporary clothing of the early 20th century. She taught art to young Native students at [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] and was an outspoken advocate of art as a means for Native Americans to maintain cultural pride, while finding a place in mainstream society.<ref>Hutchinson, p. 754</ref>

The [[Kiowa Five]] or [[Kiowa Six]], a group of Kiowa painters from Oklahoma, met with international success when their mentor, Oscar Jacobson, showed their paintings in First International Art Exposition in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1928.<ref>[http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!85940!0&term= Pochoir prints of ledger drawings by the Kiowa Five, 1929.] ''Smithsonian Institution Research Information System.''. Retrieved 1 March 2009</ref> They also participated in the 1932 [[Venice Biennale]], where their art display, according to [[Dorothy Dunn]], <U+201C>was acclaimed the most popular exhibit among all the rich and varied displays assembled.<U+201D><ref>Dunn, 240</ref>

The [[Santa Fe Indian Market]] began in 1922. [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] became Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1933 and temporarily reversed the BIA's assimilationist policies by encouraging Native American arts and culture. By this time, Native American art exhibits and the art market increased, gaining wider audiences. In the 1920s and 30s, [[Indigenist]] art movements flourished in [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Mexico]], most famously with the [[Mexican muralism|Mexican Muralist movements]].

===Basketry===
[[File:Yahgan basket.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Traditional [[Yahgan]] basket, woven by Abuela [[Cristina Calder<U+00F3>n]], Chile, photo by Jim Cadwell]][[Basket weaving]] is one of the ancient and most-widespread art forms in the Americas. From coiled [[Leymus arenarius|sea lyme grass]] baskets in Nunavut to bark baskets in Tierra del Fuego, Native artists weave baskets from a wide range of materials. Typically baskets are made of vegetable fibers, but Tohono O'odham are known for their horsehair baskets and [[Inupiaq]] artists weave baskets from [[baleen]], filtering plates of certain whales.<ref name=h17>Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 17</ref> [[Grand Traverse Band]] [[Kelly Church]], [[Wasco-Wishram]] Pat Gold, and [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] Joel Queen all weave baskets from copper sheets or wire, and [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]-[[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] conceptual artist [[Gail Tremblay]] weaves baskets in the traditional fancywork patterns of her tribes from exposed film. Basketry can take many forms. [[Haida people|Haida]] artist Lisa Telford uses cedar bark to weave both traditional functional baskets and impractical but beautiful cedar evening gowns and high-heeled shoes.<ref>[http://www.artisttrust.org/node/8696 Lisa Telford.] ''Artist Trust''.. Retrieved 16 March 2009</ref>

A range of native grasses provides material for Arctic baskets, as does baleen, which is a 20th-century development. Baleen baskets are typically embellished with walrus ivory carvings.<ref name=h17/> Cedar bark is often used in northwest coastal baskets. Throughout the Great Lakes and northeast, black ash and sweetgrass are woven into fancy work, featuring "porcupine" points, or decorated as strawberries. Bark baskets are traditional for gathering berries. [[Arundinaria|Rivercane]] is the preferred material in the Southeast, and [[Chitimacha]]s are regarded as the finest rivercane weavers. In Oklahoma, rivercane is prized but rare so baskets are typically made of honeysuckle or buckbrush runners. Coiled baskets are popular in the southwest and the Hopi and Apache in particular are known for pictorial coiled basketry plaques. The Tohono O'odham are well known for their basket-weaving prowess, and evidenced by the success of [[Annie Antone]] and [[Terrol Dew Johnson]].

[[File:Kumeyaai basket.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Kumeyaay]] coiled basket, Celestine Lachapa of Inajo, late 19th century]]California and Great Basin tribes are considered some of the finest basket weavers in the world. [[Juncus]] is a common material in southern California, while sedge, willow, redbud, and devil's claw are also used. [[Pomo]] basket weavers are known to weave 60-100 stitches per inch and their rounded, coiled baskets adorned with quail's topknots, feathers, abalone, and clamshell discs are known as "treasure baskets." Three of the most celebrated Californian basket weavers were [[Elsie Allen]] (Pomo), Laura Somersal ([[Wappo]]), and the late Pomo-[[Patwin]] medicine woman, [[Mabel McKay]],<ref>Dalrymple, p. 2</ref> known for her biography, ''Weaving the Dream''. [[Dat So La Lee|Louisa Keyser]] was a highly influential [[Washoe people|Washoe]] basket weaver.

A complex technique called "doubleweave," which involves continuously weaving both an inside and outside surface is shared by the [[Choctaw]], Cherokee, Chitimacha, [[Tarahumara]], and Venezuelan tribes. [[Mike Dart]], [[Cherokee Nation]], is a contemporary practitioner of this technique. The Tarahumara, or Raramuri, of [[Copper Canyon]], Mexico typically weave with pine needles and [[sotol]]. In [[Panama]], [[Embera-Wounaan]] peoples are renowned for their pictoral [[Astrocaryum standleyanum|chunga palm]] baskets, known as ''h<U+00F6>sig di'', colored in vivid full-spectrum of [[natural dyes]].

Retrieved 16 March 2009</ref> While in most tribes the basket weavers are often women, among the [[Waura tribe]] in Brazil, men weave baskets. They weave a wide range of styles, but the largest are called ''mayaku'', which can be two feet wide and feature tight weaves with an impressive array of designs.<ref>[http://indian-cultures.com/Cultures/waura.html Indian Cultures from Around the World: Waura Indians.] ''Hands Around the World.''. Retrieved 16 March 2009</ref>

Today basket weaving often leads to environmental activism. Indiscriminate pesticide spraying endangers basket weavers' health. The [[black ash]] tree, used by basket weavers from Michigan to Maine, is threatened by the [[emerald ash borer]]. Basket weaver Kelly Church has organized two conferences about the threat and teaches children how to harvest black ash seeds.<ref>Church, Kelly.

===Beadwork===
[[File:Nat Am beadwork sampler.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Examples of contemporary Native American beadwork]]
[[Beadwork]] is a quintessentially Native American art form, but ironically uses beads imported from Europe and Asia. Glass beads have been in use for almost five centuries in the Americas. Today a wide range of beading styles flourish.

In the Great Lakes, Ursuline nuns introduced floral patterns to tribes, who quickly applied them to beadwork.<ref>Dubin, p. 50</ref> Great Lakes tribes are known for their bandolier bags, that might take an entire year to complete.<ref>Dubin, p. 218</ref> During the 20th century the Plateau tribes, such as the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] perfected contour-style beadwork, in which the lines of beads are stitch to emphasize the pictorial imagery. Plains tribes are master beaders, and today dance regalia for man and women feature a variety of beadwork styles. While Plains and Plateau tribes are renowned for their beaded horse trappings, Subarctic tribes such as the [[Dene]] bead lavish floral dog blankets.<ref>Berlo and Philips, p. 151</ref> Eastern tribes have a completely different beadwork aesthetic, and [[Innu]], [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]], and Haudenosaunee tribes are known for symmetrical scroll motifs in white beads, called the "double curve."<ref>Berlo and Phillips, p. 146</ref> Iroquois are also known for "embossed" beading in which strings pulled taut force beads to pop up from the surface, creating a bas-relief. [[Tammy Rahr]] (Cayuga) is a contemporary practitioner of this style. [[Zuni people|Zuni]] artists have developed a tradition of three-dimensional beaded sculptures.

[[File:Huichol Trabajando.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Huichol bead artist, photo by Mario Jareda Beivide]][[Huichol people|Huichol]] Indians of [[Jalisco]] and [[Nayarit]], Mexico have a completely unique approach to beadwork. They adhere beads, one by one, to a surface, such as wood or a gourd, with a mixture of resin and beeswax.<ref>Hillman, Paul. [http://www.beadmuseumaz.org/Huichol/huichol4.htm The Huichol Web of Life: Creation and Prayer.] ''The Bead Museum.''. Retrieved 13 March 2009</ref>

Most Native beadwork is created for tribal use but beadworkers also create conceptual work for the art world. [[Richard Aitson]] ([[Kiowa]]-[[Apache]]) has both an Indian and non-Indian audience for his work and is known for his fully beaded [[cradle board|cradleboards]]. Another Kiowa beadworker, [[Teri Greeves]] has won top honors for her beadwork, which consciously integrates both traditional and contemporary motifs, such as beaded dancers on Converse high-tops. Greeves also beads on buckskin and explores such issues as warfare or Native American voting rights.<ref>Lopez, Antonio. [http://www.southwestart.com/article/747 Focus Artists: Teri Greeves.] ''Southwest Art.'' 2009. Retrieved 13 March 2009</ref>

[[Marcus Amerman]], [[Choctaw]], one of today's most celebrated bead artists, pioneered a movement of highly realistic  beaded portraits.<ref>Berlo and Phillips, p. 32</ref> His imagery ranges from 19th century Native leaders to pop icons such as Janet Jackson and Brooke Shields.

Roger Amerman, Marcus' brother, and [[Martha Berry (artist)|Martha Berry]], [[Cherokee]], have effectively revived Southeastern beadwork, a style that had been lost because of forced removal from tribes to Indian Territory. Their beadwork commonly features white bead outlines, an echo of the shell beads or pearls Southeastern tribes used before contact.<ref>Berlo and Phillips, p. 87</ref>

Jamie Okuma ([[Luise<U+00F1>o people|Luise<U+00F1>o]]-[[Shoshone]]-[[Bannock (tribe)|Bannock]]) was won top awards with her beaded dolls, which can include entire families or horses and riders, all with fully beaded regalia. The antique Venetian beads she uses can as small as size 22<U+00B0>, about the size of a grain of salt.<ref>Indyke, Dottie. [http://www.southwestart.com/article/1038 Jamie Okuma.] ''Southwest Magazine.'' 2009. Retrieved 13 March 2009</ref> [[Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty]], Rhonda Holy Bear, and Charlene Holy Bear are also prominent beaded dollmakers.

The widespread popularity of glass beads does not mean aboriginal bead making is dead. Perhaps the most famous Native bead is [[wampum]], a cylindrical tube of [[quahog]] or whelk shell. Both shells produce white beads, but only parts of the quahog produce purple. These are ceremonially and politically important to a range of [[Northeastern Woodland tribes]].<ref>Dubin, p. 170-171</ref> Elizabeth James Perry ([[Aquinnah Wampanoag]]-[[Eastern Band Cherokee]]) creates wampum jewelry today, including wampum belts.<ref>[http://www.elizabethjamesperry.com/ Original Wampum Art.] ''Elizabeth James Perry.'' 2008.

[[Eastern Band Cherokee]]s' pottery has Catawba influences.<ref>Hill, 158</ref> In Oklahoma, Cherokees lost their pottery traditions until revived by Anna Belle Sixkiller Mitchell. The [[Caddo]] tribe's centuries-long pottery tradition had died out in the early 20th century, but has been effectively revived by [[Jereldine Redcorn]].

Pueblo people are particularly known for their ceramic traditions. [[Nampeyo]] (c. 1860 <U+2013> 1942) was a [[Hopi]] potter who collaborated with anthropologists to revive traditional pottery forms and designs, and many of her relatives are successful potters today. [[Maria Martinez|Maria]] and [[Julian Martinez]], both [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]] revived their tribe's blackware tradition in the early 20th century. Julian invented a gloss-matte blackware style for which his tribe is still known today. [[Lucy Lewis]] (1898<U+2013>1992) of [[Acoma Pueblo]] gained recognition for her black-on-white ceramics in the mid-20th century. [[Cochiti Pueblo]] was known for its grotesque figurines at the turn-of-the-20th century, and these have been revived by Virgil Ortiz. Cochiti potter [[Helen Cordero]] (1915<U+2013>1994) invented [[storyteller figure]]s, which feature a large, single figure of a seated [[American Indian elder|elder]] telling stories to groups of smaller figures.<ref>[http://www.artssouthwest.com/pottery/HelenCorderobio.html Helen Cordero.] ''Arts of the Southwest.''.

While northern potters are not as well known as their southern counterparts, ceramic arts extend as far north as the Arctic. Inuit potter, [[Makituk Pingwartok]] of [[Cape Dorset]] uses a pottery wheel to create her prizewinning ceramics.<ref>[http://www.houston-north-gallery.ns.ca/inuit_pottery.htm Inuit Pottery from Alma Houston's Private Collection.] ''Houston North Gallery.''. Retrieved 17 May 2009</ref>

Today contemporary Native potters create a wide range of ceramics from functional pottery to monumental ceramic sculpture. [[Roxanne Swentzell]] of [[Santa Clara Pueblo]] is one of the leading ceramic artists in the Americas. She creates coil-built, emotionally charged figures that comment on contemporary society. [[Nora Naranjo-Morse]], also of Santa Clara Pueblo is world renowned for her individual figures as well as conceptual installations featuring ceramics.<ref>[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/waaw/peterson/Naranjo.html Nora Naranjo-Morse.] ''Women Artists of the American West.''. Retrieved 17 May 2009</ref> [[Diego Romero (artist)|Diego Romero]] of [[Cochiti Pueblo]] is known for his ceramic bowls, painted with satirical scenes that combine Ancestral Pueblo, Greek, and pop culture imagery. Hundreds more Native contemporary ceramic artists are taking pottery in new directions.

===Performance art===

[[Performance art]] is a new art form, emerging in the 1960s, and so does not carry the cultural baggage of many other art genres. Performance art can draw upon storytelling traditions, as well as music and dance, and often includes elements of installation, video, film, and textile design. [[Rebecca Belmore]], a Canadian [[Ojibway]] performance artist, has represented her country in the prestigious [[Venice Biennale]]. [[James Luna]], a [[Luise<U+00F1>o people|Luise<U+00F1>o]]-[[Mexican people|Mexican]] performance artist, also participated in the Venice Biennale in 2005,<ref>Nottage, p. 25</ref> representing the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].

Performance allows artists to confront their audience directly, challenge long held stereotypes, and bring up current issues, often in an emotionally charged manner. "[P]eople just howl in their seats, and there's ranting and booing or hissing, carrying on the in the audience," says Rebecca Belmore of the response to her work.<ref name="trick">Ryan, 146</ref> She has created performances to call attention to violence against and many unsolved murders of First Nations women. Both Belmore and Luna create elaborate, often outlandish outfits and props for their performances and move through a range of characters. For instance, a repeating character of Luna's is Uncle Jimmy,<ref>Nottage, p. 31</ref> a disabled veteran who criticizes greed and apathy on his reservation.

On the other hand, [[Marcus Amerman]], a [[Choctaw]] performance artist, maintains a consistent role of the Buffalo Man, whose irony and social commentary arise from the odd situations in which he finds himself, for instance a James Bond movie or lost in a desert labyrinth.<ref>[http://www.marcusamerman.com/creations/performance.html Performance.] ''Marcus Amerman.''.

In her words, "In order to sustain a genuine self, I create a world in which I shift to become one or all of my multiple visions of self."<ref>Lord, Erica. [http://ericalord.com/home.html Erica Lord.] 2008. Retrieved 5 March 2009</ref> She has suntanned phrases into her skin, donned cross-cultural and cross-gender disguises, and incorporated songs, ranging from [[Inuit throat singing|Inupiaq throat singing]] to racist children's rhymes into her work.

A [[Bolivia]]n [[Anarcha-feminism|anarcha-feminist]] cooperative, [[Mujeres Creando]] or "Women Creating" features many indigenous artists. They create public performances or [[street theater]] to bring attention to issues of women's, indigenous people's, and lesbian's rights, as well as anti-poverty issues. Julieta Paredes, [[Mar<U+00ED>a Galindo]] and M<U+00F3>nica Mendoza are founding members.

Performance art has allowed Native Americans access to the international art world, and Rebecca Belmore mentions that her audiences are non-Native;<ref name="trick"/> however, Native American audiences also respond to this genre. ''Bringing It All Back Home,'' a 1997 film collaboration between James Luna and [[Chris Eyre]], documents Luna's first performance at his own home, the La Jolla Indian Reservation. Luna describes the experience as "probably the scariest moment of my life as an artist ... performing for the members of my reservation in the tribal hall."<ref>Nottage, p. 30</ref>

[[File:Marmon Publicity Photo for Web.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Lee Marmon]] (Laguna Pueblo), next to his most famous photograph, "White Man's Moccasins"]]Native Americans embraced photography in the 19th century. Some even owned their own photography studios, such as [[Benjamin Haldane]] (1874<U+2013>1941), [[Tsimshian]] of [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]] Village on [[Annette Island, Alaska]],<ref>[http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/inthespirit/our_artwork.php Artwork in ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images.''] ''The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.''. Retrieved 1 March 2009</ref> [[Jennie Ross Cobb]] (1881<U+2013>1959), Cherokee Nation of [[Park Hill, Oklahoma]], and [[Richard Throssel]] (1882<U+2013>1933), [[Cree]] of [[Montana]]. Their early photographs stand in stark contrast to the romanticized images of Edward Curtis and other contemporaries. Recent scholarship by Mique<U+2019>l Askren (Tsimshian/Tlingit) on the photographs of B.A. Haldane has analyzed the functions that Haldane's photographs served for his community: as markers of success by having Anglo-style formal portraits taken, and as markers of the continuity of potlaching and traditional ceremonials by having photographs taken in ceremonial regalia. This second category is particularly significant because the use of the ceremonial regalia was against the law in Canada between 1885 and 1951.<ref>[http://travelpeapod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/bringing-our-history-into-focus/ Mique'l Askren, Bringing our History into Focus: Re-Developing the Work of B.A. Haldane, 19th-century Tsimshian Photographer, ''Blackflash: Seeing Red'', Volume 24, No. 3, 2007, pp. 41-47]</ref>
[[Mart<U+00ED>n Chambi]] (1891<U+2013>1973), a Quechua photographer from Peru, was one of the pioneering indigenous photographers of South America. [[Peter Pitseolak]] (1902<U+2013>1973), [[Inuit]] from [[Cape Dorset, Nunavut]], documented Inuit life in the mid-20th century while dealing with challenges presented by the harsh climate and extreme light conditions of the Canadian Arctic. He developed his film himself in his igloo, and some of his photos were shot by oil lamps. [[Horace Poolaw]] (1906<U+2013>1984), [[Kiowa]], shot over 2000 images of  his neighbors and relatives in Western Oklahoma from the 1920s onward. [[Jean Fredericks]] (born 1906), [[Hopi]], had to carefully negotiate cultural views towards photography and made a point of not offering his portraits of Hopi people for sale to the public.<ref>Masayesva and Younger, p. 42.</ref>

Today innumerable Native people are professional art photographers; however, acceptance to the genre has met with challenges. [[Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]]-[[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]]-[[Seminole]], has not only established a successful career with her own work, she has also been an advocate for the entire field of Native American photography. She has curated shows and organized conferences at the C.N. Gorman Museum at [[UC Davis]] featuring Native American photographers. Tsinhnahjinnie wrote the book, ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images: International Indigenous Photographers.'' Native photographers taking their skills into the fields of art videography, photocollage, digital photography, and digital art.

===Printmaking===
Although it is widely speculated that the ancient [[Adena culture|Adena]] stone tablets were used for printmaking, not much is known about aboriginal American [[printmaking]]. 20th-century Native artists have borrowed techniques from Japan and Europe, such as [[woodcut]], [[linocut]], [[serigraphy]], [[monotyping]], and other practices.

Printmaking has flourished among [[Inuit]] communities in particular. European-Canadian [[James Archibald Houston|James Houston]] created a graphic art program in [[Cape Dorset, Nunavut]] in 1957.<ref name="as">Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 49</ref> Houston taught local Inuit stone carvers how to created prints from stone-blocks and stencils. He asked local artists to draw pictures and the shop generated limited edition prints, based on the [[ukiyo-e]] workshop system of Japan. Cooperative print shops were also established in nearby communities, including [[Baker Lake, Nunavut|Baker Lake]], [[Puvirnituq, Quebec|Puvirnituq]], [[Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories|Holman]], and [[Pangnirtung]]. These shops have experimented with [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[lithography]], and silkscreen. Shops produced annual catalogs advertising their collections. Local birds and animals, spirit beings, and hunting scenes are the most popular subject matter,<ref name="as"/> but are allegorical in nature.<ref>Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 52</ref> Backgrounds tend to be minimal and perspective is mixed.<ref name=h50>Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 50</ref> One of the most prominent of Cape Dorset artists is [[Kenojuak Ashevak]] (born 1927), who has received many public commissions and two honorary doctorate degrees.<ref name=h50/> Other prominent Inuit printmakers and graphic artists include [[Parr (artist)|Parr]], [[Osuitok Ipeelee]], [[Germaine Arnaktauyok]], [[Pitseolak Ashoona]], [[Tivi Etok]], [[Helen Kalvak]], [[Jessie Oonark]], [[Kananginak Pootoogook]], [[Pudlo Pudlat]], [[Irene Avaalaaqiaq Tiktaalaaq]], and [[Simon Tookoome]]. Inuit printmaker [[Andrew Qappik]] designed the [[coat of arms of Nunavut]].

Many Native painters transformed their paintings into fine art prints. [[Potawatomi]] artist [[Woody Crumbo]] created bold, screen prints and etchings in the mid-20th century that blended traditional, flat [[Bacone College|Bacone Style]] with [[Art Deco]] influences. [[Kiowa]]-[[Caddo]]-[[Choctaw]] painter, [[T.C. Cannon]] traveled to Japan to study wood block printing from master printers.

In Chile, [[Mapuche]] printmaker [[Santos Ch<U+00E1>vez]] (1934<U+2013>2001) was one of the most celebrated artists of his country <U+2013> with over 85 solo exhibitions during his lifetime.<ref>[http://www.oll.state.oh.us/multimedia/programs/person.cfm?person_id=107528&program_id=15 Jose Santos Chavez.] ''The Ohio Channel Media Center.''. Retrieved 5 March 2009</ref>

[[Melanie Yazzie]] ([[Navajo people|Navajo]]), [[Linda Lomahaftewa]] ([[Hopi]]-[[Choctaw]]), [[Fritz Scholder]] and [[Debora Iyall]] ([[Cowlitz (tribe)|Cowlitz]]) have all built successful careers with their print and have gone on to teach the next generation of printers. [[Walla Walla (tribe)|Walla Walla]] artist, [[James Lavadour]] founded Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts on the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation|Umatilla Reservation]] in Oregon in 1992. Crow's Shadow features a state-of-the-art printmaking studio and offers workshops, exhibition space, and printmaking residencies for Native artists, in which they pair visiting artists with master printers.<ref>[http://www.crowsshadow.org/ Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts.].

===Sculpture===

[[File:Pai Tavytera indian traditional wood carving.JPG|thumb|[[Pai Tavytera]] traditional woodcarving, [[Amambay Department]], [[Paraguay]], 2008]]
Native Americans have created sculpture, both monumental and small, for millennia. Stone sculptures are ubiquitous through the Americas, in the forms of [[stelae]], [[inuksuit]], and statues. Alabaster stone carving is popular among Western tribes, where [[catlinite]] carving is traditional in the Northern Plains and [[Zuni fetish|fetish]]-carving is traditional in the Southwest, particularly among the [[Zuni people|Zuni]]. The [[Ta<U+00ED>no people|Ta<U+00ED>no]] of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] are known for their [[zemi]]s<U+2013> sacred, three-pointed stone sculptures.

[[Inuit art]]ists sculpt with walrus ivory, caribou antlers, bones, soapstone, serpentinite, and argillite. They often represent local fauna and humans engaged in hunting or ceremonial activities.

Edmonia Lewis paved the way for Native American artists to sculpt in mainstream traditions using non-Native materials. [[Allan Houser]] ([[Warms Springs Chiricahua Apache]]) became one of most prominent Native sculptors of the 20th century. Though he worked in wood and stone, Houser is most known for his monumental bronze sculptors, both representational and abstract. Houser influenced a generation of Native sculptors by teaching at the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]]. His two sons, Phillip and [[Bob Haozous]] are sculptors today. [[Roxanne Swentzell]] ([[Santa Clara Pueblo]]) is known for her expressive, figurative, ceramic sculptures but has also branched into bronze casting, and her work is permanently displayed at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].

The Northwest Coastal tribes are known for their woodcarving <U+2013> most famously their monumental [[totem pole]]s that display clan crests. During the 19th century and early 20th century, this art form was threatened but was effectively revived. [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] totem pole carvers such as Charlie James, [[Mungo Martin]], [[Ellen Neel]], and [[Willie Seaweed]] kept the art alive and also carved masks, furniture, bentwood boxes, and jewelry. Haida carvers include [[Charles Edenshaw]], [[Bill Reid]], and [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]]. Besides working in wood, Haida also work with [[Haida Argillite Carvings|argillite]]. Traditional formline designs translate well into glass sculpture, which is increasingly popular thanks to efforts by contemporary glass artists such as [[Preston Singletary]] ([[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]), [[Susan Point]] ([[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]]) and Marvin Oliver ([[Quinault people|Quinault]]/[[Isleta Pueblo]]).<ref>Tall Chief, Russ.

In the Southeast, woodcarving dominates sculpture. [[Willard Stone]], of Cherokee descent, exhibited internationally in the mid-20th century. [[Amanda Crowe]] ([[Eastern Band Cherokee]]) studied sculpture at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and returned to her reservation to teach over 2000 students woodcarving over a period of 40 years, ensuring that sculpture thrives as an art form on the Qualla Boundary.<ref>[http://www.cherokeeheritagetrails.org/elderart/eld05.html Amanda Crowe.] ''Cherokee Heritage Trails.'' 2003.

''Art of the Andes'', p. 17</ref> Cotton and wool from alpaca, llamas, and vicu<U+00F1>as have been woven into elaborate textiles for thousands of years in the Andes and are still important parts of Quechua and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] culture today. Coroma in [[Antonio Quijarro Province]], [[Bolivia]] is a major center for ceremonial textile production.<ref>Siegal, p. 15</ref> An Aymara elder from Coroma said, "In our sacred weavings are expressions of our philosophy, and the basis for our social organization... The sacred weavings are also important in differentiating one community, or ethnic group, from a neighboring group..."<ref>Siegal, p. 15-16</ref></blockquote>

[[File:KunaWomanWithMolas.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Kuna woman with molas, [[San Blas Islands]], [[Panama]].]]
[[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] tribal members of [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]] are famous for their [[Mola (art form)|mola]]s, cotton panels with elaborate geometric designs created by a reverse [[appliqu<U+00E9>]] technique. Designs originated from traditional skin painting designs but today exhibit a wide range of influences, including [[pop culture]]. Two mola panels form a blouse, but when a Kuna woman is tired of a blouse, she can dissemble it and sell the molas to art collectors.<ref>[http://www.panart.com/molainfo.htm About Molas.] ''Indigenous Art from Panam<U+00E1>.''. Retrieved 28 March 2009</ref>

Mayan women have woven cotton with backstrap looms for centuries, creating items such as ''[[huipil]]s'' or traditional blouses. Elaborate [[Maya textiles]] featured representations of animals, plants, and figures from oral history.<ref>Geise, Paula. [http://www.mythinglinks.org/Geise~MayanWeaving.html Clothing, Regalia, Textiles from the Chiapas Highlands of Mexico.] ''Mything Links.'' 22 December 1999. Retrieved 28 March 2009</ref> Organizing into weaving collectives have helped Mayan women earn better money for their work and greatly expand the reach of Mayan textiles in the world.

[[Seminole]] seamstresses, upon gaining access to sewing machines in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, invented an elaborate appliqu<U+00E9> patchwork tradition. Seminole patchwork, for which the tribe is known today, came into full flower in the 1920s.<ref>Blackard, David M. and Patsy West. [http://www.seminoletribe.com/culture/clothing.shtml Seminole Clothing: Colorful Patchwork.] ''Seminole Tribe of Florida.''. Retrieved 11 April 2009</ref>

Great Lakes and Prairie tribes are known for their [[ribbonwork]], found on clothing and blankets. Strips of silk ribbons are cut and appliqu<U+00E9>d in layers, creating designs defined by negative space. The colors and designs might reflect the clan or gender of the wearer. [[Powwow]] and other dance regalia from these tribes often feature ribbonwork. These tribes are also known for their [[Fingerweaving|fingerwoven]] sashes.

[[Pueblo]] men weave with cotton on upright looms. Their mantas and sashes are typically made for ceremonial use for the community, not for outside collectors.

[[File:Seminole patchwork shawl.jpg|left|thumb|[[Seminole patchwork]] shawl made by Susie Cypress from [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]], c. 1980s]]
[[Navajo rug]]s are woven by Navajo women today from [[Navajo-Churro sheep]] or commercial wool. Designs can be pictorial or abstract, based on traditional Navajo, Spanish, Oriental, or Persian designs. 20th-century Navajo weavers include [[Clara Sherman]] and [[Hosteen Klah]], who co-founded the [[Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian]].

In 1973, the Navajo Studies Department of the [[Din<U+00E9> College]] in [[Many Farms, Arizona]], wanted to determine how long it took a [[Navajo weaving|Navajo weaver]] to create a rug or blanket from [[sheep shearing]] to market. The study determined the total amount of time was 345 hours. Out of these 345 hours, the expert Navajo weaver needed: 45 hours to shear the sheep and process the wool; 24 hours to [[spinning (textiles)|spin]] the [[wool]]; 60 hours to prepare the [[dye]] and to dye the wool; 215 hours to [[weaving|weave]] the piece; and only one hour to sell the item in their shop.<ref>http://nativeamerican-art.com/navajo-blankets.html</ref>

Traditional textiles of Northwest Coast tribes are enjoying a dramatic revival. [[Chilkat weaving]] and ravenstail weaving are regarded as some of the most difficult weaving techniques in the world. A single Chilkat blanket can take an entire year to weave. In both techniques, dog, mountain goat, or sheep wool and shredded cedar bark are combined to create textiles featuring curvilinear [[formline designs]]. [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] weaver [[Jennie Thlunaut]] (1982<U+2013>1986) was instrumental in this revival.

Experimental contemporary textile artists include Martha Gradolf ([[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]]), whose work is overtly political in nature.<ref>Perry, Rachel.

==Cultural sensitivity and repatriation==
As in most cultures, Native peoples create some works that are to be used only in sacred, private ceremonies. Many sacred objects or items that contain medicine are to be seen or touched by certain individuals with specialized knowledge. Many [[Pueblo people|Pueblo]] and [[Hopi]] [[kachina|katsina]] figures (''tih<U+00FC>'' in [[Hopi language|Hopi]] and ''kokko'' in [[Zuni language|Zuni]]) and katsinam regalia are not meant to be seen by individuals who have not received instruction about that particular katsina. Many institutions do not display these publicly out of respect for tribal taboos.<ref>[http://sarweb.org/?resources_katsinam "Katsinam from the IARC Collection."] ''School for Advanced Research.''. Retrieved 15 May 2011</ref>

[[Mide]] [[birch bark scroll]]s are deemed too culturally sensitive for public display,<ref>[http://www.sas.upenn.edu/dpic/Drum/Welcome/VirtualMuseum/Artifacts/Scrolls "Birch Bark Scrolls."] ''University of Pennsylvania, School of Arts and Sciences.''.

Retrieved 15 May 2011</ref>

[[Navajo sandpainting]] is a component for healing ceremonies, but sandpaintings can be made into permanent art that is acceptable to sell to non-Natives as long as Holy People are not portrayed.<ref>[http://www.crystalinks.com/navajos.html "Sand Painting."] ''Crystal Links: Navajo Nation.''. Retrieved 16 May 2011</ref> Various tribes prohibit photography of many sacred ceremonies, as used to be the case in many Western cultures.  As several early photographers broke local laws, photographs of sensitive ceremonies are in circulation, but tribes prefer that they not be displayed. The same can be said for photographs or sketches of medicine bundle contents.

Two [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leaders sued a museum, trying to remove a [[False Face Society mask]] or ''Ga:goh:sah'' from an exhibit because "it was a medicine object intended to be seen only by community members and that its public display would cause irreparable harm to the Mohawk."<ref name=phil>Phillips 49</ref> The Grand Council of the [[Haudenosaunee]] has ruled that such masks are not for sale or public display,<ref name=false/> nor are Corn Husk Society masks.<ref name=corn/>

Tribes and individuals within tribes do not always agree about what is or is not appropriate to display to the public. Many institutions do not exhibit [[Ghost Dance]] regalia. At the request of tribal leaders, the [[Brooklyn Museum]] is among those that does not exhibit Plains warrior's shields or "artifacts imbued with a warrior's power".<ref>Rosenbaum, Lee. [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703559604576176511431781844.html?mod=wsj_share_twitter#articleTabs%3Darticle "Shows That Defy Stereotypes"], ''Wall Street Journal.'' 15 March 2011. Retrieved 15 May 2011</ref> Many tribes do not want grave goods or items associated with burials, such as funerary urns, in museums, and many would like associated grave goods reinterred.
