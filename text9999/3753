Lynch has released one [[studio album]] and two [[live album|live albums]] along with a live [[DVD]].  He appeared on his own ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' special and starred in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] adaptation of ''[[The Wedding Singer]]''.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lynch was born in [[Abington Township, Pennsylvania|Abington]], [[Pennsylvania]]<ref>[http://www.lynch-mob.net/ Lynch-Mob.net]</ref>.  His family later moved to [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], [[Michigan]].  While in Michigan, Lynch would perform in [[community theater]] and in [[musical theater]] at his high school.  Lynch would stay in Michigan until graduated from [[Western Michigan University]] and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[drama]] in [[1993]].  It was at [[Western Michigan University]] that he found his talent as a comedic song-writer.

Considering himself a musician first and a comedian second<ref name = "What Are Records?" /><ref name = "Recoil">[http://www.recoilmag.com/interviews/stephen_lynch_1005.html Recoil: Interview with Stephen Lynch]</ref><ref name = "UGO">[http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/stephenlynch/default.asp UGO.com Music - Stephen Lynch Interview]</ref>, Lynch cites singer/songwriters [[Paul Simon]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] as his childhood inspirations, rather than comics.<ref name = "What Are Records?" /> The mockumentary ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'' was his greatest inspiration, and led him to decide his career path<ref name = "Stephen Lynch: Press">[http://www.stephenlynch.com/press/index.html Stephen Lynch: Press]</ref>.  The first song that he wrote was a country song titled [[Beefy Burrito]]<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/stephenlynch http://www.myspace.com/stephenlynch]</ref>.

===Early career===
After spending his first year out of college with friends in [[California]]<ref name = "M & C">[http://arts.monstersandcritics.com/features/article_1166663.php/Stephen_Lynch_From_comic_songster_to_Wedding_Singer Monsters and Critics: Stephen Lynch: From comic songster to 'Wedding Singer']</ref>, Lynch moved to [[New York City]] in [[1996]] with the intention of becoming an actor.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/415137p-350834c.html New York Daily News - Entertainment: 'Wedding' Zinger]</ref> Upon his arrival, a friend at the West Bank Cafe on 42nd Street suggested Lynch play some of the comic songs he had written while attending university for an audience<ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" />. He soon found great success in comedy clubs and other venues around the city (notably [[Catch a Rising Star]]<ref name = "What Are Records?" /> and [[Caroline's]]<ref name = "Stephen Lynch: Tour History">[http://www.stephenlynch.com/tour/history.html Stephen Lynch: Tour History]</ref>), and became a regular on radio shows such as ''[[Opie and Anthony]]''<ref name = "What Are Records?" /><ref name = "Stephen Lynch: Press" />. Lynch spent his early years in [[New York City]] doing what he called "totally mindless work" in french vanilla coffee shops and banks.  He quit such temporary jobs permanently, signed with [[What Are Records?]] in the year [[2000]] and the famed [[William Morris Agency]] in [[2001]]<ref name = "M & C" />. Over the next few years, he toured colleges, universities and [[nightclubs]] around the country, avoiding as much as possible the comedy club crowd, which he has stated is not to his taste.  He periodically satisfied his love of the stage by returning to Michigan and doing summer stock.<ref name = "WMA" /><ref name = "Playbill" />

===2000 to Present===
As a result of the duality of his act, Lynch turned heads in the music industry as well as on the comedy circuit. He attracted extra attention usually not available to comics by playing venues more often suited to music than to comedy (eventually graduating to hugely famous locations such as the [[House of Blues]], [[The Town Hall]]<ref name = "UGO" /> and the esteemed [[Kennedy Center]])<ref name = "Stephen Lynch: Tour History" />. He gained great national exposure with his ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' special in [[2000]], one of the highest rated in the network's history. He has made appearances on ''[[Comedy Central]]'''s ''[[Premium Blend]]'', ''[[The World Comedy Tour]]'' and ''[[The World Stands Up]]''. He has also made four appearances on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'', and has performed at the prestigious ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' Comedy Festival in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]].<ref name = "Stephen Lynch: Press" /> In addition, Lynch was voted by an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] columnist as one of America's sexiest men, and has acquired a devoted following of besotted female fans.

Lynch has opened for comedians [[Jay Mohr]], [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Steven Wright]], [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] and [[Lewis Black]].  In the summer of [[2004]], he went on a tour co-headlining with [[Mitch Hedberg]]. The tour was such a success that they added an extra leg and ran into [[2005]]. This was the last tour of Hedberg's before his death.

He has also appeared in five short films, including ''[[The Love Seat]]'' in [[1999]] and ''[[The Confetti Brothers]]'' in [[2001]]<ref name = "WMA" /><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1392557/ IMDb: Stephen Lynch (II)]</ref><ref name = "Broadway.com" />. Both films were written and directed by [[Kirker Butler]]. ''[[The Confetti Brothers]]'', a [[satire]], screened to packed houses at the [[2001]] [[Cannes Film Festival]]. It continues to play the film festival circuit.<ref name = "courier-journal.com">[http://www.courier-journal.com/scene/movies/features/2002/20020702butler.html courier-journal.com: Louisville Scene: Hollywood's Kentucky connection adds a link]</ref>

In [[April 2006]], Lynch starred in the title role of Robbie Hart in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Wedding Singer (musical)|The Wedding Singer]]'', which ran on Broadway from [[April 27]], [[2006]] through [[December 31]], [[2006]] at the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre]].<ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" />. This musical production was based on the [[1998]] [[New Line Cinema]] film ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' starring [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. The musical, Lynch's Broadway debut<ref name = "Broadway.com" /><ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" />, co-starred two-time [[Tony Award]] nominee [[Laura Benanti]] in the role of Julia Sullivan, originated by Barrymore in the film. The April [[2006]] opening followed a successful preview run in [[Seattle]] at [[5th Avenue Theatre|The 5th Avenue Theatre]] which ran from [[January 31]]-[[February 19]]. His performance has earned him nominations for [[Drama League Award|Drama League]] and [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] awards,<ref name = "Playbill" /> as well as a nomination for the coveted [[Tony Award]].<ref>[http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/index.html The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards: NOMINEES & AWARDS: 2006 Nominations]</ref>

In [[2007]], Lynch returned to the road again to perform his stand-up musical comedy.  Lynch is currently touring with comedians such as [[Bob Saget]], [[Frank Caliendo]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Carlos Mencia]] and others on the [[Opie and Anthony]] [[Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus Comedy our 2007|Traveling Virus Comedy Tour 2007]].  During stops in [[East Lansing, MI]] and [[New Brunswick, NJ]], Lynch ad-libbed the start of a new song titled "Little Gay Robot". His other new songs include "Peanuts," which is based on the Charles Shultz comic strip and several "Diary Entries" where he makes fun of various people throughout history.

===Family and friends===
Family and friends prove to be an important influence on Lynch's work and career. He married [[Erin Dwight]] on a private beach on [[Lake Michigan]]<ref name = "Playbill" /> in [[September 2003]], and she is generally the first person to hear his original ideas for songs. He trusts so deeply in her taste that if she does not laugh at the initial concept, he will scrap the idea completely.<ref name = "Recoil" /> Dwight recorded a short film while her husband was away touring, called ''Lynch and Teich in Brooklyn'', to show that she missed him.  This was included in the extras on his [[2004]] concert DVD, ''[[Live at the El Rey]]''. She also co-created the cover concept for his latest album, ''[[The Craig Machine]]'', with her mother, [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]] photographer [[Fran Dwight]].

Lynch has a younger brother, [[Drew Lynch]], who also writes comedic songs, and they occasionally tour together. Their parents are a former [[priest]] and a former [[nun]]<ref>{{cite news| first=Andrew| last=Guyton| authorlink=User:Disavian| url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-11-18/entertainment/2| title=Stephen Lynch satisfies with Craig Machine| work=[[The Technique]]| date=2005-11-18| accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref><ref name = "M & C" />, making it an amusing surprise to some that they are very supportive of their sons' risque comedy and have attended several of their shows. Both parents became teachers.<ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" /> Lynch has stated that religion was not forced upon him growing up, and although he was raised [[Roman Catholic]] he no longer attends church.  His upbringing included liberalism as well as religion, which is reflected through his father's past as part of a singing duo that attended many peace rallies and antiwar protests during the [[Vietnam War]]<ref name = "M & C" />. Like his sons, Lynch's father is a stage actor as well as a singer, and musical talent and interest runs in their family. Lynch's earliest work in the theater was performing with his father in local community theater productions in Saginaw as a child. The first live musical he got to see was ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', a community theater production in which his father played the role of the Padre.<ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" /><ref name = "Playbill" />

As Lynch's repertoire of material includes some duets and also a few songs for three voices, close university pals and fellow comedians [[Mark Teich]] (of [[The Second City]]) and [[Rod Cone]] (of [[The Rod Cone Situation]]) are also very frequent guests on his tours, and he rarely tours alone. He has also done shows with former Wedding Singer castmate David Josefsberg.<ref>[http://www.lynch-mob.net Lynch-mob.net]</ref>

Stephen Lynch resides in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]] with his wife.<ref name = "Playbill" />
