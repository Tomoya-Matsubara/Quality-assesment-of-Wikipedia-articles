The '''Western Ganga Dynasty''' ([[350]] <U+2013> [[1000]] CE) ([[Kannada]]:<U+0CAA><U+0CB6><U+0CCD><U+0C9A><U+0CBF><U+0CAE> <U+0C97><U+0C82><U+0C97> <U+0CB8><U+0C82><U+0CB8><U+0CCD><U+0CA5><U+0CBE><U+0CA8>) was an important ruling dynasty of ancient [[Karnataka]] in [[India]]. They are known as '''Western Gangas''' to distinguish them from the '''Eastern Gangas''' who in later centuries ruled over modern [[Orissa]]. The general belief is the Western Gangas began their rule during a time when multiple native clans asserted their freedom due to the weakening of the [[Pallava]] empire in [[South India]], a geo-political event sometimes attributed to the southern conquests of [[Samudra Gupta]]. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, initially ruling from [[Kolar]] and later moving their capital to [[Talakad]] on the banks of the [[Kaveri River]] in modern [[Mysore district]]. 

After the rise of the imperial [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas of Badami]],  the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and  fought for the cause of their overlords against the  [[Pallavas]] of [[Kanchi]]. The Chalukyas were replaced by the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta]] in 753 CE as the dominant power in the [[Deccan]].  After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought along side them against their foes, the [[Chola Dynasty]] of [[Tanjavur]]. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the [[Kaveri]] river. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region. 

Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to polity, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage towards Jainism resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and [[Sanskrit]] flourished. 9th century Kannada literature refer to the Ganga King [[Durvinita]] of 6th century as an early writer in [[Kannada language]] prose. Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from [[religion]] to [[elephant]] management. 

==History==
{{see also|Origin of the Western Ganga Dynasty}}
Multiple theories have been proposed regarding the ancestry of the founders of the Western Ganga dynasty (prior to the 4th century).{{Western Ganga Kings Infobox}} Some mythical accounts point to a [[North India|northern]] origin<ref name="kanva">(Rice in Adiga 2006, p88)</ref><ref name="kudd">Jayaswal in {{cite web|title=Gangas of Talkad|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka11.htm|author=Arthikaje,Mangalore|publisher=1998-2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref> while theories based on [[epigraphy]] propose a [[South India|southern]] origin.

It is theorised that the Gangas may have taken advantage of the confusion caused by the invasion of southern India by the [[North India|northern]] king [[Samudra Gupta]] prior to 350, and carved out a kingdom for themselves. The area they controlled was called Gangavadi and included regions of the modern districts of [[Mysore district|Mysore]], [[Chamarajanagar district|Chamarajanagar]], [[Tumkur district|Tumkur]], [[Kolar district|Kolar]], [[Mandya district|Mandya]] and [[Bangalore district|Bangalore]] in Karnataka state.<ref name="bang">Kamath (2001), pp39-40</ref>  At times, they also controlled some areas in modern [[Tamil Nadu]] (Kongu region starting from the 6th century rule of King Avinita) and [[Andhra Pradesh]] (Ananthpur region starting from middle of 5th century).<ref name="grow"/> The founding king of the dynasty was Konganivarman Madhava who made [[Kolar]] his capital around 350 and ruled for about twenty years.  

By the time of Harivarman in 390, the Gangas had consolidated their kingdom with [[Talakad]] as their capital. Their move from the early capital Kolar may have been a strategic one with the intention of containing the growing [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] power.<ref name="grow">Sarma (1992), p4</ref> By 430 they had consolidated their eastern territories comprising modern Bangalore, Kolar and Tumkur districts and by 470 they had gained control over Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu, Sendraka (modern [[Chikkamagaluru]] and [[Belur]]), Punnata and Pannada regions (comprising modern [[Heggadadevanakote]] and [[Nanjangud]]) in modern Karnataka.<ref name="issue">Adiga 2006, p97, p100</ref><ref name="insc">From the Cakra-Kedara grant, Kodunjeruvu grant  (Adiga 2006, p99</ref> In 529, King [[Durvinita]] ascended the throne after waging a war with his younger brother who was favoured by his father, King [[Avinita]].<ref name="crown">Kamath (2001), p40</ref> Some accounts suggest that in this power struggle, the Pallavas of Kanchi supported Avinita's choice of heir and the Badami Chalukya King Vijayaditya supported his father-in-law, Durvinita.<ref name="sides">Sheik Ali and Ramesh in Adiga (2006), p100-101</ref>  From the inscriptions it is known that these battles were fought in Tondaimandalam and Kongu regions (northern Tamil Nadu) prompting historians to suggest that Durvinita fought the Pallavas successfully.<ref name="tondai">Adiga (2006), p101</ref>  Considered the most successful of the Ganga kings, Durvinita was well versed in arts such as music, dance, [[ayurveda]] and taming wild elephants.

In the south, the [[Chola Dynasty]] who were seeing a resurgence of power under [[Rajaraja Chola I]] conquered Gangavadi around the year 1000, bringing the Western Ganga dynasty to an end. Thereafter, large areas of south Karnataka region came under Chola control for about a century.<ref name="controlling">Kamath (2001), p118</ref>

The Western Ganga administration was influenced by principles stated in the ancient text ''[[Arthashastra]]''. The ''praje gavundas'' mentioned in the Ganga records held similar responsibilities as the village elders (''gramavriddhas'') mentioned by [[Kautilya]]. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked.<ref name="admin1">Kamath (2001), p46</ref> The kingdom was divided into ''Rashtra'' (district) and further into ''Visaya'' (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and ''Desa''. From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term ''Visaya'' was replaced by the Kannada term ''Nadu''. Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000,<ref name="admin2">Adiga (2006), p10</ref> with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms<ref name="admin3">Rice in Adiga (2006), p15)</ref> or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division<ref name="admin5">Sharma in Adiga (2006), p16</ref> or the number of villages included in that territory.<ref name="admin3"/> 

[[Epigraph|Inscriptions]] have revealed several important administrative designations such as prime minister (''sarvadhikari''), treasurer (''shribhandari''), foreign minister (''sandhivirgrahi'') and chief minister (''mahapradhana''). All of these positions came with an additional title of commander (''dandanayaka''). Other designations were royal steward (''manevergade''), master of robes (''mahapasayita''), commander of elephant corps (''gajasahani''), commander of cavalry (''thuragasahani'') etc.<ref name="admin7">Kamath (2001), p47</ref> In the royal house, ''[[Niyogi]]s'' oversaw palace administration, royal clothing and jewelery etc. and the ''Padiyara'' were responsible for court ceremonies including door keeping and protocol.<ref name="admin 29"> Adiga (2006), p238</ref>  

Officials at the local level were the ''pergade'', ''nadabova'', ''nalagamiga'', ''prabhu'' and ''gavunda''.<ref name="admin8">Adiga (2006), pp161-177</ref> The ''pergades'' were superintendents from all social classes such as artisans, gold smiths, black smiths etc. The ''pergades'' dealing with the royal household were called ''manepergade'' (house superintendent) and those who collected tolls were called ''Sunka vergades''.<ref name="admin9">From the Kanatur inscription (Adiga 2006, p161)</ref> The ''nadabovas'' were accountants and tax collectors at the ''Nadu'' level and sometimes functioned as scribes.<ref name="admin11">From the Kanatur inscription (Adiga 2006, p164)</ref> The ''nalagamigas'' were officers who organized and maintained defence at the ''Nadu'' level.<ref name="admin12">From the Mavali inscription of 8th century and Indravalli inscription (Adiga 2006), p165</ref> The ''prabhu'' constituted a group of elite people drawn together to witness land grants and demarcation of land boundaries.<ref name="admin13">Doddakunce inscription, the Karagada and Maruru inscription (Adiga 2006, p167-68)</ref> The ''gavundas'' who appear most often in inscriptions were the backbone of medieval polity of the southern Karnataka region.

Inscriptions that specify land grants, rights and ownership were descriptive of the boundaries of demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (''kote'') if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included was the type of soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation.<ref name="admin22">From the Kumsi inscription of 931 and Doddahomma inscription of 977 (Adiga 2006, pp21-22, p27, p29)</ref><ref name="admin23">From the Mavali inscription and Indivalli inscription (Adiga 2006, p31)</ref> Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land.<ref name="admin24">From the Devarahalli and Hosur copper plates (Adiga 2006, p33)</ref> There are numerous references to hamlets (''palli'') belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (''bedapalli'').<ref name="admin25">From inscriptions and literary writings such as ''Vaddaradhane'' (920) and ''Pampa Bharata'' (940) (Adiga 2006, p36-37)</ref> From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title ''arasa''. The ''arasas'' were either [[brahmin]]s or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king.<ref name="admin27">Adiga (2006), p208</ref> The ''velavali'' who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (''vele'').

{{KarnatakaHistory}}
The Gangavadi region consisted of the [[malnad]] region, the plains ([[Bayaluseemae]]) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, [[betel]] leaves, [[cardamom]] and [[pepper]] and the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced [[rice]], millets such as [[ragi]] and [[corn]], pulses, [[oilseed]]s and it was also the base for cattle farming.<ref name="eco1">Adiga (2006), p6</ref> The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra]] and [[Vedavati]] rivers where cultivations of [[sugarcane]], paddy, [[coconut]], [[areca]] nut (''adeka totta''), betel leaves, [[plantain]] and flowers (''vara vana'') were common.<ref name="eco2">Adiga (2006), p10</ref><ref name="eco13">from the Melkote copper plates and Mamballi inscriptions, Medutambihalli inscription of 9th century (Adiga 2006, p53)</ref>  Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (''Katta'').<ref name="eco5">Adiga (2006), p42</ref> Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.<ref name="eco6">Adiga (2006), p45</ref>

Soil types mentioned in records are black soil (''Karimaniya'') in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil (''Kebbayya mannu'')<ref name="eco7">from the Narasimhapura plates (Adiga 2006), p46</ref><ref name="eco8">From the Doddahomma inscription of Rachaballa IV of 977 (Adiga 2006, p47)</ref> Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land and to a lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called ''kalani'', ''galde'', ''nir mannu'' or ''nir panya'' and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water.<ref name="eco9">Kittel in Adiga (2006), p48</ref> The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms ''gosahasra'' (a thousand cows), ''gasara'' (owner of cows), ''gosasi'' (donor of cows), ''goyiti'' (cowherdess), ''gosasa'' (protector of cows) attest to this.<ref name="eco14">Belagi inscription of 964, Sasarvalli inscription of 1001 (Krishna and Adiga 2006, p55/56)</ref> Inscriptions indicate ownership of cows may have been as important as cultivable land and that there may have existed a social hierarchy based on this.<ref name="eco15">Adiga (2006), p57</ref> Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women (''pendir-udeyulcal''), abduction of women by ''bedas'' (hunter tribes); all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age.<ref name="eco17">From the Kodagu inscription of 11th century, Guduve inscription of 1032, Kambadahalli inscription of 979 (Adiga 2006, p59, p60, p63)</ref> 

Lands that were exempt from taxes were called ''manya'' and sometimes consisted of  several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without any reference to the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished in the line of duty were called ''bilavritti'' or ''kalnad''.<ref name="eco19">From the Narasimhapura inscription of 9th century (Sircar and Ramesh in Adiga 2006, pp210-211)</ref>  When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called ''Talavritti''.<ref name="eco21">Indian epigraphical glossary, Hecca inscription pF 939 for SriKanteshvara temple (Adiga 2006, p213)</ref> Some types of taxes on income were ''kara'' or ''anthakara'' (internal taxes), ''utkota'' (gifts due to the king), ''hiranya'' (cash payments) and ''sulika'' (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.<ref name="eco23">From Nonamangala copper plates of 5th century of King Avinita (Adiga 2006, p216)</ref><ref name="eco24">From the Kuppepalya inscription of 8th century (Adiga 2006, p218)</ref>

''Siddhaya'' was a local tax levied on agriculture and ''pottondi'' was a tax levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler. Based on context, ''pottondi'' also meant 1/10th, ''aydalavi'' meant 1/5th and ''elalavi'' meant 1/7th.<ref name="eco25">Kotutu inscription of 9th century, Rampura inscription of 905 (Adiga 2006, p219)</ref> ''Mannadare'' literally meant land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax (''Kurimbadere'') payable to the chief of shepherds. ''Bhaga'' meant a portion or share of the produce from land or the land area itself. Minor taxes such as ''Kirudere'' (due to the landlords) and ''samathadere'' (raised by the army officers or ''samantha'') are mentioned. In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer's retinue, villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battles.<ref name="eco27">Varuna inscription, (Adiga 2006, p223-224)</ref> ''Bittuvatta'' or ''niravari'' taxes comprised usually of a percentage of the produce and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks.<ref name="eco229">Adiga (2006), p230</ref>

The Western Ganga society in many ways reflected the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of Kundattur<ref name="soci1">From the Kuntur inscription of 10th century (Adiga 2006, p203)</ref> and the queens of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and feudal king Permadi.<ref name="soci12">Karmarkar (1947), p66</ref> Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by the son-in-law, the wife or by the daughter is evident. The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of ''nalgavunda'' (local landlord) bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, the wife of a fallen hero are examples.

[[Image:Kambadahalli Ganga carving5.JPG|thumb|right|Roof sculpture, Panchakuta basadi at Kambadahalli]]
The Western Ganga rule was a period of brisk literary activity in Sanskrit and Kannada, though many of the writings are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them.<ref name="durvi"/> Chavundaraya's writing, ''Chavundaraya Purana'' (or ''Trishashtilakshana mahapurana'') of 978 CE, is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings, ''Adipurana'' and ''Uttarapurana'' which were written a century earlier by Jinasena and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta [[Amoghavarsha I]]. The prose, composed in lucid Kannada, was mainly targeted for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. His writings seem to be influenced by the writings of his predecessor [[Adikavi Pampa]] and contemporary [[Ranna]]. The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty-four Jain [[Tirthankar]]s, twelve ''Chakravartis'', nine ''Balabhadras'' , nine ''Narayanas'' and nine ''Pratinarayanas''.<ref name="jain">Sastri (1955), p357</ref><ref name="prop">Kulkarni (1975) in Adiga (2006), p256</ref> 

The earliest known Kannada writer from this dynasty is King Durvinita of the 6th century. [[Kavirajamarga]] of 850 CE, refers to him as an early writer of Kannada [[prose]].<ref name="dur">Sastri (1955), p355</ref><ref name="dur1">Kamath (2001), p40</ref><ref name="dur2">Narasimhacharya (1988), p2</ref> Around 900 CE, Gunavarma I authored the Kannada works, ''Sudraka'' and ''Harivamsa''. His writings are considered extinct but references to these writings are found in later years. He is known to have been patronised by King Ereganga Neetimarga II. In ''Sudraka'', he has favourably compared his patron to King Sudraka of ancient times.<ref name="gun">kamath (2001), p50</ref><ref name="gun1">Narasimhacharya (1988), p18</ref> The great Kannada poet Ranna was patronised by Chavundaraya in his early literary days.<ref name="gem">One among the three gems of Kannada literature (Sastri 1955, p356)</ref> Ranna's classic ''Parashurama charite'' is considered a eulogy of his patron who held such titles as ''Samara Parashurama''.<ref name="ran1">Kamath (2001), p45</ref>

[[Nagavarma I]], a brahmin scholar who came from [[Vengi]] in modern Andhra Pradesh (late 10th century) was also patronised by Chavundaraya. He wrote ''Chandombudhi'' (ocean of prosody) addressed to his wife. This is considered the earliest available Kannada writing in [[prosody]].<ref name="nag">Sastri (1955), p357</ref><ref name="nag1">Narasimhacharya (1988), p18</ref> He also wrote one of the earliest available [[romance]] classics in Kannada called ''Karnataka Kadambari'' in sweet and flowing ''champu'' (mixed verse and prose) style. It is based on an earlier romantic work in Sanskrit by poet Bana and is popular among critics.<ref name="nag"/><ref name="nag1"/> ''Gajashtaka'', a rare Kannada work on elephant management was written by King Shivamara II around 800 CE but this work is now considered extinct.<ref name="shiv">Kamath (2001), p50</ref> Other writers such as Manasiga and Chandrabhatta were known to be popular in the 10th century.<ref name="man">Narasimhacharya (1988), p19</ref>

In an age of classical Sanskrit literature, Madhava II (brother of King Vishnugopa) wrote a treatise ''Dattaka Sutravritti'' which was based on an earlier work on erotics by a writer called Dattaka. A Sanskrit version of ''Vaddakatha'', a commentary on [[Panini (grammarian)|Panini's]] grammar called ''Sabdavathara'' and a commentary on the 15th chapter of a Sanskrit work called ''Kiratarjunneya'' by poet Bharavi (who was in Durvinita's court) are ascribed to Durvinita.<ref name="durvi">Kamath (2001), p49</ref> King Shivamara II is known to have written ''Gajamata Kalpana''.<ref name="durvi"/> Hemasena, also known as Vidya Dhananjaya authored  ''Raghavapandaviya'', a narration of the stories of [[Rama]] and the [[Pandava]]s simultaneously through puns.<ref name="pand">Venkatasubbiah in Kamath (2001), p50</ref> ''Gayachintamani'' and ''Kshatrachudamini'' which were based on poet Bana's work ''Kadambari'' were written by Hemasena's pupil Vadeebhasimha in prose style.<ref name="vad">Kamath (2001), p50</ref> and Chavundaraya wrote ''Charitarasara''.<ref name="chav">Kamath (2001), p45</ref>

The Western Ganga style of architecture was influenced by the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, in addition to with indigenous Jain features.<ref name="architecture">Reddy, Sharma and Krishna Rao in Kamath (2001), pp 50-52</ref> The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head, the stepped ''[[Sikhara|Vimana]]'' of the shrine with horizontal [[Molding (decorative)|moulding]]s  and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and Nolambas.<ref name="arc">Kamath (2001), p50</ref> 

The monolith of [[Gomateshwara]] commissioned by Chavundaraya is considered the high point of the Ganga sculptural contribution in ancient Karnataka. Carved from fine-grained white granite, the image stands on a lotus. It has no support up to the thighs and is 60 feet tall with the face measuring 6.5 feet. With the serene expression on the face of the image, its curled hair with graceful locks, its proportional anatomy, the monolith size, and the combination of its artistry and craftsmanship have led it to be called the mightiest achievement in sculptural art in medieval Karnataka.<ref name="arc1">Seshadri in Kamath (2001), p51</ref> It is the largest monolithic statue in the world.<ref name="keay">{{cite book

Other important contributions are the Jain basadis' whose towers have gradually receding stories (''talas'') ornamented with small models of temples. These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars (Jain saints). Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative [[Kirthimukha]] (demon faces) are used at the top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of [[Gomateshwara]] of 982 are the most important monuments at [[Shravanabelagola]].<ref name="arc6">Some historians claim the Chavundaraya basadi was built by Chavundaraya himself while others argue it was the work of his on Jinadevana (Gopal et al.  in Adiga 2006, p256). Another view holds that the original shrine was consecrated in the 11th century and built in memory of Chavundaraya (Settar in Adiga 2006, 256)</ref> Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative door jambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King [[Chandragupta Maurya]] are known to be his creation.<ref name="arc11">Adiga 2006, p269</ref> The ''Panchakuta basadi'' ( five towered temple) at [[Kambadahalli]] of 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of [[Indian architecture#Hindu architecture|Dravidian]] art.<ref name="arc7">{{cite web|title=An ancient site connected with Jainism |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006020313510400.htm&date=2006/02/03/&prd=th&|author=Khajane, Muralidhara|The Hindu|work=|accessdate=2006-02-03}}</ref> The wall niches here are surmounted by ''torana'' ([[Post and lintel|lintel]]) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (''gandharva'') and imaginary monsters ([[Yalli (motif)|''makara'']]) ridden by [[Yaksha|''Yaksas'']] (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.<ref name="arc10">Adiga 2006, p268</ref> 
 
The Gangas build many Hindu temples with impressive Dravidian [[Gopuram|gopuras]] containing stucco figures from the Hindu pantheon, decorated pierced screen windows which are featured in the ''mantapa'' (hall) along with  ''saptamatrika'' carvings (seven heavenly mothers).<ref name="arc4">Kamath (2001), p51</ref> Some well known examples are the Kapileswara temple at Manne, Kolaramma temple at Kolar and the Kallesvara temple at Aralaguppe. At Talakad they built the Maralesvara temple, the Arakesvara temple and the Patalesvara temple. Unlike the Jain temples where floral frieze decoration is common, Hindu temples were distinguished by friezes (slab of stone with decorative sculptures) illustrating episodes from the epics and [[purana]]s.<ref name="arc10"/> Another unique legacy of the Gangas are the  number of ''virgal'' (hero stones) they have left behind; memorials containing sculptural details of war scenes, Hindu deities, ''saptamatriaks'' and Jain tirthankars.<ref name="arc3"/>

The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit extensively as their language of administration. Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages. In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of Kings and benedictions tended to be in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language. <ref name="bil">Thapar 2003, pp393-394</ref> The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries. During the first phase (350-725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration and the fact that majority of the records from this phase were ''Brahmadeya'' grants (grants to Brahmin temples).<ref name="brahma">Adiga (2006), p110</ref> In the second phase (725-1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith.<ref name="dom">Adiga (2006), p10</ref><ref name="pat">Thapar 2003, p396</ref> Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate]] bilingual inscriptions dated 444.
