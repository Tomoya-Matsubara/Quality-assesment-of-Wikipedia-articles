[[Air Marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] '''Selwyn David Evans''' [[Order of Australia|AC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (born 3 June 1925) is a retired senior commander of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and a writer and consultant on defence matters. He served as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1982 until 1985. Since leaving the RAAF he has published two military treatises, ''A Fatal Rivalry: Australia's Defence at Risk'' and ''War: A Matter of Principles'', and completed an autobiography. 

Enlisting in the Air Force in 1943, Evans graduated from flying school as a [[Sergeant|sergeant pilot]], and was converting to [[Bristol Beaufort|Beaufort]] bombers when World War&nbsp;II ended. During 1948&ndash;49 he was a member of the Australian contingent operating [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakota]] transports in the [[Berlin Airlift]]. He was a [[flight instructor|instructor]] in the early 1950s, before becoming a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] captain with the [[Governor-General's Flight RAAF|Governor-General's Flight]] in 1954. His service in the flight earned him the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] in 1957. In the 1960s Evans was twice posted to [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Squadron]], flying [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] jet bombers: firstly as a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]] when the unit was based in [[Malaysia]] during 1960&ndash;62; and secondly as its commanding officer during the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967&ndash;68. The Canberras achieved a high degree of accuracy on their bombing missions under his leadership, and he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] after completing his tour in Vietnam.

Evans held senior staff positions in the early 1970s, before serving as Officer Commanding [[RAAF Base Amberley]] from 1975 until 1977. Promoted to [[air vice marshal]], he then became Chief of Air Force Operations. In this role he enhanced the RAAF's strategy for the defence of Australia, to fully exploit the "air-sea gap" on the northern approaches to the continent. Appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] in 1981, he was Chief of Joint Operations and Plans for the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) before his promotion to [[air marshal]] and elevation to Chief of the Air Staff in April 1982. As head of the Air Force he focussed on personal standards, air power doctrine, and improving defensive capabilties in northern Australia. He was raised to [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] in 1984. Retiring from the RAAF in May 1985, Evans began to write and lecture on defence matters, and also stood for election in Federal politics. From 1990 to 2009 he was a board member and defence advisor to [[BAE Systems Australia|British Aerospace Australia]] (later BAE Systems Australia), and Chairman of the [[National Capital Authority]] from 1997 until 2003. He was awarded the [[Centenary Medal]] in 2001 for his services to the ADF and the Canberra community.

Selwyn Evans, known by his middle name of David, was born in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] on 3&nbsp;June 1925. The son of Selwyn Douglas Evans and his wife Eileen, David was educated to Intermediate Certificate level at [[Marist College North Shore|Marist Brothers College]] in [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]].<ref name="Who's Who 2010">Singh, ''Who<U+2019>s Who in Australia 2010'', pp. 714&ndash;715</ref><ref name="High Fliers">Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 168&ndash;170</ref> He subsequently became one of the earliest recruits to the Air Training Corps, established in 1941 to facilitate basic training for youths aged 16 to 18 whose ultimate aim was to sign on as aircrew in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]].

Promoted to [[flight sergeant]], Evans was in the middle of a [[Bristol Beaufort]] light bomber conversion course at [[No. 1 Operational Training Unit RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Operational Training Unit]] in [[RAAF Base East Sale|East Sale]], Victoria, when the war ended on 14&nbsp;August 1945. His Air Force career should have finished then and there, as he was slated for demobilisation along with thousands of other wartime enlistees. Evans, however, was determined to remain and travelled to RAAF Headquarters in [[Melbourne]] to take his case to the officer responsible for discharges. He found a sympathetic ear and within days was transferred to [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;38 Squadron]], going on to fly [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakota]] transports on a regular courier service to Japan between October 1945 and May 1948.<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref name="Going Solo">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 9</ref>  During this period he was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]], becoming "the very last name in the 1947 ''Air Force List''".<ref name="High Fliers"/> On 23&nbsp;August 1948 he married Dorothy (Gail) Campbell, the daughter of a [[Merchant Navy]] [[Captain (naval)|captain]]; the couple had three daughters and a son.<ref name="Who's Who 2010"/> Promoted to [[flying officer]], Evans was posted the same month to [[RAAF Overseas Headquarters]] in London. From there he joined [[RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift]]<U+2014>which comprised crews from [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;36]] and 38 Squadrons and was based in [[Lubeck]], West Germany<U+2014>and flew over 250 [[sortie]]s in [[Royal Air Force]] Dakotas during the [[Berlin Airlift]].<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref name="BAE">[http://www.baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/autoGen_109323121955.html Retirement of Air Marshal David Evans] at [[BAE Systems Australia|BAE Systems]].

On one occasion, Evans and his crew discovered that boxes of [[condom]]s were their main cargo. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, "as they took off into a bleak, snow-filled night they found themselves questioning the worth of the sortie, an attitude which doubtless was not shared by the eventual recipients".<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.199&ndash;200</ref>    
 
Returning to Australia in November 1949, Evans was an [[Flight instructor|instructor]] until July 1953, his duties including an exchange posting with the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] from May 1951.

==Vietnam War and senior command==
[[File:Canberra B20 2 Sqn RAAF over Vietnam 1970.jpg|thumb|right|300px|No. 2 Squadron Canberra over Vietnam|alt=Side view of camouflaged twin-engined military jet in level flight]]
In April 1967, the Australian government committed No.&nbsp;2 Squadron and its Canberra bombers to action in the [[Vietnam War]]. Operating from [[Phan Rang Air Base]] outside [[Saigon]], under the direction of the US [[35th Fighter Wing|35th Tactical Fighter Wing]] (TFW), the Canberras were initially engaged in medium-altitude missions against [[Viet Cong]] forces, guided by Sky Spot ground radar, usually at night. Promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]], Evans assumed control of the squadron in December 1967. By this time the Canberras were flying a greater proportion of their missions at lower levels in daylight, using visual bomb-aiming methods honed during their earlier service in Malaysia; this gave the bombers an average [[circular error probability]] (CEP) of 50 metres. Evans introduced intensive post-mission analysis to refine their technique, and permitted his pilots to bomb at the lowest level possible at which the bombsight would operate.<ref name="RAAF">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 271&ndash;273</ref><ref name="RAAF in the War in Vietnam">Mordike, ''The RAAF in the War in Vietnam'', pp. 55&ndash;58</ref> The CEP was eventually reduced to 20 metres, making the Canberras the most accurate bombing force in the region.<ref name="RAAF"/><ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 195&ndash;196</ref> In January 1968, the unit participated in the air campaigns to defend [[Hu<U+1EBF>]] and [[Khe Sanh]] during the [[Tet Offensive]].<ref name="RAAF"/><ref name="RAAF in the War in Vietnam"/> Phan Rang itself was often subjected to harassing attacks and mortar fire from the Viet Cong, requiring Evans to undertake improvements to the airfield's ground defences.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', p. 231</ref> He completed his posting to Vietnam in November 1968 and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his performance as commander of No.&nbsp;2 Squadron.<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref>[http://www.vietnamroll.gov.au/VeteranDetails.aspx?VeteranId=1283609 Evans, Selwyn David] at [http://www.vietnamroll.gov.au/home.aspx Nominal Roll of Vietnam Veterans].

Evans completed studies at the [[Royal College of Defence Studies]], London, in 1972.  Returning to Australia, he served as Director-General Plans and Policy, Air Force, during 1973&ndash;74 and was Officer Commanding [[RAAF Base Amberley]] from February 1975 until April 1977.<ref name="Who's Who 2010" /><ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Units'', p. 123</ref> In the latter role he qualified as a pilot on the recently delivered [[General Dynamics F-111C]] swing-wing bomber, as well as the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopter.<ref name="Post-War Years"/> Promoted to [[air vice marshal]], Evans was Chief of Air Force Operations (CAFOPS) between 1977 and 1980; he also served temporarily as [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] in 1978.<ref name="AM"/><ref name="RAAF pp.278-279">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 278<U+2013>279</ref>  As CAFOPS, Evans played a major part in developing the RAAF<U+2019>s plans for the defence of Australia. Following America's announcement in the 1969 [[Guam Doctrine]] that its allies would have to assume greater self-reliance in their military affairs, Australia's strategic thought underwent a change from its earlier policy of "forward defence" to a more localised defensive posture. While the consensus among RAAF planning staff was to adopt a "repulsion" concept of repelling an enemy force on the air and sea approaches to northern Australia, Evans considered that this did not go far enough in exploiting the long-range offensive capabilities of such aircraft as the F-111. Convinced that Australia's numerically small forces would be hard-pressed to dislodge an invader that had gained a foothold on the continent, he refined the "repulsion" stance into what he termed an "anti-lodgement" strategy, focussing on defeating the enemy at its potential staging bases north of Australia and then, as a last resort, on the approaches closer to home. The Air Force<U+2019>s role in shaping an overall strategy that took advantage of the "air-sea gap" was later acknowledged in the Federal government paper ''The Defence of Australia 1987''.<ref name="RAAF pp.278-279"/> Evans was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] on [[Australia Day|26&nbsp;January 1981]] for his achievements as CAFOPS.<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=879867&search_type=quick&showInd=true Officer of the Order of Australia] at [http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/ It's an Honour]. Retrieved on 16 June 2011.</ref> 

In 1980, Evans was appointed Chief of Joint Operations and Plans for the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF).  He was promoted to [[air marshal]] and became [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS), the RAAF's senior position, on 20&nbsp;April 1982.<ref name="AM"/><ref>Stephens, ''Australia's Air Chiefs'' p. 43</ref> As CAS he took steps to enhance discipline, bearing and morale in the Air Force, demanding high personal standards.<ref name="RAAF p. 311">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 311</ref><ref>Stephens, ''Australia's Air Chiefs'' pp. 47&ndash;48</ref> He sponsored the development of an Australian air power doctrine, eventually published as the ''Air Power Manual'' under one of his successors, Air Marshal [[Ray Funnell]], in 1990.<ref>Stephens, ''Power With Attitude'', pp. 186&ndash;192</ref> As early as 1969, Evans had advocated permanently basing a squadron of fighter aircraft at [[RAAF Base Tindal|RAAF Tindal]], in the Northern Territory. Tindal was one of a series of forward air bases initiated by Air Marshal [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]] when he was CAS in 1959, but a defence committee decision prior to Evans becoming CAS had determined to locate the RAAF's northernmost fighter squadron at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. His chance remark in mid-1982 to the then-new Minister of Defence, [[Ian Sinclair]], regarding the suitability of Tindal over Darwin led to the former base being chosen as the home of [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;75 (Fighter) Squadron]]. Alan Stephens described the permanent manning of Tindal as having "formalised the shift to the strategy of defence-in-depth&mdash;of defending Australia by controlling its air-sea gap".<ref>Stephens, ''Australia's Air Chiefs'', pp. 52&ndash;53</ref><ref name="RAAF pp. 283, 299-300">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 283, 299&ndash;300</ref> Evans also directed the introduction of an airman aircrew scheme for [[maritime patrol]] aircraft. Previously all such crews had comprised commissioned officers, but under the new concept crew members such as [[flight engineer]]s and sensor operators would be [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]]; the scheme was later extended to the crews of transport aircraft and helicopters.<ref>Stephens, ''Australia's Air Chiefs'', pp. 45, 52</ref>  For his service as CAS, Evans was raised to a [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] on 11&nbsp;June 1984.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=879711&search_type=quick&showInd=true Companion of the Order of Australia] at It's an Honour.
