'''''Resident Evil 5''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|''Biohazard 5''|<U+30D0><U+30A4><U+30AA><U+30CF><U+30B6><U+30FC><U+30C9>5|Baiohaz<U+0101>do 5}}, is an [[action game|action]] video game developed and published by [[Capcom]]. The game is the fifth main instalment in the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] consoles in March 2009 and for [[Microsoft Windows]] in September. The plot of ''Resident Evil 5'' revolves around [[Chris Redfield]] and [[Sheva Alomar]]'s investigation of a terrorist threat in Kijuju, a fictional region in Africa. Chris soon finds he has to confront his past in the shape of old enemy [[Albert Wesker]].

The game was announced in 2005, the same year that its predecessor ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' was released. Several staff members from the original ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' worked on ''Resident Evil 5''. [[Motion capture]] was used to film the game's cutscenes, and ''Resident Evil 5'' was the first video game to use virtual camera technology. Its gameplay was kept similar to the previous installment, though the game's producer [[Jun Takeuchi]] said that some thematics from the original game were used. 

''Resident Evil 5'' received mostly positive critical reception, though it was frequently criticised for issues with its controls, and also received complaints of [[racism]]. It outsold its predecessor and became the best-selling single game of the franchise. A sequel to the game, ''[[Resident Evil 6]]'', was released in 2012.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Resi5gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The player controls [[Chris Redfield]] from an [[Virtual camera system|over the shoulder]] perspective. A second player may control [[Sheva Alomar]] at any point in the game.

''Resident Evil 5'' is an [[action game]] played from an [[Virtual camera system|over the shoulder]] perspective.<ref name=gsr/> Players can use several weapons, including handguns, shotguns, automatic rifles, sniper rifles and grenade launchers, and can also use melee attacks against enemies. Wounding an enemy with a firearm will often cause the enemy to stagger. If the player is in close range when this occurs, an icon will appear on the screen giving the option to perform a melee attack, such as an [[uppercut]] or somersault kick. Players can perform a quick 180 degree turn to evade enemies.<ref name="X-Play Review"/> Many of the game's cutscenes and boss-battles involve [[quick time event]]s.<ref name="IGN Review"/>

Like its predecessor ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', players cannot run and shoot at the same time, but have the ability to upgrade weapons using money and treasures found throughout the game, and heal themselves with herbs.<ref name="IGN Review"/> New features include some infected enemies using firearms and grenades,<ref name="X-Play Review"/> the ability to upgrade weapons at any time from the inventory screen (as opposed to having to locate a merchant) and the fact that weapons and items can only be equipped in the midst of gameplay (the game still runs real-time as the player manipulates the inventory).<ref name="IGN Review"/> Each player can now store nine items (unlike the previous games the size of items is irrelevant; a herb will take up one of the nine spaces, as will a grenade launcher) and four items can be assigned to the [[D-pad]].<ref name=gsr/>

''Resident Evil 5'' supports two-player [[co-operative gameplay]].<ref name="IGN Review"/> The first player controls [[Chris Redfield]], and a second player can control [[Sheva Alomar]]. If playing alone, Sheva is controlled by the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]]. After the game has been completed once, the option is given to control Sheva as the primary character.<ref name="IGN Review"/> Two player mode is available in either online or [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] with a local player. A second player joining a split-screen game already in progress will cause the game to reload the last checkpoint; a second player joining an online game will either have to wait until the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, in order to play.<ref name=gsr/> Split-screen mode presents the game in two windows with the same wide-screen proportions as one-player mode, rather than splitting the screen in two halfs. This results in the entire screen not being utilized.<ref name="X-Play Review"/> Players are separated at points during the gameplay. However, if one player has critical health, only their partner can resuscitate them. Players can trade items during gameplay, though weapons cannot be traded with online players.<ref name=gsr/>

A version of the Mercenaries [[minigame]], which debuted in ''Resident Evil 3'', is present in ''Resident Evil 5''.<ref name="shack">{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/52819/resident-evil-5-to-sport |title=Resident Evil 5 to Sport 2P Co-op, Cover System |last1=Faylor |first1=Chris |last2=Breckon |first2=Nick |date=22 May 2008 |work=[[Shacknews]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> At launch, the multiplayer mode in the minigame was offline only, but a launch day [[patch (computing)|patch]] gave the game online multiplayer modes as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/03/mercenaries-comes-to-resident-evil-5-brings-online-patch/ |title=Mercenaries Comes To Resident Evil 5 Brings Online Patch |last1=Kutcher |first1=Ben |date=10 March 2009 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> Mercenaries unlocks once the game's story mode has been completed.

==Plot==

Five years after the events of ''Resident Evil 4'', Chris Redfield, a former STARS member and now part of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), is dispatched to Kijuju, Africa to help his new partner Sheva Alomar apprehend Ricardo Irving before he can sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. Upon arriving, they discover the locals have been infected and taken over by parasites (the infected people are termed "Majini") and that the members of the BSAA's Alpha team have been killed. Chris and Sheva are rescued by BSAA's Delta team, whose membership includes Sheva's mentor [[List of Resident Evil characters#Josh Stone|Josh Stone]]. In the data provided by Josh, Chris sees a photograph of [[Jill Valentine]], his old partner, presumed dead after a confrontation with [[Albert Wesker]]. Chris, Sheva, and Delta team close in on Irving, but he manages to escape with the help of a hooded figure, leaving behind documents that lead Chris and Sheva to oil fields in the marshlands where Irving's deal is to occur. They soon discover this was a diversion created by Irving to allow the deal to take place. Chris and Sheva attempt to regroup with Delta team, but at the rendezvous, find the team slaughtered by a BOW; Sheva cannot find Josh among the bodies. Chris refuses to report to headquarters, revealing his determination to learn if Jill is still alive.

Continuing through the marshlands, they find Josh injured but safe, and with his help track down Irving's boat. Irving injects himself with a variant of the parasite, Las Plagas, and mutates into a colossal octopus-like beast. Chris and Sheva defeat him, and with his dying words he directs the pair to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of the flower used to create the Progenitor virus, which led to the creation of the T- and G-viruses, and has now been used to form a new, incredibly powerful strain called Uroboros. Chris and Sheva find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, had taken over a former Umbrella underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility are thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Chris discovers one of the capsules belongs to Jill, but when they search it, they find the capsule empty. As they leave they discover Tricell CEO, Excella Gionne, has been plotting with Wesker to unleash a number of missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe (it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to sort out a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule over them, creating his own new breed of humanity). Chris and Sheva pursue Excella, but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, later revealed to be Jill, enslaved by a mind-control device on her chest. Excella and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker while Chris and Sheva fight Jill, eventually subduing her and removing the device from her chest. After a brief reunion, Jill orders Chris to follow Wesker.

As Chris and Sheva make their way aboard the tanker, they come across Excella, who escapes, but drops a case of syringes. Sheva holds on to a number of them.  When Chris and Sheva arrive on the main deck of the tanker, Wesker, through the tanker's intercom, reveals he has betrayed and infected Excella with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster which Chris and Sheva eventually defeat. Jill radios in and informs Chris and Sheva that Wesker must regularly take precisely measured doses of a virus to maintain his superhuman strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would act as poison for him. Sheva then realizes the syringes she recovered from Excella are doses of that drug. Chris and Sheva follow Wesker to a bomber aboard the tanker loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus. Eventually, the two are able to subdue Wesker long enough to inject him with additional doses. Wesker attempts to escape on the bomber, but is followed by Chris and Sheva who disable the bomber, causing it to crash land in a volcano. An enraged Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros, and pursues Chris and Sheva through the volcano. Chris and Sheva fight and weaken Wesker to the point where he falls into the lava.  They are then rescued by a helicopter piloted by Jill and Josh. In his dying breaths, Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, but Chris and Sheva kill him with [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s,<ref name="weskerdeath">{{cite web|title=S DCC 09: Resident Evil's Wesker gone for good|url=http://ign.com/articles/2009/07/23/sdcc-09-resident-evils-wesker-gone-for-good |date=23 July 2009|accessdate=6 January 2015|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|work=[[IGN]]}}</ref> before he is able to do so.  In the final cutscene of the game, Chris ponders whether it is truly worth fighting. He looks at Sheva and Jill and decides that it is worth it in order to live in a world without fear.

==Development==
''Resident Evil 5'' was developed by [[Capcom]] and produced by [[Jun Takeuchi]], who had previously directed ''[[Onimusha]]'' and produced ''[[Lost Planet: Extreme Condition]]''. [[Keiji Inafune]], who served as promotional producer for ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' and executive producer for the [[PlayStation 2]] version of ''Resident Evil 4'', oversaw the project. In February 2007, members of Capcom's [[Clover Studio]] were also called upon to help develop the game. However, many developers from the studio instead went to work on the ''[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]]'', which debuted for the [[Wii]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/clover-vets-helping-on-resi-5-and-inafune-wii-title |title=Clover vets helping on Resi 5 and Inafune Wii title |last1=Bramwell |first1=Tom |date=20 February 2007 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/02/7141/ |title=Capcom reincorporates ex-Clover developers; victory assured |last1=Caron |first1=Frank |date=20 February 2007 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> Several staff members who also worked on the original ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' were involved in development.<ref name="GSFAM">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/takeuchi-talks-resident-evil-5/1100-6130166/ |title=Takeuchi talks Resident Evil 5 |date=2 August 2005 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The game's scenario was written by Haruo Murata and Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, based on a story idea by concept director Kenichi Ueda.<ref name="credits">{{cite video game|title=Biohazard 5 |developer=Capcom Co., Ltd. |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd. |date=5 March 2009 |platform=Xbox 360, PlayStation 3}}</ref> Takeuchi announced the game would utilize the same gameplay model introduced in ''Resident Evil 4'', while implementing thematics from the original ''Resident Evil''.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927203135/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3142140&did=1 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3142140&did=1 |title=Resident Evil 5 Xbox 360 Preview |last1=Lino |first1=Masa |date=20 July 2005 |work=[[1UP.com]] |archivedate=27 September 2007 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> Tsukasa Takenaka provided additional story background and created the in-game files.<ref name="credits" />

Takeuchi stated that about three years were spent on "actual development time" of the game, with an additional year prior to that spent on concept and planning. At its peak, about 110 people were working on the project. The decision for co-operative gameplay was made "part-way" through the development, in order to give an entirely new experience in a ''Resident Evil'' game.<ref name=joystiq/> While there were initial concerns that a second player would reduce the game's tension and horror, it was later realized that this could actually increase tension by presenting opportunities in which one player had to be rescued.<ref name=oneup/> Takeuchi also stated the decision to have split-screen mode present both screens in their original [[16:9]] ratio and was influenced by the desire to not have the player's screens right on top of each other, as this could be distracting, also stating the restriction on moving and shooting at the same time was retained to increase player tension due to the inability to move freely. Takeuchi cited the film ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and his experience working on ''Lost Planet: Extreme Condition'' as major influences for ''Resident Evil 5''.<ref name=joystiq>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/02/24/joystiq-interview-resident-evil-5-producer-jun-takeuchi/ |title=Joystiq interview: Resident Evil 5 producer Jun Takeuchi |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |date=24 February 2009 |work=[[Joystiq]] |access-date=18 February 2015}}</ref> 

While previous ''Resident Evil'' games are mainly set at night, the events of ''Resident Evil 5'' occur almost entirely during the day. In July 2008, director Yasuhiro Anpo stated that the daytime setting was due to the advanced graphics capabilities, which gave them greater options with lighting. Takeuchi stated the film ''[[28 Days Later]]'', which mainly took place in the daytime and in outdoor locations, served as inspiration for them by showing horror can be created without darkness.<ref name=oneup/> Alpo also stated that as ''Resident Evil 4'' was "a very long game" and uninteresting at points, they would try to make ''Resident Evil 5'' "a little shorter" and more exciting than its predecessor.<ref name=oneup>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121108224407/http://www.1up.com/previews/resident-evil-5_6?pager.offset=1 |url=http://www.1up.com/previews/resident-evil-5_6?pager.offset=1 |title=Resident Evil 5 Developer Interview |last=Mielke |first=James |date=11 July 2008 |work=[[1UP.com]] |access-date=18 February 2015 |archivedate=8 November 2012}}</ref> ''Resident Evil 5'' runs on version 1.4 of Capcom's internally developed [[MT Framework]] engine.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120814175818/http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2009/06/14/mt_framework/ |url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2009/06/14/mt_framework/ |title=Capcom Talks MT Framework 2.0 |author=Gantayat, Anoop |date=14 June 2010 |work=andriasang.com |archivedate=6 October 2012 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> [[Motion capture]] was used to record scenes in ''Resident Evil 5''.

Kota Suzuki served as the game's lead composer, with additional compositions provided by Hideki Okugawa, Akihiko Narita and Seiko Kobuchi.<ref name="credits" /> Suzuki stated that the daytime setting of ''Resident Evil 5'' did not change much in terms of the game's music score, though it did require them to have a better balance between the sound effects and what was happening on screen, due to more details being visible.<ref name=oneup/> His score was electronic, but includes 15 minutes of orchestral music that was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage at [[20th Century Fox]] Studios in [[Los Angeles]], with a 103-piece ensemble of the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]].

Capcom released a dedicated [[List of PlayStation Home Game Spaces|Game Space]] for the PlayStation 3's online community-based service, [[PlayStation Home]]. The space was called the ''Resident Evil 5 "Studio Lot"'' (or ''Biohazard 5 "Film Studio"'' for Japan) and was themed around the in-game opening location of Kijuju. The lounge offered ''Resident Evil 5''-related items, a variety of events, a full game launching support feature, and was the first Home space to offer an in-lounge shop. Some areas in the space were only available to users who own ''Resident Evil 5''. The space was released on 5 March 2009 on all regions of PlayStation Home.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090409032235/http://www.andriasang.com/e/articles/2009/02/03/sfiv_re5_home_collaborations/ |url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/articles/2009/02/03/sfiv_re5_home_collaborations/|title=Street Fighter IV and Resident Evil 5 collaborate with Home|work=andriasang.com|date=3 February 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archivedate=9 April 2009}}</ref> The space was retired in 2012.

During [[Sony]]'s press conference at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] 2009, Capcom announced that a special edition of the game, known as ''Biohazard 5: Alternative Edition'', would be released in Japan in Spring 2010 exclusively for the PlayStation 3.<ref name="New campaign">{{cite web |title=TGS 09: Resident Evil 5 Alternative Edition Revealed |url=http://ign.com/articles/2009/09/24/tgs-09-resident-evil-5-alternative-edition-revealed |work=Tokyo Game Show 2009 |work=[[IGN]] |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> This edition supports the [[PlayStation Move]] accessory and includes a new scenario titled "Lost in Nightmares", where protagonists Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine infiltrate one of [[List of Resident Evil characters#Oswell E.

The ''Gold Edition'' includes the "Lost in Nightmares" scenario and another campaign expansion episode, "Desperate Escape", where players control Josh Stone and Jill Valentine as they journey to assist Chris and Sheva.<ref name="'Desperate Escape' in Resident Evil 5: Alternate Edition [update]">{{cite web |first=Dale |last=North |title='Desperate Escape' in Resident Evil 5: Alternate Edition |url=http://www.destructoid.com/-desperate-escape-in-resident-evil-5-alternate-edition-155994.phtml |work=Destructoid|date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The edition also includes the previously released Versus mode, four new costumes, and an alternate Mercenaries mode with eight new playable characters, new items and maps.

Alternatively, for those who did not purchase the ''Gold Edition'', both episodes as well as both costume packs are available as DLC, with two of the eight new Mercenaries Reunion characters bundled with each downloadable item. This means that by buying all five sets of DLC, players own all of the content on the disc. However, this only applies to the PlayStation 3 version because the Xbox 360 version contains no DLC on the disc. The Xbox 360 version comes with a download token, allowing for a free download of all of the DLC while the PlayStation 3 version has all of the new content on disc.<ref name="Announcing Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition [update]">{{cite web |title=Announcing Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition|url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/snow_infernus/blog/2009/11/18/announcing_resident_evil_5_gold_edition |work=Capcom|date=18 November 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The disc was released in the United States on March 9, 2010, and in Europe on March 12.

===Critical response===
''Resident Evil 5'' has received generally positive reviews. It was frequently praised for its graphics and gameplay, but drew considerable criticism for issues with its controls. Corey Cohen of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' complimented the game's fast pace of action and called the graphics "gorgeous".<ref name="OXM Review">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110724230851/http://www.oxmonline.com/article/reviews/xbox-360/m-r/resident-evil-5 |url=http://www.oxmonline.com/article/reviews/xbox-360/m-r/resident-evil-5|title=Resident Evil 5 OXM|last=Cohen|first=Corey|work=[[Official Xbox Magazine]]|page=4|accessdate=6 January 2015 |archivedate=17 March 2011|date=13 March 2009}}</ref> The game was acclaimed by Joe Juba and Mark Miller of ''[[Game Informer]]'', who stated it had the best graphics of any game to date and that the music and voice acting helped make characters come alive. However Juba stated that the inability to move and shoot at the same time seemed "like a cheap and artificial way to increase difficulty than a technique to enhance tension."<ref name="GameInformer">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090316171041/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/09351DB2-7BD0-455D-A0A5-BDF0D27963EE.htm|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/09351DB2-7BD0-455D-A0A5-BDF0D27963EE.htm|title=Resident Evil 5: You Are Not Alone|accessdate=6 January 2015 |archivedate=16 March 2009 | author=Joe Juba & Mark Miller |date=April 2009 |work=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> Chris Hudak from [[Game Revolution]] also gave a favorable review. While lamenting the departure of the game from the [[survival horror]] genre, he concluded "the gorgeous environs, character models and overall visuals, and the adrenaline-soaked cooperative gameplay (wonky, stodgy Capcom controls and all) cannot be denied."<ref name=gamerev/>

Adam Sessler of ''[[X-Play]]'' said that while the game's graphics were exceptional, the single player artificial intelligence was hard to play through, and expressed disappointment for the controls he felt were taken from ''Resident Evil 4''.<ref name="X-Play Review">{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/32525/resident-evil-5/review/|title=Resident Evil 5 Review|last=Sessler|first=Adam | work=[[G4 (TV channel)|G4]]|page=1|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> [[Edge (magazine)|''Edge'']] also praised ''Resident Evil 5'''s gameplay as exhilarating and frantic though echoed the criticism of the control system.<ref name="Review: Resident Evil 5">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120527151857/http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/review-resident-evil-5 |url=http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/review-resident-evil-5 |title=Review: Resident Evil 5 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=13 March 2009 |archivedate=27 May 2012 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> Writing for [[IGN]], Ryan Geddes stated that the split-screen co-operative mode was very confusing but the game had a surprisingly high replay value.<ref name="IGN Review">{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2009/03/09/resident-evil-5-collectors-edition-review|title=Resident Evil 5 Review|last=Ryan|first=Geddes|date=6 March 2009|work=[[IGN]]|page=4|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> [[GameZone]]'s Louis Bedigian wrote: "The fact that ''Resident Evil 5'' was worth playing through twice in one weekend shows how compelling the gameplay is, and how it's able to rise above a number of disappointing flaws."<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100322220023/http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r27383.htm |url=http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r27383.htm |title=Resident Evil 5 Review |work=[[GameZone]] |date=13 March 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archivedate=22 March 2010}}</ref> While criticising the departure from survival horror and the inability to not only move and shoot but also move and knife fight, Brian Crecente from [[Kotaku]] concluded "From beginning to end, this latest ''Resident Evil'' delivers a riveting and intense experience well worth the time spent playing it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5168661/resident-evil-5-review-a-mutation-of-fun |title=Resident Evil 5 Review: A Mutation of Fun |last1=Crecente |first1=Brian |date=3 December 2009 |work=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=16 February 2015}}</ref>

James Mielke of [[1UP.com]] repeatedly compared ''Resident Evil 5'' to ''[[Gears of War 2]]''. He criticized several inconsistencies in the game, such as the enemies artificial intelligence, and the ability to interact with objects and use cover. Mielke was also critical of the controls, stating that aiming was too slow and noting the inability to strafe away from or quickly jump back from enemies. However he concluded that "despite the excruciating detail I've poured into describing the problems [''Resident Evil 5''] creates for itself, this is still a very fun game."<ref name="1UP review">{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090326040017/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3173233 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3173233 |title=Resident Evil 5 Review|work=1UP |work=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=6 January 2015 |archivedate=26 March 2009 |date=12 March 2008 |last=Mielke |first=James }}</ref> Kristan Reed of [[Eurogamer]] also criticized aspects of the controls, such as the speed at which 180 degree turns were performed and the difficulty accessing the  inventory system.

Steven Hopper of GameZone gave the "Lost in Nightmares" DLC a rating of 8 out of 10, stating that "even though the episode is pretty short, there is some good replay value here and the added multiplayer elements are a nice touch.

The dynamic between Jill and Josh isn't particularly thrilling, and the one-liners, banter and endearing kitsch are kept to a minimum."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2010/03/09/resident-evil-5-desperate-escape-review |title=Resident Evil 5: Desperate Escape Review |last=Claiborn |first=Samuel |date=9 March 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref> ''Resident Evil 5'' was nominated for "Best Action Game" at the 2009 IGN Game of the Year Awards.<ref name=igngoty/>

In Eurogamer's February 2009 preview of ''Resident Evil 5'', Dan Whitehead expressed concerns about the controversy the game may generate, stating that "it plays so blatantly into the old clich<U+00E9>s of the dangerous '[[wikt:Dark Continent|dark continent]]' and the primitive lust of its inhabitants that you'd swear the game was written in the 1920s" and "there are even more outrageous and outdated images to be found later in the game, stuff that I was honestly surprised to see in 2009." The article also states that the addition of the "light-skinned" Sheva "compounds the problem rather than easing it."<ref name="eurogamer">{{cite web | first=Dan | last=Whitehead | title=Resident Evil 5 | date=5 February 2009 | work=[[Eurogamer]] | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/resident-evil-5-hands-on-chapter1to3 | accessdate =6 January 2015}}</ref> Chris Hudak called the racism allegations "stupid", stating "If you are aware from the outset that the game takes place in Africa and yet you are still troubled by any skin-tone-related aspects ... there exists the possibility of simple, [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] retardation on your own part."<ref name=gamerev/>

Wesley Yin-Poole from [[VideoGamer.com]] stated that despite the amount of controversy the game was attracting due to racism, no expert opinion had yet been sought for comment. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in [[social anthropology]] at the [[University of Kent]], whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman said he thought the racism accusations were "silly". He stated that the game presented an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] theme, and added that people complaining about the game being racist could be considered a form of "inverted racism which says that you can't have scary people who are black."<ref name="kent">{{cite web |first=Wesley| last=Yin-Poole| title=EXCLUSIVE: Expert delivers verdict on Resi 5 racism row | date= 6 March 2009 | work=[[VideoGamer.com]]| url =http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/resident_evil_5/news/exclusive_expert_delivers_verdict_on_resi_5_racism_row.html | accessdate =6 January 2015}}</ref> It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed "black men" dragging off a screaming white woman;<ref name="kent"/><ref name="eurogamer" /> the scene was submitted for evaluation to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC).
