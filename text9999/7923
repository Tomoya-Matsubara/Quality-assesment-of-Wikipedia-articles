The {{nihongo|'''''Maya'' class'''|<U+6469><U+8036><U+578B><U+7832><U+8266>|Maya-gata h<U+014D>kan}} was a four-ship [[ship class|class]] of [[gunboat]]s of the early [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Jentsura  | first = Hansgeorg  | year = 1976 | title = Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945  | publisher = Naval Institute Press  | isbn = 0-87021-893-X }} page 115</ref>

==Design and description==
The ''Maya'' vessels were Japan<U+2019>s first iron-hulled gunboats, although only {{ship|Japanese gunboat|Maya||2}} and {{ship|Japanese gunboat|Ch<U+014D>kai||2}} had true iron hulls. {{ship|Japanese gunboat|Atago||2}} had a [[composite hull]] construction, whereas {{ship|Japanese gunboat|Akagi||2}} has a steel hull. All four vessels had auxiliary [[Schooner|schooner-rigged]] sails.
The ''Maya''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|47.0|m|ft|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.2|m|ft|1}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|2.95|m|ft|1}}. They displaced {{convert|614|LT|t|lk=in}} at normal load.<ref name= Conway>Chesneau, '' All the World<U+2019>s Fighting Ships'', p. 236.</ref> The crew numbered about 104 officers and enlisted men.<ref name= Conway/>

Propulsion was by a coal-fired horizontal double-expansion reciprocating [[steam engine]] with two cylindrical [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s driving a double screw. The engines were rated at {{convert|614|ihp|lk=in}}, and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|10.25|kn}}.<ref name= Conway/>

The ''Maya''-class ships were initially intended to be armed with one [[Krupp]] {{convert|210|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[Krupp]] L/22 breech-loading gun, and one Krupp {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/22 breech-loading gun, with two quadruple [[1-inch Nordenfelt gun]]s as secondary armament.<ref name= Conway/> However, each ship later modified to carry different armament in 1906.

Two of the three vessels (''Maya'' and ''Akagi'') were built by the private-contractor, [[Onohama Shipyards]] in [[Kobe]] (a predecessor of [[Hitachi Zosen Corporation]]), and one (''Ch<U+014D>kai'' ) was by built by the private-contractor [[IHI|Ishikawajima-Hirano Shipyards]]. ''Atago'' was built by the government<U+2019>s [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]]

All four ships served in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894-1895. In 1898, the ships were reclassified as second-class gunboats. ''Atago'' was lost in combat during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. ''Maya'' and ''Ch<U+014D>kai'' were removed from the [[navy list]] in 1908 and were subsequently broken up in 1913. ''Akagi'' was removed from the navy list in 1911,<ref name= Nishidah>Nishida, '' Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy''</ref>  but survived under civilian ownership until 1953.<ref name= Nishidah/>
