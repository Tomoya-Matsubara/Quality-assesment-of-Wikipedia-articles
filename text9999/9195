'''''The Eye of the World''''' (abbreviated as '''tEotW''' or '''EotW''' by fans) is the first book of ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' (WoT) [[fantasy]] series written by [[United States|American]] author [[Robert Jordan]]. It was published by [[Tor Books]] and released on January 15, 1990.  The unabridged audio book is read by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. Upon first publication, ''The Eye of the World'' consisted of one [[prologue]] and 53 [[chapter (books)|chapter]]s, with an additional prologue authored upon re-release.

On January 2, 2002, ''The Eye of the World'' was re-released as two separate books aimed at a [[young adult literature]] market, with larger text and a handful of illustrations. These were ''From the Two Rivers'' and ''To the Blight''. The former included an additional prologue entitled "Ravens", focusing on [[Egwene al'Vere]]. The [[American Library Association]] put ''The Eye of the World'' on its 2003 list of Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/yalsa/booklistsawards/popularpaperback/annotations/2003popularpaperbacks.cfm#flights|title=2003 Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref>

==Plot summary==
{{plot|date=April 2010}}
===Prologue: Dragonmount===
The prologue introduces [[Lews Therin Telamon]], victorious commander of the forces of Light in the war against [[Dark One|Shai'tan]]. As a result of the tainting of ''[[saidin]]'', the male half of the [[One Power]], Lews Therin has gone insane and murdered his kin. He is confronted by one of the [[Forsaken (Wheel of Time)|Forsaken]], who restores his sanity, allowing him to realize what he has done. Faced with the magnitude of his crimes, Lews Therin commits suicide by drawing deadly amounts of Saidin, thus creating [[Dragonmount]].

===From The Two Rivers to Shadar Logoth===
The early chapters of the book are set in and around the rustic village of [[Emond's Field]] in the [[Andor (Wheel of Time)#The Two Rivers|The Two Rivers]] district of [[Andor (Wheel of Time)|Andor]], where most of the primary characters reside.

On the eve of Bel Tine, an annual festival celebrating the arrival of spring, an unexpected attack by bestial [[Trolloc]]s and a fearsome [[Shadowspawn#Myrddraal|Myrddraal]] seems to target [[Rand al'Thor]] and his two friends, [[Matrim Cauthon]] and [[Perrin Aybara]] specifically. Hoping to spare their loved ones from any further attacks, the three young men decide to flee the village by night, accompanied by [[Moiraine Damodred]], an [[Aes Sedai]], and her [[Warder (Wheel of Time)|Warder]], [[al'Lan Mandragoran]]. As they attempt to leave, their surreptitious escape is discovered by the innkeeper's daughter, [[Egwene al'Vere]], and a wandering gleeman, [[Thom Merrilin]], who join them.<ref>Chp. 1 - Chp. 10</ref> 

Chased by Trollocs, Myrddraal, and [[Shadowspawn#Draghkar|Draghkar]], the seven companions make their way to the nearby city of Baerlon, where they encounter [[Min Farshaw]], a young woman gifted with the ability to see a person's past, and future, and [[Dain Bornhald]], an officer in the [[Children of the Light]]. They also find [[Padan Fain]], a peddler who was presumed killed during the Trolloc attack on Emond's Field. Also in Baerlon, Rand and his two friends begin experiencing dreams in which they are taunted by an arrogant man who calls himself [[Ba'alzamon]]. Shortly before they depart, [[Nynaeve al'Meara]], the village Wisdom of Emond's Field, arrives to retrieve the four villagers. When Rand and his friends refuse to return with her, Nynaeve joins them to ensure their continued safety.<ref>Chp. 11-17</ref>

[[Image:WoT01a FromTheTwoRivers.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of ''From the Two Rivers'']]
Pursued by ever-increasing numbers of Trollocs and Myrddraal, the travellers are forced to take refuge in the ancient, abandoned, and deadly city of [[Shadar Logoth]], a place even Myrddraal are reluctant to enter. While there, Rand and his two friends foolishly try to explore the ruined city and meet a man named [[Mashadar#Mordeth|Mordeth]], who first offers them riches in exchange for a small favor, then attempts to kill them when he learns that their companions include an Aes Sedai and that their eventual destination is [[Tar Valon]], the home city of the Aes Sedai order. The three barely escape, and only reach their companions just before nightfall.<ref>Chp. 18-19</ref>

===From Shadar Logoth to Caemlyn===
Myrddraal and Trollocs enter Shadar Logoth during the night, forcing the eight companions from their warded quarters. As they try to avoid the search and leave the city, [[Mashadar]], the evil of Shadar Logoth made manifest, separates them from each other.<ref>Chp. 20</ref>

Fleeing Shadar Logoth with Trollocs close behind, Rand, Mat, and Thom stumble across a moored ship on the nearby River Arinelle. The captain, [[Bayle Domon]], reluctantly grants them passage to Whitebridge. During the journey downriver, Ba'alzamon continues to haunt Rand's and Mat's dreams, and Mat becomes strangely reclusive and suspicious of strangers. Rand discovers that Mat took a ruby-hilted dagger from the piles of tainted treasure in Shadar Logoth despite Moiraine's warning about anything Mordeth gave them. Mat insists that because he took the dagger instead of Mordeth giving it to him, that it was safe. Rand agrees. 
<ref>Chp. 20, 24</ref>

In Whitebridge, the trio are confronted by a Myrddraal in a crowded square. Thom apparently sacrifices himself to buy Rand and Mat time to escape, and the two continue alone on the road toward [[Caemlyn]], earning meals and lodging along the way by playing Thom's [[flute]] and [[juggling]]. As they near Caemlyn, however, they begin to encounter Darkfriends in nearly every town who seem to be able to recognize them by sight, and Mat's [[Paranoia|paranoid]] behavior becomes more debilitating. 

[[Image:WoT01b ToTheBlight.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''To the Blight'']]
Once in Caemlyn, Mat confines himself to his bed and seeks to avoid all contact with outsiders while Rand makes the acquaintance of an [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Ogier|Ogier]] named [[Loial]] and embarks on an unlikely adventure. [[Logain Ablar]], a recently-captured [[False Dragon]], is being paraded through the streets of Caemlyn. While seeking to catch a glimpse of him, Rand climbs a wall and accidentally falls over the top into the palace garden, where he meets [[Elayne Trakand]], heir-apparent to the throne of Andor, her brother [[Gawyn Trakand|Gawyn]], and her half-brother [[Galad Damodred]].<ref>Chp. 35, 36, 39-40</ref>

When the palace guards are alerted to Rand's presence by Galad, he is taken into custody despite Elayne's protests and brought before [[Morgase Trakand|Queen Morgase]] and her Aes Sedai advisor, [[Elaida]]. Elaida prophetically identifies Rand as a dangerous individual, but Queen Morgase decides that she does not have sufficient evidence to imprison him.<ref>Chp. 40</ref>

Meanwhile, Egwene and Perrin plan a route that should take them from Shadar Logoth almost directly toward Caemlyn. Along the way, they meet [[Elyas Machera]], a man who can communicate with wolves. He tells Perrin that he, too, can develop this gift though Perrin shows little interest in this possibility. Elyas and the wolves decide to accompany the two youngsters at least part of the way to Caemlyn. They travel for a few days with the [[Tuatha'an]], a nomadic, pacifistic people, before striking out on their own when the wolves witness one of Perrin's dreams featuring Ba'alzamon.<ref>Chp. 22-23, 25, 27</ref>

After fleeing from massive swarms of ravens and crows sent to mark their movements and kill them, they run afoul of a legion of [[Children of the Light]] commanded by [[Geofram Bornhald]], father of the officer encountered in Baerlon. After witnessing the death of a wolf at the hands of a Whitecloak, Perrin, whose talent has developed despite his efforts, goes temporarily insane and kills two of them. Elyas escapes, but the Children of the Light hold Perrin and Egwene prisoner, planning to execute at least Perrin as soon as they reach Amador.<ref>Chp. 29-30</ref>

Moiraine, Lan, and Nynaeve rescue Egwene and Perrin from the Whitecloaks just as one overzealous individual is contemplating their premature 'release'. Together they travel to Caemlyn, where they are reunited with Mat and Rand, who has only just returned from his adventure at the castle. Moiraine immediately diagnoses Mat's "sickness" as the corrupting influence of the ruby-hilted dagger, and she uses her powers to diminish its effects, although she cannot heal him completely or break his attachment to it.<ref>Chp. 38, 41-42</ref>

===From Caemlyn to the Eye of the World===
Loial warns Moiraine of a threat to the Eye of the World, a threat independently corroborated by a story heard by Perrin and Egwene while among the Tuatha'an and by the dreams of Rand, Mat, and Perrin. Moiraine decides that in order to reach the Eye of the World in time to stop the Dark One, they must take the Ways (passageways built by male channelers in the time of madness for the Ogier to travel long distances in short amounts of time). The group is guided along the dangerous Ways (now tainted by evil) by Loial and emerge in [[Shienar]], where they meet Lord Agelmar Jagad and Ingtar Shinowa in the fortress of Fal Dara, on the eve of an expected battle against a Trolloc army.

Padan Fain is found climbing the walls of Fal Dara. He is taken into custody and interrogated by Moiraine and Lan, who discover that Fain is a Darkfriend whose mind has been specifically moulded to find the Dark One's quarry; it was he who aimed the attack on Emond's Field. Following that attack, he was forced into the Myrddraals' pursuit of the companions, only escaping them in Shadar Logoth.

Even separated from the Myrddraal, however, he was still the Dark One's bloodhound, and he followed the companions to Caemlyn, through the Ways, and to Fal Dara.<ref>Chp. 42-47</ref>

The group enters the [[Places_in_the_Wheel_of_Time_series#The_Blight|
Blight]] in search of the Eye of the World, guarded by [[Someshta]] (the fabled [[Green Man]]). The Eye is revealed as a pool of pure ''[[Saidin]]'', and when the companions exit they are confronted by the [[Forsaken (Wheel of Time)|Forsaken]] [[Aginor]] and [[Balthamel]]. Balthamel dies at the hand of the Green Man, and Aginor is consumed by the One Power as he battles Rand for control of the ''saidin'' at the Eye of the World. Guided by blind luck and instinctive knowledge, Rand uses the supply of ''saidin'' to decimate the Trolloc army and defeat [[Ba'alzamon]].<ref>Chp. 48-51</ref>

Afterwards, Rand realizes to his own horror that he channeled the One Power, and that he is condemned to a fate of insanity and rotting death. The book ends with Moiraine's ominous statement to herself that, "The [[Dragon (Wheel of Time)|Dragon]] is [[Dragon Reborn|Reborn]]." <ref>Chp. 52-53</ref>

===The Eye of the World===
The Eye of the World is in a hidden location in the [[Places_in_the_Wheel_of_Time_series#The_Blight|
Blight]] created by the male and female [[Aes Sedai]] after the [[Dark One]] tainted ''[[saidin]]''. It was created using both ''[[saidin]]'' and ''[[saidar]]'' (the male and female halves of the Power respectively), and is protected by [[Someshta]], who is known as "The Green Man" and is the last of the Nym. It houses a pool of pure, untainted ''[[saidin]]'', as well as one of the seven Seals on the Dark One's prison, [[Lews Therin Telamon|Lews Therin]]'s [[Dragon (Wheel of Time)|Dragon]] Banner and the [[Horn of Valere]]. Moiraine brings the party here to help discover which one of the three [[ta'veren]] can channel (thus discovering which one of them is the [[Dragon (Wheel of Time)|Dragon Reborn]]). It is during the battle with Aginor and Balthamel, two of the Forsaken, that Rand channels consciously for the first time. Balthamel is killed by Someshta, and Aginor is killed by drawing too much of the power.

==Themes and allusions==
Robert Jordan has stated that he consciously intended the early chapters of ''The Eye of the World'' to evoke the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] of [[Middle-earth]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Other strong allusions to ''The Lord of the Rings'' exist as well, particularly the incorporeal and invisible Dark Lord, the dark home realm of Mordor compared to Thakan'dar (as well as Shayol Ghul to the fiery pit of Mount Doom), obvious similarities between Trollocs and Orcs, Myrddraal and Nazg<U+00FB>l, Padan Fain and Gollum, Lan and Aragorn, Moiraine and Gandalf, Ogier and Ent.

''The Eye of the World'' is a [[coming of age]] (Bildungsroman) story, in which young people mature, experience new things, and accept greater responsibilities. Another theme prominent in the book is the nature of [[Trust (sociology)|trust]]; the people of the Two Rivers have to rely on Moiraine, but they fear she is only manipulating them and using them for her own ends.
