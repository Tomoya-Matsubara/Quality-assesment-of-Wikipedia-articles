'''Maurice Davin''' ([[1842]] - [[1927]]) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[farmer]] who became co-founder of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]]. He was also the first [[Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|President of the GAA]] and the only man ever to serve two terms as President.

He was born in [[Carrick-on-Suir]], [[County Tipperary]]. He became an extremely talented athlete and achieved international fame in the 1870s when he held numerous world records for [[running]], [[hurdling]], [[jumping]] and [[weight-throwing]].<ref name ="An_Caislean">{{cite web | title = Maurice Davin - Co-Founder of the G.A.A | author = | url = http://homepage.eircom.net/~ancaislean/carrick_people.html | publisher = | date = | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}</ref>. In fact at a time he was regarded as the best athlete in the world.<ref name="terrace_talk"/>

From [[1887]] he actively campaigned for a body to control [[Irish athletics]].<ref name ="Carrick-on-Suir">{{cite web | title = Maurice Davin | author = | url = http://www.carrickonsuir.ie/maurice%20davin/221/ | publisher = | date = | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}</ref> Athletics in Ireland at the time was controlled directly by an English association which excluded the masses from most competitions.<ref name ="terrace_talk">{{cite web | title =  A Short History of the GAA | author = Weeshie Fogarty | url = http://www.terracetalkireland.com/articles/gaa-history.htm | publisher = | date = | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}</ref>

Davin wrote "the laws under which athletic sports are held in Ireland were designed mainly for the guidance of Englishmen, and they do not deal at all with the characteristic sports and pastimes of the Irish race. Irish football is a great game" he wrote, "but there are no rules for either hurling or football and they are often dangerous."<ref name="terrace_talk"/>

Together with [[Michael Cusack]], of Carron on the eastern fringe of [[The Burren]], [[County Clare]] he called a meeting in Hayes<U+2019>s Commercial Hotel, [[Thurles]], [[County Tipperary]], on [[1 November]] [[1884]], and founded the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA). In that meeting they established ""a Gaelic athletic association for the preservation
and cultivation of national pastimes".<ref name="terrace_talk"/> As far as we know, only six others attended the historic meeting.

Davin was elected President and Cusack became its first secretary. John Wyse Power and John McKay were also elected secretaries. Later, [[Thomas William Croke]], [[Archbishop of Cashel and Emly]], [[Michael Davitt]] and [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] became patrons. The following year standardised rules were set for hurling, football, weight throwing, jumping, running, walking and cycling. S<U+00E9>amus <U+00D3> Riain described Davin as "the rock on which the Association survived turbulent waves".<ref>{{cite book |last= <U+00D3> Riain|first= S<U+00E9>amus|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Maurice Davin, (1842-1927): First President of the GAA|origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= 17|accessyear= 2007|accessmonth= July|edition= |publisher= Geography Publications|location= |language= |isbn= 0 906602 25 4|pages= |chapter= |quote= "the rock on which the Association survived turbulent waves"}}</ref>

Many top games including the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 1904|1904 All-Ireland Hurling Championship]] final between [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] and [[Cork GAA|Cork]] were played on Davin's farm.<ref name ="Carrick-on-Suir"/>

The Davin Stand in [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]] is named in his honour as are some GAA clubs throughout the country.
