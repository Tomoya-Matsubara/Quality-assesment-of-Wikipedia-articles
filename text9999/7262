The '''Philippine Frogmouth''' ''Batrachostomus septimus'' is a [[nocturnal]] bird that is found throughout the [[Philippine archipelago]].  It is common in lowland forests and maturing second growth. Little information is known about the bird since it is active only at night and does not make any calls or songs. It feeds on [[grasshopper]]s, [[cicada]]s, [[cricket]]s and [[beetle]]s. 

==Reproduction==
The nest is built from a horizontal branch that is placed two to five meters above ground. It is made from the parent's own downy feathers which is held in place using spider silk, moss and lichens. The female lays one egg per season. The male incubates the egg during the day and the female at night.
