'''Sylvester Stallone''' (born [[July 6]], [[1946]]) is an [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[film director|director]], [[film producer|producer]] and [[screenwriter]]. He achieved his greatest successes in a number of [[action film]]s, notably the ''[[Rocky]]'' and ''[[Rambo]]'' series. He is often referred to by his [[nickname]], "'''Sly'''".

==Biography==
===Early life===
Stallone was born in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], [[New York]] to Frank Stallone and [[Jackie Stallone|Jacqueline "Jackie" Labofish]], an [[astrologer]]. Stallone's father was an immigrant from [[Castellammare del Golfo]], [[Sicily]] while his mother is American. One of his maternal great-grandmothers, Rosa Rabinovich, was from [[Odessa]],[[Ukraine]]. <ref name="stallone1">{{cite news | last =| first =| coauthors=| title =Incredible: Is It Stallone or Rabinovich?| pages=| publisher =Pravda| date =[[2002-09-30]] | url =http://english.pravda.ru/fun/2002/09/30/37488_.html| accessdate =2006-11-23 }}</ref>At fifteen, his classmates voted him the one "most likely to end up in the electric chair." In the [[1960s]], Stallone attended the ''American College of Switzerland'', [[Leysin]] and the [[University of Miami]] for three years. He came within a few credit hours of graduation, before he decided to drop out and pursue an acting career. After Stallone's request that his acting and life experiences be accepted in exchange for his remaining credits, he was granted a [[Bachelors of Fine Arts]] (BFA) degree by the President of the University of Miami in 1999.<ref>[http://www6.miami.edu/alumni/umaa/notable.htm]</ref>

===Early film roles===
Stallone's career began with the leading role, Stud, in a [[Hardcore pornography|hard-core pornographic]] film called ''[[Party at Kitty and Stud's]]''. The film was originally hard core and depicted [[Sexually explicit material|sexual acts]], but after Stallone's later success, the film was re-cut to [[softcore|soft-core]] and re-packaged as ''Italian Stallion'' (a reference to [[Rocky Balboa (character)|Rocky Balboa]]'s nickname).

Stallone's first few film roles were minor, and included brief uncredited appearances in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]) as a subway thug, in the psychological thriller ''[[Klute]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]) as an extra dancing in a club, and in the [[Jack Lemmon]] vehicle ''Prisoner of 2nd Avenue'' ([[1975 in film|1975]]) as a youth. In the Lemmon film, Jack Lemmon chases and tackles Stallone, thinking he is a pickpocket. He had his first starring role in the cult hit ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]'' (1974).  In [[1975 in film|1975]] he appeared in supporting roles in ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'', ''[[Capone]]'', and another cult hit ''[[Death Race 2000]]''. He also made guest appearances on [[Television program|TV series]] such as ''[[Police Story]]'' and ''[[Kojak]]''.

===Success with ''Rocky''===
[[image:Fama-hollywood.jpg|thumb|Sylvester Stallone: footprints and hands stamped at [[Hollywood]] walkthrough]]
Stallone did not gain world-wide fame until his starring role in the smash hit ''[[Rocky]]'' ([[1976 in film|1976]]), the film was awarded the 1976 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. On [[March 24]], [[1975 in sports#Boxing|1975]], Stallone saw the [[Muhammad Ali|Ali]]-[[Chuck Wepner]] fight which inspired the foundation idea of ''Rocky''. That night Stallone went home, and in three days he had written the script for ''Rocky''. After that, he tried to sell the script with the intention of playing the lead role. [[Robert Chartoff]] and [[Irwin Winkler]] in particular liked the script (which was suggested by Stallone after a casting), and planned on courting a star like [[Burt Reynolds]] or [[James Caan]] for the lead role. 

The final result was an unequalled success; ''Rocky'' was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards]] in all, including two for Stallone himself, for [[Best Actor]] and for [[Best Original Screenplay]]. In addition to winning Best Picture, ''Rocky'' won for [[Best Director]] and [[Best Film Editing]]. ''Rocky'' cost about US[[United States dollar|$]]1.1 million to make, and grossed about US$225 million worldwide. The sequel ''[[Rocky II]]'' was released in 1979 and also became a major success, grossing US$200 million worldwide. The ''Rocky'' series has made the [[Rocky Steps|steps]] of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] a Philadelphia tourist attraction.

On the list of the top heroes of all time by [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) in [[2003]], Stallone is listed seventh as [[Rocky Balboa (character)|Rocky Balboa]] behind [[Gregory Peck]] ([[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|Atticus Finch]]), [[Harrison Ford]] ([[Indiana Jones]]), [[Sean Connery]] ([[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]), [[Humphrey Bogart]] ([[Rick Blaine]]), [[Gary Cooper]] ([[Will Kane]]) and [[Jodie Foster]] ([[Clarice Starling]]).

===Rambo & the 80s ===
[[Image:Sylvester Stallone (1983).jpg|right|thumb|Stallone in 1983.]]
Stallone had another major franchise success as [[Rambo|John Rambo]] in ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982) and the sequels, ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), and ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988). He also continued his success with the ''Rocky'' franchise and wrote, directed and starred in two more sequels to the series ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982) and ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985). Many considered him the most famous film star of the 80s and one of the most popular celebrities of the decade. 1986's ''[[Cobra (film)|Cobra]]'' and 1989's ''[[Tango and Cash]]'' continued the hit parade, further solidifying Stallone's overseas fanbase.

===1990s===
At the start of the new decade, Stallone starred in the fifth installment of the Rocky franchise ''[[Rocky V]]'' which was considered a box office disappointment and was also disliked by fans as a unworthy entry in the series. It was intended to have been the last installment in the franchise at the time.

After starring in the critical and commercial failures ''[[Oscar (film)|Oscar]]'' (1991) and ''[[Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'' (1992) during the early 90s, he made a major comeback in 1993 with the blockbuster hit ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'' which became an enormously successful film grossing over US$255 million worldwide. Later that year he enjoyed another hit with ''[[Demolition Man]]'' which grossed in excess of $158 million worldwide. His string of hits continued with [[1994 in film|1994]]'s ''[[The Specialist]]'' (over $170 million worldwide gross). In [[1995]] he played the title character in ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' which was based on the comic book [[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]. His overseas box office appeal even saved the domestic box office disappointment of ''Judge Dredd'' with a worldwide tally of $113 million. In [[1996]] he starred in the disaster movie ''[[Daylight (film)|Daylight]]'' which made only $33 million in the U.S but was a major hit overseas taking in over $126 million, totaling $159,212,469 worldwide.

Following his breakthrough performance in ''Rocky'', critic [[Roger Ebert]] had once said he could become the next [[Marlon Brando]] - however arguably Stallone had never recaptured the critical acclaim he won in ''Rocky''. Stallone did however receive acclaim for his role in ''[[Cop Land]]'' (1997) in which he starred alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Ray Liotta]], but the film was only a minor success at the box office. In 1998 he did [[voice-over]] work for the [[computer-animated]] film ''[[Antz]]''.

===2000s===
As the New Millenium began, Stallone's career went into decline after he starred in a string of critical and commercial failures such as ''[[Get Carter (2000 film)|Get Carter]]'' (2000) ''[[Driven]]'' (2001) and ''[[D-Tox]]'' (2002). In [[2003]] he played a villainous role in the third installment of the [[Spy Kids]] trilogy ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'' which was a box office success but Stallone's performance as the villain was critically panned. He was also attached to star and direct a film about the murder of rappers [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Biggie Smalls]] titled ''Notorious'' but the film has yet to be made.

===Current status===
After three years since he last appeared in a film, he made a comeback in 2006 with the sixth and final installment of the Rocky series, ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'', which was a critical and commercial hit. After the critical and box office failure of the previous and presemably last installment ''[[Rocky V]]'', Stallone decided that he should end the series with a sixth installment which would be a much more worthy end to the franchise. The total box office gross looks to end with a final domestic gross of $69 million, thus nearly tripling its production budget. His performance in ''Rocky Balboa'' has been praised and garnered mostly positive reviews. <ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rocky_balboa/ Rocky Balboa at RottenTomatoes]</ref>

Stallone is currently in production on the latest Rambo sequel ''[[John Rambo (film)|John Rambo]]''. It has been receiving a positive reaction due to favorable script reviews on the internet.

It was also recently announced that Sylvester Stallone would be directing a movie on ''[[The Forty Days of Musa Dagh]]'', based on the book written by [[Franz Werfel]]. <ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/movies/ci_4841925]</ref> <ref>[http://www.yerkir.am/eng/index.php?sub=news_arm&id=28391]</ref>

==Director==
Stallone's debut as a director came in 1978 with ''[[Paradise Alley]]'', which he also wrote and starred in. In addition, he directed ''[[Staying Alive]]'' (the sequel to ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''), along with ''[[Rocky II]]'', ''[[Rocky III|III]]'', ''[[Rocky IV|IV]]'' and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''.

==Writer==
In addition to writing all six ''[[Rocky]]'' films, Stallone also wrote ''[[Cobra (film)|Cobra]]'', ''[[Driven]]'', and the last ''Rambo'' film, ''[[John Rambo (film)|John Rambo]]''. He has co-written several other films, such as ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'', ''[[Over the Top]]'' and the first three ''[[Rambo]]'' films. His last major success as a co-writer came with 1993's ''[[Cliffhanger (movie)|Cliffhanger]]''.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Stallone's family include his brother, former actor/singer [[Frank Stallone]], his mother, [[Jackie Stallone|Jacqueline Stallone]], who achieved notoriety in the middle 1990s as an [[Astrology|astrologer]] and his son, [[Sage Stallone]], who played Rocky's son in [[1990 in film|1990]]'s ''[[Rocky V]]'' and appeared in his [[1996 in film|1996]] movie, ''[[Daylight (film)|Daylight]]''. At the time of ownership, Stallone's pet Bullmastiff, Butkus Stallone, appeared in the first Rocky film as an often-teased favorite pet of Balboa's who lived in Adrian's pet shop.

===Marriages===
Stallone has been married three times, to Sasha Czack (1974<U+2013>1985), [[Brigitte Nielsen]] (1985<U+2013>1987), and [[Jennifer Flavin]] (1997<U+2013>present). He has five children, sons [[Sage Stallone|Sage Moonblood]] and Seargeoh, who is [[autism|autistic]] (with Czack, born 1976 and 1979 respectively), and daughters Sophia Rose, Sistine Rose and Scarlett Rose (with Flavin, born 1996, 1998, 2002 respectively). He and Flavin, an Irish-American, were married at [[Winston Churchill]]'s birthplace, [[Blenheim Palace]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]]. 

In addition to these marriages, he has had romantic relationships with models [[Susan Anton]], [[Angie Everhart]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Janice Dickinson]]. Dickinson once believed that Stallone was the father of her daughter Savannah. <ref>[http://icqurimage.com/Magazine/courtesan.html]</ref>

==Planet Hollywood==
He owns shares in [[Planet Hollywood]] restaurants with [[Bruce Willis]] and formerly [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (who has since sold his part).

==Trivia==
{{toomuchtrivia}}
* His trademark sneer and slurred speech are the result of [[paralysis]] in the left side of his face caused by birth complications.<ref>{{cite web| author=The Biography Channel| title=Sylvester Stallone Biography| year=2007| url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/273:820/1/Sylvester_Stallone.htm| accessdate=February 1| accessyear=2007}}</ref>
* Turned down lead roles in blockbuster hits ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'', 48 Hours, Seven, Pretty Woman, Frequency, ''[[Die Hard]]'', ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (role of Butch Coolidge that later went to Bruce Willis), ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'' (Max Cherry role that later went to Robert Forster), ''[[The Negotiator (film)|The Negotiator]]'' (later went to Samuel L. Jackson), and ''[[Enemy of the State]]''. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
* Was developing an action adventure film called ''Gale Force'' in 1990 with Renny Harlin about pirates attacking a coastal town in the middle of a windstorm. The project was cancelled due to budget concerns. Plans for a team up comedy with John Candy titled ''Bartholomew and Neff'' also fell through. Stallone was also developing a hollywood remake of the hong kong action hit ''The Killer'' in 1993 which also was shelved. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
* The 1997 film ''[[Face/Off]]'' starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta was originally conceived as a sci-fi film and written specifically for Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
* Unmade film projects include sci-fi scripts ''Fatalis'' (pre-historic animals loose in a futuristic LA) and ''Hunter'' (A tracker and a special forces team are unleashed into the wilderness to track down a bloodythirsty genetically enhanced pre-historic monster) which were part of his 60 million dollar 3 film deal with Universal that was scrapped upon the domestic failure of 1996's ''Daylight''. He was originally set to star in the sci-fi film ''Isobar'' with Kim Basinger and Joel Silver producing in 1990. It fell through when Dean Devlin quit the project over script issues with Carolco. The film revolved around a futuristic supersonic train traveling between LA and Tokyo in a post-apocalyptic world. During the trip, a genetic mutant unleashes horror upon the passengers of the train in a claustrophobic nightmarish fashion. The movie has been revived and is set to release in 2007 with a new cast.
* ''Cobra'' and ''Judge Dredd'' were intended to spawn franchises, but due to their lukewarm reception at the boxoffice, those plans were cancelled. ''Cliffhanger'' had a sequel script written for it entitled ''The Dam'' but this was later retooled as a separate film entitled ''Daylight'' which Stallone made in 1996.
* Sustained serious injuries making the Rambo films, particularly ''First Blood''. In that film, he attempts to jump from a cliff into a tree. The look of pain he shows in the film is in fact real as the branches were lodged in his chest, breaking ribs and puncturing a lung.
* Does most of his own stunts including much of the dangerous stuntwork in the Rambo films and ''Cliffhanger''. He overcame serious agoraphobia to make ''Cliffhanger''. His willingness to go to extreme lengths to make the stuntwork in his films as authentic as possible is matched only by another action movie legend, Jackie Chan. 
* Is good friends with Planet Hollywood pals Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Don Johnson.
* Widely considered to have inspired the one-man army action films of the 1980s with the genre classic ''First Blood''.
* Stallone claims to have been able to [[bench press]] 385-400 lbs and [[squat]] 500 lbs in his prime. While in a bench pressing contest with former [[Mr. Olympia]] [[Franco Columbu]], he severely tore his pectoral muscle and needed over 160 stitches on it. This is why one half of his chest is more veiny than the other. <ref>http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30861</ref>
* With the monetary success of the ''Rocky'' films, Stallone gave professional wrestler [[Hulk Hogan]] his first mainstream exposure, personally offering him the role as the character Thunderlips in [[1982 in film|1982]]'s ''[[Rocky III]]''. Stallone inducted Hogan into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2005.
* He and ''The Contender'' co-host [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] were pallbearers at the funeral of [[Najai Turpin]], a former contestant on the show.
* According to [[NNDB|NNDB.com]], "Stallone has always been politically active, but his politics defy easy labels. He has written checks for candidates as far to the left as [[Jerry Brown]] and [[Barbara Boxer]], and as far right as [[John Ashcroft]] and [[Rick Santorum]]."[http://www.nndb.com/people/761/000023692/]. However, he has openly been known to identify himself as a Republican. In his book "Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations," [[Al Franken]] cited Stallone as one of the biggest Republican supporters in Hollywood.
* He is one of President [[George W. Bush]]'s two favorite actors. The other is fellow action hero and conservative [[Chuck Norris]]. Both men attended Bush's inauguration as President in 2001. 
*Stallone and President Bush share the same birthday.
* Stallone supported President [[Bill Clinton]] during his [[Impeachment Hearing of Bill Clinton|impeachment trial]] and hosted a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] fundraiser at his Miami home on [[9 July]] [[1998]].
* A long-time [[American football]] fan and supporter of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], Stallone used his Rocky persona to introduce ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]; set in a gymnasium, he pounded a punch ball, glared at the camera with clenched fist and uttered the signature tagline "Are ya ready for some football?".
* On [[January 14]], 2007, Stallone was at [[Goodison Park]] to promote ''Rocky Balboa'', and to watch Everton take on Reading. The match ended as a 1-1 draw. After receiving a brilliant reception from over 30,000 fans he now claims to be an official Everton fan.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6236759.stm | title = Everton 1-1 Reading| accessdate = 2007-01-14| date = [[2007-01-14]]| work = Nathan Mercer }}</ref>
* Stallone's films have grossed over $1.7 billion in the USA and over $3.5 billion worldwide.
* Attended a private school in the [[Romandy]] ([[Switzerland]]). Stallone was not a very good student but he took part in the play [[Death of a Salesman]] which made him want to become an actor.
* Stallone and his entourage of five was delayed from leaving [[Sydney Airport]] by Australian Customs Officials on [[February 16]], 2007 for bringing prohibited items into [[Australia]]. Stallone had arrived in Australia for the premiere of ''Rocky Balboa''<ref>{{cite web| author=Belinda Tasker, NEWS.com.au| title=Stallone's trip off to rocky start| year=2007| url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,21242452-29277,00.htm| accessdate=February 17| accessyear=2007}}</ref>.
