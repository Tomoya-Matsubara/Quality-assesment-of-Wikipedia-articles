'''Harold Tommy Amaker''' (born June 6, 1965) is an American [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[college basketball]] coach and the current [[head coach]] of the [[Harvard University]] men's [[basketball]] team. He has also coached for the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Seton Hall University]]. He played [[point guard]] and later served as an assistant coach at [[Duke University]] under [[Mike Krzyzewski]].  An [[All-American]] player, Amaker set numerous records and earned many honors and awards.  He took Seton Hall to the post season in each of his four seasons as their coach, helped Michigan win the [[National Invitation Tournament]] the year after a probationary ban from postseason play, and had the three highest single-season win totals in the history of Harvard basketball, the school's first three [[Ivy League]] championships and first NCAA tournament victory.

Amaker was a [[high school basketball]] [[McDonald's All-American]] and a [[Parade All-American]]. As a college basketball player, he set most of the [[assist (basketball)|assists]] records and many [[steal (basketball)|steals]] records for [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke basketball]].  He also set the  [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] single-season games played and games started records.  Among his numerous accolades, he was the first winner of the [[NABC Defensive Player of the Year]], and he was a third team All-American.

Amaker was an assistant coach for the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball under Krzyzewski for nine seasons.  His first four seasons were part of a five-year streak of final four appearances by Duke (including back-to-back national championships). As a head coach, Amaker took the [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]] to postseason tournaments ([[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] <U+2013> [[2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2000]] and National Invitation Tournament <U+2013> [[1998 National Invitation Tournament|1998]], [[1999 National Invitation Tournament|1999]], and [[2001 National Invitation Tournament|2001]]) in each of his four seasons as their coach. He dealt with the turmoil and self-imposed sanctions of the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]] in his first years with [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]], where he eventually won the [[2004 National Invitation Tournament]] with the [[2003<U+2013>04 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team]] and finished as the runner-up with Michigan in the [[2006 National Invitation Tournament]].

In his tenure as [[Harvard Crimson|Harvard]] men's basketball coach, Amaker was the first coach to lead the Crimson to victory over a ranked opponent with the {{cbb link|2008|sex=men|team=Harvard Crimson|school=Harvard University|title=2008<U+2013>09 team}}.  He also coached the [[2009<U+2013>10 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team]] into the postseason ([[2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament]]) in his third year there, which included the highest single-season victory total (21) in school history. In the summer of 2010, the NCAA ruled that Amaker had committed a recruiting violation, resulting in NCAA-mandated recruiting restrictions, the university's first NCAA penalty of the men's basketball program. The [[2010<U+2013>11 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2010<U+2013>11 team]] became the first Harvard men's basketball team to clinch a share of the Ivy League championship and surpassed the prior season win total (23).  The [[2011<U+2013>12 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2011<U+2013>12 team]] became the first in school history to appear in the [[AP Poll|Associated Press]] (AP) and [[Coaches Poll]]s and, for the third year in a row, established a new school record for wins (26). Amaker's 2011<U+2013>12 and [[2012<U+2013>13 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|2012<U+2013>13 teams]] repeated as Ivy League champions. The 2012<U+2013>13 team gave Harvard its first NCAA tournament victory, over the University of New Mexico.

==Early years==
Amaker was born in {{USCity|Falls Church|Virginia}}, in 1965. He was raised by a single mother, Alma Amaker, a high school English teacher.   Although not a part of Amaker's young life, his father was attending some of Amaker's basketball games by the time he was in high school.<ref name=A06p/>

Amaker resided in Falls Church, but he attended [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School|W.T. Woodson High School]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], Virginia, because his mother was a teacher in [[Fairfax County Public Schools|Fairfax County]]. Her job allowed her to choose among the county schools, her choice made because the school's basketball coach, Red Jenkins, who called Amaker "T-bird",<ref name=A06p/> had been impressed with his performances at his youth summer league since Amaker was 10 years old.<ref name=TAWB83>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20111218015235/http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/article.asp?article=262609&paper=63&cat=105|archivedate=2011-12-18|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/article.asp?article=262609&paper=63&cat=105|title=#8, Tommy Amaker, Woodson Basketball, 1983: It was mind over body for the former Woodson basketball standout, as his career took him to the top of college basketball as a player and a coach|accessdate=2010-04-04|date=2006-08-16|work=Fairfax Connection|author=Kurspahic, Mirza}}</ref> He began playing varsity for Woodson by December,<ref name=TAWB83/> making him the first freshman to play varsity in the school's history.<ref name=9-10DMG>{{cite web|url=http://www.goduke.com/fls/4200/web-docs/2009-10_Duke_MBB_Media_Guide.pdf?SPSID=22748&SPID=1845&DB_OEM_ID=4200|accessdate=2010-04-01|title=2009<U+2013>10 Duke Media Guide|publisher=Duke University|pages=30 & 32}}</ref> His mother, whom Jenkins called "his first coach and his best coach", attended his practices and graded papers in the coach's office.<ref name=A06p/>

Duke University basketball [[head coach]] [[Mike Krzyzewski]], who had just completed his [[1980<U+2013>81 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|first season]] as Duke coach, was in town to evaluate [[Johnny Dawkins]] in a 1981 Washington DC summer league game, but was convinced to stay for a second game to see Amaker play. Krzyzewski met Amaker's mother and said, "Mrs. Amaker, your son is going to look great in Duke blue."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-25/sports/sp-5873_1_tommy-amaker|title=Duke's Amaker Has the Look of a Winner : As Blue Devils' Only Returning Starter, He Is Key to Team's Success|accessdate=2013-03-19|date=1987-01-25|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Feinstein, John}}</ref>  At the time, Amaker had wanted to play for the [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland Terrapins]] because his sister Tami went to [[University of Maryland, College Park]] and Amaker idolized Maryland star guard [[John Lucas II|John Lucas]].<ref name=A06p/>  He was recruited eventually to Duke by assistant coach [[Chuck Swenson]], who would later become an assistant coach during Amaker's first five seasons at Michigan from 2001 to 2006.<ref name=A06p/>

Amaker played on the 1983 [[McDonald's All-American Team]] and was also named to the [[Parade All-American]] team.<ref name=9-10DMG/> According to the ''Fairfax Connection'', the county changed the rules regarding where teachers could send their children due to Amaker's success at Woodson.<ref name=TAWB83/>

==College career==
Amaker was a star point guard at Duke after becoming a freshman [[starting lineup|starter]] for head coach Krzyzewski.  He led the team in assists three years and in steals four seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goduke.com/fls/4200/web-docs/2009-10_Duke_MBB_Media_Guide.pdf?SPSID=22748&SPID=1845&DB_OEM_ID=4200|accessdate=2010-04-01|title=2009<U+2013>10 Duke Media Guide|publisher=[[Duke University]]|pages=175<U+2013>6}}</ref>  While at Duke his roommate for away games was [[Mike Brey]].<ref name=A06p/>  

===Freshman and sophomore years===
Dawkins played point guard for the {{cbb link|1982|sex=men|team=Duke Blue Devils|school=Duke University|title=1982<U+2013>83 Blue Devils}}, but moved to [[shooting guard]] the following year to make way for Amaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-28/sports/8601230093_1_duke-center-jay-bilas-playgrounds-pogo-sticks/2|title='Nobody Can Stop Him':  Even Gravity Can't Hold Johnny Dawkins Down|accessdate=2013-03-19|date=1986-03-28|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Markus, Robert}}</ref> When Amaker joined the {{cbb link|1983|sex=men|team=Duke Blue Devils|school=Duke University|title=1983<U+2013>84 Blue Devils}}, unranked Duke, led by Dawkins and Amaker, won its first seven games, the longest winning streak of fourth-year head coach Krzyzewski's career.

Amaker set many Duke career and single-season assists records. He held the record for single-season assists in the years between 1986 and 1990, which was broken by [[Bobby Hurley]].

[[Steve Wojciechowski]] broke Amaker's records in single-season assists to turnover ratio (2.88, 1985<U+2013>97) and career assists to turnover ratio (2.11, 1987<U+2013>98).  Although his single-season assists records were surpassed by Hurley's freshman, sophomore and senior season totals, it still remains a record for a Duke junior.<ref name=910DBR/>  He also held Duke's career NCAA tournament assist average record with 57 in 12 games for a 4.7 average until Hurley surpassed it with 145 in 20 games for a 7.3 average.<ref name=910DBT/>  His school single-game assists record of 14 that he tied (Kevin Billerman, March 2, 1974, vs. {{cbb link|1973|sex=men|team=North Carolina Tar Heels|school=University of North Carolina|title=North Carolina}}) vs. {{cbb link|1985|sex=men|team=Miami Hurricanes|school=University of Miami|title=Miami}} on February 19, 1986, was not broken until Hurley's senior 1993 season and is still a record for a junior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goduke.com/fls/4200/web-docs/2009-10_Duke_MBB_Media_Guide.pdf?SPSID=22748&SPID=1845&DB_OEM_ID=4200|accessdate=2010-04-01|title=2009<U+2013>10 Duke Media Guide|publisher=Duke University|page=157}}</ref>
