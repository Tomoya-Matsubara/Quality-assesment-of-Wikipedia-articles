'''Commercial insolvency in Canada''' has options and procedures that are distinct from those available in consumer [[insolvency]] proceedings. It is governed by the following statutes:

:* The ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'' ("BIA") <ref>{{Cite web|title = Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. B-3) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/index.html | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}</ref>
:* The ''[[Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act]]'' ("CCAA") <ref>{{Cite web|title = Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-36) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/index.html | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}</ref>
:* The ''Winding-Up and Restructuring Act'' <ref>{{Cite web|title = Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-11/index.html | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}</ref>

The following discussion concentrates on insolvency as it applies to corporations, but the rules apply to individuals and other entities involved in commercial matters as well, with necessary modifications.

==Financial difficulties prior to insolvency==

Provincial legislation under the [[property and civil rights]] power of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] regulates the resolution of financial difficulties that occur before the onset of insolvency, and the BIA incorporates many of them by reference in the application of its provisions. Notable legislation is in effect for governing:

* absconding debtors<ref>{{Cite web|title = Absconding Debtors Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990, c. A.2 | url = http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90a02_e.htm}}</ref>
* [[bulk sales]] (in Ontario and Newfoundland only)<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bulk Sales Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990, c. B.14 | url = http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_elaws_statutes_90b14_e.htm}}</ref>
* [[fraudulent conveyance]]s<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fraudulent Conveyances Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990, c. F.29 | url = http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90f29_e.htm}}</ref>
* relief of creditors<ref>{{Cite web|title = Creditors<U+2019> Relief Act, 2010 (Ontario) , S.O. 2010, c. 16, Sch. 4 | url = http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_10c16b_e.htm}}</ref>
* seizure of assets<ref>{{Cite web|title = Execution Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990, c. E.24 | url = http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90e24_e.htm}}</ref>

==Alternatives to resolving financial difficulties==

Where a commercial debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, it is generally in his best interests to work with the secured lenders.<ref>{{Cite web|author = D. Robb English, Paul Bowers and David Carson |title = Turnarounds: Dealing with the Secured Lender | url= http://www.airdberlis.com/Templates/Articles/articleFiles/315/Turnaround_seminar.pdf | publisher = [[Aird & Berlis]] | date = 2004-09-27/28 | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}</ref> The following options may be considered in order to seek a resolution to the matter:

* informal compromise with creditors
* out-of court [[restructuring|restructuring agreements]] <ref>{{Cite web|author = Milly Chow |title = Out-of-Court Restructurings | url= http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=4342 | publisher = [[Blake, Cassels & Graydon]] | date = 2010-11-16 | accessdate = 2011-09-07}}</ref>
* plans of arrangement under the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] or similar provincial corporations legislation <ref>{{Cite web|title = CBCA, S. 192 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-44/page-64.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Policy Concerning Arrangements Under Section 192 of the CBCA | url= https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/cs01073.html | publisher = Industry Canada | date = 2010-01-04 | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | author = Peter Rubin |title = Arrangement Provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act | url= http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=4341 | publisher = [[Blake, Cassels & Graydon]] | date = 2010-11-16 | accessdate = 2011-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Restructuring Under the Business Corporations Act | url= http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/Restructuring%20Under%20the%20Business%20Corporations%20Act_Sept09.pdf | publisher = [[Fraser Milner Casgrain]] | date = 2009-09 | accessdate = 2011-09-08}}</ref>
* the debtor making an assignment for the general benefit of creditors under the pertinent provincial legislation <ref>{{Cite web|title = Assignments and Preferences Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990, c. A.33 | url= http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90a33_e.htm | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}</ref>
* the creditor(s) securing appointment of a [[Receivership|receiver or interim receiver]] to seize and administer any of the debtor's property <ref>{{Cite web| author = Aubrey E. Kaufman and R. Graham Phoenix |title = Interim Receivers under the BIA: What practicality demands ... for now | url = http://www.fasken.com/files/Publication/b2d58d89-0bad-44a6-97b2-14f728357d13/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/85794bc1-84d1-4461-8af8-2521f3590497/Interim_Receivers_Under_the_BIA.pdf| publisher = [[Fasken Martineau]] | date = 2007-10-31 | accessdate = 2011-09-12}}</ref>
* the debtor making a proposal to creditors (known as a "Division I proposal") <ref>{{Cite web|title = Process for Division I Proposals | url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02052.html | publisher = OSB | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}</ref>
* the debtor making an application under the CCAA to make a compromise or arrangement with its creditors <ref>{{Cite web|title = The Companies<U+2019> Creditors Arrangement Act | url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02284.html | publisher = OSB | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}</ref>
* an insolvent debtor making an assignment under the BIA for the general benefit of his creditors<ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 49 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-23.html#h-22}}</ref>
* creditors applying for a bankruptcy order where the debtor owes at least $1,000 and has committed an act of bankruptcy

All options other than the first four have the effect of staying any proceedings that can be brought against the debtor.

Insolvent persons have the choice of making an assignment immediately, or to seek protection from creditors in order to reorganize their affairs and continue as a going concern. For the latter option, companies owing less than $5 million generally opt to file a Division I proposal, while those owing more can also opt for the CCAA proceeding.

==Entities subject to insolvency regime==

The BIA covers all debtor and insolvent persons, and "person" includes (in addition to individuals):

* partnerships (including one or more of the partners, upon the creditor's application) <ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 43(15) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-20.html#h-20}}</ref>
* unincorporated associations
* corporations (including income trusts, but excluding banks, insurance companies, trust companies, loan companies and railway companies)
* cooperative societies and organizations
* successors of partnerships, associations, corporations societies and organizations
* heirs, executors, liquidators of the succession, administrators or other legal representatives of a person <ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 2, definitions of "person" and "corporation" | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-1.html#h-2}}</ref>

The CCAA covers insolvent companies (together with their affiliates) with debts greater than $5 million. <ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-2.html#h-3}}</ref>

The ''Winding-Up and Restructuring Act'' covers financial institutions not covered by the BIA. <ref>{{Cite web|title = Winding-Up and Restructuring Act, S. 6(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-11/page-3.html#h-3}}</ref>

The ''Canada Transportation Act'' covers railway companies. <ref>{{Cite web|title = Canada Transportation Act, S. 106 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-10.4/page-33.html#h-58}}</ref>

==Settlement of the insolvent person's estate==

The trustee/receiver/monitor must first realize the amount of the proceeds from the property that is available for payment to the different classes of creditors, and different rules apply according to the type of proceeding. They are summarized as follows:

The estate is then settled, using the priority of claims outlined in the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act|BIA]].

==Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act (CCAA) proceedings==

The CCAA has been described as being similar in nature to [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code | Chapter 11]] proceedings in the United States and to [[Administration (law) | administration proceedings]] and [[Insolvency Act 1986 | company voluntary arrangements]] ("CVAs") in the United Kingdom. That is not quite correct, and the differences are highlighted as shown below:

==Creation of security interests==

It is in the lender's or supplier's best interest to minimize his financial exposure should his client experience financial difficulties. To that end, there is a range of remedies available to establish his status as a secured (vs unsecured) creditor under both provincial and federal legislation.<ref>{{Cite web|author = John R. Sandrelli, Christopher J. Ramsay and Anjili I. Bahadoorsingh |title = Remedies under Security Interests in Canada: An Overview | url= http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/archive/12619_Remedies_under_Security_IBA_pdf.PDF | publisher = [[Fraser Milner Casgrain]] | date = 2002-09-18 | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Federal Security Interests: Contract #99-08-2 | url= http://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/10278/Fraser%20Milner%20Casgrain%20Research%20Security%20Interests%20EN.pdf?sequence=1 | publisher = [[Fraser Milner Casgrain]] under contract to the Law Commission of Canada| date = 2000-06 | accessdate = 2011-09-14}}</ref>

In the common-law provinces, security interests are created through the registration of [[mortgage law | mortgages and charges]] against the real property concerned. In Qu<U+00E9>bec, this is done by way of [[hypothec]]s against immoveable property.

For personal property (moveable property in Qu<U+00E9>bec), secured creditors create their security interests through registration under the ''[[Personal Property Security Act]]'' ("PPSA") in force in their province, or under the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec|Civil Code]]'' in Qu<U+00E9>bec through the ''Registre des droits personnels et r<U+00E9>els mobiliers''.<ref>{{Cite web|author = Kiriakoula Hatzikiriako |title = An attempt to "demystify" Qu<U+00E9>bec secured transactions law (Part I) | url= http://www.mcmillan.ca/Files/ARTICLE_An%20attempt%20to%20demystify_ABA_E_0610.pdf | publisher = ABA Commercial Law Newsletter as reprinted by [[McMillan LLP]] | date = Summer 2010 | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Registre des droits personnels et r<U+00E9>els mobiliers | url= http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/programmes/rdprm-a.htm| accessdate = 2011-09-13}}</ref> Banks can also create security interests under SS. 426-427 of the [[Canada Bank Act | Bank Act]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bank Act (S.C. 1991, c. 46), S. 426 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-1.01/page-125.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Bank Act (S.C. 1991, c. 46), S. 427 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-1.01/page-126.html}}</ref> which normally have priority over PPSA registrations.<ref>{{Cite web|author = Rebecca M.

There can be complex interplay between insolvency law and other legal regimes, such as [[admiralty law]].<ref>{{Cite web|author = Robert A. Margolis and Christopher J. Giaschi |title = Priorities and Bankruptcy in Admiralty | url= http://www.admiraltylaw.com/papers/bankruptcy.pdf | date = 2002-04 | accessdate = 2011-09-22}}</ref>

==Debtor protection provisions==

No person may terminate or amend <U+2014> or claim an accelerated payment or forfeiture of the term under <U+2014> any agreement, including a security agreement, with a bankrupt individual by reason only of the individual<U+2019>s bankruptcy or insolvency. <ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 84.2 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-63.html}}</ref> Similar provision is made with respect to any insolvent person upon filing a notice of intention or a proposal, <ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 65.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-33.html}}</ref> as well as for any debtor company subject to the CCAA by reason only by reason only that proceedings commenced under the CCA or that the company is insolvent. <ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 34(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-20.html}}</ref> Because of these restrictions on what are called ''"ipso facto"'' clauses, creditors must be careful in specifying appropriate trigger events in their contracts' termination clauses. <ref>{{Cite web| author = Stephen J. Weisz |title = Insolvency and Restructuring Agreements in an Economic Downturn | url = http://www.blakes.com/english/publications/RI/pdf/Paper139.pdf | publisher = [[Blake, Cassels & Graydon]] | date = 2009-04 | accessdate = 2011-09-07}}</ref>

A notice of intention <ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 50.4 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-25.html}}</ref> or a Division I proposal <ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 62(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-30.html}}</ref> will automatically create a stay of proceedings and "no creditor has any remedy against the debtor or the debtor<U+2019>s property, or shall commence or continue any action, execution or other proceedings, for the recovery of a claim provable in bankruptcy". Similar provision is also made on the bankruptcy of any debtor. <ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 69.3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-51.html}}</ref> Directors of insolvent companies that have filed a notice of intention or a proposal have similar protection. <ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 69.31 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-52.html}}</ref>

Contracts may be assigned elsewhere in the event of a notice of intention of a Division I proposal<ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 66(1.1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-37.html}}</ref>, bankruptcy<ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 84.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-63.html}}</ref> or CCAA proceeding<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-9.html}}</ref>. Agreements of any kind can be disclaimed in the event of a Division I proposal<ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 65.11 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-34.html}}</ref> or CCAA proceeding<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 32 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-19.html#h-10}}</ref>, as well as leases in a bankruptcy proceeding<ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 30(1)(k) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-15.html}}</ref>.

Critical suppliers may be ordered to continue dealing with companies undergoing a CCAA proceeding, if the goods or services supplied are critical to the company's continued operation<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.4 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-9.html}}</ref>.

==Anti-avoidance provisions==

As in other countries, certain debtors may be tempted to bypass the process outlined above through the transfer of assets from an insolvent company to a [[phoenix company]], thus abandoning outstanding liabilities to creditors. Recent legal developments have made this procedure unattractive, through creditors using the [[oppression remedy]] available under the CBCA and similar provincial corporations legislation. <ref>{{Cite web| author = Mark Wiffen |title = getting blood from a stone <U+2013> enforcing unpaid corporate judgments against directors | url = http://www.mcmillan.ca/95997 | publisher = [[McMillan LLP]] | date = 2011-07 | accessdate = 2011-09-04}}</ref>

Several procedures are available for investigating companies' behaviour during times of insolvency or other financial difficulty.

Where bankruptcy is sought, it does not necessarily wipe the slate clean on certain debts.

==Removal of directors==

The court has power to remove one or more of the company's directors, if the court is satisfied that the director is unreasonably impairing or is likely to unreasonably impair the possibility of a viable proposal (or in the case of the CCAA, a compromise or arrangement) being made in respect of the company or is acting or is likely to act inappropriately as a director in the circumstances. <ref>{{Cite web|title = BIA, s. 64 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-31.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 11.5 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-10.html}}</ref>
