First shown on 6 July 2014, the drama examines the issues surrounding a case where the defendants were charged with murder involving joint enterprise or common purpose. McGovern was inspired by the case of 16-year-old Jordan Cunliffe, sentenced under this law for a minimum term of 12 years for the [[murder of Garry Newlove]], despite not taking part in the attack.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=Common: Jimmy McGovern takes on 'group' crime rule|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-28148073|accessdate=6 July 2014|work=BBC|date=6 July 2014}}</ref>

==Plot==
Johnjo O'Shea is an ordinary 17-year-old, who gives a few friends of his older brother a lift in his brother's car and although he and his family consider him to be an innocent bystander, he ends up in court charged as an accessory to murder, under the doctrine of [[common purpose]], the "common" of the film's title.

==Critical reception==
[[The Daily Telegraph]] gave it 4/5 stars, calling it "profoundly engaging", with Nico Mirallegro, "giving a fine performance of coiled vulnerability".<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news|last1=Lawrence|first1=Ben|title=Common, BBC One, review: 'profoundly engaging'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10947419/Common-BBC-One-review-profoundly-engaging.html|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=7 July 2014}}</ref> According to [[The Guardian]], "When Jimmy McGovern gets off his soapbox this is a brutal and devastating drama", "bleak, powerful drama thick with political intent, which occasionally robs it of its quality", and "the knockout performance belongs to Susan Lynch, who plays the victim's mother".<ref name=Guardian/>
