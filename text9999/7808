In Black's nearly 20 years on the Coke board and on "a company committee that focused on policy issues including [[Soft drink#Obesity and weight related diseases|obesity and selling soda to children]]," Bloomberg and others opposed the company and other manufacturers' sales efforts in schools. Black resigned her position on the Coke board after the NYC nomination, citing potential conflicts of interest. She was paid over $2 million in cash and stock over her tenure on the board, and still owns over $3 million worth of company stock. The mayor reiterated both the school policy against soda sales and his support for Black when the subject was raised after the nomination. [[Donald McHenry]], "a longtime Coke board member and a professor at [[Georgetown University]] who sat on the committee" with Black, confirmed that the issue had faced the board continuously but did not address Black's position or individual role in the internal company debates, decisions and actions.<ref>Barbaro, Michael and Anemona Hartocollis, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/nyregion/17coke.html?hpw "As Bloomberg Fought Sodas, Nominee Sat on Coke Board"], ''The New York Times'', November 16, 2010. Retrieved 2010-11-29.</ref>

==Schools chancellor==
As chancellor, Black was head of the [[New York City Department of Education]], the largest [[school district|public school system]] in the United States, which serves more than 1.1 million students in more than 1,600 schools. She resigned, after much controversy, on April 7, 2011.

===Controversy===
Having neither three years of teaching experience nor a master's degree nor a professional degree in educational management, Black required a waiver from the [[New York State Education Department]] under [[Commissioner of Education of the State of New York|Education Commissioner]] [[David M. Steiner]].<ref name="NYT01">Gootman, Elissa and Jennifer Medina, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/nyregion/11schools.html "Mayor Takes Idea of Education Outsider to New Level"], ''The New York Times'', November 10, 2010 (November 11, 2010 p. A32 NY ed.). Retrieved 2010-11-11.</ref> The waiver was granted by Steiner, with Black's shortfall in formal qualifications "offset by the appointment of a chief academic officer to serve by her side [as well as her] 'exceptional record of successfully leading complex organizations and achievement of excellence in her endeavors.'" Black appointed [[Shael Polakow-Suransky]] to the academic-officer role, and assumed her post January 1, 2011.<ref>Hernandez, Javier C., [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/state-grants-waiver-for-schools-chancellor/?hp "State Grants Waiver for Schools Chancellor"], ''The New York Times'' City Room blog, November 29, 2010, 5:17 pm. Retrieved 2010-11-29.</ref>  Steiner announced his own resignation the very same afternoon, but did not disclose any reason.  Before her appointment was approved, Bloomberg's office announced supporters of his choice included former Mayors [[Rudy Giuliani]] and [[Ed Koch]], State Senator [[Malcolm Smith (U.S. politician)|Malcolm Smith]], City Council Majority Leader [[Joel Rivera]]. Oprah Winfrey has also publicly supported Black as the chancellor.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2010/11/18/2010-11-18_bloomberg_gets_endorsements_from_oprah_other_heavyweights_to_bolster_case_for_ca.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Elliptical vs. treadmill: Which will give you the better workout?}}</ref>

After taking office, Black upset parents on January 14, 2011, when responding to a question from a parent about overcrowded classrooms in New York City by jokingly suggesting that the solution to future overcrowding may be [[birth control]].<ref name=gaffe>{{Cite news  | last = Gonen | first = Yoav | title = Cathie Black Gaffe Riles Parents Concerned About Overcrowding | newspaper = [[New York Post]]  | date = 2011-01-15  | url = http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/black_wisecrack_on_birth_control_a0EUsHTDjVvWAMvA5qf6KI  | postscript =}}</ref>  Black also said at the same meeting that making decisions about satisfying classroom space concerns is like making "many [[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]s" <U+2013> a reference to a novel in which a mother is forced to choose which of her children is killed at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].<ref name=gaffe/>  A spokesman for the Department of Education later said Black cares about overcrowding, and "regrets if she left a different impression by making an off-handed joke in the course of that conversation."<ref name=gaffe/>

As Schools Chancellor, Black presided over meetings on February 1 and February 3, 2011, to close 22 schools that the City classified as failing.  Towards the end of the meeting on February 1, Black spoke to the crowd of parents.  At that meeting Black told the crowd "I can't speak if you're shouting," and after the crowd continued to boo Black, she responded by imitating the crowd's jeers in a "mocking" fashion.<ref name=heckles>{{Cite news | title = Schools Chancellor Cathie Black Met With Heckles at Hearing | newspaper = [[New York Post]]  | date = 2011-02-04  | url = http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/schools_chancellor_black_comes_under_afQQS8zi6mEUxEFKo1y7SO  | postscript = | first1=Yoav | last1=Gonen | first2=Doug | last2=Auer}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = N.Y.C.
