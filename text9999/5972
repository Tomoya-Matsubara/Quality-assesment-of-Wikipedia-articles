'''<U+00C6>lfric of Abingdon''' ({{lang-ang|<U+00C6>lfr<U+012B>c}}; died 16 November 1005), also known as '''<U+00C6>lfric of Wessex''', was a late 10th century [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He previously held the offices of [[abbot]] of [[St Albans Abbey]] and [[Bishop of Ramsbury]], as well as likely being the abbot of [[Abingdon Abbey]]. After his election to Canterbury, he continued to hold the bishopric of Ramsbury along with the archbishopric of Canterbury until his death in 1005. <U+00C6>lfric may have altered the composition of Canterbury's [[cathedral chapter]] by changing the clergy serving in the cathedral from secular clergy to monks. In his will he left a a ship to King [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready|<U+00C6>thelred II of England]] as well as more ships to other legatees.

== Early life ==
<U+00C6>lfric was the son of an earl of Kent<ref name=1000Church125>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 125 footnote 3</ref> and became a monk of Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He was very likely Abbot of Abingdon<ref name=DNB>Mason "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/185 <U+00C6>lfric (d. 1005)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> before becoming Abbot of St Albans Abbey around 975,<ref name=Knowles65>Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses'' p. 65</ref> although some historians do not believe that he held the office of Abbot at Abingdon. Although the ''[[Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis]]'', or ''History of the Church of Abingdon'', names <U+00C6>lfric as abbot, the abbatial lists do not record him as such. Indirect corroboration of his being abbot at Abingdon is a grant of land to <U+00C6>lfric personally (instead of to the office he held) while he was archbishop that had previously been unjustly taken from Abingdon. This land was to revert to Abingdon after <U+00C6>lfric's death.<ref name=DNB/>

==Bishop and archbishop==

<U+00C6>lfric's brother, Leofric, succeeded <U+00C6>lfric as [[Abbot of St Albans]] when <U+00C6>lfric became bishop.<ref name=Stafford169>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 169</ref> Between 991 and 993, <U+00C6>lfric rose to the [[Bishop of Ramsbury|Bishopric of Ramsbury]],<ref name=Handbook220>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 220</ref> and possibly continued to hold office of abbot of St Albans while bishop.<ref name=DNB/> In 995 he was elevated to the [[see of Canterbury]]. He was [[Translation (ecclesiastical)|translated]], or moved with appropriate ecclesiastical ceremony, to Canterbury on 21 April 995<ref name=Handbook214>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology''  p. 214</ref> at a [[witenagemot]] held at [[Amesbury]].<ref name=Williams20>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' p. 20</ref> Here he received the permission of "King <U+00C6>thelred and all the witan" to be elevated to Canterbury.<ref name=1000Church107>Quoted in Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 107 footnote 5</ref> <U+00C6>lfric continued to hold Ramsbury along with Canterbury until his death.<ref name=Williams36>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' p. 36</ref> The story that his brother  was chosen first for Canterbury but refused, stems from confusion on the part of [[Matthew of Paris]] and historians generally hold the entire episode to be untrue.<ref name=DNB/>

<U+00C6>lfric's appointment to Canterbury caused consternation with the clergy of the cathedral chapter. In reaction, the chapter sent two members to Rome ahead of <U+00C6>lfric and tried to secure the archbishopric for either of the monks. Pope [[Pope Gregory V|Gregory V]], however, would not appoint a candidate without royal permission, which neither of the monks had.<ref name=1000Church103>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 103</ref> Instead, when <U+00C6>lfric arrived in Rome in 997, he was appointed and received the [[pallium]], a symbol of an archbishop's authority.<ref name=Ortenberg49>Ortenberg "Anglo-Saxon Church and the Papacy" ''English Church and the Papacy in the Middle Ages'' p. 49</ref> He also witnessed some miracles at the gravesite of [[Edward the Martyr]] at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]], helping to lead to Edward's sainthood.<ref name=Emma52>O'Brien ''Queen Emma and the Vikings'' pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref>

A story was told that <U+00C6>lfric introduced monks into the cathedral church of [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], replacing the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|secular clerks]] that had taken over the foundation during the ninth century.<ref name=ASE456>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 453</ref> <U+00C6>lfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the [[Norman Conquest]] and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear.<ref name=Monastic50>Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 50</ref> He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready]] and [[Emma of Normandy]] in 1002.<ref name=Emma31>O'Brien ''Queen Emma and the Vikings'' p. 31</ref> A later tradition held that he consecrated a [[Bishop of Llandaff]] and two [[Bishop of St David's|Bishops of St. David's]] in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.<ref name=1000Church232>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 232</ref>

Either <U+00C6>lfric or his predecessor Sigeric wrote a letter to [[Wulfine|Wulfsige, Bishop of Sherborne]] about the duties of bishops to make sure that the laity did not despoil churches. The letter also urged Wulfsige to exhort the laity to strive for justice in their dealings with others, help widows and orphans, not fight, as well as other moral precepts.<ref name=1000Church64>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 64</ref> <U+00C6>lfric also ordered the composition of the first ''Life of Dunstan'', a [[hagiography]], or saint's life, of [[Dunstan]], a predecessor as Archbishop of Canterbury.<ref name=1000Church62>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 62</ref> He also acted as a royal judge, once being ordered by King <U+00C6>thelred to adjudicate a case between [[thegn]]s, or local noblemen.<ref name=1000Church147>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 147 footnote 4</ref>

==Death and legacy==

<U+00C6>lfric died on 16 November 1005<ref name=Handbook214/> and was buried in Abingdon Abbey, later being translated to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. His will survives and in it he left ships to the people of [[Wiltshire]] and [[Kent]], with his best one, equipped for sixty men, going to King <U+00C6>thelred.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Williams81>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' pp. 81<U+2013>82</ref> The hagiography of Dunstan was dedicated to <U+00C6>lfric at the end of the 10th century.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Darlington389>Darlington "Ecclesiastical Reform" ''English Historical Review'' p. 389</ref> After his death, he was considered a saint with a feast day of 16 November.<ref name=Patron>Patron Saints Online "[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-alfric-of-canterbury/ Saint Aelfric of Canterbury]"</ref><ref name=Dict12>Walsh ''New Dictionary of Saints'' p. 12</ref>
