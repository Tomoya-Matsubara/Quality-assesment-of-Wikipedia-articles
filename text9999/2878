That same year, Caldecott won best actor in a Vancouver Theatre Festival for his performance in a play by Sheldon Rosen called ''The Box''.  Shortly thereafter Caldecott, also known as Todd Shaffer, obtained an agent, and began working in the film and television industry, guest-starring in several television shows including ''[[Wiseguy]]'', ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', ''[[Danger Bay]]'', ''[[Northwood (TV series)|Northwood]]'' and ''[[Bordertown]]''.

After becoming disillusioned with the film industry, Caldecott traveled to [[India]] and [[West Asia]] in 1990 for a year long trip on a budget of only a "few dollars a day" <ref>Caldecott, Todd. 2006. Ayurveda: The Divine Science of Life. Edinburgh, UK: Elsevier. p xi</ref>.  During this year he studied Indian classical music in [[Chennai]] and [[Varanasi]], [[India]] and [[buddhist]] [[meditation]] in [[Bodhgaya]], India and [[Nilambe]], [[Sri Lanka]] <ref>http://www.toddcaldecott.com/biography_le.html</ref>.  During his travel and study he became very ill, at one point suffering from both bacillary and amoebic [[dysentery]] <ref>Caldecott, Todd. 2006. Ayurveda: The Divine Science of Life. Edinburgh, UK: Elsevier. p xi</ref>.  After leaving India he traveled in a weakened state to the Northern Area of [[Pakistan]], including [[Gilgit]], the [[Hunza valley]] and [[Pasu]].  It was in these areas, renown for their long-lived inhabitants, healthy food and glacial water that he "partially recovered" from his illness <ref>Caldecott, Todd. 2006. Ayurveda: The Divine Science of Life. Edinburgh, UK: Elsevier. p xi</ref>.  He then went on to travel throughout [[Iran]], spending several weeks as the guest of a [[Sufi]] master in [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] <ref>http://www.toddcaldecott.com/biography_le.html</ref>.

Returning to Canada, Caldecott sought relief from what now had become a chronic digestive disorder, and found success in the treatments of an Ayurvedic physician <ref>Caldecott, Todd. 2006. Ayurveda: The Divine Science of Life.  Edinburgh, UK: Elsevier. p xi</ref>.  This would prove to have an enormous influence on his life path, and shortly thereafter Caldecott enrolled and graduated from a three year, full-time clinical program in Western Herbal Medicine at the Coastal Mountain College in Vancouver <ref>http://www.toddcaldecott.com/biography_ed.html</ref>.  After graduating, Caldecott immediately traveled back to India to study [[Ayurvedic medicine]] in [[Coimbatore]], India over a five month period, and then returned to Canada to begin practicing, writing and teaching<ref>Caldecott, Todd. 2006.
