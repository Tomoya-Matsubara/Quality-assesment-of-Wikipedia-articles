[[Ensign (Star Trek)|Ensign]] '''Harry S. L. Kim''' is a [[fictional character]] who appeared in each of the seven seasons of the American [[television series]] ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. Portrayed by [[Garrett Wang]], he is the Operations Officer aboard the [[Starfleet]] starship [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']]. There was some difficulty in casting the part prior to the start of the series in 2005, with a reported lack of young Asian actors to choose from. 

The character first appeared in the pilot episode of the series, "[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]". The character continued to appear throughout the series in a main cast role, with his final appearance in the finale, "[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]". In that episode, an [[alternative future]] version of the character is seen as a Starfleet Captain. He is typically shown as being naive, especially in romantic situations, but gifted. The character finds the ship's first possible route home, and in one alternative future, he manages to develop a [[transwarp drive]] which allows him and [[Chakotay]] to travel home in a matter of hours but kills the rest of the crew. The producers had considered whether or not to kill off Kim during the third season. Wang subsequently reprised the role of Harry Kim for the fan-made ''[[Star Trek: Renegades]]''.

Reviewers said that Kim represented one of the elements of [[multiculturalism]] in the crew of ''Voyager'', which also represented a proxy family for Kim. The storylines featuring Kim frequently had the character captured by aliens, something which was described as a typical ''Voyager'' storyline by critics. "[[Timeless (Star Trek: Voyager)|Timeless]]" has been ranked as the best episode to feature Kim, and also the third best of the series, but holodeck episodes featuring Kim have also been listed by [[Io9]] as some of the worst of their type in the franchise.

==Concept and development==
{{Quote box
 |quote = Having never experienced adversity, he has fewer of the tools for coping than some of the others. Though he tries to keep such thoughts from surfacing, he's scared. He's over his head in this mission; he thought he'd be gone for a month and then go home to share his adventures with his folks. But what has happened is unthinkable, and often he has the sensation that it's just a bad dream, that he will wake up in his bedroom at home, to the sound of his mother singing in the garden, and his father hammering copper plate for sculpture.

Wang was enthusiastic about his new role, describing Kim's background by saying that "I had a stellar Starfleet Academy career and am basically the rookie on the bridge. I'm an Asian-American. There's the professional competence, but also the inner fear, 'Oh my God, are these [[Breeches|britches]] too big for me?'

Wang had initially gone along with the writing on the show until towards the end of the second season when he asked the production writers if he could have some actions scenes and perhaps a romance. He had realised at the time that he was the only member of the main cast without a [[stunt double]] as he had never had an action scene that required one. This resulted in the [[Brannon Braga]] penned "[[Non Sequitur (Star Trek: Voyager)|Non Sequitur]]", to which Wang said to [[Rick Berman]] that there wasn't a need to give him all his requests in a single episode. Following that, he became more involved in suggestions for character direction but the writers avoided given Kim more of a comedic element similar to [[The Doctor (Star Trek)|The Doctor]] ([[Robert Picardo]]) and [[Neelix]] ([[Ethan Phillips]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Interviews {{!}} Garret Wang {{!}} Taking control|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/garrett/page5.shtml|publisher=BBC Cult|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref> Wang described himself as someone who tells jokes and makes impersonations on sets and was disappointed at not being able to utilise this nature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interviews {{!}} Garret Wang {{!}} Funny man|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/garrett/page8.shtml|publisher=BBC Cult|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref> The producers at one point had planned to permanently kill off Harry Kim during season three, but after Wang was included in the ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' list of sexiest people alive 1997, the plan was abandoned.<ref name=ugo>{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kevin|title=The Craziest TV Stories That Seriously ALMOST Happened: 20: Harry Kim Would Have Died|url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/what-if-crazy-tv-stories-star-trek-voyager|publisher=UGO|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Garret Wang|journal=People|date=May 12, 1997|volume=47|issue=18|page=104|url=http://archive.people.com/people/archive/jpgs/19970512/19970512-750-107.jpg|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref>

By season five of ''Voyager'', certain characters were seen by the production staff as being under-utilised, Kim amongst them. This led to episodes placing Kim, Chakotay and Tuvok in central positions, including the episode "[[Timeless (Star Trek: Voyager)|Timeless]]" for the character of Kim.<ref name=saganintereview>{{cite web|last=Davenport|first=Caillan|title=Nick Sagan <U+2013> Part 1|url=http://www.trektoday.com/interviews/nick_sagan_part_one.shtml|publisher=[[TrekNation]]|date=October 27, 2003|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref> Wang was pleased with the episode, and felt that being able to act as the two different versions of Kim showed "a great [[dichotomy]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Interviews {{!}} Garret Wang {{!}} Voyager's saviour|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/garrett/page4.shtml|publisher=BBC Cult|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref> Following the end of the show in 2001,<ref>{{cite news|last=Pierce|first=Scott D.|title=It's 'Endgame' for 'Voyager'|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FzxOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xO0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5347,3810206&dq=voyager+endgame&hl=en|accessdate=August 8, 2013|newspaper=The Deseret News|date=May 22, 2001}}</ref> Wang had felt that the character should have been promoted during the course of the series, but was told by producers that "someone's got to be the ensign".<ref>{{cite web|title=Interviews {{!}} Garret Wang {{!}} Always the Ensign|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/garrett/page3.shtml|publisher=BBC Cult|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>

The mothering nature of Janeway on Kim has been described by reviewers, with the crew forming a type of family network which has Kim as a surrogate son. His separation from his [[nuclear family]] at a young age is described as cruel, and Janeway, Chakotay and Tuvok are highlighted as his defacto parents in the series.<ref>[[#relke2006|Relke (2006)]]: p. 28</ref> This motherly position was described by Michelle Erica Green in her review of the episode "The Disease" for [[TrekNation]], who described certain scenes as Kim needing to request permission from "Mommy" in order to have a relationship with an alien.<ref name=tndisease>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michelle Erica|title=The Disease|url=http://www.trektoday.com/reviews/voy/the_disease.shtml|publisher=TrekNation|date=January 13, 2004|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> She felt that the disease itself caused the character to grow a "backbone" as he had rarely asserted himself previously to the Captain.<ref name=tndisease/>

Kim has been used to show the [[multiculturalism]] of ''Star Trek: Voyager''. One scene was described in "[[Faces (Star Trek: Voyager)|Faces]]" by Elisabeth Anne Leonard which featured a sweeping shot around the command table of Janeway, Chakotay, Tuvok and Kim, showing a [[White people|Caucasian race]] woman, a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], a man of Asian descent and a [[black people|black]] [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] in a single shot.<ref>[[#leonard1997|Leonard (1997)]]: p. 123</ref> Kim's persistent optimism has been highlighted, with him being one of the few characters in the series who by the seventh series still believed that they would return home in their lifetime.<ref>[[#relke2006|Relke (2006)]]: p. 61</ref> Kim seemed to be frequently captured by alien species during the course of the series to the extent that it was described as one of the typical storylines seen in ''Voyager'' during an overview by the ''[[The A.V. Club]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nowalk|first=Brandon|title=''Star Trek: Voyager'' accidentally presided over the franchise<U+2019>s decline|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/star-trek-voyager-accidentally-presided-over-the-f,98207/|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=The A.V.

The authors of the book ''Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos'' thought that the episode "Deadlock" which featured the death of Kim was one of several examples in the ''Star Trek'' franchise where the death of an major character is reversed by a parallel existence. Other examples included in ''The Next Generation'' with the return of [[Tasha Yar]] in "[[Yesterday's Enterprise]]" and the death of [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] in the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode "[[Visionary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Visionary]]".<ref name=sacredtime77>[[#wagnerlundeen1998|Wagner; Lundeen (1998)]]: p. 77</ref> They felt that Kim also shared another similarity with "Yesterday's Enterprise" in that in the episode "Non Sequitur", he feels that reality has been changed <U+2013> which was similar to the experience that [[Guinan (Star Trek character)|Guinan]] felt in ''The Next Generation'' episode.<ref name=sacredtime199>[[#wagnerlundeen1998|Wagner; Lundeen (1998)]]: p. 199</ref>

Amongst Kim's relationships included the relationship with a character on the ship's [[holodeck]] in the episode "Alter Ego", but after building a rivalry for the character's affections with Tuvok, he becomes disinterested after finding out that the character was being played by a real person.<ref name=sacredtime105>[[#wagnerlundeen1998|Wagner; Lundeen (1998)]]: p. 105</ref> This relationship was highlighted as an example of how ''Star Trek'' describes the ideal woman as an "objectified embodiment of male desire with no inner self to complicate the so-called relationship that a man may have with her".<ref name=sacredtime102>[[#wagnerlundeen1998|Wagner; Lundeen (1998)]]: p. 102</ref>

Juliette Harrisson for the website [[Den of Geek]] described "Timeless" as the best Harry Kim episode, and was the third best episode of ''Voyager'' overall. She said that "Wang<U+2019>s bitter, emotionally scarred performance holds together an hour which also features some lovely imagery".<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrisson|first=Juliette|title=Top 10 Star Trek: Voyager episodes|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek/22869/top-10-star-trek-voyager-episodes|publisher=Den of Geek|date=October 3, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> Episodes centering around Kim were included in [[io9]]'s list of the worst holodeck related episodes in ''Star Trek''. These included "The Thaw", with the worst moment described as "the Harry Kim baby thing".<ref name=worstholodeck>{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|title=Star Trek's Absolute Worst Holodeck Adventures|url=http://io9.com/5280450/star-treks-absolute-worst-holodeck-adventures|publisher=Io9|date=June 5, 2009|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> Other episodes highlighted as bad included "Fair Haven" while it stated that it skipped the first season "Heroes and Demons".<ref name=worstholodeck/> Wang later returned to ''Star Trek'' in fan-made productions and to the role of Harry Kim in ''[[Star Trek: Renegades]]'', alongside [[Manu Intiraymi]] and [[Tim Russ]] from ''Voyager''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nuytens|first=Gilles|title=Garrett Wang interview|url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/garrett_wang_01.htm|publisher=The Sci-Fi World|date=August 20, 2007|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Leao|first=Gustavo|title=Garrett Wang Returns to the Role of Harry Kim in Star Trek Renegades Independent Web Pilot, Manu Intiraymi Returns as Icheb|url=http://trekweb.com/articles/2012/09/19/Garrett-Wang-Returns-to-the-Role-of-Harry-Kim-in-Star-Trek-Renegades-Independent-Web-Pilot-Manu-Intiraymi-Returns-as-Icheb.shtml|publisher=TrekWeb.com|date=September 19, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref><ref name=houston>{{cite news|last=O'Connor|first=Kyrie|title='Star Trek' may get new, darker life|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/kyrie/article/Star-Trek-may-get-new-darker-life-4097352.php|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=December 7, 2012}}</ref>
