'''''The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest''''' is an animated action-adventure television series produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Cartoons]] and broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]] from August 26, 1996 to April 16, 1997. A revival of the 1960s ''[[Jonny Quest]]'' franchise, it features teenage adventurers Jonny Quest, Hadji Singh, and Jessie Bannon as they accompanied Dr. Benton Quest and bodyguard Race Bannon to investigate strange phenomena, legends, and mysteries in exotic locales. Action also takes place in the [[virtual world|virtual realm]] of QuestWorld, a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] cyberspace domain rendered with computer animation.

Conceived in the early 1990s, ''Real Adventures'' suffered a long and troubled development. Hanna-Barbera dismissed creator Peter Lawrence in 1996 and hired new producers to finish the show. John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti completed Lawrence's work; David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston wrote new episodes with reworked character designs akin to those of classic ''Quest''. Each team produced half of the show's fifty-two episodes. While Lawrence's team crafted stories of real-world mystery and exploration, later writers used science fiction and paranormal plots.

[[Turner Entertainment]] supported the show through a massive marketing campaign with thirty-three licensees. ''Real Adventures'' debuted with an unprecedented wide release on Cartoon Network, [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]], and [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], airing twenty-one times per week. Critics have debated the merits of the show's animation, writing, and spirit compared to classic ''Quest'', but it has also received praise in those categories. ''Real Adventures'' failed to gain high ratings with its targeted demographics and its merchandise performed poorly, leading to cancellation after fifty-two episodes. Turner has released eight VHS, two laserdisc, and thirteen DVD episodes; reruns have appeared on [[Toonami]], [[CNX]], and other Cartoon Network formats.

The creative team researched child psychology, ensuring they could depict realistic action and consequences without fueling nightmares.<ref name="arkansasgazettereview" /> Seibert described the show's theme as "''The [[X-Files]]'' for kids", citing difficult questions and mysteries to be posed in each episode.<ref name="tvzoneteam" />

Lawrence initially titled the show ''Jonny Quest's Extraordinary Adventures'', but the title changed in 1995 to its final name.<ref name="bible">{{cite web | date=1994-05-18, 1996-01-17, 1996-02-06 | author = Lawrence, Peter and Glenn Leopold | title = The New Jonny Quest Writer's Bible | publisher = Hanna-Barbera | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Writer%27s_Bible | accessdate=June 19, 2007}}</ref><ref name="hollywoodreporteradventures">{{cite journal | last = Hettrick | first = Scott | title = TBS seeks more Jonny Quest | date=1995-03-21 | journal = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher = BPI Communications, Inc. }}</ref> Intended for a 1995 release with sixty-five episodes, ''Real Adventures'' fell into [[development hell]]; roughly thirty scripts and only eight reels were in progress by March 1995.<ref name="animag" /><ref name="crowningglory" /><ref name="brandweek2" /> H-B removed Lawrence and Takashi in 1996, hiring John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti to finish the first twenty-six episodes.<ref name="animag" /><ref name="brandweek2">{{cite journal | last = Lefton | first = Terry | title = Turner relaunches 'Quest' | date=1995-06-19 | journal = [[Brandweek]] magazine | volume = 36 | issue = 25 | publisher = VNU eMedia, Inc.}}</ref><ref name="jonnyonaquest">{{cite journal | title = Jonny's on a Quest in 1995 | date=1995-05-03 | journal = [[Chicago Tribune]] | page = KIDNEWS 8}}</ref> Certain sequences necessitated exhaustive work and heavy revision.<ref name="anipla">{{cite journal | date=1996-11-17 | author = Miller, Bob | title = Interview with Lance Falk | journal = Animation Planet Magazine}}</ref><ref name="aniart">{{cite web | year=2000 | title=Interview with Lance Falk | url=http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Lance_Falk/LFalk.html | work=Animation Artist Magazine | accessdate=June 19, 2007}}</ref> A new team led by David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston finished twenty-six more for broadcast as a separate series named ''The New Jonny Quest''.<ref name="animag" /><ref name="bible" /> Time Warner's acquisition of Turner negated this plan, leading to the episodes' release as the second season of ''Real Adventures''.

===Animation and music===
Peter Lawrence aimed to "go beyond cartooning and into animated film-making" for the show's storytelling.<ref name="crowningglory" /> Producers contracted seven studios to animate the first season, including Pacific Animation Co. in Japan and Toon's Factory in France.<ref name="3deffect" /> Japanese and Korean animators drew traditional [[cel]] sequences and added color; an international team handled digital post-production and QuestWorld scenes.<ref name="animag" /><ref name="crowningglory" /> A team in Paris specialized in computer editing and post-production.<ref name="crowningglory" /> Over a quarter of the first season's footage was digitally inked and painted to enhance background elements.<ref name="animag" /> Producers applied the process in excess of twenty hours per episode, adding light effects, rain, snow, glitter, reflections, and fog.<ref name="animag" /> H-B implemented a new computer system to combine manual animation with digital paint, and to provide camera movement flexibility, which created a partial [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] effect.<ref name="crowningglory" /><ref name="3deffect">{{cite journal | title = Segal, Roth embark on H-B voice 'Quest' | date=1995-09-20 | journal = [[Daily Variety]] magazine | publisher = Reed Business Information}}</ref> Takashi felt the system made the creative team "honest filmmakers" through hands-on production.<ref name="crowningglory" /> Lawrence described the system in 1995:

{{cquote2|We almost have a fine cut before we start animating. The pencil test is imported into the computer...

The tape goes to the compositor and the whole thing is laid together way upfront.|Peter Lawrence<ref name="crowningglory" />}}

''Real Adventures'' maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring off-screen deaths of villains and allies.<ref name="akron">{{cite journal | last = Heldenfels | first = RD | title = '7th Heaven' may well be too down-to-earth: New Warner Bros. show first arrival in expected wave of early-evening family programming this season | date=1996-08-26 | journal = [[Akron Beacon Journal]] | publisher = Akron Beacon Journal}}</ref> Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season without digital post-processing.<ref name="anipla" /> The show's format dictated that title sequences be aired first, followed by a short introduction, the first act, and the second act, with commercial breaks between. Bodie Chandler directed music for ''Quest'', and Gary Lionelli, Thomas Chase, [[Stephen Rucker]], [[Lawrence H. Brown]], [[Guy Moon]], Kevin Kiner, [[Christophe Beck]], and Mark Koval wrote incidental music and cues.<ref name="daytimeemmy" /> Gary Lionelli conceived a new main theme based on the original 1960s ''Jonny Quest'' theme by [[Hoyt Curtin]]. Composer Guy Moon considered working for the show the "hardest thing I've done in my life" due to the producers' demands for epic music: "They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig... It's great because they push me so much I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with 'Jonny Quest' music... It's hip and it's current."<ref name="guymoon">{{cite web | title=Guy Moon | year=1996 | author=Clay, Jennifer | url=http://www.bmi.com/guymoon.html | publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] | work=BMI.com | archivedate=1996-10-20 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19961020023157/http://bmi.com/guymoon.html | accessdate=June 19, 2007}}</ref> Stephen Rucker and Thomas Chase used [[MIDI]] to facilitate composing.<ref name="kidscreencomposition">{{cite journal | title = TV cartoon music gaining in sophistication | date=1997-09-01 | journal = Kidscreen magazine | page = 14 | publisher = Brunico Communications Ltd. }}</ref> Chase appreciated the producers' commitment to scoring, noting, "For many kids, animation music is their first exposure to orchestral music."<ref name="kidscreencomposition" />

===QuestWorld===
Producers cultivated an element of virtual reality through QuestWorld, a cyberspace simulation rendered with three-dimensional computer animation and motion capture.<ref name="animag" /> QuestWorld was designed as a futuristic application of contemporary technology, similar to the classic series' high-tech lasers, satellites, and robots.<ref name="timesherald">{{cite news | last = Simmons | first = Tony | title = The 'Quest' continues | work = Panama City Times Herald | date = 1996-12-15 | url = http://www.newsherald.com/EDUCATION/QUESTX.HTM | archivedate=1999-01-29 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990129024326/http://www.newsherald.com/EDUCATION/QUESTX.HTM | accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref> Seibert traced its origin to "the same problem that James Bond [has]... When you look at even his newest gadgets, they're somewhat quaint."<ref name="jonnyredux" /> H-B marketers polled children on their familiarity with virtual reality, discovering that each child was aware of the concept.<ref name="tvzoneteam" /> Planners took inspiration from [[cyberpunk]] novels written by [[Neal Stephenson]] and [[William Gibson]], including ''[[Snow Crash]]''.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Short, independent QuestWorld segments called "Quest Bytes" concluded certain episodes. QuestWorld characters were created as [[Wire-frame model|wire frame]] models, augmented with faces scanned from clay busts, then digitally painted and inked.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Animation company Buzz F/X, based in Montreal and Santa Monica, created first season sequences.<ref name="lord">{{cite web | author=Lord, Francois | title=Francois Lord's Commentary | date=1997-04-11 | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Francois_Lord%27s_Commentary | accessdate=June 19, 2007}}</ref> Work began in April 1996 with the opening titles<U+2014>a gliding journey through a canyon of green, cartographic lines with scenes illuminated upon the walls.

Work followed on "Escape to Questworld" and "Trouble on the Colorado" as animators worked twelve hours a day, six days a week in a small garage with inadequate computers.<ref name="lord" /> Buzz F/X augmented the small team in July with ten recruits, but only two were experienced.<ref name="lord" /> Amateur employees struggled with lighting, and with synchronizing jerky motion capture from the House of Moves in Venice Beach; ''Quest'' was their first capture production order.<ref name="lord" /><ref name="hollywoodhouseofmoves">{{cite journal | title = Motion-capture firms get busy | date=1996-12-23 | last = DiOrio | first = Carl | journal = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher = BPI Communications, Inc. }}</ref> By August, the team was working fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, including full nights and mornings.<ref name="lord" /> After two more episodes, Buzz F/X terminated its unprofitable contract with H-B, later filing for bankruptcy in 1997 due to $3.6&nbsp;million of debt created by work on ''Quest''.<ref name="hollywoodbankruptcy">{{cite journal | title = Rushes | date=1997-06-27 | journal = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher = BPI Communications, Inc. }}</ref> H-B hired Blur Studio to finish the second season's scenes on a ten-week production schedule.<ref name="lord" /> Blur used [[Intergraph]] hardware, and its sharp performance attracted press attention and sealed an amicable relationship with H-B.<ref name="wiregraph">{{cite journal | title = Intergraph Workstations Play Starring Role in "The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest" at Blur Studio | date=1997-02-12 | journal = [[Business Wire]] | publisher = Gale Group}}</ref><ref name="intergraph">{{cite web | title=Intergraph takes on new 'Quest' | year=1997 | author=McWilliams, James | url=http://www.htimes.com/today/access/oldfiles/quest.html | work = The Huntsville Times | archivedate=1997-07-28 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970728084643/http://www.htimes.com/today/access/oldfiles/quest.html | accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref> Both companies produced in total roughly one hundred minutes of computer animation for QuestWorld.<ref name="animag" />

==Creative direction==
The show's premise is that Dr. Quest, a famous [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenologist]], investigates mysterious occurrences and exotic locales with his son, Jonny Quest, adopted son Hadji Singh, bodyguard Race Bannon, Race's daughter Jessie, and pet bulldog Bandit.<ref name="animag" /><ref name="crowningglory" /><ref name="virgin">{{cite journal | title = Virgin Sound and Vision inks licensing agreement with Turner New Media; VSV brings Hanna-Barbera's The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest into computer age with CD-ROM | date=1996-03-18 | journal = [[Business Wire]] | publisher = Gale Group}}</ref> Peter Lawrence set the story a few years after the classic series, making Jonny and his friends teenagers.<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence aimed to use "existing, real phenomenon"<U+2014>such as the "Airstrips of [[Nazca]], the Ruins of [[Teotihuacan]] or the possible existence of [[Giant Squid]]"<U+2014>to capture audiences' curiosity.<ref name="bible" /> Stressing plausibility, he suggested writers cover real-world enigmas, [[cryptozoology]], unique locales, and fictional but "believable" mysteries.<ref name="crowningglory" /><ref name="bible" /> The Quests would frequently visit the virtual environment of QuestWorld, and encounter the villainous Jeremiah Surd and [[Ezekiel Rage]]. Paralyzed years prior by Race Bannon's SWAT team, Surd would try to exact revenge through technology. Rage<U+2014>a former government agent left for dead on a botched mission<U+2014>would try to destroy the world with nuclear terrorism. The Quests would sparingly fight "[[Villain of the week|monsters of the week]]", instead battling antagonists whose conflicts lay in "personal objective or ambition ... opposed by Dr. Quest".<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence stationed the family at a new compound on the coast of Maine, replete with houses, barns, and workshops.<ref name="bible" /> Rooms suited for each character included a library for Dr. Quest, workshop for Jonny, computer-equipped den for Jessie, dojo and gym for Race, and lighthouse lookout for Hadji's meditation.<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence equipped Dr. Quest with a fleet of air, land, and sea vehicles, including a 1940s biplane and state-of-the-art [[catamaran]] named ''Questor'' with diving bells and smaller research vessels stored in the hulls.<ref name="bible" /> Peter Lawrence prided ''Real Adventures'' on the strength of its writing, opining that "very few writers in this or any other field actually write visually," and contesting that each episode would have "enough material or potential to develop into a movie".<ref name="writingstrength">{{cite journal | title = Doing toons the write way | date=1995-09-20 | journal = [[Daily Variety]] magazine | publisher = Reed Business Information}}</ref>

===Characters===
[[File:Trajq-expeditiontokhumbu.png|thumb|Hadji, Jessie, and Jonny from the season one episode "Expedition to Khumbu"|alt=Characters Hadji Singh, Jessie Bannon, and Jonny Quest are shown with faces emphasized in an ice setting. Hadji is very tan-skinned, wearing a turban, navy blue sweater, and red suspenders. Jessie is pale-skinned with red hair and green eyes, and is wearing a blue snow-suit with pink highlights and black suspenders. Jonny has blonde hair and blue eyes, and is lightly-tanned; he's wearing a black snow-suit with red suspenders.]]
Peter Lawrence described Johnny as a "hero in training" on the cusp of adulthood.<ref name="dvdinterview" /> He remarked that Jonny possessed "a straight-ahead, right-on attitude" free of introspection or self-doubt.<ref name="bible" /><ref name="presskitfinal" /> At age 14, Jonny was a confident problem-solver prone to getting in trouble.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Writers framed him as more an intuitive thinker than an intellectual, and created tension by contrasting his father's academic leanings with Jonny's affinity for Race's daring lifestyle.<ref name="bible" /> Jonny inherited his father's driving curiosity (rendering him a "walking query"), as well as his mother's "restless, adventurous spirit".<ref name="presskitfinal" /> Takashi designed Jonny to be lean, wiry, athletic, and coordinated.<ref name="presskitfinal" /> Creative directors centered episodes around Jonny; Seibert summarized the shift:

{{cquote2|We decided to make the show more Jonny-centric. If you analyze the original show, you'll see it's really the Dr. Quest and Race show. Jonny was just hanging out<U+2014>after all, what can a 10-year-old do? He can't even ride his bike out of the neighborhood.<ref name="tvguidereview">{{cite journal | title = Family Pages: Jonny Come Lately | date=1996-08-24 | journal = [[TV Guide]] | page = 45 | volume = 44 | issue = 34}}</ref>}}

Hadji, age 16, became Dr. Quest's personal assistant, lacking his mentor's formal education but sharing his burning interest in archaeology, anthropology and the paranormal.<ref name="bible" /> A [[Sikh]] and student [[yogi]], he held a fatalistic attitude towards the show's drama, reacting to situations "from the philosophical point of view that everything is as it's supposed to be".<ref name="bible" /> Hadji often used wise aphorisms, taken from diverse cultures and sources and sometimes baffling Jonny.<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence cut Hadji's classic [[telekinesis]] to align his abilities with realistic yogi practices. "He doesn't say things like 'Sim, Sim Sala Bim' anymore," season one voice actor [[Michael Benyaer]] explained. "The writers and producers actually researched the actual yogic powers. He can do more plausible stuff. There is an episode where Hadji pretends to stop his breathing so that the bad guys think he is dead."<ref name="cinef">{{cite journal | last = Kingston | first = F. Colin | title = Older and bolder, the cartoon quester returns on Turner TV. | date=October 1996 | journal = [[Cinefantastique]] magazine | volume = 28 | issue = 3}}</ref> Takashi drew Hadji taller and thinner than his classic counterpart.<ref name="presskitfinal" /> Jessie Bannon, age 15, was characterized to be just as tough, smarter, and more thoughtful than Jonny. Written as "more of an egghead", she elected to spend time with Dr. Quest as Jonny did with Race, and was "more in tune with Hadji".<ref name="bible" /> Turner conceived Jessie as cool, independent, and a strong role model for contemporary girls.<ref name="cbgender" /> Peter Lawrence took pains to ensure Jessie would not be written as "a guy in a skirt", and made her more mature than Jonny.<ref name="dvdinterview" /><ref name="presskitfinal" />

Her father, Race Bannon (age 38), retained his classic, laconic sense of humor and fearless, dependable nature.<ref name="bible" /> He retired from government work over ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Writers noted that Race was helplessly overprotective of Jessie, and Jonny was "the boy Race never had".<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Race was also given a western-US accent and a knack for crafting elaborate, colorful similes. Peter Lawrence sculpted Race to be a "cowboy philosopher or philosopher-warrior".<ref name="dvdinterview" /> Writers tasked Race with physical and self-defense training for the Quest team.<ref name="presskitfinal" /> Dr. Benton Quest, age 55, retired from government research and operated from the "Quest Compound" on the coast of Maine.<ref name="bible" /> Driven by curiosity, he was "consulted by individuals, governments and corporations" to investigate enigmatic events.<ref name="bible" /> Described as "single-minded<U+2014>almost to the point of obsession<U+2014>in his pursuit of knowledge", he often encountered trouble as "his drive to learn blanks out more basic instincts like self-preservation."<ref name="bible" /> Jessie appreciated his ponderous sense of humor.<ref name="bible" /> The show's promoters summarized him as the "benevolent king" archetype.<ref name="presskitfinal" /> Bandit the family dog also appeared in the series. Lawrence removed Bandit's clownish origins, stressing that Bandit could not understand English, nor reliably save the family from perilous situations.<ref name="bible" /><ref name="presskitfinal" />

Summarizing the group's behavior, Lawrence wrote, "Jonny's response to danger will be close to Race's. Jessie's intrigue with mysterious, unexplained phenomena will be close to Dr. Quest's. And Hadji, with his roots in a different culture and a more spiritual approach to life, is different again." Takashi designed each character as physically fit and well-sculpted to reflect "a more exercise-oriented society".<ref name="dominionreview">{{cite journal | title = Sixties cartoon with new tech | date=1997-02-22 | journal = [[The Dominion (Wellington)|The Dominion]] National News | page = 23 | publisher = Fairfax New Zealand Limited }}</ref> Fred Seibert downplayed worries that the new characters would disappoint cult fans of the classic series.<ref name="arkansasgazettereview" /> He hoped ''Real Adventures'' would find success as new interpretations of [[comic book]] heroes had done.<ref name="animag" /><ref name="angryclassicfan">{{cite journal | last = Rollins | first = Ron | title = Seen & overheard | date=1996-10-22 | journal = [[Dayton Daily News]] | page = 3C | publisher = Cox Ohio Publishing}}</ref>

===Second season changes===
Season two directors Larry Houston and Davis Doi changed the show to resemble the classic franchise. Writer Glenn Leopold revived Hadji's latent psionic powers<U+2014>including spoon-bending and rope tricks<U+2014>as he felt the first season's realism was "not that interesting to watch".<ref name="bible" /> All characters lost a year in age; Jonny became 13.<ref name="bible" /> Writer Lance Falk returned Race to governmental guard duty, sealed by an episodic visit with classic ''Quest'' spymaster Phil Corven.<ref name="bible" /> Race lost his western accent, and Dr. Quest regained his classic red hair and exhibited rudimentary combat skills. Falk regarded Jessie as the "missing piece needed to complete the Quest family", and Leopold added slight romantic overtones to episodes.<ref name="anipla" /> Some fans complained about changes to Jessie, criticized as a [[damsel in distress]] with stereotypically female pink clothes. Jonny saved Jessie from danger several times.<ref name="genderstereotypes">{{cite web | title=Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons | author=Eick, Kelly | date=May 1998 | url=http://cla.calpoly.edu/%7Ejrubba/495/papersS98/paper1.html | publisher=California Polytechnic College of Liberal Arts | accessdate=June 19, 2007}}</ref> Falk defended his portrayal as giving her realistic, human fears, such as claustrophobia.<ref name="semifaq">{{cite web | title=Lance Falk's Semi-Official JQ:TRA FAQ | author=Falk, Lance | date=1997-08-06 | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lance_Falk%27s_Semi-Official_JQ:TRA_FAQ | publisher = QuestFan.com/wiki | accessdate=2007}}</ref> Censors asked the second season team to replace firearms with dart guns, notably in the episode "General Winter".<ref name="vostokgun">{{cite web | title=Lance Falk's Episode Commentary | author=Falk, Lance | year=1997 | url=http://questfan.com/Page/Lance_Falk's_Episode_Commentary.html | publisher = QuestFan.com/wiki | accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>
[[File:Lance Falk 2010.jpg|right|120px|thumb|Lance Falk, season two writer]]
Second season writers took greater creative liberties with ''Real Adventures'', invoking ghosts, other dimensions, and megalomaniacal schemes. Leopold and Falk sought to create a "slam-bang adventure show with real monsters" and heightened narrative emphasis on Jonny and his friends.<ref name="anipla" /><ref name="bible" /> Falk explained that cool contrivances took precedence over accuracy, stating that "''Jonny Quest'' is a show with one foot in the ''fantastic'', and one foot solidly based in reality."<ref name="anipla" /> Opposed to QuestWorld, the new team was nonetheless contractually obligated to use it in their episodes.<ref name="anipla" /> Falk felt that virtual reality undermined the show's "strong connection to reality", and suggested that after so many dangerous incidents Dr. Quest would have turned the system off.<ref name="semifaq" /> Writers brought back several classic characters, including Pasha the Peddler, Jezebel Jade, and [[Dr. Zin]].<ref name="anipla" /> Falk honored ''Quest'' creator [[Doug Wildey]] by creating an eponymous grandfather for Jonny in the episode "Nuclear Netherworld".<ref name="anipla" /> The team created Estella Velasquez as Jessie's mother to [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] the telefilms, feeling that Jade would never get married.<ref name="anipla" /> Writers eliminated villains Rage and Surd in favor of new adversaries.<ref name="anipla" /> Comparing ''Quest'' without Zin to "James Bond without S.P.E.C.T.R.E.", Falk penned a season finale featuring classic robot spies and a visceral fight between Dr. Quest and Zin.<ref name="anipla" /> Falk planned to resuscitate Palm Key as the ''Quest'' home in new episodes. Cartoon Network did not renew ''Real Adventures'', despite a pledge to explore the history of Jonny's mother Rachel in the season premiere.<ref name="anipla" />

==Cast==
The first season of ''Real Adventures'' featured [[J. D. Roth]] as Jonny, [[George Segal]] as Dr. Quest, [[Robert Patrick]] as Race, [[Jesse Douglas (actress)|Jesse Douglas]] as Jessie, and [[Michael Benyaer]] as Hadji. A childhood fan of the original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny.<ref name="cinef" /> Roth was attracted by Jonny's "star quality", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers.<ref name="roth1">{{cite web | date=1996-08-21 | author=Gray, Ellen | title=The new 'Jonny Quest' is full of ideas for children's programming | work=The News-Times | url=http://www.newstimes.com/archive/aug2196/tvf.htm | publisher=Knight-Ridder Media | archivedate=1997-04-30 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970430170024/http://www.newstimes.com/archive/aug2196/tvf.htm| accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref> He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity.<ref name="cinef" /> Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something he had tried to integrate in his personal television pilots.<ref name="roth1" /> When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, "Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special."<ref name="cinef" /> Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: "[he] is one of the few roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us."<ref name="cinef" /> A ''Star Wars'' fan, Benyaer was happy to work with [[Mark Hamill]] for "In the Realm of the Condor".<ref name="cinef" /> Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an "unusual case of multi-ethnic casting".<ref name="dvdinterview" />

The producers struggled to cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, whom he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence<U+2014>"[Jesse Douglas] has immense energy, huge energy, and is the kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do<U+2014>you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth ''[sic]''."<ref name="dvdinterview" /> Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis.<ref name="presskitfinal" /> When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard for the rest of the storyline."<ref name="cinef" /> Roth supported her, claiming that "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend."<ref name="cinef" /> H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults "there might be a [[Spencer Tracy|Tracy]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]] thing going on."<ref name="tvguidetracy">{{cite journal | last = Vered | first = Annabel | title = A heat wave of sizzling stars | date=1996-06-18 | journal = [[TV Guide]] | volume = 44 | issue = 23}}</ref> Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest.<ref name="tvzoneteam" /> Segal described the show as having "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable."<ref name="arkansasgazettereview">{{cite journal | last = Storey | first = Michael | title = 'Jonny Quest' returns in enlightened form | date=1996-07-30 | journal = [[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] | page = Style 3E | publisher = WEHCO Media, Inc. }}</ref> Hanna-Barbera bought out the first cast's contracts and hired new actors for the second season. This cast featured [[Quinton Flynn]] as Jonny, [[John de Lancie]] as Dr. Quest, [[Granville Van Dusen]] (for the first two episodes) and [[Robert Foxworth]] as Race, [[Jennifer Hale]] as Jessie, and [[Rob Paulsen]] as Hadji.<ref name="anipla" /> Paulsen previously voiced Hadji in the two ''Quest'' telefilms.<ref name="paulsen">{{cite web | title=IMDb: Rob Paulsen | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0667326/ | work=IMDB.com | publisher=Internet Movie Database Inc. | accessdate=June 19, 2007}}</ref> [[Don Messick]] attempted to reprise his classic role as Dr. Quest, but was forced into retirement by a stroke during early sessions. Van Dusen voiced Bannon in the 1986 ''Quest'' series, and Foxworth took over the part after auditioning for Dr. Quest.<ref name="anipla" />

Virgin estimated the game would provide 20<U+2013>25&nbsp;hours of game play for adults and 80<U+2013>100&nbsp;hours for children.<ref name="hollywoodreporterroswell" /> The season two cast provided all voices except for Michael Benyaer as Hadji and Charles Howerton as Dr. Quest.

==Critical reception==
Announcement of Jessie Bannon's inclusion caused backlash among ''Quest'' fans. ''TV Guide'''s editors feared that Jonny and Jessie would become romantically entangled, declaring her an "icky female".<ref name="jessieresponse">{{cite journal | last = Eldredge | first = Richard L. | title = Unionites have `Reason' to patronize bookstores | date=1995-08-13 | journal = [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | page = M2}}</ref> H-B Chief Fred Seibert responded, "Jessie is a little older and smarter than Jonny... We're not doing ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' here."<ref name="jessieresponse" /> Seibert also denied that Jessie had been created solely to appeal to little girls, citing extant support for Jonny and the classic team.<ref name="newsdayblessing" /> A ''Miami Herald'' columnist called Jessie an "effort to rewrite the past to conform to the sociopolitical mandates of the present" and [[political correctness]] "run amok".<ref name="ickymale">{{cite journal | last = Pitts | first = Leonard | title = Jonny Quest's new 'icky female' proves PC has gone way too far | date=1995-08-05 | journal = The [[Miami Herald]] | page = 1G}}</ref> ''Billboard'' conversely welcomed the change over an all-male cast.<ref name="marketing" /> The fiasco subsided after the ''Cyber Insects'' telefilm aired; the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' rebuffed the "icky girl" label, as Jessie saved Jonny's life and taught him patience.<ref name="ickyfemale">{{cite journal | last = Eldredge | first = Richard L. | title = Sunday Buzz: Ex-Beatle's publicist having Best of times | date=1995-11-12 | journal = [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | page = M2}}</ref> A test screening of ''Cyber Insects'' to {{nowrap|30- to 35-year-old}} males revealed that though some questioned her addition, most understood that like certain elements criticized in the original series, it was a reflection of the times.<ref name="ickyfemale" /> Some fans still took issue with the series' distance from classic ''Quest'', which suffered accusations of cultural insensitivity and "racial and sexual stereotypes".<ref name="washingtonpostfight1">{{cite journal | last = Iverem | first = Esther | title = The real villains of 'Jonny Quest' | date=1996-05-29 | journal = [[The Washington Post]] | page = Style F01}}</ref><ref name="washingtonpostfight2">{{cite journal | last = Jones | first = Garry | title = 'Quest' for political correctness | date=1996-06-08 | journal = [[The Washington Post]] | page = A13}}</ref>

''Real Adventures'' evoked critical comparisons to the original series. ''Cinefantastique'' felt ''Real Adventures'' remained true to the classic show's formula, and praised the "impressive" cast.<ref name="cinef" /> Another critic recommended the show to "die-hard adult fans", affirming that ''Real Adventures'' maintained the violence and off-screen deaths of the old series, as even the opening titles featured "explosions, murder and mayhem".<ref name="akron" /> ''The Washington Post'' judged the first season as "grittier and more lifelike" than the original ''Quest''.<ref name="poster">{{cite journal | last = Moore | first = Scott | title = New fall series for kids: A season of plenty | date=1996-10-03 | journal = [[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> ''Chicago Tribune'' critic Allan Johnson agreed that ''Real Adventures'' was less "way-out" and contrasted the shows in detail.<ref name="chicagotribune">{{cite journal | last = Johnson | first = Allan | title = Jonny Quest' gets pumped: '60s 'toon is more in your face for the '90s | date=1996-08-13 | journal = [[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> ''TV Guide'' applauded the writing as "miles deeper and darker than on the old show"; Hadji's quotations impressed the magazine's reviewer.<ref name="tvguidereview" /> Chicago's ''Daily Herald'' called the first episode "vintage ''Quest''", and ''The Panama City Times-Herald'' echoed this position:<ref name="dailyheraldrevue" />

Critics debated the success of the show's premise. Peter Scisco of ''ComputerLife'' appreciated that the team "rely on their brains, not mutant superpowers".<ref name="computerliferoswell" /> ''People'' praised Turner's shift from the "politically correct claptrap" of ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers]]'', giving ''Real Adventures'' a B grade as "children's programming the way it oughta be".<ref name="peoplereview" /> The authors of 1998's ''Saturday Morning Fever'' contrarily felt the show lacked "the sense of why the original was so successful".<ref name="satfever">{{cite book | last = Burke | first = Timothy | coauthors = Kevin Burke | title = Saturday Morning Fever | publisher = St. Martin's Press | date = 1998-12-15 | pages = 114<U+2013>115 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=NA7TxrK6FkcC&dq | isbn=0312169965}}</ref> They disliked H-B's packaging of disparate seasons as one series, preferring the second for its characters and classic references.<ref name="satfever" /> Greg Aaron of ''HotWired'' praised the franchise's return but warned against QuestWorld hype, arguing that "it will take more than visual sophistication to hook today's viewers".<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Hanna-Barbera founder Joseph Barbera considered ''Real Adventures'' a "disaster" because of changes to the characters and stories.<ref name="barbera">{{cite journal | last = Evenson | first = Laura | title = "Yabba Dabba Do!"

Everybody needs to do their own thing."<ref name="barbera" /> Critics generally enjoyed the characters and voice acting. ''People'' liked the cast, particularly George Segal.<ref name="peoplereview">{{cite journal | last = Queenan | first = Joe | title = The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest | date=1996-09-02 | journal = [[People (magazine)|People]] magazine | volume = 46 | issue = 10}}</ref> ''Saturday Morning Fever'' praised Jessie Bannon for her resemblance to Dr. Quest.<ref name="satfever" /> Allan Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now old enough to be part of the action.<ref name="chicagotribune" /> He considered Jessie "cool... she gives Jonny grief just because she can, and she's not afraid of the action."<ref name="chicagotribune" /> He did not enjoy the "toned down" portrayal of Race Bannon.<ref name="chicagotribune" /> Some fans objected to Race's Western accent in the first season. Peter Lawrence defended the portrayal of Race as a "man of action, not thought<U+2014>though perfectly capable of deep thought", noting that his accent and mannerisms encouraged variety, surprise, and originality.<ref name="dvdinterview" />

The quality of ''Quest''{{'}}s traditional and computer animation split critics. The ''Toronto Star'' scathingly criticized the show for "facile plots heavily laced with jarring science fiction and incongruous computer animation", naming QuestWorld a "poorly explained techno-gimmick."<ref name="torontostar">{{cite journal | last = Mietkiewicz | first = Henry | title = Animated fool's gold on YTV New series feature cartoons that try to capitalize on fairly recent fads | date=1996-08-28 | journal = [[Toronto Star]] | page = B1 | publisher = Toronto Star Newspapers Limited}}</ref> ''[[Le Figaro]]'' concurred, but praised QuestWorld for capturing the attention of young viewers.<ref name="lefigaro">{{cite journal | title = Jeunesse; France 2 veut s<U+00E9>duire les 11<U+2013>14 ans | date=1997-04-02 | last1 = Latil | first1 = Sophie | last2 = Delcroix | first2 = Olivier | journal = Le Figaro }}</ref> ''The Star'' praised QuestWorld, but regarded traditional sequences as "flat and textureless, with minimal characterization, unnaturally stiff movement, and poor execution of shading and shadow".<ref name="torontostar" /> Ted Cox of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald]]'' agreed that animated motion was sometimes "remarkably uneven", but lauded realistic imagery like "the play of light on the ocean".<ref name="dailyheraldrevue" /> ''TV Guide'' also found the animation somewhat flat, but considered the sound effects and backgrounds to be state-of-the-art.<ref name="tvguidereview" /> The show's sound was warmly received by the industry. Episodes "Nuclear Netherworld" and "Alien in Washington" were nominated respectively for music and sound editing [[Golden Reel Award]]s in 1997, and the entire series was nominated for an animated sound editing Golden Reel Award in 1998.<ref name="hollywoodgoldenreel">{{cite journal | title = Golden Reel noms in Hallmark cards. | date=1997-03-05 | last = DiOrio | first = Carl | journal = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher = BPI Communications, Inc. }}</ref><ref name="hollywoodgoldenreel2">{{cite journal | title = Shining list of TV sound noms. | date=1998-02-20 | last = DiOrio | first = Carl | journal = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher = BPI Communications, Inc. }}</ref> ''Real Adventures'' was also nominated for a 1997 [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for music direction and composition.<ref name="daytimeemmy">{{cite journal | title = Daytime Emmy Nominations | date=1997-04-03 | journal = [[Daily Variety]] magazine | publisher = Reed Business Information }}</ref>

Special effects director Alberto Menache criticized QuestWorld in ''Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games'', considering it a mistake-laden failure.<ref name="capturecrit">{{cite book | last = Menache | first = Alberto | title = Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | date = October 1999 | pages = 52<U+2013>53 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9njZ482OYfwC&dq | isbn=0124906303}}</ref> He explained that the size difference between the motion capturers and the characters caused unsteady animation and shaking, consequently mismatching interaction with props and uneven terrain.<ref name="capturecrit" /> Menache blamed the show's budget, which did not allow for digital post-production and review; producers instead expected "plug-and-play" results straight from the capture studio.<ref name="capturecrit" /> Menache concluded that the QuestWorld sequences suffered from a "pipeline set up for mass production" with little testing or advance planning.<ref name="capturecrit" /> ''Quest''{{'}}s Senior Vice President of Production Sherry Gunther admitted that the motion capture technology was "a little crude" and best suited for broad movements.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Menache was less critical of the facial capture, considering it "medium-quality" but still unacceptable given H-B's resources.<ref name="capturecrit" /> These criticisms mirrored the comments of Buzz F/X animator Francois Lord, who cited inexperienced Montreal animators and rushed production schedules.<ref name="lord" /> He pointed out that Blur Studios had more time, money, and experience for season two's sequences.<ref name="lord" />
