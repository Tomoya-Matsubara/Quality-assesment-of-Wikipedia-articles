'''''Nemophila''''' is a [[genus]] found in the flowering plant family ''[[Hydrophyllaceae]]''.

Most of the species in ''Nemophila'' contain the phrase "baby blue-eyes" in their common names. ''N. menziesii'' has the common name of "Baby blue-eyes". ''N. parviflora'' is called the "Smallflower baby blue-eyes" and ''N. spatulata'' is called the "Sierra baby blue-eyes". An exception to this naming tendency is ''N. maculata'', whose common name is [[Fivespot]].

''Nemophila'' species are mainly native to the western [[United States]], though some species are also found in western [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]], and in the southeastern [[United States]].

''Nemophila'' are commonly offered for sale for [[gardening|garden]] cultivation. Generally these are ''N. menziesii''.

== Description ==
All species of ''Nemophila'' are [[Annual plant|annual]]s, and most bloom in the spring. Their [[flower]]s have five petals and are bell or cup-shaped, and purple, blue, or white in color, often spotted or marked. The stamens are included and there is only one ovary chamber.

The leaves are simple, with an opposite or alternate arrangement. The petiole is generally bristly. The leaf blade is pinnately toothed or lobed.

The fruit is 2-7 mm wide and generally enclosed by the calyx. The fruit itself is spherical to ovoid in shape. It is also hairy.

The seeds are ovoid, smooth, wrinkled or pitted. At one end there is a colorless, conic appendage.

==Occurrence==
Some of the species of ''Nemophila'' are of restricted range. For example, ''Nemophila menziesii'' has been observed only in western North America, but chiefly in California.<ref>Calflora, ''Nemophila menziesii'' [http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=5836]</ref> ''Nemophila heterophylla'' occurs in a more restricted range within northern and central Califonia (with some proximate state populations); ''N. heterophylla'' has the greatest number of sightings [[Marin County]] at locations such as [[Ring Mountain (California)|Ring Mountain]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008) ''Ring Mountain'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=19244]</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Nemophila'' means <U+201C>woodland-loving.<U+201D> It comes from the Greek word ''nemos'', which means "grove" and the Greek word ''philia'', which means "loving".
