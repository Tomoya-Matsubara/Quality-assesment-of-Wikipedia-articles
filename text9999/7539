[[Image:NOoK-example.png|thumb|Seven words written in New Orthography. The standard spellings are <U+B189><U+B2C8><U+B2E4>, <U+D758><U+B800><U+B2E4>, <U+AE68><U+B2EC><U+C73C><U+B2C8>, <U+C9C0><U+C5B4>, <U+ACE0><U+C640>, <U+C655>, and <U+AC00><U+C838><U+C11C>.]]


The '''''New Orthography for the Korean Language''''' was a [[spelling reform]] used in [[North Korea]] from 1948<U+2013>1954. It added five consonants and one vowel letter to the [[hangul]] alphabet, making it a perfect [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] fit to the [[Korean language]]. 

The reason for the reform is that some Korean roots change form and therefore cannot be written with a consistent spelling using standard hangul. The additional letters introduced in the ''New Orthography'' do not represent new sounds, but these situations where a sound changes, say from a /p/ to a /w/. Three were created ''de novo'' by modifying existing letters, two (<U+317F> and <U+3186>) were obsolete letters, and one (1) is a numeral. 

For example, the root of the verb "to walk" has the form <U+AC77> ''geod'' before a consonant, as in the inflection <U+AC77><U+B2E4> ''geotta,'' but the form <U+AC78> ''geol'' before a vowel, as in <U+AC78><U+C5B4> ''georeo'' and <U+AC78><U+C73C><U+B2C8> ''georeuni.'' In ''New Orthography,'' the root is invariable, spelled with the new letter <U+317F> in place of both the <U+3137> in <U+AC77> and the <U+3139> in <U+AC78>. (This is not shown due to lack of unicode support.)

#For convenience they are also called <U+C5EC><U+B9B0><U+B9AC><U+C744>, <U+B41C><U+B9AC><U+C744>, <U+BC18><U+C2DC><U+C74F>, <U+C5EC><U+B9B0><U+D788><U+C757>, <U+C704><U+C74D>, and <U+C5EC><U+B9B0><U+C774>.
#Also called <U+C8FD><U+B294><U+3139>(<U+C8FD><U+B294><U+B9AC><U+C744>) "silencing <U+3139>".
#Silence.
#In standard orthography, combines with a following vowel as <U+3158>, <U+3159>, <U+315A>, <U+315D>, <U+315E>, <U+315F>
#In standard orthography, combines with a following vowel as <U+3151>, <U+3152>, <U+3155>, <U+3156>, <U+315B>, <U+3160>

The ''New Orthography'' also added two new [[digraph]]s to the lexicon, <U+316D> ''{{IPA|l<U+0294>}}'' and <U+11EC> ''{{IPA|<U+014B>k}}''.

There were other changes that made the orthography more morphemic, without requiring the addition of new letters. For example, in the word normally spelled <U+B189><U+B2C8><U+B2E4> (top example in image at right), the morpheme <U+3142> is separated out in its own block. Such spellings can be found in medieval documents, but weren't normally seen in the 20th century.
