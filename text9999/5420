Rabbi '''Elchonon Wasserman''' ([[1875]]-[[1941]]) ([[Hebrew]]: '''<U+05D0><U+05DC><U+05D7><U+05E0><U+05DF> <U+05D5><U+05E1><U+05E8><U+05DE><U+05DF>''') was a prominent [[Rabbi]] and [[Rosh Yeshiva]] in pre-[[World War II]] Europe. He was one of the [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Chofetz Chaim]]'s closest disciples and a [[Torah]] scholar of note, and well known for being a strong opponent of all forms of [[Zionism]].

==Biography==

Rabbi Wasserman was born in [[Birz]], [[Lithuania]]. He studied in the [[Telz yeshiva|Telshe Yeshiva]] in [[Telz]], [[Poland]] under Rabbi [[Eliezer Gordon]] and Rabbi [[Shimon Shkop]] and also at [[Volozhin yeshiva|Volozhin]]. Thereafter, he studied under Rabbi [[Chaim Soloveitchik]] in [[Brest-Litovsk|Brisk]]. 

He was appointed head of the [[Yeshiva]] of [[Amtshilov]], where he won a reputation as an outstanding teacher.  In 1907, after his marriage, he studied in the ''Kollel Kodshim'' in [[Radin]], [[Russia]], headed by the Chofetz Chaim. In 1910 he was appointed Rabbi of Brisk (now in [[Belarus]]), but during [[World War I]] returned to Radin.

The yeshiva moved to [[Smilovichi]] and Rabbi Wasserman was appointed its [[Rosh Yeshiva]]. After the War, he moved to [[Baranowicze]], Poland (now in Belarus) where he founded a yeshiva which became one of the most famous in Europe. He was one of the leaders of the [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]] movement and was regarded as the spiritual successor of the Chofetz Chaim.

Rabbi Wasserman had several sons. Rabbi [[Simcha Wasserman]] served as Dean of Yeshiva ''Beth Yehudah'' in [[Detroit]] in the 1940's, founded Yeshiva ''Ohr Elchonon'' in [[California]] in the 1950's, and later founded Yeshiva ''Ohr Elchonon'' in [[Jerusalem]]. Rabbi Wasserman's other sons were Naftoli and Dovid.

When World War II broke out Rabbi Wasserman fled to [[Vilnius|Vilna]], Lithuania, and in 1941, while on a visit to [[Kovno]], was arrested by the Nazis with 12 other rabbis and sent to his death.

==Murder by Nazis==

Rabbi Elchonon was taken and murdered by the [[Lithuanians]] on the 12th of [[Tammuz]], [[1941]]. Before he was taken he gave this statement: "In Heaven it appears that they deem us to be righteous because our bodies have been chosen to atone for the [[Jew]]ish people. Therefore, we must repent now, immediately. There is not much time. We must keep in mind that we will be better [[Korban#Martyrs as korbanot|offerings]] if we repent. In this way we will save the lives of our brethren overseas."

"Let no thought enter our minds, God forbid, which is abominable and which renders an offering unfit. We are now fulfilling the greatest [[mitzvah]]. With fire she ([[Jerusalem]]) was destroyed and with fire she will be rebuilt. The very fire which consumes our bodies will one day rebuild the Jewish people."

==Works==
Rabbi Wasserman was famous for his clear, penetrating [[Talmud|Talmudic analysis]]. His popular works, essential material in yeshivos around the world, include:
*''Kovetz Heoros''
*''Kovetz Shiurim''
*''Kovetz Maamarim''

He also wrote ''Ikvasa di-Meshicha'' and published the responsa of the [[Rashba]] with annotations in 1932. His talmudic novellae appeared in the rabbinic journal Sha'arei Tzion (1929<U+2013>34) and in other publications.

After the [[1929 Hebron massacre]], Rabbi Wasserman wrote an analysis in which he considered the Zionists ultimately responsible for the murder of 66 unarmed yeshiva students by Arab mobs. <ref>[http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/rabbi_quotes/WhoHasDestroyedMore.pdf] "Who Has Destroyed More, the Arabs or the Zionists?", by Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman (PDF file)</ref>
