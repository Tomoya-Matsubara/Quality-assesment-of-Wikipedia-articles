The popularity of the [[first-person shooter]] [[computer game]] ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' has resulted in a large number of '''spin-offs and homages'''.

==Spin-offs==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Doom-comic.jpg|thumb|right|The Doom comic.]] -->
A [[Doom novels|set of four novels]] based on ''Doom'' were written with permission of [[id Software]] by [[Dafydd Ab Hugh]] and [[Brad Linaweaver]]. The books, listed in order, are titled ''Knee Deep in the Dead'', ''Hell on Earth'', ''Infernal Sky'' and ''Endgame''. All were published between June [[1995]] and January [[1996]] by [[Pocket Books]]. Some in the Doom community started calling the unnamed marine in the games "Flynn Taggart", after the main character of the novels, at least for a time. The first two books featured recognizable locations and situations from the first two games.

Additionally, a comic book was issued in May [[1996]], produced by Tom Grindberg of [[Marvel Comics]] as a giveaway for a video game convention, and  original art from that project was put up for auction on [[eBay]] in April of [[2004]]. It was criticized for ridiculous dialogue and a poor story, as well as erroneous representations of some weapons from the game. In September of [[2005]], a member of the Doom community released an unofficial "dramatic rendition" of the lines from the comic, with music and sound effects, for comedic effect. Notable lines include "Now I'm [[radioactive]]! That can't be good!", "Sweet Christmas! Big-mouthed floating thingies! It's always something!", and (pictured below) the infamous "Rip and tear your guts! You are huge! That means you have huge guts!".

On [[January 31]] of [[2005]], a [[board games|board game]] resembling the classic [[Space Hulk]] was released, entitled  ''[[Doom: The Board Game]]''. [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/doomproducts.html]

There is also a [[Doom (film)|movie based on ''Doom'']].

===In games===
*In ''[[Jazz Jackrabbit 2]]'', in the episode-selection screen, the player is allowed to try the shareware demo of the game. The episode screen is a parody of the ''Doom II'' box-art and even the text "Shareware Demo" is written using the ''Doom'' font. This is ironic since the game was released by Epic, the creator of ''[[Unreal]]'' and the biggest competitor of id's ''Quake'' franchise. 

*''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' contains a reference to ''Doom'': a slaughtered "Doom Guy" that causes Duke to say "Hmmmm, that's one Doomed space marine".

*''[[Quake 3]]'' features the [[Doomguy]] as a playable character - he is referred to simply as "Doom". The same model, with a different skin, is used for the character "Phobos".

*The PC release of ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3]]'' features the Doomguy as a secret skater.

*Numerous unofficial maps have been made by players of newer games that recreate maps from ''Doom'' and ''Doom II''.

*The PC game ''[[Muppets Inside]]'' features a ''Doom'' parody starring the [[Swedish Chef]] taking on giant killer vegetables with various kitchenware.

*In the Simpsons game ''[[Virtual Springfield]]'' there is a minigame with a parody of ''Doom'' in which Apu fights off squishee-throwing bullies in his shop with a broom, shotgun and a weapon similar the BFG, causing them to explode in a bloody mess (but, for some reason, ending the game and supposedly killing the in-game Apu).

===In fiction===
*''Doom'', as well as ''Labyrinth of Death'' (<U+041B><U+0430><U+0431><U+0438><U+0440><U+0438><U+043D><U+0442> <U+0421><U+043C><U+0435><U+0440><U+0442><U+0438>), a fictional [[virtual reality]] multiplayer game inspired by ''Doom'' ideas and images, is extensively featured in the "Labyrinth of Reflections" trilogy by [[Russia]]n author [[Sergey Lukyanenko]].

*In a [[Simpsons Comics|Simpsons Comic]], [[Homer Goes to College|the nerds from Springfield University]] become rich after a computer game resembling ''Doom'' (but with Homer as the marine) is accidentally uploaded onto the Internet by Bart. The nerds reveal that the game was unfinished, and that they were going to add fantasy creatures, [[Computer role-playing game#Character development|character progression]] and a plot.

===In television===
*''[[Friends]]:'' In an early episode, Chandler suggests playing Doom while using his laptop help Ross decide between Julie or Rachel.

*''[[The Simpsons]]:'' In an episode, Homer is in a career consultant's office and the consultant is playing ''Doom''.

*The game was shown briefly during an episode of [[Family Guy]] (Season 4B, Episode 4, ''"[[PTV (Family Guy episode)|PTV]]"''). The opening credits for this show were done in the style of [[Police Squad!]], with [[Stewie Griffin]] driving his with [[Big Wheel]] through various pop culture references. During this sequence, Stewie drives through the fifth level of ''Doom'' and rams an Imp, killing it.

*''[[Mystery Science Theatre 3000]]:'' [[Michael J Nelson|Mike]] explains that in his job all he did was play Doom. In a commercial for the episode "The Starfighters", Crow and Mike are playing Doom as Tom Servo introduces the next episode.

*Various movies & TV shows (mostly ones produced in the early 90's) use sound effects that were used in Doom. This is because some of Doom's sounds were acquired from a public commercial sound library.

===In movies===
*''[[Naqoyqatsi]]:'' One hour and eleven minutes into the film, a video clip from the game is shown.
*''[[Wild Hogs]]:'' When the police officer is describing how he acquired his badge over the internet, he says "for firearms training, they just told us to play Doom". After the large battle at the end of the film, he also says "wow, that was like, level twelve of Doom".
*''[[Grosse Point Blank]]:'' A fictional Doom 2 arcade machine is featured in the film.
*''[[Congo]]:'' A screensaver of Doom can be seen playing on a computer at the very beginning.

===In music===
* The Classic Doom Mod for Doom 3 [http://cdoom.d3files.com/] includes a remake of the soundtrack of the first episode of Doom 1. [http://files.filefront.com/Classic+DOOM+3+Original+Mod+Soundtrack/;4526906;/fileinfo.html] The remake, made by Sonic Clang and Thumpmonk, features live guitars and drums combined with synthesis.

*''[[OverClocked ReMix#Projects|The Dark Side of Phobos]]'' is a collection of [[arrangement]]s from the game's soundtrack.

*[[The Smashing Pumpkins]] credit [[id Software]] for the ''Doom'' rocket launcher sound effect which is used as a sample on the song "Where Boys Fear to Tread" off the album [[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]. This sound effect points to the relationship between ''Doom'' and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] in the [[SPISPOPD]] joke.

*Finnish [[grindcore]] band [[Rotten Sound]]'s album ''Murderworks'' has a song called "Doom", in which on the beginning it's possible to hear some Doom sound effects, like monsters yelling and weapons shooting.

* The song ''Wollt ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen?'' <span style="font-size:10px;">(English: ''Do you want to see the bed in flames?'')</span> by [[Rammstein]] samples the [[Doomguy]]'s dying scream and shotgun reloading sounds.

* Lemon Demon's song "Bad idea" features death sounds of zombies and demons in the song. Additionally, teleporting, rocket flying and super shotgun sounds are used.
