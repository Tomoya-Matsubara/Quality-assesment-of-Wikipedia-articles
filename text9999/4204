Clifford's first professional London performance was in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s opera ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' in 1930, in a production arranged and conducted by [[Gervase Hughes]].<ref>Blom, Eric. "London Opera Festival", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 7 January 1930, p. 6</ref> In 1933 he played Constable in Vaughan Williams's ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'', conducted by [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]].<ref>"Hugh The Drover", ''The Times'', 17 June 1933, p. 10</ref> During the early 1930s he toured with the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]], with whom his roles included Tonio in ''[[Pagliacci]]'', Alberich in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', Dr. Miracle in ''[[The Tales of Hoffman]]'' and the title part in ''[[Rigoletto]]'', in which the anonymous critic in ''[[The Observer]]'' judged that he sang well but slightly over-acted.<ref>"Music of the Week: Carl Rosa", ''The Observer'', 5 June 1932, p. 14</ref>

M. Gordon]], who had worked with [[W.S. Gilbert]], but Carte encouraged Clifford to recreate all his characters afresh.<ref name=burgess/> ''[[The Times]]'' said of his performance in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', "the final moments in which the heartbroken merryman struggles to hide his grief are played with real beauty. Mr Clifford makes no attempt to imitate his predecessors in the part, and his performance gains immensely as a result."<ref>"Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 19 June 1940, p. 6</ref> The ''Times'' critic, who had seen the original cast of ''[[The Mikado]]'', considered Clifford "second to none" as Ko-Ko.<ref>"Princes Theatre", ''The Times'', 23 June 1942, p. 2</ref>
