'''SummerSlam (1994)''' was the seventh annual [[SummerSlam]], a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] event produced by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) on August 29, 1994 at the newly opened [[United Center]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], which had opened eleven days earlier.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction|work=United Center|url=http://www.unitedcenter.com/unitedcenter/arenainfo.asp|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>

The pay-per-view had two main events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/1994/mainevent|title=SummerSlam 1994: Main Event|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}</ref> The first featured [[Owen Hart]] fighting his brother [[Bret Hart]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]].

The [[Card (sports)#Undercard|undercard]] featured a match for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] between [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] and [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]], which Ramon won to regain the title.<ref name=pwhistory/> The other major [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] going into SummerSlam was a feud in which [[Chris Chavis|Tatanka]] accused [[Lex Luger]] of joining the [[Million Dollar Corporation]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] of [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] wrestlers.<ref name=rawjune25/> This storyline turned out to be a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Swerve|swerve]], as Tatanka was revealed to have secretly joined the corporation.<ref name=toaslam/>

==Background==
[[Savio Vega|Kwang]] and [[Bryan Clark|Adam Bomb]] were both [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by [[David Lauer|Harvey Wippleman]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Manager Profiles: Harvery Wippleman|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/harvey-wippleman.html|accessdate=2008-03-16}}</ref> On May 28, 1994, a [[King of the Ring]] qualifying match between Bomb and the [[Sean Waltman|1<U+2013>2<U+2013>3 Kid]] was televised on ''WWF Superstars''.

One of the WWF's main storylines in 1994 was [[Ted DiBiase]]'s creation of a stable known as the [[Million Dollar Corporation]]. That summer, DiBiase purchased the rights to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]'s contract from Bigelow's [[kayfabe]] girlfriend, [[Gertrude Vachon|Luna Vachon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Bam Bam Bigelow|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bam-bam-bigelow.html|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R.

After deactivating the [[WWE Women's Championship|WWF Women's Championship]] in 1990, the WWF brought the title back in late 1993. The WWF [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushed]] [[Debra Miceli|Alundra Blayze]], having her win the tournament to become champion and defeat all challengers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alundra Blayze's first reign|work=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/30445413212111214|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> Luna Vachon was brought in to challenge Blayze in a series of matches but was defeated each time.<ref name=history/> The storyline then saw Vachon bring in [[Keiko Nakano|Bull Nakano]], a Japanese female wrestler, to gain revenge and challenge Blayze.<ref name=nakano>{{cite web|title=Women's Wrestler Profiles: Bull Nakano|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bull-nakano.html|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref>

On the July 11, 1994 edition of ''Monday Night Raw'', a major [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|worked]] storyline began when Ted DiBiase announced that he had convinced [[Lex Luger]] to join the Million Dollar Corporation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monday Night Raw: July 11, 1994|work=The Other Arena|url=http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw071194 |accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030610151815/http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw071194 |archivedate = 2003-06-10}}</ref> Leading up to the pay-per-view, [[Chris Chavis|Tatanka]] confronted Lex Luger on several occasions, criticizing him for "selling out" to DiBiase.<ref name=rawjune25>{{cite web|title=Monday Night Raw: July 25, 1994|work=The Other Arena|url=http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw072594 |accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030610141048/http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw072594 |archivedate = 2003-06-10}}</ref> This led to a [[kayfabe]] admission from Luger that he had met with DiBiase, but Luger repeatedly denied having joined the corporation.<ref name=toaaug8/> He agreed to face Tatanka at SummerSlam to settle the argument.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monday Night Raw: August 1, 1994|work=The Other Arena|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw080194 |accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030530110009/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw080194 |archivedate = 2003-05-30}}</ref>

[[Jeff Jarrett]] and [[Nelson Frazier, Jr.|Mabel]] had no real feud going into SummerSlam. Jarrett played the role of an aspiring country music singer, and Mabel portrayed a [[rapping|rapper]]. As a result, the WWF promoted the match as part of a "rap versus country" rivalry.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=SummerSlam 1994 Preview|journal=World Wrestling Federation Magazine|date=September 1994|pages=31|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> There was little buildup for the match until Mabel was booked to confront Jarrett on ''Monday Night Raw'' the week before SummerSlam. He tried to provoke Jarrett into a fight, but Jarrett walked away through the crowd to avoid Mabel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monday Night Raw: August 15, 1994|work=The Other Arena|url=http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw081594 |accessdate=2007-11-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030610140717/http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw081594 |archivedate = 2003-06-10}}</ref>
