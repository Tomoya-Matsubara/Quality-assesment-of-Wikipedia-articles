{{Not to be confused with|Stourbridge Railroad|Stourbridge Town Branch Line}}
The '''Stourbridge Railway''' was a small independent railway company in [[England]] which existed between [[1860 in the United Kingdom|1860]], and [[1870 in the United Kingdom|1870]] when it was taken over by the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR). The company built a line from the [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway]] (OWWR) at {{rws|Stourbridge Junction}} to [[Smethwick]], where it joined the [[Stour Valley Line]] at Galton Junction.

==History==
===Opening===
The act incorporating the company was passed on 14 June 1860, allowing it to build a three and a half mile long line from Stourbridge Junction to {{rws|Old Hill}}, another act was passed the following year to allow it to reach the Stour Valley Line at Smethwick. The route was open in full by 1 April 1867. 

===GWR link===
The OWWR had come under the control of the GWR by this time, and so the GWR constructed a link from Smethwick to [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]], which was opened at the same time, to connect it to the GWR's [[Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton Low Level Line]]. The running of the line was also taken over by the GWR. 

===Merger with the GWR===
The Stourbridge Railway was formally merged with the GWR in 1870 after it emerged that the company's director W. T. Adcock had fraudulently issued stock.

==The route today==
The line still functions today as part of the [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line]].
