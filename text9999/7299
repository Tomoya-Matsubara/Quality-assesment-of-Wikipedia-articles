'''Chaco Culture National Historical Park''' is a United States [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historical Park]] hosting the densest and most exceptional concentration of [[pueblo]]s in the [[American Southwest]]. The park is located in northwestern New Mexico, between [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Farmington, New Mexico|Farmington]], in a remote canyon cut by the [[Chaco Wash]]. Containing the most sweeping collection of ancient ruins north of Mexico, the park preserves one of the United States' most important [[precolumbian]] cultural and historic areas.<ref name="Strutin_1994_6"/>

Between AD 900 and 1150, Chaco Canyon was a major center of culture for the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]].{{cref|<U+03B1>}} Chacoans quarried sandstone blocks and hauled timber from great distances, assembling 15 major complexes which remained the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century.<ref name="Strutin_1994_6">{{harvnb|Strutin|1994|p=6}}</ref><ref name="Fagan_2005_35"/> Evidence of [[archaeoastronomy]] at Chaco has been proposed, with the Sun Dagger petroglyph at [[Fajada Butte]] a popular example.

Composing a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] located in the arid and sparsely populated [[Four Corners]] region, the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile; fears of erosion caused by tourists have led to the closure of Fajada Butte to the public. The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by the [[Hopi]] and [[Pueblo people]], who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land.<ref name="NPS_2007"/><ref name="Sofaer_1999"/> Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.<ref name="NPS_2007"/>

== Geography ==

Chaco Canyon lies within the [[San Juan Basin]], atop the vast [[Colorado Plateau]], surrounded by the [[Chuska Mountains]] in the west, the [[San Juan Mountains]] to the north, and the [[San Pedro Mountains]] in the east. Ancient Chacoans drew upon dense forests of [[oak]], [[pinyon pine|pi<U+00F1>on]], [[Ponderosa Pine|ponderosa pine]], and [[juniper]] to obtain timber and other resources. The canyon itself, located within lowlands circumscribed by dune fields, ridges, and mountains, runs in a roughly northwest-to-southeast direction and is rimmed by flat massifs known as ''[[mesa]]s''. Large gaps between the southwestern cliff faces<U+2014>side canyons known as ''rincons''<U+2014>were critical in funneling rain-bearing storms into the canyon and boosting local precipitation levels.<ref name="Fagan_2000_5">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=5}}</ref> The principal Chacoan complexes, such as [[Pueblo Bonito]], [[Nuevo Alto]], and [[Kin Kletso]], have elevations of {{convert|6200|to|6440|ft|sigfig=3}}.

The [[alluvium|alluvial]] canyon floor slopes downward to the northeast at a gentle grade of {{convert|30|ft|m}} per mile (6&nbsp;meters per kilometer); it is bisected by the [[Chaco Wash]], an ''[[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]'' that rarely bears water. Of the canyon's [[aquifer]]s, the largest are located at a depth that precluded ancient Chacoans from drawing groundwater: only several smaller, shallower sources supported the small springs that sustained them.<ref name="Fagan_2000_43">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=43}}</ref> Aside from occasional storm runoff coursing through arroyos, significant surface water is virtually non-existent.

== Geology ==

After the [[Pangaea]]n supercontinent sundered during the [[Cretaceous]] [[period (geology)|period]], the region became part of a shifting transition zone between a shallow inland sea<U+2014>the [[Western Interior Seaway]]<U+2014>and a band of plains and low hills to the west. A sandy and swampy coastline oscillated east and west, alternately submerging and uncovering the area atop the present Colorado Plateau that Chaco Canyon now occupies.<ref name="Hopkins_2002_240"/>

As the Chaco Wash flowed across the upper strata of what is now the {{convert|400|ft|adj=on}} [[Chacra Mesa]], it cut into it, gouging out a broad canyon over the course of millions of years. The mesa comprises [[sandstone]] and [[shale]] formations dating from the [[Late Cretaceous]],<ref name="Fagan_2000_47"/> which are of the [[geologic formation|Mesa Verde formation]].<ref name="Hopkins_2002_240">{{harvnb|Hopkins|2002|p=240}}</ref> The canyon bottomlands were further eroded, exposing [[Menefee Shale]] [[bedrock]]; this was subsequently buried under roughly {{convert|125|ft}} of [[sediment]]. The canyon and mesa lie within the "Chaco Core", distinct from the wider Chaco Plateau, the latter a flat region of grassland with infrequent stands of trees. Because the [[Continental Divide]] is only {{convert|15.5|mi|0}} east of the canyon, geological characteristics and different patterns of drainage differentiate these two regions both from each other and from the nearby [[Chaco Slope]], the [[Gobernador Slope]], and the [[Chuska Valley]].<ref name="Fagan_2000_46-47">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|pp=46<U+2013>47}}</ref>

== Climate ==
[[File:Chaco Canyon Fajada Butte in snow NPS.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Rocky desert landscape blanketed in snow, shown in near-twilight. Two massifs, several miles in the distance, are snow-covered.|Fajada Butte: Chaco averages three or four snowstorms a winter]]
An arid region of high [[deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric scrubland]] and desert steppe, the canyon and wider basin average {{convert|8|in|mm}} of rainfall annually; the park averages {{convert|9.1|in|mm}}. Chaco Canyon lies on the leeward side of extensive mountain ranges to the south and west, resulting in a [[rainshadow]] effect fostering the prevailing lack of moisture in the region.<ref name="Fagan_2000_44">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=44}}</ref> Four distinct seasons define the region, with rainfall most likely between July and September; May and June are the driest months. [[Orographic precipitation]], resulting from moisture wrung out of storm systems ascending mountain ranges around Chaco Canyon, is responsible for most precipitation in both summer and winter; rainfall increases with higher elevation.<ref name="Fagan_2000_47">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=47}}</ref> Occasional abnormal northward excursions of the [[intertropical convergence zone]] may boost precipitation in some years.

Chaco endures remarkable climatic extremes: temperatures range between {{convert|-38|to|102|F|C}},<ref name="Fagan_2000_45"/> and temperatures may swing 60&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (33&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) in one day.<ref name="NPS_2007"/> The region averages less than 150&nbsp;frost-free days per year, and the local climate swings wildly from years of plentiful rainfall to prolonged drought.<ref name="Frazier_2005_181">{{harvnb|Frazier|2005|p=181}}</ref> The heavy influence of the [[El Ni<U+00F1>o-Southern Oscillation]] contributes to the canyon's fickle climate.<ref name="Fagan_2000_45">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=45}}</ref>

== Flora and fauna ==

Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: [[Artemisia tridentata|sagebrush]] and several species of [[cactus]] are interspersed with dry scrub forests of [[Pinyon pine|pi<U+00F1>on]] and [[juniper]], the latter primarily on mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the [[temperate coniferous forests]] plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game.<ref name="Fagan_2000_222">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=222}}</ref> It has been suggested that even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.<ref name="Fagan_1998_177">{{harvnb|Fagan|1998|p=177}}</ref>

The canyon's most notable [[mammal]]ian species include the ubiquitous [[coyote]] (''Canis latrans''); [[mule deer]], [[elk]], and [[pronghorn]] also live within the canyon, though they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller [[carnivore]]s include [[bobcat]]s, [[badger]]s, [[fox]]es, and two species of [[skunk]]. The park hosts abundant populations of [[rodent]]s, including several [[prairie dog]] towns. Small colonies of [[bat]]s, are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include [[Geococcyx|roadrunners]], large [[hawk]]s (such as [[Cooper's hawk]]s and [[American kestrel]]s), [[owl]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[raven]]s, though they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including [[New World warbler|warblers]], [[sparrow]]s, and [[House Finch|house finches]], are also common. Three species of [[hummingbird]]s are present, including the tiny, but highly pugnacious, [[rufous hummingbird]]; they compete intensely with the more mild-tempered [[black-chinned hummingbird]]s for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. [[Crotalus oreganus|Western (prairie) rattlesnakes]] are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various [[lizard]]s and [[skink]]s are far more abundant.

{{seealso|Timeline of Chacoan history}}

=== Ancestral Puebloans ===
The first people in the [[San Juan Basin]] were hunter-gatherers: the ''[[Pecos Classification|Archaic]]''. These small bands descended from nomadic [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] big-game hunters who arrived in the Southwest around 10,000 BC.<ref name="Stuart_2000_14-17">{{harvnb|Stuart|2000|pp=14<U+2013>17}}</ref> By 900 BC, Archaic people lived at Atlatl Cave and like sites.<ref name="Stuart_2000_43">{{harvnb|Stuart|2000|p=43}}</ref> They left little evidence of their presence in Chaco Canyon. By AD 490, their descendants, called the ''[[Pecos Classification|Basketmakers]]'' by archaeologists, farmed lands around Shabik'eshchee Village and other [[dugout (shelter)|pithouse]] settlements at Chaco.

A small population of Basketmakers remained in the Chaco Canyon area.  The broad arc of their cultural elaboration culminated around 800, when they were building crescent-shaped stone complexes, each comprising four to five residential suites abutting subterranean ''[[kiva]]s'',<ref name="Fagan_2000_18-19">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|pp=18<U+2013>19}}</ref> large enclosed areas reserved for rites. Such structures characterize the ''[[Pecos Classification|Early Pueblo People]]''. By 850, the Ancient Pueblo population<U+2014>the "[[Anasazi]]", from a [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] term adopted by the [[Navajo language|Navajo]] denoting the "ancient ones" or "enemy ancestors"<U+2014>had rapidly expanded: groups resided in larger, denser pueblos. Strong evidence attests to a canyon-wide turquoise processing and trading industry dating from the 10th century. Around then, the first section of [[Pueblo Bonito]] was built: a curved row of 50 rooms near its present north wall.<ref name="Noble_1991_120">{{harvnb|Noble|1991|p=120}}</ref><ref name="Fagan_2000_20">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=20}}</ref>

<!--[[File:Chaco canyon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Pueblo Bonito, one of the principal complexes at Chaco]]-->

The cohesive Chacoan  system began unravelling around 1140, perhaps triggered by an extreme 50-year drought that began in 1130;<ref name="Fagan_2005_126">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=126}}</ref> chronic climatic instability, including a series of severe droughts, again struck the region between 1250 and 1450.<ref name="Fagan_2005_55-57">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|pp=55<U+2013>57}}</ref> Other factors included water management patterns (leading to arroyo cutting) and deforestation.<ref name="Diamond_2005_136-156">{{harvnb|Diamond|2005|pp=136<U+2013>156}}</ref><ref name="Noble_1984_11">{{harvnb|Noble|1984|p=11}}</ref><ref name="Noble_1984_57-58">{{harvnb|Noble|1984|pp=57<U+2013>58}}</ref> For instance, timber for construction was imported from outlying mountain ranges, such as the [[Chuska mountains|Chuska Mountains]] over {{convert|50|mi}} to the west.<ref name="English_2001_57">{{harvnb|English|2001}}</ref> Outlying communities began to disappear and, by the end of the century, the buildings in the central canyon had been carefully sealed and abandoned.

Some scholars suggest that violence and warfare, perhaps involving cannibalism, impelled the evacuations. Hints of such include dismembered bodies<U+2014>dating from Chacoan times<U+2014>found at two sites within the central canyon.<ref name="LeBlanc_1999_166">{{harvnb|LeBlanc|1999|p=166}}</ref> Yet Chacoan complexes showed little evidence of being defended or defensively sited high on cliff faces or atop mesas, and only several minor sites at Chaco evidence the large-scale burning that would suggest enemy raids.<ref name="LeBlanc_1999_180">{{harvnb|LeBlanc|1999|p=180}}</ref> Archaeological and cultural evidence leads scientists to believe people from this region migrated south, east, and west into the valleys and drainages of the [[Little Colorado River]], the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco]], and the [[Rio Grande]].<ref name="Strutin_1994_57"/>

Anthropologist [[Joseph Tainter]] deals at length with the structure and decline of Chaco civilization in his 1988 study ''The Collapse of Complex Societies''.

=== Athabaskan succession ===

[[Numic]]-speaking peoples, such as the [[Ute tribe|Ute]] and [[Shoshone]], were present on the Colorado Plateau beginning in the 12th century. Nomadic [[Southern Athabaskan]] speaking peoples, such as the [[Apache]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]], succeeded the Pueblo people in this region by the 15th century; in the process, they acquired Chacoan customs and agricultural skills.<ref name="Strutin_1994_57">{{harvnb|Strutin|1994|p=57}}</ref><ref name="Strutin_1994_60">{{harvnb|Strutin|1994|p=60}}</ref> Ute tribal groups also frequented the region, primarily during hunting and raiding expeditions. The modern Navajo Nation lies west of Chaco Canyon, and many Navajo live in surrounding areas. The arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in the 17th century inaugurated an era of subjugation and rebellion, with the Chaco Canyon area absorbing Puebloan and Navajo refugees fleeing Spanish rule. In succession, as first Mexico, then the U.S., gained sovereignty over the canyon, military campaigns were launched against the region's remaining inhabitants.<ref name="Strutin_1994_57-59">{{harvnb|Strutin|1994|pp=57<U+2013>59}}</ref>

=== Excavation and protection ===

[[File:San Juan Basin Prehistoric Roads.jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=Large square map of northwestern New Mexico and neighboring parts of, clockwise from left, western Arizona, southeastern Utah, and southwestern Colorado. The map region has a green and blocky rectangular-crescent area at its center labeled "Chaco Culture National Historical Park". Radiating from the green region are seven segmented gold lines: "[p]rehistoric roads", each several dozen kilometers in length when measured according to the map scale factor. Roughly seventy red dots mark the location of "Great House[s]"; they are widely spread across the map, many of them far from the green area, near the extremes of the map, more than one hundred kilometers from the green area.

Yellow dots mark the location of modern settlements: "Shiprock", "Cortez", "Farmington", and "Aztec" to the northwest and north; "Nageezi", "Cuba", and "Pueblo Pintado" to the northeast and east; "Grants", "Crownpoint", and "Gallup" to the south and southwest. They are connected by a network of gray lines marking various interstate and state highways. A fan of thin blue lines along the northern margins of the map depict the San Juan River and its communicants.|Prehistoric roads and Great Houses in the San Juan Basin, superimposed on a map showing modern roads and settlements.]]

The trader [[Josiah Gregg]] was the first to write about the ruins of Chaco Canyon, referring in 1832 to Pueblo Bonito as "built of fine-grit sandstone". In 1849, a U.S. Army detachment passed through and surveyed the ruins.<ref>{{harvnb|Brugge|Hayes|Judge|1988|p=4}}</ref> The canyon was so remote, however, that it was scarcely visited over the next 50 years. After brief reconnaissance work by Smithsonian scholars in the 1870s, formal archaeological work began in 1896 when a party from the [[American Museum of Natural History]]<U+2014>the Hyde Exploring Expedition<U+2014>began excavating Pueblo Bonito. Spending five summers in the region, they sent over 60,000 artifacts back to New York and operated a series of trading posts.<ref name="Strutin_1994_12-17">{{harvnb|Strutin|1994|pp=12<U+2013>17}}</ref>

In 1901 [[Richard Wetherill]], who had worked for the Hyde expedition, [[Homestead Act|claimed a homestead]] of {{convert|161|acre|ha}} that included Pueblo Bonito, [[Pueblo del Arroyo]], and [[Chetro Ketl]].<ref name="Brugge_1988_7">{{harvnb|Brugge|Hayes|Judge|1988|p=7}}</ref><ref name="Fagan_2005_32">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=32}}</ref> While investigating Wetherill's land claim, federal land agent Samuel J. Holsinger detailed the physical setting of the canyon and the sites, noted prehistoric road segments and stairways above Chetro Ketl, and documented prehistoric dams and irrigation systems.<ref name="Strutin_1994_18-19">{{harvnb|Strutin|1994|pp=18<U+2013>19}}</ref><ref name="Fagan_2005_165">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=165}}</ref> His report, which went unpublished, urged the creation of a national park to safeguard Chacoan sites. The next year, [[Edgar Lee Hewett]], president of New Mexico Normal University (later renamed [[New Mexico Highlands University]]), mapped many Chacoan sites. Hewett and others helped enact the Federal [[Antiquities Act|Antiquities Act of 1906]], the first U.S. law to protect relics; it was, in effect, a direct consequence of Wetherill's controversial activities at Chaco.<ref name="Fagan_2005_33">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=33}}</ref> The Act also authorized the President to found [[U.S. National Monument|national monuments]]: on March 11, 1907, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] proclaimed Chaco Canyon National Monument. Wetherill relinquished his claims.<ref name="NPS_2007"/>

In 1920, the [[National Geographic Society]] began an archaeological examination of Chaco Canyon, and appointed [[Neil Judd]], then 32,  to head the project. After a reconnaissance trip that year, Judd proposed to excavate [[Pueblo Bonito]], the largest ruin at Chaco. Beginning in 1921, Judd spent seven field seasons at Chaco.  Living and working conditions were spartan at best. In his memoirs, Judd noted dryly that "Chaco Canyon has its limitations as a summer resort."  By 1925, Judd's excavators had removed 100,000 [[short ton]]s of [[overburden]], using a team of  "35 or more Indians, ten white men, and eight or nine horses." One puzzling discovery was that Judd's team only found 69 [[Hearth#Archaeological features|hearths]] in the ruin; winters are cold at Chaco.<ref name="Elliot_1995"/>

Judd sent [[A. E. Douglass]] more than 90 specimens for [[tree-ring dating]], then in its infancy. At that time, Douglass had only a "floating" [[Tree-ring dating#Growth rings|chronology]]. it was not until 1929 that a Judd-led team found the "missing link." Most of the beams used at Chaco were cut between 1033 and 1092, the height of construction there.<ref name="Elliot_1995">{{harvnb|Elliott|1995}}</ref>

In 1949, the [[University of New Mexico]] deeded over adjoining lands to form an expanded Chaco Canyon National Monument. In return, the university maintained scientific research rights to the area. By 1959, the [[National Park Service]] had constructed a park visitor center, staff housing, and campgrounds. As a historic property of the National Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966. In 1971, researchers Robert Lister and James Judge established the Chaco Center, a division for cultural research that functioned as a joint project between the University of New Mexico and the National Park Service. A number of multi-disciplinary research projects, archaeological surveys, and limited excavations began during this time. The Chaco Center extensively surveyed the Chacoan roads, well-constructed and heavily built thoroughfares radiating from the central canyon.<ref name="Strutin_1994_32"/> The results from such research conducted at Pueblo Alto and other sites dramatically altered accepted academic interpretations of both the Chacoan culture and the Four Corners region of the American Southwest.

The richness of the cultural remains at park sites led to the expansion of the small National Monument into the Chaco Culture National Historical Park on December 19, 1980, when an additional {{convert|13000|acre}} were added to the protected area. In 1987, the park was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. To safeguard Chacoan sites on adjacent [[Bureau of Land Management]] and [[Navajo Nation]] lands, the Park Service developed the multi-agency Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Site program. These initiatives have detailed the presence of more than 2,400 archeological sites within the current park's boundaries; only a small percentage of these have been excavated.<ref name="Strutin_1994_32">{{harvnb|Strutin|1994|pp=32}}</ref><ref name="Fagan_2005_6">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=6}}</ref>

Two gold squares define high points: "Fajada Butte (2019 m.)" and "West Mesa (2035 m.)".|Major Chacoan sites within park margins]]

Chaco Culture National Historical Park is managed by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency within the [[U.S. Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]; neighboring federal lands hosting Chacoan roads are controlled by the [[Bureau of Land Management]]. In the 2002<U+2013>2003 [[fiscal year]], the park's total annual operating budget was [[United States dollar|US$]]1,434,000.<ref name="NPS_2005">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2005}}</ref> The park has a visitor center, which features the Chaco Collection Museum, an information desk, a theater, a book store, and a gift shop.

Prior to the 1980s, archeological excavations within current park boundaries were intensive: compound walls were dismantled or demolished, and thousands of artifacts were extracted. Starting in 1981, a new approach, informed by traditional Hopi and Pueblo beliefs, stopped such intrusions. [[Remote sensing]], [[cultural anthropology|anthropological]] study of Indian [[oral tradition]]s, and [[dendrochronology]]<U+2014>which left Chacoan relics undisturbed<U+2014>were touted. In this vein, the Chaco American Indian Consultation Committee was established in 1991 to give Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo, and other Indian representatives a voice in park oversight.<ref name="NPS_2007"/>

Current park policy mandates partial restoration of excavated sites. "Backfilling", or re-burying excavated sites with sand, is one such means.<ref name="NPS_2007"/> Other measures attempt to safeguard the area's ancient ambiance and mystique: the Chaco Night Sky Program, which seeks to eliminate the impact of [[light pollution]] on the park's acclaimed night skies; under the program, some 14,000 visitors make use of the Chaco Observatory (inaugurated in 1998), park telescopes, and astronomy-related programs.<ref name="NPS_2007">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2007}}</ref> Chacoan relics outside the current park's boundaries have been threatened by development: an example was the proposed competitive leasing of federal lands in the San Juan Basin for [[coal mining]] beginning in 1983. As ample coal deposits abut the park, this strip mining threatened the web of ancient Chacoan roads. The year-long Chaco Roads Project thus documented the roads, which were later protected from the proposed mining.<ref name="Frazier_2005_120-121">{{harvnb|Frazier|2005|pp=120<U+2013>121}}</ref>

[[File:Kiva Chaco Canyon NM.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Nine large round pits are seen from above, in washed-out daylight. Eight of the pits descend from a common stone platform; the ninth sits alone on a somewhat higher stone surface. The depressions run diagonally from bottom right to middle top. At bottom left are seen perhaps eight smaller, regularly sized rectangular "rooms" enclosed by ruined walls; to their left are larger ruined enclosures. Bordering the rings at top and right are various smaller rooms and walls which appear less ruined.|Chaco's smaller ''kivas'' numbered around 100, each hosting rituals for 50<U+2013>100 worshipers; the 15 much larger "Great Kivas" each held up to 400]]

The Chacoans built their complexes along a nine-mile (14&nbsp;km) stretch of canyon floor, with the walls of some structures aligned cardinally and others aligned with the 18.6&nbsp;year cycle of minimum and maximum moonrise and moonset. Nine Great Houses are positioned along the north side of Chaco Wash, at the base of massive sandstone mesas. Other Great Houses are found on mesa tops or in nearby washes and drainage areas. There are 14 recognized Great Houses, which are grouped below according to geographic positioning with respect to the canyon.

=== Central canyon ===

The central portion of the canyon contains the largest Chacoan complexes. The most studied is [[Pueblo Bonito]]; covering almost {{convert|2|acre}} and comprising at least 650 rooms, it is the largest Great House; in parts of the complex, the structure was four stories high. The builders' use of core-and-veneer architecture and multi-story construction necessitated massive masonry walls up to {{convert|3|ft|cm}} thick. Pueblo Bonito is divided into two sections by a wall precisely aligned to run north-south, bisecting the central plaza. A Great Kiva was placed on either side of the wall, creating a symmetrical pattern common to many Chacoan Great Houses. The scale of the complex, upon completion, rivaled that of the [[Colosseum]].<ref name="Sofaer_1997"/>

The straight side of the complex faces a metaled road delimiting the bottom third of the image. The complex itself comprises many smaller enclosed circular and rectangular spaces. These "rooms" no longer have ceilings.|Pueblo Bonito]]

Nearby is [[Pueblo del Arroyo]]. Founded between AD 1050 and 1075, completed in the early 12th century, it sits at a drainage outlet known as South Gap. Casa Rinconada, eloigned from other sites at Chaco. It sits to the south side of Chaco Wash, adjacent to a Chacoan road leading to a set of steep stairs that reached the top of Chacra Mesa. Its sole kiva stands alone, with no residential or support structures whatever; it did once had a {{convert|39|ft|adj=on}} passageway leading from the underground kiva to several above-ground levels. [[Chetro Ketl]], located near Pueblo Bonito, bears the typical D-shape of many other central complexes, but is slightly smaller. Begun between AD 1020 and 1050, its 450<U+2013>550 rooms shared one Great Kiva. Experts estimate that it took 29,135&nbsp;man-hours to erect Chetro Ketl alone; Hewett estimated that it took the wood of 5,000 trees and 50 million stone blocks.<ref name="Strutin_1994_26">{{harvnb|Strutin|1994|p=26}}</ref>

[[Kin Kletso]] ("Yellow House") was a medium-sized complex located {{convert|0.5|mi|m}} west of Pueblo Bonito. It shows strong evidence of construction and occupation by Pueblo peoples from the northern San Juan Basin. Its rectangular shape and design is related to the Pueblo II cultural group, rather than the Pueblo III style or its Chacoan variant. It contains around 55 rooms, four ground-floor ''kivas'', and a two-story cylindrical tower that may have functioned as a ''kiva'' or religious center. Evidence of an [[obsidian]]-processing industry was discovered near the village, which was erected between AD 1125 and 1130.<ref name="Fagan_2005_11">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=11}}</ref>

<!--[[File:Chaco-Culture-NHP-Pueblo-Del-Arroyo.jpg|thumb|right|''Kiva'', Pueblo del Arroyo]]-->
[[Pueblo Alto]], a Great House of 89 rooms, is located on a mesa top near the middle of Chaco Canyon, and is {{convert|0.6|mi|sigfig=1}} from Pueblo Bonito; it was begun between AD 1020 and 1050 during a wider building boom throughout the canyon. Its location made the community visible to most of the inhabitants of the San Juan Basin; indeed, it was only {{convert|2.3|mi}} north of Tsin Kletsin, on the opposite side of the canyon. The community was the center of a bead- and [[turquoise]]-processing industry that influenced the development of all villages in the canyon; [[chert]] tool production was also common. Research conducted by archaeologist Tom Windes at the site suggests that only a handful of families, perhaps as few as five to twenty, actually lived in the complex; this may imply that Pueblo Alto served a primarily non-residential role.<ref name="Fagan_2005_10-11">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|pp=10<U+2013>11}}</ref> Another Great House, [[Nuevo Alto]], was built on the north mesa near Pueblo Alto; it was founded in the late 12th century, a time when the Chacoan population was declining in the canyon.

=== Outliers ===

In Chaco Canyon's northern reaches lies another cluster of Great Houses; among the largest are [[Casa Chiquita]] ("Small House"), a village built in the AD 1080s, when, in a period of ample rainfall, Chacoan culture was expanding. Its layout featured a smaller, squarer profile; it also lacked the open plazas and separate kivas of its predecessors.<ref name="Fagan_2005_21">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=21}}</ref> Larger, squarer blocks of stone were used in the masonry; kivas were designed in the northern [[Mesa Verde]]an tradition. Two miles down the canyon is [[Pe<U+00F1>asco Blanco]] ("White Bluff"), an arc-shaped compound built atop the canyon's southern rim in five distinct stages between AD 900 and 1125. A cliff painting (the "Supernova Platograph") nearby may record the sighting of the [[SN 1054]] [[supernova]] on July 5, 1054.{{cref|<U+03B2>}}<ref name="Kelley_Milone_2004_413"/>

[[Hungo Pavi]], located {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} from Una Vida, measured {{convert|872|ft}} in circumference. Initial probes revealed 72 ground-level rooms,<ref name="Fagan_2005_26"/> with structures reaching four stories in height; one large circular kiva has been identified. [[Kin Nahasbas]], built in either the 9th or 10th century, is sited slightly north of Una Vida, positioned at the foot of the north mesa. Limited excavation of it has taken place.<ref name="Fagan_2005_98">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=98}}</ref>

[[Tsin Kletzin]] ("Charcoal Place"), a compound located on the Chacra Mesa and positioned above Casa Rinconada, is {{convert|2.3|mi}} due south of Pueblo Alto, on the opposite side of the canyon. Nearby is Weritos Dam, a massive earthen structure that scientists believe provided Tsin Kletzin with all of its domestic water. The dam worked by retaining stormwater runoff in a reservoir. Massive amounts of silt accumulated during flash floods would have forced the residents to regularly rebuild the dam and dredge the catchment area.<ref name="Frazier_2005_101">{{harvnb|Frazier|2005|p=101}}</ref>

At left and right are two similar walls perpendicular to the one at middle.|Interior of [[Wijiji]], an outlier site occupied between AD 1100 and 1150]]

Deeper in the canyon, [[Una Vida]] ("One Life") is one of the three oldest Great Houses; construction began around AD 900. Comprising at least two stories and 124 rooms,<ref name="Fagan_2005_26">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=26}}</ref> it shares an arc or D-shaped design with its contemporaries, Pe<U+00F1>asco Blanco and Pueblo Bonito, but has a unique "dog leg" addition made necessary by topography. It is located in one of the canyon's major side drainages, near Gallo Wash, and was massively expanded after 930.<ref name="Fagan_2005_6"/> [[Wijiji]] ("[[Greasewood]]"), comprising just over 100 rooms, is the smallest of the Great Houses. Built between AD 1110 and 1115,<ref name="Fagan_2005_6-7">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|pp=6<U+2013>7}}</ref> it was the last Chacoan Great House to be constructed. Somewhat isolated within the narrow wash, it is positioned {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} from neighboring Una Vida.

Directly north are communities even more remote: [[Salmon Ruins]] and [[Aztec Ruins]], sited on the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]] and [[Animas River]]s near Farmington, were built during a 30-year wet period commencing in AD 1100.<ref name="Fagan_2005_198"/><ref name="Fagan_2005_208">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=208}}</ref> Sixty miles (100&nbsp;km) directly south of Chaco Canyon, on the Great South Road, lies another cluster of outlying communities. The largest, Kin Nizhoni, stands atop a {{convert|7000|ft|adj=on}} mesa surrounded by marshy bottomlands.

The wall runs diagonally from the immediate foreground at left towards the right, running perhaps several dozen feet to the near middle distance. A few feet to the right, in the middle foreground, a low ring of similar blocks delimits a circular pit sunk into the ground. The remains of several other ruinous low walls, perhaps one to three high at most, are arrayed in parallel; they align left to right from the high diagonal wall. Perhaps a mile distant to the center and right, a canyon wall slopes gradually level to meet the valley floor on which the walls sit.|Casa Rinconada]]

Immense complexes known as "Great Houses" embodied worship at Chaco. The Chacoan people used masonry techniques unique for their time, and their building constructions lasted decades and even centuries. As architectural forms evolved and centuries passed, the houses kept several core traits. Most apparent is their sheer bulk; complexes averaged more than 200 rooms each, and some enclosed up to 700 rooms.<ref name="Sofaer_1997"/> Individual rooms were substantial in size, with higher ceilings than Anasazi works of preceding periods. They were well-planned: vast sections or wings erected were finished in a single stage, rather than in increments. Houses generally faced the south, and plaza areas were almost always girt with edifices of sealed-off rooms or high walls. Houses often stood four or five stories tall, with single-story rooms facing the plaza; room blocks were terraced to allow the tallest sections to compose the pueblo's rear edifice. Rooms were often organized into suites, with front rooms larger than rear, interior, and storage rooms or areas.

The entrance reveals a view of another similar wall, itself bearing a doorway showing yet another wall with another door. Four such nested sets of doorways are seen, with a fifth wall visible through the final fourth doorway.|Doorways, Pueblo Bonito]]

Ceremonial structures known as ''[[kiva]]s'' were built in proportion to the number of rooms in a pueblo. One small ''kiva'' was built for roughly every 29 rooms. Nine complexes each hosted an oversized Great Kiva, each up to {{convert|63|ft}} in diameter. T-shaped doorways and stone [[lintel]]s marked all Chacoan kivas. Though simple and compound walls were often used, Great Houses were primarily constructed of [[core-and-veneer]] walls: two parallel load-bearing walls comprising dressed, flat [[sandstone]] blocks bound in [[clay]] mortar were erected. Gaps between walls were packed with [[rubble]], forming the wall's core. Walls were then covered in a veneer of small sandstone pieces, which were pressed into a layer of binding [[mud]].<ref name="Fagan_2005_119-121">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|pp=119<U+2013>121}}</ref> These surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns. The Chacoan structures altogether required the wood of 200,000 coniferous trees, mostly hauled<U+2014>on foot<U+2014>from mountain ranges up to {{convert|70|mi}} away.<ref name="Sofaer_1999"/><ref name="Raynolds_2005_1062">{{harvnb|Reynolds|Betancourt|Quade|2005|p=1062}}</ref><ref name="Raynolds_2005_1073">{{harvnb|Reynolds|Betancourt|Quade|2005|p=1073}}</ref>

The meticulously designed buildings composing the larger Chacoan complexes did not emerge until around AD 1030. The Chacoans melded pre-planned architectural designs, astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering into ancient urban centers of unique public architecture. Researchers have concluded that the complex may have had a relatively small residential population, with larger groups assembling only temporarily for annual ceremonies.<ref name="Sofaer_1999">{{harvnb|Sofaer|1999}}</ref> Smaller sites, apparently more residential in character, are scattered near the Great Houses in and around Chaco. The canyon itself runs along one of the lunar alignment lines, suggesting the location was originally chosen for its astronomical significance. If nothing else, this allowed alignment with several other key structures in the canyon.<ref name="Sofaer_1997">{{harvnb|Sofaer|1997}}</ref>

Around this time, the extended Ancestral Puebloan ([[Anasazi]]) community experienced a population and construction boom. Throughout the 10th century, Chacoan building techniques spread from the canyon to neighboring regions.<ref name="Fagan_2005_204">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=204}}</ref> By AD 1115, at least 70 outlying pueblos of Chacoan provenance had been built within the {{convert|25000|sqmi}} composing the San Juan Basin. Experts speculate the function of these compounds, some large enough to be considered Great Houses in their own right. Some suggest they may have been more than agricultural communities, perhaps functioning as trading posts or ceremonial sites.<ref name="Fagan_2005_202-208">{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|pp=202<U+2013>208}}</ref>

Thirty such outliers spread across {{convert|65000|sqmi}} are connected to the central canyon and to one another by an enigmatic web of six Chacoan road systems. Extending up to {{convert|60|mi}} in generally straight routes, they appear to have been extensively surveyed and engineered.<ref name="Fagan_1998_178">{{harvnb|Fagan|1998|p=178}}</ref><ref name="Noble_1984_52-53">{{harvnb|Noble|1984|pp=52<U+2013>53}}</ref> Their depressed and scraped [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] beds reach {{convert|30|ft}} wide; earthen [[berm]]s or rocks, at times composing low walls, delimit their edges.
