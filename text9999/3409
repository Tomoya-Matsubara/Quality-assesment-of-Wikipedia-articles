'''Scott Kildall''' (b. 1969 in Monterey, California) is a [[conceptual artist]] working with new technologies in a variety of media including [[video art]], prints, [[sculpture]] and [[performance art]]. He is the son of computer innovator, [[Gary Kildall]].

Kildall graduated with an undergraduate degree in [[Political Philosophy]] from [[Brown University]] in 1991. He received a Master of Fine Arts through the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in the Art and Technology Studies department in 2006.

Kildall works broadly with themes of memory as they relate to evolving perceptions of media.<ref>KQED Television: [http://www.kqed.org/arts/multimedia/index.jsp?id=18262 Spark Artist Profile], August 1st, 2007</ref> He gathers material from the public realm and repackages them into artworks in other environments.<ref>Mizota, Sharon: [http://www.sfweekly.com/2006-04-26/culture/the-masculine-mystique/ The Masculine Mystique], SF Weekly, April 26th, 2006</ref><ref>Callaway, Bob: [http://artfever.blogspot.com/2006/04/all-male-revue-manbox-at-lab.html All Male Revue: ("Man Box" at the LAB)], art fever, April 14th, 2006</ref>

== Artwork ==
Kildall<U+2019>s artwork centers on how we store and access memories in relation to how media gets produced and disseminated. Future Memories (2006) is a single-channel video work, which uses in-between moments from iconic Hollywood movies. The clips are black-and-white with an ambient soundtrack, which result in a feeling of displaced familiarity as the viewer registers the clips on a subconscious level.<ref>Hackett, Regina: [http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/visualart/276042_crawlspace01.html Hidden talent sees the light of day at Crawl Space], Seattle Times, July 1, 2006</ref>
The socio-historical impacts of media play a role in some of his creations. Uncertain Location (2007) recreates the [[Apollo 11]] lunar landing in response to an announcement by NASA that it was unable to find the original tapes of that event.<ref>Shaughnessy, Haydn: [http://www.nyartsmagazine.com/index.php?Itemid=714&id=108080&option=com_content&task=view Scott Kildall's Memory Projects], NY Arts, Jan-Feb 2008</ref>
