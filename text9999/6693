'''Dominik "The Dominator" Ha<U+0161>ek''' ({{IPA-cs|<U+02C8>dom<U+026A>n<U+026A>k <U+02C8><U+0266>a<U+0283><U+025B>k}}; born January 29, 1965) is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]] currently playing for [[HC Spartak Moscow]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League ]].

In his 16-season [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) career, he played for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Buffalo Sabres]], [[Detroit Red Wings]], and the [[Ottawa Senators]]. During his years in Buffalo, he became one of the league's finest goaltenders, earning him the nickname "'''The Dominator'''".

In the process, he set a record for shutouts in a postseason year.

Ha<U+0161>ek is considered an unorthodox goaltender, with a distinct style that has labeled him a "flopper".<ref name="MainBio">{{cite web|url=http://hockeygoalies.org/bio/hasek.html|title=Dominik Hasek (1990<U+2013>present)|publisher=hockeygoalies.org|accessdate=2007-04-24|year=2007}}</ref> He is best known for his concentration, foot speed, flexibility, and unconventional saves, such as covering the puck with his blocker rather than his [[Glove (hockey)|trapper]].<ref name="MainBio"/>

Ha<U+0161>ek is the only goalie in NHL history to win the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] twice (most valuable player). He holds the highest saving percentage in all time career (92.23%)

==Early life==
Ha<U+0161>ek started playing hockey at the age of six in his native [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. As he explains:

{{cquote|They held a tryout for 5-year-old boys and my father took me there. I didn't even have real skates. I had those blades that you screwed onto the soles of your shoes, but I was tall, and the 9-year-olds didn't have a goalie, so they put me in with them and thats where I fell in love with the game of hockey.<ref name="flex">{{cite news

| accessdate = 2006-01-22}}</ref>}}

In 1980, the 16 year old Ha<U+0161>ek joined the top hockey league in the country, becoming the youngest hockey player in history to play at the professional level, playing for his home team [[HC Pardubice]] of the [[Czechoslovak Extraliga]], winning two league titles in 1987 and 1989. The next year, he was drafted by the Czech army to play for [[Dukla Jihlava]]. After making his mark and eventually playing for the Czechoslovakian National team, Ha<U+0161>ek entered the NHL draft and was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in [[1983 NHL Entry Draft|1983]]. At the time, NHL teams were wary of drafting players from behind the [[Iron Curtain]] who were often unwilling to play in the NHL or barred from doing so by their countries. Consequently, Ha<U+0161>ek was picked in the 10th round (199th overall) and was the seventeenth goalie selected. Ha<U+0161>ek did not even know he had been drafted until several months later.<ref name="draft">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=18282|title=Dominik Hasek|publisher=legendsofhockey.net|accessdate=2006-08-05}}</ref>

Until 1990, Ha<U+0161>ek played in his native Czechoslovakia for [[HC Pardubice]] and [[HC Jihlava]]. He was named the [[Golden Hockey Stick (Czechoslovakia)|top ice hockey player]] of the Czechoslovak Extraliga in 1987, 1989, and 1990, and Goaltender of the Year from 1986 through 1990.<ref name="TSNprofile">{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=126&hubname=nhl-red_wings|title=TSN.ca player profile|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> With [[Velvet Revolution|the end of communist rule]] in 1989, the borders of the Soviet Bloc countries opened, allowing Ha<U+0161>ek to emigrate to the United States with aspirations of playing in the NHL.<ref name="draft"/> His American career began with the [[Indianapolis Ice]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|IHL]], where he played parts of two seasons. His NHL debut with the Blackhawks finally came in the [[1990<U+2013>91 NHL season|1990<U+2013>91 season]], eight years after the 1983 NHL Entry Draft.

==NHL career==
===Chicago Blackhawks===
In Chicago, Ha<U+0161>ek spent time as the backup to [[Ed Belfour]], and played only 25 games over two seasons with the Blackhawks. On November 6, 1990, wearing the number 34 (31 was worn by Ed Belfour in his rookie year), Ha<U+0161>ek made his first NHL start in a 1<U+2013>1 tie against the [[Hartford Whalers]].<ref name="detroit page">{{cite web

His first victory came on March 8, 1991, in a 5<U+2013>3 performance over the Buffalo Sabres, and on January 9, 1992, he recorded his first shutout in a 2<U+2013>0 win against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref name="detroit page"/>

===Buffalo Sabres (1992<U+2013>1998)===

After a Stanley Cup finals loss to [[Mario Lemieux]] and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], Ha<U+0161>ek was traded to the Buffalo Sabres for goalie [[Stephane Beauregard]] and future considerations, which later materialized into a draft pick used to obtain [[<U+00C9>ric Daz<U+00E9>]]. In Buffalo, wearing number 39, he was initially the backup goaltender, first playing behind [[Tom Draper]] and then [[Grant Fuhr]]. When Fuhr was injured partway through the season, Ha<U+0161>ek was elevated to starter, where he soon developed into a top tier goaltender. In [[1993<U+2013>94 NHL season|1994]], he won his first [[Vezina Trophy]], was runner-up for the [[Hart Trophy]] and shared the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] with Fuhr. Ha<U+0161>ek played 58 games with a league-best 1.95 [[goals against average]] (GAA), seven shutouts, and a .930 [[save percentage]]. He followed this feat by again winning the Vezina Trophy and again placing as a Hart finalist in [[1994<U+2013>95 NHL season|1995]].

Ha<U+0161>ek's continued success in the [[1996<U+2013>97 NHL season|1996<U+2013>97 season]] was overshadowed by a conflict with then-head coach [[Ted Nolan]]. The conflict created a tense, clique-like atmosphere in the Sabres' clubhouse.<ref name="rattling">{{cite news

With Steve Shields in goal, the Sabres fought back against the Senators and took the series in seven games. However, Ha<U+0161>ek claimed his knee was still injured and did not play in the five-game loss in the following series against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].

Though General Manager [[John Muckler]] was named "Executive of the Year", he was fired for his constant feuding with Nolan. Ha<U+0161>ek, who sided with Muckler, stated in an interview during the 1997 NHL Awards Ceremony that it would be better if Nolan was not rehired.<ref>{{cite news

However, after Detroit's first round loss to the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in the [[2002<U+2013>03 NHL season|following season]], he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on [[Curtis Joseph]]'s three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Colorado Avalanche would be looking for a goalie to replace [[Patrick Roy]] after his retirement.<ref name="comeback"/> With [[Manny Legac<U+00E9>]] also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.

In the [[2003<U+2013>04 Detroit Red Wings season|2003<U+2013>04 season]] Ha<U+0161>ek injured his groin after playing just 14 games. On January 9, he and the team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Ha<U+0161>ek privately told general manager [[Ken Holland]] that he would not accept any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he announced that he was not going to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management.<ref>

In October 2003, the country's top prosecutor overruled Strnadov<U+00E1>, saying her ruling was unlawful because the case had not been properly investigated. The Pardubice prosecution then investigated the case again, and reached the same decision as Strnadov<U+00E1>.<ref>{{cite web

==Legacy==
===Milestones===
Ha<U+0161>ek earned his 300th National Hockey League win on October 15, 2005, in a 5<U+2013>1 home victory with the Ottawa Senators over the Boston Bruins. He stopped 34 of 35 shots and was holding a shutout until Bruins forward [[Pat Leahy (ice hockey)|Pat Leahy]] jammed a loose puck under him three minutes into the third period. He became the twenty-second goaltender to reach the milestone.<ref name="MainBio"/> He is the oldest goaltender in NHL history to post a 30-win season, and in 1997, he became the first goaltender to win the Lester B. Pearson Award for most outstanding player in the league. He is also the only goaltender to win the Hart Trophy twice for most valuable player, and was only one Vezina Trophy away from tying Jacques Plante's record of seven. Ha<U+0161>ek's personal best shutout streak is 181 minutes, 17 seconds.
