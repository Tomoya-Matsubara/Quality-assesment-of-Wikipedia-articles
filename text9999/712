'''Gillingham Football Club''' is an [[England|English]] professional [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in the town of [[Gillingham, Medway|Gillingham]], [[Kent]], currently playing in the [[Football League One]].  The only Kent-based club in the [[Football League]], they play their home matches at [[krbs Priestfield Stadium]].

The club was founded in 1893 and joined the Football League in 1920.  They were voted out of the league in favour of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] at the end of the [[1937-38 in English football|1937<U+2013>38]] season, but returned to it 12 years later after it was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs. Twice in the late 1980s they came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline then set in and in 1993 they narrowly avoided relegation to the [[Football Conference]].  Between 2000 and 2005, Gillingham were in the second tier of the English league for the only time in their history, achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in [[2002-03 in English football|2002<U+2013>03]].

===Early years===
[[Image:Gills1913.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The official announcement of the club's change of name in 1913.]]
In May 1893, the local success of a junior football side, '''Chatham Excelsior F.C.''', encouraged a group of businessmen to meet with a view to creating a football club which could compete in larger competitions.<ref name=p1>{{cite book

They were named Champions in the first season ([[1894-95 in English football|1894<U+2013>95]]) going on to defeat [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in a [[test match (football)|test match]] to win promotion.<ref>{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893<U+2013>1984
  | pages = p5 }}</ref>

In the seasons that followed, the club struggled in Division One, finishing bottom in the [[1907-08 in English football|1907<U+2013>08]] season,<ref name="FCHD">{{Cite web

Whilst the club's league performance was disappointing, the side did manage a famous cup victory over [[Football League]] [[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and held [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to a draw before losing in the replay.<ref>{{cite book

  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893<U+2013>1984
  | pages = p9 }}</ref> but performances remained disappointing.  The team finished bottom of Division One in the [[1919-20 in English football|1919<U+2013>20]] season but for a third time avoided relegation, due to the subsequent elevation of all Southern League Division One clubs to form the new [[Football League Division Three]].<ref>{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893<U+2013>1984
  | pages = p10 }}</ref>

===First spell in the Football League===
In the first season of the newly-created Football League Division Three, the [[1920-21 in English football|1920<U+2013>21]] season, Gillingham again finished bottom, and in the years to follow there was little improvement on this, the club continually finishing in the lower reaches of the bottom division.  In 1938 the team finished bottom of the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division (South)]] and were required to apply for re-election for the fifth time since joining the league. This bid for re-election failed, with Gillingham returning to the Southern League and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] being promoted in their place.<ref name=p13>{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893<U+2013>1984
  | pages = p13 }}</ref> Gillingham quickly established themselves as one of the stronger sides in the league, winning a local double of the [[Kent League]] and [[Kent Senior Cup]] in the [[1945-46 in English football|1945<U+2013>46]] season.<ref name=p13/>  In the [[1946-47 in English football|1946<U+2013>47]] season the team won both the [[Southern League Cup]] and the Southern League championship, during which they recorded a club record 12-1 victory over [[Gloucester City F.C.|Gloucester City]].<ref name="Triggs16">{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893<U+2013>1984

  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893<U+2013>1984
  | pages = p19 }}</ref>

===Return to the Football League===
In 1950 plans were announced to expand the Football League Division Three (South) from 22 to 24 teams and, taking into account their local success in the interim, Gillingham were re-elected to the Football League with a landslide vote.<ref name=p19/>  The team spent eight seasons in Division Three (South) before the restructuring of the league system for the [[1958-59 in English football|1958<U+2013>59]] season saw them placed in the newly-created [[Fourth Division]].  They remained in this division until 1964, when manager [[Freddie Cox]] led them to promotion, winning the first and so far only championship in the club's history.  The team finished the season level on 60 points with [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], but with a better [[goal average]] (1.967 against 1.948), which was the tightest league title finish in Football League history.<ref>{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893<U+2013>1984
  | pages = p26 }}</ref>

After relegation back to the Fourth Division in [[1970-71 in English football|1970<U+2013>71]], the Gills were soon promoted back to the Third Division in the [[1973-74 in English football|1973<U+2013>74]] season.<ref>{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893<U+2013>1984
  | pages = p54 }}</ref> After this the club seemed to find its level in Division Three, regularly mounting a challenge for promotion which ultimately fell short each time, never more so than in [[1986-87 in English football|1986<U+2013>87]] when they reached the [[Football League Play-Offs|play-offs]] only to lose in the final to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].<ref name="GFCHist" />  During this period the club produced future stars [[Steve Bruce]] and [[Tony Cascarino]], who was famously bought from non-league [[Crockenhill F.C.|Crockenhill]] in exchange for a set of tracksuits.<ref>{{Cite web

In 1987 the Gills hit the headlines when, on consecutive Saturdays, they beat [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] 8-1 and [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] 10-0, the latter a club record for a [[Football League]] match.  Just a few months later, however, manager [[Keith Peacock]] was controversially sacked<ref>{{Cite web

===Recent highs and lows===
Beset with financial problems, the club went into administration in January 1995, and by the end of the [[1994-95 in English football|1994<U+2013>95]] season faced the threat of being expelled from the Football League and closed down.<ref name="GFCHist" />  In June 1995, however, a London-based businessman, [[Paul Scally]], stepped in and bought the club for <U+00A3>1.<ref>{{Cite web

The team's biggest ever professional win was a 10-0 defeat of  [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in September 1987,<ref name="SB" />

==Rivalries==
Due to Gillingham's position geographically, there have traditionally not been fierce local rivalries with neighbouring clubs, as the closest other League teams are based in [[London]] and [[Essex]].

[[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] are currently considered to be the closest the Gills have to local rivals.<ref name="FGG" />  [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] are seen by many fans as the club's biggest rivals, stemming from bad-tempered matches between the two teams in 1979 and 1987.<ref>{{Cite web

==Gillingham in popular culture==
The 2005 film ''[[Green Street]]'' (known as ''Green Street Hooligans'' in the USA) makes use of action sequences filmed during a match between Gillingham and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], although for unknown reasons the dialogue states that the team playing West Ham is [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].<ref>{{Cite web
