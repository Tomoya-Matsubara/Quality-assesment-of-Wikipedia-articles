'''Interstate 296''' ('''I-296''') is a part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the US state of [[Michigan]]. It is a [[Michigan highway system|state trunkline highway]] that  runs for {{convert|3.43|mi|km|2}}  entirely within the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] area. Its termini are [[Interstate 96|I-96]] on the north side of Grand Rapids in [[Walker, Michigan|Walker]] and [[Interstate 196|I-196]] near downtown Grand Rapids. The entire length is [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[U.S. Route 131|U.S. Highway 131]] (US&nbsp;131), which continues as a freeway built to [[interstate standard]]s north and south of the shorter Interstate. The [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) has eliminated all signage for I-296 and removed the designation from their officially published state map. The designation is therefore [[unsigned highway|unsigned]], but still listed on the [[Federal Highway Administration]]'s route log for the Interstate Highway System. 

==Route description==
I-296 begins at the I-196 interchange west of the [[Grand River]] and downtown Grand Rapids. Here the three northbound lanes are on the left and the three southbound lanes are on the right, opposite of the normal traffic arrangement in the US. This arrangement is reversed north of the ramps for I-196 as the southbound lanes go over the northbound lanes. Running parallel to the Grand River on the west bank, the freeway designation begins across the river from the 6th Street Bridge Park and [[Belknap Hill]] north of the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum]] and the [[DeVos Place Convention Center]]. The west side of the freeway faces residential neighborhoods and the east side borders commercial businesses and the river. South of the Ann Street interchange, the highway crosses a rail line. After crossing both the railroad and Ann Street, the highway widens to allow for a grassy median. The freeway leaves Grand Rapids an enters Walker north of Ann Street.<ref name="MDOT07"/><ref name="googleGR"/>

Approaching I-96 from the south, the freeway runs to the east of the [[DeltaPlex Arena]] and the median widens further across the river from Comstock Riverside Park in Walker. An extra lane is added on the left, widening the freeway to four lanes. Unsigned I-296 follows the left two lanes that form the left exit for I-96 from US&nbsp;131. At the split between I-296 and US&nbsp;131, I-296 curves northwest, and US&nbsp;131 curves northeast following a bend in the Grand River. Once I-296 diverges from US&nbsp;131, the highway crosses West River Drive and there are exits on the right for eastbound I-96 and the left for northbound M-37/Alpine Avenue. Past these two exits, I-296 merges into westbound I-96 and terminates. Southbound unsigned I-296 begins where the ramps to US&nbsp;131 southbound split from eastbound I-96 at the Alpine Avenue overpass, merging with southbound US&nbsp;131 north of Ann Street.<ref name="MDOT07">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Department of Transportation Map |year=2007 |scale= 1&nbsp;in.:3.5&nbsp;mi/1&nbsp;cm.:2&nbsp;km |inset=Grand Rapids}}</ref><ref name="googleGR"/>

==History==
A freeway along the I-296/US&nbsp;131 corridor was proposed in the 1950s. The 1955 "[[General Location of National System of Interstate Highways|Yellow Book]]", an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System,  contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Grand Rapids area including a north<U+2013>south freeway near the downtown area.<ref name="YBGR">{{cite map |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Grand_Rapids,_Michigan_1955_Yellow_Book.jpg|title= General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955 (Yellow Book) |inset=Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Public Roads |date=1955}}</ref> Designated as part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1957, I-296 construction was funded by the federal government.<ref name="FHWA"/><ref name="FHWA2">{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/ |title= FHWA Route Log and Finder List |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=March 22, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2010}}</ref><ref group="n">I-296 was constructed and included in the Interstate Highway System before 1978. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 provided that all Interstate construction authorized under previous amendments to the system would be funded by the federal government but additional highway mileage added under 23 USC 103(c)(4)(A) would not be funded from the same highway fund.</ref>

The US&nbsp;131 freeway was opened in late 1962 between 28th Street and the then I-196/[[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|US&nbsp;16]] freeway north of downtown.<ref name="MSHD62GR">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Map |year= 1962 |inset=Grand Rapids}}</ref><ref name="MSHD63GR">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Map |year=1963 |inset=Grand Rapids}}</ref> This freeway section encompasses all of I-296 which will connect I-196 north of town with I-96 downtown.
