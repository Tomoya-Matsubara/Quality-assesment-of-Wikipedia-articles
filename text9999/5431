Leachman majored in drama at [[Illinois State University]] and [[Northwestern University]], where she was a member of [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and a classmate of future comic actor [[Paul Lynde]]. Leachman began appearing on television and in films shortly after competing in [[Miss America]] as Miss Chicago 1946. Before that she was very active at the Des Moines Playhouse, starring in many productions.

==Career==

===Early career===
After winning a scholarship in the beauty pageant, Leachman studied acting in [[New York City]] at the [[Actors Studio]] with [[Elia Kazan]]. It was there that she met the first love of her life, Andrew Morgan. Leachman was a replacement for character [[Nellie Forbush]] during the original run of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. A few years later, she appeared in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-bound production of [[William Inge]]'s ''[[Come Back, Little Sheba (play)|Come Back, Little Sheba]]'', but left the show before it reached Broadway when [[Katharine Hepburn]] asked her to co-star in a production of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[As You Like It]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=1162837|title=Would America Miss Miss America?|first=Buck|last=Wolf|date=2005-09-20|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref>

Leachman appeared in many live television broadcasts in the 1950s, including such programs as ''[[Suspense (US TV series)|Suspense]]'' and ''[[Westinghouse Studio One|Studio One]]''. She was also one of the Raisonette Girls in the 1960s. She made her feature film debut as an extra in the 1947 film ''[[Carnegie Hall]]'', but had her first real role in [[Robert Aldrich]]'s [[film noir]] classic ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'',<ref name=lat>{{cite news|first=Valerie J.|last=Nelson|title=Maxine Cooper Gomberg dies at 84; actress in the film noir classic 'Kiss Me Deadly'|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-maxine-cooper15-2009apr15,0,2025998.story|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=|date=2009-04-15 |accessdate=2009-04-16}}</ref> released in 1955. Leachman was several months pregnant during the filming, and appears in one scene running down a darkened highway wearing only a trenchcoat. A year later she appeared opposite [[Paul Newman]] and [[Lee Marvin]] in ''[[The Rack (film)|The Rack]]'' (1956). She appeared with Newman again, in a brief role as a prostitute in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).  She also appeared as "Judy" in Season one, Episode 2 of the TV series ''[[Adam-12]]''. 

She continued to work mainly in television, with appearances in ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' and in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode ''[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]''. During this period, Leachman notably appeared on the popular anthology ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' in an engaging episode entitled "Premonition" opposite [[John Forsythe]]. Later in the decade, Leachman appeared as [[Ruth Martin (television character)|Ruth Martin]], Timmy's adoptive mom, in the last half of season four (1957) of ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''. [[Jon Provost]] ("[[Timmy Martin]]") said, "Cloris did not feel particularly challenged by the role. Basically, when she realized that all she'd be doing was baking cookies, she wanted out."<ref>{{cite web

</ref> She was replaced by [[June Lockhart]] in 1959. In 1959, she appeared in an episode of ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond|One Step Beyond]]'' titled "The Dark Room", where she portrayed an American photographer living in Paris. In 1960 she played Marilyn Parker, the roommate of [[Janice Rule]]'s character, Elena Nardos, in the [[Checkmate (TV series)|Checkmate]] episode ''The Mask of Vengeance''.

===Recognition and acclaim===
Leachman has won numerous awards during her career. She won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971), based on the bestselling book by [[Larry McMurtry]]. She played the high school gym teacher's wife, with whom [[Timothy Bottoms]]' character has an affair. Director [[Peter Bogdanovich]] had predicted to Leachman during production that she would win an Academy Award for her performance. The part was originally offered to [[Ellen Burstyn]], who wanted another role in the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,393615,00.html|title=Ellen Burstyn (I)|first=Sandra|last=Hebron|date=2000-11-05|work=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=2007-08-17|location=London}}</ref>

Leachman has also won a record-setting eight primetime and one daytime [[Emmy Awards]] and been nominated more than 20 times for her work in television over the years, most notably as the character of neighbor/landlady/nosy friend [[Phyllis Lindstrom]] on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. The character was a recurring character on the program for five years and was subsequently featured in a spinoff series, ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' (1975<U+2013>1977), for which Leachman garnered a [[Golden Globe]] award. The series ran for two seasons. Its cancellation was partly due to the deaths of three regular or recurring cast members during its brief run: [[Barbara Colby]], [[Judith Lowry]] and [[Burt Mustin]].

[[File:Cloris Leachman Phyllis 1974.JPG|thumb|200px|Cloris Leachman as Phyllis Lindstrom, 1974.]]

In 1977, she guest starred on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', episode 2.24 (48th episode). In 1978, she won the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]]. In 1987 she hosted the VHS releases of ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.school-house-rock.com/history.htm |title=History of Schoolhouse Rock |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080628074454/http://www.school-house-rock.com/history.htm |archivedate = 2008-06-28}}</ref> In 1986, Leachman returned to television, replacing [[Charlotte Rae]]'s character Edna Garrett as the den mother on ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''. Leachman's role, as Edna's sister, [[List of characters from The Facts of Life#Beverly Ann Stickle|Beverly Ann Stickle]], could not save the long-running series, and it was canceled two years later.

She has voice-acted in numerous animated films, including ''[[My Little Pony: The Movie]]'' as the evil witch mother from the Volcano of Gloom, ''[[The Iron Giant]]'', and most notably as the voice of the cantankerous sky pirate Dola in [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s 1986 feature ''[[Castle in the Sky]]''. Dubbed by Disney in 1998, Leachman's performance in this film received nearly unanimous praise. Leachman played embittered, greedy, [[Slavic peoples|Slavic Canadian]] "Grandma Ida" on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', for which she won two Emmy Awards, both for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (once in 2002, then again in 2006). She was nominated for playing that same character for six consecutive years.

Later television credits include the successful [[Lifetime Television]] [[miniseries]] ''Beach Girls'' with [[Rob Lowe]] and [[Julia Ormond]]. Leachman was nominated for a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|SAG Award]] for her role as the wine-soaked, former jazz singer and grandmother Evelyn in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] feature ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]'' opposite [[Adam Sandler]] and [[T<U+00E9>a Leoni]]. She had replaced an ailing [[Anne Bancroft]] in the role. The film reunited her with her ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' writer-producer-director [[James L. Brooks]]. That same year she appeared with Sandler again, in the remake of ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]''. She also appeared in [[Kurt Russell]] comedy ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]'' as the school nurse with X-ray vision. In 2005, she guest starred as [[Charlie Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Charlie Harper]]'s neighbor Norma in an episode (#3.9 [[Two and a Half Men (season 3)|"Madame and Her Special Friend"]]) of [[Two and a Half Men]].

In 2006, Leachman's performance alongside Sir [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Annette Bening]] in the HBO special ''[[Mrs. Harris (film)|Mrs. Harris]]'' earned her an [[Emmy]] nomination for outstanding supporting actress in a miniseries or TV movie as well as an SAG Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries. On May 14, 2006, she was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts]] from [[Drake University]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Leachman was inducted into the [[Television Academy Hall of Fame]] in 2011.

===Mel Brooks films===
Leachman has appeared in three [[Mel Brooks]] films. She played ''Frau Bl<U+00FC>cher'' in ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), in which the mere mention of her character's name elicits the loud neighing of horses (an homage to a cinematic villain stereotype).<ref>{{cite web|author=Snopes.com|title=Elmer's Gantry|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/blucher.asp|date=2007-08-12|accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref> She also appeared in ''[[High Anxiety]]'' (1977) as the demented villainess, psychiatric nurse Charlotte Diesel, and as [[Madame Defarge]] in the segment of ''[[History of the World: Part I]]'' (1981) which parodied [[Charles Dickens|Dickens']] ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''.

She auditioned for a chance to revive her role from ''Young Frankenstein'' in the 2007 Broadway production opposite [[Megan Mullally]] (replacing formerly cast [[Kristin Chenoweth]]) and [[Roger Bart]]. However, [[Andrea Martin]] was cast in the role. Mel Brooks was quoted as saying that Leachman, at 81, was too old for the role. "We don't want her to die on stage", he told columnist [[Army Archerd]], at which Leachman took umbrage.<ref>{{cite web|author=World Entertainment News Network|title=Cloris Leachman Challenges Mel Brooks To A Duel To Win 'Young Frankenstein' Role High there|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/06/14/cloris_leachman_challenges_mel_brooks_to|work=Starpulse Entertainment News|date=2007-06-14|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref> However, due to Leachman's success on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (US TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', Brooks reportedly asked her to reprise her role as Frau Bl<U+00FC>cher in the Broadway production of ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'' after [[Beth Leavel]], who had succeeded Martin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/axed-dancing-star-cloris-leachman-may-reprise-frankenstein-role-1015512.php |title=Axed 'Dancing' star Cloris Leachman may reprise 'Frankenstein' role |publisher=Realitytvworld.com|date=2008-10-29|accessdate=2010-04-22}}</ref><ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Leachman_to_Go_Dancing_with_YOUNG_FRANKENSTEIN_20010101 Leachman to Go 'Dancing' with YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN?]</ref> The Broadway production closed before this could be realized.

===''Dancing With the Stars''===
Leachman was a contestant on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', and was paired with [[Corky Ballas]], the oldest of the professionals. Leachman is the oldest person to compete on the show to date.

==Personal life==
[[File:ClorisLeachmanJune09.jpg|thumb|Leachman at the June 2009 premiere for ''[[The Proposal (film)|The Proposal]]'']]
From 1953 to 1979, Leachman was married to Hollywood impresario [[George Englund]]. Leachman's former mother-in-law was character actress [[Mabel Albertson]], best known for playing Samantha Stevens' bewildered and frustrated mother-in-law on ''[[Bewitched]]''. The marriage produced five children: Bryan (died 1986), Morgan, Adam, Dinah and George Englund, Jr. Some of them are in show business. Her son Morgan played Dylan on ''[[Guiding Light]]'' throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

Leachman's son Bryan died from a drug overdose on February 25, 1986.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0257692 Bryan Englund Biography] at [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> Some reports state that it was an overdose of ulcer medication, while others, such as in the [[Lifetime Television]] program ''Intimate Portrait: Cloris Leachman'' (in which Leachman participated), state that it was from cocaine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Intimate Portrait: Cloris Leachman|url=http://www.lifetimetv.com/shows/ip/portraits/0320/0320_bio.html|publisher=[[Lifetime Television|Lifetime TV]]}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|id=0395322|title=Intimate Portrait: Cloris Leachman}}</ref> In an interview by Cal Fussman in Esquire, Jan. 2009, Leachman stated, "I've been so relieved and so grateful to not have a god to believe in."<ref>pg. 81</ref> She called herself an agnostic in an interview with ''Grandparents'' magazine.<ref>''Cloris Leachman Drives Fast, Dances Well, Adores Her Grandkids,'' March 26, 2009</ref> In 2012, Leachman said she was an atheist.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debra-ollivier/cloris-leachman-raising-hope_b_1606927.html</ref> 

The Englunds were [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] neighbors of [[Judy Garland]] and [[Sid Luft]], and of their children, Lorna and Joey Luft, during the early 1960s. [[Lorna Luft]] states in her memoir ''[[Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir]]'' that Leachman was ''"the kind of mom I'd only seen on TV"''. Knowing of the turmoil at the Garland home but never mentioning it, Leachman prepared meals for Judy's children and made them feel welcome whenever they needed a place to stay.

Leachman was also a friend of [[Marlon Brando]], whom she met while studying under [[Elia Kazan]] in the 1950s. She introduced him to her husband, who became close to Brando as well, directing him in ''[[The Ugly American]]'' and writing a memoir about their friendship called ''Marlon Brando: The Way It's Never Been Done Before'' (2005).<ref>{{cite news|title=Bad old boys|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/artsandentertainment/story/0,6000,1675436,00.html|date=2005-12-31|work=Guardian Unlimited|accessdate=2007-08-17|location=London|first=Chris|last=Petit}}</ref>

In a parody of the famous [[Demi Moore#Vanity controversy|Demi Moore]] ''Vanity Fair'' magazine cover photo, Leachman posed "au naturel" on the cover of ''Alternative Medicine Digest'' (issue 15, 1997) body-painted with images of fruit. A [[vegetarian]], Leachman also posed clad only in [[lettuce]] for a 2009 [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] advertisement.<ref>[http://www.usmagazine.com/news/first-pic-cloris-leachman-wears-nothing-but-lettuce-in-peta-ad-2009313 ''Cloris Leachman Wears Nothing But Lettuce Leaves!'']' ''US Weekly,'' March 31, 2009</ref>

Leachman's autobiography ''Cloris: My Autobiography''<ref>ISBN 978-0-7582-2963-2; ISBN 0-7582-2963-1; Publisher: Kensington</ref> was published in March 2009. She wrote the bestselling book with her former husband, George Englund.
