==History==

===Early history===
Changchun was initially established on Imperial Decree as a small Trading post and frontier village during the reign of the [[Jiajing Emperor]]. Trading activities mainly involved furs and other natural products during this period. In 1800, [[Emperor Jiaqing]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] selected a small village on the east bank of the Yitong River and named it "Changchun Ting".<ref><U+65B0><U+4EAC><U+7279><U+5225><U+5E02><U+516C><U+7F72><U+300E><U+65B0><U+4EAC><U+5E02><U+653F><U+6982><U+8981><U+300F>12-13<U+9801><U+3001><U+65B0><U+4EAC><U+5546><U+5DE5><U+516C><U+4F1A><U+520A><U+300E><U+65B0><U+4EAC><U+306E><U+6982><U+6CC1> <U+5EFA><U+56FD><U+5341><U+5468><U+5E74><U+8A18><U+5FF5><U+767C><U+520A><U+300F>1-7<U+9801><U+3001><U+300E><U+6E80><U+6D32><U+5E74><U+9451><U+300F><U+662D><U+548C>20<U+5E74><U+FF08><U+5EB7><U+5FB3>12<U+5E74><U+FF09><U+7248> 389-390<U+9801><U+3001><U+4ED6><U+3092><U+53C2><U+7167><U+3002></ref>

At the end of 18th century peasants from overpopulated provinces such as [[Shandong]] and [[Hebei]] began to settle in the region. In 1889, the village was promoted into a city known as "Changchun Fu".<ref name="History ">

===Railway era===
In May 1898, Changchun got its first railway station, located in [[Kuancheng District|Kuancheng]], part of the railway from [[Harbin]] to [[L<U+00FC>shun]] (the southern branch of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]]), constructed by the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=cctv>[http://www.cctv.com/program/lachine/20050628/101794.shtml Changchun <U+2161>- Le chemin de fer de Changchun] {{fr icon}}</ref> Soon after the completion of the railway, Changchun emerged as a major population center in Jilin province after the contemporary provincial capital [[Jilin City]].

After Russia's loss of the southernmost section of this branch as a result of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905, the Kuancheng station (Kuanchengtze, in contemporary spelling) became the last Russian station on this branch.<ref name="cctv"/> The next station just a short distance to the south<U+2014>the new "Japanese" Changchun station<U+2014>became the first station of the [[South Manchuria Railway]],<ref name=conv>"Provisional Convention ... concerning the junction of the Japanese and Russian Railways in Manchuria" - June 13, 1907. {{cite book

A special Russo-Japanese agreement of 1907 provided that [[Russian gauge]] tracks would continue from the "Russian" Kuancheng Station to the "Japanese" Changchun Station, and vice versa, tracks on the "gauge adapted by the South Manchuria Railway" (i.e. the standard gauge) would continue from Changchun Station to Kuancheng Station.<ref name=conv/>

===Changchun city planning and development from 1906-1931 ===
[[File:Changchun 1932 - Plan 2.jpg|thumb|left|City planning map of Changchun]]
The Treaty of Portsmouth formally ended the Russo-Japanese War of 1904<U+2013>05 and saw the transfer and assignment to Japan in 1906 the railway between Changchun and Port Arthur, and all the branches.<ref>Akira Koshizawa, Manchukuo Capital Planning (Jiangsu: Social Sciences Academic Press,2011), 26-97.</ref>

Having realized at length the vital importance of the geographical location of Changchun as the conjuncture of Japan, China and Russia, a mission of planners and engineers were dispatched to Changchun by Japanese Government to investigate on the spot the site for a new railway station.

Japan, without the consent of Chinese Government, did a secret purchase and grab of land from local farmers at considerable high price. Consequently, Changchun Railway Station was constructed and a leasehold of the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Areas(SMRAA) was developed near and far.<ref>Yishi Liu, <U+201C>A Pictorial History of Changchun, 1898-1962,<U+201D> Cross Current 5, (2012): 	191-217.</ref> In order to turn Changchun into a stronghold for pillaging agricultural and mineral resources of Manchuria, Japan started to blueprint the master plan of Changchun and invested heavily on the urban construction of the city.

As the prelude and preparation of invasion and long-lasting occupation of China, Japan initiated at the beginning of 1907 the planning programme of the SMRAA which embodied distinctive colonial characteristics. The guiding ideology of the overall design was to build a high standard colonial city with sophisticated facilities, multiple functions and large scale.

The comprehensive plan was to meet the needs of:
*Comfort demand of Japanese employees at Manchurian Railways
*Assurances of Changchun to be a base for Japanese control of the whole Manchuria
*Effective counterweight of Russia in this part of China.

Accordingly, nearly 7 million [[Yen]] on average was allocated on a year-to-year basis for urban planning and construction during the period of 1907-31.<ref name="Akira Koshizawa 2011">Akira Koshizawa, Manchukuo Capital Planning (Jiangsu: Social Sciences Academic Press,2011), 26-97</ref>

Railway nexus status was thickly underlined in the planning and construction, the main design concepts of which read as follows: under conventional grid pattern terms, two geoplagiotropic boulevards were newly carved eastward and westward from the grand square of the new railway station. The two helped forming two intersections with the gridded prototypes, which led to two circles of South and West. The two sub-civic centres served as axis on which eight radial roads were blazed that took the shape of a sectoral structure.

This kind of radial circles and the design concept of urban roads were at that time quite advanced and scientific. It activated to great extend the serious urban landscapes as well as a clearly identification of the traditional gridded pattern.

With the new Changchun railway station as its centre, the urban plan divided the SMRAA into such rectangles as residential quarters of 15%, commerce of 33%, grain depot of 19%, factories of 12%, public entertainment of 9% and administrative organs(including Japanese garrison) of 12%.<ref name="Akira Koshizawa 2011"/> Each block provided the railway station with supporting and systematic services in the light of its own functions.

In the meantime, a comprehensive system of judiciary and military police was established which was totally independent of China. This accounted for the widespread domain of military facilities within the urban construction area of 3. 967k<U+33A1><U+FF0C>such as railway garrison, gendarmerie, police department and its 18 local police stations.<ref name="Akira Koshizawa 2011"/>

Perceiving Changchun as a tabula rasa upon which to erect new and sweeping conceptions of the built environment, Japanese used the city as a practical laboratory to create two distinct and idealized urban milieus, each appropriate to a particular era. From 1906 to 1931 Changchun served as a key railway town through which the Japanese orchestrated informal empire; between 1932 and 1945 the city became home to a grandiose, new Asian capital. Yet while the facades the town and later the capital<U+2014>as well as the attitudes of the state they upheld<U+2014>contrasted markedly, the shifting styles of planning and architecture consistently attempted to represent Japanese rule as progressive, beneficent, and modern.

Behind the development of Changchun, in addition to the railway trade driven, it suggested an important period of the Northeast modern architectural culture reflecting the urban design endeavours and revealing Japanese ambition of invading and occupying China. Japanese architecture and culture had been widely applied to Manchukuo to highlight the special status of the Japanese puppet. Once again, the urban planning will and should stem from a culture, be it aggressive or creative. Changchun<U+2019>s planning and construction process can serve as a good example.

Changchun expanded rapidly as the junction between of the Japanese-owned [[South Manchurian Railway]] and the Russian-owned [[Chinese Eastern Railway]], while remaining the [[break of gauge]] point between the Russian and standard gauges into the 1930s,<ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov06_08Rail-t1-body-d8-d6.html Yesterday and To-day], The New Zealand Railways Magazine, Volume 6, Issue 8 (April 1, 1932.)</ref> until the Chinese Eastern Railway itself was bought by [[Manchukuo]] and converted to the standard gauge in the mid-1930s. Changchun had railway repair shops, and branch lines originating in Changchun extended into [[Korea]] and [[Inner Mongolia]].

===Manchukuo and World War II===
On March 10, 1932 the capital of [[Manchukuo]], a Japan-controlled puppet state in [[Manchuria]], was established in Changchun.<ref name="<U+56FD><U+52D9><U+9662><U+5E03><U+544A><U+7B2C>1<U+53F7>"><U+5927><U+540C><U+5143><U+5E74>4<U+6708>1<U+65E5><U+56FD><U+52D9><U+9662><U+4F48><U+544A><U+7B2C>1<U+53F7><U+300C><U+6E80><U+6D32><U+56FD><U+56FD><U+90FD><U+30F2><U+9577><U+6625><U+30CB><U+5960><U+30E0><U+300D><U+FF08><U+5927><U+540C><U+5143><U+5E74>3<U+6708>10<U+65E5><U+FF09></ref> The city was then renamed '''Hsinking''' ({{zh|c=[[:zh:<U+65B0><U+4EAC>|<U+65B0><U+4EAC>]]|hp=X<U+012B>nj<U+012B>ng|w=Hsin-ching}}; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]:{{Nihongo|||Shinky<U+014D>|lead=yes}}; literally "New Capital") on March 13.<ref name="<U+56FD><U+52D9><U+9662><U+5E03><U+544A><U+7B2C>2<U+53F7>"><U+5927><U+540C><U+5143><U+5E74>4<U+6708>1<U+65E5><U+56FD><U+52D9><U+9662><U+4F48><U+544A><U+7B2C>2<U+53F7><U+300C><U+56FD><U+90FD><U+9577><U+6625><U+30F2><U+65B0><U+4EAC><U+30C8><U+547D><U+540D><U+30B9><U+300D><U+FF08><U+5927><U+540C><U+5143><U+5E74>3<U+6708>14<U+65E5><U+FF09></ref> The Emperor [[Puyi]] resided in the Imperial Palace ({{zh|c=<U+5E1D><U+5BAE>|hp=D<U+00EC> g<U+014D>ng|links=no}}) which is now the [[Wei Huang Gong|Museum of the Manchu State Imperial Palace]]. During the Manchukuo period, the region experienced harsh suppression, brutal warfare on the civilian population, forced conscription and labor and other Japanese sponsored government brutalities; at the same time a rapid industrialisation and militarisation took place. Hsinking was a well-planned city with broad avenues and modern public works. The city underwent rapid expansion in both its economy and infrastructure. Many of buildings built during the Japanese colonial era still stand today, including those of the Eight Major Bureaus of Manchukuo ({{zh|c=[[:zh:<U+516B><U+5927><U+90E8>|<U+516B><U+5927><U+90E8>]]|hp=B<U+0101>d<U+00E0> b<U+00F9>|links=no}}) as well as the Headquarters of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]].

In accordance with the Metropolitan Plan of Great Hsinking, the area of publicly shared land (including the Imperial Palace, government offices, roads, parks and athletic grounds) in Hsinking was {{convert|47|km2|abbr=on}}, whilst the area of residential, commercial and industrial developments was planned to be {{convert|53|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref><U+65B0><U+4EAC><U+7279><U+5225><U+5E02><U+516C><U+7F72><U+300E><U+65B0><U+4EAC><U+5E02><U+653F><U+6982><U+8981><U+300F>6<U+9801></ref><U+3002> However, Hsinking's population exceeded the prediction of 500,000 by 1940.

Evans, "Ginseng: Root of Chinese-Canadian Relations," ''Canadian Historical Review'' (1985) 66#1 pp 1-26</ref> In the dish ''Ginseng Chicken'', ginseng is placed inside a less-than-one-year-old chicken. Another local favorite is chicken cooked with [[Maotai]] wine, which adds the famous Chinese liquor Maotai to flavor the dish. Many of Changchun's local dishes are a fusion of Korean and Chinese recipes since Changchun has a big Korean minority population.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}

In Changchun, deer tail is considered a fine delicacy and an aphrodisiac. Many a wedding night involves the consumption of these once fluffy tails.
