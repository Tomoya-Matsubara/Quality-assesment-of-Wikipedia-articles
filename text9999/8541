A '''trolleybus''' (also known as '''trolley [[bus]]''', '''trolley coach''', '''trackless trolley''', '''trackless tram''' or '''trolley''') is an [[electric bus]] that draws its [[electricity]] from overhead wires (generally suspended from roadside posts) using spring-loaded [[trolley pole]]s. Two wires and poles are required to complete the electrical circuit, unlike a [[tram|tram or streetcar]], which normally uses the track as part of the electrical path and thus needs only one wire and pole.

==Background==

The history of the trolleybus dates back to 29 April 1882, when Dr. [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]] ran his "[[Elektromote]]" in a Berlin suburb. This experimental demonstration continued until 13 June 1882, after which there was little progress in Europe, although separate experiments were conducted in the USA. The next development was when [[Lombard G<U+00E9>rin]] operated an experimental line at the [[Paris Exhibition of 1900]] after four years of trials. [[Max Schiemann]] made the biggest step when on 10 July 1901 the world's first passenger-carrying trolleybus operated at Bielathal (near [[Dresden]]), in Germany. Schiemann built and operated the Bielathal system, and is credited with developing the under-running trolley current collection system, with two horizontally parallel overhead wires and rigid trolleypoles spring-loaded to hold them up to the wires. Although the Bielathal system operated only until 1904, Schiemann had developed what is now the standard trolleybus current collection system. In the early days there were a few different methods of current collection. The Cedes-Stoll system, designed by Carl Stoll, operated near Dresden between 1902 and 1904, and in [[Vienna]].  The Lloyd-K<U+00F6>hler or Bremen system was tried out in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], and the [[:it:Filovia|Filovia]] was demonstrated near [[Milan]].

[[Leeds]] and [[Bradford]] became the first cities to operate trolleybuses in the United Kingdom on 20 June 1911. Bradford was also the last to operate trolleybuses in the UK, the system closing on 26 March 1972. The last rear-entrance trolleybus in Britain was also in Bradford and is now owned by the [[Bradford Trolleybus Association]]. [[Birmingham]] was the first to replace a tram route with trolleybuses, while [[Wolverhampton]] under the direction of Charles Owen Silvers turned the "trackless tram" into the trolleybus. There were 50 trolleybus systems in the UK, [[London]]'s being the largest. By the time trolleybuses arrived in Britain in 1911, the Schiemann system was well-established and was the most common, although the short-lived [[Stockport]] operation used the Lloyd-K<U+00F6>lher system and [[Keighley]] used the Cedes-Stoll system.

In the United States, some cities, led by the [[Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation]] (BMT&mdash;New York), subscribed to the [[all-four]] concept of using buses, trolleybuses, [[tram]]s (in US called ''streetcars'' or ''trolleys'') and [[rapid transit]] subway and/or elevated lines (metros), as appropriate, for routes ranging from lightly-used to the heaviest trunk line. Buses and trolleybuses in particular were seen as entry systems that could later be upgraded to rail as appropriate. Although the BMT in [[Brooklyn]] built only one trolleybus line, other cities, notably [[San Francisco, California]] and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], built larger systems and still maintain "all-four".

A number of trolleybus lines in the United States came into existence when a tracked trolley/tram route did not have sufficient ridership to warrant track maintenance or reconstruction. In a similar manner, a proposed tram scheme in Leeds, United Kingdom, was changed to a trolleybus scheme to cut costs.<ref>{{cite web

Trolleybuses are uncommon today in North America, but they remain common in many European countries, and in Russia and China, generally occupying the niche between street railways (trams) and diesel buses.  Worldwide, around 340 cities or metropolitan areas are served by trolleybuses today.<ref name ="Jane's2008">Webb, Mary (ed.) (2008), ''Jane's Urban Transport Systems 2008-2009''.

==Advantages==
[[Image:San Francisco Nob Hill 2.jpg|thumb|175px|A [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|San Francisco Muni]] trolleybus climbing [[Nob Hill]]]]

Trolleybuses are advantageous on hilly routes, as [[electric motor]]s are more effective than [[diesel engine]]s for climbing steep hills. Unlike combustion engines, electric motors draw power from a central plant and can be overloaded for several minutes without damage. [[San Francisco]] and [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], both hilly United States cities, use trolleybuses partly for this reason, another being improved air quality. Given their acceleration and braking performance, trolleybuses easily outperform diesel buses on flat stretches as well.

Trolleybuses' [[rubber]] [[tire]]s have better [[adhesion]] than trams' steel wheels on steel rails, giving them better hill-climbing capability and braking. Unlike rail vehicles (where side tracks are not available), an out-of-service vehicle can be moved to the side of the road and its trolley poles disconnected, allowing other vehicles to pass. Additionally, because they are not tracked, trolleybuses can pull over to the curb as a diesel bus does, eliminating boarding islands in the street.

Like other [[electric vehicle]]s, trolleybuses are more environmentally friendly than [[fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] or [[hydrocarbon]]-based vehicles ([[Gasoline|petrol/gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[alcohol]], etc.). However the power is not free, having to be produced at centralised [[power plant]]s, with attendant transmission losses.

On the other hand, centrally-produced power is produced more efficiently, not bound to a specific fuel source and more amenable to pollution control as a single-source supply than are individual vehicles with their own engines that exhaust noxious gases and [[particulate]]s at street level. Moreover, some cities, like [[Calgary, Alberta]], run their  [[light rail]] networks using wind energy,<ref>[http://www.re-energy.ca/ridethewind/backgrounder.shtml Wind Energy Background]</ref> which is effectively emission-free once the turbines are built and installed. Other cities like [[Vancouver|Vancouver, B.C.]] use hydroelectricity to provide power for trolley buses. A further advantage of trolleybuses is that they can generate electricity from [[kinetic energy]] while braking, a process known as [[regenerative braking]].

Unlike buses or trams, trolleybuses are almost silent, lacking the noise of a diesel engine or wheels on rails. Such noise as there is tends to emanate from auxiliary systems such as power steering pumps and air conditioning. Early trolleybuses without these systems were even quieter, and in the UK at least were often referred to as the "Silent Service". The quietness did have its disadvantages though, with quite a number of pedestrians falling victim to what was also known as "the Silent Death".

Trolleybuses are specially favoured where [[electricity]] is abundant and cheap. Examples are the extensive systems in Vancouver, Canada and [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], USA, both of which draw [[hydroelectric]] power from the [[Columbia River]] and other Pacific river systems. Seattle benefits doubly, with steep gradients near the [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|Downtown]] [[dockland|waterfront]] and on [[Queen Anne, Seattle, Washington|Queen Anne]], [[First Hill, Seattle, Washington|First]], and [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]]s.  San Francisco operates its system using hydro power from the city-owned [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir|Hetch Hetchy]] generating plant.

Trolleybuses are used extensively in large European cities such as [[Athens]], [[Belgrade]], [[Bratislava]], [[Bucharest]], [[Budapest]], [[Kiev]], [[Lyon]], [[Milan]], [[Minsk]], [[Moscow]], [[Naples]], [[Riga]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Sofia]], as well as smaller ones such as [[Arnhem trolleybus|Arnhem]], [[Bergen]], [[Brasov]], [[Brest (Belarus)]], [[Coimbra]], [[Gdynia]], [[Lausanne]], [[Limoges]], [[Luzern]], [[Parma]], [[Piatra Neam<U+0163>]], [[Plze<U+0148>]], [[Pre<U+0161>ov]], [[Salzburg]], [[Solingen]], [[Szeged]], [[Tallinn]] and [[Yalta]].

Realising the advantages of these [[zero-emission vehicle]]s, some other European cities have started to expand their systems again. Other cities such as [[Lecce]] will introduce new trolleybus systems.

In [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], the trolleybus system has survived because [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard Station]] has a tunnel that was once used for trams that requires left-side doors and has fume concerns. Buses also use the tunnel, but the trolleybuses remain due to popular support.

==Disadvantages==
Re-routings, temporary or permanent, are not usually readily available outside of "downtown" areas where the buses may be re-routed via adjacent business area streets where other trolleybus routes operate. This problem was highlighted in Vancouver in early 2008 when an explosion closed Broadway, a heavily-used trolley route. Because of the closure, trolleys were forced to detour several kilometers off their route in order to stay on the wires, leaving major portions of their routes unserved and trolleys well off schedule.

Some trolleybus systems have been criticised for aesthetic reasons, with city residents complaining that the jumble of overhead wires was unsightly.<ref>[http://www.tbus.org.uk/overhead.htm Overhead]</ref>  Intersections often have a "webbed ceiling" appearance, due to multiple crossing and converging sets of line wires.

Dewirements sometimes occur, leaving the bus stranded without power, although this is relatively rare on systems with well-maintained overhead wire, hangers, fittings and "contact shoes".

Trolleybuses cannot overtake one another in regular service unless two separate sets of wires with a switch are provided or the vehicles are equipped with off-wire capability, but the latter is an increasingly common feature of new trolleybuses.

==Recent power developments==

With the introduction of hybrid designs, trolleybuses are no longer tied to overhead wires.  Since the 1980s, trolleybus systems such as [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|Muni]] in San Francisco, [[TransLink (Vancouver)|TransLink]] in Vancouver and [[Beijing]], among others, have purchased trolleybuses equipped with batteries to allow the vehicles to operate short to considerably long distances away from the wires. [[Supercapacitor]]s may be also used to move short distances.

Trolleybuses can optionally be equipped either with limited off-wire capability&mdash;a small diesel engine or battery pack&mdash;for auxiliary or emergency use only, or full [[dual-mode bus|dual-mode capability]].  A simple auxiliary power unit can allow a trolleybus to get around a route blockage or can reduce the amount (or complexity) of overhead wiring needed at operating garages (depots).  This capability has become increasingly common in newer trolleybuses, particularly in North America and Western Europe, where the vast majority of new trolleybuses delivered since the 1990s are fitted with at least limited off-wire capability.  These have gradually replaced older trolleybuses which lacked such capability. In [[Philadelphia]], new trolleybuses (known as "trackless trolleys" there) that were placed in service by [[SEPTA]] in 2008 are equipped with small [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] diesel-electric power units for operating short distances off-wire, instead of using  a conventional diesel drive train or battery-only system for their off-wire movement.<ref>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 267 (May-June 2006), p. 71. National Trolleybus Assn. (UK).</ref>

[[King County Metro]] in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] use or have used [[dual-mode bus]]es that run on electric power from overhead wires on a fixed right-of-way and on [[Diesel engine|diesel]] power on city streets.  Metro used special-order articulated [[Societ<U+00E0> Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] buses with the center axle driven electrically and the rear (third) axle driven using a conventional power pack, with electricity used for clean operation in the [[King_County_Metro#Downtown_Seattle_Transit_Tunnel|downtown transit tunnel]]. They were introduced in 1990 and retired in 2005, replaced with cleaner hybrid buses, although 59 of 236 had their diesel propulsion equipment removed and continue (as of 2010) in trolley bus service on non-tunnel routes.  MBTA uses dual-mode buses on its new (2004-opened) [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line (Waterfront)]].  

==Other considerations==

With increasing diesel fuel costs and particulate matter and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions problems in many cities, trolleybuses may be seen as the best option, either as the primary transit mode or as a supplement to rapid transit and commuter rail networks.

Some have suggested that the trolleybus will become obsolete in a future [[hydrogen economy]], but direct electric transmission is far more efficient (by a factor of two or more) than conversion of energy into [[hydrogen]], transportation and storage of the hydrogen and its conversion back into electricity by [[fuel cell]]s.

As trolleybuses are electric, they produce very little noise compared with a diesel- or petrol-engined vehicle.  While this is mainly seen as a benefit, it does also make it is easier for unobservant pedestrians and other motorists to miss hearing a trolleybus when crossing a street, and risk being struck. For this reason, in Australia trolleybuses were sometimes known as "whispering death".

Trolleybuses can share overhead wires and other electrical infrastructure (such as substations) with tramways. This can result in cost savings when trolleybuses are added to a transport system that already has trams, though this refers only to potential savings over the cost of installing and operating trolleybuses alone.

==Trolleybus wire switch==
Trolleybus wire switches (referred to as "frogs" in some countries) are used where a trolleybus line branches into two.  A switch may be either in a "straight through" or "turnout" position; it normally remains in the "straight through" position unless it has been triggered, and reverts to it after a few seconds.  Triggering is often caused by a pair of contacts or [[electromagnets]], with one attached to each trolleybus wire, close to but before the switch itself.

Multiple branches may be handled by installing more than one switch.  For example, to provide straight-through, left-turn or right-turn branches at an intersection, one switch is installed some distance from the intersection to choose a line over the left-turn lane, and another switch is mounted close to the intersection to choose between straight through and a right turn.<ref name="transport2000">[http://web.archive.org/web/20060303075510/http://www.vcn.bc.ca/t2000bc/learning/etb/electric_vehicles.html Electric Vehicle Technologies]. [[Transport 2000 Canada|Transport 2000 BC]]. Archived from [http://www.vcn.bc.ca/t2000bc/learning/etb/electric_vehicles.html the original] on 2006-03-03.</ref>  (This would be the arrangement in countries such as the US, where [[traffic directionality]] is right-handed; in left-handed traffic countries such as Britain and New Zealand, the switch some distance from the intersection would be used to access the right-turn lanes, and the switch close to the intersection would be for the left-turn fork instead.)

Three common types of switch<ref name="transport2000"/> exist: Power-on/Power-off (the picture of a switch above is of this type), Selectric, and Fahslabend.

A Power-on/Power-off switch is triggered if the trolleybus is drawing power from the overhead wires, usually by accelerating, when the poles pass over the contacts.  (The contacts are lined up on the wires in this case.) If the trolleybus "coasts" through the switch it will not activate. Some trolleybuses, such as those in Philadelphia, have a "power-coast" toggle switch that turns the power on or off. This allows a switch to be triggered in situations that would otherwise be impossible, such as activating a switch while braking or accelerating through a switch without activating it.

A Selectric switch has a similar design, but the contacts on the wires are skewed, often at a 45-degree angle, rather than being lined up.  This skew means that a bus going straight through will not trigger the switch, but a trolleybus attempting a sharp turn (usually a right turn in countries with right-handed traffic) will cause its poles to meet the wires in a matching skew with one pole ahead of the other, which will trigger the switch.

For a [[Fahslabend]] switch, the trolleybus's turn indicator (or a separate driver-controlled switch) causes a coded radio signal to be sent from a transmitter, often attached to a trolley pole.  The receiver is attached to the switch, and causes it to trigger if the correct code is received.  This has the advantage that the driver does not need to be accelerating the bus (as with a Power-on/Power-off switch) or trying to make a sharp turn (as with a Selectric switch).

==Double-decker trolleybuses==

Since the end of 1997, no double-decker trolleybuses have been in service anywhere in the world, but in the past several manufacturers made such vehicles. Most builders of double-deck trolleybuses were in the [[United Kingdom]], but there were a few, usually solitary, instances of such trolleybuses being built in other countries, including in Germany by [[Henschel & Son|Henschel]] (for Hamburg); in Italy by [[Lancia]] (for Porto, Portugal); in Russia by the Yaroslavl motor plant (for Moscow) and in Spain by Maquitrans (for Barcelona).<ref name="Murray"/>  British manufacturers of double-deck trolleybuses included AEC, BUT, Crossley, Guy, Leyland, Karrier, Sunbeam and others.<ref name="Murray"/>

In 2001, [[Citybus (Hong Kong)]] converted a [[Dennis Dragon]] (#701) into a [[Double-decker bus|double-decker]] trolleybus,<ref name="tm238hk">''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 238 (July-August 2001), pp. 73 and 88.</ref> and it was tested on a 300-metre track in Wong Chuk Hang in that year.<ref name="tm238hk"/> Hong Kong decided not to build a trolleybus system, and the testing of this prototype did not lead to any further production of vehicles.

==Use and preservation==
There are currently around 340 cities or metropolitan areas where trolleybuses are operated,<ref name ="Jane's2008"/>  and almost 500 additional trolleybus systems have existed in the past.<ref name="Murray">Murray, Alan (2000). ''World Trolleybus Encyclopaedia''. Yateley, Hampshire, UK: Trolleybooks. ISBN 0-904235-18-1.</ref>  For complete lists of trolleybus systems by location, with dates of opening and (where applicable) closure, see [[List of trolleybus systems]] and the related lists indexed there.

The following are summary notes about current and past trolleybus operation in some countries.
{{dynamic list}}

===Argentina===
Trolleybuses are currently in use in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Rosario]] and [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Argentina|C<U+00F3>rdoba]]. See also [[List_of_trolleybus_systems#South_America|List of trolleybus systems]].

===Armenia===
Trolleybus lines run in [[Yerevan]], Armenia.

===Australia===
Australia has no remaining operating trolleybuses.  Trolleybuses are preserved in the [[Brisbane Tramway Museum]], [[Sydney Tramway Museum]], [[Powerhouse Museum]] (Sydney), the Australian Electric Transport Museum at Adelaide (South Australia), the Perth Electric Tramway Society Museum, and at the Tasmanian Transport Museum in Hobart.  Some of these trolleybuses are in operating condition, but there are no wired roadways to operate them on.

===Austria===
The largest trolleybus system in Austria is in [[Salzburg]], with nine routes and 80 trolleybuses, operating from 0600 to midnight. The system was introduced in 1940 and has been expanded during recent years. [[Linz]] has four routes and 19 vehicles: after years of uncertainty the continued existence of the system is guaranteed by the operator. The trolleybuses in [[Innsbruck]] went out of service in 2007 because of an expected expansion of the [[light rail]] system. A trolleybus system with two routes existed in [[Kapfenberg]] until 2002. The towns of [[Klagenfurt]] and [[Graz]] closed their trolleybus systems in the 1960s.

The trolleybus system in [[Minsk]] (since 1952) is the second largest in the world.  Trolleybuses also work in [[Brest (Belarus)|Brest]], [[Vitebsk]], [[Gomel]], [[Grodno]], [[Mogilev]] and [[Babruysk]] (since 1978).

===Belgium===
No trolleybus systems remain in operation in Belgium, but in the past, trolleybuses provided a portion of the local transport service in [[Antwerp]], [[Brussels]], [[Li<U+00E8>ge]] and [[Ghent]].<ref name="Murray"/> The last system, that of Ghent, which ceased operation in June 2009,<ref>Isgar, Carl. "Farewell to Gent's Trolleybuses". ''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 288 (November-December 2009), pp. 126-131. National Trolleybus Assn. (UK).</ref> had opened much later than all of the other Belgian trolleybus systems, in 1989.  Government funds to build the Ghent system were provided, in part, for the purpose of improving the prospects for the export of Belgian-built trolleybuses,<ref name="Murray"/> and the Ghent system's fleet was made up entirely of trolleybuses built by [[Van Hool]], a Belgian company.  The Brussels system comprised only a single route (the 54), in contrast to that city's large [[Brussels trams|tram]] system.  Li<U+00E8>ge had two independent trolleybus systems. One of them, a small system connecting Li<U+00E8>ge to the suburb of [[Seraing]],  operated the world's only double-ended (bi-directional) trolleybuses; the vehicles were eventually rebuilt to conventional (single-ended) configuration.<ref name="Murray"/> One of those unique vehicles, restored to double-ended configuration, is preserved at the ''Mus<U+00E9>e des Transports en commun du Pays de Li<U+00E8>ge''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Corteil, A. and Roubinet, J.-M|title=Le trolleybus de Seraing (1936-1963)|language=French|url=http://www.trams-trolleybus.be/Trolleybus10.html|accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref>  Trolleybuses from the other Li<U+00E8>ge system and from Brussels and Ghent are preserved at various museums, including 1932-built Li<U+00E8>ge 425 at the [[The Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft|Sandtoft museum]], in England.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Trolleybuses are currently used only in the capital city [[Sarajevo]]. Operation and maintenance is done by GRAS (City transportation). There are seven routes (101-107): the route to the suburb of [[Vogo<U+0161><U+0107>a]] will be reconstructed in the near future.

Trolleybuses are in use only in [[Santos (S<U+00E3>o Paulo)|Santos]] and in systems in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (city)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]]: [[SPTrans]], in central and eastern areas, and [[Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de S<U+00E3>o Paulo|EMTU]], in the suburbs and the cities of [[Santo Andr<U+00E9>, S<U+00E3>o Paulo|Santo Andr<U+00E9>]], [[S<U+00E3>o Bernardo do Campo]], [[Mau<U+00E1>]] and [[Diadema, S<U+00E3>o Paulo|Diadema]]. Two trolleybuses are preserved and exhibited at the SPTrans (S<U+00E3>o Paulo Transportation Authority) Museum Gaetano Ferrola. Another five trolleybuses built by CMTC and Villares between 1958 and 1965 are awaiting restoration in the SPTrans garage at Santa Rita. A trolleybus built in the [[United States]] by ACF Brill in 1948 was restored in 1999 and operates at special celebrations, such as the city's 454th anniversary celebration on 25 January 2008.

===Bulgaria===
Trolleybus networks operate in [[Sofia]] (since 1941), [[Plovdiv]] (1955), [[Pleven]] (1985), [[Varna]] (1986), [[Stara Zagora]] (1988), [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] (1988), [[Sliven]] (1988), [[Vratsa]] (1988), [[Dobrich]] (1988), [[Pernik]] (1989), [[Gabrovo]] (1990), [[Haskovo]] (1990), [[Veliko Tarnovo]] (1990), [[Burgas]] (1991) and [[Pazardzhik]] (1993). The most developed system in terms of density is in Pleven (population 120,000), with 14 trolleybus routes, totalling {{convert|75|km}}, and one bus route. The largest system is in Sofia (population 1.5 million): {{convert|105|km}}.

===Canada===

Several other Canadian cities have operated trolleybus systems in the past. In Hamilton, where they were referred to as "trolley coaches", they were used from 1951 until the end of 1992.  Toronto initially had an experimental fleet of 4 trolleybuses from 1922 through 1927, but later maintained a fleet of about 150 vehicles from 1947 through 1992.  Another forty trolleybuses leased from Edmonton continued operation in Toronto until the lease expired and the buses were returned to Edmonton in July 1993. Most of Canada's other trolleybus systems were abandoned during the 1960s and 1970s; the last two to disappear at that time (Saskatoon and Calgary) closed down in 1974 and 1975, respectively.<ref>[http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/saskatoon-sk.html] [http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/calgary-ab.html]</ref>

The [[Transit Museum Society]], in [[Vancouver]], has preserved at least five trolleybuses retired from service on that city's trolleybus system, and some are maintained in running condition for occasional operation on the system, in cooperation with the transit agency [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]].

===Chile===
[[Image:Trolleybuses in Valparaiso.JPG|thumb|150px|rightTrolleybus|Various trolleybuses in [[Valpara<U+00ED>so|Valpara<U+00ED>so, Chile]]]]
[[Valpara<U+00ED>so]], one of the largest cities of Chile, has the only trolleybus service currently, and it is managed by a private company, Trolebuses de Chile S.A. (formerly Empresa de Transportes Colectivos El<U+00E9>ctricos). The single route is numbered 802 in the regional transport scheme and is about 5 km in length. The fleet is a distinctive mix of old American, Swiss and Chinese vehicles. The most famous vehicles are the [[Pullman Company|Pullman-Standard]]s, built in 1946-52, which are the oldest trolleybuses still in service anywhere in the world.<ref>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 281 (September-October 2008), p. 110.</ref> They were declared national monuments in 2003.<ref>''La Estrella'' (Chilean newspaper), 29 July 2003  [http://www.estrellavalpo.cl/site/edic/20030729102025/pags/20030729122931.html "Quince troles porte<U+00F1>os son monumentos hist<U+00F3>ricos''] (in Spanish), among other sources.</ref> The company has faced fierce competition from bus operators, and has almost faced bankruptcy several times, but many Valpara<U+00ED>so inhabitants feel an emotional link to the service, and vigorously defend the trolleybuses.

===China===
:''See also: [[List_of_trolleybus_systems#Asia|List of trolleybus systems]] and [[Transport in the People's Republic of China|Transportation in China]]''
Trolleybuses are in use in [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Wuhan]], [[Qingdao]], [[Hangzhou]] and other locations. Beijing's trolleybus system, the most extensive in China, is served by trolleybuses that can run for considerable distances on battery power. In Shanghai, new electric buses have been ordered to replace certain trolleybus routes. These buses charge at terminals and stops and run from the electric power stored in supercapacitors.

===Colombia===
Trolleybuses systems were operated in [[Medell<U+00ED>n]] from 1929 to 1951 and in [[Bogot<U+00E1>]] (where the service was managed by the district government) from 1948 until 1991.<ref name="Murray"/>  Among the problems leading to the closure of the Bogot<U+00E1> system were the difficulty of obtaining spare parts for the Russian-built [[Trolza|ZIU]] and Romanian-built [[Rocar DAC|DAC]] trolleybuses that comprised the entire fleet in the system's last several years of operation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Czech Republic===
The Czech Republic has 13 trolleybus systems, in towns both large and small, and in the past trolleybuses also operated in three other cities.  See [[List_of_trolleybus_systems#Czech_Republic|List of trolleybus systems]] for details.

There also was a line between [[Ostrov (Karlovy Vary District)|Ostrov nad Oh<U+0159><U+00ED>]] and [[J<U+00E1>chymov]], taking advantage of steep gradients between these towns, used only for testing trolleybuses made at the [[<U+0160>koda Works|<U+0160>koda]] factory in Ostrov. The line was dismantled in 2004, following the cessation of production.

===Estonia===
[[Image:SolarisT18ACInTallinn.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Solaris T18AC in Tallinn]]
Trolleybuses are in use in [[Tallinn]]. The first trolleybus route opened on 6 July 1965. There were nine routes, but one closed on 31 March 2000 - the overhead wires remain in place. There has been talk about a tenth line but this has never been brought to reality.

Old Skoda 14Tr and 15Tr trolleybuses are being replaced with newer low-floor Solaris/Ganz T12 and T18 [[Articulated bus|articulated]] models.

There are eight trolleybus routes in [[Belgrade]]. Three of them are variations of the original line established shortly after World War II with Russian-made vehicles, with the same terminus in the heart of old [[downtown]] next to the [[Kalemegdan]] fortress. Another is a completely independent line built perpendicular to the other three in the early 1980s.  The fleet had 154 operable trolleybuses as of December 2005.<ref>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 266 (March-April 2006), p. 42.</ref>

===Slovakia===
The first trolleybus system connected Poprad with Star<U+00FD> Smokovec from 1904 to 1906. The second trolleybus system was built in 1909 in [[Bratislava]], but served only until 1915. The route led to the hilly recreational area of <U+017D>elezn<U+00E1> studienka and the trolleybuses' motors were fed by a four-wheel bogie running on top of the wires and connected to the vehicle by a cable. Trolleybuses in Bratislava were reintroduced in 1943, with standard trolley poles. In 1962 trolleybuses were introduced in [[Pre<U+0161>ov]]. [[Bansk<U+00E1> Bystrica]] introduced trolleybuses in 1989, [[Ko<U+0161>ice]] in 1993 and [[<U+017D>ilina]] in 1994. All trolleybuses were made by [[<U+0160>koda Works|<U+0160>koda]].

===Spain===

Earlier, at least 12 trolleybus systems existed in Spain;<ref name="Murray"/>  see [[List of trolleybus systems in Spain|list]].  While most were urban systems, there were also some interurban lines, including a 33-km route from [[A Coru<U+00F1>a]] to Carballo and a 12-km route from [[Tarragona]] to Reus.<ref name="Murray"/>  Until the opening of the second Castell<U+00F3>n system, in 2008, the last Spanish system to operate had been the one in [[Pontevedra]], which closed in 1989.<ref name="Murray"/>  In the 1960s and 1970s, more than 100 secondhand British double-deck trolleybuses operated on various Spanish systems.<ref name="patton">Patton, Brian (2004). ''Double-Deck Trolleybuses of the World, beyond the British Isles'', p. 80. Sutherland (UK): Adam Gordon. ISBN 1-8744-2250-8.</ref>

===Sweden===
In [[Landskrona]], a single trolleybus route connects the railway station and the wharf area. The system opened in 2003 and employs three trolleybuses,<ref>Brown, Terry.  "Trolleybuses in Sweden, Once Again". ''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 253, Jan.-Feb. 2004, p. 14.</ref> making it one of the world's smallest systems.  Forty years earlier trolleybus systems existed in [[Gothenburg|G<U+00F6>teborg]] and [[Stockholm]], the latter a large system with 12 routes.<ref name="Murray"/>

Trolleybuses are in use in cities including [[Lausanne]] (10 lines), [[Lucerne]] (7 lines), [[Geneva]] (6 lines), [[Zurich]] (6 lines), [[Berne]] (5 lines), [[St. Gallen]] (4 lines), [[Neuch<U+00E2>tel]] (4 lines), [[Winterthur]] (4 lines), [[Fribourg]] (3 lines), [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]] (3 lines), [[Biel]] (2 lines), [[Schaffhausen]] (1 line), [[Vevey]]-[[Montreux]] (1 line).

The last trolleybus ran in [[Lugano]] in June 2001<ref>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 239 (September-October 2001), p. 119.</ref> and in [[Basel]] on 30 June 2008.<ref>Basler Verkehrsbetriebe: [http://www.bvb.ch/23-06-08_adieu_trolleybus.pdf Adieu Trolleybus], Press statement dated 23 June 2008</ref> These are the only urban networks that have been closed in Switzerland.

In Lausanne, the Association R<U+00E9>troBus has preserved several vintage trolleybuses, the oldest example being a 1932 [[Franz Brozincevic Wetzikon|FBW]],<ref>Stubbs, Tim. "Trolleybus Preservation in Switzerland". ''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 281 (September-October 2008), pp. 101<U+2013>102.</ref> and operates them periodically on public excursions, especially on summer weekends.

===Ukraine===
:''See also: [[List of trolleybus systems in Ukraine]]''
Trolleybus systems run in more than 25 cities, including the interurban [[Crimea]]n network connecting [[Simferopol]] with [[Alushta]] and [[Yalta]] on the coast. The [[Crimean Trolleybus|Crimean trolleybus]] network includes the longest trolleybus route in the world,<ref name="Murray"/> the 86-km (54&nbsp;mi.) route from Yalta to Simferopol.<ref>Makewell, Roy. "Trolleybuses Over the Yaila Mountains". ''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 193 (January-February 1994), pp. 2-16. National Trolleybus Assn. (UK).</ref>

No trolleybus systems are in operation, but a new [[Leeds Trolleybus|Leeds trolleybus]] system is planned, and the project was given preliminary government approval and funding in March 2010.<ref name="leeds2010mar">{{cite news|last=Hookham|first=Mark|title=Leeds trolleybus gets go-ahead|date=22 March 2010|publisher=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Leeds-trolleybus-gets-goahead.6169837.jp|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> In past, more than 50 systems existed, and a large number of trolleybuses have been preserved at British [[museum]]s. The world's largest collection of preserved trolleybuses is at [[The Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft]] in England. Examples are also preserved at the [[East Anglia Transport Museum]] and the [[Black Country Living Museum]] in England. The [[Bradford Trolleybus Association]] is restoring Bradford trolleybus 758, the last rear-entrance trolleybus in Britain, which is kept at [[The Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft|Sandtoft]]. The last trolleybuses ran in Bradford in 1972.

===United States of America===
:''See also: [[List of trolleybus systems in the United States]]''

Since the opening of the first system, a relatively short-lived one opened in 1910 in [[Los Angeles]], more than 60 cities in the United States have been served by trolleybuses, in some instances by two or more independent systems operated by different private companies.<ref name="Murray"/>
====Current operations====
[[Image:SEPTA66Route.jpg|right|150px|thumb|SEPTA Route 66 trackless trolley on Frankford Avenue in Philadelphia in 2010]] 
Trolleybus systems are currently in operation in five U.S. metropolitan areas:<ref name ="Jane's2008"/>
*[[Boston, Massachusetts]]: [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's]] [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line Waterfront]] service
**[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]: Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, see [[Boston-area trackless trolleys]]
*[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]: [[SEPTA]]
*[[San Francisco, California]]: [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|San Francisco Muni]]
*[[Seattle, Washington]]: [[King County Metro]]
*[[Dayton, Ohio]]: [[Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority]]
====Preservation====
*The [[Illinois Railway Museum]] in Union maintains an historical collection of 20 trolleybuses from [[Chicago]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], Toronto, Seattle, San Francisco, Edmonton and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. Several of the preserved coaches are operable and periodically provide rides for visitors over the museum's 0.6-mile (1 km) demonstration line, such service usually being scheduled on the first Saturday of June, July, September and October each year. 
*There are 18 historic trolleybuses in the collection of the [[Seashore Trolley Museum]] in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]].<ref>[http://www.trolleymuseum.org/collection/trackless.html Trackless Trolley Collection.] [[Seashore Trolley Museum]].</ref>  Some are only on display or stored, but seven are in operating condition, and the museum has an approximately quarter-mile trolleybus line, on which operation takes place on about two or three weekends each year.
*In Seattle, transit authority [[King County Metro]] has preserved several historic trolleybuses and diesel buses that used to serve the city, and adds more to its collection as additional types are withdrawn from use on the Metro transit system.  Volunteers from a group of current and retired employees of the agency, the Metro Employees Historic Vehicle Association (MEHVA), formed in 1981, restore and maintain the vehicles and operate them on public excursions a few times each year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Vinh|title= Take a ride down memory lane <U+2014> or to see fall foliage <U+2014> aboard a vintage transit bus|date=15 October  2009|publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]''|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/outdoors/2010064974_nwwbus15.html|accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> As of 2009, the historic-vehicle fleet includes six trolleybuses, of which one is also a [[dual-mode bus]].<ref>[http://www.mehva.org/fleet.php Our Fleet.] Metro Employees Historic Vehicle Association (Seattle).

*[[San Francisco Municipal Railway|San Francisco Muni]] has a collection of seven historic trolleybuses, including three [[New Flyer Industries|Flyer]] E800s of mid-1970s vintage, in operating condition, and four older vehicles which are not in running condition.
*A number of other museums in the United States have trolleybuses on static display only.

===Venezuela===
A trolleybus system opened in [[M<U+00E9>rida, M<U+00E9>rida|M<U+00E9>rida]] in June 2007.<ref name="tm275">''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 275 (September-October 2007), p. 119.</ref><ref name="morrison-merida">Morrison, Allen (5 January 2009).

A fleet of 45 [[Articulated bus|articulated]] trolleybuses built in Spain by [[Mercedes-Benz buses|Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Hispano Carrocera]] provides the service.<ref name="morrison-merida"/>  A similar new trolleybus BRT system is under construction in [[Barquisimeto]],<ref>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 272 (March-April 2007), p. 47.</ref> and for this system 80 articulated trolleybuses have been purchased from [[Neoplan]], in Germany.  Many years earlier, a small trolleybus system (using only 11 vehicles) operated in [[Caracas]] from 1937 until about 1949.
