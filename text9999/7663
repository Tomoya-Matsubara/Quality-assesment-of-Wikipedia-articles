'''Coronado''' is an affluent city in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 24,100 at the 2000 census. Coronado is Spanish for "the crowned one," and thus it is nicknamed ''The Crown City''. It is also nicknamed ''The Tent City'', referring to tents once situated south of the Hotel del Coronado that served as living quarters for hotel staff members. The city is a very popular tourist destination for San Diegans, other Americans, and International visitors alike. The small island resort-town prides itself on its small town atmosphere and uptown social environment. The district is one of the most expensive places to reside in [[California]], [[San Diego County]] and the nation{{Fact|date=January 2009}}.

Coronado was featured in the 1960-1961 [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[COronado 9]]'', starring [[Rod Cameron]] as a private detective, Dan Adams, who operated from the San Diego area.
''COronado 9'' refers to Adams' [[telephone]] exchange.

==Geography==
[[Image:Coronadobridge.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Coronado bridge]]
Coronado is located at {{coord|32|40|41|N|117|10|21|W|city}} (32.678190, -117.172581){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 84.6 km<U+00B2> (32.7 mi<U+00B2>);  20 km<U+00B2> (7.7 mi<U+00B2>) of the city is land and 64.6 km<U+00B2> (24.9 mi<U+00B2>) of it (76.36%) is water.

Coronado is a [[peninsula]] connected to the mainland by a 10.0 mi narrow strip of land called the ''[[Silver Strand (San Diego)|Silver Strand]]'' (or, locally, ''The Strand''.) Locals often refer to Coronado as ''The Island'' or ''Coronado Island'' and they denote the core living and business area as ''The Village''. Another nickname, mostly used by younger residents, is "The Rock".

Originally Coronado was separated from ''North Island'' by a shallow channel called the Spanish Bight. The development of North Island by the [[United States Navy]] prior to [[World War II]] led to the filling of the Bight, combining the land areas into a single body. The Navy still operates [[Naval Air Station North Island]] (NASNI or "North Island") on Coronado. On the opposite side of the island is the Coronado Amphibious Base, famous as a training center for Navy SEALs.

In 1969, the [[San Diego-Coronado Bridge]] was opened, allowing much faster transit between the cities than bay [[Ferry|ferries]] or driving via [[California State Route 75|State Route 75]] along the Silver Strand. The city is currently weighing the options of additional construction on Highway 75 to alleviate congestion as traffic flows to and from San Diego and North Island.

== Demographics ==

As of the 2000 [[census]]{{GR|2}}, there were 24,100 people, 7,734 households, and 4,934 families residing in the city.  The [[population density]] was 1,205.3/km<U+00B2> (3,121.9/mi<U+00B2>).  There were 9,494 housing units at an average density of 474.8/km<U+00B2> (1,229.8/mi<U+00B2>).  The racial makeup of the city was 84.40% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 5.15% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.66% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 3.72% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.30% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 3.14% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 2.63% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 9.83% of the population.

There were 7,734 households out of which 27.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.0% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 7.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.2% were non-families. 30.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Out of the total population, 5.0% of those under the age of 18 and 1.9% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

Like many other premiere locations in Southern California, real estate in the city of Coronado is very expensive. A small and very modest two bedroom home in the city can easily cost over $1,000,000. According to a recent County-Wide Zip Code chart published in the San Diego Union Tribune newspaper in August 2006, the median cost of a single-family home within the city's zip code of 92118 was $1,605,000, as of July 2006. This makes it the third most expensive place to live in San Diego County and one of the most expensive in the country, as it holds a spot within the top 20 most expensive cities in the United States.

==Politics==

Coronado has long been a Republican bastion, with about 51% of voters registered Republican, 25% Democrat and 21% nonpartisan, although the Republican lead is dropping.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20081016-9999-1cz16cmayor.html | title=Two candidates show their party's colors at forum | author=Janine Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga | date=October 16, 2008 | publisher=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]}}</ref>  The political change is evident by the election of [[Casey Tanaka]], a Democrat (and first minority representative in Coronado), as mayor in 2008.  Many of its residents are retired Navy personnel. The district is also sheltered both politically and socially from the concerns of the wider San Diego metro, making its residents more connected to local issues and events.

In the [[California State Legislature|state legislature]] Coronado is located in the 40th [[California State Senate|Senate]] District, represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Denise Moreno Ducheny]], and in the 79th [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] District, represented by Democrat [[Mary Salas]].

==Hotel del Coronado==
[[Image:Hotel del Coronado Front.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Front view of the Hotel del Coronado.]]
{{main|Hotel del Coronado}}
Coronado is home to the famous [[Hotel del Coronado]], built in 1888 and long considered one of the world's top resorts{{Fact|date=January 2009}}. It is listed as a [[National Historic Landmark]] and appeared in films such as ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ''[[The Stunt Man]]'', and was the setting of the [[Dashboard Confessional]] song ''Stolen''.  The historic hotel has had many American heroes come to visit, such as [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Thomas Edison]] and legendary sports figures such as Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Willie Mays, Magic Johnson, and Muhammad Ali. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Many presidents have also visited, including Taft, Franklin Roosevelt, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton and First Lady Laura Bush.

"The Del" was supposedly also the inspiration for Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz. Frank L. Baum would have been able to see the hotel from his front porch overlooking Star Park. Because of that, Coronado is often associated with the color green and is often referenced as "The Emerald City". The colors of Coronado High were changed to green and white, the Coronado city flag is a tricolor of green-white-green with a crown in the middle, a local surf/skate shop is named Emerald City.

==Schools==
[[Coronado Unified School District]] includes Coronado Middle School (CMS), [[Coronado High School (Coronado, California)|Coronado High School]], Silver Strand Elementary, and Village Elementary.  Among the private schools are Sacred Heart Parish School and Christ Church Day School.
