'''William Tailer''' (February 25, 1675/6 <U+2013> March 1, 1731/2)<ref name=dates/> was a military officer and politician in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]].  Born into the influential Stoughton family, he married into the more powerful Dudley family.  He served as lieutenant governor of the province from the late 1700s until 1716, and again in the late 1720s.  During each of these times he was briefly acting governor.

==Early life and military service==
He was born in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] on February 25, 1675/6<ref name=dates>In the [[Julian calendar]], then in use in England, the year began on March 25.  To avoid confusion with dates in the [[Gregorian calendar]], then in use in other parts of Europe, dates between January and March were often written with both years.  Dates in this article are in the Julian calendar unless otherwise noted.</ref> to William Tailer and Rebecca Stoughton Tailer.  His mother was the daughter of early Massachusetts settler [[Israel Stoughton]] and sister to magistrate [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]].<ref name=C19>Clapp, p. 19</ref>  His father was a wealthy landowner and merchant.  He owned commercial real estate in [[Boston]] and was a member of the Atherton Company,  one of New England's most powerful and well-connected land development partnerships.<ref>Johnson, p. 26</ref>  He was also one of "a selected fraternity" of merchants engaged in the "eastward trade" with neighboring French [[Acadia]], one of whose leading members was Boston merchant [[John Nelson (merchant)|John Nelson]].<ref>Johnson, pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref>  He committed suicide in 1682, apparently suffering from depression which may have been brought on by financial reverses.<ref name=C19/><ref>Johnson, p. 31</ref>

The younger Tailer inherited a substantial estate; it was reported that in 1695 his guardians operated five mills on his behalf.<ref>Johnson, p. 107</ref>  He was also a beneficiary of the large estate of his uncle, who died a childless bachelor.  By 1702 Tailer had married Sarah Byfield, daughter to Nathaniel Byfield, another leading colonial magistrate.  She died childless in about 1708.<ref name=C20>Clapp, p. 20</ref>  Byfield and Tailer's father had been business partners, a relationship that Tailer continued.<ref name=J125>Johnson, p. 125</ref>

Tailer was a captain of the [[Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company]], and served in the provincial militia during [[Queen Anne's War]].  In 1710 he commanded a militia regiment that saw action at the [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|capture of Port Royal, Acadia]].  Following the victory he went [[London]] with [[Francis Nicholson]], the expedition's leader, where he was "bigg with expectation" of advancement.<ref>Johnson, p. 124</ref>  His expectations were rewarded with a commission as lieutenant governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], serving under Governor [[Joseph Dudley]].  He then returned to Massachusetts, where he was again active in the defense of the colonies, serving at [[Fort William and Mary]] in New Hampshire, and reporting on the frontier defenses in what is now southern [[Maine]].<ref name=C21>Clapp, p. 21</ref>  In early 1711/2 he married Abigail Gillam Dudley, widow of Joseph Dudley's grandson Thomas.  The couple had six children, who they raised in the old Stoughton homestead in Dorchester.<ref>Clapp, pp. 21<U+2013>22</ref>

==Lieutenant and acting governor of Massachusetts==
Tailer was elected to the Governor's Council from 1712 to 1729.<ref>Whitmore, pp. 49<U+2013>54</ref>  He received three separate commissions as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts.<ref>''Transactions of the Colonial Society'', pp. 110,151</ref>  Despite his connection by marriage to the Dudley's, he had an awkward political relationship with the governor.  A number of [[Church of England|Anglicans]] in the colony, Tailer among them, were skeptical of Dudley's faith.<ref name=J125/>  (Dudley had been raised in the [[Puritan]] way, and had formally adopted Anglican practices while in England in the 1690s.)<ref>Kimball, p. 66</ref>  He and Dudley were also on opposite sides of the debate on the province's currency problems.  Dudley favored the issuance of public [[bills of credit]] as a means to circumvent the inflationary issuance of currency that had become a serious problem by the end of Queen Anne's War in 1713, while Tailer, along with his father-in-law Nathan Byfield and others, favored the establishment of a private land bank, that would issue bills secured by the lands of its investors.<ref name=J125/><ref>Kimball, p. 164</ref>

Nathan Byfield in 1714 went to London to lobby on behalf of the land bank interests, and to seek for himself the post of governor, which was open for consideration after the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] to the throne.<ref name=J125/><ref>Kimball, p. 179</ref>    Byfield was unsuccessful in acquiring the governorship, but he was able to convince Dudley's chosen replacement, Colonel Elizeus Burgess, to keep Tailer as lieutenant governor.  Burgess, however, was bribed by land bank opponents to resign his post before leaving England.<ref name=J125/>  The commissions of Burgess and Tailer, however, were sent to Massachusetts, and Tailer became acting governor in November 1715 after they were formally proclaimed.  The king chose Colonel [[Samuel Shute]], a land bank opponent, to replace Burgess, and [[William Dummer]] as Shute's lieutenant governor.<ref name=J125/>  Tailer was turned out of office with Shute's arrival in October 1716.<ref>Whitmore, p. 43</ref>

He next traveled to England.  There he lobbied, apparently without success, on behalf of John Nelson, who, as heir to [[Thomas Temple|Sir Thomas Temple's]] claims to Nova Scotia, sought recompense for the loss of the territory in the 1667 [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]].  He also lobbied on his own behalf for a military pension.  He successfully convinced [[Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham|Lord Cobham]] that he deserved one for his service at Port Royal in 1710, and was awarded the half pay of a colonel, amounting to <U+00A3>400 per year.  John Nelson observed that Tailer's loss of the lieutenant governorship (worth <U+00A3>50 per year) "has proved much to his advantage".<ref>Johnson, p. 126</ref>

Tailer eventually returned to Massachusetts.  Under Shute's governorship he was several times deployed in negotiations with Indians on the northern frontiers.<ref>Clapp, p. 24</ref>  Shute left the province quite abruptly in 1723, leaving it in the hands of Lieutenant Governor Dummer.  Around the time [[Jonathan Belcher]] was commissioned the next governor in 1730, Tailer again received a commission as lieutenant governor.  His commission was proclaimed before Belcher's arrival, and he briefly served as acting governor while awaiting his superior's arrival.

Tailer died in Dorchester, while serving as lieutenant governor, in March 1731/2.<ref name=C25>Clapp, p. 25</ref> His pallbearers included Governor Belcher and other leading political figures.<ref>Clapp, p. 26</ref>  He is buried in the tomb of his uncle, Willam Stoughton, in what is now called the [[Dorchester North Burying Ground]].<ref name=C25/>
