After conversion to her new role, the ship was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 12 January 1945 with [[Lieutenant Commander]] John A. Cromly in command.

== Service history ==
===World War II===
Following [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] off [[Bermuda]], ''Odum'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] and proceeded up the [[Pacific]] coast to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]], whence she departed on 16 May 1945 for [[Hawaii]]. There she completed [[amphibious warfare]] training off [[Maui]], took on [[underwater demolition team]] gear, and headed to the [[Western Pacific]] for [[World War II]] service. Discharging her cargo at [[Guam]], she proceeded to [[Ulithi Atoll]], whence she escorted [[Transport (ship)|transport]] [[SS Kote Baroe|SS ''Kote Baroe'']] to [[Leyte]] in the [[Philippine Islands]], arriving there on 29 June 1945. From Leyte, escort missions took her again to Ulithi Atoll, thence to [[Hollandia]] in [[New Guinea]], and back to Leyte.

===Postwar===
At Leyte, in mid-August, following the [[surrender of Japan]] on 15 August 1945, ''Odum'' joined [[Task Force]] 33 and, on 31 August 1945, got underway to escort transports carrying troops for the [[occupation of Japan]]. Arriving in [[Japan]] on 8 September 1945, she departed again on 12 September 1945 to escort transports carrying [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] former [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] to the Philippines.

''Odum'' remained in the Far East supporting the occupation of Japan until late November 1945, when she headed back to the [[United States]]. Assigned to the [[United States Atlantic Fleet]], she operated in Transport [[Squadron (naval)|Squadron]] 2 along the [[United States East Coast]] and off [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] until entering the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] at [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]], for inactivation on 26 July 1946, after which she proceeded to [[Green Cove Springs, Florida|Green Cove Springs]], [[Florida]] for [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioning]].

==Decommissioning and disposal==
''Odum'' decommissioned at Green Cove Springs on 15 November 1946 and entered the Florida Group of the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] on the [[St. Johns River]] there. Later transferred to the Texas Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, ''Odum'' remained inactive in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] for 20 years until stricken from the [[Navy List]] on either 1 November 1966<ref>Per NavSource Online (at http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/04/04071.htm).</ref> or 1 December 1996<ref>Per the ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/o2/odum.htm).</ref>.

==Chilean Navy service==
''Odum'' was sold to [[Chile]] on 15 November 1966 under the [[Military Assistance Program]]. She served in the [[Chilean Navy]] as [[ACH Serrano (APD-26)|ACH ''Serrano'' (APD-26)]] until retired in 1984 and scrapped.
