'''Nunn''' is a [[Colorado municipalities#Statutory_Town|Statutory Town]] in [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld County]], [[Colorado]], [[United States]]. The population was 471 at the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]]. The town is small rural [[agriculture|agricultural]] community located on the [[Colorado Eastern Plains]] north of [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]]. Somewhat isolated, it is surrounded by flat cultivated countryside of the [[Colorado Piedmont]] in area historically known for raising [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[sugar beet]]s, beans and [[potato]]es. The town was founded as a shipping point on the [[Denver Pacific Railroad]] in the late 19th century and today sits along the western side of [[U.S. Highway 85]] between Greeley and [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. It consists of a small grid of single-family homes on gravel streets. The town has suffered a decline in both its economy and population beginning in the middle 20th century, and today the former storefronts along Logan Street parallel to the highway are largely boarded up. The remaining industry in town consists of a [[grain elevator]] and a cafe, as well as several industrial farm facilities on the outskirts of town. A major landmark is a large water tower emblazoned with the words "watch Nunn grow". The remaining economic activity has largely shifted southward to the towns of [[Pierce, Colorado|Pierce]] and [[Ault, Colorado|Ault]]. The town also has a town park and a municipal hall.

==Uranium-mining controversy==
''See [[Uranium mining in Colorado#Centennial project|Centennial project]]''

In October 2006, Vancouver-based [[Powertech (USA) Inc.]] announced preliminary plans to mine [[uranium]] by [[in-situ leaching]] and possibly [[open-pit mining]] from a deposit in sandstones of the [[Fox Hills Formation]] several miles west of Nunn. 

Some local residents have formed [http://www.nunnglow.com Coloradoans Against Resource Destruction] (C.A.R.D.) to oppose the proposed mining.  They and a landowners' organization called [http://www.stewards-of-the-land.com Stewards of the Land] point out that the proposed mining area is only six miles northeast of the [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] city limit, and that the [[Fox Hills Formation]] is a major water-supply [[aquifer]].  C.A.R.D. and SOTL dispute the safety of both [[in-situ leaching]] and [[open-pit mining]] for uranium.

On July 19, 2007, Powertech held an informational meeting at the Nunn Community Center.
