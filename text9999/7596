{{Campaignbox Quasi-War}}
The '''Action of 1 January 1800''' was a naval battle of the [[Quasi-War]] that took place off the coast of present-day [[Haiti]], near the island of [[Gon<U+00E2>ve Island|Gon<U+00E2>ve]] in the [[Bight (geography)|Bight]] of [[Gulf of Gon<U+00E2>ve|L<U+00E9>og<U+00E2>ne]]. The battle was fought between an American [[convoy]] of four merchant vessels escorted by the United States naval [[schooner]] {{USS|Experiment|1799|6}}, and a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] of armed [[barge]]s manned by Haitians known as [[wikt:picaroon|picaroon]]s.

A French-aligned Haitian general, [[Andr<U+00E9> Rigaud]], had instructed his forces to attack all foreign shipping within their range of operations. Accordingly, once ''Experiment'' and her convoy of [[Cargo ship|merchant ships]] neared Gon<U+00E2>ve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing two of the American merchant ships before withdrawing. ''Experiment'' managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue wreaking havoc among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud was forced out of power by the forces of [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] did the picaroon attacks cease.

==Background==
With the dawn of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, a successful slave rebellion on the French colony, then known as [[Saint-Domingue]], allowed the local population to gain control over the government. Despite their success in removing the French colonial authorities, the various political factions that had seized control of the colony were fractious, and fighting soon broke out among them. By 1800, the [[War of Knives]] between the pro-French [[Andr<U+00E9> Rigaud]] and the pro-[[autonomy]] [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] was in full swing and Saint-Domingue was divided in two. Rigaud controlled part of the southern portion of Saint-Domingue while L'Ouverture controlled the rest of the French colony. In need of supplies and [[materiel]], Rigaud's forces attacked any non-French ship that passed them.{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=115}}

Concurrently with the War of Knives, the United States and France were engaged in a bout of limited naval warfare in the Caribbean as part of the [[Quasi-War]]. In late December 1799 the American armed [[schooner]] ''Experiment'' was escorting under convoy the [[brig]] ''Daniel and Mary'' and the schooners ''Sea Flower'', ''Mary'', and ''Washington'' to prevent their capture by French [[privateer]]s. On 1 January 1800, the convoy was caught in a dead calm off the north side of the present day Haitian island of [[Gon<U+00E2>ve Island|Gon<U+00E2>ve]], in the Bight of Leogane. Seeing the convoy becalmed, Rigaud sent eleven armed barges out to attack and seize the American vessels.{{sfn|Palmer|1987|p=165}}

The crews of the American merchant vessels possessed only small arms, but their escort, ''Experiment'', was a much more powerful vessel.{{sfn|Palmer|1987|p=165}} Commanded by William Maley, the 135-ton ''Experiment'' was armed with 12 six-pounder guns and had a complement of 70 men. In comparison, Rigaud's initial attack force consisted of eleven barges crewed by 40 to 50 men each in the smaller ones, and 60 or 70 in the larger vessels.{{sfn|Palmer|1987|p=165}}{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=139}} These barges were primarily propelled by oars, with 26 per vessel.{{sfn|Maclay|1906|p=205}} The Haitian craft were each equipped with a mix of [[swivel gun]]s and four-pounder cannon, with most vessels armed with two or three guns as well as small arms.{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=139}} In addition to the vessels that set out to attack the convoy, there were more barges and men nearby that the Haitians could call upon if reinforcements were needed. In total some 37 barges and 1500 men were at Rigaud's immediate disposal, though the Americans did not know this during the attack. Individually the Haitian barges presented only a small threat to the convoy, but when attacking ''en masse'' they could easily overwhelm and capture the American ships if they managed to board them.{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=144}}

==Battle==

''Experiment'' kept her gunports closed and passed herself off as a merchantman, while the Haitians sailed closer to the convoy with the intent of boarding and capturing all five vessels.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=111}} Once the Haitians were in [[musket]] range of the American vessels they opened fire on them, and ''Experiment'' returned the fire.{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=140}} [[Grapeshot]] from the Americans wreaked havoc among the Haitian barges and they were forced to withdraw. They stood off the American convoy for thirty minutes before [[Beaching (nautical)|beaching]] at the nearby island of Gon<U+00E2>ve to land their wounded and gather reinforcements. With three more barges and fresh crews, the picaroons set off to assault the American convoy once more. They divided themselves into three squadrons of four barges each and set course to attack ''Experiment''.{{sfn|Palmer|1987|p=166}} The lead and centermost divisions attacked the sides of the American warship while the rear division assaulted the stern. During the lull in fighting ''Experiment'' had readied herself for the picaroons' next assault by positioning [[musketeer]]s in defensive positions, loading her main guns, and raising [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]] nets. Thus, when the Haitians attacked the American warship again she was well prepared to repulse any attempt at boarding her.{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=141}}

For three hours, ''Experiment'' battled the barges, sinking two and killing a great many of the picaroons. During this time two of the barges left the warship and attacked the merchant ships. These barges managed to protect themselves from ''Experiment'' by sailing behind the schooner ''Mary'', which was between the two barges and the warship.{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=141}} The Haitians boarded ''Mary'' and killed the captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the [[Hold (ship)|hold]]. The second barge attempted to take ''Daniel and Mary'' but was sunk by fire from ''Experiment''. Once the Haitians had boarded ''Mary'', ''Experiment'' opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.{{sfn|Palmer|1987|p=166}}

The entire flotilla of Haitians once more retired to Gon<U+00E2>ve and replaced their wounded crewmembers with fresh ones.{{sfn|Abbot|1886|p=265}} Seeing that ''Daniel and Mary'' and ''Washington'' had drifted away from the convoy, the Haitians set out to attack them. The two civilian vessels, having drifted too far from the protection of ''Experiment''{{'s}} guns, were abandoned by their crews and passengers who fled to the American warship. The Haitians boarded and plundered these two vessels, carrying them further away from ''Experiment''.{{sfn|Cooper|1847|p=183}} ''Experiment'' managed to get close enough to the barges to attack them with her cannon but could not pursue them, as two barges had broken away from the main flotilla and were positioned to take ''Mary'' and ''Sea Flower'' if ''Experiment'' left them.{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=144}} Eventually the remnants of the convoy managed to make it to [[L<U+00E9>og<U+00E2>ne]], where they were looked after by the American consul.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=112}}

==Aftermath==
USS ''Experiment'' had succeeded in protecting two of the convoy, but the other two ships were taken by the picaroons.  On the American side, only the captain of the schooner ''Mary'' had been killed. The Americans also suffered two wounded: one civilian, and ''Experiment''{{'s}} second in command [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], who had been shot in the arm during the action. In exchange the Haitians had lost two of their barges and a great many casualties.{{sfn|McMaster|1885|p=521}} Rigaud's picaroons attacked another American convoy later in the year and continued to harass American shipping until Rigaud was ousted from Saint-Domingue at the end of the War of Knives.{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=178}} After fleeing to [[Guadeloupe]], he left for France on the schooner ''Diane'', but was captured and taken to [[Saint Kitts]] when ''Experiment'' intercepted her on 1 October 1800.{{sfn|Palmer|1987|pp=216<U+2013>7}}

The action would prove controversial in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of ''Experiment'', had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley had tried to insist on surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to the sheer number of pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to [[Striking the colors|strike the colors]].<ref name="Fitz-Enz2012" page 271>{{cite book|author=Colonel David Fitz-Enz|title=Hacks, Sycophants, Adventurers, and Heroes: Madison's Commanders in the War of 1812|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BhQVbSkiD-AC|accessdate=31 December 2012|date=10 August 2012|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|isbn=978-1-58979-701-7}}</ref>

The officers' reports also commended Porter, stating that he had saved ''Experiment'' and her convoy by acting on his own initiative to ignore Maley's defeatism, urging the crew to fight.{{sfn|Soley|1903|p=7}}{{sfn|Palmer|1987|p=167}} Other American officials, such as the American consul at Leonge, disagreed with Porter's accusations and instead lauded Maley for his bravery.{{sfn|Palmer|1987|p=167}} Threats of [[court-martial]] were made against Maley, but no formal charges regarding the incident were ever brought.{{sfn|Allen|1909|p=148}} On 16 July 1800 he was replaced as commander of ''Experiment'' by [[Charles Stewart (1778<U+2013>1869)|Charles Stewart]]. The incident haunted his career until his retirement.{{sfn|Maclay|1906|p=205}}
