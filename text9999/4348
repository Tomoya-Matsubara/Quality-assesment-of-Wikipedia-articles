'''Rabindranath Tagore'''{{Cref|<U+03B1>}}{{Cref|<U+03B2>}} (7 May 1861 &ndash; 7 August 1941),{{Cref|<U+03B3>}} sobriquet '''Gurudev''',{{Cref|<U+03B4>}} was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] polymath who reshaped his region's [[Bengali literature|literature]] and [[Music of Bengal|music]]. Author of ''[[Gitanjali]]'' and its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse",{{Sfn|The Nobel Foundation}} he became the first non-European Nobel laureate by earning the 1913 [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Prize in Literature]].{{Sfn|O'Connell|2008}} In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; his seemingly mesmeric persona, floccose locks, and empyreal garb garnered him a prophet-like aura in the West. His "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal.{{Sfn|Sen|1997}}

As a humanist, universalist internationalist, and strident anti-nationalist he denounced the [[British Raj|Raj]] and advocated for independence from Britain. As an exponent of the [[Bengal Renaissance]] he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy endures also in the institution he founded, [[Visva-Bharati University]].

Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. ''Gitanjali'' (''Song Offerings''), ''Gora'' (''Fair-Faced''), and ''Ghare-Baire'' (''[[The Home and the World]]'') are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed&mdash;or panned&mdash;for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. He penned two national anthems: the [[India|Republic of India]]'s ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' and [[Bangladesh]]'s ''[[Amar Shonar Bangla]]''.

==Early life (1861&ndash;1878)==
{{Main|Early life of Rabindranath Tagore}}

The youngest of thirteen surviving children, Tagore was born in the [[Jorasanko Thakur Bari|Jorasanko mansion]] in Calcutta to parents [[Debendranath Tagore]] (1817&ndash;1905) and Sarada Devi (1830&ndash;1875).{{Cref|<U+03B5>}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=37}} [[Tagore family]] patriarchs were the [[Brahmo]] founders of the [[Adi Dharm]] faith. The fabulously loyalist "Prince" [[Dwarkanath Tagore]], with his European estate managers and his serial visits with [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] and other occidental royals, was his paternal grandfather; Dwarkanath's ancestors hailed from the village of Pithabhog in modern-day Bangladesh.{{Sfn|The News Today|2011}} Debendranath had formulated the Brahmoist philosophies espoused by his friend [[Ram Mohan Roy]], and became focal in Brahmo society after Roy's death.{{Sfn|Roy|1977|pp=28&ndash;30}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=8&ndash;9}}

{{Quote box|quote=The last two days a storm has been raging, similar to the description in my song&mdash;''Jhauro jhauro borishe baridhara'' [... amidst it] a hapless, homeless man drenched from top to toe standing on the roof of his steamer [...] the last two days I have been singing this song over and over [...] as a result the pelting sound of the intense rain, the wail of the wind, the sound of the heaving Gorai [R]iver, have assumed a fresh life and found a new language and I have felt like a major actor in this new musical drama unfolding before me.|source=&mdash; Letter to Indira Devi.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}|align=left|width=20%|fontsize=85%|quoted=1}}

"Rabi" was raised mostly by servants; his mother had died in his early childhood and his father travelled widely.{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|p=20}} His home hosted the publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of both Bengali and Western classical music featured there regularly, as the Jorasanko Tagores were the center of a large and art-loving social group. Tagore's oldest brother [[Dwijendranath Tagore|Dwijendranath]] was a respected philosopher and poet. Another brother, [[Satyendranath Tagore|Satyendranath]], was the first Indian appointed to the elite and formerly all-European [[Indian Civil Service]]. Yet another brother, [[Jyotirindranath Tagore|Jyotirindranath]], was a musician, composer, and playwright.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=10}} His sister [[Swarnakumari Devi|Swarnakumari]] became a novelist. Jyotirindranath's wife Kadambari, slightly older than Tagore, was a dear friend and powerful influence. Her abrupt suicide in 1884 left him for years profoundly distraught.

Tagore largely avoided classroom schooling and preferred to roam the manor or nearby [[Bolpur]] and [[Panihati]], idylls which the family visited.{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|pp=21&ndash;24}}{{Sfn|Das|2009}} His brother Hemendranath tutored and physically conditioned him&mdash;by having him swim the Ganges or yomp penitentially through hills, by gymnastics, and by being knocked about in judo and wrestling bouts. He learned drawing, anatomy, geography and history, literature, mathematics, Sanskrit, and English&mdash;his least favorite subject.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=48&ndash;49}} Tagore loathed formal education&mdash;his scholarly travails at the local [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]] spanned a single day. Years later he held that proper teaching does not explain things; proper teaching stokes curiosity:{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=50}}

His ''[[upanayanam|upanayan]]'' initiation at age eleven augured a pivotal trip; in <!--14 -->February 1873 he decamped with his father for a months-long tour of the outer Raj. They visited his father's [[Santiniketan]] estate and rested in [[Amritsar]] en route to the Himalayan Dhauladhars. Their destination was the remote hill station at [[Dalhousie, India|Dalhousie]]. Along the way Tagore read biographies; his stridently learned father tutored him in history, astronomy, other modern sciences, and Sanskrit declensions. He read biographies of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and others; they shared [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''; and together they examined the poetry of {{Unicode|[[K<U+0101>lid<U+0101>sa]]}}.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=54&ndash;55}} In mid-April they reached the station, and at {{Convert|2300|m|ft|0}} they settled into a house atop Bakrota Hill. Tagore was arrested by the region's deep green gorges, its alpine forests, and its mossy streams and waterfalls.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=55}} Through the months a frigid regime attended him: daily twilights spent bathing in icy dawn water.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=55&ndash;56}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=91}}

He survived them, returned to Jorosanko, and wrote: he completed a set of major works by 1877, one a jokingly long poem in the [[Maithili language|Maithili]] style of [[Vidyapati]]. Published pseudonymously, the relevant experts accepted them as the lost works of [[Bh<U+0101>nusi<U+1E43>ha <U+1E6C>h<U+0101>kurer Pa<U+1E0D><U+0101>val<U+012B>|Bh<U+0101>nusi<U+1E43>ha]], a newly discovered{{Cref|<U+03B6>}} 17th-century {{Unicode|[[Vaishnavism|Vai<U+1E63><U+1E47>ava]]}} poet.{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=3}} He debuted the short-story genre in Bengali with "Bhikharini" ("The Beggar Woman"),{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=265}} and his ''Sandhya Sangit'' (1882) includes the famous poem "Nirjharer Swapnabhanga" ("The Rousing of the Waterfall"). Servants subjected him to an almost ludic regimentation in a phase he later dryly reviled as the "servocracy".{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=46&ndash;47}} His head was serially water-dunked&mdash;to quiet him.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=47}} He refused food to irk servants; he was confined to chalk circles in puerile parody of [[Sita]]'s forest trial in the ''[[Ramayana]]''; and he was regaled with the horrifically heroic and vituperative exploits of Bengal's outlaw-''[[dacoity|dacoits]]''.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=47&ndash;48}} Because the Jorasanko manor was in an area of north Calcutta rife with poverty and prostitution,{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=35}} he was forbidden to leave it for any purpose other than traveling to school. In reaction he became infatuated with the world outside and nature. Of his 1873 visit to Santiniketan he wrote:

{{Cquote|1=What I could not see did not take me long to get over&mdash;what I did see was quite enough. There was no servant rule, and the only ring which encircled me was the blue of the horizon, drawn around these [sylvan] solitudes by their presiding goddess. Within this I was free to move about as I chose.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=53&ndash;54}}}}

==Shelaidaha (1878&ndash;1901)==
Debendranath fancied his son a prospective barrister, and so in 1878 Rabi took up studies at a public school in Brighton, East Sussex, England.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} He stayed for some months at a house that the Tagore family owned near [[Brighton]] and [[Hove]], in Medina Villas; in 1877 his nephew and niece&mdash;Suren and Indira Devi, the children of Tagore's brother [[Satyendranath Tagore|Satyendranath]]&mdash;were sent together with their mother, Tagore's sister-in-law, to live with him.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=68}} He briefly read law at [[University College London]], but again left school and took up freelance bardolatry: study of [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespeare]], ''[[Religio Medici]]'', ''[[Coriolanus]]'', and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''. The raucous raillery of English, Irish, and Scottish folk tunes impressed Tagore, whose own tradition of [[Nidhu Babu|Nidhubabu]]-authored ''kirtans'' and ''[[tappa]]s'' and Brahmo hymnody was quite chaste.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|p=31}} In 1880 he returned to Bengal degree-less; he resolved to hence reconcile European novelty with Brahmo traditions, taking the best from each.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=11&ndash;12}} In 1883 he married Mrinalini Devi, born Bhabatarini, 1873&ndash;1902; they had five children, two of whom died in childhood.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=373}}

In 1890 Tagore began managing his vast ancestral estates in the [[Shelaidaha]] region of Bangladesh; he was joined by his wife and children in 1898. Tagore released his ''Manasi'' poems (1890), among his best-known work.{{Sfn|Scott|2009|p=10}} As ''[[Zamindar]] Babu'', Tagore criss-crossed the riverine holdings in command of the ''Padma'', the luxurious family barge. He was a friendly feudalist who collected mostly token rents; he would bless villagers and in turn was subjected to their impromptu honorary banquets&mdash;occasionally of dried rice and sour milk.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=109&ndash;111}} This period from 1891 to 1895, Tagore's ''Sadhana'' period, after one of Tagore's magazines, was his most fecund;{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|p=20}} in these years he wrote more than half the stories of the three-volume, 84-story ''Galpaguchchha''.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}} Its ironic and grave tales savoured the voluptuous poverty and characterised an idealised conception of rural life in Bengal.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=109}}

In 1901 Tagore moved to [[Santiniketan]] to found an ''[[:wikt:ashram|ashram]]'' with a marble-floored prayer hall&mdash;''The [[:wikt:Mandir|Mandir]]''&mdash;an experimental school, groves of trees, gardens, a library.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=133}} There his wife and two of his children died. His father died in <!--19 January -->1905. He received monthly payments as part of his inheritance and income from the Maharaja of Tripura, sales of his family's jewelry, his seaside bungalow in [[Puri]], and a derisory {{INR}}2,000 in book royalties.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=139&ndash;140}} He gained Bengali and foreign readers alike; he published ''[[Naivedya]]'' (1901) and ''Kheya'' (1906) and translated poems into free verse. In November 1913, Tagore learned he had won that year's Nobel Prize in Literature: the [[Swedish Academy]] appreciated the idealistic&mdash;and for Westerners&mdash;accessible nature of a small body of his translated material focussed on the 1912 ''[[Gitanjali]]: Song Offerings''.{{Sfn|Hj<U+00E4>rne|1913}} In 1915, the British Crown granted Tagore a knighthood. He renounced it after the 1919 [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]].

In 1921, Tagore and agricultural economist [[Leonard Knight Elmhirst|Leonard Elmhirst]] set up the "Institute for Rural Reconstruction", later renamed Shriniketan or "Abode of Welfare", in [[Surul]], a village near the ''ashram''. With it, Tagore sought to moderate [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi's]] ''[[Swaraj]]'' protests, which he occasionally blamed for British India's perceived mental&mdash;and thus ultimately colonial&mdash;decline.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=239&ndash;240}} He sought aid from donors, officials, and scholars worldwide to "free village[s] from the shackles of helplessness and ignorance" by "vitalis[ing] knowledge".{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=242}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=308&ndash;309}} In the early 1930s he targeted ambient "abnormal caste consciousness" and [[untouchability]]. He lectured against these, he penned [[Dalit]] heroes for his poems and his dramas, and he campaigned&mdash;successfully&mdash;to open [[Guruvayoor Temple]] to Dalits.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=303}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=309}}

Tagore's itinerary as the "peripatetic litterateur" affirmed his opinion that human divisions were shallow. During a May 1932 visit to a Bedouin encampment in the Iraqi desert, the tribal chief told him that "Our prophet has said that a true Muslim is he by whose words and deeds not the least of his brother-men may ever come to any harm ..." Tagore confided in his diary: "I was startled into recognizing in his words the voice of essential humanity."{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=317}} To the end Tagore scrutinised orthodoxy&mdash;and in 1934, he struck. That year, an earthquake hit Bihar and killed thousands. Gandhi hailed it as seismic ''[[karma]]'', as divine retribution avenging the oppression of Dalits. Tagore rebuked him for his seemingly ignominious inferences.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=312&ndash;313}} He mourned the perennial poverty of Calcutta and the rising tide of militant mediocrity&mdash;social, cultural, architectural&mdash;in Bengal. He detailed these newly plebeian aesthetics in an unrhymed hundred-line poem whose technique of searing double-vision foreshadowed [[Satyajit Ray]]'s film ''[[Apur Sansar (The World of Apu)|Apur Sansar]]''.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=335&ndash;338}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=342}} Fifteen new volumes appeared, among them prose-poem works ''Punashcha'' (1932), ''Shes Saptak'' (1935), and ''Patraput'' (1936). Experimentation continued in his prose-songs and dance-dramas: ''Chitra<!--ngada-->'' (1914), ''Shyama'' (1939), and ''Chandalika'' (1938); and in his novels: ''Dui Bon'' (1933), ''Malancha'' (1934), and ''Char Adhyay'' (1934).

Tagore's remit expanded to science in his last years, as hinted in ''Visva-Parichay'', 1937 collection of essays. His respect for scientific laws and his exploration of biology, physics, and astronomy informed his poetry, which exhibited extensive naturalism and verisimilitude.{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|p=28}} He wove the ''process'' of science, the narratives of scientists, into stories in ''Se'' (1937), ''Tin Sangi'' (1940), and ''Galpasalpa'' (1941). His last five years were marked by chronic pain and two long periods of illness. These began when Tagore lost consciousness in late 1937; he remained comatose and near death for a time. This was followed in late 1940 by a similar spell. He never recovered. Poetry from these valetudinary years is among his finest.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=338}}{{Sfn|Indo-Asian News Service|2005}} A period of prolonged agony ended with Tagore's death on 7 August 1941, aged eighty; he was in an upstairs room of the Jorasanko mansion he was raised in.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=367}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=363}} The date is still mourned.{{Sfn|The Daily Star|2009}} A.

Between 1878 and 1932 Tagore set foot in more than thirty countries on five continents;{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=374&ndash;376}} these trips acquainted foreigners with his works and his polemics.

On 14 July 1927 Tagore banded with two companions to embark on a four-month tour of Southeast Asia: Bali, Java, Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang and Siam, Singapore. The resultant travelogues compose ''Jatri'' (1929).{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=1}} In early 1930 he left Bengal for a nearly year-long tour of Europe and the United States.

Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays, short stories, travelogues, dramas, and thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his short stories are perhaps most highly regarded; he is indeed credited with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. Such stories mostly borrow from deceptively simple subject matter: commoners. Tagore's non-fiction grappled chthonic history, linguistics, and uttermost spirituality. He wrote autobiographies. His travelogues, essays, and lectures were compiled into several volumes, including ''Europe Jatrir Patro'' (''Letters from Europe'') and ''Manusher Dhormo'' (''[[The Religion of Man]]''). His brief chat with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], "Note on the Nature of Reality", is included as an appendix to the latter. On the occasion of Tagore's 150th birthday an anthology (titled ''Kalanukromik Rabindra Rachanabali'') of the total body of his works is currently being published in Bengali in chronological order. This includes all versions of each work and fills about eighty volumes.{{Sfn|Pandey|2011}}

===Music and art===
Tagore composed 2,230 songs and was a prolific painter. His songs compose ''[[Rabindra Sangeet|rabindrasangit]]'' ("Tagore Song"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which&mdash;poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike&mdash;were lyricised. Influenced by the ''[[thumri]]'' style of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani music]], they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=94}} They emulated the tonal color of classical ''[[raga]]s'' to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ''ragas''.{{Sfn|Dasgupta|2001}} Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not ''bhanga gaan'', the body of tunes revamped with "fresh value" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours "external" to Tagore's own ancestral bequest.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} In gauging the emotive force and range of ''ragas'', he was rapt:

{{Cquote|1=[...] the pathos of the ''purabi raga'' reminded Tagore of the evening tears of a lonely widow, while ''kanara'' was the confused realization of a nocturnal wanderer who had lost his way. In ''bhupali'' he seemed to hear a voice in the wind saying 'stop and come hither'.''Paraj'' conveyed to him the deep slumber that overtook one at night<U+2019>s end.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}|4=[[Reba Som]]|5=''Rabindranath Tagore: The Singer and His Song''.{{Sfn|Som|2010|p=38}}}}

Tagore influenced ''sitar'' maestro [[Vilayat Khan]] and ''[[sarod]]iyas'' Buddhadev Dasgupta and [[Amjad Ali Khan]].{{Sfn|Dasgupta|2001}} His songs are immensely popular and undergird the Bengali ethos to an extent perhaps rivaling Shakespeare's impact on the English-speaking world. It is said that his songs are the outcome of five centuries of Bengali literary churning and communal yearning. [[Dhan Gopal Mukerji]] has said that these songs transcend the mundane to the aesthetic and express all ranges and categories of human emotion. The poet gave voice to all&mdash;big or small, rich or poor. The poor Ganges boatman and the rich landlord air their emotions in them. They birthed a distinctive school of music whose practitioners can be fiercely traditional: novel interpretations have drawn severe censure in both West Bengal and Bangladesh.

For Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the ''Modern Review'' observed that "[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung ... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs". [[Arthur Strangways]] of ''The Observer'' introduced non-Bengalis to ''rabindrasangit'' in ''The Music of Hindostan'', calling it a "vehicle of a personality ... [that] go behind this or that system of music to that beauty of sound which all systems put out their hands to seize."{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=359}}

In 1971, ''Amar Shonar Bangla'' became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written&mdash;ironically&mdash;to protest the [[1905 Partition of Bengal]] along communal lines: lopping Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert the region's pyrolatrous demise. Tagore saw the partition as a ploy to upend the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]], and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. ''Jana Gana Mana'' was written in ''[[shadhu-bhasha]]'', a Sanskritised register of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the [[Indian National Congress]] and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.

At sixty, Tagore took up drawing and painting; successful exhibitions of his many works&mdash;which made a debut appearance in Paris upon encouragement by artists he met in the south of France{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=222}}&mdash;were held throughout Europe. He was likely red-green [[protanopia|color blind]]. The result: his hale paintings betrayed fey colour schemes and off-beat aesthetics. Tagore limned scrimshaw from northern [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], [[Haida people|Haida]] carvings from [[British Columbia]], and woodcuts by [[Max Pechstein]].{{Sfn|Dyson|2001}} His artist's eye for his handwriting were revealed in the simple artistic and rhythmic leitmotifs embellishing the scribbles, cross-outs, and word layouts of his manuscripts. Certain of Tagore's song lyrics corresponded with particular paintings in a sort of sensuous synaesthesia.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}

===Theatre===
[[File:Valmiki Pratibha Indira Devi & Rabindranath Tagore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|With niece Indira Devi in ''Valmiki Pratibha'', 1881.]]

At sixteen, Tagore led his brother Jyotirindranath's adaptation of [[Moli<U+00E8>re]]'s ''[[Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]''.{{Sfn|Lago|1977|p=15}} At twenty he wrote his first drama-opera: ''Valmiki Pratibha'' (''The Genius of Valmiki''). In it the glory-bound pandit [[Valmiki]] repudiates sin, is blessed by [[Saraswati]], and compiles his summative fable: the ''[[Ramayana|R<U+0101>m<U+0101>yana]]''.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=123}} Through it Tagore vigorously explores a wide range of dramatic styles and emotions, including usage of revamped ''[[kirtan]]s'' and adaptation of traditional English and Irish folk melodies as drinking songs.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=79&ndash;80}} Another play, ''[[The Post Office (play)|Dak Ghar]]'' (''The Post Office''), describes the child Amal defying his stuffy and puerile confines by ultimately "fall[ing] asleep", hinting his physical death. A story with borderless appeal&mdash;gleaning rave reviews in Europe&mdash;''Dak Ghar'' dealt with death as, in Tagore's words, "spiritual freedom" from "the world of hoarded wealth and certified creeds".{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=21&ndash;23}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=123&ndash;124}} In the Nazi-besieged [[Warsaw Ghetto]], Polish doctor-educator [[Janusz Korczak]] had orphans in his care stage ''The Post Office'' in <!--18 -->July 1942.{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|p=321}} In ''The King of Children'', biographer Betty Jean Lifton suspected that Korczak, agonising over whether one should determine when and how to die, was easing the children into accepting death.{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|pp=416&ndash;417}}{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|pp=318&ndash;321}}{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|pp=385&ndash;386}} In mid-October, their Nazi caretakers sent them to [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|p=349}}

I can feel him coming nearer and nearer and my heart becomes glad.|source=&mdash; Amal in ''The Post Office'', 1914.{{Sfn|Tagore|Mukerjea|1914|p=68}}|align=left|width=20%|fontsize=85%|quoted=1}}

{{Cquote|1=[...] but the meaning is less intellectual, more emotional and simple. The deliverance sought and won by the dying child is the same deliverance which rose before his imagination, [...] when once in the early dawn he heard, amid the noise of a crowd returning from some festival, this line out of an old village song, "Ferryman, take me to the other shore of the river." It may come at any moment of life, though the child discovers it in death, for it always comes at the moment when the "I", seeking no longer for gains that cannot be "assimilated with its spirit", is able to say, "All my work is thine" [...].{{Sfn|Tagore|Mukerjea|1914|pp=v&ndash;vi}}|4=[[W. B. Yeats]]|5=Preface, ''The Post Office'', 1914.}}

His other works fuse lyrical flow and emotional rhythm into a tight focus on a core idea, a break from prior Bengali drama. Tagore sought "the play of feeling and not of action". In 1890 he released what is regarded as his finest drama: ''Visarjan'' (''Sacrifice'').{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=123}} It is a thanatological and thespianised rendition of ''Rajarshi'', an earlier novella of his. "A forthright denunciation of a meaningless [and] cruel superstitious rite[s]",{{Sfn|Ayyub|1980|p=48}} the Bengali originals feature intricate subplots and prolonged monologues giving play to historical events in seventeenth-century Udaipur. The Maharaja of Tripura, himself of spiritual bent, is pitted against the primeval ukases and sanguinary piety staged by the head priest Raghupati. His latter dramas probed themes more philosophical and allegorical in nature; these included ''Dak Ghar''. Another is Tagore's ''Chandalika'' (''Untouchable Girl''), which was modeled on an ancient Buddhist legend describing how [[Ananda]], the [[Gautama Buddha]]'s disciple, asks water of a [[Adivasi|tribal]] girl.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=124}}

''Raktakarabi'' ("Red" or "Blood Oleanders") features a curtained and kingly kleptocrat who regally bilks the anthropoid simulacra of ''[[Yaksha]][[Pur (Vedic)|puri]]''&mdash;benumbed by alcohol and numbered in nomenclature&mdash;via coerced gold mining. The naive maiden-heroine Nandini dotingly rallies her subject-compatriots to ultimately baffle the avarice of the ''[[sardar]]-nomenklatura''&mdash;with the roused ''raja'''s own belated help. Skirting the "good-vs-evil" trope, the work pits a vital and joyous l<U+00E8>se majest<U+00E9> against a necrotic, monotonous fealty of a vacuous varletry, a microcosmic and allegorical cockfight akin to ''[[Animal Farm]]'' or ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.{{Sfn|Ray|2007|pp=147&ndash;148}} As ever, the lithe and sublime Bengali original, prized at home, long failed to spawn a "free and comprehensible" translation, and its archaic and sonorous didacticism earned few plaudits abroad.{{Sfn|O'Connell|2008}} ''Chitrangada'', ''Chandalika'', and ''Shyama'' are other key plays that have dance-drama adaptations: ''[[Rabindra Nritya Natya]]''.

===Novels===
Tagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them ''Chaturanga'', ''[[Shesher Kobita]]'', ''Char Odhay'', and ''Noukadubi''. ''Ghare Baire'' (''[[The Home and the World]]'')&mdash;through the lens of the idealistic ''zamindar'' protagonist Nikhil&mdash;repudiates the ravening frog-march of nativism, terrorism, and religious querulousness among less reputable segments of the [[Swadeshi movement|''Swadeshi'' movement]]. A frank expression of Tagore's conflicted sentiments, it calved off a 1914 bout of depression. The novel ends in grody Hindu-Muslim interplay and Nikhil's likely mortal capital wounding.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=192&ndash;194}}

''Gora'', championed by many Bengali critics as his finest tale, raises controversies regarding connate identity and its ultimate fungibility. As with ''Ghare Baire'' matters of self-identity (''{{Unicode|[[j<U+0101>ti]]}}''), personal freedom, and religion are lividly vivisected and contextualised solely by family and romance.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=154&ndash;155}} In it an Irish boy orphaned in the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] is raised by Hindus as the titular "whitey". Ignorant of his foreign provenance he fixedly castigates religious backsliders out of love for the autochthons and solidarity with them against his hegemon-compatriots. The cultural castaway falls for a Brahmo girl, compelling his worried foster father to reveal his distant origins and admonish his nativist zeal. As a "true dialectic" evincing "arguments for and against strict traditionalism", it tackles the colonial conundrum by "portray[ing] the value of all positions within a particular frame [...] not only syncretism, not only liberal orthodoxy, but the extremest reactionary traditionalism he defends by an appeal to what humans share." Among these Tagore highlights "identity [...] conceived of as ''[[dharma]].''"{{Sfn|Hogan|2000|pp=213&ndash;214}}

In ''[[Jogajog]]'' (''Relationships''), the heroine Kumudini&mdash;bound by the ideals of ''[[<U+015A>iva]]-[[Dakshayani|Sati]]'', exemplified by {{Unicode|[[Dakshayani|D<U+0101>ksh<U+0101>yani]]}}&mdash;is torn between her pity for the sinking fortunes of her progressive and compassionate elder brother and his foil: her rakishly rebarbative roue of a husband. Tagore flaunts his feminist leanings; ''pathos'' depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and family honour; he simultaneously trucks with the pyrrhic putrescence of Bengal's preterite landed gentry.{{Sfn|Mukherjee|2004}} The story revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families&mdash;the Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the decline (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing new money and new arrogance. Kumudini, Biprodas' sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had risen in an observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female relations.

Others were uplifting: ''Shesher Kobita''&mdash;translated twice as ''Last Poem'' and ''Farewell Song''&mdash;is his most lyrical novel, with poems and rhythmic passages written by a poet protagonist. It contains elements of satire and postmodernism; stock characters gleefully attack the reputation of an old, outmoded, oppressively renowned poet who, incidentally, goes by the suitably dyspeptic name ''Rabindranath Tagore''. Though his novels remain among the least-appreciated of his works, they have been given renewed attention via film adaptations by Ray and others: ''[[Chokher Bali (film)|Chokher Bali]]'' and ''[[Ghare Baire (film)|Ghare Baire]]'' are exemplary. In the first, Tagore fulminantly inscribes coeval Bengali society via its heroine: a rebellious widow who would live for herself alone. He pillories the custom of perpetual mourning on the part of widows, who were not allowed to remarry, who were consigned to seclusion and loneliness. It is of choleric melancholy, a stirring tale of deceit and sorrow arising from dissatisfaction and sorrow. Tagore wrote of it: "I have always regretted the ending".

The latter work illustrates Tagore's conflicted mind, between the ambiguous munificence of Western culture and line-item revolution against it. These moieties are portrayed in two of the main characters: Nikhil, who is rational and opposes violence; and Sandip, who as sumpter to his goals will not be stopped. These rivals are key in understanding the history of his region and its contemporary problems. There is much controversy over whether Tagore was representing Gandhi in Sandip. But many argue that Tagore would not even venture to personify Sandip as Gandhi because Tagore could&mdash;grudgingly&mdash;offer a sort of derogatory devotion to Gandhi's antiquarian ardor, and Gandhi was sententiously anti-violence while the libertine Sandip would employ violence&mdash;in any respect&mdash;to twin body and soul.

Tagore's three-volume ''Galpaguchchha'' comprises eighty-four stories that reflect upon the author's surroundings, on modern and fashionable ideas, and on mind puzzles.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}} Tagore associated his earliest stories, such as those of the "''Sadhana''" period, with an exuberance of vitality and spontaneity; these traits were cultivated by ''zamindar'' Tagore<U+2019>s life Patisar, Shajadpur, Shelaidaha, and other villages.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}} Seeing the common and the poor, he examined their lives with a depth and feeling singular in Indian literature up to that point.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=45&ndash;46}} In "The Fruitseller from Kabul", Tagore speaks in first person as a town dweller and novelist imputing exotic perquisites to an Afghan seller. He channels the lucubrative lust of those mired in the blas<U+00E9>, nidorous, sudorific morass of subcontinental city life: for distant vistas. "There were autumn mornings, the time of year when kings of old went forth to conquest; and I, never stirring from my little corner in Calcutta, would let my mind wander over the whole world. At the very name of another country, my heart would go out to it [...] I would fall to weaving a network of dreams: the mountains, the glens, the forest [...]."{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=48&ndash;49}}

The ''Golpoguchchho'' (''Bunch of Stories'') was written in Tagore's ''Sabuj Patra'' period, which spanned the years 1914&ndash;1917 and was named for another of his magazines.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}} These yarns are celebrated fare in Bengali fiction and provide much fodder for film and theatre. The Ray film ''[[Charulata]]'' echoed the controversial Tagore novella ''[[Nastanirh]]'' (''The Broken Nest''). In ''Atithi'', which was made into another film, the little Brahmin boy Tarapada shares a boat ride with a village ''zamindar''. The boy relates his flight from home and his subsequent wanderings, as was his wont. Taking pity, the elder adopts him; he fixes the boy to marry his own daughter. The night before his wedding, Tarapada runs off&mdash;again. ''Strir Patra'' (''The Wife's Letter'') is an early treatise in female emancipation.{{Sfn|Ray|2007|pp=59&ndash;60}} Mrinal is wife to a Bengali middle class man: prissy, preening, patriarchal. Travelling alone she writes a letter, which comprehends the story. She details the pettiness of a life spent entreating his viraginous virility; she resiles married life; she apostrophises, ''Amio bachbo. Ei bachlum'': "And I shall live. Here, I live."

''[[Haimanti]]'' assails Hindu arranged marriage and foregrounds their often dismal domesticity, the hypocrisies plaguing the Indian middle classes, and how Haimanti, a young woman, due to her insufferable sensitivity and free spirit, foredid herself. In the last passage Tagore blasts the reification of [[Sita]]'s self-immolation attempt; she had meant to appease her consort [[Rama]]'s doubts of her chastity. ''Musalmani Didi'' eyes recrudescent Hindu-Muslim tensions and, in many ways, embodies the essence of Tagore's humanism. The somewhat auto-referential ''Darpaharan'' describes a fey young man who harbours literary ambitions. Though he loves his wife, he wishes to stifle her literary career, deeming it unfeminine. In youth Tagore likely agreed with him. ''Darpaharan'' depicts the final humbling of the man as he ultimately acknowledges his wife's talents. As do many other Tagore stories, ''Jibito o Mrito'' equips Bengalis with a ubiquitous epigram: ''Kadombini moriya proman korilo she more nai''&mdash;"Kadombini died, thereby proving that she hadn't."

===Poetry===
Tagore's poetic style ranges from classical formalism to the comic, visionary, and ecstatic, yet proceeds from a lineage established by 15th- and 16th-century Vaishnava poets. His ken was the atavistic mysticism of the ''rishi''-authors of the [[Upanishad]]s ''<U+00E0> la'' [[Vyasa]], the [[Bhakti]]-[[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic [[Kabir]], and [[Ramprasad Sen]].{{Sfn|Roy|1977|p=201}} Tagore's most innovative and mature poetry embodies his exposure to Bengali rural folk music, which included mystic [[Baul]] ballads, and especially those of the bard [[Lalon]].{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=94}}{{Sfn|Urban|2001|p=18}} These, rediscovered and repopularised by Tagore, resemble 19th-century {{Unicode|Kart<U+0101>bhaj<U+0101>}} hymns that emphasise inward divinity and rebellion against bourgeois ''bhadralok'' religious and social orthodoxy.{{Sfn|Urban|2001|pp=6&ndash;7}}{{Sfn|Urban|2001|p=16}} During his Shelaidaha years, his poems took on a lyrical voice of the ''moner manush'', the B<U+0101>uls' "man within the heart" and Tagore's <U+201C>life force of his deep recesses", or meditating upon the ''jeevan devata'', the demiurge, the "living God within".{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} This figure connected with divinity through appeal to nature and the emotional interplay of human drama. Such tools saw use in his {{Unicode|Bh<U+0101>nusi<U+1E43>ha}} poems chronicling the [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]] romance; they were revised repeatedly over the course of seventy years.{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=95}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=7}}

Tagore reacted to the halfhearted uptake of modernist and realist techniques in Bengali literature by writing matching experimental works in the 1930s.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=281}} These include ''Africa'' and ''Camalia'', among the better known of his latter poems. He occasionally wrote poems using ''Shadhu Bhasha'', a Sanskritised dialect of Bengali; he later adopted a more popular dialect known as ''Cholti Bhasha''. Other works include ''Manasi'', ''Sonar Tori'' (''Golden Boat''), ''Balaka'' (''Wild Geese'', a name redolent of migrating souls),{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=192}} and ''Purobi''. ''Sonar Tori'''s most famous poem, dealing with the fleeting endurance of life and achievement, goes by the same name; hauntingly it ends: ''Shunno nodir tire rohinu po<U+0157>i / Jaha chhilo loe g<U+00EA>lo shonar tori''&mdash;"all I had achieved was carried off on the golden boat&mdash;only I was left behind." ''Gitanjali'' ({{Lang|bn|<U+0997><U+09C0><U+09A4><U+09BE><U+099E><U+09CD><U+099C><U+09B2><U+09BF>}}) is Tagore's best-known collection internationally, earning him his Nobel.{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|pp=95&ndash;96}}

Tagore's free-verse translation:

{{Cquote|
My song has put off her adornments.<br />
She has no pride of dress and decoration.<br />
Ornaments would mar our union; they would come<br />
between thee and me; their jingling would drown thy whispers.<br />
My poet's vanity dies in shame before thy sight.<br />
O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet.<br />
Only let me make my life simple and straight,<br />
like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.{{Sfn|Tagore|1952|p=5}}

Gloss by Tagore scholar [[Reba Som]]:

{{Cquote|
Forgive me my weariness O Lord<br />
Should I ever lag behind<br />
For this heart that this day trembles so<br />
And for this pain, forgive me, forgive me, O Lord<br />
For this weakness, forgive me O Lord,<br />
If perchance I cast a look behind<br />
And in the day's heat and under the burning sun<br />
The garland on the platter of offering wilts,<br />
For its dull pallor, forgive me, forgive me O Lord.{{Sfn|Tagore|Alam|Chakravarty|2011|p=323}}

Tagore's poetry has been set to music by composers: Arthur Shepherd's triptych for soprano and string quartet, [[Alexander Zemlinsky]]'s famous [[Lyric Symphony (Zemlinsky)|Lyric Symphony]], [[Josef Bohuslav Foerster]]'s cycle of love songs, [[Leo<U+0161> Jan<U+00E1><U+010D>ek]]'s famous chorus "Potuln<U+00FD> <U+0161><U+00ED>lenec" ("[[The Wandering Madman]]") for soprano, tenor, baritone, and male chorus&mdash;JW 4/43&mdash;inspired by Tagore's 1922 lecture in Czechoslovakia which Jan<U+00E1><U+010D>ek attended, and [[Garry Schyman]]'s "[[Stream of Life|Praan]]", an adaptation of Tagore's poem "Stream of Life" from ''Gitanjali''. The latter was composed and recorded with vocals by [[Palbasha Siddique]] to accompany Internet celebrity [[Matt Harding]]'s 2008 viral video.{{Sfn|Harding|2008}} In 1917 his words were translated adeptly and set to music by Anglo-Dutch composer [[Richard Hageman]] to produce a highly regarded art song: "Do Not Go, My Love".<!--(Ed. Schirmer NY 1917)--> The second movement of [[Jonathan Harvey (composer)|Jonathan Harvey]]'s "One Evening" (1994) sets an excerpt beginning "As I was watching the sunrise ..." from a letter of Tagore's, this composer having previously chosen a text by the poet for his piece "Song Offerings" (1985).{{Sfn|Harvey|1999|pp=59, 90}}

Tagore's political thought was tortured. He largely opposed imperialism and supported Indian nationalists.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=127}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=210}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=304}} His views have their first poetic release in ''Manast'', mostly composed in his twenties.{{Sfn|Scott|2009|p=10}} Evidence produced during the [[Hindu&ndash;German Conspiracy Trial]] and latter accounts affirm his awareness of the [[Hindu&ndash;German Conspiracy|Ghadarites]], and stated that he sought the support of Japanese Prime Minister [[Terauchi Masatake]] and former Premier [[<U+014C>kuma Shigenobu]].{{Sfn|Brown|1948|p=306}} Yet he lampooned the [[Swadeshi movement]] as brahminised barbermongering and philosophical ordure; his muscular rebuke to it was "The Cult of the [[Charkha|Charka]]", an acrid 1925 essay.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=261}} He exhorted the masses to eschew calumnious victimological foppery and hew instead to self-help and mental uplift; he attributed the congenital presence of British grifters to a condign "political symptom of our social disease". He held that even for reprobate peons at a loose end "there can be no question of blind revolution"; he would that they took to a "steady and purposeful education".{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=239&ndash;240}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=181}}

{{Quote box|quote=So I repeat we can never can have a true view of man unless we have a love for him. Civilisation must be judged and prized, not by the amount of power it has developed, but by how much it has evolved and given expression to, by its laws and institutions, the love of humanity.|source=&mdash; ''S<U+0101>dhan<U+0101>: The Realisation of Life'', 1916.{{Sfn|Tagore|1916|p=111}}|align=left|width=20%|fontsize=85%|quoted=1}}

Such views enraged many. He escaped a ghastly assassination&mdash;and only narrowly&mdash;by Indian expatriates during his stay in a San Francisco hotel in late 1916; the plot failed when his would-be assassins fell into argument.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=204}} Yet Tagore wrote songs lionizing the Indian independence movement and renounced his knighthood.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=215&ndash;216}} Two of Tagore's more politically charged compositions, "[[Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo]]" ("Where the Mind is Without Fear") and "[[Ekla Chalo Re]]" ("If They Answer Not to Thy Call, Walk Alone"), gained mass appeal, with the latter favoured by Gandhi.{{Sfn|Chakraborty|Bhattacharya|2001|p=157}} Given to criticising certain aspects of Gandhian activism,{{Sfn|Mehta|1999}} Tagore was yet key in resolving a Gandhi-[[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]] dispute involving separate electorates for untouchables and thereby mooting at least one of Gandhi's fasts "unto death".{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=306&ndash;307}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=339}}
Tagore retorted rote classroom schooling: in "The Parrot's Training", a bird is caged and force-fed textbook pages&mdash;to death.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=267}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Pal|2004}} Tagore, visiting Santa Barbara in 1917, conceived a new type of university: he sought to "make Santiniketan the connecting thread between India and the world [and] a world center for the study of humanity somewhere beyond the limits of nation and geography."{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=204}} The school, which he named Visva-Bharati,{{Cref|<U+03B7>}} had its foundation stone laid on 24 December 1918 and was inaugurated precisely three years later.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=220}} Tagore employed a ''[[brahmacharya]]'' system: ''gurus'' gave pupils personal guidance&mdash;emotional, intellectual, spiritual. Teaching was often done under trees. He staffed the school, he contributed his Nobel Prize monies,{{Sfn|Roy|1977|p=175}} and his duties as steward-mentor at Santiniketan kept him busy: mornings he taught classes; afternoons and evenings he wrote the students' textbooks.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=27}} He fundraised widely for the school in Europe and the United States between 1919 and 1921.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=221}}

Tagore's relevance can be gauged by the honours paid him: ''Kabipranam'', Tagore's birth anniversary; the annual Tagore Festival held in Urbana, Illinois; grueling ''Rabindra Path Parikrama'' walking pilgrimages from Calcutta to Santiniketan; austere recitals of Tagore's poetry held on important anniversaries.{{Sfn|UIUC}}{{Sfn|Chakrabarti|2001}}{{Sfn|Hatcher|2001}} Bengali culture is fraught with this legacy: from language and arts to history and politics. [[Amartya Sen]] scantly deemed Tagore a "towering figure", a "deeply relevant and many-sided contemporary thinker".{{Sfn|Hatcher|2001}} Tagore's Bengali source&mdash;the 1939 ''{{Unicode|Rab<U+012B>ndra Rachan<U+0101>val<U+012B>}}''&mdash;is canonised as one of his nation's greatest cultural treasures, and he was roped into a reasonably humble role: "the greatest poet India has produced".{{Sfn|K<U+00E4>mpchen|2003}}

{{Quote box|quote=Who are you, reader, reading my poems an hundred years hence?<br />I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds.<br />Open your doors and look abroad.<br />From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of an hundred years before.<br />In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across an hundred years.<br />|source=&mdash; ''The Gardener'', 1915.{{Sfn|Tagore|Ray|2007|p=104}}|align=left|width=20%|fontsize=85%|quoted=1}}

Tagore was famed throughout much of Europe, North America, and East Asia. He co-founded [[Dartington Hall School]], a progressive coeducational institution;{{Sfn|Farrell|2000|p=162}} in Japan, he influenced such figures as Nobel laureate [[Yasunari Kawabata]].{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=202}} Tagore's works were widely translated into English, Dutch, German, Spanish, and other European languages by Czech indologist [[Vincenc Lesn<U+00FD>]],{{Sfn|Cameron|2006}} French Nobel laureate [[Andr<U+00E9> Gide]], Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]],{{Sfn|Sen|2006|p=90}} former Turkish Prime Minister [[B<U+00FC>lent Ecevit]],{{Sfn|Kinzer|2006}} and others. In the United States, Tagore's lecturing circuits, particularly those of 1916&ndash;1917, were widely attended and wildly acclaimed. Some controversies{{Cref|<U+03B8>}} involving Tagore, possibly fictive, trashed his popularity and sales in Japan and North America after the late 1920s, concluding with his "near total eclipse" outside Bengal.{{Sfn|Sen|1997}} Yet a vestigial Latin reverence of Tagore was discovered by an astonished [[Salman Rushdie]] during a trip to Nicaragua.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=255}}

Via translations Tagore influenced Chileans [[Pablo Neruda]] and [[Gabriela Mistral]], Mexican writer [[Octavio Paz]], and Spaniards [[Jos<U+00E9> Ortega y Gasset]], [[Zenobia Camprub<U+00ED>]], and [[Juan Ram<U+00F3>n Jim<U+00E9>nez]]. In the years 1914&ndash;1922 the Jim<U+00E9>nez-Camprub<U+00ED> pair wrought twenty-two Spanish translations of Tagore's English corpus; they heavily revised the ''The Crescent Moon'' and other key titles. In this years Jim<U+00E9>nez contrived landmark "naked poetry".{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=254&ndash;255}} Ortega y Gasset wrote that "Tagore's wide appeal [owes to how] he speaks of longings for perfection that we all have [...] Tagore awakens a dormant sense of childish wonder, and he saturates the air with all kinds of enchanting promises for the reader, who [...] pays little attention to the deeper import of Oriental mysticism". Tagore's works circulated in free editions around 1920&mdash;alongside those of [[Plato]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]].

Tagore was deemed overrated by some. [[Graham Greene]] doubted that "anyone but Mr. Yeats can still take his poems very seriously." Several prominent Western admirers&mdash;including Pound and, to a lesser extent, even Yeats&mdash;foreswore Tagore's work. Yeats, disgusted with the scribbling colonial's irksome subliminal complexity and the seeming perennial mediocrity of his self-rendered English translations, railed against that "Damn Tagore [...] We got out three good books, Sturge Moore and I, and then, because he thought it more important to know English than to be a great poet, he brought out sentimental rubbish and wrecked his reputation. Tagore does not know English, no Indian knows English."{{Sfn|Sen|1997}}{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2001}} [[William Radice]], who "English[ed]" his poems, asked: "What is their place in world literature?"{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|p=26}} He saw him as "kind of counter-cultur[al]," bearing "a new kind of classicism" to heal the zetetic "collapsed romantic confusion and chaos of the 20th [c]entury."{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2001}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|pp=26&ndash;31}} The translated Tagore was "almost nonsensical".{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|pp=18&ndash;19}} His subpar English offerings thus eclipsed the seemingly peerless Bengali originals&mdash;and hence in part effaced his trans-national appeal:

{{Cquote|1=[...] anyone who knows Tagore's poems in their original Bengali cannot feel satisfied with any of the translations (made with or without Yeats's help). Even the translations of his prose works suffer, to some extent, from distortion. E.M. Forster noted [of] ''The Home and the World'' [that] "[t]he theme is so beautiful," but the charms have "vanished in translation," or perhaps "in an experiment that has not quite come off."|4=[[Amartya Sen]]|5="Tagore and His India".{{Sfn|Sen|1997}}}}
