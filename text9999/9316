'''''Henry V''''' is a [[1989 in film|1989]] film directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]] based upon the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] [[Henry V (play)|play]] about the [[Henry V of England|famous English King]]. Branagh stars in the title role with [[Derek Jacobi]] as the Chorus (a narrator). [[Brian Blessed]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Jimmy Yuill]] and [[Emma Thompson]] are among the other stars, whilst [[Robbie Coltrane]] and [[Judi Dench]] have the cameo roles of Falstaff and Mistress Quickly, both of them major characters in other Shakespearean plays.  Another minor character, [[Michael Williams (character)|"Michael Williams"]], is played by the actor [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]], Judi Dench's husband in real life. 

The film was produced by [[Bruce Sharman]] with the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[Renaissance Films]].  Whereas [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944 film]] used the Elizabethan Globe theatre as a setting in which to introduce the action, the 1989 version used a film set as the background to Chorus's opening speech.

The visual and verbal styles of the film are much grittier than those of the Olivier adaptation, particularly with respect to the [[Battle of Agincourt]] scenes, which are strongly reminiscent of the battle scenes in the films of [[Akira Kurosawa]], or the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] in Orson Welles's ''[[Chimes at Midnight|Chimes At Midnight]]''. In addition the film also features a cameo of [[Falstaff]], a character who plays a major role in [[Henry IV part 1]] and [[2|Henry IV part 2]] but is absent in appearance in Henry V (Falstaff is announced to be deathly ill in Act 2 Scene 1 and dead in Act 2 scene 3). The cameo features a brief summary of Henry's denouncement of Falstaff primarily with lines from Act 2, Scene 4 of Henry IV part 1 and a brief but albeit important utterance of Henry's final repudiation of Falstaff in Part 2, "I know thee not, old man." The film's budget was $9 million.

One of the most surprising roles was that of Mountjoy, the French herald. Although he appears only in a few short scenes (and always wears the same royal-blue garment), he is given several memorable lines. Mountjoy was also named in Olivier's film and the 1979 [[BBC]] television version.

==Reception==
''Henry V'' received near-universal critical acclaim for Branagh's Oscar-nominated performance and direction, for the accessibility of its Shakespearean language and particularly for its music by first-time composer [[Patrick Doyle]], which was performed by the [[City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra]] and conducted by [[Simon Rattle]].  

The film grossed $10 million in the U.S. and at the time of its widest release played on 134 U.S. screens. [[Phyllis Dalton]] won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] and Kenneth Branagh, in his directorial debut, was nominated for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] as well as [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]].
