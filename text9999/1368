The album was recorded at Battery Studios in [[England]], and at [[The Warehouse Studio]] in [[Vancouver]], mixed at Mayfair Studios in England, and mastered by [[Bob Ludwig]] at [[Masterdisk]] in [[New York City]]. "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]" was number one on the British charts for a record-breaking sixteen weeks.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web

The album was also notable in Canada for creating controversy concerning the system of [[Canadian content]].<ref name="Canadian Content" /> Although Adams was one of Canada's biggest recording star at the time, his collaboration with the [[United Kingdom|British]]<U+2013>[[Whites in Zimbabwe|White-Zimbabwean]] Lange meant that, under the rules in force until 1991, ''Waking up the Neighbours'' did not qualify as Canadian content.<ref name="Canadian Content" />

In September of that year, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] announced that the Canadian content rules would be changed to allow collaborations with non-Canadians.<ref name="Canadian Content">{{cite web

==Music==
===Recording and production===
The tune for "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You" had been written by Kamen in the 60s.<ref name="BBC 2" /> When he was finished he sent it to Adams and Lange who wrote the lyrics and instead of using traditional instrumentation for a medieval lyric gave it a rock treatment featuring Little Feat<U+2019>s Billy Payne on keyboards.<ref name="BBC 2" /> On its release it topped the charts in 16 countries and sold over eight million copies worldwide becoming one of the biggest selling singles of all time.<ref name="BBC 2" /> The song was nominated for an Academy Award but it lost to the Disney theme <U+201C>Beauty and The Beast<U+201D>.<ref name="BBC 2">{{cite web

[[Robert Lange|Robert John "Mutt" Lange]], previously known for his work with [[AC/DC]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], and [[Def Leppard]], was helping Adams' writing the songs for his next album. Adams' spent much of his time in England with Lange working on his sixth album.<ref name="canhedian" />

When the [[BBC]] asked Adams' "Do you ever get bored of hearing your record-breaking hit Everything I Do?" Adams said

<blockquote>
"Of course not. What a silly question. Everyone has heard the big production of the record many times, so that now I sing it very simply with my acoustic guitar, which is the way it was meant to be played when it was first written."<ref name="BBC 4">{{cite web

</blockquote>

In 1991, Adams was approached by the producers of the upcoming Kevin Costner film, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and asked to work on a theme song. He was provided a melody written by the composer of the movie's score, Michael Kamen.<ref name="canhedian" /> With this, he and Lange fashioned "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You," which he also recorded and which played under the closing credits of the film when it opened on June 14, 1991.<ref name="canhedian">{{cite web

"[[Can't Stop This Thing We Started]]" was the second single from the album. A rock song in contrast to "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]", it peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], behind [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[Cream (song)|Cream]]".<ref name="Billboard" />
"Can't Stop This Thing We Started" received two nominations at the [[Grammy Awards of 1992]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo|Best Rock Performance, Solo]], winning none.<ref name="Allmusic bio" />

"[[There Will Never Be Another Tonight]]" is the third single from the album. The title came from a fragment Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance wrote in late 1980s. The phrase was written into the song in the end of 1990 and released on Adams' album in 1991.  

A live version was later recorded and was released as the b-side of the single "Please Forgive Me".

"[[Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven]]" is one of the tracks on the applauded [[Bryan Adams]] [[1991]]-release ''Waking up the Neighbours''. Penned down by [[Jim Vallance]] and Bryan Adams the song has much rock flavour in its music part, however lyrically it's a love song.

"Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven" reached #13 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] and #14 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]]. In the [[UK]], it reached #8.<ref name="UK" /><ref name="Billboard" />

==Canadian content==
{{Expand-section|date=July 2008}}
The album made much controversy in [[Canada]] concerning the system of [[Canadian Content]]<ref name="Canadian Content" /> Although Adams was one of Canada's biggest recording star at the time, his collaboration with non Canadians ment that the album and songs were not Canadian.<ref name="Canadian Content" />

In February 1992 Adams had issues with his homeland<U+2019>s <U+201C>Canadian Content<U+201D> regulations, which restricted airplay of his album because Adams co-wrote and co-produced the record with an Englishman, Robert John <U+201C>Mutt<U+201D> Lange.<ref name="Bryan Adams biography" /> Adams briefly threatened to boycott the annual [[Juno Awards]], (Canada<U+2019>s equivalent of the Grammys), where he ended up winning Entertainer and Producer of the Year awards.<ref name="Bryan Adams biography">{{cite web

Adams called the [[Canadian Content]] rule "a disgrace, a shame...stupidity." and said:

<blockquote>
"You'd never hear [[Elton John]] being declared un-[[United Kingdom|British]]," Adams continues. He's so angry that he says it's time to abolish the CRTC. Not everyone agrees."<ref name="Canadian Content" />
</blockquote>

In September of that year, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] announced that the Canadian content rules would be changed to allow collaborations with non-Canadians.<ref name="Canadian Content" />
