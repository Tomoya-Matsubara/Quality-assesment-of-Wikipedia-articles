'''Illarion Mikhailovich Pryanishnikov''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0418><U+043B><U+043B><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D> <U+041C><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0439><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+041F><U+0440><U+044F><U+043D><U+0438><U+0448><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>}}) ({{OldStyleDate|20 March|1840|1 April}} &ndash; {{OldStyleDate|12 March|1894|24 March}}) was a [[Russia]]n [[painter]], one of the founders of the [[Peredvizhniki]] artistic cooperative.

Illarion Pryanishnikov was born in the village of Timashovo (today's [[Kaluga Oblast]]) in a family of merchants. From [[1856]] to [[1866]] he studied in the [[Moscow School of painting, sculpturing and architecture]] in the classes of [[Evgraf Sorokin]] and [[Sergey Zaryanko]].

His picture ''Jokers. [[Gostiny Dvor]] in Moscow'', painted in the last year of education, straight away brought to him a wide reputation. In this small canvas he gives an original solution of a theme of the humiliation of human dignity, callousness and cruelty in the world, where everything is bought and is sold. After depicting the tipsy merchants, who with a jeer are compelled to dance under the concertina and a poor elderly official, the artist authentically demonstrates a whole gallery of the specimens of moral deformity and complacent caddishness. The painting caused the indignation in some adherents of official academic art who felt that the young painter appeared as the destroyer of the "high" destination of the art which was to express in the ideal form the eternal truths.

In [[1870]] Pryanishnikov received the title of the "painter of 1st degree". From [[1873]] until his death he was a teacher in the MSoPSA and his apprentices were [[Konstantin Korovin]], [[Vitold Byalynitsky-Birulya]], [[Mikhail Nesterov]] and others.

From the outset of the existence of the union of [[Peredvizhniki|Peredvizhniks]], he was a member, and from the second exhibition he was one of directors of the union. Although Pryanishnikov lived in mainly in [[Moscow]], he often visited the Russian Nord where sketched. He took part in the decoration of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]].

Pryanishnikov died in Moscow where one of the streets named after him.
