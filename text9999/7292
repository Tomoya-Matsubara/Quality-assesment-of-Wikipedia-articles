'''Jupiter''' is the fifth [[planet]] from the [[Sun]] and the [[Solar system by size|largest]] planet within the [[Solar System]].<ref>As of 2008, the largest known planet outside the Solar System is [[TrES-4]].</ref> It is a [[gas giant]] with a [[mass]] slightly less than one-thousandth of the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in our Solar System combined. Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the [[Wiktionary:Jovian|Jovian]] planets.

The planet was known by [[astronomer]]s of ancient times and was associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] named the planet after the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].<ref name="etymologyonline"/> When viewed from [[Earth]], Jupiter can reach an [[apparent magnitude]] of <U+2212>2.94, making it on average the third-brightest object in the [[night sky]] after the [[Moon]] and [[Venus]]. ([[Mars]] can briefly match Jupiter's brightness at [[opposition (astronomy)|certain points]] in its orbit.)

Jupiter is primarily composed of [[hydrogen]] with a quarter of its mass being [[helium]]; it may also have a rocky core of heavier elements. Because of its rapid rotation, Jupiter's shape is that of an [[oblate spheroid]] (it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the [[Great Red Spot]], a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by [[telescope]]. Surrounding the planet is a faint [[planetary ring]] system and a powerful [[magnetosphere]]. There are also at least 63 moons, including the four large moons called the [[Galilean moons]] that were first discovered by [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1610. [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], the largest of these moons, has a diameter greater than that of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by [[robotic spacecraft]], most notably during the early [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] and [[Voyager program|Voyager]] flyby missions and later by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo orbiter]]. The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the [[Pluto]]-bound [[New Horizons]] spacecraft in late February 2007. The probe [[Gravitational slingshot|used the gravity]] from Jupiter to increase its speed. Future targets for exploration in the Jovian system include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].

==Structure==

Jupiter is one of the four [[gas giant]]s; that is, it is not primarily composed of solid matter. It is the largest planet in the Solar System, having a diameter of 142,984&nbsp;km at its [[equator]]. Jupiter's density, 1.326&nbsp;g/cm<U+00B3>, is the second highest of the gas giant planets, but lower than any of the four [[terrestrial planet]]s.

===Composition===
Jupiter's upper atmosphere is composed of about 88<U+2013>92% hydrogen and 8<U+2013>12% helium by percent volume or fraction of gas [[molecule]]s (see table to the right). Since a helium [[atom]] has about four times as much [[mass]] as a [[hydrogen]] atom, the composition changes when described as the proportion of mass contributed by different atoms. Thus the [[Atmosphere of Jupiter|atmosphere]] is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with the remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements. The interior contains denser materials such that the distribution is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium and 5% other elements by mass. The atmosphere contains trace amounts of [[methane]], [[water vapor]], [[ammonia]], and [[silicon]]-based compounds. There are also traces of [[carbon]], [[ethane]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[neon]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphine]], and [[sulfur]]. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains [[crystal]]s of frozen ammonia.<ref name=voyager>{{cite journal

Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had much more mass than it does at present, the planet would shrink. For small changes in mass, the [[radius]] would not change appreciably, and above about four Jupiter masses the interior would become so much more compressed under the increased gravitation force that the planet's volume would ''decrease'' despite the increasing amount of matter. As a result, Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition and evolutionary history can achieve. The process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable [[stellar ignition]] is achieved as in high-mass [[brown dwarf]]s around 50 Jupiter masses.<ref name="tristan286">{{cite journal

===Internal structure===
[[File:Jupiter interior.png|right|thumb|This cut-away illustrates a model of the interior of Jupiter, with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of [[metallic hydrogen]].]]
Jupiter is thought to consist of a dense [[planetary core|core]] with a mixture of elements, a surrounding layer of liquid [[metallic hydrogen]] with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of [[molecular hydrogen]].<ref name="guillot04"/> Beyond this basic outline, there is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as [[Rock (geology)|rocky]], but its detailed composition is unknown, as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below). In 1997, the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements,<ref name="guillot04"/> indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times the Earth's mass or roughly 3%<U+2013>15% of the total mass of Jupiter.<ref name="elkins-tanton" /><ref>{{cite journal

The presence of a core during at least part of Jupiter's history is suggested by models of planetary formation involving initial formation of a rocky or icy core that is massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the [[Nebular hypothesis|protosolar nebula]]. Assuming it did exist, it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior. A core may now be entirely absent, as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely.<ref name="guillot04"/><ref>{{cite book

The uncertainty of the models is tied to the error margin in hitherto measured parameters: one of the rotational coefficients (J<sub>6</sub>) used to describe the planet's gravitational moment, Jupiter's equatorial radius, and its temperature at 1 bar pressure. The [[Juno (spacecraft)|JUNO mission]], scheduled for launch in 2011, is expected to narrow down the value of these parameters, and thereby make progress on the problem of the core.<ref>{{cite journal

Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds composed of ammonia crystals and possibly [[ammonium hydrosulfide]]. The clouds are located in the [[tropopause]] and are arranged into bands of different [[latitude]]s, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued ''zones'' and darker ''belts''. The interactions of these conflicting [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] patterns cause storms and [[turbulence]].

Jupiter's low [[axial tilt]] means that the poles constantly receive less [[solar radiation]] than at the planet's equatorial region. [[Convection]] within the interior of the planet transports more energy to the poles, however, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.<ref name="burgess" />

===Great Red Spot and other vortices===
[[File:Great Red Spot From Voyager 1.jpg|thumbnail|250px|This dramatic view of Jupiter's Great Red Spot and its surroundings was obtained by [[Voyager 1]] on February 25, 1979, when the spacecraft was 9.2&nbsp;million&nbsp;km (5.7&nbsp;million&nbsp;mi) from Jupiter.

Storms such as this are common within the [[turbulent]] [[celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of [[gas giant]]s. Jupiter also has white ovals and brown ovals, which are lesser unnamed storms. White ovals tend to consist of relatively cool clouds within the upper atmosphere. Brown ovals are warmer and located within the "normal cloud layer". Such storms can last as little as a few hours or stretch on for centuries.

[[:File:Jupiter from Voyager 1 PIA02855 max quality.ogv|Full size video here]]]]
Even before Voyager proved that the feature was a storm, there was strong evidence that the spot could not be associated with any deeper feature on the planet's surface, as the Spot rotates differentially with respect to the rest of the atmosphere, sometimes faster and sometimes more slowly. During its recorded history it has traveled several times around the planet relative to any possible fixed rotational marker below it.

In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller. This was created when several smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature<U+2014>these three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938. The merged feature was named [[Oval BA]], and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior. It has since increased in intensity and changed color from white to red.<ref>{{cite web

In addition, the very bright almost circular region, called the main oval, and the fainter polar aurora can be seen.]]
Jupiter's broad [[magnetic field]] is 14 times as strong as the Earth's, ranging from 4.2&nbsp;[[gauss (unit)|gauss]] (0.42 [[millitesla|mT]]) at the equator to 10<U+2013>14 gauss (1.0<U+2013>1.4 mT) at the poles, making it the strongest in the Solar System (except for [[sunspot]]s).<ref name="worldbook" /> This field is believed to be generated by [[eddy current]]s<U+2014>swirling movements of conducting materials<U+2014>within the metallic hydrogen core. The volcanoes on the moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] emit large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] forming a gas torus along the moon's orbit. The gas is ionized in the magnetosphere producing [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]] [[ion]]s. They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a [[Current sheet|plasma sheet]] in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet causing deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that of magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong [[radio]] signature that produces bursts in the range of 0.6<U+2013>30&nbsp;[[hertz|MHz]].<ref>{{cite news

|accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref>

At about 75 Jupiter radii from the planet, the interaction of the magnetosphere with the [[solar wind]] generates a [[bow shock]]. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a [[magnetopause]], located at the inner edge of a [[magnetosheath]]<U+2014>a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's [[lee side]] and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.<ref name="elkins-tanton" />

The magnetosphere of Jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of [[radio]] emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on the Jovian moon Io (see below) injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates [[Alfv<U+00E9>n wave]]s that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a [[cyclotron]] [[Astrophysical maser|maser mechanism]], and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When the Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.<ref>{{cite web

Jupiter's [[rotation]] is the fastest of all the Solar System's planets, completing a rotation on its [[Coordinate axis|axis]] in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an [[equatorial bulge]] easily seen through an Earth-based amateur [[telescope]]. This rotation requires a [[centripetal acceleration]] at the equator of about 1.67&nbsp;m/s<U+00B2>, compared to the equatorial surface gravity of 24.79&nbsp;m/s<U+00B2>; thus the net acceleration felt at the equatorial surface is only about 23.12&nbsp;m/s<U+00B2>. The planet is shaped as an [[oblate]] spheroid, meaning that the [[diameter]] across its [[equator]] is longer than the diameter measured between its [[geographic pole|poles]]. On Jupiter, the equatorial diameter is 9275&nbsp;km longer than the diameter measured through the poles.<ref name="lang03" />

Because Jupiter is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere undergoes [[differential rotation]]. The rotation of Jupiter's [[polar region|polar]] atmosphere is about 5&nbsp;minutes longer than that of the equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10<U+00B0>&nbsp;N to 10<U+00B0>&nbsp;S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by [[radio astronomy|radio astronomers]], and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's [[magnetosphere]]; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.<ref>{{cite book

==Observation==
[[File:Retrogadation1.png|right|thumb|The retrograde motion of an outer planet is caused by its relative location with respect to the Earth.]]
Jupiter is usually the fourth brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the [[Moon]] and [[Venus]]);<ref name="worldbook" /> however at times [[Mars#Viewing|Mars]] appears brighter than Jupiter. Depending on Jupiter's position with respect to the [[Earth]], it can vary in visual magnitude from as bright as <U+2212>2.9 at [[Opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] down to <U+2212>1.6 during [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun. The [[angular diameter]] of Jupiter likewise varies from 50.1 to 29.8 [[arc second]]s.<ref name="fact"/> Favorable oppositions occur when Jupiter is passing through perihelion, an event that occurs once per orbit. As Jupiter approaches [[Apsis|perihelion]] in March 2011, there will be a favorable opposition in September 2010.<ref name=jup2010>{{cite web

Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a duration called the [[synodic period]]. As it does so, Jupiter appears to undergo [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde motion]] with respect to the background stars. That is, for a period Jupiter seems to move backward in the night sky, performing a looping motion.

Jupiter's 12-year orbital period corresponds to the dozen [[astrological sign]]s<!--note: this should *not*be the constellations, which have nothing to do with either Jupiter's orbit or the astrological signs, other than giving them their names--> of the [[zodiac]], and may have been the historical origin of the signs.<ref name="burgess" /> That is, each time Jupiter reaches opposition it has advanced eastward by about 30<U+00B0>, the width of a zodiac sign.

Because the orbit of Jupiter is outside the Earth's, the [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]] of Jupiter as viewed from the Earth never exceeds 11.5<U+00B0>. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of
the planet were obtained.<ref>{{cite web

===Ground-based telescope research===
In 1610, [[Galileo Galilei]] discovered the four largest [[natural satellite|moons]] of Jupiter - Io, Europa, Ganymede and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] (now known as the [[Galilean moon]]s) - using a telescope; thought to be the first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth's. Galileo's was also the first discovery of a [[celestial mechanics|celestial motion]] not apparently centered on the Earth. It was a major point in favor of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus']] [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of the motions of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory placed him under the threat of the [[Inquisition]].<ref>{{cite web

During the 1660s, Cassini used a new telescope to discover spots and colorful bands on Jupiter and observed that the planet appeared oblate; that is, flattened at the poles. He was also able to estimate the rotation period of the planet.<ref name= "cassini">{{cite web

The Great Red Spot, a prominent oval-shaped feature in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter, may have been observed as early as 1664 by [[Robert Hooke]] and in 1665 by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni Cassini]], although this is disputed. The pharmacist [[Samuel Heinrich Schwabe|Heinrich Schwabe]] produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the Great Red Spot in 1831.<ref>{{cite book

The Red Spot was reportedly lost from sight on several occasions between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878. It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the twentieth century.<ref>{{cite web

Both [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli|Giovanni Borelli]] and Cassini made careful tables of the motions of the Jovian moons, allowing predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, however, it was observed that when Jupiter was on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth, these events would occur about 17&nbsp;minutes later than expected. [[Ole R<U+00F8>mer]] deduced that sight is not instantaneous (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected<ref name="cassini" />), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the [[speed of light]].<ref>{{cite web

Three long-lived anticyclonic features termed white ovals were observed in 1938. For several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere, sometimes approaching each other but never merging. Finally, two of the ovals merged in 1998, then absorbed the third in 2000, becoming [[Oval BA]].<ref>{{cite journal

===Radiotelescope research===
In 1955, Bernard Burke and [[Kenneth Franklin]] detected bursts of radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2&nbsp;MHz.<ref name="elkins-tanton" /> The period of these bursts matched the rotation of the planet, and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.<ref>{{cite web

Scientists discovered that there were three forms of radio signals transmitted from Jupiter.
* Decametric radio bursts (with a wavelength of tens of meters) vary with the rotation of Jupiter, and are influenced by interaction of Io with Jupiter's magnetic field.<ref>{{cite web

* Decimetric radio emission (with wavelengths measured in centimeters) was first observed by [[Frank Drake]] and Hein Hvatum in 1959.<ref name="elkins-tanton" /> The origin of this signal was from a torus-shaped belt around Jupiter's equator. This signal is caused by [[cyclotron radiation]] from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.<ref>{{cite web

===Exploration with space probes===
{{Main|Exploration of Jupiter}}
Since 1973 a number of automated spacecraft have visited Jupiter, most notably the [[Pioneer 10]] space probe, the first spacecraft to get close enough to Jupiter to send back revelations about the properties and phenomena of the solar system's largest planet.<ref>[http://quest.nasa.gov/sso/cool/pioneer10/mission/ NASA <U+2013> Pioneer 10 Mission Profile]</ref><ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/pioneer.html NASA <U+2013> Glenn Research Center]</ref> Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in [[energy]], which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or [[delta-v]].

Beginning in 1973, several spacecraft have performed planetary flyby maneuvers that brought them within observation range of Jupiter. The ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]'' missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Occultations of the radio signals by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter and the amount of polar flattening.<ref name="burgess" /><ref name="cosmology 101">{{cite web

Six years later, the ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' missions vastly improved the understanding of the [[Galilean moon]]s and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the ''Pioneer'' missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.<ref name="voyager">{{cite web |date= January 14, 2003|url = http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/jupiter.html|title = Jupiter|publisher = NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate = 2006-11-28}}</ref><ref name="burgess" />

The next mission to encounter Jupiter, the ''Ulysses'' solar probe, performed a flyby maneuver to attain a polar orbit around the Sun. During this pass the spacecraft conducted studies on Jupiter's magnetosphere. However, since ''Ulysses'' has no cameras, no images were taken. A second flyby six years later was at a much greater distance.<ref name="ulysses">{{cite web|author = Chan, K.; Paredes, E. S.; Ryne, M.

In 2000, the ''Cassini'' probe, ''en route'' to [[Saturn]], flew by Jupiter and provided some of the highest-resolution images ever made of the planet. On December 19, 2000, the spacecraft captured an image of the moon [[Himalia (moon)|Himalia]], but the resolution was too low to show surface details.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hansen, C.

====Galileo mission====
[[File:PIA04866 modest.jpg|thumb|left|Jupiter as seen by the space probe [[Cassini<U+2013>Huygens|Cassini]].]]

So far the only spacecraft to orbit Jupiter is the ''[[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]]'' orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995. It orbited the planet for over seven years, conducting multiple flybys of all the Galilean moons and [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]]. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] as it approached Jupiter in 1994, giving a unique vantage point for the event. However, while the information gained about the Jovian system from ''Galileo'' was extensive, its originally designed capacity was limited by the failed deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna.<ref name="galileo">{{cite web|last = McConnell|first = Shannon |date= April 14, 2003|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/|title = Galileo: Journey to Jupiter|publisher = NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate = 2006-11-28}}</ref>

An atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7. It parachuted through 150&nbsp;km of the atmosphere, collected data for 57.6&nbsp;minutes, and was crushed by the pressure to which it was subjected by that time (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153&nbsp;<U+00B0>C).<ref>{{cite web|first = Julio|last = Magalh<U+00E3>es|date = December 10, 1996|url = http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/galileo_probe/htmls/probe_events.html|title = Galileo Probe Mission Events|publisher = NASA Space Projects Division|accessdate = 2007-02-02}}</ref> It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The ''Galileo'' orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003, at a speed of over 50&nbsp;km/s, to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and possibly contaminating Europa<U+2014>a moon which has been hypothesized to have the possibility of [[Europa (moon)#Potential for extraterrestrial life|harboring life]].<ref name="galileo" />

{{See also|Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons}}

Jupiter has 63 named [[natural satellite]]s. Of these, 47 are less than 10&nbsp;kilometres in diameter and have only been discovered since 1975. The four largest moons, known as the "[[Galilean moons]]", are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

===Galilean moons===

The orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede, some of the largest satellites in the Solar System, form a pattern known as a [[Laplace resonance]]; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the [[gravity|gravitational]] effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, since each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors at the same point in every orbit it makes. The [[tidal force]] from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Musotto, S.; Varadi, F.; Moore, W. B.; Schubert, G.|title=Numerical simulations of the orbits of the Galilean satellites|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13969974|journal=Icarus|year=2002|volume=159|pages=500<U+2013>504 |doi = 10.1006/icar.2002.6939}}</ref>

The [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of their orbits causes regular flexing of the three moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing [[Tidal acceleration#Tidal heating|heats]] the moons' interiors by [[friction]]. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary [[Io (moon)#Volcanism|volcanic activity]] of innermost Io (which is subject to the strongest tidal forces), and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of [[Europa (moon)#Surface features|Europa's surface]] (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).

===Classification of moons===
[[File:Europa-moon.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Jupiter's [[natural satellite|moon]] Europa.]]
Before the discoveries of the Voyager missions, Jupiter's moons were arranged neatly into four groups of four, based on commonality of their [[orbital elements]]. Since then, the large number of new small outer moons has complicated this picture. There are now thought to be six main groups, although some are more distinct than others.

A basic sub-division is a grouping of the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and are believed to have formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are believed to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jewitt, D.

==Interaction with the Solar System==
Along with the Sun, the [[gravity|gravitational]] influence of Jupiter has helped shape the Solar System. The orbits of most of the system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] than the Sun's [[celestial equator|equatorial plane]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the [[Kirkwood gap]]s in the [[asteroid belt]] are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] of the inner Solar System's history.<ref>{{cite journal

==Possibility of life==<!-- This section is linked from [[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]] -->
In 1953, the [[Miller<U+2013>Urey experiment]] demonstrated that a combination of lightning and the chemical compounds that existed in the atmosphere of a primordial Earth could form organic compounds (including [[amino acid]]s) that could serve as the building blocks of life. The simulated atmosphere included water, methane, ammonia and molecular hydrogen; all molecules still found in the atmosphere of Jupiter. However, the atmosphere of Jupiter has a strong vertical air circulation, which would carry these compounds down into the lower regions. The higher temperatures within the interior of the atmosphere breaks down these chemicals, which would hinder the formation of Earth-like life.<ref>{{cite web

It is considered highly unlikely that there is any Earth-like [[extraterrestrial life|life]] on Jupiter, as there is only a small amount of water in the atmosphere and any possible solid surface deep within Jupiter would be under extraordinary pressures. However, in 1976, before the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions, it was hypothesized that ammonia or [[water]]-based life could evolve in Jupiter's upper atmosphere. This hypothesis is based on the ecology of terrestrial seas which have simple [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[plankton]] at the top level, [[fish]] at lower levels feeding on these creatures, and marine [[predator]]s which hunt the fish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/J/Jupiterlife.html

The possible presence of underground oceans on some of Jupiter's moons has led to speculation that the presence of life is more likely there.
