'''WINC''' (1400 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a broadcast [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] licensed to [[Winchester, Virginia]], United States.  The station carries a [[all-news radio|news]], [[talk radio|talk]], and [[sports radio|sports]] format.  WINC serves Winchester along with [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] and [[Clarke County, Virginia|Clarke]] Counties in [[Virginia]].

Launched on July 26, 1941, by Richard Field Lewis, Jr., WINC was Winchester's first radio station.  It remained in the hands of the Lewis family until sold to North Carolina-based [[Centennial Broadcasting]] in 2007.  The station's current [[Radio format|format]], established in 1996, consists mostly of [[Conservative talk radio|conservative talk]] programs and top-of-the-hour news from [[Fox News Radio]].  Sports programming from [[Virginia Tech]] is also broadcast.  Prior formats heard on WINC include [[middle of the road (music)|middle of the road music]], [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]], and [[classic hits]].

Several milestones have occurred during the station's more-than-70 years of history.  WINC was the station on which [[country music]] legend [[Patsy Cline]] made her debut in 1948, when Cline asked the leader of a "hillbilly band" for a chance to perform with them on air.<ref name="PatsyDebut"/>  In the late 1950s, the station's chief engineer, Philip Whitney, designed a [[CONELRAD]] alarm device for FM stations to warn listeners in the event of an enemy attack during the [[Cold War]].  Whitney also created many of the [[radio control|remote control systems]] used by radio stations.  He was awarded for his work by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] in 1970.  WINC had difficulty renewing its license in the early 1970s, as it was airing 22 minutes of commercials per hour<U+2014>in excess of what the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) permitted. The station encountered further trouble in 1988 when a local prosecutor called one of its promotions an "illegal cash lottery"; a judge disagreed.<ref name="Lottery"/>  In that same year, the news department at WINC received an Associated Press Broadcasters Association national award for "Best Radio Spot News".<ref name="APAward"/>

While attempting to renew the station's license in early 1971, Mid-Atlantic Network ran into trouble with the FCC due to the quantity of commercials the station was airing.<ref name="Commercials"/> The station was carrying 22 minutes of commercials an hour according to a letter from then-FCC Broadcast Bureau Chief Francis R.
