This '''list of tallest buildings in Providence''' ranks [[high-rise]]s in the city of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]] by height. The tallest [[skyscraper]] in the city is currently the [[Bank of America Tower (Providence)|Bank of America Building]], which rises 428 [[foot (unit of measurement)|feet]] (130 [[meter|meters]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=bankofamericabuilding-providence-ri-usa|title=Bank of America Building|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=Emporis.com}}</ref> Due to the what is dubbed the Providence "Renaissance", the city has been the site of [[Recent construction projects in Providence|several construction projects]]. For the most part, the new projects consist of condominium and hotel developments, though two new office buildings are also proposed.<ref>Empire at Broadway and Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island Headquarters are two office buildings currently proposed for the city.</ref>  

Among these developments is [[OneTen|OneTen Westminster]], which is set to rise 520 feet (159 meters). When completed in August 2009 it will become the tallest building in the city, breaking the then 82-year record of the Bank of America Building. OneTen would also become the first building in the city to pass the 500 foot (152 meter) threshold, sometimes given as a criterion for a skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=35782|title=One Ten|accessdate=2007-08-01 |publisher=SkyscraperPage.com}}</ref>  

Other construction projects include [[The Residences at the Westin]] (which reached its full height in February 2007) and the [[Waterplace|Waterplace condominium towers]]. Overall, within 3 years, Providence is expected to have 7 new skyscrapers over 200 feet (60 meters) in height.<ref>OneTen Westminster, The Residences at the Westin, Empire at Broadway, Waterplace 1, Waterplace 2, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island Headquarters, and Intercontinental Hotel Providence are all skyscrapers proposed with heights over 200 feet that are expected to be completed by 2010.</ref>
