"'''Our Song'''" is a [[country music]] song performed by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. The song was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman. It was released on August 22, 2007 by [[Big Machine Records]] as the third [[single (music)|single]] from Swift's eponymous debut album, ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]'' (2006). Swift solely composed "Our Song" for the [[talent show]] of her freshman year in high school, about a boyfriend who she did not have a song with. It was included on ''Taylor Swift'' as she recalled its popularity with her classmates. The uptempo track is musically driven mainly by [[banjo]] and lyrically describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song. 

"Our Song" was met with great appraise from contemporary critics, some who deemed it one of Swift's best singles, and commercial success. The song charted within the top thirty and top twenty on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] and [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], respectively. In the United States, it became Swift's first number one single on the [[Hot Country Songs]] Chart, maintaining the position for six consecutive weeks, and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). A [[music video]] accompanying "Our Song" was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]] and features Swift performing in various settings, including a front porch. The video won both nominations for "Video of the Year" and "Female Video of the Year" at the [[2008 CMT Music Awards]]. Swift has performed the song at an abundance of venues, some while supporting as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed it as part of the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009-2010), her first headlining tour.

==Background==
Swift self-penned "Our Song" for the [[talent show]] of her freshman year in high school with no intentions of including it on her debut album.<ref name="videoaward">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1585582/taylor-swift-shares-story-and-success-of-award-winning-our-song.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Shares Story and Success of Award-Winning "Our Song"|first=Craig|last=Shelburne|date=April 15, 2008|work=''[[CMT News]]''|publisher=[[Viacom]]|accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref> She thought to herself that to be appropriate for the talent show, the song she would write needed to be upbeat and relateable to her classmates.<ref name="theboot">{{cite web|url=http://www.theboot.com/2007/11/05/11-questions-with-taylor-swift-no-2/|title=11 Questions with Taylor Swift: No. 2|work=''The Boot''|page=2|pages=11|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> "I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song.

"Our Song" was met with great appraise from contemporary critics. Sean Dooley of About.com listed "Our Song" as Swift's fifth best song to date. He identified Swift's "uncanny ability, especially at such a young age, to write a compelling narrative" as the song's highlight, referencing the opening lines "I was riding shutgon with my hair undone in the front seat of his car / He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel / The other on my heart."<ref name="topabout" /> Rob Sheffield of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine described the track as gem that hit hard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/new/55348/fearless.html|title=Fearless - Taylor Swift|first=Rob|last=Sheffield|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|publisher=Alpha Media Group|accessdate=February 21, 2010}}</ref> Rick Bell of [[Country Standard Time]] said ''Taylor Swift''{{'}}s best efforts were Swift self-penned song, including "Our Song", which "she sings with stirring conviction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=3371|title=''Taylor Swift'' review|last=Bell|first=Rick|work=''[[Country Standard Time]]''|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref> Jonathan Keefe of [[Slant Magazine]] said the song "follow[s] time-tested narrative conventions and, more often than not, build to massive pop hooks."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/taylor-swift-fearless/1574|first=Jonathan|last=Keefe|date=November 16, 2008|title=Taylor Swift: Fearless|work=''[[Slant Magazine]]''|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> Fiona Chua of [[MTV Asia]] selected the track as a choice cut from Swift's second studio album, ''Fearless''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvasia.com/Review/CD/C20090325001786.html|title=Taylor Swift - Fearless (Asian Version)|first=Fiona|last=Chua|date=March 25, 2009|work=''[[MTV Asia]]''|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref> Kate Kiefer of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine recognized the song to be Swift's "first great hit" and believed it became many couples' song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2009/06/six-great-taylor-swift-songs.html|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|publisher=Paste Media Group LLC|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=April 17, 2010|title=Six Great Taylor Swift Songs|first=Kate|last=Kiefer}}</ref> In 2008, "Our Song" was listed as a "Winning Song" by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=7817964&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID|title=Our Song (Legal Title)|work=''BMI.com''|publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]]|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref>

The accompanying [[music video]] for "Our Song" was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]].<ref name="cmtvideo">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/taylor-swift/177211/our-song.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift - "Our Song"|work=''[[CMT]]''|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref>  While listening to "Our Song", Fanjoy shared her ideals for a music video with Swift. "She had this idea for a front porch performance and the a field of flowers for another performance, then a black-and-white performance shot. It all came together in her head. She was able to translate that so well onto film. It just shows what a truly great director she is", Swift informed [[CMT News]].<ref name="videoaward" /> The video begins with a shot of Swift's toenails as she paints them. Swift, casually wearing a blue tank top, white hot pants, and straightened hair, is revealed to be engaging in a phone conversation in a bedroom. A cut-scene shows Swift affront a restroom mirror, which she writes the word "Love", before furtively approaching a front porch, seen in  a blue dress and curly hair. Swift then sits near the edge and performs "Our Song". The scene transitions to Swift lying on a bed of flowers and wearing an orange evening gown. She holds a card that spells her first name. Then, clothed by a long, black dress, black cowboy boots, and black gloves, Swift sings with a microphone and a backup band behind her in front of a white backdrop. Throughout the remainder of the video, scenes alternate between previous settings and concludes giggling while sitting on the front porch.

The video premiered on September 14, 2007 on [[CMT]].<ref name="cmtvideo" /> The video received a nomination for "Number One Streamed Music Video" at the web-hosted 2008 CMT Online Awards, but lost to [[Carrie Underwood]]'s video for "[[All-American Girl (song)|All-American Girl]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/cmt-online-awards/nominees.jhtml|title=CMT Online Awards 2008: Nominees: Jessica Simpson, Taylor Swift, Kid Rock, Sugarland|work=''CMT Online Awards''|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> At the [[2008 CMT Music Awards]], the video won the CMT Music Award for "Video of the Year" and "Female Video of the Year".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cmt-music-awards/archives/2008.jhtml|title=CMT Music Awards: Archives: 2008 CMT Music Awards|work=''[[CMT Music Awards]]''|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref>
