Andrews began working for [[ESPN]] in May 2004 as a reporter for ''[[ESPN National Hockey Night]]''. She has also reported for the [[College World Series]], [[Little League World Series]], and [[Great Outdoor Games]]. Andrews began serving as a sideline reporter for ''[[ESPN College Football Saturday Primetime]]'' and [[Big Ten]] college basketball games, and in 2005 her job expanded to include ''[[ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime]]'' and [[Major League Baseball]] sideline reporting. From 2008 to 2010, she reported for ESPN<U+2019>s and ABC<U+2019>s live coverage of the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]].<ref name='a' />

In 2010, Andrews appeared on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 10)|tenth season]] of ABC's ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', partnered with [[Maksim Chmerkovskiy]].

On January 13, 2011, it was announced that Andrews signed an endorsement deal with [[Reebok]] to promote its ZigTech brand.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2011/01/andrews_will_pi.html | work=The Boston Globe | title=Andrews will pitch Reebok ZigTech | date=2011-01-13}}</ref> Two weeks prior, as a sideline reporter during the [[2011 Rose Bowl]], Andrews noted that [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian University Horned Frogs]] football players were slipping on the turf because of the new [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes they were wearing. Due to the conflict of interest, ESPN announced revised endorsement guidelines for its journalists that required Andrews to end her endorsement deal with Reebok by the end of 2011.<ref>{{cite news| title=USA Today article|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2011/04/ouch-espns-erin-andrews-to-lose-her-reebok-deal-next-year/1|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2011-04-13}}</ref>

Andrews hosted the first hour of ESPN's ''College GameDay'' on [[ESPNU]], and had been a ''Good Morning America'' correspondent on ABC since 2010, though she had not appeared on the show since covering the Oscars in February 2011.<ref name='b' />  She left ESPN in June 2012.

Andrews is also a contributor on ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]'' and serves as a field  reporter for most major sporting events aired on Fox - such as the [[MLB All-Star Game]], the [[World Series]], the [[NFL Playoffs]], and [[Daytona 500]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/06/espn-erin-andrews-leaving-espn-for-fox/1|title=ESPN: Erin Andrews leaving ESPN for Fox|date=June 29, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2012|work=USA Today}}</ref>

Erin Andrews would also contribute to daily studio show ''Fox Football Daily''.

Andrews' performance has been criticized since she joined Fox Sports' [[Major League Baseball on Fox|MLB coverage]] in 2012. For example,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awfulannouncing.com/2013/november/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-the-2013-mlb-playoffs-on-tv.html |title=THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY OF THE 2013 MLB PLAYOFFS ON TV |last1=Fang |first1=Ken |last2= |first2= |date=3 November 2013 |website=Awful Announcing |publisher= |accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref> Andrews during postseason trophy presentations, has been accused of showing an extreme lack of knowledge by reading off notes. During the trophy presentation at the end of the [[2013 American League Championship Series]], Andrews misidentified former [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] owner and honorary American League president [[Jackie Autry]] as her late husband [[Gene Autry|Gene]].

On February 23, 2014, it was announced that Andrews would replace [[Brooke Burke|Brooke Burke-Charvet]] as the co-host of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' beginning with its 18th season.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20790201,00.html|title = Erin Andrews to Replace Brooke Burke-Charvet on Dancing with the Stars|first = Maggie|date = February 23, 2014|accessdate = February 23, 2014|last = Coughlan|publisher = People}}</ref>

A portion of ticket revenues generated through the program goes to the [[Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors]], a support organization for survivors of deceased military personnel.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisher |first=Eric |url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2011/09/13/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/StubHub.aspx |title=StubHub Signs Erin Andrews To Promote New Girls Night Out Initiative |publisher=SportsBusiness Daily |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref>

==Stalking incident==
In 2008, Michael David Barrett, 46, filmed Andrews in her hotel room through peepholes at the Nashville [[Marriott International|Marriott]] at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and the [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson]] Airport Hotel in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].
