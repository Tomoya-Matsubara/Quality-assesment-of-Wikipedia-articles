'''''Du & jag d<U+00F6>den''''' (Swedish for "You & I Death") is a [[2005]] [[album]] by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] band [[Kent (band)|Kent]]. As the title implies, [[death]] is a major theme of the album which before its release was described by the band as dark and depressing.

The album sold more than 200 000 copies in Scandinavia during the weeks following its March 15 release. Three singles were released from the album: Max 500, [[Palace & Main]] and Den d<U+00F6>da vinkeln.

*The song name "J<U+00E4>rnsp<U+00F6>ken" plays on an expression in [[Sweden|Swedish]], "Hj<U+00E4>rnsp<U+00F6>ken", which means imaginary ghosts, or ghosts in one's [[brain]]. "Hj<U+00E4>rna" is Swedish for "brain", whereas "J<U+00E4>rn" means "iron", but the two words are pronounced the same way.

==Other info==
