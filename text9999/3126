'''Eugenio Mar<U+00ED>a de Hostos Airport''' {{Airport codes|MAZ|TJMZ|MAZ}} is a small public [[airport]] located three miles (5 [[Kilometre|km]]) north of the [[central business district]] (CBD) of [[Mayag<U+00FC>ez, Puerto Rico|Mayag<U+00FC>ez]], [[Puerto Rico]]. The airport, named after the celebrated Mayag<U+00FC>ez native [[Eugenio Maria de Hostos]], covers 172 [[acre]]s and has one [[runway]]. It offers limited commercial service, subsidized by the [[Essential Air Service]] program.

== History ==
Eugenio Mar<U+00ED>a de Hostos Airport used to be the main air gateway to the western region of [[Puerto Rico]], until [[Rafael Hern<U+00E1>ndez Airport]] in [[Aguadilla, Puerto Rico|Aguadilla]] took over that position.

The airport was served heavily by the Puerto Rican national [[Airline|air carrier]], [[Prinair]], during the [[1970s]] and early [[1980s]]. It took the airport three years to get commercial service again once Prinair went bankrupt in [[1984]]. [[American Eagle Airlines|American Eagle]] opened service from [[Luis Mu<U+00F1>oz Mar<U+00ED>n International Airport]] in [[1987]], and [[Eastern Air Lines]], not to be outdone by their rival [[American Airlines|American's]] feeder carrier, soon began services there too, with their own feeder airline, [[Eastern Metro Express]].

Although the airport has always been a turbo-prop aircraft airport, [[Pan Am]] announced, in [[2002]], intentions to install jet flights between Mayag<U+00FC>ez and [[Las Americas International Airport]] in [[Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]], with [[Boeing 727]]s. Those plans never became a reality, but in [[2003]], the airport  gained international status, when [[Fina Air]] picked up the route to Santo Domingo. Fina Air has since gone out of business.

On [[November 8]], [[2004]], American Eagle filed a 90-day notice of intent to the [[United States Department of Transportation|DOT]] to end service to Mayag<U+00FC>ez on [[February 5]], [[2005]] due to poor loads. MAZ is an [[Essential Air Service]] market therefore American Eagle's service was extended by the DOT until the newly selected carrier, [[Cape Air]], began operations. American Eagle ended operations on [[April 30]], [[2005]].

=== Disasters ===
The airport has been involved in various air tragedies over its lifetime:
* A Prinair [[Heron]] aircraft fell while landing there, killing all nine passengers. 
* In [[1989]], an American Eagle aircraft flying to San Juan from Mayag<U+00FC>ez also crashed, killing five passengers.
* [[American Eagle Flight 5401]], which took off from Mayag<U+00FC>ez, crashed at San Juan on [[May 9]], [[2004]], with 17 injured, but with no fatalities.
