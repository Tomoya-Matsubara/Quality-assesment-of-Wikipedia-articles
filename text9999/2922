'''Attarsiya''' was a 15th<U+2013>14th century BCE military leader of [[Achaeans (Homer)#Hittite documents|Ahhiya]].<ref>Spelling often varies based on the specific source, alternative forms include: Attar(a)s(h)iya(s), Attar(a)s(h)ija(s).</ref> In the [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]] archives of circa 1400 BCE, he is described as a "man of Ahhiya", a country identified with the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] and [[Mycenaean Greece]].<ref name=Troy>{{harvnb|Kelder|Uslu|<U+015E>erifo<U+011F>lu|2012|p=57}}.</ref> The campaigns of Attarsiya, as well as his conflict with the Hittite vassal, [[Madduwatta]], represent the first recorded Mycenaean Greek military activity on the [[Anatolia]]n mainland,<ref name=Kelder5>{{harvnb|Kelder|2004<U+2013>2005|pp=154<U+2013>155}}.</ref> as well as the first conflict between Achaeans and Hittites.<ref name=Osprey>{{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=57}}.</ref> He finally withdrew from Anatolia after Hittite intervention, but later launched a campaign against [[Alashiya]] ([[Cyprus]]).

Contemporary Hittite accounts about the campaigns of Attarsiya and the Ahhiya in general may indicate that there was a possible Mycenaean empire centered on late [[Helladic period|Bronze Age Greece]].<ref name=Popko>{{harvnb|Popko|2008|pp=121<U+2013>122}}.</ref> Moreover, Attarsiya might be a possible Hittite reconstruction of the Greek name [[Atreus]], a king of [[Mycenae]] according to [[Greek mythology]].

==Background==
[[File:14 century BC Eastern.png|thumbnail|300px|Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East during the time of Attarsiya (Mycenaean Greece in purple, Arzawa in light green).]]
The activities of Attarsiya are recorded in the Hittite archives, in particular in the ''Indictment of Madduwata''.<ref name=Osprey/> He is described as a "man of [[Achaeans (Homer)#Hittite documents|Ahhiya]]", which was a typical Hittite way to refer to an enemy king. This makes Attarsiya the first known Achaean leader,<ref name=Popko/> but his exact authority inside the Achaean world remains unclear. The Hittite descriptions seem to agree that he was a local Achaean ruler in western Anatolia, rather than a [[High king]] of all the Achaeans.<ref>{{harvnb|Bryce|1999|p=140}}.</ref>

Moreover, the chronology of the correspondent Hittite texts was initially estimated at the end of 13th century BCE. However, more recent research, based on a number of archaic features the specific texts feature, place it together with the events described circa two centuries earlier (end of 15th-beginning of 14th century BCE).<ref name=Sweeney>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2009|pp=101<U+2013>102}}.</ref>

On the other hand, no relevant information is found in the contemporary Greek [[Linear B]] records. The latter, dealing only with administrative issues of the Mycenaean palaces, are of limited value concerning the political developments of the late Bronze Age era.<ref>{{harvnb|Kelder|2005|p=135}}.</ref> Moreover, although the title of the Mycenaean kings, the [[wanax]], has been read several times in the Linear B texts, no correspondent personal names have been found.<ref>{{harvnb|Kelder|2005|p=136}}.</ref>

==Military campaigns==
===Anatolia===
The Hittite archives of circa 1400 BCE, during the reign of [[Arnuwanda I]], describe the military campaign of Attarsiya in southwest Anatolia,<ref name=Jorrit>{{harvnb|Kelder|2005|pp=139<U+2013>140}}.</ref> probably in the region of [[Lycia]].<ref name=Popko/> He probably used the city of [[Milet]], in west coast Anatolia, which was already under Achaean influence, as a military base.<ref name=Kelder5/> Attarsiya launched a campaign deploying an army that included 100 [[war chariots]] and attacked regions which were Hittite vassals, or at least under a certain decree of Hittite influence.<ref name=Popko/> Among them, he attacked the Hittite vassal, [[Madduwatta]], likely a prince of the kingdom of [[Arzawa]], and managed to expel him from his country.<ref name=Jorrit/> The latter found refuge in the court of the Hittite ruler and was installed by him as a vassal in Zipasla, somewhere in western Anatolia. However, Attarsiyas attacked the region and the Hittite vassal was again unable to provide any opposition.<ref name=Jorrit/> The Achaean expedition in Anatolia is associated with increased Mycenaean findings in Milet during this period (early 14th century BCE), indicating that a number of Greek people moved from mainland Greece to this region.<ref>{{harvnb|Kelder|2004<U+2013>2005|pp=152<U+2013>153}}.</ref>

As a result of Achaean military activity in the region, the Hittites dispatched an army under [[Kisnapili|Kisnapli]]. The ''Indictment of Madduwatta'' gives a brief description of the battle:<ref name=Kelder5/>
[[Image:Eberzahnhelm Heraklion.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Boar's tusk helmets were typical of Mycenaean warfare. The campaigns of Attarsiya in Anatolia must have had a certain impact on the local population, since a depiction of a soldier wearing such a helmet was found in the Hittite capital, Hattusa.]]
{{cquote|Kisnapli went into battle against Attarsiya 100 [chariots and&nbsp;... infantry] of Attarsiya [drew up]. And they fought. One officer of Attarsiya was killed, and one officer of ours, Zidanza, was killed. Then Attasiya&nbsp;... to Madduwatta, and he went off to his own land. }}
The way the conflict is described, by counting only two casualties, may point that there was a duel between the nobles of the two sides. However, it is also possible that the dead among the common soldiers were not considered important to mention.<ref name=Kelder5/> Although the outcome of the battle remained unresolved, Attarsiya decided to withdraw his troops from the battlefield.<ref name=Kelder5/> After his retreat from the Anatolian mainland, Madduwatta was again installed as a Hittite vassal in the region.<ref name=Kelder5/> 

===Alashiya===
Later, Attarsiya, still posing a threat to the Hittites, invaded the island of [[Alashiya]] ([[Cyprus]]) together with a number of his Anatolian allies, including his former enemy Madduwatta.<ref name=Popko/> This worried the Hittites since they considered the island one of their dependencies.<ref name=Jorrit/> The campaign was launched while the [[Lukka lands|Lukka people]] of southern Anatolia provided the necessary naval support. The invading force finally succeeded to control Alashiya and overthrow the local Hittite authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Bryce|1999|p=146-147}}.</ref> The Mycenaean presence in Cyprus is also associated with archaeological evidence, since Mycenaean Greek settlements dating from that time were unearthed there.<ref name=Popko/>

==Legacy==
The campaigns of Attarsiya represent the earliest recorded Mycenaean Greek military activity on the [[Anatolia]]n mainland,<ref name=Kelder5/> as well as the first conflict between Achaeans and Hittites.<ref name=Osprey/> It appears that these military developments had a certain impact on the local populations. In this context, a decorated shard of pottery from the Hittite capital, [[Hattusa]], depicts a warrior in with body armor and [[boar's tusk helmet]], typical of Achaean warfare, while the Hittite king offers a Mycenaean type thrusting sword to the Storm God, [[Teshub]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kelder|Uslu|<U+015E>erifo<U+011F>lu|2012|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Wiener|2007|pp=10<U+2013>11}}.</ref> 

Despite the withdrawal of Attarsiya after the Hittite intervention, the following decades (circa 1380-1320 BCE) were a period of Mycenaean expansion on the Anatolian coast.<ref>{{harvnb|Wiener|2007|pp=10<U+2013>11}}.</ref> Achaean military activity in the region continues to be attested through several Hittite records until circa 1250 BCE.<ref name=Osprey/>

===Link with mythical Atreus===
It has been suggested by several scholars that the term ''Attarsiya'' might be a possible Hittite reconstruction of the Greek name ''[[Atreus]]'', a mythical king of [[Mycenae]] and father of [[Agamemnon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strauss|2007|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Bryce|1999|p=402}}.</ref> However, other scholars argue that even though the name is probably Greek, since he is described as an Ahhiya and connected to Atreus, the person carrying the name is not necessarily identical to the famous Atreus of Greek mythology.<ref>{{harvnb|West|2001|pp=262<U+2013>266}}; West suggests that ''Atreus'' is a secondary form based on the [[patronymic]] ''Atre<U+00EF>d<U+0113>s'', which is in turn derived from the Mycenaean *''Atrehi<U+0101>s''.</ref> According to an alternative view presented by Hittitologist [[Albrecht Goetze]], ''Attarsiya'' might possibly be a possessive adjective, meaning "belonging to Atreus" (Atreides), which was a typical [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] term to refer to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and [[Menelaus]], throughout the ''[[Iliad]]''.<ref name=Sweeney/>

==Possibility of a Mycenaean empire==
It has been established in modern scholarship that the Hittite term ''Ahhiya'' (or ''Ahhiyawa'' in latter texts) refers to Mycenaean
Greek territory and its inhabitants, the Achaeans, one of the names that [[Homer]] used to refer to the [[Greeks]] in the ''[[Iliad]]''.<ref name=Troy/> Historically important about the Achaeans in the time of Attarsiya is that they undertook an expedition to Anatolia, as well as Cyprus. The latter expedition indicates that the Achaean leader commanded a significant fleet and that the Achaeans were a sea power.<ref name=Popko/>

According to the Hittite inscriptions, it appears that the Ahhiya were a powerful empire, at the same scale as contemporary [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Middle Assyrian period#Middle Assyrian Empire 1392-1056 BC|Assyria]] and the Hittite Empire.<ref name=Popko/> Moreover, based on the fact that Attarsiya launched a military campaign in Anatolia and fielded one hundred chariots, in addition to infantry, Dutch researcher Jorrit Kelder suggested that Ahhiya must have had the military capacity of at least three times the size of the Mycenaean kingdom of [[Pylos]], based on the information recorded on the [[Linear B]] tablets unearthed from the specific [[Palace of Nestor|palace]]. Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckman|Bryce|Cline|2012|p=5}}.</ref>
