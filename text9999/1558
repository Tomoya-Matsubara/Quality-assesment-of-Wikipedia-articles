==Production==
===Development===
[[Ryan Coogler]] was a graduate student at the [[University of Southern California]] School of Cinematic Arts when Grant was shot on January 1, 2009. Following this event, Coogler expressed his desire to make a film about Grant's last day, "I wanted the audience to get to know this guy, to get attached, so that when the situation that happens to him happens, it<U+2019>s not just like you read it in the paper, you know what I mean? When you know somebody as a human being, you know that life means something." He was able to meet [[John Burris]], the attorney for the Grant family, through a mutual friend and worked closely with him to get information on the case.  He also worked closely with the Grant family, after gaining their trust.<ref name="NYT1">{{cite news|last=Rhodes|first=Joe|title=A Bay Area killing inspires Fruitvale Station|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/movies/a-bay-area-killing-inspires-fruitvale-station.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0| work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 19, 2013|date=June 28, 2013}}</ref>  

In January 2011, [[Forest Whitaker]]'s production company was looking for new young filmmakers to mentor. Coogler met Head of Production, Nina Yang Bongiovi, and showed her his projects. Shortly after, he had a meeting with Whitaker, who decided to support ''Fruitvale''.<ref name="scriptlab">{{cite web|last=Alloway|first=Meredith|title=Fruitvale Station: Interview Ryan Coogler|url=http://thescriptlab.com/all-the-way-with-alloway/2327-fruitvale-station-interview-ryan-coogler-|work=The Script Lab|accessdate=July 19, 2013|date=July 9, 2013}}</ref><ref name="prod notes">{{cite web|title=Fruitvale Station - Production Notes|url=http://www.twcpublicity.com/downloads/production/fruitvale_station_production_notes.pdf|publisher=twcpublicity.com|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref> Coogler met with advisers of Sundance Screenwriters Lab.

===Filming===
''Fruitvale Station'' was filmed in [[Oakland, California]],<ref name="NYT1"/> in 20 days in July 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title='Fruitvale Station' Gets Big Applause at Cannes|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/100748361|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=July 19, 2013|date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> Scenes were shot at and around the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] platform where Grant was killed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Local actors have roles in <U+2018>Fruitvale Station<U+2019>|url=http://www.dailyrepublic.com/news/entertainment-local/local-actors-have-roles-in-fruitvale-station/|work=Daily Republic|accessdate=July 19, 2013|author=Amy Maginnis-Honey|date=July 12, 2013}}</ref>  The BART agreed to let the crew film at the Fruitvale BART station for three four-hour nights.

The film includes actual amateur footage of the shooting. Coogler explained the decision: "That was something that I was initially very firmly against. I didn<U+2019>t want any real footage in the film. But you sometimes have to take a step back. Being from the Bay Area, I knew that footage like the back of my hand, but more people from around the world had no idea about this story. It made sense for them to see that footage and see what happened to Oscar, and I think it was a responsibility that we had to put that out there."<ref name="ew behind"/>

===Music===
The musical score to ''Fruitvale Station'' was composed by [[Ludwig G<U+00F6>ransson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ludwig G<U+00F6>ransson to Score <U+2018>Fruitvale<U+2019>|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2012/08/10/ludwig-goransson-to-score-fruitvale/|work=Film Music Reporter|accessdate=October 26, 2013|date=August 10, 2012}}</ref> Also a USC graduate, G<U+00F6>ransson said of the scoring process: "Ryan and I talked a lot about how sound design was going to have a huge role in the movie and very early on I got sent the actual sound recordings of the Bart Train. I manipulated the train sound and made it almost feel like a dark ambient synth sound and I used it almost throughout the whole Bart platform scene. The other element in the score is lots of layered and manipulated guitars sounding almost like haunting pads." Coogler added: "One thing that we always wanted to be conscious of with the score, was to make sure that it always felt organic. A lot of the film would play without score, so Ludwig made sure that whenever we brought score in came out of sounds in the environment."<ref name="soundtrack">{{cite web|title=Fruitvale Station Soundtrack with Composer Ludwig Goransson|url=http://soundworkscollection.com/news/fruitvale-station-soundtrack-with-composer-ludwig-goransson|work=SoundWorks Collection|accessdate=September 15, 2013|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref> A soundtrack album, ''Fruitvale Station <U+2013> Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'', was be released digitally on September 24, 2013 and on CD October 15, 2013 through [[Lakeshore Records]].<ref name="soundtrack"/>

Some people questioned having a poster for the film in Fruitvale Station, but a BART spokeswoman said about this decision: 
<blockquote>"there was no debate whether to allow ''Fruitvale Station'' [advertisements] on BART. None whatsoever. We really support Ryan. He's just an amazing person. . . .

Jordan."<ref>{{cite web|title=Fruitvale Station (2013)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fruitvale_station/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixter]]|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 85, based on 43 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fruitvale-station|title=Fruitvale Station|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}</ref> [[CinemaScore]] reported that audiences gave an "A" average grade.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Amy|title='Fruitvale' starts strong, may benefit from Zimmerman acquittal|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-fruitvale-station-box-office-zimmerman-acquittal-20130714,0,3507189.story|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 26, 2013|date=July 14, 2013}}</ref> [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it "a compelling debut" and "a powerful dramatic feature film". He also praised the lead performances stating, "As Oscar, Jordan at moments gives off vibes of a very young [[Denzel Washington]] in the way he combines gentleness and toughness; he effortlessly draws the viewer in toward him. Diaz is vibrant as his patient and loyal girlfriend, while Spencer brings her gravitas to the proceedings as his stalwart mother."<ref>{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Fruitvale: Sundance Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/fruitvale/review/414010|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=January 31, 2013|date=January 20, 2013}}</ref>

Actor [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] has praised the film as the "best film" of Sundance Film Festival 2013.<ref>@hitRECordJoe Twitter status. "[https://twitter.com/hitRECordJoe/status/355810036288724992 I said it at @SundanceFest and I'll say it again: FRUITVALE STATION should win Best Picture next year. It opens today, go see it..]" Twitter. Posted July 12, 2013. Retrieved July 15, 2013.</ref>

In writing for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', chief film critic Stephanie Zacharek called it "a restrained but forceful picture that captures some of the texture and detail of one human life" and praised first-time director [[Ryan Coogler]], writing that he "dramatizes Oscar's last day by choosing ''not'' to dramatize it: The events unfold casually, without any particular scheme. And yet because we know how this story will end, there's a shivery, understated tension running beneath."<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-07-10/film/fruitvale-station/ "A Shivery, Understated Tension Runs Through ''Fruitvale Station''"], ''[[The Village Voice]]'', July 20, 2013. Retrieved on July 12, 2013.</ref>

In his Sundance festival wrap up, critic [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said of ''Fruitvale Station'', "Made with assurance and quiet emotion, this unexpectedly devastating drama based on the real life 2009 shooting of an unarmed young black man at an Oakland Fruitvale Station of BART (San Francisco Bay Area Transit Fruitvale Station) impressed everyone as the work of an exceptional filmmaker." <ref>{{cite web|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=The Sundance Film Festival Proves again to be a mixed bag...|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-et-mn-sundance-kenny-20130128,0,3082363.story|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=January 31, 2013|date=January 28, 2013}}</ref>

In a more mixed review, Geoff Berkshire of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "a well-intentioned attempt to put a human face on the tragic headlines surrounding Oscar Grant." Though he praised Michael B. Jordan's performance, he critiqued the "relentlessly positive portrayal" of the film's subject: "Best viewed as an ode to victim's rights, ''Fruitvale'' forgoes nuanced drama for heart-tugging, head-shaking and rabble-rousing."<ref name="Variety"/>

In his negative ''[[New York Post]]'' review and subsequent [[Fact checker]] article in ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Kyle Smith]] concluded that Coogler omits key information, while fabricating other scenes, in order to manipulate viewers into a distorted impression of what happened.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kyle|title='Fruitvale Station' tells some, omits some|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/sour_squishy_fruitvale_IKOntZsaTW6FqgMGLxvIJO?utm_medium=rss&utm_content=Movies|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=|date=July 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kyle|title='Fruitvale Station' Is Loose With The Facts In An Effort To Elicit Sympathy For Oscar Grant|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/kylesmith/2013/07/25/fruitvale-station-is-loose-with-the-facts-in-an-effort-to-elicit-sympathy-for-oscar-grant/|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=|date=July 25, 2013}}</ref>
