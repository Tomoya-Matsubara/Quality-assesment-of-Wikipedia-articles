[[File:Flag of Jihad.svg|thumb|The "[[black flag of jihad]]" as used by jihadist militants since ca. the late 1990s.]]

'''Jihadism''' (also '''jihadist movement''' or '''jihadi movement''') is a controversial{{sfn|Brachman|2008|p=4|ps=: "Jihadism is a clumsy and controversial term."}} term to describe the renewed focus on armed [[jihad]] in [[Islamic fundamentalism]].

Jihadism emerged in the 1960s, with roots in the late 19th and early 20th century ideological developments of [[Islamic revival]]ism, developed into [[Qutbism]] and related ideologies during the mid 20th century. The rise of jihadism was re-enforced by the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979, and has been propagated in various [[ongoing conflicts|armed conflicts]] throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A specifically [[Salafist jihadism]] has been diagnosed within the modern [[Salafi]] movement by [[Gilles Kepel]] in the mid-1990s. 

"Jihadism" in this sense covers both [[Mujahideen]] guerilla warfare and [[Islamic terrorism]] with an [[international terrorism|international scope]] as it arose from the 1980s, since the 1990s substantially represented by the [[al-Qaeda]] network. Jihadism with an international, [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamist]] scope in this sense is also known as '''Global Jihadism'''. Generally the term jihadism denotes [[Sunni]] Islamist armed struggle. [[Shi'a-Sunni relations|Shiite and Sunni mutual sectarian tensions]] led to numerous forms of Sunni (Salafist and other Islamist) jihadism against [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Muslims and Shia mosques.

==Terminology==
{{wiktionary|jihadism}}
Although the adjective ''jihadist'' can be traced to the 1960s, and the abstract ''jihadism'' to ca. 1980, these terms did not see frequent use in popular media until after the [[9/11 attack]]s of 2001. The equivalent terms of "jihadist movement" and "jihadi movement" date to the same period, entering use during the 1970s. The term "jihadism" translates or parallels Arabic ''jih<U+0101>diyya'' {{lang|ar|<U+062C><U+0647><U+0627><U+062F><U+064A><U+0629>}}. The alternative form ''jihadi'' for ''jihadist'' in English usage is a transliteration of the corresponding Arabic adjective ''jih<U+0101>d<U+012B>'' {{lang|ar|<U+062C><U+0647><U+0627><U+062F><U+064A>}}.

According to [[Martin Kramer]] the term jihadism first became common in "the Indian and Pakistani media". "At present, jihadism is used to refer to the most violent persons and movements in contemporary Islam, including [[al-Qaeda]]." The term ''jihadism'' may also have been influenced by the term "[[Salafism jihadism|jihadist-Salafism]]", put into "academic circulation" by "French academics".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.meforum.org/541/coming-to-terms-fundamentalists-or-islamists |title=Coming to Terms: Fundamentalists or Islamists? |author=Martin Kramer |journal=[[Middle East Quarterly]] |date=Spring 2003 |volume=X |issue=2 |pages=65<U+2013>77}}</ref>


The term "Jihadist Globalism" is also often used in relation to Jihadism. Jihadist Globalism is said to be a response to the western modes of modernization that are believed to have worsened poverty, political instability and secular tendencies in the Muslim society. Jihadist globalism is not only a response to market globalism but also a rebuttal for domestic groups who have imposed their views on the Muslim people. Many people refer to acts of terrorism including September 11th and the 2005 London Bombings as a demonstration of jihadist globalism. However, according to Professor Manfred Steger of RMIT University, the term "Jihadist Globalism" can apply to all extremely violent strains of religiously influenced ideologies that articulate the global imaginary into concrete political agendas and terrorist strategies. The term does not have to be specific to the muslim society. Thus, the label could also apply to violent Christians in the West that strive to make a Christian Empire. <ref>Steger, Manfred B.

==Jihad fi sabilillah==
[[File:Flag of Majlis.png|thumb|A [[Black Standard|black flag]] reportedly used by [[Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya|Caucasian jihadists]] in 2002 displays the phrase ''al-jihad [[fi sabilillah]]'' above the [[takbir]] and two crossed [[saif|swords]].]]
In Islam, the phrase '''''al-jihad [[fi sabilillah]]''''' is the equivalent of the western notion of ''[[bellum justum]]'' or just war.<ref>
Rudolph Peters, ''Jihad in modern terms: a reader'' 2005, p. 120.</ref>
Such a "just war" or "war in the cause of Allah" has been propagated in modern [[fundamentalism]] beginning in the late 19th century, 
an ideology that arose in context of struggles against colonial powers in North Africa in the late 19th century, as in the [[Mahdist War]] in Sudan, 
and notably in the mid-20th century by [[Islamic revival]]ist authors such as [[Sayyid Qutb]] and [[Abul Ala Maududi]].<ref>
Rudolph Peters, ''Jihad in modern terms: a reader'' 2005, p. 107 and note p. 197.
John Ralph Willis, "Jihad Fi Sabil Allah", in: ''In the path of Allah: the passion of al-Hajj <U+02BB>Umar : an essay into the nature of charisma in Islam'', Routledge, 1989, ISBN 978-0-7146-3252-0, 29-57. "Gibb [''Mohammedanism'', 2nd ed. 1953] rightly could conclude that one effect of the renewed emphasis in the nineteenth century on the Qur'an and Sunna in Muslim fundamentalism was to restore to jihad fi sabilillah much of the prominence it held in the early days of Islam. Yet Gibb, for all his perception, did not consider jihad within the context of its alliance to ascetic and revivalist sentiments, nor from the perspectives which left it open to diverse interpretations." (p. 31)</ref>

Based on this, the phrase is used in modern jihadism. Thus, "Fi Sabilillah" [[armband]]s were worn by [[Xinjiang War (1937)|rebels in Xinjiang]] when battling Soviet forces,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA134&dq=ma+hu-shan#v=onepage&q=sabil%20&f=falsefalse|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911-1949|author=Andrew D.

Forbes|year=1986|publisher=CUP Archive|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-25514-7|page=144|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> and the phrase has been spotted on flags used by [[Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya|jihadists in Caucasia]] in the 2000s.

When jihadism is specifically motivated by [[Pan-Islamism]], i.e. the ultimate aim of spreading Islam worldwide under a restored [[Caliphate]], it is often called "Global Jihadism". But jihadism can also be motivated regionally, in an attempt to establish an Islamic state in a specific homeland. 
Global Jihadism is usually involved with international [[Islamic terrorism]], while regional jihadism takes the form of [[guerrilla warfare]], possibly also paired with terrorist attacks.
