'''Fu Style Baguazhang''' is a style of [[baguazhang]], a [[chinese martial art]].

==History==
Baguazhang was introduced to southern [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]] by [[Fu Chen Sung]], who was invited south after becoming chief instructor of the Nanjing Central Martial Arts Institute in the 1920s. 

He and the other four who went south were collectively referred to as the Five Northern Tigers. 

This style is characterized by a large number of spinning movements and point strikes. This fighting style can also be used to damage internal organs with precise striking methods.
