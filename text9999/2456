The '''Marriage Charter of Empress Theophanu''' (State Archives of [[Wolfenb<U+00FC>ttel]], 6 Urk 11) is the [[dower]] document for the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] princess [[Theophanu]]. Written in Latin, the document was created in the [[Early Middle Ages]] after the marriage of Theophanu to [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] in 972, which made her the [[List_of_Holy_Roman_Empresses#Ottonian_Dynasty|Holy Roman Empress]]. The document was prepared by Otto II and exemplifies an instance of political and cultural contact between the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the Byzantine Empire. It serves as an example of [[Ottonian Renaissance]] art, and the [[calligraphy]] of the manuscript has led it to be regarded as one of the most beautiful [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] documents of the Middle Ages.

==Historical context==
After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the sole successor of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Charlemagne]]'s [[coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|imperial coronation]] put strain on the Byzantine Empire in [[Constantinople]].{{sfn|Althoff|2005|p=126}} When [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] became emperor in February 962, there was an issue between him and the Byzantine Empire, and this issue revived in 967 between Otto I and [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] over the dominion of Italy. On 25 December 967, [[Pope John XIII]] appointed [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] as Otto I's co-ruler.{{sfn|Althoff|2005|p=126}}

In autumn 968, battles between the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire commenced in the [[Principality of Capua]], in the [[Duchy of Benevento]] and [[Apulia]], which continued until 970. Both sides of the conflict made many attempts to find a diplomatic solution. Otto I intended to receive recognition of his title in [[Byzantium]], and to clarify the borders of southern Italy.{{sfn|Wolf|Fussbroich|1991|pp=59&ndash;78}}{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=19}} He wanted this agreement to be ratified by the marriage of his son, Otto II, to a member of the Byzantine imperial family. [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Anna]], daughter of the deceased Emperor [[Romanos II]], was considered a possible bride. However, Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] was unwilling to marry off a [[porphyrogennetos|purple-born princess]] (i.e. a child born to a reigning emperor).{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=19}} After tough negotiations with Nikephoros II Phokas' successor [[John I Tzimiskes]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]] [[Gero (archbishop of Cologne)|Gero]] secured the marriage of Otto II with [[Theophanu]],{{sfn|Wolf|Fussbroich|1991|pp=59&ndash;78}} a member of the Byzantine imperial family who was not purple-born.{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=19}}

The Marriage Charter acts as the reference document for the wedding of the 17-year-old Otto II and the 12-year-old Theophanu. The wedding took place on 14 April 972 in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and was officiated by Pope John XIII.{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=19}} Politically, the marriage marked the recognition of the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] Empire by the Byzantine Empire. In this document, Otto II granted Theophanu the right to an extensive [[dower]] for personal use throughout her life (''legitima dos''),{{sfn|Ennen|1999|p=63}} as well as her entry into a ''[[consortium imperii]]'' with Otto II, meaning that both would share imperial authority over the Holy Roman Empire.{{sfn|Ennen|1999|p=63}}{{sfn|Ostrogorski|1996|p=339}}

It is likely that Theophanu kept the document until October 989 when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is believed she placed it in [[Gandersheim Abbey]] to preserve the document.{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=76}} It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld.{{sfn|McKitterick|Quinault|1997}} [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] was among the first to recognise the historical significance of this document, and reports on it in ''History of [[House of Welf|Welf]]''.{{sfn|Leibniz|1711|loc=Welf and Lower Saxony}} After the [[German mediatization|secularisation]] of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, the document was transferred to the [[G<U+00F6>ttingen State and University Library]].{{sfn|Goetting|1973|p=65}} On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of [[Brunswick]]. In 1835, the document was transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenb<U+00FC>ttel, where it remains.{{sfn|Goetting|1973|p=65}}

==Features==
This document outlines the revenue and profits that Theophanu would receive from this marriage, and it begins with a speech similar to sermons held at weddings.{{sfn|Ennen|1999|p=63}} The document describes what Theophanu will receive from Otto II: rights to the revenues from [[Istria]], [[Pescara]], [[Walcheren]], [[Wichelen]], and farms in [[Boppard]], [[Tiel]], [[Herford]], [[Kyffhaeuser]], and [[Nordhausen]].{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=32}}{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=89}}<!--full detail on p32, summary on p89-->

==Description==
The document is a {{convert|144.5|by|39.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[scroll]] consisting of three pieces of parchment glued together and rolled,{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=24}} and is believed to have been created in the [[Fulda monastery]].{{sfn|UNESCO|2005|p=36}}{{sfn|Brandt|Eggebrecht|1993|pp=62&ndash;65}} A scientific study of the purple parchment took place in Munich in 1966, which showed that [[minium (mineral)|minum]] and [[Rubia tinctorum|madder]] were used for staining the document, indicating that it was created in the Holy Roman Empire, rather than in the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>cher|2006}}{{sfn|UNESCO|2005|p=36}} This document is also one of the first examples of madder being used in the Middle Ages.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>cher|2006}}{{sfn|Goetting|K<U+00FC>hn|1968|pp=11&ndash;24}} The purple background was made from Byzantine silk, and has 14 circular medallions and two half medallions. The medallions contain representations of animals fighting, which are inspired by [[Near East]]ern and Byzantine art.{{sfn|Deeters|Matthes|1972|p=41}}

The writing field is surrounded by a narrow gold trim decorated with blue and white [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves.{{sfn|UNESCO|2005|p=36}} The top edge is decorated with animals and vegetation, along with medallions containing half-figures, such as Jesus flanked by Mary and John the Baptist with four Evangelists. Between the medallions at the top are six pairs of animals.{{sfn|UNESCO|2005|p=36}}{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=27}} It was the first marriage document to be [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]].{{sfn|Zajic|Roland|2005|pp=331&ndash;432}}<!--mainly p393 to p395-->

The text is written in gold in [[Carolingian minuscule]] calligraphy, and the gold ink was obtained from an alloy of silver and gold leaf.{{sfn|von Euw|Schreiner|Sporbeck|1991|pp=337&ndash;339}} A few lines or words stand out as they are written in [[rustic capitals]].{{sfn|Goetting|K<U+00FC>hn|1968|pp=5&ndash;6}}{{sfn|Schulze|2007|pp=28&ndash;29}} Over time, the parchment has slightly warped, and there is a fold in the middle of the document. It is presented in a permanent exhibition of the State Archives of Lower Saxony in a dimly lit room.{{sfn|UNESCO|2005|p=36}}{{sfn|Goetting|K<U+00FC>hn|1968|pp=11&ndash;27}}

==Originality==
The originality of this document remains a matter of debate.{{sfn|Brandt|Eggebrecht|1993|pp=62&ndash;65}} Hans K. Schulze and Hans Goetting believe that the document was presented by Otto II at their wedding feast, and then given to Theophanu.{{sfn|Schulze|2007|p=39}} Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that the document was intended to be read.{{sfn|Deeters|Matthes|1972|pp=9&ndash;10}} Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Br<U+00FC>hl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks a seal and the lines are unusually shaped.{{sfn|Sickel|1887|pp=110&ndash;111}}

==Recognition==
In the Holy Roman and Byzantine empires, [[imperial purple]] was a colour reserved for emperors, kings and bishops, and purple parchment was rarely used for writing.{{sfn|Lacroix|1849}} This document is regarded as one of the most luxurious and beautiful examples of the use of purple parchment.{{sfn|Deeters|Matthes|1972|p=32}} In 2005, the document was proposed for inclusion in the [[Memory of the World Programme#Memory of the World Register|Memory of the World Register]], but was not included.<ref name="inclusion1">{{cite web|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://deposit.ddb.de/ep/netpub/28/34/66/972663428/_data_dync/_stand_Dezember_2006/0704/mow-nominierung.htm&title=%C2%AB%C2%A0Deutsche%20Nominierungen%20f%C3%BCr%20das%20UNESCO-Programm%20Memory%20of%20the%20World%20(Nominations%20allemandes%20pour%20le%20programme%20de%20l%27UNESCO%20M%C3%A9moire%20du%20Monde)%C2%A0%C2%BB|title=Deutsche Nominierungen f<U+00FC>r das UNESCO-Programm Memory of the World|publisher=UNESCO Germany|date=July 2004|accessdate=23 November 2014}} (archive)</ref>
