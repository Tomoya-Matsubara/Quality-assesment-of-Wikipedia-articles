==History==
===Early years and ''Birthing the Giant'' (2004<U+2013>2006)<span id="Early years and Birthing the Giant"></span>===
Cancer Bats originated in May 2004 with singer [[Liam Cormier]] and guitarist [[Scott Middleton]], former member of Toronto [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[At the Mercy of Inspiration]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/178.htm |title=Alternative Press interview |publisher=Altpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like [[Refused]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Down (band)|Down]], among others. The lineup was rounded out with the addition of [[Andrew McCracken]] on bass and [[Joel Bath]] on drums. The four-piece wasted no time writing and recording songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005.

The story is that the band considered the names ''Cancer Bats'' and ''Pneumonia Hawk'' after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/mikedavies/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20080527 |title=BBC Radio 1 punk show 27th of May 2008 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern [[Ontario]], playing live shows with bands like [[Billy Talent]], [[Every Time I Die]], [[NORA (band)|Nora]], [[Alexisonfire]], [[Haste the Day]], [[It Dies Today]], [[Bane (band)|Bane]], [[Comeback Kid]], [[Buried Inside]], [[Attack in Black]], [[Misery Signals]], [[This Is Hell (band)|This Is Hell]], [[Rise Against]], [[The Bronx (band)|The Bronx]] and [[Gallows (band)|Gallows]].

On June 2, 2006, the band took part in a short interview and then played a free CD release show at The Edge 102.1 ([[CFNY-FM]]) and then on June 6 ''[[Birthing the Giant]]'' was released into major record stores. The album includes guest vocals by [[George Pettit]] of [[Alexisonfire]]. On June 7, 2006 they hosted [[All Things Rock]], a show on MTV Canada, and had their own video played at the end of the show.<ref>[http://www.mtv.ca/?id=1533623 MTV overdrive page] showing performance.</ref>

===Lineup changes and ''Hail Destroyer'' (2007<U+2013>2008)<span id="Lineup changes/Hail Destroyer"></span>===
Bass player [[Andrew McCracken]] left to concentrate on his design company [http://www.doublenaut.com Doublenaut]. His spot was filled in by [[Jason Bailey]] (former member of bands [[Figure Four]] and [[Shattered Realm]]) for most of 2007 after which he was replaced by [[Jaye R. Schwarzer]], who is formerly of '''Left Behind''', '''Hope to Die''', '''Minesweeper''', '''Kover''', and currently a '''Reefer Cathedral''' member alongside Cancer Bats guitarist Scott Middleton.

[[File:LiamCormier.JPG|thumb|right|Cormier performing at a Cancer Bats show in Barcelona in June 2008.]]
The band released their second studio album called ''[[Hail Destroyer]]'' on April 22, 2008. The album features guest vocals by [[Wade MacNeil]] of [[Alexisonfire]] and [[Black Lungs]], [[Tim McIlrath]] of [[Rise Against]] and [[Ben Kowalewicz]] of [[Billy Talent]]. The release was held at the Mod Club in downtown Toronto with [[Liam Cormier]] not only singing for Cancer Bats, but also performing drums for [[Black Lungs]]. On May 17, 2008, Cancer Bats were put on the cover of ''[[Kerrang!]]'', a publication which gave their album ''Hail Destroyer'' a KKKKK review (highest possible) as well as a 5k Live review on their headlining UK tour. Cancer Bats were also nominated for 2008 Album of the Year for the 2008 Kerrang! awards.

Cancer Bats have performed at the [[Download Festival]] in 2007, [[Groezrock]] 2007 and at both [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in 2007 and 2008. In the summer of 2008, the band did an extensive summer and autumn tour with [[Bullet for My Valentine]], [[Black Tide]] and [[Bleeding Through]], as part of the [[No Fear]] music tour across North America. Also in 2008, they were a support act for Welsh band [[Funeral for a Friend]] during their tour of Britain and northern Europe.

===Touring and ''Bears, Mayors, Scraps & Bones'' (2009<U+2013>2011)<span id="Bears, Mayors, Scraps & Bones"></span>===
In March 2009, they went on tour at the annual [[Taste of Chaos]] festival along with [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]], [[Four Year Strong]], [[Pierce the Veil]] and [[Bring Me the Horizon]], keeping a daily blog on their website. At about this time Cancer Bats were also featured in Bring Me the Horizon's video for "[[Chelsea Smile]]", in which they appear in the "Kitchen Scene" of the video playing cards. Also in March, Liam Cormier lent his vocals to sing on fellow Canadian band [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]]'s fourth studio album ''[[A Shipwreck in the Sand]]'' on the track "[[Vices (Silverstein song)|Vices]]".<ref name="AlterThePress">{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Sean |url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2009/03/interview-cancer-bats-3032009.html |title=Interview: Cancer Bats - 3/03/2009 |publisher=Alter the Press! |date=March 3, 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref>

Cancer Bats returned to the UK in 2009, after Swedish melodic metal band [[In Flames]] cancelled their April 2009 concerts, on which Cancer Bats were slated to be main support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kerrang.com/2009/02/in_flames_cancel_upcoming_uk_t.html |title=In Flames cancel upcoming UK/Ireland tour |publisher=Kerrang! |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=2011-12-07}}</ref> The band is also featured on [[Gallows (band)|Gallows]]' latest album ''[[Grey Britain]]'' on May 2.<ref name="AlterThePress"/> In August 1, Cancer Bats played a slot at the premier showing of the Sonisphere festival and at the inaugural [[Hevy Music Festival]]. Also in 2009, Cancer Bats appeared in an episode of the documentary series ''[[City Sonic]]'', reflecting on their time at the Adrift Clubhouse. In October and November, the band supported [[Billy Talent]] on their UK and European tour. During the tour they performed several new songs from their third album, including "Darkness"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDPUIgSxyRY |title=New song: Darkness |publisher=Youtube.com |date=November 21, 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> and "Scared to Death".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHbJOJ8iBSo |title=New song: Scared to Death |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref>

The band's influence steered away from the "traditional hardcore record" and took a wide variety of influences from rock bands including [[Fleet Foxes]]. Liam Cormier when asked about his influences stated: "In a lot of ways we get really inspired by non-metal bands. For me, I find I really like looking at other things because I just don't want to make a traditional hardcore record lyrically. So for me, I listen to a lot of indie rock and I've been getting super psyched on a lot of that, like the new 'Helplessness Blues' by Fleet Foxes".<ref name= "NME 3">{{cite web|url= http://www.nme.com/news/cancer-bats/60717|title= Cancer Bats: 'Fleet Foxes have inspired our new album'|author= |publisher= [[New Musical Express]]|date= December 1, 2011|accessdate= January 4, 2012}}</ref>
