He claimed to be the prophetic fulfilment of [[B<U+00E1>bism]], a 19th-century outgrowth of [[Shia Islam|Sh<U+00ED><U+2018>ism]], but in a broader sense claimed to be a [[Manifestation of God|messenger from God]] referring to the fulfilment of the [[eschatology|eschatological]] expectations of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and other major religions.<ref name="buck_eschatologic">{{Harvnb|Buck|2004|pp=143<U+2013>178}}</ref>

Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h taught that humanity is one single race and that the age has come for its unification in a global society. His claim to divine revelation resulted in [[Persecution of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s|persecution]] and imprisonment by the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities, and his eventual 24-year confinement in the prison city of [[Acre, Israel|`Akka]], [[Palestine]] (present day [[Israel]]), where he died.  He authored many religious works, most notably the ''[[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas]]'' and the ''[[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-<U+00CD>q<U+00E1>n]]''.

There are two known [[#Photographs and imagery|photographs]] of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h.  Outside of pilgrimage, Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s prefer not to view his photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes.

{{Main|Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's family}}
Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was born on 12 November 1817, in [[Tehran]], the capital of [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]], present-day Iran. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> authors state that his ancestry can be traced back to [[Abraham]] through Abraham's wife [[Keturah]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=130-131}}</ref> to [[Zoroaster]] and to [[Yazdgerd III|Yazdigird III]], the last king of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid Empire]],<ref>{{harvnb|Balyuzi|1985|pp=309<U+2013>312}}</ref> and also to [[Jesse]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|pp=9<U+2013>12}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=94}}</ref> His mother was Khad<U+00ED>jih Kh<U+00E1>num and his father was [[M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> `Abb<U+00E1>s N<U+00FA>r<U+00ED>|M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Buzurg]].  Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's father, M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Buzurg, served as [[vizier]] to Im<U+00E1>m-Virdi M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1>, the twelfth son of [[Fat<U+2032>h Ali Shah Qajar]]. M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Buzurg was later appointed governor of [[Borujerd|Burujird]] and [[Lorestan]],<ref name="Balyuzi11">{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|pp=11}}</ref> a position that he was stripped of during a government purge when [[Mohammad Shah Qajar|Muhammad Shah]] came to power. After the death of his father, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was asked to take a government post by the new vizier [[Haji Mirza Aqasi]], but declined.<ref name="cole_bahabio">{{Cite web| title = A Brief Biography of Baha'u'llah | last = Cole| first = Juan| accessdate=2006-06-22 | url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahabio.htm }}</ref>

Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was married three times. He married his first wife [[<U+00C1>s<U+00ED>yih Kh<U+00E1>num]], the daughter of a nobleman, in Tehran in 1835, when he was 18 and she was 15.<ref name="marriages">{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|2000|pp=20<U+2013>22}}</ref> She was given the title of ''The Most Exalted Leaf'' and ''Navv<U+00E1>b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1976|p=13}}</ref> His second marriage was to his widowed cousin F<U+00E1>timih Kh<U+00E1>num, in Tehran in 1849 when she was 21 and he was 32.<ref name="marriages"/> She was known as ''Mahd-i-`Uly<U+00E1>''.

Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h declared <U+00C1>s<U+00ED>yih Kh<U+00E1>num his "perpetual consort in all the worlds of God", and her son [[`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>]] as his vicar.<ref>{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=108}}</ref> He had [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's family|14 children]], four daughters and ten sons, five of whom he outlived.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Baha'-allah | first = Juan | last = Cole}}</ref> Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s regard <U+00C1>s<U+00ED>yih Kh<U+00E1>num and her children [[M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Mihd<U+00ED>]], [[Bah<U+00ED>yyih Kh<U+00E1>num]] and `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>' to be the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> holy family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|2000|p=22}}</ref>

==B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> movement==
{{Main|B<U+00E1>bism}}
In 1844, a 25 year-old man from [[Shiraz]], {{transl|Bahai|Siyyid M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> `Al<U+00ED>-Mu<U+1E25>ammad}}, who took the title of the [[B<U+00E1>b]], claimed to be the promised [[Mahdi]] of Islam.<ref name="iranica_bab">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=B<U+0101>b, Sayyed `Ali Mohammad Sirazi | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin}}</ref> The movement quickly spread across the [[Persian Empire]] and received widespread opposition from the Islamic clergy.<ref name="iranica_bab" /> The B<U+00E1>b himself was executed in 1850 by a firing squad in the public square of Tabriz at the age of 30 and the community was almost entirely exterminated in 1852<U+2013>3.<ref name="iranica_bab" />

While the B<U+00E1>b claimed a station of revelation, he also claimed no finality for his revelation.<ref name="browne339">{{Harvnb|Browne|1889|p=339}}</ref> In most of his prominent writings, the B<U+00E1>b alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as "[[Him whom God shall make manifest]]". According to the B<U+00E1>b, this personage, promised in the sacred writings of previous religions would establish the kingdom of God on the Earth;<ref name="iranica_bab" /><ref name="farah">{{Harvnb|Farah|1970|pp=242<U+2013>249}}</ref> several of the B<U+00E1>b's writings state the coming of ''Him Whom God shall make manifest'' would be imminent.<ref name="Saiedi344"/> In the books written by the B<U+00E1>b he constantly entreats his believers to follow ''Him whom God shall make manifest'' when he arrives.<ref name="browne339" /> The B<U+00E1>b also eliminated the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his movement, and stated that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until ''Him whom God shall make manifest'' would appear.<ref name="Saiedi344">{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|p=344}}</ref>

===Acceptance of the B<U+00E1>b===
Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h first heard of the [[B<U+00E1>b]] when he was 27, and received a visitor sent by the [[B<U+00E1>b]], [[Mull<U+00E1> Husayn]], telling him of the B<U+00E1>b and his claims. Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h accepted the B<U+00E1>b's claims, becoming a B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> and helping to spread the new movement, especially in his native province of [[Noor, Iran|N<U+00FA>r]], where he became recognized as one of its most influential believers.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /><ref name="Balyuzi35">{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|pp=35<U+2013>37}}</ref> His notability as a local gave him many openings, and his trips to teach the religion were met with success, even among some of the religious class.  He also helped to protect fellow believers, such as [[T<U+00E1>hirih]], for which he was temporarily imprisoned in [[Tehran]] and punished with [[bastinado]] or foot whipping.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, in the summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], where 81 prominent B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the B<U+00E1>b's message began a new dispensation, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. It is at this conference that Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h took on the name Bah<U+00E1>.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" />

When violence started between the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s and the Qajar government in the later part of 1848, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h tried to reach the besieged B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s at the [[Battle of Fort Tabarsi|Shaykh Tabarsi]] in [[Mazandaran]], but was arrested and imprisoned before he could get there.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> The following years until 1850 saw the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s being massacred in various provinces after the B<U+00E1>b made his claim of being [[Manifestation of God]] more public.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" />

===S<U+00ED>y<U+00E1>h-Ch<U+00E1>l===
After the B<U+00E1>b was executed in 1850, a group of Tehran B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s, headed by a B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> known as Azim, who was previously a [[Shaykhism|Shaykhi]] cleric, plotted an assassination plan against the Shah [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]], in retaliation for the B<U+00E1>b's execution.<ref name="Smith14">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=14<U+2013>15}}</ref> The policy was opposed by Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, and he condemned the plan, however, any moderating influence that he may have had was diminished since in June 1851 he went into exile to [[Baghdad]] at the chief minister's request, only returning after [[Amir Kabir|Amir Kabir's]] fall from power.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /><ref name="Smith14"/> On 15 August 1852, the radical group of B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s attempted to cary out the assassination of the Shah and failed.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> The group of B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s linked with the plan, were rounded up and killed, and, notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> community was blamed, precipitating [[pogrom|violent riots]] against the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> community by the government.<ref name="Smith14"/> During this time many B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s were killed, and many of the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s who were not killed, including Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, were imprisoned in the [[S<U+00ED>y<U+00E1>h-Ch<U+00E1>l]] (black pit), an underground dungeon of Tehran.<ref name="eor">{{cite encyclopedia| last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed.

According to Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, it was during his imprisonment in the S<U+00ED>y<U+00E1>h-Ch<U+00E1>l that he had several mystical experiences, and that he received a vision of a [[Maid of Heaven|maiden from God]], through whom he received his mission as a messenger of God and as the one whose coming the B<U+00E1>b had prophesied.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /><ref name="eor" /> After four months in the S<U+00ED>y<U+00E1>h-Ch<U+00E1>l, owing to the insistent demands of the ambassador of Russia, and after the person who tried to kill the Shah confessed and exonerated the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> leaders, the authorities released him from prison, but the government exiled him from Iran.  Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, instead of accepting the offer of refuge from Russia, chose to go to Iraq in the [[Ottoman Empire]]; in 1853 Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h and his family travelled from [[Persian Empire|Persia]] arriving in [[Baghdad]] on 8 April 1853.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /><ref name="Smith16">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=16}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=109}}</ref>

==Baghdad==
[[File:Bahaullah-passport.jpg|thumb|right|Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's passport, dated January 1853]]

The B<U+00E1>b eliminated the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his movement, and had stated that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until Him Whom God shall make manifest would appear.<ref name="Saiedi344"/> He did, however, appoint M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Yahy<U+00E1> (later known as [[Subh-i-Azal]]) as a nominal leader after himself.  M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Yahy<U+00E1> had gone into hiding after the assassination attempt on the Shah, and after Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's exile to Baghdad, he chose to join his brother there.<ref name="Smith16"/> At the same time, an increasing number of B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s considered Baghdad the new center for leadership of the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> religion, and a flow of [[pilgrim]]s started coming there from Persia.

M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Yahy<U+00E1>'s leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the B<U+00E1>b.<ref name="cole_bahabio"/><ref name="iranica_azali">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Azali Babism | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin}}</ref><ref name = "Barrett p. 246">{{Harvnb|Barrett|2001|p=246}}</ref> M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Yahy<U+00E1> gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s who started to give their alliance to other claimants.<ref name="iranica_azali"/> During the time that M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Yahy<U+00E1> remained in hiding, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h performed much of the daily administration of the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> affairs.<ref name="cole_bahabio"/> In contrast to M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Yahy<U+00E1>, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.<ref name="Smith17">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=17}}</ref>

This was increasingly resented by M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Yahy<U+00E1>, who began trying to discredit Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h,<ref name="Smith17"/> which resulted in driving many people away from the religion.<ref name="cole_bahabio" /> Tensions in the community mounted, and thus in 1854 Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h decided to leave the city to pursue a solitary life.<ref name="Smith17"/>

===Kurdistan===
On 10 April 1854, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h left his family to the care of his brother Mirza Musa and traveled with one companion to the mountains of [[Kurdistan]], northeast of Baghdad, near the city of [[Sulaymaniyah]].<ref name="cole_bahabio"/><ref name="Smith17"/> He later wrote that he left so as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> community, and that his "withdrawal contemplated no return".<ref name="Smith17"/><ref name="Iqan160">{{Harvnb|Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h|2003|p=160}}</ref>

For two years, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan.<ref name="eor" /> He originally lived as a [[hermit]], dressed like a [[dervish]] and using the name ''Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani''.<ref name="Smith17"/><ref name="Balyuzi116">{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|p=116}}</ref> At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders.<ref name="cole_bahabio" /> As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthm<U+00E1>n, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahm<U+00E1>n, and Shaykh Ism<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>l, leaders of the [[Naqshbandi|Naqshband<U+00ED>yyih]], [[Qadiriyyah|Q<U+00E1>dir<U+00ED>yyih]], and Kh<U+00E1>lid<U+00ED>yyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice.<ref name="Balyuzi118">{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|p=118}}</ref> It was to the second of these that the ''[[Four Valleys (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)|Four Valleys]]'' was written. Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h wrote several other notable books during this time.<ref name="eor" />

In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public leadership by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray.<ref name="cole_bahabio" /> Some Babis, including Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's family, began searching for Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, and when news of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's family begged him to come back to Baghdad.<ref name="cole_bahabio" /> On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.<ref name="Smith17"/>

===Return to Baghdad===
[[File:Map iran ottoman empire banishment.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's banishments]]
When Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h returned to Baghdad he saw that the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> community had become disheartened and divided.<ref name="Smith17"/> During Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's absence, it had become alienated from the religion because Mirza Yahya had continued his policy of militancy and been unable to provide effective leadership.<ref name="Smith17"/> Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the B<U+00E1>b against the B<U+00E1>b's clear instructions;<ref name="cole_bahabio" /> dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the [[Shah]];<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1987|p=60}}</ref> and instigated violence against prominent B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s who had challenged his leadership.<ref name="Smith17"/>

After his return to Baghdad, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h tried to revive the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> community, mostly through correspondence, writing extensively to give the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s a new understanding of the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> religion,<ref name="Smith17"/> while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the B<U+00E1>b and a [[Manifestation of God]] hidden. He was soon recognized by the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s, as well as government authorities, as the foremost B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> leader, and there was a growing number of people joining the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> movement.<ref name="Smith17"/>  He also gained sympathy from government officials and [[Sunni]] clerics.<ref name="Smith17"/> Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> community, gained the attention of his enemies in [[Islamic]] clergy and the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian government]].<ref name="britannica">{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1988 | title = The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Book of the Year | publisher = Encyclopaedia Britannica | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-85229-486-7}}</ref>  The Persian government asked the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] to extradite Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h from the sensitive border region to [[Constantinople]].<ref name="Smith17"/>

===Declaration in the Garden of Ridvan===
On 21 April 1863, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h left Baghdad and entered the Najibiyyih gardens, now known to Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s as the [[Garden of Ridv<U+00E1>n, Baghdad|Garden of Ridv<U+00E1>n]], near Baghdad.

==Imprisonment==
Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was given an order to relocate to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from [[Baghdad]] was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually to the penal colony of Akk<U+00E1>, Palestine (now [[Acre, Israel]]).

===Constantinople===
Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h travelled from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, accompanied by a large group including family members and followers.  During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he was treated as a government guest.<ref name="Smith23"/>  Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear.  The reason may have been political because Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was viewed as a person of influence. However, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h refused to work with the Ottoman authorities.<ref name="Smith23"/>  After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for [[Adrianople]]. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.<ref name="Smith23"/>

===Adrianople===

In 1867, Mirza Yahya challenged Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h to a test of the divine will in a local [[mosque]] in Adrianople,<ref name="PSmith24"/> such that "God would strike down the impostor."

===Writings and letters to the leaders of the world===
[[File:House-Bahaullah-Edirne.jpg|thumb|The house where Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h stayed in [[Edirne|Adrianople]]]]
During his time in Adrianople, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the proclamation of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s to be united and detached from the world.<ref name="PSmith25">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=24<U+2013>25}}</ref>  He also started to write about distinctive Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> beliefs and practices.

Also, while in Adrianople, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h proclaimed the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]] further by addressing [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]] to the kings and rulers of the world asking them to accept his revelation, renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour toward the betterment of the world and its peoples. His first letter was sent to Sultan [[Abd<U+00FC>laziz]] of the Ottoman Empire and his ministers, which was followed by the [[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#S<U+00FA>riy-i-Mul<U+00FA>k (Tablet of the Kings)|Tablet of the Kings]] which was a general address to all rulers.<ref name="PSmith25"/>  In that latter letter the rulers of the earth were asked to listen to Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's call, and cast away their material possessions, and since they were given the reins of government that they should rule with [[justice]] and protect the rights of the downtrodden.  He also told the rulers to reduce their [[armaments]] and reconcile their differences.<ref name="PSmith25"/>  The Christian monarchs were also asked to be faithful to Jesus' call to follow the promised "Spirit of Truth."<ref name="PSmith25"/>

Later when Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was in Akka, he continued writing letters to the leaders of the world including:<ref name="PSmith28">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=28<U+2013>29}}</ref>

[[File:AkkaPrison.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Prison in Akk<U+00E1> in which Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was imprisoned]]
With the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> community now irrevocably divided, the followers of Mirza Yahya tried to discredit Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of causing agitation against the government.<ref name="PSmith26">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=26}}</ref> While an investigation cleared Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, it did bring to the attention of the government that Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h and Mirza Yahya were propagating religious claims, and, fearing that this might cause future disorder, they decided to again exile the 'B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>' leaders.<ref name="PSmith26"/> A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire&nbsp;<U+2014> [[Famagusta]], [[Cyprus]] for Mirza Yahya and his followers, and [[Acre, Israel|`Akk<U+00E1>]], in Ottoman [[Palestine]], for Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h and his followers.<ref name="PSmith26"/>

The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, including Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after a journey by land and sea through [[Gallipoli]] and [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]], arrived in [[Akko|`Akk<U+00E1>]] on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city.<ref name="PSmith26"/>  The inhabitants of `Akk<U+00E1> were told that the new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden.  The first years in `Akk<U+00E1> imposed very harsh conditions with everyone becoming sick, and eventually three Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s dying.<ref name="PSmith26"/>  It was also a very trying time for Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h: [[Mirz<U+00E1> Mihd<U+00ED>]], Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's son, was suddenly killed at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and [[meditation]]. After some time, the people and officials began to trust and respect Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, and thus the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, he was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h lived in the house of [[Mazra'a|Mazra'ih]].<ref name="PSmith26"/>

==Final years==

[[File:Bahai gardens in Acre.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The shrine near [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h is buried]]
The final years of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's life (1879<U+2013>1892) were spent in the [[Mansion of Bahj<U+00ED>]], just outside `Akk<U+00E1>, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During his years in `Akk<U+00E1> and Bahj<U+00ED>, since [[`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>]], his eldest son, had taken care of the organizational work, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was able to devote his time to writing, and he produced many volumes of work including the [[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas]], his book of laws.<ref name="Smith27">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=27<U+2013>28}}</ref> His other works included letters outlining his vision for a united world, as well as the need for ethical action; he also composed many [[Prayer in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|prayers]].<ref name="Smith27"/>

In 1890, the [[Cambridge]] [[Orientalism|orientalist]] [[Edward Granville Browne]] had an interview with Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h in this house. After this meeting he wrote his famous pen-portrait of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h:

:"In the corner where the divan met the wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt head-dress of the kind called t<U+00E1>j by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied an age which the jet-black hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!"<ref name="Smith27"/><ref>[[Edward Granville Browne]] in the introduction to {{Cite web| title=A Traveller's Narrative | publisher=Cambridge | year=1891 | url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/tn/tnfrnt.htm | accessdate=2006-06-22 }}, p.XXXIX-XL.</ref>

On 9 May 1892, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h contracted a slight fever which grew steadily over the following days, abated, and then finally took his life on 29 May 1892. He was buried in the [[Shrine of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h|shrine]] located next to the Mansion of Bahj<U+00ED>.<ref>{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|p=328}}</ref>

==Claims==
Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h stated that he was a messenger of God, and he used the term [[Manifestation of God]] to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God.<ref name="manifestation">{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages = 1<U+2013>38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}</ref> In the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.<ref name="manifestation"/><ref name="smith109">{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=109}}</ref> The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations.<ref name="manifestation"/><ref name="smith107">{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=107}}</ref>  Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.<ref name="manifestation"/>

In Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's writings he writes in many styles including cases were he speaks as if he was instructed by God to bring a message; in other cases he writes as though he is speaking as God directly.<ref name="bne41">{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980|p=41}}</ref> In his writings, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's style changes frequently, where in some cases he is speaking as the messenger of God, and then it changes to as if he were speaking as God.<ref name="bne45">{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980|p=45}}</ref>

While Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h did not himself directly claim to be either the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] messiah, he did so in principle through his writings.<ref name="buck_eschatologic"/>  Later, `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> stated that Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was the [[Kalki avatar]], who in the classical Hindu [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavas]] tradition is the tenth and final [[Avatar]] (great incarnation) of [[Vishnu]] who will come to end [[Kali Yuga|The Age of Darkness and Destruction]].<ref name="buck_eschatologic"/> Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s also believe that Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h is the fulfilment of the prophecy of appearance of the [[Maitreya]] Buddha, who is a future Buddha who will eventually appear on earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure Dharma.<ref name="momenbook">{{Harvnb|Momen|1995|pp=50<U+2013>52}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Fozdar|1976}}</ref> Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s believe that the prophecy that Maitreya  will usher in a new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's teachings on world peace.<ref name="momenbook" /> Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h is believed to be a descendant of a long line of kings in Persia through [[Yazdgerd III]], the last monarch of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanian Dynasty]];<ref name=autogenerated1 /> he also asserted to be a descendant of [[Abraham]] through his third wife [[Keturah]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sears|2002}}</ref>

The conflict was not long lived; after being alienated by the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with only a handful of followers.

[[File:Bahaullah from miller.jpg|thumb|150px|Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h. Persian inscription reads ''M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> <U+1E24>usayn-`Al<U+00ED> N<U+00FA>r<U+00ED>'']]
There are two known photographs of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h.  This photo was taken for passport purposes while he was in [[Adrianople]] (present day [[Edirne]]) and is reproduced in [[William McElwee Miller|William Miller]]'s book on the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith.  Copies of both pictures are at the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World Centre]], and one is on display in the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World Centre buildings#International Archives|International Archives]] building, where the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s view it as part of an organized [[pilgrimage]].  Outside of this experience Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s prefer not to view this photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes,<ref name="opi">{{Cite web| url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_photographs_bahaullah_miller | title = Letter from the Office of Public Information regarding the photograph of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h | author = Office of Public Information | accessdate = 2008-12-20}}</ref> and Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> institutions have requested the press not to publish the image in the media.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.bahai.us/system/files/PublicationPhotosV8.pdf | title = Publication of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Photos | accessdate = 2008-12-20 |  publisher = bahai.us | author = United States Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Office of Communications}}</ref>

Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's image is not, itself, offensive to Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s.  However, Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s are expected to treat the image of any [[Manifestation of God]] with extreme reverence. According to this practice, they avoid depictions  [[Depiction of Jesus|of Jesus]] or [[depictions of Muhammad|of Muhammad]], and refrain from portraying any of them in [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[drama]]. For example, copies of the photographs are displayed on highly significant occasions, such as six conferences held in October 1967 commemorating the centenary of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's writing of the ''[[Suriy-i-Mul<U+00FA>k]]'' (Tablet to the Kings), which [[Shoghi Effendi]] describes as "the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h".<ref>{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=171}}</ref>  After a meeting in Adrianople, the [[Hands of the Cause]] travelled to the conferences, 'each bearing the precious trust of a photograph of the Blessed Beauty, which it will be the privilege of those attending the Conferences to view.'<ref>{{Harvnb|Universal House of Justice|1996|p=105}}</ref>

The official Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> position on displaying the photograph of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h is:

:"There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes."
::(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, 6 December 1939)<ref>{{Harvnb|Hornby|1983|p=540}}</ref>

While the above passage clarifies that it is considered disrespectful to display his photograph to the public, regarding postings on other websites the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World Centre]] has written:

:"For Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, the photograph of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h is very precious and it should not only be viewed but also handled with due reverence and respect, which is not the case here [on a non-Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> web site]. Thus, it is indeed disturbing to Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s to have the image of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h treated in such a disrespectful way. However, as the creator of the site is not a Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>, there is little, if anything, that can be done to address this matter. We hope these comments have been of assistance."
