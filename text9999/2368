The '''Convoy de la victoria''' (English: "Victory's convoy") is the name given by the [[Nationalist Spain|Spanish Nationalist]]s to a naval battle which took place on 5 August 1936 in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] between the escort of a Nationalist convoy and the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] destroyer [[Churruca class destroyer|''Alcal<U+00E1> Galiano'']].

==Background==
As of end of July 1936, the Spanish rebel forces were in dire straits. The Republic held two thirds of the country, the capital city, the gold reserves, the major urban centers and most of the industries. Furthermore, the main shock force of the rebels, the [[Spanish Army of Africa]] was isolated in the Spanish Morocco, the Republic held most of the Navy and from July 19 the [[Spanish Republican Navy]] warships were patrolling the waters between Morocco and the mainland. Nevertheless, with the assistance of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Fascist Italy]], the Nationalists managed to airlift their troops from Africa to [[Andalusia]].<ref>Graham, Helen. (2005). ''The Spanish Civil War. A very short introduction,.'' Oxford University Press.p.24</ref>

===The airlift of troops===
The Nationalists requested and received transport aircraft from Germany and Italy in order to transport their troops, establishing the first airlift of troops of history. Germany sent 20 [[Junkers Ju-52]] and between July 29 and August 5 the Nationalists carried 1,500 men of the Spanish Army of Africa across the Strait by air, and another 15,000 between August 5 and August 15<ref name="Preston Paul 2006 p.119">Preston Paul. (2006). ''The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, Revolution & Revenge.'' Harper Perennial. p.119</ref> (according to historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], 12,000 men were flown between August and September). Hitler said that: "Franco ought to erect a monument to the glory of the Junkers-52".<ref name="Thomas, Hugh 2001 p.357">Thomas, Hugh. (2001). ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. p.357.</ref> This success was a major psychological blow (the news of the arrival of the Moors, spread terror among the Republicans),<ref name="Thomas, Hugh 2001 p.357"/> but the Republican Navy still controlled the Straits and the Republican battleship ''[[Spanish battleship Jaime I|Jaime I]]'' threatened the transport aircraft with her heavy anti-aircraft fire.<ref>Jackson, Gabriel. (1967). The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1936-1939. Princeton University Press. Princeton. p. 249</ref>

==Convoy de la Victoria==
On August 5, Franco decided to break the Republican naval blockade, with a convoy of merchant ships, carrying 2,500<ref>Beevor, Antony. (2006). ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939.'' Penguin Books. London. p.73</ref> to 3,000 soldiers,<ref>Preston, Paul. ''Franco.'' Harper Collins. London. 1994. p. 162</ref> equipment and heavy weapons. The convoy departed from [[Ceuta]] and was made up of four transports escorted by the gunboat ''Dato'', the coastguard ship ''Uad Kert'' (WWI [[armed trawler]], ex-HMT ''Rother'') and the old T-1 class torpedo boat ''T-19''. The convoy was covered by five Savoia [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81|Sm.81 bombers]], 3 trimotors [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker]], one [[DC-2]], 2 [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 52|Nieuport]] fighters, 2 [[Dornier Do J|hydroplanes]] and a squadron of [[Breguet XIX]].<ref>Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. pp.357-358</ref> 

Three Republican destroyers were keeping a close watch on [[Spanish Morocco]] ports, but in the morning of 5 August the Nationalist aircraft launched air attacks against the Republican vessels in the Strait and the Republican destroyer ''[[Spanish destroyer Lepanto|Lepanto]]'' was forced to leave Gibraltar by the British authorities.<ref>Preston, Paul. ''Franco.'' Harper Collins. London. 1994. p. 161.</ref> Because of this, only the ''Alcal<U+00E1> Galiano'' engaged the Nationalist ships. The convoy, bound for [[Algeciras]], successfully reached its destination on the evening after a brief exchange of fire. While mooring in Algeciras, the gunboat ''Dato'' straddled [[Great Britain|British]] destroyer [[HMS Basilisk (H11)|HMS ''Basilisk'']] after misidentifying her as Republican.<ref>Moreno de Albor<U+00E1>n y de Reyna, Fernando: ''La guerra silenciosa y silenciada: Historia de la campa<U+00F1>a naval durante la guerra de 1936-39''.

==Aftermath==
From August 6 transport ships crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, with the cover of the Italian bombers.<ref name="Preston Paul 2006 p.119"/> On August 7, the ''Jaime I'' and the cruiser ''[[Almirante Cervera class cruiser |Libertad]]'' shelled Algeciras and severely damaged the ''Dato'' and the ''Uad Kert'', but on the first week of August a German Junkers Ju 52 struck the Republican battleship ''Jaime I'' and Italian bombers started to harass the Republican fleet so that they could not longer prevent the passage of transport ships. Furthermore, the Republican warships were inefficiently handled by her crews and two German cruisers,<ref>Deutschland class cruiser</ref> ''[[German cruiser Deutschland|Deutschland]]'' and ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' patrolled the Strait. In addition, the English authorities in Gibraltar and [[Tangier]] were hostile to Republic. The British oil companies at Gibraltar, refused to sell fuel to the Republican navy. The Tangier International Commission denied the use of the harbor to the Republican Navy, because was contrary to the city's neutrality, nevertheless authorized the passage of food, goods and gasoline for the German transport planes to the Spanish Morocco.<ref>Jackson, Gabriel.
