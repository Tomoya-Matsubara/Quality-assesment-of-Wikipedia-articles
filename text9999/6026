'''USS ''Marchand'' (DE-249)''' was an {{sclass|Edsall|destroyer escort}} built for the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She served in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] the [[Pacific Ocean]] and provided destroyer escort protection against [[submarine]] and air attack for Navy vessels and [[convoy]]s. 

She was named in honor of Fireman First Class [[Roy Joseph Marchand]], born in [[Crandall, Mississippi]], 17 September 1920, for his courageous actions during a Japanese attack on his ship. Marchand was posthumously awarded the [[Silver Star]] for his courageous dedication to duty.

''Marchand (DF 249'') was laid down by [[Brown Shipbuilding]] Co., [[Houston, Texas]], 30 December 1942; launched 30 March 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Charles D. Marchand, mother of ''Fireman First Class Marchand''; and commissioned 8 September 1943, Lt. Comdr. G. F. Lynch, [[USCG]], in command.

==World War II North Atlantic operations==
 
''Marchand'' departed Houston, Texas, 14 September for [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] training off [[Bermuda]] until 31 October when she arrived at the [[Charleston Navy Yard]]. After [[antisubmarine]] warfare exercises while based at [[Quonset Point, Rhode Island]], in November, she arrived at [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], the 20th. After service as target ship for training operations of Torpedo Squadron 13, the escort ship sailed for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], arriving 12 December.
 
As the flagship of Escort Division 20, ''Marchand'' departed Norfolk 14 December escorting a convoy to Europe, and arrived in the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] 2 January 1944 to turn over the convoy to British warships. She then set course for [[Morocco]], arriving [[Casablanca]] 7 January. The ship got underway the next day for the east coast, arriving [[New York]] 24 January.

==Collision at sea==
 
''Marchand'' conducted exercises in [[Block Island Sound]] and [[Casco Bay]], [[Maine]], until departure from New York 22 February with convoy CU 15 for [[Ireland]]. About 2200 on 25 February, during a heavy gale, {{SS|El Coston}} rammed {{SS| Murfreesboro}}. As ''Marchand'' came to the assistance of the badly damaged and burning merchant ships, ''El Coston'''s bow rammed ''Marchand'' on her [[starboard]] side [[amidships]] damaging the plates of her forward control room. ''Marchand'' then stood by and received 28 survivors while {{USS|Ricketts|DE-254}} took on board 33 others. The next day ''Marchand'' steamed for Bermuda as escort for El Coston. Shortly after midnight the 27th the remaining 56 crew members of ''El Coston'' had to abandon ship. After the merchant ship sank at 0142, ''Marchand'' directed her course for New York, where the survivors were debarked 1 March.
 
On 6 April ''Marchand'' again sailed in convoy from New York for [[Northern Ireland]], arriving [[Lisahally]] 17 April. She returned to New York 3 May. From 21 May 1944 to 11 June 1945, she made nine more round trips escorting convoys from New York or [[Boston, Massachusetts]], to [[United Kingdom]] ports.

==Transferred to the Pacific Fleet==
 
''Marchand'' departed New York 19 June for training in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], then to [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]], before sailing for the South Pacific. She arrived [[Pearl Harbor]] 26 July. With the Japanese surrender 15 August, she cleared Pearl Harbor 12 days later for maneuvers off [[Eniwetok]] and [[Kwajalein]] Atolls, [[Marshall Islands|Marshalls]], from 3 September to 15 October. She continued on to [[Guadalcanal]], arriving the 18th, before returning to Pearl Harbor 10 November by way of [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Phoenix Islands]], where she debarked her [[U.S. Coast Guard]] passengers.

==Post-War decommissioning==
 
On 17 November the escort ship steamed for home, arriving [[San Diego, California]], 6 days later to debark more men of the Coast Guard. On the 25th ''Marchand'' headed for the east coast, via the [[Panama Canal]], reaching New York 11 December. She then got underway 21 January 1946 for [[Green Cove Springs, Florida]], arriving the 23d for inactivation. On 25 April 1947 she decommissioned and entered the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] at Green Cove Springs. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 2 January 1971 and sold for scrapping 30 January 1974.
