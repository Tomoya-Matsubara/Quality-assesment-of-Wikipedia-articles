'''''Othnielosaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[ornithischia]]n [[dinosaur]] that lived about 155&nbsp;to 148&nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Late Jurassic]]-age [[Morrison Formation]] of the western [[United States]]. It is named in honor of famed [[paleontologist]] [[O.C. Marsh|Othniel Charles Marsh]], and was formerly assigned to the genus ''[[Laosaurus]]''.  This genus was coined to hold fossils formerly included in ''[[Othnielia]]'', which is based on remains that may be too sparse to hold a name; as such, it is part of decades of research to untangle the taxonomy left behind by Marsh and his rival [[Edward Drinker Cope]] from the [[Bone Wars]].  ''Othnielosaurus'' has usually been classified as a [[hypsilophodont]], a type of generalized small [[bipedalism|bipedal]] [[herbivore]] or [[omnivore]], although recent research has called this and the existence of a distinct group of hypsilophodonts into question. 

==Description==
''Othnielosaurus'' is known from material from all parts of the body, including two good skeletons, although the skull is still poorly known (note that earlier references use a multitude of names for this material, with most of them since 1977 using ''Othnielia rex'').<ref name=NSWC04>{{cite book |last=Norman |first=David B. |authorlink=David B.

''Othnielosaurus'' (previously under the names ''Laosaurus'', ''Nanosaurus'', and ''Othnielia'') has typically been regarded as a hypsilophodont [[ornithopod]], a member of a nebulous and poorly defined group of small, running herbivorous dinosaurs.<ref name=SN90>{{cite book |last=Sues |first=Hans-Dieter |coauthors=and Norman, David B. |editor= Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm<U+00F3>lska, Halszka (eds.)|title=The Dinosauria |edition=1st |year=1990 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-06727-4 |pages=498<U+2013>509 |chapter=Hypsilophodontidae, ''Tenontosaurus'', Dryosauridae}}</ref><ref name=NSWC04/><ref name=PMG06/> This was challenged in 1990 by [[Robert T.

==History and taxonomy==
[[Image:Marsh laosaurus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Othniel Charles Marsh]]'s 1896 skeletal restoration of "[[Laosaurus]]" ''consors'' (now ''Othnielosaurus'').]]
O.C. Marsh named several species and genera in the late 1800s that have come to be recognized as hypsilophodonts or hypsilophodont-like animals, including ''[[Nanosaurus|Nanosaurus agilis]]'' (possibly), "[[Othnielia|N." ''rex]]'', ''[[Laosaurus|Laosaurus celer]]'', ''L. consors'', and ''L. gracilis''. This [[taxonomy]] has become very complicated, with numerous attempts at revision in the years since.

In 1877, Marsh named two species of ''Nanosaurus'' in separate publications, based on partial remains from the Morrison Formation of [[Garden Park, Colorado|Garden Park]], [[Colorado]]. One paper described ''[[Nanosaurus|N. agilis]]'', based on [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]] 1913, with remains including impressions of a [[dentary]], and [[postcrania]]l bits including an [[ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[femur|thigh bones]], [[tibia|shin bones]], and a [[fibula]].<ref name=OCM77a>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |authorlink=Othniel Charles Marsh |year=1877 |title=Notice of some new vertebrate fossils |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |volume=14 |pages=249-256}}</ref> The other paper named ''[[Othnielia|N. rex]]'', a second species which Marsh based on YPM 1915 (also called 1925 in Galton, 2006), a complete thigh bone.<ref name=OCM77b>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |authorlink=Othniel Charles Marsh |year=1877 |title=Notice of new dinosaurian reptiles from the Jurassic formations |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |volume=14 |pages=514-516}}</ref><ref name=PMG06/> He regarded both species as small ("fox-sized") animals.<ref name=OCM77b/> He assigned this genus to the now-abandoned family Nanosauridae.

The next year, he named the new genus ''[[Laosaurus]]'' on material collected by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]] from [[Como Bluff]], [[Wyoming]].  Two species were named: the [[type species]] ''L. celer'', based on parts of eleven [[vertebra]]e (YPM 1875);<Ref name=OCM78>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |authorlink=Othniel Charles Marsh |year=1878 |title=Notice of new dinosaurian reptiles |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |volume=15 |pages=241-244}}</ref> and the "smaller" ''L. gracilis'', originally based on a back vertebra's [[vertebra|centrum]], a [[tail|caudal]] centrum, and part of an [[ulna]] (review by [[Peter Galton]] in 1983 finds the specimen to now consist of thirteen back and eight caudal centra, and portions of both hindlimbs).<ref name=OCM78/><ref name=PMG83>{{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M. |authorlink=Peter Galton |year=1983 |title=The cranial anatomy of ''Dryosaurus'', a hypsilophodontid dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic of North America and East Africa, with a review of hypsilophodontids from the Upper Jurassic of North America |journal=Geologica et Palaeontologica |volume=17 |pages=207-243}}</ref>   

A third species, ''L. consors'', was established by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part of at least one other individual.<ref name=OCM94>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |year=1894 |title=The typical Ornithopoda of the American Jurassic |journal=American Journal of Science (Series 3) |volume=48 |pages=85-90}}</ref>  The skull was only partially preserved, and the fact that the vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially-grown individual.  Galton (1983) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.<ref name=PMG83/>

These animals attracted little professional attention until the 1970s and 1980s, when Peter Galton reviewed many the "hypsilophodonts" in a series of papers.  In 1973, he and [[James A. Jensen|Jim Jenson]] described a partial skeleton ([[Brigham Young University|BYU ESM 163]] as of Galton, 2006) missing the head, hands, and tail as ''Nanosaurus (?) rex'', which had been damaged by other collectors prior to description.<ref name=GJ73>{{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M. |coauthors=and Jensen, James A. |year=1973 |title=Skeleton of a hypsilophodontid dinosaur (''Nanosaurus (?) rex'') from the Upper Jurassic of Utah |journal=Brigham Young University Geology Series |volume=20 |pages=137-157}}</ref>  By 1977, he had determined that ''Nanosaurus agilis'' was quite different from ''N. rex'' and the new skeleton, and coined ''[[Othnielia]]'' for ''N. rex''.<ref name=PMG77>{{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M. |year=1977 |title=The ornithopod dinosaur ''Dryosaurus'' and a Laurasia-Gondwanaland connection in the Upper Jurassic |journal=Nature |volume=268 |pages=230-232}}</ref> The 1977 reference, somewhat buried in a paper concerning the transcontinental species of ''[[Dryosaurus]]'', did not elaborate, but did assign ''Laosaurus consors'' and ''L. gracilis'' to the new genus, and considered ''L. celer'' a ''[[nomen nudum]]''.<ref name=PMG77/>  The publication of ''[[Drinker]]''<ref name=BGSF90/> further complicated matters.

Most recently, in 2006 Galton reevaluated Morrison Formation ornithischians and concluded that the femur on which "Nanosaurus" ''rex'' (and by extension ''Othnielia'') is based is not diagnostic, and reassigned the BYU skeleton to ''Laosaurus consors'', which is based on more diagnostic material. As the genus ''Laosaurus'' is also based on nondiagnostic material, he gave the species ''L. consors'' its own genus, ''Othnielosaurus''. As a result, in practical terms what had been thought of as ''Othnielia'' is now known as ''Othnielosaurus consors''. ''Othnielia'' is not a synonym of ''Othnielosaurus'', because they are based upon different specimens; however, the skeletons that had been used to describe and depict ''Othnielia'' were reassigned to ''Othnielosaurus'', leaving the older name with only the original femur.  The current status for the various species is as follows: ''Nanosaurus agilis'' is a possible basal ornithopod, "N." ''rex'' (''Othnielia'') is a dubious basal ornithopod,  ''Drinker nisti'' is its own tentatively valid taxon, ''L. consors'' is the type species for ''Othnielosaurus'',<ref name=PMG06/> and ''L. celer'' and ''L. gracilis'' are still considered dubious.<ref name=NSWC04/>

Typically, ''Othnielosaurus'' has been interpreted like other hypsilophodonts as a small, [[cursorial|swift]] [[herbivore]],<ref name=NSWC04/> although Bakker (1986) interpreted the possibly related ''Nanosaurus'' as an [[omnivore]].<ref name=RTB86>{{cite book |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |authorlink=Robert T.
