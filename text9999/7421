==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Biden was born in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], the son of Joseph R. Biden, Sr. and Catherine Eugenia "Jean" Finnegan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wargs.com/political/biden.html | title=Ancestry of Joe Biden | publisher=wargs.com}}</ref><ref name="timeline"/> He was the first of four siblings<ref name="timeline"/> and is of [[Irish Catholic]] heritage. He has two brothers, James Brian Biden and Francis W. Biden, and a sister, Valerie (Biden) Owens.<ref>Joe Biden biography [http://www.4biden.com/news/joe-biden-biography/]</ref> The Biden family moved to [[Claymont, Delaware]] when Biden was 10 years old,<ref name="timeline"/> and he grew up in suburban [[New Castle County, Delaware]], where his father was a car salesman. In 1961, Biden graduated from [[Archmere Academy]] in [[Claymont, Delaware|Claymont]], [[Delaware]]<ref name="timeline">{{cite web | url=http://biden.senate.gov/senator/timeline/ | title=Joe Biden Timeline | publisher=[[United States Senate]] | accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref> and, in 1965, from the [[University of Delaware]] in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]],<ref name="cong-bio"/> where he double majored in [[history]] and [[political science]].<ref name="timeline"/>  He then attended [[Syracuse University College of Law]], graduated in 1968, and was admitted to the Delaware [[Bar association|Bar]] in 1969.<ref name="cong-bio">{{cite web | publisher=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]] | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000444 | title=Biden, Joseph Robinette, Jr., (1942 - ) | accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref><ref> Delaware<U+2019>s Senators [http://www.russpickett.com/history/sentbio2.htm#biden]</ref><ref> {{cite book |author=Barone, Michael & Richard E. Cohen |title=The Almanac of American Politics |pages = p. 376}}</ref>

In 1966, while in law school, Biden married Neilia Hunter. They had three children, [[Beau Biden|Joseph R. "Beau" Biden III]], Robert Hunter, and Naomi. His wife and infant daughter died in a car accident shortly after he was first elected to the [[U.S. Senate election, 1972|U.S. Senate]] in 1972. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were seriously injured in the accident, but both eventually made full recoveries. Biden was sworn into office from their bedside. Persuaded not to resign in order to care for them, Biden began the practice of commuting an hour and a half each day on the train from his home in the [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] suburbs to [[Washington, DC]], which he continues to do.

In 1977, Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs. They have one daughter, Ashley, and are members of the Roman Catholic Church. In [[February 1988]], Biden was hospitalized for two [[Cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysms]] which kept him from the Senate for seven months.

Biden's elder son, Beau, was a partner in the Wilmington law firm of Bifferato, Gentilotti, Biden & Balick, LLC and was elected [[Attorney General]] of [[Delaware]] in 2006. He is a captain in the [[Delaware Army National Guard]], where he serves in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|Judge Advocate General]]'s (JAG) Corps. He is set to be deployed to Iraq in October, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2008-08-23

Since 1991, Biden has also served as an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[Widener University School of Law]], where he teaches a seminar on [[constitutional law]].

==United States Senator==
In 1969, Biden began practicing law in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]],<ref name="cong-bio"/> and was soon elected to the [[New Castle County]], [[County council #United States|County Council]], where he served from 1970 to 1972.<ref name="cong-bio"/> 

The [[U.S. Senate election, 1972|1972 U.S. Senate election]] presented Biden with a unique opportunity. Popular [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] incumbent [[United States Senators|Senator]] [[J. Caleb Boggs]] was considering retirement, which would likely have left [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV|Pete du Pont]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] Mayor [[Harry G. Haskell, Jr.]] in a divisive primary fight. To avoid that, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] was invited to a meeting to convince Boggs to run again with full [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] support. Boggs ran, but Biden eventually won.<ref>{{cite book |title = Only in Delaware, Politics and Politicians in the First State |last = Cohen |first = Celia |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 2002 |publisher = Grapevine Publishing |location = Newark, DE |pages=199 |id =}}</ref>

Biden took office on [[January 3]], [[1973]], at age 30, becoming the fifth-youngest U.S. Senator in United States history. At age 30, Biden was at the minimum age to become a [[United States Senators|U.S. Senator]]. He has since won additional terms easily, defeating James H. Baxter, Jr. in 1978, John M. Burris in 1984, M. Jane Brady in 1990, and Raymond J. Clatworthy in 1996 and 2002, usually with about 60 percent of the vote. He is now the longest-serving [[United States Senators|U.S. Senator]] in Delaware history. He is [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2008|running for re-election as senator in 2008]]. 

In [[1974]] freshman Senator Biden was named one of the ''200 Faces for the Future'' by [[TIME]] magazine.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879402-6,00.html 200 Faces for the Future - TIME<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Judiciary Committee===
[[Image:Joe Biden 2.jpg|left|thumb|Biden on ''[[Meet the Press]]'']]
Biden is a long-time member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary]], which he chaired from 1987 until 1995 and served as [[ranking member|ranking minority member]] from 1981 until 1987 and again from 1995 until 1997. In this capacity, he dealt with issues related to [[drug policy]], crime prevention, and [[civil liberties]]. While chairman, Biden presided over two of the most contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] confirmation hearings: [[Robert Bork]] in 1987 and [[Clarence Thomas]] in 1991.<ref name="autogenerated1"> {{cite book |author=Barone, Michael & Richard E. Cohen |title=The Almanac of American Politics |pages = p. 377}}</ref>

Biden has been involved in crafting many federal crime laws over the last decade, including the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994, also known as the Biden Crime Law. He also authored the landmark [[Violence Against Women Act]] of 1994 (VAWA), which contains a broad array of measures to combat [[domestic violence]] and provides billions of dollars in federal funds to address [[gender]]-based crimes. In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the section of VAWA allowing a federal civil remedy for victims of gender-motivated violence exceeded Congress' authority and therefore was [[U.S. Constitution|unconstitutional]].<ref> ''United States v.

As chairman of the [[International Narcotics Control Caucus]], Biden wrote the laws that created the nation's "[[Drug Czar]]," who oversees and coordinates national drug control policy. In [[April 2003]] he introduced the controversial ''Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act,'' also known as the [[RAVE Act]]. He continues to work to stop the spread of "[[date rape]] drugs" such as [[Rohypnol]], and drugs such as [[ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]] and [[Ketamine]]. In 2004 he worked to pass a bill outlawing [[steroids]] like [[androstenedione]], the drug used by many [[baseball]] players.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Biden's legislation to promote [[financial aid|college aid]] and [[student loan|loan]] programs allows families to deduct on their annual [[income tax]] returns up to $10,000 per year in higher education expenses. His "Kids 2000" legislation established a public/private partnership to provide computer centers, teachers, [[Internet]] access, and technical training to young people, particularly to low-income and at-risk youth.<ref>Kids 2000 Program [http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=229820&&] </ref>

===Foreign Relations Committee===

Biden is also a long-time member and current chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]. In 1997, he became the [[ranking member|ranking minority member]] and chaired the committee from [[June 2001]] through 2003. When Democrats re-took control of the Senate following the 2006 elections, Biden again assumed the top spot on the committee in 2007. His efforts to combat hostilities in the [[Balkans]] in the 1990s brought national attention and influenced presidential policy: traveling repeatedly to the region, he made one meeting famous by calling [[Serbian people|Serbian]] leader [[Slobodan Milosevic]] a "[[war crime|war criminal]]." He consistently argued for lifting the arms [[embargo]], training [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]], investigating war crimes and administering [[NATO]] air strikes. Biden's subsequent "lift and strike" resolution was instrumental in convincing President [[Bill Clinton]] to use military force in the face of systematic [[human rights]] violations.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}  Biden has also called on [[Libya]] to release political prisoner [[Fathi Eljahmi]].<ref>Biden Renews Call for Release of Libyan Political Prisoner [http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=255274] </ref>

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Biden was supportive of the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s efforts, calling for additional ground troops in [[Afghanistan]] and agreeing that [[Saddam Hussein]] was a threat that needed to be dealt with. The Bush administration rejected an effort Biden undertook with Senator [[Richard Lugar]] to pass a resolution authorizing military action only after the exhaustion of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] efforts. In [[October 2002]], Biden voted for the [[Iraq Resolution|final resolution]] to support the [[war in Iraq]]. He has long supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation, but has argued repeatedly that more soldiers are needed, the war should be internationalized, and the Bush administration should "level with the American people" about the cost and length of the conflict.<ref> {{cite book |author=Barone, Michael & Richard E. Cohen |title=The Almanac of American Politics |pages = p. 378}}</ref>

In [[November 2006]], Biden and [[Leslie Gelb]], President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, released a comprehensive strategy to end [[sectarian]] violence in [[Iraq]]. Rather than continuing the present approach or withdrawing, the plan calls for "a third way": [[federalism|federalizing]] Iraq and giving [[Kurd]]s, [[Shiite]]s, and [[Sunni]]s "breathing room" in their own regions.<ref> Iraq, A Way Forward [http://www.planforiraq.com/]</ref>

==Presidential campaigns==
Biden has twice ran for the Democratic nomination for President, he first ran in 1988, and again in 2008. Both times he was unsuccessful.

In 2003, Biden considered joining the Democratic field of candidates for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential race]] but decided otherwise, saying he did not have enough time to cultivate a sufficient fundraising base. Some thought Biden a possible running mate for presidential candidate [[John Kerry]], but Biden urged Kerry to select Republican Senator [[John McCain]] instead.<ref> McCain urged to join Kerry ticket, Reuters MSNBC (May 16, 2004)  [http://web.archive.org/web/20040803085719/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4961694/].</ref> Biden also had been widely discussed as a possible [[U.S. Secretary of State]] in a Democratic administration.<ref> Times Online [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article500363.ece]</ref>

===1988===
{{main|Joe Biden presidential campaign, 1988}}
In 1987, Joe Biden ran as a Democratic presidential candidate, formally declaring his candidacy at the [[Wilmington Station (Delaware)|Wilmington train station]] on June 9, 1987. In his speech, he challenged Americans to step beyond the materialism of the Reagan years. When the campaign began, Biden was considered a potentially strong candidate because of his moderate image, his supposed appeal to [[Baby Boomer]]s, his fundraising appeal<ref name="nyt083187"/> (Biden's $1.7 million raised in the first quarter of 1987 was more than any other candidate, including the then front-runner, [[Gary Hart]]), his high profile position as chair of the Senate Judiciary committee during the Robert Bork confirmation hearings, and, perhaps above all, his soaring oratory. Biden often seemed to try to inspire the same hope and idealism associated with 1960s liberals such as Robert Kennedy, especially as related to civil rights. He received considerable attention in the summer of 1986 when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate Hearing because of the Reagan administration's support of South Africa, which continued to support a system of Apartheid. By August 1987, however, Biden's campaign had already begun to lag behind those of [[Michael Dukakis]] and [[Richard Gephardt]].<ref name="nyt083187">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6123AF932A0575BC0A961948260 | title= Biden, Once the Field's Hot Democrat, Is Being Overtaken by Cooler Rivals | author=Toner, Robin | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=August 31, 1987}}</ref>

Then in September 1987, the campaign ran into serious trouble when he was accused of [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] a speech by [[Neil Kinnock]], then-leader of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DD1531F931A2575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden's Debate Finale: An Echo From Abroad | author=[[Maureen Dowd|Dowd, Maureen]] | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=September 12, 1987}}</ref> Though Biden had correctly credited the original author in all speeches but one, the one where he failed to make mention of the originator was caught on video.<ref>In the video Biden is filmed repeating a stump speech by Kinnock, with only minor modifications. <U+201C>Why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go a university?

My ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast Pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours? It's because they didn't have a platform on which to stand.<U+201D></ref>  Within days, it was also discovered that, while a first year law student at Syracuse Law School, Biden had plagiarized a law review article in a class paper he wrote. Though the then-dean of the law school, as well as Biden's former professor, played down the incident of plagiarism, they did find that Biden drew "chunks of heavy legal prose directly from" the article in question. Biden said the act was inadvertent due to his not knowing the proper rules of citation, and Biden was permitted to retake the course after receiving a grade of F in the course, which was subsequently dropped from his record when he retook the class. Biden also released at the same time the record of his grades as an undergraduate which were C's and D's with the exception of two A's in physical education, one B in a course on English writers and an F in ROTC during his first three semesters.<ref name="nyt091887">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DB143FF93BA2575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden Admits Plagiarism in School But Says It Was Not 'Malevolent' | author=[[E.

Faced with these revelations, Biden withdrew from the nomination race on September 23, 1987, saying his candidacy had been overrun by "the exaggerated shadow" of his mistakes.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DF173AF937A1575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden Withdraws Bid for President in Wake of Furor | author=[[E.

===2008 ===
{{main|Joe Biden presidential campaign, 2008}}
[[Image:JoeBiden08.gif|right|thumb|2008 campaign logo]]
Biden declared his candidacy for president on [[January 31]], [[2007]], although he had discussed running for months prior.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/31/AR2007013100404.html Biden Stumbles at the Starting Gate - washingtonpost.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In January 2006, Delaware newspaper columnist Harry F.

Themal | publisher=''[[The News Journal]]'' | date=January 23, 2006}}</ref> Themal concludes that this is the position Biden desires, and that in a campaign "he plans to stress the dangers to the security of the average American, not just from the terrorist threat, but from the lack of health assistance, crime, and energy dependence on unstable parts of the world."<ref name="themal"/> He goes on to quote ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Richard Cohen (Washington Post columnist)|Richard Cohen]] as saying that Biden's candidacy might be endangered by his "manic-obsessive running of the mouth."<ref name="themal"/>  This foreshadowed Biden's January 31 remark on fellow Democratic candidate and Senator [[Barack Obama]], frequently transcribed as, "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, I mean, that's a storybook, man."<ref>[http://www.observer.com/node/36658 Biden Unbound: Lays Into Clinton, Obama, Edwards - observer.com]</ref> However, several linguists and political analysts stated that the correct transcription includes a comma after the word "African-American", which "would significantly change the meaning (and the degree of offensiveness) of Biden's comment".<ref>[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004131.html Language Log: Biden's Comma]</ref> Still, his comments took second place on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of Top 10 Campaign Gaffes for 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1690170_1690790,00.html | title=Top 10 Campaign Gaffes | author=Christine Lim and M.J.

It has been speculated that Biden would accept the position of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] because of his foreign policy experience and credentials.<ref>[http://www.observer.com/2007/candidate-secretary-state A Candidate For Secretary Of State | The New York Observer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Biden has rejected the notion outright, saying "Under no administration will I accept the job of Secretary of State" and claimed to be focused only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, "I know a lot of my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'"<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007Nov29/0,4670,PoliticalPlayoftheDay,00.html FOXNews.com - Biden Won't Serve As Secretary of State - Politics | Republican Party | Democratic Party | Political Spectrum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other candidates commenting that "Joe is right" in the [[Democratic presidential debates, 2008|Democratic debates]] was converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbOa989IRYw YouTube - Joe is Right<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Biden was noted for his one-liners on the campaign trail, saying of then-Republican frontrunner [[Rudy Giuliani]] at the [[October 30]], [[2007]], debate in [[Philadelphia]], "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11."<ref>[http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071101/NEWS01/711010358/1043/NEWS01 Concord Monitor - 'A noun, a verb and 9/11'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On [[January 3]], [[2008]], during the Iowa caucuses, Biden announced that he would be dropping out of the presidential race when over half of the precincts were tallied in which he only captured 1% of Iowa's delegates behind [[Barack Obama]], [[John Edwards]], [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[Bill Richardson]]. He was running instead for a seventh Senate term when, in late August, he was picked by Obama to be his running mate.
