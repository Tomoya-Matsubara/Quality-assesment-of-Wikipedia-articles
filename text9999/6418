The '''German women's national football team''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Fu<U+00DF>ballnationalmannschaft der Frauen}}, {{IPA-de|<U+02C8>d<U+0254><U+026A><U+032F>t<U+0283><U+0259> fu<U+02D0>sbalnatsi<U+032F>o<U+02C8>na<U+02D0>l<U+02C8>man<U+0283>aft der <U+02C8>f<U+0280>a<U+028A><U+032F><U+0259>n|pron}}) represents [[Germany]] in international [[women's association football|women's football]] and is directed by the [[German Football Association]] (DFB).  The team&nbsp;<U+2013> informally called [[West Germany]] in English&nbsp;<U+2013> played its first international match in 1982. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, the DFB squad remained the national side of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The German national team is one of the most successful in women's football. They are two-time [[FIFA Women's World Cup|world champions]], having won the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003]] and [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup]]. Germany is the only nation which has won both the men's and the women's [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. The team has won seven of the ten [[UEFA Women's Championship|UEFA European Championships]], claiming the last five titles in a row. Germany has won three bronze medals at the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Women's Olympic Football Tournament]], finishing third in 2000, 2004 and 2008. [[Birgit Prinz]] holds the record for most appearances and is the team's all time leading goalscorer. Prinz has also set international records: she has received the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award three times and is the joint [[FIFA Women's World Cup#Overall top goalscorers|overall top goalscorer]] at the Women's World Cup.

Women's football was long met with scepticism in Germany and official matches were banned by the DFB until 1970. However, the popularity of the women's national football team has grown since the team won their first World Cup title. They were chosen as [[German Sportspersonality of the year|Germany's Sports Team of the Year]] in 2003. [[Silvia Neid]] has been the team's head coach since 2005, succeeding [[Tina Theune]] after nine years as her assistant. As of September 2011, Germany is ranked No. 2 in the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings]].

==History==
===Early history===
In 1955, the [[German Football Association|DFB]] decided to forbid women's football in all its clubs in [[West Germany]]. In its explanation, the DFB cited that "this combative sport is fundamentally foreign to the nature of women" and that "body and soul would inevitably suffer damage". Further, the "display of the body violates etiquette and decency".<ref>Theweleit, Daniel. [http://www.bpb.de/themen/PIDIRH,0,Mannschaftsportr%E4t_Deutschland.html Mannschaftsportr<U+00E4>t Deutschland]. Bundeszentrale f<U+00FC>r politische Bildung. 10 September 2007. Accessed 5 August 2008. "Diese Kampfsportart der Natur des Weibes im wesentlichen fremd ist", "K<U+00F6>rper und Seele erleiden unweigerlich Schaden", "verletze es Schicklichkeit und Anstand." {{de icon}}</ref> In spite of this ban, more than 150&nbsp;unofficial international matches were played in the 1950s and 1960s. On 30 October 1970, the ban on women's football was lifted at the DFB annual convention.<ref name="Geschichte">Hoffmann, Eduard and Nendza, J<U+00FC>rgen. [http://www.bpb.de/themen/CE11Q4,0,0,Geschichte_des_Frauenfu%DFballs.html Geschichte des Frauenfu<U+00DF>balls]. Bundeszentrale f<U+00FC>r politische Bildung. 1 May 2006. Accessed 5 August 2008. {{de icon}}</ref>

While other football associations had already formed official women's national teams in the 1970s, the DFB long remained uninvolved in women's football. In 1981, DFB official Horst R. Schmidt was invited to send a team to the unofficial women's football world championship. Schmidt accepted the invitation but hid the fact that West Germany had no women's national team at the time.<ref name="Geschichte"/> To avoid humiliation, the DFB sent the German club champions [[Bergisch Gladbach 09]], who went on to win the tournament.<ref>Hoffmann, Eduard and Nendza, J<U+00FC>rgen. (2005). "Verlacht, verboten und gefeiert <U+2013> Zur Geschichte des Frauenfu<U+00DF>balls in Deutschland", Landpresse, p. 48. {{de icon}}</ref> The DFB now saw a need for action and the women's national team was founded in 1982. DFB president Hermann Neuberger appointed [[Gero Bisanz]], an instructor at the [[Cologne]] Sports College, to set up the team.<ref name="welt">Kittmann, Matthias. [http://www.welt.de/sport/article1125689/Aus_einer_Peinlichkeit_wurden_Weltmeisterinnen.html Aus einer Peinlichkeit wurden Weltmeisterinnen]. ''Die Welt''. 22 August 2007. Accessed 7 August 2008. {{de icon}}</ref>

=== 1982<U+2013>1994: Difficult beginnings and first European titles ===

In September 1982, Bisanz organised two scouting training courses from which he selected a squad of 16 players.<ref name="sportschule"/> The team's first international match took place on 10 November 1982 in [[Koblenz]]. Following the tradition of the men<U+2019>s team, [[Switzerland women's national football team|Switzerland]] was chosen as West Germany's first opponent. Doris Kresimon scored the first international goal in the 25th minute. In the second half, 18-year-old [[Silvia Neid]] contributed two goals to the 5<U+2013>1 victory; Neid later became the assistant coach in 1996 and the head coach in 2005.<ref name="welt"/>

With five draws and one defeat, West Germany failed to qualify for the inaugural [[1984 European Competition for Women's Football|1984 European Championship]], finishing third in the qualifying group.<ref name="euro1984">[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/woco/history/season=1984/round=1175/group=948.html Season 1982 <U+2013> 1984, Group 4]. UEFA.com. Accessed 7 August 2008.</ref> In the beginning, Bisanz's primary objective was to close the gap to the [[Scandinavia]]n countries and [[Italy women's national football team|Italy]]&nbsp;<U+2013> then the strongest teams in Europe. He emphasized training in basic skills and the need for an effective youth programme.<ref name="teil1"/> Starting in 1985, Bisanz increasingly called-up younger players, but at first had little success with this concept, as West Germany again failed to qualify for the [[1987 European Competition for Women's Football|1987 European Championship]] finals.<ref name="euro1987">Saffer, Paul. [http://www.uefa.com/competitions/woco/history/season=1987/intro.html Norway victorious in Oslo]. UEFA.com. 16 January 2005. Accessed 7 August 2008.</ref> 

Undefeated and without conceding a goal, the German team qualified for the [[1989 European Competition for Women's Football|European Championship]] for the first time in 1989; the tournament was played on home soil in West Germany. The semi-final against Italy was the first international women's football match shown live on German television.<ref name="teil2"/> The game was decided by a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], in which goalkeeper Marion Isbert saved three penalty kicks and scored the winning penalty herself. On 2 July 1989 in [[Osnabr<U+00FC>ck]], West Germany played [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] in the final. Before a crowd of 22,000, they beat favourites Norway and won 4<U+2013>1 with goals from Ursula Lohn, [[Heidi Mohr]] and Angelika Fehrmann. This victory marked the team's first international title.<ref name="euro1989">Saffer, Paul. [http://www.uefa.com/competitions/woco/history/season=1989/intro.html Germany arrive in style]. UEFA.com. 16 January 2005. Accessed 7 August 2008.</ref>  

After [[German reunification]], the [[East German]] football association joined the DFB. The East German women's national football team had played only one official international match, losing 0<U+2013>3 to Czechoslovakia in a friendly match on 9 May 1990. The unified German team defended their title successfully at the [[1991 UEFA Women's Championship|1991 European Championship]]. After winning all games in the qualifying group, Germany again met Italy in the semi-final, this time winning 3<U+2013>0. On 14 July 1991, the German team once more faced Norway in the final. The game went to extra time, during which Heidi Mohr and Silvia Neid scored for Germany and secured the 3<U+2013>1 victory.<ref name="euro1991">Saffer, Paul. [http://www.uefa.com/competitions/woco/history/season=1991/intro.html Dominant Germany stride on]. UEFA.com. 16 January 2005. Accessed 7 August 2008.</ref> 

In November 1991, Germany participated in the first [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] in [[China]]. Following victories over [[Nigeria women's national football team|Nigeria]], [[Chinese Taipei women's national football team|Taiwan]] and Italy, the German team reached the quarter-final without conceding a single goal. Silvia Neid scored the first German World Cup goal on 17 November 1991 against Nigeria. Germany won the quarter-final against Denmark 2<U+2013>1 after extra time, but lost 2<U+2013>5  in the semi-final to the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]], who went on to win the tournament. Following a 0<U+2013>4 defeat in the third-place match against [[Sweden women's national football team|Sweden]], Germany finished fourth in the tournament.<ref name="wc1991">[http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=103/edition=3373/overview.html FIFA Women's World Cup <U+2013> China PR 1991].

The German team failed to defend their title at the [[1993 UEFA Women's Championship|1993 European Championship]], suffering a semi-final defeat to Italy in a penalty shootout, and later losing 1<U+2013>3 against Denmark in the third-place playoff.<ref name="euro1993">Saffer, Paul.

=== 1995<U+2013>2002: Olympic and World Cup disappointments ===
[[File:Birgit Prinz.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Birgit Prinz]] scored her first goal in a major tournament in 1995.]]
In 1995, Germany won its third [[1995 UEFA Women's Championship|European Championship]]. After winning all qualification matches, scoring 55 goals, the German team defeated [[England women's national football team|England]] 6<U+2013>2 over two legs in the semi-final. Germany met Sweden in the final, which was played at the [[Fritz Walter Stadion]] in [[Kaiserslautern]], Germany, on 26 March 1995. The Swedish team managed to score early, but Germany came back to win 3<U+2013>2 with goals from Maren Meinert, [[Birgit Prinz]] and [[Bettina Wiegmann]].<ref name="euro1995">Saffer, Paul.

At the [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995 Women's World Cup]] in [[Sweden]], the German team lost against the Scandinavian hosts, but still succeeded in winning their group by beating [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]] and [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]]. Germany won the quarter-final against England 3<U+2013>0, and defeated [[China women's national football team|China]] 1<U+2013>0 with a late goal by Bettina Wiegmann in the semi-final. On 18 June 1995 in [[Stockholm]], the German team appeared in their first Women's World Cup final. Facing Norway, they lost the match 0<U+2013>2, but as runners-up achieved their best World Cup result until then.<ref name="wc1995">[http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=103/edition=4654/overview.html FIFA Women's World Cup <U+2013> Sweden 1995].

Women<U+2019>s football was first played as an Olympic sport at the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics - Women's tournament matches|1996 Summer Olympics]]. Bettina Wiegmann scored the first Olympic goal in the opening match against Japan, which Germany won 3<U+2013>2. After losing their second group game against Norway 2<U+2013>3, and drawing with Brazil 1<U+2013>1, Germany was eliminated, finishing third in the group with four points from three matches.<ref name="olymp1996">[http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=509/edition=4715/overview.html Women's Olympic Football Tournament Atlanta 1996].

Silvia Neid ended her playing career and was appointed the new assistant coach.<ref name="meyer"/>

The [[1997 UEFA Women's Championship|1997 European Championship]] was the first test for new coach Theune. Following a defeat against Norway, Germany finished second in the qualifying group and only secured qualification by beating [[Iceland women's national football team|Iceland]] in a relegation play-off. After drawing with Italy and Norway, a victory over Denmark in the last group game saw the German team go through to the knockout stage. They beat Sweden 1<U+2013>0 in the semi-final, and on 12 July 1997, claimed their fourth European championship with a 2<U+2013>0 win over Italy, with goals from [[Sandra Minnert]] and Birgit Prinz.<ref name="euro1997">Saffer, Paul.

At the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999 Women's World Cup]] in the United States, the German team also failed to qualify directly, but managed to beat the [[Ukraine women's national football team|Ukraine]] in a qualifying play-off. Germany started their World Cup campaign by drawing with Italy and winning 6<U+2013>0 over [[Mexico women's national football team|Mexico]]. In the last group game, Germany drew 3<U+2013>3 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently had to face the hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], the crowd at the [[FedExField|Jack Kent Cooke Stadium]] was the biggest the German team had ever played in front of. Despite leading twice, they lost 2<U+2013>3 to the eventual World Cup winners.<ref name="wc1999">[http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=103/edition=4644/overview.html FIFA Women's World Cup <U+2013> USA 1999].

Germany competed at the [[Football at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Olympics]], winning all three group games against [[Australia women's national football team|Australia]], Brazil and Sweden. The German team dominated the semi-final against Norway, but lost the game 0<U+2013>1 after an [[own goal]] by [[Tina Wunderlich]] in the 80th minute.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/0,1518,95108,00.html Eigentor verhindert Traum-Finale gegen USA].

In 2001, Germany hosted the [[2001 UEFA Women's Championship|European Championship]]. Following victories over Sweden, [[Russia women's national football team|Russia]] and England in the group stage, the German team beat Norway 1<U+2013>0 in the semi-final courtesy of a diving header by [[Sandra Smisek]]. On 7 July 2001 in [[Ulm]], they met Sweden in the final, which was played in heavy rain. The game was scoreless after 90 minutes and went to extra time, where [[Claudia M<U+00FC>ller]] scored a [[golden goal]] and secured the fifth European title for Germany.<ref name="euro2001">Saffer, Paul.

At the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003 Women's World Cup]] in the United States, Germany was drawn in a group with [[Canada women's national football team|Canada]], Japan and [[Argentina women's national football team|Argentina]]. After winning all three group games, the German team defeated Russia 7<U+2013>1 in the quarter-final, which set up another clash with the United States. Germany's [[Kerstin Garefrekes]] scored after 15 minutes and goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg made several key saves. In the dying minutes of the semi-final, Maren Meinert and Birgit Prinz sealed the 3<U+2013>0 win. On 12 October 2003, Germany met Sweden in the World Cup final in [[Los Angeles]]. The Scandinavians went ahead before half time, but Maren Meinert equalized shortly after the break.

As reigning world champion, Germany played the opening game at the [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007 Women's World Cup]] in China, outclassing Argentina 11<U+2013>0. After a goalless draw against England and a 2<U+2013>0 win over Japan, the German team defeated [[North Korea women's national football team|North Korea]] 3<U+2013>0 in the quarter-final. They beat Norway by the same result in the semi-final, with goals from [[Kerstin Stegemann]], [[Martina M<U+00FC>ller (footballer)|Martina M<U+00FC>ller]] and a Norwegian own goal.

== Acceptance and popularity ==
For most of the 20th century, women's football was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon. When the DFB appointed [[Gero Bisanz]] to coach the newly founded women's national team, he was initially very reluctant about his assignment and feared it would harm his reputation.<ref name="portrait"/> Winning the [[1989 UEFA Women's Championship|1989 European Championship]] was the team's first international success, but it had little lasting effect on their popularity. As a gift for the first European trophy, every player received a [[tea set]], which is often cited as an example of male chauvinism and general lack of interest in the women's national team at that time.<ref name="portrait"/> This attitude within the German Football Association has changed considerably in the last two decades and current DFB president [[Theo Zwanziger]] is an outspoken supporter of women's football.<ref name="taz">[http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=sport&art=4344&id=sport-artikel&cHash=225de279f6 Die Fintenweiber].

Each member of the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003 Women's World Cup]] squad received a prearranged bonus of 15,000 [[euro]]s for winning the tournament; four years later the players received 50,000 euros for their successful title defense.<ref>Sport-Informations-Dienst.
