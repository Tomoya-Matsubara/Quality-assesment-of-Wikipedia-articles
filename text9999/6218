'''''Alive''''' is a [[live album]] released by [[Snot (band)|Snot]] in 2002. The songs were all performed and recorded at The Palace in [[Hollywood, California]] in May, 1998. Alive also features the last Snot track ever recorded with [[Lynn Strait]] on vocals, "Choose What?". This track, minus Strait's vocals, plus [[Serj Tankian]]'s vocals and lyrics, appeared on the [[Strait Up]] tribute album as "Starlit Eyes". This album is most likely Snot's last, due to their wishes not to continue following Strait's death.
