'''''R U Professional''''' is a song by the music group [[The Mae Shi]], inspired by the audio of a July 2008 outburst of actor [[Christian Bale]] on the set of ''[[Terminator Salvation]]''. The song was written and released by the group twenty-four hours after the February 2, 2009 appearance of the Bale outburst on the internet. In a statement released from The Mae Shi, the group explained that the audio from the Bale outburst "was so crazy" that they were inspired to record a song about it, further stating "it's a tribute song we made to celebrate the epic-ness of Christian Bale". The piece was made available on [[YouTube]] and via download on [[MediaFire]] on February 3, 2009.

The song has received generally positive reception. ''[[MTV.com]]'' characterized it as "a Devo-esque slice of new wave fun", and ''[[Dose (magazine)|Dose]]'' called it an "electro jam". Geoff Boucher of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "a jaunty pop ode to Bale". Music sites including ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' and ''Prefix Mag'' were impressed with the group's ability to write, record and release the video within twenty-four hours after the audio of the Bale outburst appeared on the internet.
