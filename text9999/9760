'''''Buena Vista Social Club''''' is a [[studio album]] by Cuban bandleader and musician [[Juan de Marcos Gonz<U+00E1>lez]] and American guitarist [[Ry Cooder]] with traditional [[Music of Cuba|Cuban musicians]], released September 16, 1997 on [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit Records]]. The album was produced by Cooder who travelled to [[Cuba]] to record sessions with the musicians, many of whom were previously largely unknown outside Cuba. The musicians and the songs were later also featured in a [[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|documentary film of the same name]]. The music featured on the album was inspired by the [[Buena Vista Social Club]], a membership club that was at its height during the 1940s and 1950s. Many of the musicians performing on the record were either former performers at the club or were prominent Cuban musicians during the era of the club's existence. Other younger musicians on the record trace their musical roots back to [[Cuban Revolution|pre-revolutionary]] Cuban music, mainly the famous [[Havana]] musical scene of the 1950s. 

''Buena Vista Social Club'' started a craze in the [[Western World]] for [[Latin American music]], particularly Cuban music,{{Fact|date=February 2007}} while it also earned a considerable amount of critical praise and has received numerous accolades from several music writers and publications.<ref name="acclaimed">[http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A2204.htm AcclaimedMusic: Buena Vista Social Club].

===Background===
In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder had been invited to Havana by British [[world music]] [[Record producer|producer]] Nick Gold of [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit Records]] to record a session where two [[Africa]]n [[High-life]] musicians from [[Mali]] were to collaborate with Cuban musicians.<ref name="interview"/> On Cooder's arrival (via [[Mexico]] to avoid the ongoing [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba]]),<ref name="telegraph">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/1997/06/28/brcuba28.xml "Hurricane Cooder hits Cuba"]. [[Daily Telegraph]]. Retrieved [[20 March]] [[2007]]</ref> it transpired that the musicians from Africa had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban ''[[Son Cubano (music)|son]]'' music with local musicians.<ref name="interview"/> Already on board the African collaboration project were Cuban musicians including bassist [[Orlando "Cachaito" L<U+00F3>pez]], guitarist [[Eliades Ochoa]] and musical director [[Juan de Marcos Gonz<U+00E1>lez]], who had himself been organizing a similar project for the [[Afro-Cuban All Stars]]. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer [[Manuel "Puntillita" Licea]], pianist [[Rub<U+00E9>n Gonz<U+00E1>lez]] and octogenarian singer [[Compay Segundo]], who all agreed to record for the project.<ref name="interview"/>

Within three days of the project's birth, Cooder, Gold and de Marcos had organized a large group of performers and arranged for recording sessions to commence at Havana's [[EGREM]] Studios, formerly owned by [[RCA]] records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s.<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/obituary/0,,999073,00.html Compay Segundo Obituary] [[Guardian Unlimited]]. Retrieved [[18 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Communication between the Spanish and English speakers at the studio was conducted via an interpreter, although Cooder reflected that "musicians understand each other through means other than speaking".<ref name="interview"/>

===Recording===
The album was recorded in just six days and contained fourteen tracks; opening with "Chan Chan" written by Compay Segundo, a four chord ''son'' that was to become what Cooder described as "the Buena Vista's calling card";<ref name="segundo">[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,999647,00.html "Life began at ninety"] Guardian Unlimited. Retrieved [[18 March]] [[2007]].</ref> and ending with a rendition of "La Bayamesa", a traditional Cuban patriotic song (not to be confused with the Cuban national anthem of the same name).<ref>[http://www.lajiribilla.co.cu/2003/n103_04/aprende.html Las Bayamesas]. La Jiribilla magazine. [[Juventud Rebelde]]. Retrieved [[18 March]] [[2007]]. ''"Desde finales de la segunda d<U+00E9>cada del siglo pasado hasta nuestros d<U+00ED>as, no hay dudas de que en Bayamo se han escrito otras hermosas e importantes obras musicales, que podr<U+00ED>an tambi<U+00E9>n llamarse bayamesas. Nadie puede negar sin embargo que las tres primeras bayamesas, compuestas ente 1851 y 1918, precisamente en un per<U+00ED>odo rotundo de afirmaci<U+00F3>n de nuestra identidad nacional, son parte entra<U+00F1>able del patrimonio de la naci<U+00F3>n cubana."''<br />Translation: "From the end of the 1910s to the present day, there is no doubt that in [[Bayamo]], beautiful and important music has been written that could also be called Bayamesas. Nobody can deny, nevertheless, that the first three Bayamesas, composed between 1851 and 1918 in a period of strong affirmation of our national identity, are an integral part of Cuban patriotism."</ref> The sessions also produced material for the subsequent release, ''Introducing... Rub<U+00E9>n Gonz<U+00E1>lez'', which showcased the work of the Cuban pianist.<ref name="telegraph"/>

==Music==
"[[Chan Chan (song)|Chan Chan]]", the first song on the album, is a Cuban song composition by Compay Segundo, revolving around two central characters, Juanita and Chan Chan.<ref name="Chan Chan">[http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/music/songs/chan_chan.html PBS notes on Chan Chan]</ref> The song was one of Compay's last compositions and was written in 1987.<ref name="Chan Chan"/> "Chan Chan" was recorded by Segundo himself various times as well as by many other Latin artists. "El cuarto de Tula" was composed by Gonzales Y Siaba Sergio Eulogio(1916 - 1989). It is sung by Eliades Ochoa with Ibrahim Ferrer and Manuel "Puntillita" Licea joining Ochoa in an extended [[descarga]] (jam) section improvising lyrics. Barbarito Torres plays a frenetic lute solo towards the end of the track. Timbales are played by the 13 year old Julienne Oviedo S<U+00E1>nchez.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/music/songs/el_cuarto_de_tula.html PBS: "El cuarto de Tula"]</ref> "Dos gardenias" is a [[bolero]] sung by Ibrahim Ferrer. The song was written by Isolina Carillo in the 1930s and became a huge success in the 1940s. The song was chosen for the album after Cooder heard Ferrer and Rub<U+00E9>n Gonz<U+00E1>lez improvising the melody before a recording session. Ferrer learned the song whilst playing with Cuban bandleader [[Benny Mor<U+00E9>|Beny Mor<U+00E9>]].<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/music/songs/dos_gardenias.html PBS: "Dos gardenias"]</ref> "<U+00BF>Y t<U+00FA> qu<U+00E9> has hecho?" was written 1920s by [[Eusebio Delfin|Eusebio Delf<U+00ED>n]] and features his friend Compay Segundo on tres and vocals. Segundo was traditionally a "second voice" singer providing a baritone counterpoint harmony. On the ''Buena Vista Social Club'' recording of "<U+00BF>Y t<U+00FA> qu<U+00E9> has hecho?", he multitracks both voices. The song also features a duet between Segundo on tres and Ry Cooder on guitar.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/music/songs/y_tu_que.html PBS: "<U+00BF>Y t<U+00FA> qu<U+00E9> has hecho?"]</ref>

"Veinte a<U+00F1>os" is a bolero written by [[Mar<U+00ED>a Teresa Vera]] and is sung on the ''Buena Vista'' album by the only female in the ensemble, [[Omara Portuondo]] with Segundo providing baritone.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/music/songs/viente_anos.html PBS: "Veinte a<U+00F1>os"]</ref> "El carretero" is a [[guajira]] (country lament) sung by Eliades Ochoa with the full ensemble providing additional instruments and backing vocals. "Candela" is a popular song written by [[Faustino Oramas]] with lyrics rich with sexual innuendo. On the album it is sung by Ibrahim Ferrer who improvises vocal lines throughout the track, and the whole ensemble perform an extended descarga. The title track, "Buena Vista Social Club", was written by bass player Cacha<U+00ED>to<U+2019>s father, [[Orestes L<U+00F3>pez]].<ref name="interview">[http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/musicians/bios/cooder_int_2_excerpts.html "Interview with Ry Cooder in Los Angeles, by Betty Arcos, host, <U+201C>The Global Village<U+201D>  Pacifica Radio June 27, 2000"]. ''Buena Vista Social Club'' site. [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS). Retrieved [[18 March]] [[2007]].</ref> The song spotlighted the piano work of Rub<U+00E9>n Gonz<U+00E1>lez and it was recorded after Cooder heard Gonz<U+00E1>lez improvising around the tune's musical theme before a day's recording session. After playing the tune, Gonz<U+00E1>lez explained to Cooder the history of the social club and that the song was the club's "mascot tune".<ref name="interview"/> When searching for a name for the overall project, manager Nick Gold chose the song's title. According to Cooder, "It should be the thing that sets it apart. It was a kind of club by then. Everybody was hanging out and we had rum and coffee around two in the afternoon. It felt like a club, so let<U+2019>s call it that. That<U+2019>s what gave it a handle."<ref name="interview"/>
