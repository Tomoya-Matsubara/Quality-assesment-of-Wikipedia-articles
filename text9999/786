[[Image:iranair.b747.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The US imposed sanction of 1995 bans aviation companies from selling aircraft and repair parts to [[Airlines of Iran|Iranian airlines]] directly.]]
This article outlines economic, trade, scientific and military sanctions against [[Iran]], which have been imposed by the [[U.S. government]], or under U.S. pressure by the international community through the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Currently the sanctions include a total embargo on dealings with Iran by U.S. citizens, and a ban on selling aircraft and repair parts to Iranian aviation companies.  One exception is that US-made goods can be supplied to Iran under certain circumstances as long as they are shipped to Iran from another country.  This exception was a result of the original [[Iran Libya Sanctions Act|Executive Order restricting trade with Iran]].  

==History==
===Hostage crisis===
In 1979, after the U.S. permitted the exiled [[Shah of Iran]] to enter the United States for medical treatment, and after rumors of another U.S. backed coup and re-installation of the Shah, a group of [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line|radical students]] took action in [[Tehran]] by [[Iran hostage crisis|seizing the American Embassy and taking hostage the people inside ]].<ref>Moin Khomeini, (2000), p.220</ref> The United States responded by freezing about $12 billion in Iranian assets, including bank deposits, gold and other properties. Some assets <U+2014> Iranian officials say $10 billion, U.S. officials say much less <U+2014> still remain frozen pending resolution of legal claims arising from the revolution.

===Iran<U+2013>Iraq War===
After the [[Iran<U+2013>Iraq War|invasion of Iran by Iraq]], the United States increased sanctions against Iran. In 1984, sanctions were approved prohibit weapons sales all U.S. assistance to Iran; the U.S. also opposed all loans to Iran from international financial institutions. In 1987, the U.S. further prohibited the importation and exportation of any goods or services from Iran.

===Rafsanjani and Khatami governments===
{{Main|Iran and Libya Sanctions Act}}
The term of President [[Rafsanjani]], who has said that he had tried to reduce tensions between Iran and the West,{{Fact|date=January 2009}} was marked by some of the toughest sanctions against Iran. In April 1995, President [[Bill Clinton]] issued a total embargo on U.S. dealings with Iran, prohibiting all commercial and financial transactions with Iran. Trade with the U.S., which had been growing following the end of the Iran<U+2013>Iraq War, ended abruptly.  One exception is that US-made goods can be supplied to Iran under certain circumstances as long as they are shipped to Iran from another country.  This exception was a result of the original Executive Order restricting trade with Iran.

In 1996, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Iran<U+2013>Libya Sanctions Act]] (ILSA). Under ILSA, all foreign companies that provide investments over $20 million for the development of [[petroleum]] resources in Iran will have imposed against them two out of seven possible penalties by the U.S.:<ref>Wright, Steven. ''The United States and Persian Gulf Security: The Foundations of the War on Terror'', Ithaca Press, 2007 ISBN 978-0863723216</ref>
* denial of Export-Import Bank assistance;
* denial of export licenses for exports to the violating company;
* prohibition on loans or credits from U.S. financial institutions of over $10 million in any 12-month period;
* prohibition on designation as a primary dealer for U.S. government debt instruments;
* prohibition on serving as an agent of the United States or as a repository for U.S. government funds;
* denial of U.S. government procurement opportunities (consistent with WTO obligations); and
* a ban on all or some imports of the violating company.

In response to the election of [[Iranian reformists|Iranian reformist]] President [[Mohammad Khatami]], President Clinton eased sanctions on Iran. A debate in the [[US Congress]] on whether to allow the expiration of ILSA, which some legislators argued hindered bilateral relations, and others argued would be seen as a concession on an effective program, ended on August 5, 2001, with its renewal by the Congress and signing into law by President [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="rep">[http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/23591.pdf ILSA - CRS Report for Congress]</ref> 

In 2000 the Khatami government managed to reduce the sanctions for some items like pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, [[caviar]] or [[Persian rugs]].  In February 2004, during the final year of Khatami's presidency, the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]] ruled against editing or publishing scientific manuscripts from Iran, and stated that U.S. scientists collaborating with Iranians could be prosecuted.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6976/full/427663a_fs.html "Publishers split over response to US trade embargo ruling"], ''Nature'', February 19, 2004</ref> 

===Ahmadinejad government===

[[File:650-fifth-avenue.jpg|thumb|In December 2008 the U.S. government sought 40 percent interest in [[650 Fifth Avenue]] on the edge of [[Rockefeller Center]] which it said was co-owned by Bank Melli.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/17/AR2008121703844_pf.html |title=U.S. Links Iranian Bank To Fifth Avenue Building |work=Washington Post |date=December 18, 2008}}</ref>]] After being [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|elected president]] in 2005 [[Ahmadinejad]] reversed the retroactive nuclear policy and lifted the suspension of [[uranium enrichment]], that had been put in place by the [[Iranian reformists|reformists]]. This raised red flags in the United States government, which began pushing for international sanctions against Iran over its [[Nuclear program of Iran|atomic ambitions]].<ref>{{cite news|http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D890900D-A483-4C19-86C8-41F35135090D.htm|title=Iraq prime minister to visit Iran|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=September 9 2006}}</ref> 

Iranian financial institutions are barred from directly accessing the U.S. financial system, but they are permitted to do so indirectly through banks in other countries. In September 2006, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on [[Bank Saderat Iran]], barring it from dealing with U.S. financial institutions, even indirectly. The move was announced by Stuart Levey, the undersecretary for treasury, who accused the major state-owned bank in Iran of transferring funds for certain groups, including [[Hezbollah]]. Levey said that since 2001 a Hezbollah-controlled organization had received 50 million U.S. dollars directly from Iran through Bank Saderat. He said the U.S. government will also persuade [[Europe]]an banks and financial institutions not to deal with Iran.<ref name="Xinhua ">[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200609/09/eng20060909_301143.html U.S. imposes sanctions on Iranian bank], ''People's Daily'', September 9, 2006</ref>

In June 2007, the U.S. state of [[Florida]] enacted a boycott on companies trading with Iran and Sudan, while [[New Jersey]]'s [[state legislature (United States)|state legislature]] was considering similar action.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181813036172&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull| title=New Jersey mulls banning Iran investments| publisher=[[Associated Press]]| work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]| date=June 14, 2007}}</ref>

As of November 2007, the following Iranian banks were prohibited from transferring money to or from United States banks:<ref>John B. Reynolds, III, Amy E. Worlton and Cari N. Stinebower, [http://www.wileyrein.com/publication.cfm?publication_id=13370 "U.S. Dollar Transactions with Iran are Subject to New Restrictions <U+2013> Tough Policy Decisions Face International Financial Institutions"], Wiley Rein LLP, November 28, 2007</ref>
* [[Bank Sepah]]
* [[Bank Saderat Iran]]
* [[Bank Melli Iran]]
* Bank Kargoshaee (aka Kargosa<U+2019>i Bank)
* Arian Bank (aka Aryan Bank)
* [[Bank Mellat]]
* [[Persia International Bank PLC]]

For individuals and small businesses, these banking restrictions have created a large opportunity for the [[hawala]] market, which allows Iranians to transfer money to and from foreign countries using an underground unregulated exchange system.<ref>Farnaz Fassihi and Chip Cummins, [http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14153 "Iranians scheme to elude sanctions"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', February 13, 2008</ref>

As of early 2008, the targeted banks, such as [[Bank Mellat]], had been able to replace banking relationships with a few large sanction-compliant banks with relationships with a larger number of smaller non-compliant banks.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a05a3cb2-6f9f-11dd-986f-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1 "Iran gets around US bank sanctions", By Najmeh Bozorgmehr in Tehran, [[Financial Times]], August 21, 2008]</ref> The total assets frozen in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] under the EU (European Union) and UN sanctions against Iran are approximately 976,110,000 pounds ($1.64 billion).<ref>[http://www.presstv.com/detail/98465.htm?sectionid=351020101 "Over $1.6 bn of Iranian assets frozen in Britain"], ''PressTV.com'', June 18, 2009</ref>

==Effects and criticism==

According to a Iranian journalist, the effects of sanctions in Iran include expensive basic goods and an aging and increasingly unsafe aircraft fleet. "According to reports from Iranian news agencies, 17 planes have crashed over the past 25 years, killing approximately 1,500 people."<ref>[http://www.mianeh.net/en/articles/?aid=169 Sara Shams | Tehran | 29 January 2009 ]</ref>

The U.S. forbids aircraft manufacturer [[Boeing]] to sell aircraft to Iranian aviation companies. The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] has warned that U.S. sanctions against Iran were placing civilian lives in danger by denying Iranian aviation necessary spare parts for aircraft repair.{{fact}} 

The European Union has been critical of most of the U.S. trade sanctions against Iran. Some EU Member States have criticized ILSA as a "double standard" in U.S. foreign policy, in which the United States vigorously worked against the [[Arab League boycott of Israel]] while at the same time promoted a worldwide boycott of Iran. The EU Member States have threatened formal counter-action in the [[World Trade Organization]]. <ref name="rep" />

According to a study by Akbar E. Torbat, "overall, the sanctions' economic effect" on Iran "has been significant, while its political effect has been minimal."<ref>Akbar E. Torbat, [http://cbapp.csudh.edu/depts/adjunct/atorbat/Article%20Jan-2005/Torbat%20j.1467-9701.2005.00671.x.pdf "Impacts of the US Trade and Financial Sanctions on Iran"], ''The World Economy'', Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 407-434, March 2005.</ref> 

According to the U.S. National Foreign Trade Council, in the medium-term, lifting US sanctions and liberalizing Iran<U+2019>s economic regime would increase Iran's total trade annually by as much as $61 billion (at the 2005 world oil price of $50/bbl), adding 32 percent to Iran<U+2019>s GDP. In the oil-and-gas sector, output and exports would expand by 25-to-50 percent (adding 3 percent to world crude oil production).

<blockquote>Iran could reduce the world price of crude petroleum by 10 percent, saving the United States annually between $38 billion (at the 2005 world oil price of $50/bbl) and $76 billion (at the proximate 2008 world oil price of $100/bbl). Opening Iran<U+2019>s market place to foreign investment could also be a boon to competitive US multinational firms operating in a variety of manufacturing and service sectors.<ref>Dean A. DeRosa & Gary Clyde Hufbauer, [http://www.nftc.org/default/trade/NFTC%20Iran%20Normalizaton%20Book.pdf "Normalization of Econmic Relations"],  National Foreign Trade Council, November 21, 2008</ref></blockquote> 

In 2009, there was discussion in the U.S. of implementing "crippling sanctions" against Iran, such as the [[Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act of 2009]], "if diplomatic overture did not show signs of success by the autumn". Professor Hamid Dabashi, of [[Columbia University]], said in August 2009 that this was likely to bring "catastrophic humanitarian consequences", while enriching and strengthening the "security and military apparatus" of "the [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Pasdaran]] and the [[Basij]]," and having absolutely no support from "any major or even minor opposition leader" in Iran.<ref>Hamid Dabashi, [http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/08/05/dabashi.sanctions.iran/ Commentary: Huge risks in Iran sanctions], August 5, 2009, CNN.com</ref>
