'''Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever''' (CCHF) is a widespread [[tick]]-borne [[viral disease]], a [[zoonosis]] of [[domesticated|domestic]] [[animal]]s and [[wildlife|wild animals]], that may affect humans. The [[pathogen]]ic [[virus (biology)|virus]], especially common in [[East Africa|East]] and [[West Africa]], is a member of the [[Bunyaviridae]] family of [[RNA virus]]es. Clinical [[disease]] is rare in [[infection|infected]] [[mammal]]s, but commonly severe in infected [[human]]s, with a 30% [[mortality rate]]. [[Outbreak]]s of illness are usually attributable to handling infected animals or people.

==Epidemiology==
[[Image:Hyalomma tick.png|thumb|Hyalomma tick]]
Sporadic infection of people is usually caused by ''[[Hyalomma]]'' tick bite. Clusters of illness typically appear after people treat, butcher or eat infected [[livestock]], particularly [[ruminant]]s and [[ostrich]]es. Outbreaks have occurred in clinical facilities where health workers have been exposed to infected [[blood]] and [[fomite]]s.

The causative organism is found in [[Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Middle East]], a belt across central [[Africa]] and [[South Africa]] and [[Madagascar]] (''see map ''[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/crimean_congoHF/en/]) The main environmental reservoir for the virus is small mammals (particularly [[European hare]], Middle-African [[hedgehog]]s and [[mastomys|multimammate rats]]). Ticks carry the virus to domestic animal stock. [[Sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[cattle]] develop high titers of virus in blood, but tend not to fall ill. [[Bird]]s are generally resistant with the exception of ostriches.

==Manifestations==
Typically, after a 1<U+2013>3 day [[incubation period]] following a tick bite (5<U+2013>6 days after exposure to infected blood or tissues), [[flu]]-like [[symptom]]s appear, which may resolve after one week. In up to 75% of cases, however, signs of [[hemorrhage]] appear within 3<U+2013>5 days of the onset of [[illness]]: first [[mood swing|mood instability]], [[agitation (emotion)|agitation]], [[mental confusion]] and throat [[petechia]]e, then soon [[nosebleed]]s, [[hematuria|bloody urine]] and [[hematemesis|vomiting]], and [[melena|black stools]]. The [[liver]] becomes [[hepatomegaly|swollen]] and painful. [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]] may occur as well as acute [[renal failure|kidney failure]] and [[shock]], and sometimes [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]].

[[Patient]]s usually begin to recover after 9<U+2013>10 days from symptom onset, but 30% die in the second week of illness.

==Public health measures==
Where mammal and tick infection is common agricultural regulations require de-ticking farm animals before transportation or delivery for [[slaughtering|slaughter]]. Personal tick avoidance measures are recommended, such as use of [[insect repellent]]s, adequate clothing and body inspection for adherent ticks.

When feverish patients with evidence of bleeding require [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|resuscitation]] or [[intensive care medicine|intensive care]] [[body substance isolation]] precautions should be taken.

The [[United States armed forces]] maintain special stocks of [[ribavirin]] to protect personnel deployed to [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] from CCHF.

==Treatment==
Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive, as there is no established specific treatment. [[Ribavirin]] is effective ''in vitro''<ref>{{cite journal | author=Watts DM, Ussery MA, Nash D, Peters CJ. | title=Inhibition of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viral infectivity yields ''in vitro'' by ribavirin | journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg. | year=1989 | volume=41 | pages=581&ndash;85 | id=PMID 2510529 }}</ref> and has been used during outbreaks,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Erg<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>l <U+00D6>, Celikbas A, Dokuzoguz B, ''et al.'' | title=The chacteristics of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in a recent outbreak in Turkey and the impact of oral ribavirin therapy | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year=2004 | volume=39 | pages=285&ndash;89}}</ref> but there is no trial evidence to support its use.

==Notable outbreaks==
During the summers of [[1944]] and [[1945]] over 200 cases of an acute, hemorrhagic, febrile illness occurred in [[Soviet union|Soviet]] troops rescuing the harvest following the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the [[Crimean Tatars]]. Virus was discovered in blood samples of patients and in the tick ''Hyalomma marginatum marginatum''. Researchers soon recognized that a similar disease had been occurring in the [[Central Asian Republics]]. In [[1969]] analysis of a preserved blood sample collected from a febrile child in [[Zaire]] in [[1956]] showed the same virus. This finding gave rise to the present name of the disease.

On [[July 28]], [[2005]] authorities reported 41 cases of CCHF in [[Turkey]]'s [[Yozgat Province]], with one death.
