'''Balarama''' ({{lang|sa|<U+092C><U+0932><U+0930><U+093E><U+092E>}}, ''Balar<U+0101>ma''), also known as '''Baladeva''', '''Balabhadra''' and '''Halayudha''', is the elder brother of the divine being, [[Krishna]] in [[Hinduism]]. Within [[Vaishnavism]] [[Hindu]] traditions Balarama is identified and worshipped as an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], and he is also listed as such in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/23/en1 Bhag-P 1.3.23] "In the nineteenth and twentieth incarnations, the Lord advented Himself as Lord Balarama and Lord Krishna"</ref> The truth as given by Krshna Dwaipayaya Vyasa Mahabharata (original version of Mahabhrata written by Vyasa) it is clearly given in Swargarohana Parva that Balarama is an incarnation of [[Adishesha]] on which the Lord Vishnu rests. Within both the Vaishnava traditions and Hinduism generally he is known as being a manifestation of [[Shesha]], the serpent on whom Vishnu rests.

The Bhagavata Purana describes [[Krishna]] as the original Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything else emanates. As part of this divine 'emanation', Krishna's very first expansion is Balarama, and from Balarama all other incarnations of God then appear. Of the three transcendental elements described in [[Sanskrit]] as ''[[Satchitananda|sat, cit and ananda]]'' ([[eternity]], [[knowledge]] and bliss), Balarama is in charge of ''eternity'' and ''knowledge''. Hence he is worshipped as the supreme teacher or ''Adiguru'' {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

Various narratives related to Balarama are found in the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Harivamsha]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]] and several other [[Puranas]]. This summary is based on these narratives.
=== Birth ===
Balarama was born as a son of [[Vasudeva]]. [[Kamsa|Kansa]], the brother of Devaki and an evil king, was intent upon killing all the children of his sister because of a prediction that he would die at the hands of her eighth son. Kansa thus threw his sister [[Devaki]] and her husband [[Vasudeva]] into prison, and proceeded to kill each of their children as they were born. However, the seventh child was transferred miraculously from Devaki's womb to the womb of Vasudeva's other wife [[Rohini Devi|Rohini]], who desired a child of her own. Thus Balarama's other name is also '''Samkarshan''' which describes the transfer of the child from the womb. Rohini gave birth to Balarama and raised him. The child was formally named Rama, but because of his great strength he was called Balarama (Strong Rama), Baladeva or Balabhadra. He was born under  [[Shravana]] nakshatra  on [[Shraavana]] [[Purnima]] or [[Raksha bandhan]].

===Childhood and marriage===

[[File:Krishna and his brother Balarama as young playful cowherds.jpg|thumb|Krishna and his brother Balarama as young playful cowherds]]
One day, [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda Maharaja]] requested [[Gargamuni]], the family priest to visit their home in order to give names to [[Krishna]] and Balarama. When Gargamuni arrived at his house Nanda Maharaja, received him very well and then requested him to perform the naming ceremony. Gargamuni then reminded Nanda Maharaja that [[Kamsa|Ka<U+1E41>sa]] was looking for the son of Devaki and said that if he performed the ceremony very opulently it would come to the notice of Kansa, who would then suspect that Krishna was the son of Devaki. Nanda Maharaja therefore asked [[Gargamuni]] to perform the ceremony in secret, and [[Gargamuni]] did so giving the reasons for Balarama's names as follows:

''"Because Balarama, the son of Rohini, increases the [[transcendental]] bliss of others, His name is Rama, and because of His extraordinary strength, He is called Baladeva. He attracts the Yadus to follow His instructions, and therefore His name is Sankarshana."'' [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/10/8/12/en1 Bhagavata Purana 10.8.12]
Balarama spent his childhood as a cowherd boy with his brother [[Krishna]] and friends. He killed '''Dhenukasura''', an [[asura]] sent by King Kansa and later '''Mushtika''', a wrestler of Kansa before Kansa's death. After Kansa's death, he and [[Krishna]] went to the sage [[Sandipani]]'s ''ashrama'' at [[Ujjain|Ujjayini]] for study. He later married [[Revati]], the daughter of King [[Kakudmi]], ruler of [[Kushasthali|{{IAST|Ku<U+015B>asthal<U+012B>}}]] or [[Anarta]]<ref>Pargiter, F.E. (1922, reprint 1972). ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.98</ref>

===In the Kuruk<U+1E63>etra war of the Mah<U+0101>bh<U+0101>rata===
[[File:Canvas1.png|thumb|150px|Duryodana was defeated by Bhima - A scene from Razmanama]]
Balarama famously taught both [[Duryodhana]] of the Kauravas and [[Bhima]] of the Pandavas the art of fighting with a mace. When war broke between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, Balarama was equally affectionate to both parties and so decided to be neutral. Eventually when Bhima (of greater strength) defeated Duryodhana (of greater skill) by dealing a blow below the navel with his mace (a move against the rules of mace combat), Balarama threatened to kill Bhima. This was only prevented when Krishna reminded Balarama of Bhima's vow to kill Duryodhana by crushing the very thigh he exposed to his wife [[Draupadi]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

=== Death ===
[[File:Illustrations from the Barddhaman edition of Mahabharata in Bangla, which were printed in wood engraving technique (5).jpg|thumb|left|Balarama sat down in a meditative state]]
In the [[Bhagavata Purana]] it is described that after Balarama took part in the battle that caused the destruction of the rest of the [[Yadu]] dynasty, and after he witnessed the disappearance of [[Krishna]], he then sat down in a meditative state and departed from this world.<ref>[http://vedabase.net/sb/11/30/26/en1 Bhag-P 11.30.26]</ref> In some accounts it is described that a great white snake left Balarama's mouth at this point in reference to his identity as Ananta-[[Sesha]]. And the place where he departed from this world is situated about 1&nbsp;km far from [[Somnath Temple]] in [[Gujarat]]. There is one [[cave]] at that place and the white snake who came out of Balarama's mouth got into that cave and went back to ''Paatal Lok'' as the local people of [[Veraval]] say.

== Worship ==
[[Image:BalaramaMauesCoin1stCenturyBCE.jpg|right|thumb|Coin of [[Maues]] depicting Balarama, 1st century BCE.]]
One of the early references of Balarama worship is found in Kautilya's [[Arthashastra]] (13.3)<ref>Rangarajan, L.N. (1992) (edited, rearranged and translated), ''Kautilya - The Arthashastra'', New Delhi: Penguin, ISBN 0-14-044603-6, p.518</ref> Early individual Balarama worship was followed by his worship along with Krishna by various Vaishnava sects.The most revered temple of Krishna & Balarama is in [[Jagannatha Puri]].

===Vaikhanasa belief===
Sage Atri's Samurtachanadhikara of [[vaikhanasa]]s, the most ancient school of vaishnava theology says protocols for building of temples and idol for Balarama with his consort

=== Pancharatra belief ===

The [[Pancharatra]]s, one of the earliest Vaishnava sects worshipped Samkarshana as the second ''vyuha'' of Godhead.

=== Gaudiya Vaishnava belief ===

[[Image:Krishna Balarama12.jpg|thumb|left|Krishna-Balarama [[murti|deities]] at the Krishna-Balarama [[Temple]] in [[Vrindavan]]]]
[[Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] believe that Balarama is the Supreme Personality of Godhead himself. He is worshipped as equal in supremacy to Krishna, yet wherever [[Krishna]] appears, Baladeva appears as Krishna's brother, sometimes elder, sometimes younger. Balarama is constantly serving Krishna in every respect in all of Krishna's incarnations and manifestations. In [[Rama]]-lila, Balarama serves [[Ramachandra]] as his younger Brother, [[Lakshmana]] and in the current age ([[Kali-yuga]]), Balarama spreads the '[[Sankirtan]] movement' of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] as his close friend [[Nityananda]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The only [[theological]] difference between Krishna and Balarama is that the bodily hue of Krishna is dark and that of Balarama is fair. Krishna is the Creator, and Balarama is his creative [[potency]], but they are both worshipped as the Supreme [[Primeval]] Lord.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

== Iconography ==

[[Image:Baladewa-kl.jpg|thumb|Balarama in Javanese [[Wayang]]]]
Balarama is almost always depicted as being fair skinned, especially in comparison to his brother, Krishna, who is shown as dark blue or black. His ''<U+0101>yudha''s (weapons) are the ''hala'' (plough) and the ''gad<U+0101>'' ([[Mace (club)|mace]]). Traditionally Balarama wears blue garments and a [[garland]] of forest flowers. His hair is tied in a topknot and he has earrings, bracelets and armlets. Balarama is described as being physically very strong.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==In Jainism==
The [[Jainism|Jain]] [[Puranas]], notably, the ''Tri<U+1E63>a<U+1E63><U+1E6D>i<U+015B>al<U+0101>k<U+0101>puru<U+1E63>acarita'' of [[Acharya Hemachandra]], narrate hagiographical accounts of nine Baladevas or Balabhadras, who are believed to be the ''[[Salakapurusa|<U+015B>al<U+0101>k<U+0101>puru<U+1E63>a]]''s (literally "torch-bearers, great personalities"). These nine Baladevas are: Achala, Vijaya, Bhadra, Suprabha, Sudar<U+015B>ana, <U+0100>nanda, Nandana, Padma ([[Rama]] in Hinduism) and R<U+0101>ma (Balarama in Hinduism).<ref>{{cite book | title=Iconography of Balar<U+0101>ma | publisher=Abhinav Publications | author=Joshi, Nilakanth Purushottam | year=1979 | location=New Delhi | isbn=81-7017-107-5}}, p. 5</ref>
