'''Wireless network''' refers to any type of [[computer network]] that is not connected by cables of any kind. It is a method by which homes, [[telecommunications network]]s and enterprise (business) installations avoid the costly process of introducing cables into a building, or as a connection between various equipment locations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Overview of Wireless Communications|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521837162&ss=exc|publisher=cambridge.org|accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> [[Wireless]] [[telecommunication]]s networks are generally implemented and administered using a transmission system called [[radio waves]]. This implementation takes place at the physical level (layer) of the network structure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Getting to Know Wireless Networks and Technology|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=98132|publisher=informit.com|accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref>

==Types of wireless connections==
===Wireless PAN===
[[Personal area network | Wireless Personal Area Networks]] (WPANs) interconnect devices within a relatively small area, that is generally within a person's reach. For example, both [[Bluetooth]] radio and invisible [[Infrared]] light provides a WPAN for interconnecting a headset to a laptop. [[ZigBee]] also supports WPAN applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wireless-nets.com/resources/downloads/wireless_industry_report_2007.html|title=Wireless Network Industry Report|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> Wi-Fi PANs are becoming commonplace (2010) as equipment designers start to integrate Wi-Fi into a variety of consumer electronic devices. [[Intel]] "My WiFi" and [[Windows 7]] "[[virtual]] Wi-Fi" capabilities have made Wi-Fi PANs simpler and easier to set up and configure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.in/Software/10-04-27/Wi-Fi_personal_area_networks_get_a_boost_with_Windows_7.aspx|title=Wi-Fi Personal Area Networks get a boost with Windows 7 and Intel My WiFi|accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

===Wireless LAN===
{{Main|Wireless LAN}}
A wireless local area network (WLAN) links two or more devices over a short distance using a wireless distribution method, usually providing a connection through an access point for [[Internet access]]. The use of [[spread-spectrum]] or [[OFDM]] technologies may allow users to move around within a local coverage area, and still remain connected to the network.

Products using the [[IEEE 802.11]] WLAN standards are marketed under the [[Wi-Fi]] bradn name.
[[Fixed wireless]] technology implements [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] links between computers or networks at two distant locations, often using dedicated [[microwave]] or modulated [[laser light]] beams over [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] paths.  It is often used in cities to connect networks in two or more buildings without installing a wired link.

=== Wireless mesh network ===
{{main|wireless mesh network}}
A wireless mesh network is a wireless network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology.
Each node forwards messages on behalf of the other nodes.
Mesh networks can "self heal", automatically re-routing around a node that has lost power.

===Wireless MAN===
[[Wireless MAN|Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks]] are a type of wireless network that connects several wireless LANs.
*[[WiMAX]] is a type of Wireless MAN and is described by the [[IEEE 802.16]] standard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techpluto.com/wimax-in-detail/|title=Facts About WiMAX And Why Is It "The Future of Wireless Broadband"}}</ref>

===Wireless WAN===
[[Wireless WAN|Wireless wide area networks]] are wireless networks that typically cover large areas, such as between neighboring towns and cities, or city and suburb.  These networks can be used to connect branch offices of business or as a public internet access system.   The wireless connections between access points are usually [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point to point]] [[Microwave transmission|microwave links]] using [[parabolic dish]]es on the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band, rather than [[omnidirectional antenna]]s used with smaller networks.  A typical system contains base station gateways, access points and wireless bridging relays. Other configurations are mesh systems where each access point acts as a relay also. When combined with renewable energy systems such as photo-voltaic solar panels or wind systems they can be stand alone systems.

===Mobile devices networks===
{{See|mobile telecommunications}}
With the development of [[smart phone]]s, [[cellular network|cellular telephone networks]] routinely carry data in addition to telephone conversations:
*[[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM): The GSM network is divided into three major systems: the switching system, the base station system, and the operation and support system. The cell phone connects to the base system station which then connects to the operation and support station; it then connects to the switching station where the call is transferred to where it needs to go. GSM is the most common standard and is used for a majority of cell phones.<ref>{{Cite web | title = GSM World statistics | publisher = GSM Association | date = 2010 | url = http://www.gsmworld.com/newsroom/market-data/market_data_summary.htm|accessdate=16 march 2011}}</ref>
*[[Personal Communications Service]] (PCS): PCS is a radio band that can be used by mobile phones in North America and South Asia. Sprint happened to be the first service to set up a PCS.
*[[D-AMPS]]: Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service, an upgraded version of AMPS, is being phased out due to advancement in technology.  The newer GSM networks are replacing the older system.

==Uses==
Some examples of usage include [[Cellular phone]]s which are part of everyday wireless networks, allowing easy personal communications. Another example, Inter-continental network systems, use radio [[satellite]]s to communicate across the world.  [[Emergency service]]s such as the police utilize wireless networks to communicate effectively as well. Individuals and businesses use wireless networks to send and share data rapidly, whether it be in a small office building or across the world.
===General===
In a general sense, wireless networks offer a vast variety of uses by both business and home users.<ref name="dean">{{cite book |author= Dean Tamara |title= Network+ Guide to Networks |year=2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Boston |edition= 5th |isbn= 9781423902454 }}</ref> 
<blockquote>"Now, the industry accepts a handful of different wireless technologies. Each wireless technology is defined by a standard that describes unique functions at both the Physical and the Data Link layers of the OSI Model. These standards differ in their specified signaling methods, geographic ranges, and frequency usages, among other things. Such differences can make certain technologies better suited to home networks and others better suited to network larger organizations."<ref name="dean"/></blockquote>

===Performance===
Each standard varies in geographical range, thus making one standard more ideal than the next depending on what it is one is trying to accomplish with a wireless network.<ref name="dean"/> 
The performance of wireless networks satisfies a variety of applications such as voice and video. The use of this technology also gives room for future expansions. As wireless networking has become commonplace, sophistication increased through configuration of network hardware and software.<ref name="daddy">{{cite web |title= Wireless LAN Technologies |work= Source Daddy web site |url=http://sourcedaddy.com/networking/wireless-lan-applications.html |accessdate= August 29, 2011 }}</ref> 

===Space===
Space is another  characteristic of wireless networking . Wireless networks offer many advantages when it comes to difficult-to-wire areas trying to communicate such as across a street or river, a warehouse on the other side of the premise or buildings that are physically separated but operate as one.<ref name="daddy"/> Wireless networks allow for users to designate a certain space which the network will be able to communicate with other devices through that network.
Space is also created in homes as a result of eliminating clutters of wiring.<ref name="center">{{cite web |title= WLAN Benefits |work= Wireless Center commercial web site |url= http://www.wireless-center.net/Cisco-Wireless-Networking/726.html |accessdate= August 29, 2011 }}</ref> This techonology allows for an alternative to installing physical network mediums such as [[Twisted pair|TP]]s, [[Coaxial cable|coax]]es, or [[Optical fiber|Fiber-optic]]s,  which can also be expensive.

===Business===
Organizational end users  integrate wireless LANs into corporate information systems.<ref name="daddy"/>  These uses of wireless networking are now seen as practical and cost effective for companies to compete in a global market. Wireless technologies are applicable to all industries, especially for those that stress immediate processing. These industries are finding creative and innovating ways to place portable computers in industry workes that are hands on such as doctors, nurses, warehouse clerks, inspectors, claims adjustors, real estate agents, and so on.<ref name="daddy"/> By using wireless technology, businesses are able to couple portable devices with a database and specific applications which in turn meet mobility needs.<ref name="daddy"/>

===Home===
For homeowners, wireless technology is an effective option as compared to [[ethernet]] for sharing printers, scanners, and high speed internet connections. WLANs help save from the cost of installation of cable mediums, save time from physical installation, and also creates mobility for devices connected to the network.<ref name="center"/>
Wireless networks are simple and require one single [[access point]] connected directly to the Internet via a [[Router (computing)|router]].<ref name="dean"/> 

==Environmental concerns==
{{see also|Wireless electronic devices and health}}
Starting around 2009, there have been increased concerns about the safety of wireless communications, despite little evidence of health risks so far.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Wi-Fi: Children at risk from 'electronic smog'|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/health_medical/article2472133.ece|publisher=news.independent.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-08 | location=London | first=Geoffrey | last=Lean | date=2007-04-22}}</ref> The president of [[Lakehead University]] refused to agree to installation of a wireless network citing a California Public Utilities Commission study which said that the possible risk of tumors and other diseases due to exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) needs to be further investigated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian university says no to WiFi over health concerns|url=
