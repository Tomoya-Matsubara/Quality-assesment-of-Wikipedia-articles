In the spring of 2012, [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] started a station and track rehabilitation program dubbed "'''Red Ahead,'''"<ref name=" redahead">{{cite web|title=CTA Red Ahead Program|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/redahead/|publisher=Chicago Transit Authority|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref> beginning on the North Side Main Line, which is called the "Red North" project.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Ahead: CTA Red North|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/rednorth/|publisher=Chicago Transit Authority|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref> The program monitors the full route of the Red Line, which doesn't include the stations of Loyola, Bryn Mawr, Sheridan, or Wilson.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red North - Section 2|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/rednorth/#sheridan-brynmawr-loyola|publisher=Chicago Transit Authority|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref> This also doesn't include stations between Wilson through Fullerton, nor the State Street Subway. In May 2012, the CTA started to work on the North Side Main Line stations of the Red Line which includes Jarvis, Morse, Granville, Thorndale, Berwyn, Argyle, and Lawrence. The stations are listed in order, starting at Granville, then Morse, Thorndale, Argyle, Berwyn, Lawrence, and finally Jarvis. This project started in June 2012 and is scheduled to continue to December. This project is also part of the Red Ahead's "Red & Purple Modernization" project.<ref>{{cite web|title=CTA Red & Purple Modernization project|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/rpmproject/|publisher=Chicago Transit Authority|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref>

==Extension==
Proposals are currently underway to extend the Red Line south from 95th Street. The CTA developed nine different proposed routes, one of which includes routing the Red Line down the median of the Bishop Ford Freeway and another in the median of Interstate 57. During an alternatives analysis meeting on April 11, 2007, CTA narrowed further study down to five possible routes, two for [[bus rapid transit]] and three for [[rapid transit|heavy rail (rapid) transit]]. The two bus routes would travel south from the 95th/Dan Ryan terminal either down [[Halsted Street]] or [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], while the heavy rail routes left for consideration were the Halsted and Michigan corridors (either underground or elevated) as well as the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] corridor (elevated or trench), which would traverse southeastward toward the [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]]. In October 2008 the CTA commissioned a $150,000-study of an extension due south to 130th/Stony Island in the [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]].<ref>{{cite web |title=RTA Funded Study Looks at the Impact of the Proposed Red Line Extension|author=Regional Transit Authority |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2008-10-09|url=http://www.rtachicago.com/CMS400Min/uploadedFiles/10-03-08__RTA-CP_UIC-DCP%20Red%20Line%20Ext_FINAL.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Alternatives===
In December 2008, at the Screen 2 presentation of the federally mandated Alternatives Analysis Study, the possible corridors and modes of transit were furthered narrowed down to either Halsted Street (Bus Rapid Transit or elevated Heavy Rail Transit) and the Union Pacific Railroad corridor (elevated Heavy Rail Transit).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/alternatives_analysis/redpubpress200812part2.pdf|title=Red Line Extension Alternatives Analysis Study|accessdate=6 January 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>

In December 2009, the CTA identified the Locally Preferred Alternative as the Union Pacific corridor.<ref name="eis about">{{cite web|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/redeis/alternatives.aspx|title=About the Project: Alternatives|work=Red Line Extension Project|publisher=Chicago Transit Authority|accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref> A map and description of the route are found here: [http://www.transitchicago.com/redeis/alternatives.aspx] Multiple Environmental Impact Studies will be carried out, and will determine exact alignments and design.<ref name="eis about"/><ref name="eis schedule">{{cite web|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/redeis/schedule.aspx|title=Project Schedule|work=Red Line Extension Project|publisher=Chicago Transit Authority|accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref> 

The alignment consists of a new elevated rail line between 95th St and a new terminal station at 130th, paralleling a [[Union Pacific Railroad]] line through the Far South Side neighborhoods of [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]], [[West Pullman, Chicago|West Pullman]], and [[Riverdale, Chicago|Riverdale]].  In addition to the terminal station at 130th, three new stations would be built at 103rd Street, 111th Street, and 115th Street.  Basic engineering, along with an environmental impact statement, are currently underway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transitchicago.com/redeis/default.aspx |title=Red Line Extension Project |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Chicago Transit Authority |accessdate=February 25, 2010}}</ref>

==Red & Purple Modernization Project==
As part of the program, the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] also dubbed the "Red & Purple Modernization Project."<ref>{{cite web|title=Red & Purple Modernization|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/rpmproject/|work=Chicago Transit Authority|publisher=transitchicago.com|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref> CTA recently studied four possible alternatives for the project and they are willing to provide community updates that can make improvements of those studies in late 2012 to 2013. CTA is also proposing to close down five stations on the Red and Purple lines. The five potential stations include [[Foster (CTA station)|Foster]], [[South Boulevard (CTA station)|South Boulevard]], [[Jarvis (CTA station)|Jarvis]], [[Lawrence (CTA station)|Lawrence]], and [[Thorndale (CTA station)|Thorndale]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Environmental Impact Statement Scoping Information|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/rpmproject/RPM_-_web_ScopingBook_redpurple_FTA.pdf|work=North Red and Purple Modernization Project|publisher=Chicago Transit Authority|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref>

In 2011, CTA planned a scoping process and which they provided public meetings and a comment period. The purpose of the scoping process was to ask operators and attentive parties to provide guidance on the proposed alternatives, the purpose and need for the project and the proposed topics of evaluation and potential effects and mitigation measures to be considered. During the scoping process CTA introduced six alternatives as part of the project. Based on public guidance, CTA is no longer studying three of those alternatives, and has since added an additional alternative, which studies the effects of Modernization without station consolidation.
