The '''A158''' road is a major tourist route that heads from [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] in the west to [[Skegness]] on the east coast. The road is located entirely in the [[county]] of [[Lincolnshire]] and is [[single carriageway]] for almost its entirety. The road is approximately {{convert|41|mi|km}} long. The road gets quite congested with holiday traffic during the summer.

==Lincoln to Horncastle==
[[File:The road to Lincoln - geograph.org.uk - 1152235.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Approach to Lincoln at North Greetwell]]
The road begins outside Lincoln as part of the by-pass at the [[A46 road|A46]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.2542|-0.5130|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A158 road (western end)}}).}} roundabout with ''Nettleham Road'' (B1182). The road does not enter the borough of Lincoln, and begins in the parish of [[Nettleham]] in [[West Lindsey]]. Before the Lincoln Bypass was built (in stages) in the mid-1980s, the A158 historically went along ''Wragby Road'' (now the A15). Even earlier the A158 followed the northern end of ''Canwick Road'', the former B1188, over Pelham Bridge since its opening in 1958, and along ''South Park Avenue'' which was also built in 1958, to meet the former A46 at [[St. Catherines, Lincoln|St Catherine's]]. This was parallel to the former western section B1190. The A15 at the time followed the west of Lincoln town centre, then along ''Silver Street''. 

It heads south east for {{convert|1|mi}} until reaching a roundabout where the [[A15 road (Great Britain)|A15]] joins from the centre of Lincoln. From here the route heads north-east [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2668659 through] the village of [[North Greetwell]] along a former [[Roman road]], where it is the parish boundary between [[Nettleham]] to the north and [[Greetwell, West Lindsey|Greetwell]] to the south, Nettleham and [[Reepham, Lincolnshire|Reepham]], then [[Sudbrooke]] and Reepham. It passes Sudbrooke to the south, where there is a [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2668667 crossroads], with the main road for Sudbrooke to the left, and [[Star Energy]]'s [[Welton, Lincolnshire|Welton]] Gathering Centre (in Reepham) for the Welton oilfield (part of the [[East Midlands Oil Province]]). The Cherry Tree Cafe is at the [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1152043 junction]. It passes to the south of Sudbrooke Park (a Scout camp site), and [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2490373 crosses] the Lincoln to [[Grimsby]] railway in the parish of [[Barlings]], next to the ''Oriental Express Restaurant'' (former ''[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/421180 Station Inn]''). At [[Langworth]] there is a crossroads for [[Scothern]], to the left, and Barlings, to the right, and passes St Hugh's [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/93727 church] and the ''[http://www.the-george-inn.co.uk George Inn]''. It crosses the [[Barlings Eau]] at Langworth Bridge and there is a left turn for [[Stainton by Langworth]], and a right turn for [[Newball]], and the [[Woodside Wildlife and Falconry Park]].<ref>[http://www.woodsidefalconry.com Woodside Falconry]</ref>

Further on in the parish of Stainton by Langworth, near [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/329930 Rand Wood], the B1399 heads north-east while the A158 changes direction and heads east to [[Wragby]]. In [[Bullington, Lincolnshire|Bullington]] it passes [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/329961 Bullington Hall] and in [[Rand, Lincolnshire|Rand]], it passes Brown Cow Farm, and there is a left [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2668677 turn] for Rand and [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2511568 Rand Farm Park].<ref>[http://www.randfarmpark.com Rand Farm Park]</ref> The [[Rand Group]] construction company was [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/330001 based] there until October 2009 when it went into administration. It is briefly the parish boundary between Rand, to the north, and [[Goltho]], to the south, and [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/330027 passes] Goltho Gardens,<ref>[http://www.golthogardens.com Goltho Gardens]</ref> with a teashop. Approaching Wragby it enters [[East Lindsey]]. Here it [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2668679 crosses] the B1202 at traffic lights near the ''[http://www.turnorarmswragby.co.uk Turnor Arms]'' then forks with the [[A157 road|A157]] which heads through the [[Lincolnshire Wolds]] to [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]]. The A157 formerly followed the A158's current route to Lincoln, and the A158's western terminus was at Wragby before the 1940s. It passes the parish church of All Saints, and crosses the former [[Louth to Bardney Line]]. From here the route gets quite twisty then heads south east around the south end of the Wolds. It crosses Stainfield Back at [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/330131 Langton Bridge], and passes through [[Langton by Wragby]], where there is a left turn on a bend for [[Panton, Lincolnshire|Panton]], then a right turn on a bend for Chambers Farm Wood,<ref>[http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/EnglandLincolnshireNoForestChambersFarmWood Chambers Farm Wood]</ref> part of the [[Lincolnshire Limewoods]] nature reserve.<ref>[http://microsites.lincolnshire.gov.uk/limewoods/about/limewoods-project/partners/ Lincolnshire Limewoods]</ref> At [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/390505 Hatton Bridge], it is the parish boundary between Langton by Wragby, to the west and [[Hatton, Lincolnshire|Hatton]], to the east.

There are [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2534096 crossroads] for Hatton, to the left, and another crossroads at the (unoccupied) ''[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/390517 New Midge Inn]'', where the road becomes the parish boundary with [[Minting]] to the south. At [[Baumber]] the B1225 joins from the north as the A158 continues towards in a more southerly direction towards the town of [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]]. The B1190 and B1191 both join just outside Horncastle where the road crosses the [[A153 road|A153]].

==Horncastle to Skegness==
[[File:The George and Dragon, Hagworthingham - geograph.org.uk - 1316704.jpg|thumb|left|The A158 in [[Hagworthingham]]]]
After leaving Horncastle the route heads east with the B1195 heading off {{convert|2.6|mi}} later to [[Spilsby]]. Further on the road passes through the village of Hagworthingham. The road then reaches a roundabout with the [[A16 road (England)|A16]] at [[Partney]]. Both roads used to go through Partney but now bypass it. The construction of this bypass was preceded by a significant archaeological investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archsearch/record.jsf |title=Land at Partney bypass |publisher=Archaeology Data Service |date=2005 |accessdate=2013-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Archaeological Excavations Along the Partney By-pass, Lincolnshire (a16/a158) |first1=Robert |last1=Atkins |first2=Elizabeth Shepherd |last2=Popescu |first3=Jon (ill.) |last3=Cane |isbn=978-1904452171 |publisher=Cambridge county council |date=2005-08 |accessdate=2013-04-04}}</ref>The A158 continues east until reaching another roundabout with the [[A1028 road|A1028]] which provides a short cut from the A16 further north. The B1196 also heads up to [[Alford, Lincolnshire|Alford]] from here. The A158 becomes dual-carriageway for {{convert|1|mi}} from here until becoming single again through Gunby. The road then joins with the newly opened [[Burgh Bypass]], before finally reaching Skegness where it terminates at a junction with the [[A52 road|A52]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.1496|0.3395|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A158 road (eastern end)}}).}}
