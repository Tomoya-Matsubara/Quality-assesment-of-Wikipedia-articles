'''Chateau-sur-Mer''' is the first of the grand [[Bellevue Avenue Historic District|Bellevue Avenue]] [[mansion]] of the [[Gilded Age]] [[mansions]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. It is now open to the public as a [[museum]]. Chateau-sur-Mer's grand scale and lavish parties ushered in the Gilded Age of Newport, as it was the most palatial residence in Newport until the [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilt]] houses in the 1890s.

Chateau-sur-Mer was completed in 1852 as a French villa for [[William Shepard Wetmore]], a merchant in the [[China trade]], who was born on January 26, 1801, in [[St. Albans]] , [[Vermont]]. The builder was [[Seth Bradford]] and is a landmark of Victorian architecture, furniture, wallpapers, ceramics and stenciling. Mr. Wetmore died on June 16, 1862, at Chateau-sur-Mer, leaving the bulk of his fortune to his son, [[George Peabody Wetmore]] (later Governor of [[Rhode Island]] and a United States Senator), who married Edith Keteltas in 1869. During the 1870s, the Wetmores departed on an extended trip to Europe, leaving architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]] to remodel and redecorate the house in the [[Second Empire]] style. As a result, Chateau-sur-Mer displays most of the major design trends of the last half of the 19th century.

Unlike most of the "cottages" built in Newport during this period, Chateau-sur-Mer was one of the few built as a year round residence.  This was because the Wetmore's were a New England family who made Newport their home.

The house was added to the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Rhode Island|National Register of Historic Places]] in 1968 and purchased by the [[Preservation Society of Newport County]] in 1969. 

In March 2006, Kathleen Styger and Michelle Styger, as interns for the [[Preservation Society of Newport County]], conducted extensive research for descriptions on the interior of the Chateau-sur-Mer estate as part of the [[National Historic Landmark]] nomination submitted to the [[Department of Interior]] resulting in recognition as a National Historic Landmark.<ref>[http://www.salve.edu/salvetoday/archives/view_archive_public.cfm?archive_ID=1094 SALVEtoday "Wetmore Receives National Historic Landmark Designation" 16-Mar-06 ]</ref>

It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2006.<ref name="nhlsum"/><ref name="nrhpinv2">{{citation|title={{PDFlink|[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/68000002.pdf National Historic Landmark Nomination: Chateau-sur-Mer]|32&nbsp;KB}}|date=April 29, 2005 |author=John R.

The former carriage house and stables for the Chateau-Sur-Mer estate are owned by [[Salve Regina University]] and are currently being renovated as a center for visual art and cultural and historic preservation known as Wetmore Hall.
