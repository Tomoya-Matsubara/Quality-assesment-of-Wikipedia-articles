"'''Easy'''" is a song by English girl group [[Sugababes]] from their first [[compilation album]], ''[[Overloaded: The Singles Collection]]'' (2006). It was written by group members [[Keisha Buchanan]], [[Heidi Range]] and [[Amelle Berrabah]], in collaboration with Jason Pebworth and George Astasio of [[Orson (band)|Orson]]. The song was produced by Brio Taliaferro, Pebworth and Astasio. Sugababes collaborated with the members of Orson upon their learning of the group's greatest hits release. "Easy" was released as the lead single from the album on 6 November 2006, in both [[CD single]] and [[music download|digital download]] formats. "Easy" is an [[uptempo]] [[pop music|pop]] and [[electro (music)|electro]] song that features a prominent use of [[synthesizers]]. The song's lyrical content is metaphorical and features [[sex|sexual]] euphemisms.

Critical response for "Easy" was mixed. Some [[music journalism|music critics]] praised the song's lyrical content, as well as the incorporation of the bass synthesizer, while others criticized it as forgettable and inferior in comparison to the group's previous singles. The song achieved commercial success, where it reached the top five in Belgium and Slovakia, the top ten in the United Kingdom, and the top twenty in Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Norway. It also charted in other countries such as Austria, Germany, Hungary and Switzerland. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by Tim Royes and filmed in a public toilet at a club in [[Romford]]. It features the Sugababes dressed in [[latex clothing|latex outfits]], where they appear in separate toilet cubicles. The Sugababes have performed the song to promote the release of ''Overloaded: The Singles Collection''.

Buchanan described the song during an interview that was published on the group's official website, saying: "Easy is a very naughty and cheeky song <U+2013> it<U+2019>s the most sexy song we<U+2019>ve ever done. It came about when Orson had an idea for a song.  They played it to us <U+2013> it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it our own and the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love." She elaborated in a separate interview: "When we started working with the guys from Orson the sound just blew us away <U+2013> it's completely fresh sounding but at the same time has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!"<ref name="contactmusic"/>

Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a [[hand dryer]], which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively.
