'''Berg''' is a station on the [[Sognsvann Line]] (line 3) of the [[Oslo Metro]] of Norway. It is located between [[Ullev<U+00E5>l stadion (station)|Ullev<U+00E5>l stadion]] and [[T<U+00E5>sen (station)|T<U+00E5>sen]] and is the first station after [[Ring Line (Oslo)|Ring Line]] leaves the Sognsvann Line. The station is located {{Convert|6.1|km}} from [[Stortinget (station)|Stortinget]]. Berg is among the original stations on the line, and was opened 10 October 1934. It was upgraded and rebuilt in the 1990s, when the Sognsvann Line was upgraded to metro standard. There were plans making Berg a station on the [[Ring Line (Oslo)|Ring Line]], but research concluded that it would destroy the geography around Ullev<U+00E5>l and create noise pollution. Several accidents have taken place at Berg station, latest in 2008. The area around the station is mainly residential. [[Berg Upper Secondary School]] is located only 100 m from the station.

==History==
Berg station opened 10 October 1934, when the municipaly owned company [[Akersbanerne]] had built the line from [[Majorstuen (station)|Majorstuen]] to [[Sognsvann (station)|Sognsvann]].<ref name=Nilsen(1998)p133>{{Harvnb|Nilsen|1998|p=133}}</ref> residential areas at [[Sogn]], [[T<U+00E5>sen]] and [[Berg, Norway|Berg]] were starting to grow, in pace with a larger suburban development plan named Solgryten ({{lang-en|The Sun Pot}}).<ref name=HartmannMangset(2001)p19>{{Harvnb|Hartmann|Mangset|2001|p=19}}</ref> Akersbanerne bought new property along the line,<ref>{{cite journal|last=J<U+00F8>rgensen|first=Liv Hilt|title=Forstadsbaner og boligplaner i Oslo gjennom 150 <U+00E5>r|journal=Plan- og bygningsetaten|year=1999|month=April|accessdate=2 November 2010|language=Norwegian|ref=harv}}</ref> where new houses were to be drawn by the Norwegian architect [[Kristofer Lange]] (1886<U+2013>1977).<ref name=HartmannMangset(2001)p31>{{Harvnb|Hartmann|Mangset|2001|p=31}}</ref>

The line was in the first place double-tracked from Majorstuen to [[<U+00D8>sthorn (station)|<U+00D8>sthorn]] (then Korsvoll) and single-tracked to Sognsvann until 1939.<ref name=Nilsen(1998)p133 />

In the 1980s, Berg was rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the [[railway platform height|platform height]] increased. The third rail made it impossible to cross the lines at the stations, an underpass was therefore constructed Berg Station.<ref name=lt15/> The station was also rebuilt in the same architectural style as the other stations on the line. They are constructed in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds and fences,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Spennede arkitektur p<U+00E5> Sognsvannsveie |journal=[[Lokaltrafikk]] |year=1993 |volume=19 |pages=4<U+2013>9 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> with the sheds being drawn by [[Arne Henriksen]].<ref name=HartmannMangset(2001)p77>{{Harvnb|Hartmann|Mangset|2001|p=77}}</ref>

In 1991, Oslo Sporveier presented plans to make a ring line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital [[Rikshospitalet]].<ref name=aa250491>{{cite news |title=Ringbaneplan klar i april |last=Vatne |first=Paul Einar |work=[[Aftenposten Aften]] |date=25 March 1991 |page=21 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996.<ref name=aa060898>{{cite news|last=Breian|first=<U+00C5>shild|title=Planene om T-banering: Flertallet venter p<U+00E5> vurdering|newspaper=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|date=6 August 1998|page=7|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In the local newspaper ''[[Aftenposten Aften]]'' there was a debate ongoing whether there should be a ring line from Berg along Ring 3 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet,<ref name=aa160496>{{cite news|last=Hoel|first=Erik|title=Un<U+00F8>dvendig trikkestrid|newspaper=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|date=16 March 1996|page=2|language=Norwegian}}</ref> or that the [[Ullev<U+00E5>l Hageby Line]] should be extended from [[John Colletts plass (station)|John Colletts plass]] to [[Rikshospitalet (station)|Rikshospitalet]], thus creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station [[Forskningsparken (station)|Forskningsparken]].<ref name=aa010695>{{cite news|last=Hoel|first=Erik|title=Forslag til annen trase|newspaper=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|date=1 June 1995|page=2|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In the first plans, Berg was meant to be a station on the new ring line, but was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns.<ref name=aa160295>{{cite news|last=Bj<U+00F8>rkeng|first=Ingrid|title=Berg-beboere i harnisk over ny T-banering|newspaper=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|date=16 February 1995|page=5|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Noise shields were however put op along the line.<ref name=aa050896>{{cite news |url= |title=Ring klar <U+00E5>r 2000 Akerselva m<U+00E5> flyttes |last=Voll |first=Kristin |work=[[Aftenposten Aften]] |date=5 August 1996 |page=6 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=aa170495>{{cite news|last=Sol<U+00F8>y|first=Margrethe|title=T-banering til 460 mill.|newspaper=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|date=17 March 1995|page=5|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Berg station has seen many accidents and almost-accidents. In 1965, a deadly accident occurred between Ullev<U+00E5>l and Berg stations, where a train whose driver did not see a 33-year-old man walking in the tracks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mann drept av Sognsvannstrikken|newspaper=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=10 May 1965|page=5|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 2002, a 24 years old man was run over by a [[Oslo Metro rolling stock|metro train]] approaching the station.<ref name=am020102>{{cite news|title=P<U+00E5>kj<U+00F8>rt av T-banen|newspaper=[[Aftenposten Morgen]]|date=2 January 2002|page=18|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The man survived the accident with minor wounds.<ref name=am020102/> In 2008, a 21 years old drunk man was found crawling around on the tracks between the platforms.<ref name=aa111208>{{cite news|title=Blodspor f<U+00F8>rte til|newspaper=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|date=11 December 2008|page=12|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The police removed him from the station after short time and sent him home in a taxi.<ref name=aa111208/>
