The '''Boston and Maine Railroad''' {{reporting mark|BM}}, also known by the abbreviation '''B&M''', was the dominant [[railroad]] of the northern [[New England]] region of the [[United States]] for a century. It is now part of the [[Pan Am Railways]] network.

==History==
The '''Andover and Wilmington Railroad''' was incorporated [[March 15]], [[1833]] to build a branch from the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]] at [[Wilmington, Massachusetts]] north to [[Andover (MA)|Andover]]. The line opened to Andover on [[August 8]], [[1836]]. The name was changed to the '''Andover and Haverhill Railroad''' on [[April 18]], [[1837]], reflecting plans to build further to [[Haverhill (MA)|Haverhill]] (opened later that year), and yet further to [[Portland, Maine]] with the renaming to the '''Boston and Portland Railroad''' on [[April 3]], [[1839]], opening to the New Hampshire state line in [[1840]].

The '''Boston and Maine Railroad''' was chartered in [[New Hampshire]] on [[June 27]], [[1835]], and the '''Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts Railroad''' was incorporated [[March 12]], [[1839]] in [[Maine]], both companies continuing the proposed line to [[South Berwick, Maine]]. The railroad opened in [[1840]] to [[Exeter, New Hampshire]], and on [[January 1]], [[1842]] the two companies merged with the Boston and Portland to form a new Boston and Maine Railroad.

On [[February 23]], [[1843]] the B&M opened to [[Agamenticus, Maine|Agamenticus]], on the line of the [[Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroad]] in South Berwick. On [[January 28]] of that year the B&M and [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] came to an agreement to both lease the PS&P as a joint line to [[Portland (ME)|Portland]].

The '''Boston and Maine Extension Railroad''' was incorporated [[March 16]], [[1844]], due to a dispute with the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]] over [[trackage rights]] rates between Wilmington and Boston. That company was merged into the main B&M on [[March 19]], [[1845]], and opened [[July 1]], leading to the abandonment of the old connection to the B&L (later reused by the B&L for their [[Wildcat Branch]]). In [[1848]] another original section was abandoned, as a new alignment was built from Wilmington north to [[North Andover (MA)|North Andover]] in order to better serve [[Lawrence (MA)|Lawrence]].

A new alignment to Portland opened in [[1873]], splitting from the old route at [[South Berwick (ME)|South Berwick]]. The old route was later abandoned.

As the B&M grew, it also gained control of its former rivals. These acquisitions included the following:

;Eastern
The [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] was leased by the B&M on [[December 23]], [[1883]]. This provided a second route to Maine, as well as many local branches, ending competition along the immediate route between Boston and Portland.

;Worcester, Nashua and Portland
The [[Worcester and Nashua Railroad]] was organized in [[1845]] (opened [[1848]]) and the [[Nashua and Rochester Railroad]] in [[1847]], forming a line between [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] and [[Rochester, New Hampshire]] via [[Nashua (NH)|Nashua]]. The W&N leased the N&R in [[1874]], and the two companies merged into the [[Worcester, Nashua and Rochester Railroad]] in [[1883]]. The B&M leased the line on [[January 1]], [[1886]]. This acquisition also included the continuation from Rochester to [[Portland, Maine]], incorporated in [[1846]] as the [[York and Cumberland Railroad (Maine)|York and Cumberland Railroad]]. It opened partially in [[1851]] and [[1853]], was reorganized as the [[Portland and Rochester Railroad]] in [[1867]], and opened the rest of the way in [[1871]]. It was again reorganized in [[1881]] and then operated in conjunction with the line to Worcester.

;Boston and Lowell
On [[April 1]], [[1887]] the B&M leased the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]], adding not only trackage in the [[Boston (MA)|Boston]] area, but also the [[Central Massachusetts Railroad]] west to [[Northampton (MA)|Northampton]], the [[Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad]] into northern [[New Hampshire]], the [[St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad]] to northwestern [[Vermont]], and the [[Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad]] from [[White River Junction (VT)|White River Junction]] into [[Quebec]]. However, the BC&M was separated in [[1889]] and merged with the [[Concord Railroad]] to form the [[Concord and Montreal Railroad]], which the B&M leased on [[April 1]], [[1895]], gaining the Concord Railroad's direct line between [[Nashua (NH)|Nashua]] and [[Concord (NH)|Concord]]. Additionally, the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad, owned by the B&M through stock, was leased to the [[Maine Central Railroad]] by [[1912]]. The [[Central Massachusetts Railroad]] stayed a part of the B&M, as did the [[Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad]] (as the Passumpsic Division).

;Northern
The [[Northern Railroad (New Hampshire)|Northern Railroad]] was leased to the Boston and Lowell in [[1884]], but that lease was cancelled and the Northern was on its own until [[1890]], when it was released to the B&L, then part of the B&M. The Northern owned a number of lines running west from [[Concord (NH)|Concord]].

;Connecticut River
On [[January 1]], [[1893]], the B&M leased the [[Connecticut River Railroad]], with a main line from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] north along the [[Conencticut River]] to [[White River Junction, Vermont]], where the [[Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad]] (acquired in [[1887]]) continued north.

;Concord and Montreal
As discussed above, the B&M acquired the [[Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad]] in [[1887]], but gave it up in [[1889]], allowing it to merge with the [[Concord Railroad]] to form the [[Concord and Montreal Railroad]]. That company did poorly on its own, and was leased by the B&M on [[April 1]], [[1895]], giving the B&M the majority of lines in [[New Hampshire]].

;Fitchburg
The B&M leased the [[Fitchburg Railroad]] on [[July 1]], [[1900]]. This was primarily a main line from Boston west via the [[Hoosac Tunnel]] to the [[Albany, New York]] area, with various branches.

----

At one point, the B&M also owned a majority of stock of the [[Maine Central Railroad]], stretching from [[Quebec]] via northern [[New Hampshire]] to southern and eastern [[Maine]].

The B&M flourished with the growth of New England's mill towns in the late [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th centuries]], but still faced financial struggles. It came under the control of [[J. P. Morgan]] and his [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] around [[1910]], but anti-trust forces wrested control back. Later it faced heavy debt problems from track construction and from the cost of acquiring the [[Fitchburg Railroad]], causing a reorganization in [[1919]]. [[Image:Boston_and_maine_railroad_mcginnis_herald.jpg|thumb|left|B&M "McGinnis" Herald.]]

Beginning in the [[1930s]], freight business was hurt by the leveling off of New England manufacturing growth, and by new competition from trucking.

The popularization of the [[automobile]] doomed B&M as a passenger carrier. It gave up on long distance [[passenger train|passenger service]] by [[1965]] and was able to continue Boston commuter service only by the aid of subsidies from the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]].  In [[1973]] the MBTA bought the [[rolling stock]] and tracks near [[Boston]] from the ailing B&M. The B&M filed for bankruptcy in December [[1970]]. During bankruptcy, the B&M reorganized, leasing new locomotives, rolling stock, and securing funds to upgrade its track and signal systems. It limped along through the 1970s, and reportedly was on the brink of liquidation during 1973-1974. The B&M was offered to merge its properties into the new [[Conrail]] but opted out. Finally, in 1983 the B&M emerged from bankruptcy when it was purchased by Timothy Mellon's [[Guilford Transportation Industries]] for $24&nbsp;million.
 


==Branches==
In addition to the major systems described above, the B&M also built or leased many shorter lines.

;Medford
The [[Medford Branch Railroad]] was incorporated in [[1845]] and absorbed by the B&M in [[1846]], opening in [[1847]]. It provided a short connection from [[Medford Junction]] to [[Medford (MA)|Medford]] center, which the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]] had bypassed.

;Saugus
The [[Saugus Branch Railroad]] was incorporated in [[1848]], opening in [[1853]] as a branch from the B&M at [[Edgeworth, Massachusetts|Edgeworth]] to [[Lynn (MA)|Lynn]] via [[Saugus (MA)|Saugus]]. The [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] bought the line soon after and cut the connection to the B&M in [[1855]], connecting it instead to their new main line (the [[Grand Junction Railroad]]) at [[Everett Junction]].

;Newburyport
The [[Newburyport Railroad]] was incorporated in [[1846]]. It opened from [[Newburyport (MA)|Newburyport]] on the [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] to [[Georgetown (MA)|Georgetown]] in [[1849]] and [[1850]], and west to the B&M at [[Bradford, Massachusetts|Bradford]] in [[1851]]. The [[Danvers and Georgetown Railroad]] was organized in [[1851]] and opened in [[1853]], running from the Newburyport Railroad at Georgetown south to [[Danvers (MA)|Danvers]] on the [[Essex Branch Railroad]]. Finally, the [[Danvers Railroad]] was incorporated in [[1852]] and opened in [[1855]], continuing the line from Danvers southwest to the B&M in [[Wakefield (MA)|Wakefield]]. The first two companies merged in [[1855]] to form a new [[Newburyport Railroad]]. The B&M leased the Danvers Railroad in [[1853]], and the combined Newburyport Railroad in [[1860]], making the line from Wakefield to Newburyport the main line and the old line to Bradford a branch.

;Lowell
The [[Lowell and Andover Railroad]] was organized in [[1873]], after the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]]'s monopoly on Boston-Lowell service ended, and the line opened in [[1874]] from the B&M at [[Lowell Junction]] in [[Andover (MA)|Andover]] west to [[Lowell (MA)|Lowell]], immediately being leased to the B&M.

;Methuen/Manchester
The [[Methuen Branch Railroad]] from the B&M in [[Lawrence (MA)|Lawrence]] through [[Methuen (MA)|Methuen]] to the [[New Hampshire]] state line opened in [[1849]]. Concurrently, the [[Manchester and Lawrence Railroad]] was chartered in [[1847]] and opened in [[1849]], continuing the line in New Hampshire to [[Manchester (NH)|Manchester]]. The company leased the Methuen Branch, and leased itself to the [[Concord Railroad]] in [[1850]]. That contract was terminated, and the B&M leased the line in [[1887]].

;Merrimac
The [[West Amesbury Branch Railroad]] was organized in [[1868]] and opened in [[1873]], branching from the B&M at [[Newton Junction]] in [[New Hampshire]] to [[Merrimac, Massachusetts]] (originally West Amesbury). The B&M immediately leased it.

;Alton Bay
The [[Cocheco Railroad]] was chartered in [[1847]] and opened in [[1849]] and [[1851]], running from the B&M in [[Dover (NH)|Dover]] to [[Alton, New Hampshire|Alton Bay, New Hampshire]]. It was reorganized in [[1863]] as the [[Dover and Winnipiseogee Railroad]] and leased to the B&M. When the B&M leased the [[Concord and Montreal Railroad]] in [[1895]], it acquired the [[Lake Shore Railroad]], a continuation past Alton Bay to the old [[Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad]] mainline at [[Lakeport, New Hampshire|Lakeport]].

;Somersworth
The [[Somersworth Branch]], originally the Great Falls Branch, connected the main line at [[Rollinsford, New Hampshire]] to [[Somersworth (NH)|Somersworth]], where the [[Great Falls and Conway Railroad]] (later part of the [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] system) continued north.

;Kennebunkport
The [[Kennebunk and Kennebunkport Railroad]] was organized in [[1882]] and opened in [[1883]] as a branch of the B&M at [[Kennebunk, Maine]] to [[Kennebunkport (ME)|Kennebunkport]]. It was immediately leased by the B&M.

;Orchard Beach
The [[Orchard Beach Railroad]] was incorporated in [[1876]] as a branch from the B&M in [[Old Orchard Beach (ME)|Old Orchard Beach]] to [[Camp Ellis, Maine|Camp Ellis]] on the [[Saco River]]. It opened in [[1880]] and the B&M bought it in [[1893]].
