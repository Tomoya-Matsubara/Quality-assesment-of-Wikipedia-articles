"'''Back Off Boogaloo'''" is a song by English musician [[Ringo Starr]], released as a non-album single in March 1972. Starr's former [[The Beatles|Beatles]] bandmate [[George Harrison]] produced the recording, which took place in London shortly after the two had appeared together at Harrison's [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] shows in August 1971. The single was a follow-up to Starr's 1971 hit song "[[It Don't Come Easy]]" and continued his successful run as a solo artist. "Back Off Boogaloo" reached number 2 in Britain <U+2013> his highest charting single there <U+2013> and number 9 in the United States.

The title for the song was inspired by English singer-songwriter [[Marc Bolan]]. Some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at [[Paul McCartney]], reflecting Starr's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years. "Back Off Boogaloo" demonstrates the influence of [[glam rock]] on Starr, who directed a documentary film, ''[[Born to Boogie]]'' (1972), about Bolan's band [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] around this time. Described by one author as a "high-energy in-your-face rocker<U+201D>,<ref name="Spizer p 297" /> the song features a prominent [[slide guitar]] part by Harrison and contributions from musicians [[Gary Wright]] and [[Klaus Voormann]].

Starr re-recorded "Back Off Boogaloo" for his 1981 album ''[[Stop and Smell the Roses]]'', in a collaboration with American singer [[Harry Nilsson]] that incorporates lyrics from Beatles songs such as "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]", "[[Good Day Sunshine]]" and "[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]". The original version has appeared on Starr's compilation albums ''[[Blast from Your Past]]'' and ''[[Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr]]'', and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album ''[[Goodnight Vienna]]''. Since his return to touring in 1989, Starr has performed "Back Off Boogaloo" regularly in concert with the various incarnations of his [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]].

==Background and composition==
[[Ringo Starr]] identified his initial inspiration for "Back Off Boogaloo" as having come from [[Marc Bolan]],<ref name="Rodriguez p 93">Rodriguez, p. 93.</ref> the singer and guitarist with English [[glam rock]] band [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref name="Doggett p 192" /> Over dinner one evening, Bolan had used the word "boogaloo" so often that it stuck in Starr's mind, after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight.<ref name="Rodriguez p 32">Rodriguez, p. 32.</ref> When discussing the composition on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'' in May 1998, Starr explained: "[Bolan] was an energised guy. He used to speak: 'Back off boogaloo ... ooh you, boogaloo.' 'Do you want some potatoes?' 'Ooh you, boogaloo!'"<ref name="Badman p 69">Badman, p. 69.</ref>

The lyrics to the song's [[middle eight]] came to Starr while watching [[London Weekend Television]]'s football show, ''[[The Big Match]]''.<ref name="Badman p 69" /> The program's host, [[Jimmy Hill]], often referred to a footballer's playing as "tasty",<ref name="Badman p 69" /> a catchphrase that Starr incorporated into his song lyrics:<ref name="Clayson p 223">Clayson, p. 223.</ref>

{{bquote|''Get yourself together now <br> And give me something tasty <br> Everything you try to do <br> You know it sure sounds wasted.''}}

Commentators have interpreted the song, and particularly this statement, as an attack on Starr's former [[The Beatles|Beatles]] bandmate [[Paul McCartney]].<ref name="Doggett p 192">Doggett, p. 192.</ref><ref name="Clayson p 223" /> Starr has denied any such interpretation, Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez writes, instead "claiming that the song was inspired by Bolan and nothing more".<ref name="Rodriguez pp 32, 34" /> Starr had publicly criticised McCartney's solo albums ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'' (1970) and ''[[Ram (album)|Ram]]'' (1971) on release,<ref name="Rodriguez p 32" /> and author [[Bruce Spizer]] paraphrases the message of the middle eight as "a plea for Paul to produce better music".<ref name="Spizer p 297">Spizer, p. 297.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Speaking to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in July 1971,<ref>Badman, p. 39.</ref> Starr said of McCartney's songwriting: "He disappoints me on his albums. I don't think there's one [good] tune on the last one ... It's like he's not admitting that he can write great tunes."<ref>Doggett, pp. 176<U+2013>77.</ref>}} The mention of "''sound[ing] wasted''" could also be a reference to McCartney's overindulgence with [[cannabis]], Rodriguez suggests.<ref name="Rodriguez p 32" /> A further example of Starr's allegedly anti-McCartney message exists in the song's first verse:<ref name="Spizer p 297" /><ref name="Rodriguez p 32" />

{{bquote|''Wake up, meathead <br> Don't pretend that you are dead <br> Get yourself up off the cart.''}}

The same commentators suggest that here Starr could be referring to the 1969 "[[Paul is dead|Paul Is Dead]]" hoax.<ref name="Spizer p 297" /><ref name="Rodriguez p 32" /> The latter rumour circulated during September and October of that year while McCartney hid away on his Scottish farm,<ref>Schaffner, pp. 127<U+2013>28.</ref> disconsolate after [[John Lennon]] had told him and Starr that he wanted a "divorce" from the Beatles.<ref>Sounes, pp. 261<U+2013>63.</ref>

In addition to these supposed messages in "Back Off Boogaloo", observers have viewed the song title as Starr's rebuke to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and [[Apple Corps]],<ref name="Rodriguez p 32" /> which was placed in [[receivership]] in March 1971 after a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge found in McCartney's favour.<ref>Doggett, pp. 162<U+2013>63.</ref> Author Keith Badman writes that "Boogaloo" had "long been cited as Paul's nickname from the other Beatles".<ref name="Badman p 69" /> While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr "would have had his reasons not to reinforce any ongoing negativity" towards McCartney, Rodriguez notes that the lyrics "just happened to fit perfectly into the 'us vs. Paul' mindset" following [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]], to the extent that "Back Off Boogaloo" was "as damning as '[[Early 1970]]' had been conciliatory".<ref name="Rodriguez pp 32, 34">Rodriguez, pp. 32, 34.</ref>

Although "T Rex devotees", in the words of Starr biographer Alan Clayson, claimed that Bolan had [[Ghostwriter|ghost-written]] "Back Off Boogaloo",<ref name="Clayson p 224">Clayson, p. 224.</ref> Starr later acknowledged that Harrison co-wrote the song<ref name="Spizer p 297" /><ref name="Madinger & Easter p 500">Madinger & Easter, p. 500.</ref> by adding some chords and finishing the melody.<ref name="Rodriguez p 32" /> As on Starr's 1971 hit single "[[It Don't Come Easy]]", Harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution.<ref>Spizer, pp. 293, 297.</ref> Starr originally offered the song to fellow Liverpudlian [[Cilla Black]] to record, but she declined,<ref>Harry, p. 87.</ref> hoping instead to record another new Starr<U+2013>Harrison composition, "[[Photograph (Ringo Starr song)|Photograph]]".<ref>Clayson, p. 216.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Harrison subsequently offered Black "[[When Every Song Is Sung]]" and produced her recording of the song in August 1972,<ref>Badman, p. 79.</ref> with Starr playing drums on the session.<ref>Madinger & Easter, p. 440.</ref> Intended as a single, Black's version was never released, and Starr recorded the song, as "I'll Still Love You", for his 1976 album ''[[Ringo's Rotogravure]]''.<ref>Clayson, p. 266.</ref>}}

Rodriguez describes Starr's "martial-sounding opening" as a rare "showcase for his own drumming",<ref name="Rodriguez p 32" /> while Harrison biographer Simon Leng writes of "a roaring series of Harrison [[Slide guitar|slide]] breaks that brought to mind [[Duane Allman]]".<ref name="Leng p 123">Leng, p. 123.</ref> Further [[Overdubbing|overdubs]] included contributions from three backing vocalists,<ref name="C&P p 209" /> led by American [[Soul music|soul]] singer [[Madeline Bell]].<ref name="Spizer pp 297-98" />

==="Blindman"===
For the single's [[B-side]], Starr had already written and recorded "Blindman", the theme song for the Ferdinando Baldi-directed [[Spaghetti Western]] of [[Blindman|the same name]],<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 499">Madinger & Easter, p. 499.</ref> filming for which Starr had interrupted in order to perform at the Concert for Bangladesh.<ref>Tillery, p. 97.</ref> Starr produced the track with Voormann.<ref>Castleman & Podrazik, p. 112.</ref> The sessions for "Blindman" took place at Apple on 18<U+2013>19 August,<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 499" /> with [[Badfinger]] guitarist [[Pete Ham]] assisting Starr and Voormann.<ref name="Spizer p 298">Spizer, p. 298.</ref> Like the film ''Blindman'' (1971), the song is held in low regard by critics;<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 499" /> Spizer describes it as "a muddy-sounding dirge with little to recommend".<ref name="Spizer p 298" />

==Release and reception==
[[Apple Records]] issued the single on 17 March 1972 in Britain, as Apple R 5944, with a US release taking place three days later, as Apple 1849.<ref>Harry, pp. 14, 182, 183.</ref> It was Starr's first release since "It Don't Come Easy", a year before.<ref name="Spizer p 297" /> During this period, his priority had been to develop a career as an actor<ref>Woffinden, pp. 47, 68.</ref> in films such as ''[[200 Motels]]'' (1971) and ''Blindman''.<ref>Rodriguez, p. 42.</ref> Further aligning himself with Britain's glam rock movement, Starr made his directorial debut with ''[[Born to Boogie]]'' (1972),<ref name="Clayson p 225">Clayson, p. 225.</ref> a film starring Bolan that included Starr's footage of a T. Rex concert held at [[Wembley Arena|Wembley]] on 18 March.<ref name="Badman p 69" />{{refn|group=nb|Starr continued to pursue his acting career through to the end of 1972,<ref>Badman, pp. 79, 84, 85.</ref> with starring roles in ''Count Downe'', released in 1974 as ''[[Son of Dracula (1974 film)|Son of Dracula]]'', and ''[[That'll Be the Day (film)|That'll Be the Day]]'' (1973).<ref>Schaffner, p. 163.</ref>}} With "Back Off Boogaloo", ''[[NME]]'' critic [[Bob Woffinden]] noted Starr's success in establishing himself in the two years since the Beatles' break-up, and wrote that the single "confirmed that he and Harrison, dark horses both, were the ones who had managed their solo careers more purposefully and intelligently" compared with McCartney and [[John Lennon]].<ref name="Woffinden p 68">Woffinden, p. 68.</ref>

The song was a hit in the US, reaching number 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name="US Billboard chart">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ringo-starr-mn0000217792/awards |title=Ringo Starr <U+2013> Awards |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> and achieved Starr's best position on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref>Rodriguez, p. 33.</ref> where it reached number 2.<ref name="UK chart">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/ringo%20starr/ |title=Ringo Starr &#124; Artist |publisher=Official Charts Company |date= |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> A [[Music video|promotional video]] for "Back Off Boogaloo" was shot on 20 March<ref>Harry, p. 116.</ref> at Lennon's [[Tittenhurst Park]] residence while Starr was looking after the property.<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 500" /> The video, which shows Starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-like monster]], was directed by Tom Taylor and financed by Caravel Films.<ref name="Badman p 69" /> A similar monster appeared on the single's picture sleeve, holding a cigarette.<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 500" />{{refn|group=nb|Spizer writes that Apple "couldn't resist making a pun" out of this image and took out a back-cover advertisement in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine headed by the tagline "Another Monster from Apple".<ref>Spizer, pp. 298, 301.</ref>}}

Alan Clayson writes of reviewers criticising "Back Off Boogaloo" for being repetitious, leading Starr to respond to one interviewer: "Play me a pop song that isn't."<ref name="Clayson p 223" /> Woffinden described the single as "every bit as ebullient" as "It Don't Come Easy", although "slightly inferior",<ref name="Woffinden p 68" /> while Mike DeGagne of [[Allmusic]] views it as a song where "[t]he jovial spirit of Ringo Starr shines through<U+201D>.<ref>Mike DeGagne, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/blast-from-your-past-mw0000198054 "Ringo Starr ''Blast from Your Past''"], [[Allmusic]] (retrieved 6 July 2013).</ref> Among Beatle biographers, Simon Leng terms it "a rocking, soccer crowd chant that suited Starr<U+2019>s talents well",<ref name="Leng p 123" /> and Bruce Spizer praises the track as a "high-energy in-your-face rocker propelled by Ringo<U+2019>s thundering drums and George<U+2019>s stinging slide guitar<U+201D>.<ref name="Spizer p 297" />
