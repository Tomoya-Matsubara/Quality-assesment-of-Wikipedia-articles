'''St George's Hall''' is on [[Lime Street, Liverpool|Lime Street]] in the centre of the English city of [[Liverpool]], opposite [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street railway station]] ({{gbmapping|SJ349907}}).  It is a building in [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style which contains concert halls and law courts, and is a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=359391 |title=Images of England: St George's Hall, Liverpool |accessdate=2008-03-26 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>  On the east side of the hall, between it and the railway station is St George's Plateau and on the west side are [[St John's Gardens]].  The hall is included in the [[William Brown Street]] conservation area.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Images/tcm21-56863.pdf |title=The City of Liverpool Conservation Areas |accessdate=2008-03-26 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format=pdf |work= |publisher=[[City of Liverpool]] |pages= }}</ref>  In 1969 [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] expressed his opinion that it is one of the finest [[Greek Revival|neo-Grecian]] buildings in the world<ref>Quoted in Sharples and Pollard, p. 247.</ref> although the building is notable for its use of [[Roman architecture|Roman]] sources as well as Greek ones.   In 2004 the hall and its surrounding area were recognised as part of [[Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City|Liverpool's World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{citation  |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1150 |title=Liverpool <U+2013> Maritime Mercantile City |accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] }}</ref>

==History==

The site of the hall was formerly occupied by the first [[Liverpool Infirmary]] from 1749 to 1824.  Triennial music festivals were held in the city but there was no suitable hall to accommodate them.<ref name=bbchist>{{citation  |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/culture/2002/08/st_georges/history.shtml |title=History of the Hall |accessdate=2008-03-26 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref>  Following a public meeting in 1836 a company was formed to raise subscriptions for a hall in Liverpool to be used for the festivals, and for meetings, dinners and concerts.<ref>Sharples and Pollard, p. 291.</ref>  Shares were made available at <U+00A3>25 each and by January 1837 <U+00A3>23,350 had been raised. In 1838 the [[cornerstone|foundation stone]] was laid to commemorate the [[coronation]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].<ref name=bbchist/>  A competition in 1839 to design the hall was won by [[Harvey Lonsdale Elmes]], a London architect aged 25 years.  There was a need for assize courts in the city and a competition to design these was also won by Elmes.  The original plan was to have separate buildings but in 1840 Elmes suggested that both functions could be combined in one building on a scale which would surpass most of the other public buildings in the country at the time.  Construction started in 1841, the building opened in 1854 (with the small concert room opening two years later).  Elmes died in 1847 and the work was continued by John Weightman, Corporation Surveyor, and [[Robert Rawlinson]], structural engineer, until in 1851 Sir [[Charles Robert Cockerell|Charles Cockerell]] was appointed architect.  Cockerell was largely responsible for the decoration of the interiors.<ref>Sharples and Pollard, pp. 291, 293.</ref>  During the 2000s a major restoration of the hall took place costing <U+00A3>23m and it was officially reopened on [[23 April]] [[2007]] by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|HRH Prince of Wales]].<ref name=merseyp/>

==Structure==
===Plan===

The Concert Hall is the largest area, rectangular in shape, and occupies the centre of the building with an organ on its north wall.  To the north of the Concert Hall is the Civil Court and beyond this is the elliptical Small Concert Room.  To the south of the Concert Hall are the Crown Court and the Grand Jury Room.  Smaller court rooms are on the periphery of the larger courts.<ref>Sharples and Pollard, p. 292.</ref>  The floor below consists of a cavernous basement with cells for prisoners along the west wall.<ref name=pp297>Sharples and Pollard, p. 297.</ref>
[[Image:St George's Hall, Liverpool.JPG|200px|thumb|left|East front of St George's Hall]]

===Exterior===

The main entrance is in the centre of the east fa<U+00E7>ade and is approached by a wide flight of steps.<ref name=pp294/>  On the steps is a statue of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] by C. B. Birch.<ref name=pp297/>  This front has a central [[portico]] of 16 [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns flanked on each side by series of square, unfluted pillars.  Between these pillars are [[relief]]s which were added between 1882 and 1901 by Thomas Stirling Lee, [[C.J. Allen|C. J. Allen]] and [[Conrad Dressler]].  The west front has a projecting central part with square pillars supporting a massive [[entablature]].  The south front has a portico of eight columns, two columns deep on steps above a [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] [[podium]].  The north front has a semicircular [[apse]] with columns and three doorways which are flanked by statues of [[nereids]] and [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]] bearing lamps which were designed by Nicholl.<ref name=pp294>Sharples and Pollard, p. 294.</ref>

===Interior===

The main entrance crosses a corridor and leads into the Concert Hall. This measures {{convert|169|ft|m|0}} by {{convert|77|ft|m|0}} and is {{convert|82|ft|m|0}} high.  The roof is a [[Barrel vault|tunnel vault]] carried on columns of polished red [[granite]].  The walls have [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] for statues and the panelled plasterwork of the vault has [[allegory|allegorical]] figures of Virtues, Science and Arts.  The highly decorated floor consists of [[Mintons Ltd|Minton]] tiles and it is usually covered by a removable floor to protect it.<ref name=pp295-6/>  It contains over 30,000 tiles.<ref name=bbcfacts/>  The doors are [[bronze]] and have openwork panels which incorporate the letters SPQL (the Senate and the People of Liverpool) making an association with the [[SPQR]] badge of ancient [[Roman Republic|Rome]].  The organ is at the north end and at the south end is a round arch supporting an entablature between whose columns is a gate leading directly into the Crown Court.  The niches contain the statues of [[William Roscoe]] by [[Francis Legatt Chantrey|Chantrey]], [[Sir William Brown, 1st Baronet, of Astrop|Sir William Brown]] by [[Patrick MacDowell]], [[Robert Peel]] by [[Matthew Noble]], [[George Stephenson]] by [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]], [[Hugh McNeile|Rev. Hugh Boyd McNeile]] by [[George Gamon Adams]], E. Whitley by A. Bruce Joy, S. R. Graves by G. G. Fontana, Rev Jonathan Brookes by B. E. Spence, [[William Gladstone]] by John Adams-Acton, the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|14th Earl of Derby]] by [[William Theed|William Theed the Younger]], the [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|16th Earl of Derby]] by [[F. W. Pomeroy]], and Joseph Mayer by Fontana.  The stained glass in the semicircular windows at each end of the hall was added in 1883&ndash;84 by Forrest and Son of Liverpool.  Sharples and Pollard regard this as "one of the greatest [[Victorian era|Victorian]] interiors".<ref name=pp295-6>Sharples and Pollard, pp. 295&ndash;296.</ref>
[[Image:StGeorgesHallLiverpool.jpg|200px|thumb|South side of St George's Hall]]
The Crown Court has a tunnel vault on red granite columns and the Civil Court a [[Molding (decorative)|coved]] ceiling on grey granite columns.  The south entrance is approached through the portico, is low and has [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns.  Below this is a larger vaulted space which was adapted to form a new entrance in 2003&ndash;05.  The north entrance hall has [[Doric order|Doric]] columns on its landing and a Doric ambulatory around the apse.  A copy of part of the [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze]] runs round its walls.  In the entrance is a statue of [[Henry Booth]] by Theed the Younger.  The Small Concert Room is almost circular and is lavishly decorated.<ref name=pp296-7>Sharples and Pollard, pp. 296&ndash;297.</ref>  In the past it was known as the Golden Concert Room and it was regularly host to [[Charles Dickens]] who held many of his readings there.<ref name=rlps/>  A balcony supported by [[caryatid]]s runs round the room.  At the back of the platform are attached columns, decorated with [[arabesque]]s, supporting a [[frieze]] with [[griffin]]s and between the columns are mirrors.<ref name=pp296-7/>  The concert room was refurbished between 2000 and 2007.  This included making alterations to comply with the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|Disability Discrimination Act]], restoring the historical painting scheme and restoring the [[chandelier]], which consists of 2,824 crystal pieces.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.wmf.org.uk/projects/view/stgeorge_hall/overview |title=St George's Hall, Liverpool |accessdate=2008-03-26 |publisher=World Monuments Fund Britain }}</ref>  It has seating for an audience of 480.<ref name=rlps>{{citation  |url=http://www.liverpoolphil.com/content/AbouttheHall/StGeorgesHallConcertRoom.aspx |title=St George's Hall, Concert Room |accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=Royal Liverpool Philharmonic }}</ref>

In the basement is part of a unique heating and ventilation system devised by Dr Boswell Reid.<ref name=pp297/>  This was the first attempt at air conditioning in a public building in the United Kingdom, its aim being to warm and ventilate the building without draughts.  Air was warmed by five hot water pipes which were heated by two coke-fired boilers and two steam boilers.  The air was circulated by four {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} wide fans.  It was controlled  a large number of workers opening and closing a series of canvas flaps.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/culture/2002/08/st_georges/air_con.shtml |title=Air conditioning |accessdate=2008-03-26 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref>

==Organ==

This was built by [[Henry Willis]] and completed in 1855 with 100 speaking [[Organ stop|stops]] across four manual divisions (of non-standard compass, 63 notes GG to a) and pedals (30 notes). It comprised a total of 119 ranks of pipes, plus 10 couplers, 10 composition pedals, and 36 pistons to set combinations of stops. It was initially tuned to [[meantone temperament]] to the specification of [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley|S. S. Wesley]] but in 1867 W. T. Best, city organist, retuned it to [[equal temperament]].  The organ was rebuilt in 1896 when the key action was changed from the Willis-Barker lever assisted tracker (i.e. pneumatic assisted mechanical) action to pneumatic action. Also the manual compass was changed to the now standard CC to c, 61 notes, making the bottom 5 pipes on every manual stop redundant.<ref name=organ/> In 1931 it was reconstructed by Henry Willis III when the number of stops was increased to 120 and [[electro-pneumatic action]] introduced for the combination systems and some of the key action. Its power source was still the Rockingham electric blowing plant which had replaced the two steam engines (one of 1855 and a second which had been added in about 1877 to run the increased pressure required since 1867 for some reed stops. In the interim this higher pressure had been hand blown!) The 1924 electric blowers remained in use until 2000 when the present new low and high pressure blowers were fitted by David Wells.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/culture/2002/08/st_georges/great_hall.shtml |title=The Great Hall |accessdate=2008-03-26 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref>  In 1979 it was given a general clean and overhaul by Henry Willis IV.  The total number of [[Registration (organ)|registers]], including 24 [[coupler]]s, is 144.<ref name=organ>{{citation  |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/~spmr02/organ/st-georges.html |title=The Organ in St George's Hall, Liverpool  |accessdate=2008-03-26 |last=Cromwell |first=Peter |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= }}</ref>  With 7,737 pipes, it was the largest organ in the country until a larger one was built at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1871, after which an organ even larger than the one at the Royal Albert Hall was constructed at [[Liverpool Anglican Cathedral]], untilising over 10,000 pipes.<ref name=bbcfacts>{{citation  |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/culture/2002/08/st_georges/facts_figures.shtml |title=Facts & figures |accessdate=2008-03-26 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref>  As part of the 2000&ndash;2007 restoration of the hall repairs were made to the organ, including replacement of the [[bellows]] leather.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.theorganmag.com/news/2005mar.html |title=St George's Hall organ to be restored |accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=The Organ }}</ref>  The organ is maintained by David Wells, Organ Builders.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.dwob.co.uk/ |title=David Wells, Organ Builders |accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=David Wells, Organ Builders }}</ref>

==St George's Plateau==

This is the flat space between the hall and the railway station and contains statues of four lions by Nicholl and [[cast iron]] lamp standards with dolphin bases.  Also on the plateau are monuments, including [[Equestrian statue|equestrian]] bronzes of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] by [[Thomas Thornycroft]], and a monument to Major-General William Earle by Birch.  Between the equestrian statues is a [[cenotaph]] which was unveiled in 1930, designed by [[Lionel Bailey Budden|L. B. Budden]] and sculpted by H. Tyson Smith.  It consists of a simple horizontal block with a bronze relief measuring over {{convert|31|ft|m|0}} on each side.  Sharples and Pollard regard it as one of the most remarkable war memorials in the country.<ref name=pp297/>

The Plateau has been associated with public rallies and gatherings, including the deaths of [[Beatles]], [[John Lennon]] and [[George Harrison]], and the homecomings of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] football teams after Cup Final Victories.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.northwestvision.co.uk/page/location-of-the-month-/-st.-georges-hall |title=The Magic of St George's Hall |accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=Northwest Vision and Media }}</ref> During the [[1911 Liverpool General Transport Strike]], many meetings were held there, including the rally which sparked the 'Bloody Sunday' attacks, when police [[baton charge]]d thousands of people who had gathered to hear [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Tom Mann]] speak.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.lmu.livjm.ac.uk/lhol/content.aspx?itemid=369 |title=Braddock, (Bessie) Elisabeth |accessdate=2008-03-26 |publisher=Liverpool History Online }}</ref>
