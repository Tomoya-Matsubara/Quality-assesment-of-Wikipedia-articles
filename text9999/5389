Subsequently, public protests against the [[Government of Delhi|state]] and [[Government of India|central]] governments for failing to provide adequate security for women took place in New Delhi, where thousands of protesters clashed with security forces. Similar protests took place in major cities throughout the country.

All the accused were arrested and charged with [[sexual assault]] and murder. One of the accused, Ram Singh, died in police custody on 11 March 2013 in the [[Tihar Jail]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-gangrape-case-accused-commits-suicide/article4496333.ece?homepage=true | title=Delhi gang-rape case accused commits 'suicide' | work=The Hindu | date=11 March 2013 | accessdate=11 March 2013 | location=Chennai, India | first1=Devesh K. | last1=Pandey | first2=Shubhomoy | last2=Sikdar}}</ref> According to some published reports, the police say Ram Singh hanged himself, but defence lawyers and his family suspect he was murdered.<ref>{{cite news|title=Delhi rape accused found dead in prison|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21737748|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 March 2013|date=11 March 2013}}</ref> The rest of the accused went on trial in a fast-track court; the prosecution finished presenting its evidence on 8 July 2013.<ref name=TOI87>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-08/delhi/40442634_1_akshay-thakur-juvenile-justice-board-moving-bus |title=December 16 gang rape: Prosecution finishes evidence |agency=Indo-Asian News Service |date=8 July 2013 |work=The Times of India |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021211850/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-08/delhi/40442634_1_akshay-thakur-juvenile-justice-board-moving-bus |archivedate=21 October 2013 |accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref> The juvenile was convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility.<ref>{{en icon}} [http://www.lejournalinternational.fr/Fast-Track-court-awards-death-sentences-to-convicts-of-Delhi-Rape-case_a1252.html <U+00AB> Fast Track court awards death sentences to convicts of Delhi Rape case <U+00BB>], Ramalingam.Va, Le Journal International, 14 septembre 2013</ref> On 10 September 2013, the four remaining adult defendants were found guilty of rape and murder and three days later were sentenced to death by hanging.<ref name="BBC 13 Sep">{{cite news|title=Delhi gang rape: Four sentenced to death|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-24078339|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 September 2013|date=13 September 2013}}</ref><ref name="NYT Sep 13"/><ref name="vocativ1">{{cite web|url=http://www.vocativ.com/09-2013/photos-india-demands-death-for-gang-rape-killers/ |title=Photos: Indian court echoes populist outcry, gives 4 rapists death sentence |publisher=Vocativ.com|work=Sneak Peek|last1=Sharma|first1=Betwa|date={{date|13 September 2013}}|accessdate={{date|14 September 2013}}}}</ref> On 13 March 2014, [[Delhi High Court]] in the death reference case and hearing appeals against the conviction by the lower Court, upheld the guilty verdict and the death sentences.<ref name=NDTV />

As a result of the protests, in December 2012, a judicial committee was set up to study and take public suggestions for the  best ways to amend laws to provide quicker investigation and prosecution of sex offenders. After considering 80,000 suggestions, the committee submitted a report which indicated that failures on the part of the government and police were the root cause behind crimes against women. In 2013, the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013]] was promulgated by President [[Pranab Mukherjee]], several new laws were passed, and six new fast-track courts were created to hear rape cases. Critics argue that the legal system remains slow to hear and prosecute rape cases, but most agree that the case has resulted in a tremendous increase in the public discussion of crimes against women and statistics show that there has been an improvement in the number of women willing to file a crime report. At a memorial held in December 2013, the press interviewed a young woman who had taken part in the protests a year earlier. She related that while "A welcome change is that the taboo on discussion  of rape and sexual violence has been broken," she saw "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality".<ref name="December 16 Special"/>

==Victims==
The female victim was born and raised in [[Delhi]] while her parents were from a small village in the [[Ballia district|Ballia]] district of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Her father sold his [[Chanvar|agricultural land]] to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a schoolteacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. "Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge."<ref name=village>{{cite news|title= Far from media storm, U.P. village grieves for its daughter|last= Rashid|first= Omar|location= Ballia|work= [[The Hindu]]|date= 30 December 2012|url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/far-from-media-storm-up-village-grieves-for-its-daughter/article4253570.ece|accessdate= 31 December 2012}}</ref> He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons.

According to an ASK spokesperson, "although previous demonstrations on similar issues were largely dominated by women, men were now protesting too.

The American embassy released a statement on 29 December 2012, offering their condolences to the woman's family and stating "we also recommit ourselves to changing attitudes and ending all forms of gender-based violence, which plagues every country in the world".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newdelhi.usembassy.gov/pr122912.html |title=U.S. Embassy New Delhi, India, Statement on the Death of New Delhi Assault Victim |publisher=Newdelhi.usembassy.gov |date=29 December 2012}}</ref> The female victim was posthumously awarded one of the 2013 [[International Women of Courage Award]]s of the [[US State Department]].

In the wake of remarks against India in western media, [[Jessica Valenti]], writing in ''[[The Nation]]'', argued that such rapes are also common in the [[Rape in the United States|United States]], but US commentators exhibit a [[double standard]] in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture.<ref name="nation">{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/172024/americas-rape-problem-we-refuse-admit-there-one |title=America's Rape Problem: We Refuse to Admit That There Is One |last= Valenti |first= Jessica |date= 4 January 2013 |work= [[The Nation]] |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref> Author and activist [[Eve Ensler]], who organised [[One Billion Rising]], a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder was a turning point in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India at the time of the rape and murder and that after <blockquote>having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the center of every discourse, in the center of the college students' discussions, in the center of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.democracynow.org/2013/2/14/one_billion_rising_playwright_eve_ensler#transcript | title=One Billion Rising: Playwright Eve Ensler Organizes Global Day of Dance Against Sexual Abuse | publisher=Democracynow.org | accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

==Results of protests==
In view of the widespread protests, governments at the centre and various states announced several steps to ensure the safety of women. The [[Government of Karnataka]] announced the launch of a [[24/7 service|24/7]] dedicated helpline (1091) to be operated by the state police to register sexual abuse complaints from women.<ref name="Hindu helpline launched">{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/helpline-launched-for-women-to-report-sexual-assault-cases/article4269699.ece | title=Helpline launched for women to report sexual assault cases | date=4 January 2013 | accessdate=2 July 2013 | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu}}</ref> It also is checking the possibility of setting up fast-track courts to dispose of pending cases pertaining to crimes against women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=437716&catid=36 |title=Karna mulls fast-track courts for crime against women |work=The Statesman |archiveurl=http://archive.is/3zNoc|archivedate=2013-02-22}}</ref> The [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] also announced a 13-point action plan to ensure safety of women in Tamil Nadu and said that incidents of sexual assault would be treated as a grave crime, and probes would be entrusted to top police officials.

===Justice Verma Committee and changes in law===
{{Further|Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013}}
On 22 December 2012, a judicial committee headed by [[Jagdish Sharan Verma|J. S. Verma]], a former [[Chief Justice of India]] and one of India's most highly regarded Chief Justices and eminent jurists, was appointed by the Central government to submit a report within 30 days to suggest amendments to criminal law to sternly deal with [[sexual abuse|sexual assault]] cases. The committee urged the public in general and particularly eminent jurists, legal professionals, NGOs, women's groups and civil society to share "their views, knowledge and experience suggesting possible amendments in the criminal and other relevant laws to provide for quicker investigation, prosecution and trial, and also enhanced punishment for criminals accused of committing sexual assault of an extreme nature against women.".<ref>{{cite news|first=Sandeep |last=Joshi |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/justice-verma-committee-begins-work-seeks-public-comments/article4235212.ece |title=Shinde calls meeting of Chief Secretaries, police chiefs to review crime against women |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2012 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref> The Committee held its first meeting on 26 December 2012; it had received more than 6000 emails with suggestions by then.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=91179 | title=Justice J.S.Verma Committee holds its First Meeting More than 6,000 E-Mails Received | publisher=Pib.nic.in | date=26 December 2012 | accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> The Justice Verma Committee report was submitted after 29 days, after considering 80,000 suggestions received during the period. The report indicated that failures on the part of the government and police were the root cause behind crimes against women. Suggestions in the report included the need to review the [[Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958]] (AFSPA) in conflict areas, and setting the maximum punishment for rape as life imprisonment rather than the death penalty. The committee did not favour lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16.<ref name=VermaCommittee_22Jan2013>{{cite news|title=Failure of governance root cause of crimes against women: Verma committee|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/failure-of-governance-root-cause-of-crimes-against-women-verma-committee/article4336046.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=23 January 2013|location=Chennai, India|first=Sandeep|last=Joshi}}</ref><ref name=VermaCommitteeHighlights_23Jan2013>{{cite news|title=Read: Highlights of Justice Verma Committee report|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/read-highlights-of-justice-verma-committee-report/317376-3.html|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=CNNIBNLive|date=23 January 2013}}</ref>

On 26 December 2012, a Commission of Inquiry headed by former Delhi High Court judge [[Usha Mehra]] was set up to identify lapses, determine responsibility in relation to the incident, and suggest measures to make Delhi and the wider [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] safer for women.<ref>{{cite news|author=Aarti Dhar |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-forms-panel-to-probe-delhi-rape-case/article4241274.ece |title=Commission to suggest steps to make Delhi safe for women |work=The Hindu |date=26 December 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2012 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref> On 1 January 2013, a task force headed by the Union Home Secretary was established to look into women's safety issues in Delhi and review the functioning of the city police force on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/government-constitutes-task-force-to-look-into-women-s-safety-issues_820124.html |title=Government constitutes task force to look into women's safety issues |publisher=Zee News |date=2 January 2013}}</ref>

On 3 February 2013, the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013]] was promulgated by President [[Pranab Mukherjee]]. It provides for amendment of the [[Indian Penal Code]], [[Indian Evidence Act]], and Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, on laws related to sexual offences.<ref>{{cite news|title=Prez Pranab Mukherjee promulgates ordinance on crime against women|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/president-pranab-mukherjee-promulgates-ordinance-on-crime-against-women/1068720/|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=3 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=President signs ordinance to effect changes in laws against sexual crimes|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/president-signs-ordinance-to-effect-changes-in-laws-against-sexual-crimes/1/248740.html|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=India Today|date=3 February 2013}}</ref> The ordinance provides for the death penalty in cases of rape. According to Minister of Law and Justice [[Ashwani Kumar]], 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the Ordinance. However, critics state that many key suggestions of the commission have been ignored, including the criminalization of marital rape and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under criminal law.<ref>{{cite news|title=We have accepted 90% of Justice Verma panel's recommendations: Law Minister|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/we-have-accepted-90-of-justice-verma-panel-s-recommendations-law-minister-to-ndtv-325775|accessdate=4 February 2013|publisher=NDTV|date=3 February 2013}}</ref>

In a December 2013 interview, the rape victim's parents, Badri Nath Singh and Asha Devi, said they are trying to get the juvenile law changed in such crimes as the rape and murder of their daughter. They petitioned the Supreme Court to try the juvenile, just short of 18 when he committed the crime, in a criminal court instead of a Juvenile Justice court.<ref name=autogenerated6>{{cite news| url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/a-year-later-family-of-delhi-gang-rape-victim-press-for-full-justice/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Betwa | last=Sharma | title=A Year Later, Family of Delhi Gang Rape Victim Press for <U+2018>Full Justice' | date=16 December 2013}}</ref>

==Legacy==

===Anniversary memorials===

On 16 December 2013, the anniversary of the attack, activists held memorials throughout New Delhi in memory of the rape victim widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning "fearless". Members of women's organisations lit candles in her memory and protested against exploitation of women. University students and others organised a candlelight march at the bus stand in South Delhi where the woman and her friend boarded the bus in which the rape and beatings took place.<ref>[http://in.news.yahoo.com/dec-16-gang-rape-family-set-trust-tributes-175222551.html Dec 16 gang rape: Family to set up trust, tributes paid to victim - Yahoo News India<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At a commemorative prayer meeting political leaders resolved to increase efforts to improve women's security. Speaking with the victim's mother, former chief minister [[Sheila Dikshit]] said that Delhi's society and the various authorities will work together to build a permanent legacy to her daughter: "...&nbsp;whatever you will want in her memory, we will try to fulfill. And we will try with a conviction that such an incident is not repeated with anybody else in the future".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-16/india/45254541_1_prayer-meeting-juvenile-justice-board-juvenile-home | work=The Times Of India | title=Trust to be set up to help rape victims: Nirbhaya's mother - The Times of India}}</ref>

The victim's parents spoke at a memorial saying that they were proud of the courage that their daughter showed, which they believe "has spurred more women to speak out instead of hiding the crimes committed against them".<ref name=autogenerated6 />

===Improvements to the legal system===

The outpouring of anger and grief following the rape and murder gave rise to hopes for change in India.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20907755 | work=BBC News | title=The rapes that India forgot | date=5 January 2013}}</ref> The government responded with the passage of several new sexual assault laws, including a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years for gang rape, and six new fast-track courts created solely for rape prosecutions.<ref>[http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/29/3106691/india-rape-anniversary/ One Year After Horrific New Delhi Gang Rape, India Still Struggles With Rape Culture | ThinkProgress<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As an indicator of the scope of the problem of rape prosecution, the "Nirbhaya" case was the only conviction obtained among the 706 rape cases filed in New Delhi in 2012.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/delhi-rape-one-year-anything-changed-india-women Delhi rape: one year on, has anything changed for India's women? | World news | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Between 16 December 2012 and 4 January 2013, Delhi police recorded 501 allegations of harassment and 64 of rape, but only four inquiries were launched. However, it appears that the "Nirbhaya" case has had an effect on the willingness of rape or molestation victims to report the crime; police records show that during the final nine months of 2013 almost twice as many rape victims filed a police report and four times as many allegations of molestation were made.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> A recent report released by the [[National Crime Records Bureau]] shows that 95 percent of the cases brought to the police were classified as a crime. However, there is a large backlog of cases with fewer than 15 percent of those charged tried in 2012, leaving 85 percent waiting to come to trial.<ref>[http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/12/19/one-year-on-from-delhi-bus-gang-rape-what-has-changed-for-india-s-women.html One Year On From Delhi Bus Rape, What Has Changed for India's Women? - The Daily Beast<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On 16 December 2013, the one-year anniversary of the rape was commemorated in London with a public memorial to honor the victim. Speakers included [[Meera Syal]], whose parents are from New Delhi. Speaking of the anger that was expressed at the time of the rape, she said, "We need to hold onto that anger and demand that the Indian Government enforces all the promised changes of its recent Criminal Law Amendment Act, which changed laws to expand the definition of rape and incorporated new offences including acid attack, sexual harassment, voyeurism and stalking".<ref name=Syal>[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/meera-syal/meera-syal-delhi-gang-rape_b_4452241.html Remembering Nirbhaya: Rape Is Every Country's Shame | Meera Syal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She also said that activists need to act in solidarity with other organisations to stop violence against women and girls around the world.<ref name=Syal/>

===Public discussions about violence against women===

Observers agree that the victim's ordeal has brought a change to public conversations about women's issues, with men joining in the discussions as well. A young woman who had taken part in the protests at the time of the rape said a year later, "A welcome change is that the taboo on discussing rape and sexual violence has been broken. The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes."<ref name="December 16 Special">[http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/december16special/index.html December 16 Delhi gangrape: one year later<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Eve teasing]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant."<ref name="December 16 Special"/> She added, "I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what [[patriarchy]] has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws. The police may be a little more receptive, but it is not out of a sense of duty but out of the fear of censure".<ref name="December 16 Special"/>

===Nirbhaya Trust===

The family of the victim recently established the Nirbhaya Trust,<ref name="nirbhayatr">{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-16/india/45254541_1_prayer-meeting-juvenile-justice-board-juvenile-home |title=Trust to be set up to help rape victims: Nirbhaya's mother |date=December 16, 2013 |accessdate=2014-01-21 |work=Times of India}}</ref> an institute formed to assist women who have experienced violence to find shelter and legal assistance. Due to the fact that Indian laws do not allow the publishing of a rape victim's name, it was named ''Nirbhaya'' which means ''fearless'' in Hindi, after the name used by the media. The victim's father stated, "So many people supported us, so&nbsp;... we want [to] help those girls who have no one."<ref name="ayrlater">[http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/a-year-later-family-of-delhi-gang-rape-victim-press-for-full-justice/ A Year Later, Family of Delhi Gang Rape Victim Press for 'Full Justice']</ref>
