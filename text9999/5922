The '''Jodrell Bank Observatory''' (originally the '''Jodrell Bank Experimental Station''', then the '''Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories''' from 1966 to 1999) is an [[observatory]] that hosts a number of [[radio telescope]]s, and is part of the [[Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics]] at the [[University of Manchester]]. It is located near [[Goostrey]] and [[Holmes Chapel]] in [[Macclesfield (borough)|Macclesfield]], [[Cheshire]] in the north<U+2013>west of [[England]].

The main telescope at the observatory is the [[Lovell Telescope]], which is the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes located at the observatory; the [[Mark II]], as well as 42&nbsp;ft and 7&nbsp;m diameter radio telescopes. Jodrell Bank Observatory is also the base of the [[MERLIN|Multi<U+2013>Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network]] (MERLIN), a National Facility run by the [[University of Manchester]] on behalf of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]].

The observatory was established in 1945 by [[Bernard Lovell|Sir Bernard Lovell]], who wanted to investigate [[cosmic ray]]s after his work on [[radar]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It has since played an important role in the research of [[meteor]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[astrophysical maser|masers]] and [[gravitational lens]]es, and was heavily involved with the tracking of [[space probe]]s at the start of the [[Space Age]].

== Early years ==
[[Image:Jodrell bank Hut 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Observations at Jodrell Bank in 1945.]]
{{seealso|Timeline of Jodrell Bank Observatory}}
Jodrell Bank was first used for academic purposes in 1939 when the [[University of Manchester]]'s [[horticulture|horticultural]] [[botany]] department purchased three fields at the site. The name of the site came from a nearby ground rise called Jodrell Bank, which was named after the descendants on [[William Jauderell]] who lived in a [[mansion]] that is now [[Terra Nova School]]. The site was extended in 1952 by the purchase of a farm from a local farmer, George Massey. The new land included the site upon which the [[Lovell Telescope]] was sited.<ref name="story_jb">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank''</ref>

The first use of the site for [[astrophysics]] was in 1945, when Bernard Lovell wished to use some equipment left over from [[World War II]], including a [[gun laying]] [[radar]] to investigate [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref name="story_2">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 2</ref> The equipment he was using was a GL II radar system working at a wavelength of 4.2&nbsp;m, provided by [[J. S. Hey]].<ref name="astronomer_110">Astronomer by Chance, p. 110</ref><ref name="2005Gunn">Gunn, 2005</ref> He originally intended to use the equipment in [[Manchester]], however electrical [[interference]] from the trams that then ran down [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]] prevented him from doing so. Consequently, he moved the equipment to Jodrell Bank, 25 miles (40 km) south of the city on [[10 December]] [[1945]].<ref name="2005Gunn" /><ref name="story_3">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 3</ref> Lovell's main topic of research at the time were transient radio echoes, which he confirmed were from [[ionisation|ionized]] meteor trails by October 1946.<ref name="story_9">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 9</ref> Coincidentally, the first time he turned the radar on at Jodrell Bank<U+2014>the [[14 December]] [[1945]]<U+2014>the [[Geminids]] [[meteor shower]] was at a maximum.<ref name="story_3">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 3</ref>

Over the next few years, he accumulated more ex<U+2013>military radio hardware, including a portable cabin, commonly known as a "Park Royal" in the military. The first permanent building on the site was located near to this cabin, and was named after it.<ref name="story_9">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 9</ref>

== Searchlight telescope ==
A [[searchlight]] was loaned to Jodrell Bank in 1946 by the [[British Army|Army]];<ref name="story_10">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 10</ref> a broadside array was constructed on the mount of this searchlight by [[J. Clegg]],<ref name="story_10">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 10</ref> consisting of a number of [[Yagi antenna]]e.<ref name="astronomer_129">Astronomer by Chance, p. 129</ref> This was first used for astronomical observations in October 1946.<ref name="astronomer_128">Astronomer by Chance, p. 128</ref>

On 9 and [[10 October]] [[1946]], the telescope was used to observe the [[ionisation]] in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the [[Giacobinids]] meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors.<ref name="astronomer_129">Astronomer by Chance, p. 129</ref> Shortly after this, the telescope was used to determine the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it.<ref name="story_10">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 10</ref> The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral streamer]]s that were visible at the site in early August 1947.<ref name="story_15">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 15</ref><ref name="astronomer_186">Astronomer by Chance, p. 186</ref>

== Transit Telescope ==
<!-- [[:fr:T<U+00E9>lescope Transit]] -->
The Transit Telescope was a 218&nbsp;ft [[parabola|parabolic]] reflecting [[antenna (radio)|aerial]] built at Jodrell Bank in [[1947]]. At the time, it was the largest [[radio telescope]] in the world. It consisted of a wire mesh suspended from a ring of 24&nbsp;ft [[scaffolding|scaffold poles]], which focussed radio signals to a [[focus (optics)|focal point]] 126&nbsp;ft above the ground. The telescope mainly looked directly upwards, but the direction of the beam could be changed by small amounts by tilting the mast to change the position of the focal point. The focal mast was originally going to be wood, but this was changed to a steel mast before construction was complete.<ref>Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank''</ref>  The telescope was replaced by the fully<U+2013>steerable, 250&nbsp;ft [[Lovell Telescope]], and the [[Mark II]] telescope was subsequently built on the same location.

The telescope was able to map a <U+00B1> 15 degree strip around the zenith at 72 and 160MHz, with a resolution at 160MHz of 1 degree.<ref name="bluebook">{{cite book | first=Bernard | last=Lovell | authorlink=Bernard Lovell | title=Blue Book | year=1950 | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/public/archive/BlueBook/}} (the proposal document for the [[Lovell Telescope]]).

== Lovell Telescope ==
[[Image:Lovell Telescope 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lovell Telescope]].]]
{{main|Lovell Telescope}}
The famous "Mark I" telescope, now known as the [[Lovell Telescope]], was the largest steerable dish radio telescope in the world, 76.2&nbsp;m (250&nbsp;ft) in diameter, when it was completed in 1957;<ref>

The telescope was the only one in the world able to track Sputnik's booster rocket by radar; it first located it just before midnight on [[12 October]] [[1957]].<ref name="story_196">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 196</ref><ref name="astronomer_262">Lovell, ''Astronomer by Chance'', p. 262</ref>

In the following years, the telescope was used to track a variety of space probes. Between 11 March and [[12 June]] [[1960]], it tracked the [[Pioneer V]] probe. The telescope was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones to turn on the more powerful transmitter when the probe was 8 million miles away. It also received data from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.<ref>Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. xii, pp. 239<U+2013>244<br />Lovell, ''Astronomer by Chance'', p. 272<br />{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894817,00.html | title=Voice in Space | publisher=Time Magazine | date=[[21 March]] [[1960]] | accessdate=2007-04-09}}<br />{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827621,00.html | title=Big Voice from Space | publisher=[[Time Magazine]] | date=[[23 May]] [[1960]] | accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref> In February 1966, Jodrell Bank tracked the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] unmanned moon lander [[Luna 9]] and listened in on its [[facsimile]] transmission of photographs from the moon's surface.

Despite the publicity surrounding the telescope's tracking of space probes, this only took up a fraction of its observing time, with the remainder used for scientific observations.

== Mark II and III telescopes ==
[[Image:Jodrell Bank Mark II.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mark II]]]]
{{main|Mark II|Mark III (radio telescope)}}
The Mark II is an elliptical radio telescope, with a major axis 125&nbsp;ft (38.1&nbsp;m) and a minor axis of 83&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in (25.4&nbsp;m). It was constructed in 1964. Aside from operating as a standalone telescope, it has also been used as an interferometer with the [[Lovell Telescope]]<ref name="interferometer">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/lovell/interfer.html | title=Interferometers | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref>, and is now primarily used as part of [[MERLIN]] (see below).<ref name="jbo_mk2">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/public/story/mk2.html | title=The MKII Radio Telescope | publisher = Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref>

The [[Mark III (radio telescope)|Mark III]] telescope was the same size as the Mark II, but was constructed to be transportable.<ref name="nature">Palmer and Rowson (1968)</ref> However, it was never moved, and remained at its original site in [[Wardle]], near [[Nantwich]], where it was used as part of [[MERLIN]]. It was built in 1966, and was decommissioned in 1996.<ref name="merlin_locations">{{cite web | url=http://www.merlin.ac.uk/user_guide/OnlineMUG/newch0-node62.html | title=MERLIN user guide - 4.1 Location of Telescopes | accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

== Mark IV, V and VA telescopes ==
[[Image:Mark V radio telescope model.jpg|thumb|A model of the proposed Mark V radio telescope.]]
The Mark IV, V and VA telescopes were three proposals that were put forward in the 1960s through to the 1980s to build an even larger radio telescope than the Lovell. The Mark IV would have been a 1,000&nbsp;ft diameter standalone telescope, built as a national project. The Mark V would have been a 400&nbsp;ft moveable telescope. The original concept of this telescope had it located on a 3/4 mile long railway line adjoining Jodrell Bank, however concerns about the future levels of interference meant that a site in [[Wales]] would have been used (the preferred site was near [[Meifod]]). Several design propoposals were put forward, one by Husband and Co., the other by Freeman Fox, who had designed the [[Parkes Observatory]] telescope. The Mark VA followed on from the Mark V, but with a smaller dish (375&nbsp;ft) and a design using [[prestressed concrete]], similar to the [[Mark II]] (the previous two designs more closely resembled the Lovell telescope).<ref name="jb_telescopes">Lovell, ''Jodrell Bank Telescopes''</ref>

None of the three telescopes were constructed, although several design studies were carried out and some scale models were made. This was due partly due to the political climate at the time (including the transition from a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government under [[Harold Wilson]] to a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] one under [[Margaret Thatcher]]), and partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the [[Lovell Telescope]] to the Mark IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.<ref name="jb_telescopes">Lovell, ''Jodrell Bank Telescopes''</ref>

== Other single dishes ==
[[Image:Jodrell Bank 7m Undergraduate.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Undergraduate teaching telescope, with the Lovell telescope in the background]]
A 50&nbsp;ft alt<U+2013>azimuth dish was also in use on the site; this was built in 1964. In addition to astronomical research, it was used to track the [[Zond 1]], [[Zond 2]], [[Ranger 6]] and [[Ranger 7]] space probes,<ref name="earlyprobetracking">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/public/story/tracking/ | title=Jodrell Bank's role in early space tracking activities | accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> and also [[Apollo 11]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/history/three_transcript_p.html | title=The other space race: Transcript | publisher=[[BBC]]/[[Open University]] | accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> The 50&nbsp;ft telescope was demolished in 1982, when it was replaced with a more accurate 42&nbsp;ft following an accident that irreparably damaged the dish's surface. The 42&nbsp;ft dish is mainly used for observations of pulsars, and is normally continually monitoring the pulsar in the [[Crab Nebula]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/booklet/Pulsars.html | title=Jodrell Bank <U+2014> Pulsars | accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref>

At the same time as the 42&nbsp;ft was installed, a smaller 7&nbsp;m dish was installed, which is now used for undergraduate teaching. Both the 42&nbsp;ft and 7&nbsp;m telescopes were originally used at the [[Woomera Rocket Testing Range]] in [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/public/tour/lobs.html | title=JBO <U+2014> Lovell Observing Room | accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> Also, a Polar Axis telescope was built on the site in 1962. This had a circular 50&nbsp;ft (15.2&nbsp;m) dish on a [[polar mount]],<ref name="jbtelescopes_232">Lovell, ''Jodrell Bank Telescopes'', p. 232</ref> and was mostly used for moon radar experiments. It has since been decommissioned.

There has also been an optical telescope at the observatory; an 18 inch reflecting optical telescope was donated to the observatory in 1951.<ref name="history_manuni_37">Pullan, ''A history of the University of Manchester 1951<U+2013>73'', p. 37</ref> However, this telescope was not used much, and was in turn donated to the Salford Astronomical Society around 1971.<ref name="salford_astro_society">{{cite web | url=http://www.salfordastro.org.uk/observatory.html | title=Salford Astronomical Society <U+2014> Observatory | accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>

== MERLIN ==
{{main|MERLIN}}
The Multi<U+2013>Element Radio Linked [[Interferometer]] Network (MERLIN) is an array of [[radio telescope]]s spread across [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The array is run from Jodrell Bank on behalf of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] as a National Facility.<ref name="merlin">{{cite web | url=http://www.merlin.ac.uk/ | title=MERLIN/VLBI National Facility | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> The array consists of up to seven [[radio telescope]]s and includes the [[Lovell Telescope]], [[Mark II]], Cambridge, Defford, [[Knockin]], Darnhall and Pickmere (previously known as Tabley). The longest baseline is therefore 217km and MERLIN can operate at [[Frequency|frequencies]] between 151 [[Megahertz|MHz]] and 24 [[Hertz|GHz]].<ref name="merlin_locations">{{cite web | url=http://www.merlin.ac.uk/user_guide/OnlineMUG/newch0-node62.html | title=MERLIN user guide - 4.1 Location of Telescopes | accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> At a [[wavelength]] of 6 cm (5 GHz frequency), MERLIN has a resolution of 40&nbsp;milli[[arcsecond]]s which is comparable to that of the [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] at optical wavelengths.<ref name="merlin_hubble">{{cite web | url=http://www.merlin.ac.uk/e-merlin/introduction.html | title=MERLIN/VLBI National Facility - e-MERLIN - Introduction | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

== Very Long Baseline Interferometry ==
{{main|European VLBI Network|Very Long Baseline Interferometry}}
Jodrell Bank has been involved with [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes being those at [[Algonquin]] and [[Penticton]] in [[Canada]].<ref name="zenith_67">Lovell, ''Out of the Zenith'', pp. 67<U+2013>68</ref> The Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the [[European VLBI Network]]), giving a resolution of around 0.001 [[arcseconds]].<ref name="interferometer">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/lovell/interfer.html | title=Interferometers | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref>

== Research ==
{{main|Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics}}
The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, of which the Observatory is a part, is one of the largest astrophysics research groups in the UK.<ref name="physics_researchgroups">{{cite web | url=http://www.physics.manchester.ac.uk/research/groups/ | title=Research groups (School of Physics and Astronomy <U+2013> The University of Manchester) | accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> Naturally, the main focus of the group is radio astronomy - including research into [[pulsar]]s, the [[Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation]], [[gravitational lens]]es, [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] and [[astrophysical maser]]s. The group also carries out research at different wavelengths, looking into [[star formation]] and evolution, [[planetary nebulae]] and [[astrochemistry]].<ref name="research">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/ | title=Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics Research | accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

The first director of Jodrell Bank was [[Bernard Lovell]], who established the observatory in 1945. He was succeeded in 1980 by [[Francis Graham-Smith|Sir Francis Graham-Smith]], followed by [[Rod Davies|Professor Rod Davies]] around 1990 and [[Andrew Lyne|Professor Andrew Lyne]] in 1999.<ref name="lyne_appointment">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/news/director/dir_nral.html | title=Director of the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories, Jodrell Bank | accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> The current director is [[Phil Diamond|Professor Phil Diamond]], who took over the role on [[1 October]] [[2006]].

There is also an active development program researching and constructing telescope receivers and instrumentation. The observatory has been involved in the construction of several [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] experiments, including the [[Tenerife Experiment]], which ran from the 1980s to 2000, and the amplifiers and cryostats for the [[Very Small Array]].<ref name="vsa_cryostats">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/technology/vsa.html | title=JBO <U+2014> VSA Receivers | accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref> It has also constructed the 30 and 44GHz receivers for the [[Planck Surveyor]] satellite.<ref name="jb_bigbang">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/booklet/BigBang.html | title=Jodrell Bank <U+2014> Observing the Big Bang | accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> Receivers were also designed at Jodrell Bank for the [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes Telescope]] in Australia.<ref name="jodrellbank_anatomy">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/booklet/Anatomy.html | title=Jodrell Bank <U+2014> Anatomy of a Radio Telescope | accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref>

== Visitor facilities ==
[[Image:Jodrell.Bank.Telescope.From.Arboretum.JPG|thumb|A view of the telescope from the Arboretum.]]
There is an educational visitors' centre at the site, which covers the history of Jodrell Bank and also has a 3D theatre hosting trips to [[Mars]].<ref name="jbo_mars">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/viscen/3dtheatre.html | title=Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre 3D Theatre | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2006-11-24}}</ref> There is also a path around the Lovell telescope, approximately 20&nbsp;m from the telescope's outer railway, which hosts a number of information boards explaining how the telescope works and the research that is done with it.

The 35&nbsp;acre (140,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) Jodrell Bank [[Arboretum]], created in 1972, houses the UK's national collections of [[crab apple]] ''Malus'' and [[Sorbus|mountain ash]] ''Sorbus'' species, as well as the Heather Society's ''[[Calluna]]'' collection.  The arboretum also features a small [[scale model]] of the [[solar system]], the scale being approximately 1:5,000,000,000. As part of the ''SpacedOut'' project, Jodrell Bank is also the location of the Sun in a 1:15,000,000 scale model of the solar system covering the UK.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spacedout-uk.com/solar_system/solar_info.asp?site_id=2 | title=SpacedOut Location:  The Sun at Jodrell Bank | acccessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>

==Fictional references==
Jodrell Bank has been mentioned in several popular works of fiction. Part of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode ''[[Logopolis]]'' was filmed at Jodrell Bank. Also, Jodrell Bank was mentioned twice in the book [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]: "The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at [[Goonhilly]], they passed over [[Cape Canaveral]] without a blip, [[Woomera]] and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them<U+2014>which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years",<ref name="hitchhiker">Adams, ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', p. 30</ref> and "Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea."<ref name="hitchhiker2">Adams, ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', p. 31</ref> The Lovell Telescope also appeared briefly in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy film]] and scenes in the movie trailer were filmed in the main control room. The observatory also got a brief mention in the infamous [[B-movie]] ''[[The Creeping Terror]]''.
