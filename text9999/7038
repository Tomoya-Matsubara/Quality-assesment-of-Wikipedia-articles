The '''Keros-Syros culture''' is named after the two islands in the [[Cyclades]] -- [[Keros]] and [[Syros]]. This culture flourished during the Early Cycladic II period (ca 2700-2300 BC) of the [[Cycladic civilization]]. The trade relations of this culture spread far and wide from the Greek mainland to [[Crete]] and [[Asia Minor]].

==Periodization==
[[Colin Renfrew]] has proposed an Early Cycladic subdivision into Grotta-Pelos, Keros-Syros, Kastri, and Phylakopi I periods.<ref>[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prehistory/aegean/?page_id=554 The Early Cycladic Period.] Aegean Prehistoric Archaeology at Dartmouth College</ref>

After the Keros-Syros culture, [[:Syros#Kastri culture|Kastri culture]] is believed to follow, although this view is not accepted by all. Some researchers in Europe believe that Keros-Syros and Kastri cultures belong to the same phase.

==Important sites==

Some of the best preserved sites of this culture are at [[Kea (island)|Kea]] and [[Ios (island)|Ios]], located not far from Keros.

One of the important sites of this culture is [[Chalandriani]] at Syros.

Some of the important artifacts of this culture are the so-called "[[Frying pans]]" <U+2013> shallow circular vessels or bowls with a decorated base. They are found especially during the Cycladic Grotta-Pelos and Keros-Syros cultures. It has been suggested that when filled with water they were used as mirrors.

==Use of metal==
The use of metal became widespread during this period. In all the settlements there were found grave goods in the form of daggers, and also tools such as chisels, tweezers and fishhooks. Also [[fibulae]] (brooches) were made of bronze and silver.

Keros-Syros culture is clearly seen as the successor of Grotta-Pelos.

The trade relations of Keros-Syros culture are widespread. They range from the Greek mainland to Crete, where the Cycladic figurines were exported, and imitated by the local artists. Also, the trade went as far as the Asia Minor. Finds at [[Troy]], in the periods of Troy I and Troy II, were also made.
