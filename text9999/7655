In 1998, she became a surgeon assistant at the hospital in [[Narvik]], Norway. While skiing in the mountains outside of the town on May 20, 1999, she accidentally fell into a frozen stream and got stuck under a layer of ice for eighty minutes until she was rescued. B<U+00E5>genholm was able to find an air pocket under the ice, but became [[Clinical death|clinically dead]] after forty minutes in the water. Her [[Normal human body temperature|body temperature]] decreased to {{convert|13.7|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}<U+2014>the lowest survived body temperature ever recorded in a human. 

B<U+00E5>genholm was transported by helicopter to the [[University Hospital of North Norway|Troms<U+00F8> University Hospital]], where a team of more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked for nine hours to save her life. B<U+00E5>genholm woke up [[Paralysis|paralyzed]] from the neck down on 30 May 1999, and recovered in an [[intensive care unit]] for two months. Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, she still suffers from minor [[nerve damage]] in her hands and feet. B<U+00E5>genholm is currently working as a radiologist at the hospital where her life was saved.

Doctor Petter Andreas Steen, professor at the [[Rikshospitalet|National Hospital in Oslo]], said it was "an extraordinary medical achievement" that B<U+00E5>genholm's life could he saved. He believed the reason she was able to recover was that her [[metabolism]] slowed down during the incident and the tissues inside her body required less oxygen at the low temperatures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=117&art_id=qw939232860566B256|title=Coldest woman talks about her close call |date=1999-10-06|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]]|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> According to the journal ''Proto Magazine'' by [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], B<U+00E5>genholm's metabolism slowed down to ten percent of "its baseline rate" and thus she barely needed any oxygen at all.<ref name="Proto"/>

==Aftermath==
Despite the severe damages to B<U+00E5>genholm's body, she did not suffer any [[brain damage]]; Gilbert commented on this: "Her body had time to cool down completely before the heart stopped. Her brain was so cold when the heart stopped that the [[brain cell]]s needed very little oxygen, so the brain could survive for quite a prolonged time."<ref name="CBS1"/> B<U+00E5>genholm's case and the cases of others who have survived extreme hypothermia have, according to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', "informed modern medicine to such an extent that cooling patients is emerging as a way to save victims of [[heart attack]], [[head trauma]], [[stroke]] and [[Spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]]."<ref name="SMH">{{cite news|last=Fallon|first=Mary|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/the-cool-way-to-treat-trauma-20090407-9xwi.html|title=The cool way to treat trauma|date=2009-07-09|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>

[[File:CPR training-05.jpg|thumb|250px|Gilbert said vigorous CPR plays an important role in the rescuing of victims of accidental hypothermia with [[circulatory arrest]].]]
According to [[BBC News]], most patients who suffer from extreme hypothermia die, even if doctors are able to re-start their hearts. The survival rate for adults whose body temperature has decreased to below {{convert|28|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} is 10%<U+2013>33%.<ref name="BBC1"/> Prior to B<U+00E5>genholm's accident, the lowest survived body temperature was {{convert|14.4|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}, which had been recorded in a child.<ref name="LaNaci<U+00F3>n">{{cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=3591|title=Resucitaron a una esquiadora que estuvo 40 minutos bajo el hielo|last=Libedinsky |first=Juana|date=2000-01-31|work=[[La Naci<U+00F3>n]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref><ref name="BBC1"/> Gilbert said "victims of very deep accidental hypothermia with [[circulatory arrest]] should be seen as potentially resuscitable with a prospect of full recovery. The key success factors of such marginal resuscitation efforts are early bystander actions with vigorous CPR and early warning of the emergency system, early dispatch of adequate rescue units (ground and air-ambulances) and good co-ordination between the resources outside and inside the hospital, aggressive rewarming and a spirit not to give up."<ref name="BBC1"/> [[General practitioner]] Jel Coward from [[Tywyn]] said persons who are victims of extreme hypothermia are often mistaken to be dead because it can be difficult to detect a pulse on them. He said this case "really does bring it home to us how cautious one has to be before diagnosing death in people who are cold."<ref name="BBC1"/>
