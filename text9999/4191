'''Leek Town Football Club''' is an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Leek, Staffordshire]], currently playing in the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division]].  The team, nicknamed "The Blues", play their home games at Harrison Park.

The club was founded in 1946 and played in a variety of local leagues, including the [[Staffordshire County League]], [[Manchester Football League|Manchester League]], [[Mid-Cheshire League]] and [[Cheshire County League]], before becoming founder members of the [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties League]] in 1982 and from there progressing to the [[Northern Premier League]] in 1987.  In 1997 they were Northern Premier League champions and gained promotion to the [[Football Conference]], the highest level of English [[non-league football]], although they only spent two seasons at that level before being relegated.

Leek Town reached the final of the [[FA Trophy]] in 1990, having progressed all the way from the First Qualifying Round, but lost in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

==History==
===Early history===
Football was played in Leek from at least 1876, with an earlier side called simply Leek F.C. having been part of [[The Combination]] in the 1890s,<ref name="fchd">{{Cite web
| url = http://www.fchd.info/LEEK.HTM
| title = Leek
| accessdate = 2007-07-06
| publisher = The Football Club History Database
}}</ref> but the current Leek Town club traces its lineage to the formation of a team called Leek Lowe Hamil in 1946 (although the club's official history does not mention it, some sources state that the club was initially known as Abbey Green Rovers before adopting the Lowe Hamil name).<ref name="moss">{{Cite web

}}</ref><ref name="PP" />  

The club began life playing in the local Leek and Moorlands League, playing on a field adjoining a [[pub]], before joining the [[Staffordshire County League]] in 1947.  In [[1949-50 in English football|1949&ndash;50]] Lowe Hamil were champions of this league, becoming the first (and to date only) team to win the title without losing a single match<ref name="Mgrs" /> (some sources state this title win occurred in [[1950-51 in English football|1950&ndash;51]]).<ref name="moss" />  In 1951 the team switched to the [[Manchester Football League|Manchester League]], adopting the name Leek Town at the same time,<ref name="Mgrs" /> and won the championship at the very first attempt,<ref name="moss" /> after which the team relocated once more to the [[Mid-Cheshire League]], where again they played for just one season.<ref name="fchd" />  In 1954 the team joined the [[West Midlands Regional League|Birmingham & District League]] but resigned in the middle of the [[1956-57 in English football|1956&ndash;57]] season due to financial difficulties, after which they had another brief spell in the Manchester League, which was also curtailed due to monetary problems,<ref name="moss" /> before eventually returning to the [[Staffordshire County League]].<ref name="Mgrs" />

In 1968 a new committee was formed, under which the club emerged from the doldrums.  Manager Paul Ogden took over in 1969 and led the club to two Staffordshire County League championships, followed in quick succession by two Manchester League titles.<ref name="moss" />  After the second Manchester League win Leek joined the [[Cheshire County League]], where they were league champions at the second attempt in the [[1974-75 in English football|1974&ndash;75]] season, but after Ogden left in 1975 to take over as manager of [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] a series of managers came and went in quick succesion without being able to maintain this level of success.<ref name="Mgrs" />

===Modern history===
In 1982 the Cheshire County League merged with the [[Lancashire Combination]] to form the new [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties League]], where Leek spent five relatively unsuccessful seasons.<ref name="fchd" />  During their spell in this league former [[England national football team|England]] player [[Mike Pejic]] took over as manager, Leek's most high-profile appointment to date, but he had only a short reign before moving to [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]].<ref name="Mgrs" />  Folllowing Kevin Lewis' brief reign Neil Baker took over in 1986 and was to lead the club to its greatest success to date.  

Leek were chosen to be among the founder members of the new [[Northern Premier League]] Division One in 1987 and in [[1989-90 in English football|1989&ndash;90]] won the Division One title to gain promotion to the Premier Division, the highest level at which they had ever played.  In the same season they progressed through eight rounds of the [[FA Trophy]], including a quarter-final win over [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], that season's [[Football Conference|Conference]] champions, to reach the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] but were defeated 3&ndash;0 by [[Barrow F.C.|Barrow]].<ref name="fchd" />

In [[1993-94 in English football|1993&ndash;94]] Leek finished second in the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division]], which should have been sufficient for promotion to the [[Football Conference]], however they were refused promotion due to financial irregularities.  To compound their problems, they were shifted from the Northern Premier League to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], with the resulting travel costs nearly crippling the club.  After one season the club was allowed to return to the Northern Premier League.<ref name="moss" />

In [[1996-97 in English football|1996&ndash;97]] Leek again claimed the Northern Premier League title and were this time granted promotion to the Conference, but were relegated back to the Northern Premier League Premier Division after just two seasons.<ref name="fchd" />

Recent years have seen the club achieve a series of mid-table finishes in the league but struggle off the pitch.  On [[21 June]] [[2006]] it was announced that the club was in such severe financial peril that it was facing a winding-up order,<ref name="NLD">{{Cite web

Harrison Park lies on the outskirts of Leek and has been the team's home since 1948, when the club purchased what was then called Hamil Park for the sum of <U+00A3>1,250.  Changing rooms were constructed in the 1950s (previously the players has been obliged to change in a nearby pub), along with the first covered accommodation for spectators, and floodlights (which had previously belonged to the defunct [[Rugby Town F.C.|Rugby Town]]) were erected in 1972, soon after which the stadium was renamed Harrison Park after former club chairman Geoff Harrison.<ref name="PP">{{Cite web

Leek's best ever league finish was a 19th place finish in [[Conference National]] (level 5 of the overall [[English football league system]]) in [[1997-98 in English football|1997&ndash;98]], the first of two seasons the team played at that level.  The Blues have only twice progressed as far as the rounds proper of the [[FA Cup]], reaching the first round in [[1993-94 in English football|1993&ndash;94]] and the second round in [[1990-91 in English football|1990&ndash;91]], when they held [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] to a draw at home but lost 4&ndash;0 in the replay.<ref name="fchd" />
