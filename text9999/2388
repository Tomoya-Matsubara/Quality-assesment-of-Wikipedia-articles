{{Dravidian politics-col}}
'''[[Tamil cinema]]''' has played a vital role in [[Dravidian politics]] in the [[South India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Films have been influential in Indian politics since the days of the [[British Raj]], when movies were used for anti-British propaganda. Nevertheless, the leaders of the [[Indian National Congress]] viewed movie media with contempt. It was the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK), a Dravidian party, that made extensive use of this media for propaganda purposes. Adversaries of Dravidian parties despised the use of films and screen popularity for political gain, and Congress leaders like [[K. Kamaraj]] questioned the possibility of movie stars forming governments.

[[C. N. Annadurai]], the first [[List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu|Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu]] from a Dravidian party, was the forerunner in introducing Dravidian ideologies into movie scripts. Of the movies made by Dravidian politicians ''[[Parasakthi (1952 film)|Parasakthi]]'' (1952) was a turning point, as it was a huge box office hit and made radical comments against the social hierarchy set by the [[caste system]] and glorified the [[Dravidian movement]]. [[M. Karunanidhi]],former Chief Minister, scripted the screen play for ''Parasakthi'', in which [[Sivaji Ganesan]] and [[S.S.Rajendran]], two founding members of the DMK, made their screen debuts.

Movies produced by the DMK Party received severe censorship from the then ruling Congress government. According to [[Murasoli Maran]], a former Union Minister from DMK, the censors would remove parts of the movies, so that the coherence of the screen play was lost, making the movies a box office failure. The script writers used equivocating phrases and words to evade the censorship.

Five out of seven chief ministers from Dravidian parties were actively involved in Tamil cinema either as writers or as actors. [[M. G. Ramachandran]] was the most successful. He launched his own Dravidian party after personal differences with the leaders of DMK, and rose to power as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu mostly with the help of his movie fans and low level cadres. The legacy of politics in Tamil filmdom still continues, though less prominently than in the 1950s to 1970s.

Although a few stars from other [[South India|southern states]] have tried to use film popularity as a stepping stone in politics, such as [[N. T. Rama Rao]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]), [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]] ([[Karnataka]]) and [[Prem Nazir]] ([[Kerala]]), it was in Tamil Nadu that it was most prominent, with five of the seven Chief Ministers from Dravidian parties hailing from the Tamil film industry.<ref name=Dickey/><ref name=Prasad/> In a state such as Tamil Nadu, where no single caste is predominant, film stars were considered people with wide acceptability to lead.<ref name=Dickey/> According to Emeritus Professor K.

Early Tamil films were mainly based on mythological stories, and movies based on contemporary society started only in 1936.<ref name=Hardgrave/> With the end of the era of [[silent movies]] in the 1930s many stage actors joined the Tamil cinema, and brought the ideologies of [[Gandhian]] philosophies with them.<ref name=Dickey/>
Although the Congress party made use of movie stars such as [[K. B. Sundarambal]] to appear at political meetings, some congressmen of that era looked upon movie media with contempt. Tamil Congress leaders like [[C. Rajagopalachari]] considered movie media to be a source of moral corruption.<ref name=Hardgrave/> [[K. Kamaraj]], then president of the All India Congress, mocked DMK's desire to get into power in this statement: {{cquote|How can there be government by actors?.<ref name=Hardgrave/>}}

Attempts made by some Congress leaders to use stars of Tamil cinema, however minimal, were limited since this media remained inaccessible to the rural population (who were in the majority).<ref name=arch/> The politicising of movies by the Congress virtually stopped soon after [[Indian Independence]] in 1947.<ref name=Dickey/> With the introduction of electricity to rural areas in the 1950s Dravidian politicians could implement movies as a major political organ.<ref name=arch>

</ref> Nevertheless, as the party's political aspirations grew, the movies based on Dravidian social reformation themes were replaced with stories that would enhance star popularity.<ref name=Hardgrave/>

==Censorship in DMK movies==
The initial DMK movies were not victims of censorship since the party was little known to the censors, but as the party gained popularity in mid-1950s censorship became stronger. According to [[Murasoli Maran]] one of the techniques followed by the censors was to make sure that the coherence of the movie was lost so that it was a box office failure. At one point DMK, having had been a target of high censorship, had to move back to stage dramas. But the ''Dramatic Licensing Act'' brought censorship to stage plays as well, and two of Karunanidhi's plays were banned.<ref name=Hardgrave/>

To evade censorship DMK scriptwriters chose to use [[pun]]s and equivocal phrases. The most commonly used pun was ''Anna'' which is the word for ''older brother'' in Tamil and also was the popular name for DMK chief [[C. N. Annadurai]]. When ''Anna'' was praised on screen the audience would break into applause.<ref name=Hardgrave/>

==Script writers of DMK==

</ref> During his initial days with Dravidar Kazhagam, Annadurai wrote dramas which promoted social reforms and non-Brahmin self-respect ideologies. After the formation of DMK, Annadurai, along with [[E. V. K. Sampath]] (Periyar's nephew and one of the founders of DMK) and actor [[K. R. Ramaswamy]], staged several plays promoting Dravidian ideologies. The DMK party's head office was purchased using the money raised through these plays. Annadurai scripted six screen plays in total.<ref name=Hardgrave/>

His first movie was ''[[Nallathambi]]'' (Good Brother, 1948), which starred [[N. S. Krishnan]]. It promoted cooperative farming and the abolition of the [[zamindari system]] of taxation.<ref name=Hardgrave/> His movies such as ''[[Velaikaari]]'' (Servant Maid, 1949) and ''[[Or Iravu]]'' carried the hallmarks of propaganda for Dravidian politics.<ref name=rethink>

''Velaikari'' made direct criticisms of suppressive landlords who were traditionally allied with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Gandhi]].<ref name=Dickey/> When DMK won the elections in 1967, Annadurai served as its first Chief Minister until his death in 1969.

Like that of his political mentor Annadurai, Karunanidhi's movies carried elements of Dravidian political ideologies such as anti-Brahminism and anti Congress Party messages.<ref name=rethink/> Two of the movies that contained such messages were ''[[Panam (film)|Panam]]'' and ''[[Thangarathnam]]''.<ref name=rethink/> The overall themes of the movies were remarriage of widows, [[untouchability]], [[self-respect marriages]], abolition of zamindari and abolition of religious hypocrisy.<ref name=Hardgrave/>

Until 1949-50 Tamil film dialogues were in a Brahminical slang of the Tamil language. Annadurai and Karunanidhi introduced Tamil close to formal language and void of [[Sanskrit]] influence.<ref name=Hardgrave/> According to Professor Robert Hardgrave Jr, the popularity of their movie dialogues made both Annadurai and Karunanidhi "stars in their own right."<ref name=Hardgrave/> After the death of Annadurai, Karunanidhi assumed the office of the Chief Minister in Tamil Nadu, and with intermediate periods of in and out of power, he served his 5th term as the chief minister from 2006-2011.

==Actors from Dravidian parties==

===K. R. Ramaswamy===
K. R. Ramaswamy was a popular Tamil actor of both stage and screen in the 1940s and 50s. He was one of the founding leaders of the DMK and it was his earnings that initially financed the party. A talented singer and actor, he was called a ''Nadipisai Pulavar'' (acting and singing poet) by the popular masses. Improvements in technology in the film industry, including [[Playback singer|playback singing]], along with personal problems ended the career of Ramaswamy. Nevertheless, he was nominated as a member of the Legislative Council (upper house of the State) by Annadurai in recognition of his service to the party.<ref name=Hardgrave/>

===N. S. Krishnan===
{{see also|N. S. Krishnan}}
N. S. Krishnan, or NSK as he was popularly known, was a Tamil comic actor and, as the times then required, a talented singer. He was never officially a member of any Dravidian party, but served the DMK to a great extent. He was one of the few non-Brahmins of his era to be popular in a Brahmin-dominated Tamil film industry. His favourite character to play in the movies was a Brahmin buffoon, which he would also enact in DMK meetings. NSK was highly influenced by the ideologies of Periyar and sowed the seeds of anti-Brahmanism in his scripts. NSK served the cause of DMK so much that the last public gathering Annadurai ever attended was to unveil a statue of NSK at a busy intersession in [[Chennai]].<ref name=Hardgrave/>

===M. R. Radha===
{{see also|M. R. Radha}}
M. R. Radha was a stage actor and was popular through his roles as villain on screen. He was an ardent follower of Periyar and was close to most DMK leaders before they split from Dravidiar Kazhagam. Both Annadurai and Karunanidhi were part of M. R. Radha's troupe at different times and had even acted in his plays.<ref name=Hardgrave/>

===Sivaji Ganesan===
{{see also|Sivaji Ganesan|Parasakthi (1952 film)}}
Sivaji Ganesan is a veteran actor of Tamil cinema. He started his acting career at the age of six and toured with various drama troupes including that of M. R. Radha.<ref name=Hardgrave/> The actor himself was named [[Shivaji]] by Periyar E. V. Ramasami after his role portraying the Maratiya king<ref name=lode/> in a play named ''Chandra Mohan''. In ''Chandra Mohan'' the Maratiya king triumphs over Brahmins and the role of the villainous Brahmin was played by Annadurai himself.<ref name=Hardgrave/>

Sivaji Ganesan made his movie debut in 1952 with [[Parasakthi (1952 film)|Parasakthi]], which opens with a song that glorifies Dravidian culture.<ref name=arch/> Sivaji was a [[Tamil people|Tamil]], whereas at the time he entered the film industry most other major actors were [[Telugus]].<ref name=lode/> He later became one of the founding members of DMK.<ref name=Hardgrave1/> Although it was DMK movies that brought Sivaji to the limelight he found that the responsibilities that the party threw at him limited his acting career. His association with DK and with DMK gave him an [[atheist]]ic reputation that acted as a barrier between him and the religious segment of the audience.<ref name=Hardgrave/> Realising that DMK was no longer an asset to his career, he attacked it as a ''glamour party''<ref name=Hardgrave1>

===S. S. Rajendran===
{{see also|S. S. Rajendran}}
S. S. Rajendran (known popularly as SSR) was initially a theatre artist like Shivaji who starred in many plays for Dravidar Kazhagam. Like Sivaji, he debuted in [[Parasakthi (1952 film)|Parasakthi]]. Being one of the most popular stars of Tamil cinema in the 1950s and 60s, he raised funds for DMK and acted in movies glorifying Dravidian ideologies.SSR was the first elected member of legislative assembly among actors in India in 1962.Personal problems led to a fall in his film career and in politics. Having spent most of his earnings for the party he found himself in a deep financial crisis. His movie career brought another star of DMK, M. G. Ramachandran, to cross swords with him, and his political ambitions brought Karunanidhi against him. Sensing trouble in all quarters SSR made a highly political movie, [[Thangarathinam]], to coincide with the 1967 election campaign to prove his loyalty to the party. The party won a landslide victory in the 1967 general elections, but soon after the elections the animosity between SSR and Karunanidhi deepened. SSR complained of threats to his life and eventually left DMK to join AIADMK along with his old friend MGR. His aspirations as a political stalwart and as a film superstar were overshadowed by M. G. Ramachandran.<ref name=Hardgrave/>

===M. G. Ramachandran===
{{see also|M. G. Ramachandran|Dravidian parties#MGR and split from DMK|l2=AIADMK split from DMK}}
M. G. Ramachandran (popularly known as MGR) was the foremost star for DMK propaganda during its peak and was politically the most successful of any film stars in India.<ref name=Dickey/> MGR had a simple beginning in stage plays at the age of six.<ref name=Hardgrave/> MGR was first invited by Annadurai to star in one of his movies in the 1950s. From then on MGR actively participated in the party's meetings. His films such as ''[[Nadodi Mannan (1958 film)|Nadodi Mannan]]'' (Vagabond King, 1958), ''[[Enga Vitu Pillai]]'' (Son of our House, 1965), ''[[Nam Nadu]]'' (Our Nation, 1969), ''[[Adimai Penn]]'' (Slave Girl, 1969) and ''[[Engal Thangam]]'' (Our Gold or Our Precious, 1970) displayed a stereotypical image of a philanthropic, mundane hero made out of a vagrant who becomes a king.<ref name=arch/>

Unlike other DMK actors, MGR used his screen popularity in social works as well, which included financing the poor, running [[orphanages]] and participating in disaster relief. MGR's movies portrayed him as a friend of the poor and downtrodden.<ref name=Hardgrave/> MGR himself commented {{cquote|My roles have been to show how a man should live and believe.<ref name=Hardgrave/>}}

MGR always acted as a hero and made sure that he was always portrayed in a good light on screen. With the departure of Sivaji Ganesan from DMK, MGR's position within the party grew stronger.<ref name=Dickey/> In contrast to ''[[Parasakthi (1952 film)|Parasakthi]]'', MGR's movies made less reference to social justice but dwelled more on contemporary political scenarios.<ref name=Hardgrave/> The movies typically included references to ''[[Dravida Nadu|Dravida]]'' and MGR would be clad in red and black (the DMK flag colours). In sharp contrast with earlier DMK movies where the overall theme was used for propaganda, in MGR's movies the [[protagonist]] was shown as a representative of the party ideology, who would fight against evil and support the poor.<ref name=Hardgrave/> Thus he played roles that were directly relevant to the filmgoers and displayed himself as a symbol of the fulfilment of their own dreams.<ref name=Prasad/> MGR, however, made sure that his social image, which he gained by independent charity and social works, did not get merged with that of DMK.<ref name=Dickey/>

With his rising popularity with the common man MGR fell into controversy by referring to [[K. Kamaraj]], the Congress leader, as ''My leader''. MGR resigned as a Member of Legislative Council. Soon after, the attendance of his then newly released movie dropped, with DMK supporters boycotting the movie.<ref name=Hardgrave/>
