'''Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin''' ({{lang-rus|<U+041C><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0438><U+043B> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0411><U+0430><U+043A><U+0443><U+043D><U+0438><U+043D>|p=m<U+02B2><U+026A>x<U+0250><U+02C8>il <U+02CC>ba<U+02C8>kun<U+02B2>in}}; {{OldStyleDate|30 May|1814|18 May}} <U+2013> 1 July 1876) was a [[Russia]]n [[revolutionary]], philosopher, and theorist of [[collectivist anarchism]]. He has also often been called the father of [[anarchist]] theory in general.<ref>{{citation|last=Masters |first=Anthony|authorlink=|year=1974|title=Bakunin, the Father of Anarchism|publisher=Saturday Review Press|location=|isbn=0-8415-0295-1}}</ref> Bakunin grew up in Premukhino, a family estate near Moscow, where he moved to study philosophy and began to read the French [[encyclop<U+00E9>distes]], leading to enthusiasm for the philosophy of [[Fichte]]. From Fichte, Bakunin went on to immerse himself in the works of [[Hegel]], the most influential thinker among German intellectuals at the time. That led to his  wholehearted embrace of Hegelianism, as he became bedazzled by Hegel's famous maxim; "Everything that exists is rational". In 1840 Bakunin traveled to [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Berlin]], preparing himself for a professorship in philosophy or history at the [[University of Moscow]].

Bakunin moved from [[Berlin]], in 1842, to [[Dresden]]. Eventually he arrived in [[Paris]], where he met [[George Sand]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Karl Marx]]. He was eventually deported from France for speaking against Russia's oppression of [[Poland]]. In 1849 he was apprehended in Dresden for his participation in the [[Revolutions of 1848|Czech rebellion of 1848]]. He was turned over to Russia where he was imprisoned in [[Peter and Paul Fortress|Peter-Paul Fortress]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. He remained there until 1857, when he was [[exile]]d to a work camp in [[Siberia]]. Escaping to [[Japan]], the [[USA]] and finally ending up in [[London]] for a short time, he worked with Herzen on the journal ''Kolokol'' ("''The Bell''"). In 1863, he left to join the [[January Uprising|insurrection in Poland]], but he failed to reach his destination and spent some time in [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]]. Despite his criminal status, Bakunin gained great influence with the youth in Russia, and all of Europe. In 1870, he was involved in the insurrection in [[Lyon]], which foreshadowed the [[Paris Commune]].

In 1868, Bakunin joined the [[International Working Men's Association]], a federation of [[trade union]] organizations with sections in most European countries. The 1872 [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]] was dominated by a struggle between Marx and his followers who argued for parliamentary electoral participation and a faction around Bakunin who opposed it. Bakunin's faction lost the vote, and he was eventually expelled for supposedly maintaining a secret organisation within the international. The anarchists insisted the congress was rigged, and so held their own conference of the International at Saint-Imier in Switzerland in 1872. From 1870 to 1876, he wrote much of his seminal work such as ''[[Statism and Anarchy]]'' and ''[[God and the State]]''. Despite his declining health, he tried to take part in an insurrection in [[Bologna]], but was forced to return to Switzerland in disguise, and settled in [[Lugano]]. He remained active in the worker's movement of Europe until further health problems caused him to be moved to a hospital in [[Bern]], where he died in 1876.

==Biography==
===Early years===
In the spring of 1814, Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin "was born to a noble family of only modest means",<ref name=Sale>[[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale, Kirkpatrick]] (2006-11-06) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2006/nov/06/00031/ An Enemy of the State], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> the family owned only 500 serfs,<ref>{{Citation|last=Bakunin|first=Michael|title=Statism and Anarchy|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=x|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ffXU01KzRNQC|editor=Marshall Shatz|format=Translation into English with introduction by the editor|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-0-521-36973-2}}</ref>  in the village of [[Pryamukhino]] (<U+041F><U+0440><U+044F><U+043C><U+0443><U+0445><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E>) between [[Torzhok]] (<U+0422><U+043E><U+0440><U+0436><U+043E><U+043A>) and [[Kuvshinovo]] (<U+041A><U+0443><U+0432><U+0448><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E>), in [[Tver]] [[guberniya]], northwest of [[Moscow]]. His father was a career diplomat who, as a young attache, had lived for years in [[Florence]] and [[Naples]]. Upon his return to Russia, he settled down on his paternal estate where at the age of forty, he married an eighteen-year-old girl from the prominent [[Muraviev]] family. Given to liberal ideas, he was for a while platonically involved with one of the [[Decembrist]] clubs. After [[Nicolas I]] became Tsar, however, Bakunin senior gave up politics and devoted himself to the care of his estate and the education of his children, five girls and five boys, the oldest of whom was Mikhail (Michael).

At the age of 14 Michael left for [[Saint Petersburg]], receiving military training at the Artillery University, "a rigid, anti-Western military school, where he chafed at the arbitrary discipline and the narrow curriculum<U+2014>much less encompassing than the homeschooling he had experienced before."<ref name=Sale/> He was "expelled from school in 1834 for poor grades and assigned to barracks on the Polish frontier."<ref name=Sale/> He was commissioned a junior officer in the [[Russian Imperial Guard]] and sent to [[Minsk]] and [[Hrodna|Gardinas]] in [[Lithuania]] (now [[Belarus]]). That summer, Bakunin became embroiled in a family row, taking his sister<U+2019>s side in rebellion to an unhappy marriage. Though his father wished him to continue in either the military or the civil service, Bakunin abandoned both in 1835, and made his way to Moscow, hoping to study [[philosophy]].

===Interest in philosophy===
In Moscow, Bakunin soon became friends with a group of former university students, and engaged in the systematic study of [[Idealist]] philosophy, grouped around the poet [[Nikolay Stankevich]], ''<U+201C>the bold pioneer who opened to Russian thought the vast and fertile continent of German metaphysics<U+201D>'' ([[E. H. Carr]]). The philosophy of [[Kant]] initially was central to their study, but then progressed to [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Fichte]], and [[Hegel]]. By autumn of 1835, Bakunin had conceived of forming a philosophical circle in his home town of Pryamukhino; a passionate environment for the young people involved. For example, [[Vissarion Belinsky]] fell in love with one of Bakunin<U+2019>s sisters. Moreover, by early 1836, Bakunin was back in Moscow, where he published translations of Fichte<U+2019>s ''Some Lectures Concerning the Scholar's Vocation'' and ''The Way to a Blessed Life'', which became his favorite book. With Stankevich he also read [[Goethe]], [[Schiller]], and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]].

He became increasingly influenced by [[Hegel]] and provided the first [[Russian language|Russian]] translation of his work. During this period he met [[slavophile]] [[Konstantin Aksakov]], [[Pyotr Chaadayev|Piotr Tschaadaev]] and the socialists [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Nikolay Ogarev]]. In this period he began to develop his [[pan-slavism|panslavic]] views.  After long wrangles with his father, Bakunin went to [[Berlin]] in 1840.  His stated plan at the time was still to become a university professor (a <U+201C>priest of truth,<U+201D> as he and his friends imagined it), but he soon encountered and joined students of the "Young Hegelians" and the [[socialism|socialist]] movement in Berlin. In his 1842 essay ''The Reaction in Germany'', he argued in favor of the revolutionary role of negation, summed up in the phrase "the passion for destruction is a creative passion."<ref>Bakunin, Mikhail (1842). "[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1842/reaction-germany.htm The Reaction in Germany]". In: [[Sam Dolgoff]] (1971, 1980), ''Bakunin on Anarchy''.</ref>

After three semesters in Berlin, Bakunin went to [[Dresden]] where he became friends with [[Arnold Ruge]]. Here he also read [[Lorenz von Stein]]'s ''Der Sozialismus und Kommunismus des heutigen Frankreich'' and developed a passion for [[socialism]]. He abandoned his interest in an academic career, devoting more and more of his time to promoting [[revolution]]. The Russian government, becoming aware of this activity, ordered him to return to Russia. On his refusal his property was confiscated. Instead he went with [[Georg Herwegh]] to [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], [[Switzerland]].

===Switzerland, Brussels, Prague, Dresden and Paris===
[[File:Young Bakunin.jpg|thumb|upright|The young Mikhail Bakunin, illustrated in 1843.]]
During his six month stay in Z<U+00FC>rich, he became closely associated with [[Germany|German]] [[communist]] [[Wilhelm Weitling]].
Until 1848 he remained on friendly terms with the German communists, occasionally calling himself a communist and writing articles on communism in the ''Schweitzerische Republikaner''. He moved to [[Geneva]] in western Switzerland shortly before Weitling's arrest. His name had appeared frequently in Weitling's correspondence seized by the police. This led to reports being circulated to the imperial police. The Russian ambassador in Bern ordered Bakunin to return to Russia, but instead he went to [[Brussels]], where he met many leading [[Poland|Polish]] nationalists, such as [[Joachim Lelewel]], co-member with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] at Brussels. Lelewel greatly influenced him, however he clashed with the Polish nationalists over their demand for a historic [[Poland]] based on the borders of 1776 (before the [[Partitions of Poland]]) as he defended the right of autonomy for the non-Polish peoples in these territories. He also did not support their [[clericalism]] and they did not support his calls for the emancipation of the [[peasantry]].

In 1844 Bakunin went to Paris, then a centre of the European political current. He established contacts with [[Karl Marx]] and the anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who greatly impressed him and with whom he formed a personal bond.  In December 1844, Emperor Nicholas issued a decree stripping Bakunin of his privileges as a [[nobility|noble]], denying him civil rights, confiscating his land in Russia, and condemning him to lifelong exile in [[Siberia]] should the Russian authorities ever get their hands on him. He responded with a long letter to ''La R<U+00E9>forme'', denouncing the Emperor as a despot and calling for democracy in Russia and Poland (Carr, p.&nbsp;139). In March 1846 in another letter to the ''Constitutionel'' he defended [[Poland]], following the repression of [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] there. Some Polish refugees from [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], following the defeat of the [[Krak<U+00F3>w Uprising|uprising]] there, invited him to speak<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1847/poland-speech.htm On the 17th Anniversary of the Polish Insurrection of 1830], Mikhail Bakunin, La R<U+00E9>forme, December 14, 1847</ref> at the meeting in November 1847 commemorating the Polish [[November Uprising]] of 1830.

In his speech, Bakunin called for an alliance between the Polish and Russian peoples against the Emperor, and looked forward to "the definitive collapse of despotism in Russia." As a result, he was expelled from France and went to Brussels.  Bakunin's attempt to draw [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Vissarion Belinsky]] into conspiratorial action for revolution in Russia fell on deaf ears. In [[Brussels]], Bakunin renewed his contacts with revolutionary Poles and Karl Marx. He spoke at a meeting organised by Lelewel in February 1848 about a great future for the Slavs, whose destiny was to rejuvenate the [[West]]ern world. Around this time the Russian embassy circulated rumours that Bakunin was a Russian agent who had exceeded his orders.

As the [[revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movement of 1848]] broke out, Bakunin was ecstatic, despite disappointment that little was happening in Russia. Bakunin obtained funding from some socialists in the Provisional Government, [[Ferdinand Flocon]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin]] and [[Albert L'Ouvrier]], for a project for a Slav federation liberating those under the rule of [[Prussia]], [[Austro-Hungary]] and [[Turkey]]. He left for Germany travelling through [[Baden]] to [[Frankfurt]] and [[K<U+00F6>ln]].

Bakunin supported the [[German Democratic Legion]] led by Herwegh in an abortive attempt to join [[Friedrich Hecker]]'s insurrection in [[Baden]]. He broke with Marx over the latter's criticism of Herwegh. Much later in 1871 Bakunin was to write: ''<U+201C>I must openly admit that in this controversy Marx and Engels were in the right. With characteristic insolence, they attacked Herwegh personally when he was not there to defend himself. In a face-to-face confrontation with them, I heatedly defended Herwegh, and our mutual dislike began then.<U+201D>''<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/bakunin.htm Michael Bakunin A Biographical Sketch] by [[James Guillaume]]</ref>

Bakunin went on to Berlin, but was stopped from going to [[Pozna<U+0144>|Posen]] by the police, which was part of [[Poland|Polish]] territories gained by [[Prussia]] in the [[Partitions of Poland]], where a nationalist [[Wielkopolska Uprising (1848)|insurrection]] was taking place. Instead Bakunin went to [[Leipzig]] and [[Breslau]], then to [[Prague]] where he participated in the First Pan Slav Congress. The Congress was followed by an [[May Conspiracy|abortive insurrection]] that Bakunin had sought to promote and intensify but which was violently suppressed. He returned to Breslau, where Marx republished the allegation that Bakunin was an imperial agent, claiming that [[George Sand]] had proof. Marx retracted the statement after George Sand came to Bakunin's defense.

Bakunin published his ''Appeal to the Slavs''<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1848/pan-slavism.htm Appeal to the Slavs], Mikhail Bakunin, 1848, ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.</ref> in the fall of 1848, in which he proposed that Slav revolutionaries unite with Hungarian, Italian and German revolutionaries to overthrow the three major European autocracies, the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Prussia.

Bakunin played a leading role in the [[May Uprising in Dresden]] in 1849, helping to organize the defense of the barricades against Prussian troops with [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Wilhelm Heine]]. He was captured in [[Chemnitz]] and held for thirteen months before being condemned to death by the government of [[Saxony]]. As the governments of Russia and Austria were also after him, his sentence was commuted to life. In June 1850, he was handed over to the Austrian authorities. Eleven months later he received a further death sentence, but this too was commuted to life imprisonment. Finally, in May 1851, Bakunin was handed over to the Russian authorities.

[[Richard Wagner]] wrote in his diary about Bakunin's visit:<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/wglf110.txt |title=My Life <U+2014> Volume 1 |author=Richard Wagner |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>

{{Cquote|First of all, however, with the view of adapting himself to the most Philistine culture, he had to submit his huge beard and bushy hair to the tender mercies of the razor and shears. As no barber was available, Rockel had to undertake the task. A small group of friends watched the operation, which had to be executed with a dull razor, causing no little pain, under which none but the victim himself remained passive. We bade farewell to Bakunin with the firm conviction that we should never see him again alive. But in a week he was back once more, as he had realised immediately what a distorted account he had received as to the state of things in Prague, where all he found ready for him was a mere handful of childish students. These admissions made him the butt of Rockel's good-humoured chaff, and after this he won the reputation among us of being a mere revolutionary, who was content with theoretical conspiracy. Very similar to his expectations from the Prague students were his presumptions with regard to the Russian people. }}

===Imprisonment, "confession", and exile===
Bakunin was taken to the notorious [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]. At the beginning of his captivity, Count [[Orlov]], an emissary of the Emperor, visited Bakunin and told him that the Emperor requested a written [[confession]]<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1851/confession.htm Confession to Tsar Nicholas I], Mikhail Bakunin, 1851</ref> hoping that the confession would place Bakunin spiritually as well as physically in the power of the Russian state. Since all his acts were known, he had no secrets to reveal, and so he decided to write to the Emperor:

{{Cquote|You want my confession; but you must know that a penitent sinner is not obliged to implicate or reveal the misdeeds of others. I have only the honor and the conscience that I have never betrayed anyone who has confided in me, and this is why I will not give you any names.}}

After three years in the underground dungeons of the Fortress of St Peter and St Paul, he spent another four years in the castle of [[Shlisselburg]]. It was here that he suffered from [[scurvy]] and all his teeth fell out as a result of the appalling diet. He later recounted that he found some relief in mentally re-enacting the legend of [[Prometheus]]. His continuing imprisonment in these awful conditions led him to entreat his brother to supply him with poison.
[[File:Mikhail Bakunin and Antonia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mikhail Bakunin and Antonia Kwiatkowska, circa 1861]]

Following the death of Nicholas I, the new Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] personally struck Bakunin's name off the amnesty list. In February 1857 his mother's pleas to the Emperor were finally heeded and he was allowed to go into permanent exile in the western Siberian city of [[Tomsk]]. Within a year of arriving in Tomsk, Bakunin married Antonia Kwiatkowska, the daughter of a Polish merchant. He had been teaching her French. In August 1858 Bakunin received a visit from his second cousin, General Count [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]], who had been governor of Eastern [[Siberia]] for ten years.

Muravyov was a liberal and Bakunin, as his relative, became a particular favourite. In the spring of 1859  Muravyov helped Bakunin with a job for Amur Development Agency which enabled him to move with his wife to [[Irkutsk]], the capital of [[Eastern Siberia]]. This enabled Bakunin to be part of the circle involved in political discussions centred on Muravyov's colonial headquarters. Resenting the treatment of the colony by the Saint Petersburg bureaucracy, including its use as a dumping ground for malcontents, a proposal for a ''United States of Siberia'' emerged, independent of Russia and federated into a new ''United States of Siberia and America'', following the example of the [[United States of America]]. The circle included Muravyov's young Chief of Staff, Kukel&nbsp;<U+2013> who [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] related had the complete works of [[Alexander Herzen]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the civil governor Izvolsky<!--NOT Alexander Izvolsky-->, who allowed Bakunin to use his address for correspondence, and Muravyov's deputy and eventual successor, General [[Alexander Dondukov-Korsakov]].

When Herzen criticised Muravyov in  ''The Bell'', Bakunin wrote vigorously in his patron's defence.<ref>[http://alternative-anar.ifrance.com/asie/04.pdf ''Bakunin, Yokohama and the Dawning of the Pacific''] by Peter Billingsley</ref>  Bakunin tired of his job as a commercial traveller, but thanks to Muravyov's influence, was able to keep his sinecure (worth 2,000 roubles a year) without having to perform any duties. Muravyov was forced to retire from his post as governor general, partly because of his liberal views and partly due to fears he might take Siberia towards independence. He was replaced by Korsakov, who perhaps was even more sympathetic to the plight of the Siberian exiles. Korsakov was also related to Bakunin, Bakunin's brother Paul having married his cousin. Taking Bakunin's word, Korsakov issued him with a letter giving him passage on all ships on the [[Amur River]] and its tributaries as long as he was back in Irkutsk when the ice came.

===Escape from exile and return to Europe===
On June 5, 1861, Bakunin left [[Irkutsk]] under cover of company business, ostensibly employed by a Siberian merchant to make a trip to [[Nikolaevsk]]{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2011}}. By July 17 he was on board the Russian warship ''Strelok'' bound for [[Kastri]]{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2011}}. However, in the port of [[Olga, Russia|Olga]], Bakunin managed to persuade the American captain of the ''SS Vickery'' to take him on board. Despite bumping into the Russian Consul on board, Bakunin was able to sail away under the nose of the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. By August 6 he had reached [[Hakodate]] in the northernmost Japanese island of [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] and was soon in [[Yokohama]].
In Japan Bakunin met by chance [[Wilhelm Heine]], one of his comrades-in arms from Dresden. He also met the German botanist [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] who had been involved in opening up Japan to [[Europe]]ans (particularly Russians and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]) and was a friend of Bakunin's patron Muraviev.<ref>Edgar Franz, ''Philipp Franz von Siebold and Russian Policy and Action on Opening Japan to the West in the Middle of the Nineteenth Century'', Munich: Iudicum 2005</ref> Von Siebold's son wrote some 40 years later:

{{Cquote|In that Yokohama boarding-house we encountered an outlaw from the Wild West Heine, presumably as well as many other interesting guests. The presence of the Russian revolutionist Michael Bakunin, in flight from Siberia, was as far as one could see being winked at by the authorities. He was well-endowed with money, and none who came to know him could fail to pay their respects.}}

He left Japan from [[Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama|Kanagawa]] on the [[SS Carrington]], as one of nineteen passengers including Heine, Rev. P. F. Koe and [[Joseph Heco]]. Heco was a [[Japanese American]], who eight years later played a significant role giving political advice to [[Kido Takayoshi]] and [[It<U+014D> Hirobumi]] during the revolutionary overthrow of the [[feudal]] [[Late Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa shogunate]].<ref>Joseph Heco (Narrative Writer) [[James Murdoch (born 1856)|James Murdoch]] (Editor), ''The Narrative of a Japanese: What He Has Seen and the People He Has Met in the Course of the Last 40 Years'', Yokohama, Yokohama Publishing Company (Tokyo, Maruzen), 1895, Vol II, pp 90<U+2013>98</ref>  They arrived in [[San Francisco]] on October 15. In the period before the transcontinental railroads had been completed, the quickest way to New York was via Panama. Bakunin boarded the ''Orizaba'' for Panama, where after waiting for two weeks he boarded the ''Champion'' for [[New York]].

In [[Boston]], Bakunin visited [[Karol Forster]], a partisan of [[Ludwik Mieroslawski]] during the 1848 Revolution in Paris, and caught up with other "[[Forty-Eighters]]", veterans of the 1848 revolutions in Europe, such as [[Friedrich Kapp]].<ref>[http://www.robertcutler.org/bakunin/ar88irx2.htm An Unpublished Letter of M.A. Bakunin to R. Solger], Robert M. Cutler, International Review of Social History 33, no. 2 (1988): 212<U+2013>217</ref> He then sailed for [[Liverpool]] arriving on December 27. Bakunin immediately went to London to see Herzen. That evening he burst into the drawing-room where the family was having supper. "What! Are you sitting down eating oysters! Well! Tell me the news. What is happening, and where?!"{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Relocation to Italy===
Having re-entered Western Europe, Bakunin immediately immersed himself in the revolutionary movement. In 1860, while still in [[Irkutsk]] Bakunin and his political associates had been greatly impressed by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and his expedition to [[Two Sicilies|Sicily]], during which he  declared himself [[dictator]] in the name of [[Victor Emmanuel II]]. Following his return to London, he wrote to Garibaldi on 31 January 1862:
:If you could have seen as I did the passionate enthusiasm of the whole town of Irkutsk, the capital of Eastern Siberia, at the news of your triumphal march across the possession of the mad king of [[Naples]], you would have said as I did that there is no longer space or frontiers.<ref>"Bakunin, Garibaldi e gli affari slavi 1862 - 1863" by Pier Carlo Massini and Gianni Bosio, ''Movimento Operaio'' year 4, No. 1 (Jan-Feb, 1952), p81</ref>
Bakunin asked Garibaldi to participate in a movement encompassing Italians, Hungarians and [[South Slavs]] against both [[Austria]] and [[Turkey]]. Garibaldi was then engaged in preparations for the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Expedition against Rome|Expedition against Rome]]. By May Bakunin's correspondence was focussing on Italian-Slavic unity and the developments in [[Poland]]. By June, he had resolved to move to Italy, but was waiting for his wife to join him. When he left for Italy in August, [[Mazzini]] wrote to Maurizio Quadrio, one of his key supporters that Bakunin was a good and dependable person. However, with the news of the failure at [[Battle of Aspromonte|Aspromonte]] Bakunin paused in Paris where he was briefly involved with [[Ludwik Mieros<U+0142>awski]]. However Bakunin rejected Mieroslawski's chauvinism and refusal to grant any concessions to the peasants. Bakunin returned to England in September and focussed on Polish affairs. When the Polish insurrection broke out in January 1863, he sailed to [[Copenhagen]] where he hoped to join the [[Polish Legion]]{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2011}}. They planned to sail across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] in the ''SS Ward Jackson'' to join the insurrection. This attempt failed, and Bakunin met his wife in [[Stockholm]] before returning to London. Now he focussed again on going to Italy and his friend Aurelio Saffi wrote him letters of introduction for [[Florence]], [[Turin]] and [[Milan]]. Mazzini wrote letters of commendation to [[Frederico Campanella]] in [[Genoa]] and [[Giuseppe Dolfi]] in Florence. Bakunin left London in November 1863 travelling by way of [[Brussels]], Paris and [[Vevey]] (Switzerland) arriving in Italy on 11 January 1864. It was here that he first began to develop his anarchist ideas.

He conceived the plan of forming a secret organization of revolutionaries to carry on propaganda work and prepare for direct action. He recruited Italians, Frenchmen, Scandinavians, and Slavs into the International Brotherhood, also called the Alliance of Revolutionary Socialists.

By July 1866 Bakunin was informing Herzen and Ogarev about the fruits of his work over the previous two years. His secret society then had members in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, England, France, Spain, and Italy, as well as Polish and Russian members. In his ''[[Catechism of a Revolutionary]]'' of 1866, he opposed religion and the state, advocating the "absolute rejection of every authority including that which sacrifices freedom for the convenience of the state."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1866/catechism.htm Revolutionary Catechism], Mikhail Bakunin, 1866, ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.</ref>
[[File:Bakunin Membership Card.jpg|thumb|right|Bakunin's membership card of the ''League of Peace and Freedom'']]

During the 1867<U+2013>1868 period, Bakunin responded to [[Emile Acollas]]'s call and became involved in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), for which he wrote a lengthy essay ''Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism''<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism], Mikhail Bakunin, September 1867.</ref> Here he advocated a federalist socialism, drawing on the work of Proudhon. He supported freedom of association and the right of secession for each unit of the federation, but emphasized that this freedom must be joined with socialism for: "Liberty without socialism is privilege, injustice; socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality.".....

Bakunin played a prominent role in the Geneva Conference (September 1867), and joined the Central Committee. The founding conference was attended by 6,000 people. As Bakunin rose to speak:

{{quote|the cry passed from mouth to mouth: 'Bakunin!' [[Garibaldi]], who was in the chair, stood up, advanced a few steps and embraced him. This solemn meeting of two old and tried warriors of the revolution produced an astonishing impression... Everyone rose and there was a prolonged and enthusiastic clapping of hands.<ref>[http://struggle.ws/rbr/rbr6/bakunin.html Bakunin's idea of revolution & revolutionary organisation] published by [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in ''Red and Black Revolution'' No.6, Winter 2002</ref>}}

At the [[Bern]] Congress of the League (1868) he and other socialists ([[<U+00C9>lis<U+00E9>e Reclus]], [[Aristide Rey]], Jaclard, [[Giuseppe Fanelli]], N. Joukovsky, V. Mratchkovsky and others) found themselves in a minority. They seceded from the League establishing their own [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy]] which adopted a revolutionary socialist program.

===The First International and the rise of the anarchist movement===
[[File:Bakunin speaking.png|thumb|Bakunin speaking to members of the IWA at the Basel Congress in 1869]]
[[File:Bakunin Grab 02 11.jpg|thumb|Bakunin's grave at the Bremgarten cemetery in Bern]]

In 1868, Bakunin joined the Geneva section of the [[First International]], in which he remained very active until he was expelled from the International by [[Karl Marx]] and his followers at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]] in 1872. Bakunin was instrumental in establishing branches of the International in Italy and Spain.

In 1869, the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy|Social Democratic Alliance]] was refused entry to the First International, on the grounds that it was an international organisation in itself, and only national organisations were permitted membership in the International. The Alliance dissolved and the various groups which it comprised joined the International separately.

Between 1869 and 1870, Bakunin became involved with the Russian revolutionary [[Sergey Nechayev]] in a number of clandestine projects. However, Bakunin broke with Nechaev over what he described as the latter<U+2019>s <U+201C>[[Jesuit]]<U+201D> methods, by which all means were justified to achieve revolutionary ends.<ref>[http://struggle.ws/anarchists/bakunin/writings/nechayev_secret_disagree.html Bakunin to Nechayev on the role of secret revolutionary societies], Mikhail Bakunin, June 2, 1870 letter to [[Sergey Nechayev]]</ref>

In 1870 Bakunin led a failed uprising in [[Lyon]] on the principles later exemplified by the [[Paris Commune]], calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his ''Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis'', he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry and set forth his formulation of what was later to become known as [[propaganda of the deed]]:

{{quote|we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.<ref name="marxists.org">[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis], Mikhail Bakunin, 1870</ref>}}

Bakunin was a strong supporter of the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, which was brutally suppressed by the French government. He saw the Commune as above all a <U+201C>rebellion against the State,<U+201D> and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the State but also revolutionary dictatorship.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/paris-commune.htm The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State], Mikhail Bakunin, 1871</ref> In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International against the Italian nationalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism.

Bakunin<U+2019>s disagreements with Marx, which led to Bakunin<U+2019>s expulsion from the International in 1872 after being outvoted by the [[Marx party]] at the Hague Congress, illustrated the growing divergence between the "anti-authoritarian" sections of the International, which advocated the direct revolutionary action and organization of the workers in order to abolish the state and capitalism, and the [[social democratic]] sections allied with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the working class. Bakunin was "Marx<U+2019>s flamboyant chief opponent" at the Hague meeting, and "presciently warned against the emergence of a communist authoritarianism that would take power over working people."<ref>Verslius, Arthur (2005-06-20) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/jun/20/00023/ Death of the Left?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref>

The anti-authoritarian sections created their own International at the [[Saint-Imier|St. Imier]] [[Anarchist St. Imier International|Congress]] and adopted a revolutionary anarchist program.<ref>''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], Black Rose Books, March 2005</ref> Although Bakunin accepted Marx<U+2019>s [[class analysis]] and economic theories regarding capitalism, acknowledging "Marx<U+2019>s genius", he thought Marx was arrogant, and that his methods would compromise the social revolution. More importantly, Bakunin criticized "[[authoritarianism|authoritarian socialism]]" (which he associated with Marxism) and the concept of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] which he adamantly refused.

{{cquote|If you took the most ardent revolutionary, vested him in absolute power, within a year he would be worse than the [[Tsar]] himself.<ref>Quoted in Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970), pp.25-26.</ref>}}

Bakunin retired to [[Lugano]] in 1873 and died in [[Bern]] on July 1, 1876.

==Thought==
Bakunin<U+2019>s political beliefs rejected governing systems in every name and shape, from the idea of God downwards, and every form of external [[authority]], whether emanating from the will of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] or from universal suffrage. He wrote in ''Dieu et l<U+2019>Etat'' (''God and the State''):<ref name="God and the State">[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html God and the State], Michael Bakunin, 1882</ref>

{{cquote|The liberty of man consists solely in this, that he obeys the laws of nature because he has himself recognized them as such, and not because they have been imposed upon him externally by any foreign will whatsoever, human or divine, collective or individual.}}

Bakunin similarly rejected the notion of any privileged position or class, since

{{cquote|it is the peculiarity of privilege and of every privileged position to kill the intellect and heart of man. The privileged man, whether he be privileged politically or economically, is a man depraved in intellect and heart.}}

Bakunin's political beliefs were based on several interrelated concepts: (1) [[liberty]]; (2) [[socialism]]; (3) [[federalism]]; (4) [[anti-theism]]; and (5) [[materialism]]. He also developed a (resultantly prescient)<ref>{{Citation|author=Noam Chomsky |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1986----.htm |title=The Soviet Union Versus Socialism |publisher=Our Generation |date= |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref> critique of Marxism,  predicting that if the Marxists were successful in seizing power, they would create a party dictatorship "all the more dangerous because it appears as a sham expression of the people's will."<ref>''Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings'', ed. A. Lehning (New York: Grove Press, 1974), page 268</ref>

===Liberty===
By "liberty", Bakunin did not mean an abstract ideal but a concrete reality based on the equal liberty of others. In a positive sense, liberty consists of "the fullest development of all the faculties and powers of every human being, by education, by scientific training, and by material prosperity." Such a conception of liberty is "eminently social, because it can only be realized in society," not in isolation. In a negative sense, liberty is "the revolt of the individual against all divine, collective, and individual authority."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/man-society.htm Man, Society, and Freedom], Mikhail Bakunin, 1871</ref>

===Collectivist anarchism===
{{Libertarian socialism}}
Bakunin's socialism was known as "[[collectivist anarchism]]", in which the workers would directly manage the means of production through their own productive associations. There would be "equal means of subsistence, support, education, and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity, and equal resources and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor."<ref name="Revolutionary Catechism">[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1866/catechism.htm Revolutionary Catechism], Mikhail Bakunin, 1866</ref>

===Federalism===
By federalism Bakunin meant the organization of society "from the base to the summit<U+2014>from the circumference to the center<U+2014>according to the principles of free association and federation."<ref name="Revolutionary Catechism"/> Consequently, society would be organized "on the basis of the absolute freedom of individuals, of the productive associations, and of the communes," with "every individual, every association, every commune, every region, every nation" having "the absolute right to self-determination, to associate or not to associate, to ally themselves with whomever they wish."<ref name="Revolutionary Catechism"/>

===Anti-theologism===
Bakunin argued that "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." Consequently, Bakunin reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish Him."<ref name="God and the State"/>

===Materialism===
Bakunin denied religious concepts of "[[free will]]" and advocated a materialist explanation of natural phenomena: "the manifestations of organic life, chemical properties and reactions, electricity, light, warmth and the natural attraction of physical bodies, constitute in our view so many different but no less closely interdependent variants of that totality of real beings which we call matter" (''Selected Writings'', page 219). The "mission of science is, by observation of the general relations of passing and real facts, to establish the general laws inherent in the development of the phenomena of the physical and social world." However, Bakunin rejected the notion of "scientific socialism," writing in ''God and the State'' that a "scientific body to which had been confided the government of society would soon end by devoting itself no longer to science at all, but to quite another affair... its own eternal perpetuation by rendering the society confided to its care ever more stupid and consequently more in need of its government and direction."<ref name="God and the State"/>

===Social revolution===
Bakunin<U+2019>s methods of realizing his revolutionary program were consistent with his principles. The workers and peasants were to organize on a federalist basis, "creating not only the ideas, but also the facts of the future itself."<ref>{{Citation|author=Mikhail Bakunin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/program.htm#s2 |title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1871 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>
The worker's trade union associations would "take possession of all the tools of production as well as buildings and capital."<ref>{{Citation|author=Mikhail Bakunin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/albert-richard.htm |title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1870 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> The peasants were to "take the land and throw out those landlords who live by the labor of others."<ref name="marxists.org"/> Bakunin looked to "the rabble," the great masses of the poor and exploited, the so-called "lumpenproletariat," to "inaugurate and bring to triumph the Social Revolution," as they were "almost unpolluted by bourgeois civilization."<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx], Mikhail Bakunin, 1872</ref>

===Critique of Marxism===
The dispute between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx highlighted the differences between [[anarchism]] and [[Marxism]]. Bakunin argued<U+2014>against certain ideas of a number of Marxists<U+2014>that not all revolutions need be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", a concept that Vanguardist socialism and Marxist-Leninism incorrectly use to mean what would be described as a "workers democracy", but which also maintains the party as the state during the transition to the Marxist economical system of "anarchism".<ref name=GW158>Woodcock, George (1962, 1975). ''Anarchism'', 158. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. ISBN 0-14-020622-1.</ref>  Bakunin, "who had now abandoned his ideas of revolutionary dictatorship",<ref name=GW158/> insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any "enlightened elite" must only exert influence by remaining "[[invisible dictatorship|invisible]]...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance".<ref name="Struggle.ws">{{Citation|url=http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html |title=Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian? |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression.<ref name=GW158/> Libertarian Marxists argue Marx used the phrase to mean the worker control at the point of production, not a party, would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles.

{{cquote|They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship<U+2014>their dictatorship, of course<U+2014>can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.|Mikhail Bakunin, ''Statism and Anarchism''<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm |title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2 |publisher=Gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>}}

While both social anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, [[egalitarian]] society without [[classlessness|social classes]] and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the [[direct action]] of the masses, culminating in [[social revolution]], and refuse any intermediate stage such as the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists, "anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved."<ref>{{Citation|author=Mikhail Bakunin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm |title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1873 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>

However, Bakunin also wrote of meeting Marx in 1844 that:
{{quote|As far as learning was concerned, Marx was, and still is, incomparably more advanced than I. I knew nothing at that time of political economy, I had not yet rid myself of my metaphysical observations... He called me a sentimental idealist and he was right; I called him a vain man, perfidious and crafty, and I also was right.<ref>Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p14</ref>}}

Bakunin found Marx's economic analysis very useful and began the job of translating ''[[Das Kapital]]'' into Russian. In turn Marx wrote of the rebels in the Dresden insurrection of 1848 that "In the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin they found a capable and cool headed leader."<ref>New York Daily Tribune (October 2, 1852) on 'Revolution and Counter Revolution in Germany'</ref> Marx wrote to Engels of meeting Bakunin in 1864 after his escape to Siberia  saying "On the whole he is one of the few people whom I find not to have retrogressed after 16 years, but to have developed further."<ref>Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p29</ref>

Bakunin was perhaps the first theorist of the "[[new class]]", the intellectuals and administrators forming the bureaucratic apparatus of the state. Bakunin argued that the "State has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls<U+2014>or, if you will, rises<U+2014>to the position of a machine."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===The revolutionary potential of the proletariat and the ''lumpenproletariat''===
Bakunin had a view almost opposite of Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the ''[[lumpenproletariat]]'' and the [[proletariat]]<ref>"Both agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the peasants and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion.[http://www.workerscompass.org/marxbakunin2_robertson.html "Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict -- Part Two" by Ann Robertson.]</ref> Bakunin "considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form<U+2014>the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat."<ref>[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn. "The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable" in ''Deleuze, Marx and Politics'']</ref>

==Influence==
Bakunin is remembered as a major figure in the history of anarchism and an opponent of Marxism, especially of Marx's idea of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. He continues to be an influence on modern-day anarchists, such as [[Noam Chomsky]].<ref>Chomsky, Noam (1970). ''For Reasons of State''. New York: Pantheon Books. (See especially title page and "Notes on Anarchism".)</ref> Bakunin biographer [[Mark Leier]] has asserted that "Bakunin had a significant influence on later thinkers, ranging from [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Enrico Malatesta]] to the [[Wobblies]] and Spanish anarchists in the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] to [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[E.P. Thompson]], [[Neil Postman]], and [[A.S. Neill]], down to the anarchists gathered these days under the banner of 'anti-[[globalization]].'"<ref name=Sale/>

==Criticism==
===Violence, revolution, and "Invisible dictatorship"===
{{Main|Invisible dictatorship}}

Bakunin has been accused  of being a closet authoritarian.<ref>McLaughlin, P ''Anarchism and authority: a philosophical introduction to classical anarchism'', page 19, Ashgate Publishing, 2007, says that David Morland makes such a claim in Morland, D ''Demanding the Impossible? Human Nature and Politics in Nineteenth Century Anarchism'', p.78, London, 1997. Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian?, Struggle.ws, http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html, retrieved 2010-9-11 states that the accusation that Bakunin was a secret authoritarian is raised by "Leninists and other Marxists."</ref> In his letter to Albert Richard, he wrote that {{Cquote|[t]here is only one power and one dictatorship whose organisation is salutary and feasible: it is that collective, invisible dictatorship of those who are allied in the name of our principle.}}
However, Bakunin's supporters argue that this "invisible dictatorship" is not a dictatorship in any conventional sense of the word, as Bakunin was careful to point out that its members would not exercise any official political power: {{Cquote|this dictatorship will be all the more salutary and effective for not being dressed up in any official power or extrinsic character.<ref name="Struggle.ws"/>}}
Charles A. Madison claimed that: {{cquote|He [Bakunin] rejected political action as a means of abolishing the state and developed the doctrine of revolutionary conspiracy under autocratic leadership<U+2013> disregarding the conflict of this principle with his philosophy of anarchism. Madison contended that it was Bakunin's scheming for control of the First International that brought about his rivalry with Karl Marx and his expulsion from it in 1872.  His approval of violence as a weapon against the agents of oppression led to nihilism in Russia and to individual acts of terrorism elsewhere<U+2013> with the result that anarchism became generally synonymous with assassination and chaos.<ref name="Madison">{{Citation|author=Madison, Charles A.|year=1945|title=Anarchism in the United States|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=6|issue=1|pages=46<U+2013>66 |doi=10.2307/2707055|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|jstor=2707055}}</ref>}}

Bakunin was also criticized by Marx<ref name="books.google.co.uk">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ta_u2zKfLIkC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=barracks+communism+Nechayev&source=bl&ots=M-cPO9vAiI&sig=CayCLE1bpMjSUF_13VgBVtxhW3s&hl=en&ei=Bi0DS5neDp2hjAf16cymAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=12&ved=0CCMQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&q=&f=false] ''Marxism versus Anarchism'' (2001), p88</ref> and the delegates of the [[International Workingmen's Association|International]] specifically because his methods of organization were similar to those of [[Sergey Nechayev]], with whom Bakunin was closely associated.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Adam |url=http://libcom.org/library/marx-bakunin-question-authoritarianism |title=Marx, Bakunin, and the Question of Authoritarianism |publisher=libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> While Bakunin rebuked Nechayev upon discovery of his duplicity towards him, he did not break completely with Nechayev, as indicated by a June 2, 1870 letter: "Lies, cunning [and] entanglement [are] a necessary and marvelous means for demoralising and destroying the enemy, though ''certainly not'' a useful means of obtaining and attracting new friends." Bakunin continued to defend the young radical he called "my tiger cub," and even advised Nechayev to form a secret society which used "Jesuit methods or even entanglement" against enemy societies and the government. As Bakunin wrote, "societies whose aims are near to ours ''must be forced to merge with our society or, at least, must be subordinated to it without their knowledge'', while harmful people must be removed from them. Societies which are inimical or positively harmful must be dissolved, and finally the government must be destroyed. All this cannot be achieved only by propagating the truth; ''cunning, diplomacy, deceit are necessary.''"<ref>Michael Bakunin, <U+201C>M. Bakunin to Sergey Nechayev,<U+201D> in Michael Confino, ''Daughter of a Revolutionary: Natalie Herzen and the Bakunin-Nechayev Circle'' (London: Alcove Press, 1974), 268. Emphasis added.</ref> Nevertheless, Bakunin began warning friends about Nechayev's behavior.

Others insist, however, that Bakunin never sought to take personal control of the International, that his secret organisations were not subject to his autocratic power, and that he condemned terrorism as counter-revolutionary.<ref>Bakunin, "Program of the International Brotherhood"(1868), reprinted in Bakunin on Anarchism, ed. S. Dolgoff</ref> Robert M. Cutler goes further, pointing out that it is impossible fully to understand either Bakunin's participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] or the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy]], or his idea of a secret revolutionary organisation that is immanent in the people, without seeing that they derive from his interpretation of Hegel's dialectic from the 1840s. The script of Bakunin's dialectic, Cutler argues, gave the Alliance the purpose of providing the International with a real revolutionary organisation.

{{cquote|Marx's advocacy of participation in bourgeois politics, including parliamentary suffrage, would have been proof of [his being a "compromising Negative" in the language of the 1842 "Reaction in Germany" article]. It would have been Bakunin's duty, following the script defined by his dialectic, to bring the [International Working-Men's Association] to a recognition of its true role. [Bakunin's] desire to merge first the League and then the Alliance with the International derived from a conviction that the revolutionaries in the International should never cease to be penetrated to every extremity by the spirit of Revolution. Just as, in Bakunin's dialectic, the consistent Negatives needed the compromisers in order to vanquish them and thereby realize the Negative's true essence, so Bakunin, in the 1860s, needed the International in order to transform its activity into uncompromising Revolution.<ref>Cutler, Robert M., "Introduction" to ''[[The Basic Bakunin: Writings, 1869-1871]]'' (Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1992), p. 27, http://www.robertcutler.org/bakunin/basic/intro.html, retrieved 2010-12-29. Cutler also cites Bakunin's "Letter to Pablo," reproduced in Max Nettlau, ''Michael Bakunin: Eine Biographie'' (London: By the Author, 1896<U+2013>1900), p. 284, where Bakunin maintains that the "powerful but always invisible revolutionary collectivity" leaves the "full development [of the revolution] to the revolutionary movement of the masses and the most absolute liberty to their social organization,... but always seeing to it that this movement and this organization should never be able to reconstitute any authorities, governments, or States and always combatting all ambitions collective (such as Marx's) [''sic'' in the original] as well as individual, by the natural, never official, influence of every member of our [International] Alliance [of Socialist-Democracy]."</ref>}}

===Anti-semitism===
Bakunin was an outspoken [[Anti-Semitism|anti-semite]] and has been severely criticized for this part of his writing.<ref>Paul McLaughlin. ''Mikhail Bakunin: The Philosophical Basis of His Theory of Anarchism''. 2002. ISBN 1-892941-41-4 p. 4</ref> Bakunin used anti-Jewish sentiments during his argument with Karl Marx; he claimed that Marxian [[communism]], along with international banking cartels associated with [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]], was part of Jewish system of global exploitation;

{{Cquote|This whole Jewish world, comprising a single exploiting sect, a kind of blood sucking people, a kind of organic destructive collective parasite, going beyond not only the frontiers of states, but of political opinion, this world is now, at least for the most part, at the disposal of [[Marx]] on the one hand, and of [[Rothschild]] on the other... This may seem strange. What can there be in common between socialism and a leading bank? The point is that authoritarian socialism, Marxist communism, demands a strong [[centralisation]] of the state. And where there is centralisation of the state, there must necessarily be a central bank, and where such a bank exists, the parasitic Jewish nation, speculating with the Labour of the people, will be found.<ref>{{harvnb|Judaica|1950|p=101}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wheen|1999|p=340}}</ref>}}

He has also commented that:

{{Cquote|Marx is a Jew and is surrounded by a crowd of little, more or less intelligent, scheming, agile, speculating Jews, just as Jews are everywhere -- commercial and banking agents, writers, politicians, correspondents for newspapers of all shades; in short, literary brokers, just as they are financial brokers, with one foot in the bank and the other in the socialist movement, and their arses sitting upon the German press. They have grabbed hold of all newspapers, and you can imagine what a nauseating literature is the outcome of it .... Now this entire Jewish world, which constitutes an exploiting sect, a people of leeches, a voracious parasite, closely and intimately connected with another, regardless not only of frontiers but of political differences as well -- this Jewish world is today largely at the disposal of Marx or Rothschild. I am sure that, on the one hand, the Rothschilds appreciate the merits of Marx, and that on the other hand, Marx feels an instinctive inclination and a great respect for the Rothschilds. This may seem strange. What could there be in common between communism and high finance? Ho ho! The communism of Marx seeks a strong state centralization, and where this exists, there the parasitic Jewish nation -- which speculates upon the labor of people -- will always find the means for its existence .... In reality, this would be for the proletariat a barrack-regime, under which the workingmen and the workingwomen, converted into a uniform mass, would rise, fall asleep, work, and live at the beat of the drum. The privilege of ruling would be in the hands of the skilled and the learned, with a wide scope left for profitable crooked deals carried on by the Jews, who would be attracted by the enormous extension of the international speculations of the national banks.<ref>Michael Bakunin: Polemique contre les Juifs, 1872 - http://www.faem.com/david/marx-3b.htm</ref>}}

===Eurocentrism===
His [[Eurocentrism]] manifested itself in his support for Russian [[Colonialism]], particularly as practised by his relative and patron Count [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]] and his indifference to Japan and [[Japan]]ese peasants during and after his brief stay in [[Yokohama]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://libcom.org/library/osugi-sakae |title=Library |publisher=libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> (Japan was regarded as the most prominent revolutionary country in Asia following the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1866<U+2013>1869.) He also advocated a [[United States of Europe]]. All these aspects of his thought however date from before he became an anarchist. Bakunin's conversion to anarchism came in 1865, towards the end of his life, and four years after his time in Japan.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://struggle.ws/rbr/rbr6/bakunin.html |title=Bakunin's idea of revolution and anarchist revolutionary organisation |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>

===Nationalism===
Bakunin stated:

"I feel myself always the patriot of all oppressed fatherlands. . . Nationality. . . is a historic, local fact which, like all real and harmless facts, has the right to claim general acceptance. . . Every people, like every person, is involuntarily that which it is and therefore has a right to be itself. . . Nationality is not a principle; it is a legitimate fact, just as individuality is. Every nationality, great or small, has the incontestable right to be itself, to live according to its own nature. This right is simply the corollary of the general principal of freedom." -Bukunin [quoted by Alfredo M. Bonanno in Anarchism and the National Liberation Struggle, pp.&nbsp;19<U+2013>20]

English translations of Bakunin are generally rare when compared to the comprehensive editions in French (by [[Arthur Lehning]]), Spanish and German. Madelaine Grawitz<U+2019>s biography (Paris: Calmann L<U+00E9>vy 2000) remains to be translated.

The standard English-language biography is by E. H. Carr. A new biography, ''Bakunin: The Creative Passion'', by Mark Leier, was published by St. Martin<U+2019>s Press August 22, 2006, hardcover, 320 pages, ISBN 0-312-30538-9

An eight-volume complete works of Bakunin is to be published at some point in the future by [[AK Press]]; according to [[Ramsey Kanaan]] these will likely be published yearly for eight years in hardcover format.
