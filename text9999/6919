The '''A588''' is a road in [[England]], which runs from [[Poulton-le-Fylde]] to  [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in [[Lancashire]]. It is the primary route serving the [[Over Wyre]] areas of [[the Fylde]].

The road runs a total distance of {{convert|19|mi}}, in a roughly north-easterly direction, and is largely rural in character. It begins in the centre of Poulton-le-Fylde {{nowrap|({{coord|53.8436|-2.9922|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A588 road (southern end)}}),}} and runs {{convert|1|mi}} north-east, as Breck Road, to meet the [[A585 road|A585]] eastbound at the River Wyre [[roundabout]]. After {{convert|0.5|mi}}, it turns north (left) away from the A585, crossing the [[River Wyre]] at [[Shard Bridge]], the last crossing of the river before its estuary. From here the road winds through the Over-Wyre villages of [[Hambleton, Lancashire|Hambleton]], [[Stalmine]] and [[Pilling]] and across the [[marsh]]y land that abuts the Cockerham Sands portion of [[Morecambe Bay]]. At [[Cockerham]], almost {{convert|12|mi}} from Shard Bridge, the road turns to the left, and, as Lancaster Road, runs a further {{convert|6|mi}} north, eventually terminating as it joins the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] by the Royal Lancaster Infirmary {{nowrap|({{coord|54.0416|-2.7969|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A588 road (northern end)}}).}}
