True '''shrimp''' are swimming, [[Decapoda|decapod]] [[crustacean]]s classified in the [[infraorder]] '''Caridea''', found widely around the world in both [[fresh water|fresh]] and [[seawater |salt water]]. Together with [[prawn]]s, they are widely caught and farmed for human consumption.

==Taxonomy==
A number of more or less unrelated crustaceans share the word "shrimp" in their common name. Examples are the [[mantis shrimp]] and the opossum or [[mysid shrimp]], both of which belong to the same [[class (biology)|class]] ([[Malacostraca]]) as the true shrimp, but constitute two different [[order (biology)|order]]s within it, the [[Stomatopoda]] and the [[Mysidacea]]. ''Triops longicaudatus'' and ''Triops cancriformis'' are also popular animals in freshwater [[aquarium|aquaria]], and are often called shrimp, although they belong instead to the [[Notostraca]], a quite unrelated group.

Shrimp are distinguished from the superficially similar [[prawn]]s by the structure of the [[gill]]s,  There is, however, much confusion between the two, especially among non-specialists, and many shrimp are called "prawns" and many prawns are called "shrimp". This is particularly widespread in culinary contexts. In [[Southeast Asia]], the difference between shrimp and prawns is based on size, with larger shrimp being called prawns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_2.cfm?wordid=2863|author=Charmaine Solomon|title=Encyclopedia of Asian Food|publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd.|year=1998|accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref>

==Life cycle of shrimp==
[[Image:Shrimp nauplius.jpg|left|thumb|120px|A [[nauplius (larva)|nauplius]] of a shrimp.]]
Shrimp mature and breed only in a marine [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. The females lay 50,000 to 1 million eggs, which hatch after some 24 hours into tiny [[nauplius (larva)|nauplii]]. These nauplii feed on [[yolk]] reserves within their body and then undergo a [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] into [[zoea]]e. This second larval stage feeds in the wild on [[algae]] and after a few days metamorphoses again into the third stage to become [[mysis|myses]]. At this stage the myses already begin to appear like tiny versions of fully-developed adults and feed on algae and [[zooplankton]]. After another three to four days they metamorphose a final time into postlarvae: young shrimp having all the characteristics of adults. The whole process takes about 12 days from hatching. In the wild, the postlarvae then migrate into [[estuary|estuaries]], which are rich in nutrients and low in [[salinity]]. There they grow and eventually migrate back into open waters when they mature. Adult shrimp are [[benthic]] animals living primarily on the sea bottom.

==Shrimp as food==

{{Cookbook|shrimp}}

Recipes using shrimp form part of the [[cuisine|cuisine]] of many cultures: examples include [[jambalaya]], [[okonomiyaki]], [[poon choi]], [[bagoong]], and [[scampi]].

As with other seafood, shrimp is high in [[calcium]] and [[protein]] but low in [[food energy]]. A shrimp-based meal is also a significant source of [[cholesterol]], from 7&nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] to 251&nbsp;mg per 100&nbsp;[[gram|g]] of shrimp, depending on the method of preparation&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dietaryfiberfood.com/cholesterol-shrimp.php |title=Cholesterol Content in Seafoods |accessmonthday=January 7 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>.

Dried shrimp is commonly used as a flavoring and as a soup base in [[Asian cuisine]]s while fried shrimp is popular in North America. In Europe, shrimp is very popular, forming a necessary ingredient in Spanish [[paella|paella de marisco]], French [[bouillabaisse]], Italian [[cacciucco]], Portuguese [[caldeirada]] and many other seafood dishes.

Shrimp and other [[shellfish]] are among the most common [[food allergy|food allergens]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Common Food Allergens | url = http://www.foodallergy.org/allergens/index.html | publisher = The Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network | accessdate = 2007-06-24 }}</ref>

===Preparation===
Preparing shrimp for consumption usually involves removing the [[Animal shell|shell]], [[tail]], and "sand vein". 

To deshell a shrimp, the tail is held while gently removing the shell around the body.  The tail can be detached completely at this point, or left attached for presentation purposes.  
[[Image:Pandborealisind.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Pandalus borealis]]'']]

Removing the "vein" (a [[euphemism]] for the [[digestive tract]]) can be referred to as "[[devein|deveining]]", though in fact shrimp do not have any real [[vein]]s; they have an [[Circulatory system|open circulatory system]].  The "vein" can be removed by making a shallow cut lengthwise down the outer curve of the shrimp's body, allowing the dark ribbon-like digestive tract to be removed with a pointed utensil.  Alternatively, if the tail has been detached, the vein can be pinched at the tail end and pulled out completely with the fingers.

The shrimp is then rinsed under cold running water.

==Shrimp in aquaria==
[[Image:DSCN8033 1.sized.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese marsh shrimp, ''[[Caridina multidentata ]]'']]Several types of shrimp are kept in home [[aquaria]].  Some are purely ornamental, while others are useful in controlling algae and removing debris.<ref name=kribshrimp>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekrib.com/Fish/Shrimp/|title=Freshwater Shrimp in the Aquarium|Publisher=The Krib|accessdate=2006-07-19|author=Anderson, Joe}}</ref> Freshwater shrimp commonly available for aquaria include the [[Caridina multidentata |Japanese marsh shrimp]] (''Caridina multidentata ,'' also called "Amano shrimp," as their use in aquaria was pioneered by [[Takashi Amano]]), and ghost or glass shrimp (''[[Palaemonetes]] sp.''). Popular saltwater shrimp include the cleaner shrimp ''[[Lysmata amboinensis]]'', the [[fire shrimp]] (''Lysmata debelius'') and the [[Harlequin shrimp]] (''Hymenocera picta'').
