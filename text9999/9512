The bank was founded in 1997 by [[entrepreneur]] [[David B. Becker]], incorporated on October 28, 1998, and opened to the public on February 22, 1999. It is engaged primarily in [[Online banking|online]] [[retail banking]] and investment in [[Security (finance)|securities]]. Services include interest-bearing [[checking account]]s, regular and [[money market]] [[savings account]]s, [[Certificate of deposit|CDs]], [[Individual Retirement Account|IRAs]], [[credit card]]s, and [[Debit card|check cards]]. The bank also offers personal lines of credit, installment loans, real-time transfers between accounts, and the ability to display checking, savings and loan information on a single screen. 

First IB is a privately capitalized institution with over 300 private and corporate investors. On March 21, 2006, the bank consummated a ''Plan of Exchange'' by which the bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, a single-bank holding company.
