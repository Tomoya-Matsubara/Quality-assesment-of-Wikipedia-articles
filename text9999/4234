In [[spaceflight]], the '''attitude control system''' (ACS) or '''attitude determination and control''' (ADAC) system of a [[spacecraft]] consists of equipment to measure, report and change the orientation of the vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-2.html |title=Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystems (AACS) |publisher=JPL}}</ref>

== Components ==
Some components of the attitude control system include:

* [[Momentum wheel]]s
* [[Reaction wheel]]s
* [[Control moment gyroscope]]s
* [[Reaction control system]]s

Attitude sensors such as [[gyroscope]]s, [[rate gyro]]s (in spacecraft this is called [[Astrionics]])

*[[Triad Method]]
*[[Orientation (geometry)]]

== Dynamics ==
{{main |Attitude dynamics and control}}
The ACS causes [[torque]]s, which spin the spacecraft. With an accurate model of the [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of the spacecraft, those torques can be used to control the spacecraft's attitude.
