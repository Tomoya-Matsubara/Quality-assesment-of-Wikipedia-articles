{{nihongo|'''Miyao Castle'''|<U+5BAE><U+5C3E><U+57CE>|miyao-j<U+014D>}} was a fortification built on the island of [[Itsukushima]] (also known as Miyajima) during the [[Sengoku Period|Age of Warring States]] in [[Japan]].  Although referred to as a [[Japanese castle]], it did not have a donjon (''tenshu'') or serve as the residence of a land-holding noble, and therefore is probably more within the definition of a [[hill fort]], rather than a true [[castle]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kenyon |first= J. |title= Medieval Fortifications |year= 1991 |place= Leicester |publisher= Leicester University Press |isbn= 0-7185-1392-4 }}</ref>  Built by [[M<U+014D>ri Motonari]], Miyao Castle was part of a greater plan to bait and trap his enemy, [[Sue Harukata]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Miyajima]] in 1555.

The site of Miyao castle is located in Hamano-cho on the island of [[Miyajima]], [[Hatsukaichi, Hiroshima|Hatsukaichi city]], [[Hiroshima Prefecture]].

==Background==
In 1551, Sue Harukata revolted against his lord <U+014C>uchi Yoshitaka, forcing him to commit seppuku. Sue effectively led the <U+014C>uchi family and its armies, which ruled over [[Aki Province]].  In 1554, M<U+014D>ri Motonari, as a fellow vassal of the <U+014C>uchi clan, took up arms against Sue.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Turnbull |first=Stephan|title=The Samurai Sourcebook|year=1998|place=London|publisher=Cassell}}</ref> The heavily outnumbered M<U+014D>ri force attacked and defeated Sue at the [[Battle of Oshikibata]]. M<U+014D>ri later departed from the mainland to build Miyao Castle on [[Itsukushima]], popularly known as Miyajima.<ref name=miyajima>{{Citation | last = West  | first = C.E. | author-link =   | last2 = Seal  | first2 = F.W.  | author2-link =   | title = Battle of Miyajima  | place =   | publisher =  The Samurai Archives| year = 2005 | url = http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Battle_of_Miyajima  | accessdate = 19 Dec 2010}}</ref>

==Castle construction==
As site for Miyao Castle, M<U+014D>ri Motonari selected a 30-meter hill called {{nihongo|Yougai-san|<U+8981><U+5BB3><U+5C71>}} in the northwest corner of the island, near the [[Itsukushima Shrine|main shrine]] and overlooking the channel between Miyajima and the mainland.  Miyao Castle was designed as a {{nihongo|[[Japanese castle#Architecture and defenses|Hill-on-Plains castle]]|<U+5E73><U+5C71><U+57CE>|hirayamajiro}} <ref>{{Cite book|last= Hirai|first=Kiyoshi|title=Feudal Architecture of Japan|year=1974|place=New York|publisher=Art Media Resources|isbn= 0834810158}}</ref> on a piece of land at the foot of steep-sided mountains, including the 535-meter [[Mount Misen (Miyajima)|Mount Misen]].<ref name=j-castles>{{cite book | title=Japanese Castles| last=Motoo| first=Hinago| year=1986| pages= 200 pages| publisher=Kodansha| location=Tokyo| id=ISBN 0-87011-766-1}}</ref>  The castle area could be approached by sea on three sides.  Thus, Miyao Castle was intended to be highly visible and fairly vulnerable.

The castle was hastily built with the forthcoming battle in mind.  About 1,000 laborers were employed, and it took them about one month to build it to Motonari's satisfaction.  Stone walls had to be built in order to buttress the weakly tamped earthen foundation which, without support, would have easily collapsed.  A permanent donjon (''tenshu'') was probably never built.<ref name=j-castles/>

==Battle of Miyajima==
When construction of Miyao Castle was complete, Motonari departed for the mainland, leaving a small garrison to defend the castle.  In late September 1555, Sue Harukata took the bait, attacked, and took the castle with overwhelming force.<ref name=miyajima/>  Within days, Motonari and his allies maneuvered into their respective positions and [[Battle of Miyajima|stormed Miyao Castle]] from three sides.  While a landing force approached from the sea, two other groups had landed on the other side of the island, travelled overland, and attacked the castle from behind.<ref name=miyajima/>  Although Motonari's forces were heavily outnumbered, he knew the land and the castle's weaknesses, and thus had the tactical advantage as well as the element of surprise.  Motonari's forces were able to kill, capture, or scatter the occupying defenders and re-take the castle.<ref name=miyajima/>  The battle became an important milestone in the history of western Japan.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sansom |first= George | title= A History of Japan: 1334-1615 | year= 1961 |location= Stanford, California |publisher= Stanford University Press}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
No records specify what was done with Miyao Castle after the [[Battle of Miyajima]].<ref name=j-castles/>  It was poorly built to begin with, a temporary fortification intended as bait in an elaborate trap.  Of further consideration is the fact that Miyao Castle was built on sacred ground, and the ensuing battle was itself an act of desecration in a place where neither birth nor death are supposed to occur.  Following the battle, resident [[Shinto]] priests conducted elaborate ceremonies in order to remove the pollution of death.<ref name=miyajima/>  Therefore, it is generally believed that Miyao Castle was abandoned by the M<U+014D>ri clan.<ref name=j-castles/>  The site was probably plundered for its stones and lumber, to be used as construction materials elsewhere.

The site of Miyao Castle is now a small park on top of Yougai Hill.  There is an explanatory signboard and a small shrine there.  The hill is bounded on all sides by residences, shops restaurants, hotels, and ''[[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]]''; access to the park is via two staircases on opposite sides of the hill, one of which is very near the ferry docks.  The Miyao Castle site is given little or no attention in the tourist literature of Itsukushima<ref>{{Cite |title=Miyajima Guide Map|year=2009|publisher=Miyajima Tourist Association|url= http://www.miyajima.or.jp/english/map/map_guide.html |accessdate= 19 Dec 2010}}</ref>, and so it is rarely visited.
