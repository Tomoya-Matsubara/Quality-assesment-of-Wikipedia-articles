Oberleutnant (later Generalmajor) Oskar Freiherr von Boenigk (25 August 1893 - 30 January 1946) began his military career during [[World War I]] as a fighter ace credited with 26 victories. He survived the war, served in the post-war revolution, and eventually rose to the rank of Generalmajor in the [[Luftwaffe]] during [[World War II]].<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/boenigk.php</ref>
==Early life and infantry service==
Oskar von Boenigk was born into a military family, being the son of an army officer. He began his military career by being commissioned into the 11th Grenadier Regiment on 22 March 1912. He was immediately assigned as a platoon leader,<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/boenigk.php</ref> serving in that capacity until 23 October 1914. It was during this tenure, on 23 September 1914, that he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] Second Class.

On 24 October 1914, he was promoted to company commander while carrying the simultaneous position of Ordnance Officer. He remained in these posts until 19 December 1915, when he transferred to aviation training.<ref>http://www.geocities.com/%7Eorion47/</ref>

==World War I aviation service==
Boenigk trained with the 7th Flying Replacement Battalion from 20 December 1915 through 29 February 1916. Upon graduation from this observer training, he was assigned to Royal Bavarian [[Jagdstaffel 32]].<ref>http://www.geocities.com/%7Eorion47/</ref> He flew in the back seat of a [[Roland D.II]] fighter<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/germany/jasta/jasta32.php</ref> as a gunner.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/germany/roland_d2.php</ref> His duty with Jasta 32 lasted from 1 March 1916 through 6 April 1917. This tour ended when he returned to the 7th Flying Replacement Battalion for training as a fighter pilot.

''Jastaschule'' lasted from 7 April 1917 until 23 June 1917.<ref>http://www.geocities.com/%7Eorion47/</ref> Upon graduation, he was assigned to Royal Prussian [[Jagdstaffel 4]],<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/boenigk.php</ref> which was becoming part of Germany's first fighter wing, [[Jagdeschwader I]].<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/germany/jg/jg1.php</ref> His arrival in Jasta 4 was coincidental with that of his commanding officer, Oberleutnant [[Kurt von Doering]].<ref>http://www.geocities.com/%7Eorion47/</ref><ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/germany/jasta/jasta4.php</ref> The two of them would serve under Germany's ace of aces, [[Manfred von Richthofen]], who would be appointed to command the newly formed JG I on 26 July.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/germany/jg/jg1.php</ref>

Von Boenigk scored his first aerial victory on 20 July 1917. By 9 September, when he scored his fifth and final victory for Jasta 4, he was an ace, even without credit for two unconfirmed claims.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/boenigk.php</ref> He would serve as a pilot in Jasta 4 for four months, before being promoted to command [[Jagdstaffel 21]] on 23 October 1917. He would command Jasta 21 until 27 August 1918<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/germany/jasta/jasta21.php</ref>

He scored win number six for his new squadron, on 25 November 1917, then lapsed for six months. When he resumed scoring on 1 June 1918, he began a steady trickle of triumphs, with six victims in June, four in July, and five in August. He notched number 21 on 11 August 1918.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/boenigk.php</ref>

He would then be promoted on 28 August to lead [[Jagdschwader II]], and would hold that position until 27 December 1918, after the end of the War.<ref>http://www.geocities.com/%7Eorion47/</ref> He shot down his last five opponents in ten days in September 1918.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/boenigk.php</ref>

In October 1918, he was awarded the [[Ducal Saxe-Ernestine House Order]]<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/medals/germany/saxe_eho.php</ref> and [[Order of Albert]].<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/medals/germany/saxony_oa.php</ref> On 25 October 1918, he was awarded Germany's premier award for courage, the [[Pour le Merite]].<ref>http://www.pourlemerite.org/</ref>

His final tabulation was 14 enemy fighters confirmed downed, along with 2 unconfirmed. He also shot down seven observation balloons; balloons were usually well-defended and difficult to bring down. There were also five two-seaters to his credit.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/boenigk.php</ref>

==Between the wars==

Von Boenigk transferred to command of the 418th Volunteer Flying Battalion on 28 December 1918, operating in Border Protection East, until 17 September 1919. There was a short-lived assignment to lead the 202nd Fighter Wing, which ended after only twelve days. Then he returned to his original unit, the 11th Grenadiers, and was retired on 31 March 1920. He was promoted to Hauptmann (captain) just before his discharge.

From 1 July 1924 through 30 November 1933, he held executive office in the German Front-Line Soldiers Union. He then held a short appointment as director of  the Voluntary Working Service, this ending on 30 June 1934.

He returned to aviation duty on 1 July 1934, being accepted as a Major in the [[Luftwaffe]]. His first assigment was as Commander of the German Transport Flying School in Cottbus. It was the first of several assignments to flying schools that ran through 29 December 1939.
