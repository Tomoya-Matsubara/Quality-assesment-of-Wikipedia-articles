'''George Richard Moscone''' ([[November 24]], [[1929]]&ndash;[[November 27]], [[1978]]) (pronounced "mos-''cone''-ee") was the [[List of Mayors of San Francisco, California|mayor]] of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]] from January 1976 until his [[assassination]] in November 1978. 

==Background==
Moscone was born in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]]. His father was a [[San Quentin State Prison]] guard and his mother a [[homemaker]]. Moscone attended [[University of the Pacific]] and then [[Hastings College of the Law]], where he got his law degree. While in college, Moscone befriended [[John Burton]], who would later become a [[US Congressman]]. During this time Moscone also met and married his wife, Gina. The Moscones would go on to have four children.

==Career==
===Early politics===
[[John Burton]]'s brother, [[Phillip Burton|Phillip]], a member of the [[California State Assembly]] recruited Moscone to run for an Assembly seat in 1960 as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]. Though he lost that race, Moscone would go on to win a seat on the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] in 1963. On the Board, Moscone was known for his defense of the poor, racial [[minorities]] and small business owners. In 1966 Moscone ran for and won a seat in the [[California State Senate]].  Moscone was quickly rising through the ranks of the [[California Democratic Party]] and became closely associated with a loose alliance of [[Progressivism|progressive]] politicians in San Francisco led by the Burton brothers. This alliance was known as the [[Burton Machine]] and included John Burton, Phillip Burton, and Assemblyman [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]].  Soon after his election to the State Senate, Moscone was elected by his party to serve as Majority Leader. He successfully sponsored legislation to institute a [[school lunch]] program for California students. In 1974 Moscone briefly considered a run for [[governor]] of California, but dropped out after a short time in favor of [[California Secretary of State]] [[Jerry Brown]].  Moscone was an early proponent of [[gay rights]], and in conjunction with his friend and ally in the Assembly, Willie Brown, Moscone managed to pass a bill repealing California's [[sodomy]] law.  The repeal was signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown.

===Mayor of San Francisco===
Moscone decided in 1975 to run for Mayor of San Francisco.  In a close race in November of that year, Moscone placed first with [[Conservatism|conservative]] city supervisor [[John Barbagelata]] second and moderate supervisor [[Dianne Feinstein]] coming in third. Moscone and Barbagelata thus both advanced to the mandated [[runoff election]] in December where Moscone narrowly defeated the conservative supervisor. Progressives also won the city's other top executive offices that year as [[Joseph Freitas]] was elected [[District Attorney]] and [[Richard Hongisto]] was re-elected to his office of [[Sheriff]].  Moscone's first year as Mayor was spent preventing the [[San Francisco Giants]] professional [[baseball]] team from moving to another city and advocating a city-wide [[ballot proposition]] in favor of district election to the Board of Supervisors.  Moscone was the first mayor to appoint large numbers of women, gays and lesbians and racial minorities to city commissions and advisory boards. One of his most controversial appointments was that of the Reverend [[Jim Jones]], head of the [[Peoples Temple]], to the city's Housing Commission.  The People's Temple would later be discovered to be a thinly-veiled cult headed by the demagogic and mentally unstable Jones.  Moscone also appointed liberal former [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] Police Chief Charles Gain to head the San Francisco Police Department. Gain (and by extension Moscone) became highly unpopular among rank and file San Francisco police officers for proposing a settlement to a [[lawsuit]] brought by minorities claiming discriminatory recruiting practices by the police force.

During his tenure, Moscone adamantly opposed the construction of the proposed [[Yerba Buena]] convention center, arguing that the massive structures would displace hundreds of longtime [[working class]] residents from the [[SOMA]] neighborhood. Ironically, the convention center, one of the largest in the United States, currently bears his name.

==Assassination==
{{main|Moscone-Milk Assassinations}}
===Background===
In 1977 Moscone, Freitas and Hongisto all easily survived a [[recall election]] pushed by defeated Moscone opponent John Barbagelata and 
business interests. That year also marked the passage of the district election system by San Francisco voters.  The city's first district elections for Board of Supervisors took place in November of 1977. Among those elected were the city's first openly gay Supervisor, [[Harvey Milk]], single mother and attorney [[Carol Ruth Silver]], Chinese-American [[Gordon Lau]] and conservative fireman and former police officer [[Dan White]].  Milk, Silver, and Lau along with [[John Molinari]] and [[Robert Gonzales]] made up Moscone's allies on the Board, while [[Dan White]], [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[Quentin Kopp]], [[Ella Hill Hutch]], [[Lee Dolson]], and [[Ron Pelosi]] formed a loosely organized coalition to oppose Moscone and his initiatives.  Feinstein was elected President of the Board of Supervisors on a 6-5 vote, with Moscone's supporters backing Lau.  It was generally believed that Feinstein, having twice lost election to the office of mayor would support Kopp against Moscone in the 1979 election and retire rather than run for the Board again.  

Early in his term, White was forced to resign his job as a San Francisco fireman due to a provision in the [[city charter]] barring any person from holding two city jobs.  Debate on the Board was sometimes acrimonious with White verbally sparring with Milk and Silver most often. Much of Mayor Moscone's agenda of neighborhood revitalization and increased city support programs was thwarted or modified at this time in favor of the business-oriented agenda supported by the conservative (by San Francisco standards) majority on the Board.  Increased antagonism between Harvey Milk and Dan White also marked this period in the Board's history. Though the reasons are often disputed, White himself cited Milk's vote in favor of placing a group home in White's district as the source of the tension. This event led to White being the only vote in opposition to the historic gay rights ordinance, passed by the Board and signed by Mayor Moscone in 1978.  

Under increased stress due to a failing restaurant business and criticism that he was an ineffectual legislator, White abruptly resigned his office in the fall of 1978.  Many business interests, who depended on White's vote to keep their agenda in favor, pressured him into asking that his resignation letter be returned. Despite White's request, the letter had already been filed and his resignation was effective immediately. Through his power of appointment, Moscone was now the only person who could return White to the Board. Though Moscone considered appointing White back into his Board position, Milk, Silver and several other Moscone allies persuaded the mayor to appoint a progressive to replace White, hoping the shift in power in favor of progressives on the Board would allow Moscone to more easily legislate his agenda.  The dispute over Dan White's Board position was soon overshadowed on [[November 18]], 1978, when more than 900 members of the Reverend [[Jim Jones]]' [[Peoples Temple]] committed suicide on their [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] in [[Jonestown]] [[Guyana]].  Before the suicides, members of the Temple had assassinated San Francisco area Congressman [[Leo Ryan]], who was preparing to leave Jonestown after investigating allegations of abuse at the compound. Also killed in the attack were three journalists and a Temple member who chose to leave with Ryan's party.  The vast majority of the dead were from the Bay area and the city immediately plunged into mourning. Days later, Moscone finally began considering possible replacements for White, ultimately choosing progressive Federal Housing official [[Don Horanzy]]. White was infuriated after learning of Horanzy's pending appointment from a CBS news reporter seeking a comment.

===The assassination===
On Monday, [[November 27]], 1978, the day Moscone was set to formally appoint Horanzy to the vacant District 8 seat, White packed his loaded policeman's service revolver and 10 extra rounds of ammunition into his coat pocket and had an unsuspecting friend drive him to [[San Francisco City Hall]]. Once there, White slipped into City Hall, through a basement window that was often left open, in order to avoid metal detectors. He climbed the stairs to the mayor's office, where Moscone was conferring with [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], then a member of the [[California State Assembly]].

White requested a meeting with the Mayor and was allowed to see Moscone after a short wait. Upon entering the Mayor<U+2019>s outer office, Moscone asked White if he would like a drink. White, confronting the Mayor about his apparent betrayal, asked if he would be re-appointed to his seat on the Board of Supervisors.  When Moscone said no, the two men began what devolved into a heated argument over Horanzy's pending appointment. 

Wishing to avoid a public scene, Moscone suggested they retire to a private lounge attached to the mayor's office so as not to be overheard by those waiting outside. Once inside the small room, and realizing his pleas would prove ineffective, White pulled his revolver and shot the mayor twice in the abdomen. White then shot Moscone twice more in the head, killing him. At least one of the shots was administered [[execution-style]].

White reloaded his weapon and hurried out of the mayor's office, observed by an unwitting [[Dianne Feinstein]], who attempted to engage him in conversation. Shirking off her attempts at conversation, White made his way to the opposite side of City Hall and went further down a corridor to Harvey Milk's office. There, he asked for a private conference in an adjacent room. 

Behind closed doors, White confronted Milk. The two began to argue, and the Supervisor allegedly smirked at White and told him "too bad" about the Horanzy appointment. As White began to scream at Milk, Milk arose from his seat to face White, causing the agitated assailant to pull his gun and shoot the Supervisor multiple times at point blank range; three times in the chest, once in the back and two times again in the head. White fled city hall unchallenged as chaos reigned inside. Milk, discovered by Feinstein, had resuscitation attempted on him, to no avail. 

White later turned himself in at the police station where he was formerly an officer. Even though he had carried a gun, 10 extra rounds, and crawled through a window to avoid metal detectors, White denied premeditation.

The same day Moscone and Milk were assassinated, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] were scheduled to play on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[Monster Park|Candlestick Park]].  There was brief consideration given to postponing the game, but the contest, which kicked off at 6 p.m. local time, went on as scheduled.

Dianne Feinstein, President of the Board of Supervisors, was sworn in as the city's new mayor and in the following years would emerge as one of California's most prominent politicians.

Moscone is interred at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Colma|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Colma, California]].

==Legacy==
Today, both Moscone and Milk are mourned as [[martyr]]s of the gay rights movement.

[[Moscone Center]], San Francisco's largest convention center and exhibition hall, and [[Moscone Recreation Center]] are named in his honor.

Moscone and Milk also have two schools named after them. George Moscone Elementary and Harvey Milk Elementary.

The term "[[Twinkie Defense]]" is said to have its origins in the trial that followed in which Dan White was given a lesser sentence of [[manslaughter]] instead of murder.

In 1980, sculptor [[Robert Arneson]] was commissioned to create a monument to Moscone to be installed in the new Moscone Convention Center.  The bust portraying Moscone was done in Arneson's typically crude and expressionistic style and was considered acceptable by San Francisco's Art Commission.  However, the pedestal which the former Mayor's head rested on was deemed inappropriate and Arneson was asked to change it.  At issue were references to [[Harvey Milk]], the assassinations, the "[[Twinkie Defense]]," the [[White Night Riots]], and [[Diane Feinstein|Diane Feinstein's]] mayoral succession that Arneson had included on the surface of the pedestal.  Arneson refused to make alterations to the work, returned the commission, and later resold the sculpture.
