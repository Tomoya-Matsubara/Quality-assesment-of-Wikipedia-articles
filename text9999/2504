'''''Faryl''''' is the [[debut album]] by British [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Faryl Smith]], released on 9 March 2009 by [[Universal Classics and Jazz]]. Smith rose to fame after her appearance on the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 2)|second series]] of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'', and signed with Universal after the competition. The album was recorded during December 2008 and January 2009 and features the track "River of Light", a song set to ''[[The Blue Danube]]'' with newly-written lyrics. ''Faryl'' was produced by Jon Cohen, and the backing music was provided by a 60-piece orchestra. As part of the album's promotion, Smith made numerous television and radio appearances and filmed a music video for "River of Light". Around this time, she met with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|then-Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] at [[10 Downing Street]].

After its release, ''Faryl'' became the fastest-selling classical solo album in British chart history, selling 20,000 copies in the first four days, and a total of 29,200 copies in the first week, higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. ''Faryl'' entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number 6, rising to number 4 the next week, and was the third album by a ''Britain's Got Talent'' contestant to reach the top ten in Britain. Smith subsequently embarked on a promotional tour in the US to publicise the album, where it reached number 6 on the classical chart.

''Faryl'' was fairly well received by critics, who praised Smith's performances and Cohen's production. However, criticism was directed at the use of the orchestra and at the song choices on the album. As one of the ten best-selling classical albums in the UK in 2009, ''Faryl'' was nominated for a [[Classical BRIT Award]] in the album of the year category.

==Background==
Smith rose to fame when she, aged 12, competed in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 2)|second series]] of [[ITV]] talent show ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''. During the series, she performed "[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]" and a cover of [[Sarah McLachlan]]'s "[[Angel (Sarah McLachlan song)|Angel]]".<ref name="outside">{{cite news |title= Britain's Got Talent: Stunning Faryl misses out on top three|url= http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Britain39s-Got-Talent-Stunning-Faryl.4139996.jp|publisher= ''[[Northampton Chronicle & Echo]]''|date= 31 May 2008|accessdate=8 April 2009 }}</ref> After her initial performance, she received singing lessons from [[Yvie Burnett]], a move criticised by the press.<ref name="secret">{{cite news| last = Gold| first = Laura| url =http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/sunday/2008/05/11/ave-few-lessons-98487-20413646/| title =  Simon Cowell's secret singing lessons for Britain's Got Talent's Faryl Smith | date= 12 May 2008| accessdate = 31 May 2008| publisher = ''[[The Sunday Mirror]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= She's Got Talent: Simon Cowell signs up 12-year-old voice of an angel for VIP singing lessons|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-565923/Shes-Got-Talent-Simon-Cowell-signs-12-year-old-voice-angel-VIP-singing-lessons.html|newspaper= [[The Daily Mail]]|date= 12 May 2008|accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref> Although she was at one point the favourite to win,<ref name="Allmusic"/> she finished outside the top three in the live final.<ref name="outside"/> During the competition, Smith rejected offers of a record deal,<ref name="secret"/> and afterwards rejected offers from [[Sony BMG]], instead signing a <U+00A3>2.3 million, multi-album deal with [[Universal Classics and Jazz]], the most lucrative ever offered to a schoolgirl.<ref name="DM signed">{{cite news |first= Simon|last= Cable|title= 13-year-old Britain's Got Talent finalist turns back on Simon Cowell to sign <U+00A3>2.3m record deal|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1093173/13-year-old-Britains-Got-Talent-finalist-turns-Simon-Cowell-sign-2-3m-record-deal.html|publisher= ''[[Daily Mail]]''|date= 9 December 2008|accessdate=9 December 2008 }}</ref>

==Promotion==
Promotion began in January, with performances by Smith at the [[Mandarin_Oriental_Hotel#The_Mandarin_Oriental.2C_Hyde_Park|Mandarin Oriental Hotel]] and appearances at the debut of the [[Oliver!#2009_revival|''Oliver!'' 2009 revival]].<ref name="Red">{{cite news |first= Monique|last= Cleaver|title= Singer Faryl gets used to red carpet|url= http://www.northantset.co.uk/news/Singer-Faryl-gets-used-to.4891728.jp|publisher= ''[[Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph]]''|date= 20 January 2009|accessdate=20 January 2009 }}</ref> Smith also took part in a photoshoot for publicity and cover photos.<ref name="Red"/> According to writers for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', the cover photo was modified to give Smith "a smile worthy of a model from a [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] advert", due to her "gappy teeth". Though generally critical of the move, the reporter conceded that it was better for Smith's teeth to be digitally straightened, rather than forcing her "to endure a battery of dental surgery".<ref>{{cite news |title= Singing sensation Faryl Smith gets a virtual makeover.... on her gappy teeth|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1189215/Singing-sensation-Faryl-Smith-gets-virtual-makeover---gappy-teeth.html|publisher= ''[[Daily Mail]]''|date= 28 May 2009|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> A television advert and music video for "River of Light" were recorded to further publicise the release, and Smith also appeared on the cover of April's ''[[Classic FM Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite news |first= Richard|last= Marsden|title= Faryl blocked by Posh bodyguards|url= http://www.northantset.co.uk/news/Faryl-blocked-by-Posh-bodyguards.5233785.jp|publisher= ''[[Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph]]''|date= 5 May 2009|accessdate=17 May 2009}}</ref> Further promotion in the weeks leading up to the release of ''Faryl'' included Smith appearing on ''[[Loose Women]]'', ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'', [[BBC Radio 4]], [[Radio Five Live]] and ''[[BBC Breakfast]]''.<ref name="Loose Women">{{cite news|title= Singer Faryl to appear on Loose Women|url= http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Singer-Faryl-to-appear-on.5027628.jp|publisher= ''[[Northampton Chronicle & Echo]]''|date= 2 March 2009|accessdate=2 March 2009 }}</ref> She also appeared at the [[Children's Champion Awards]] and met then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] at [[10 Downing Street]].<ref name="Morgan"/><ref name="Living the Dream"/> On the day of the release, there was an album signing in Smith's hometown of [[Kettering]], at the [[HMV]] branch.<ref name="Foster"/> Smith said "I definitely want to be at home for the launch.

After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, spoke of plans to publicise ''Faryl'' in the US, saying "America is going to be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense."<ref name="Foster"/> In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of ''Faryl'' in the US.

Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well as it did in the UK. She said that "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known.

}}
Reviewers were generally impressed by Smith's performances. Pete Paphides, writing for ''[[The Times]]'', said that the songs were performed "with power and restraint",<ref name="Times review"/> while Johnny Davis, writing for ''[[The Observer]]'', said "[y]ou can practically hear Katherine Jenkins weep as Faryl flawlessly executes Amazing Grace".<ref name="Observer review"/> Jason Birchmeier, writing for [[Allmusic]], considered Smith's performance even more noteworthy because of her young age.<ref name="Allmusic review"/> However, though he considered Smith's voice impressive, Malcolm Mackenzie, writing for ''[[The London Paper]]'', asked "will we care when the kid from Kettering loses her precocious appeal?"<ref>{{cite news |first= Malcolm|last= Mackenzie|title= Taylor Swift, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Vetiver, Polly Scattergood, Faryl and Kelly Clarkson|url= http://www.thelondonpaper.com/staying-in/music/taylor-swift-yeah-yeah-yeahs-vetiver-polly-scattergood-faryl-and-kelly-clarkson|publisher= ''[[The London Paper]]''|date= 20 March 2009|accessdate=16 April 2009 }}</ref> Reviewers were also responded positively to Cohen's contribution to the album. Paphides claimed that his arrangements "suggest some kind of aesthetic endeavour beyond the basic thing for which they exist",<ref name="Times review"/> while Birchmeier claimed that the album was "produced with fine precision".<ref name="Allmusic review"/>

Reviewers were more critical of the use of the orchestra. Helen Sloan, writing for ''Crackerjack'' (''[[Bristol Evening Post]]'') found that the orchestra rendered "the whole thing a bit bland and [[movie-soundtrack]]",<ref name="Crackerjack">{{cite news |first= Helen|last= Sloan|title= Faryl Smith: Faryl (CD)|url= http://www.crackerjack.co.uk/bristol/review/faryl-smith-faryl-cd/music|work= Crackerjack|publisher= ''[[Bristol Evening Post]]''|date= 5 March 2009|accessdate=22 March 2009 }}</ref> and Birchmeier found it to be "a bit overwhelming" by the end of the album.<ref name="Allmusic review"/> Further, he was critical of the inclusion of "Amazing Grace" and "Ave Maria", considering them to be overly predictable song choices. Though he was pleasantly surprised by some of the inclusions (such as "River of Light" and "The Way Old Friends Do"), he concluded that "[i]t's too bad that [Smith] isn't given more creative material to sing. One hopes her next album is more adventurous."<ref name="Allmusic review"/>

Overall, Paphides awarded the album 3 out of a possible 5 stars, and compared it favourably to three other [[Mothering Sunday]] releases, [[Lionel Richie]]'s ''[[Just Go (Lionel Richie album)|Just Go]]'', [[Ronan Keating]]'s ''[[Songs for My Mother]]'' and [[Barry Manilow]]'s ''[[The Greatest Songs of the Eighties]]'', considering it stronger than any of the others.<ref name="Times review"/> Davis also awarded the album 3 out of 5,<ref name="Observer review"/> while Birchmeier was slightly more positive, awarding ''Faryl'' 3.5 out of 5.<ref name="Allmusic review"/>
