[[Image:Copia de Cacicazgos de la Hispaniola.gif|thumb|350px|right|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola]]

The '''chiefdoms of Hispaniola''' (''cacicazgo'' in Spanish) delineated the island of [[Hispaniola]] (''Quisqueya'' in [[Ta<U+00ED>no language|Ta<U+00ED>no]]) into five independent territories at the time of their discovery by the Spaniards in 1492. Each was governed by a [[cacique]] who held absolute power over their people. The [[Ta<U+00ED>no]] inhabitants were of [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] origin and were the first people to greet the Spanish. At the time, the Tainos were being defeated by a rival group, the [[Caribs]]. In 1508, there were about 60,000 Ta<U+00ED>nos in the island of Hispaniola, by 1531 exploitation and disease had reduced the number to 600.

The boundaries of each cacique were clear and precise, the first inhabitants of the island in fact used the natural elements such as references, such as major rivers, high mountains, notable valleys and plains. This made it possible to establish the extent of each territory.<ref>{{es}} [[Bartolom<U+00E9> de Las Casas|Las Casas, Bartolom<U+00E9> de]] (1552),''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'' [http://www.ciudadseva.com/textos/otros/brevisi.htm "Los reinos que hab<U+00ED>a en la isla Espa<U+00F1>ola"]</ref>
Each was divided into ''cacique'' nita<U+00ED>nos, subdivisions headed by the cacique ''helpers''. The entries below relate the territory of each former cacique to the provinces of the present day [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]].

== Chiefdom of Mari<U+00E9>n ==
[[Image:Mari<U+00E9>n.JPG|thumb|300px|right|cacique of Mari<U+00E9>n]]
The '''cacique of Mari<U+00E9>n''' (''cacicazgo of Mari<U+00E9>n'') included the entire northwestern part of Hispaniola, bordered to the north by the Atlantic Ocean, the south by the cacique of Jaragua, east by the caciques of Magu<U+00E1> and Maguana, and west by the [[Windward Passage]].

It was ruled by the cacique [[Guacanagar<U+00ED>x]], with headquarters located in El Guarico, near the present city Haiti of [[Cap-Ha<U+00EF>tien]] . It was divided into 14 nita<U+00ED>nos. This cacique was the first to welcome [[Christopher Columbus]] and to convert to Christianity.

The cacique of Mari<U+00E9>n fought against the cacique [[Mairena]], aided by [[Caonabo]] of the cacique of Maguana for control of the mythical goddess 'Mother' Iermao the cacique of Marien. The 'Mother' Iermao was the goddess of the cacique of Mari<U+00E9>n, which means "body stone".

For this battle, Guacanagar<U+00ED>x allied with the Spanish conquistadors to defeat an alliance of Mairena and Caonabo and thus remain the principal cacique of the whole and the cacique of Mari<U+00E9>n mythical place of Chacuey.

[[Image:Maguana.JPG|thumb|300px|right|cacique of Maguana]]
The cacique of Maguana (''cacicazgo of Maguana'') was the center of the Quisqueya island, bounded on the north by the caciques of Mari<U+00E9>n and Magu<U+00E1>, south by the Caribbean, east by the caciques of Magu<U+00E1> and Hig<U+00FC>ey, and west by the caciques of Mari<U+00E9>n and Jaragua. This cacique only covered the territories of the current Dominican Republic].

It was ruled by the cacique [[Caonabo]], husband of [[Anacaona]]. Its headquarters was established at the place called [[Corral de los Indios]] in [[Juan de Herrera (Dominican Republic)|Juan de Herrera]] of [[San Juan de la Maguana|San Juan]]. It was divided into 21 nita<U+00ED>nos. This province is devoted to the art of war.

This was the principal cacique of the island and was represented by "Peter". The term ''Maguana'' means "the first stone, the unique stone". His mother goddess was apito, which means "Mother of Stone".<ref>{{es}} [http://maguana.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48:historia&catid=36:historia&limitstart=1&Itemid=56 Maguana.net]</ref>

The cacique Caonabo was the first resistance against the Spanish occupation. This chief is accused of being responsible for the destruction of Fort [[La Navidad]], the first Spanish settlement on American soil, installed by [[Christopher Columbus]] to the inability to repatriate all of his men to Spain during his first voyage. Because of this attack and the attempted assault of [[Fort Saint-Thomas]], Caonabo was taken prisoner. [[Alonso de Ojeda]] tricked him into believing that he would offer her golden shackles.{{clarify|date=September 2011}} Caonabo was handcuffed and transferred to [[La Isabela]], then sent to Spain. The chief died in a shipwreck while crossing.<ref>{{es}} [http://www.maguana.net Maguana.net]</ref>

[[Image:Jaragua.JPG|thumb|300px|right|chiefdoms Jaragua]]
The cacique of [[Jaragua, Hispaniola|Jaragua]] (''cacicazgo Jaragua'') spanned the entire south-west of the island of Hispaniola. It was bounded on the north by the cacique of Mari<U+00E9>n, south by the Caribbean, east by the caciques of Mari<U+00E9>n and Maguana, and west by the [[Strait of Jamaica]] .

It was ruled by the cacique [[Bohechio]]. It was the largest of the island. Its headquarters was located in a place called Yaguana, near present-day [[Port-au-Prince]], capital of Haiti. It was divided into 26 nita<U+00ED>nos. 

Bohech<U+00ED>o, brother of [[Anacaona]], was to reside at [[Yaquimo]] within the chiefdoms of Xaragua because it would support a war against two very primitive, the original inhabitants of the island, some being located in the region of rivers [[Rio de Las Cuevas|Las Cuevas]] and [[R<U+00ED>o Yubo|Yubo]] and the other being at the extreme southwest of the island, in a place called [[Guacayarima]]. This required Bohech<U+00ED>o to enter a double alliance, first with the cacique of [[Haniguayagua]] for the control of the Aborigines of South-West and, on the other hand, with [[Caonabo]] for control and access to the ceremonial site of Yubo, the main island.

The mother goddess of the Xaragua cacique was ''Zuimaco'', derived from the union of Xaragua: ''Zui'' and Yaquimo: ''Maco''.
