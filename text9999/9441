{{Nihongo|'''Aikido'''|<U+5408><U+6C17><U+9053>|aikid<U+014D>}}, is a [[Japanese martial art]] developed by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy, and religious beliefs. Aikido is often translated as "the Way of unifying (with) [[Qi|life energy]]" <ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>  Aikido techniques are intended to be implemented after first blending with the motion of the attacker, so that the defender may redirect the attacker's [[momentum]] without directly opposing it, thus using minimum effort. 

Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of [[Dait<U+014D>-ry<U+016B> Aiki-j<U+016B>jutsu]], but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the [[Oomoto|<U+014C>moto-ky<U+014D>]] religion. Many of Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending on when they studied with him.  Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with a broad range of interpretation and emphasis.  However, they all share techniques learned from Ueshiba and a caring for the well-being of the attacker. 

==Etymology and basic philosophy==
The word '''aikido''' is formed of three Japanese characters,
* [[wikt:en:<U+5408>|<U+5408>]] - ''ai'' - joining, harmonizing
* [[wikt:en:<U+6C17>|<U+6C17>]] - ''ki'' - spirit, life energy
* [[wikt:en:<U+9053>|<U+9053>]] - ''d<U+014D>'' - way, path

The term ''d<U+014D>'' connects the practice of aikido with the philosophical concept of ''[[Tao]]'', which can be found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in more peaceful arts such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] (''shod<U+014D>'') and [[ikebana|flower arranging]] (''kad<U+014D>'').  The term ''[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

}}</ref> One applies ''aiki'' by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.  Historically, ''aiki'' was mastered for the purpose of killing; however, in aikido, one seeks to neutralise an aggressor without causing harm.<ref name="ADS"/>  The founder of aikido declared, "To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace."<ref name="AOP">{{cite book

==History==
[[Image:Morihei-Ueshiba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Morihei Ueshiba]], founder of aikido.]]Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba (<U+690D><U+829D> <U+76DB><U+5E73> ''Ueshiba Morihei'', [[14 December]] [[1883]]&ndash;[[26 April]] [[1969]]), referred to by some aikido practitioners as ''[[Sensei|<U+014C>sensei]]'' ("Great Teacher").<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

}}</ref> Ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but also an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation. During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the ''[[kory<U+016B>]]'' (old-style martial arts) that Ueshiba studied into a wide variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.<ref name="Aikido"/>

===Initial development===

[[Image:Sokaku.jpg|thumb|right|Takeda Sokaku]]
Ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late [[1920s]] through the [[1930s]] through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied.<ref name="AWH">{{cite book

}}</ref>  The core martial art from which aikido derives is [[Daito-ryu aiki-jujutsu|Dait<U+014D>-ry<U+016B> aiki-j<U+016B>jutsu]], which Ueshiba studied directly with [[Takeda Sokaku]], the revivor of that art.  Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied [[Tenjin Shinyo Ryu|Tenjin Shin'y<U+014D>-ry<U+016B>]] with Tozawa Tokusabur<U+014D> in [[Tokyo]] in 1901, [[Yagy<U+016B> Shingan-ry<U+016B>|Got<U+014D>ha Yagy<U+016B> Shingan-ry<U+016B>]] under Nakai Masakatsu in [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]] from 1903 to 1908, and [[judo]] with Kiyoichi Takagi (<U+9AD8><U+6728> <U+559C><U+4EE3><U+5B50> ''Takagi Kiyoichi'', 1894&ndash;1972)  in [[Tanabe]] in 1911.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

}}</ref>

The art of Dait<U+014D>-ry<U+016B> is the primary technical influence on aikido.  Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the [[spear]] (''[[yari]]''), short [[staff (stick)|staff]] (''[[j<U+014D>]]''), and perhaps the {{Nihongo|[[bayonet]]|<U+9283><U+5263>|j<U+016B>ken}}. However, aikido derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship (''[[kenjutsu]]'').<ref name="ADS"/>

Ueshiba moved to [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] in 1912, and began studying under Takeda Sokaku in 1915. His official association with Dait<U+014D>-ry<U+016B> continued until 1937.<ref name="AWH"/>  However, during the latter part of that period, Ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from Takeda and the Dait<U+014D>-ry<U+016B>.  At that time, Ueshiba was referring to his martial art as "Aiki Bud<U+014D>".  It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name "aikido", but it became the official name of the art in 1942, when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society (''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]'') was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.<ref name="Aikido"/>

===Religous influences===
[[Image:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|right|Onisaburo Deguchi]]
After Ueshiba left Hokkaid<U+014D> in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|<U+014C>moto-ky<U+014D>]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia
| last = Pranin
| first = Stanley
| title = Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi
| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido
| date = 
| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73
}}</ref> One of the primary features of <U+014C>moto-ky<U+014D> is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life.  This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion, especially to those who seek to harm others.  Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis upon mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it.  In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>

In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.  As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students.  Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.<ref name="Styles">{{cite journal

===International dissemination===
Aikido was first brought to the West in 1951 by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] with a visit to [[France]] where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students.<ref name="Mochizuki">{{cite encyclopedia

}}</ref> He was followed by [[Tadashi Abe]] in 1952 who came as the official [[Aikikai Hombu]] representative, remaining in France for seven years. [[Kenji Tomiki]] toured with a delegation of various martial arts through fifteen continental states of the [[United States]] in 1953.<ref name="Styles"/>  Subsequently in that year, [[Koichi Tohei]] was sent by Aikikai Hombu to [[Hawaii]], for a full year, where he set up several dojo.  This was backed up by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States.  The [[United Kingdom]] followed in 1955; [[Italy]] in 1964; [[Germany]] and [[Australia]] in 1965.  Today there are aikido [[dojo]] available to train throughout the world.

===Proliferation of independent organisations===

{{see|Aikido styles}}
{{see also|List of aikidoka|l1=List of aikid<U+014D>ka}}

The biggest aikido organisation is the [[Aikikai Foundation]] which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family.  However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.<ref name="Styles"/>  

The earliest independent styles to emerge were [[Yoseikan Aikido]], begun by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] in 1931,<ref name="Mochizuki"/> [[Yoshinkan]] Aikido founded by [[Gozo Shioda]] in 1955,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

}}</ref> The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name="Styles"/>

After Usehiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974.  Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]] , who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation.  The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization which governs it, the [[Ki Society]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia
| last = Pranin
| first = Stanley
| title = Tohei, Koichi
| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido
| date = [[2006]]
| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701
}}</ref>

A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]], and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the "[[Iwama style]]", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups; one remaining with the Aikikai and the other forming the independent organization the Shinshin Aikishuren Kai, in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].

Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|<U+672C><U+90E8><U+9053><U+5834>|honbu d<U+014D>j<U+014D>}} in Japan, and have an international breadth.<ref name="Styles"/>

==Physical training==
In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques.<ref>{{cite book

| first = Gaku

| date = 1990

}}</ref>  The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and in certain styles, techniques with weapons.

===General fitness and training===

Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[flexibility]], and [[endurance]], with less emphasis on [[strength training]]. In aikido technique, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements found in other arts, and this distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.<ref name ="ADS"/>

Certain [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic fitness activities]], such as [[weight training]], emphasize contractionary power, in which specific muscles or muscle groups are isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, and power.  Aikido-related training instead emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance, more similar to [[yoga]] or [[pilates]].  For example, many dojo begin each class with {{Nihongo|warm-up exercises|<U+6E96><U+5099><U+4F53><U+64CD>|junbi tais<U+014D>}}, which may include [[stretching]] and breakfalls.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

| date = [[2006]]
| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340
}}</ref>

===Roles of ''uke'' and ''nage''===
Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (''[[kata]]'') rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (''[[uke (martial arts)|uke]]'') to initiate an attack against the thrower (<U+6295><U+3052> ''nage'', also referred to as <U+53D6><U+308A> ''[[Tori (martial arts)|tori]]'', or <U+4ED5><U+624B> ''shite'', depending on aikido style), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.<ref name="afl2"/> 

Both halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''nage'', are considered essential to aikido training.<ref name="afl2"/>   Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation.  ''Nage'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''nage'' places them.  This "receiving" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.<ref name="afl2">{{cite book
| last = Homma | first = Gaku

| publisher = North Atlantic Books
| date = 1990  | pages = 20-30
| location = Berkeley, California
| isbn = 978-1556430787
}}</ref>  ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''nage'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable.  In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|<U+8FD4><U+3057><U+6280>|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''nage''.

{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|<U+53D7><U+8EAB>}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves a parry or breakfall that is used to avoid pain or injury.<ref name="afl2"/>   In applying a technique, it is the responsibility of ''nage'' to prevent injury to ''uke'' by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner's proficiency in ''ukemi''.<ref name="afl2"/>  Injuries (especially those to the joints), when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of ''nage'' misjudging the ability of ''uke'' to receive the throw or pin.<ref name ="Aikinjuries"> Aikido and injuries: special report by [[Fumiaki Shishida]] Aiki News 1989;80 (April); partial English translation of article in Nihon Budo Gakkai Gakujutsushi (Scientific Journal of Japanese Martial Arts Studies) 1988;21(1)</ref><ref name ="Aikinjuries2">{{cite encyclopedia

===Initial attacks===

Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack; therefore, to practice aikido with their partner, students must learn to deliver various types of attacks.  Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, "honest" attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name="ADS"/>

Many of the {{Nihongo|strikes|<U+6253><U+3061>|uchi}} of aikido are often said to resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which may suggest origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name="ADS"/> Other techniques, which appear to explicitly be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are also practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. Some basic strikes include:
*{{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|<U+6B63><U+9762><U+6253><U+3061>|sh<U+014D>men'uchi}} a vertical [[Strike (attack)#Knife hand|knife-hand strike]] to the head.
*{{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|<U+6A2A><U+9762><U+6253><U+3061>|yokomen'uchi}} a diagonal knife-hand strike to the side of the head or neck.
*{{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|<U+80F8><U+7A81><U+304D>|mune-tsuki}} a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]]. Same as {{Nihongo|"middle-level thrust"|<U+4E2D><U+6BB5><U+7A81><U+304D>|ch<U+016B>dan-tsuki}}, and {{Nihongo|"direct thrust"|<U+76F4><U+7A81><U+304D>|[[choku-tsuki]]}}.
*{{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|<U+9854><U+9762><U+7A81><U+304D>|ganmen-tsuki}} a punch to the [[face]]. Same as {{Nihongo|"upper-level thrust"|<U+4E0A><U+6BB5><U+7A81><U+304D>|j<U+014D>dan-tsuki}}.

Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike.  Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender.<ref name="ADS"/>  The following are examples of some basic grabs:
*{{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|<U+7247><U+624B><U+53D6><U+308A>|katate-dori}} one hand grabs one wrist.
*{{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|<U+8AF8><U+624B><U+53D6><U+308A>|morote-dori}} both hands grab one wrist.
*{{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|<U+4E21><U+624B><U+53D6><U+308A>|ry<U+014D>te-dori}} both hands grab both wrists. Same as {{Nihongo|"double single-handed grab"|<U+4E21><U+7247><U+624B><U+53D6><U+308A>|ry<U+014D>katate-dori}}.
*{{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|<U+80A9><U+53D6><U+308A>|kata-dori}} a shoulder grab. "Both-shoulders-grab" is {{Nihongo|''ry<U+014D>kata-dori''|<U+4E21><U+80A9><U+53D6><U+308A>}}
*{{Nihongo|'''Chest grab'''|<U+80F8><U+53D6><U+308A>|mune-dori}} grabbing the (clothing of the) chest. Same as {{Nihongo|"collar grab"|<U+895F><U+53D6><U+308A>|eri-dori}}.

===Basic techniques===
[[Image:aikido ikkyo.png|right|thumb|Diagram of ''ikky<U+014D>'', or "first technique".  ''Yonky<U+014D>'' has a similar mechanism of action, although the upper hand grips the forearm rather than the elbow.]]
The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation.

* {{Nihongo|'''First technique'''|<U+4E00><U+6559>|ikky<U+014D>}} a control using one hand on the elbow and one on near the wrist which [[leverage]]s ''uke'' to the ground. This grip also applies pressure into the [[ulnar nerve]] at the wrist.
* {{Nihongo|'''Second technique'''|<U+4E8C><U+6559>|niky<U+014D>}} an [[Wristlock#Adductive wristlock|adductive wristlock]] that torques the arm and applies painful nerve pressure.
* {{Nihongo|'''Third technique'''|<U+4E09><U+6559>|sanky<U+014D>}} a [[Wristlock#Pronating wristlock|pronating wristlock]] that directs upward-spiraling tension throughout the arm, elbow and shoulder.
* {{Nihongo|'''Fourth technique'''|<U+56DB><U+6559>|yonky<U+014D>}} a shoulder control similar to ''ikky<U+014D>'', but with both hands gripping the forearm.  The knuckles (from the palm side) are applied to the recipient's [[radial nerve]] against the [[periosteum]] of the forearm bone.
* {{Nihongo|'''Fifth technique'''|<U+4E94><U+6559>|goky<U+014D>}} visually similar to ''ikky<U+014D>'', but with an inverted grip of the wrist, [[medial rotation]] of the arm and shoulder, and downward pressure on the elbow. Common in [[knife]] and other weapon take-aways.
* {{Nihongo|'''Four-direction throw'''|<U+56DB><U+65B9><U+6295><U+3052>|shih<U+014D>nage}} The hand is folded back past the shoulder, locking the shoulder joint.
* {{Nihongo|'''Forearm return'''|<U+5C0F><U+624B><U+8FD4><U+3057>|kotegaeshi}} a [[Wristlock#Supinating wristlock|supinating]] wristlock-throw that stretches the [[extensor digitorum]].
* {{Nihongo|'''Breath throw'''|<U+547C><U+5438><U+6295><U+3052>|koky<U+016B>nage}} a term for various types of flowing "timing throws".
* {{Nihongo|'''Entering throw'''|<U+5165><U+8EAB><U+6295><U+3052>|iriminage}} throws in which ''nage'' moves through the space occupied by ''uke''.  The classic form superficially resembles a "clothesline" technique.
* {{Nihongo|'''Heaven-and-earth throw'''|<U+5929><U+5730><U+6295><U+3052>|tenchinage}} beginning with ''ry<U+014D>te-dori''; moving forward, ''nage'' sweeps one hand low ("earth") and the other high ("heaven"), which unbalances ''uke'' so that he or she easily topples over.
* {{Nihongo|'''Hip throw'''|<U+8170><U+6295><U+3052>|koshinage}} aikido's version of the [[throw (grappling)#Hip throws|hip throw]].  ''Nage'' drops his or her hips lower than those of ''uke'', then flips ''uke'' over the resultant [[fulcrum]].
* {{Nihongo|'''Shaped-like-"ten" throw'''|<U+5341><U+5B57><U+6295><U+3052>|j<U+016B>jinage}} a throw that locks the arms against each other.  (The [[kanji]] for "10" is a cross-shape: <U+5341>)
* {{Nihongo|'''Rotation throw'''|<U+56DE><U+8EE2><U+6295><U+3052>|kaitennage}} ''nage'' sweeps the arm back until it locks the shoulder joint, then uses forward pressure to throw.

[[Image:Aikido ikkyo omote ura.png|left|thumb|Diagram showing two versions of the ''ikky<U+014D>'' technique: one moving forward (the ''omote'' version) and one moving backward (the ''ura'' version).  See text for more details.]]

===Implementations===

Aikido makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend with ''uke''. For example, an {{Nihongo|"entering"|<U+5165><U+8EAB>|irimi}} technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|"turning"|<U+8EE2><U+63DB>|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal
| last = Amdur
| first = Ellis
| title = Irimi
| journal = Aikido Journal
| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686
}}</ref>
Additionally, an {{Nihongo|"inside"|<U+5185>|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an  {{Nihongo|"outside"|<U+5916>|soto}} technique takes place to his side; a {{Nihongo|"front"|<U+8868>|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|"rear"|<U+88CF>|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Seated techniques are called ''suwari-waza''.<ref name="dynamic"/>

Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations.  For instance, ''ikky<U+014D>'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula "attack-technique(-modifier)".<ref name="term">{{cite book

| publisher = Lulu Press

| isbn = 978-1411618466 
}}</ref>  For instance, ''katate-dori ikky<U+014D>'' refers to any ''ikky<U+014D>'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist.  This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky<U+014D> omote'', referring to any forward-moving ''ikky<U+014D>'' technique from that grab.

''[[Atemi]]'' (<U+5F53><U+3066><U+8EAB>) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique.  Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against "[[pressure point|vital points]]" meant to cause damage in and of themselves.  For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G<U+014D>z<U+014D> Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name="Shugyo">{{cite book

}}</ref>  Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques. A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her concentration. The target may also become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.<ref name="dynamic">{{cite book

===Weapons training===

Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff (''j<U+014D>''), wooden sword (''[[bokken]]''), and knife (''[[tant<U+014D>]]'').<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>   Today, some schools also incorporate firearms-disarming techniques. Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are sometimes taught, to integrate armed and unarmed aspects, although some schools of aikido do not train with weapons at all.  Others, such as the Iwama style of Morihiro Saito, usually spend substantial time with ''bokken'' and ''j<U+014D>'', practised under the names ''[[aiki-ken]]'', and ''[[aiki-j<U+014D>]]'', respectively.  The founder developed much of empty handed aikido from traditional sword and spear movements, so the practice of these movements is generally for the purpose of giving insight into the origin of techniques and movements, as well as vital practice of these basic building blocks.<ref name="SOS">{{cite book

===Multiple attackers and ''randori''===

One feature of aikido is training to defend oneself against multiple attackers. Freestyle (''[[randori]]'', or ''jiy<U+016B>waza'') practice with multiple attackers is a key part of most curriculae and is required for the higher level ranks.<ref name="best">{{cite book

| title = Best Aikido: The Fundamentals (Illustrated Japanese Classics)
| publisher = Kodansha International
| date = 2002
| isbn =  978-4770027627 
}}</ref>  ''Randori'' exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment.<ref name="best"/>  Strategic choice of techniques, based upon how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in ''randori'' training.  For instance, an ''ura'' technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.<ref name ="ADS"/>

In [[Shodokan Aikido]], ''randori'' differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will.  In this respect it resembles judo ''randori''.<ref name="ACE"/>

==Mental training==
Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations.<ref name="ZENMA">{{cite book

==Ki==
[[Image:ki obsolete.svg|right|float|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[T<U+014D>y<U+014D> kanji|it was changed]] to <U+6C17>.]]

The study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is a critical component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either "physical" or "mental" training, as it encompasses both. The original ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' was <U+6C23> (shown right), and is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice; the "nourishing vapors" contained within are ''ki''.<ref>{{cite web

| publisher = Literati Tradition

}}</ref>

The character "ki" is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo|"health"|<U+5143><U+6C17>|genki}}, or {{Nihongo|"shyness"|<U+5185><U+6C17>|uchiki}}.  Ki is most often understood as unified physical and mental intention, however it is often found in traditional martial arts related with "life energy". G<U+014D>z<U+014D> Shioda's [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the 'hard styles', largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before [[World War II]], and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.<ref name="Shugyo"/>  In later years, Ueshiba's application of ki in Aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel.  This was his [[Takemusu]] Aiki and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. Koichi Tohei's [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ki with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development.<ref>{{cite web

==Uniforms and ranking==
Aikido practitioners, commonly called ''aikidoka'', generally progress by promotion through a series of "grades" (''[[ky<U+016B>]]''), followed by a series of "degrees" (''[[dan rank|dan]]''), pursuant to formal testing procedures. Most aikido organisations use only white and black belts to distinguish rank, but some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not always comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.<ref name="ADS"/>

The uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[aikidogi|aikid<U+014D>gi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.  Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("[[karate]]-style") cotton tops are used. Most aikido systems also add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers called a ''[[hakama]]''. In many styles its use is reserved for practitioners with black belt ranks, while others allow all practitioners or female practitioners to wear a ''hakama'' regardless of rank.<ref name="ADS"/>

== Criticisms ==
The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from loss of realism in training.  This can often be traced to some forms of practice in which the training partner never resists the technique being performed.  To counter this, a number of styles allow both training partners, after having demonstrated proficiency in being able protect themselves and their training partners, to become less and less compliant. Other styles, most notably Shodokan Aikido, have addressed the issue by introducing fully resistive training and a competitive format.<ref name="ACE"/>
<!-- Need references for the above, and hopefully we can find more data on injury rates -->

A study of injuries in the martial arts showed that while the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other, the differences in overall rates of injury were much less pronounced.  Soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido although a few deaths from repetitive "''shih<U+014D>nage''" have been reported.<ref name ="Aikinjuries"/><ref name ="Aikinjuries2"/><ref>{{cite journal
