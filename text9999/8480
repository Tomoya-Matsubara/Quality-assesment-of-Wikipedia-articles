'''Maryland Route 704 (MD 704)''' is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]].  Known as Martin Luther King Jr. Highway, the state highway runs {{convert|6.53|mi|km|abbr=on}} from [[Eastern Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern Avenue]] at the [[District of Columbia]] boundary in [[Seat Pleasant, Maryland|Seat Pleasant]] east to [[Maryland Route 450|MD 450]] in [[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]].  MD 704 was constructed in the early 1940s from Seat Pleasant to [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S. Route 50]] (now MD 450) along the right-of-way of the abandoned [[Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway]].  The highway was expanded to a multi-lane divided highway west of US 50 in the 1960s and 1970s and at its eastern end in 2000.

==Route description==
MD 704 begins at an intersection with Eastern Avenue near the eastern corner of the District of Columbia boundary.  The highway continues south as 63rd Avenue, which heads south toward [[Southern Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Southern Avenue]] and [[East Capitol Street]].<ref name="Google Maps MD 704"/>  MD 704 heads northeast as a six-lane divided highway through the town of Seat Pleasant, where the highway intersects Addison Road.<ref name="Prince Georges HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps MD 704"/>  After leaving the town, the state highway crosses Cabin Branch and intersects Sheriff Road at an oblique angle.  MD 704 passes through [[Palmer Park, Maryland|Palmer Park]], where the highway traverses Cattail Branch and meets [[Maryland Route 202|MD 202]] (Landover Road) at a full cloverleaf interchange.<ref name="Google Maps MD 704"/>  MD 704 temporarily drops to four lanes through the MD 202 interchange.<ref name="Prince Georges HLR"/>

MD 704 continues through [[Glenarden, Maryland|Glenarden]], where the highway intersects Ardwick Ardmore Road and crosses the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] ([[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate 95]] and I-495) with no access.<ref name="Prince Georges HLR"/>  MD 704 drops to four lanes again between Ardwick Ardmore Road and the five-ramp interchange at [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]] and US 50, which features a direct ramp to northbound I-95 and I-495 toward [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].  MD 704 continues northeast as a six-lane highway across Bald Hill Branch, through office parks, and past a shopping center before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 450 (Annapolis Road) in Lanham.<ref name="Prince Georges HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps MD 704"/>

==History==
MD 704 was constructed in 1942 on the right-of-way of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway, which had ceased operations in 1935.<ref name="1942 src report"/><ref name="Seat Pleasant"/><ref name="1946 map"/>  The highway was originally named for George N. Palmer, a community leader in Seat Pleasant.<ref name="Seat Pleasant"/>  MD 704 was temporarily marked as Temp US 50 when John Hanson Highway's western terminus was at MD 704 between 1959 and the highway's completion west to Washington in the early 1960s.<ref name="1959 map"/>  The state highway was expanded to a divided highway from Glenarden to just east of John Hanson Highway around 1964 and within Seat Pleasant by 1970.<ref name="National Bridge Inventory"/><ref name="1970 map"/>  MD 704 was expanded to a divided highway from Seat Pleasant to Glenarden around 1970.<ref name="National Bridge Inventory"/><ref name="1980 map"/>  MD 704 was renamed for [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] between 1986 and 1999.<ref name="Traffic Map 1986"/><ref name="Prince Georges HLR 1999"/>  The final two-lane portion of the state highway, from just east of US 50 to MD 450, was expanded to a six-lane divided highway in 2000.<ref name="Prince Georges HLR 2000"/>
