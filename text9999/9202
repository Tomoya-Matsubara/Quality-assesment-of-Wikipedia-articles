'''47 Ursae Majoris b''' is an [[extrasolar planet]] orbiting the [[Sun]]-like [[star]] [[47 Ursae Majoris]]. It is located in a long-[[orbital period|period]], near-circular [[orbit]] and is the innermost known planet in its [[planetary system]]. 47 Ursae Majoris b was discovered in [[1996]] and has a [[mass]] at least 2.63 times that of [[Jupiter]].

==Discovery==
Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, 47 Ursae Majoris b was discovered by detecting the changes in its star's [[radial velocity]] as the planet's [[gravity]] pulls the star around. This was achieved by observing the [[Doppler shift]] of the [[spectrum]] of 47 Ursae Majoris. After the discovery of the first extrasolar planet around a Sun-like star, [[51 Pegasi b]], astronomers [[Geoffrey Marcy]] and [[R. Paul Butler]] searched through their observational data for signs of extrasolar planets and soon discovered two: 47 Ursae Majoris b and [[70 Virginis b]]. The discovery of 47 Ursae Majoris b was announced in 1996.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v464n2/5104/sc0.html|author=Butler, R. et al.|title=A Planet Orbiting 47 Ursae Majoris|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=464|year=1996|pages=L153-L156}}</ref>

==Orbit and mass==
47 Ursae Majoris b orbits at a distance of 2.13 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from its star, taking 1,089 [[day]]s to complete a [[orbital revolution|revolution]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v646n1/64046/brief/64046.abstract.html|author=Butler, R. et al.|title=Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=646|pages=505 &ndash; 522|year=2006}} ([http://exoplanets.org/planets.shtml web version])</ref> It was the first long-period planet around a [[main sequence]] star to be discovered. Unlike the majority of known long-period extrasolar planets, the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of the orbit of 47 Ursae Majoris b is low. The planet lies close to a 2:5 [[orbital resonance]] with the outer planet [[47 Ursae Majoris c]], a similar configuration to Jupiter and Saturn in our [[solar system]]. In addition, the ratio of the masses of the two planets is similar to the mass ratio of Jupiter and Saturn.<ref name="fischer">{{cite journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v564n2/54348/54348.html| author=Fischer, D. et al.|title=A Second Planet Orbiting 47 Ursae Majoris|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=564|year=2002| pages=1028-1034}}</ref>

A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary [[astrometric]] measurements suggest the planet's orbit is [[inclination|inclined]] at an angle of 63.1<U+00B0> to the plane of the sky. If confirmed, this would imply the true mass of the planet is around 2.9 times that of Jupiter.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v548n1/005774/brief/005774.abstract.html|title=Preliminary Astrometric Masses for Proposed Extrasolar Planetary Companions|author=Han, I. et al.|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=548|pages=L57 &ndash; L60|year=2001}}</ref> In any case, the mass cannot be much greater than the lower limit or the system would be unstable.<ref name="fischer" />

==Characteristics==
Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a [[gas giant]] with no [[solid]] surface. Since the planet has only been detected indirectly, properties such as its [[radius]], composition and [[temperature]] are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and an environment close to [[chemical equilibrium]], the upper atmosphere of the planet is expected to contain [[water]] [[cloud]]s, as opposed to the [[ammonia]] clouds typical of Jupiter.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...538..885S|author=Sudarsky, D. et al.|title=Albedo and Reflection Spectra of Extrasolar Giant Planets|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=538|issue=2|pages=885 &ndash; 903|year=2000}}</ref>

While 47 Ursae Majoris b lies outside its star's [[habitable zone]], its gravitational influence would disrupt the orbit of planets in the outer part of the habitable zone.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?2005ApJ...622.1091J&db_key=AST&nosetcookie=1|author=Jones, B. et al.|title=Prospects for Habitable "Earths" in Known Exoplanetary Systems|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=622|issue=2|pages=1091 &ndash; 1101|year=2005}}</ref> In addition, it may have disrupted the formation of [[terrestrial planet]]s and reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0605136|title=The Search for other Earths: limits on the giant planet orbits that allow habitable terrestrial planets to form|author=Raymond, S.|year=2006|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] Letters (accepted)}}</ref> Therefore planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris are likely to be small and dry.
