== History ==
[[Image:Stvirgils 1911.jpg|thumb|right|250px|St Virgil's College, 1911]]
St Virgil's College was formally opened on [[22 January]] [[1911]] by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]]. At is foundation the College was a [[boarding school]] for boys located in Barrack Street, Hobart.<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.stvirgils.tas.edu.au/history.html |title=Our History |accessdate=2008-02-12 |work=About St Virgil's |publisher=St Virgil's College}}</ref> The boarding section of the College was closed in 1970 and since then St Virgil's College has been a [[day school]] only.

In 1962, another campus was opened in [[Austins Ferry, Tasmania|Austins Ferry]],<ref name=History/> offering junior secondary grades (Grades 7&ndash;9) on a [[river]]side property of 30 [[hectare]]s. In 1991, three Grade 10 streams were also added.

The Barrack Street campus then expanded for students from Grades 7&ndash;12 until 1994 when, under the Southern Secondary Schools Restructuring Plan, the campus no longer accepted enrolments for Grade 7. At the end of 1994, Grades 8, 11 and 12 ceased to run at the Barrack Street campus, and  all secondary grades were moved to the Austins Ferry campus. This allowed [[Guilford Young College]] (Grades 11 and 12) to be established on the Barrack Street site. Grades 9 and 10 still ran in 1995, and only Grade 10 was offered in 1996. 

After 1996, St Virgil's College ceased to operate any of its classes on the Barrack Street campus. From then on, Grades 7&ndash;10 were all taught at the Austins Ferry campus, and because of the discontinuation of Grades 11&ndash;12, many students moved on to the newly formed Guilford Young College for their pre-tertiary years.

In August 1995, permission was granted for St Peter's School to become the St Virgil's College Junior School from 1996 onwards. The Junior School now accommodates boys from Grades 3&ndash;6 and operates on the old St Peter's School site in Patrick Street.

== Principal ==
The current [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of St Virgil's College is Christopher D. Smith, who was appointed in 2001. He is the first [[Laity|lay]] Principal the school has had; all previous Principals have been [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]]. 

== Facilities ==
[[Image:SVC-Senior.jpg|thumb|250px|right|St Virgil's College Senior Campus]]
The College's buildings consist of specialist science, music, art, sporting, computer, woodwork and metalwork, food technology and learning support facilities. Plans are underway for expansions to the existing library. 
Recent changes to the College's facilities include:
*The Joyce Performance Centre (2000)
*The Br. Jack Higgins' Wing (2004)
*The alterations/expansion of the Edmund Rice Hall (2005&ndash;2006)
*The naming of "Our Lady of Perpetual Help" Chapel (2006)

== Curriculum ==
St Virgil's College offers a broad [[curriculum]], with the areas of [[literacy]] and [[numeracy]] of high importance. Emphasis is also placed on the languages, [[science]], [[social science]] and [[physical education]].
The College places the most emphasis on its teaching of [[religious education]], which is central to every student's studies.

==Co-curriculum==
=== Sport ===
Much importance is placed on sport at St Virgil's College. All students are encouraged to participate in at least one sport during their time at the College.

The College has had much success on the sporting field throughout its history. Most recent is the College's domination of the Tasmanian State and Southern School's [[Athletics (track and field)|Athletics]]. The College's athletics team have won the S.A.T.I.S (Sports Association of Tasmanian Independent Schools)  Boy's junior title 10 years in a row, and the Southern S.A.T.I.S title 10 years in a row as well.

Other sports on offer at St Virgil's include [[Canoe Polo]], [[Cross country running|Cross-Country]], [[Cricket]], [[AFL Football|Football]], [[Hockey]], [[Sport rowing|Rowing]], [[Soccer]], [[Swimming]], [[Tennis]], [[Touch football (rugby league)|Touch Football]], [[Waterpolo]], basketball and [[sailing]].

=== Music ===
The College offers three teacher-coordinated [[Big band|stage bands]] of varying difficulty to accommodate players of different skill levels. St. Virgil's also offers individual and small group instrumental tuition for those wishing to acquire the skills to excel further than a band setting can allow them. The College also has the facilities to accommodate students wishing to start their own [[rock band]].

The St Virgil's College Senior [[Big band|Stage Band]] has won numerous awards for its outstanding efforts at various [[eisteddfod]]s around Hobart. The Senior Band specialises in the areas of contemporary [[Rock (music)|rock]], [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[Latin American music|Latin]] music. The band often performs at school [[fair]]s, school productions and [[mass (liturgy)|masses]]. In late 2005, the Senior Band, along with the jazz quartet, toured [[Melbourne]], performing at various schools and other venues. It is currently organizing and arranging plans to go on a similar tour of Melbourne in 2007. The Senior Stage band has also taken part in two St. Virgil's school musicals, the most recent being The Pajama Game (2006)

The band currently has between 10 and 15 members, and mainly features the [[trumpet]], [[trombone]] and [[saxophone]] ([[alto saxophone|alto]], [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] and [[baritone saxophone|baritone]]), with a rhythm backing ([[drums]], [[guitar]] and [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]).

== House system ==
As with most Australian schools, St Virgil's utilises a [[house system]]. The school houses are:
*Doyle <U+2014> Blue
*Dwyer <U+2014> Green
*[[Congregation of Christian Brothers in New Zealand|Hessian]] (formerly Virgilian House) <U+2014> Red
