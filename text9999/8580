==Biography==
Pedersen was born in [[Osted]], near [[Roskilde]], on the Danish island of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]. As a child, Pedersen played [[piano]]. As a teenager he started learning to play [[double-bass]] and at the age of 14, while studying, he began his professional jazz career in [[Denmark]] with his first band, Jazzkvintet 60 (Danish for 'Jazz Quintet 60'). Later on, he was engaged as the regular bassist at Copenhagen's [[Jazzhus Montmartre]]. At 17, he had already turned down an offer to join the [[Count Basie]] orchestra, mainly because he was too young to get legal permission to live and work as a musician in [[United States|America]].

During the 1960s, Pedersen played with several important [[United States|American]] jazzmen who were touring or resident in Denmark, including [[Ben Webster]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statsbiblioteket.dk/search/showrecord.jsp?record_id=sb_3197543|title=''<U+00D8>rsted Pedersen Recording With Ben Webster 1965-71''|publisher=Danish National Library, statsbiblioteket.dk|accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> [[Bill Evans]], [[Brew Moore]], [[Bud Powell]], [[Count Basie]], [[Roy Eldridge]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Jackie McLean]], [[Roland Kirk]], [[Sonny Rollins]], and [[vocalist]] [[Ella Fitzgerald]]; he also played with [[Jean-Luc Ponty]]. He became the bassist of choice whenever a big-name musician was touring Copenhagen.

He was awarded Best Bass Player Of The Year by [[Down Beat|Downbeat]] Critics' Poll in 1981.<ref>{{cite web

Pedersen worked in duo and trio arrangements with [[pianist]] [[Kenny Drew]], recording over 50 [[album]]s together. He also worked with [[St<U+00E9>phane Grappelli]] and [[Joe Pass]] and recorded extensively as a leader. His best known songs are "My Little Anna", "Jaywalkin' ", and "The Puzzle", as well as jazz arrangements of traditional Danish folk songs. He was awarded the [[Nordic Council Music Prize]] in 1991. In 1999, he co-led a duo with pianist [[Mulgrew Miller]], touring Europe, Japan, Australia, and Korea. This format was later enlarged into a trio featuring drummer, Alvin Queen. This trio remained intact until his death.

Pedersen died of heart failure in 2005 at the age of 58 in [[Copenhagen|Copenhagen, Denmark]]. He was survived by his wife, Solveig, and his three children.<ref>"N-H. Orsted Pedersen, 58, Bassist in Danish Jazz Scene, Dies" (April 21, 2005) ''New York Times''</ref>

| quote  ="From the first night that my dear friend Audrey Genovese of Chicago played a Dexter Gordon record that featured Niels Pedersen on bass, I realized that this musical giant and I might someday have the pleasure and occasion of not just meeting but also playing together.
After hearing this phenomenal talent on bass, I realized that somehow, someday we should meet, thereby giving me the opportunity to also play with him. This vision and thought took place in the early 1970s, when I was fortunate enough to be able to invite him to join my then trio." | source =Oscar Peterson, writing in ''Jazztimes''.<ref>{{cite web
