'''''Mezzamorphis''''' is the second [[studio album]] by the [[Christian rock]] [[band (music)|band]] [[Delirious?]]. It was released in [[1999]] to a largely positive critical reception, representing a large step towards a more electronic and mainstream sound for the band. However, despite the critical acclaim, many former Delirious? fans disliked the album, claiming that the band had [[selling out|sold out]] to the [[secularity (non-religiosity)|secular]] industry.

Mezzamorphis spawned two UK singles, "[[See the Star]]" and "[[It's OK (Delirious? song)|It's OK]]", both of which landed in the top 20 of the [[UK Singles Charts]], whilst the album itself peaked at number 25 on the [[UK Album Charts]], giving Delirious? their second top 30 album in a row. The album has since gone [[Music recording sales certification|silver]] in the UK.

==Recording and production==

Following their breakthrough 1997 album [[King of Fools]], Delirious? started recording ''Mezzamorphis'' in [[February]] [[1998]], and continued to record throughout that year, interspersed with summer tours throughout the US and UK. The band began recording with roughly half the songs already written, and continued writing as they recorded.<ref name="musician"/> Most of the recording took place in an old school in [[West Sussex]]. In the words of [[Martin Smith (songwriter)|Martin Smith]], "We turned a classroom into a control room, and there were some wooden rooms where students used to dine, in which we set up a drum kit with different mike positions. We did the bulk of it there for the first six months in between touring. In the end, we went to a smaller studio in Ford just to finish it off."<ref>{{cite web |last = Brown |first = Bruce A. |title = A Conversation with Delirious |publisher = [[CDNOW|CDNow.com]] |date = October 1999 |url = http://delirious.org.uk/articles/media/doc15.html |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-10}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref> The band used movable drapes to experiment with different drum sounds and reverbs; most of the drums on the album are thus natural and unprocessed.<ref name="musician"/>

Formerly known for a sound similar to that of [[U2 (band)|U2]],<ref name="viewfrom">{{Citation |last = |first = |title = View from the Dressing Room |journal = [[Cross Rhythms]] Magazine |issue = |date = August 1998 |year = 1998 |url = }}</ref><ref name="CDNow">{{cite web |last = Soditus |first = J.

The album was mixed by [[Jack Joseph Puig]]<ref>{{cite web |last = |first = |title = Delirious? Biography |publisher = Crosswalk.com |date = August 1999 |url = http://delirious.org.uk/articles/media/doc16.html |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-08}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref> in [[Los Angeles]] early in 1999. In the words of guitarist [[Delirious? musicians|Stu G]], "Martin and I went out to LA in January for three weeks and sat down with him and explained to him what we were doing and where we were coming from, what we were trying to accomplish with the music. He was very perceptive. He definitely took our tracks and made them into something we couldn't have done ourselves."<ref name="musician"/> Puig's mixing of the album deepened the bass sound and brought it more of a "club" feel.<ref name="CDNow"/>

==Content==

As with the previous album, ''[[King of Fools]]'', ''Mezzamorphis'' is mostly midtempo; notable exceptions include "Bliss"<ref name="interactive"/> and "Gravity".<ref name="crossrhythmsreview"/> The new electronic direction taken by the band incorporated a [[theremin]], played by bassist [[Delirious? musicians|Jon Thatcher]]; additionally, Stu G used [[Revox]] tape delays to create keyboard-like guitar effects.<ref name="musician"/> Classical instruments were also included, including a [[Salvation Army]] brass band on "It's OK",<ref name="crossrhythmsreview"/> an upright bass (also played by Thatcher) on "Kiss Your Feet", and a string quartet throughout the album. 

While ''Mezzamorphis'' is not strictly a [[concept album]], more than one professional reviewer has pointed out that there is a general theme of getting to [[heaven]] running through the whole work.<ref name="crossrhythmsreview">{{Citation |last = Rimmer |first = Mike |title = Delirious? - Mezzamorphis |journal = [[Cross Rhythms]] Magazine |issue = 51 |date = June 1999 |year = 1999 |url = http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Delirious/Mezzamorphis/391/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = Anderson |first = Rick |title = Mezzamorphis > Overview |publisher = [[All Music Guide]] |date = |url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:13620r4au48z |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-08}}</ref> The band have confirmed this,<ref name=musician>{{cite web |last = Adolph |first = Bruce |title = A Musician's Interview with Guitarist Stu G |publisher = Crosswalk.com |date = July 1999 |url = http://delirious.org.uk/articles/media/doc17.html |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-10}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref> and have also pointed out a theme of change.<ref name = "CDNow"/> "Heaven", inspired by the troubles in Northern Ireland, ties the two themes of heaven and change together; according to Smith, "we have to come to realize that we come from the dust, yet we believe one day we'll meet Jesus. In the meantime, we're caught between two worlds. Heaven is my home."<ref name = interactive>{{cite web |last = |first = |title = An Interactive Mezzamorphis |publisher = Crosswalk.com |date = July 1999 |url = http://delirious.org.uk/articles/media/doc18.html |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-08}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref>

The first track, "Mezzanine Floor", is the change-oriented centrepiece of the album, written about the musical growth of the band.<ref name = interactive>{{cite web |last = |first = |title = An Interactive Mezzamorphis |publisher = Crosswalk.com |date = July 1999 |url = http://delirious.org.uk/articles/media/doc18.html |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-08}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref> According to [[Stu G]], "we feel that we're at a point where we've left where we were, but we're not yet where we believe we're going to end up. So, we're on the way, in the middle, on the mezzanine floor."<ref name = "interactive"/> "Metamorphis", written solely by Stu G, further explores this theme of change. The name of the album is a mixture of the names of these two tracks (see [[Metamorphosis]] and [[Mezzanine (architecture)|Mezzanine]]).<ref name="CDNow"/><ref name="Powell_Fe">{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark Allan |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |year=2002 |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |location=[[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]], [[Massachusetts]] |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |edition=First printing |chapter=Delirious? |pages=250-252}}</ref>

Another strong theme from the album is [[peer pressure]], particularly due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song "Gravity" refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst "Metamorphis" further explores "the fact that out in the world, although everybody wants to be their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what they want us to be." "Bliss" deals with accusations of [[selling out]]; in the words of Stu G, "we know exactly where we want to go, we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians."<ref name = "interactive"/>

==Promotion, reception, and response==

The promotional UK tour featured American rock band [[Switchfoot]] as support.<ref>{{cite web |last = Wood |first = Dave |title = Switchfoot to Support Delirious? on Mezzamorphis UK Tour |publisher = delirious.org.uk |date = [[1999-05-10]] |url = http://www.delirious.org.uk/news/1999/news16.html |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-08}}</ref> Delirious? also performed several songs live at [[Glastonbury Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Wood |first = Dave |title = Delirious?

The first single, "[[See The Star]]", was released in the UK in 1999, selling over 5,000 copies in the first day and 12,000 copies in the first week. This was enough to push it to number sixteen in the [[UK Singles Charts]] and number two in the indies<ref>{{Citation |last = |first = |title = D:lighted at 16 |newspaper = Christian Herald |pages = |year = 1999 |date = [[1999-03-27]] | url = http://delirious.org.uk/articles/media/doc04.html}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref> - the highest chart position ever held by a Delirious? single. A year later, the band released "[[It's OK (Delirious? song)|It's OK]]", which entered the singles charts at number eighteen and the indie charts at number three.<ref>{{cite web |last = |first = |title = Features - It's OK |publisher = delirious.org.uk |url = http://delirious.org.uk/features/itsok.html |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-08}}</ref> The song was featured an episode of the US television series ''[[Get Real (TV series)|Get Real]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last = Wood |first = Dave |title = 'It's OK' on TV |publisher = delirious.org.uk |url = http://delirious.org.uk/news/2000/news05.html |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-08}}</ref> "Gravity" was planned to be released as a single in the UK,<ref>{{cite web |last = Wood |first = Dave |title = Gravity Single in the USA / New UK Single Planned |publisher = delirious.org.uk |url = http://delirious.org.uk/news/2000/news05.html |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-08}}</ref> but was only released as a radio single in the US, due to [[Radio One]]'s refusal to playlist the band.<ref>{{Citation |last = Rimmer |first = Mike |title = Radio and TV Snub Delirious |journal = [[Cross Rhythms]] Magazine |issue = 51 |date = June 1999 |year = 1999 |url = http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Delirious/Mezzamorphis/391/}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref>

Mezzamorphis was released on [[12 April]] [[1999]] in the United Kingdom. Despite the extensive publicity campaign, the album debuted at number 25 in the [[UK Album Charts]] and number 2 in the indies,<ref>{{cite press release |title = Delirious?

The album also reached number 2 in the [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] charts in America and number 137 in the [[Billboard 200]] (number 5 in the [[Heatseekers]]) following its [[8 June]] release.<ref>{{cite web |last = |first = |title = Mezzamorphis > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums |publisher = [[All Music Guide]] |url = http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:k9fexqrkldfe~T3 |format = HTML |accessdate = 2007-04-11}}</ref>

Critical response was generally positive in both the secular and UK Christian music media. ''[[Rock Sound]]'' magazine praised "the band's talent for writing instant rock/pop songs"<ref name="rocksoundreview"/> and stated, "it shouldn't be long before Delirious? claim their rightful place as one of Britain's brightest new bands",<ref>{{Citation |last = Smith |first = Nick |title = Heaven Sent |journal = [[Rock Sound]] Magazine |issue = |date = May 1999 |year = 1999 |url = http://delirious.org.uk/articles/media/doc05.html}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref> whilst ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine named them "the hottest thing in Christian rock"<ref>{{Citation |last = Duerden |first = Nick |title = This band can fill Brixton Academy but Radio 1 won't play them.

In the United States, the Virgin marketed version omitted three songs that were included on the Sparrow version. Each of these contained explicit faith references.<ref name="Powell_Fe"/> Additionally, the album caused some controversy in the US Christian music scene<ref name="CDNow"/> due to the lyric "she's as pretty as hell" in the song "It's OK".<ref name="Powell_Fe"/> The band had left the song off promotional copies of the album, and Sparrow Records had considered leaving the song off the album;<ref>{{Citation |last = Carlozo |first = Lou |title = Fab Five |journal = [[CCM Magazine]] |issue = |date = July 1999 |year = 1999 |url = http://delirious.org.uk/articles/media/doc11.html}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref> several Christian retailers dropped the album amongst the complaints.<ref name="sellout"/> Smith wrote a response to the controversy on the band's website;<ref name="sellout">{{cite press release |title = Martin Smith Answers the Selling-Out Question |publisher = [[Delirious?]] |date = [[1999-07-06]] |url = http://www.delirious.org.uk/articles/media/doc69.html |accessdate = 2006-04-08}} (delirious.org.uk mirror)</ref> however, many fans continued to believe that the band had left [[Christian rock]] for the secular industry.
