'''Jay Chou ''' ({{zh-tspwp|t=<U+5468><U+6770><U+502B>|s=<U+5468><U+6770><U+4F26>|p=Zh<U+014D>u Ji<U+00E9>l<U+00FA>n|w=Chou Chieh-lun|poj=Chiu Kia<U+030D>t-l<U+00FB>n}}) (born [[18 January]] [[1979]]) is a [[World Music Award]]-winning [[Taiwan]]ese musician, singer, producer, actor and director. In 1998, he was discovered in a talent contest where he showcased his piano and song-writing skills. Over the next two years, he was hired to compose for popular Chinese singers. Trained in classical music, he combines Chinese and Western music styles to produce songs that fuse [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[Pop music|pop]] genres, covering issues such as domestic violence, war, and urbanization. 

In 2000, he released his first album titled ''[[Jay (album)|Jay]]'' under the record company Alfa Music. Since then, he has released one album per year, selling several million copies each. His music has gained recognition throughout [[Asia]], most notably in countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], [[Taiwan]], and in [[overseas Chinese]] communities, winning more than 20 awards each year. He has sold over 25 million albums worldwide. In 2007, he was named one of the 50-most influential people in China by the British think tank [[Chatham House]]. He starred in ''[[Initial D (film)|Initial D]]'' (2005) for which he won Best Newcomer Actor in [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards|Golden Horse Awards]], and was nominated for Best Supporting Actor by [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] for his role in ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' (2006). His career now extends into directing and running his own record company JVR Music.

==Early life==
Jay Chou grew up in the small town of [[Linkou Township|Linkou]], [[Taiwan]]. Both his parents were secondary school teachers: his mother Ye Hui Mei ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+8449><U+60E0><U+7F8E>|s=<U+53F6><U+60E0><U+7F8E>|p=Y<U+00E8> Hu<U+00EC>m<U+011B>i}}) taught fine arts while his father Zhou Yao Zhong ({{zh-cp|c=<U+5468><U+8000><U+4E2D>|p=Zh<U+014D>u Y<U+00E0>ozh<U+014D>ng}}) was a biology instructor. His mother noticed his sensitivity to music and took him to piano lessons at the age of 4. During his childhood, he was fascinated with capturing sounds and songs with his tape recorder, something he carried everywhere with him. In the third grade, he became interested in music theory and also started cello lessons. As an only child, he enjoyed being the family's center of attention; he loved to play piano, imitate TV actors, and perform magic tricks.His parents divorced when he was 14; as a result, he became reclusive and introverted. Although he had friends, he often preferred to be alone listening to music, contemplating and daydreaming. At Dan Jiang Senior High School, he majored in piano and minored in cello. He showed talent for improvisation, became fond of pop music and began to write songs.<ref name="gddm812">{{zh icon}} {{cite book| last = Chou| first = Jay| title = Grandeur de D Major| format = Book| date = 2004-11-01| publisher = Hua Ren Ban Tu| location = China | isbn = 9572937146 | pages = p.8, 12 }}</ref><ref name="Time"/>

Chou graduated from high school with inadequate grades for university, so he prepared for military service, which was compulsory for all Taiwanese men at the age of 18. However, a sports injury triggered by an unexplainable and severe back pain eventually led to the diagnosis of [[ankylosing spondylitis]], a hereditary spine inflammation disease; as a result, he was exempted from conscription.<ref name="interviewak">{{zh icon}} {{cite news| url = http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2003-04-28/2225147402.html |title = Jay Chou discusses the wonder of life in illness <U+4E8C><U+5EA6><U+9020><U+8BBF><U+5FC3><U+60C5><U+7535><U+89C6> <U+5468><U+6770><U+4F26><U+8C08><U+75C5><U+75DB><U+4E2D><U+7684><U+7CBE><U+5F69><U+4EBA><U+751F> | date = 2003-04-28 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 | publisher = sina.com.cn |format = News article}}</ref><ref name ="zaobaoak">{{zh icon}} {{cite news| url = http://stars.zaobao.com/pages3/zhoujielun060225.html |title = Jacky Wu: Jay Chou takes 12 painkillers <U+5434><U+5B97><U+5BAA><U+FF1A><U+5468><U+6770><U+4F26><U+4E00><U+5EA6><U+670D>12<U+9897><U+6B62><U+75DB><U+836F>| publisher = zaobao.com |date = 2006-02-25 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 | format = News article }}</ref> Meanwhile, he found himself a job as a waiter. Without his knowing, his friend had entered both their names in a talent show called ''Super New Talent King''. Chou played the piano accompaniment for his friend, whose singing was described as "lousy". Although they did not win, the show's host [[Jacky Wu]]<U+2014>an influential character in Taiwan's entertainment business<U+2014>happened to glance at Chou's music score and was impressed with its complexity. Wu hired him as a contract composer and paired him with the novice lyricist [[Vincent Fang]] ({{zh-cp|c=<U+65B9><U+6587><U+5C71>|p=F<U+0101>ng W<U+00E9>nsh<U+0101>n}}).<ref name = "Time"/>

Over the next two years he wrote songs for Chinese pop artists, and also learned recording and sound mixing; his dedication was apparent as he even slept in the music studio. There were no plans to make him a singer because his mentor Wu thought he was too shy and not good-looking. Wu's music studio was later sold to Alfa Music, and the new manager Yang Jun Rong asked him to release his own album. Chou already had an arsenal of songs he wrote for others but had been rejected, so among those he chose 10 for his debut CD ''[[Jay (album)|Jay]]'' that was released in 2000. The album established his reputation as a musically gifted singer-songwriter whose style is a fusion of [[R&B]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[classical music]], and yet distinctly Chinese. His fame spread quickly not only in Chinese-speaking regions, but in non-Chinese countries as well throughout Southeast Asia.<ref name= "jcbio" >{{zh icon}} {{cite web| url = http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/2007-01-08/23381402205.html |title = King of the new generation <U+5468><U+6770><U+4F26><U+FF1A><U+65B0><U+58F0><U+4EE3><U+4E4B><U+738B>| date = 2007-01-08 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 | publisher =sina.com.cn | format = Web article}}</ref><ref name = "starsrising"/><ref name="revolutionary"/> Since 2000, Chou has released one album per year, each selling several million copies (see ''[[Jay Chou#Discography|Discography]]''), and has been recognized with hundreds of awards.<ref name = "awardlist"/> In 2003, he was the cover story of ''Time'' magazine (Asia version),<ref name = "Time"/> acknowledging his influence on popular culture.

Unlike most singers, Chou has an enormous amount of creative control over his music.<ref name ="Time"/> He is not only the songwriter but also the producer in all of his albums; since 2005 he is also the music director and also directs his own music videos. 

While continuing to release an album yearly, he also entered the movie business with his debut role as the lead actor in ''[[Initial D (film)|Initial D]]'', for which he won ''Best Newcomer'' at the [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards|Golden Horse Awards]] in 2005.<ref name="bestnewcomer">{{cite news| url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/12/features/peepfri.php |title =  People: Jay Chou, Pete Doherty, Pen<U+00E9>lope Cruz  |date = 2006-01-12 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 |publisher = International Herald Tribune| format = News article}}</ref> The following year, Chou was cast as a supporting character in the world-wide release of ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'', starring international Chinese stars [[Chow Yun-Fat]] and [[Gong Li]], giving Chou his brief but formal introduction to North American audiences.

Chou's compositions are loosely categorized as [[pop music]]. While many of his works fall into contemporary [[R&B]], [[rap music|rap]], and [[rock music|rock]] genres, the term "Chou Style" ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+5468><U+6C0F><U+98A8><U+683C>|s=<U+5468><U+6C0F><U+98CE><U+683C>|p=zh<U+014D>u sh<U+00EC> f<U+0113>ngg<U+00E9>}})<ref name = "2mill">{{zh icon}} {{cite news |url=http://newsserver.ccwb.net/html1/2006/10/11/f110918.shtml |title="Still Fantasy" Two million albums sold recognized for Jay Chou <U+300A><U+4F9D><U+7136><U+8303><U+7279><U+897F><U+300B><U+4E24><U+767E><U+4E07><U+9500><U+91CF><U+529B><U+8BC1><U+5468><U+8463> |publisher=www.ccwb.net | date=2006-10-11 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 }}</ref><ref name ="dreamon">{{zh icon}} {{cite news |url= http://finance.eastday.com/eastday/enjoy/node58771/node58900/node58903/node143675/u1a2299177.html |title=Jay Chou Still "Fantasy"/How much longer will he dream on? <U+5468><U+6770><U+4F26><U+4F9D><U+7136>"<U+8303><U+7279><U+897F>" <U+5468><U+8463><U+8FD8><U+4F1A><U+68A6><U+5E7B><U+591A><U+4E45> |publisher=East Day |date=2006-09-05 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 }}</ref> has been popularized to describe his trademark cross-cultural music and his insistence on singing with relaxed enunciation. ''[[Taipei Times]]'' once described the meaning of "Chou Style": "''In what has become the archetypal Chou style, Taiwan's favorite son blends pop, rap, blues and a smorgasbord of esthetic elements of world music to create his dream-like never-never land<U+2026>''"<ref>{{cite web |last = Phipps |first = Gavin |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/08/29/2003200785 |title=CD Reviews |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2004-08-29 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 }}</ref> He regularly fuses traditional Chinese instruments and styles with R&B or rock to form a new genre called "Zhongguo feng" ({{zh-tspl|t=<U+4E2D><U+570B><U+98A8>|s=<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+98CE>|p=Zh<U+014D>nggu<U+00F3> f<U+0113>ng|l=China wind}}),{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} some of which are written in the [[Pentatonic Scale]] as opposed to the normal seven-note scale ([[Diatonic scale|Diatonic Scale]]) to accentuate an oriental style. Besides his own culture, he also incorporated [[Flamenco guitar|Spanish guitar]] in "Red Imitation" ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+7D05><U+6A21><U+4EFF>|s=<U+7EA2><U+6A21><U+4EFF>|p=h<U+00F3>ng m<U+00F3>f<U+01CE>ng}}), American [[techno music|techno]]/[[electronic music|electronica]] in "Herbalist's Manual" ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+672C><U+8349><U+7DB1><U+76EE>|s=<U+672C><U+8349><U+7EB2><U+76EE>|p=B<U+011B>nc<U+01CE>o G<U+0101>ngm<U+00F9>}}), rap with subtle [[classical music]] undertones in "Reverse Scales" ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+9006><U+9C57>|s=<U+9006><U+9CDE>|p=n<U+00EC>l<U+00ED>n}}), and [[Bossa nova|Bossanova]] style in "Rosemary" ({{zh-cp|c=<U+8FF7><U+8FED><U+9999>|p=m<U+00ED>di<U+00E9>xi<U+0101>ng}}), to name a few. Sound effects from everyday life are frequently weaved into his music, such as bouncing ping pong balls, touch tone phone dialing, helicopter blades, dripping rain, and radio static noise.{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} His formal musical training is evident by the use of classical [[Musical texture|textures]] in his compositions. For example, [[counterpoint]] was used in "Perfection" ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+5B8C><U+7F8E><U+4E3B><U+7FA9>|s=<U+5B8C><U+7F8E><U+4E3B><U+4E49>|p=w<U+00E1>nm<U+011B>izh<U+01D4>y<U+00EC>}}) and "Sorry" ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+5C0D><U+4E0D><U+8D77>|s=<U+5BF9><U+4E0D><U+8D77>|p=du<U+00EC>buq<U+01D0>}}), while [[polyphony]] can be found in "The Wound That Ends War" ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+6B62><U+6230><U+4E4B><U+6BA4>|s=<U+6B62><U+6218><U+4E4B><U+6B87>|p=zh<U+01D0> zh<U+00E0>n zh<U+012B> sh<U+0101>ng}}) and "Twilight's Chapter Seven" ({{zh-cp|c=<U+591C><U+7684><U+7B2C><U+4E03><U+7AE0>|p=y<U+00E8> de d<U+00EC>-q<U+012B> zh<U+0101>ng}}).  

Chou's albums have been noted for the lack of change compared to his earlier works, yet he firmly stated that he will not alter his style: "''They say I've been standing still <U+2026> but this is the music I want, and I don't see what I want by moving ahead.''"<ref name="appetite"/> To demonstrate his point, he named his 2006 album ''Still Fantasy'' after his 2001 album ''Fantasy''.

===Lyrics===

Strictly speaking, Chou is more often a singer-composer than a [[lyricist]].

====Directing====
[[Image:Secret-Bunengshuodemimi.jpg|thumb|150px|Promotional poster for [[Secret (2007 film)|''Secret'']] featuring Chou as a director for the first time.]]
Chou's acquired his first directing experience in 2004 through music videos. He initially experimented with a song by the group [[Nan Quan Mama]] titled "Home" ({{zh-cp|c=<U+5BB6>|p=ji<U+0101>}}) where he was involved throughout the entire process from research to editing. After learning the difficulties of being a director, he refused to direct again even at the request of his record company.<ref name = "gddm109">{{zh icon}} {{cite book | last = Chou  | first = Jay  | title = Grandeur de D Major | publisher = Hua Ren Ban Tu  | date = 2004  | pages = p.106  | month = December  | isbn = 957-29371-4-6 }}</ref> However, his interest resurfaced again as he directed music videos for 4 of the 12 songs in own album ''[[November's Chopin]]'' in 2005,<ref name = "huoyuanchiaep"> Huo Yuan Chia.

===Book: ''Grandeur de D Major''===
Chou published his first book titled ''Grandeur de D Major'' ({{zh-tsp|t=D<U+8ABF><U+7684><U+83EF><U+9E97>|s=D<U+8C03><U+7684><U+534E><U+4E3D>|p=D di<U+00E0>o de hu<U+00E1>l<U+00EC>}}) on [[November 25]], [[2004]].{{Ref_label|K|k|none}} This 200-page book features a prologue written by his family, friends, and co-workers; the main section is a compilation of his personal attitudes, philosophies, and recollections of childhood experiences along with pictures from his music videos, many of which have never been released; and lastly, a list of the artist's major awards, musical and lyrical compositions, and discography. For the usually low-profile singer, this book revealed his personality and convictions that has served as the basis of his musical and public image. He demonstrated a strong appreciation of family values with an especially deep connection with his mother and maternal grandmother. His confidence and dedication towards music is evident as he dedicated 2 out of 7 chapters to music: the current state of the industry, his composition methodology, and the importance of individualism to his success in music. This pride is contrasted against his modesty and self-assessed naivety about many aspects in life, particularly regarding relationships and marriage.

===Endorsements===

However, failure to win "Best Album" for three consecutive years has left him disheartened with award ceremonies.<ref name ="gddm1">{{zh icon}} {{cite book | last = Chou  | first = Jay  | title = Grandeur de D Major | publisher = Hua Ren Ban Tu  | date = 2004  | pages = p.89  | month = December  | isbn = 957-29371-4-6 }}</ref> Golden Melody Awards gave no awards to Chou in 2005, and not even a nomination in the following year (except for lyrics to "[[Fa Ru Xue|Hair Like Snow]]" ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+9AEE><U+5982><U+96EA>|s=<U+53D1><U+5982><U+96EA>|p=f<U+0101> r<U+00FA> xu<U+011B>}}) and arrangement of "Blue Storm" ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+85CD><U+8272><U+98A8><U+66B4>|s=<U+84DD><U+8272><U+98CE><U+66B4>|p=l<U+00E1>ns<U+00E8> f<U+0113>ngb<U+00E0>o}}), which lost).

===Response to the news media and paparazzi===

As with other stars, Chou has expressed a strong dislike of the [[paparazzi]]. In the early years of his career, unwanted attention by the media was usually dealt with by avoidance. In-line with his quiet nature, he frequently wore baseball caps and hoods while lowering his head and evading eye contact during interviews.<ref name = "allhailjay"/> In the recent years however, he has been less passive about the invasion of his privacy. To discourage the paparazzi from taking unsolicited pictures, Chou is known to photograph the paparazzi that follow him.<ref name="confrontation">{{zh icon}} {{cite news |url = http://www.singtao.com/index_archive.asp?d_str=20051223&htmlpage=main&news=1223fo01.html |title= Jay Chou and the paparazzi in a direct confrontation <U+5468><U+6770><U+502B><U+8207><U+72D7><U+4ED4><U+968A><U+6253><U+57CB><U+8EAB><U+6230> |publisher=Singtao Daily (Hong Kong) |date=2005-12-23 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 }}</ref> He openly calls the paparazzi "dogs" and tabloids "dog magazines", as shown in his lyrics for "Besieged From All Sides" ({{zh-cp|c=<U+56DB><U+9762><U+695A><U+6B4C>|p=s<U+00EC>mi<U+00E0>nch<U+01D4>g<U+0113>}}). Chou has been reported to be romantically linked to an array of female celebrities, such as [[Jolin Tsai]], [[Vivian Hsu]], and [[Hebe Tian]] from [[S.H.E]]. Although each relationship (with the exception of [[Patty Hou]]<ref name = "phvsjt"/>) has been denied by Chou, these reports have given him a "player" image. The media and Taiwanese government has also accused Chou of evading compulsory military service<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.sina.com/taiwan_hk/p/1/2006/0224/66936.html |title=Pop singer Jay Chou accused of evading military service |publisher=Associated Press/Sina |date=2006-02-24 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 }}</ref> by feigning to suffer from [[ankylosing spondylitis]]. Later that year he was acquitted after providing the relevant medical records and letters from the army confirming a lawful exemption from draft dated before the start of his music career.<ref name ="innocence">{{zh icon}} {{cite news |url=http://ent.sz.net.cn/fashion/2006-11/10/content_295892.htm |title=Jay Chou faked medical records to evade military service?

Despite constant harassment and stalking by the media, he does acknowledge that not all media attention is unwelcome.<ref name="gddm79">"''[one] cannot take a clear-cut stance against them (the paparazzi) <U+2026> because they help you promote your name <U+2026> and [the paparazzi] will write about what the populace is most interested in.''"{{zh icon}} {{cite book | last = Chou  | first = Jay  | title = Grandeur de D Major | publisher = Hua Ren Ban Tu  | date = 2004  | pages = p.79  | month = December  | isbn = 957-29371-4-6 }}</ref> Coverage by international journals and news agencies such as ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'',<ref name="Time"/> ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref name = "guardianuk">{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1757374,00.html |title=We're Not Listening Until You Sing In English|publisher=The Guardian (UK) |date=2006-04-21 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 }}</ref> and ''[[Reuters]]''<ref name="lookeast"/> help ascertain his influence on mainstream culture. An editorial published by the [[Chatham House|Royal Institute of International Affairs]] named Chou as one of the 50 most influential figures in China, one of only three singers on a list dominated by politicians and corporate owners.<ref name = "chinapowerlist"> {{cite web| first = Kerry | last = Brown | url = http://www.opendemocracy.net/home/chinapower/china.jsp | title = China Power List 2007 | date = 2007-04-11 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 | publisher = Chatham House/United Kingdom Royal Institute of International Affairs | format = Web article }}</ref>

===Fanbase===

It is difficult to estimate the size and global spread of Chou's fanbase. The Chinese-speaking population of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China make up the majority of his fans. Despite rampant [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] issues in this region, particularly in China, every album Chou has released so far has surpassed 2 million sales. According to [[Baidu]], the most popular internet search engine in China, Chou is the number one searched male artist in 2003,<ref name ="baidu2003">{{zh icon}} [http://top.baidu.com/ Baidu's Top Searches 2003]</ref> 05,<ref name ="baidu2005">{{zh icon}} [http://www.baidu.com/2005/ Baidu's Top Searches 2005]</ref> and 06.<ref name="baidu2006">{{zh icon}} [http://www.icif.china.cn/2006ndssfyb/ Baidu's Top Searches 2006]</ref> In Hong Kong, he has been the best-selling Mandarin artist for the past 4 years.<ref name="topsaleshk">{{zh icon}} {{cite web |title = Hong Kong Top Sales Music Awards presented |url=http://www.ifpihk.org/www/public/dcm/dis_dcmcontent.php?langsel=0&catid=3&rkey=gold | accessdate = 2007-06-02 }}</ref> According to a 2004 survey in five Chinese urban centers for children ages 9 to 14, 1 in 6 named Chou as their favorite idol;<ref name = "born1990"> {{cite news| url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/09/content_363431.htm | title = Born in the 1990s | date = 2004-08-09 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 | publisher = China Daily | format = News article }}</ref> he was also reported as the favorite singer of youths aged 8 to 25 in a study conducted in seven Asian countries (2006).<ref name = "synovate"> {{cite web| url = http://www.synovate.com/current/news/extra/20061108/061108%20Young%20Asians%20Regional%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf | title = Synovate Young Asians survey reveals the hearts, minds, and wawllets of Asia's digital youth | date = 2006-11-08 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 | publisher = Synovate | format = Report (PDF) }}</ref> He has a solid fanbase throughout Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam.<ref name = "synovate"/> In Singapore, Chou was the second most searched celebrity behind Britney Spears in the "Music" category.<ref name = "hitwisejan07">Hitwise Singapore<U+2014>Top 10 Industry Search Terms<U+2014>January, 2007 </ref>

Currently, Chou remains largely unknown outside of Asia, except in cities with large Chinese immigrant populations such as [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], [[Calgary]], [[Sydney]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York]] and [[San Francisco]]. He has held concerts in major venues such as the [[MGM Grand]] (Las Vegas<U+2014>December 25, 2002)<ref name = "Time"/>, [[Shrine Auditorium]] (Los Angeles<U+2014>December 18, 2004)<ref name = "2005shrine"> {{cite news| last = Quah | first = Junie | url = http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=20302 | title = Jay Chou in LA: An Incomparable Breakthrough | date = 2005-03-02 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 | publisher = UCLA Asia Institute | format = Review }}</ref>, and [[Galen Center]] (Los Angeles<U+2014>December 24, 2007). His intention to increase his prominence in the Western world beyond Chinese audiences is clear. In 2006, Chou composed and sang the theme song for ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'', a movie released in major theatres in most English-speaking countries,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.sina.com/taiwan_hk/1/2006/0111/61386.html |title=Jay Chou pens theme song for new Jet Li movie 'Fearless' |publisher=Associated Press |date=2006-11-01 | accessdate = 2007-06-02 }}</ref> though the impact to his fame has been minimal. His role in ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' (limited release) marks his acting debut in North America. Despite having a supporting but important role in the story's plot, the North American version of the official posters only featured a view of his back, greatly contrasting the Asian versions where his face and name were clear and placed between the leading actor and actress. Although Chou is still far from being well-known to English audiences, this movie has brought him international exposure.
