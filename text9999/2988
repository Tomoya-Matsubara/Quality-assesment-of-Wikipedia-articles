'''Theodor Gotthilf Leutwein''' ([[May 9]], [[1849]] - [[April 13]], [[1921]]) was colonial administrator of [[German Southwest Africa]] from 1894-1904. Born in [[Waldbrunn, Baden-W<U+00FC>rttemberg|Str<U+00FC>mpfelbrunn]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], he replaced [[Curt von Fran<U+00E7>ois]] as commander of the [[Schutztruppe]] (Imperial Security Troop) in 1894. His personal goal in German Southwest Africa was to create "colonialism without bloodshed".

During his tenure there, Leutwein created a decentralized administration with three regional centers in [[Windhoek]], [[Otjimbingwe]] and [[Keetmanshoop]].
The construction of the first railroad between Windhoek and the seaport of [[Swakopmund]] was built during his rule.

His policies with the native Africans, which he called the "Leutwein System" was a mixture of diplomacy and military coercion. His relationship with the indigenous [[Namaqua]] and [[Herero]] tribes were tenuous at best. Conversely, he was often criticized by German colonists as being too lenient with the Africans. In 1904 an uprising by the Herero was the beginning of the end of his colonial leadership. Soon afterwards, [[William II, German Emperor]], replaced Leutwein with the notorious General [[Lothar von Trotha]]. Like his successor, Leutwein's conduct in the war was characterized by gross neglect for [[international law]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Thus, he had to admit in May 1904 that the Germans had not taken one Herero prisoner, following an inquiry by the [[social democracy|social democratic]] ''[[Reichstag]]'' deputy [[August Bebel]].<ref>cf. Drechsler, Horst: ''Let Us Die Fighting'' (London: Zed Press, 1980), 151f.</ref>

In 1906, Leutwein published an autobiography, ''Elf Jahre als Gouverneur in Deutsch-S<U+00FC>dwestafrika'' ("Eleven Years as Governor in German South-West Africa"), an historical account of his career in German Southwest Africa. He died in [[Freiburg]].
