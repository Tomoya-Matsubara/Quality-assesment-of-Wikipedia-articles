'''HMS ''Bacchante''''' was a [[Cressy-class cruiser|''Cressy''-class]] [[armoured cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] around 1900. Upon completion she was assigned to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] as [[flagship]] of the fleet's cruiser [[squadron (naval)|squadron]]. She was reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] upon her return home in 1905 before returning to the Mediterranean in 1906. Six years later she returned home and was again placed in reserve. [[Ship commissioning|Recommissioned]] at the start of World War I, ''Bacchante'' became [[flagship]] of the [[7th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|7th Cruiser Squadron]]. She was present at the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] a few weeks after the war began, but saw no combat.

She was transferred to convoy escort duties in the [[Bay of Biscay]] in late 1914 before being sent to Egypt in early 1915. ''Bacchante'' was then assigned to support [[Anzac]] troops during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] by providing [[naval gunfire support|naval gunfire]]. She covered the [[Landing at Anzac Cove]] in April as well as several subsequent operations. Returning home in late 1916, she became the flagship of the [[9th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|9th Cruiser Squadron]] on convoy escort duties off the African coast in mid-1917. ''Bacchante'' remained there for the rest of the war and was reduced to reserve in 1919 before being sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1920.

==Design and description==
''Bacchante'' was designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|12000|LT|t}}. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|472|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|69|ft|9|in|m|1}} and a deep [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|9|in|m|1}}.<ref>Friedman 2012, pp. 335<U+2013>36</ref> She was powered by two 4-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of {{convert|21,000|ihp|lk=in|-1}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by 30 [[Belleville boiler]]s. On their [[sea trial]]s all of the ''Cressy''-class cruisers, except the [[lead ship]], exceeded their designed speed.<ref>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 69</ref> She carried a maximum of {{convert|1600|LT|t}} of coal and her complement ranged from 725<ref name=f6>Friedman 2012, p. 336</ref> to 760 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=ck8>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 68</ref>

Her main armament consisted of two [[List_of_British_ordnance_terms#BL|breech-loading]] (BL) [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX - X|{{convert|9.2|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mk X guns]] in single [[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft of the superstructure.<ref name=f6/> They fired {{convert|380|lb|adj=on}} shells to a range of {{convert|15500|yd}}.<ref>Friedman 2011, pp. 71<U+2013>72</ref> Her secondary armament of twelve [[BL 6-inch Mk VII naval gun|BL 6-inch Mk VII guns]] was arranged in [[casemate]]s amidships. Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.<ref>Friedman 2012, pp. 243, 260<U+2013>61</ref> They had a maximum range of approximately {{convert|12200|yd}} with their {{convert|100|lb|adj=on}} shells.<ref>Friedman 2011, pp. 80<U+2013>81</ref> A dozen [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 12 pounder 18 cwt naval gun|12-pounder 18 cwt guns]] were fitted for defence against [[torpedo boat]]s, eight on casemates on the upper deck and four in the superstructure.<ref>Friedman 2012, pp. 243, 336</ref> The ship also carried three [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|3-pounder]] [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and two submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|{{convert|17.72|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}}]] [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref name=ck8/>

The ship's waterline [[Belt armor|armour belt]] had a maximum thickness of {{convert|6|in|0}} and was closed off by {{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}} transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick. The protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] armour ranged in thickness from {{convert|1|-|3|in|mm|0}} and the conning tower was protected by {{convert|12|in|0}} of armour.<ref name=ck8/>

==Construction and service==
''Bacchante'', named after the female devotees of the Greek god [[Bacchus]],<ref name=s6>Silverstone, p. 216</ref> was [[Keel|laid down]] by [[John Brown & Company]] at their [[shipyard]] in [[Clydebank]] on 15 February 1899 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 21 February 1901.<ref name=ck8/> She arrived at [[Chatham Dockyard]] the following October, to be equipped an prepared for her steam and gunnery trials <ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval & Military intelligence|day_of_week=Saturday |date=12 October 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36584| }}</ref> and was completed on 25 November 1902.<ref name=ck8/> She was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet as flagship of its cruiser squadron upon completion. ''Bacchante'' remained there until 1905 when she returned home and was placed in reserve. She returned there in 1906 for service with the [[3rd Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|3rd]] and later the [[6th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|6th Cruiser Squadron]]s. Upon returning home in 1912 the ship was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet.<ref>Friedman 2012, p. 240</ref>

At the outbreak of the war in August 1914, ''Bacchante'' became the flagship of the [[7th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|7th Cruiser Squadron]], tasked with patrolling the [[Broad Fourteens]] of the [[North Sea]] in support of a force of [[destroyer]]s and [[submarine]]s based at [[Harwich]] which protected the eastern end of the [[English Channel]] from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between [[United Kingdom|England]] and [[France]].<ref>Corbett, vol. I, pp. 171<U+2013>72</ref> During the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August, the ship was flagship of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Henry Campbell (naval officer)|Henry Campbell]] commanding Cruiser Force 'C', in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action.<ref>Corbett, vol. I, pp. 100, 171<U+2013>72</ref> After the sinking of ''Bacchante''{{'}}s three [[sister ship]]s while patrolling the [[Broad Fourteens]] of the [[North Sea]] on 22 September, she, and her sister {{HMS|Euryalus|1901|2}}, were transferred to the [[12th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|12th Cruiser Squadron]] to escort ships between England and [[Gibraltar]] in early October.<ref>Corbett, vol. I, pp. 202, 330; Friedman 2012, p. 240</ref>

''Bacchante'' and ''Euryalus'' were transferred to Egypt in late January 1915 to reinforce the defences of the [[Suez Canal]] although the Turkish [[raid on the Suez Canal]] had already been repulsed by the time that they arrived in February. By this time the preliminary bombardments of the Turkish defences of the [[Dardanelles]] had already occurred and the sisters were transferred north in March as the Turks east of the Canal proved to be reasonably quiet.<ref>Corbett, vol. II, pp. 118, 120, 293</ref>

During the landing at Anzac Cove during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] on 25 April, ''Bacchante'' suppressed Turkish [[artillery]] positions at [[Gaba Tepe]] after touching her bow the beach for a better position from which to engage the guns. She provided fire support for forces near Anzac Cove for the next several months, particularly during the [[Third attack on Anzac Cove]] on 19 May when she, together with three predreadnought battleships, effectively suppressed the Turkish artillery assigned to support the attack. On 28 May ''Bacchante'' and the destroyer {{HMS|Kennet|1903|2}} destroyed enemy shipping in [[Budrum]] harbour. Three months later the cruiser bombarded Turkish troops during the [[Battle of Lone Pine]] on 6 August and [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]] 7<U+2013>9 August. She was not present when the Allies began to evacuate Gallipoli in December, but her [[captain (nautical)|captain]], [[Algernon Boyle]], commanded the evacuation at Anzac Cove.<ref>Corbett, vol. II, p. 323; vol. III, pp. 25, 36, 91, 97, 102, 235</ref>

She remained in the Mediterranean until late 1916 when she returned home. She was damaged in a collision with the armoured cruiser {{HMS|Achilles|1905|2}} in the [[Irish Sea]] in February 1917. After repairs she became flagship of the 9th Cruiser Squadron at [[Sierra Leone]] from April 1917 to November 1918. ''Bacchante'' was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] at Chatham in April 1919<ref>Friedman 2012, p. 240; Transcript</ref> and sold for scrap on 1 July 1920.<ref name=s6/>
