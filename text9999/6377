'''''The Impressions Show with Culshaw and Stephenson''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] comedy sketch show which stars [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]] [[Jon Culshaw]] and [[Debra Stephenson]]. A second series began broadcasting on 14 November 2010 and ended on 23 December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w5qrp |title=Episode 1 |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> A third series started on 26 October 2011 at 8.30pm on [[BBC One]]. The show was nominated for a [[National Television Awards]] in the category of Comedy in 2011, however it failed to make the top 4.

==Characters==
This is not the complete list but a list of the most common celebrities parodied in the show.

*'''''[[The One Show]]''''' <U+2013> Culshaw as [[Adrian Chiles]] and Stephenson as [[Christine Bleakley]]. The duo usually open the show and state many bizarre and inhumane events of the week in the format of the real show. The scene usually ends with Adrian saying "But first this..." which opens up the other sketches. The scene is however repeated two or three times throughout the show. For series 3 Culshaw and Stephenson played [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] and [[Alex Jones (presenter)|Alex Jones]] instead.

*'''''[[Ross Kemp on Gangs]]''''' <U+2013> A sketch which begins with Ross Kemp describing a gang he is about to encounter. Unlike the real show, he is usually referring to groups of people with no aggressive tone whatsoever e.g. ''[[Brownie (Girl Guides)]]''. He usually scarpers from the groups within thirty seconds of meeting them whilst saying "I could see things were about to kick off; so I got out of there!" however he then returns to these innocent groups a few "days" later and they have the same impact once again.

*'''''[[Sir Alan Sugar]]''''' in the office - A look in to the eventful goings on in the Sir Alan office but who will Sir Alan be firing this time? Sketches include the firing of Del Boy and Rodders in ep.1 and [[Mr Bean]] in ep.5.

*'''''[[Ray Mears' World of Survival (TV series)|Ray Mears' Survival Guide]]''''' - A show featuring [[Ray Mears]] who intensely discovers and describes new foods he can eat whilst surviving in the jungle. He then shows two pieces of food which are similar although one is poisonous and one is not-he often confuses them and ends up eating the poisonous before the cameraman is able to warn him

*'''''[[Autumnwatch#Autumnwatch 2009|Autumnwatch]]''''' <U+2013> A parody of a show with the same name. The show features Stephenson as [[Kate Humble]] the regular presenter and a brand new one, the unlikely: [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]] who always seems to ruin Humble's perfect introduction and presentation of the show by killing and eating the animals being shown.

*'''[[Davina McCall]] and [[Claudia Winkleman]]''' <U+2013> Two British hosts who regularly bump into each other on different occasions and embark in different activities which involves having a choice between two things to do. In the excitement of having a choice both of them pass out in a long series of heavy enthusiastic breathing.

*'''New [[Doctor Who]] auditions''' - Sketches in which different celebrities audition for the new role as Doctor Who, celebrities include [[Bruce Forsyth]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Nick Knowles]], [[Phillip Glenister]] as [[DCI Gene Hunt]], [[Peaches Geldof]], [[Michael Winner]], [[Ricky Gervais]] and others

*'''[[Michael McIntyre]]''' <U+2013> A British stand up comedian who is portrayed by Culshaw as a very quick talking and witty person who first appeared in his house being visited by a sound inspector after noticing there was a strange noise in his house which turned out to be his own voice. He appears for around ten seconds throughout the show in the format of ''[[Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow]]'' but instead the backdrop reads "ME" and he drones on about different topics making a joke.
