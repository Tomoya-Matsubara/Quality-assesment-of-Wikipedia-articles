"'''Attack'''" is a song by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]]. The song was released by [[Immortal Records|Immortal]] and [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] on May 3, 2005, as the lead single from the band's second album, ''[[A Beautiful Lie]]''. The song was written by [[Jared Leto]] and was produced by [[Josh Abraham]] and 30 Seconds to Mars. The song is a dynamic expression of rebirth and renewal.<ref>{{cite web|title=30 Seconds to Mars|work=[[USA Network]]|publisher=[[NBC Universal]]|url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/virginrecords/theshow/characterprofiles/30seconds/bio.html|accessdate=2010-11-10}}</ref> 30 Seconds to Mars premiered the song on the American network [[Fuse TV|Fuse]] on May 25, 2005, during ''[[IMX (TV series)#Daily Download|Daily Download]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.30secondstomars.ca/30stm/info_bandology.htm|title=Bandology: May 25, 2005|accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref>

"Attack" has been critically appreciated, with reviewers complimenting its energetic keyboards, vast, abrasive guitars and infectious vocals. The song was the most added track on alternative radio in its first week, becoming a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock]] top 30 hit. It attained success during the years, debuting for the first time on European charts only after two years of its original release. The accompanying music video, which aired on August 29, 2005, takes place in an abandoned hotel in Hollywood and every frame hides some messages.

==Background and recording==
"Attack" had been around for a while and the band was unconvinced of its worth. The song proved to be somewhat problematic, and was nearly excluded from the album. During an interview in 2005, [[Jared Leto]] said "'Attack' was a song that wasn't scheduled to be recorded at all. I'd been playing it <U+2013> I'd play it in the desert in Morocco, I was playing it in Thailand <U+2013> I was playing it everywhere." When Jared tried performing the song with the rest of the band, something was wrong. "On acoustic it was great; but when we played it as a band, it just fell flat on its face." "As soon as the bass got in there<U+2026>" [[Matt Wachter]] continued. "Yeah, so it was either replace Matt or throw the song out." Jared played it acoustically for [[Josh Abraham]]; "I was playing it outside of the studio one night on acoustic guitar and Josh walked out and, as a joke, I said 'Hey, you wanna hear a hit song?' I was just talking. I started playing the verse and went into the chorus and he stopped me on the first chorus and said 'It's the best song you have. You have to record it'. So we all got in a circle and something about it changed. Something about us changed. And it became the first song on the record and the first single off our album. So he did a great job on encouraging us to do that song. And now I really love it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mishmashmagazine.com/interviews/musicians/30-seconds-to-mars-interview|title=30 Seconds To Mars: Interview|work=Mishmasch Magazine|date=2005-06-26|first=Aaron|last=Pompey|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> Jared told Josh Abraham that night "This song deserves to be a hit just so we can tell this story."<ref>{{cite web |title=Mars Attracts! |last=Baker|first=Brian|publisher=Gallery of Sound |url=http://www.30secondstomars.ca/30stm/articles/articles2005_august_galleryofsound.htm |date=August 2005  |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070226072755/http://www.30secondstomars.ca/30stm/articles/articles2005_august_galleryofsound.htm |archivedate=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>
