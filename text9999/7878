'''Sophocles''' ([[ancient Greek]]: {{polytonic|'''<U+03A3><U+03BF><U+03C6><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03BB><U+03AE><U+03C2>'''}}; 495 BC - 406 BC) was the second of three great [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy|tragedians]]. He was preceded by [[Aeschylus]], and was followed by or contemporary to [[Euripides]]. According to the [[Suda]], a tenth century AD encyclopedia, he wrote 123 plays during the course of his life. For almost 50 years, he was the dominant competitor in the dramatic competitions of ancient [[Athens]] that took place during the religious festivals of the [[Lenaea]] and the [[City Dionysia|Dionysia]]. His first victory was in 468 BC, although scholars are no longer certain that this was the first time that he competed.

Only seven of his tragedies have survived into modern times with their text completely known. The most famous are the three tragedies concerning  [[Oedipus]] and [[Antigone]]: these are often known as the ''[[Theban plays]]'' or ''The Oedipus Cycle'', although they were not originally written or performed as a single trilogy. Sophocles influenced the development of the drama, most importantly by adding a third character and thereby reducing the importance of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in the presentation of the plot. He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights like Aeschylus, and used female characters in his plays.<ref name="F247">Freeman: 247</ref>

==Life==
[[Image:Sophocles CdM Chab3308.jpg|thumb|left|A marble relief of a poet, perhaps Sophocles.]]

Sophocles was born in the rural ''[[deme]]'' (small community) of [[Colonus Hippius]] in [[Attica]], which would later become a setting for his plays.<ref name="S41">Sommerstein: 41</ref> His birth took place a few years before the [[Battle of Marathon]] in [[490 BC]]: the exact year is unclear, although 497/6 is perhaps most likely.<ref>Lloyd-Jones 1994: 7</ref><ref name=S41/> Like many Ancient Greek names, that of Sophocles ({{polytonic|<U+03A3><U+03BF><U+03C6><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03C2>}}) has a meaning. The young Sophocles won awards in [[wrestling]] and [[music]], was graceful and handsome, and led the chorus of boys (''[[paean]]'') at the Athenian celebration of the victory against the [[Persian Empire|Persian]]s at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in [[480 BC]].<ref>Freeman: 246-247</ref> His artistic career began in earnest in 468 BC when he took first prize in the [[Dionysia]] theatre competition over the reigning master of Athenian drama, [[Aeschylus]].<ref name=S41/><ref>Freeman: 246</ref>

Sophocles became a man of importance in the public halls of Athens as well as in the theatres. Early in his career, the politician [[Cimon]] might have been one of his patrons, although if he was there was no ill will borne by [[Pericles]], Cimon's rival, when Cimon was ostracized in 461 BC.<ref name=S41/> In 443/2 he served as one of the ''Hellenotamiai'', or treasurers of Athena, helping to manage the finances of the city during the political ascendancy of Pericles.<ref name=S41/> He was also elected by the [[Athens|Athenian]] people as one of the ten generals for 441/0, during which he participated in the crushing of the revolt of [[Samos Island|Samos]], though his contemporaries did not consider him a great politician or general.<ref name=S41/> He was also elected, in 413 BC at the age of 83, to be one of the commissioners crafting a response to the catastrophic destruction of the Athenian expeditionary force in Sicily during the [[Peloponnesian War]].<ref>Lloyd-Jones: 12-13</ref> 

Several ancient writers have commented on Sophocles' [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|love of youths.]] [[Athenaeus]] alleged that in addition to seeking and keeping female courtesans, Sophocles loved boys as [[Euripides]] loved women.<ref>[[Athenaeus]]: ''The Deipnosophists,'' Book XIII (603)</ref> He quotes from a now-lost book by [[Ion of Chios]] regarding an incident of Sophocles flattering a serving boy at a [[symposium]] and then using a strategem to kiss and embrace him, as well as another, ascribed to Hieronymus of Rhodes, in which Sophocles is tricked by a hustler.<ref>[[Athenaeus]]: ''The Deipnosophists,'' Book XIII (604E)</ref> [[Plutarch]], in his "Life of Pericles," mentions an incident, during a naval expedition, in which Sophocles praised the beauty of a young recruit. [[Pericles]] rebuked him by warning that a general must keep not only his hands clean, but also his eyes.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''The Lives,'' "Life of Pericles" 8.5</ref>''

Sophocles died at the venerable age of ninety in 406 or 405 BC, having seen within his lifetime both the Greek triumph in the [[Persian Wars]] and the terrible bloodletting of the Peloponnesian War.<ref name=S41/> He was so respected by the Athenians that two plays performed at the [[Lenea]] soon after his death paid homage to him, and his unfinished play ''Oedipus at Colonus'' was completed and performed years later.<ref name=S41/> Both Iophon, one of his sons, and a grandson, also called Sophocles, followed in his footsteps to become playwrights themselves.<ref>Sommerstein: 41-42</ref>

==Works and legacy==
[[Image:Euaion.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait from a vase of a Greek actor performing in Sophocles' lost play ''Andromeda''.]]

In Sophocles' time, the Greek art of the drama was undergoing rapid and profound change. It had begun with little more than a [[Greek chorus|chorus]], but earlier playwrights had added first one and then two actors and thereby shifted the action of the plays away from the chorus.<ref>Freeman: 242-243</ref> Among Sophocles' earliest innovations was the addition of a third actor, further reducing the role of the chorus and creating greater opportunity for character development and conflict between characters.<ref name=F247/> In fact, Aeschylus, who dominated Athenian playwrighting during Sophocles' early career, adopted this third character into his own playwriting towards the end of his life.<ref name=F247/> It was not until after the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BC that Sophocles became the preeminent playwright in Athens.<ref name=S41/> 

Thereafter, Sophocles emerged victorious in dramatic competitions at 18 Dionysia and 6 Lenaia festivals.<ref name=S41/> In addition to innovations in the structure of drama, Sophocles' work is known for deeper development of characters than earlier playwrights, whose characters are more two-dimensional and are therefore harder for an audience to relate to.<ref name=F247/> His reputation was such that foreign rulers invited him to attend their courts, although unlike Aeschylus who died in [[Sicily]], Sophocles never accepted any of these invitations.<ref name=S41/> [[Aristotle]] used Sophocles's ''Oedipus the King'' as an example of perfect tragedy, which suggests the high esteem in which his work was held by later Greeks.<ref>Aristotle. ''Ars Poetica''.</ref>

Only two of the seven surviving plays have securely dated first or second performances: ''[[Philoctetes]]'' ([[409 BC]]) and ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' ([[401 BC]], put on after Sophocles' death by his grandson, also called Sophocles). Of the others, ''[[Electra]]'' shows stylistic similarities to these two plays, and so was probably written in the latter part of his career. ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'', ''[[Antigone]]'' and ''[[The Trachiniae]]'' are generally thought to be among his early works, again based on stylistic elements, with ''[[Oedipus the King]]'' coming in Sophocles' middle period.<ref>Lloyd-Jones 1994: 8-9</ref><ref>Scullion, pp. 85-86, rejects attempts to date ''Antigone'' to shortly before 441/0 based on an anecdote that the play led to Sophocles' election as general. On other grounds, he cautiously suggests ''c.'' 450 BC.</ref>

===The Theban plays (The Oedipus Cycle)===
 
Perhaps the most famous of Sophocles plays are commonly known as the ''[[Theban plays]]'' or ''The Oedipus Cycle''.<ref name=F247/> The cycle consists of the plays ''[[Oedipus the King]]'' (''Oedipus Rex'' or ''Oedipus Tyrannos''), which won second prize, ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', which won first prize when produced by his grandson, and ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''.<ref name=F247/> Although these three plays are related in plot, they were not written or performed at the same time, and so were likely not originally intended to be a trilogy.<ref name="F247248">Freeman: 247-248</ref> Taking up the theme of humans being trapped both by fate and their own frailties, the plays tell the story of the family of [[Oedipus]], who in Greek mythology killed his father and married his mother without knowing that they were, in fact, his parents.<ref name=F247248/> ''Antigone'', a play about Oedipus' daughter's death, is an example of Sophocles' use of prominent female characters.<ref name=F247/>

===Other plays===

Similar themes of human powerlessness in the winds of fate appear in some of Sophocles' other surviving works, which include ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'', ''[[The Trachiniae]]'', ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]'', the last of which won first prize.<ref name=F247248/> In 'Ajax', for example, the Greek hero commits suicide out of remorse for his attack on his fellow Greeks before he can be told that the gods have forgiven him.<ref name=F247248/>

===Fragmentary plays===

Fragments of ''[[The Tracking Satyrs]]'' (''Ichneutae'') were discovered in [[Egypt]] in 1907.<ref name="sea">Seaford: 1361</ref> These amount to about half of the play, making it the best preserved [[satyr play]] after Euripides' ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', which survives in its entirety.<ref name=sea/> Fragments of ''[[The Progeny]]'' (''Epigonoi'') were discovered in April [[2005]] by classicists at [[Oxford University]] with the help of [[infrared]] technology previously used for [[satellite]] imaging. The tragedy tells the story of the siege of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]].<ref>Keys, David, Pyke, Nicholas, [http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article2031.ece "Decoded at last: the 'classical holy grail' that may rewrite the history of the world"], The Independent (UK), 17 April 2005, "Scientists begin to unlock the secrets of papyrus scraps bearing long-lost words by the literary giants of Greece and Rome ..."</ref> A number of other Sophoclean works have survived only in fragments, including: 

:* ''Aias Lokros'' (''Ajax the Locrian'')
:* ''Akhai<U+00F4>n Syllogos'' (''The Gathering of the Achaeans'')
:* ''Hermione''
:* ''Nauplios Katapleon'' (''Nauplius' Arrival'')
:* ''Nauplios Pyrkaeus'' (''Nauplius' Fires'')
:* ''Niobe''
:* ''Oenomaus''
:* ''Poimenes'' (''The Shepherds'')
:* ''Polyxene''
:* ''Syndeipnoi'' (''The Diners'', or, ''The Banqueters'')
:* ''Tereus''
:* ''Troilus and Phaedra''
:* ''Triptolemus''
:* ''Tyro Keiromene'' (''Tyro Shorn'')
:* ''Tyro Anagnorizomene'' (''Tyro Rediscovered'').
