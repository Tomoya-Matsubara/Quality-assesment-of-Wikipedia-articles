The '''short-tail stingray''' or '''smooth stingray''' (''Dasyatis brevicaudata'') is a common [[species]] of [[Myliobatiformes|stingray]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Dasyatidae]]. It occurs off [[southern Africa]], typically offshore at a depth of {{convert|180|-|480|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and off southern [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], from the [[intertidal zone]] to a depth of {{convert|156|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is mostly [[benthic fish|bottom-dwelling]] in nature and can be found across a range of [[habitat]]s from [[estuaries]] to [[reef]]s, but also frequently swims into open water. The largest stingray in the world, this heavy-bodied species grows upwards of {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. Its plain-colored, diamond-shaped [[pectoral fin]] disc is characterized by a lack of [[dermal denticle]]s even in adults, and white pores beside the head on either side. Its tail is usually shorter than the disc and thick at the base, with a midline row of large thorns in front of the stinging spine and dorsal and ventral fin folds behind.

The diet of the short-tail stingray consists of [[invertebrate]]s and [[bony fish]]es, including burrowing and midwater species. It tends to remain within a relatively limited area throughout the year, preferring deeper waters during the winter, and is not known to perform long [[fish migration|migrations]]. Large aggregations of rays form seasonally at certain locations, such as in the summer at the [[Poor Knight Islands]] off New Zealand. Both birthing and mating have been documented within the aggregations at Poor Knights. This species is [[aplacental viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s sustained by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother; the litter size is 6<U+2013>10. The short-tail stingray is not aggressive but is capable of inflicting a potentially lethal wound with its long, [[venom]]ous sting. It is [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing|recreational fisheries]] throughout its range, usually surviving to be released. Because its population does not appear threatened by human activity, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has listed it under [[Least Concern]].

== Taxonomy ==

The original description of the short-tail stingray was made by [[Frederick Wollaston Hutton]], [[Curator]] of the [[Otago Museum]], from a female [[holotype|specimen]] {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} across caught off [[Dunedin]] in New Zealand. He published his account in an 1875 issue of the [[scientific journal]] ''Annals and Magazine of Natural History'', in which he named the new species ''Trygon brevicaudata'', derived from the [[Latin]] ''brevis'' ("short") and ''cauda'' ("tail"). Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the now-obsolete genus ''Bathytoshia'', and then to ''[[Dasyatis]]''.<ref name="hutton"/><ref name="bester"/> The short-tail stingray may also be referred to as giant black ray, giant stingray, New Zealand short-tail stingaree, Schreiners ray, short-tailed stingaree, shorttail black stingray, and smooth short-tailed stingray.<ref name="fishbase"/> It is closely related to the similar-looking but smaller [[pitted stingray]] (''Dasyatis matsubarai'') of the [[northwestern Pacific]].<ref name="hennemann"/>

== Distribution and habitat ==

[[Image:Narooma stingray.jpg|thumb|left|Off Australia and New Zealand, the short-tail stingray is common in shallow coastal waters.]]
The short-tail stingray is common and widely distributed in the [[temperate]] waters of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Off southern Africa, it has been reported from [[Cape Town]] in [[South Africa]] to the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]] in [[Mozambique]]. Along the southern Australian coast, it is found from [[Shark Bay]] in [[Western Australia]] to [[Maroochydore]] in [[Queensland]], including [[Tasmania]]. In [[New Zealand]] waters, it occurs off [[North Island]] and the [[Chatham Islands]], and rarely off [[South Island]] and the [[Kermadec Islands]]. Records from northern Australia and [[Thailand]] likely represent misidentifications of ''[[Himantura fai]]'' and ''D. matsubarai'' respectively.<ref name="last and stevens"/><ref name="bester"/> Over the past few decades, its range and numbers off southeastern Tasmania have grown, possibly as a result of [[climate change]].<ref name="last et al"/>

Off southern Africa, the short-tail stingray is rare in shallow water and most often found over offshore [[ocean bank (topography)|banks]] at a depth of {{convert|180|to|480|m|ft|abbr=on}}. On the other hand, off Australia and New Zealand it is found from the [[intertidal zone]] to no deeper than {{convert|156|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="iucn"/> Australian and New Zealand rays are most abundant in the shallows during the summer. A tracking study conducted on two New Zealand rays suggests that they shift to deeper waters during the winter, but do not undertake long-distance [[fish migration|migration]]s.<ref name="le port et al"/> The short-tail stingray is mainly [[benthic fish|bottom-dwelling]] in nature, inhabiting a variety of environments including [[brackish]] [[estuaries]], sheltered [[bay]]s and [[inlet]]s, sandy flats, rocky [[reef]]s, and the outer [[continental shelf]].<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="hennemann"/> However, it also makes regular forays upward into the middle of the [[water column]].<ref name="le port et al"/>

== Description ==

[[Image:Dasyatis brevicaudata nz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|As its common name suggests, tail length is one of the identifying traits of the short-tail stingray.]]
Heavily built and characteristically smooth, the [[pectoral fin]] disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, [[rhomboid]] shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading margins of the disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger [[spiracle]]s. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly-sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5<U+2013>7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a [[quincunx]] pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45<U+2013>55 tooth rows in either jaw. The [[pelvic fin]]s are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.<ref name="last and stevens"/><ref name="garrick"/>

The tail is usually shorter than the disc and bears one, sometimes two serrated stinging spines on the upper surface, about halfway along its length. It is broad and flattened until the base of the sting; after, it tapers rapidly and there is a prominent ventral fin fold running almost to the sting tip, as well as a low dorsal ridge. [[Dermal denticle]]s are only found on the tail, with at least one thorn appearing on the tail base by a disc width of {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Adults have a midline row of large, backward-pointing, spear-like thorns or flattened tubercles in front of the sting, as well as much smaller, conical thorns behind the sting covering the tail to the tip. The dorsal coloration is grayish brown, darkening towards the tip of the tail and above the eyes, with a line of white pores flanking the head on either side. The underside is whitish, darkening towards the fin margins and beneath the tail.<ref name="last and stevens"/><ref name="garrick"/> [[Albino]] individuals have been reported.<ref name="talent"/> The short-tail stingray is the largest stingray species,<ref name="iucn"/> known to reach at least {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in width, {{convert|4.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, and {{convert|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. Reliable observers off New Zealand have reported sighting individuals almost {{convert|3|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} across.<ref name="iucn"/> Mature females are about a third larger than mature males.<ref name="hennemann"/>

== Biology and ecology ==

[[Image:Dasyatis brevicaudata syndey.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The short-tail stingray mainly forages for food on or near the bottom.]]
The short-tail stingray is usually slow-moving but can achieve sudden bursts of speed, flapping its pectoral fins with enough force to [[cavitation|cavitate]] the water and create an audible "bang".<ref name="anthoni"/> It is known to form large seasonal aggregations; a well-known example occurs every summer (January to April) at the [[Poor Knights Islands]] off New Zealand, particularly under the rocky archways. In some areas it moves with the rising [[tide]] into very shallow water.<ref name="le port et al"/><ref name="michael"/> Individual rays tend to stay inside a relatively small home range with a radius of under {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="le port et al"/> Captive experiments have shown it capable of detecting [[magnetic field]]s via its [[electroreception|electroreceptive]] [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], which in nature may be employed for navigation.<ref name="molteno and kennedy"/>

The short-tail stingray forages for food both during the day and at night.<ref name="svane et al"/> It feeds primarily on [[benthic]] [[bony fish]]es and [[invertebrate]]s, such as [[mollusc]]s and [[crustacean]]s. The [[lateral line]] system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried [[bivalve]]s and [[echiura|spoon worm]]s, which are then extracted via suction; the excess water is expelled through the spiracles.<ref name="montgomery and skipworth"/> Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including [[salp]]s and [[Hyperiidae|hyperiid]] [[amphipod]]s, are also eaten in significant quantities.<ref name="le port et al"/> Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka squid (''Loligo vulgaris reynaudii'') during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn.<ref name="smale et al"/> The short-tail stingray has few predators due to its size; these include the [[copper shark]] (''Carcharhinus brachyurus''), the [[smooth hammerhead]] (''Sphryna zygaena''), the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), and the [[killer whale]] (''Orcinus orca'').<ref name="le port et al"/><ref name="bester"/> When threatened, it raises its tail warningly over its back like a [[scorpion]].<ref name="last and stevens"/> Smaller fishes have been observed using swimming rays for cover while hunting.<ref name="anthoni"/> Known [[parasite]]s of this species include the [[nematode]] ''Echinocephalus overstreeti'',<ref name="moravec and justine"/> and the [[monogenea]]ns ''Heterocotyle tokoloshei'' and ''Dendromonocotyle'' sp.<ref name="vaughan and chisholm"/><ref name="chisholm et al"/>

=== Life history ===

[[Image:F020511t.jpg|thumb|left|Short-tail stingrays gather every summer off the Poor Knights Islands, New Zealand.]]
The summer aggregations of the short-tail stingray at the Poor Knights Islands seem to at least partly serve a reproductive purpose, as both mating and birthing have been observed among the gathered rays. Courtship and mating take place in mid-water, and it has been speculated that the rising current flowing continuously through the narrow archways aids the rays in maintaining their position.<ref name="hennemann"/><ref name="anthoni"/> Each receptive female may be followed by several males, who attempt to bite and grip her disc. One or two males may be dragged by the female for hours before she accedes; the successful male flips upside-down beneath her, inserting one of his [[clasper]]s into her vent and rhythmically waving his tail from side to side. [[Copulation]] lasts 3<U+2013>5 minutes.<ref name="le port et al"/><ref name="michael"/>

Like other stingrays, the short-tail stingray is [[aplacental viviparous]]: once the developing [[embryo]]s exhaust their [[yolk]] supply, they are provisioned with histotroph ("uterine milk", enriched with [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[mucus]]) produced by the mother and delivered through specialized extensions of the uterine [[epithelium]] called "trophonemata".<ref name="bester"/> Females bear litters of 6<U+2013>10 pups in the summer; males appear to assist in the process by nudging the female's abdomen with their snouts. Females are ready to mate again shortly after giving birth.<ref name="last and stevens"/><ref name="hennemann"/><ref name="michael"/> Newborns measure {{convert|32|-|36|cm|in|abbr=on}} across.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="last and stevens"/>

== Human interactions ==

[[Image:Shorttail stingray sydney.jpg|thumb|A short-tail stingray at the Sydney Aquarium.]]
Curious and unaggressive, the short-tail stingray may approach humans and can be trained to be hand-fed.<ref name="aitken"/>  At [[Hamelin Bay, Western Australia|Hamelin Bay]] in Western Australia, many short-tail stingrays, [[thorntail stingray]]s (''D. thetidis''), and [[Australian bull ray]]s (''Myliobatis australis'') regularly gather to be hand-fed fish scraps; the number of visitors has steadily increased in recent years, and there is interest in developing the site as a permanent tourist attraction.<ref name="lewis and newsome"/> However, if startled or harrassed this species is capable of inflicting a serious, even fatal wound with its sting. The sting can measure over {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and penetrate most types of footwear, including [[kevlar]] [[wetsuit boot|bootee]]s; its mucous sheath contains a [[toxin]] that causes [[necrosis]]. The most dangerous injuries involve damage to a vital organ, massive blood loss, and/or secondary [[septicemia]] or [[tetanus]]. There have been cases where a startled ray had jumped out of the water and pierced a wader's chest cavity. This species is responsible for the majority of stingray injuries off New Zealand.<ref name="adams"/><ref name="slaughter et al"/>

Throughout its range, the short-tail stingray is [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by various [[commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] using [[trawl]]s, [[seine fishing|Danish and purse seine]]s, [[longline fishing|longline]]s and set lines, and [[fishing net|drag and set nets]]. It is also caught by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]] using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), [[spear fishing|spears]], and [[harpoon]]s. Most individuals caught are released alive; often fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice does not seem to have a significant impact on the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a small number are also kept for display in [[public aquarium]]s. As it survives fishing activities well and remains common throughout its range, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as [[Least Concern]]. Within most of this species' range off New Zealand, targeting it commercially is prohibited.<ref name="iucn"/>
