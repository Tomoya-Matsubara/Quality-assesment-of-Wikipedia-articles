Malcolm&nbsp;X was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. The events of his childhood, including his father's lessons concerning black pride and self-reliance, and his own experiences concerning race, played a significant role in Malcolm&nbsp;X's adult life. By the time he was thirteen, his father had died and his mother had been committed to a mental hospital. After living in a series of foster homes, Malcolm&nbsp;X became involved in [[Procuring (prostitution)|hustling]] and other criminal activities in [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]]. In 1946, Malcolm&nbsp;X was sentenced to eight to ten years in prison.

While in prison, Malcolm&nbsp;X became a member of the [[Nation of Islam]]. After his parole in 1952, he became one of the Nation's leaders and chief spokesmen. For nearly a dozen years, he was the public face of the Nation of Islam. Tension between Malcolm&nbsp;X and [[Elijah Muhammad]], head of the Nation of Islam, led to Malcolm&nbsp;X's departure from the organization in March 1964.

After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm&nbsp;X became a [[Sunni]] [[Islam|Muslim]] and made a [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]], after which he disavowed racism. He traveled extensively throughout Africa and the Middle East. He founded [[Muslim Mosque, Inc.]], a religious organization, and the secular, [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]], [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]]. Less than a year after he left the Nation of Islam, Malcolm&nbsp;X was assassinated by three members of the group while giving a speech in New York.

==Early years==
[[File:1930 census Little.gif|thumb|The Little family in the 1930 U.S. Census|alt=A ledger with names, ages, and other personal information]]
Malcolm Little was born on May 19, 1925, in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], to Earl and Louise Little ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Louisa Norton).<ref name=Perry2>Perry, p. 2.</ref> His father was an outspoken [[Baptist]] [[Laity|lay]] speaker. He supported [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] activist [[Marcus Garvey]] and was a local leader of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA).<ref>Perry, p. 3.</ref> Malcolm never forgot the values of [[black pride]] and self-reliance that his father and other UNIA leaders preached.<ref>Natambu, p. 7.</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X later said that three of Earl Little's brothers, one of whom was [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]], died violently at the hands of white men.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', pp. 3<U+2013>4. There have been many editions of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&nbsp;X''. Page numbers cited in the notes refer to the One World trade paperback edition (1992).</ref> Because of [[Ku Klux Klan]] threats, the family relocated in 1926 to [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and shortly thereafter to [[Lansing, Michigan]].

Earl Little was dark-skinned and born in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name=Natambu6>Natambu, p. 6.</ref> He had three children from his first marriage<U+2014>Ella, Mary, and Earl Jr.<U+2014>and seven with his second wife, Louise, Malcolm coming fourth<U+2014>Wilfred, Hilda, Philbert, Malcolm, Reginald, Yvonne, and Wesley.<ref>Perry, pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref>

Louise Little was born in [[Grenada]]. Because her father was [[Scottish people|Scottish]], she was so light-skinned that she could have [[Passing (racial identity)|passed]] for [[White people|white]]. Malcolm inherited his light complexion from his mother and maternal grandfather.<ref>Perry, pp. 2<U+2013>3.</ref> Initially he felt his light skin was a status symbol, but he later said he "hated every drop of that white rapist's blood that is in me."<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p. 5.</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X later remembered feeling that his father favored him because he was the lightest-skinned child in the family; however, he thought his mother treated him harshly for the same reason.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', pp. 7, 10<U+2013>11.</ref> One of Malcolm's nicknames, "Red", derived from the tinge of his hair. According to one biographer, at birth he had "ash-blonde hair ... tinged with cinnamon", and at age four, "reddish-blonde hair".<ref>Perry, pp. 2, 4.</ref> His hair darkened as he aged, yet he also resembled his paternal grandmother, whose hair "turned reddish in the summer sun."<ref name=Perry2/> The issue of skin color and skin tone took on very significant implications later in Malcolm's life.<ref name=Natambu6/>

In December 1924, Louise Little was threatened by Klansmen while she was pregnant with Malcolm. She recalled that the Klansmen warned the family to leave Omaha, because Earl Little's activities with UNIA were "spreading trouble".<ref>DeCaro, pp. 43<U+2013>44.</ref>

After they moved to Lansing, their house was burned in 1929, however the family escaped without physical injury. On September 28, 1931, Earl Little was fatally struck by a [[Tram|streetcar]] in Lansing. Authorities ruled his death an accident. The police reported that Earl Little was conscious when they arrived on the scene, and he told them he had slipped and fallen under the streetcar's wheels.<ref>Perry, p. 12.</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X later remembered that the black community disputed the cause of death, believing there was circumstantial evidence of assault. His family had frequently been harassed by the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] group that his father accused of burning down their home in 1929. Some blacks believed the Black Legion was responsible for Earl Little's death. As Malcolm later wrote, "How could my father bash himself in the head, then get down across the streetcar tracks to be run over?"<ref name=Auto14>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p. 14.</ref>

Though Earl Little had two [[life insurance]] policies, his family received death benefits solely from the smaller policy. The insurance company of the larger policy claimed that his father had committed suicide and refused to issue the benefit.<ref>Natambu, p. 10.</ref> Several years after her husband's death, Louise had her youngest son, Robert Little, by an unnamed partner.<ref>Perry, p. 24.</ref> In December 1938, Louise Little had a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and was declared legally [[Insanity|insane]]. The Little siblings were split up and sent to different [[Foster care|foster homes]]. The state formally committed Louise Little to the state mental hospital at [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], where she remained until Malcolm and his siblings secured her release 26 years later.<ref>Perry, pp. 33<U+2013>34, 331.</ref>

Malcolm Little was one of the best students in his [[Middle school|junior high school]], but he dropped out after a white eighth-grade teacher told him that his aspirations of being a [[lawyer]] were "no realistic goal for a <!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS EXACT QUOTE. THANK YOU --> [[nigger]]."<ref name=Perry42>Perry, p. 42.</ref> Years later, Malcolm&nbsp;X would laugh about the incident, but at the time it was humiliating. It made him feel that there was no place in the white world for a career-oriented black man, no matter how smart he was.<ref name=Perry42/> After living with a series of white [[Foster care|foster parents]], Malcolm moved to [[Boston]] in February 1941 to live with his older half-sister, Ella Little Collins.<ref>Natambu, pp. 21<U+2013>29.</ref><ref>Perry, pp. 32<U+2013>48.</ref>

==Young adult years==
Collins lived in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], a predominantly African-American middle-class neighborhood of Boston. It was the first time Little had seen so many black people. He was drawn to the cultural and social life of the neighborhood.<ref>Natambu, pp. 30<U+2013>31.</ref>

In Boston, Little held a variety of jobs and found intermittent employment with the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven Railroad]]. Between 1943 and 1946, he drifted from city to city and job to job. He left Boston to live for a short time in [[Flint, Michigan]]. He moved to New York City in 1943. Living in [[Harlem]], he became involved in [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealing]], [[gambling]], [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], [[robbery]], and [[Procuring (prostitution)|steering prostitutes]].<ref>Perry, pp. 58<U+2013>81.</ref><!--BEFORE remove this information, feel free discussing it in the talkpage--> According to biographer Bruce Perry, Little occasionally engaged in [[Men who have sex with men|sex with other men]], usually for money.<ref>Perry, p. 77.</ref> No other biographers have written about such sexual encounters.<ref>[[Arnold Rampersad|Rampersad, Arnold]], "The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's ''Malcolm'' and Malcolm's Malcolm", Wood, p. 131.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Richardson |first1=Rich<U+00E9> |title=Black Masculinity and the U.S. South: From Uncle Tom to Gangsta |year=2007 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |location=Athens, Ga. |isbn=0-8203-2609-7 |page=157 }}</ref>

In 1943, the [[Conscription in the United States|U.S. draft board]] ordered Little to register for military service.<ref name=Carson108>Carson, p. 108.</ref> He later recalled that he put on a display to avoid the draft by telling the examining officer that he could not wait to "steal us some guns, and kill us [some] [[Cracker (pejorative)|crackers]]."<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p. 124.</ref> Military physicians classified him as "mentally disqualified for military service". He was issued a [[4F (military conscription)|4-F]] card, relieving him of his service obligations.<ref name=Carson108/>

In late 1945, Little returned to Boston. With a group of associates, he began a series of elaborate burglaries targeting the residences of wealthy white families.<ref>Natambu, pp. 106<U+2013>109.</ref> On January 12, 1946, Little was arrested for burglary while trying to pick up a stolen watch he had left for repairs at a jewelry shop.<ref>Perry, p. 99.</ref> The shop owner called the police because the watch was very expensive, and the police had alerted all Boston jewelers that it had been stolen. Little told the police that he had a gun on his person and surrendered so the police would treat him more leniently.<ref>Natambu, pp. 110<U+2013>111.</ref> Two days later, Little was indicted for carrying firearms. On January 16, he was charged with [[larceny]] and [[Burglary|breaking and entering]], and eventually sentenced to eight to ten years in prison.<ref name=Carson99>Carson, p. 99.</ref>

On February 27, Little began serving his sentence at the [[Charlestown State Prison]] in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]], Boston. While in prison, Little earned the nickname of "[[Satan]]" for his hostility toward religion.<ref>Perry, pp. 104<U+2013>106.</ref> Little met a self-educated man in prison named John Elton Bembry (referred to as "Bimbi" in ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm&nbsp;X]]'').<ref>Natambu, p. 121.</ref> Bembry was a well-regarded prisoner at Charlestown, and Malcolm&nbsp;X would later describe him as "the first man I had ever seen command total respect ... with words."<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p. 178; ellipsis in original.</ref> Gradually, the two men became friends and Bembry convinced Little to educate himself.<ref>Perry, pp. 108<U+2013>110.</ref> Little developed a voracious appetite for reading, and he frequently read after the prison lights had been turned off.<ref>Perry, p. 118.</ref>

In 1948, Little's brother Philbert wrote, telling him about the [[Nation of Islam]]. Like the UNIA, the Nation preached black self-reliance and, ultimately, the unification of members of the [[African diaspora]], free from white American and European domination.<ref>Natambu, pp. 127<U+2013>128.</ref> Little was not interested in joining until his brother Reginald wrote, saying, "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you how to get out of prison."<ref>Natambu, p. 128.</ref> Little quit smoking, and the next time pork was served in the prison dining hall, he refused to eat it.<ref>Perry, p. 113.</ref>

When Reginald came to visit Little, he described the group's teachings, including the belief that white people are devils. Afterward, Little thought about all the white people he had known, and he realized that he'd never had a relationship with a white person or social institution that wasn't based on dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred. Little began to reconsider his dismissal of all religion and he became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam. Other family members who had joined the Nation wrote or visited and encouraged Little to join.<ref>Natambu, pp. 132<U+2013>138.</ref>

In February 1948, mostly through his sister's efforts, Little was transferred to an experimental prison in [[Norfolk, Massachusetts]], a facility that had a much larger library.<ref>Perry, pp. 113<U+2013>114.</ref> In late 1948, he wrote a letter to [[Elijah Muhammad]], the leader of the Nation of Islam. Muhammad advised him to atone for his crimes by renouncing his past and by humbly bowing in prayer to [[Allah]] and promising never to engage in destructive behavior again. Little, who always had been rebellious and deeply skeptical, found it very difficult to bow in prayer. It took him a week to bend his knees. Finally he prayed, and he became a member of the Nation of Islam.<ref>Natambu, pp. 138<U+2013>139.</ref> For the remainder of his incarceration, Little maintained regular correspondence with Muhammad.<ref>Perry, p. 116.</ref>

On August 7, 1952, Little was [[parole]]d and was released from prison.<ref name=Carson99/> He later reflected on the time he spent in prison after his conversion: "Months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned. In fact, up to then, I had never been so truly free in my life."<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p. 199.</ref>

==Nation of Islam==

In 1952, after his release from prison, Little visited Elijah Muhammad in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref>Perry, pp. 142, 144<U+2013>145.</ref> Then, like many members of the Nation of Islam, he changed his surname to "X". In his autobiography, Malcolm&nbsp;X explained the "X": "The Muslim's 'X' symbolized the true African family name that he never could know. For me, my 'X' replaced the white slavemaster name of 'Little' which some blue-eyed devil named Little had imposed upon my paternal forebears."<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p. 229.</ref>

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] opened a file on Malcolm&nbsp;X in March 1953 after hearing from an informant that Malcolm&nbsp;X described himself as a [[Communist]]. Soon the FBI turned its attention from concerns about possible Communist Party association to Malcolm&nbsp;X's rapid ascent in the Nation of Islam.<ref>Carson, p. 95.</ref>

In June 1953, Malcolm&nbsp;X was named assistant minister of the Nation of Islam's Temple Number One<ref>The Nation of Islam numbered its Temples according to the order in which they were established. Perry, pp. 141<U+2013>142.</ref> in Detroit.<ref>Natambu, p. 168.</ref> By late 1953, he established Boston's Temple Number Eleven.<ref>Perry, p. 147.</ref> In March 1954, Malcolm&nbsp;X expanded Temple Number Twelve in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Perry, p. 152.</ref> Two months later he was selected to lead the Nation of Islam's [[Mosque No. 7|Temple Number Seven]] in Harlem.<ref>Perry, p. 153.</ref> He rapidly expanded its membership.<ref>Perry, pp. 161<U+2013>164.</ref> After a 1959 television broadcast in New York City about the Nation of Islam, ''[[The Hate That Hate Produced]]'', Malcolm&nbsp;X became known to a much wider audience. Representatives of the print media, radio, and television frequently asked him for comments on issues. He was also sought as a spokesman by reporters from other countries.<ref>Perry, pp. 174<U+2013>179.</ref>

Beside his skill as a speaker, Malcolm&nbsp;X had an impressive physical presence. He stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m}} tall and weighed about {{convert|180|lb|kg}}.<ref name=Marable301>Marable, p. 301.</ref> According to one writer, Malcolm&nbsp;X was "powerfully built",<ref>Lincoln, p. 189.</ref> and another described him as a "mesmerizingly handsome ... and always spotlessly well-groomed".<ref name=Marable301/>

From his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he left the organization in 1964, Malcolm&nbsp;X promoted the [[#Beliefs of the Nation of Islam|Nation's teachings]]. He taught that black people were the original people of the world,<ref name=Lomax55>Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p. 55.</ref> and that white people were a race of devils.<ref name=Perry115>Perry, p. 115.</ref> In his speeches, Malcolm&nbsp;X said that [[Black supremacy|black people were superior]] to white people, and that the demise of the white race was imminent.<ref name=Lomax57>Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p. 57.</ref>

While the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights movement]] fought against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], Malcolm&nbsp;X advocated the complete [[Black separatism|separation]] of African Americans from white people. He proposed the establishment of a separate country for black people<ref name=Lomax149-152>Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp. 149<U+2013>152.</ref> as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa.<ref name=Supremacy78>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''End of White World Supremacy'', p. 78.</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X also rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of [[nonviolence]] and instead advocated that black people use any necessary means of self-defense to protect themselves.<ref name="Lomax 173-174">Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp. 173<U+2013>174.</ref>

Malcolm&nbsp;X's speeches had a powerful effect on his audiences, generally African Americans who lived in the [[Northern United States|Northern]] and [[Western United States|Western]] cities who were tired of being told to wait for freedom, justice, equality, and respect.<ref>Natambu, p. 182.</ref> Many blacks felt that he articulated their complaints better than the civil rights movement did.<ref name=Cone99-100>Cone, pp. 99<U+2013>100.</ref><ref name=West>{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Cornel |authorlink1=Cornel West |editor1-last=Sayres |editor1-first=Sohnya |editor2-last=Stephanson |editor2-first=Anders |editor3-last=Aronowitz |editor3-first=Stanley |editor3-link=Stanley Aronowitz |editor4-last=Jameson |editor4-first=Fredric |editor4-link=Fredric Jameson |title=The 60s Without Apology |year=1984 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=0-8166-1336-2 |page=51 |chapter=The Paradox of the Afro-American Rebellion }}</ref>

Many white people, and some blacks, were alarmed by Malcolm&nbsp;X and the things he said. He and the Nation of Islam were described as hatemongers, black segregationists, violence-seekers, and a threat to improved race relations. Civil rights organizations denounced Malcolm&nbsp;X and the Nation as irresponsible extremists whose views were not representative of African Americans.<ref>Natambu, pp. 215<U+2013>216.</ref>

Malcolm&nbsp;X was equally critical of the civil rights movement.<ref>Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp. 79<U+2013>80.</ref> He described its leaders as "stooges" for the white establishment and said that [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was a "chump".<ref>Perry, p. 203.</ref><ref>King expressed mixed feelings toward Malcolm&nbsp;X. "He is very articulate, ... but I totally disagree with many of his political and philosophical views.... I don't want to seem to sound self-righteous, ... or that I think I have the only truth, the only way. Maybe he does have some of the answer.... I have often wished that he would talk less of violence, because violence is not going to solve our problem. And in his litany of articulating the despair of the Negro without offering any positive, creative alternative, I feel that Malcolm has done himself and our people a great disservice.... [U]rging Negroes to arm themselves and prepare to engage in violence, as he has done, can reap nothing but grief." {{cite web |url=http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/features/mlk/index.html |title=The Playboy Interview: Martin Luther King |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |last=Haley |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Haley |year=1965 |month=January |work=[[Playboy]] }}</ref> He criticized the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], which he called "the farce on Washington".<ref>Cone, p. 113.</ref> He said he did not know why black people were excited over a demonstration "run by whites in front of a statue of a president who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn't like us when he was alive".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/malcolmx/timeline/timeline2.html |title=Timeline |accessdate=July 27, 2008 |date=May 19, 2005 |work=[[Malcolm&nbsp;X: Make It Plain]], [[American Experience]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] }}</ref>

Malcolm&nbsp;X has been widely considered the second most influential leader of the Nation of Islam after Elijah Muhammad.<ref>Cone, p. 91.</ref> He was largely credited with increasing membership in the Nation of Islam from 500 in 1952 to 25,000 in 1963.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lomax |title=When the Word Is Given |pages=15<U+2013>16 |quote=Estimates of the Black Muslim membership vary from a quarter of a million down to fifty thousand.

In early 1963, Malcolm&nbsp;X started collaborating with [[Alex Haley]] on ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&nbsp;X''.<ref name=Perry214>Perry, p. 214.</ref> In 1964, he told Haley, "If I'm alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle."<ref>Haley, "Epilogue", ''Autobiography'', p. 471.</ref> The book was not finished when Malcolm&nbsp;X was assassinated in 1965. Haley completed it and published it later that year.<ref>Perry, p. 375.</ref>

==Marriage and family==
On January 14, 1958, Malcolm&nbsp;X married [[Betty Shabazz|Betty&nbsp;X (n<U+00E9>e Sanders)]] in Lansing, Michigan.<ref>Rickford, pp. 73<U+2013>74.</ref> The two had been friends for several years and<U+2014>although they had never discussed the subject<U+2014>Betty X suspected that he was interested in marriage.

==Meeting Fidel Castro and other world leaders==
In September 1960, [[Fidel Castro]] arrived in New York to attend the meeting of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. He and his entourage stayed at the [[Hotel Theresa]] in Harlem. Malcolm&nbsp;X was a prominent member of a Harlem-based welcoming committee made up of community leaders who met with Castro.<ref>Natambu, pp. 230<U+2013>232.</ref> Castro was so impressed by Malcolm&nbsp;X that he requested a private meeting with him. At the end of their two-hour meeting, Castro invited Malcolm&nbsp;X to visit him in Cuba.<ref>Lincoln, p. 18.</ref> During the General Assembly meeting, Malcolm&nbsp;X was also invited to many official embassy functions sponsored by African nations, where he met heads of state and other leaders, including [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Egypt]], [[Ahmed S<U+00E9>kou Tour<U+00E9>]] of [[Guinea]], and [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of the [[Zambian African National Congress]].<ref>Natambu, pp. 231<U+2013>233.</ref>

==Leaving the Nation of Islam==
On December 1, 1963, when he was asked for a comment about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]], Malcolm&nbsp;X said that it was a case of "chickens coming home to roost". He added that "chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they've always made me glad."<ref name=Times63-12-02>{{cite web |title=Malcolm&nbsp;X Scores U.S. and Kennedy |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0812FE35541A7B93C0A91789D95F478685F9 |work=The New York Times |page=21 |date=December 2, 1963 |accessdate=July 28, 2008 }}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "in further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of [[Patrice Lumumba]], Congo leader, of [[Medgar Evers]], civil rights leader, and of the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Negro girls bombed]] earlier this year in a [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] church. These, he said, were instances of other 'chickens coming home to roost'."<ref name=Times63-12-02/>

The remarks prompted a widespread public outcry. The Nation of Islam, which had issued a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination, publicly censured their former shining star.<ref>Natambu, pp. 288<U+2013>290.</ref> Although Malcolm&nbsp;X retained his post and rank as minister, he was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days.<ref>Perry, p. 242.</ref>

On March 8, 1964, Malcolm&nbsp;X publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam. He said that he was still a Muslim, but he felt the Nation of Islam had "gone as far as it can" because of its rigid religious teachings.<ref name=Times64-03-09>{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D17FB395415738DDDA00894DB405B848AF1D3 |title=Malcolm&nbsp;X Splits with Muhammad |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |last=Handler |first=M. S. |date=March 9, 1964 |work=The New York Times }}</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X said he was going to organize a [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] organization that would try to "heighten the political consciousness" of African Americans.<ref name=Times64-03-09/> He also expressed his desire to work with other civil rights leaders and said that Elijah Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past.<ref name=Times64-03-09/>

One reason for the separation was growing tension between Malcolm&nbsp;X and Elijah Muhammad because of Malcolm&nbsp;X's dismay about rumors of Muhammad's extramarital affairs with young secretaries. Such actions were against the teachings of the Nation. Although at first Malcolm&nbsp;X ignored the rumors, he spoke with Muhammad's son [[Warith Deen Mohammed|Wallace]] and the women making the accusations. He came to believe that they were true, and Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963. Muhammad tried to justify his actions by referring to precedents by Biblical prophets.<ref>Perry, pp. 230<U+2013>234</ref>

Another reason was resentment by people within the Nation. As Malcolm&nbsp;X had become a favorite of the media, many in the Nation's Chicago headquarters felt that he was over-shadowing Muhammad. [[Louis Lomax]]'s 1963 book about the Nation of Islam, ''When the Word Is Given'', featured a picture of Malcolm&nbsp;X on its cover and included five of his speeches, but only one of Muhammad's, which greatly upset Muhammad. Muhammad was also envious that a publisher was interested in Malcolm&nbsp;X's autobiography.<ref name=Perry214/>

After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm&nbsp;X founded [[Muslim Mosque, Inc.]], a religious organization,<ref>Perry, pp. 251<U+2013>252.</ref><ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&nbsp;X Speaks'', pp. 18<U+2013>22.</ref> and the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]], a secular group that advocated [[Pan-Africanism]].<ref>Perry, pp. 294<U+2013>296.</ref><ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''By Any Means Necessary'', pp. 33<U+2013>67.</ref> On March 26, 1964, he met [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], after a press conference which followed both men attending the [[United States Senate|Senate]] to hear the debate on the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights bill]]. This was the only time the two men ever met; their meeting lasted only one minute, just long enough for photographers to take a picture.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cone |title= |page=2 |quote=There was no time for substantive discussions between the two. They were photographed greeting each other warmly, smiling and shaking hands. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Perry |title= |page=255 |quote=Camera shutters clicked. The next day, the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', the ''New York World Telegram and Sun'', and other dailies carried a picture of Malcolm and Martin shaking hands. }}</ref>

In April, Malcolm&nbsp;X made a speech titled "[[The Ballot or the Bullet]]" in which he advised African Americans to exercise their right to vote wisely.<ref>Perry, pp. 257<U+2013>259.</ref><ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&nbsp;X Speaks'', pp. 23<U+2013>44.</ref> Several Sunni Muslims encouraged Malcolm&nbsp;X to learn about Islam. Soon he converted to [[Sunni Islam]], and decided to make his [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]] (''hajj'').<ref>Perry, p. 261.</ref>

==International travel==
===Pilgrimage to Mecca===
On April 13, 1964, Malcolm&nbsp;X departed [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] in New York for [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. His status as an authentic Muslim was questioned by Saudi authorities because of his United States [[passport]] and his inability to speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Since only confessing Muslims are allowed into [[Mecca]], he was separated from his group for about 20 hours.<ref>Perry, pp. 262<U+2013>263.</ref><ref>DeCaro, p. 204.</ref>

According to his autobiography, Malcolm&nbsp;X saw a telephone and remembered the book ''The Eternal Message of Muhammad'' by [[Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam]], which had been presented to him with his visa approval. He called Azzam's son, who arranged for his release. At the younger Azzam's home, he met Azzam Pasha, who gave Malcolm his suite at the Jeddah Palace Hotel. The next morning, Muhammad Faisal, the son of [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faisal]], visited and informed Malcolm&nbsp;X that he was to be a state guest. The deputy chief of protocol accompanied Malcolm&nbsp;X to the Hajj Court, where he was allowed to make his pilgrimage.<ref>Perry, pp. 263<U+2013>265.</ref>

On April 19, Malcolm&nbsp;X completed the [[Hajj]], making the seven circuits around the [[Kaaba]], drinking from the [[Zamzam Well]], and running between the hills of [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Safah and Marwah]] seven times.<ref>Perry, pp. 265<U+2013>266.</ref> After completing the Hajj, he was granted an audience with Prince Faisal.<ref>Perry, p. 267.</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X said the trip allowed him to see Muslims of different [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] interacting as equals. He came to believe that Islam could be the means by which racial problems could be overcome.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', pp. 388<U+2013>393.</ref>

===Africa===
Malcolm&nbsp;X visited Africa on three separate occasions, once in 1959 and twice in 1964. During his visits, he met officials, gave interviews to newspapers, and spoke on television and radio in [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Tanganyika]] (now [[Tanzania]]), [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], Guinea, [[Sudan]], [[Senegal]], [[Liberia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Morocco]].<ref>Natambu, pp. 304<U+2013>305.</ref> [[Kwame Nkrumah]] of Ghana, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Egypt]], and [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] of [[Algeria]] invited Malcolm&nbsp;X to serve in their governments.<ref name=Natambu308>Natambu, p. 308.</ref>

In 1959, Malcolm&nbsp;X traveled to [[Egypt]] (then known as the [[United Arab Republic]]), [[Sudan]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Ghana]] to arrange a tour for Elijah Muhammad.<ref>Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p. 62.</ref> The first of the two trips Malcolm&nbsp;X made to Africa in 1964 lasted from April 13 until May 21, before and after his Hajj.<ref>Natambu, p. 303.</ref> On May 8, following his speech at the [[University of Ibadan]], Malcolm&nbsp;X was made an honorary member of the Nigerian Muslim Students' Association. During this reception the students bestowed upon him the name "Omowale", which means "the son who has come home" in the [[Yoruba language]].<ref>Perry, p. 269.</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X wrote in his autobiography that he "had never received a more treasured honor."<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p. 403.</ref>

On July 9, 1964, Malcolm&nbsp;X returned to Africa.<ref>Carson, p. 305.</ref> On July 17, he was welcomed to the second meeting of the [[Organization of African Unity]] in Cairo as a representative of the Organization of Afro-American Unity. By the time he returned to the United States on November 24, 1964, Malcolm had met with every prominent African leader and established an international connection between Africans on the continent and those in the [[diaspora]].<ref name=Natambu308/>

===France and the United Kingdom===
On November 23, 1964, on his way home from Africa, Malcolm&nbsp;X stopped in Paris, where he spoke at the Salle de la Mutualit<U+00E9>.<ref>Bethune, Lebert, "Malcolm&nbsp;X in Europe", Clarke, pp. 226<U+2013>231.</ref><ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''By Any Means Necessary'', pp. 113<U+2013>126.</ref> A week later, on November 30, Malcolm&nbsp;X flew to the United Kingdom, and on December 3 participated in a debate at the [[Oxford Union]]. The topic of the debate was "Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is No Vice; Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is No Virtue", and Malcolm&nbsp;X argued the affirmative. Interest in the debate was so high that it was televised nationally by the [[BBC]].<ref>Bethune, "Malcolm&nbsp;X in Europe", Clarke, pp. 231<U+2013>233.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brothermalcolm.net/2003/mx_oxford/index.html |title=Malcolm&nbsp;X Oxford Debate |accessdate=July 30, 2008 |author=Malcolm&nbsp;X |date=December 3, 1964 |publisher=Malcolm&nbsp;X: A Research Site }}</ref>

On February 5, 1965, Malcolm&nbsp;X went to Europe again.<ref>Carson, p. 349.</ref> On February 8, he spoke in London, before the first meeting of the Council of African Organizations.<ref>Perry, p. 351.</ref> The next day, Malcolm&nbsp;X tried to go to France, but he was refused entry.<ref>Natambu, p. 312.</ref> On February 12, he visited [[Smethwick]], near [[Birmingham]], which had become a byword for racial division after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]], when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the parliamentary seat after rumors that their candidate's supporters had used the slogan "If you want a nigger for your neighbour, vote [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irr.org.uk/2005/february/ak000010.html |title=Black British History: Remembering Malcolm's Visit to Smethwick |accessdate=July 30, 2008 |last=Kundnani |first=Arun |date=February 10, 2005 |work=Independent Race and Refugee News Network |publisher=[[Institute of Race Relations]] }}</ref>

==In the United States==
[[file:Malcolm X NYWTS 4.jpg|right|thumb|Malcolm&nbsp;X in 1964|link=|alt=]]

After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm&nbsp;X spoke before a wide variety of audiences in the United States. He spoke at regular meetings of Muslim Mosque, Inc., and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He was one of the most sought-after speakers on college campuses,<ref>Terrill, p. 9.</ref> and one of his top aides later wrote that he "welcomed every opportunity to speak to college students."<ref>Karim, p. 128.</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X also spoke before political groups such as the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Militant Labor Forum]].<ref name=Perry277-278>Perry, pp. 277<U+2013>278.</ref>

Tensions increased between Malcolm&nbsp;X and the Nation of Islam. As early as February 1964, a member of Temple Number Seven was given orders by the Nation of Islam to wire explosives to Malcolm&nbsp;X's car.<ref>Karim, pp. 159<U+2013>160.</ref> In September 1964, ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' published a photograph of Malcolm&nbsp;X holding an [[M1 carbine|M1 Carbine]] and peering out a window. The photo was intended to illustrate his determination to defend himself and his family against the death threats he was receiving.<ref>{{cite news |last=Massaquoi |first=Hans J. |title=Mystery of Malcolm&nbsp;X |work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] |date=September 1964 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/921123/archive_018698.htm |title=The Legacy of Malcolm&nbsp;X |last1=Lord |first1=Lewis |last2=Thornton |first2=Jeannye |last3=Bodipo-Memba |first3=Alejandro |date=November 15, 1992 |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |accessdate=June 2, 2010 }}</ref>

The Nation of Islam and its leaders began making threats against Malcolm&nbsp;X both in private and in public. On March 23, 1964, Elijah Muhammad told Boston minister Louis X (later known as [[Louis Farrakhan]]) that hypocrites like Malcolm should have "their heads cut off."<ref>Kondo, p. 170.</ref> The April 10 edition of ''[[Muhammad Speaks]]'' featured a cartoon in which his severed head was shown bouncing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/mxp/images/sourcebook_img_111.jpg |title=On My Own |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |last=Majied |first=Eugene |date=April 10, 1964 |work=[[Muhammad Speaks]] |publisher=[[Nation of Islam]] }}</ref> On July 9, John Ali, a top aide to Muhammad, answered a question about Malcolm&nbsp;X by saying that "anyone who opposes the Honorable Elijah Muhammad puts their life in jeopardy."<ref>Evanzz, p. 248.</ref> The December 4 issue of ''Muhammad Speaks'' included an article by Louis X that railed against Malcolm&nbsp;X and said that "such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death."<ref>Evanzz, p. 264.</ref>

Some threats were made anonymously. During the month of June 1964, FBI surveillance recorded two such threats. On June 8, a man called Malcolm&nbsp;X's home and told Betty Shabazz to "tell him he's as good as dead."<ref>Carson, p. 473.</ref> On June 12, an FBI informant reported getting an anonymous telephone call from somebody who said "Malcolm&nbsp;X is going to be bumped off."<ref>Carson, p. 324.</ref>

In June 1964, the Nation of Islam sued to reclaim Malcolm&nbsp;X's residence in [[Queens]], New York, which they claimed to own. The suit was successful, and Malcolm&nbsp;X was ordered to vacate.<ref>Perry, pp. 290<U+2013>292.</ref> On February 14, 1965, the night before a scheduled hearing to postpone the eviction date, the house burned to the ground. Malcolm&nbsp;X and his family survived. No one was charged with any crime.<ref>Perry, pp. 352<U+2013>356.</ref>

<blockquote>There are those who will consider it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times.

Many will say turn away<U+2014>away from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black man<U+2014>and we will smile. They will say that he is of hate<U+2014>a fanatic, a racist<U+2014>who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him.

===Responses to assassination===
Reactions to Malcolm&nbsp;X's assassination were varied. Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] sent a telegram to Betty Shabazz, expressing his sadness over "the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband."

<blockquote>While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/telegram_from_martin_luther_king_jr_to_betty_al_shabazz/ |title=Telegram from Martin Luther King, Jr. to Betty al-Shabazz |last=King, Jr. |first=Martin Luther |authorlink=Martin Luther King, Jr. |publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute |date=February 26, 1965 |accessdate=March 21, 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>

[[Elijah Muhammad]] told the annual [[Savior's Day]] convention on February 26, "Malcolm&nbsp;X got just what he preached."<ref>Evanzz, p. 301.</ref> "We didn't want to kill Malcolm and didn't try to kill him," Muhammad said. "We know such ignorant, foolish teachings would bring him to his own end."<ref>Clegg, p. 232.</ref> 

''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Malcolm&nbsp;X was "an extraordinary and twisted man" who "turn[ed] many true gifts to evil purpose" and that his life was "strangely and pitifully wasted".<ref name=Times65-02-22>{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20E13F63F5812738DDDAB0A94DA405B858AF1D3 |title=Malcolm&nbsp;X |accessdate=August 2, 2008 |date=February 22, 1965 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote that "even his sharpest critics recognized his brilliance<U+2014>often wild, unpredictable and eccentric, but nevertheless possessing promise that must now remain unrealized."<ref>Rickford, p. 247.</ref>

The ''[[Daily Times of Nigeria]]'' wrote that Malcolm&nbsp;X "will have a place in the palace of martyrs."<ref name=Evanzz305>Evanzz, p. 305.</ref> The ''[[Ghanaian Times]]'' likened him to [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and [[Patrice Lumumba]] among "a host of Africans and Americans who were martyred in freedom's cause".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D15F73F5812738DDDAF0A94DA405B858AF1D3 |title=Malcolm Called a Martyr Abroad |accessdate=August 2, 2008 |last=Kenworthy |first=E.

''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]'', published in [[Beijing]], stated that "Malcolm was murdered because he fought for freedom and equal rights."<ref>Evanzz, p. 306.</ref> In Cuba, ''El Mundo'' described the assassination as "another racist crime to eradicate by violence the struggle against discrimination".<ref name=Rickford248>Rickford, p. 248.</ref>

===Allegations of conspiracy===
Within days of the assassination, questions were raised about who bore ultimate responsibility. On February 23, James Farmer, the leader of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], announced at a news conference that local drug dealers, and not the Nation of Islam, were to blame.<ref>Perry, p. 371.</ref> Others accused the [[New York City Police Department|New York Police Department]], the FBI, or the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], citing the lack of police protection, the ease with which the assassins entered the Audubon Ballroom, and the failure of the police to preserve the crime scene.<ref>Marable, pp. 305<U+2013>306.</ref><ref>Perry, p. 372.</ref>

In the 1970s, the public learned about [[COINTELPRO]] and other secret FBI programs directed towards infiltrating and disrupting civil rights organizations during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref>Kondo, pp. 7<U+2013>39.</ref> John Ali, national secretary of the Nation of Islam, was identified as an FBI undercover agent.<ref name=Lomax198>Lomax, ''To Kill a Black Man'', p. 198.</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X had confided in a reporter that Ali exacerbated tensions between him and Elijah Muhammad. He considered Ali his "archenemy" within the Nation of Islam leadership.<ref name=Lomax198/> On February 20, 1965, the night before the assassination, Ali met with Talmadge Hayer, one of the men convicted of killing Malcolm&nbsp;X.<ref>Evanzz, p. 294.</ref>

In 1977 and 1978, Talmadge Hayer submitted [[Hayer affidavits|two sworn affidavits]] re-asserting his claim that Butler and Johnson were not involved in the assassination. In his affidavits Hayer named four men, all members of the Nation of Islam's [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] Temple Number 25, as having participated with him in the crime. Hayer asserted that a man, later identified as Wilbur McKinley, shouted and threw a smoke bomb to create a diversion. Hayer said that another man, later identified as William Bradley, had a shotgun and was the first to fire on Malcolm&nbsp;X after the diversion. Hayer asserted that he and a man later identified as Leon David, both armed with pistols, fired on Malcolm&nbsp;X immediately after the shotgun blast. Hayer also said that a fifth man, later identified as Benjamin Thomas, was involved in the conspiracy.<ref name=Bush>{{cite book |last=Bush |first=Roderick |title=We Are Not What We Seem: Black Nationalism and Class Struggle in the American Century |year=1999 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8147-1317-3 |page=179 }}</ref><ref name=Friedly>{{cite book |last=Friedly |first=Michael |title=Malcolm&nbsp;X: The Assassination |year=1992 |publisher=Carroll & Graf |location=New York |isbn=0-88184-922-7 }}</ref> Hayer's statements failed to convince authorities to reopen their investigation of the murder.<ref name=Gardell>{{cite book |last=Gardell |first=Mattias |title=In the Name of Elijah Muhammad: Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam |year=1996 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, N.

==Philosophy==
Except for his autobiography, Malcolm&nbsp;X left no writings. His philosophy is known almost entirely from the myriad speeches and interviews he gave between 1952 until his death in 1965.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kelley |first=Robin D. G. |authorlink=Robin D.G.

===Beliefs of the Nation of Islam===
{{Further|[[Beliefs and theology of the Nation of Islam]]}}
Before he left the Nation of Islam in 1964, Malcolm&nbsp;X taught its beliefs in his speeches. His speeches were peppered with the phrase "The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that ...".<ref name=Lomax80-81>Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp. 80<U+2013>81.</ref> It is virtually impossible to discern whether Malcolm&nbsp;X's beliefs diverged from the teachings of the Nation of Islam.<ref>Terrill, p. 184.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lomax |title=When the Word Is Given |page=91 |quote='I'll be honest with you,' Malcolm&nbsp;X said to me. 'Everybody is talking about differences between the Messenger and me. It is absolutely impossible for us to differ.' }}</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X once compared himself to a ventriloquist's dummy who could only say what Elijah Muhammad told him.<ref name=Lomax80-81/>

Malcolm&nbsp;X taught that black people were the original people of the world,<ref name=Lomax55/> and that white people were a race of devils who were created by an evil scientist named [[Yakub (Nation of Islam)|Yakub]].<ref name=Perry115/> The Nation of Islam believed that [[Black supremacy|black people were superior]] to white people, and that the demise of the white race was imminent.<ref name=Lomax57/>

When he was questioned concerning his statements that white people were devils, Malcolm&nbsp;X said that "history proves the white man is a devil."<ref>Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p. 67.</ref> He enumerated some of the historical reasons that, he felt, supported his argument: "Anybody who rapes, and plunders, and enslaves, and steals, and drops hell bombs on people... anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil."<ref>Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p. 171.</ref>

Malcolm&nbsp;X said that Islam was the "true religion of black mankind" and that [[Christianity]] was "the white man's religion" that had been imposed upon African Americans by their slave-masters.<ref>Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp. 24, 137<U+2013>138.</ref> He said that the Nation of Islam followed Islam as it was practiced around the world, but the Nation's teachings varied from those of other Muslims because they were adapted to the "uniquely pitiful" condition of black people in America.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Speeches at Harvard'', p. 119.</ref> He taught that [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], the founder of the Nation, was [[Allah]] incarnate,<ref>DeCaro, pp. 166<U+2013>167.</ref> and that Elijah Muhammad was his Messenger, or [[prophet]].<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X told Lewis Lomax that "The Messenger is the Prophet of Allah" (Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p. 80). On another occasion, he said "We never refer to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad as a prophet" (Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Last Speeches'', p. 46).</ref>

While the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights movement]] fought against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], Malcolm&nbsp;X advocated the complete [[Black separatism|separation]] of African Americans from white people. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for black people in the [[Southern United States|Southern]]<ref name=Lomax149-152/> or [[Southwestern United States]]<ref>Lincoln, p. 95.</ref> as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa.<ref name=Supremacy78/> Malcolm&nbsp;X suggested the United States government owed [[Reparations for slavery|reparations]] to black people for the unpaid labor of their [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved ancestors]].<ref>Lincoln, p. 96.</ref> He also rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of [[nonviolence]] and instead advocated that black people use any necessary means of self-defense to protect themselves.<ref name="Lomax 173-174"/>

===Independent views===
[[File:Malcolm X NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|Malcolm&nbsp;X at a 1964 press conference|link=|alt=]]
After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm&nbsp;X announced his willingness to work with leaders of the civil rights movement,<ref name=Times64-03-09/> though he felt that it should change its focus to [[human rights]]. So long as the movement remained a fight for ''civil rights'', its struggle would remain a domestic issue, but by framing the struggle as a fight for ''human rights'', it would become an international issue, and the movement could bring its complaint before the United Nations. Malcolm&nbsp;X said the emerging nations of the world would add their support to the cause of African Americans.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&nbsp;X Speaks'', pp. 33<U+2013>35.</ref>

Malcolm&nbsp;X declared that he and the other members of the Organization of Afro-American Unity were determined to defend themselves from aggressors, and to secure freedom, justice and equality "by whatever means necessary", arguing that if the government was unwilling or unable to protect black people, they should protect themselves.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''By Any Means Necessary'', pp. 43, 47.</ref>

Malcolm&nbsp;X stressed the global perspective he gained from his international travels. He emphasized the "direct connection" between the domestic struggle of African Americans for equal rights with the liberation struggles of [[Third World]] nations.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&nbsp;X Speaks'', p. 90.</ref> He said that African Americans were wrong when they thought of themselves as a minority; in a global context, black people were a majority, not a minority.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&nbsp;X Speaks'', p. 117.</ref>

In his speeches at the Militant Labor Forum, which was sponsored by the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], Malcolm&nbsp;X criticized [[capitalism]].<ref name=Perry277-278/> After one such speech, when he was asked what political and economic system he wanted, he said he didn't know, but that it was no coincidence the newly liberated countries in the Third World were turning toward [[socialism]].<ref name=Cone284>Cone, p. 284.</ref> Malcolm&nbsp;X still was concerned primarily with the freedom struggle of African Americans. When a reporter asked him what he thought about socialism, Malcolm&nbsp;X asked whether it was good for black people. When the reporter told him it seemed to be, Malcolm&nbsp;X told him, "Then I'm for it."<ref name=Cone284/><ref>Perry, p. 277.</ref>

Although he no longer called for the separation of black people from white people, Malcolm&nbsp;X continued to advocate black nationalism, which he defined as self-determination for the African-American community.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&nbsp;X Speaks'', pp. 38<U+2013>41.</ref> In the last months of his life, however, Malcolm&nbsp;X began to reconsider his support of black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were white.<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&nbsp;X Speaks'', pp. 212<U+2013>213.</ref>

After his Hajj, Malcolm&nbsp;X articulated a view of white people and racism that represented a deep change from the philosophy he had supported as a minister of the Nation of Islam. In a famous letter from Mecca, he wrote that his experiences with white people during his pilgrimage convinced him to "rearrange" his thinking about race and "toss aside some of [his] previous conclusions".<ref>Malcolm&nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p. 391.</ref>

In a 1965 conversation with [[Gordon Parks]], two days before his assassination, Malcolm said:

<blockquote><p>[L]istening to leaders like Nasser, Ben Bella, and Nkrumah awakened me to the dangers of racism. I realized racism isn't just a black and white problem. It's brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another.</p>

<p>Brother, remember the time that white college girl came into the restaurant<U+2014>the one who wanted to help the [Black] Muslims and the whites get together<U+2014>and I told her there wasn't a ghost of a chance and she went away crying? Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then<U+2014>like all [Black] Muslims<U+2014>I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years.</p>

<p>That was a bad scene, brother. The sickness and madness of those days<U+2014>I'm glad to be free of them.<ref>Parks, Gordon, "Malcolm&nbsp;X: The Minutes of Our Last Meeting", Clarke, p. 122.</ref></p></blockquote>

In the late 1960s, as black activists became more radical, Malcolm&nbsp;X and his teachings were part of the foundation on which they built their movements. The [[Black Power]] movement,<ref name=Marable301>Marable, p. 301.</ref><ref>Sales, p. 187</ref> the [[Black Arts Movement]],<ref name=Marable301/><ref>{{cite book |last=Woodard |first=Komozi |title=A Nation Within a Nation: Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) & Black Power Politics |year=1999 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, N.C. |isbn=0-8078-4761-5 |page=62 }}</ref> and the widespread adoption of the slogan "[[Black is beautiful]]"<ref>Cone, p. 291.</ref> can all trace their roots to Malcolm&nbsp;X.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest in Malcolm&nbsp;X among young people fueled, in part, by his use as an icon by [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] groups such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].<ref>Marable, pp. 301<U+2013>302.</ref><ref>Sales, p. 5.</ref> Images of Malcolm&nbsp;X could be found on T-shirts and jackets.<ref>Sales, p. 3.</ref> Pictures of him were on display in hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and schools.<ref>Marable, p. 302.</ref> This wave peaked in 1992 with the release of ''[[Malcolm X (film)|Malcolm&nbsp;X]]'', a much-anticipated film adaptation of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&nbsp;X''.<ref>Sales, p. 4.</ref>
