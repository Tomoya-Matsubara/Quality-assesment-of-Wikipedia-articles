{{Macedonia intro}}

The definition of '''Macedonia''' is a major source of confusion and debate because of the overlapping use of the term to describe geographical, political and historical areas, languages and peoples. Ethnic groups inhabiting the area use different terminology for the same entity, or the same terminology for different entities, which is often confusing to other inhabitants of the region and foreigners alike.

Macedonia lies in the middle of the Balkans, and Balkan history is complex. [[#In history|Historically]], the region has presented markedly shifting borders across the [[Balkans|Balkan]] peninsula. [[#In geography|Geographically]], no single definition of its borders or the names of its subdivisions is accepted by all scholars and ethnic groups. [[#In demographics|Demographically]], it is mainly inhabited by four ethnic groups, three of which self-identify as ''Macedonians'': one [[South Slavs|Slavic]] group does so at a national level, while a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] and a [[Greeks|Greek]] one do so at a regional level. [[#In linguistics|Linguistically]], the names and origins of the languages and dialects spoken in the region are a source of controversy. [[#In politics|Politically]], the use of the name ''Macedonia'' has led to a [[Macedonia naming dispute|diplomatic dispute]] between [[Greece]] and the  [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Despite intervention from the [[United Nations]], the dispute is still pending full resolution.

==Etymology== 
There are a number of theories regarding the etymology of the name '''Macedonia'''.
===Mythological personage===
{{main|Makednos}}
According to ancient [[Greek mythology]], [[Makednos]] was the name of the first ''phylarch'' (tribal chief) or progenitor of the tribe that initially settled western, southern and central Macedonia and founded the kingdom of [[Macedon]].

===Tall men===
According to [[Herodotus]], the ''Makedno<U+00ED>'' were a tribe akin to the [[Dorians]],<ref name=herod>{{cite web| url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0004%3Aid%3Dmacedonians | title= Perseus encyclopedia | work= [[Herodotus]], [[The Histories of Herodotus|The Histories]] 1.56, 8.43 | language= Ancient Greek & English translation  | accessmonthday = August, 3| accessyear=2006 }}</ref> one of the principal ancient Greek tribes. The name probably derives from the adjective '''{{Polytonic|<U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03B4><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}''' ''makedn<U+00F3>s'', meaning "tall", which  [[Homer]] uses for a poplar tree,<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0135&layout=&loc=7.106 Odyssey VII 106]</ref> and which the grammarian [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] records as a [[Doric Greek|Doric]] word meaning "large" or  "heavenly".<ref>[[LSJ]], ''s.v.''</ref>  It has been commonly suggested that both the Macedonians (''Maked<U+00F3>nes'') and their ''Makedno<U+00ED>'' tribal ancestors were regarded as tall people.<ref>{{cite book| first= N. G. L. |last=Hammond |title= Classical Review, New Ser., Vol. 12, No. 3 | year= Dec., 1962| pages=pp. 270<U+2013>271}}</ref>

===Highland and highlanders===
According to the [[World Book|World Book Encyclopedia]], the names ''Macedonia'' and ''Macedonians'' derive from the Greek word ''Macednon'' which means ''high'' &mdash; a reference to the group's mountainous homeland. The [[Online Etymology Dictionary]] summarizes these theories as:
{{quotation|From Gk. ''Makedones'', lit. "highlanders" or "the tall ones," related to ''makednos'' "long, tall," ''makros'' "long, large".<ref name=OEDHarper>{{cite web| url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Macedonia | title= Online Etymology Dictionary | work= Macedonia | publisher= <U+00A9> November 2001 Douglas Harper  | accessmonthday = June, 20| accessyear=2007}}</ref>}} 

There would appear to be a synonymy among the names of different tribes living in the region: the most likely meanings of [[Dorians]] and [[Bryges]] also are "highlanders." All the previous names are of [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origin, the root of ''makednos'' being *m<U+0101>k-, "long, thin", which becomes "long, large" in Greek.<ref>{{cite web|work=The American Heritage Dictionary: Appendix I: Indo-European Roots|title=*m<U+0101>k-|date=2004|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE294.html|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> The syllables beyond *m<U+0101>k- are not a compound resulting from the process of production, but are an inherited extension of unknown prehistoric origin; in this case, *-dno-.<ref>{{cite book|first=J.B.|last=Hoffman|title=Etymologischen W<U+00F6>rterbuch des Griechischen|publisher=Verlag von R.

Another hypothesis suggests that ''Maked<U+00F3>nes'' may derive from an unattested ancient [[Ancient Macedonian language|Macedonian]] [[bahuvrihi]] '''*{{Polytonic|<U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03B9>-<U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03B4><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C2>}}''' ''*maki-ked<U+00F3>nes'' meaning "of the high earth" or "highlanders",<ref name= borza>{{cite book|title= Athenians, Macedonians, and the Origins of the Macedonian Royal House | first =Eugene N.| last=Borza | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1064-1173%281982%2919%3C7%3AAMATOO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J&size=LARGE| publisher=Hesperia Supplements, Vol. 19, Studies in Attic Epigraphy, History and Topography.

==In history==
{{Historical Macedonia}}
The [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] has been home to several historical political entities; the main ones are given below. The borders of each of these entities were different. The area occupied by ancient [[Macedon]] approximately coincided with [[Macedonia (Greece)|contemporary Macedonia in Greece]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Robin | last= Lane Fox| title= Alessandro Magno| location=Turin | publisher= Einaudi |year= 2004|pages= pp. 17<U+2013>21}}</ref>

===In early history===

:''Main articles: [[Macedonia (region)#History|History of the region of Macedonia]] and [[Macedon]]''

The ancient [[Macedon|kingdom of Macedon]] had more or less definite borders, although the question of whether the upland areas, like [[Lyncestis]], were part of the kingdom or independent states tended to be fought out under most of the Macedonian kings. Under [[Philip II of Macedon]], Macedonia expanded markedly, growing to include [[Chalcidice]], and northward to the [[Danube]]; Philip personally controlled much of Greece. Under [[Alexander the Great]], Macedon expanded within decades to an [[Hellenic Empire|Empire]], occupying most of the known world; one part of it then became the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedonia. After the Roman conquest following the [[Macedonian Wars]], the Roman Senate established a province of Macedonia, which had various borders in different centuries. The Roman provincial system stopped working at the fall of the Roman Empire, and when the Byzantines set up a  [[theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme]] of Macedonia, it was much further to the East, excluding even [[Chalcidice]], to say nothing of   [[Thessalonica]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] did not use Macedonia as the name of an administrative unit. 

Historical political entities which have used the name ''Macedonia'' were:

* [[Macedon]], the ancient [[monarchy|kingdom]], existed in the northernmost part of [[ancient Greece]], bordering the kingdom of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] on the west and the region of [[Thrace]] to the east. The first Macedonian state emerged in the [[8th century BC|8th]] or early 7th century BCE. Its notable ruler [[Alexander the Great]] conquered all of the known world to the east of Greece until his early death in 323 BCE. The kingdom lasted until the Romans divided it into four republics in 168 BCE.<ref>Rostovtseff, ''History of the Ancient World'', ii, 78.</ref>

*The Romans had two different entities called ''Macedonia'', at different levels:
** [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] was established as a [[Roman province]] in [[146 BC]] Its boundaries were shifted from time to time for administrative convenience, but it usually extended west to the Adriatic. [[Diocletian]] divided it into ''Macedonia prima'' and ''Macedonia salutaris''.
** [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]], was a [[Roman province#List of Roman Provinces - 300 to 476|late Roman diocese]],    organized some time around 300; authorities differ, but it certainly existed under [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. In addition to the two Macedonian provinces, it included [[Epirus vetus]], [[Epirus nova]], [[Thessaly]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], and [[History of Crete#Classical, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine Crete|Crete]] - almost all of modern Greece and the present Republic, as well as much of Albania. Both the diocese and the provinces ceased to function as administrative units when the late Roman Empire lost control of the Balkans around 600 or 700. 
* [[Macedonia (Byzantine theme)|Macedonia]], during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, was a new [[theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme]] organised by [[Empress Irene]], out of the [[Theme of Strymon]], stretching of  [[Adrianople]] and the [[Evros Prefecture|Evros]] valley east along the [[Sea of Marmara]] (ancient Macedon was the [[Theme of Thessalonica]]). [[John I Tzimisces]] replaced this with a [[ducate of Adrianople]], which included much of his Bulgarian conquests.<ref>Warren Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and society'' (1997), pp. 421, 478, ''et passim''.</ref> 
**The [[Macedonian dynasty]] of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, [[Basil I]] the Macedonian; he was born in this theme of Macedonia. His ancestry is disputed; contemporary accounts call him an [[Armenians|Armenian]] by descent.

*The Ottomans held Macedonia for five centuries; they did not keep Macedonia as an [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|administrative unit]]. The region of European Turkey lying between [[Thessaly]] and [[Serbia]] continued to be called Macedonia, however. In 1904, when most of it was placed under international administration, it contained the districts of [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]], [[Bitola|Monastir]], [[Skopje|<U+00DC>sk<U+00FC>b]], [[Kosovo|Kossovo]], [[Drama, Greece|Drama]], and [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]. In 1912<U+2013>3, this was divided among the Balkan states.<ref>{{cite book| first= Colin | last= Imber| title= The Ottoman Empire, 1300<U+2013>1650: The structure of Power| location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK | publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |year= 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Halil|last= Inalcik| title= The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300<U+2013>1600 |coauthors= Translation by Norman Itzkowitz and Colin Imber | location = London | publisher= Weidenfeld & Nicolson |year= 1973}}</ref><ref> {{cite book|first=Donald Edgar| last=Pitcher| title= An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire | location=Leiden, Netherlands | publisher= E.J.Brill | year= 1972}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Miller|first= William|title= The Ottoman empire and its successors|location = Cambridge [Eng.]|publisher = The University Press|year = 1936}} pp. 9, 447<U+2013>9</ref>
The ancient Christian sect, the [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonians]], derived their name from their founder, Bishop [[Macedonius I of Constantinople]], not from any political or geographical region of Macedonia.

===In modern history===

{{main|History of modern Macedonia}}

Since the early stages of the [[Greek Revolution]], the provisional government of Greece claimed Macedonia as part of Greek national territory, but the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)]], which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary between [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and [[Volos]].<ref> {{cite book| first=John | last= Comstock| title= History of the Greek Revolution complied from official documents of the Greek Government... and other authentic sources| location= New York |year= 1829}} p.5</ref>
When the [[Ottoman Empire]] started breaking apart, ''Macedonia'' was claimed by all members of the [[Balkan League]] ([[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]]), and by [[Romania]]. Under the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] that ended the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877<U+2013>78]] the entire region, except Thessaloniki, was included in the borders of [[Bulgaria]], but after the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 the region was returned to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The armies of the Balkan League advanced and occupied ''Macedonia'' in the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912. Because of disagreements between the allies about the partition of the region, the [[Second Balkan War]] erupted, and in its aftermath the arbitrary region of ''Macedonia'' was split into definite borders. The political entities that existed or still exist in this region, under the name ''Macedonia'' are:
*[[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] (as a region of Greece) refers to a region of three [[Peripheries of Greece|peripheries]] in [[northern Greece]], incorporated in 1913, as a result of the [[Balkan Wars]], between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Balkan League]].<ref name=poulton>{{cite book | first=Hugh | last=Poulton | year=2000 | title=Who Are the Macedonians? | publisher=Indiana University Press | id=ISBN 0-253-21359-2 | pages=85<U+2013>86 | chapter=Greece |url=http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&id=8_zeaeTOz6YC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=85&prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D%2522Who%2Bare%2Bthe%2BMacedonians%2522%2BPoulton&sig=NobKDU7Unvc2AqCZLCn0vSM5VIo }}</ref>
*[[People's Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (as a [[People's Republic]] within [[Yugoslavia]]) used to refer to the [[People's Republic of Macedonia]] established in 1946, later known as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of the constituent republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], renamed in 1963.<ref name=LOC> {{loc}} {{cite web| url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/yutoc.html | title= The Library of Congress, Country Studies | work=Yugoslavia | accessmonthday = [[July 17]] | accessyear= [[2006]] }}</ref>
*[[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (as a contemporary [[sovereign state]]) refers<sup><span style="color:#00f">N-</span></sup>{{Ref label|offensive3|3|a}} to the conventional short form name of the [[Republic of Macedonia]], which held a referendum and established its independence from [[Yugoslavia]] on [[September 8]], [[1991]].<ref name= mkconst>{{cite web| url=http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/mk00000_.html | title=International Constitutional Law | work= Macedonia <U+2014> Constitution |accessmonthday = [[July 20]] | accessyear=[[2006]] |language= English translation}}</ref>

==In geography==
[[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] (as a current geographical term) refers to a region of the [[Balkan peninsula]] in [[south-eastern Europe]], covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the [[Haliacmon]] (''Ali<U+00E1>kmonas''), [[Vardar|Vardar / Axios]] and [[Struma River|Struma / Strym<U+00F3>nas]] rivers, and the plains around [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]. 

[[Image:85mapmacedonia.jpg|thumb|340px|French geographical map of the wider [[Macedonia (region)]] as seen by Bianconi, 1885. Most other maps of that period have similar borders, differing slightly from each other; a few maps restrict the region to its southern part. [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/85mapmacedonia.jpg Enlarge].]]
In a [[Historical regions of the Balkan Peninsula|historic context]], the region presents markedly shifting borders across the Balkan peninsula, since borders were loosely defined according to the administrative requirements of its conquerors. Under the Ottoman conquest, which lasted five centuries, ''Macedonia'' was not an administrative division of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name= mccarthy1> [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|McCarthy, J.]] (2001) ''The Ottoman Peoples and the End of Empire'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-340-70657-0</ref> H.R. Wilkinson, the geographer, suggests that the region "defies definition", but that many mappers agree "on its general location".<ref name= wilkinson>{{cite book | last = Wilkinson| first =H.

Many [[ethnographic]] maps were produced in this period of controversy; these differ primarily in the areas given to each nationality within Macedonia. This was in part a result of the choice of definition: an inhabitant of Macedonia might well have different nationalities depending on whether the basis of classification was [[religious denomination|denomination]], [[kinship and descent|descent]], [[language]], [[self-identification]] or personal choice. In addition, the Ottoman census, taken on the basis of [[religion]], was misquoted by all sides; descent, or "[[race]]", was largely conjectural; inhabitants of Macedonia might speak a different language at the market and at home, and the same Slavic dialect might be called Serbian "with Bulgarian influences", Macedonian, or West-Bulgarian.

These maps would also differ somewhat in the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the [[Aegean Sea]] and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered on Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman [[Rumelia]]) was debatable.<ref name= wilkinson /> 

The Greek ethnographer Nicolaides, the Austrian Meinhard, and the Bulgarian K<U+01CE>n<U+010D>ev accepted the [[<U+0160>ar Mountain]]s and the [[Skopska Crna Gora|Crna hills]]; as had scholars before 1878.<ref name= wilkinson /> The Serb Gop<U+010D>evi<U+010D> preferred a line much further south, assigning the entire region from [[Skopje]] to [[Strumica]] to "Old Serbia"; and some later Greek geographers have agreed to a more restricted Macedonia.<ref name= wilkinson /> In addition, maps might vary in smaller details: as to whether this town or that was Macedonian. One Italian map included [[Prizren]], where Nicolaides and Meinhard had drawn the boundary just south of it. On the south and west, [[Grevena]], [[Kor<U+00E7><U+00EB>]], and [[Konitsa]] varied from map to map; on the east, the usual line is the lower [[Mesta River|Mesta / Nestos]] river and then north or northwest, but one German geographer takes the line so far west as to exclude [[Bansko]] and [[Gotse Delchev (town)|Nevrokop / Gotse Delchev]].<ref name = wilkinson />  

===Subregions===
{{Geographical Macedonia}}
The [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] is commonly divided into three major and two minor sub-regions.<ref name=danforth>Danforth, L. M. (1997) ''The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World'', Princeton University Press, ISBN 0-691-04356-6, p.44</ref> The name ''Macedonia'' appears under certain contexts on the major regions, while the smaller ones are traditionally referred to by other local [[toponyms]]:

====Major====
The region of Macedonia is commonly split geographically into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the Macedonian Question. The terms are used in non-partisan scholarly works, although they are also used in [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] literature of an [[irredentist]] nature:<ref name= mymk>{{cite web |url=http://www.mymacedonia.net/aegean/aegean.htm | title=myMacedonia.net | accessmonthday = [[July 22]] | accessyear=[[2006]]}}</ref>

* ''[[Aegean Macedonia]]''<sup><span style="color:#00f">N-</span></sup>{{Ref label|offensive1|1|a}} (or [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]) is a term that refers to an area in the south of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area are, overall, those of ancient [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]]. It covers an area of 34,200 km<U+00B2><ref name= brit-gr>{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049698 |title= Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica | year= 2006 | work=Macedonia |accessmonthday = [[July 21]] |accessyear=[[2006]]}}</ref> (for discussion of the reported irredentist origin of this term, see [[Aegean Macedonia]]).
* ''[[Pirin Macedonia]]''<sup><span style="color:#00f">N-</span></sup>{{ref label|Pirin|2|a}} (or [[Bulgarian Macedonia]]) is an area in the east of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area approximately coincide with those of [[Blagoevgrad Province]] in [[Bulgaria]].<ref name=danforth /> It covers an area of 6,449 km<U+00B2>.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bl.government.bg/bl/index.html| title= Official site: District of Blagoevgrad | accessmonthday = [[July 21]] | accessyear= [[2006]]}}</ref>
* ''[[Vardar Macedonia]]'' (formerly [[Yugoslav Macedonia]]) is an area in the north of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area are those of the [[Republic of Macedonia]].<ref name= danforth /> It covers an area of 25,333 km<U+00B2>.<ref name= cia-mk>{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mk.html|title= CIA <U+2014> The World Factbook|work= Macedonia|accessmonthday = [[July 18]]|accessyear=[[2006]]}}</ref>

====Minor====
In addition to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in [[Albania]] and [[Serbia]] respectively. These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia. They are referred to by [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonians]] as follows,<ref name= mymk /> but typically aren't referred to by non-partisan scholars.

[[Mala Prespa and Golo Bardo]] is a small area in the west of the Macedonia region in [[Albania]], mainly around the [[Lake Ohrid]]. It includes parts of the [[Kor<U+00E7><U+00EB>]], [[Pogradec]] and [[Devoll]] districts. These districts in whole occupy about 3,000 km<U+00B2>, but the area concerned is significantly smaller.

[[Gora (region)|Gora]] and [[Prohor Pchinski]] are minor parts in the north of the Macedonia region in [[Serbia]]. They roughly correspond to the Serbian municipality of [[Draga<U+0161> (town)|Draga<U+0161>]] (435 km<U+00B2>) and the monastery of [[Prohor P<U+010D>injski]].

==In demographics==

{{main|Demographic history of Macedonia}}

The region, as defined above, has a total population of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The [[ethnic Macedonian]] population of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] self-identify as ''Macedonian'' on a national level, while the [[Greek Macedonians]] self-identify as both ''Macedonian'' on a regional, and ''Greek'' on a national level. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the [[#Terminology by group|terminology by group]] section.

As language is one of the elements tied in with [[national identity]], the same disputes that are voiced over demographics are also found in linguistics. There are two main disputes about the use of the word Macedonian to describe a linguistic phenomenon, be it a [[language]] or a [[dialect]]:

The (south Slavic) [[Macedonian language]]<sup><span style="color:#00f">N-</span></sup>{{Ref label|offensive3|3|f}}  is unrelated to the [[Ancient Macedonian language]]. It is currently the subject of two major disputes. The first is over the name (alternative ways of referring to this language can be found in the [[#Terminology by group|terminology by group]] section and in the article [[Macedonian language naming dispute]]). The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups,<ref name=lunt1986>Lunt, H. (1986) "On Macedonian Nationality" in ''[[Slavic Review]]'', Vol. 45, No. 4. pp. 729<U+2013>734</ref> and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.

==In politics==
{{Seealso|Macedonia naming dispute}}
The controversies in geographic, linguistic and demographic terms, are also manifested in international politics. Among the autonomous countries that were formed as a result of the break up of [[Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s, was the (until then) subnational entity of [[SFRJ]], by the official name of [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]], the others being [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]]. The peaceful break-away of that nation resulted in a necessary change for its name, to signify disassociation from federal Yugoslavia.

{{clear}}
{{quotation|Extreme Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny that they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[ancient Macedonians]]. The more moderate [ethnic] Macedonian position, generally adopted by better educated Macedonians and publicly endorsed by [[Kiro Gligorov]], the first president of the newly independent Republic of Macedonia, is that modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. 
<br><br>
In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. While acknowledging the similarities between Macedonian and other [[South Slavic languages]], they point to the distinctions that set it apart as a separate language. They also emphasize that although standard literary Macedonian was only formally created and recognized in 1944, the Macedonian language has a history of over a thousand years dating back to the [[Old Church Slavonic]] used by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Sts. Cyril and Methodius]] in the ninth century. 
<br><br>
Although all Macedonians agree that Macedonian minorities exist in Bulgaria and Greece and that these minorities have been subjected to harsh policies of forced assimilation, there are two different positions with regard to what their future should be. The goal of more extreme Macedonian nationalists is to create a "[[United Macedonia|free, united, and independent Macedonia]]" by "liberating" the parts of Macedonia "temporarily occupied" by Bulgaria and Greece. More moderate Macedonian nationalists recognize the inviolability of the Bulgarian and Greek borders and explicitly renounce any territorial claims against the two countries. They do, however, demand that Bulgaria and Greece recognize the existence of Macedonian minorities in their countries and grant them the basic human rights they deserve.<ref name=Danforth>{{cite book| title=How can a woman give birth to one Greek and one Macedonian? | url= http://www.gate.net/~mango/How_can_a_woman_give_birth.htm | work=

===Greek nationalism===
Professor Danforth describes the Greek nationalist position on Macedonia as follows: 

{{quotation|
According to the Greek nationalist position on the Macedonian Question, because Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians were Greeks, and because ancient and modern Greece are bound in an unbroken line of racial and cultural continuity, it is only Greeks who have the right to identify themselves as Macedonians, not the Slavs of southern Yugoslavia, who settled in Macedonia in the sixth century AD and who called themselves "Bulgarians" until 1944. Greeks, therefore, generally refer to Macedonians as "Skopians", (from Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia) a practice comparable to calling Greeks "Athenians." The negation of Macedonian identity in Greek nationalist ideology focuses on three main points: the existence of a Macedonian nation, a Macedonian language, and a Macedonian minority in Greece. From the Greek nationalist perspective there cannot be a Macedonian nation since there has never been an independent Macedonian state: the Macedonian nation is an "artificial creation", an "invention", of Tito, who "baptized" a "mosaic of nationalities" with the Greek name "Macedonians". 
<br><br>
Similarly Greek nationalists claim that because the language spoken by the ancient Macedonians was Greek, the Slavic language spoken by the "Skopians" cannot be called "the Macedonian language." Greek sources generally refer to it as "the linguistic idiom of Skopje" and describe it as a corrupt and impoverished dialect of Bulgarian. Finally, the Greek government denies the existence of a Macedonian minority in northern Greece, claiming that there exists only a small group of "Slavophone Hellenes" or "bilingual Greeks", who speak Greek and "a local Slavic dialect" but have a "Greek national consciousness".
<br><br>
From the Greek nationalist perspective, then, the use of the name "Macedonian" by the "Slavs of Skopje" constitutes a "felony", an "act of plagiarism" against the Greek people. By calling themselves "Macedonians" the Slavs are "stealing" a Greek name; they are "embezzling" Greek cultural heritage; they are "falsifying" Greek history. As Evangelos Kofos, a historian employed by the Greek Foreign Ministry told a foreign reporter, "It is as if a robber came into my house and stole my most precious jewels - my history, my culture, my identity". Greek fears that use of the name "Macedonia" by Slavs will inevitably lead to the assertion of irredentist claims to territory in Greek Macedonia are heightened by fairly recent historical events. During World War II Bulgaria occupied portions of northern Greece, while one of the specific goals of the founders of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 was "the unification of the entire Macedonian nation", to be achieved by "the liberation of the other two segments" of Macedonia.<ref name=Danforth />

==Terminology by group==

All these controversies have led ethnic groups in Macedonia to use terms in conflicting ways. Despite the fact that these terms may not always be used in a [[pejorative]] way, they may be perceived as such by the receiving ethnic group. Both [[Greeks]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonians]] generally use all terms deriving from ''Macedonia'' to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general. 

A proportion of [[Bulgarians]] and ethnic Macedonians have extremist views about their inter-relatedness. On the one hand, extremist ethnic Macedonians<ref name=EthMacNat> {{cite web| url= http://macedonia.cjb.net/ | title= Macedonian Info | accessmonthday = [[July 19]] | accessyear=[[2006]]}}</ref>
seek to deny the possibility of any national, linguistic and historical relatedness to the Bulgarians. On the other hand, extremist Bulgarians seek to downplay this distinctiveness,<ref name=BulgNat1> {{cite web| url=http://www.macedoniainfo.com/ | title= Macedonian Scientific Institute | accessmonthday = [[July 19]] | accessyear= [[2006]]}}</ref>
and are often supported by extremist Greeks.<ref name= LAOS>{{el icon}} {{cite web| url= http://www.e-grammes.gr/article.php?id=59 | title= <U+0395><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AD><U+03C2> <U+0393><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03BC><U+03BC><U+03AD><U+03C2> ("Hellenic Lines") | accessmonthday = [[July 17]] | accessyear= [[2006]]}}</ref>
Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians seek to deny the self-identification of the [[Minorities in Greece#Slavic-speaking|Slavic speaking minority]] in northern Greece,<ref name = BulgNat2> {{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/bulgarmak/ | title = Bulgarian Human Rights in Macedonia | accessmonthday = [[July 19]] | accessyear = [[2006]]}}</ref>
which mostly self-identifies as Greek. Extremists on all sides have been known to fabricate and reproduce falsified information, along with denying genuine information and propagating unscientific and [[Sub-Saharan DNA admixture in Europe#The Arnaiz-Villena controversy|pseudoscientific theories]].<ref name= pseudo>{{cite web  | last = Arnaiz-Villena  | first = A.  | coauthors =  Dimitroski K., Pacho A.

Certain terms are in use by these groups as outlined below. Any denial of self-identification by any side, or any attribution of Macedonia related terms by third parties to the other side, can be seen as highly offensive. General usage of these terms follows:

It is a more negatively charged synonym of "Macedonian nationalist".

<span style="color:#00f;font-variant:small-caps">n-[1]</span> {{note_label |offensive1|1|a}}{{note_label|offensive1|1|b}}{{note_label|offensive1|1|c}} During the [[Greek Civil War]], in 1947, the [[Minister for the Press and the Media (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Press and Information]] published a book, ''I Enandion tis Ellados Epivoulis'' ("Designs on Greece"), namely of documents and speeches on the ongoing Macedonian issue, many translations from Yugolsav officials. It reports [[Josip Broz Tito]] using the term "Aegean Macedonia" on the [[October 11]], [[1945]] in the build up to the Greek Civil War; the original document is archived in <U+2018>GFM A/24581/G2/1945<U+2019>. For Athens, the <U+201C>new term, Aegean Macedonia<U+201D>, (also ''<U+201C>Pirin Macedonia<U+201D>''), was introduced by Yugoslavs. Contextually, this observation indicates this was part of the Yugoslav offensive against Greece, laying claim to Greek Macedonia, but Athens does not take issue with the term itself. The 1945 date concurs with Bulgarian sources. Further information on this can be found in the article [[Aegean Macedonia]].

However, many people in the country also think of the name as a purely geographical term, which it has historically been. Its use is, thus, controversial.

<span style="color:#00f;font-variant:small-caps">n-[3]</span> {{note_label|offensive3|3|a}}{{note_label|offensive3|3|b}}{{note_label|offensive3|3|c}}{{note_label|offensive3|3| d}}{{note_label|offensive3|3|e}}{{note_label|offensive3|3|f}}{{note_label|offensive3|3|g}} The constitutional name of the country "''Republic of Macedonia''" and the short name "''Macedonia''" when referring to the country, can be considered offensive by most [[Greeks]], especially inhabitants of the Greek province of Macedonia. The official reasons for this, as described by the [[Foreign relations of Greece|Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], are:

{{quotation|
"The choice of the name Macedonia by FYROM directly raises the issue of usurpation of the [[Macedon|cultural]] [[Hellenistic civilization|heritage]] of a [[Greece|neighbouring country]]. The name constitutes the basis for staking an exclusive rights claim over the [[Macedonia (region)|entire geographical area of Macedonia]]. More specifically, to call only the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Slavo-Macedonians]] Macedonians monopolizes the name for the Slavo-Macedonians and creates semiological confusion, whilst violating the human rights and the right to [[self-determination]] of [[Macedonians (Greek)|Greek Macedonians]]. The use of the name by [[FYROM]] alone may also create problems in the trade area, and subsequently become a potential springboard for distorting reality, and a basis for activities far removed from the standards set by the [[European Union]] and more specifically the clause on good neighbourly relations. The best example of this is to be seen in the content of school textbooks in the [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]]."<ref name=GrFA> {{cite web | url= http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Balkans/Bilateral+Relations/FYROM/FYROM+-+THE+NAME+ISSUE.htm|title=Hellenic Republic, Ministry of Foreign Affairs | accessmonthday = [[July 17]] | accessyear=[[2006]] | work=Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) <U+2014> The Name Issue | publisher= | pages= | language=English }}</ref>
}}

<span style="color:#00f;font-variant:small-caps">n-[4]</span>{{note|offensive2}} The abbreviated term "''FYROM''" can be considered offensive when used to refer to the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. The spellout of the term, the "''former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia''", is not necessarily considered offensive, but some [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonians]] may still find it offensive due to their right of [[self-identification]] being ignored. The term can also be offensive for Greeks under certain contexts, since it contains the word ''Macedonia''.

<span style="color:#00f;font-variant:small-caps">n-[5]</span> {{note_label|offensive4|5|a}}{{note_label|offensive4|5|b}}{{note_label|offensive4|5|c}}{{note_label|offensive4|5|d}} Although acceptable in the past, current use of the name "''Slavomacedonian''" in reference to both the ethnic group and the language can be considered [[pejorative]] and offensive by [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonians]] living in Greece. The [[Greek Helsinki Monitor]] reports:

{{quotation|
"<U+2026>the term Slavomacedonian was introduced and was accepted by the community itself, which at the time had a much more widespread non-Greek Macedonian ethnic consciousness. Unfortunately, according to members of the community, this term was later used by the Greek authorities in a pejorative, discriminatory way; hence the reluctance if not hostility of modern-day Macedonians of Greece (i.e. people with a Macedonian national identity) to accept it."<ref name= slavomacedonian />
