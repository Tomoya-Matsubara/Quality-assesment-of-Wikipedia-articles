'''Queensland National Bank''' is a heritage-listed former [[bank]] at 39 Melbourne Street, [[South Brisbane, Queensland|South Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was designed by [[Addison & MacDonald]] and built in 1929 by A Stonadge & Son. It is also known as Ng House.  It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 26 May 2000.<ref name=qhr>{{cite QHR|16870|Queensland National Bank (former), South Brisbane Branch|602134|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
The building was originally constructed as the South Brisbane branch of the Queensland National Bank.  Constructed by local builders, A Stonadge and Son, to a design by Addison and McDonald, the new premises at 39 Melbourne Street was opened for business on 31 July 1929.<ref name=qhr/>

The land on which the building was to be constructed was one of thirty allotments sold in the [[Brisbane]] land boom of 1854.  The Deed of Grant for the land was acquired on 11 May 1854 by [[William John Loudon]].  As it was situated within the town limits drawn up in 1846, the allotment was affected by each of the major urban developments on the South Brisbane peninsula such as the development of the public transport systems, the declaration of the first-class urban areas and the widening of the major arterial roads (Melbourne and Grey Streets).  It was also one of the many areas inundated by the floods of the 1890s. Subdivision of the original blocks was underway by 1870 and allotment 1 section 15, of which this site is a part, was acquired by Patrick Maunsell on 3 March 1871.  It was sold by Maunsell's widow in 1897 and passed through several hands until the site was acquired by Janet Mearns Pike and Richard Pike in 1912.<ref name=qhr/>

The economic development of South Brisbane was reflected in the various properties which occupied the site prior to the construction of the bank in the late 1920s.  These included boarding establishments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries which served the needs of workers and visitors to the city until 1917.  The more diversified nature of commerce in the area from that time is reflected in the tenancy of the Pikes Building which was constructed by 1917.  The State Department of Works leased the site in 1917 and various state offices including the Chief Protector of Aboriginals and the Department of Water Supply were situated there.  In 1925, the whole of the site was resumed by the [[City of South Brisbane|South Brisbane City Council]].  It passed to the [[Brisbane Municipal Council]] and, in 1927, part of the land was dedicated for road purposes.  Resubdivision of the land followed and sub 3 of allotment 1 of section 15 was sold to the [[Queensland National Bank]] in September 1927. The A & B Journal of Queensland in July 1927 describes the '...corner purchased by the Queensland National Bank as one of the gem positions of the whole business thoroughfare ...'<ref name=qhr/>

[[Brisbane City Council]] approved a new building for the Queensland National Bank Ltd, [[Queen Street, Brisbane]] in October 1928.  Architects advertised for tenders and in the A & B Journal of Queensland, November 19, 1928, advertised that A Stonadge and Son's tender had been successful.  The building cost just over &pound;339.  From 22 May 1928, the bank had occupied temporary premises in the adjacent Trocadero Building in Melbourne Street.<ref name=qhr/>

Situated on the corner of one of the three distinct shopping centres which developed in South Brisbane in the early twentieth century, Baynard's Corner Melbourne Street, the Queensland National Bank was ideally placed to capitalise on the industrial and commercial development on the South Brisbane Peninsula.  The construction of the South Brisbane Branch of the Queensland National Bank may have reflected the determined drive by the Bank to increase its market share in Queensland and to acquire the custom of the importers and merchants of the cities.<ref name=qhr/>

The business potential of the Queensland National Bank many not have benefited to the same extent as that of its rival from the major developments in transport in the area, however, its drive to acquire the business of merchants and importers may well have been served by the up-grading of transport facilities in the area.  These included the relocation of the in-bound lane of the tramway from [[Stanley Street, Brisbane|Stanley Street]] to Grey Street in 1918.  From that time, all in-bound trams from [[West End, Queensland|West End]], [[Dutton Park, Queensland|Dutton Park]], [[Ipswich Road, Brisbane|Ipswich Road]], [[Coorparoo, Queensland|Coorparoo]], [[Greenslopes, Queensland|Greenslopes]] and [[Balmoral, Queensland|Balmoral]] stopped at the Bayards corner intersection where the bank was situated.  When the [[South Brisbane railway station|Melbourne Street railway station]] became the terminus for both the interstate line through [[Kyogle]] as well as the southside commuter services, access to potential clients would have been increased considerably.<ref name=qhr/>

The South Brisbane branch was one of a number of suburban branches established in the 1920s.  Its move into the area reflects the bank's optimism and confidence in the potential of the locale and its desire to capture a large slice of Queensland's financial markets - a confidence and desire which it apparently shared with its counterpart and rival, the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] whose banking chambers adjoined.  The building in both its aspect and architecture reflects both the optimism for the future and the competitive drive which several of the banks were exhibiting at this time.<ref name=qhr/>

In July 1949, title passed from the Queensland National Bank Ltd to the [[National Australia Bank|National Bank of Australasia]],  who held the property until 1978, when the branch was closed.  Title to the land changed several times until the property was purchased  by the current owners in 1983.<ref name=qhr/>

The former Queensland National Bank, South Brisbane Branch was identified as a Place of Contributory Significance in Brisbane City Council's 1993 Heritage Study of the South Brisbane, West End and Mater Hill areas.  The Heritage Study was prepared as part of the South Brisbane Development Control Plan.<ref name=qhr/>
