'''Pocket universes''' are a type of very small [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] sometimes found in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. They are sometimes "attached" to a larger parent universe, making them literally pockets of space, but this is not a necessary feature and the name generally just refers to their small size.
