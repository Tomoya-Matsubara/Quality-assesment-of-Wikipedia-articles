'''Rowfant''' was a railway station on the [[Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line]] in the parish of [[Worth, West Sussex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56946 |title=Parishes - Worth &#124; A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7 (pp. 192-200) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=1935-06-18 |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref> The line closed in 1967, a casualty of the [[Beeching Axe]]. The route of the railway line cut a path through the estate of [[Curtis Miranda Lampson]], a wealthy American fur trader and vice-chairman of the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]], who agreed to sell his land cheaply to the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LBSCR) on condition that a station be provided, together with the right to stop trains on request. Apart from Lampson's Rowfant House the only other nearby residence was Worth Hall owned by John Nix, an LBSCR director. At Lampson's request a shelter was provided for his coachmen.<ref name="subbrit">{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/r/rowfant/index.shtml |title=Rowfant railway station on Subterranea Britannica |publisher=Subbrit.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://early-lbscr.co.uk/rowfant/rowfant.htm#_Rowfant_-_Historical_Notes |title=Rowfant Grange |publisher=Early-lbscr.co.uk |date=2007-04-13 |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref>

==Train services==
Rowfant, initially the only intermediate station between [[Three Bridges railway station|Three Bridges]] and [[East Grinstead railway station|East Grinstead]], saw an initial service of six passenger trains per day, with two on Sundays. By 1859 this had increased to nine services with one early morning goods train, and four Sunday services. The opening of another intermediate station in 1860, [[Grange Road railway station|Grange Road]], saw passenger trains cut to six on weekdays. An additional siding and [[Railroad switch|crossover]] were provided in 1878, the siding serving a nearby [[brickworks]]. The station was further enlarged in 1900-1901 when it became a crossing station with a new 500&nbsp;ft. Up platform and footbridge. In 1906 the introduction of new motor carriages led to an increase in weekday services.<ref name="gould">{{cite book | last = Gould | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells | publisher = The Oakwood Press | year = 1983 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-85361-299-5 }}</ref>

==Closure==
Nevertheless, Rowfant saw very little passenger traffic and jointly held with [[Kingscote railway station|Kingscote]] the record for the least revenue for passenger journeys on the LBSCR.<ref name="subbrit"/> Although it saw a brief revival in terms of freight traffic when [[Gatwick Airport]] opened in the late 1950s and jet fuel was stored in the goods yard, its days were numbered and it closed with the rest of the line in January 1967 under the programme of closures put forward by local resident and [[British Rail]] Chairman, [[Richard Beeching]].

==The site today==
Today the majority of the station survives, with the station site and goods yard occupied by a company producing road-building materials, [[Colas ltd|Colas Limited]]. The station building, stationmaster's house and part of the Down platform survive. The Worth Way, a public footpath following the line of the railway, runs alongside the north face of the station building which is currently disused with its windows and doorways bricked up.<ref name="subbrit"/>
