'''Halkett boat''' refers to two types of lightweight [[inflatable boat]] designed by {{nowrap|Lt Peter Halkett}} (1820<U+2013>1885) during the 1840s. Halkett had long been interested in the difficulties of travelling in the [[Canadian Arctic]], and the problems involved in designing boats light enough to be carried over arduous terrain, but robust enough to be used in extreme weather conditions.

Halkett's first design was a collapsible and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This was followed by a two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a [[knapsack]], and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.

Although widely praised by Canadian explorers, the market for Halkett's designs was limited, and he was unable to persuade the [[Royal Navy]] that they would serve any useful purpose in general naval service. Efforts to market them as platforms for fishing and duck shooting failed, and they were commercially unsuccessful. Only a single Halkett boat, that of [[Orcadian]] explorer [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]], survives today.

Peter Halkett was in the 1840s a [[Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name="NMM">{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/explore/collections/by-type/archive-and-library/item-of-the-month/previous/boat-cloak-or-cloak-boat|title=Boat-cloak or cloak-boat|publisher=National Maritime Museum|accessdate=15 May 2010|location=Greenwich}}</ref> The son of John Halkett, a director of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] who for many years had lived in Canada before returning to England, Peter Halkett had long held an interest in the exploration of the [[Canadian Arctic]].

Franklin's three year exploration of the northern coast of Canada in search of the [[Northwest Passage]] had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20&nbsp;members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=Fergus|title=Barrow's Boys|year=2001|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=1862075026|pages=139<U+2013>140}}</ref> The party had become stranded on the wrong side of the [[Coppermine River]] after their boats had been destroyed in a storm; [[John Richardson (naturalist)|John Richardson]] had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe [[hypothermia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=Fergus|title=Barrow's Boys|year=2001|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=1862075026|pages=141<U+2013>142}}</ref> A single member of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=Fergus|title=Barrow's Boys|year=2001|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=1862075026|page=143}}</ref>

Halkett was an amateur inventor, and during spare time whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving the problem of how to design a boat that would be small and light enough to easily transport on foot through wilderness, but robust enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water.<ref name="Pain42" /> His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.<ref name="Pain42" />

==Boat-cloak==

Halkett designed a waterproof [[cloak]] made from an early form of [[Mackintosh|Macintosh cloth]], cotton impregnated with [[India rubber]] dissolved in [[naphtha]]. The lining of the cloak contained an airtight and watertight inflatable ovoid, split into four separate airtight compartments in case of puncture,<ref name="Exhibition">{{cite book|title=Official Descriptive and Illustrated Catalogue of the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, 1851|volume=2|year=1851|publisher=Spicer Brothers|location=London|page=783}}</ref> and a pocket containing a [[paddle]] blade and a small [[bellows]].<ref name="Pain42" /> The wearer of the cloak would carry a walking stick, which would double as the shaft of the paddle, and a large umbrella to serve as a sail.<ref name="Pain42" /> The cloak weighed around {{convert|7+1/2|lb}} in total,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=NENZC18511220.2.5|title=A boat, a cloak, an umbrella and a walking stick|date=1851-12-20|work=Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle|accessdate=15&nbsp;May 2010}}</ref> and took three to four minutes to inflate; once inflated, it could support the weight of six to eight persons.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1850-09|title=Monthly Record of Current Events|journal=[[Harper's Magazine]]|volume=1|issue=4|page=567}}</ref>

In early 1844, Halkett successfully tested a prototype boat-cloak on the [[River Thames]], paddling it {{convert|15|km}} without taking on any water,<ref name="Pain42" /> despite, in his words, being "met by<U+2014>passed by<U+2014>and almost run down by<U+2014>various Metropolitan Steamers plying to and fro in their several vocations, and causing no little commotion in the troubled waters of the River".<ref name="Beaver47">{{cite journal|title=Footnotes to the Franklin Search|journal=The Beaver|publisher=Hudson's Bay Company|volume=34|issue=4|page=47|url=http://www.historysociety.ca/media/pdf/34-4-Spr-955-p46-51.pdf}}</ref> Buoyed by this success, he took the prototype boat-cloak with him while on naval service, using it whenever the opportunity arose to test it under various sea conditions.<ref name="Pain43">{{cite journal|last=Pain|first=Stephanie|date=2009-05-30|title=Don't forget your umbrella|journal=New Scientist|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|location=London|volume=202|issue=2710|page=43|issn=0262 4079|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227101.500-explorers-dont-forget-your-inflatable-cloak.html}}</ref> In November 1844, Halkett attempted to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions, in the rough seas of the [[Bay of Biscay]], but the weather was unnaturally calm. He was forced to take down his umbrella, and paddle, recalling later that "the winds that day were too civil by half, and the sleepless bay almost quite dormant".<ref name="Pain43" />{{#tag:ref|Despite Halkett's testing of the boat-cloak at sea, it was never intended to be used for anything other than the exploration of inland waterways and inlets.<ref name="Pain43" />|group=note}} The boat was positively received by explorers; John Richardson (who had almost died during the Coppermine expedition) wrote that "Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely".<ref name="Pain43" />

Spurred on by the successful testing of the boat-cloak, Halkett designed a larger version that folded into a knapsack. When inflated, it could carry two men, operating a paddle on each side, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket to allow the users to camp on wet ground.<ref name="Pain43" /> The [[Admiralty]] was sceptical about potential uses for Halkett's designs; on 8&nbsp;May 1845 [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Lord Herbert]], [[First Secretary to the Admiralty]] wrote to Halkett that "My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service".<ref name="Beaver47" />

Although the Admiralty saw no use to which Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was extremely well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one to take on the ill-fated [[Franklin's lost expedition|1845 expedition]] in which the entire expedition party of 129&nbsp;men and two ships vanished.<ref name="Pain43" /> Franklin saw the boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave this boat to [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]], Governor-in-Chief of [[Rupert's Land]], for use in his travels in the region.<ref name="Beaver48">{{cite journal|title=Footnotes to the Franklin Search|journal=The Beaver|publisher=Hudson's Bay Company|volume=34|issue=4|page=48|url=http://www.historysociety.ca/media/pdf/34-4-Spr-955-p46-51.pdf}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A replacement boat was ordered from Halkett, who delivered it in time for Franklin to take possession before setting out on his last expedition.<ref name="Beaver48" />|group=note}}

[[Orkney|Orkneyman]] [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]], known by the [[Inuit]] as {{lang|iu|<U+140A><U+14A1><U+14D8><U+1472>}} ({{Lang|iu|Aglooka}}, "He who takes long strides") was a Hudson's Bay Company [[surgeon]] who became a surveyor of the Canadian Arctic. Unlike most Europeans of the period, Rae believed that the local inhabitants knew best how to cope with extreme weather conditions. He travelled Inuit-style, using [[sledge]]s and [[snowshoe]]s and sleeping in snow [[igloo]]s.<ref name="Pain43" /> Rae took a Halkett boat on his first expedition in 1846, reporting that it was "most useful in crossing and recrossing the river at [[Repulse Bay]]", and that "although in constant use for upwards of six weeks on a rocky coast it never required the slightest repair" and "ought to form part of the equipment of every expedition".<ref name="Pain43" />

Keen to find out what had become of the ships and men of Franklin's expedition, in 1848 the Royal Navy sent an expedition led by John Richardson and John Rae to search for the party, equipped with a Halkett boat provided by the government.<ref name="Pain43" /> The party was unable to locate Franklin, but found the Halkett boat invaluable, on one occasion using the single boat to ferry their entire party across a river in 14 trips.<ref name="Pain43" /> Rae noted that although the rubber of the boat became stiff from the cold, there was no difficulty in warming it to soften the material when necessary.<ref name="Beaver48" />

[[File:Halkett boat in use.jpg|thumb|left|Two-man Halkett boat in use|alt=Two men rowing a low-lying boat]]In 1851 French explorer [[Joseph Ren<U+00E9> Bellot]] mounted another expedition to find Franklin, sponsored by Franklin's wife. Bellot took a Halkett boat-cloak on the journey, noting in his journal that it was "of immense value in a country where the want of wood renders it impossible to form any sort of raft".<ref name="Pain43" /> Bellot's expedition was unable to locate Franklin, and it was not until 1853 that an expedition led by Rae (equipped with "two beautiful Halkett boats") located a group of Inuit who recounted seeing men dragging a boat four years earlier, and later finding their bodies.<ref name="Pain43" />

==Commercial failure==
Despite being promoted as ideal for lake-fishing and duck-shooting,<ref name="Exhibition" /> and being exhibited in the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851,<ref name="NMM" /><ref name="Exhibition" /> Halkett's boat designs were not commercially successful and never entered general use outside the specialised field of Canadian exploration.<ref name="NMM" /><ref name="Pain43" /> Later promoted to [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]], Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the manufacture of his boat designs was abandoned. John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of [[Kirkwall]], and it lay forgotten on the rafters of a Kirkwall woodyard.<ref name="Beaver46">{{cite journal|title=Footnotes to the Franklin Search|journal=The Beaver|publisher=Hudson's Bay Company|volume=34|issue=4|page=46|url=http://www.historysociety.ca/media/pdf/34-4-Spr-955-p46-51.pdf}}</ref> It was identified and recovered many years later, and is now displayed in the [[Stromness Museum]]. It is believed to be the last surviving Halkett boat.<ref name="Beaver46" />
