'''500 East'''<ref name="Testing">{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/56795317-90/east-goeres-stops-trains.html.csp|title=Sugar House streetcar testing begins next week|last=Davidson|first=Lee|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=28 Aug 2013|accessdate=5 Apr 2014}}</ref> is a [[Tram|streetcar]] stop in [[South Salt Lake, Utah|South Salt Lake]], [[Utah]], in the [[United States]], served by [[Utah Transit Authority]]'s (UTA) [[S Line (UTA)|S Line]] (previously known as the Sugar House Streetcar).  The S Line provides service from the [[Sugar House, Salt Lake City|Sugar House]] neighborhood of [[Salt Lake City]] to the city of South Salt Lake (where it connects with UTA's [[TRAX (light rail)|TRAX light rail system]]).

==Description==
The 500 East stop is located at 2234 South 500 East, just west of South 500 East. The single set of tracks diverges to form a [[Passing loop|passing track]] at this stop, thus permitting (as planned in its schedule<ref name="schedule"/>) two cars to stop at the stop at the same time. (The two tracks continue east across 500 East before merging back to a single set.) The two side platforms are located on the far north and south sides of the tracks. There is very limited street-side parking possible nearby. The stop began service on 8 December 2013 and is operated by Utah Transit Authority. 

All of UTA's TRAX and ''[[FrontRunner]]'' trains and stations, streetcars and streetcar stops, and all fixed route buses are compliant with [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=RidingUTA-Accessibility-FixedRouteAccessibility|title=Fixed Route Accessibility|website=rideuta.com|publisher=[[Utah Transit Authority]]|accessdate=13 Mar 2013}}</ref> Signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the trains clearly indicate accessibility options. In accordance with the [[List of smoking bans in the United States#Utah|Utah Clean Air Act]] and UTA ordinance, "smoking is prohibited on UTA vehicles as well as UTA bus stops, TRAX stations, and ''FrontRunner'' stations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=RidingUTA-RiderRules|title=Rider Rules|website=rideuta.com|publisher=[[Utah Transit Authority]]|accessdate=12 Mar 2013}}</ref>
