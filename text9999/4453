'''AMBO pipeline''' is a planned oil pipeline from the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Black Sea]] port of [[Burgas]] via the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the [[Albania]]n [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] port of [[Vlore]]. 

==History==
The pipeline was proposed already in 1993. On 27 December 2004, prime-ministers of Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria signed the latest political declaration, followed by the memorandum of understanding between representatives of Albania, the Republic of Macedonia  and Bulgaria and Ted Ferguson, the president and CEO of AMBO.<ref name=bbc>

</ref>  On 30 October 2006, Albania and the Republic of Macedonia signed a protocol to determinate the entrance points of the pipeline. The entrance point will be [[Stebleve]] village in Albania and [[Lakaica]] village in the Republic of Macedonia. A similar protocol between Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia was signed later in 2006. 

On 31 January 2007, the Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria and Albania signed a trilateral convention on the construction of the Balkan pipeline AMBO.  This document has been ratified by the Parliaments of all three countries and governs the construction, operation, and maintenance of the pipelines.<ref name=set>

==Description==
The aim of the {{convert|912|km|adj=on}} long pipeline is to bypass the [[Turkish Straits]] in transportation of [[Russia]]n and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] oil.  The pipeline is expected to cost about US$1.5&nbsp;billion and it will have a capacity of {{convert|750000|oilbbl/d}}.<ref name=voa>

</ref>  There will be four pump stations, two in Bulgaria and one each in the Republic of Macedonia and Albania, constructed along the route. A pre-front-end engineering and design study (FEED) will be prepared by [[KBR (company)|KBR]].

Environmental studies to be conducted and construction licenses need to be obtained. The pipeline is expected to be operational by 2011.<ref name=downstream1>

==Alternative projects==
Other pipeline projects (which do not compete with AMBO since they serve entirely different markets) are the [[Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline]] from Burgas to [[Greece]] [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] port [[Alexandroupoli]], and the [[Pan-European Pipeline]] from [[Constan<U+0163>a]] in [[Romania]] to [[Trieste]] in [[Italy]]. There is also the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]]. Compared with  Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline, the AMBO pipeline is longer and more expensive, but at the same time Vlore (which is a sheltered, deep-water, all-weather port) could accommodate larger tankers and is more accessible than Alexandroupoli.<ref name=gr>
