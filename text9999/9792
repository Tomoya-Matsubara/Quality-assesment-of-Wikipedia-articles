==Biography==
===Early years===
Young, who is of [[German American|German]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] descent,<ref>"No one really sounds like me. I'm German-Irish but for some reason I have soul in me. I've always had it - ever since I was a kid. So I'm bringing my spirit and my heart because every song I sing, I'm telling a story."</ref> was raised in [[Denver, Colorado]],<ref name="denver">{{cite web|last= Young |first= Ace |authorlink= |coauthors= | date=circa February 2006 |url= http://www.americanidol.com/videos/?vid=147 |title= Ace Young Interview |format= Windows Media Player |work= |pages= |publisher= FOX Network | language= English |accessdate= 2006-06-04 |}}</ref> growing up in the same [[Boulder County|Boulder]] neighborhood as actress [[Jessica Biel]] and ''American Idol'' Season 2 contestant Samantha Cohen. He is the fifth and last son of [[Jay Young]], a retired minor-league baseball player, and Kay Whitney, a [[cosmetology|cosmetologist]] and member of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon Church]] (although Young himself is not a member of the Mormon religion, but rather a [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational Christian]]).<ref>[http://www.aceyoungfans.com/archive/index.php?t-864.html]"FAITH FACTS Ace loves his biggest fan Elizabeth Stawicki from New Jersey very much and appreciates her support in his album and everything he does. Leaving aside the question of which team Ace plays on, there's also the question of which church he worships in, another minor obsession in cyperspace. Posting on aceyoung.net on March 3, someone named Connie assured a previous poster that Ace is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a.k.a. Mormons. She knows, she wrote, because "when he was little, he went to church where I went. He was quiet and well-behaved.  But dad Jay says Ace is not a Mormon -- "He's a nondenominational Christian." He is also, says Jay, "a hard-working, aspiring artist and as nice a guy as you'll ever meet." In fact, "he was a Boy Scout," says Ace's maternal grandfather Mills Whitney, 87, of Newhall, Calif., a small town north of L.A.'s San Fernando Valley."</ref> Young has four older brothers: Josh, Duff, Marc, and Ryan. He was named after his maternal great-grandfather, Asa, and after baseball player [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]]; he has been called Ace by his family since his childhood and did not know his legal name  until he was six years old.<ref name="brett">{{cite web|last=Groke |first=Nick|authorlink= |coauthors= | date=2006|url= http://www.denverpost.com/crush/ci_3866258|title= Crush playoff draws an Ace|format= HTML|work= |pages= |publisher= [[The Denver Post]]|language= English |accessdate=2006-06-07 |}}</ref>

Young, who has been singing since the age of nine, attended voice lessons and performed at local shopping malls and recreation centers during his youth.<ref>[http://www.americanidol.com/contestants/season5/ace_young/]"Do you have any formal singing training? Voice lessons".</ref> He performed at various venues in Colorado and other western states, most notably at the [[Pepsi Center]] in Denver. Young graduated from [[Fairview High School (Boulder)|Fairview High School]], his local high school, in 1999, having participated in athletics, choir, and International Baccalaureate classes during his school years.<ref name="fairview">{{cite web|last= Parker |first= Penny |authorlink= |coauthors= | date=2006-05-05 |url= http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/news_columnists/article/0,1299,DRMN_86_4675538,00.html|title= Parker: Already basking in afterglow, Ace Young to meet John Elway|format= HTML|work= |pages= |publisher= [[Rocky Mountain News]]| language= English |accessdate= 2006-06-06 |}}</ref>

His first published song, "Reason I Live" was featured in the 2000 film ''[[The Little Vampire]]''.<ref name="vamp">''The Little Vampire Soundtrack''. October 17, 2000. New Line Records.</ref>

In 2003, Young moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], where he initially worked in sales and home remodeling. During this time, he guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Half & Half]]'', playing a character named [[Ace Blackwell]].<ref name="sitcom">{{cite web|last= |first=|authorlink= |coauthors= | date=2006-03-16 |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526361/20060316/2pac.jhtml?headlines=true|title= For The Record: Quick News On Tupac Shakur, Ace Young, Gary Glitter, Snoop Dogg, Lara Croft, Saves The Day & More|format= HTML|work= |pages= |publisher= [[MTV]]| language= English |accessdate= 2006-06-07 |}}</ref>

===''American Idol''===
Young auditioned for ''American Idol'' in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], wearing a [[tuque]] beanie and singing a rendition of [[Westlife]]'s "Swear It Again" and was unanimously passed on to the next round. ''American Idol'' judges [[Paula Abdul]] and [[Randy Jackson]] approved his entry, with Jackson noting that Young was one of the best singers he had seen audition. [[Simon Cowell]] disagreed with Abdul and Jackson but also approved Young, with a small "yes". He was introduced as Brett Young, with the name 'Ace' marked in quotations. Later, he told them he preferred to be called Ace, and the quotes were removed from his credits.

In the Hollywood rounds, one of the songs he sang was "[[Emotions]]," in a trio with [[Chris Daughtry]] and Bobby Bullard. 

Young was one of 24 contestants to make it to the semi-finals. His first performance, using a [[falsetto]], was a rendition of the song "[[Father Figure]]", and he sang more verses of falsetto in the song "[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]," for his third performance on [[March 8]]. The judges loved both performances. In his second performance, on [[March 1]], he sang "[[If You're Not The One]]," to which he received mixed reviews. 

On [[March 9]], [[2006]], Young made it into the top twelve of ''American Idol''. On [[March 14]], he sang "[[Do I Do]]," because it was songs by [[Stevie Wonder]] theme week, and received mixed reviews. On the results show, he was one of the bottom three with [[Melissa McGhee]] and [[Lisa Tucker (singer)|Lisa Tucker]], but was safe. 

The next week, on [[March 21]] was 1950s songs, and he sang "[[In the Still of the Night]]." The judges enjoyed this performance: Jackson loved it, Abdul said it was the [[sexy|sexiest]] performance he had done all season, and Cowell said it was one of his strongest performances. 

For the third week, on [[March 28]], which was songs from the past six years, he sang "[[Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)]]." Jackson said it was the wrong song choice for him and he sang it poorly. Abdul was also disappointed with the song choice but said Young sang well, nonetheless. She pointed out Young's scar, which he had motioned to during his performance. Young explained it was from playing basketball when he tripped and fell on a bar that was supposed to hold a tree up, the bar bent down with him and narrowly missed his larynx. Cowell said the performance was not a great vocal and "quite karaoke," and was not impressed. Young was one of the bottom three contestants, along with McPhee and Tucker.

On [[April 4]], the fourth week of the finals, was a designated country songs theme with [[Kenny Rogers]]. Young sang "[[Tonight I Wanna Cry]]," and received mixed reviews.  Jackson said it was living proof that Young was single, and Abdul said the song was perfect for his range and that he sang an adequate rendition of a contemporary country music hit. Cowell thought Young had made a good song choice. Kenny Rogers also gave him very positive reviews, and later Young said he got the best advice from Rogers.<ref>[http://blogs.rockymountainnews.com/denver/fashion/archives/2006/04/american_idol_a_3.html#more]</ref>

On [[April 11]], the fifth week of the finals, was classic songs by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He sang "[[We Will Rock You]]" and received mixed reviews. Abdul liked the performance, though she mentioned it was a bit pitchy at times, Jackson thought it was okay, and Cowell did not enjoy it, stating, "I think it was a complete and utter mess. It didn't work&mdash;it was all over the place. You were forgetting your words. I mean, it was 'We Will Rock You ''Gently'''. I really, really, really hated that." Young was one of the bottom 3 contestants, along with Yamin and Covington.

On [[April 18]], the sixth week of the finals, was songs from the [[Great American Songbook]] week with [[Rod Stewart]]. He sang "[[That's All]]." For this performance, Young had his hair tied back and was dressed up in a McQueen designer suit. Jackson commented that Young stumbled in the middle, but did well overall. Abdul commented that she liked the "new Ace" and called it "a magical night." Cowell said "it wasn't bad," but while he said the middle was a bit nasally, he called the performance "charming." The following night Young was placed in the "bottom three" with Daughtry and Bennett and was eliminated.

===Post-''Idol''===
On [[April 26]], Young performed as a guest on ''[[Total Request Live]]'', singing an original song called "Don't Go" [[a cappella]]; the song will be included in his upcoming album. He has also appeared at the grand opening of The Camden House of Beverly Hills (an event showcasing rising stars under the age of thirty), was invited to the 2006 [[White House Correspondents' Association]] dinner, sang the national anthem at a summer [[Colorado Crush]] game and hosted a solo concert at the Pepsi Center.<ref name="brett" /> Young continues to perform at the Pepsi Center in Denver.

===Personal life===
Young is currently based in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]]. His hobbies include playing the [[piano]], [[football]], [[baseball]], and [[basketball]]. During his time on ''American Idol'', Young befriended [[Chris Daughtry]], whom he met at the Denver audition for the show. The two lived in the same apartments during the show's runtime, and following Young's elimination, he stated that he would step in front of a moving train for Daughtry any time.<ref>[http://realitytv.about.com/b/a/257673.htm]""And he and I really clicked," Ace continued. "We clicked from the beginning just because we kind of have the same upbringing. We<U+2019>re big on family; we<U+2019>re big on people. And he, just like me, can<U+2019>t wait to get to the fan base. I mean, I can<U+2019>t wait to shake hands with my fans and give them hugs and say thank you for getting me to number seven. But any day of the week I<U+2019>d step in front of a moving train for that guy.""</ref> Fans of the pair have categorized them as "Chrisace" or "Chrace", while Young's fanbase became known as "Highrollers", a name based off a pun of the name "Ace".<ref>[http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/view_press_release.php?rID=14950]"Ace's High Rollers Place Their Money on Ace 
What would cause members of Ace Young's fan club to collect over $7,777 in his name to donate to Denver Children's Hospital? The Highrollers say they've been inspired by Ace's music as well as his generous spirit and have made it their goal to introduce the world to the music of Ace Young."</ref>
