The '''Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail''' is a state-designated system of [[trail]]s, [[bird sanctuary|bird sanctuaries]], and [[nature preserve]]s along the entire length of the [[Texas]] [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] in the [[United States]]. As the state of Texas hosts more bird species than any other in the U.S. the trail system offers some of the most unusual opportunities for [[bird-watching]] in the world.<ref name="Schultz 2007 pp. 779-780">Schultz (2007), pp. 779&ndash;780.</ref><ref name="Wauer 1998 p. 1">Wauer (1998), p. 1.</ref> The "trail" is actually 43 separate hiking and driving trails that include 308 birding sites. The sites themselves feature a variety of viewing opportunities with boardwalks, observation decks, and other amenities. The trails boast more than 450 bird species.<ref name="White (2003), pg. 2.">White (2003), pg. 2.</ref> The trail system is managed by the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] as part of the Great Texas Wildlife Trails which also include the [[Heart of Texas Wildlife Trail]], the [[Panhandle Plains Wildlife Trail]], and the [[Prairies and Pineywoods Wildlife Trail]].

Apart from bird watching the trail system includes many [[nature preserve]]s which feature a wide variety of wildlife. In addition the various sites cover many types of natural terrain and flora including forests, marshes, and beaches.

This trail network was the first of its kind in the U.S. though many states have since followed.<ref name="Schultz 2007 pp. 779-780"/><ref name="Wauer 1998 p. 1"/><ref name="NOAA Coastal Services Center">{{cite web | title=Visitors Flock to Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail | date=May/June 2000 | publisher=NOAA Coastal Services Center | url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/magazine/2000/03/birdtrail.html}}</ref><ref name="NWF: Trail">{{cite web | url=http://www.nwf.org/NationalWildlife/article.cfm?issueID=107&articleID=1339 | title=Getting on the Trail of America<U+2019>s Birds | author=Stewart, Doug | publisher=National Wildlife Federation | accessdate=11 Nov 2009}}</ref> The trail system remains the nation's largest.<ref name="ABA: North America"/><ref name="Bigony, Mary-Love">{{cite web | url=http://www.gorp.com/weekend-guide/travel-ta-houston-texas-birdwatching-sidwcmdev_054978.html | title=Destinations: Hail to the Trail!: The Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail | author=Bigony, Mary-Love | publisher=Orbitz Away LLC | accessdate=12 Nov 2009}}</ref> One of the most well-known locations along the trail system is the [[Aransas National Wildlife Refuge]], which holds the winter home of the only natural flock of [[whooping crane]]s in the world.<ref name="Shultz 2007 p. 780"/>

==History==
[[File:The Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail 467.JPG|thumb|right|A road sign for the trail system in [[Newton County, Texas|Newton County]]<ref>The UTC sign has an add-on that denotes the site number which is the location of the sign. The location of this sign and site is on the westbound side of [[U.S. Route 190]] just west of the "Welcome to Texas sign" near the Sabine River.</ref>]] 

The Texas coast has been popular among bird watchers in the United States for decades.<ref name="NWF: Trail"/> Located where the [[Central Flyway]] meets the Gulf coast and the [[Mississippi Flyway]], the region sees a large number of [[bird migration|migrants]]; in addition, the southern part of the Texas coast is far enough south to host a number of tropical species.<ref>Ritter (2007), p. 1.</ref>  A 1991 American Birding Association (ABA) study by Roland Wauer showed that Texas was the top bird watching destination in the United States for its members.<ref name="Cornell">{{cite web | title=The Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail: A Tool for Avitourism | author=Lindsay, Madge (Texas Parks and Wildlife) | publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University | accessdate=10 Nov 2009 | url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/pifcapemay/lindsay.htm}}</ref> In 1993 the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] began a $1.5 million project to develop public and private resources to utilize as bird sanctuaries and observation sites. The plan and the concept were largely developed by Ted Eubanks and Madge Lindsay.<ref name="ABA: North America">{{cite web | url=http://www.aba.org/resources/birdingtrails.html | title=Birding Trails in North America | publisher=American Birding Association | accessdate=11 Nov 2009}}</ref> Site improvements included trail markers, trail development, boardwalks, observation stations, and many others. The goal was both to encourage environmental protection and to establish a tourism network that would benefit businesses throughout the Texas Gulf Coast region catering to [[ecotourism|ecotourists]].<ref name="Cornell"/>

The Central Coast section of the trail network was opened in 1994 with more than 95 sites. The other sections opened soon afterward.<ref name="Cornell"/> The trail system was completed in 2000.<ref name="BWD">{{cite web | title=North America's New Birding Trails | publisher=Bird Watcher's Digest | accessdate=11 Nov 2009 | url=http://www.birdwatchersdigest.com/site/travel/trail_flyways.aspx}}</ref> Markers featuring a logo with a [[black skimmer]] are present on each of the viewing sites.<ref name="BWD"/> Soon other wildlife trail networks were developed in other parts of Texas, and other states established their own wildlife trail systems patterned after the Texas model.

==Current==
Sites along the trail systems are today popular among birding enthusiasts, both domestic and international.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.co.chambers.tx.us/tourism/birding.html | title=Bird Watching | publisher=Chambers County | accessdate=11 Nov 2009}}</ref> Events such as the state's Great Texas Birding Classic continue to build interest in the trails among nature lovers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gcbo.org/default.aspx/MenuItemID/138.htm | title=Great Texas Birding Class | publisher=Gulf Coast Bird Observatory | accessdate=11 Nov 2009}}<br />{{cite web | url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/birding/gtbc/ | title=Great Texas Birding Class | publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife | accessdate=11 Nov 2009}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Further|Gulf Coastal Plains|Piney Woods|Western Gulf coastal grasslands}}

[[File:AnahuacSnowGeese.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snow Goose|Snow Geese]] over the wetlands of [[Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge]].]]

The region covered by the trail network is part of the [[Texas Coastal Bend|Gulf Coastal Plains]]. With annual rainfall averages ranging from about {{convert|20|to|58|in|mm}}, this is a nearly level, drained plain dissected by streams and rivers flowing into [[Estuary|estuaries]] and [[marsh]]es. Windblown [[sand]]s and [[dune]]s, [[grassland]]s, oak mottes and [[salt marsh]]es make up the seaward areas.<ref name="Regions">{{cite web|url= http://www.lone-star.net/mall/txtrails/regions.htm|title= LoneStarInternet|accessdate= 2006-07-14|archivedate=}}</ref>

The region stretches from the [[Piney Woods]] of [[East Texas]] to the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|Texas Coastal Prairies]] that dominate the majority of the coast south of [[Houston]]. The Piney Woods area features groves of [[pine]] and other [[hardwood]] trees such as [[oak]], [[magnolia]], and American Sweet Gum (''[[Liquidambar styraciflua]]''). This wooded area which has supported Texas' lumber industry since the 19th century is now considered one of the most critically endangered ecosystems in the world.<ref name="WWFReport">{{WWF ecoregion |id=na0523|name=Piney Woods forests|accessdate=2009-06-14}}</ref> These woodland areas of the trail network stretch from the [[Big Thicket]] area in the east to [[Sam Houston National Forest]] in the west, with pockets of woodlands stretching down into the area around [[Galveston Bay]] near Houston.

The Prairie regions feature a variety of grass types, particularly Indiangrass (''[[Sorghastrum nutans]]''), [[Big Bluestem]] (''Andropogon gerardii''), [[Little bluestem]] (''Schizachyrium scoparium''), and Switchgrass (''[[Panicum virgatum]]'').<ref name="WWF: Grasslands">{{WWF ecoregion | name=Western Gulf Coastal grasslands | accessdate=11 Nov 2009 | id=na0701}}</ref> The grasslands around the [[Laguna Madre]] near [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] are considered some of the most important.<ref name="WWF: Grasslands"/>

Parts of extreme [[South Texas]] around [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] and the [[Rio Grande Valley|Rio Grande]] feature forests of Sabal Palm (''[[Sabal mexicana]]'') and Texas Ebony (''[[Ebenopsis ebano]]'').<ref>Schmidly (2002), p. 319.</ref> These forests, once widespread in the region, were mostly cleared during the 1900s though some clusters, particularly the Sabal Palm Audubon Center and Sanctuary, remain.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sabalpalmaudubon.org/ | title=Sabal Palm Audubon Center | publisher=Audubon Texas | accessdate=24 Jan 2010}}</ref> The areas around [[Zapata, Texas|Zapata]] and [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], which though significantly inland are considered part of the "coastal" trail system, feature a [[semi-arid climate]] as they lie near the eastern edge of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ci.laredo.tx.us/LCVB/birds.html | title=Laredo, Texas Birding Guide | publisher=City of Laredo | accessdate=11 Nov 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[Scrubland|Scrub]] vegetation dominates the area with the Rio Grande and lakes supporting substantial wildlife diversity.

The coastline features numerous bays and lakes including [[Sabine Lake]], Galveston Bay, [[Matagorda Bay]], [[San Antonio Bay]], [[Copano Bay]], [[Corpus Christi Bay]], [[Baffin Bay]], and the Laguna Madre.<ref>Blackburn (2004), p. 61&ndash;63.</ref>

Typical varieties of birds along the length of the system include [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], and [[seagull]]s with many other species found in particular locations.<ref name="Texas Less Traveled">{{cite web | title=Texas Coastal Bend: Land of the Birds (Texas Less Traveled) | publisher=Lost Planet Media | accessdate=11 Nov 2009 | url=http://texaslesstraveled.com/coastalbendbirds.htm}}</ref> The endangered [[Whooping Crane]]s that winter in [[Aransas National Wildlife Refuge]] are among the most famous.<ref name="Shultz 2007 p. 780"/> The [[Black Skimmer]], adopted as a symbol of the trail system, can be found throughout almost the entire coastline.<ref>Lockwood (2007), p. 154.</ref>

Apart from the many varieties of bird species many other types of animals can be found along the trails. [[American alligator]]s, [[bobcat]]s, [[coyote]]s, and [[nutria]] are common in areas of the Upper Coast.<ref name="TPWD: GTCBT"/><ref>Ramos (2004), p. 141.</ref> [[Collared Peccary|Collared Peccaries]], the [[Texas spiny lizard]], and the [[Drymarchon melanurus erebennus|Texas Indigo Snake]] can be found further south.<ref name="TPWD: LTC"/> In the Central Coast the [[Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma|Western Cottonmouth]] snake is prominent, not to mention [[dolphin]]s and other marine mammals along the Gulf. [[Nine-banded Armadillo]]s and [[White-tailed deer]] can be seen throughout.<ref name="Texas Less Traveled"/> The [[Rio Grande Valley]] is particularly known for the many varieties of [[butterfly|butterflies]] that inhabit the area (celebrated by the annual Texas Butterfly Festival in Mission).<ref name="Wauer (2004), p. 19"/> Resident species include the [[Dryas iulia|Julia]], [[Heliconius charithonia|Zebra]], [[Myscelia ethusa|Mexican Bluewing]], and [[Anartia jatrophae|White Peacock]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/wildlife_trails/coastal/lower/santaana/ | title=Santa Ana Loop | publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife | accessdate=11 Nov 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.texasbutterfly.com | title=Texas Butterfly Festival | publisher=Mission Chamber of Commerce | accessdate=11 Nov 2009}}</ref>

==Sections==
*The Great Texas Wildlife Trail is divided into three major sections: the Upper Coast, Central Coast, and Lower Coast regions.<ref name="Schultz 2007 pp. 779-780"/>

[[File:Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail Map.png|thumb | left|alt=A map of Texas showing the counties with the coastal region and the lower Rio Grande Valley highlighted. | Counties containing sites in the trail system.]]

Within each section there are 43 "loops," hiking and driving trails containing specific birding sites ranging from parks and observatories to nature preserves and wildlife refuges.<ref name="Schultz 2007 pp. 779-780"/> Individual sites may contain any number of individual hiking trails through a wide variety of terrain. Some venues are particularly well known for specific viewing opportunities. The Bolivar Flats area is especially well known for its abundance of [[shorebird]]s.<ref name="BWD"/> The wetlands of [[Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge]] is known for the multitude of [[waterfowl]].<ref name="BWD"/> [[High Island, Texas|High Island]] is known for its nesting colonies of [[spoonbill]]s and [[heron]]s.<ref name="BWD"/> The [[Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge]] is a major preserve created for the protection of the endangered [[Attwater's Prairie Chicken]]. The loops of the Lower Coast feature a variety of [[Dark-eyed junco|snowbirds]] from [[Canada]] and the northern U.S. which winter in the region.<ref name="BWD"/>

Along the coast near [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] one can find [[pelican]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[Horned Grebe]]s, [[New World oriole|orioles]], [[Cape May Warbler]]s, [[Laughing Gull]]s.<ref>White (2003), p. 23&ndash;26.</ref> The area around Galveston Bay and Houston is home to [[Henslow's Sparrow]]s, [[Roseate Spoonbill]]s, [[White-faced Ibis]]es, [[Marsh Wren]]s, [[Seaside Sparrow]]s, [[Snow Goose|Snow Geese]], [[Yellow Rail|Yellow]] and [[Black Rail]]s, and [[Northern Harrier]]s.<ref>White (2003), p. 23&ndash;32.</ref> The [[Smith Point, Texas|Smith Point]] peninsula contains a 20-foot observation tower offering views of [[Broad-winged Hawk]]s and other [[hawk]] species.<ref>White (2003), p. 30.</ref> Closer to the coast [[seagull]]s, [[Peregrine Falcon]]s, and [[Seaside Sparrow]]s may be visible.<ref>White (2003), p. 36.</ref>
