'''Jerry Mouse''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[animated]] character, one of the main characters in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s series of ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' theatrical cartoon short films. Created by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]], Jerry is  a brown [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[mouse]], who first appeared in the 1940 MGM animated short ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]''.<ref name="JBarberaPuss">{{Cite book  | last = Barbera  | first = Joe  | authorlink = Joseph Barbera  | coauthors = | title = My Life in 'Toons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century  | publisher = Turner Publishing| year = 1994| location = Atlanta, GA| pages = 73<U+2013>76| url =| doi =| id =| isbn = 1-57036-042-1 }}</ref> Hanna gave the mouse's original name as "Jerry",<ref name="WHannaPuss">{{Cite book  | last = Hanna | first = William | authorlink = William Hanna  | coauthors = | title = A Cast of Friends  | publisher = Da Capo Press| year = 2000| location = | pages = 39<U+2013>46| url =| doi =| id =| isbn = 0306809176 }}</ref> while Barbera claimed the mouse went unnamed in his first appearance.<ref name="JBarberaPuss" />

==History==
===''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons===
The name "Jerry" was chosen by MGM animator John Carr, who submitted "Tom and Jerry" as potential names for the duo after an important [[Loews Inc.]] distributor in Texas asked for follow-ups to ''Puss Gets the Boot''.<ref name="JBarberaPuss" /> While the idea of a cat-and-mouse duo was considered shopworn by the 1940s<ref name="JBarberaPuss" />, Hanna and Barbera decided to expand upon the standard expected hunter/prey relationship. Their Jerry Mouse, an "incurable scene stealer",<ref name="HannaonTJ" /> served more or less as the protagonist of most of the films; instead of being a "cowering victim" of his pursuer, [[Tom Cat]], he took delight in besting, and often torturing, his antagonist.<ref name="JBarberaPuss" /> Hanna and Barbera considered Tom and Jerry "the best of enemies", whose rivalry hid an unspoken amount of mutual respect.<ref name="HannaonTJ" />

In later ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, Jerry acquired a young ward: a small grey mouse called "[[Tuffy]]" or "Nibbles" depending upon the cartoon,<ref name="JBarberaTuffy" /><ref name="MaltinTuffy" /> who was left on Jerry's doorstep as a [[foundling]] baby in the 1946 short ''[[The Milky Waif]]''.<ref name="MaltinTuffy">{{Cite book  | last = Maltin | first = Leonard | authorlink = Leonard Maltin  | coauthors = | title = Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons  | publisher =Plume| date = 1980, rev. 1987| location = New York| pages = 303<U+2013>304| url =| doi =| id =| isbn = 0452259932 }}</ref> Jerry and Tuffy were also featured together in a sub-series of ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons set in 17th century [[France]] which featured the characters as [[musketeers]].<ref name="JBarberaTuffy">{{Cite book  | last = Barbera  | first = Joe  | authorlink = Joseph Barbera  | coauthors = | title = My Life in 'Toons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century  | publisher = Turner Publishing| year = 1994| location = Atlanta, GA| pages = 96| url =| doi =| id =| isbn = 1-57036-042-1 }}</ref> The first of these shorts, ''[[The Two Mouseketeers]]'', won the 1952 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons]].<ref name="JBarberaTuffy" />

Hanna and Barbera served as writer/directors of the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons until 1956, when they also became the producers.<ref name="BarrierMGMclosing">Barrier, Michael (1999). ''Hollywood Cartoons''. New York: Oxford University Press. Pg. 547-548.

===''Anchors Aweigh''===
On his own, Jerry Mouse appears in a fantasy sequence in the 1945 [[Gene Kelly]] MGM [[musical film]] ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]''.<ref name=nytimesGene>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0823.html |title=Gene Kelly, Dancer of Vigor and Grace, Dies |accessdate=2010-05-13 |author=Albin Krebbs |date=February 3, 1996 |work= |publisher=[[NY Times]]}}</ref> Jerry appears as the ruler of a kingdom where music is banned because he feels he lacks talent, and Kelly persuades the mouse into performing a song-and-dance number with him.<ref name="HannaonAnchors">{{Cite book  | last = Hanna | first = William | authorlink = William Hanna  | coauthors = | title = A Cast of Friends  | publisher = Da Capo Press| year = 2000| location = | pages = 61<U+2013>64| url =| doi =| id =| isbn = 0306809176 }}</ref> Kelly and MGM had originally wanted [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse]] as Kelly's dance partner for the sequence, but Disney was unwilling to license the character.<ref name="JBarberaAnchor">{{Cite book  | last = Barbera  | first = Joe  | authorlink = Joseph Barbera  | coauthors = | title = My Life in 'Toons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century  | publisher = Turner Publishing| year = 1994| location = Atlanta, GA| pages = 97<U+2013>98| url =| doi =| id =| isbn = 1-57036-042-1 }}</ref>

Hanna and Barbera achieved the effect of Kelly dancing with Jerry by [[rotoscoping]]: live-action plates of Kelly dancing alone were shot first, and the action traced frame by frame so that Jerry's movements would match.<ref name="JBarberaAnchor" /> The success of the animated segment of ''Anchors Aweigh'', which was noted as "stealing the show" in contemporary trade reviews,<ref name="HannaonAnchors" /> led to two more live-action/animated projects for Hanna and Barbera and MGM: an underwater ballet sequence featuring both Tom and Jerry in [[Esther Williams]]' 1953 film ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]'', and the "Sinbad the Sailor" sequence of Kelly's 1956 film ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]''.<ref name="JBarberaAnchor" />

==Voice actors==
