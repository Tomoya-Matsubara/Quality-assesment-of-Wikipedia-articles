== History ==

{{main|History of Oldham}}

=== Toponymy ===
The [[toponymy]] of Oldham seems to imply "old village or place" from ''Eald'' ([[Anglo-Saxon language|Saxon]]) signifying oldness or antiquity, and ''Ham'' (Saxon) a house, farm or [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]].<ref name="Oldham Sketches" /> Oldham is however known to be a derivative of ''Aldehulme'', undoubtedly an [[Old Norse]] name.<ref name="Oldham 100" /> It is believed to be derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ald'' combined with the Old Norse ''holmi'' or ''holmr'', meaning "old promontory or outcrop", possibly describing the town's hilltop position.<ref name="Oldham 100">{{citation|title=A Centenary History of Oldham|year=1949|publisher=[[County Borough of Oldham|Oldham County Borough Council]]|first=Hartley|last=Bateson|isbn=5-00-095162-X}}</ref> It has alternatively been suggested that it may mean "holm or hulme of a farmer named Alda".<ref name="Oldham 100" /> The name is understood to date from 865, during the period of the [[Danelaw]].<ref name="Oldham 100" />

=== Early history ===
The earliest known evidence of a human presence in what is now Oldham is attested by the discovery of [[Neolithic]] flint arrow-heads and workings found at [[Werneth, Greater Manchester|Werneth]] and Besom Hill, implying habitation 7<U+2013>10,000 years ago.<ref name="Oldham 100" /> Evidence of later [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] activity is confirmed by an ancient [[Roman road]] and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological relics found at various sites within the town.<ref name="Oldham 100" /> Placenames of Celtic origin are still to be found in Oldham, Werneth derives from a Celtic personal name identical to the [[Gaulish]] ''vernetum'' and [[Glodwick]] may be related to the [[modern Welsh]] ''clawdd'', meaning "dyke" or "ditch".<ref>Bateson, Hartley (1949) ''A Centenary History of Oldham''. Published by Oldham County Borough Council, p. 3</ref> Nearby [[Chadderton]] is also pre-Anglo-Saxon in origin, from the [[Old Welsh]] ''cadeir'', itself deriving from the [[Latin]] ''cathedra'' meaning "chair".{{sfn|Mills|1976|p=39|ps=}}  Although [[Anglo-Saxons]] occupied territory around the area centuries earlier,<ref name="Oldham 100" /><ref name="Ballard">{{citation| last=Ballard |first=Elsie |title=A Chronicle of Crompton |publisher=Burnage Press |year=1986 |origyear=1967 |isbn= 5-00-096678-3 |edition=2nd }}</ref> Oldham as a permanent, named place of dwelling is believed to date from 865, when [[Danelaw|Danish invaders]] established a settlement called Aldehulme.<ref name="Oldham 100" /><ref name="Oldham Legion">{{citation|title=Oldham From the XX Legion to the 20th Century|first=J.D|last=Daly|publisher=|isbn=5-00-091284-5}}</ref>

From its founding in the 9th century until the [[Industrial Revolution]], Oldham is believed to have been little more than a scattering of small and insignificant settlements spread across the [[moorland]] and dirt tracks which linked [[Manchester]] to [[York]].<ref name="Oldham 100" /><ref name="GM Arch">{{citation|last=McNeil|first=R.|last2=Nevell|first2= M.|title=A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of Greater Manchester|publisher=Association for Industrial Archaeology|year=2000|isbn=0-9528930-3-7}}</ref> Although not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], Oldham does appear in legal documents from the [[Middle Ages]], invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor [[Feudalism|ruling families]] and [[baron]]s.<ref name="Oldham Legion" /> In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from [[the Crown]] by a family surnamed [[Oldham (surname)|Oldham]], whose seat was at [[Werneth, Greater Manchester|Werneth Hall]].<ref name="Oldham Sketches">{{citation|title=Historical Sketches of Oldham|publisher=E.J.

=== Industrial Revolution and cotton ===
[[File:Oldham From Glodwick.png|thumb|''Oldham from [[Glodwick]]'' by [[James Howe Carse]] (1831), depicts the early skyline and industrial activities of Oldham. All the [[Open space reserve|green space]] has since been [[Urbanization|urbanised]].]]
Much of Oldham's history is concerned with [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]; it has been said that "if ever the [[Industrial Revolution]] placed a town firmly and squarely on the map of the world, that town is Oldham."<ref name="GM Evolution">{{Harvnb|Frangopulo|1977|p=154}}.</ref> Oldham's soils were too thin and poor to sustain [[crop]] growing, and so for decades prior to [[industrialisation]] the area was used for grazing [[sheep]], which provided the raw material for a local [[wool]]len weaving trade.<ref name="Oldham Sketches" />

By 1756, Oldham had emerged as centre of the [[hatter|hatting]] industry in England. The rough [[felt]] used in the production process is the origin of the term "Owdham Roughyed" a [[nickname]] for people from Oldham.<ref name="Oldham 100" /> It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that Oldham changed from being a [[cottage industry]] township producing woollen garments via domestic [[manual labour]], to a sprawling industrial metropolis of textile factories.<ref name="Oldham Sketches" /> The climate, geology, and topography of Oldham were unrelenting constraints upon the social and economic activities of the human inhabitants.<ref name="Oldham nature" /> At {{convert|700|ft|m|0}} above sea level and with no major river or visible natural resources, Oldham had poor geographic attributes compared with other settlements for investors and their engineers. As a result, Oldham played no part in the initial period of the Industrial Revolution,<ref name="Cotton Mills" /><ref name="GM Arch" /> although it did later become seen as obvious territory to industrialise because of its convenient position between the labour forces of [[Manchester]] and southwest [[Yorkshire]].<ref name="Foster" />

[[Cotton]] [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[cotton mill|milling]] were introduced to Oldham when its first mill, Lees Hall, was built by William Clegg in about 1778, the beginning of a spiralling process of [[urbanisation]] and [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] transformation.<ref name="Cotton Mills" /> Within a year, 11 other mills had been constructed,<ref name="Oldham 100" /> and by 1818 there were 19&nbsp;<U+2013> not a large number in comparison with other local settlements.<ref name="GM Arch" /> Oldham's small local population was greatly increased by the mass migration of workers from outlying villages,<ref name="Oldham 100" /> resulting in a population increase from just over {{formatnum:12000}} in 1801 to {{formatnum:137000}} in 1901.<ref name="GM Arch" /> The speed of this urban growth meant that Oldham, with little pre-industrial history to speak of, was effectively born as a [[mill town|factory town]].
[[File:Royd Mill, Hollinwood.jpg|thumb|Royd mill, built in 1907,<ref name="Cotton Mills" /> and seen here in 1983, was one of the more than 360 textile mills that operated night and day during Oldham's peak.]]
Oldham became the world's manufacturing centre for cotton spinning in the second half of the 19th century.<ref name="GM Arch" /> In 1851, over 30% of Oldham's population was employed within the textile sector, compared to 5% across Great Britain.<ref name="Foster">{{citation|last=Foster|first=John|title=Class Struggle and the Industrial Revolution&nbsp;<U+2013> Early industrial capitalism in three English towns|publisher=Weidenfield & Nicolson|year=1974|isbn=978-0-297-76681-0}}</ref> It overtook the major urban centres of [[Manchester]] and [[Bolton]] as the result of a mill building boom in the 1860s and 1870s, a period during which Oldham became the most productive cotton-spinning town in the world.<ref name="GM Arch" /> In 1871 Oldham had more [[Cotton-spinning machinery|spindles]] than any country in the world except the United States, and in 1909, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined.<ref name="Contaminated">{{citation|url=http://www.oldham.gov.uk/contaminatedlandstrategy.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contaminated Land Strategy 2001|page=16|year=2001|accessdate=11 March 2008|author=Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council|publisher=oldham.gov.uk}}</ref> By 1911 there were 16.4&nbsp;million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of 58&nbsp;million in the United Kingdom and 143.5&nbsp;million in the world; in 1928, with the construction of the UK's largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith.<ref name="GM Arch" /> At its peak, there were more than 360 mills, operating night and day;<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.visitoldham.co.uk/heritage/history.htm|title=Visit Oldham&nbsp;<U+2013> The History of Oldham|publisher=visitoldham.co.uk|date=|accessdate=16 September 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927003326/http://www.visitoldham.co.uk/heritage/history.htm |archivedate = 27 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref name="Oldham Spinning Web">{{citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=52&sub=nwcotton&theme=places&crumb=Oldham|title=Spinning The Web&nbsp;<U+2013> Oldham|publisher=spinningtheweb.org.uk|date=|accessdate=28 June 2006}}</ref> Oldham's townscape was dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills.{{sfn|Sellers|1991|p=47}} Oldham was hit hard by the [[Lancashire Cotton Famine]] of 1861<U+2013>1865, when supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut off. Wholly reliant upon the textile industry, the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town.{{sfn|Millett|1996|p=}} By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central government, land was purchased with the intention of employing local cotton workers to construct [[Alexandra Park, Oldham|Alexandra Park]], which opened on 28 August 1865.{{sfn|Millett|1996|p=}} Said to have over-relied upon the textile sector,<ref name="GM Evolution" /><ref name="Oldham Legion" /> as the importation of cheaper foreign [[yarn]]s grew during the 20th century, Oldham's economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of cotton spinning.<ref name="GM Evolution" /><ref name="GM Arch" /><ref name="Bygone Oldham" /> In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton spun in the town was in 1998.<ref name="GM Arch" />

==== Engineering ====
Facilitated by its flourishing textile industry, Oldham developed extensive [[Structural engineering|structural]] and [[mechanical engineering]] sectors during the 18th and 19th centuries. The manufacture of [[Cotton-spinning machinery|spinning and weaving machinery]] in Oldham belongs to the last decade of the 19th century, when it became a leading centre in the field of [[engineering]].<ref name="Oldham 100" /> The [[Platt Brothers]], originated in nearby [[Dobcross]] village, but moved to Oldham. They were pioneers of cotton-spinning machinery, developing innovative products that enabled the mass-production of cotton yarn. Platt Brothers became the largest textile machine makers in the world, employing over {{formatnum:15000}} people in the 1890s,<ref name="Oldham Beyond">{{citation|url=http://www.oldham.gov.uk/oldham_beyond_vision.pdf|format=PDF|title=Oldham Beyond; A Vision for the Borough of Oldham|date=April 2004|accessdate=1 November 2007|publisher=Oldham.gov.uk|author=URBED}}</ref> twice the number of their nearest rivals Dobson & Barlow in Bolton and Asa Lees on [[Greenacres, Greater Manchester|Greenacres Moor]].<ref name="Oldham Spinning Web" /> They were keen investors in the local area and at one time, were supporting 42% of the population.<ref name="Oldham Beyond" /> The centre of the company lay at the New Hartford Works in [[Werneth, Greater Manchester|Werneth]], a massive complex of buildings and internal railways on a site overlooking Manchester. The railway station which served this site later formed the basis of [[Oldham Werneth railway station]], which together with the main building exists to this day. Platts gained prestigious awards from around the world,{{sfn|Millett|1996|p=}} and were heavily involved with local politics and civic pride in Oldham.<ref name="Oldham Beyond" /> John and James Platt were the largest subscribers for promoting Oldham from a township to a [[municipal borough|Borough]], pledging <U+00A3>100 (more than double the next largest sum) in advance towards any expenses which may have been incurred by the [[Royal Charter]].<ref name="Oldham 100" /> In 1854 [[John Platt (MP)|John Platt]] was made the (fourth) Mayor of Oldham, an office he was to hold twice more in 1855<U+2013>56 and 1861<U+2013>62.<ref name="Platts">{{citation|title=Platts; Textile Machinery Makers|last=Eastham|first=Reginald H.|publisher=R.H Eastham|year=1994|isbn=}}</ref> John Platt was elected in 1865 to become [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]], and was re-elected in 1868; he remained in office until his death in 1872.<ref name="Oldham 100" /> A bronze statue of Platt existed in the town centre for years, though was moved to [[Alexandra Park, Oldham|Alexandra Park]]. There have been recommendations for it to be returned to the town centre.<ref name="Oldham Heart" />

Abraham Henthorn Stott, the son of a [[stonemason]], was born in nearby [[Shaw and Crompton]] in 1822.<ref name="Cotton Mills" /> He served a seven-year apprenticeship with [[Sir Charles Barry]], before starting a structural engineering practice in Oldham in 1847 that went on to become the pre-eminent mill architect firm in [[Lancashire]].<ref name="Cotton Mills" /> Philip Sydney Stott, third son of Abraham and later titled as [[Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet]], was the most prominent and famous of the Stott mill architects.<ref name="Cotton Mills" /> He established his own practice in 1883 and designed over a hundred mills in several countries. His factories, which improved upon his father's [[Fireproofing|fireproof]] mills, accounted for a 40% increase in Oldham's spindles between 1887 and 1914.<ref name="Cotton Mills" />

Although textile-related engineering declined with the processing industry, leading to the demise of both Stotts and Platts, other engineering firms existed, notably electrical and later electronic engineers [[Ferranti]] in 1896.<ref name="Oldham Spinning Web" /> Ferranti went into receivership in 1993, but some of its former works continue in other hands. Part of the original [[Hollinwood, Greater Manchester|Hollinwood]] site was operated by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] Metering and Semiconductor divisions.<ref name="Oldham Spinning Web" /> The remainder of the site is occupied by Mirror Colour Print Ltd; the printing division of the [[Trinity Mirror]] group, which prints and distributes thirty-six major newspapers, and employs five hundred staff.<ref>[http://www.oldham.gov.uk/working/economic_profile/printing_publishing.htm Oldham's Economic Profile&nbsp;<U+2013> Printing & Publishing], oldham.gov.uk.

==== Coal mining ====
On the back of the Industrial Revolution, Oldham developed an extensive coal mining sector, correlated to supporting the local cotton industry and the town's inhabitants, though there is evidence of small scale coal mining in the area as early as the 16th century.<ref name="Coalfield" /> The [[Oldham Coalfield]] stretched from [[Royton]] in the north to [[Bardsley, Greater Manchester|Bardsley]] in the south and in addition to Oldham, included the towns of [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] and [[Chadderton]] to the west.<ref name="Coalfield">{{citation|last=Nadin|first=Jack|title=The Oldham Coalfield|isbn=0-7524-2945-0|year=2006|publisher=Tempus Publishing Limited}}</ref> The Oldham Coalfield was the site of over 150 collieries during its [[recorded history]].<ref name="Coalfield" /> Although some contemporary sources suggest there was coal mining in Oldham at a commercial scale by 1738,<ref name="Coalfield" /> older sources attribute the commercial expansion of coal mining with the arrival in the town of two [[Welsh people|Welsh]] labourers, John Evans and William Jones, around 1770.<ref name="Oldham 100" /> Foreseeing the growth in demand for coal as a source of motive and steam power, they acquired colliery rights for Oldham, which by 1771 had 14 colliers.<ref name="Oldham 100" /> The mines were largely to the southwest of the town around [[Hollinwood, Greater Manchester|Hollinwood]] and [[Werneth, Greater Manchester|Werneth]] and provided enough coal to accelerate Oldham's rapid development at the centre of the cotton boom. At its height in the mid-19th century, when it was dominated by the Lees and Jones families, Oldham coal was mainly sourced from many small collieries whose lives varied from a few years to many decades, although two of the four largest collieries survived to [[National Coal Board|nationalisation]].<ref name="Coalfield" /><ref name="Oldham Coal">{{citation|title=British Mining No. 68&nbsp;<U+2013> Oldham Coal|publisher=Keighley: Northern Mine Research Society|last=Fanning|first=Gerry|year=2001|isbn=0-901450-54-5}}</ref> In 1851, collieries employed over 2,000 men in Oldham,<ref name="Oldham Coal" /> although the amount of coal in the town was somewhat overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry.<ref name="Coalfield" /> Today, the only visible remnants of the mines are disused shafts and boreholes.<ref name="Coalfield" />

=== Social history ===
[[File:MandK Industrial Revolution 1900.jpg|thumb|Workmen leaving [[Platt Brothers|Platt's Works]], Oldham, 1900]]
Oldham's [[social history]], like that of other former [[Parliamentary Franchise in the United Kingdom 1885-1918|unenfranchised]] towns, is marked by politicised [[civil disturbance]]s, as well as events related to the [[Luddite]], [[Suffragette]] and other [[Labour movement]]s from the [[working class]]es.<ref name="County of Lanc" /><ref name="Oldham Beyond" />  There has been a significant presence of "[[Friendly society|friendly societies]]".<ref name="Oldham 100" /><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.unionancestors.co.uk/AtoZ%20O.htm|publisher=unionancestors.co.uk|author=|date=|accessdate=30 October 2007|title=Trade Union Ancestors; A to Z of trade unions&nbsp;<U+2013> O}}</ref> It has been put that the people of Oldham became radical in politics in the early part of the 19th century, and movements suspected of [[sedition]] found patronage in the town.<ref name="County of Lanc" /> Oldham was frequently disturbed by bread and labour riots, facilitated by periods of scarcity and the disturbance of employment following the introduction of [[cotton-spinning machinery]].<ref name="County of Lanc" /> On 20 April 1812, a "large crowd of riotous individuals" compelled local retailers to sell foods at a loss, whilst on the same day [[Luddites]] numbering in their thousands, many of whom were from Oldham, attacked a cotton mill in nearby [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]].<ref name="Oldham Sketches" /> On 16 August 1819, Oldham sent a contingent estimated at well above 10,000 to hear speakers in St Peter's Fields at Manchester discuss political reform.{{sfn|McPhillips|1977|p=23}} It was the largest contingent sent to Manchester.<ref>{{citation|first=Joyce |last=Marlow |title=The Peterloo Massacre |publisher=Rapp & Whiting |year=1969 |isbn=0-85391-122-3|page=120}}</ref> John Lees, a cotton operative and ex-soldier who had fought at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], was one of the fifteen victims of the [[Peterloo Massacre]] which followed. The 'Oldham inquest' which proceeded the massacre was anxiously watched; the [[Court of King's Bench]], however, decided that the proceedings were irregular, and the jury were discharged without giving a verdict.<ref name="County of Lanc" />

[[Annie Kenney]], born in nearby [[Springhead, Greater Manchester|Springhead]], and who worked in Oldham's cotton mills, was a notable member of the [[Suffragette]] movement credited with sparking off suffragette militancy when she heckled [[Winston Churchill]], and later (with [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]) the first [[Suffragist]] to be imprisoned. Oldham Women's Suffrage Society was established in 1910 with Margery Lees as president and quickly joined the Manchester and District Federation of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]].<ref>{{citation|title=The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866<U+2013>1928|last=Crawford|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-23926-4|date=23 November 2000}}</ref> The [[Chartism|Chartist]] and [[History of the cooperative movement|Co-operative movements]] had strong support in the town, whilst many Oldhamers protested against the emancipation of [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]].<ref name="Oldham Beyond" /> The [[Riot Act]] was read in [[United Kingdom general election, 1852|1852 on election day]] following a mass public brawl over the [[Reform Act]],<ref name="OSD" /> and irregularities with parliamentary candidate nominations.<ref name="Oldham 100" />

For three days in late May 2001, Oldham became the centre of national and international media attention. Following high profile [[Racism|race-related]] conflicts, and long-term underlying racial tensions between local [[White British]] and [[British Asian|Asian]] communities, major riots broke out in the town. Occurring with particular intensity in the [[Glodwick]] area of the town, the [[Oldham riots]] were the worst racially motivated riots in the United Kingdom for fifteen years prior, briefly eclipsing the sectarian violence in [[Northern Ireland]] in the media.<ref name="Ritchie">{{citation|author=Ritchie, David|url=http://www.oldhamir.org.uk/OIR%20Report.pdf|title=The Ritchie Report|publisher=oldhamir.org.uk|format=PDF|date= 11 December 2001|accessdate=17 September 2007}}</ref> At least 20 people were injured in the riots, including 15 police officers, and 37 people were arrested.

Lying within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]] [[History of Lancashire|since the early 12th century]], Oldham was recorded in 1212 as being one of five parts of the [[thegn]]age estate of Kaskenmoor, which was held on behalf of [[John of England|King John]] by [[Roger de Montbegon]] and William de Nevill.<ref name="County of Lanc">{{citation|last=Brownbill|first=John|first2=William|last2= Farrer|title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 5|publisher=Victoria County History|year=1911|pages=92<U+2013>108|isbn=978-0-7129-1055-2}}</ref><ref name="Oldham 100" /> The other parts of this estate were [[Shaw and Crompton|Crompton]], [[Glodwick]], [[Sholver]], and [[Werneth, Greater Manchester|Werneth]].<ref name="Ballard" /> Oldham later formed a [[township (England)|township]] within the ancient ecclesiastical parish of [[Prestwich-cum-Oldham]], in the [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salford]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer" /><ref name="County of Lanc" />

In 1826 commissioners for the social and economic improvement of Oldham were established.<ref name="GM Gazetteer" /> The town was made part of a [[parliamentary borough]], in 1832, though it was in 1849 when Oldham was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]], giving it [[borough status in the United Kingdom]],<ref name="GM Gazetteer" /><ref name="Oldham 100" /> and in 1850 the Borough Council obtained the powers of the improvement commissioners.<ref name="GM Gazetteer" /> In 1880, parts of the [[Hollinwood, Greater Manchester|Hollinwood]] and [[Crossbank]] areas of [[Chadderton]] and [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] townships were added to the Borough of Oldham.<ref name="GM Gazetteer" /> [[Oldham Above Town]] and [[Oldham Below Town]] were, from 1851 until c.1881, statistical units used for the gathering and organising of [[civil registration]] information, and output of [[Census in the United Kingdom|census]] data.

The [[Local Government Act 1888]] created elected [[county council]]s to administer services throughout England and Wales. Where a municipal borough had a population of more than 50,000 at the 1881 [[Census in the United Kingdom|Census]] it was created a [[county borough]], with the powers and duties of both a borough and county council.<ref name="youngs">{{Citation |last=Youngs |first= Frederic A, Jr. |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol.2: Northern England |year=1991 |publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]] |pages=676<U+2013>686 |location=London |isbn=0-86193-127-0}}</ref> As Oldham had an 1881 population of 111,343 it duly became a county borough on 1 April 1889.

Provided that for all other purposes a county borough shall continue to be part of the county (if any) in which it is situate at the passing of this Act"''</ref>

In 1951 parts of the [[Limehurst Rural District]] were added to the County Borough of Oldham, and in 1954 further parts of the same district added to it on its abolition.<ref name="youngs" /> Since 1961, Oldham has been [[twin towns|twinned]] with [[Kranj]] in [[Slovenia]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.oldham.gov.uk/community/tourist_information.htm |title=Tourist Information in Oldham |publisher=oldham.gov.uk |accessdate=1 May 2007}}</ref> Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the town's autonomous [[County borough]] status was abolished, and Oldham has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]], within the [[Metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer" />

At {{coord|53|32|39|N|2|7|0.8|W|type:city}} (53.5444<U+00B0>, <U+2212>2.1169<U+00B0>), and {{convert|164|mi|km|0}} north-northwest of London, Oldham stands {{convert|700|ft|m|0}} above [[sea level]], {{convert|6.9|mi|km|1}} northeast of [[Manchester city centre]], on elevated ground between the rivers [[River Irk|Irk]] and [[River Medlock|Medlock]]. [[Saddleworth]] and the [[South Pennines]] are close to the east, whilst on all other sides, Oldham is bound by smaller towns, including [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Chadderton]], [[Failsworth]], [[Royton]] and [[Shaw and Crompton]], with little or no [[Green belt|green space]] between them. Oldham experiences a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year.<ref name="Oldham nature">{{citation|title=Oldham's natural history|last=Kidd|first=Leonard|year=1977|publisher=Oldham Libraries, Art Galleries and Museums|isbn=}}</ref>

Oldham's [[topography]] is characterised by its rugged, [[upland (geology)|elevated]] [[Pennine]] terrain.<ref name="Cotton Mills" /><ref name="Top of England">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1848|pp=729<U+2013>733}}.</ref> It has an area of {{convert|6.91|sqmi|km2|2}}.<ref name="Oldham Population" /> The [[geology]] of Oldham is represented by the [[Millstone Grit]] and [[Coal Measures]] series of rocks.<ref name="Oldham nature" /> The [[River Beal]], flowing northwards, forms the boundary between Oldham on one side and [[Royton]] and [[Shaw and Crompton]] on the other.

To the east of this river the surface rises to a height of {{convert|1225|ft|m|0}} at Woodward Hill, on the border with the parish of [[Saddleworth]].<ref name="County of Lanc" /> The rest of the surface is hilly, the average height decreasing towards the southwest to [[Failsworth]] and the city of [[Manchester]]. The ridge called Oldham Edge, {{convert|800|ft|m|0}} high, comes southward from Royton into the centre of the town.<ref name="County of Lanc" />

In 1849, Angus Reach of [[Inverness]] said: {{quote|The visitor to Oldham will find it essentially a mean-looking straggling town, built upon both sides and crowning the ridge of one of the outlying spurs which branch from Manchester, the neighbouring 'backbone of England'.

In the 1870s, [[John Marius Wilson]] described Oldham as consisting of:
{{quote|... numerous streets, and contains numerous fine buildings, both public and private; but, in a general view, is irregularly constructed, presents the dingy aspect of a crowded seat of manufacture, and is more notable for factories than for any other feature.<ref name="Vision of Oldham" />|John Marius Wilson|''[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] (1870<U+2013>1872)''}} Although Oldham had a thriving economy during the 19th century, the local merchants were broadly reluctant to spend on civic institutions, and so the town lacks the grandeur seen in comparable nearby towns like [[Bolton]] or [[Huddersfield]];<ref name="Oldham Heart" /><ref name="Rebrand" /> public expenditure was seen as an overhead that undermined the competitiveness of the town.<ref name="Oldham Beyond" /> Subsequently, Oldham's architecture has been described as "mediocre".<ref name="Rebrand" /> The town has no [[listed building]]s with a Grade I rating.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=GREATER%20MANCHESTER|title=Statistics by County|publisher=imagesofengland.org.uk|accessdate=22 December 2007}}</ref>

There is a mixture of high-density [[urban areas]], [[suburb]]s, semi-rural and [[rural]] locations in Oldham. There is some permanent [[grassland]] but overwhelmingly the [[land use]] in the town is urban.

During the 1950s and 1960s, in an attempt to fill the shortfall of workers and revitalise local industries, citizens of the wider [[Commonwealth of Nations]] were encouraged to [[Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)|migrate to Oldham and other British towns]].<ref name="Oldham People" /> Many came from the [[Caribbean]] and [[Indian subcontinent]] and settled throughout the Oldham borough.<ref name="Oldham People" />
