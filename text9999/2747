'''Master Byzantios''', sometimes simply '''Byzantios''' (fl. ca. 1175-1200) was a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] stone sculptor, working mainly on [[Gotland]] in present-day [[Sweden]].
==Life and works==
What little that is known about the master sculptor called Byzantios is all knowledge inferred from his works; no written sources exist about him. Even the name Master Byzantios is only a label, chosen in the 20th century by art historian [[Johnny Roosval]] and intended to highlight the sculptor's stylistic qualities as he was evidently influenced by [[Byzantine art]] (albeit probably only second-hand).<ref name="roosval">{{cite web |url= http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/637/1916_220.pdf?sequence=1|title= Byzantios eller en gotl<U+00E4>ndsk stenm<U+00E4>stare p<U+00E5> 1100-talet|language=Swedish|last1=Roosval|first1= Johnny|date= 1916|website= Swedish National Hertiage Board|language=Swedish|publisher= Journal of Swedish Antiquarian Research)|accessdate=July 21, 2013}}</ref><ref name="signum">{{cite book |last= Svanberg|first= Jan|authorlink= |language=Swedish|title= Signums svenska konsthistoria.

Master Byzantios was possibly from, or at the very least received his training in, north-eastern [[Italy]]. It was probably in that environment he acquired and developed his artistic style, which is heavily influenced by Byzantine art. Such influenced were strong in north-eastern Italian art at the time. He most probably worked on the building site of either [[Lund Cathedral]] or the [[Holy Cross Priory, Dalby]], or both.<ref name="signum"/> Other sources speculate that he may have recieved his training in [[Novgorod]], where merchants from Gotland were active.<ref name="guteinfo">{{cite web |url= http://www.guteinfo.com/?id=2222|title= Gotl<U+00E4>ndska stenm<U+00E4>stare, skulptur, Gotland|language=Swedish|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= guteinfo.com|accessdate=July 21, 2013}}</ref> Eventually he moved to Gotland and was active there as a sculptor of [[baptismal font]]s and architectural details on church building sites at a time when church building was very active on the island.<ref name="signum"/>

Eleven baptismal fonts has been ascribed to him or his workshop, as well as four bases of fonts whose upper parts have been lost. All are located on Gotland, notable examples can be found in [[Atlingbo church|Atlingbo]], [[Garde church|Garde]], [[Vamlingbo church|Vamlingbo]], [[M<U+00E4>sterby church|M<U+00E4>sterby]]<ref name="svuppb">{{cite web |url= http://svenskuppslagsbok.se/tag/byzantios/|title= M<U+00E4>sterby|language=Swedish|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= Svensk uppslagsbok (1955)|accessdate=July 21, 2013}}</ref> and [[K<U+00E4>llunge church|K<U+00E4>llunge]] churches.<ref name="guteinfo"/><ref name="signum"/> A [[frieze]] at [[V<U+00E4>nge church|V<U+00E4>nge]] church is also attributed to Master Byzantios.<ref name="signum"/>

Master Byzantios was the first of a series of stone sculptors working on Gotland during the Romanesque period of Scandinavian art history. Several others would eventually follow in his footsteps, e.g. [[Master Majestatis]], [[Hegvald]] and [[Master Sigraf]]. His style is easily recongisable in comparison. The basins of his fonts are always [[octagonal]] (as opposed to other masters' circular basins), and his imagery is clearly influenced by Byzantine art in a rather unique way, e.g. through his treatment of the subject of the [[Annunciation]]. Here he depicts [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] spinning yarn for the veil at the temple, a typically Byzantine way of representing the scene. In addition, anmials and [[legendary creature]]s (including the first depictions of both [[elephant]]s and [[camel]]s in in Swedish art history) are also popular subjects. Master Byzantios was furthermore the first artist in the [[Nordic countries]] who portrayed human beings in a reasonably correct anatomical way. The pictures on either of the eight sides of the fonts seems to have been executed without any particular connection, although an overarching theme is the conflict between good and evil. Two of the fonts attributed to him, at Garde and [[Hejde church|Hejde]] churches, retain traces of original paint.<ref name="signum"/>
