"'''Butterflies'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Michael Jackson]]. It was written by [[Marsha Ambrosius]] and [[Andre Harris]], and produced by Jackson and Harris. The track appears on Jackson's tenth, and final, studio album, ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' (2001). "Butterflies" is a [[tempo|midtempo]] ballad song with [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] musical styles. The single received generally mixed reviews from music critics; some music reviewers described the song as being one of the best song's on ''Invincible'' while others felt that it was a "decent track".

The song was released as the second single from ''Invincible'' in the United States only in October 2001, by [[Epic Records]]. The track had a good chart performance in the United States, peaking at number fourteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and also charting at number two and thirty-six, respectively, on alternative ''Billboard'' charts in 2001 and 2002. "Butterflies" was not  promoted by a music video.

== Background and development ==
"Butterflies" was recorded by [[Michael Jackson]] in 2001 for his tenth, and final, studio album, ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'', which was released the same year.<ref name="linernotes">''Invincible'' liner notes [[Epic Records]] (2001)</ref> The song was written by Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is one half of the London bred [[neo-soul]] act Floetry,<ref name="yahoomusic"/> and was produced by Jackson and Harris.<ref name="linernotes"/> Jackson had first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who is also a member of Floetry, through John McClain, who is [[DreamWorks]]'s senior urban executive and Jackson's manager.<ref name="yahoomusic"/> Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track.<ref name="yahoomusic"/> She recalled in an interview with [[LAUNCH Media|''LAUNCH'' magazine]], "It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? What do you think? Is this what you were looking for? He was so open".<ref name="yahoomusic"/>

When Ambrosius first met Jackson, it took a few minutes to calm down.<ref name="yahoomusic"/> She recalled to the same publication Stewart was interviewed by, "To begin with, I was kinda shook. Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that kind of situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend."<ref name="yahoomusic"/> Harris commented on the single, "He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did '[[Billie Jean]]' and '[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock With You]]' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines."<ref name="theatlanitcjournal">{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F0F007E21514E96&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=With a new album, a popular single, and in demand as a hot commodity on television, Michael Jackson proves he's still . . .
