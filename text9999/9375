==Plot==
Max, Pop, Jen and Jake are deer hunting out of season.  Earlier, a hiker had found an ancient book of spells and after reading a few lines had turned into a demon.  Hearing noise in the brush, the group thinks thay have found a deer, only to discover it is the transformed hiker.  Fearful, the groups shoots up the demon and takes refuge in a nearby cabin. As more and more zombie-fied creatures attack the group, they use every implement available to defend themselves.

==Critical reception==
''[[DVD Talk]]'' made note that being written, directed, and produced by Frank Sudol, the film "is quite literally a one-man show."  They wrote that as a "crudely animated tale" from an individual otherwise known for his work as an artist on ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut]]'', the film "is a very interesting curiosity."  They also note Sudol [[multi-task]]ing as animator, musician, and the [[Voice artist|vocal artist]] for all the characters.  Noting that ''Dead Fury'' is not sucessful as a [[feature-length]] film, they praise Sudol by writing "kudos to Sudol for sticking to his vision and making it."  They also shared that in his commentrary track, Sudol spoke toward a number of films that inspired the creation of ''Dead Fury'', including ''[[Friday the 13th (film)|Friday the 13th]]'', but that the film was " clearly a homage to ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes]]''". They also noted that while the film has a great deal of gore, "its gore and over-the-top violence are played for laughs primarily." They wrote that there was much to admire in the film, but that the action became repetitive. They conclude that fans of "gory horror films would probably find Dead Fury entertaining", and that it's "creative enough for other movie fans to add it to their rental lists." But summarized that the film would have been better as a 25-minute short.<ref name="DVD Talk">{{cite web

''[[Film Threat]]'' panned the film, finding it to be "shamelessly cartoonish" in a maner that would leave horror fans "speechless at this audience-insulting wreck". They granted that "Those who treat ''[[Fangoria]]'' as a pinup mag will smile at the demonic/punk zombies" as conceived by Frank Sudol," but that those same fans "will scratch their heads when seeing the zombie curse float as a ball of light, like [[Tinkerbell]]." They noted that the characters were "flat and move like cardboard across the screen," and felt that while some filmmakers were innovatotors in their field, they "should never be an inspiration".<ref name="Film Threat">{{cite web

''Movie Cynics'' praised Frank Sudol for his work on ''[[City of Rott]]'' acting as "a testament to what one man can do with a shitload of time and some skill at animating," but noted that ''Dead Fury'' while interesting, was less successful. They noted its paying homage not only to [[zombie film|zombie movies]] but also to "every backwoods [[demonic possession]] story that you<U+2019>ve ever seen", and how it could compare to ''[[Evil Dead]]'' if such were to be done by [[Adult Swim]]. They further expanded that its length was a major flaw in that the film "falls apart after the first 45 minutes," and that it would have been better if shorter.  They also note that while its "characters are interesting, humorous, and fairly likable," the writing becomes "boring and repetitive."<ref name="Movie Cynics">{{cite web

''[[Philadelphia City Paper]]'' referred to the film's length as "excruciating" and made note that the film's flaws included production values that "would barely pass muster on YouTube", a story concept that seemed "borrowed ideas seemingly made in an afternoon in between Xbox games", and juvenile humor "penned at a sixth-grade reading level."<ref name="Philadelphia City Paper">{{cite news

Conversely, ''[[Dread Central]]'' found no flaws. The reviewer made note that the film was from the same individual who created ''[[City of Rott]]'', and that he was initially worried that ''Dead Fury'' might not favorable compare to the earlier film.  After veiwing, he was able to state it "not only remains on top of its game, but it outdoes ''City of Rott'' at every turn!"  The reviwer also noted that the film was was not a sequel, but was instead an original story that "takes its cues from horror favorites ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes]]''," acting as an homage and "absolute love letter to the films that it borrows from."  The reviewer praised Frank Sudol as "a crazed one-man army of mad animated genius," writing that he "has delivered one of the single most carnage happy, no-holds-barred, mayhem filled, freak shows that I've had the pleasure of sitting through."  He also praised the dialog and delivery as hilarious, writing of it "This is one of those things that's better left to speak for itself. No description I give can do it justice."  Speaking highly toward the DVD extras including an audio commentary by Sudol, the reviewer wrote it was "just as funny as the movie itself," and concluded by writing "''Dead Fury'' is without question the ultimate experience in grueling animated horror."<ref name="Dread Central1">{{cite web

''Fatally Yours'' noted that filmmaker Frank Sudol brought back his character of "Pop" from ''[[City of Rott]]'' for this film, but not in a lead role, nor the film as a sequel. They referred to ''Dead Fury'' as a "leaner, meaner movie" when compared to the earlier film, and that it has lots of gore and humor in a plot that is  "tighter and a lot more focused."  They praised the filmmaker for "bringing such a colorful and energetic movie to the screen," and for his work in every aspect of its production. They granted that while the animation style might not appeal to everyone, the film "had its own unique charm" in its hilarity.<ref name="Fatally Yours">{{cite web
