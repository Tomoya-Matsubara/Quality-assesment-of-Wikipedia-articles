'''Lisa Marie Simpson'''<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa's Wedding|episodelink=Lisa's Wedding|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Daniels, Greg; [[Jim Reardon|Reardon, Jim]]|network=Fox |airdate=1995-03-19 |season=06|number=19}}</ref> is a fictional main character in the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. She is the middle child of the [[Simpson family]]. Voiced by [[Yeardley Smith]], Lisa first appeared on television in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] created and designed her while waiting to meet [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic ''[[Life in Hell]]'', but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the elder Simpson daughter after his younger sister Lisa Groening. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three years, the Simpson family were moved to their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted on December 17, 1989.

At eight years old, Lisa is the second child of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], younger sister of [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and older sister of [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. She is highly intelligent and plays the [[baritone saxophone]]. She has been a vegetarian since [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season 7]], converted to [[Buddhism]] in [[The Simpsons (season 13)|season 13]] and advocates for a variety of political causes, including the [[Tibetan independence movement]]. She has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''&nbsp;<U+2013> including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials and comic books&nbsp;<U+2013> and inspired a line of merchandise.

Yeardley Smith originally tried out for the role of Bart, while [[Nancy Cartwright]] (who was later cast as the voice for Bart) tried out for Lisa. Producers considered Smith's voice too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. In the ''Tracey Ullman Show'' shorts, Lisa was something of a "female Bart" who mirrored her brother's mischief, but as the series progressed she became a more sophisticated and intellectual character. Because of her unusual pointed hair style, many animators consider Lisa the most difficult ''Simpsons'' character to draw.

Lisa is one of the most enduring characters on the series. ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked her eleventh (tied with Bart) on their list of the "Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time". Her environmentalism has been especially well received; several episodes featuring her have won [[Genesis Awards|Genesis]] and [[Environmental Media Awards]], including a special "Board of Directors Ongoing Commitment Award" in 2001. [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] included Lisa on their list of the "Most Animal-Friendly TV Characters of All Time". Yeardley Smith won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992, and in 2000 Lisa and her family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Character==

===Creation===
[[Matt Groening]] first conceived Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family in [[1986 in film|1986]] in the lobby of producer [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' and had intended to present an adaptation of his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strip. When he realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening went in another direction,<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|year=2000|title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> hurriedly sketching his version of a [[dysfunctional family]], named after members of his own family. Lisa was named after Groening's younger sister, but little else was based on her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003818762_realsimpsons030.html|title=The real people behind Homer Simpson and family|author=Rose, Joseph|date=2007-08-03|work=[[The Oregonian]]}}</ref> In ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' shorts, Lisa displayed little of the intelligence for which she later became known. She was more of a "female Bart"<ref name=MirkinBSNTH/> and was originally described as simply the "middle child", without much personality.<ref name=Carty/>

Lisa made her debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987 in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Richmond|1997|p=14}}</ref> In 1989, the shorts were adapted into ''The Simpsons'', a half-hour series on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. Lisa and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/>

Commentary for "[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> Lisa's physical features are generally unique.

To draw Lisa's head and hair, most of the show's animators use what they call the "three-three-two arrangement". It begins with a circle, with two curving lines (one vertical, one horizontal) intersecting in the middle to indicate her eyeline. The vertical line continues outside of the circle to create one hair point, with two more added towards the back of her head. Three more points are then added in front (in the direction Lisa is facing), with two more behind it.<ref>Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark. (2005).

Smith and the show's writers worked to give Lisa a more defined personality, and she has developed greatly during the series. In her 2000 memoir ''[[My Life as a Ten-Year-Old Boy]]'', Cartwright wrote: "with the brilliant wit of the writers and the wry, in-your-eye, honest-to-a-fault interpretation, Yeardley Smith has made Lisa a bright light of leadership, full of compassion and competence beyond her years. Lisa Simpson is the kind of child we not only want our children to be, but also the kind of child we want ''all'' children to be. But, at the time, on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', she was just an animated eight-year-old kid who had no personality."<ref name=Carty/>

Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, who increases the pitch of her voice slightly for the role.<ref>{{cite news|title=She who laughs last|date=2007-12-08|page=8E|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Charles Miranda}}</ref> In some earlier episodes she provided some of Maggie's squeaks and occasional speaking parts, and has voiced other characters on very rare occasions.<ref name=com>{{cite video | people=Smith, Yeardley|year=2007|title=Audio commentary for [[The Simpsons Movie]]| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Usually they are derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in "[[Last Tap Dance in Springfield]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 11)|season 11]], 2000) and Lisa, Jr. in "[[Missionary: Impossible]]".

Commentary for "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature, such as "Moaning Lisa" (season one, 1990). The idea for the episode was pitched by [[James L.

In the seventh-season episode "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]" (1995), Lisa permanently becomes a vegetarian, distinguishing her as one of the first primetime television characters to make such a choice.<ref name="PETA"/> The episode was written by David S. Cohen (in his first solo writing credit) who jotted down the idea one day while eating lunch. Then-executive producer [[David Mirkin]], who had recently become a vegetarian, quickly approved the idea. Several of Lisa's experiences in the episode are based on Mirkin's own experiences. The episode guest stars musician [[Paul McCartney]], a committed vegetarian and [[animal rights]] activist. McCartney's condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series and would not revert back the next week (as is common on situation comedies). The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show.<ref>Cohen, David S.; Groening, Matt; Mirkin, David. (2005).

Lisa plays the [[baritone saxophone]], and some episodes use that as a plot device. According to Matt Groening, the baritone saxophone was chosen because he found the thought of an eight-year-old girl playing it amusing. He added, "But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show."<ref name="Saxophone"/> One of the hallmarks of the show's [[The Simpsons opening sequence|opening sequence]] is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class. ''The Simpsons'' composer [[Alf Clausen]] said that the session musicians who perform her solos do not try to play at the second grade level and instead "think of Lisa as a really good player."<ref name="Sax and Single">{{Cite web|title=Sax and the Single Simpson|last =Rhodes | first = Joe|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=1991-07-26|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,314958,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-08}}</ref>

Lisa is highly intelligent and sees herself as a misfit within the Simpson family due to her knowledge. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways.<ref name=p78/> Lisa's knowledge covers a wide range of subjects, from astronomy to medicine, and she is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eat my lab coat|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2003/oct/30/research.highereducation2|work=The Guardian |date=2003-10-30|accessdate=2010-03-19|author=Gross, Michael | location=London}}</ref> Although her rebellion against social norms is usually depicted as constructive and heroic, Lisa can be self-righteous at times.<ref>{{harvnb|Pinsky|2001|p=46}}</ref> In "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]", an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father's roast-pig [[barbecue]], an act for which she later apologizes.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Vegetarian|episodelink=Lisa the Vegetarian|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David X.; Kirkland, Mark|network=Fox |airdate=1995-10-15 |season=07|number=05}}</ref> Episodes often take shots at Lisa's idealism.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2004|p=229}}</ref> In "[[Bart Star]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine]], 1997) Lisa, apparently looking for a new cause to crusade over,<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2004|p=230}}</ref> defiantly declares that she, a girl, would like to join the football team. When coach [[Ned Flanders]] reveals that several girls already play for the team, she hesitates and claims football is "not really [her] thing". She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig's skin, but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to [[Amnesty International]]. Visibly upset, Lisa runs off.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bart Star|episodelink=Bart Star|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David X.; Kirkland, Mark|network=Fox |airdate=1997-11-09 |season=09|number=06}}</ref>

Although she is intellectually gifted, Lisa experiences typical childhood issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention.<ref name="Turner203"/> For example, in "[[Lost Our Lisa]]" (season nine, 1998), she tricks Homer into allowing her to ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost and in need of aid from her father.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lost Our Lisa|episodelink=Lost Our Lisa|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Brian Scully|Scully, Briann]]; Michels, Pete|network=Fox |airdate=1998-05-10 |season=09|number=24}}</ref> Chris Turner writes in ''Planet Simpson'' that incidents like this illustrate that "Even when Lisa's lecturing like a college professor or mounting yet another protest, she never becomes a full-grown adult trapped in a kid's body."<ref name="Turner203">{{harvnb|Turner|2004|p=203}}</ref> In ''[[The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer]]'', Aeon J. Skoble states that although Lisa is an intellectual, she is still portrayed as a character who enjoys normal childhood and girl activities, plays with Malibu Stacy dolls, loves ponies, obsesses over teenage heartthrobs such as [[Brother From the Same Planet|Corey]], and watches ''[[The Itchy and Scratchy Show]]''. He writes, "One might argue that this is typical childhood behavior, but since in so many cases Lisa is presented not simply as a prodigy but as preternaturally wise, the fondness for ''Itchy and Scratchy'' and Corey seem to be highlighted, taking on greater significance. Lisa is portrayed as the avatar of logic and wisdom, but then she also worships Corey so she's 'no better [than the rest of us]'."<ref>{{harvnb|Skoble|1999|pp=31<U+2013>32}}</ref>

Lisa occasionally worries that her family's dull habits will rub off on her, such as in "[[Lisa the Simpson]]" (season nine, 1998) she worries that the "Simpson [[Genetics|gene]]" will make her less intelligent later finding out the gene only goes through the male side.<ref>{{cite news|title=Men on TV: Dumb as Posts And Proud of It|date=2000-04-09|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/arts/men-on-tv-dumb-as-posts-and-proud-of-it.html?pagewanted=3|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2010-03-08|author=Gates, Anita}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Simpson|episodelink=Lisa the Simpson|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Ned Goldreyer|Goldreyer, Ned]]; Dietter, Susie|network=Fox |airdate=1998-03-08 |season=09|number=17}}</ref> She is often embarrassed and disapproving of her eccentric family: of her father's poor parenting skills and buffoonish personality; her mother's stereotypical image and social ineptitude; and her brother's delinquent and low-brow nature. She is also concerned that Maggie may grow up to be like the rest of the family and tries to teach her complex ideas. Chris Turner writes in ''Planet Simpson'' that "Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit [...] but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in: her family. It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability, meaning, contentment."<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2004|p=233}}</ref> Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward "[[Lisa's Wedding]]" (season six, 1995), in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fianc<U+00E9>.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa's Wedding|episodelink=Lisa's Wedding|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Greg Daniels|Daniels, Greg]]; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1995-03-19 |season=06|number=19}}</ref> In the episode "[[Mother Simpson]]" (season seven, 1995) she meets her paternal grandmother [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona Simpson]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Mother Simpson|episodelink=Mother Simpson|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Rich Appel|Appel, Rich]]; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=1995-11-19 |season=07|number=08}}</ref> Mona is also well-read and articulate, and the writers used the character as a way to explain the origins of Lisa's intelligence.<ref>Appel, Rich.

===Cultural influence===
Jonathan Gray, author of the book ''Watching The Simpsons'', feels that Lisa "is probably the best and certainly longest-running feminist character that television has had. She's the heart of the show and she quite often questions the gender politics" but only her own.<ref>{{harvnb|Ortved|2009|p=86}}</ref> Christopher Borrelli of ''[[The Blade (newspaper)|The Toledo Blade]]'' wrote, "Has there ever been a female TV character as complex, intelligent, and, ahem, as emotionally well-drawn as Lisa Simpson? Meet her once and she comes off priggish and one-note&nbsp;<U+2013> a know-it-all. Get to know her and Lisa is as well-rounded as anyone you may ever meet in the real world."<ref>{{Cite news|title=She's not even real and she's a feminist role model liberated Lisa |work=[[The Blade (newspaper)|The Toledo Blade]]|author=Borrelli, Christopher|date=2001-03-11}}</ref>

According to PETA, Lisa was one of the first vegetarian characters on primetime television. In 2004 the organization included Lisa on its list of the "Most Animal-Friendly TV Characters of All Time".<ref name="PETA">{{cite news|url=http://www.peta.org/mc/NewsItem.asp?id=4375|title=Friends' Phoebe tops PETA's list of most animal-friendly TV characters of all time|accessdate=2008-10-27|date=2004-05-04|publisher=[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 2008, environmentalist website The Daily Green honored Lisa's role in ''The Simpsons Movie'' with one of its inaugural "Heart of Green" awards, which "recognize those who have helped green go mainstream." They wrote "young Lisa Simpson has inspired a generation to wear their hearts on their sleeves and get educated, and involved, about global issues, from justice to feminism and the environment."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Daily Green's Heart of Green Awards 2008|url=http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/heart-of-green-47032710|publisher=The Daily Green|accessdate=2010-03-13|year=2008}}</ref> Japanese broadcasters reversed viewer dislike of the series by focusing marketing of the show on Lisa. Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and community struck a chord with Japanese audiences.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2004|p=327}}</ref> Mario D'Amato, a specialist in Buddhist studies at [[Rollins College]] in Florida, described Lisa as "open-minded, reflective, ethical, and interested in improving herself in various ways, while still preserving a child-like sense of innocence. These are all excellent qualities, ones which are espoused by many Buddhist traditions."<ref>{{harvnb|Pinsky|2007|p=180}}</ref>

Lisa and the rest of the Simpsons have had a significant influence on English-language [[idiom]]s. The dismissive term "Meh", used by Lisa and popularized by the show,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/mar/05/newmedia.broadcasting|title=Meh&nbsp;<U+2014> the word that's sweeping the internet|accessdate=2007-10-14|date=2007-03-05|work=The Guardian |author=Michael Hann | location=London}}</ref> entered the ''[[HarperCollins|Collins English Dictionary]]'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=f216bac2-8f0b-4202-a1ae-8f7ed4de2bd7|title=Canadian politics: The definition of 'meh'|accessdate=2008-11-21|date=2008-11-18|publisher=Canwest News Service|work=Vancouver Sun |author=Boswell, Randy}}</ref> In 1996, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article saying that Lisa was inspiring children, especially young girls, to learn to play the saxophone.<ref name="Saxophone">{{cite news|title=A Sax Craze, Inspired by 'The Simpsons'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/weekinreview/january-7-13-a-sax-craze-inspired-by-the-simpsons.html|work=The New York Times|date=1996-01-14|accessdate=2010-03-12|author=Barron, James}}</ref>
