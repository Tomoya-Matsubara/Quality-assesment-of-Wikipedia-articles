'''''Cryptothecia rubrocincta''''' is a species of [[lichen]] in the [[Arthoniaceae]] family of [[fungus|fungi]]. The species is distributed in [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] locations throughout the southeastern United States, as well as Central and South America, and has been collected infrequently in a few locales in Africa. The body of the lichen forms continuous, circular crust-like patches on dead wood, readily recognizable by the prominent red [[pigment]]. The older, central region is covered with red, spherical to cylindrical granules. Moving outwards from the center, zones of color may be distinguished, the first gray-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim. The red and green colors of this unmistakable woodland lichen give the appearance of a Christmas wreath, suggestive of its [[common name|common]] North American name, the '''Christmas wreath lichen'''. The red pigment, called chiodectonic acid, is one of several chemicals the lichen produces to help tolerate inhospitable growing conditions.

== Taxonomy and naming ==
[[image:Ehrenberg Christian Gottfried 1795-1876.png|thumb|left|German naturalist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg first described the lichen in 1820.]]
The [[biological classification|classification]] of the genus ''Cryptothecia'' has been unclear, and historically, ''C.&nbsp;rubrocincta'' has been placed in several different [[genera]]. Like all lichens, ''C.&nbsp;rubrocincta'' is an association of a fungus (the mycobiont) with a [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organism (the photobiont), in this case, an [[algae]]. Initially, it was unknown whether the mycobiont component of ''C.&nbsp;rubrocincta'' was an [[Ascomycota|ascomycete]] or a [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycete]]. Although the vast majority of lichen mycobionts are from the Ascomycota, in 1937 German lichenogist [[Friedrich Tobler]] believed the mycobiont to be a basidiomycete, because he interpreted some unusual microscopic structures to be [[clamp connection]]s,<ref name=Tobler1937a/> structures associated only with the basidiomycete fungi. In another publication later that year, he specified the mycobiont to be a [[hymenomycete]], and described the [[monotypic]] genus ''Herpothallion'' to supersede the old name ''Chiodecton sanguineum''.<ref name=Tobler1937b/> Although [[Vernon Ahmadjian]] corroborated the presence of clamp connections in the species when he studied the species' [[cytology]] in 1967,<ref name=Ahmadjian1967/> other researchers did not find clamp connections in specimens collected from different countries.<ref name=Follman1968/><ref name=Ellis1975/> Further doubt was cast on the possibility of a basidiomycete mycobiont with the discovery of the [[depside]] confluentic acid in 1966,<ref name=Culberson1966/> concentric bodies in 1975,<ref name=Ellis1975/> and [[woronin bodies]] in 1983,<ref name=Withrow1983/> as all of these characteristics are restricted to Ascomycetes.

The [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] states that names of fungi adopted by [[Elias Magnus Fries|Fries]] in Systema Mycologicum vols. 1<U+2013>3 are sanctioned, that is, they are conserved against earlier homonyms and competing [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]]. This means that the name ''Hypochnus rubrocinctum'' has priority over ''Byssus sanguinea''. The [[type (biology)|type]] material of ''H.&nbsp;rubrocinctum'' was examined by [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] in Berlin; it has since been destroyed, probably during the Second World War. The drawing in Erhenberg's 1820 publication serves as the [[lectotype]]. The species was transferred to the genus ''[[Cryptothecia]]'' by Swedish lichenologist G<U+00F6>ran Thor in 1991, on the basis of its similarity with ''C.&nbsp;striata'' such as the thallus with radiate ridges, granular [[isidia]], and presence of ''para''-[[depside]]s (gyrophoric acid in ''C.&nbsp;striata'' and confluentic acid in ''C.&nbsp;rubrocincta'').<ref name=Thor1991/>

The red and green of ''C.&nbsp;rubrocincta''  give it a Christmas wreath look, hence its [[common name|common]] North American name, the Christmas wreath lichen.<ref name=Volk2006/> The [[specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''ruber'' "red" and ''cinctus'' "girdled/encircled" or "banded". The other epithet ''sanguineum'' is the neuter form of the Latin adjective ''sanguineus'' "bloody".<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref><!-- 2 prev sentences covered  -->

== Description ==
{{Double image stack|left|Cryptothecia rubrocincta.jpg|Cryptothecia rubrocincta-3.jpg|200|[[Herbarium]] specimens of ''C.&nbsp;rubrocincta'' growing on ''[[Taxodium distichum]]'' (above) and oak (below). The scale marks are millimeters.}}
''Cryptothecia rubrocincta'' is a crustose lichen, because it grows in the form of a surface crust. The thallus, or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely attached to the growing surface. It is 0.15<U+2013>0.30&nbsp;mm thick, and can be smooth, or have low radiating ridges. The older, central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called [[isidia]]; they resemble granules that are 0.1<U+2013>0.4 by 0.1&nbsp;mm. The species relies entirely on [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures.<ref name=Thor1991/> From the center outwards, three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim.<ref name=Edwards2005/>

The lichen has a distinct prothallus<U+2014>fibers of whitish fungal [[hypha]]e at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus does not have a well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many [[calcium oxalate]] crystals that are 3<U+2013>8&nbsp;<U+03BC>m diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1<U+2013>2&nbsp;<U+03BC>m in diameter.<ref name=Edwards2005/> The [[alga]]l photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus ''[[Trentepohlia]]''. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large [[chloroplast]] that contains droplets of [[beta-carotene]].<ref name=Withrow1983/> The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8<U+2013>15 by 5<U+2013>11&nbsp;<U+03BC>m.<ref name=Edwards2005/>

The yeast ''Fellomyces mexicanus'', an [[anamorphic]] member of the [[Cuniculitremaceae]] family, was discovered growing [[epiphyte|epiphytically]] on the lichen in 2005.<ref name=Lopandic2005/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[image:Cryptothecia rubrocincta.dollinger.jpg|thumb|right|Growing on ''[[Sabal palmetto]]'' at [[Myakka River State Park]], [[Florida]]]]
The lichen is widely distributed in the southeastern United States; in 1954 the north border of its distribution was given as a line passing through southern [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]].<ref name=Tomaselli1954/> Although the northern limit was extended to southern [[Delaware]],<ref name=Brodo1968/> the author later revised his opinion, and the northern limit is thought to be [[North Carolina]].<ref name=Brodo1994/> In North Carolina, it is found on Smith Island, a notable location because it represents the northern limit of the distribution of [[cabbage palmetto]] (''Sabal palmetto''). The presence of this 6&nbsp;meter (20&nbsp;ft) tree interspersed among the dominant tree species ''[[Quercus virginiana]]'' give the island a [[subtropical]] appearance<U+2014>consistent with the lichen's preferred climate.<ref name=Culberson1964/>

''Cryptothecia rubrocincta'' is also widespread in [[tropical]] and subtropical areas of the [[West Indies]] and Central and South America.<ref name=Osorio1997/><ref name=Piepenbring2007/> In South America in is found north of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].<ref name=Tomaselli1954/><ref name=Tomaselli1950/> It is rarer in Africa, having only been collected from three geographically widely separated mountain regions: [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Zaire]]. The lichen may be found at altitudes ranging from [[sea level]] to {{convert|2600|m|ft}} (in [[Colombia]]).<ref name=Thor1991/>

The lichen typically grows on rough bark in sheltered and shaded habitats in moist and dense subtropical forests. More rarely, it is found on rocks or on leaves. In the USA it occurs in [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]] (hardwood forests) and swamps which have standing water, at least part of the year. It is also common in oak or oak-pine scrub vegetation. The species is often associated with ''[[Cryptothecia striata]]'' in the USA.<ref name=Thor1991/>

== Chemistry ==

''Cryptothecia rubrocincta'' is easily recognized by the bright red [[pigment]] in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904,<ref name=Hesse1904/> is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless [[depside]] compound confluentinic acid.<ref name=Culberson1966/> A 2005 study employed the technique [[Raman spectroscopy]] to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains [[calcium oxalate]] dihydrate, or [[weddellite]], a chemical substance found in other lichens and [[extremophile]]s growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some have suggested that the calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores.<ref name=Seaward1997/> Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, [[bird droppings]], and airborne particles.<ref name=Edwards2005/>

The chemicals in the red-colored zone include an aromatic [[quinone]], [[beta-carotene]], and [[chlorophyll]]. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought to function as a radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular [[DNA repair]] following exposure of the organism to [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential for survival.<ref name=Edwards2005/>

The lighter-colored pink zone, located on the inside of the red zone, contains a mixture of chiodectonic acid, beta-carotene and calcium oxalate dihydrate, the red and white mixture of the chiodectonic acid and the calcium oxalate giving rise to the characteristically lighter color.<ref name=Edwards2005/>

The elliptical brown-colored flecks, which can be observed in both the red and pink zones of the thallus, are made of confluentic acid and calcium oxalate monohydrate. The monohydrate is thought to be a more chemically stable metabolic byproduct of calcium oxalate dihydrate; the function of confluentic acid in the brown flecks is unclear.<ref name=Edwards2005/>
