'''Tony Mundine''' (born Anthony William Mundine, [[June 10]], [[1951]], [[Baryulgil]], [[New South Wales]]) is one of [[Australia]]'s [[boxing]] legends and one the greatest [[Australian Aborigine|Indigenous]] fighters. He held the [[Australian]] [[middleweight]], [[light heavyweight]], [[cruiserweight]] and [[heavyweight]] titles and [[Commonwealth]] middleweight and Light heavyweight titles and is the only Australian boxer to compete in four weight divisions. He fought [[Carlos Monzon]] on 5th October, 1974 for the World middleweight title but lost by a [[Knockout]] in the 7th round. No Australian boxer ever beat him in his 16 year career.   

He played centre three-quarter for a [[Grafton]] [[Rugby League]] team, and showed promise and offered a place with the [[Redfern]] 'All Blacks' in the South Sydney Jurnior Rugby League in 1968 when he was 17. With the desire to keep fit he began visiting Ern McQuillan's gym in [[Newtown]] where his natural ability and speed showed on the punching bag. McQuillan seen within him a promise of something better to come with expert tuition and so a fighter-trainer contract began with Ern.

He currently lives in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] where he manages a training gym adjacent to [[The Block (Sydney)|The Block]] and is the [[father]] and [[boxing]] [[trainer]]/[[promoter]] of [[Anthony Mundine]], guiding him to the world title bouts he himself had aspired to. 

He was the winner of ''The Ella Award for Lifetime Achievement in [[Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] Sport'' at [[The Deadlys]] in [[2004]].
