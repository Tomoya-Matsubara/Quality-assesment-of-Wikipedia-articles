'''Otto Everett Graham, Jr.''' (December 6, 1921 &ndash; December 17, 2003) was an [[American football]] quarterback who played for the [[Cleveland Browns]] in the [[All-America Football Conference]] and [[National Football League]]. Graham is remembered as one of the most dominant players of his era, having taken the Browns to league championship games every year between 1946 and 1955, winning seven of them. While most of Graham's statistical records have been surpassed in the modern era, he still holds the NFL record for career average yards per pass attempt, with nine. With Graham under center, the Browns posted a record of 114<U+2013>20<U+2013>4, including a 9<U+2013>3 mark in the playoffs. Long-time [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]], a friend of Graham's, once called him "as great of a quarterback as there ever was."<ref name="Graham obit" />

Graham grew up in [[Waukegan, Illinois]], the son of music teachers. He entered [[Northwestern University]] in 1940 on a basketball scholarship, but football soon became his main sport. After a brief stint in the military at the end of [[World War II]], Graham played during the 1946 season for the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League's]] [[Sacramento Kings|Rochester Royals]], who won the league championship that year. [[Paul Brown]], Cleveland's coach, signed "Automatic Otto" to play for the Browns, where he thrived. After he left football in 1955, Graham coached college teams in the [[College All-Star Game]] and became head football coach at the [[Coast Guard Academy]] in [[Connecticut]]. After seven years at the academy, he spent three unsuccessful seasons as head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]]. Following his resignation, he returned to the Coast Guard Academy, where he served as athletic director until his retirement in 1984. He was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1965.

==Early life and college career==

Born in [[Waukegan, Illinois]], Graham's first interest growing up was music.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=19}} Encouraged by his parents, both of whom were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, [[cornet]] and [[French horn]].{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=79}}{{sfn|Boyer|2006|p=12}} Graham also excelled in athletics, and went to [[Northwestern University]] on a basketball scholarship. There he played on the varsity team as a freshman and continued to study music.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} Graham did not take up football until his sophomore year, when Northwestern coach [[Pappy Waldorf]] saw him throwing in an intramural fraternity game and invited him to practice with the team.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to sign up.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} While football became Graham's primary sport, he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team. He was a first-tem All-American in basketball as a senior.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=79}}

Graham's first game for the [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Wildcats football team]] was on October 4, 1941, when he ran back a [[Kansas State University|Kansas State]] punt 94 yards for a touchdown and had two more scores in a 51<U+2013>3 rout.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} After scoring another pair of touchdowns in a win against [[University of Wisconsin-Madison|Wisconsin]], Graham threw for two touchdowns in an upset of an [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] team coached by [[Paul Brown]], handing the school its only loss of the 1941 season.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} Northwestern ended the year with a 11th-place showing in the [[AP Poll]] of the best college teams in the country.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}}

As America's involvement in [[World War II]] intensified after the December 7, 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Graham signed up for the service alongside many fellow student-athletes, entering the  [[U.S. Navy Air Corps]].{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} He was able to stay at Northwestern as he waited to be called for active duty. But the Wildcats struggled in 1942, winning only one game as players joined the war effort.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} Graham still set a [[Big Ten Conference]] single-season passing record that year with 89 completions.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}}

The following year, Graham and many of his teammates moved to the [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in [[Glenview, Cook County, Illinois|Glenview, Illinois]] but continued to play for Northwestern along with enlistees from other schools.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}}{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=80}} The 1943 season was a strong one for Northwestern. The team beat Ohio State, the defending national champions, and a good military team at [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes Naval Station]].{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=55}} The Wildcats later lost to [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] and [[Michigan State University|Michigan]], however, and finished the season with an 8<U+2013>2 record  and a ninth-place ranking in the AP Poll.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=55}}{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=64}} Graham set another Big Ten passing record, was named conference MVP, received All-American honors and finished third in [[Heisman Trophy]] voting.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=55}} By the end of his college career, he held a [[Big Ten Conference]] record for passing yards with 2,132.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=79}}{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=64}}

Impressed by Graham's performances in Northwestern's wins over Ohio State in 1941 and 1943, Paul Brown came and offered him a contract worth $7,500 per year and a monthly stipend of $250 until the end of the war to play for a professional team he was coaching in [[Cleveland]] in the new [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=80}} The stipend was a large amount of money at the time. "All I asked was, where do I sign?" Graham said later. "Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever."{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=80}} Graham was also drafted by the [[National Football League]]'s [[Detroit Lions]], but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=20}} 

Graham's career at Northwestern officially ended in February of 1944, when he moved to [[Colgate University]] in [[Hamilton (village), New York|Hamilton, New York]] as a trainee in the Navy's V-5 cadet program.<ref name="Graham leaves Northwestern, 1944">{{cite news|title=Graham to Wind Up Cage Career Saturday Night|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GUxfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uVQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5936,2097876&dq=otto+graham&hl=en|accessdate=July 4, 2012|newspaper=Warsaw Daily Union|date=February 10, 1944|agency=United Press|page=5}}</ref><ref name="Graham to train at Colgate, 1944">{{cite news|title=Pick the All-Stars of The Big Ten Conference|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t35dAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZFwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2168,6140450&dq=otto+graham&hl=en|accessdate=July 4, 2012|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|date=March 8, 1944|agency=United Press|page=6}}</ref> He played basketball for Colgate before moving to North Carolina Pre-Flight later in 1944, where he played on the [[North Carolina Pre-Flight Cloudbusters football|Cloudbusters football team]] under coaches [[Glenn Killinger]] and [[Bear Bryant]].<ref name="Graham at Colgate, 1944">{{cite news|title=Otto Graham Stars In Colgate Triumph|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_RNJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QoMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6577,5247265&dq=otto+graham&hl=en|accessdate=July 4, 2012|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|date=February 20, 1944|agency=Associated Press|page=D1}}</ref>{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=64}}

The war, however, did not last forever, and droves of athletes streamed home as the conflict wound down in Europe with [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's surrender]] in the summer of 1945. The AAFC's first season was not set to start until the fall of 1946, and Graham occupied the intervening months by joining the [[Rochester Royals]] of the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] (NBL), a forerunner of the [[National Basketball Association]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=19<U+2013>20}} In March of 1946, the Royals swept a best-of-five series against the [[Sheboygan Redskins]] to win the NBL title.<ref name="Royals win championship">{{cite news|last=Larson|first=Lloyd|title=Rochester Clips Skins, Wins Title|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LbwdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BQ0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7140,4025504&dq=rochester+royals&hl=en|accessdate=July 4, 2012|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=March 24, 1946|page=1}}</ref>

==AAFC and NFL career==

By the time Graham was discharged from the Navy late in the summer of 1946, training camp for Brown's new team, the [[Cleveland Browns]], had already begun.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=86}} Concerned that Graham was not ready to start, Brown put in [[Cliff Lewis]] at quarterback in the first game of the season. Graham, however, soon replaced him, and he thrived as part of Brown's [[T formation]] offense.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|pp=86<U+2013>87}}{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=11}} Throwing to ends [[Dante Lavelli]] and [[Mac Speedie]], Graham led the team to a 12<U+2013>2 regular-season record and a spot in the championship game against the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|AAFC's New York Yankees]].{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=11}} The Browns won that game, touching off a period of dominance.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=11}} The team won each of the AAFC's four championships between 1946 and 1949, and had professional football's first perfect season in 1948.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=121, 145}} 

Graham's play was crucial to Cleveland's success. He averaged 10.5 yards per pass and had a [[quarterback rating]] of 112.1 in 1946, a professional football record until [[Joe Montana]] surpassed it in 1989.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=66, 85}} Graham was the AAFC's MVP in 1947 and was co-MVP in 1948.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=82, 121}} He led the league in passing between 1947 and 1949.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=82, 121, 148}} The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season, and three of its teams, including the Browns, merged into the more established [[National Football League]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=141}} Graham was the AAFC's all-time leading passer, throwing for 10,085 yards and 86 touchdowns.{{sfn|Keim|1999|pp=64<U+2013>65}}{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=149}}

[[File:Cleveland_Browns_quarterback_Otto_Graham_run,_1955.jpg|thumb|left|Graham was one of the top passers of his era, but he was also an effective runner.]]

Graham became the team's uncontested leader, but he was also "just one of the guys," tackle [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]] later said. "He was not aloof, which you see a lot of times today."{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=65}} He was good at spinning and moving in the [[Passing pocket|pocket]], skills he learned playing basketball.{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=64}} In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders.{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=65}} "I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm," Brown said.{{sfn|Keim|1999|p=65}} Brown remembered a Northwestern game against Ohio State in which he ran to his left and flung a pass all the way to his right for a touchdown.{{sfn|Boyer|2006|p=13}} His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. "I used to catch a lot of them one-handed," Lavelli said. "He had great touch in his hands."{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=20}} He was nicknamed "Automatic Otto" for his consistency and toughness.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=129}}

With Graham at the helm, the Browns continued to succeed when they joined the NFL in 1950. The team put to rest doubts about its prowess; some observers thought the Browns were merely a good team in a weak AAFC.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=152}} Graham led the Browns to a 10<U+2013>2 record, which set up a playoff against the [[New York Giants]] for a spot in the championship game.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=24}} The Browns' only two losses of the season had come against the Giants, but in a frozen [[Cleveland Stadium]] on December 17, Cleveland turned the tables.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=173<U+2013>174}} With game tied 3<U+2013>3 in the fourth quarter, Graham gained 45 yards rushing on a long drive to set up a 28-yard [[Lou Groza]] field goal.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=175}} The Browns cemented the 8<U+2013>3 win with a safety after the ensuing kickoff.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=175}}

The win against the Giants put Cleveland in the NFL championship game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]].{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=24}} Graham's rushing and passing were again key to the Browns' 30<U+2013>28 victory. He drove the offense downfield as time expired to set up a last-minute Groza field goal that sealed the win.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=181}} Graham had 99 yards rushing in the game, adding 298 yards of passing and four touchdowns.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=183}}

Cleveland posted a 11<U+2013>1 record in 1951, losing its only game to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in the season opener.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=224, 232}} That gave the Browns another spot in the championship game, again against the Rams.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=232}} This time, however, the Rams won 27<U+2013>17. Graham fumbled the ball in the third quarter, setting up a Rams touchdown that put them ahead 14<U+2013>10.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=232}} He also threw three interceptions, but otherwise put up respectable numbers, with 280 yards of passing and a touchdown.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=233<U+2013>234}} After the season, Graham was named the league's MVP.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=235}}

Cliff Lewis, Graham's longtime backup, retired before the 1952 season, and Paul Brown began to consider the team's future after Graham.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=238}} Graham by then was 30 years old and still had a few good years left, but Brown brought in [[George Ratterman]] as his backup.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=238<U+2013>239}} With Graham behind center, Cleveland finished the 1952 season with a 9<U+2013>3 record and faced the [[Detroit Lions]] in the championship game.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=250<U+2013>251}} It was a frustrating contest for Graham and the Browns; despite registering 384 total yards to Detroit's 258, the team lost its second straight championship, 17<U+2013>7.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=251<U+2013>253}} The Browns had several long drives that ended with missed field goals, and a fourth-quarter touchdown was negated because Graham's throw to [[Pete Brewster]] was first tipped by receiver [[Ray Renfro]]; under rules in place at the time, balls deflected by offensive teammates were automatic incompletions.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=253}} The pain of losing a second straight championship, however, paled in comparison to the misfortune that befell Graham on January 2, 1953.  While Graham was practicing for the [[Pro Bowl]] in Los Angeles, his six-week-old son Stephen died from a severe cold.<ref name="Graham baby dies">{{cite news|title=Graham Baby Dies While Parents Away|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eNMwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ct8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2433,415231&dq=otto+graham+son&hl=en|accessdate=July 6, 2012|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=January 2, 1953|page=16}}</ref>

[[File:Cleveland Browns quarterback Otto Graham with face mask.jpg|thumb|right|The protective plastic bar Otto Graham wore on his helmet after an injury to his face in 1953 contributed to the development of the modern face mask.]]

The 1953 season began with a 27<U+2013>0 shutout of the [[Green Bay Packers]] in which Graham passed for 292 yards and ran for two touchdowns.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=270}} It was the first of 11 straight victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season at the hands of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=275}} Near the end of the season in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from [[Art Michalik]] that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic face mask, and he came back into the game; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask, which was soon made mandatory.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=273}} Despite an 11<U+2013>1 record, Cleveland lost in the championship game for the third straight year, falling to the Detroit Lions 17<U+2013>16.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=25}} Graham threw a couple of interceptions and was not his usual self. He said after the game that he wanted to "jump off a building" for letting his teammates down. "I was the main factor in losing," he said. "If I had played my usual game, we would have won."{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=282}} Still, Graham finished the season as the NFL's leading passer and again won the MVP award.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=284}}

Before the start of the Browns' 1954 training camp, Graham was questioned as part of the infamous [[Sam Sheppard]] murder case. Sheppard, an [[osteopath]], was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple. Graham told police that while he and Beverly liked the Sheppards, they did not know much about their relationship.<ref name="Graham questioned in Sheppard case">{{cite news|title=Lie Detector Tests Back Up Mayor's Story|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A2BSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=c3oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3024,15657&dq=otto+graham+sheppard&hl=en|accessdate=July 6, 2012|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=August 16, 1954|agency=Associated Press|page=2}}</ref>

The 1954 season was a transitional one for the Browns. Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were nearing the end of their careers.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=305}} Graham, meanwhile, told Brown that he would retire after the season.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=310}} Yet despite all the change, the 1954 season was another strong one for Graham and the Browns. After losing the first three games, Cleveland won eight in a row and earned another shot at the championship, again against the Lions.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=319}} This time, the score was not close. The Browns won 56<U+2013>10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed for three more.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=324<U+2013>325}} He announced his retirement after the game.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=325<U+2013>326}}
