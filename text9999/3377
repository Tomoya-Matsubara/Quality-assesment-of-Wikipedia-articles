'''''Sesame Street''''' is an American [[children's television series]] created by [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Lloyd Morrisett]]. The program is known for its combination of [[Jim Henson]]'s [[The Muppets|Muppets]], [[animation]], [[short films]], humor, and cultural references. The program was conceived in 1966 during discussions between Cooney and Morrisett.  The series premiered on [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) stations on November 10, 1969 to positive [[reviews]], some controversy, and high [[Nielson ratings|ratings]].

The show has gone through significant changes throughout its history. The format of ''Sesame Street'' consisted of a combination of [[commercial television]] [[television production|production]] elements and educational techniques, and has changed throughout the show's history to reflect the changes in American culture and their audience's viewing habits. It was the first time the producers and writers of a children's television show used educational goals and a [[curriculum]] to shape its content.  It was also the first time its educational effects on young children were studied, and the first time both [[summative]] and [[formative assessment|formative]] research was used to change the show's content.

Shortly after creating ''Sesame Street'', its [[television producer|producers]] began to develop what came to be called "the CTW model", a system of planning, production, and evaluation, along with a collaboration between the producers, writers, and researchers.  The show was initially funded by government and private foundations, but moved to being more self-supportive by depending upon revenues from  [[licensing]] arrangements,  international sales, and other media for their funding.  By 2006, there were independently produced versions, or "[[International co-productions of Sesame Street|co-productions]]", of ''Sesame Street'' in twenty countries.  In 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of ''Sesame Street'' and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries.

By its 40th anniversary in 2009, ''Sesame Street'' was the fifteenth-highest rated children's television show in the United States.  A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American [[preschoolers]] had watched the show by the time they were three years old.  In 2008, it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children. As of 2009, ''Sesame Street'' has won eight [[Grammy Awards]] and 118 [[Emmy Awards]]<U+2014>more than any other children's show.

==History==
{{Main|History of Sesame Street}}

''Sesame Street'' was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children's television show that would "master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them",<ref name="davis-8"/> such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]] (CTW) received a combined grant of $8 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8|1969}}}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from the Carnegie Foundation, the [[Ford Foundation]], and the [[US federal government]] to create and produce a new children's television show.<ref name="Finch, p. 53"/> The program premiered on [[public broadcasting]] television stations on November 10, 1969.<ref name="brooke"/> It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research.<ref name="palmer"/>  Initial responses to the show included adulatory [[reviews]], some controversy, and high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. By its 40th anniversary in 2009, ''Sesame Street'' was broadcast in over 120 countries, and 20 [[International co-productions of Sesame Street|international versions]] had been produced.<ref name="friedman"/>

''Sesame Street'' has undergone significant changes in its history. According to writer Michael Davis, by the mid-1970s the show had become "an American institution".<ref name="davis-220"/>  The cast and crew expanded during this time, including the hiring of women in the crew and additional minorities in the cast. The show's success continued into the 1980s. In 1981, the federal government withdrew its funding, so CTW turned to other sources, including its magazine division, book [[royalties]], product [[licensing]], and foreign income.<ref name="odell"/>  ''Sesame Street'''s curriculum has expanded to include more [[affective]] topics such as relationships, ethics, and emotions. Many of the show's [[plot (narrative)|storylines]] were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew. Most notable of these are the 1982 death of [[Will Lee]]<U+2014>who played [[Mr. Hooper]]<ref name="hellman-52"/><U+2014>and the marriage of Luis and Maria in 1988.<ref name="Borgenicht, p. 80"/>

In recent decades, ''Sesame Street'' has faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in viewing habits of young children, more competition from other shows, the development of cable television, and a drop in ratings.<ref name="davis-320"/>  After the turn of the twenty-first century, ''Sesame Street'' made major structural changes; for example, starting in 2002, its format became more narrative and included storylines.  Due to the popularity of the Muppet [[Elmo]], the show also incorporated a popular segment after its thirtieth anniversary in 1999 known as "[[Elmo's World]]".<ref name="goodman"/>  With the fortieth anniversary in [[36th Daytime Emmy Awards|2009]], the show received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy.<ref name="emmys"/>

==Format==

{{Main|Format of Sesame Street}}

''Sesame Street'', from its first episode, has structured its format by using "a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music"<ref name="odell-70"/> as well as animation and live-action short films.<ref name="odell-70"/>  When ''Sesame Street'' premiered, most researchers assumed that young children did not have long [[attention span]]s, so the new show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their audience's attention.  At first, the show's "street scenes", which referred to the action taking place on its set, consisted of a typical inner-city street and were not story-based. Instead, they consisted of individual segments connected to the curriculum and interrupted by "inserts", or puppet skits, short films, and animations; this structure allowed the producers to use a mixture of styles, paces, and characters.  By season 20, research had shown that children were able to follow a story, so the street scenes, interspersed with shorter segments, were changed to depict storylines.<ref name="magazine"/><ref name="gikow-179"/>

The producers decided, by recommendation of [[developmental psychology|child psychologists]], that the show's human actors and Muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse and mislead young children.<ref name="fisch-39"/>  When the CTW tested the appeal of the new show, they found that although children paid attention to the shows during the Muppet segments, their interest was lost during the "Street" segments.<ref name="gladwell-105"/>  The producers went back and re-shot the Street segments; Henson and his team created Muppets such as [[Big Bird]] and [[Oscar the Grouch]] that could interact with the human actors.<ref name="Gladwell, p. 106"/><ref name="fisch3940"/>  ''Sesame Street'''s format remained intact until the show's later decades, when their audience changed. Its producers responded to these changes by moving to a more narrative format, beginning in 1998 with the creation of the popular segment, "Elmo's World", a fifteen-minute long segment hosted by the Muppet Elmo.<ref name="clash-75"/>

==Educational goals==
{{Main|Educational goals of Sesame Street}}

As author [[Malcolm Gladwell]] has stated, "''Sesame Street'' was built around a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them".<ref name="gladwell-100"/>  [[Gerald S. Lesser]], the CTW's first advisory board chair, went even further and stated that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention.<ref name="Lesser, p. 116"/>  ''Sesame Street'' was the first children's show that structured each episode and made, as Gladwell put it, "small but critical adjustments"<ref name="gladwell-91"/> to each segment to capture children's attention.  According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, ''Sesame Street'' was one of the few children's television programs that utilized a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, garnered from [[formative assessment|formative]] and [[summative]] research, in its content.<ref name="truglio-234"/>

''Sesame Street'' had both [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[affect (psychology)|affective]] goals.  Initially, its producers and researchers focused on cognitive goals, while addressing affective goals indirectly, because they believed that focusing on cognitive goals would increase children's [[self-esteem]] and feelings of [[skill|competency]].<ref name="morrow-76"/><ref name="morrow-106"/>  One of their initial and primary goals was preparing young children for school, especially children from [[poverty|low-income]] families.<ref name="lesser-46"/>  The show's producers used [[modeling (psychology)|modeling]],<ref name="lesser8687"/> repetition,<ref name="lesser-107"/> and humor<ref name="Lesser, p. 116"/> to fulfill their goals.  They made changes in the show's content to increase their viewers' attention and to increase its appeal.<ref name="lesser-87"/>  They encouraged "co-viewing" to entice older children and parents to watch the show by including humor, cultural references, and celebrities.<ref name="allshow"/>

After ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s first season, its critics forced its producers and researchers to address affective goals more overtly.  The affective goals they addressed were social competence, tolerance of [[cultural diversity|diversity]], and nonaggressive ways of [[conflict resolution|resolving conflict]], which was depicted through interpersonal disputes among its residents.<ref name="huston"/>  In the 1980s, the show used the real-life experiences of the show's cast and crew, such as the death of [[Will Lee]] ([[Mr. Hooper]]) and the pregnancy of [[Sonia Manzano]] (Maria) to address affective concerns.<ref name="hellman-52"/>  In later seasons, ''Sesame Street'' addressed real-life disasters such as the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name="gikow-165"/>

The show's goals for outreach were addressed through a series of programs that first focused on promotion, and then after the first season, on the development of educational materials used in preschool settings.  Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.<ref name="gikow-181"/>

==Funding==
As a result of Cooney's initial proposal in 1968, the Carnegie Institute awarded her an $8 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8|1969}}}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) grant to create a new children's television program and establish the CTW,<ref name="Finch, p. 53"/><ref name="palmer-3"/> renamed in 2000 to the [[Sesame Workshop]] (SW).  Cooney and Morrisett procured additional multi-million-dollar grants from the US federal government, [[The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations]] [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting|CPB]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].<ref name="davis-8"/>  Davis reported that Cooney and Morrisett decided that if they did not procure full funding from the beginning, they would drop the idea of producing the show.<ref name="davis-105"/>  As Lesser reported, funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial broadcast [[television networks]], but caused challenges in procuring future funding.<ref name="lesser-17"/>

After ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources. From the first season, they understood that the source of their funding, which they considered "seed" money, would need to be replaced.<ref name="davis-203"/>  The 1970s were marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements with toy companies and other manufacturers, publishing, and international sales for their funding.<ref name="odell"/>

In 1998, the CTW accepted [[sponsor (commercial)|corporate sponsorship]] to raise funds for ''Sesame Street'' and other projects. For the first time, they aired short ads of indoor playground manufacturer [[Discovery Zone]], their first corporate sponsor, to air before and after each episode. Consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]], who had previously appeared on ''Sesame Street'', called for a boycott of the show, saying that the CTW was "exploiting impressionable children".<ref name="brooke"/>

==Production==
===Research===
{{Main|Sesame Street research}}

As Cooney has stated, "Without research, there would be no ''Sesame Street''".<ref name="cooney-xi"/>  In 1967, when Cooney and her team began to plan the show's development, combining research with television production was, as she put it, "positively heretical".<ref name="cooney-xi"/> Shortly after creating ''Sesame Street'', its producers began to develop what came to be called "the CTW model", a system of planning, production, and evaluation that did not fully emerge until the end of the show's first season.<ref name="morrow-68"/><ref group=note>See Gikow, p. 155, for a visual representation of the CTW model.</ref> According to Morrow, the CTW model consisted of four parts: "the interaction of receptive television producers and [[child development|child science]] experts, the creation of a specific and age-appropriate curriculum, research to shape the program directly, and independent measurement of viewers' learning".<ref name="morrow-68"/>

[[File:Educational Testing Service welcome sign.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Large wooden sign with "Educational Testing Service" in white letters, in the middle of a field overlooking several trees and a blue sky.|Welcome sign at entrance to ETS headquarters. The ETS conducted the early summative studies about ''Sesame Street''.]]

Cooney credited the show's high standard in research procedures to Harvard [[professors]] Gerald Lesser, whom the CTW hired to design the show's educational objectives, and Edward Palmer, who was responsible for conducting the show's formative research and for bridging the gap between the show's producers and researchers.<ref name="cooney-xii"/>  The CTW conducted research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production,<ref name="mielke-8485"/> and independent summative evaluations, conducted by the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) during the show's first two seasons, which measuring its educational effectiveness.<ref name="palmer"/> Cooney stated, "From the beginning, we<U+2014>the planners of the project<U+2014>designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners".<ref name="Borgenicht, p. 9"/>  Cooney also described the collaboration as an "arranged marriage".<ref name="cooney-xi"/>

===Writing===
''Sesame Street'' has used many writers in its long history. As Dave Connell, one of ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s original producers, has stated, it was difficult to find adults who could identify a preschooler's interest level. Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. [[Norman Stiles]], head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would "burn out" after writing about a dozen scripts.<ref name="hellman-52"/>  According to Gikow, ''Sesame Street'' went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most [[educational television]] programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that it would be easier to teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy.<ref name="gikow-178"/> As Stone stated, "Writing for children is not so easy".<ref name="gikow-178"/>  Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, "It's not an easy show to write. You have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt".<ref name="gikow-174"/>

[[File:Kaufman Univ Studio LIC jeh.JPG|right|200px|thumb|alt=Facade of a large white building, the left having large pillars beneath a strip with dozens of windows and the right three stories of large windows.|The [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]], where ''Sesame Street'' is taped.]]

The show's research team developed an annotated document, or "Writer's Notebook", which served as a bridge between the show's curriculum goals and [[script development]].<ref name="lesser-101"/>  The notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points,<ref name="morrow-82"/> provided extended definitions of curriculum goals, and assisted the writers and producers in translating the goals into televised material.<ref name="palmer-10"/>  Suggestions in the notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on the show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible.<ref name="Palmer & Fisch, p. 11"/>

The research team, in a series of meetings with the writers, also developed "a curriculum sheet" that described the show's goals and priorities for each season. After receiving the curriculum focus and goals for the season, the writers met to discuss ideas and [[story arcs]] for the characters, and an "assignment sheet" was created that suggested how much time was allotted for each goal and topic.<ref name="lesser-101"/><ref name="lesser2-28"/>  When a script was completed, the show's research team analyzed it to ensure that the goals were met. Then each production department met to determine what each episode needed in terms of [[costumes]], lights, and [[Theatrical scenery|sets]]. The writers were present during the show's taping, which for the first twenty-four years of the show took place in [[Manhattan]], and after 1992, at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens, New York]], to make last-minute revisions when necessary.<ref name="MURPHY2009"/><ref name="apollo"/><ref name="spinney"/><ref group=note>Most of the first season was filmed at a studio near [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], but a strike forced their move to [[Teletape Studios]]. In the early days, the set was simple, consisting of four structures (Gikow, pp. 66<U+2013>67). In 1982, ''Sesame Street'' began filming at [[Unitel Studios]] on 57th Street, but relocated to Kaufman Astoria Studios in 1993, when the producers decided they needed more space (Gikow, pp. 206<U+2013>207).</ref>

===Media===
{{Main|Sesame Street media|Music of Sesame Street|International co-productions of Sesame Street}}

''Sesame Street'' and the CTW, early in their history, began to look for alternative funding sources and turned to creating products and licensing agreements.  They became, as Cooney put it, "a multiple-media institution".<ref name="cherow-197"/>  In 1970, the CTW created a "non-broadcast" division responsible for creating and publishing books and ''[[Sesame Street Magazine]]''.<ref name="cherow19798"/>  They decided that all materials their licensing program created would "underscore and amplify"<ref name="davis-195"/> the show's curriculum.  In 2004, over 68% of ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s revenue came from licenses and products such as toys and clothing.<ref name="carvajal"/><ref>See Gikow, pp. 280<U+2013>285 for a list of many of the show's products.</ref>  By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' Muppets accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees, split between the Sesame Workshop and [[Henson Associates]].<ref name="davis-5"/>

[[Jim Henson]], as their creators, owned the [[trademarks]] to the Muppet characters, and he was reluctant to market them at first.  He agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, [[Sesame Street video games|computer games]], and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW and its outreach efforts.<ref name="davis-203"/><ref name="gikow-268"/>  Even though Cooney and the CTW had very little experience with marketing, they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions.<ref name="davis-205"/>  Any product line associated with the show had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during the show's airings.<ref name="davis-204"/>  As Davis reported, "Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref name="davis-204"/>

Director Jon Stone stated about the music of ''Sesame Street'': "There was no other sound like it on television".<ref name="gikow-220"/>  For the first time in children's television, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum.<ref name="gikow-227"/>  In order to attract the best [[composers]] and [[lyricists]], the CTW allowed [[songwriters]] like ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s first musical director [[Joe Raposo]] to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which helped the show sustain public interest.<ref name="davis-256"/>  By 1991, ''Sesame Street'' had received eight [[Grammys]].<ref name="kohn"/>

''Sesame Street'' used animations and short films, interspersed throughout each episode, to help teach their viewers basic concepts like numbers and letters.<ref name="morrow-89"/>  The CTW commissioned outside studios to create and produce them.<ref name="gikow-236"/> Jim Henson was one of the many producers who created short films for the show.<ref name="Gikow, p. 246"/>  Shortly after ''Sesame Street'' debuted in the US, the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show in their countries.  These versions came be called "co-productions".<ref name="cole-148"/>  By 2006, there were twenty co-productions.<ref name="world"/> In 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of ''Sesame Street'',<ref name="cole-147"/> and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries.<ref name="gikow-263"/>  In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for US$96 million.<ref name="carvajal"/>

==Cast, crew, and characters==

Shortly after the CTW was created in 1968, Joan Ganz Cooney was named its first executive director. She was one of the first female executives in American television; her appointment was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade".<ref name="davis12829"/>  She assembled a team of producers, all of whom had previously worked on ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]''. [[Jon Stone]] was responsible for writing, casting, and format; [[Dave Connell]] took over animation; and Sam Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team.<ref name="davis-147"/>  Cameraman Frankie Biondo started working on ''Sesame Street'' from its first episode.<ref name="gikow-15"/>

Jim Henson and the Muppets' involvement in ''Sesame Street'' began when he and Cooney met at one of the curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should "make do without puppets".<ref name="Finch, p. 53"/>  Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join ''Sesame Street'' for social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the ''Sesame Street'' Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW.<ref name="davis-5"/>  As Morrow stated, Henson's puppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention.<ref name="morrow-93"/>  Davis reported that Henson was able to take "arcane academic goals" and translate them to "effective and pleasurable viewing".<ref name="davis-163"/>  In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. Morrow reported that the Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.<ref name="morrow-9495"/>

Although the producers decided against depending upon a single host for ''Sesame Street'' and to cast a group of ethnically diverse actors,<ref name="lesser-99"/> they realized that a children's television program needed to have, as Lesser put it, "a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities",<ref name="lesser-125"/> both human and Muppet. Jon Stone, whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority,<ref name="hellman-52"/> was responsible for hiring the show's first cast. He did not audition actors until Spring 1969, a few weeks before the five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the "most enthusiastic thumbs up" were cast.<ref name="Borgenicht, p. 15"/>  For example, [[Loretta Long]] was chosen to play [[The Robinson family (Sesame Street)|Susan]] when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of "[[I'm a Little Teapot]]".<ref name="Borgenicht, p. 15"/><ref name="davis-172"/>  As Stone said, casting was the only aspect of the show that was "just completely haphazard".<ref name="davis-195" />  Most of the cast and crew found jobs on ''Sesame Street'' through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.<ref name="davis-195" />

According to the CTW's research, children preferred watching and listening to other children more than puppets and adults, so they included children in many scenes.<ref name="lesser-127"/>  Dave Connell insisted that no child actors were used,<ref name="morrow-84"/> so these children were nonprofessionals, unscripted, and spontaneous. Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control, but the adult cast learned to handle the children cast's spontaneity with their own spontaneity, even when it resulted in departure from the planned script or from the planned lesson.<ref name="lesser-12728"/>  CTW research also revealed that the children's hesitations and on-air mistakes served as models for viewers.<ref name="gikow-123"/>  According to Morrow, this resulted in the show having a "fresh quality", especially in its early years.<ref name="morrow-84"/>  Children were also used in the voice-over commentaries of most of live-actions films the CTW produced.<ref name="morrow-102"/>

When ''Sesame Street'' premiered in 1969, it aired on only 67.6% of American televisions, but it earned a 3.3 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] rating, which totaled 1.9 million households.<ref name="Seligsohn"/>  By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, 9 million American children under the age of six were watching ''Sesame Street'' daily.  According to a 1993 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners and first- and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups.<ref name="zill-117"/>

The show's ratings significantly decreased in the early 1990s, resulting from changes in children's viewing habits and in the television marketplace. The producers responded to  by making large-scale structural changes to the show.<ref name="weiss"/>  By 2006, ''Sesame Street'' had become "the most widely viewed children's television show in the world", with 20 international independent versions and broadcasts in over 120 countries.<ref name="friedman"/> A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old.<ref name="growing"/>  In 2008, it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children.<ref name="friedman"/>  By the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was ranked the fifteenth most popular children's show on television.<ref name="counts"/>

{{Main|Sesame Street research#Summative research}}
As of 2001, there were over 1,000 [[research]] studies regarding ''Sesame Street'''s efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture.<ref name="cooney-xii" />  The CTW solicited the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to conduct summative research on the show.<ref name="mielke-85"/>  ETS's two "landmark"<ref name="mielke-88"/> summative evaluations, conducted in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that the show had a significant educational impact on its viewers.<ref name="palmer-20"/>  These studies have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children.<ref name="mielke-88"/>{{#tag:ref|According to Edward Palmer and his colleague Shalom M. Fisch, these studies were responsible for securing funding for the show over the next several years.<ref name="palmer-20"/>|group=note}} Additional studies conducted throughout ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers.{{#tag:ref|See Gikow, pp. 284<U+2013>285; ''"G" is For Growing: Thirty Years of Research on Children and Sesame Street'', pp. 147<U+2013>230.|group=note}}

Lesser believed that ''Sesame Street'' research "may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children".<ref name="lesser-235"/>  He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige in the television industry of producing shows for children.<ref name="lesser-235"/> Historian Robert Morrow, in his book ''Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television'', which chronicled the show's influence on children's television and on the television industry as a whole, reported that many critics of commercial television saw ''Sesame Street'' as a "straightforward illustration for reform".<ref name="morrow-122"/>  Les Brown, a writer for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', saw in ''Sesame Street'' "a hope for a more substantial future" for television.<ref name="morrow-122"/>

Morrow reported that the networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many critics saw them as "appeasement gestures".<ref name="morrow-127"/>  According to Morrow, in spite of the CTW Model's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television "made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods", and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them.<ref name="morrow-130"/>  By the mid-1970s, commercial television abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming.<ref name="morrow-132"/>  Other critics hoped that ''Sesame Street'', with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers.<ref name="morrow-124"/>  It was not until the mid-1990s when a children's television educational program, ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', used the CTW's methods to create and modify their content.  The creators of ''Blue's Clues'' were influenced by ''Sesame Street'', but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut.  Angela Santomero, one of its producers, said, "We wanted to learn from ''Sesame Street'' and take it one step further".<ref name="gladwell-111"/>

As critic [[Richard Roeper]] has stated, perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of ''Sesame Street'' have been the enduring [[Rumors and urban legends regarding Sesame Street|rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters]], especially about [[Bert and Ernie]].<ref name="roeper"/>

===Critical reception===
''Sesame Street'' was praised from its debut in 1969. ''Newsday'' reported that several newspapers and magazines had written "glowing" reports about the CTW and Cooney.<ref name="Seligsohn"/>  The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it.<ref name="morrow119120"/>  In 1970, ''Sesame Street'' won twenty awards, including a [[Peabody Award]], three [[Emmy]]s, an award from the [[Public Relations Society of America]], a [[Clio]], and a Prix Jeunesse.<ref name="morrow-119"/>  By 1995, the show had won two [[Peabody Awards]] and four [[Parents' Choice Award]]s. In addition, it was the subject of retrospectives at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].<ref name="allshow"/>

''Sesame Street'' was not without its detractors, however. In May 1970, a state commission in [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting|Mississippi]] voted to ban ''Sesame Street'' because of its "highly integrated cast of children" which "the commission members felt ... Mississippi was not yet ready for".<ref name="missban"/>  According to ''[[Children and Television]]'', Lesser's account of the development and early years of ''Sesame Street'', there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season.<ref name="lesser17475"/>{{#tag:ref|See Lesser, pp. 175<U+2013>201 for his response to the early critics of ''Sesame Street.|group=note}}  Historian Robert W. Morrow speculated that much of the early criticism, which he called "surprisingly intense",<ref name="morrow-3"/> stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, "the place of children in American society and the controversies about television's effects on them".<ref name="morrow-3"/>

According to Morrow, the "most important" studies finding negative effects of ''Sesame Street'' were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist Thomas D. Cook during its first two seasons.<ref name="morrow14647"/>  Social scientist and [[Head Start Program]] founder [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] criticized the show for being too wholesome.<ref name="bigbadtv"/>  Psychologist [[Leon Eisenberg]] saw ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s urban setting as "superficial" and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child.<ref name="Morrow, p. 98"/> Head Start director Edward Zigler was probably ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s most vocal critic in the show's early years.<ref name="morrow-147"/>

In spite of their commitment to multiculturalism, the CTW experienced conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists, who objected to ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s depiction of Latinos and women.<ref name="morrow15758"/>  The CTW took steps to address their objections.  By 1971, the CTW hired [[Hispanic]] actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-70s, Morrow reported that "the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about [[Mexican holidays]] and [[Mexican cuisine|foods]], and cartoons that taught Spanish words".<ref name="morrow-155"/>  As ''[[The New York Times]]'' has stated, creating strong female characters "that make kids laugh, but not...as female stereotypes"<ref name="gikow-142"/> has been a challenge for the producers of ''Sesame Street''.  According to Morrow, change regarding how women and girls were depicted on ''Sesame Street'' occurred slowly.<ref name="morrow-156"/>  As more female Muppets performers like [[Fran Brill]], [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]], and [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]] were hired and trained, stronger female characters like [[Abby Cadabby]] were created.<ref name="gikow-143"/>

In 2002, ''Sesame Street'' was ranked #27 on [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]].<ref name="tvguide"/>  As of 2009, ''Sesame Street'' has received 118 [[Emmy Awards]], more than any other television series.<ref name="emmys"/>{{#tag:ref|In 2010, ''Sesame Street'' won an additional eight Emmys.<ref name="awards"/>|group=note}}
