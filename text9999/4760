'''''Libia''''' was a [[protected cruiser]] built in Italy in the 1900s. The ship had originally been laid down in 1907 for the [[Ottoman Navy]] and was to have been named '''''Drama''''', and was based on the Ottoman cruiser {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Hamidiye||2}}. She had not been completed by the outbreak of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911 and so she was seized by the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) and was completed in 1913. The ship was armed with two {{convert|152|mm|abbr=on}} and eight {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and was capable of a top speed of over {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}.

''Libia'' had a relatively uneventful career. Before Italy's entry into [[World War I]], she was involved in the evacuation of [[William, Prince of Albania|Prince William]], the ruler of Albania, from [[Durazzo]] in late 1914. Following Italy's declaration of war in May 1915, ''Libia'' patrolled the [[Otranto Barrage]] but did not see action. In 1921&ndash;22, she went on a world tour, during which she was featured in a short documentary produced by the then-unknown [[Frank Capra]]. In 1925 she was deployed to China, where she remained for nearly a decade. In 1937, the old cruiser was stricken from the [[naval register]] and sold for scrap.

==Design==
The design for the new cruiser was based on the British-built Ottoman cruiser {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Hamidiye||2}}. The ship was {{convert|103.6|m|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|111.8|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.5|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.5|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|3760|MT|sp=us}} standard and up to {{convert|4466|MT|abbr=on}} at full load. The ship was fitted with two pole masts. She had a crew of 14&nbsp;officers and 300&nbsp;enlisted men. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on|0}} thick, and the [[conning tower]] had the same thickness of armor plating on the sides. The main guns were protected by {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[gun shield]]s.<ref name=GG262/>

''Libia'' was powered by two-shaft vertical [[triple-expansion engine]]s. Steam for the engines was provided by sixteen coal-fired [[Niclausse boiler|Niclausse]] [[water-tube boiler]]s that were trunked into three closely spaced [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] on the centerline. The engines were rated at {{convert|12500|ihp|lk=in}}, though they only reached {{convert|11530|ihp|abbr=on}} in service. This was sufficient to propel the ship at a top speed of {{convert|22.9|kn|lk=in}}. ''Libia'' had a cruising radius of {{convert|3150|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}.<ref name=GG262/>

The ship was armed with a main battery of two {{convert|152|mm|abbr=on}} L/50 [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing]] guns, one forward and one astern.<ref name=GG262/> These guns were probably Pattern FF Armstrong guns, which fired a {{convert|20|kg|adj=on}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|780|m/s}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 96</ref> These were augmented by a battery of eight {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} L/45 guns, four mounted individually on each [[broadside]]. Close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was provided by a battery of eight {{convert|47|mm|abbr=on}} L/50 guns and six {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} L/20 guns. She was also equipped with four {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref name=GG262/>

==Service history==
The new cruiser was laid down in 1907 at the Ansaldo shipyard in [[Genoa]] for the [[Ottoman Empire]], under the name ''Drama''.<ref name=GG262>Gardiner & Gray, p. 262</ref> But following the rise of the [[Young Turks]] in the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government became unwilling to pay its foreign debts, which led Ansaldo to halt construction work. Work on the ship only resumed in late 1911 when Italy seized the ship following its declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire in the [[Italo-Turkish War]].<ref>"Italian Cruiser Libia", p. 67</ref> The completed hull was launched on 11 November 1912, and following the completion of [[fitting-out]] work, the new ship was commissioned on 25 March 1913.<ref name=GG262/> On 3 September 1914, ''Libia'' was in the port of [[Durazzo]], Albania when [[William, Prince of Albania|Prince William]], the ruler of the country, departed following turmoil caused by an insurgency in the country, coupled with the outbreak of [[World War I]]. ''Libia'' had landed a contingent of marines to restore order in the city, where some 2,000 refugees fleeing the insurgents attempted to board passenger ships bound for Italy. After the refugees were evacuated, ''Libia'' recalled her marines and departed as well.<ref>"Exit Albania?", pp. 1062&ndash;1063</ref> 

Italy had declared neutrality at the start of World War I, but by July 1915, the [[Triple Entente]] had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the [[Central Powers]].<ref>Halpern, p. 140</ref> Admiral [[Paolo Thaon di Revel]], the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian]] [[submarine]]s and [[naval mine]]s in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.<ref>Halpern, p. 150</ref> Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.<ref>Halpern, pp. 141&ndash;142</ref> ''Libia'' spent much of the war patrolling the [[Otranto Barrage]], along with the cruisers {{ship|Italian cruiser|Piemonte||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Agordat||2}} and several Italian and French [[destroyer]]s.<ref>Cavallaro, p. 624</ref> During the war, the ship had three {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} L/40 [[anti-aircraft gun]]s installed.<ref name=GG262/>

In 1921 the ship went on a world tour under the command of Admiral [[Ernesto Burzagli]]. During the cruise, she stopped in [[San Francisco]], United States in November, where she stayed for a month. While there, she was filmed for a short documentary by the then-unknown film director [[Frank Capra]] on 6 and 7 November&mdash;though it did not generate much attention, it was Capra's first publicly screened film. The ship departed San Francisco on 4 December.<ref>McBride, p. 133</ref> In 1922, ''Libia'' visited Australia while on her tour.<ref>Cresciani, p. 93</ref> In 1925, her 150&nbsp;mm guns were removed.<ref name=GG262/> That year, she was sent to China, where she joined the [[armored cruiser]]s {{ship|Italian cruiser|San Marco||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|San Giorgio||2}} and the [[river gunboat]]s {{ship|Italian gunboat|Caboto||2}} and {{ship|Italian gunboat|Carlotto||2}}. These ships contributed men to form the ''Battaglione Italiano in China'' (Italian Battalion in China); the contingents from ''Libia'' were sent to guard the consulates in [[Beijing]] and [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]]. The ship remained in Chinese waters for nearly a decade; in the early 1930s, she was replaced by the protected cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Quarto||2}}.<ref>Marinelli & Andornino, p. 54</ref> In September 1935 she was drydocked to prepare for her disposal.<ref>Willmott, p. 60</ref> She was stricken from the [[naval register]] on 11 March 1937 and was sold to [[ship breaking|ship breakers]].<ref name=GG262/>
