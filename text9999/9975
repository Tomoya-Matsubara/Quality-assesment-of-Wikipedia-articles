'''Andy Ristie''' (born March 17, 1982) is a  [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Suriname]]se [[Kickboxing|kickboxer]] who competes in the [[middleweight]] division. After an unremarkable beginning to his career, he came to prominence with a lengthy and entertaining winning streak in the [[It's Showtime (kickboxing)|It's Showtime]] promotion in 2011 and 2012. This earned him an invite to fight amongst the 70&nbsp;kg/154&nbsp;lb division's elite, competing in the [[K-1 World MAX 2012 World Championship Tournament Final|K-1 World MAX 2012 Tournament]] and debuting in [[Glory (kickboxing)|Glory]] shortly after.

Standing at {{height|m=1.82|precision=1}}, Ristie is tall for his weight class and is known to look for [[knockout]]s from the first bell. He utilizes devastating [[Knee (strike)|knee strikes]] to the body and possesses considerable [[punching power]], especially in his left [[Hook (boxing)|hook]].<ref>[http://www.gloryworldseries.com/en/fighters/1256-andy-ristie Official Glory profile]</ref> As of January 2014, Ristie is ranked the #1 middleweight in the world by LiverKick.com.<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2804:official-liverkick-rankings-update-120&catid=46:rankings LiverKick.com Middleweight Rankings - January 2014]</ref>

==Career==

===Early career (2002-2011)===
A [[Surinamese people in the Netherlands|Dutch Surinamer]], Ristie was born in [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname]] in 1982 and relocated to [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] where he is trained by Lucien Carbin at Fight Club Carbin. While he won the [[World Kickboxing Network|WKN]] Intercontinental Super Welterweight (-72.6/160.1&nbsp;lb) Championship as an amateur, the beginnings of his professional career were fought in relative obscurity. Having built up an extensive record with an impressive [[knockout]] ratio fighting in smaller events in Suriname and the Netherlands, he was recruited by the [[It's Showtime (kickboxing)|It's Showtime]] promotion at twenty-nine years of age. He debuted with a first round KO of Nick Beljaards at ''[[BFN Group presents: It's Showtime Brussels]]'' in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] on March 26, 2011.<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=416:its-showtime-brussels-today&catid=37:kickboxing It's Showtime Brussels Today]</ref><ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=418:its-showtime-brussels-full-results&catid=39:europe&Itemid=59 It's Showtime Brussels Full Results]</ref>

On September 25, 2011, Ristie defeated [[William Diender]] via [[unanimous decision]] in the tournament reserve bout of the ''[[BFN Group & Music Hall presents: It's Showtime "Fast & Furious 70MAX"]]'' in Brussels.<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=867:its-showtime-fast-a-furious-70max-preview-reserve-fights&catid=36:k-1 It's Showtime Fast & Furious 70MAX Preview: Reserve Fights]</ref> He followed this up with a [[technical knockout]] defeat of Jonay Risco at ''[[Street Culture, Fight Club Group & Canary Kickboxing Federation presents: It's Showtime 53]]'' on November 12, 2011 in [[Tenerife]], [[Spain]]. Having dominated Risco throughout the fight, Ristie floored the Spaniard with a left [[Hook (boxing)|hook]] in round three and, while he was able to make it back to his feet, referee Joop Ubeda called a halt to the contest.<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1024:its-showtime-53-in-tenerife-tomorrow-fight-card&catid=36:k-1 It's Showtime 53 in Tenerife Tomorrow: Fight Card]</ref><ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1027:its-showtime-53-in-tenerife-live-results&catid=39:europe&Itemid=59 It's Showtime 53 in Tenerife Live Results]</ref>

He was invited to compete alongside fifteen of the world's other top 70&nbsp;kg/154&nbsp;lb kickfighters in the K-1 World MAX 2012 World Championship Tournament, and faced [[Gago Drago]] in the opening stage at the ''[[K-1 World MAX 2012 World Championship Tournament Final 16]]'' in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] on May 27, 2012.

Going into the third in need of a knockout, Ristie managed just that when he landed a huge right hand that had Petrosyan stunned only for him to follow it up with a combination of a right, left and another left that finished it, becoming the first man to stop Petrosyan and ending his forty-two fight, six year undefeated streak.<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2748:andy-ristie-dethrones-giorgio-petrosyan-in-r3&catid=50:glory&Itemid=75 Andy Ristie Dethrones Giorgio Petrosyan in R3]</ref> Riding the wave of momentum that saw him dethrone kickboxing's all-time greatest, Ristie continued his rich vein of form in the final against Robin van Roosmalen, dropping the Dutchman towards the tail end of round one before putting him away in two.<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2749:andy-ristie-takes-place-as-glory-12-lightweight-champion&catid=50:glory&Itemid=75 Andy Ristie Takes Place as GLORY 12 Lightweight Champion]</ref><ref>[http://www.muaythaiauthority.com/2013/11/glory-12-results-and-recap-andy-ristie.html Glory 12 Results and Recap: Andy Ristie shocks the world with two huge knockouts]</ref><ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2747:glory-12-live-results-and-updates&catid=40:americas&Itemid=59 GLORY 12 Live Results and Updates]</ref><ref>[http://fightsportasia.com/2013/11/24/glory-12-results-upsets-galore-as-giorgio-petrosyan-falls-short-to-tourney-winner-andy-ristie/ GLORY 12 results: Upsets galore as Giorgio Petrosyan falls short to tourney winner Andy Ristie]</ref> Ristie had some problems with his camp in the weeks prior to the tournament, leaving his longtime trainer Lucien Carbin to form his own Team Ristie.<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2750:post-glory-12-rumor-roundup&catid=50:glory&Itemid=75 Post-GLORY 12 Rumor Roundup]</ref>
