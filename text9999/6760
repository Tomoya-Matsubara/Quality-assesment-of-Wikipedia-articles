The first week of April will find residents and visitors to [[Tyler County, Texas]], celebrating spring time with the words "It is Dogwood time in Tyler County." The '''Tyler County Dogwood Festival''' has been held annually since 1940, with the exception of the years from 1942 through 1945 due to World War II.  Currently the Tyler County Festival features three weekends of activity.  The first weekend of the Festival is the Festival of the Arts.  The next weekend (the last weekend in March) is Western Weekend complete with trail rides, parade, and a rodeo.  The final weekend of the Festival is the Queen's Weekend which includes an arts and crafts festival, fun run, parade, and the culminating Dogwood Pageant and crowning of the Dogwood Queen and her Court.  The Tyler County Dogwood Festival showcases the natural beauty of springtime in Tyler County including the blooming [[dogwood]] trees.
