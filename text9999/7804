The '''gluteus maximus''' (also known as '''glut<U+00E6>us maximus''' or, collectively with the gluteus [[gluteus medius muscle|medius]] and [[gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]], the '''glutes''') is the largest and most [[wiktionary:superficial|superficial]] of the three [[gluteal muscles]]. It makes up a large portion of the shape and appearance of the [[buttocks]].

It is a narrow and thick fleshy mass of a quadrilateral shape, and forms the prominence of the [[nates]].

Its large size is one of the most characteristic features of the muscular system in humans,<ref>Norman Eizenberg et al., ''General Anatomy: Principles and Applications'' (2008), p 17.</ref> connected as it is with the power of maintaining the trunk in the erect posture. Other primates have much flatter buttocks.

The muscle is remarkably coarse in structure, being made up of fasciculi lying parallel with one another, and collected together into large bundles separated by [[septum|fibrous septa]].

==Origin and insertion==	
[[Image:Gluteus maximus muscle.PNG|thumb|left|upright|Muscles of the gluteal and posterior femoral regions, showing origin and insertion of gluteus maximus muscle.]]
It arises from the posterior gluteal line of the inner upper [[ilium (bone)|ilium]], and the rough portion of bone including the crest, immediately above and behind it; from the posterior surface of the lower part of the [[sacrum]] and the side of the [[coccyx]]; from the [[aponeurosis]] of the [[erector spinae]] ([[Thoracolumbar fascia|lumbodorsal fascia]]), the [[sacrotuberous ligament]], and the fascia covering the [[gluteus medius]] ([[gluteal aponeurosis]]).	 	
The fibers are directed obliquely downward and lateralward;
The gluteus maximus has two insertions:
*those forming the lower and larger portion of the muscle, together with the superficial fibers of the lower portion, end in a thick tendinous lamina, which passes across the [[greater trochanter]], and in is into the [[Iliotibial tract|iliotibial band]] of the [[fascia lata]];

*the deeper fibers of the lower portion of the muscle are inserted into the [[gluteal tuberosity]] between the [[vastus lateralis]] and [[adductor magnus]].

==Bursae==
{{Technical|section|date=December 2013}}
Three [[Bursa (anatomy)|bursae]] are usually found in relation with the deep surface of this muscle:
*One of these, of large size, and generally [[multilocular]], separates it from the [[greater trochanter]];
*a second, often wanting, is situated on the tuberosity of the [[ischium]];
*a third is found between the tendon of the muscle and that of the [[vastus lateralis]].
It is also inserted on the lateral condyle of the femur.

==Actions==
When the gluteus maximus takes its fixed point from the pelvis, it extends the [[femur]] and brings the bent [[thigh]] into a line with the body.

Taking its fixed point from below, it acts upon the [[pelvis]], supporting it and the trunk upon the head of the femur; this is especially obvious in standing on one leg.

Its most powerful action is to cause the body to regain the erect position after stopping, by drawing the pelvis backward, being assisted in this action by the [[biceps femoris]] (long head), [[semitendinosus]], [[semimembranosus]], and [[adductor magnus]].

The gluteus maximus is a tensor of the [[fascia lata]], and by its connection with the [[iliotibial band]] steadies the femur on the articular surfaces of the [[tibia]] during standing, when the extensor muscles are relaxed.

The lower part of the muscle also acts as an [[Anatomical terms of motion|adductor]] and [[external rotator]] of the limb. The upper fibers act as abductors of the hip joints.

==Training==
*[[Squat (exercise)]]
*[[Lunge (exercise)]]
*Hip thrust exercise
*Deadlift exercise
*Quadruped hip extensions
*Step-ups
*Four-way hip extensions
