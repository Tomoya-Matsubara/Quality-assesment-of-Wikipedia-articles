'''Timo M<U+00E4>kinen''', born [[18 March]] [[1938]], in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], was one of the original "[[Flying Finn (athlete)|Flying Finns]]" of motor [[rallying]]. He is most famous for his hat-trick of wins in the [[RAC Rally]], at the wheel of a [[Ford Escort]], preceded only by [[Erik Carlsson]] ([[Saab 96]]) in that feat.

His start in international rallying came in the [[1959]] [[1000 Lakes]], in a [[Triumph TR3]]. He later drove works [[Austin-Healey]]s and [[Mini]]s. In the big Healey, he finished 5th in the RAC Rally in [[1963]], drove Minis during most of [[1964]] but came 2nd in the RAC Rally, in a Healey, at the end of that year. He returned to the [[Mini Cooper S]] in [[1965]], winning the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] and the 1000 Lakes. He came 2nd in the RAC of 1965, again in a Healey. He was later to dominate that event, with the [[Ford Escort RS]] (1973-1975).

In [[1967]] Timo M<U+00E4>kinen became true rallye legend when pictures of the madcap Finn driving his Mini at a furious speed through Ouninpohja - with the car<U+00B4>s bonnet open. Leather straps holding bonnet were not thoroughly tightened and they opened after few rough bounces. He tried to put his head out from the side window but his his helmet was too big and he could only put his head halfway out. So he had to skid the car sideways continuously to see the road ahead. Even so M<U+00E4>kinen was third fastest on that special stage and he also won the entire rally. 

In [[1994]], M<U+00E4>kinen made brief return as Mini celebrated 30th anniversary of their 1964 Monte Carlo win of [[Paddy Hopkirk]], who also participated in the race. M<U+00E4>kinen retired on 2nd stage with fuel system problem.
