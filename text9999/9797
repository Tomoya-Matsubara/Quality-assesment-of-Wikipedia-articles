'''''Caio Duilio''''' was an Italian {{sclass|Andrea Doria|battleship}} that served in the [[Regia Marina]] during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. She was named after the Roman fleet commander [[Gaius Duilius]]. ''Caio Duilio'' was laid down in February 1912, launched in April 1913, and completed in May 1916. She was initially armed with a main battery of thirteen {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} guns, but a major reconstruction in the late 1930s replaced these with ten {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} guns. ''Caio Duilio'' saw no action during [[World War I]] owing to the inactivity of the Austro-Hungarian fleet during the conflict. She cruised the Mediterranean in the 1920s and was involved in the [[Corfu incident]] in 1923. 

During [[World War II]], she participated in numerous patrols and sorties into the Mediterranean, both to escort Italian convoys to North Africa and in attempts to catch the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]]. In November 1940, the British launched an [[Battle of Taranto|air raid on Taranto]]; ''Caio Duilio'' was hit by one torpedo launched by a [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bomber, which caused significant damage. Repairs lasted some five months, after which the ship returned to convoy escort duties. A fuel shortage immobilized the bulk of the Italian surface fleet in 1942, and ''Caio Duilio'' remained out of service until the Italian surrender in September 1943. She was thereafter interned at [[Malta]] until 1944, when the Allies permitted her return to Italian waters. She survived the war, and continued to serve in the post-war Italian navy, primarily as a training ship. ''Caio Duilio'' was placed in reserve for a final time in 1953; she remained in the Italian navy's inventory for another three years before she was stricken from the [[naval register]] in late 1956 and sold for scrapping the following year.

{{main|Andrea Doria class battleship}}

''Caio Duilio'' was {{convert|176|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.4|m|abbr=on}}. At full combat load, she displaced up to {{convert|24715|MT|sp=us}}. She had a crew of 35&nbsp;officers and 1,198&nbsp;enlisted men. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, with steam provided by eight oil-fired and twelve coal and oil burning [[Yarrow boiler]]s. The boilers were trunked into two large [[funnel]]s. The engines were rated at {{convert|30000|shp|lk=in}}, which provided a top speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}. She had a cruising radius of {{convert|4800|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}.<ref name=GG260>Gardiner & Gray, p. 260</ref>

The ship was armed with a main battery of thirteen {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} 46-caliber guns in three triple [[gun turret|turrets]] and two twin turrets. The secondary battery comprised sixteen {{convert|152|mm|abbr=on}} 45-caliber guns, all mounted in [[casemate]]s clustered around the forward and aft main battery turrets. ''Caio Duilio'' was also armed with thirteen {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} 50-caliber guns and six 76-mm anti-aircraft guns. As was customary for [[capital ship]]s of the period, she was equipped with three submerged {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. She was protected with [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented steel]] manufactured by [[U.S. Steel]]. The [[belt armor]] was {{convert|254|mm|abbr=on}} thick and the main deck was {{convert|98|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] and main battery turrets were protected with {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on}} worth of armor plating.<ref name=GG260/>

===Modifications===
''Caio Duilio'' was heavily rebuilt in 1937&ndash;1940 at [[Genoa]]. Her [[forecastle]] deck was extended further aft, until it reached the mainmast. The stern and bow were rebuilt, increasing the length of the ship to {{convert|186.9|m|abbr=on}}, and the displacement grew to {{convert|28882|MT|abbr=on}}. Her old machinery was replaced with more efficient equipment and her twenty boilers were replaced with eight oil-fired models; the new power plant was rated at {{convert|75000|shp|abbr=on}} and speed increased to {{convert|26|kn|abbr=on}}. The ship's [[amidships]] turret was removed and the remaining guns were bored out to {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}}. Her secondary battery was completely overhauled; the 152&nbsp;mm guns were replaced with twelve {{convert|135|mm|abbr=on}} guns in triple turrets amidships. The anti-aircraft battery was significantly improved, to include ten {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} guns, fifteen {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and sixteen {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} guns. Later, during [[World War II]], four more 37&nbsp;mm guns were installed and two of the 20&nbsp;mm guns were removed. After emerging from the modernization, ''Caio Duilio''{{'}}s crew numbered 35&nbsp;officers and 1,450&nbsp;enlisted men.<ref name=GC284>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 284</ref><ref name=F16>Fraccaroli, p. 16</ref>

==Service history==

''Caio Duilio'' was laid down at navy dockyard in [[Castellammare di Stabia]] on 24 February 1912. She was launched on 24 April 1913, and completed on 10 May 1916.<ref name=GG260/> She saw no action in [[World War I]], given the fact that the Austro-Hungarian fleet, Italy's main naval rival, remained in port for the duration of the conflict. As a result, ''Caio Duilio'' only went on four patrols during the war, and was operational for a total of 70 hours. She was based at [[Taranto]] starting in November 1918 to April 1919, but during that time, she deployed to [[Corfu]], from 10 November 1918 to 26 January 1919.<ref>Whitley, p. 165</ref> On 26 April 1919, ''Caio Duilio'' was sent to [[Izmir]] to help mediate a dispute over ownership of the area. While there, she had a confrontation with the Greek [[armored cruiser]] [[Greek cruiser Georgios Averof|''Georgios Averof'']], but this was defused when the Greeks landed troops to occupy Izmir. On 9 June, she was relieved by the old [[pre-dreadnought]] battleship [[Italian battleship Roma (1907)|''Roma'']], allowing her to move to [[Constantinople]].<ref>Whitley, pp. 165&ndash;166</ref>

During her deployment to Turkey, ''Caio Duilio'' entered the [[Black Sea]] to support the [[White movement|White Russians]] in the [[Russian Civil War]], from 23 June to 13 July. During this period, she was transferred to the Levant Squadron of the Italian Navy. She returned to Izmir after completing her deployment to the Black Sea, and remained there until 9 September, when she was relieved by the battleship [[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|''Giulio Cesare'']]. She returned to Taranto on 12 September, and was placed in reserve. Placed back into service in 1920, ''Caio Duilio'' went to [[Albania]] on 30 June to support the Italian Army contingent occupying the country, and participated in their withdrawal on 5 September. The following year, she was assigned to the Dodecanese Squadron and cruised in the eastern Mediterranean. She returned to Constantinople as part of an Allied fleet from 27 July to 10 November 1921.<ref name=W166>Whitley, p. 166</ref>

During the 1923 [[Corfu incident]] with Greece, the Italian Navy, including ''Caio Duilio'', was deployed to the island to secure a Greek apology following the murder of [[Enrico Tellini]] and four others. Later that year, she escorted the battleship [[Italian battleship Dante Alighieri|''Dante Alighieri'']] on a state visit to Spain. A magazine explosion on 8 April 1925 wrecked the No. 3 turret's barbette hoist. The ship went into reserve while repairs were effected in [[La Spezia]], which lasted until April 1928. She underwent refitting at Taranto from 18 March to 15 June 1930. She again went into reserve on 11 August 1932 until 11 August 1933, when she was made the [[flagship]] of the Commanding Officer, Reserve Fleet. Starting on 19 March 1937, she was taken to [[Genoa]] where an extensive reconstruction began at the [[Cantieri del Tirreno]] shipyard. The work was completed on 15 July 1940, at which point she was recommissioned into the 5th Division of the 1st Squadron, based in Taranto.<ref name=W166/>

''Caio Duilio''{{'}}s first wartime patrol took place on 31 August. She and the rest of the fleet sailed to intercept the British battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}}, which was steaming to [[Alexandria]], and a convoy sailing to [[Malta]]. The Italian fleet did not have sufficient aerial reconnaissance, which, along with bad weather, prevented the Italians from locating the British forces. They put back in to Taranto on 1 September. ''Caio Duilio'' again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British [[Force H]], but the Italian intelligence was faulty, as Force H was in the process of attacking [[Dakar]]. ''Caio Duilio'' returned to Taranto, where she remained until early November.<ref name=W166/>

===Attack at Taranto===
[[File:Battle of Taranto map-en.svg|thumb|Map showing the disposition of the Italian fleet and the British attacks on Taranto]]
{{main|Battle of Taranto}}
On the night of 10&ndash;11 November, the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] launched a surprise air raid on the harbor in Taranto. Twenty-one [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish torpedo bombers]] launched from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Illustrious|R87|6}} attacked the Italian fleet in two waves. They scored one hit on ''Caio Duilio'', three hits on [[Italian battleship Littorio|''Littorio'']], and one on [[Italian battleship Conte di Cavour|''Conte di Cavour'']].<ref>Rohwer, p. 47</ref> The torpedo hit ''Caio Duilio'' on her starboard side; it tore an {{convert|11|by|7|m|adj=on|sp=us}} hole in the hull and flooded the forward main battery magazines. A water tanker and several smaller craft pushed the battleship aground in shallow water to prevent her from sinking in the harbor. Temporary repairs were effected, and in January 1941, she was refloated and sent to Genoa for permanent repairs, which began on 26 January.<ref name=W166/>

While ''Caio Duilio'' was in dock for repairs, the British [[Force H]] departed from its normal role as a convoy escort in the western Mediterranean in early February to attack Genoa. Admiral [[James Somerville]]'s surface ships fired over a thousand shells at the port, and the aircraft of the carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} dropped magnetic mines in the harbor. Five ships were sunk, but ''Caio Duilio'' was not hit in the attack.<ref>Ireland, p. 64</ref> During the attack, ''Caio Duilio''{{'}}s anti-aircraft battery fired some 8,000&nbsp;rounds at the British spotter aircraft. Repair work was completed by May, and on 16 May she was back in Taranto in the 1st Squadron.<ref name=W166/>

===Later service===
''Caio Duilio'', now the flagship of the Italian fleet, sailed on 29 November to cover an Italian convoy to North Africa. She was escorted by the cruiser [[Italian cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi (1936)|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']] and six [[destroyer]]s. She sailed again on 13 December, to cover the convoy M41; the Italian fleet was forced to break off the convoy escort after [[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']] was torpedoed. ''Caio Duilio'' returned to port on the 14th, and departed to cover the convoy M42 two days later. She was stationed south of [[Messina]] with three cruisers and four destroyers. During the convoy operation, British forces attacked, resulting in the [[First Battle of Sirte]], but ''Caio Duilio''{{'}}s group was too far away to engage the British. She returned to Taranto on 19 December. She escorted convoy M43 on 3&ndash;6 January 1942, which successfully reached [[Tripoli]] unmolested. Convoy T18 followed on 22&ndash;5 January, and four of the five transports in the convoy reached Tripoli.<ref name=W166/>

''Caio Duilio''{{'}}s next operation was an attack on British convoys in the Mediterranean in February. She left port on 14 February with a pair of [[light cruiser]]s and seven destroyers, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. On the 21st, she escorted the convoy K7 from Messina and Corfu to Taranto. By this point in 1942, the Italian fleet began to suffer a severe shortage of fuel, which curtailed its operations. The situation was so bad that ''Caio Duilio'' had to be placed in reserve and drained of fuel, in order to keep the escort craft operational. She was at Taranto when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, and on 9 September she was taken to Malta, where she was interned with the rest of the Italian fleet.<ref name=W166/>

In June 1944, the Allies allowed ''Caio Duilio'' to return to Italian ports; she spent the rest of the war in Taranto, [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], and [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]]. She survived the war, and continued to serve in the Italian navy; she was the fleet [[flagship]] from 1 May 1947 until 10 November 1949, based in Taranto. She was moved to La Spezia in 1953 and removed from active service. ''Caio Duilio'' remained there until she was stricken from the [[naval register]] on 15 September 1956. She was sold for scrapping the following year.<ref>Whitley, p. 167</ref>
