The complete '''list of Presidents of the Portuguese Republic''' consists of the 20 [[heads of state]] in the [[History of Portugal|history of]] [[Portugal]] since the [[October 5, 1910 revolution]] that installed a [[republicanism|republican]] regime. This list includes not only those persons who sworn into office as [[President of Portugal]] but also those who ''de facto'' served as head of state since 1910. This is the case of [[Te<U+00F3>filo Braga]] who served as President of the Provisional Government after the republican coup d'<U+00E9>tat. Also [[Sid<U+00F3>nio Pais]], [[Mendes Cabe<U+00E7>adas]], [[Gomes da Costa]], as well as [[Canto e Castro]] and [[<U+00D3>scar Carmona]] in their early months, weren't sworn into office as President of the Republic, usually being the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|President of the Ministry]] (Prime Minister), but ''de facto'' accumulation this functions with that of the Head of State. See [[List of Presidents of Portugal#Notes|the notes]] for more information.

The numbering reflects the uninterrupted time in office served by a single person. For example, [[Jorge Sampaio]] served two consecutive terms and is counted as the 19th president (not the 19th and 20th).  [[Te<U+00F3>filo Braga]] served as the first and sole president of the Provisional Government, and therefore is not considered the first President, although he would serve again as head of state and be the 2nd president after [[Manuel de Arriaga]]'s resignation.  [[Bernardino Machado]] served two non-consecutive terms and is counted as both the 3rd and the 8th president.  Because of this, the list below contains 20 presidencies, but only 19 presidents.

The current President of Portugal is  [[An<U+00ED>bal Cavaco Silva]], winner of the [[Portuguese presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential election]].

The colors indicate the political affiliation of each President.
