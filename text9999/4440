'''Typhoon Nelson''' was the worst [[tropical cyclone]] to affect [[Southern China]] in 16&nbsp;years. Typhoon Nelson, which developed on August 16, originated from an area of thunderstorm activity well east of the [[Philippines]]. It gradually intensified over the next several days while moving northwest. Nelson reached typhoon intensity early on August&nbsp;20 and two days later, attained peak intensity before turning west. The cyclone brushed northern [[Taiwan]] early on August&nbsp;23 after weakening slightly. Nelson then briefly restrengthened to peak intensity. During the afternoon of August&nbsp;23, it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in eastern [[China]] before dissipating on August&nbsp;25.

Nelson brought heavy rains to Taiwan. Approximately 900,000&nbsp;families were left without power and 100,000&nbsp;telephone lines lost service. More than 20,000&nbsp;trees were uprooted. Across the country, five people were killed. Affecting a country already inundated by summer rains, Typhoon Nelson brought additional flooding and significant damage to much of Southern China. There, the storm killed 48&nbsp;individuals and hurt 329&nbsp;others. More than 5,000&nbsp;homes were destroyed while another 6,000&nbsp;were damaged. Around 2,000&nbsp;travelers were stranded due to flooding. Throughout China, losses from the storm totaled to $53&nbsp;million (1985&nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]).

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Nelson 1985 track.png}}
The origins of Nelson can be traced back to a small and disorganized, but persistent area of disturbed weather, which was first observed on August&nbsp;15. At this time, the convection was located {{convert|280|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} northwest of [[Saipan]]. Initially, the system was located near the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ), which enhanced the disturbance's convection. The disturbance was also located near a cold core [[upper-level low]] and a [[tropical upper-tropospheric trough]] (TUTT). By 0300&nbsp;[[UTC]] on August&nbsp;15, the system had become slightly more organized. Three hours later, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) started watching the system. Thereafter, a dramatic increase in convection occurred over the northeast quadrant of the system.<ref name="JTWC ATCR">{{cite report|title=Annual Tropical Cyclone Report: 1985|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1985atcr.pdf|author2=Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=March 27, 2014|year=1986}}</ref> As such, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) started watching the system early on August&nbsp;16.<ref name="JMA">{{cite report|author=Japan Meteorological Agency|date=October 10, 1992|title=RSMC Best Track Data &ndash; 1980&ndash;1989|accessdate=March 26, 2014|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst8089.txt|format=[[.TXT]]}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] is the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the western Pacific Ocean.<ref name="Japan Meteorological Agency">{{cite web|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|title=Annual Report on Activities of the RSMC Tokyo &ndash; Typhoon Center 2000|date=February 2001|accessdate=March 26, 2014|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/AnnualReport/2000/Text/Text2000.pdf|page=3|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Several hours later, a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]] (TCFA) was issued, even though a [[Hurricane Hunter]] aircraft did not locate a [[atmospheric circulation|surface circulation]]. Early on August&nbsp;17, the TCFA was re-issued. That afternoon, the disturbance became more organized, with classifications via the [[Dvorak technique]] yielding winds of {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}. Based on this, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Nelson.<ref name=IBTRACS /> 

During the evening, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported a [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|989|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|disp=5}}; however, they noted that the strongest winds were {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} north-northwest from the center. Early on August&nbsp;18, data from another aircraft also noted that a [[subtropical ridge]] had extended west of Nelson; consequently, the JTWC correctly anticipated Nelson to move west-northwest.<ref name="JTWC ATCR" /> At midday, the JMA upgraded Nelson to a [[tropical cyclone scales|severe tropical storm]]. Subsequently, data from the JMA indicated that Nelson began to level off in intensity as the stronger winds remained displaced form the center.<ref name="JMA">{{cite report|author=Japan Meteorological Agency|date=October 10, 1992|title=RSMC Best Track Data &ndash; 1980&ndash;1989|accessdate=March 26, 2014|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst8089.txt|format=[[.TXT]]}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] is the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the western Pacific Ocean.<ref name="Japan Meteorological Agency"/>|group="nb"}} However, the JTWC upgraded Nelson to typhoon intensity following Hurricane Hunter reports of a {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], winds of {{convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on|disp=5}}, and a pressure of  {{convert|979|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.<ref name="JTWC ATCR" /> At 0000&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;20, the JMA estimated that Nelson attained typhoon strength, with winds of {{convert|130|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}.<ref name=IBTRACS /> Nearing Taiwan,<ref name=JMA /> Nelson once again held on to its intensity for 36 hours before strengthening slightly.<ref name=IBTRACS /> Late on August&nbsp;21, the JTWC announced that Nelson reached peak intensity, with {{convert|175|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}, equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the United States-based [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale]] (SSHWS).<ref name="JTWC ATCR" /> Early on August&nbsp;22, the JMA reported that Nelson attained peak winds of {{convert|140|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}.<ref name=IBTRACS />

Shortly after its peak, the storm weakened slightly thereafter as the typhoon passed between the [[Ryuku Islands]] of [[Yaeyama]] and [[Miyako-jima]].<ref name="JTWC ATCR" /> According to the JMA, the storm re-attained peak intensity at 0000&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;23. At this time, the agency assessed the pressure of the system at {{convert|955|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=JMA /> Shortly thereafter, Nelson skirted northern [[Taiwan]], passing {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} from [[Taipei]]. After entering the [[Formosa Strait]], the storm moved ashore southwest of [[Fuchou]] at 1400&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;23.<ref name="JTWC ATCR" /> At the time of landfall, the JMA estimated winds of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on|disp=5}}.<ref name=JMA /> By August&nbsp;25, both the JMA and JTWC had ceased tracking Nelson, as it had moved inland over China.<ref name="IBTRACS">{{cite report|author=Kenneth R.

==Preparations and impact==
===Taiwan===
Due to the threat of Nelson, a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|typhoon warning]] was issued for the island. After the storm battered the island, rail and street traffic in the northern part of the island was halted due to mudslides.<ref name=UPI1 /> Both [[Chiang Kai-shek International Airport]] and the [[Taipei Songshan Airport]] in [[Taipei]] were closed for about 12&nbsp;hours.<ref name=AP1 /> Approximately 900,000 families were left without electrical service<ref name=UPI2>{{cite news|title=International News|date=August 23, 1985|agency=United Press International}}</ref> and 100,000&nbsp;telephone lines were disrupted.
