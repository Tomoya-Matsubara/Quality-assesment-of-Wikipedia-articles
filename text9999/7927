The '''[[Television pilot|pilot]]''' episode of the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' premiered on [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] on [[October 16]], [[2001]].<ref name="tvg">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=100398&more=ucepisodelist|title=Smallville Episodes <nowiki>|</nowiki> TVGuide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> It was written by series creators [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], and directed by [[David Nutter]].<ref name="msntvpilot">{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/episode/smallville/pilot|title=Smallville <U+2013> 'Pilot' Episode Info <U+2013> MSN TV|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> The episode introduces the characters of [[Clark Kent]], an orphaned alien with superhuman abilities, and his friends and family who live in the fictional town of [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville, Kansas]]. It follows Clark as he first learns of his alien origins, and attempts to stop a vengeful student from killing the Smallville High School students. Using visual elements and dialogue, the episode introduces many themes that were designed to run either the course of the season or the entire series, such as the triangular relationships of the main characters.

Production was set in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]],<ref name="cbs">{{cite web|url=http://cw.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/thecw/original/castcrew?id=227&dpid=55|title=CBS PressExpress <U+2013> The CW-Shows|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> used for its "middle America" landscape, with five months devoted to casting the right actors in the lead roles.<ref name="genesis"/> Filming for the pilot officially began four days after the last actor was cast for the series. When time constraints would not allow the production crew to physically create the sets, [[computer-generated imagery]] was used to digitally insert set pieces into a scene.  When the series premiere aired, it broke several of The WB's viewership records. It was generally well received by critics, and was nominated for several awards, winning two.

==Plot==
The episode begins in 1989 when a [[meteor shower]] hits [[Smallville, Kansas]]; at the same time a small spacecraft, containing an alien boy, crashes in front of [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent's]] (played by [[John Schneider (television actor)|John Schneider]] and [[Annette O'Toole]]) truck. They adopt the superhumanly powerful child and name him Clark. Gough and Millar use this opening scene to establish that the three lead characters of the series, Clark, Lana and Lex, share a common bond<U+2014>they are all orphans: Clark is the only survivor of his home world; Lana's parents are killed in the meteor shower; and Lex is alienated from his father, [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), after being rendered bald by the meteor blast.<ref name="pilcom"/>

The episode jumps forward twelve years to when Clark ([[Tom Welling]]) is trying to find his identity. He is unable to handle being told of his alien origins and runs away from home.  Although he is in love with [[Lana Lang]] ([[Kristin Kreuk]]), he cannot get close to her without falling over in pain because she wears a necklace made of meteor rock ([[kryptonite]]). This was a concept Gough and Millar devised to establish a reason for Clark's clumsiness. In other mediums, it is usually portrayed as an act he puts on to deceive people of his true identity.<ref name="pilcom">{{cite video|title="Pilot" commentary by Al Gough, Miles Millar and David Nutter|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|date=2002}}</ref> But Clark and Lana do share an intimate moment at a cemetery, where Lana is visiting the grave of her parents. In such scenes, Gough and Millar created a theme of loneliness through the life stories of Clark and Lana.<ref name="pilcom"/> Lana's boyfriend, Whitney Fordman ([[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]]), becomes jealous of Clark and Lana's friendship and ties Clark to a [[scarecrow]] pole, using Lana's necklace, indirectly, to subdue Clark. This image of Clark, in just his [[Boxer shorts|underwear]] and a red "S" painted on his chest, stretches back to Gough and Millar's foundation for the show, which was about taking Clark down to the basic elements of the [[Superman]] character.<ref name="pilcom"/> [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, "...Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?"<ref name="Owen 3">{{cite news|author=[[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]]|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011014smallvilletv2.asp|title=Superman revisited in "Smallville"|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=[[2001-10-14]]|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>

In the second strand of the story, Lex and Clark develop a "[[yin and yang]]" relationship. Clark first saves Lex from drowning when they get into a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saves Clark when he is strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite.<ref name="metcom">{{cite video|title="Metamorphosis" commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|date=2002}}</ref> Jeremy Creek (Matthew Munn) kills the three former jocks who tied him to a scarecrow pole during the meteor shower. He sets out to kill everyone attending the school's dance, after witnessing Clark experience the same hazing he did, but Clark is able arrive in time to stop him. 

==Production==
===Casting===
Gough and Millar had five months for casting, but their primary focus was on finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They received Kristin Kreuk's audition tape for the role of Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network.<ref name="genesis">{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 1|year=2004|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|pages=8&ndash;17|isbn=1840237955}}</ref> Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity to be part of the show.<ref name="Tom">Simpson, pp.112&ndash;115.</ref> It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition.<ref name="pilcom"/> Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be "Superman in high school," something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script ''if'' he came in and auditioned. Afterward auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was "amazing."<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert Falconer|url=http://www.hollywoodnorthreport.com/article.php?Article=1323|title=Super-Natural: A Conversation with Tom Welling|publisher=Hollywood North Reporter|date=[[2005-05-30]]|accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had "great chemistry." No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor.<ref name="genesis"/> Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice,<ref name="Mike">Simpson, pp.120&ndash;123.</ref> and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing,<ref name="Mike"/> and performed so well that everyone agreed he was "the guy."<ref name="genesis"/>

John Schneider was brought in to play Jonathan Kent. Schneider was already well known as [[Bo Duke]] from ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', and Gough believed Schneider's experience from ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' added believability to the idea that he could have grown up running a farm. Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming everyone realized that she was not right for the role, including Ettinger.<ref name="genesis"/> Annette O'Toole, who previously portrayed Lana Lang in ''[[Superman III]]'',<ref name="Owen 3"/> and who was fresh off the recent cancellation of her television series ''[[The Huntress (TV series)|The Huntress]]'', was cast in Ettinger's place.<ref name="Annette">Simpson, pp.136&ndash;139.</ref>

Eric Johnson, after auditioning for the roles of Lex and Clark, was cast as Lana Lang's boyfriend Whitney Fordman. Johnson only spent one day filming his scenes for the pilot.<ref name="Eric">Simpson, pp.132&ndash;135.</ref> [[Allison Mack]] toyed with the idea of auditioning for the role of Lana Lang, but chose instead to audition for the role of [[Chloe Sullivan]].<ref name="Allison">Simpson, pp.128&ndash;131.</ref> The character was created just for the series,<ref name="genesis"/> and was intended to add [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] diversity to the cast.<ref name="Allison"/> Part of the reason she was cast was because Gough and Millar felt she had a "rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary [sic] dialogue conversationally."<ref name="genesis"/> [[Sam Jones III]], who plays Pete Ross, was the last of the series regulars to be cast. Gough and Millar saw Jones III four days before they began filming for the pilot. In the comics, [[Pete Ross]] is [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], and the producers chose to cast Jones III, who is [[African-American]], against the mythology.<ref name="Sam">Simpson, pp.124&ndash;127.</ref>

===Filming===
Once Warner Bros. Television secured the rights to the show, Gough and Millar set out to write the script and find a director for the pilot.<ref name="genesis"/> Gough and Millar were fans of director David Nutter's previous work; they considered him to be a "preeminent pilot director."<ref name="genesis"/> David Nutter joined the project because he wanted to make a pilot that respected the audience but that was still fun and smart. Nutter also believes in creating shows that appeal to a wide variety of audiences.<ref name="pilot">Simpson, pp.20&ndash;23.</ref> He wanted the final scene for the pilot, in which Clark fantasizes about dancing with Lana, to express the show's essence.<ref name="genesis"/> According to Welling, "It brings them close<U+2014>not as close as Clark would like, but at the end of [this] episode, he images that he's with her and can really see it happening."<ref name="Tom"/>

Production was initially slated to take place in Australia, but Vancouver, Canada had more of the "middle America" feel for which the creators were looking. The area offered a site for the Kent farm, including their barn, and the city itself doubled as [[Superman's Metropolis|Metropolis]]. Vancouver provided a cheaper shooting location, and was in the same [[time zone]] as [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref name="genesis"/> Filming began on in March 2001;<ref name="genesis"/> Nutter spent sixteen days on main unit filming, and an additional five days for [[Second unit director|second unit filming]]. Time constraints forced Nutter to film strictly from [[Adrien Van Viersen]]'s 150<U+2013>page [[Storyboard#Film|storyboard]] when filming the opening meteor shower scene.<ref name="pilcom">{{cite video|title="Pilot" commentary by Al Gough, Miles Millar and David Nutter|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|date=2002}}</ref>
Much of the look for ''Smallville'' came from Millar, who wanted the epitome of "Smalltown, USA." Construction coordinator Rob Maier explained, "It had to be cleaner than clean, nicer than nice, more beautiful than it would be in the real world. All of the people in Smallville are beautiful; all of the colors are bright and sharp." For the Kent farm, Nutter wanted to have "an old world sensibility and tone."<ref name="pilot"/> For the pilot, the production crew only built a kitchen and dinning room to represent the Kent home.<ref name="Meta">Simpson, pp.24&ndash;27.</ref> All the exterior shots of the farm were taken at the Andalinis farm, a local couple who also gave the crew permission to paint their [[forest green]] house [[yellow]].<ref name="tour">{{cite video|title=Interactive tour of Smallville|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|date=2002}}</ref> Since the Vancouver farm already had a barn, the production crew only had to build a loft with stairs leading up to it.<ref name="Meta"/>
[[Image:Hatley Castle front entrance Aug 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hatley Park National Historic Site|Hatley Castle]] provides the outside look of the [[Luthor Mansion|Luthor ancestral home]], but the interior was shot at Shannon Mews, in Vancouver<ref name="pilcom"/>]]
Exterior shots of the Luthor Mansion were shot at a castle in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], two hours west of Vancouver by ferry. Time constraints forced scenes, which were shot from multiple angles, to sometimes be shot at separate locations. A scene involving Whitney (Eric Johnson) and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) sitting on her porch was shot at two different locations. Close-ups of Whitney were shot under a football stadium, while close-ups of Lana were shot in a potato factory. Unable to shoot at the house being used as the Lang residence, the crew built Lana's front porch inside a [[sewage]] factory for the final scene of the episode where Lana walks up the stairs to her house.<ref name="pilcom"/> The local sewage factory is also the site for the LuthorCorp pesticide plant, which Lex was sent to Smallville to manage.<ref name="tour"/> The crash site of Clark's ship was shot at the sandpits where they filmed ''[[Mission to Mars]]''. Smallville's Main Street was filmed in both the town of [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]], which is three hours east of [[Vancouver]], and in the town of [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale]].<ref name="pilcom"/> Most of the filming took place in Cloverdale, since the town had a long stretch of vacant buildings that could double as Smallville's Main Street. When the production crew came to film the opening teaser, they had to decorate the town with ribbons and balloons, as well as paint some of the buildings to attain Millar's idea of "Smalltown, USA."<ref name="tour"/> Two sets were built just for the pilot. The Kent storm cellar was built as a cover set inside the farm's barn. For the cemetery scene between Clark and Lana, production designer Bernard Hides built the entire cemetery from scratch in an empty field.<ref name="pilcom"/>

===Effects===
On-set [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] for the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening sequence showing the destruction of the [[water tower]] by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in [[Kansas]], this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse for the pilot, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no [[maize|cornfields]] in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from [[Arizona]]. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge, and hits Clark, the stuntman, who doubled as [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in the film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.<ref name="pilcom"/>

The pilot received favorable reviews upon its release. [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] of the [[Pittsburg]] ''Post-Gazette'' thought it was "[a] respectful addition to Superman lore . . . [and] has all the markings of a super series."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]]|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20010916tvweekp1.asp|title=Fall 2001: A mediocre TV odyssey|publisher=Post-Gazette|date=[[2001-09-16]]|accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref> Elizabeth White of ''Media Life'' believed the show had potential to be a big hit for The WB, but felt it needed to survive not only its time slot<U+2014>Tuesdays at 9:00 [[12-hour clock|p.m.]] ([[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|EST]])<U+2014>but also the audience's expectations of "what Superman should be."<ref name="RobOwen">{{cite news|author=Rob Owen|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011129owen1129p3.asp|title=Tuned In: It's time to revisit the season's new shows|publisher=Post Gazette|date=[[2001-11-29]]|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref><ref name="Liz"/> ''[[USA Today]]'''s Robert Bianco was a bit more mixed in his criticism. Bianco stated, "For all its innovations, there's also something rehashed and repetitive about ''Smallville''... shows often look more familiar at the outset than they do as they progress. There's talent and intelligence at work in ''Smallville''. Given time, maybe they'll find a more distinctive voice."<ref name="Bianco">{{cite news|author=Robert Bianco|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2001-10-16-smallville-review.htm|title='Smallville' has a good chance of flying high|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=[[2001-10-16]]|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Jeremy Conrad, from ''[[IGN]]'', swore to himself that he would never watch ''Smallville'', because he was a "huge Superman fan" and he did not like the idea the creators would be making changes to the Superman mythology. After viewing the pilot, Conrad stated, "It's a very solid start to the series, and one of the better pilot episodes I've seen in a while."<ref name="IGN">{{cite news|author=Jeremy Conrad|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/364/364292p1.html|title=Smallville (Pilot Episode)|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2002-07-09]]|accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> In ''[[The Futon Critic]]'s'' 50 best episodes of 2001 rankings, the pilot was placed 31st, with [[Brian Ford Sullivan]] stating, "''Smallville'' opened us to a surprisingly fresh take on the Superman myth-this time showing us the humble beginnings of a young Clark Kent."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Brian Ford Sullivan]]|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/rant.aspx?id=20020102|title=The 50 Best Episodes Of 2001-#40-31|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=[[2002-01-02]]|accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref>
