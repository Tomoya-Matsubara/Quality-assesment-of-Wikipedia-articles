The '''Millennium Stadium''' ({{lang-cy|Stadiwm y Mileniwm}}) is the [[national stadium]] of [[Wales]], located in the capital [[Cardiff]].  It is the home of the [[Wales national rugby union team]] and the [[Wales national football team]] but is also host to many other events and sports, such as [[Wales Rally Great Britain]] stage of the [[World Rally Championship]], [[Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain]], [[boxing]] and many music concerts, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Tsunami Relief Cardiff|Tsunami Relief concert]]. 

The stadium opened in June 1999,<ref name="Date"/> with the first major event being held on 26 June 1999, when [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] beat [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in a rugby [[friendly match]] by 29-19, before a test crowd of 29,000.<ref name="Opened"/> It is the largest stadium in the world with a fully [[retractable roof]] and was only the second stadium in Europe to have this facility.<ref name="Rectractable roof"/><ref name="Millennium Stadium"/>  At the time of its construction it was the largest stadium in the [[United Kingdom]] with a capacity of 74,500,<ref name="Information"/> but has since been overtaken by [[Twickenham Stadium]] and the new [[Wembley Stadium]]. It is the fourth largest stadium in the [[Six Nations Championship]] behind [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], [[Stade de France]] and [[Croke Park]], which is the largest.

The Millennium Stadium is owned by Millennium Stadium plc which is a [[subsidiary company]] of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] (WRU).<ref name="Rugby Union">{{cite web |url= http://www.wru.co.uk/809_14196.php|publisher= Welsh Rugby Union Limited|title= About Millennium Stadium plc |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> The total construction cost of the stadium was GB<U+00A3>121 million,<ref name="cost"/> of which the [[Millennium Commission]] funded GB<U+00A3>46m.<ref name="Lottery"/>   

==History==

===Background===

Until 1969, [[Cardiff RFC]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] both played their home matches on the same pitch, but all this would change in the 1969-70 season.<ref name="Development">{{cite journal |last= Harris [[CBE]] LLD (Hons)|first= Kenneth M|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= ''The Story of the Development of the National Rugby Ground'' 7 April 1984| |year= 1984 |publisher= [[Welsh Rugby Union]] |location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result of an agreement between [[Cardiff Athletic Club]] and the WRU, the [[Cardiff Arms Park#The National Stadium|National Stadium]] project had established that a new stadium for international matches was required, with Cardiff rugby fixtures switching to the original cricket ground on the [[Cardiff Arms Park]] site.<ref name="Development"/>  By 7 April&nbsp;1984 the National Stadium was officially opened.  However in 1994, a redevelopment committee was set up to consider redeveloping the National Stadium, and by 1995 the WRU had been chosen to host the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]].<ref name="Stadia"/>

[[Image:The National Stadium The Arms Park Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|The National Stadium]]
 
In 1995, the National Stadium, which was designed in 1962,<ref name="Development"/> only had a capacity of 53,000, other nations stadia, such as [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] (England) with a capacity of 82,000 and [[Murrayfield Stadium]] (Scotland) with a capacity of 67,000 had overtaken it.  France was also about to build the [[Stade de France]], which would have a capacity of over 80,000 for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name="Stadia"/>  The original capacity of the National Stadium was 65,000, but this had been reduced to 53,000, for safety reasons.  11,000 of 53,000 capacity was on the East [[Terrace (stadium)|Terrace]] and the conversion to an [[all-seater]] stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to just 47,500.<ref name="Stadia"/>  

In addition to the problems of capacity, the National Stadium was also very well hidden by the neighbouring buildings to the south in Park Street, Wood Street and to the east in Westgate Street, and also by Cardiff Rugby Ground in the north.  It was only fully visible from across the [[River Taff]] in the west.  Access to the ground was also very restricted with the main entrance being a narrow opening in Westgate Street to the east which was shared by both vehicles and spectators alike.<ref name="Stadia">{{cite web |url= http://www.panstadia.com/vol3/33-022.htm|publisher= PanStadia International|title= In the heart of the city |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref>  
  
The options for the new stadium included; adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted because it would have required a vast car parking facility and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution.<ref name="Stadia"/>  The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity.  It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south.  This was the option supported by the [[Millennium Commission]].  It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site.<ref name="Millennium Stadium">{{cite web |url= http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3557.php |publisher=Millennium Stadium plc |title= About Millennium Stadium |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref>  It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football (soccer).<ref name="Stadia"/>  The only other sliding roof in Europe at the time was at the [[Amsterdam ArenA|Amsterdam Arena]], with a capacity of 50,000.<ref name="Millennium Stadium"/>

In order to remain on the Arms Park site, additional space had to be found to allow safe access and to provide room for the increased capacity and improved facilities. This was achieved by the purchase of adjacent buildings to the south and east and by the construction of a new River Walk by the [[River Taff]] on the west side of the stadium.  

By 1999 the Millennium Stadium had replaced the National Stadium, Cardiff Arms Park, as the national stadium of Wales for rugby union and association football international matches. Cardiff RFC continued as before to play at Cardiff Arms Park rugby ground, which had replaced the cricket ground in 1969.<ref name="Cardiff rugby">{{cite web |url= http://site.cardiff-rfc.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=68 |publisher= www.Cardiff RFC|title= CRFC History |accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref><ref name="Development"/>

}}

Construction involved the demolish of a number of buildings, primarily the existing National Stadium (Cardiff Arms Park), Wales Empire Pool in Wood Street, Cardiff Empire Telephone Exchange building (owned by [[BT Group|BT]]) in Park Street, the newly built [[Territorial Army|Territorial Auxiliary & Volunteer Reserve]] building, also in Park Street and the [[Department of Social Security|Social Security]] offices in Westgate Street.<ref name="Millennium Stadium"/><ref name="BBC Wales">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/436549.stm |publisher= BBC |title= Two years - and one awesome stadium |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref>
 
The stadium was built by [[John Laing plc]], the head of construction was Steve Ager,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/442978.stm |publisher= BBC |title= Cardiff stadium 'financial disaster'|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> in 1999 on the site of the National Stadium. It was built for the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]], for which Wales was the main host.<ref name="Millennium Stadium"/> It was home to seven of the 41 matches, including the final.

The total construction cost of the stadium was <U+00A3>121 million,<ref name="cost">{{cite web |url= http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3880 |publisher=Cardiff Council |title= The Economic Impact of the Millennium Stadium |accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref> which was funded by private investment and GB<U+00A3>46 million of public funds from the Millennium Commission,<ref name="Lottery">{{cite web |url= http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=1517|publisher= Millennium Commission  |title= Millennium projects open in Wales and Northern Ireland |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> the sale of [[debenture]]s to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and [[loan]]s. The development left the WRU heavily in [[debt]].

The Millennium Stadium was first used for a major event on 26 June 1999, when Wales played South Africa in a rugby union [[friendly match]] before a test crowd of 29,000. Wales won the match 29-19: the first time they had ever beaten the Springboks.<ref name="Opened">{{cite web |url=http://www.newswales.co.uk/?section=Sport&F=1&id=7122 |title=Millennium Stadium celebrates fifth anniversary |date=[[2004-06-25]] |publisher=NewsWales }}</ref>

==Features==

The all-seater stadium has the capacity for 74,500 supporters and features a retractable roof,<ref name="Information"/> only the second stadium in [[Europe]], and the largest stadium by capacity in the world, with this feature to protect the playing surface from the elements.<ref name="Rectractable roof">{{cite web |url= http://www.britannia.com/celtic/wales/facts/facts7.html|publisher= Britannia.com, LLC|title=Fact About Wales and the Welsh (40. Cardiff has the world's largest retractable-roof arena)|accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref>  Additional seating is sometimes added for special events such as a rugby Test against the [[All Blacks]], or formerly for the [[FA Cup Final]]. The current record attendance is 75,100, recorded at Wales' 30<U+2013>15 victory over [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] in the [[2008 Six Nations Championship]] on 9 February 2008.<ref name="Record">{{cite web |url=http://www.wru.co.uk/63_16846.php |title=Wales 30 Scotland 15 |accessdate=2008-03-20 |date=[[2008-02-09]] |publisher=wru.co.uk}}</ref>

[[Image:Inside the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|South Stand with the previous name of the stand "Hyder", blanked out with white seats]]

The four ends of the ground are called; the North Stand, the West Stand, the South Stand and the BT Stand (east).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3564.php|publisher= Millennium Stadium plc|title= Millennium Stadium Information (Millennium Stadium Seating Plan)|accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref> The South Stand was previously known as the Hyder Stand,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/cardiff2.htm|publisher= Liverpoolfc.tv Ltd|title= Hyder Stand South|accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref> until [[Hyder (defunct company)|Hyder plc]] was sold. The stadium has 3 tiers of seating with the exception of the North Stand, which has 2 tiers. The lower tier holds approximately 23,500 spectators, the middle tier holding 18,000 and the upper tier holding 33,000 spectators.<ref name="Information"/> 

The stadium was slightly restricted in size due to its proximity to Cardiff Rugby Club's home in the adjacent smaller stadium within Cardiff Arms Park. The WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the new stadium, and the [[Millennium Commission]] would not allow any of its funds to be used in any way for the construction of a new stadium for Cardiff RFC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=o0BsU6JbpYAC&pg=PR9&dq=national+lottery+commission+Millennium+stadium+for+the+construction+of+the+club+ground.&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=0_1&sig=ACfU3U2vgwZWq84tb9X_fC20S3dwm5W2KA#PPA224,M1|publisher= Taylor & Francis, 1998 & Google Books|title= Stadia, Arenas and Grandstands By P. Thompson, J. J. A. Tolloczko, Jean Benedetti, J. N. Clarke, Concrete Society |accessdate=2008-09-04}}</ref>  The WRU held talks with [[Cardiff RFC|CRFC]] Ltd to see if it would be possible for the club to either move or secure funding for the [[Cardiff Arms Park]] to be re-developed, but these were unsuccessful.  The stadium thus had to be completed with a break in its bowl structure in the North Stand, known colloquially as Glanmor's Gap, after [[Glanmor Griffiths]], then chairman of the WRU and now a former president.<ref name="President">{{cite web |url= http://www.wru.co.uk/809_14159.php |publisher=Welsh Rugby Union Ltd |title= Presidents of the WRU |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref>

[[Image:Gilmor's Gap Millennium Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|Glanmor's Gap, North Stand]]

The [[superstructure]] of the stadium is based around four {{convert|90.3|m|adj=on}} masts. The stadium was built from 56,000 tonnes of concrete and steel, and has 128 hospitality boxes,<ref name="Information">{{cite web |url=http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3559.php|publisher=Millennium Stadium plc|title= About Millennium Stadium|accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref> 22 bars, 7 restaurants, 17 first aid points, 12 escalators and 7 lifts.<ref name="BBC Millennium">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1100390.stm |publisher= BBC |title= BBC Sport Online's Mark Barden looks at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref>  The stadium has 7 gates for access to the site; Gate 1 is from the River Walk via Castle Street (to the north), Gates 2 and 3 are via Westgate Street (to the east), Gate 4 is for Security only also via Westgate Street, Gate 5 is via Park Street (to the south) and Gates 6 and 7 are via the Millennium Plaza (also to the south).<ref name="Gates">{{cite web |url= http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3564.php|publisher= Millennium Stadium plc|title= Stadium Location Content|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>

Cardiff RFC Ltd reached a Heads of Terms agreement with [[Cardiff City Football Club]] and [[Cardiff County Council]] to move the [[Cardiff Blues]] to the [[new Cardiff City stadium]] at the start of the 2009-10 season.  Despite the revelation that the South Stand of [[Cardiff Arms Park]] and therefore the adjoining North Stand of the Millennium Stadium has [[concrete cancer]], the old structure has an expected working life until 2020. However, it is acknowledged that major rebuilding work will be required at this end of the Millennium Stadium within the next 30 years. This opens the door to the possibility of the stadium expanding by taking over the site of Cardiff RFC, who will be forced to vacate due to the demolition work, if they haven't done so already. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0200wales/tm_headline=millennium-stadium-has-concrete-cancer%26method=full%26objectid=19422108%26siteid=50082-name_page.html |title=Concrete cancer strikes stadium |accessdate=2007-08-24 |last=Bevan |first=Nathan |date=[[2007-07-08]] |publisher=Wales On Sunday }}</ref>

In each of the stadium's bars, so-called "joy machines" can pour 12 pints in less than 20 seconds. During a Wales Vs France match, 63,000 fans drank 77,184 pints of [[beer]], almost double the 44,000 pints drunk by a similar number of fans at a game at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]].<ref name="Visit Cardiff">{{cite web |url= http://www.visitwales.ie/upload/pdf/48hours.pdf |publisher= The Visitwales Centre |title= 48 hours in Cardiff|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> The stadium has a resident [[hawk]] named "Dad", who is employed to drive seagulls and pigeons out of the stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.millenniumstadium.com/197_9910.php|title = Millennium Stadium Hawk Takes A Break|date = 2007-03-22|publisher = Millennium Stadium}}</ref>

===Rugby league===
The Millennium Stadium has hosted 3 of rugby league's [[Rugby League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]] Finals, one of the biggest annual showpiece events the UK's sporting calendar.

Also, in 2007 the stadium hosted the inaugural [[Magic Weekend|Millennium Magic]] weekend.  This was a 2-day event in May when an entire round of [[Super League (Europe)|Super League]] matches were played, 3 games on the Saturday and 3 games on the Sunday.  The event was deemed a success by the sport's governing body, the [[Rugby Football League|RFL]], and 2nd Millennium Magic event took place in May 2008, although the 2009 event has now has been moved to Murrayfield Stadium.

===Association football===

Since 2000, the stadium has also been the almost-permanent home of Welsh football. The [[Wales national football team|national]] team play the vast majority of home matches at the Millennium Stadium, with a handful of [[Exhibition game|friendly matches]] once or twice a year at the [[Racecourse Ground|Racecourse Ground, Wrexham]] or [[Liberty Stadium, Swansea]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/7571023.stm|publisher= BBC|title= 'Old' stadium claims world record |accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dragonsoccer.co.uk/matches/fr_00022.htm |publisher= www.dragonsoccer.co.uk|title= Wales v Bulgaria - Friendly. - Liberty Stadium Swansea.

Whilst the Millennium Stadium was under construction, the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|1923 Wembley Stadium]] had hosted the Welsh rugby team during the building of the new ground. The favour was returned from 2001 whilst England's national stadium, [[Wembley Stadium]] was undergoing rebuilding, with the Millennium hosting:
