In the days immediately following the earthquakes, while the university's [[Ilam, New Zealand|Ilam]] campus was closed to enable the buildings to be checked for structural safety, 21-year-old Johnson and other students formed informal groups to help to assist with non-lifesaving tasks, in particularly cleaning up [[soil liquefaction]] residue on the streets and gardens of the city. Johnson and the other members of the Student Volunteer Army were highly visible and featured in much of the news reporting of the earthquake.

In 2011 Johnson won a [[Peter Blake (yachtsman)|Sir Peter Blake]] leadership award.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sirpeterblaketrust.org/leadership/awards/2011_awards/#Sam-Johnson |title=2011 Special Leadership Awardee: Sam Johnson  |work=sirpeterblaketrust.org |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10735777 |title=Sir Peter Blake awards: Sam Johnson |work=nzherald.co.nz |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>
