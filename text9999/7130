'''Artur''' is a cognate to the common male given name [[Arthur]], meaning "[[bear]]-like," which is believed to possibly be descended from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] surname [[Artorius]] or the [[Celt]]ic bear-goddess [[Artio]] or more probably from the Celtic word ''artos'' ("bear"). Other Celtic languages have similar first names, such as [[Irish language|Old Irish]] ''Art, Art<U+00FA>ur'',  [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Arth'' - which may also be the source for the modern name.
''Art'' is also a diminutive form of the common name Arthur. In many Slavic, Romance, and Germanic languages the name is spelled as Artur. The Finnish versions are Arttu and Artturi.
