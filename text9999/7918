In her second film, director [[Cameron Crowe]]'s semi-autobiographical ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000), Deschanel played Anita Miller, the protagonist's rebellious older sister. The film received critical praise,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/almost_famous/ |title=Almost Famous&nbsp;<U+2014> Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures&nbsp;<U+2014> Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes<! |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}</ref> but was not a box office success.

In late 2002, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Deschanel was "one of Hollywood's most sought-after young stars,"<ref name="nite"/> and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in early 2003 that Deschanel had become a recognizable [[typecasting (acting)|type]], due to "her deadpan, sardonic and scene-stealing [film] performances" as the protagonist's best friend.<ref name="lat"/> Deschanel objected to her typecasting, arguing, "A lot of these roles are just a formula idea of somebody's best friend, and it's like, I don't even have that many friends. In high school, I stayed home all the time, so I don't know how I'm everybody's best friend now."<ref name="lat"/>

Deschanel appeared in ''[[Frasier]]'', starring as Roz's out-of-control cousin, Jen, in the [[Frasier (Season 10)|season 10]] episode "Kissing Cousin" in 2002.
