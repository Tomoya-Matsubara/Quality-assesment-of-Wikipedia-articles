'''Pallas's cat''' (''Otocolobus manul''), also called the '''manul''', is a small wild [[Felidae|cat]] having a broad but patchy distribution in the grasslands and montane steppe of [[Central Asia]]. The species is negatively affected by habitat degradation, prey base decline, and hunting, and has therefore been classified as ''[[Near Threatened]]'' by [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] since 2002.<ref name=iucn>{{IUCN |assessors=Ross, S., Murdoch, J., Mallon, D., Sanderson, J., Barashkova, A. |year=2008 |id=15640 |taxon=Otocolobus manul |version=2011.2}}</ref>

Pallas<U+2019>s cat was named after the [[German people|German]] [[naturalist]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]], who first described the species in 1776 under the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] ''Felis manul''.<ref name=Pallas>Pallas, P. S. (1811). [http://www.archive.org/stream/zoographiarossoa11831pall#page/20/mode/2up ''Felis Manul''].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Pallas Cat.jpg|thumb|left|The ears are set low and wide apart]]
Pallas's cat is about the size of a [[domestic cat]], its body is {{convert|46|to|65|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and its tail is {{convert|21|to|31|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. It weighs {{convert|2.5|to|4.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The combination of its stocky posture and long, dense [[fur]] makes it appear stout and plush. Its fur is [[ochre]] with dark vertical bars on the torso and forelegs. The winter coat is greyer and less patterned than the summer coat. There are clear black rings on the tail and dark spots on the forehead. The cheeks are white with narrow black stripes running from the corners of the eyes. The chin and throat are also white, merging into the greyish, silky fur of the underparts. Concentric white and black rims around the eyes accentuate their rounded shape. The legs are proportionately shorter than those of other cats, the ears are set very low and wide apart, and it has unusually short claws. The face is shortened compared with other cats, giving it a flattened face. The pupils are circular. The shorter jaw has fewer teeth than is usual among felids, with the first pair of upper [[premolar]]s being absent.<ref name=WCoW>{{cite book|author=Sunquist, Mel|author2=Sunquist, Fiona|year=2002|title= Wild cats of the World |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago |pages= 219<U+2013>224|isbn= 0-226-77999-8}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
Pallas's cats are native to the [[steppe]] regions of [[Central Asia]], where they inhabit elevations of up to {{convert|5050|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Tibetan Plateau]].<ref>Fox, J. L. and Dorji, T. (2007). ''High elevation record for occurrence of the manul or Pallas cat on the northwestern Tibetan plateau, China''. Cat News 46: 35.</ref> They inhabit [[Mongolia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kashmir]], and occur across much of [[western China]]. They are also found in the [[Transbaikal]] regions of Russia, and less frequently in the [[Altai Republic|Altai]], [[Tyva]], and [[Buryatia]] Republics.<ref name = iucn/> In 1997, they were reported for the first time as being present in the eastern [[Sayan Mountains]].<ref>Koshkarev, E. (1998). ''Discovery of manul in eastern Sayan.'' Cat News 29: 12<U+2013>13.</ref>

Until the early 1970s, only two Pallas's cats were recorded in the [[Transcaucasus]], both encountered near the [[Araks River]] in southeastern [[Armenia]], but no records existed from [[Azerbaijan]].<ref name="Geptner1972">Geptner, V.

Three subspecies are recognized:<ref name=msw3/>
* ''O. m. manul'' (Pallas, 1776) <U+2014> inhabits the northern part of the range: from Jida River south of [[Lake Baikal]] to eastern [[Siberia]];<ref name=ems66>Ellerman, J. R., Morrison-Scott, T. C. S. (1966). [http://www.archive.org/stream/checklistofindia00elle#page/308/mode/2up ''Checklist of Palaearctic and Indian mammals 1758 to 1946'']. Second edition. British Museum of Natural History, London.</ref>
* ''O. m. nigripecta'' ([[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Hodgson]], 1842) <U+2014> inhabits [[Tibet]] and Indian [[Kashmir]];<ref name=ems66/>
* ''O. m. ferruginea'' ([[Sergej Ognew|Ognev]], 1928) <U+2014> inhabits the south-western part of the range: the mountain ridge of Missanev, [[Kopet-Dag]] Mountains, [[Transcaspia]], south-western [[Turkestan]], northern Iran, [[Baluchistan]] and Afghanistan.<ref name=ems66/>

==Ecology and behaviour==
[[Image:Manul2.jpg|left|thumb|Pallas's cat at the [[Zurich Zoo]]]]
Pallas's cats are solitary. Both males and females [[scent mark]] their territory. They spend the day in caves, rock crevices, or [[marmot]] burrows, and emerge in the late afternoon to begin hunting. They are not fast runners, and hunt primarily by ambush or stalking, using low vegetation and rocky terrain for cover. They feed largely on [[diurnality|diurnally]] active prey species such as [[gerbil]]s, [[pika]]s, [[vole]]s and [[chukar partridge]]s, and sometimes catch young marmots.<ref name=WCoW/>

===Reproduction===
The breeding season is relatively short due to the extreme climate in the cat's native range. [[Oestrus]] lasts between 26 and 42 hours, which is also shorter than in many other felids. Pallas's cats give birth to a litter of around two to six kittens after a [[gestation]] period of 66 to 75 days, typically in April or May. Such large litters may compensate for a high rate of infant mortality in the harsh environment. The young are born in sheltered dens, lined with dried vegetation, feathers, and fur. The kittens weigh around {{convert|90|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth, and have a thick coat of fuzzy fur, which is replaced by the adult coat after around two months. They are able to begin hunting at four months, and reach adult size at six months. Pallas's cats have been reported to live up to 11 years in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/>

==Threats==
[[File:WhfPallasCat.JPG|thumb|Female manul: Note the "pinhole" shape of its contracted [[pupil]].]]
The manul has long been hunted for its fur in relatively large numbers in [[China]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Russia]], although international trade in manul pelts has largely ceased since the late 1980s.<ref>Nowell, K., Jackson, P. (1996) [http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/catsgportal/cat-website/catfolk/manul-1.htm Manul Octobulus manul (Pallas, 1776)] In: Wild Cats: status survey and conservation action plan. IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, Gland, Switzerland</ref> About 1,000 hunters of Pallas's cats are in Mongolia, with a mean estimated harvest of two cats per year. They are also shot because they can be mistaken for [[marmot]]s, which are commonly hunted, and trapped incidentally in leghold traps set for wolves and foxes and snares set for marmots and [[hare]]s. Their fat and organs are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia, and they are killed by domestic dogs. While Mongolia has not recorded any trophy exports, skin exports have grown since 2000, with 143 reported exported in 2007.<ref name = iucn/>

==Conservation==
''Otocolobus manul'' is listed in [[CITES Appendix II]]. Hunting of this felid is prohibited in all range countries except Mongolia, where it has no legal protection despite being classified as Near Threatened in the country. Since 2009, the felid is legally protected in Afghanistan, banning all hunting and trade in its parts within the country<ref name = iucn/> and is listed as an endangered species in [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]].{{cn|date=June 2014}}

===In captivity===
In 2010, there were 47 Pallas<U+2019>s cats in 19 institutions that are members of the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]], and four litters were expected. No births and three deaths occurred in 2009. Pallas<U+2019>s cats have the highest percentage of 30-day mortality of any small cat at 44.9%. The seasonality of their reproduction makes it difficult to control reproductive cycles.<ref>Bray, S. (2010). [http://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/AZA/FelidTAG/Newsletter/2010May.pdf ''Pallas<U+2019> Cat PMP''] . Felid TAG Times: 3.</ref> Keeping Pallas's cats healthy in captivity is difficult. They breed well, but survival rates are low owing to infections, which are attributed to an underdeveloped [[immune system]]. In their natural high-altitude habitat, they would normally not be exposed to [[virus]]es causing infection.<ref>{{cite web |author=Smith, S.|title = Himalayan kitten at park |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7609351.stm |format = Video |publisher=BBC News |year=2008}}</ref>

In June 2010, five kittens were born in the [[Red River Zoo]] in Fargo.<ref>{{cite web |author=Associated Press|title = ND zoo officials boast litter of 5 Pallas kitten | url=http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/37441/ | publisher=WDAY News |date= August 2010}}</ref>
A female was [[Artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] for the first time at [[Cincinnati Zoo]], and gave birth to three kittens in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web |author=CREW|title = Pallas' cats born from artificial insemination |url=http://cincinnatizoo.org/blog/2011/06/23/pallas%E2%80%99-cats-born-from-artificial-insemination |publisher= Cincinnati Zoo<U+2019>s Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife |date=June 2011}}</ref>
In May 2013, three kittens were born in the [[Nordens Ark]] in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bohusl<U+00E4>ningen|title = pallaskatterna har f<U+00E5>tt ungar | url=http://bohuslaningen.se/nyheter/sotenas/1.2251740-pallaskatterna-har-fatt-ungar | publisher=Bohusl<U+00E4>ningen |date= June 2013}}</ref>

==Taxonomic history==
Pallas's cat was initially placed in the genus ''[[Felis]]''.<ref name=Pallas/> In 1858, the Russian explorer and naturalist [[Nikolai Severtzov]] proposed the name ''Otocolobus'' for the species.<ref>Severtzow, M. N. (1858). [http://www.archive.org/stream/revueetmagasinde10soci#page/386/mode/2up ''Notice sur la classification multis<U+00E9>riale des Carnivores, sp<U+00E9>cialement des F<U+00E9>lid<U+00E9>s, et les <U+00E9>tudes de zoologie g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale qui s'y rattachent''].

X S<U+00E9>ptembre 1858: 386.</ref> The zoologist [[Reginald Innes Pocock]] recognized the [[taxonomic classification]] of ''Otocolobus'' in 1907, described several skulls in detail, and considered the manul being an aberrant form of ''Felis''.<ref>Pocock, R. I. (1907).

Following [[genetics|genetic]] studies, the [[monotypic genus]] ''Otocolobus'' has been proposed to be placed with the genera ''Felis'' and ''[[Prionailurus]]'' in the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] ''Felini'', because of a close [[phylogenetic]] relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson, W., Eizirik, E., Pecon-Slattery, J., Murphy, W.
