'''Portuguese India''' ({{lang-pt|<U+00CD>ndia Portuguesa}} or ''Estado da <U+00CD>ndia'') was the aggregate of [[Portugal]]'s colonial holdings in [[India]]. At the time of India's independence in [[1947]], Portuguese India included a number of [[enclave]]s on India's western coast, including [[Goa]] proper, as well as the coastal enclaves of [[Daman]] (Port: ''Dam<U+00E3>o'') and [[Daman and Diu|Diu]], and the enclaves of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], which lie inland from Daman. The territories of Portuguese India were sometimes referred to collectively as Goa.

==Early history==
[[Image:European settlements in India 1501-1739.png|thumb|right|400px|Portuguese and other European settlements in India.]]
The first Portuguese encounter with India was on [[May 20]] [[1498]] when [[Vasco da Gama]] landed in [[Calicut]] (present-day [[Kozhikode]]). Over the objections of [[Arab]] merchants, da Gama secured an ambiguous letter of concession for trading rights from [[Zamorin]], Calicut's local ruler, but had to sail off without warning after the Zamorin insisted on his leaving behind all his goods as collateral. Gama kept his goods, but left behind a few Portuguese with orders to start a trading post.

In 1510, Portuguese admiral [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] defeated the [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]] sultans on behalf of a local sovereign, Timayya, leading to the establishment of a permanent settlement in [[Velha Goa]] (or Old Goa). The Southern Province, also known simply as [[Goa]], was the headquarters of Portuguese India, and seat of the Portuguese [[viceroy]] who governed the Portuguese possessions in Asia.

The Portuguese acquired several territories from the Sultans of [[Gujarat]]: Daman (occupied [[1531]], formally ceded [[1539]]); [[Salsette]], [[Bombay]], and [[Ba<U+00E7>aim]] (occupied [[1534]]); and Diu (ceded [[1535]]). These possessions became the Northern Province of Portuguese India, which extended almost 100 km along the coast from Daman to [[Chaul]], and in places 30<U+2013>50 km inland. The province was ruled from the fortress-town of Ba<U+00E7>aim.  Bombay (present day [[Mumbai]]) was given to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in [[1661]] as part of the Portuguese Princess [[Catherine of Braganza]]'s dowry to [[Charles II of England]]. Most of the Northern Province was lost to the [[Maratha]]s in [[1739]], and Portugal acquired [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] in [[1779]].

==Inquisition==
The Portuguese set up a long program to convert the native population (mainly Hindus) by torture. It was much larger and endured for a longer period than the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. Thousands of citizens suffered horrors and execution and led to large portions of Goa being depopulated.See [[Goa Inquisition]]<ref>http://www.apol.net/dightonrock/inquisition_goa.htm  The Portuguese Inquisition in Goa  (1560-1812)</ref><ref>http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/mar/16gupta.htm  Kanchan Gupta, "Recall the Goa Inquisition to stop the Church from crying foul"</ref>  
Eventually, the Inquisition in Goa was banished in [[1812]] by royal decree, as a consequence of Napoleon's Iberian [[Peninsular_War#12|Peninsular campaign]].

==After India's independence==
After India's independence from the British in [[1947]], Portugal refused to accede to India's request to relinquish control of its Indian possessions. The decision given by the International Court of Justice at The Hague, regarding access to Dadra and Nagra Haveli, after it was invaded by Indian citizens, was an impasse<ref>http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idecisions/isummaries/ipoisummary600412.htm  International Court of Justice Case Summaries, Case Concerning Right of Passage Over
Indian Territory (Merits), Judgment of 12 April 1960</ref>.

From [[1954]], peaceful [[Satyagraha|Satyagrahis]] attempts from outside Goa at forcing the Portuguese to leave Goa were brutally suppressed.<ref>http://www.indiannavy.nic.in/bptobw.pdf  Rear Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM (Ret.), ''Blueprint to Bluewater, The Indian Navy, 1951-65''</ref>  Many revolts were quelled by the use of force and leaders eliminated or jailed. As a result, India closed its consulate (which had operated in Pangim since 1947) and imposed an economic embargo against the territories of Portuguese Goa. The Indian Government adopted a "wait and watch" attitude from 1955 to 1961 with numerous representations to the Portugese Salazar regime and attempts to highlight the issue before the international community.<ref>http://www.goacom.com/culture/history/history4.html  Lambert Mascarenhas, "Goa's Freedom Movement," excerpted from Henry Scholberg, Archana Ashok Kakodkar and Carmo Azevedo, ''Bibliography of Goa and the Portuguese in India'' New Delhi, Promilla (1982)</ref>  Eventually, in December [[1961]], India militarily invaded Goa, Daman and Diu.  They met with little Portuguese resistance.<ref>http://gpp.nic.in/Liberation.html  Government Polytechnic of Goa, "Liberation of Goa"</ref><ref>http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1960s/Goa.html  ' "The Liberation of Goa: 1961" ''Bharat Rakshak, a Consortium of Indian Military Websites,'</ref>  Portuguese armed forces had been instructed to either defeat the invaders or die, and though a cease-fire was decreed, an official truce was never signed. <ref>http://dn.sapo.pt/2007/01/08/nacional/invasao_goa_ilegal_ilegitima_e_contr.html  Fernando Zamith, "Invas<U+00E3>o de Goa foi 'ilegal, ileg<U+00ED>tima e contra os direitos humanos'", ''Diario de Noticias''</ref> The meager resistance offered was due to the fact that the Portuguese army was poorly armed and comprised of about 3,300 men, against a fully armed, British-trained Indian force of over 30,000 with full Air and Naval support.<ref>http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1960s/Goa01.html  Jagan Pillarisetti, "The Liberation of Goa: 1961"  ''Bharat Rakshak, a Consortium of Indian Military Websites''</ref> <ref>http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/goa/geography-and-history/liberation-of-goa.html  Liberation of Goa, ''Maps of India''</ref>.  The territories were annexed to India on 19 December 1961.

The [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] regime in Portugal refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over Goa, Daman and Diu, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly  until [[1974]]. Following the [[Carnation Revolution]] that year, the new government in [[Lisbon]] restored diplomatic relations with India, and recognized Indian sovereignty over Goa, Daman and Diu. However, due to the military takeover, and since the wishes of the people of Portuguese India were never taken into consideration (as required by UN Resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960 on [[Self determination|"the right to self-determination"]] <ref>http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/152/88/IMG/NR015288.pdf?OpenElement  United Nations, General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960 (Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples)</ref> -- see also UN Resolutions 1541 and 1542 <ref>http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/15/ares15.htm  United Nations, General Assembly, Resolutions 1541 (XV) and 1542 (XV)</ref>), the people continue to have the right to Portuguese citizenship.  However, since 2006, this has been restricted to those born during Portuguese rule.

== Postage stamps and postal history ==
Early [[postal history]] of the colony is obscure, but regular [[mail]] is known to have been exchanged with [[Lisbon]] from [[1825]] on. Portugal having a [[postal convention]] with [[Great Britain]], much mail was probably routed through [[Bombay]] and carried on British [[packet]]s. Portuguese [[handstamp]]ed [[postmark]]s are known from [[1854]].

The first [[postage stamp]]s were issued [[1 October]] [[1871]]. These were purely local, and stamps of [[British India]] were also needed for overseas mail. The design of these first stamps simply consisted of a denomimation in the center, with an oval band containing the inscriptions "SERVI<U+00C7>O POSTAL" and "INDIA POST". The dies were recut several times, and printed on several kinds of paper, resulting in an extremely complicated situation that has been intensively studied; about 55 types have been identified as appearing between 1871 and 1877, some of them quite rare.

In [[1877]], Portugal included India in its standard "crown" issue, with nine values ranging from 5r to 300r. These stamps ran out in [[1881]], and the old local stamps were [[surcharge]]d with various values, resulting in nearly 100 distinct types. Additional "crown" stamps arrived in [[1882]], but in the following year were supplemented by additional values of the original local design.

From [[1886]] on, the pattern of regular stamp issues followed that of the other colonies closely, the main exception being a series of surcharges in [[1912]] produced by perforating existing stamps vertically through the middle and overprinting a new value on each side.

In [[1925]], a [[commemorative stamp]] marked the 400th anniversary of the death of [[Vasco da Gama]], and in December [[1931]] a set of six promoted the [[Exposition of St. Francis Xavier]] held at Goa. Sets in [[1946]] and [[1948]] commemorated notable historical figures related to the colony. Portuguese India's first [[stamp exhibition]], in [[1952]], was commemorated with a pair of stamps, one reproducing the design of the first issue, the other depicting St. [[Francis Xavier]]. A [[definitive series]] in [[1956]] commemorated the 450th  anniversary of Portuguese settlements in India, and included portraits and maps of old forts, while a [[1959]] series depicted various coins.

The last regular issue was on [[25 June]] [[1960]], marking the 500th anniversary of the death of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. Stamps of India were first used [[29 December]] [[1961]], although the old stamps were accepted until [[5 January]] [[1962]]. Although Portugal continued to issue stamps for the lost colony, none of these were ever offered for sale in the colony's post offices, and are thus not considered valid stamps.
