'''Janet Damita Jo Jackson''' (born May 16, 1966) is an American recording artist and actress. Born in [[Gary, Indiana]] and raised in [[Encino, Los Angeles, California]], she is the youngest child of the [[Jackson family]] of musicians. She first performed on stage with her family beginning at the age of seven, and later started her career as an actress with the [[variety show|variety]] television series ''[[The Jacksons (TV series)|The Jacksons]]'' in 1976. She went on to star in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including ''[[Good Times]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.

At age sixteen in 1982, Jackson signed a recording contract with [[A&M Records|A&M]], releasing her self-titled debut album the same year. She faced criticism for her limited vocal range, and for being yet another member of the Jackson family to become a recording artist. Beginning with her third studio album ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' (1986), Jackson began a long-term collaboration with record producers [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. Her music with Jam and Lewis incorporated [[contemporary R&B]] with elements of [[Rapping|rap music]], [[sampling (music)|sample loop]], [[Swung note|triple swing]] and [[industrial music|industrial]] beats, which led to crossover appeal in [[popular music]]. In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation in her albums, choreography, music videos, and prominence on [[MTV]], Jackson was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics.

In 1991, she signed the first of two record-breaking, multi-million dollar recording contracts with [[Virgin Records]], which established her as one of the highest paid artists in the music industry. Her debut album under the Virgin label, ''[[janet.]]'' (1993), saw Jackson develop a public image as a [[sex symbol]] as she began to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in ''[[Poetic Justice (1993 film)|Poetic Justice]]''; since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the decade, Jackson was named the second most successful recording artist of the 1990s. ''[[All for You (album)|All for You]]'' (2001), became her fifth consecutive studio album to debut at number one the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts. In 2007, she changed labels, signing with the [[Island Def Jam Music Group]] and released her tenth studio album ''[[Discipline (Janet Jackson album)|Discipline]]'' the following year.

Jackson is ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine as one of the top ten [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] in the history of [[contemporary music]], having sold over 100 million albums worldwide.<ref name="Business Wire">Janet Jackson is one of the top ten selling artists in the history of contemporary music, ranked by Billboard magazine as the ninth most successful act in rock and roll history, and the second most successful female artist in pop music history, selling over 100 million albums worldwide. {{Citation |title=UOMO Producer Helps Propel Janet Jackson to #1 in the US| publisher=[[Business Wire]] |url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20080310005488&newsLang=en| date=2008-03-10}}</ref> The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] lists her as the eleventh [[List of best-selling music artists in the United States|best-selling]] female artist in the United States, with 26 million [[RIAA certification|certified]] albums.<ref>{{Citation | title = Top Selling Artists | publisher = [[Recording Industry Association of America]] | url = http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt | accessdate = 2008-09-03}}</ref> Jackson's longevity in the recording industry has rivaled that of several entertainers and her musical style and choreography have influenced a number of contemporary pop and R&B artists.

==Biography==
===1966<U+2013>1982: Early life and career===
Janet Jackson was born in [[Gary, Indiana]], the youngest of nine children, to [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine Esther]] ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Scruse) and [[Joseph Jackson|Joseph Walter Jackson]].<ref name="JJ by Cornwell">{{Citation | last = Cornwell | first = Jane| title = Janet Jackson | publisher = [[Carlton Books]] | year = 2002 | pages = 2, 10, 24 | isbn = 1842224646}}</ref> The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. By the time she was a toddler, her older brothers<U+2014>[[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] and [[Michael Jackson|Michael]]<U+2014>were performing music at nightclubs and theaters as [[The Jackson 5]]. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with [[Motown Records|Motown]], and by the end of the year they had recorded the first of four consecutive number one singles. The Jackson 5's success allowed the family to move to the [[Encino, Los Angeles, California|Encino]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1971, where they settled in a gated mansion called Hayvenhurst.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> Although born into a family of professional musicians, Jackson, whose love of horses resulted in a desire to become a race-horse [[horse jockey|jockey]], had no aspiration to become an entertainer. Despite this, her father planned for her to pursue a career in entertainment. Jackson once commented, "No one ever asked me if I wanted to go into show business&nbsp;... it was expected."<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/>

In 1974, at the age of seven, Jackson appeared on stage in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] with her siblings in a routine show at the MGM Casino.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> Jane Cornwell documented in her biography of the singer, ''Janet Jackson'' (2002), that at age eight Joseph Jackson told Janet not to call him "Dad" anymore since he was her manager; he told her she would henceforth address him as "Joseph".<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> She began her career as an actress with the debut of the [[CBS]] variety show ''[[The Jacksons (TV series)|The Jacksons]]'' (1976), in which she appeared with her siblings Tito, [[Rebbie Jackson|Rebbie]], [[Randy Jackson|Randy]], Michael, Marlon, [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] and Jackie.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> In 1977, Jackson was selected by producer [[Norman Lear]] to play a recurring role as [[Penny Gordon Woods]] in the [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Good Times]]''.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> From 1979 to 1980, Jackson starred in ''[[A New Kind of Family]]'' as Jojo Ashton, and then joined the cast of ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', portraying Charlene Duprey from 1981 to 1982.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> She played a recurring role during the fourth season of the television series ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]'' as Cleo Hewitt, though she later commented that the series was not a project she enjoyed working on.<ref>{{Citation | last = Fox | first = Norman | title = ''Indian Summer'' | publisher = tv.com | url = http://www.tv.com/fame/indian-summer/episode/77620/summary.html | accessdate = 2008-09-03}}</ref><ref name="Saunders">{{Citation |last= Saunders |first= Michael | title=The 3 Divas Janet Jackson turns her focus inward | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | page=p.

Although Jackson was initially apprehensive about starting a music career, she agreed to participate in recording sessions with her family. The first of these, a duet with her brother Randy titled "Love Song for Kids", took place in 1978. When Jackson was sixteen, her father arranged a contract for her with [[A&M Records]].<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> Her debut album, ''[[Janet Jackson (album)|Janet Jackson]]'', produced by [[soul music|soul]] singers [[Angela Winbush]], [[Ren<U+00E9> Moore]] and Leon F.

Jackson's second album, ''[[Dream Street (album)|Dream Street]]'', was released two years later. Her father recruited her brothers to help produce the album: Marlon co-wrote two of the album's tracks, while Tito, Jackie and Michael provided background vocals.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> ''Dream Street'' reached number nineteen on the R&B albums chart; its sales were less than that of Jackson's debut album.<ref name="Billboard Album peaks"/> The album's only hit, "[[Don't Stand Another Chance]]", peaked at number nine on ''Billboard''{{'}}s R&B singles chart.<ref>{{Citation | title = Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs "Don t Stand Another Chance" | work = Top Music Charts-Hot 100-Billboard 200-Music Genre Sales | publisher = ''Billboard'' | year = 2007 | url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=367&cfgn=Singles&cfn=Hot+R%26amp%3BB%2FHip-Hop+Songs&ci=3003911&cdi=6165082&cid=11%2F24%2F1984 | accessdate = 2008-09-13}}</ref> In late 1984, Jackson eloped with childhood friend and fellow R&B singer [[James DeBarge]].

Following the release of ''Dream Street'', Jackson decided to separate her business affairs from her family. She later commented, "I remember trying to tell my father I no longer wanted him to manage me. It would have been easier to have Mother tell him for me, but that was something I had to do for myself."<ref name="Sexual Healing"/> Jackson also stated, "I just wanted to get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do, telling him that I didn't want to work with him again."<ref name="Saunders"/> A&M Records executive John McClain hired producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to work with Jackson.

She stated that "[t]he danger hit home when a couple of guys started stalking me on the street&nbsp;... Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, out of a sense of self-defense."<ref name="Sexual Healing"/>

In September 1989, Jackson released her fourth album, ''[[Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814]]''.

The [[Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour]], Jackson's first world tour in support of a studio album, aimed to recreate the "award<U+2013>winning, visually innovative" music videos of ''Rhythm Nation 1814'' and ''Control'', and was described as "an elaborately choreographed spectacle" by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref>{{Citation |title = Music features: A Million Miles Of Music Your Complete Guide To The Tours Of Summer Summer Music Preview | page = p. 32 | newspaper = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1990-06-01 }}</ref> As Jackson began her tour, she was acknowledged for the cultural impact of her music.

For the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] halftime show in February 2004, Jackson performed a medley of her singles "All for You" and "Rhythm Nation"; she then performed alongside [[Justin Timberlake]]. As Timberlake sang the lyric "gonna have you naked by the end of this song" from his single "[[Rock Your Body]]", he tore open Jackson's top, exposing her right breast. After the performance, Jackson apologized, calling it an accident, and said that Timberlake was supposed to pull away the [[bustier]] and leave the red-lace bra intact.<ref name="apologeticjackson">{{Citation | title = Apologetic Jackson says 'costume reveal' went awry | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = 2004-02-03 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/02/superbowl.jackson/ | accessdate = 2006-05-20}}</ref> She further commented, "I am really sorry if I offended anyone.

Jackson's music has encompassed a broad range of genres, including R&B, pop, soul, rap, hip hop, rock, and dance music. Qadree EI-Amin, Jackson's former personal manager, commented, "[s]he's bigger than [[Barbra Streisand]] because Streisand can't appeal to the street crowd, as Janet does. But Streisand's rich, elite crowd loves Janet Jackson."<ref name="crossroads"/> When record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis collaborated with Jackson on her 1986 album ''Control'', Richard J. Ripani documented that the trio "crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility."<ref name="The New Blue Music"/>

Jackson has changed her lyrical focus over the years. Gillian G. Gaar, author of ''She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock & Roll'' (2002), described ''Control'' as "an autobiographical tale about her life with her parents, her first marriage, and breaking free."<ref name="She's a rebel"/> Rickey Vincent stated in his book ''Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One'' (1996) that ''Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814'' "was the boldest and most successful pop attempt to combine social commentary, celebration, and state-of-the-art dance funk since her brother Michael's efforts to be ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''."<ref>{{Citation| last = Vincent | first = Rickey | coauthors = George Clinton | title = Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1996 | page = 284 | isbn = 0312134991}}</ref> On ''janet.'', Jackson began to deal primarily with sexual themes. Joshua Klein wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted "from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds<U+2014>figuratively and literally<U+2014>of love and lust."<ref name="Klein">{{Citation | last= Klein| first=Joshua | title=Janet Jackson's Lighthearted Lament About Lost Love | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | page= p.

Chris Willman of ''Los Angeles Times'' stated the "enthralling" choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour "represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping 'n' locking style<U+2014>a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements."<ref name="Chris Willman">{{Citation| last1 = Willman | first1 = Chris | title = Pop Music Review Janet Jackson's Dance of Community| page = p. 1 | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = 1990-04-23 | issn = 04583035}}</ref> ''The Independent'' writer Nicholas Barber commented in his review for The Velvet Rope Tour that "Janet's concerts are the pop equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie, with all the explosions, special effects, ersatz sentimentality, gratuitous cleavage and emphasis on spectacle over coherence that the term implies."<ref name="Glasgow">{{Citation |last=Barber | first=Nicholas | title=Rock music: Janet Jackson gets lost in her own limelight | newspaper=[[The Independent]] | page=p. 6 | date=1998-06-07}}</ref> When ''Los Angeles Times'' reporter Robert Hilburn asked Jackson "[d]o you understand it when people talk about [The Velvet Rope Tour] in terms of Broadway?", she responded, "I'm crazy about Broadway&nbsp;...

Jim Cullen observed in ''Popular Culture in American History'' (2001) that although it was Michael Jackson's ''[[Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]'' that originally synchronized [[music video]] with album sales, Janet Jackson saw the visualization of her music elevate her to the status of a [[pop icon|pop culture icon]].<ref>{{Citation| last = Cullen | first = Jim | title = Popular Culture in American History | publisher = [[Blackwell Publishing]] | year = 2001 | page = 280 | isbn = 0631219587}}</ref> According to Larry Starr and Christopher Alan Waterman, authors of ''American Popular Music : The Rock Years'' (2006), when the American music industry began its economic recovery in the mid-1980s from the fall of the [[disco era]], Janet Jackson, among other multi-platinum selling music artists, was acknowledged for stimulating the overall increase in consumer purchasing of LPs, cassette tapes and CDs.<ref>{{Citation| last = Starr | first = Larry | coauthors = Christopher Alan Waterman | title = American Popular Music : The Rock Years | publisher = New York Oxford University Press | year = 2006 | location = NY | page = 231 | isbn = 9780195300529}}</ref> In ''The New Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm & Blues, 1950-1999'' (2006), Richard J. Ripani wrote that Jackson's ''Control'' and ''Rhythm Nation 1814'' albums proved to be critical to the development of contemporary R&B, as ''Control'' "was one of the first to create an identifiable bridge between rap and mainstream R&B" and ''Rhythm Nation 1814'' "[made] use of elements from across the R&B spectrum."<ref name="The New Blue Music"/> Ripani also argues that the popularity of Jackson's [[signature song]] "Nasty" influenced the new jack swing genre developed by [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]].<ref name="The New Blue Music"/> In March 2008, [[Business Wire]] reported "Janet Jackson is one of the top ten selling artists in the history of contemporary music; ranked by ''Billboard'' magazine as the ninth most successful act in rock and roll history, and the second most successful female artist in pop music history."<ref name="Business Wire"/>
