'''Insane Clown Posse''' is an [[United States|American]] [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[Duet (music)|duo]] from [[Delray, Detroit]]. The group comprises [[Joseph Bruce]] and [[Joseph Utsler]], who perform under the respective personas of the murderous, [[Evil clown|wicked clowns]] Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. Insane Clown Posse performs a style of [[hardcore hip hop]] known as ''[[horrorcore]]'' and is known for its dark, violent lyrics and elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] and three gold albums, but have been criticized for the violent content and perceived immature nature of their lyrics.

Originally known as ''Inner City Posse,'' Bruce and Utsler changed the group's name when prompted by a vision in a dream resembling a [[traveling carnival]]. The dream also inspired the introduction of [[supernatural]]-and [[horror fiction|horror]]-themed lyrics. The duo founded the independent [[record label]] [[Psychopathic Records]] with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature film ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]''. They formed their own [[wrestling]] federation, [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]], and later collaborated with many famous hip hop and [[rock music|rock]] musicians.

The themes of Insane Clown Posse and other acts on Psychopathic Records center on the mythology of the [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]], which the duo claim is a spiritual force that has revealed a series of stories known as ''Joker's Cards''. These stories each offer a specific lesson designed to change the "evil ways" of listeners before "the end consumes us all." Insane Clown Posse has a dedicated following, often referred to by the group as [[Juggalo]]s and Juggalettes.

==== Formation of the group ====
[[Joseph Bruce]] (Violent J) and [[Joseph Utsler]] (Shaggy 2 Dope) met in [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]], a poor, crime-ridden suburb nine miles (fourteen km) north of [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Along with Utsler's brother, John, and friend, Lacy, they wrestled in [[backyard wrestling|backyard rings]] that they had built themselves.<ref name="BehindthePaint51">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=page 51<U+2013>61 |chapter=JJ Boys and The Royal Oak Township }}</ref> In 1989, Joseph Bruce, as Jagged Joe, Joseph Utsler, as Kangol Joe, and John Utsler, as Master J, released the single entitled ''Party at the Top of the Hill'' under the name of ''JJ Boys'', but they did not pursue a serious career in music.<ref name="BehindthePaint539">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=page 539<U+2013>540 |chapter=Complete Discography }}</ref> Poverty and a difficult home life drove Bruce to move in with Rudy "The Rude Boy" Hill in the ghetto of [[River Rouge, Michigan|River Rouge]], a residential neighborhood in the industrial southwest side of Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint108">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 108<U+2013>111 |chapter=Rude Boy and the Magical Land of Toxic Waste }}</ref> 

Feeling a sense of home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called ''Inner City Posse.'' The gang consisted of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, and a number of other connections he had made in Southwest Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint108"/> Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989<U+2013>1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating [[probation]];<ref name="BehindthePaint125">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=125<U+2013>132 |chapter=Intelligence and Violence }}</ref> this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/> Bruce began his [[professional wrestling]] career after getting out of jail, and it was at his first show that he met [[Rob Van Dam]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/> During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.

Bruce became frustrated with the backstage politics of the wrestling business and began searching for another career.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/> Back on the streets, Bruce began listening to hip hop with Utsler and with Utsler's brother, John. The trio performed at local night clubs, using the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, under the name of their gang, Inner City Posse.<ref name="BehindthePaint539"/> Seeing a need for a manager, Bruce's brother [[Jumpsteady|Robert]] recommended his friend and record store owner Alex Abbiss, who established the [[Psychopathic Records]] record label with the group in 1991. Later that year the group released the self-produced [[EP]] entitled ''[[Dog Beats]]''.<ref name="AMGHipHop">

After receiving jail sentences, the group members abandoned gang life.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/>

In late 1991 the group invested more money into production than was covered by returns. The group decided that its [[gangsta rap]] style was the cause of the problem: Most rappers at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically.<ref name="BehindthePaint174">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 174<U+2013>185 |chapter=The Dark Carnival }}</ref> Referring to local rapper [[Esham]]'s [[acid rap]] style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about [[Satan]], which Esham often did.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/>

After the change in musical style, the group decided it needed a new name. Utsler suggested keeping the "I.C.P." initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct, an idea to which the group agreed.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/> Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in Delray, which became the inspiration for the group's new name: Insane Clown Posse. The other members agreed, deciding that they would take on this new genre and name, and would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted [[promotion (marketing)|hype]] man.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/>

Upon returning home that night, Bruce had a dream in which spirits in a [[traveling carnival]] appeared to him&mdash;an image that would become the basis for the Dark Carnival mythology detailed in the group's Joker's Cards series.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/>

====''Carnival of Carnage'' and ''Ringmaster''====
The group began recording their debut album, ''[[Carnival of Carnage]]'', with producer Chuck Miller. After recording only three songs for US$6,000 with Miller, Alex Abbiss made his first major managerial move by finding another producer, [[Mike E. Clark]].<ref name="BehindthePaint198">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 198<U+2013>208 |chapter=The Broken Path of a Dream }}</ref> The group finished recording the album with Clark, who continued to work with them throughout their career. The album featured appearances from local rappers, including Esham and [[Kid Rock]].<ref name="AMGHipHop"/> Just weeks prior to the release of their album, John left the group because he felt that it was "taking up too much of [his] life."<ref name="BehindthePaint198"/> When Bruce and Utsler attempted to call a meeting to talk about the issues, John did not attend.<ref name="BehindthePaint198"/>

''Carnival of Carnage'' was released on [[October 18]], [[1992]], with distribution within a {{convert|120|mi|km|sing=on}} radius of Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint198"/> [[Allmusic]] reviewer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] compared the group's performance on the album to "a third-rate [[Beastie Boys]] supported by a cut-rate [[Faith No More]], all tempered with the sensibility that made [[GWAR]] cult heroes<U+2014>only with [...] more sexism and jokes that [...] wind up sounding racist."<ref name="AMGHipHop"/> The follow-up EP, ''[[Beverly Kills 50187]]'', sold well and gained a larger audience. During a live performance of the song "The Juggla", Bruce addressed the audience as ''Juggalos'', and the positive response resulted in the group using the word thereafter.<ref name="BehindthePaint231">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 237<U+2013>253 |chapter=Ringmaster's Word }}</ref> The word has been the subject of criticism from both [[Ben Sisario]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and Allmusic's Erlewine, who suggested the term is similar to the racial slur ''[[List of ethnic slurs#J|jigaboo]].''<ref name="AMGHipHop"/><ref name="RSAlbumGuide">{{cite book |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |editor=Brackett, Nathan |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=0743201698 |pages=405<U+2013>6 }}</ref> 

The group's second studio album, ''[[Ringmaster (album)|Ringmaster]]'', was released on [[March 8]], [[1994]], and its popularity enabled the group to sell out larger nightclubs across Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint231"> {{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 231<U+2013>253 |chapter=Ringmaster's Word }}</ref> Because Bruce and Utsler made reference to the Detroit-produced soft drink [[Faygo]] in their songs, they "figured it would be cool to have some on stage with [them]."<ref name="Brant"/> During a concert Bruce threw an open bottle of Faygo at a row of concertgoers who were giving them [[Finger (gesture)|the finger]]. After receiving a positive response, Bruce and Utsler have since continued to spray Faygo onto audiences.<ref name="Brant"/> A subsequent national tour increased sales of the album,<ref name="BehindthePaint231"/> earning ''Ringmaster'' a [[Music recording sales certification|gold certification]].<ref name=RIAA>{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=Certification for Insane Clown Posse |accessdate=2008-05-05 |publisher=RIAA Gold and Platinum Certification Database}}</ref> The group's second EP, ''[[The Terror Wheel]]'', was released on [[August 5]], [[1994]]. One of the songs from the EP, "Dead Body Man", received considerable local radio play.<ref name="BehindthePaint231"/> The same year marked their first "Hallowicked" concert, which has since continued annually on [[Halloween]] night in Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint231"/>

===Major releases (1995<U+2013>1997)===
====''Riddle Box''====
In 1995 Bruce and Utsler attempted to obtain a contract with a major record label. They eventually signed a contract with [[Jive Records]],<ref name="BehindthePaint231"/> which released the group's third studio album, ''[[Riddle Box]]'', on [[October 10]], [[1995]].<ref name="BehindthePaint552"> {{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 552 |chapter=Complete Discography }}</ref> After Jive Records showed little interest in promoting the album, Insane Clown Posse funded the promotion of ''Riddle Box'' independently. This effort led the group to [[Dallas, Texas]], where they persuaded several music retail stores to stock the album. Sales averaged 1,500 copies per week as a result.<ref name="BehindthePaint268"> {{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 268<U+2013>269 |chapter=Fuck Jive }}</ref>

====''The Great Milenko''====
Manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]]-owned label [[Hollywood Records]], that reportedly paid US$1&nbsp;million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Jive Records.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430332/19970703/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Point The Finger At Disney |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=[[July 3]], [[1997]] |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> The group started recording their fourth studio album, ''[[The Great Milenko]]'', in 1996, during which Disney requested that the tracks "The Neden Game", "Under the Moon", and "Boogie Woogie Wu" be removed.

During a music store autograph signing, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had recalled the album within hours of its release,<ref name="BehindthePaint306"/> despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching #63 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Browne">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288784,00.html |title=Review of ''The Great Milenko'' |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Browne |first=David |date=[[July 25]], [[1997]] |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430331/19970704/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Angry At Disney's Decision |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=[[July 4]], [[1997]] |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> The group was also informed that its in-store signings and nationwide tour had been canceled, commercials for the album and the [[music video]] for "Halls of Illusions" (which had reached #1 on [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] video request channel) were pulled from television, and that the group was dropped from the label.<ref name="BehindthePaint306"/> It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]] at the time because of Disney's promotion of "Gay Days" at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]], in addition to presiding over the gay-themed television sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''.

After the termination of the Hollywood Records contract, Insane Clown Posse signed a new contract with [[Island Records]], who agreed to release the uncensored version of ''The Great Milenko''.<ref name="BehindthePaint330">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 330<U+2013>335 |chapter=Disney's Hoe Tactics }}</ref><ref name="Island"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' music critic [[David Browne]] gave the record a C-minus rating: "[With] its puerile humor and intentionally ugly metal-rap tunes, the album feels oddly dated."<ref name="Browne"/> ''The Great Milenko'' has been certified platinum with over 1.5&nbsp;million copies sold.<ref name=RIAA/> One of the group's first projects with Island Records was an hour-long documentary entitled ''Shockumentary'', which aired on [[MTV]]. The station initially refused to play the documentary, but Island Records persuaded them to air it as a personal favor.<ref name="BehindthePaint330"/> ''Shockumentary'' helped increase album sales from 17,000 to 50,000 copies per week.<ref name="BehindthePaint330"/> 

====Extreme Championship Wrestling appearance====
Two days before their rescheduled "The Great Milenko Tour" in August 1997, Bruce received a telephone call from friends Rob Van Dam and Sabu.<ref name="BehindthePaint336"> {{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 336<U+2013>349 |chapter=Calling of the Road }}</ref> They asked if he and Utsler could appear on [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW)'s second [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) program, [[ECW Hardcore Heaven#1997|Hardcore Heaven]]. Bruce and Utsler were already fans of ECW, as Van Dam had been sending videotapes of the show to them since its first airing.<ref name="BehindthePaint336"/> They agreed to appear and went to Florida to discuss the ECW program's content with Van Dam, Sabu, and [[Paul Heyman]]. Heyman was pleased that Bruce and Utsler were former wrestlers, which meant that they could surprise the crowd by taking [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]. Heyman also favored the idea of using Insane Clown Posse, because it was unlikely that anyone knew of the relationship the group had with Van Dam and Sabu.<ref name="BehindthePaint336"/> Heyman presented his idea to Bruce and Utsler, who agreed to participate. Insane Clown Posse opened the ECW program by performing songs and exciting the crowd. Then Van Dam and Sabu, the main [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] at the time, attacked Bruce and Utsler. The top [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], [[Jim Fullington|The Sandman]], came in and saved them by chasing away Van Dam and Sabu with his signature [[Shinai|Singapore cane]].<ref name="BehindthePaint336"/>

====Nationwide tour with House of Krazees and Myzery====
Two days after the ECW program, Insane Clown Posse began their rescheduled nationwide tour with House of Krazees and Myzery. Their first concert, held in [[Orlando, Florida]], was hand-picked by Insane Clown Posse and free to the public.<ref name="BehindthePaint336"/> Halfway through the tour, Brian Jones of House of Krazees had a fallout with his band members. Jones left the group, forcing House of Krazees to quit the tour.<ref name="BehindthePaint336"/>

The success of the tour enabled Bruce and Utsler to purchase new houses both for each other and for their families.<ref name="BehindthePaint330"/> Bruce even told his mother to quit her job because he would pay her expenses.<ref name="BehindthePaint353">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=pages 353<U+2013>365 |chapter=Life on the Road }}</ref> 

====''ICP Strangle-Mania''====
Bruce and Utsler had two months off before their next tour and wanted to resume their involvement in wrestling. Being avid wrestling fans, they owned and were fascinated by the [[Hardcore wrestling|death match]] wrestling collection ''Outrageously Violent Wrestling from Japan.'' Bruce and Utsler decided to create a compilation of their favorite matches, recording their own sports announcing under the personas named "Gweedo" (Utsler) and "3D" (Bruce).<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> The compilation video was released nationwide under the title ''ICP's Strangle-Mania''. The video's success allowed Bruce and Utsler to host their own wrestling show, ''ICP's Strangle-Mania Live'', to a sold-out performance at St. Andrew's Hall. The main event featured Insane Clown Posse versus The Chicken Boys, who were played by two friends of Bruce and Utsler.<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> With local wrestling [[List_of_professional_wrestling_slang#B|booker]] Dan Curtis, other wrestlers such as [[Mad Man Pondo]], [[2 Tuff Tony]], [[Corporal Robinson]], [[King Kong Bundy]], and [[Abdullah the Butcher]] were also booked on the show to wrestle in the same death match style as shown in ''ICP Strangle-Mania''.<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/>

====Interaction with Eminem====
The night after ''ICP's Strangle-Mania Live'', Bruce took the members of Myzery to St. Andrew's Hall. [[Eminem]], then an unknown local rapper, approached Bruce and handed him a flyer advertising the release party for ''[[The Slim Shady EP]]''. The flyer read, "Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)."<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Eminem explained, "It says 'maybe.' Maybe you will be there; I don't know. That's why I'm asking you right now. You guys comin' to my release party, or what?"<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce, upset over not being consulted,  responded, "Fuck ''no'', I ain't coming to your party. We might have, if you would've asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin' flyer like this."<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Eminem took Bruce's response as a personal offense, subsequently attacking the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler responded later in 1999 by releasing a parody of Eminem's "[[My Name Is]]" entitled "Slim Anus." Barbs between Insane Clown Posse and Eminem continued.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A19778 |title=Juggalos Are Us: Get past the clown makeup, the violent lyrics and the sea of thrown soda and we're all about family, say Insane Clown Posse fan |accessdate=2008-05-31 |last=Meinzer |first=Melissa |date=[[November 9]], [[2006]] |publisher=Pittsburgh City Paper}}</ref>

====The House of Horrors Tour====
One month after ''ICP's Strangle-Mania Live'', Insane Clown Posse began their second nationwide tour, "The House of Horrors Tour", with Myzery added as one of the opening acts. While searching for the second opening act, Bruce received a telephone call at his home from former House of Krazees members [[Jamie Spaniolo]] and [[Monoxide Child|Paul Methric]], who told Bruce that the group was officially disbanded and asked to be on the tour.<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Spaniolo and Methric provided a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] containing three songs: "2nd Hand Smoke", "Diemotherfuckdie", and "How Does It Feel?"<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce was extremely impressed, and immediately had a contract drafted with Psychopathic Records for the new group to sign. Bruce, Spaniolo, and Methric agreed on the band name [[Twiztid]]. The House of Horrors Tour thus featured Insane Clown Posse, with opening groups Twiztid, Myzery, and [[Psycho Realm]].<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/>

====Legal troubles====
On [[November 16]], [[1997]], Bruce was arrested on an [[aggravated battery]] charge after allegedly striking an audience member thirty times with his [[microphone]] at a concert in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].

On [[April 19]], [[1998]], in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], Bruce suffered a [[panic attack]] during a performance and was carried off stage.<ref name="BehindthePaint381">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=page 381<U+2013>383 |chapter=Angels and Devils }}</ref> Bruce, who later recalled being completely "out of it",<ref name="BehindthePaint381"/> found scissors and cut off his dreadlocks.<ref name="BehindthePaint381"/> After suffering another panic attack once he returned home, Bruce opted to spend three days in a Michigan mental health program.<ref name="BehindthePaint381"/> Insane Clown Posse later cancelled the last two weeks' worth of dates on its United States tour,<ref name="BehindthePaint381"/> but subsequently launched their first European tour.<ref name="BehindthePaint387">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=page 387<U+2013>388 |chapter=Juggalos of the World }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430322/19980428/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse's Violent J Hospitalized After Panic Attack |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=[[April 28]], [[1998]] |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref>

====World Wresting Federation involvement====
After returning from [[England]], Insane Clown Posse received a telephone call from [[Jim Johnston (composer)|Jim Johnston]] of the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation (WWF)]].<ref name="BehindthePaint398">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=page 398<U+2013>413 |chapter=Taking Bumps }}</ref> The WWF heard that Bruce and Utsler were fans of wrestling and asked them to perform the entrance theme for the wrestling group [[The Oddities]]. The WWF also wanted Bruce and Utsler to appear on their [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] pay-per-view (PPV) program in August 1998 and rap live while The Oddities entered the ring. Insane Clown Posse composed the song "The Greatest Show" and agreed to appear on the program. Once the duo arrived at the arena, they realized their wrestling dreams had come true; they had been contacted by wrestling's top company and were now set to appear on their PPV program at the company's most historic venue, [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Bruce and Utsler met backstage with various wrestlers, including the owner of the WWF, [[Vince McMahon]], and his son, [[Shane McMahon]]. Bruce and Utsler paid [[Mick Foley]], a wrestler with the WWF, his royalty payments from the ''ICP Strangle-Mania'' [[DVD]], as Foley appeared in almost every match, and a friendship began among the three.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Bruce and Utsler were assigned to the locker room with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[The Undertaker]], who were to wrestle during the main event that night. The duo immediately felt the animosity of the locker room that had previously driven them away from wrestling.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Insane Clown Posse performed and was asked to return for the live broadcast of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' the following night. At the broadcast, Bruce and Utsler requested for more than just a rapping role; they wanted to wrestle. McMahon favored the idea and allowed them to participate.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/>

Insane Clown Posse was put in a feud with [[The Headbangers]]. In the first wrestling match, The Headbangers were [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|stiff]], throwing real punches and kicks.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> In the rematch, a move was planned where The Headbangers would be flipped over by Bruce and Utsler. When the time came to flip over, however, The Headbangers refused to move, forcing Insane Clown Posse to genuinely flip them over and begin throwing punches.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Realizing that the match was getting too heated, McMahon ended the feud after that match.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Bruce and Utsler were put into other matches along with The Oddities. McMahon said to Bruce and Utsler, "Make it seem like you don't know anything about wrestling, and you guys keep choking and digging into their eyes."<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> During this time, Bruce and Utsler had no contract with WWF. They, however, did have an agreement that the WWF would occasionally play Insane Clown Posse commercials, and in return, Bruce and Utsler would wrestle for free.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Bruce and Utsler knew that airtime cost significantly more than any monetary compensation they would receive and were thus satisfied with the agreement. Bruce and Utsler were told they were to suddenly [[List of professional wrestling slang#T|turn]] on The Oddities in their match against The Headbangers, then join them in beating up the group. They were also informed that their commercial would air the very next week, which had still not aired after three months of being involved with the WWF.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> The next week Insane Clown Posse and The Headbangers had a match with Steve Austin. Backstage, Austin made it clear to Bruce and [[Glen Ruth|Thrasher]] that Thrasher would receive the first [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]], after which Bruce would turn around and receive the second.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> During the match, Austin gave Bruce the Stunner first, catching him off guard, thus having Bruce [[Sell (professional wrestling)|sell]] the move awkwardly. Although disappointed over the events during the match, Bruce and Utsler continued in hopes that McMahon would air the commercial as promised. Bruce and Utsler contacted Abbiss to inquire about the commercial and were informed that it was not aired. Given that McMahon failed to uphold his promise to air Insane Clown Posse's commercial, Abbiss recommended that Bruce and Utsler terminate their agreement with the WWF.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/>

While involved with the WWF, Insane Clown Posse brought Dan Curtis with them. After leaving the WWF, Curtis suggested that Insane Clown Posse start its own promotion while continuing with its music. He came to Bruce's house each night to discuss ideas about the promotion. Curtis convinced Bruce to coordinate another ''Strangle-Mania Live'' show, to be followed by an eighty-city "Hellfire Wrestling" tour.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Curtis booked the talent and wrote the scripts. ''Strangle-Mania Live'' sold out the Majestic Theater in Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Two days after the show, Curtis was found dead in his apartment, due to a sudden diabetic problem.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> The "Hellfire Wrestling" tour was subsequently canceled.

====''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers''====
By late 1998 over one million copies of ''The Great Milenko'' had been sold,<ref name="BehindthePaint414">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=page 414<U+2013>433 |chapter=Big Money Hustlas }}</ref> and Insane Clown Posse was ready for its fifth album, ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]''. Working with Mike E. Clark and Rich "Legs Diamond" Murrell, Bruce and Utsler developed their album with the highest of hopes. The group was known nationally, but were not taken very seriously. Hoping to receive the respect Bruce and Utsler felt they deserved, they planned to feature well-known, respected rappers on their album.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce stated outright that he wanted to involve [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. They paid Snoop Dogg US$40,000 to appear on the song "The Shaggy Show." Snoop Dogg also helped them contact Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was paid US$30,000 for his appearance. Ol' Dirty Bastard recorded his track in a matter of two days; however, his recording consisted of nothing more than him rambling about "bitches."<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> It took Bruce and Utsler a week to assemble just four rhymes out of his rambling, and had to re-record the track and title it "Bitches."<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Finally, Insane Clown Posse contacted [[Ice-T]], who charged them only US$10,000.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The group felt that Ice-T's song did not belong on the album, and was instead released on a later album, ''[[Psychopathics from Outer Space]]''.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>

To help increase their positive publicity, the group hired the [[Nasty Little Man]] publicity team.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>  The team set up a photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was to appear on the cover of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' magazine in Cleveland. On the set of the photo shoot, a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in the song "Fuck the World", the lyric that stated "Fuck the Beastie Boys and the [[Dalai Lama]]" needed to be changed.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Insulted, Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again&mdash;referring to Disney's previous requirement of censure.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Nasty Little Man told Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends, and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> In response, Bruce fired Nasty Little Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> 

''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' was released on [[May 25]], [[1999]], and reached #4 on the ''Billboard'' album charts,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430318/19990603/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Makes "Amazing" Top Five Debut |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=[[June 3]], [[1999]] |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> and has since been certified platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref name=RIAA/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a "four out of five stars" rating, stating that "[Insane Clown Posse] actually delivered an album that comes close to fulfilling whatever promise their ridiculous, carnivalesque blend of [[Hardcore hip hop|hardcore hip-hop]] and [[Shock rock|shock-metal]] had in the first place".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:f9ftxqrkldje~T1 |title=Review of ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' writer Barry Walters gave the album a "two out of five stars" rating, writing that "no musical sleight of hand can disguise the fact that Shaggy and J remain the ultimate wack MCs."<ref name="RSJeckelBros">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/insaneclownposse/albums/album/120991/review/6068329/the_amazing_jeckel_brothers |title=Insane Clown Posse: The Amazing Jeckel Brothers: Music Reviews |accessdate=2007-12-26 |first=Barry |last=Walters |date=1999 |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' }}</ref> At the same time as ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers''' release, Island Records merged with [[Def Jam Records]]. It quickly became apparent to Bruce and Utsler that Def Jam Records had no interest in them.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Eminem, who had begun to gain mainstream success, insulted Insane Clown Posse in interviews, tours, and the song "Till Hell Freezes Over."<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>

====''Big Money Hustlas''====
On Insane Clown Posse's previous tour (The House of Horrors Tour), they had watched the movie ''Big Ballers''.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The group as well as Twiztid loved the video. After Insane Clown Posse finished its ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' album, Bruce and Utsler decided to create their own movie, ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]'', with the same low-budget comedy style as ''Big Ballers''. Island Records gave them US$250,000 to begin work on the movie.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce and Utsler were contacted by the [[lead vocalist]] of [[Osaka Popstar]], [[John Cafiero]], who said that he was a fan of Insane Clown Posse, and offered to direct the movie.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Insane Clown Posse asked Mick Foley to appear in the movie under his "Cactus Sac" persona. Cafiero retained the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[Fred Berry]], and, at Bruce's request, [[Harland Williams]].<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The script was written by Bruce, and filmed in New York City.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce played a crime boss and Utsler portrayed a police detective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:210371 |title=Overview for ''Big Money Hustlas'' |accessdate=2008-07-16 |first=Mark |last=Deming |publisher=[[Allmovie]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigmoneyhustlas.com/synop.html |title=Synopsis for ''Big Money Hustlas'' |accessdate=2008-07-16 |publisher=[[Psychopathic Records]] }}</ref> The stage crew members, which showed their dislike for Insane Clown Posse, were a source of contention. Despite the crew striking twice, the movie was filmed in two months.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>

====Woodstock 1999====
While on "The Asylum In-store Tour", Bruce and Utsler were informed by Abbiss that they were offered US$100,000 to perform at [[Woodstock 1999]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=034544762X |pages=page 444<U+2013>455 |chapter=Big Money Hustlas }}</ref> They were excited about the offer, as it indicated their impact on the music industry. Some people perceived participating in Woodstock 1999 was a [[selling out|sell-out]] for the group; however, Bruce and Utsler believed that Woodstock was selling out. As Bruce explains, "[Woodstock] sold out the mainstream style for us! Woodstock never came to us and asked us to change one fuckin' thing about us or our show! They wanted ICP just as ICP is, and nothing else. If that ain't fresh, then I don't know what the fuck is!"<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>

====Amazing Jeckel Brothers Tour troubles====
After Woodstock 1999, Insane Clown Posse began its "Amazing Jeckel Brothers Tour", along with musicians [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], [[Krayzie Bone]], Twiztid, [[Mindless Self Indulgence]], and [[Coal Chamber]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Biohazard, Mindless Self Indulgence, Krayzie Bone, and Twiztid were well-received by audiences;<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> however, Coal Chamber was not. Insane Clown Posse fans were not purchasing tickets, as they did not like Coal Chamber.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> For the three shows that Coal Chamber played, there were multiple ticket refunds.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and his brother, Rob, made the decision to eliminate Coal Chamber from the tour. After doing so, there were no tickets returned for the remainder of the tour dates.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and Utsler claimed that Coal Chamber had been removed from the tour because of equipment problems, but later revealed the true reason for their actions on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', which aired [[August 19]], [[1999]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce continued by saying, "Nobody will tell you that, because everybody's afraid of your crumpet-ass bitch manager."<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Later that night Stern contacted Bruce and Utsler, asking them to appear on his show the following day to talk with Coal Chamber's manager, [[Sharon Osbourne]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>

Before the show went on air, Osbourne bet Bruce and Utsler US$50,000 that Insane Clown Posse's next album would not even sell 200,000 copies&mdash;a bet that Bruce accepted.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> On air Osbourne informed Bruce and Utsler that Coal Chamber filed a lawsuit for [[breach of contract]].<ref name="SternOsbourne">{{cite news |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924396/insane_clown_posse_and_sharon_osbourne_battle_on_howard_stern_radio_show |title=Insane Clown Posse and Sharon Osbourne Battle on Howard Stern Radio Show |accessdate=2007-12-26 |last=Fischer |first=Blair R |date=[[August 20]], [[1999]] |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''}}</ref> Osbourne stated that her group was to receive US$12,500 per show for a scheduled two-month package tour. Bruce reiterated that Coal Chamber's music did not appeal to Insane Clown Posse fans, and that ticket refunds decreased after Coal Chamber had been removed from the tour.<ref name="SternOsbourne"/> Osbourne then made public the bet with Bruce about Insane Clown Posse's next album, also stating that the duo would be subsequently dropped from their distributor. In Osbourne's words, "You're dead. Your career is over."<ref name="SternOsbourne"/> Bruce predicted that the group's next album would sell at least 500,000 copies;<ref name="SternOsbourne"/> however, the bet officially stood at 200,000 copies as agreed by both Bruce and Osbourne backstage.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and Utsler returned to wrestling, competing in every major federation before forming their own wrestling league, [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling|Juggalo Championshit Wrestling]] (JCW), which was later renamed "Juggalo Championship Wrestling."<ref name="ICP-History-6">{{cite web |url=http://www.insaneclownposse.com/carnival/iframe.php?page_id=icp_history_6 |title=Who R ICP > History > The Amazing Jeckel Brothers |accessdate=2008-05-02 |publisher=The Official Insane Clown Posse website}}</ref>

Two music videos were released from the albums: "Tilt-a-Whirl," from ''Bizaar,'' and "Let's Go All The Way," from ''Bizzar.''

==Live performances==
[[Image:Insane Clown Posse concert.jpg|thumb|Insane Clown Posse perform in a 2007 concert.]]
Insane Clown Posse is known for their elaborate concert performances. In Marley Brant's ''Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway'', Bruce described a typical performance: "We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of [[Faygo]] soda at every show. [...] We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage."<ref name="Brant">{{cite book |last=Brant |first=Marley |title=Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway |year=2004 |publisher=Billboard Books |isbn=082308437X |pages=pages 43<U+2013>52 }}</ref> Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a [[game show]] set and a cemetery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.theorion.com/media/storage/paper889/news/2003/02/12/Entertainment/Insane.Clown.Posse-1511352.shtml |title=Face-painting, Faygo-spraying band gets it right the second time |accessdate=2008-05-05 |last=Grace |first=Dane |date=[[February 12]], [[2003]] |publisher=The Orion}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.jagbytes.com/media/storage/paper1244/news/2007/10/31/Entertainment/Concert.Review.Icps.Indy.Stop.Leaves.Crazed.Fans.Sticky.Yet.Satisfied-3066636.shtml |title=Concert Review: ICP's Indy stop leaves crazed fans sticky, yet satisfied |accessdate=2008-05-05 |last=Taylor |first=Lindsey |date=[[October 31]], [[2007]] |publisher=JagBytes}}</ref> Bruce stated, "Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage. [...] ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'"<ref name="Brant"/>

On tour following the release of ''Carnival of Carnage'', Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at Big Rapids University in Michigan. After the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss, Bruce remembers that "[w]e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They must have been in shock and awe. We finished our two-song set, and the crowd [...] didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned."<ref name="Brant"/>

The group was unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit [[Visa (document)|visa]] because [[customs]] believed that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts.<ref name="BehindthePaint387"/> As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and creating fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, "The craziness was this: they were not the regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount [...] maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner. [...] when you're doing what we do with them<U+2014>that makes a world of difference."<ref name="Brant"/> During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot missile]], right towards the [[disco ball]] high above the crowd. [...] The bottle nailed the disco ball, and [...] came falling down [...] on top of some English kid's head. [...] We must've knocked fifteen or twenty people flat-out cold on that tour [...] Shaggy and I both had black eyes and several injuries and bruises ourselves from them things hittin' us."<ref name="Brant"/>

Bruce and Utsler did not expect many of their fans to attend Woodstock 1999, and were surprised when thousands of people chanted "I-C-P! I-C-P!" as they waited for the group to perform.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce told his stage crew that he would pay US$2,000 to each person who ran around the stage naked, and two people took up his offer. Insane Clown Posse also brought naked women on stage.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and Utsler felt that because the tickets to the event were over-priced, they needed to "give something back."<ref name="Brant"/> According to Bruce, "We brought along these big beach balls. We announced to the crowd that they each had a hundred dollars taped to them, and then we proceeded to kick about thirty of them into the crowd. Then we rolled out these bigger giant-ass beach balls and announced, 'These ones have five hundred bucks taped to them!' We booted a gang of them into the human sea."<ref name="Brant"/><ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce also recounts that their set had multiple technical problems, and the audience was not allowed to get close to the stage, which made the duo feel less connected with them.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>
