The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] currently has the largest and most diverse [[Biblical canon]] within traditional [[Christendom]]. Western scholars have classified the books of the Ethiopian canon into two categories<U+2014>the narrower canon, which is made-up mostly of books familiar in the west, and the broader canon. While this article has been written to discuss and highlight the books that are exclusive to the broader canon, it is impossible to do this without at least some discussion of the narrower canon. The Ethiopian broader canon in its fullest form includes the narrower canon in its entirety, as well as nine additional books. It is not known to exist at this time as one published compilation. Some books, though considered canonical, are nonetheless difficult to locate and are not even widely available in Ethiopia. While the narrower canon has indeed been published as one compilation, there may be no real [[emic]] distinction between the broader canon and the narrower canon, especially in so far as divine inspiration and scriptural authority is concerned. The idea of two such classifications may be nothing more than etic taxonomic conjecture.<ref>Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. 2003. "The Bible."

==Ethiopian narrower Biblical canon==
===Old Testament===
The Ethiopian [[Old Testament]] canon contains the entire [[Protocanonical books|Hebrew protocanon]]. Moreover, with the exception of the two books of [[Maccabees]], the Ethiopian canon contains the entire [[Catholic]] [[deuterocanon]]. In addition to this, the Ethiopian narrower Old Testament includes the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], the [[Paralipomena of Jeremiah]] (4 Baruch), [[Jubilees]], [[Enoch]], and the three books of [[Meqabyan]].

===New Testament===
The Ethiopian narrower [[New Testament]] canon consists of the entire 27 book [[Protocanonical books#New Testament|Christian protocanon]], which is almost universally accepted accross Christendom.<ref>Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (2003).</ref>

==Ethiopian broader Biblical Canon==
In addition to the nine books discussed below, all of the aforementioned books of the narrower canon are also technically part of the broader canon.

===Old Testament===
====Ethiopic Pseudo-Josephus==== 
The Book of Joseph ben Gurion, or [[Josippon|Pseudo-Josephus]], is a history of the Jewish people thought to be based upon the writings of [[Josephus]]. The canonical Ethiopic version (1-8 Yos<U+00EB>f w<U+00E4>ld<U+00E4> Koryon) has eight parts.

===New Testament===
The Ethiopian broader New Testament canon has eight books. These are the four books of Sinodos, the two divisions of the Book of the Covenant, Ethiopic Clement, and the Ethiopian Didascalia. Most of the liturature herein would either be considered part of the writings of the [[Apostolic Fathers]] or part of the [[Ancient Church Orders]]. 

====Sinodos====
The Ethiopic canonical Sinodos are four books of church order traditionally attributed to the [[Apostles]]. They are as follows: Ser`at<U+00E4> Seyon (30 canons), Te'ezaz (71 canons), Gessew (56 canons) and Abtelis (81 canons). Much of the material contained within these books are considered to be of [[Clementine literature|Clementine]] origin.

====The Book of the Covenant====
The Book of the Covenant, or M<U+00E4>shaf<U+00E4> Kidan, is counted in two parts. Part one has sixty sections and is mostly about church order. Part two is the sixty-first section and is a discourse of [[Jesus Christ]] to his disciples in [[Galilee]] following his [[resurrection]].

====Ethiopic Clement====
The Ethiopic canonical book of Clement, or Q<U+00E4>l<U+00EB>mentos, is distinct from the well known Epistles of [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] ([[1 Clement]] and [[2 Clement]]) or any other Clementine literature known in other traditions. It is a uniquely Ethiopic book in seven parts communicated by [[Saint Peter|Peter]] to Clement. 

====Ethiopic Didascalia====
The Ethiopian Didascalia, or Didesqelya, is a book of Church order in 43 chapters, distinct from the [[Didascalia Apostolorum]], but similar to books I-VII of the [[Apostolic Constitutions]], where it most likely finds its origins.<ref>Cowley (1974).</ref>
