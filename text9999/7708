'''Manal al-Sharif''' ({{lang-ar|'''<U+0645><U+0646><U+0627><U+0644> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0634><U+0631><U+064A><U+0641>'''}}) is a [[women's rights]] [[activist]] from [[Saudi Arabia]] who helped start a women's right to drive campaign in 2011. A women's rights activist who had previously filmed herself driving, [[Wajeha al-Huwaider]], filmed al-Sharif driving a car<ref name="France24_huwaiderfilmed" /> as part of the campaign. The video was posted on [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]].<ref name="AP_detained21May" /><ref name="cnn22May_detained" /> Al-Sharif was detained and released on 21 May<ref name="Indep23May_detained" /> and rearrested the following day.<ref name="RTBF_geek" /> On 30 May, al-Sharif was released on [[bail]],<ref name="AFP_Sharif2BFreed30May" /> on the conditions of returning for questioning if requested, not driving and not talking to the media.<ref name="NationalAE_SharifFree30May" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Associated Press]] associated the women's driving campaign with the wider pattern of the [[Arab Spring]] and the long duration of al-Sharif's detention with Saudi authorities' fear of protests.<ref name="nyt_reputation" /><ref name="AP_10days_26May" />

Following her driving campaign, al-Sharif remained an active critic of the Saudi government, [[Twitter|tweeting]] on issues including imprisoned female foreign workers, the lack of elections for the [[Shura Council]], and the murder of [[Lama al-Ghamdi]]. Her work has been recognized by ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and the [[Oslo Freedom Forum]].

==Background==
Manal al-Sharif graduated from [[King Abdulaziz University]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in computing and a [[Cisco Career Certifications|Cisco Career Certification]].<ref name="LinkedIn_cv" /> Until May 2012, she worked as an Internet Security Consultant<ref name="RTBF_geek" /> for [[Saudi Aramco]],<ref name="LinkedIn_cv" /> the Saudi national oil company.

==Women's rights campaigns==
In addition to her professional career, al-Sharif has campaigned for women's rights in Saudi Arabia for many years.<ref name="RTBF_geek" /> According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', al-Sharif "has a reputation for pulling stunts to highlight the lack of rights for women".<ref name="nyt_reputation" /> Regarding the 2011 women driving campaign, [[Amnesty International]] stated that "Manal al-Sharif is following in a long tradition of women activists around the world who have put themselves on the line to expose and challenge discriminatory laws and policies".<ref name="Amnesty_FreeManal24May" />

===Background===
{{main|Women's rights in Saudi Arabia#Mobility|women to drive movement}}
{{As of|2011}}, women in Saudi Arabia have limited freedom of movement and in practice are not allowed to drive motor vehicles. In 1990, dozens of women in [[Riyadh]] drove their cars in protest, were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs.<ref name="BBC_huwaider" /> In September 2007, the [[Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia]], co-founded by [[Wajeha al-Huwaider]]<ref name="cv_huwaider" /> and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, gave a 1,100 signature petition to [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] asking for women to be allowed to drive.<ref name="USState_huwaider" /> On [[International Women's Day]] 2008, Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on [[YouTube]].<ref name="BBC_huwaider" /><ref name="cv_huwaider" /><ref name="ABCUS_huwaider" /> Inspired by the [[Arab Spring]], a woman from [[Jeddah]], Najla Hariri, started driving in the second week of May 2011, stating "Before in Saudi, you never heard about protests. [But] after what has happened in the Middle East, we started to accept a group of people going outside and saying what they want in a loud voice, and this has had an impact on me."<ref name="BBC_NHariri" />

===2011 women driving campaign===
[[File:New Saudi Arabia's traffic sign (women2drive).gif|thumb|right|230px|A political cartoon by [[Carlos Latuff]] about the Saudi women movement to lift the ban on their right to drive titled "New Saudi Arabia's traffic sign"|alt=a woman waving victory sing while driving the car]]
In 2011, a group of women including Manal al-Sharif started a [[Facebook]] campaign named "Teach me how to drive so I can protect myself"<ref name="AP_detained21May" /> or "Women2Drive"<ref name="cnn22May_detained" /><ref name="RTBF_geek" /> that says that women should be allowed to drive. The campaign calls for women to start driving from 17 June 2011.<ref name="cnn22May_detained" /> {{As of|2011|05|21}}, about 12,000 readers of the Facebook page had expressed their support.<ref name="AP_detained21May" /> Al-Sharif describes the action as acting within women's rights, and "not protesting".<ref name="RTBF_geek" /> Wajeha al-Huwaider was impressed by the campaign and decided to help.<ref name="France24_huwaiderfilmed" />

In late May, Al-Sharif drove her car in [[Khobar]] with al-Huwaider filming.<ref name="France24_huwaiderfilmed" /> The video was posted to YouTube and Facebook. In the video, al-Sharif stated, "This is a volunteer campaign to help the girls of this country [learn to drive]. At least for times of emergency, God forbid. What if whoever is driving them gets a heart attack?" She was detained by the religious police ([[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|CPVPV]]) on 21 May and released after six hours.<ref name="Indep23May_detained" /><ref name="AP_detained21May" /> {{As of|2011|05|23}}, about 600,000 people had watched the video.<ref name="Indep23May_detained" />

The YouTube video of al-Sharif's drive became inaccessible at its original location, the Facebook page for the campaign was deleted, and the [[Twitter]] account used by al-Sharif was "copied and altered". Supporters republished the original video and Facebook page and a summary of al-Sharif's five recommended rules for the 17 June campaign were published on a blog and by the ''New York Times''.<ref name="nyt_instructions" /><ref name="alNafjan_5rules" />

On 22 May, al-Sharif was detained again<ref name="Indep23May_detained" /><ref name="cnn22May_detained" /> and the Director General of Traffic Administration, Major-General Suleiman Al-Ajlan, was questioned by journalists regarding traffic regulations related to women driving. Al-Ajlan stated that the journalists should "put the question" to members of the [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia]].<ref name="arabnews_alajlan" /> [[RTBF]] suggested that al-Sharif had been sentenced to five days' imprisonment.<ref name="RTBF_geek" />

The ''New York Times'' described al-Sharif's campaign as a "budding protest movement" that the Saudi government tried to "swiftly extinguish".<ref name="nyt_reputation" /> ''[[Associated Press]]'' said that Saudi authorities "cracked down harder than usual on al-Sharif, after seeing her case become a rallying call for youths anxious for change" in the context of the Arab Spring.<ref name="AP_10days_26May" /> Both news organisations attributed the long duration of al-Sharif's detention with Saudi authorities' fear of a wider [[2011 Saudi Arabian protests|protest movement in Saudi Arabia]].<ref name="nyt_reputation" /><ref name="AP_10days_26May" /> Amnesty International declared Al-Sharif to be a [[prisoner of conscience]] and called for her immediate and unconditional release.<ref name="Amnesty_FreeManal24May" />

The day after al-Sharif's arrest, another woman was detained for driving a car. She drove with two women passengers in [[Ar Rass]] and was detained by traffic police in the presence of the CPVPV. She was released after signing a statement that she would not drive again.<ref name="arabnews_qassimdriver23May" /> In reaction to al-Sharif's arrest, several more Saudi women published videos of themselves driving during the following days.<ref name="AP_10days_26May" /> On 26 May, authorities said that al-Sharif would remain in detention until 5 June 2011, according to lawyer Waleed Aboul Khair.<ref name="AP_10days_26May" /> Al-Sharif was conditionally freed on 30 May. Her lawyer Adnan al-Saleh said that she was charged with "[[incitement|inciting]] women to drive" and "rallying public opinion". {{As of|2011|05|31}}, it is unknown whether or not the charges were dropped.<ref name="NationalAE_SharifFree30May" /> The conditions of Al-Sharif's release include [[bail]],<ref name="AFP_Sharif2BFreed30May" /> returning for questioning if requested, not driving and not talking to the media.<ref name="NationalAE_SharifFree30May" /> As possible reasons for al-Sharif's early release, ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' cited al-Sharif having written a letter to King Abdullah, 4,500 Saudis signing an online petition to the King, and "an outpouring of indignation and disbelief by both Saudis and critics abroad that Ms al-Sharif was jailed for something that is not a moral or criminal offence."<ref name="NationalAE_SharifFree30May" />

Al-Sharif filed an objection with the General Directorate of Traffic in Riyadh on 15 November 2011 because of officials rejecting her driver's licence application.<ref name="Bloomberg_w2d_vs_Interior" /><ref name="cnn_5Feb" /> [[Samar Badawi]] filed a similar lawsuit on 4 February 2012.<ref name="teleg_w2d_vs_Interior" /><ref name="presstv_badawi_filed_4Feb" /><ref name="alNafjan_badawi_filed_4Feb" />

===2011 women prisoners campaign===
Following her 30 May release from prison, al-Sharif started a Twitter campaign called "Faraj" to release Saudi, [[Filipinos in Saudi Arabia|Filipino]] and [[Indonesians in Saudi Arabia|Indonesian]] women prisoners in the Dammam women's prison who "are locked up just because they owe a small sum of money but cannot afford to pay the debt".<ref name="Emirates247_prisonercampaign"/>  Al-Sharif said that the women prisoners were mostly [[Domestic worker#Domestic work and international migration|domestic workers]] who remained in prison after completing their prison terms, because they could not pay their debts and because their former [[kafala system#Saudi Arabia|Saudi employers]] did not help to release them or fund their flights to return to their countries of origin. She referred to 22 Indonesian women and named four women needing help and stated the amount of their debts. She called for donations to be made directly to the director of the Dammam women's prison in order to reimburse the women's debts and free them.<ref name="ArabNews_prisonercampaign" />

==Post-campaign==
On 23 January 2012, al-Sharif was mistakenly reported dead in a car crash in Jeddah.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jHQ2Eo0A9_tcO2KZZ48p-BZqwzJQ?docId=CNG.cd68393aa7a942d4b03ef87917c75ec4.e1 |title=Saudi female driver defies ban, has fatal accident |author= |date=23 January 2012 |work= |publisher=AFP |accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> On 25 January, ''[[The Guardian]]'' confirmed that she was in fact alive, and that the actual victim was an "unnamed member of a desert community" who was not involved in the female driving campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/25/saudi-woman-driver-crash-alive?newsfeed=true |title=Saudi woman driver reported killed in car crash is alive |author=Martin Chulov |date=25 January 2012 |work= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=25 January 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

Following al-Sharif's arrests, she reported being increasingly marginalized by her employers at Aramco. She quit following a dispute over her trip to Norway to receive the [[V<U+00E1>clav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent]].<ref name=DC/>

In December 2012, al-Sharif criticized an initiative by the Saudi government to inform husbands via [[SMS]] when their wives or dependents leave the country, in accordance with a law making men the legal guardians of their wives. "The small fact of the SMS story gives you the idea of the bigger problem with the whole guardianship system", she wrote on [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-34045562.html |title=Text-message tattling |author=Minky Worden |date=25 December 2012 |work=The Washington Post |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref> When [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] appointed women to the advisory [[Shura Council]] for the first time in January 2013, al-Sharif criticized the reform as too small, noting that the Council was still not an elected body and could not pass legislation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-212168610.html |title=Saudi king appoints women to advisory council for first time |author=Christine Hauser |date=12 January 2013 |work=International Herald Tribune |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref> In February, she worked to bring international attention to the case of five-year-old Lama al-Ghamdi, whose father [[Fayhan al-Ghamdi]] fatally raped, beat, and burned her; he served four months in jail and paid 200,000 riyals (roughly US$50,000) in [[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2895785731.html |work=Winnipeg Free Press |date=20 February 2013 |title=Saudis keep lid on rape scandals |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref>

== Recognition ==
''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine named al-Sharif one of the ''Top 100 Global Thinkers'' of 2011,<ref name="foreignpolicy"/> and she was listed in ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' list of ''Women Who (Briefly) Rocked'' in the same year.<ref name="forbes"/> In 2012, al-Sharif was named one of the Fearless Women of the year by ''[[The Daily Beast]]'',<ref name="thedailybeast"/> and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named her [[Time 100|one of the 100 most influential people of 2012]].<ref name="time"/> She was also one of three people awarded the first annual V<U+00E1>clav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent at the [[Oslo Freedom Forum]].<ref name=DC/>
