'''Bradley Joseph''' (born 1965, [[Willmar, Minnesota]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[composer]], [[pianist]]/[[keyboardist]], [[music arranger|arranger]], and [[recording artist]].  Active since 1983, he played in various rock bands throughout the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] until New Age artist [[Yanni]] hired him sight unseen based on a tape of his own compositions.  He was a featured concert keyboardist with Yanni through six major tours and appears in the 1993 multi-platinum album and video, ''[[Yanni Live at the Acropolis]]''.<ref name="Metro People Bradley Joseph">{{cite news|title = Metro People Bradley Joseph|publisher = [[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]/[http://www.twincities.com/archives TwinCities.com]

Joseph's solo career began in 1994 when he independently released ''[[Hear the Masses]],'' featuring many of his Yanni bandmates.

===Early career===
====Yanni====
In 1988, Joseph caught the attention of contemporary instrumental artist [[Yanni]] via a mutual friend, guitarist [[Dugan McNeill]].  When Yanni heard Joseph's compositions and arrangements, he was hired to join his core band, replacing [[John Tesh]].<ref name="Yanni in Words">{{cite book|last = Yanni

| accessdate =2007-04-03}}</ref>  In a 2002 interview with ''Indie Journal'' Joseph recalls, "I recorded a demo tape of some of some original material.

After moving to [[Los Angeles]] at age 23, he composed, arranged, and performed alongside Yanni for more than six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni was approaching worldwide fame.<ref name="Bradley Joseph to play for Concerts in the Park">{{cite news|title = Bradley Joseph to play for Concerts in the Park

====Sheena Easton====
In between tours with Yanni, Joseph performed with [[Sheena Easton]] for four years as her co-musical director and lead keyboardist.<ref name="Continuing Journey">{{cite news|last = Polta|first = Anne|title = Continuing Journey: Bradley Joseph sustains music career with songwriting, recording|publisher = West Central Tribune (wctrib.com) ([[Minnesota]], [[United States|USA]])|date = [[2007-02-08]]| url =https://secure.forumcomm.com/willmar/articles/index.cfm?page=purchase&id=16233&user_id=277495&CFID=44566&CFTOKEN=86938394&jsessionid=8830333c7481362c1537|accessdate = 2007-02-18}}</ref>  "It was a great transition from Yanni because it made me musically aware again", he said in reference to Easton's [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] style. "I went back to where I started but it felt like a new invention."<ref name="Joseph has Encountered Fame"/> When asked by Fred Wheeler how he got hooked up with Sheena Easton, Joseph replied that he was recommended by a former road manager.  He was included in a try-out with four others, rehearsed with the band, they then cut it down to two, and rehearsed with Sheena for the final cut.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  Extensive tour venues with Easton included Japan, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, and the United States, as well as routine appearances in [[Las Vegas]] and [[Atlantic City]]. He appeared with her on the ''[[Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' when she performed her new single at the time, "My Cheri".<ref name="Joseph Tonight Show">{{cite news|last = Miller|first = Gary|title = Joseph 'Tonight Show'

===Solo career===
<blockquote>''"I am a composer first and foremost, and have always believed that being able to write memorable melodies is what sets musicians apart."''<ref name="Official bio"/></blockquote> 

[[Image:Hear the Masses.gif|right|thumb|The 1994 release of Joseph's  debut album, ''[[Hear the Masses]]'', an upbeat instrumental album featuring several of Joseph's Yanni bandmates.]] <!-- FAIR USE of Hear_the_Masses.gif: see image  description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Hear_the_Masses.gif for rationale -->

In 1994, between world tours, Joseph released his debut album, ''[[Hear the Masses]]'', a self-produced, self-published release under the More Core Records label consisting of 10 original compositions.  He invited many of his bandmates, whom he had met through Yanni, to contribute.  They include [[Charlie Adams (drummer)|Charlie Adams]] (drums, percussion); [[Ric Fierabracci]] (fretless bass); [[Jeanette Clinger]] (vocals), and [[Grammy]]-winning violinist [[Charlie Bisharat]].  Other guest artists include Larry Preston (guitar), and Terry Brau <U+2014> featured on numerous Bradley Joseph recordings <U+2014> playing trumpet, saxophone, and [[fluegelhorn]]. 

Joseph's style on his debut album attracted the attention of [[Narada Productions]], a [[Virgin Records]] subsidiary.  This resulted in ''[[Rapture (Bradley Joseph album)|Rapture]]'' which was recorded with a 50-piece orchestra.<ref name="Blllboard Magazine">{{cite web|url= http://web.archive.org/web/19970530224716/www.bradleyjoseph.com/billboard.html|title= ''Rapture'' at Pachyderm.|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]] (retrieved from archived version of bradleyjoseph.com)|date=1997|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>  ''Wind and Wire Magazine'' contributor, Michael Debbage, recalls, "It was the year 1997 and New Age music had already peaked commercially as the interest and exposure seemed to lag. The genres main labels - Narada, Windham Music and Higher Octave - were beginning to explore worldly themes versus the warm, earthly, acoustic themes that prior artists had established. It appeared that the abundance of new artists was becoming a dying breed. An exception to the rule was Bradley Joseph, who released his first mainstream album ''Rapture'' to glorious reviews, and to this day it remains his tour de force."<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage">{{cite web|author=Debbage, Michael |url=http://www.windandwire.com/february/the_journey_continues.htm |title= Review of ''The Journey Continues''

|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>  One of Joseph's compositions, "[[The Glen]]", was written for the album ''[[Stories (Narada Artist Collection)|Stories, a Narada Artist Collection]]'', and is now also featured on ''[[20 Years of Narada Piano]]''.  His work is included in other Narada compilation projects as well.

Joseph started Robbins Island Music in 1998, composing, producing, and distributing his own recordings.  Hence, ''[[Solo Journey]]'' was released and is comprised of eleven solo piano compositions.  It is characterized by Debbage as being a "scaled down introspective, ... and while simplistic was still breath-taking."<ref name="Christmas Around the World at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage">{{cite web|author=Debbage, Michael| url=http://www2.bitstream.net/~billb/bradley_joseph.htm|title= Review of ''Christmas Around the World''|publisher= Wind and Wire Magazine (windandwire.com)|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>  Later releases include ''[[Christmas Around the World (Bradley Joseph album)|Christmas Around the World]]'' reaching NAV's top 100 radio playlist;<ref name="New Age Voice">New Age Voice, currently {{cite web|url= http://www.newagereporter.com/home/welcome.asp|title= New Age Reporter|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref> and ''[[One Deep Breath]]'' also holding a position on NAV's top 100 radio chart for over six months.<ref name="NAV's top 100">{{cite web |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20020607112717/www.newagevoice.com/chart13.htm|title= 2002 New Age Voice Top 100 Radio Chart|publisher = New Age Reporter (archived version newagevoice.com)|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>  Bill Binkleman writes, ''"One Deep Breath'' is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between. While I doubt fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces as well as for lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music."<ref name="One Deep Breath-Wind and Wire Magazine-BB">{{cite web |author=Binkelman, Bill |url= http://www2.bitstream.net/~billb/bradley_joseph.htm|title= Review of ''One Deep Breath''|publisher = Wind and Wire Magazine (windandwire.com)|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>  "The vocal expressions by Clystie Whang and Joseph have devotional qualities.

[[Image:Thejourneycontinues.jpg|left|thumb|The 2003 release of ''[[The Journey Continues]]'' features Joseph on solo piano and is meant to be a sequel to his 3rd album, ''Solo Journey''.  It was written during sound checks on Yanni's ''[[Ethnicity (Yanni album)|Ethnicity]]'' world tour.]]

He wrote his sixth album after sound checks during Yanni's ''[[Ethnicity (Yanni album)|Ethnicity]]'' tour. ''[[The Journey Continues]]'', a sequel to ''Solo Journey'', again features Joseph on solo piano.  Debbage writes, "The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with ''Solo Journey'' that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that ''The Journey Continues'' is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor."<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  Debbage also voted this album as one of his top 15 recordings of 2003.<ref name="Wind and Wire best of 2003"> {{cite web |url= http://www.windandwire.com/february/best_of_2003.htm

Past recipients include [[Mark Dayton]], [[Marlene Johnson]], [[Walter Mondale]], and [[Dave Winfield]]. In the same year, Orange Music released two compilation CDs;  ''[[The Road Ahead (Bradley Joseph album)|The Road Ahead]]'' and ''[[In the Heart of Everyone]]'', in addition to re-releasing his ''Christmas Around the World'' album.  These were distributed throughout Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia.<ref name="Orange Music Catalog">{{cite web

Subsequent releases include ''[[For the Love of It (Bradley Joseph album)|For the Love of It]]'' and ''[[Piano Love Songs]]'', in which Joseph uses piano, orchestra, and soft rhythms to cover melodies such as "[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]" ([[Burt Bacharach]]), and "[[Fields of Gold]]" ([[Sting]]). Additionally, a DVD was released using Joseph's music throughout, ''Isle Royale Impressions Volume II'', containing video footage by Carl TerHaar of scenery and wildlife from the [[Isle Royale National Park]] in Michigan.<ref name="IRNHA">{{cite web|url= http://www.irnha.org/the.store?cart_id=5565261.31938&page=/catalog/IRNHAproducts.html#video

==Musical style and composition==
In an interview with ''Indie Journal,'' Joseph has said that when writing music he prefers to concentrate on the melody first, stating, "Basically, I write from a two person standpoint.  First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener."<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  The range of ways in which he utilizes [[synthesizer]]s is equally as characteristic, inspired early in life by keyboard-oriented pop/rock bands like [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[Journey (band)|Journey]].<ref name="Official bio"/>

Joseph's musical style and direction have varied over time.  His recordings can offer orchestral compositions such as in the albums ''Hear the Masses'' or ''Rapture'' which features intimate piano pieces, quartets, and full orchestrations, "combining smooth jazz with contemporary instrumental themes".<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  In contrast, the albums ''Solo Journey'' and ''The Journey Continues'' "...features Joseph and his piano with no additional clutter", and are considered to be "stripped back and basic" by Michael Debbage of ''Wind and Wire Magazine''. "There is color in the songs via their understated melodies."<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  As examples, Debbage describes Joseph as using a chord progression that translates into a strolling rhythm in the song "The Road Ahead", and "The confidant 'Within A Painting' has Joseph fluttering on the piano improvising much like his peer [[Michael Jones]]."<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  ''Solo Piano Publications''' contributor, Kathy Parsons, writes, "My favorite track on ''Solo Journey'' is 'The Long, Last Mile', which starts out with a bittersweet melody, and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello, winds, and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano. Then it breaks off, and the opening melody returns."  She also remarks, "'The First Snow' is a lovely vignette that gently describes the quiet but dazzling splendor of the first snow of the season.  Joseph makes effective use of arpeggiated chords in the upper registers to depict the light dancing in sparkles."<ref name="SPP-Kathy Parsons-SJ">{{cite web |author=Parsons, Kathy|url=http://www.solopianopublications.com/reviews/joseph.htm |title=Review of ''Solo Journey''|publisher = Solo Piano Publications (solopianopublications.com)|date|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>  Debbage describes "A Minnesota Snowfall" from the album ''Christmas Around the World'' as having "a more naked, bare-boned [[ballad]] approach".<ref name="Christmas Around the World at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  

In discussing the album ''One Deep Breath'', Binkleman observes, "...Joseph departs dramatically from the previous more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, ''Hear the Masses'' and ''Rapture''. ''One Deep Breath'' has two separate 'personalities': piano and keyboard-based ambient/new age soundscapes (primarily the first and last tracks) and more adult contemporary classically flavored songs."<ref name="One Deep Breath-Wind and Wire Magazine-BB"/>  He goes on to say, "...some [tracks] are similar to the work of artists like [[David Lanz]], [[Kevin Kern]] and others who bring a rich melodic sensibility to piano-led new age/adult contemporary music."<ref name="One Deep Breath-Wind and Wire Magazine-BB"/>  Parsons describes the album as "...a fascinating combination of structured melodic pieces and free-form, ambient compositions."  "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph<U+2019>s sound, but his musical voice is his own."<ref name="SPP-Kathy Parsons-ODB">{{cite web |author=Parsons,Kathy|url=http://www.solopianopublications.com/reviews/joseph.htm|title=Review of ''One Deep Breath''|publisher = Solo Piano Publications (solopianopublications.com)|date|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>  

West Central Tribune's Anne Polta reports that Joseph often references the past when he names his songs and his music is frequently reminiscent of his rural [[Minnesota]] roots.<ref name="Continuing Journey"/>  "Wind Farmer" was inspired by childhood visits to a relative's farm near [[Olivia, Minnesota|Olivia]], and his company, Robbins Island Music, is named after a city park in [[Willmar, Minnesota|Willmar]].<ref name="Continuing Journey"/>
