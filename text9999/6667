'''Frederick George Hobson''', known as '''Fred Leslie''' (1 April 1855 &ndash; 7 December 1892), was an [[English people|English]] [[actor]], singer, comedian and dramatist.

Beginning his career in [[operetta]], Leslie became best known for starring in, and writing (under the pseudonym '''A. C. Torr''', a pun on the word "actor"), popular [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque plays]] and other comic works of theatre.  

==Biography==
Leslie was born in [[Woolwich]], London, England.  He was the youngest son of Charles Hobson, a wealthy military outfitter, and Sarah Hobson, n<U+00E9>e Pye.  Leslie was educated in Woolwich, [[Lewisham]] and [[Pas-de-Calais]].  As a young man, he performed in amateur plays while working in commerce.  Leslie married Louisa (Louie) Agate in 1879.  The couple had three children.  The oldest of these, William Herbert Leslie Hobson (1880<U+2013>1945), became a stage and film actor and singer also using the name "Fred Leslie".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504104/bio Fred Leslie's son's entry at the IMDB database]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=49563 Fred Leslie's son's entry at the IBDB database]</ref>

===Career===
After briefly touring the British provinces, he made his first stage appearance in [[London]] at the [[Royalty Theatre]] as old Colonel Hardy in ''Paul Pry'' in 1878.<ref name=Timesobit>''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 8 December 1892, p. 5</ref>  He was soon engaged by [[Kate Santley]] at the Royalty, where he played the title role in ''Mr Lewis''. At the same theatre in 1879, he played the part of Po-Hi opposite Santley in ''[[Tita in Thibet]]'', a two act comedy musical by [[Frank Desprez]].  He next played Agamemnon (under the name of "Mr Leslie") in ''[[La belle H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne]]'' by ''[[Jacques Offenbach]]''.  His vocal quality suited him to play the comic [[baritone]] roles in French operettas.<ref name=dnb>G<U+00E4>nzl, Kurt.

In 1882, Leslie found wide success as the title character in the [[operetta]] ''[[Rip Van Winkle (operetta)|Rip Van Winkle]]'', by [[Robert Planquette]], at the [[Comedy Theatre]], also starring [[W. S. Penley]].<ref>Traubner, pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref>  In 1882 and 1883 he played in [[United States|America]] at the [[Casino Theatre (Broadway)|Casino Theatre]] and elsewhere with the [[McCaull Comic Opera Company]] in ''The Merry War'' and ''[[The Beggar Student]]''.<ref name=NYTimesobit>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9502E6DA1338E233A2575BC0A9649D94639ED7CF "Obituary: Fred Leslie Dead",] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 8 December 1892</ref>  In 1884 he played in ''Fay o' Fire'', which featured [[Marie Tempest]] in one of her first roles.  The same year, at the Comedy Theatre, he played in [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Edmond Audran]]'s adaptation, ''The Great Mogul'' with [[Florence St. John]], [[Frank Wyatt (singer)|Frank Wyatt]] and [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]].<ref>Traubner, p. 91</ref><ref>''The Times'', 19 November 1884, p. 6, col. D</ref>   

In 1885 Leslie joined the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] company as Jonathan Wild in [[H. P. Stephens]] and W. Yardley's [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'', with music by [[Meyer Lutz]], and also starring [[Nellie Farren]] as Jack.  The piece was a hit, and for the next seven years he and Farren were the pillars of the popular Gaiety Theatre burlesques.<ref>Hollingshead (1898), pp. 443<U+2013>44</ref>  In 1887, his ''Miss Esmeralda'' was particularly successful, while ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'', in which he played a monster in touch with his feminine side, was a flop.  In 1888-89, Leslie, with Farren's Gaiety company, toured in the U.S. and Australia, in ''Monte Cristo, Jr.'' and ''Miss Esmeralda'' (together with [[Sylvia Grey]], [[Marion Hood]] and [[Letty Lind]]).<ref>Moratti, Mel. [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~melbear/1888.htm "Theatre in Melbourne 1888"] at the Gilbert and Sullivan Down Under site</ref>  At the same time, Leslie played roles in other pieces, for example ''David Garrick'' by [[Thomas W. Robertson]] at the Gaiety in 1886.<ref>Adams, p. 381</ref>

Leslie's Don Caesar de Bazan in ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blas<U+00E9> Rou<U+00E9>]]'' (1888, a take off of [[Victor Hugo]]<U+2019>s play ''[[Ruy Blas]]''), was perhaps the most popular of his later parts, and he and Farren starred at the Gaiety and toured in this production and in ''Miss Esmeralda'', and ''Joan of Arc'' (1891).<ref>Traubner, pp. 196<U+2013>97</ref>  In 1891, Leslie and Farren again toured Australia with the Gaiety company in ''Ruy Blas'' and ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (with [[Sidney Jones]] as conductor).<ref>Moratti, Mel.  [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~melbear/1891.htm "Theatre in Melbourne 1891"] at the Gilbert and Sullivan Down Under site</ref>  Leslie died while rehearsing for his last burlesque, ''Don Juan'' (with lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).<ref name=NYTimesobit/>  His early death, coupled with Farren's illness and retirement in 1892, brought to an end the type of Gaiety burlesque associated with them, at the same time that [[Edwardian musical comedy]] came to dominate the London theatre.

Leslie was known for his versatility, agility, entertaining personality and talent as a mimic.<ref name=NYTimesobit/>  His performances, including singing (he was a [[baritone]]), dancing, clowning and whistling, were noted for their high spirits and ludicrous charm.<ref name=Timesobit/>  Under the pseudonym of "A. C. Torr", he was part-author of many of his burlesques and also wrote the burlesque ''Guy Fawkes Jr'' for Arthur Roberts in 1890.<ref>Adams, p. 621</ref>  Although Leslie is remembered best for the burlesques, he was a fine comic actor whom the critic [[Clement Scott]] called "one of the great lyric and comic artists of my time."<ref name=dnb/>

===Early death===
Leslie died of [[typhoid fever]] at his home in London at the age of 37.<ref name=NYTimesobit/>  He was buried in Charlton cemetery in [[Greenwich]], England.<ref name=dnb/>
