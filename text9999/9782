'''Commonwealth Stadium''' is an open-air, [[all-seater stadium|all-seater]] [[multipurpose stadium]] located in the [[McCauley, Edmonton|McCauley]] neighbourhood of the Canadian city of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. Its main tenant is the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), although it is also used for [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[soccer]] and [[rugby union]], as well as concerts. The [[stadium]] has a [[seating capacity]] of 56,302, making it the second-largest in Canada. Construction commenced in 1975 and the venue opened ahead of the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]], replacing the adjacent [[Clarke Stadium]] as the Eskimos home. It received a major expansion ahead of the [[1983 Summer Universiade]], when it reached a capacity of 60,081. The stadium had, for a long time as the only CFL venue, natural grass, until [[FieldTurf]] Duraspine Pro was installed in 2010.

Events at the stadium include four [[Grey Cup]]s, the CFL's [[championship game]], and the [[2001 World Championships in Athletics]]. Soccer tournaments include nine [[FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches with [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada Men's National Soccer Team]], two versions of the invitational [[Canada Cup (soccer)|Canada Cup]], the [[1996 CONCACAF Men's Pre-Olympic Tournament]], the [[2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship]] and the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. [[FC Edmonton]] has since 2011 played its [[Canadian Championship]] matches at Commonwealth Stadium. The venue is scheduled to host matches during the [[2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]] and the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]]. In rugby, Commonwealth has hosted the [[2006 Women's Rugby World Cup]] and three editions of the [[Churchill Cup]]. The stadium is also listed as a potential site for the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]], if Canada were to win the event.

==History==
The main stadium in Edmonton was Clarke Stadium, which opened in 1939 and was built on a {{convert|38|acre|adj=on}} plot of land. Work on applying to host the 1978 Commonwealth Games started in the early 1970s. With both federal, provincial and city funding backing the bid, it called for a massive renovation of the city's various sporting venues. The original plans called for Clarke Stadium to be rebuilt and expanded to host the athletics events. By 1974 there was consensus that Clarke Stadium would not be sufficient and that an all-new stadium should be built. Several locations and sizes were discussed, with [[Edmonton City Council]] in January 1975 landing on building a 40,000 seat venue next to Clarke Stadium.<ref name=payne>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/sport_recreation/history-of-commonwealth-stadiu.aspx |title=History of Commonwealth Stadium |last=Payne |first=Michael |publisher=[[Edmonton City Council|City of Edmonton]] |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> The venue was designed by Ragan, Bell, McManus Consultants.<ref name=roof>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ljtVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_z0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1962,3804035&hl=en |title=Edmonton rejects costly roof |work=[[The Leader-Post]] |date=December 12, 1975 |page=46 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> The city also decided to build to additional new venues: [[Kinsmen Field House|Kinsmen Aquatic Centre]] and [[Argyll Velodrome]].<ref name=payne /> They based their design on [[Jack Trice Stadium]] in the US city of [[Ames, Iowa]].<ref name=herzog>{{cite journal |url=http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view2?CONTENT_ID=475 |title=Commonwealth Stadium Marks 25 Years |last=Herzog |first=Lawrence |page=July 31, 2003 |journal=Inside Edmonton |issue=30 |volume=21 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref>

Part of the public support for the stadium came from it being built to also support being used by the Eskimos. The plans were met with opposition from local residents. There were also discussions regarding the necessity of a $50,000 royal retirement room and the allocation of training and office space to the Eskimos. The largest discussion was related to whether the stadium needed a roof or dome. As the roof would cost $18.2 million, there was limited public support and the stadium was built without one.<ref name=payne /> In an attempt to further the roof process, the Eskimos offered to pay $1.6 million towards the roof.<ref name=herzog /> An enclosement would not be permitted used during the Commonwealth Games, so the design would have to call for the roof to be added afterwards. Among the opponents of the roof was Commonwealth Games Foundation President Maury Van Vilet, that experience from construction of the Olympic Stadium in Montreal showed the necessity of building a simple structure. An alternative design, which would have cost an additional $7.3 million, was launched by the Eskimos in August 1975, but rejected by the city council.<ref name=roof /> A major concern for the city council were the large [[cost overruns]] which were being experienced in Montreal at the time.<ref name=herzog />

[[File:Commonwealth Stadium Edmonton Alberta Canada 01A.jpg|thumb|Upper tiers]]
Excavation started in December 1974 and saw the removal of 400,000 cubic meters (500,000&nbsp;cu.&nbsp;yd.) of earthwork. A local action committee, Action Edmonton, demanded in early 1975 that construction be halted and the venue relocated. The city estimated that this would cost an additional $2.5 million and delay the process with eight months.<ref name=herzog /> The decision to not enclose the stadium was taken on December 10, 1975.<ref name=roof /> The venue was thus not designed to allow a roof, air-filled or stiff, to be retrofitted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cfldb.ca/stadium-status/edmonton/ |title=Status of Edmonton Stadiums |publisher=CFLDB |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> The venue was built on the former site of the Rat Creek Dump and the Williamson Slaughter House. During excavation, remains from the dump were struck, resulting in archaeological surveys being carried out.<ref name=herzog /> Construction of the [[Edmonton Light Rail Transit]]'s inaugural [[Capital Line]] commenced in 1974 and was opened in time for the Commonwealth Games, which allowed spectators to take the LRT from [[Stadium LRT Station|Stadium Station]] to downtown Edmonton.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view2?CONTENT_ID=2337 |title=When the LRT came to Edmonton |last=Herzog |first=Lawrence |page=September 25, 2008 |journal=It's Our Heritage |issue=38 |volume=26 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref>

Construction of the stadium was completed within budget and time.<ref name=payne /> When the venue opened it had a capacity for 42,500 and a natural grass turf.<ref name=home>{{cite web |url=http://stats.cfldb.ca/team/edmonton-eskimos/stadiums/ |title=Home Stadiums of the Edmonton Eskimos |publisher=CFLDB |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> Unlike most other major stadiums in Canada, Commonwealth Stadium elected for a natural grass turf.<ref name=payne /> The original configuration included 39,384 bucket seats and 3,200 bench seating on the north end. The venue was officially opened on July 15, 1978 in an event which attracted 15,000 spectators.<ref name=herzog /> The venue went through a slight expansion in 1980, when the seating capacity was increased to 43,346.<ref name=home /> Additional proposals for a roof, ranging from $10 to $32 million in cost, were presented in 1979, but since then the discussion of covering the stadium died out.<ref name=herzog />

Edmonton was selected to host the 1983 Summer Universiade, and in 1981 the city council approved an $11 million upgrade to the venue, which added a further 18,000 seats to the upper tiers and the north end zone;<ref name=herzog /> this gave a capacity of 59,912 in 1982 and 60,081 from 1983.<ref name=home /> For special events, such as the Grey Cup, additional seating could be added. This made it the second-largest stadium in Canada, after [[Montreal]]'s [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]], and the largest without a dome.<ref name=payne />

[[File:Commonwealth Stadium Edmonton Alberta Canada 07A.jpg|thumb|left|The facade]]
Ahead of the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, the stadium received a $24-million facelift. Major investments included a new facade, an enlargement of the concourse, improved lighting, a new [[scoreboard]] and an all-new [[all-weather running track]].<ref name=herzog /> Ahead of the [[2008 Edmonton Eskimos season|2008 season]] the stadium underwent a reconfiguration, reducing its capacity to 59,537.<ref name=home /> For the nine seasons prior to 2010, the turf was replaced eight times, costing $50,000 per time.<ref name=sarrazin>{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/Edmonton/2010/05/10/13897016.html |title=Artificial turf on the way: Commonwealth Stadium losing grass |last=Sarrazin |first=Megan |publisher=[[Canoe]] |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> The natural grass turf was replaced with [[FieldTurf]] Duraspine Pro in May 2010, making the Eskimos the last CFL team to switch to [[artificial turf]].<ref name=turf>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfl.ca/article/edmonton-fieldturf-fast-facts |title=Edmonton FieldTurf fast facts |publisher=[[Canadian Football League]] |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> The investment cost $2.6 million and was split evenly between the city and the Eskimos.<ref name=sarrazin /> The work included the removal of {{convert|12400|m3|sp=us}} of soil,<ref name=turf /> and the turf has a life expectancy of eight to ten years. It will cost half a million dollars to replace. The reason for the replacement was to reduce injuries, reduce the need for watering and fertilizer, will allow a green turf for the entire season, including at Grey Cups, will allow the venue to host more events, as concerts and the like will not damage the field, and that turf is recycled and recyclable.<ref name=sarrazin />

Commonwealth Stadium underwent a $112-million facelift starting in 2009. The main investment was a [[field house]], new locker rooms, a hosting area and two floors of office space.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/sports/football/2009/11/28/11963291-sun.html |title= A season of league-wide ups and downs in the CFL |last=Jones |first=Terry |work=[[Edmonton Sun]] |date=November 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> The complex, named the Commonwealth Community Recreation Center and designed by MacLennan Jaunkalns Miller Architects and HIP Architects, also consists of an aquatic center, a fitness center.<ref name=designboom>{{cite web |url=http://www.designboom.com/architecture/mjma-commonwealth-community-recreation-center-edmonton/ |title=MJMArchitects: commonwealth community recreation center, edmonton |publisher=Designboom |date=May 28, 2013 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> The complex was completed in February 2012.<ref name=clark />

Following the [[98th Grey Cup|2010 Grey Cup]], the program to replace the seating at the stadium commenced. All seating was replaced with new and wider seats, and the color changed from red and orange to green and yellow<U+2014>the Eskimos' colors. Approval of the $12 million upgrade was made by the city council on May 18, 2011, and it took eleven months to select a supplier, with installation starting in June 2012. The upgrade removed all bench seating, which had been in place in the corners and end zones, resulting in an all-seater stadium. Because of wider seats, {{convert|48|cm|sp=us|adj=on}} being replaced with {{convert|53|cm|sp=us|adj=on}}, capacity for the venue as reduced to 56,302. The process reduced the number of seats on rows by one.<ref name=sittin>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/04/10/esks-fans-sittin-pretty |title=Esks fans sittin' pretty |last=Jones |first=Terry |work=[[Edmonton Sun]] |date=April 10, 2012 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> With the seating installed, the total investment in the venue exceeded $200 million. The Eskimos estimated in 2011 that the [[replacement cost]] of the venue was "significantly beyond" half a billion dollars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/sports/columnists/terry_jones/2011/02/22/17372166.html |title=Esks benefit from Cup success |last=Jones |first=Terry |work=[[Edmonton Sun]] |date=February 22, 2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref>

Any holder of a pre-purchased ticket or an [[Edmonton Transit System]] ticket can travel for free on the services from these lots to Commonwealth Stadium. The program is initiated by the city to minimize parking and congestion in the stadium's neighborhood. Game day tickets are also valid fare on the LRT service from two hours prior to games to two hours after games. The city declares a neighborhood parking ban in the vicinity of the stadium during games, with only cars with residential permits being allowed to be parked on streets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/ets/seasonal_events_attractions/football-park-ride.aspx |title=Football Park & Ride |publisher=[[Edmonton City Council|City of Edmonton]] |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref>
