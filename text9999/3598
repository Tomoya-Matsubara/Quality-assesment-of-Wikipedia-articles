'''Wentwood''' ({{lang-cy|Coed Gwent}}) is a [[forest]]ed area of [[hill]]s, rising to 309&nbsp;metres (1,014&nbsp;ft), in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], [[South Wales]].  It is located to the north east of, and partly within the boundaries of, the city of [[Newport]]. 

== Geology ==
Wentwood is underlain by [[sandstone]]s which are assigned to the [[Old Red Sandstone#The Anglo-Welsh Basin|Brownstones Formation]] of the [[Old Red Sandstone]], a suite of [[sedimentary rocks]] laid down during the [[Devonian period]]. The [[strata (geology)|beds]] dip gently to moderately in a south-easterly direction. It is the southernmost part of a range of hills formed by the relatively hard-wearing Brownstones sandstones which stretch in a rough arc northwards through eastern [[Monmouthshire]], the broadly west-facing [[escarpment|scarps]] of which are generally well wooded.<ref>British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map sheet 233 ''Monmouth''</ref>
== Village ==
There is a Small Area of [[Houses]] in Wentwood which is known as the Wentwood Village and{{Infobox UK place

  there is also a [[Church]] in Wentwood called Gilgal [[Church]]
== Ancient woodland ==

It is the largest [[ancient woodland]] in [[Wales]] and the ninth largest in the [[UK]]. The current wooded area is a remnant of a much larger ancient forest which once extended between the rivers [[River Usk|Usk]] and [[River Wye|Wye]] and which divided the old [[kingdom of Gwent]] into two - ''Gwent Uwchcoed'' and ''Iscoed'', that is, above and below the wood.

== Prehistory ==

The area contains [[bronze age]] burial mounds, a [[stone circle]], and a [[Megalithic]] alignment on [[Gray Hill, Monmouthshire]].

== Middle ages ==

In the [[Middle ages]], the woods belonged to the lordship of [[Chepstow]] and provided hunting preserves, and timber, fuel and pasturage for the tenants of nearby [[manorialism|manor]]s. The Royal Forest of Wentwood had its own forest laws and courts were held twice yearly at Forester's Oaks, above Wentwood Reservoir.

These courts tried luckless locals charged with a range of crimes within the forest boundaries, from sheep stealing to poaching [[deer]]. These crimes were taken so seriously that culprits were hanged from one of the two Forester's Oaks. The last offender dealt with in this severe way was hanged as recently as 1829.

== Later history ==

The edges of the wood were gradually cleared and felled away in the 16th century and 17th century by farmers, and many stands of substantial mature [[Welsh oak (tree)|Welsh Oaks]] were felled to meet the demand for stout oak heartwoods in [[Royal Navy]] battleships and [[Man o' War|men o' war]] of the [[Napoleonic]] era of the 19th century, such as [[HMS Victory]] and others,  but the heart of the forest remained preserved for [[charcoal]] production, a necessity for the [[iron]] industry and local [[ironworks]].

The first [[conifer]] plantations were planted at Wentwood by 1880, and most of the native trees were felled during [[World War I]] to provide timber for props and supports for the trenches.  

When the area was replanted by the [[Forestry Commission]] in the 1950s and 1960s, the original broadleaved [[deciduous]] trees were largely replaced with non-native [[conifer]]s, damaging the woodland habitat. More recently, broadleaved trees have been allowed to grow back.

== Recreation area ==

Wentwood and its surrounding areas are popular with [[hillwalking]] and [[mountain biking]] enthusiasts and the Wentwood Reservoir, opened in 1904, is a centre for [[trout]] fishing.  The area is also home to thousands of wildlife species. These include 75 species of bird, including rare [[turtle dove]]s, [[nightjar]]s and [[spotted flycatcher]]s; [[dormouse|dormice]]; [[otters]]; [[pipistrelle]] bats; and ancient woodland plants, such as wild [[daffodil]], [[wood sorrel]], and [[yellow pimpernel]].

In 2006, the [[Woodland Trust]] completed the purchase of some 352 [[hectare]]s (nearly 900 [[acre]]s) of Wentwood after a high-profile campaign, and plans a programme of conservation and restoration.

In April 2007, an illegal [[rave]] event took place in Wentwood, with around 3,000 people before it was broken up.
