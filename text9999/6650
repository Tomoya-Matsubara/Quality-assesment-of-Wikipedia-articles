'''''noitulovE'''''<ref>Occasionally, and erroneously, referred to as '''''Evolution''''', as the title is an [[anagram]] of the word.</ref> is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Television advertisement|television and cinema]] [[advertising|advertisement]] launched by [[Diageo]] in 2005 to promote [[Guinness]]-brand [[draught beer|draught]] [[stout]]. The sixty-second piece formed the cornerstone of a [[Pound Sterling|<U+00A3>]]15M [[advertising campaign]] targeting men in their late-twenties and early-thirties. The commercial follows three patrons of a [[London]] [[public house|pub]] on a journey back through time, showing the group "de-evolving" through a number of forms, from ape, to lizard, to mudskipper. The commercial was handled by the [[advertising agency]] [[Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO]], who were given a budget of <U+00A3>1.3M. It was directed by [[Daniel Kleinman]]. Production was contracted to [[Kleinman Productions]], with [[post-production]] delegated to [[Framestore CFC]]. It premiered on British television on [[3 October]] [[2005]]. 

''noitulovE'' is the fifth television/cinema piece in the [[Good things come to those who wait]] series, and its premiere marked the end of a four-year hiatus. The advert, together with its associated campaign, was a critical and financial success. It received over thirty awards from professional organisations in the advertising and television industries, and was the most-awarded commercial worldwide in 2006. The impact of the campaign was such that during a period in which the UK [[beer]] market experienced a substantial decline in [[revenue]], Guinness reported that its year-on-year earnings within the region had noticeably increased. At the same time, Guinness achieved its highest ever volume and value shares and became the [[Market dominance|market leader]] within the region. This was attributed in no small part to the positive reception garnered by ''noitulovE''.

==Sequence==
The piece begins with three patrons taking their first sip of Guinness stout in a London pub. To the accompaniment of [[Sammy Davis Jr.|Sammy Davis Jr]]'s rendition of "The Rhythm of Life", a song from the 1966 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Sweet Charity]]'', a reverse-motion sequence begins, as the three retreat from the bar and into the street, and other patrons disappear as they pass. As they move down the street, a reverse [[time-lapse]]-style sequence transforms their clothes to match a rapidly changing urban scene, which progresses through modern-day [[London]] to the [[Edwardian period]]. [[Electric light]]s transform into [[gas lamp]]s and buildings begin to disappear frame-by-frame. A short [[Cutaway (film)|cutaway sequence]] shows the city regressing further into the past, shrinking to a small [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] settlement before disappearing entirely. Returning to the main sequence, the three men's clothes and hairstyles are adjusted into their [[Bronze Age]] equivalents as they pass through thickening woodland. A close-up on one of the characters reveals that his features are being quickly transfigured into those of a [[caveman]]. The trio are then frozen in a fast-moving [[ice age]] [[glacier]]. 

When the glacier thaws, the three re-emerge as primitive hominids, their clothes ripped away to reveal [[loincloth]]s. They continue to walk backwards with a more [[simian]] gait, and soon "de-evolve" into [[chimpanzee]]s. From there, the trio are transformed into a number of different species in quick succession, including [[flying squirrel]]s, furry mammals, [[aquatic mammal]]s, [[fish]], [[flightless bird]]s, small [[dinosaur]]s, and burrowing [[lizard]]-like creatures. The environment around them changes rapidly as they travel, with cutaways showing millions of years of geological changes occurring in less than a few seconds. Finally, the three become [[mudskipper]]s around a green-brown puddle. The last shot of the sequence is a close-up on the centre individual, as he registers his disgust at the taste of the water with a "Pweugh!" sound. The commercial ends with a transition to a product shot of three pints of Guinness accompanied by the [[strapline]] "Good things come to those who wait".<ref name="CFC">{{cite web |url=http://www.framestore-cfc.com/press/05pr/051003noitulove/ |title=500,000,000 years in 50 seconds flat |accessdate=2008-01-26 |author= |date=[[4 October]] [[2005]] |work=([[press release]]) |publisher=[[Framestore CFC]]}}</ref>

[[Image:NoitulovE postproduction.jpg|right|thumb|Fifteen new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] characters were created during post-production for the commercial.]]
===Background===
{{main|Good things come to those who wait}}
Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO won the account for Guinness in 1996 with a campaign centred around their new strapline "[[Good things come to those who wait]]", and produced several commercials using variations on the theme, including ''[[Swimblack]]'', ''[[Bet on Black]]'', and the critically-acclaimed ''[[Surfer (Guinness)|Surfer]]'', voted the "Best Advert of All Time" by the British public in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_ads/results.html |title=100 Greatest Ads of All Time |accessdate=2008-01-26 |date=[[June 14]] [[2002]] |publisher=[[Channel 4]]/''[[The Sunday Times]]''}}</ref> After the 2001 ''[[Dreamer (Guinness)|Dreamer]]'' advertisements, Diageo, the corporate owners of Guinness, decided to pursue a more pan-European marketing strategy.<ref name="Ch4"/> The strapline proved difficult to translate, and was abandoned. Several new straplines were tried out over the next three years, including "Believe" (''[[Free In (Guinness)|Free In]]'' and ''[[Tom Crean (Guinness)|Tom Crean]]'') and "A story of darkness and light" (''[[Moth (Guinness)|Moth]]'' and ''[[Mustang (Guinness)|Mustang]]'').

The new marketing strategy had not proven particularly successful, and in 2004 Diageo returned to regional advertising.<ref name="Ch4"/> AMV BBDO were presented with the choice of coming up with either a new theme to appeal to the 18&ndash;35 British male demographic, or a new angle on the tried and tested Good things... concept. A number of ideas were put forward, including "The Longest Wait".<ref name="Ch4"/> From this concept, ''noitulovE'' was quickly plotted out: the advert would show three individuals waiting 500,000,000&nbsp;years before finally taking their first sip of Guinness &ndash; the timeline compressed into a 50-second clip. The decision to run the "Evolution sequence" in reverse was taken fairly early, as it was felt that it would better hold viewers' interest during a sixty-second television spot.<ref name="Ch4"/><ref name="CFC"/>

===Pre-production===
The project had not yet been [[greenlight|greenlit]] when the agency approached [[Daniel Kleinman]], known for his work on [[James Bond]] title sequences, with the intention of taking him on as a director. After looking over the concept pitch and a rough draft of the script, Kleinman's immediate impressions were that the idea was "fresh", "an opportunity to try out some new techniques", and that it would "put Guinness back on track, doing a big 'wow' idea".<ref>{{cite video |people= Kleinman, Daniel |date2= |month2= |year2= |title=noitulovE|url=http://www.guinness.com/gb_en/ads/current/evolution/evolution_TVadvert/making_of/ |format= swf|medium= Making Of|publisher= Guinness|accessdate=2008-01-26}} (requires age verification)</ref> 

Kleinman contacted a pair of [[Canada|Canadian]] [[graphic novel]] artists to begin [[storyboard]]ing the commercial. This would allow the agency to determine how much of the <U+00A3>1.3m budget to allocate to each section, and to use as part of the presentation to Diageo pitching the various concepts for a decision on which to pursue. The effort paid off and approval was given to move ahead with production of ''noitulovE''.<ref name="Ch4"/>

===Production===
Production of the commercial took place over two months, with [[principal photography]] shot in [[Iceland]]. Time-lapse photographs were taken of the country's [[mudpot]]s, volcanic terrain and frozen lakes using [[35 mm film|35&nbsp;mm film]] cameras. The shooting took place in the early summer for the [[midnight sun|nearly continuous daylight]] that the season afforded them.<ref name="Ch4"/> The next pieces assembled were the [[live-action]] segments, which were shot in a [[greenscreen]] studio in London. The filming took place in three stages, with the three actors changing into different sets of [[prosthetic makeup]] at each stage. For the final section, the actors spent a week practising the [[choreography]] behind walking backwards with an appropriately simian gait. Wires were attached to the back of each actor, allowing them to lean forwards to give the impression that they were being "sucked back in time" when the final cut was put together.<ref name="FXGuide">{{cite video |people=Seymour, Mike (interviewer); Bartlett, William (subject) |date2= 2005-12-08|title= Making of noitulovE|url= http://www.fxguide.com/modules/NewsUpload/files/guinness/Noitulove.m4v|format= m4v|medium= [[video podcast]]|publisher= FXGuide|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> While filming the actor sequences, VFX supervisor William Bartlett discovered and filmed the aerial view of London from [[Tower 42]]'s Vertigo bar.<ref name="CFC"/>

Feeling that with computer-generated imagery looking to make up so much of the commercial, Kleinman attempted to use film of real elements wherever possible. To this end, two hundred mudskippers were procured from [[South Africa]] for the final scene, arriving via [[Singapore]]. An entire afternoon was set aside for filming the sequence. The footage obtained formed the major part of the final cut of the scene, with the only post-production changes being the addition of [[tail fin]]s and animation of the expression of disgust which closes the piece.<ref name="Ch4"/><ref name="CFC"/> Stop motion footage of other real elements was taken, including a stage-by-stage [[blowtorch]]ing of plants, used to show flora coming back to life in the reverse sequence, and shots of baking bread used to model the geological changes to background rock formations.<ref name="Epica">{{cite web |url=http://www.epica-awards.com/pages/pastresults2005_epicador_film.html |title=Worth the Wait |accessdate=2008-01-26 |author= Blackwell, Lewis|publisher=Epica Awards}}</ref> Additional real elements were to have been incorporated into the commercial, mostly from [[stock footage]] of several animal species, though only short segments of apes and lizards appeared in the final cut.<ref name="FXGuide"/>

===Post-production===
Post-production work was handled mostly by Framestore CFC, who had worked on previous Guinness campaigns ''Surfer''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.framestore-cfc.com/commercials/guinness_surfer/index.html |title=Guinness 'Surfer' |accessdate=2008-01-26 |publisher=Framestore CFC}}</ref> and ''Dreamer'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.framestore-cfc.com/commercials/guinness_dreamer/index.html |title=Making the fur fly for Guinness |accessdate=2008-01-26 |publisher=Framestore CFC}}</ref> and had worked with Daniel Kleinman on a number of outside projects, including several commercials and James Bond title sequences. The project was overseen by William Bartlett, known for his [[VFX]] work on the [[BBC]] [[television documentary]] ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]''. The original schedule allowed for three and a half months in post-production, with airing of the commercial to follow almost immediately afterwards.<ref name="Ch4"/>

The 24-man animation team was split into two groups, half assigned to the creation of the fifteen new CGI creatures which would populate ''noitulovE'' (in [[Maya (software)|Maya]]), while the other half was to create the backgrounds (in [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]]). [[Compositing]] work &ndash; combining the greenscreen shots with stock footage and CGI elements &ndash; was performed in [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment#Flame|Flame]] and [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment#Inferno|Inferno]]. As the final commercial was to be shown on cinema screens, the animators worked at a resolution higher than afforded by the [[576i]] definition<!--referred to in the reference as "PAL encoding", a fairly common error--> used by British [[PAL]]-encoded television sets, to improve the appearance of the advert when projected.<ref name="Ch4"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fxguide.com/article318.html&mode=nested |title=Doing Effects Backwards |accessdate=2008-01-26 |author=Seymour, Mike |date=[[December 8]] [[2005]] |publisher=FXGuide}}</ref>

Near the end of post-production, the [[Creative director|creative team]] decided that the music to which the advert had been set to until that point &ndash; an [[electronic music|electronic]] track by [[Groove Armada]] &ndash; was not working particularly well. Peter Rayburn, who had chosen the track used in ''Surfer'' ([[Leftfield]]'s "Phat Planet"), was brought on as music director. Rayburn suggested three pieces, with "Rhythm of Life" ultimately presented to Guinness as an alternative and approved as a replacement.<ref name="Ch4"/>

==Release and reception==
===Schedule===
''noitulovE'' was originally to have begun its run in September 2005, but the airdate was pushed back several weeks as post-production had taken longer than anticipated.<ref name="Ch4"/> As had been the case with several earlier campaigns, the commercial was to air in several bursts, throughout 2005 and 2006. Spots were purchased in the commercial breaks of sports broadcasts, high-budget [[dramatic programming|television dramas]] and shows whose primary audience overlapped with the campaign's target demographic of British males in the 24&ndash;35 age range. The first burst was commissioned to run from [[October 3]] to [[November 13]] [[2005]], during programming such as the [[UEFA Champions League]], ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Vincent (TV series)|Vincent]]'', ''[[Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway]]'' and [[terrestrial television]] screenings of ''[[Austin Powers: Goldmember]]''.<ref name="casestudy"/>

The second burst lasted through December, with the focus moved to [[Satellite television|multichannel television]]<!--Not a totally accurate pipe, but we lack an article on multichannel television in general, and this isn't the place to give context.-->, with appearances in [[live television|live]] televised [[Association football|football matches]], films, and popular programming such as ''[[I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!]]''. Two further bursts were commissioned for 2006, to run from [[May 15]] to [[June 9]] and [[August 22]] to [[October 8]]. Programmes selected for the May&ndash;June burst included ''[[The X Factor (UK)#The X Factor: Battle of the Stars|Celebrity X Factor]]'', ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and live football and cricket matches. The final series of spots ran during programming totalling 56&nbsp;[[ratings point]]s per week (56% of British television viewers), with much of the schedule assigned to multichannel television.<ref name="casestudy">{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/ConCaseStudy.635 |title= Guinness case study|accessdate=2008-01-26 |date=[[January 15]] [[2007]] |work=Thinkbox.tv}}</ref>

''noitulovE'' was well-received by critics within the advertising and television industries, and was pipped to win the 2006 [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival|Cannes Lions]] Film Grand Prix. ''[[Advertising Age]]'' said of the piece: "A flawless DGI production to an irresistible piece of music propelling a brilliant, astonishingly witty new iteration of a longstanding, unique positioning. This isn't just great advertising; it is perfect advertising."<ref>Garfield, B; [http://adage.com/garfield//article?article_id=109983 Bob Garfield's Pick for Cannes Film Grand Prix: Guinness], ''[[Advertising Age]]'', [[18 June]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[November 22]] [[2007]]</ref> Gast<U+00F3>n Bigio, Executive Creative Director for [[Saatchi & Saatchi|Del Campo Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi]] remarked on the campaign in the run-up to the festival, saying "''noitulovE'' is, in my opinion, the best. [...] This execution is absolutely incredible, as is the production."<ref name="CST"/><ref>Fera, R A; [http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20060701/evolved.html Evolved opinions], ''[[Boards]]'', Brunico Communications Ltd. [[July 1]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[October 20]] [[2007]].</ref> The main competition for the prize was thought to be the Australian ''[[Carlton Draught: Big Ad|Big Ad]]'' for [[Carlton & United Beverages|Carlton]] draught beer, and the British ''[[BRAVIA#Launch, 'Balls'|Balls]]'', for [[Sony]]'s [[BRAVIA]] line of [[high definition television]] sets. After the three received Gold Lions in the Film category, they were shortlisted by the judges as contenders for the Grand Prix. Ultimately, the honour went to ''noitulovE''. After the decision, David Droga, president of the jury which determined the outcome, said of ''noitulovE'': "It's a very very strong ad. A lot of the jurors felt that it was not only a stand-alone, remarkable ad, but also a triumphant return for a fabulous campaign."<ref>Diaz, A C; [http://adage.com/cannes06/article?article_id=110209 Guinness 'Noitulove' Wins Cannes Film Grand Prix], ''Advertising Age'', [[June 24]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[November 21]] [[2007]].</ref> The victory placed director Daniel Kleinman at Number&nbsp;29 in ''[[The Independent]]'s'' list of the Top 50 Newsmakers of 2006.<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article2087460.ece The Top 50 Newsmakers of 2006], ''[[The Independent]]'', [[December 18]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[November 21]] [[2007]].</ref>

Cannes was not the only awards ceremony to recognise ''noitulovE''. When the 2006 edition of the ''[[Gunn Report]]'', an authoritative annual publication determining the advertising industry's most critically successful campaigns, was published, it revealed that ''noitulovE'' had received more awards that year than any other campaign worldwide.<ref name="Gunn"/> Among the awards presented to the team behind the commercial were three [[Clio Awards|Clios]], two [[Shark Awards|Golden Sharks]], and the Special Jury Prize at the [[Imagina Awards]].

The ad was also a hit with the public. It has been credited by Guinness as being responsible for the substantial boost in sales experienced by the brand during the period in which it was broadcast. While revenues within the UK beer market declined by an average of &minus;0.4%&nbsp;(&minus;<U+00A3>19M), the year-on-year figures for Guinness showed an increase of 3.6%&nbsp;(+<U+00A3>13.3M).<ref name="casestudy"/> Between October 2005 and October 2006, Guinness achieved its highest ever volume (6.8%) and value (7.4%) shares,<ref name="casestudy"/> taking the position of [[Market dominance|market leader]] from [[Stella Artois]]. Diageo attributed the growth in no small part to the positive reception garnered by ''noitulovE''.<ref>"Following the launch of ''noitulovE'', Guinness has achieved its highest market share on-trade. We have no doubt that the ad was a key part of what has been driving recent growth for the brand."&mdash;[http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/ConCaseStudy.635 Georgina Meddows-Smith, Head of Guinness Marketing, On-trade, Diageo].</ref>

As one of the most recognisable television advertisements of 2006, ''noitulovE'' was one of two commercials (the other being Sony's ''Balls'') to feature in the <U+00A3>200M campaign launched by [[Digital UK]] to raise awareness of the imminent switchover within the UK from [[analogue television|analogue]] to [[digital television]].<ref>[http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=1645 Debut for <U+00A3>200m switchover awareness ads], DTG News, Lovelace Consulting, [[May 5]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[January 11]] [[2008]].</ref> New versions of the two adverts would show the first few seconds of the original spot before being interrupted by "Digit Al", an animated spokesman for the campaign.

In 2004, Guinness launched a retrospective television advertising campaign promoting [[Guinness Extra Cold]] stout, featuring new ten-second versions of British Guinness commercials broadcast between 1984 and 2004, including ''[[Mars (Guinness)|Mars]]'' (with [[Rutger Hauer]] reprising his role as the "Pure Genius"),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rutgerhauer.org/plots/guinness.php |title=Guinness Penguins/Bullets |accessdate=2008-01-26 |work= Rutgerhauer.org}}</ref> ''[[Anticipation (Guinness)|Anticipation]]'', ''[[Fish Bicycle]]'', ''Surfer'', and ''Bet on Black''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/213150/twist-iconic-guinness-surfers-35m-extra-cold-ads/ |title=Twist on iconic Guinness surfers in <U+00A3>3.5m Extra Cold ads |accessdate=2008-01-26 |author=Whitehead, Jennifer |date= 2004-06-08 |publisher= Brand Republic}}</ref> ''noitulovE'' joined the campaign in 2006, and was the only piece to receive more than one new version. In the first, the patrons are encased only seconds after taking their first sip of Guinness in a glacier identical to the one which appeared half-way through the original spot. In the second, the sea through which the three fish bound backwards in the original spot is frozen while the trio are in mid-leap, leaving the characters skidding across the surface. In the final version, the [[primeval]] pool at the end of the original spot freezes while the mudskippers are taking their drink, and the protagonists' tongues are left stuck in the ice.<ref>{{cite video |year2=2006 |title=noitulovE Extra Cold compilation |url=http://www.guinness.com/gb_en/ads/current/Evolution_Extra_Cold/advert/ |format=swf |publisher= Guinness|accessdate=2008-01-26 }}</ref>

When ''noitulovE'' was first proposed, it was the only pitch revisiting the Good things come to those who wait campaign, as, according to copywriter Ian Heartfield, both AMV BBDO and Diageo "didn't think we could do something good enough to warrant following on from Surfer and the like."<ref name="Ch4"/> However, following the success of ''noitulovE'', three additional commercials have been aired within the Good Things... campaign: ''[[Fridge (Guinness)|Fridge]]'', ''[[Hands (Guinness)|Hands]]'', and ''[[Tipping Point (Guinness)|Tipping Point]]'' (Guinness' most expensive advertising campaign to date).<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Sweeney |title=Guinness ad topples record |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/nov/08/advertising |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2008-01-26 }}</ref>
