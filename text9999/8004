'''[[British Airways]] plc''' ({{lse|BAY}}) is the [[flag carrier]] [[airline]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. It has always been centred on its main [[Airline hub|hub]] at [[London Heathrow Airport]] and is the largest airline in the UK based on fleet size, international flights and international destinations; British Airways was considered the largest airline of the UK, by passenger numbers, from its creation in 1974 until 2008, where rival [[EasyJet]] displaced it.<ref name="British Airways Traffic Statistics">{{cite news|title=Traffic Statistics |url= http://www.bashares.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=69499&p=irol-trafficstats |work=British Airways |accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> Its second major hub is [[London Gatwick Airport]].

The British Airways Group was formed on 1 September 1974 through [[nationalisation]] by the Labour Government of the time. Almost thirteen years later, in February 1987, the company was privatised. The carrier quickly entered a period of rapid and unprecedented growth, leading to the use of the slogan "The World's Favourite Airline", and dominated its domestic rivals during the 1990s.

The formation of [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] in 1984 began a tense relationship with BA, which led to "one of the most bitter and protracted libel actions in aviation history".<ref name="dirtytricks">{{cite news|title=BA dirty tricks against Virgin cost <U+00A3>3m|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/11/newsid_2520000/2520189.stm|work=BBC: On This Day|work=BBC News|date=1993-01-11|accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref> In 2008 the management of BA began to plan a merger with [[Iberia Airlines]]; a preliminary agreement to merge was announced in November 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8356780.stm |title = BA and Iberia agree merger deal |publisher = BBC News |date = 2009-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.financialpost.com/markets/news-releases/story.html?id=2216118 |title = British Airways, Iberia agree to US$7B merger |first = Tracy |last = Rucinski |publisher = Financial Post |date = 2009-11-12}}</ref> The combined airline will become the world's third-largest carrier (after [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[American Airlines]]) in terms of annual revenue.

In 1975, British Airways was headquartered in the Victoria Terminal in London. Its international division was headquartered at the Speedbird House by Heathrow Airport, while its European division was headquartered at Bealine House, Ruislip, Middlesex.

The then [[President of the Board of Trade|Secretary of State for Trade]], [[Peter Shore]], conducted a review of the Government's aviation policy, in 1976 he announced a new "spheres of influence" policy that ended dual designation for British airlines on all long-haul routes. As a result, British Airwars and [[British Caledonian]], the second biggest airliner in Britain, were no longer permitted to run competing scheduled services on the long-haul routes. British Caledonian had to withdraw from the East African routes as well as from the London-New York and London-Los Angeles routes in favour of BA.<ref name="risk316_7">''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', pp. 316/7</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201427.html |title = UK abandons long-haul competition |publisher = Flight International |date = 7 August 1975 |page = 173}}</ref><ref name="review1">{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%200281.html |title = UK aviation policy review: first in a long series |publisher = Flight International |date = 21 February 1976 |page = 397}}</ref><ref name="widebody1">{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1977/1977%20-%200503.html |title = Scottish DC-10s and B.CAL's wide-body plans |publisher = Flight International |date = 26 February 1977 |page = 471}}</ref> In return, British Caledonian became the sole British flag carrier to the entire South American mainland, taking over routes former served by British Airways to [[Colombia]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]].<ref name="widebody1"/><ref name="risk316_7"/><ref name="review1"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1976/1976%20-%201348.html |title = B.CAL expands in South America |publisher = Flight International |date = 24 July 1976 |page = 212}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%202485.html |title = B.CAL on the mid-Atlantic |publisher = Flight International |date = 30 October 1976 |page = 1301}}</ref>
