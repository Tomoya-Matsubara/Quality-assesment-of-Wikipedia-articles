A '''malev''' is an [[Estonia]]n [[military unit]] led by a [[colonel|senior officer]] that is subordinate to an [[infantry]] [[division (military)|division]]. A ''malev'' was originally based on a manpower of [[Counties of Estonia|county]] and was led by a county [[leader|vanem]]. ''Malev'' is bigger than a [[pataljon]] (''battalion'') but smaller than a [[diviis]] (''division''). It is currently the largest military formation among the [[Estonian Defence League]] infantry units.<ref>http://www.mil.ee/kevadtorm/?s=kasulik Estonian Defence Forces formations</ref>

==Leadership==

Usually, a ''malev'' is a sub-component of a [[Division (military)|division]], a larger unit consisting of two or more ''malevs''; however, some brigades are classified as a separate brigade and operate independently from the traditional [[Division (military)|division]] structure. A ''malev'''s [[commanding officer]] is commonly a [[major]] or [[colonel]].<ref>http://www.kaitseliit.ee/index.php?op=body&cat_id=100 Eesti relvaj<U+00F5>udude ametikohtade tunnused</ref>

==Organization==

A modern ''malev'' is typically composed of three to five [[Company (military unit)|companies]] or [[battalion]]s, depending on the area and available manpower of a given [[county]]. Each ''malev'' can operate independently on a battlefield encompassing an area of 10 x 15 [[kilometres]].
