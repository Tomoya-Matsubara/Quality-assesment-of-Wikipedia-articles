The '''Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation''' ('''FSB''') ([[Russian language|Russian]]: <U+0424><U+0421><U+0411>, <U+0424><U+0435><U+0434><U+0435><U+0440><U+0430><U+0301><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0441><U+043B><U+0443><U+0301><U+0436><U+0431><U+0430> <U+0431><U+0435><U+0437><U+043E><U+043F><U+0430><U+0301><U+0441><U+043D><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438>; ''Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti'') is the main domestic [[National security|security]] service of the [[Russian Federation]] and the main successor agency of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era [[Cheka]], [[NKVD]], and [[KGB]].

The FSB is involved in [[counter-intelligence]], [[internal security|internal]] and [[border control|border security]], [[counter-terrorism]], and [[surveillance]]. Its headquarters are on [[Lubyanka Square]], downtown [[Moscow]], the same location as [[Lubyanka (KGB)|the former headquarters of the KGB]].

The service was formerly known as the [[FSK (Russia)|Federal Counterintelligence Service]] (FSK). A bill calling for the reorganization, expansion and renaming of FSK passed both [[Federal Assembly of Russia|houses of the Russian parliament]] and was signed into law on April 3, 1995 by [[Boris Yeltsin]]. It was made subordinate to the [[Ministry of Justice]] by presidential decree on March 9, 2004.<ref>Presidential Edict No. 314, O sisteme i strukture federalnykh organov ispolnitelnoy vlasti, 9 March 2004; in Rossiyskaya gazeta, [http://www.rg.ru/2004/03/11/federel-dok.html], 12 March 2004.</ref>

==Overview==
[[Image:KGB House Main.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka]], headquarters of the FSB]]
The FSB is engaged mostly in domestic affairs, while espionage duties were taken over by the Russian [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]] (former [[First Chief Directorate]] of the [[KGB]]). However, the FSB also includes the [[FAPSI]] agency, which conducts electronic surveillance abroad. In addition, the FSB operates freely within the territories of the former [[Soviet republics]], and it can conduct anti-terrorist military operations anywhere in the World if ordered by the President, according to the recently adopted terrorism law. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies in Russia work under the guidance of FSB if needed.  For example, the [[GRU]], [[spetsnaz]] and [[Internal Troops]] detachments of [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] work together with the FSB in [[Chechnya]].

The FSB is responsible for internal security of the Russian state, [[counterespionage]], and the fight against [[organized crime]], [[terrorism]], and [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggling]]. However, critics claim that it is engaged in suppression of internal dissent, bringing the entire population of Russia under total control, and influencing important political events, just as the [[KGB]] did in the past. To achieve these goals, it is said the FSB implements [[mass surveillance]] and a variety of [[active measures]], including [[disinformation]], [[propaganda]] through the state-controlled [[mass media]], [[Agent provocateur|provocation]]s, and [[persecution]] of opposition politicians, [[investigative journalist]]s, and [[dissident]]s.<ref> [http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/7468137.html The Perils of Putinism], By [[Arnold Beichman]], [[Washington Times]], February 11, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20887-2004Nov29.html Putinism On the March], by [[George F.

The FSB is a very large organization that combines functions and powers similar to those exercised by the [[United States]] [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[United States Federal Protective Service|Federal Protective Service]], the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]], [[United States Coast Guard]], and [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. FSB also commands a contingent of [[Internal Troops]], [[spetsnaz]], and an extensive network of civilian informants.<ref name="Yuri"/> The number of FSB personnel and its budget remain state secrets, although the budget was reported to jump nearly 40% in 2006.<ref name="Finn"/> The number of Chekists in Russia in 1992 was estimated as approximately 500,000.<ref name="Albats"/>

Some observers note that FSB is more powerful than KGB was, because it does not operate under the control of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] as KGB did in the past.<ref name="Resurrection"> [http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=13210 Symposium: KGB Resurrection], interview with [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], and [[R.

The KGB successor, rechristened FSB, still has the right to electronically monitor the population, control political groups, search homes and businesses, infiltrate the federal government, create its own front enterprises, investigate cases, and run its own prison system.

Peter Finn of the [[Washington Post]] argues that the FSB is now the leading political force in Russia, which simply replaced the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].<ref name="Finn"> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/11/AR2006121101434.html ''In Russia, A Secretive Force Widens''] - by P.

==History==
===Initial reorganization of the KGB===

{{Main|KGB}}

During the late 1980s, as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Politics of the Soviet Union|government]] and [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economy]] were disintegrating, the KGB survived better than most state institutions, suffering far fewer cuts in its personnel and budget. Following the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|attempted coup of 1991]] (in which some KGB units participated)<ref>[http://www.ndu.edu/inss/mcnair/mcnair34/34tar.html THE MILITARY AND THE AUGUST 1991 COUP] McNair Paper 34, The Russian Military's Role in Politics, January 1995.</ref> against Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the [[KGB]] was dismantled and formally ceased to exist from November 1991.<ref>But see [http://www.thebulletin.org/article.php?art_ofn=jf93gevorkian N. Gevorkian, ''The KGB: "They still need us"'', 49 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 36 (1993))].</ref>

In late 1991 the domestic security functions of the KGB were reconstituted as the [[FSK (Russia)|Federal Counterintelligence Service]] (FSK), which was placed under the control of the president. The FSK had been known initially for some time as the Ministry of Security. In 1995, the FSK was renamed and reorganized into the FSB by the Federal Law of April 3, 1995, "On the Organs of the Federal Security Service in the Russian Federation", granting it additional powers, enabling it to enter private homes and to conduct intelligence activities in Russia as well as abroad in cooperation with the Russian [[Foreign Intelligence Service]] (SVR).<ref name="fedlaw95">[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/russia/docs/law_950403.htm On Organs of the Federal Security Service in the Russian Federation] Russian Federation Federal Law No. 40-FZ. Adopted by the State Duma 22 February 1995. Signed by Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin and dated 3 April 1995.</ref>

The FSB reforms were rounded out by [[decree]] No. 633, signed by [[Boris Yeltsin]] on June 23, 1995. The [[decree]] made the tasks of the FSB more specific, giving the FSB substantial rights to conduct cryptographic work, and described the powers of the FSB director. The number of deputy directors was increased to 8: 2 first deputies, 5 deputies responsible for departments and directorates and 1 deputy director heading the [[Moscow|Moscow City]] and [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow regional]] directorate. Yeltsin appointed Colonel-General [[Mikhail Barsukov|Mikhail Ivanovich Barsukov]] as the new director of the FSB.

In 1998 Yeltsin appointed as director of the FSB [[Vladimir Putin]], a KGB veteran who would later succeed Yeltsin as federal president.<ref>Mark Tran. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/yeltsin/Story/0,,205434,00.html Who is Vladimir Putin?] Profile: Russia's new prime minister. Guardian Unlimited August 9, 1999.</ref> Yeltsin also ordered the FSB to expand its operations against [[labor union]]s in [[Siberia]] and to crack down on [[right-wing]] [[dissident]]s. As president, Putin increased the FSB's powers to include [[Counter-intelligence|countering foreign intelligence operations]], fighting [[organized crime]], and suppressing [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists.

===Post-2000===
On June 17, 2000, President [[Vladimir Putin]] signed a decree, according to which the FSB was supposed to have a director, a first deputy director and eight other deputy directors, including one stats-secretary and the chiefs of six departments (Economic Security Department, Counterintelligence Department, Organizational and Personnel Service, Department of activity provision, Department for Analysis, Forecasting and Strategic Planning, Department for  Protection of the Constitutional System and the Fight against Terrorism). On June 11, 2001, the President introduced one more deputy director position.

According to a decree signed by Putin on March 11, 2003, by July 1 [[Border Guard Service of Russia]] had been transferred to FSB while [[FAPSI]], agency of government telecommunications, had been abolished, granting FSB with a major part of its functions.

On August 12, 2003 Putin allowed the FSB to have three first deputy directors, including the Chief of the Border Guard Service ([[Vladimir Pronichev]]), and specified that a deputy director position must be assumed by the Chief of the Inspection Directorate.
On July 11, 2004, the President reorganized FSB again.<ref>[http://www.agentura.ru/english/press/about/jointprojects/mn/fsbreform/ FSB Reform: Changes Are Few and Far between<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> It was prescribed to have a director, two first deputy directors ([[Sergei Smirnov]] and [[Vladimir Pronichev]], one of whom should be the Chief of the Border Guard Service (Pronichev).

On December 2, 2005, Putin authorized FSB to have one more deputy director. This position was assumed by [[Vladimir Bulavin]] on March 3, 2006.

In the beginning of 2006 the Italian news agency [[ANSA]] reported the publication on the FSB website of an offer, open to Russian citizens working as spies for a foreign country, to work as [[double agents]].

In September 2006, the FSB was shaken by a major reshuffle, which, combined with some earlier reassignments (most remarkably, those of FSB Deputy Directors [[Yury Zaostrovtsev]] and [[Vladimir Anisimov]] in 2004 and 2005, respectively), were widely believed to be linked to the [[Three Whales Corruption Scandal]] that had slowly unfolded since 2000. Some analysts considered it to be an attempt to undermine FSB Director [[Nikolay Patrushev]]'s influence, as it was Patrushev's team from the [[Karelia]]n KGB Directorate of the late 1980s <U+2013> early 1990s that had suffered most and he had been on vacations during the event.<ref>[http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/46n/n46n-s00.shtml <U+0424><U+0441><U+0431> <U+0417><U+0430><U+043A><U+0440><U+044B><U+0442><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0422><U+0438><U+043F><U+0430><!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref>[http://www.kommersant.com/p704751/r_1/Mass_Dismissals_at_the_FSB/ Mass Dismissals at the FSB - Kommersant Moscow<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref>[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=704751 <U+042A> - <U+041A><U+0438><U+0442> <U+0438> <U+043C><U+0435><U+0447><!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

==Role==
===Counterintelligence===
Then-FSB Director [[Nikolay Kovalev (FSB)|Nikolay Kovalev]] said in 1996: "There has never been such a number of [[spy|spies]] arrested by us since the time when German agents were sent in during the years of [[World War II]]." The FSB reported that around 400 foreign intelligence agents were uncovered in 1995 and 1996.<ref name="Counter"> [http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/russia/fsb-cases.htm Counterintelligence Cases]- by GlobalSecurity.org</ref> In 2006 the FSB reported about 27 foreign intelligence officers and 89 foreign agents whose activities were stopped.<ref name="Day"> [http://grani.ru/Politics/Russia/FSB/m.115994.html Story to the Day of Checkist] - by Vladimir Voronov, for grani.ru, December 2006.</ref>

An increasing number of scientists have been accused of espionage and illegal technology exports by FSB during the last decade: researcher [[Igor Sutyagin]],<ref name="Sytyagin">[http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/russia/4.htm Case study: Igor Sutiagin]</ref> physicist [[Valentin Danilov]],<ref name="Danilov">[http://shr.aaas.org/aaashran/alert.php?a_id=290 AAAS Human Rights Action Network]</ref> physical chemist Oleg Korobeinichev,<ref name="Korob">[http://www.mosnews.com/news/2006/03/23/korobeinichev.shtml Russian Scientist Charged With Disclosing State Secret]</ref> academician Oskar Kaibyshev,<ref name="Kaibyshev"> [http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/08/09/001.html Oskar Kaibyshev convicted]</ref> and physicist Yury Ryzhov.<ref name="Ryzov">[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/07/28/011.html Researchers Throw Up Their Arms]</ref> Some other widely covered cases of political prosecution include investigator [[Mikhail Trepashkin]]<ref name="Trepashkin"> [http://eng.trepashkin.ru/ Trepashkin case]</ref> and journalist Vladimir Rakhmankov.<ref name="Vladimir"> [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/6/DF7B2E15-2F9F-4A8B-AAF0-A7622F0D33F7.html Russia: 'Phallic' Case Threatens Internet Freedom]</ref> All these people are either under arrest or serve long jail sentences.

Ecologist and journalist [[Alexander Nikitin]], who worked with the [[Bellona Foundation]], was accused of espionage. He published material exposing hazards posed by the Russian Navy's nuclear fleet. He was acquitted in 1999 after spending several years in prison (his case was sent for re-investigation 13 times while he remained in prison). Other cases of prosecution are the cases of investigative journalist and ecologist Grigory Pasko,<ref name="Pasko1"> 
[http://www.index.org.ru/mayday/pasko_a.html Grigory Pasko site]</ref><ref name="Pasko">[http://193.71.199.52/en/international/russia/envirorights/pasko/24748.html The Pasko case]</ref> [[Vladimir Petrenko]] who described danger posed by military chemical warfare stockpiles, and [[Nikolay Shchur]], chairman of the [[Snezhinskiy Ecological Fund]].<ref name="Counter">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/russia/fsb-cases.htm Counterintelligence Cases]- by GlobalSecurity.org</ref>

Other arrested people include [[Viktor Orekhov]], a former [[KGB]] officer who assisted Soviet dissidents, [[Vladimir Kazantsev]] who disclosed illegal purchases of eavesdropping devices from foreign firms, and [[Vil Mirzayanov]] who had written that Russia was working on a nerve gas weapon.<ref name="Counter"/>

It has been reported that the FSB uses drugs to erase the memories of people who had access to secret information.<ref name="erase">[http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/37n/n37n-s12.shtml "A nuclear chemist has been returned to a childhood state". - by Aleksei Tarasov - Novaya Gazeta (Russian)]</ref>

===Counter-terrorism===
Over the years, FSB and affiliated state security organizations have killed all elected and appointed presidents of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] including [[Dzhokhar Dudaev]], [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiev]], [[Aslan Maskhadov]], and [[Abdul-Khalim Saidullaev]]. Just before his death, Saidullaev claimed that the Russian government "treacherously" killed Maskhadov, after inviting him to "talks" and promising his security "at the highest level."<ref name="Maskhadov"> [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2006/03/mil-060308-rferl01.htm Russia Used 'Deception' To Kill Maskhadov], March 8, 2006 (RFE/RL)</ref>

During the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] and [[Beslan school hostage crisis]], all hostage takers were killed on the spot by FSB [[spetsnaz]] forces.  Only one of the suspects, [[Nur-Pashi Kulayev]], survived and was convicted later by the court. It is reported that more than 100 leaders of terrorist groups have been killed during 119 operations on North Caucasus during 2006.<ref name="Day"/> 
 
On July 28, 2006 the FSB presented a list of 17 terrorist organizations recognized by the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]], to [[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] newspaper, which published the list that day. The list had been available previously, but only through individual request.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rg.ru/2006/07/28/terror-organizacii.html

===Anti-corruption and organized crime===
The FSB cooperates with [[Interpol]] and other national and international [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}} It has provided information on many Russian criminal groups operating in [[Europe]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}} FSB has also been involved in preparation of requests for [[extradition]] of high-profile suspects who escaped abroad, such as [[Aleksander Litvinenko]], [[Oleg Kalugin]], [[Akhmed Zakayev]], [[Leonid Nevzlin]], and [[Boris Berezovsky]]. However, these requests have been denied by UK, US, Danish, and Israeli courts.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

===Border protection===
The [[Border Guard Service of Russia|Federal Border Guard Service]] (FPS) has been part of the FSB since 2003. Russia has 61,000 kilometers of sea and land borders, 7,500 kilometers of which is with Kazakhstan, and 4,000 kilometers with China. One kilometer of border protection costs around 1 million rubles per year. [[Vladimir Putin]] called on the FPS to increase the fight against international terrorism and "destroy terrorists like rats".<ref name="border">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2006/russia-060208-rferl01.htm Putin Calls On FSB To Modernize Border Guards] by Victor Yasmann for Radio Free Europe, December 2005.</ref>

===Export control===
The FSB is engaged in the development of Russia's export control strategy and examines drafts of international agreements related to the transfer of [[dual-use]] and military commodities and technologies. Its primary role in the [[nonproliferation]] sphere is to collect information to prevent the illegal export of controlled nuclear technology and materials.<ref>"Status of the State Licensing System of Control over Exports of Nuclear Materials, Dual-use Commodities and Technologies in Russia:  Manual for foreign associates in Russia," International Business Relations Corporation, Department of Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Fuel Cycle (Moscow, 2002).</ref>

Besides the services (departments) and directorates of the federal office, the territorial directorates of FSB in the [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subects]] are also subordinate to it.

Of these, St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast Directorate of FSB and its predecessors (historically covering both Leningrad/[[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Leningrad Oblast]]) have played especially important roles in the history of this organization, as many of the officers of the Directorate, including [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Nikolay Patrushev]], later assumed important positions within the federal FSB office or other government bodies. After the last Chief of the Soviet time, [[Anatoly Kurkov]], the St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast Directorate were led by [[Sergei Stepashin]] (November 29, 1991 - 1992), [[Viktor Cherkesov]] (1992 <U+2013>1998), [[Alexander Grigoryev]] (October 1, 1998 <U+2013> January 5, 2001), [[Sergei Smirnov]] (January 5, 2001 <U+2013> June 2003), [[Alexander Bortnikov]] (June 2003 <U+2013> March 2004) and [[Yury Ignashchenkov]] (since March 2004).

==Controversies==
The FSB has the power to enter any home or business without a [[search warrant]] if there is sufficient reason to believe that "a [[crime]] has been, or is being, committed there".<ref>Aleksandr Platkovskiy, "Pod novoy vyveskoy vozrozhdayetsya staroe KGB," Izvestiya, 18 March 1995, pp. 1-2</ref><ref>"Russia, Keeps Getting Back," Economist, 15 April 1995, pp. 51-52.</ref> Article 24 of the law exempts the agency from certain oversight by Russia<U+2019>s Public Prosecutor.<ref name="fedlaw95"/>

[[Human rights]] activists have claimed that the FSB has been slow to shed its KGB heritage, and there have been allegations that it has manufactured cases against suspected dissidents and used threats to recruit agents. At the end of the 1990s, critics charged that the FSB had attempted to frame Russian academics involved in joint research with Western arms-control experts.<ref>Peter Finn.

Despite early promises to reform the Russian intelligence community, the FSB and the services that collect [[foreign intelligence]] and [[signals intelligence]] (the SVR and the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information) remained largely unreformed and subject to little legislative or judicial scrutiny.<ref name="FSBReform">[http://www.agentura.ru/english/press/about/jointprojects/mn/fsbreform/ FSB Reform: Changes Are Few and Far between] [[Agentura.Ru]]</ref> Although some limits were placed on the FSB's domestic surveillance activities{{ndash}} for example, spying on religious institutions and charitable organizations was reduced{{ndash}} all the services continued to be controlled by KGB veterans schooled under the old regime.<ref name="FSBReform"/> Moreover, few former KGB officers were removed following the agency's dissolution, and little effort was made to examine the KGB's operations or its use of informants.<ref>Charles Gurin.

===Alleged FSB-organized coup===
{{main|Russian apartment bombings}}
Starting from 1998, people from state security services came to power as Prime Ministers of Russia: a [[KGB]] veteran [[Yevgeny Primakov]]; former FSB Director [[Sergei Stepashin]]; and finally former FSB Director [[Vladimir Putin]] who was appointed in August 8, 1999.

In August 7, separatist guerrilla leader [[Shamil Basayev]] began an incursion into [[Dagestan]] leading to the start of the [[Dagestan War]] which was regarded by [[Anna Politkovskaya]] as a provocation initiated from Moscow to start war in Chechnya, because Russian forces provided safe passage for Islamic fighters back to Chechnya.<ref name="Anna">[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/16135.ctl Politkovskaya, Anna (2003) ''A Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches from Chechnya'']</ref> It was reported that [[Aleksander Voloshin]] of the Yeltsin administration paid money to [[Shamil Basayev]] to stage this military operation.<ref name="Dunlop1">[http://www.peaceinthecaucasus.org/reports/paper_dunlop.htm The Second Russo-Chechen War Two Years On] - by John B.

On September 4, a series of four [[Russian apartment bombings]] began. Three FSB agents were caught while planting a large bomb in the basement of an apartment complex in the town of [[Ryazan]] in September 22.<ref name="Satter"/> That was last of the bombings. Russian Minister of [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs|Internal Affairs]] Rushailo congratulated police with preventing the terrorist act, but FSB Director [[Nikolai Patrushev]] declared that the incident was a training exercise just an hour later, when he had learned that the FSB agents were caught.<ref name="Litvinenko1"/>

The next day, [[Boris Yeltsin]] received a demand from 24 Russian governors to transfer all state powers to Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]], according to [[Sergei Yushenkov]]<ref name="Alex">[http://www.hro.org/editions/yushenkov/02_06_03.htm Sergei Yushenkov: That was a coup in 1999].</ref>. The [[Second Chechen War]] began on September 24. This war made Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] very popular, although he was previously unknown to the public, and helped him to win a landslide victory in the [[Russian presidential election, 2000|presidential elections]] on March 26, 2000.

This was a successful [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] organized by the FSB to bring [[Vladimir Putin]] to power, according to former FSB officer [[Alexander Litvinenko]], lawmaker [[Sergei Yushenkov]], and journalist [[David Satter]], a [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Hoover Institute]] scholar.<ref name="Litvinenko1"> [[Yuri Felshtinsky]], [[Alexander Litvinenko]], and Geoffrey Andrews.

''Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State.'' [[Yale University Press]]. 2003. ISBN 0-300-09892-8.</ref> All attempts to independently investigate the [[Russian apartment bombings]] were unsuccessful. Journalist [[Artyom Borovik]] died in a suspicious plane crash. Vice-chairman of the [[Sergei Kovalev]] commission created to investigate the bombings, [[Sergei Yushenkov]], was assassinated. Another member of this commission [[Yuri Shchekochikhin]] died presumably from poisoning by thallium. Investigator [[Mikhail Trepashkin]] hired by relatives of victims was arrested and convicted by Russian authorities for allegedly disclosing [[state secret]]s.

===FSB as ruling political elite===
According to former Russian [[State Duma|Duma]] member Konstantin Borovoi, "Putin's appointment is the culmination of the KGB's crusade for power. This is its finale. Now the KGB runs the country."<ref name="Paddock"/> Olga Kryshtanovskaya, director of the Moscow-based Center for the Study of Elites, has found that up to 78% of 1,016 leading political figures in Russia have served previously in organizations affiliated with KGB or FSB.<ref name="Finn"/> She said: "If in the Soviet period and the first post-Soviet period, the KGB and FSB people were mainly involved in security issues, now half are still involved in security but the other half are involved in [[business]], [[political parties]], [[NGO]]s, regional governments, even culture... They started to use all political institutions."<ref name="Finn"/>
"Like cockroaches spreading from a squalid apartment to the rest of the building, they have eventually gained a firm foothold everywhere," said Sergei Grigoryants, a Soviet dissident.<ref name="Paddock"/>

This situation is very similar to that of the former [[Soviet Union]] where all key positions in the government were occupied by members of the Communist Party. The KGB or FSB members usually remain in the "acting reserve" even if they formally leave the organization ("acting reserve" members receive second FSB salary, follow FSB instructions, and remain "above the law" being protected by the organization, according to Kryshtanovskaya).<ref name="Kryshtan">[http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/albac/ Interview with Olga Kryshtanovskaya (Russian)] "[[Silovik]]s in power: fears or reality?"  by Evgenia Albats, [[Echo of Moscow]], 4 February 2006</ref> As [[Vladimir Putin]] said, ''"There is no such thing as a former KGB man"''.<ref name="matthews"> [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11081430/site/newsweek/ ''A Chill in the Moscow Air'' - by Owen Matthews and Anna Nemtsova - Newsweek International, Feb. 6, 2006]</ref> [[GRU]] defector and writer [[Victor Suvorov]] explained that members of Russian security services can leave such organizations only in a coffin, because they know too much.

Paddock - Los Angeles Times, January 12, 2000]</ref>

The idea of the [[KGB]] acting as a leading political force rather than a security organization has been discussed by historian [[Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov]],<ref name="Avtorkhanov">[http://www.chechentimes.org/en/chechentimes/16/?id=974 "Idea which is worth of dying for it"], The Chechen Times <U+2116>17, 30.08.2003</ref> journalist [[John Barron (journalist)|John Barron]], writer and former [[GRU]] officer [[Victor Suvorov]], retired KGB Major General [[Oleg Kalugin]],<ref name="Kalugin"> [http://cicentre.com/Documents/DOC_Kalugin_Nov_00_Speech.htm ''The Triumph of the KGB'' by retired KGB Major General Oleg D. Kalugin]  The Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies</ref> and [[Evgenia Albats]]. According to Avtorkhanov, ''"It is not true that the Political Bureau of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party]] is a superpower... An absolute power thinks, acts and dictates for all of us. The name of the power{{ndash}} [[NKVD]]{{ndash}} [[MVD]]{{ndash}} [[MGB]]. ...[[Chekism]] in ideology, Chekism in practice. Chekism from top to bottom."''<ref name="Avtorkhanov"/>

According to Albats, most KGB leaders, including [[Lavrenty Beria]], [[Yuri Andropov]], and [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], have always struggled for the power with the Communist Party and manipulated the communist leaders. Moreover, FSB has formal membership, military [[discipline]], an extensive network of civilian informants,<ref name="Yuri">[http://www.yabloko.ru/Publ/Raby/rab.html Slaves of KGB. 20th Century.

With regard to death of [[Aleksander Litvinenko]], the highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] stated that there is "a band of over 6,000 former officers of the KGB{{ndash}} one of the most criminal organizations in history{{ndash}} who grabbed the most important positions in the federal and local governments, and who are perpetuating Stalin<U+2019>s, Khrushchev<U+2019>s, and Brezhnev<U+2019>s practice of secretly assassinating people who stand in their way."<ref name="Pacepa0"> [http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ=  The Kremlin<U+2019>s Killing Ways] - by Ion Mihai Pacepa, National Review Online, November 28, 2006</ref>

It is well known that certain very senior clergy of the Moscow Patriarchate are members of the FSB.  They use their ecclesiastical positions to further the interests of the Russian State in foreign countries.

===Criticism of anti-terrorist operations===
Use of excessive force by the FSB [[spetsnaz]] was criticized with regard to resolving [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] and [[Beslan hostage crisis]]. According to [[Sergey Kovalev]], the Russian government kills its citizens without any hesitation. He provided the following examples: murdering of hostages by the poison gas during [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]]; burning school children alive by [[spetsnaz]] soldiers who used [[RPO flamethrower]]s during [[Beslan school hostage crisis]]; crimes committed by [[death squads]] in [[Chechnya]];<ref name="hrw1">[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/10/13/russia14384.htm Russia Condemned for Chechnya Killings]</ref> and assassination of [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev]].<ref name="Kovalev">[http://www.svobodanews.ru/Article/2006/12/10/20061210124323093.html Sergey Kovalev - Interview to Radio Free Europe]</ref> [[Anna Politkovskaya]] and [[Irina Hakamada]], who conducted unofficial negotiations with terrorists, stated that the hostage takers were not going to use their bombs to kill the people and destroy the building during [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]].<ref>[http://2004.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2004/02n/n02n-s13.shtml <U+00CF><U+00F0><U+00E5><U+00E7><U+00E8><U+00E4><U+00E5><U+00ED><U+00F2><U+00F1><U+00EA><U+00E8><U+00E5> <U+00C2><U+00FB><U+00E1><U+00EE><U+00F0><U+00FB>{{ndash}} <U+00CD><U+00E0><U+00F8> <U+00CF><U+00EE><U+00F1><U+00EB><U+00E5><U+00E4><U+00ED><U+00E8><U+00E9> <U+00D8><U+00E0><U+00ED><U+00F1> <U+00D3><U+00E7><U+00ED><U+00E0><U+00F2><U+00FC> <U+00CF><U+00F0><U+00E0><U+00E2><U+00E4><U+00F3><!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

According to [[Anna Politkovskaya]], most of the "Islamic terrorism cases" were fabricated by the government, and the confessions have been obtained through the torture of innocent suspects. "The plight of those sentenced for Islamic terrorism today is the same as that of the political prisoners of the [[Gulag|Gulag Archipelago]]... Russia continues to be infected by [[Stalinism]]", she said.<ref name="Stalin">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/31/AR2006033101584.html Stalinism Forever - by Anna Politkovskaya - The Washington Post]</ref>
