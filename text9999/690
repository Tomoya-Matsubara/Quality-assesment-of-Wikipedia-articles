'''The Royal College of Surgeons of England''' is an independent [[professional body]] and registered charity (212808) committed to promoting and advancing the highest standards of [[surgery|surgical]] care for patients, regulating surgery, including [[dentistry]], in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. The College is located at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in [[London]]. 

==History==
The origins of the College go back to the fourteenth century with the foundation of the 'Guild of Surgeons Within the City of London'<ref>Louis Kuo Tai Fu (2000)The origins of surgery. 2: From barbers to surgeons Annals of the College of Surgeons Hong Kong 4 (1), 35<U+2013>49.
doi:10.1046/j.1442-2034.2000.00029.x</ref>.  There was dispute between the surgeons and barber surgeons until an agreement was signed between them in 1493, giving the fellowship of surgeons the power of incorporation<ref>http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2003.pdf, page 118</ref>  This union was formalised further in 1540 by [[Henry VIII of England]] between the [[Worshipful Company of Barbers]] (incorporated 1462) and the Guild of Surgeons to form the Company of Barber-Surgeons. In 1745 the surgeons broke away from the [[barber]]s to form the Company of Surgeons. In 1800 the Company was granted a [[Royal Charter]] to become the Royal College of Surgeons in London. A further  charter in 1843 granted it the present title of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.

==Fellows==
The original 300 Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of England ([[FRCS]]) include:
* [[John Abernethy (surgeon)|John Abernethy]] (1764<U+2013>1831)
* [[John Badley (surgeon)|John Badley]] (1783<U+2013>1870)
* [[Robert Keate]] (1777<U+2013>1857)
* [[Richard Partridge]] (1805<U+2013>1873)

The correct way to address a member or fellow of The Royal College of Surgeons is to use the title [[Mr]], Miss, Mrs, or Ms (not Dr). This system (which applies only to surgeons, not physicians) has its origins in the 16th century, when surgeons were [[barber-surgeons]] and did not have a medical degree (or indeed any formal qualification), unlike physicians, who held a University medical degree. 

In [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[The Hound of the Baskervilles]], the distinction is made in the following conversation:
<blockquote>
''"Come, come, we are not so far wrong after all," said Holmes.  "And now, Dr. James Mortimer--"''
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
   ''"Mister, sir, Mister--a humble M.R.C.S."''
</blockquote>

Despite Mortimer's correction, he is referred to as "Dr. Mortimer" throughout the story.

A biographical register of fellows is available on [http://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online]

==Buildings==
The Company of Surgeons moved from Surgeon's Hall in [[Old Bailey]] to a site at 41 [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in 1797. Construction of the first College building, to a design by [[George Dance the Younger]] and James Lewis, took from 1805 to 1813. Before long, a survey by Sir [[John Soane]] uncovered structural defects. In 1833 Sir [[Charles Barry]] won the public competition to design a replacement. The library and portico of this building are all that remain today after a German incendiary bomb hit the College in 1941.

==Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons of England==
[[Image:Hunterian Collection.jpg|thumb|right|The skeleton of the seven and a half foot (231cm) tall "Irish Giant" is visible in the middle of this image.]]In 1799 the government purchased the collection of [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] which they presented to the College. This formed the basis of the Hunterian Collection, which has since been supplemented by others including an [[Dentistry|Odontological]] Collection and the [[natural history]] collections of [[Richard Owen]].  The museum displays thousands of anatomical specimens, including the [[Evelyn tables]] and the skeleton of the "Irish giant" [[Charles Byrne (human curiosity)|Charles Byrne]], and many surgical instruments
