The '''Appaloosa''' is a [[horse breed]] best known for its colorful [[leopard complex|leopard-spotted coat]] pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study [[equine coat color genetics]], as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the [[leopard complex]] mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop [[Equine Recurrent Uveitis|equine recurrent uveitis]] and [[Nyctalopia|congenital stationary night blindness]]; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.

Artwork depicting prehistoric horses with leopard spotting exists in prehistoric [[cave paintings]] in Europe. Images of [[domestication of the horse|domesticated horses]] with leopard spotting patterns appeared in artwork from [[Ancient Greece]] through the [[early modern period]]; the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] people of what today is the United States [[Pacific Northwest]] developed the original American breed. Appaloosas were once referred to by [[American pioneer|settlers]] as the "Palouse horse", possibly after the [[Palouse River]], which ran through the heart of Nez Perce country. Gradually, the name evolved into "Appaloosa".

The Nez Perce lost most of their horses after the [[Nez Perce War]] in 1877, and the breed fell into decline for several decades. A small number of dedicated breeders preserved the Appaloosa as a distinct breed until the [[Appaloosa Horse Club]] (ApHC) was formed as the [[breed registry]] in 1938. The modern breed maintains bloodlines tracing to the [[foundation bloodstock]] of the registry; its partially [[open stud book]] allows the addition of some [[Thoroughbred]], [[American Quarter Horse]] and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] blood.

Today, the Appaloosa is one of the most popular breeds in the United States; it was named the official [[state horse]] of [[Idaho]] in 1975. It is best known as a [[stock horse]] used in a number of [[western riding]] disciplines, but is also a versatile breed with representatives seen in many other types of [[equestrianism|equestrian]] activity. Appaloosas have been used in many movies; an Appaloosa is the mascot for the [[Florida State Seminoles]]. Appaloosa bloodlines have influenced other horse breeds, including the [[Pony of the Americas]], the [[Nez Perce Horse]], and several [[gaited horse]] breeds.

== Breed characteristics ==

[[File:Sclera and mottling.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mottling on the skin is particularly visible around the eyes and muzzle. The sclera of an Appaloosa's eye is white.|alt=The head of a light-colored horse with dark spots, showing spotting around the skin of the eye and muzzle.]]

The Appaloosa is best known for its distinctive, preferred [[leopard complex]] spotted coat. Spotting occurs in several overlay patterns on one of several recognized base [[Horse coat color|coat colors]]. There are three other distinctive, "core" characteristics: [[mottle]]d skin, striped hooves, and eyes with a white [[sclera]].<ref name="ApHCrules">{{cite web | url = http://www.appaloosa.com/registration/handbook.htm| title= 2012 Appaloosa Horse Club Handbook |publisher=Appaloosa Horse Club|accessdate=April 2, 2011|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110422185434/http://appaloosa.com/registration/handbook.htm| archivedate= 22 April 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Skin mottling is usually seen around the muzzle, eyes, anus, and genitalia.<ref name=Rule128/> Striped hooves are a common trait, quite noticeable on Appaloosas, but not unique to the breed.<ref name="Identify" />  The sclera is the part of the eye surrounding the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]; although all horses show white around the eye if the eye is rolled back, to have a readily visible white sclera with the eye in a normal position is a distinctive characteristic seen more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds.<ref name="Identify" /> Because the occasional individual is born with little or no visible spotting pattern, the ApHC allows "regular" registration of horses with mottled skin plus at least one of the other core characteristics. Horses with two ApHC parents but no "identifiable Appaloosa characteristics" are registered as "non-characteristic," a limited special registration status.<ref name="ApHCrules" />

There is a wide range of body types in the Appaloosa, in part because the leopard complex characteristics are its primary identifying factors, and also because several different [[list of horse breeds|horse breeds]] influenced its development. The weight range varies from {{convert|950|to|1250|lbs|kg}}, and heights from {{hands|14|to|16}}.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amappaloosa.com/mainpage.cfm?contentid=147 |title=Characteristics of the Appaloosa|publisher=American Appaloosa Association Worldwide |accessdate=November 13, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101025085808/http://amappaloosa.com/mainpage.cfm?contentid=147| archivedate= 25 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  However, the ApHC does not allow [[pony]] or [[draft horse|draft]] breeding.<ref name="ApHCrules" />

The original "old time" or "old type" Appaloosa was a tall, narrow-bodied, rangy horse.{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=392}} The body style reflected a mix that started with the traditional [[Iberian horse|Spanish horses]] already common on the plains of America before 1700. Then, 18th-century European bloodlines were added, particularly those of the "pied" horses popular in that period and shipped ''en masse'' to the Americas once the color had become unfashionable in Europe.{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=391}} These horses were similar to a tall, slim [[Thoroughbred]]-[[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] type of horse popular in [[Enlightenment in Spain|Bourbon-era Spain]].{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=391}}{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=170}} The original Appaloosa tended to have a convex facial profile that resembled that of the [[warmblood]]-[[Jennet]] crosses first developed in the 16th century during the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=392}}{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=308}} The old-type Appaloosa was later modified by the addition of draft horse blood after the 1877 defeat of the Nez Perce, when U.S. Government policy forced the Indians to become farmers and provided them with draft horse mares to breed to existing stallions.{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=392}} The original Appaloosas frequently had a sparse [[mane (horse)|mane]] and [[tail (horse)|tail]], but that was not a primary characteristic as many early Appaloosas did have full manes and tails.{{sfn|Richardson, ''Appaloosa''|pp=27<U+2013>28}} There is a possible genetic link between the leopard complex and sparse mane and tail growth, although the precise relationship is unknown.{{sfn|Sponenberg, ''Equine Color Genetics''|pp=90<U+2013>91}}

After the formation of the Appaloosa Horse Club in 1938, a more modern type developed after the addition of [[American Quarter Horse]] and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] bloodlines. The addition of Quarter Horse lines produced Appaloosas that performed better in [[horse racing|sprint racing]] and in [[halter (horse show)|halter]] competition. Many cutting and reining horses resulted from old-type Appaloosas crossed on Arabian bloodlines, particularly via the Appaloosa [[foundation bloodstock|foundation stallion]] Red Eagle.{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=393}} An infusion of Thoroughbred blood was added during the 1970s to produce horses more suited for racing.{{sfn|Harris, ''Horse Breeds of the West''|p=12}} Many current breeders also attempt to breed away from the sparse, "rat tail" trait, and therefore modern Appaloosas have fuller manes and tails.{{sfn|Richardson, ''Appaloosa''|pp=27<U+2013>28}}

== Color and spotting patterns ==

{{see also|Equine coat color}}
[[File:AppaloosaCharlie.jpg|thumb|Few spot leopard Appaloosa with wet coat showing "halo" effect of dark skin under white coat around spots.]]

The coat color of an Appaloosa is a combination of a base color with an overlaid spotting pattern. The base colors recognized by the Appaloosa Horse Club include [[bay (horse)|bay]], [[black (horse)|black]], [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], [[palomino]], [[Buckskin (horse)|buckskin]], [[cream gene|cremello or perlino]], [[roan (horse)|roan]], [[gray (horse)|gray]], [[Dun gene|dun]] and [[grullo|grulla]].<!--source uses "grulla" not "grullo"; same color --> Appaloosa markings have several pattern variations.<ref name="Identify" /> It is this unique group of spotting patterns, collectively called the "leopard complex",<ref name=APstudies/> that most people associate with the Appaloosa horse.<ref name="Identify">{{cite web|url= http://www.appaloosa.com/registration/indentify.htm |title= Guide to Identifying an Appaloosa |accessdate=December 10, 2010 |publisher=Appaloosa Horse Club| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101211220821/http://appaloosa.com/registration/indentify.htm| archivedate= 11 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Spots overlay darker skin, and are often surrounded by a "halo", where the skin next to the spot is also dark but the overlying hair coat is white.{{sfn|Sponenberg, ''Equine Color Genetics''|p=92}}

It is not always easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://imh.org/index.php/exhibits/online/horse-breeds-of-the-world/north-america/item/2233-appaloosa-horse |title= Appaloosa Horse |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |work= International Museum of the Horse&nbsp;<U+2013> Horse Breeds of the World|publisher=Kentucky Horse Park}}</ref> In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics.<ref name=APstudies/> Patterns sometimes change over the course of the horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.{{sfn|Sponenberg, ''Equine Color Genetics''|p=92}}

The ApHC also recognizes the concept of a "solid" horse, which has a base color "but no contrasting color in the form of an Appaloosa coat pattern". Solid horses can be registered if they have mottled skin and one other leopard complex characteristic.<ref name="Identify" />

Base colors are overlain by various spotting patterns, which are variable and often do not fit neatly into a specific category.<ref name="Identify" />  These patterns are described as follows:

Early Nez Perce horses were considered to be of high quality.

Peace with the United States dated back to an alliance arranged by Lewis and Clark,{{sfn|West, "Nez Perce and Their Trials"|pp=5<U+2013>6}} but the encroachment of gold miners in the 1860s and settlers in the 1870s put pressure on the Nez Perce.{{sfn|Malone Roeder & Lang, ''Montana''|pp=135<U+2013>136}} Although a treaty of 1855 originally allowed them to keep most of their traditional land, another in 1863 reduced the land alloted to them by 90&nbsp;percent.{{sfn|West, "Nez Perce and Their Trials"|p=9}} The Nez Perce who refused to give up their land under the 1863 treaty included a band living in the Wallowa Valley of Oregon, led by Heinmot Tooyalakekt, widely known as [[Chief Joseph]].{{sfn|West, "Nez Perce and Their Trials"|p=4}} Tensions rose, and in May 1877, General [[Oliver Howard]] called a council and ordered the non-treaty bands to move to the reservation.{{sfn|Malone Roeder & Lang, ''Montana''|pp=135<U+2013>136}}{{sfn|West, "Nez Perce and Their Trials"|pp=14<U+2013>15}} Chief Joseph considered military resistance futile,<ref name=PBS>{{cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/a_c/chiefjoseph.htm |title=Chief Joseph| work= New Perspectives on the West|publisher = The West Film Project/WETA/PBS/ | year = 2001 | accessdate =December 12, 2010 }}</ref> and by June 14, 1877, had gathered about 600 people at a site near present-day [[Grangeville, Idaho]].{{sfn|West, "Nez Perce and Their Trials"|pp=5<U+2013>6}} But on that day a small group of warriors<!--from White Bird's band--> staged an attack on nearby white settlers,{{sfn|Malone Roeder & Lang, ''Montana''|pp=135<U+2013>136}} which led to the Nez Perce War.{{sfn|West, "Nez Perce and Their Trials"|pp=5<U+2013>6}} After several small battles in Idaho,{{sfn|West, "Nez Perce and Their Trials"|pp=5<U+2013>6}} more than 800&nbsp;Nez Perce, mostly non-warriors, took 2000 head of various livestock including horses and fled into [[Montana]], then traveled southeast, dipping into [[Yellowstone National Park]].{{sfn|Malone Roeder & Lang, ''Montana''|pp=135<U+2013>136}}{{sfn|West, "Nez Perce and Their Trials"|p=4}}  A small number of Nez Perce fighters, probably fewer than 200,<ref name=PBS/> successfully held off larger forces of the U.S. Army in several skirmishes, including the two-day [[Battle of the Big Hole]] in southwestern Montana.{{sfn|Malone Roeder & Lang, ''Montana''|pp=135<U+2013>136}} They then moved northeast and attempted to seek refuge with the [[Crow Nation]]; rebuffed, they headed for safety in Canada.{{sfn|Malone Roeder & Lang, ''Montana''|pp=135<U+2013>136}}

Throughout this journey of about {{convert|1400|mi|km}}<ref name=PBS/> the Nez Perce relied heavily on their fast, agile and hardy Appaloosa horses.{{sfn|Haines, ''Appaloosa''|pp=92<U+2013>95}} The journey came to an end when they stopped to rest near the [[Bears Paw Mountains]] in Montana, {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the Canadian border. Unbeknownst to the Nez Perce, Colonel [[Nelson A. Miles]] had led an infantry-cavalry column from [[Fort Keogh]] in pursuit. On October 5, 1877, after a five-day fight, Joseph surrendered.

=== Aftermath of the Nez Perce War ===

When the U.S. 7th Cavalry accepted the surrender of Chief Joseph and the remaining Nez Perce, they immediately took more than 1,000 of the tribe's horses, sold what they could and shot many of the rest. But a significant population of horses had been left behind in the Wallowa valley when the Nez Perce began their retreat, and additional animals escaped or were abandoned along the way.<ref name="Museum" /> The Nez Perce were ultimately settled on [[Nez Perce tribe#Nez Perce Indian Reservation|reservation lands]] in north central Idaho,{{efn|Chief Joseph and his band were settled in central Washington on the [[Colville Indian Reservation]].{{sfn|West, "Nez Perce and Their Trials"|p=4}}}} were allowed few horses, and were required by the Army to [[crossbreed]] to [[draft horse]]s in an attempt to create farm horses.{{sfn|Richardson, ''Appaloosa''|p=24<U+2013>25}} The Nez Perce tribe never regained its former position as breeders of Appaloosas. In the late 20th century, they began a program to develop a new horse breed, the [[Nez Perce horse]], with the intent to resurrect their horse culture, tradition of selective breeding, and horsemanship.<ref name=Murphy/>

Although a remnant population of Appaloosa horses remained after 1877, they were virtually forgotten as a distinct breed for almost 60&nbsp;years.<ref name="Museum" />  A few quality horses continued to be bred, mostly those captured or purchased by settlers and used as working [[ranch]] horses. Others were used in circuses and related forms of entertainment, such as [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West|Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]].{{sfn|Haines, ''Appaloosa''|pp=96<U+2013>98}} The horses were originally called  "Palouse horses" by settlers, a reference to the [[Palouse River]] that ran through the heart of what was once Nez Perce country.{{sfn|Crowell, ''Cavalcade''|pp=296<U+2013>297}} Gradually, the name evolved into "Apalouse", and then "Appaloosa".<ref name=Spencer>{{cite journal|last= Spencer III|first=Dick |year=1958 |month=December |title=Appaloosas |journal= Western Livestock Journal|pages=50, 53<U+2013>55}}</ref>{{sfn|Crowell, ''Cavalcade''|pp=296<U+2013>297}} Other early variations of the name included "Appalucy", "Apalousey" and "Appaloosie". In one 1948 book, the breed was called the "Opelousa horse", described as a "hardy tough breed of Indian and Spanish horse" used by backwoodsmen of the late 18th century to transport goods to New Orleans for sale. By the 1950s, "Appaloosa" was regarded as the correct spelling.<ref name=Meredith/><ref>{{cite journal|title='Opelousas,' Another Spelling of 'Appalucy'|author=Meredith, Mamie J.|journal=American Speech (Duke University Press)|volume=27|issue=2|page=150|date=May 1952}}</ref>

The Appaloosa came to the attention of the general public in January 1937 in ''[[Western Horseman]]'' magazine when Francis D. Haines, a history professor from [[Lewiston, Idaho]], published an article describing the breed's history and urging its preservation.{{sfn|Ciarloni, "Shaping Stock Horses"|p=82}} Haines had performed extensive research, traveling with a friend and Appaloosa aficionado named George Hatley, visiting numerous Nez Perce villages, collecting history, and taking photographs.{{sfn|Ciarloni, "Shaping Stock Horses"|p=83}} The article generated strong interest in the horse breed, and led to the founding of the [[Appaloosa Horse Club]] (ApHC) by Claude Thompson and a small group of other dedicated breeders in 1938.<ref name="ApHC History">{{cite web|url= http://www.appaloosamuseum.org/cms/default.asp?contentID=524 |title= History of the ApHC |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |publisher=The Appaloosa Museum| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080206014113/http://www.appaloosamuseum.org/cms/default.asp?contentID=524| archivedate= 6 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>{{sfn|Haines, ''Appaloosa''|p=98}} The registry was originally housed in [[Moro, Oregon]];{{sfn|Haines, ''Appaloosa''|p=98}} but in 1947 the organization moved to [[Moscow, Idaho]], under the leadership of George Hatley.{{sfn|Ciarloni, "Shaping Stock Horses"|p=83}}<ref name="ApHC History" />  The Appaloosa Museum foundation was formed in 1975 to preserve the history of the Appaloosa horse.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.appaloosamuseum.org |title= Appaloosa Museum |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |publisher=The Appaloosa Museum | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080115090850/http://www.appaloosamuseum.org/| archivedate= 15 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The ''Western Horseman'' magazine, and particularly its longtime publisher, Dick Spencer, continued to support and promote the breed through many subsequent articles.{{sfn|Ciarloni, "Shaping Stock Horses"|pp=83<U+2013>84}}

A significant [[crossbreed]]ing influence used to revitalize the Appaloosa was the [[Arabian horse]], as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC.{{sfn|Appaloosa Horse Club, ''Appaloosa Horse Club Stud Book, Vol. 1''}} For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by [[Will Keith Kellogg|W.K.

The Appaloosa is "a breed defined by ApHC bloodline requirements and preferred characteristics, including coat pattern".<ref name="ApHCrules" /> In other words, the Appaloosa is a distinct breed from limited bloodlines with distinct physical traits and a desired color, referred to as a "color preference". Appaloosas are not strictly a "[[color breed]]". All ApHC-registered Appaloosas must be the offspring of two registered Appaloosa parents or a registered Appaloosa and a horse from an approved breed registry, which includes Arabian horses, Quarter Horses, and Thoroughbreds. In all cases, one parent must always be a regular registered Appaloosa. The only exception to the bloodline requirements is in the case of Appaloosa-colored geldings or spayed mares with unknown pedigrees; owners may apply for "hardship registration" for these non-breeding horses. The ApHC does not accept horses with draft, pony, Pinto, or Paint breeding, and requires mature Appaloosas to stand, unshod, at least {{hands|14}}.<ref name=Rule205/>  If a horse has excessive white markings not associated with the Appaloosa pattern (such as those characteristic of a pinto) it cannot be registered unless it is verified through DNA testing that both parents have ApHC registration.<ref name="ApHCrules" />

Certain other characteristics are used to determine if a horse receives "regular" registration: striped hooves, white sclera visible when the eye is in a normal position, and mottled (spotted) skin around the eyes, lips, and genitalia. As the Appaloosa is one of the few horse breeds to exhibit skin mottling, this characteristic "...is a very basic and decisive indication of an Appaloosa."<ref name=Rule128>{{cite web|url= http://www.appaloosa.com/registration/handbook.htm| title= 2012 Appaloosa Horse Club Handbook |accessdate=April 2, 2012 |publisher=Appaloosa Horse Club|format=PDF |pages= Rule 128}}</ref> Appaloosas born with visible coat pattern, or mottled skin and at least one other characteristic, are registered with "regular" papers and have full show and breeding privileges. A horse that meets bloodline requirements but is born without the recognized color pattern and characteristics can still be registered with the ApHC as a "non-characteristic" Appaloosa. These solid-colored, "non-characteristic" Appaloosas may not be shown at ApHC events unless the owner verifies the parentage through DNA testing and pays a supplementary fee to enter the horse into the ApHC's Performance Permit Program (PPP).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.appaloosa.com/registration/performance-permit.htm |title= Performance Permit Program|publisher=Appaloosa Horse Club |accessdate=October 24, 2009}}</ref> Solid-colored Appaloosas are restricted in breeding.<ref name="ApHCrules" />

=== Color rule controversy ===

[[File:Appaloosasnowcapmareandfoal.jpg|thumb|Mare and foal. The ApHC encourages early foal registration, even though coat patterns may change later.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.appaloosa.com/pdfs/FeeSchedule.pdf |title=2011 ApHC Fee Schedule |publisher=Appaloosa Horse Club|page=1|accessdate = January 3, 2010|format=PDF}}</ref>|alt=a brown mare with a white rump running alongside her baby foal, who is black with a white rump]]

During the 1940s and 1950s, when both the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC) and the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (AQHA) were in their formative years, minimally marked or roan Appaloosas were sometimes used in Quarter Horse breeding programs.{{sfn|Holmes, ''Spotted Pride''|p=165}}  At the same time, it was noted that two solid-colored registered Quarter Horse parents would sometimes produce what Quarter Horse aficionados call a "[[cropout]]", a foal with white coloration similar to that of an Appaloosa or [[pinto horse|Pinto]]. For a considerable time, until DNA testing could verify parentage, the AQHA refused to register such horses. The ApHC did accept cropout horses that exhibited proper Appaloosa traits, while cropout pintos became the core of the [[American Paint Horse Association]]. Famous Appaloosas who were cropouts included Colida, Joker B, Bright Eyes Brother and Wapiti.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.appaloosamuseum.org/cms/famoushorses.asp |title=Famous horses|publisher=The Appaloosa Museum|year=2007|accessdate=December 31, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090101114054/http://www.appaloosamuseum.org/cms/famoushorses.asp| archivedate= 1 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In the late 1970s, the color controversy went in the opposite direction within the Appaloosa registry. The ApHC's decision in 1982 to allow solid-colored or "non-characteristic" Appaloosas to be registered resulted in substantial debate within the Appaloosa breeding community.{{sfn|Stanger, ''Fifty Years of Appaloosa History''|p=163}} Until then, a foal of Appaloosa parents that had insufficient color was often denied registration, although non-characteristic Appaloosas were allowed into the registry. But breeder experience had shown that some solid Appaloosas could throw a spotted foal in a subsequent generation, at least when bred to a spotted Appaloosa. In addition, many horses with a solid coat exhibited secondary characteristics such as skin mottling, the white sclera, and striped hooves.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.appaloosa.com/registration/tips-for-registration.htm |title= Tips for Registering Your Appaloosa |publisher=Appaloosa Horse Club|accessdate=January 31, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080213121435/http://www.appaloosa.com/registration/tips-for-registration.htm| archivedate= 13 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The controversy stirred by the ApHC's decision was intense. In 1983 a number of Appaloosa breeders opposed to the registration of solid-colored horses formed the American Appaloosa Association, a breakaway organization.<ref name="amapp" />

Appaloosas are used extensively for both [[Western riding|Western]] and [[English riding]]. Western competitions include [[cutting (sport)|cutting]], [[reining]], [[Team Roping|roping]] and [[Gymkhana (equestrian)|O-Mok-See]] sports such as [[Barrel Racing|barrel racing]] (known as the [[Camas Prairie Stump Race]] in Appaloosa-only competition) and [[pole bending]] (called the [[Nez Perc<U+00E9> Stake Race]] at breed shows). English disciplines they are used in include [[eventing]], [[show jumping]], and [[fox hunting]]. They are common in [[endurance riding]] competitions, as well as in casual [[trail riding]]. Appaloosas are also bred for [[horse racing]], with an active breed racing association promoting the sport. They are generally used for middle-distance racing at distances between {{convert|350|yards}} and {{convert|0.5|mi}}; an Appaloosa holds the all-breed record for the {{convert|4.5|furlong}} distance, set in 1989.{{sfn|Dutson, ''Storey's Illustrated Guide to 96 Horse Breeds of North America''|pp=74<U+2013>78}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.appaloosa.com/race/milestones.htm|title=Milestones in Appaloosa racing|accessdate=September 25, 2012|publisher=The Appaloosa Horse Club}}</ref>

Appaloosas have an eightfold greater risk of developing [[Equine Recurrent Uveitis]] (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25&nbsp;percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. [[Uveitis]] in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.appaloosaproject.info/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=40&MMN_position=68:68|title=Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU)|author=Sandmeyer, Lynne|accessdate=March 21, 2010|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=The Appaloosa Project}}</ref> Eighty&nbsp;percent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=11687|journal=The Horse|title=Uveitis: Medical and Surgical Treatment|accessdate=March 21, 2010|date=April 19, 2008|author=Loving, Nancy|format=Registration required}}</ref> Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an [[allele]] that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Abstracts: 36th Annual Meeting of the American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists, Nashville, TN, USA, October 12<U+2013>15, 2005|journal=Veterinary Ophthalmology|volume=8|issue=6|pages=437<U+2013>450|date=November 2005|doi=10.1111/j.1463-5224.2005.00442.x | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118669468/abstract|quote=Based on these data, we conclude that a susceptibility allele for ERU in Appaloosas exists in the MHC region.}}</ref>

=== Drug rules ===

In 2007 the ApHC implemented new drug rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs [[furosemide]], known by the trade name of Lasix, and [[acetazolamide]]. Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures.{{efn|Acetazolamide is not to be confused with [[acepromazine]] ("Ace"), a [[Sedative|tranquilizer]], which is illegal in all forms of competition.}} Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers.<ref>{{cite web| title =2012 Appaloosa Horse Club Handbook|page=Rule 40C, note | publisher = Appaloosa Horse Club | year = 2012 | url = http://www.appaloosa.com/registration/handbook.htm |format=PDF| accessdate = April 2, 2012}}</ref> The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain [[American Quarter Horse]] bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners have the option to choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers.<ref>{{cite web| last =Nelson | first =Shonda | title = Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (HYPP) Testing Procedures| publisher = Appaloosa Horse Club | year = 2008 | url = http://www.appaloosa.com/pdfs/HYPPTestingProcedures.pdf|format=PDF| pages=1<U+2013>2| accessdate = March 26, 2011}}</ref> Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP will be required to be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.<ref name="ApHCrules" />

Both drugs are controversial, in part because they are considered drug maskers and [[diuretic]]s that can make it difficult to detect the presence of other drugs in the horse's system.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.appaloosa.com/pdfs/SummaryofMotions07_08_07.pdf |title= July 2007 Appaloosa Horse Club Board Motions |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |format=PDF|publisher=Appaloosa Horse Club|pages=21<U+2013>24}}</ref> On one side, it is argued that the [[United States Equestrian Federation]] (USEF), which sponsors show competition for many different [[list of horse breeds|horse breeds]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.usef.org/documents/competitions/2007/2007DrugsMedsGuidelines.pdf|title= Drugs and Medication Guidelines |accessdate=August 11, 2008|date=August 1, 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=United States Equestrian Federation|page=1| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080911032453/http://www.usef.org/documents/competitions/2007/2007DrugsMedsGuidelines.pdf| archivedate= 11 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} ''Note: Specifically lists Furosemide.''</ref> and the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI), which governs international and [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] equestrian competition, ban the use of furosemide.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.feicleansport.org/2011_Equine_Prohibited_List.pdf |title= 2011 Prohibited Substances List |accessdate=May 12, 2011|year=2011 |format=PDF|work=Veterinary Regulations|publisher=Federation Equestre Internationale|page=26}} ''Note: Specifically lists Furosemide.''</ref>  On the other side of the controversy, several major stock horse registries that sanction their own shows, including the [[American Quarter Horse Association]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://aqha.com/Showing/Content-Pages/Resources/Exhibitors/Guide-to-Showing/Therapeutic-Medication-Fact-Sheet.aspx|title= Therapeutic Medication Fact Sheet |accessdate=September 25, 2012|publisher=[[American Quarter Horse Association]]}}</ref> [[American Paint Horse Association]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.apha.com/forms/rulebooks.html |title= APHA Rulebook |accessdate=January 31, 2008|pages= 78<U+2013>79, Rule CS<U+2013>085 |publisher=[[American Paint Horse Association]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071231044640/http://www.apha.com/forms/rulebooks.html| archivedate= 31 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and the [[Palomino]] Horse Breeders of America,<ref name=PHBA>{{cite web|url= http://www.palominohba.com/handbook/ |title= PHBA Rule Book |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |pages= 77<U+2013>78, Rule 2528A |publisher=Palomino Horse Breeders Association}} The PHBA does not allow Lasix within 24&nbsp;hours of show and only allows Acetazolamide for HYPP horses.</ref> allow acetazolamide and furosemide to be used within 24&nbsp;hours of showing under certain circumstances.
