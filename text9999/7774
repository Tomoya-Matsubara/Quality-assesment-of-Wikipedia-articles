'''Johnny Vegas''' (b. [[September 11]], [[1971]]) as '''Michael Pennington''' is an [[England|English]] comedian. 

==Early life==
He was born as the youngest of four siblings to Laurence and Patricia Pennington on {{Birth date and age|1971|9|11}}, having two older brothers (Robert and Mark) and an older sister (Catharine), in [[St Helens, Merseyside]]. At the age of eleven, he attended a boarding-school seminary to train for the priesthood, but came back homesick after four terms.<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1729544,00.html?gusrc=rss Interview, The Guardian]</ref>

==Life before fame==
For a time Vegas was a [[Redcoat (Butlins)]]; he studied art and [[ceramics (art)|ceramic design]] at [[Middlesex University]] for three years and attempted to forge a career in [[pottery]] but became disillusioned when he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|third class degree]]. His passion for pottery continues however to this day. He returned to St Helens, became a live-in barman and drank heavily.

Vegas made his TV debut as a contestant on ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'' in the UK under his real name of Michael, but made references to the fact he wanted to be a comedian and that his stage name was "Johnny Vegas". His appearance was briefly shown during [[Channel 4]]'s ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups''.

In the mid-nineties he spent some time living in [[London]] and [[Glasgow]] with the declared intention of becoming a [[stand up comedy|stand up comedian]]. In London, he was mentored by 'comedy godfather' [[Malcolm Hardee]].

==Fame==
===Early performances===
Before his success in the late 90s, Vegas was a comp<U+00E8>re of many comedy nights at the [[Citadel Arts Centre]][http://www.citadel.org.uk] in St Helens where he developed his character's stage performance; in London, Malcolm Hardee repeatedly booked him at his Up The Creek comedy club in [[Greenwich]].

His career took off when he won the Festival Critics' Award at the 1997 [[Edinburgh Festival]], and was the first newcomer to be nominated for the [[Perrier Award]]. Vegas also won the Leicester Mercury Comedian of The Year Competition in 1997.

His early shows ''The Johnny Vegas Gameshow'' and ''The Johnny Vegas Show'' contained elements such as Butlins style sing-a-longs, onstage pottery, verbal abuse of the audience, and drunkenness. He was accused of [[sexism]]. Audience members report great variation in the quality of the shows - on occasion the talent for ad-libbing seems to desert him to be replaced by a shambolic, fragmentary performance.

The [[pathos]] in these shows is often remarked upon as it is often hard to identify how much of the apparent disintegration of Vegas is performance and how much is a genuine, guileless display of personal pain.

===Major projects===
He appeared as "Al" in a series of adverts for [[ITV Digital]] around [[2001]]/[[2002]] with knitted [[Monkey (advertising character)|monkey]] (voiced by [[Ben Miller]]), whose name was simply Monkey ('Monkeh'). The ubiquity of these adverts made Vegas a household name, though Vegas now has to fend off (and does so with good humour) remarks about the failure of ITV Digital as an enterprise.

Vegas gave an award-winning performance as Charlie in [[2001]]'s ''[[Happiness (television series)|Happiness]]'', marking his transition from stand-up comedian to actor. 

In [[2003]] Vegas wrote and starred in a DVD-only film, ''[[Who's Ready For Ice Cream?]]'' in which he played himself. The plot centred around Vegas's fame and success having resulted in the decline of his stand-up ability and the resulting efforts to regain it. The film was directed by [[Stewart Lee]].

He starred in the [[2004]] film ''[[Sex Lives of the Potato Men]]''. He has displayed unshaking pride in the venture, despite very poor reviews, some going so far as to label it the worst film ever.

He wrote and starred in a [[BBC Radio 4]] sitcom called ''[[Night Class (radio series)|Night Class]]'', seemingly heavily autobiographical, about an ex red coat, pottery teacher called Johnny Vegas.  

In [[2004]], he co-starred in ''[[Dead Man Weds]]'' written by and co-starring of this series is [[Dave Spikey]]. 

He appeared in the [[2005]] comedy-drama ''[[Ideal (sitcom)|Ideal]]'', playing a drug dealer. Vegas also started presenting an unconventional Friday night chat/comedy show on [[Channel 4]] titled ''[[18 Stone of Idiot]]''.

Later in [[2005]], he appeared in straight acting roles on [[BBC One]], first in their high-profile adaptation of the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Bleak House (television)|Bleak House]]'' (as Krook), and then as [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] in an updated, modern-language version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.

In [[2005]], he appeared in a supporting role as 'Sackville', a poet and member of Charles II court in the film ''[[The Libertine (2005 film)|The Libertine]]'', starring [[Johnny Depp]].

In February [[2006]], he topped the bill at London's [[Hackney Empire]] in a 5-hour tribute show to comedy club owner Malcolm Hardee, who had drowned the previous month.

In January [[2007]] [[PG Tips]], a popular brand of tea in the UK, have reunited Johnny Vegas and the Monkey character in a new advertising campaign. They are emotionally reunited over the product, with Johnny notably cleaner and more sober than his characteristic appearance, presumably as PG Tips has always promoted a wholesome image and for many years used chimpanzees as humorous characters. Johnny and the Monkey had been mentioned in a show over the 2006 holiday period documenting really bad decisions ([[ITV Digital]]'s moribund launch, particularly buying the lesser league UK soccer rights), possibly sparking [[PG Tips]]' advertisers to bring them back together.

===Appearances===
Vegas appeared on [[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]<!-- episodes 8, 56, 89, 123; source www.tv.com --> and as a guest star on the music quiz show [[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]<!-- episode 66 -->
 
Vegas was well known for his impromptu rants at awards ceremonies, notably addressing [[Dustin Hoffman]] from the stage at the ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' movie awards in [[2003]].

He was given his own segment on ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'' shortly before the show came to an end in [[2002]] - some speculate it was his appearance that put the final nail in the coffin of this long running [[Bob Geldof]] show.

In the same year, he was seen as a regular panelist on team B on ''[[Shooting Stars]]'', with pint of Guinness perched by his buzzer.

In March 2006 Vegas was a guest on the Channel 4 show ''[[TV Heaven, Telly Hell]]'' hosted by [[Sean Lock]]. In the show Vegas voiced his opinions on various television programmes, including ''[[Sex and the City]]'', shopping channels such as [[QVC]], (Vegas has also previously parodied [[QVC]] and shopping channels in general in a sketch from ''[[Shooting Stars]]'').On May 2nd Johnny appeared in the Irish talk show [[The Podge and Rodge Show]] along with [[Jodie Marsh]].

In early 2006, Vegas and his family were filmed for the returning series ''Family Fortunes'' against ''Coronation Street'''s Jenny McAlpine and her family.

On September 15, he appeared on ''[[The Charlotte Church Show]]'' upsetting the host so much that she slapped him, and shouted 'shut the fuck up'. {{wikinewspar|Comedian pushes talk show host Charlotte Church over the edge, on air}}

Vegas has also appeared as the '[[Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car]]' on the BBC Two television series ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]''. He was the only guest without a driving licence to appear, and rounded the track in just under two minutes. In addition, he appeared on comedy quiz show [[QI]] alongside [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Alan Davies]] towards the end of 2007.

In September 2007, Vegas appeared in a documentary entitled "The Beginners Guide to Christian Evangelicalism", in which he travelled to the USA and attempted to recover the faith he lost as a child.

==Ceramics==
Having achieved fame in entertainment Vegas received belated plaudits for his ceramic work. ''Ceramic Review'' praised him, leading to a role in ''Pot Shots'' (collaborating with [[Roger Law]]), a film made for an international gathering of potters <sup>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/tventertainment/johnnyvegas.shtml]</sup>. 
This led to his work being acquired for a collection at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and a commission from [[Old Spice]] to design a bottle for their [[Shave#Aftershave|aftershave]].

In 2005 he participated in the celebrity special edition of ''[[The Generation Game]]'' demonstrating how to make a [[Teakettle|pot]], before judging the participants' attempts.

==Personal life==
He was married to Kitty Donnelley.  He famously sold pictures of the wedding to ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' magazine for <U+00A3>1.  Their son, Michael Junior, was born shortly before the couple separated.  Fourteen months after the separation, the couple reunited. They are said to have split again in March [[2007]]. In October [[2007]] Vegas was reported to have upset hotel guests in a drunken "rampage" in   holiday town [[Benidorm]], [[Spain]]<ref>[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article356549.ece Johnny Vegas in hotel rampage (The Sun Online]</ref>.
