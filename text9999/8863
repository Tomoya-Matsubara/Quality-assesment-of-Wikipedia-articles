==Reception==
Rock Journalist Keith Valcourt stated on behalf of the Butcher Babies: <U+201C>The Hottest Band in the World<U+201D> in his review of a show. The Butcher Babies deliver a loud crashing blend of heavy metal, punk and thrash that recalls Pantera, adding their stage show embodies the horror antics of Alice Cooper and Rob Zombie. Carla and Heidi don<U+2019>t merely sing: they assault the crowd with a blinding flash of aggression and abuse. And the crowd loves them for it.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/artist.aspx?IdArtist=613 |title=Century Media Records - Butcher Babies |publisher=Centurymedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref>
