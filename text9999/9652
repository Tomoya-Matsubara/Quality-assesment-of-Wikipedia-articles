'''Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa''' (born [[March 28]], [[1936]]) is a Peruvian [[writer]], [[politician]], [[journalist]] and  [[essayist]]. Vargas Llosa is not only considered to be one of Latin America's leading novelists and essayist, but also one of the leading authors of his generation. He has continued to write prolifically, and is considered to have a greater international impact and world-wide audience than any other writer of the [[Latin American Boom]].<ref name="Bolland7">{{Harvnb|Boland|Harvey|1988|p=7}}</ref>

Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the [[1960s]] with novels such as ''La ciudad y los perros'' (''[[The Time of the Hero]]''), ''La casa verde'' (''[[The Green House]]''), and the monumental  ''Conversaci<U+00F3>n en la catedral'' (''[[Conversation in the Cathedral]]''). His novels span many [[literary genre]]s, including comedy, murder mystery, history, and political thriller. Several, such as ''[[Pantale<U+00F3>n y las visitadoras]]'' and ''[[Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter|La t<U+00ED>a Julia y el escribidor]]'', have been adapted as feature films (the latter as ''[[Tune in Tomorrow]]'').

Like many Latin American authors, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career, and has gradually moved from the [[political left]] towards the [[right-wing politics|right]]. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of [[Fidel Castro]], Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted. He ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990, as the center-right [[FREDEMO]] coalition candidate, advocating [[neoliberal]] reforms. Subsequently, he has supported conservative-moderate candidates.  

Vargas Llosa now lives in Madrid and London, but spends roughly three months of the year in his native Peru.<ref name=emilyparker/> He has been married twice, and his children include the writer [[<U+00C1>lvaro Vargas Llosa]].

==Early life and family==
 
Mario Vargas Llosa was born on [[March 28]], [[1936]], in the [[Peru]]vian provincial city of [[Arequipa]] to a middle class family of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent. He was the only child of Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta, but his parents separated a couple of months before his birth.<ref name="Williams17">{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=17}}</ref>  There are many speculations on why Mario's parent's separated, including the social inferiority of Ernesto Vargas to the Llosa family and the mistreatment and oppression of Dora Llosa by Ernesto.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|p=12}}</ref> When Dora Llosa returned to Arequipa in 1935, pregnant with Mario, Ernesto Vargas ignored her presence and filed for divorce. A few months after Mario's birth, Ernesto revealed an affair with a German woman, with whom he had two children, Mario's two half brothers, Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|p=14}}</ref>

Mario lived with his maternal family in Arequipa until a year after his parents' divorce, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia. Mario, his mother, and her family then moved to [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]], where he spent his childhood.<ref name="Williams17"/> His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather who also managed a cotton farm.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|pp=6&ndash;7}}</ref> While growing up in Cochabamba, his mother and her family told him that his father had died, not that his parents had separated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=24}}</ref>  During the government of [[Jos<U+00E9> Luis Bustamante y Rivero]], his paternal grandfather obtained an important political post in the Peruvian coastal city of [[Piura]], which prompted Vargas Llosa and his mother to return to Peru near his grandfather and study in the ''Colegio Salesiano''.  In 1946, at the age of ten, Vargas Llosa moved to [[Lima]] and met his father for the first time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=30}}</ref>  His parents reestablished their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=31}}</ref>  While in Lima he studied at the ''Colegio La Salle''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=20}}</ref>  When Vargas Llosa was 14, his father sent him to the [[Leoncio Prado Military Academy]] in Lima where he claims to have gained inspiration for writing the novel ''La ciudad y los perros''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vincent|2007|pp=2}}</ref>

A year before his graduation, Vargas Llosa was already working as an amateur journalist for various local newspapers.<ref name="castro-klaren9">{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar<U+00E9>n|1990|p=9}}</ref> He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, ''La Industria'', and where the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, ''La Huida del Inca'', took place.

During the government of [[Manuel A. Odr<U+00ED>a]] in 1953, Vargas Llosa enrolled in Lima's [[National University of San Marcos]] to study [[law]] and [[literature]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=39}}</ref> In 1955, at the age of 19, he married Julia Urquidi, his uncle's sister-in-law; he was 13 years younger than her.<ref name="castro-klaren9" /> Vargas Llosa began his literary career in 1957 with the publication of his first short stories, ''Los jefes'' and ''El abuelo.''<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar<U+00E9>n|1990|p=21}}</ref> He graduated from San Marcos in 1958, and in the same year he received a scholarship to study at the ''Universidad Complutense de Madrid'' in Spain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=44}}</ref> In 1960, after his scholarship in Madrid had expired, Vargas Llosa moved to France under the impression he would receive a scholarship to study there; however, after he arrived in Paris he found out he wouldn't be receiving one.<ref name="williams45">{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=45}}</ref>  Despite their poor economic status, Mario and Julia decided to remain in Paris where he was able to begin writing prolifically.<ref name="williams45" /> Their marriage only lasted for a few more years, and in 1964 they divorced.<ref name="williams54">{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=54}}</ref> A year later, in 1965, Vargas Llosa married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa.<ref name="williams54" />

==Major works==

===''The Time of the Hero''===
{{main|The Time of the Hero}}
Vargas Llosa first came to wide public attention as a writer in [[1963 in literature|1963]] with ''La Ciudad y Los Perros'' (whose title literally means "The City and the Dogs," though the book has been translated into English as ''The Time of the Hero'', 1966).  The book is set among a community of cadets in a Lima military school and is based on the author's personal experiences at the Leoncio Prado Military Academy;<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=32}}</ref> although the use of narrative time, aspects of the plot and the development of one of the main characters were all influenced by Vargas Llosa's favourite William Faulkner novel, ''Light in August.''<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=34}}</ref>  The novel also shows the influence of the [[existentialist]] works of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and quotes a dialogue from one of his novels at the beginning of each of its two parts.  This novel established what would become the main theme of Vargas Llosa's narrative: the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|p=66&ndash;67}}</ref> The book immediately impressed critics due to its vitality and adept usage of sophisticated literary technique.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=33}}</ref>

===''The Green House''===
{{main|The Green House}}
Vargas Llosa followed ''La Ciudad y Los Perros'' by writing ''La casa verde'' (''The Green House'', 1966), a novel that shows the considerable influence that William Faulkner had on the budding writer.<ref name="booker6">{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=6}}</ref>  Some critics still consider this book to be Vargas Llosa's finest and most important achievement.<ref name="booker6" /> The novel deals with a brothel called the Green House, and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters.  The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church, and the transformation that will lead her to become la Selvatica, the best known prostitute of the Green House.  The novel immediately received enthusiastic critical reception, confirming Vargas Llosa in his position as an important voice of Latin American narrative.<ref name="Kristal xi"/> ''The Green House'' went on to win the first edition of the [[R<U+00F3>mulo Gallegos prize|R<U+00F3>mulo Gallegos International Novel Prize]] in 1967, out-voting works by the veteran [[Uruguay]]an writer [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] and by Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez.<ref>{{Harvnb|Armas|1991|p=101}}</ref> This novel alone accumulated enough awards to place the author amongst the leading figures of the Latin-American boom at the time.<ref name="booker6" />

===''Conversation in the Cathedral''===
{{main|Conversation in the Cathedral}}
At the age of 33, Vargas Llosa completed his third novel, which critics considered his most valuable narrative cycle as well as his most overtly political novel.<ref>{{Harvnb| Rossman |1987|p=493}}</ref>  Published in two volumes, ''Conversaci<U+00F3>n en la Catedral'' (''Conversation in the Cathedral'', 1969) was Vargas Llosa's first attempt at what he calls a "total novel," that is, the depiction of all the levels of a society through fiction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar<U+00E9>n|1990|p=77}}</ref> The novel is a portrayal of Peru under the dictatorship of [[Manuel A. Odr<U+00ED>a|Odr<U+00ED>a]] in the 1950s, and deals with the lives of characters from different [[social strata]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Kristal |1998|p=56}}</ref>  The ambitious narrative is built around the stories of Santiago Zavala and Ambrosio respectively; one the son of a minister, the other his chauffeur.<ref>{{Harvnb| Kristal |1998|p=61}}</ref>  A random meeting at a [[dog pound]] leads to a riveting conversation between the two at a nearby bar known as the Cathedral (hence the title).<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar<U+00E9>n|1990|p=80}}</ref> During the encounter Zavala tries to find the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way. Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead-end with no answers and no sign of a improved future.<ref name="castro-klaren106">{{Harvnb| Castro-Klar<U+00E9>n |1990|p=106}}</ref>.  This hopelessness allows for ''Conversation in the Cathedral'' to emerge as Vargas Llosa's most bitter novel.<ref name="castro-klaren106" />

===''The War of the End of the World''===
{{main|The War of the End of the World}}
''La guerra del fin del mundo'' (''The War of the End of the World''), published in 1981, is a fictional recreation of the [[War of Canudos]], an incident in 19th-century [[Brazil]] in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months.<ref name="booker75">{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=75}}</ref>  However, ''The War of the End of the World'' is not directly based on the real historical events; rather its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by [[Euclides da Cunha]] in 1902.<ref name="booker75" /> Similar to his earlier work, this novel carries with it a sober and serious theme, with an overall dark tone.<ref name="booker75" /> Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of the propensity of humanity to idealize violence, the comprehensions of war, and a man-made catastrophe brought on from the unexpected consequences of fanaticism, has earned ''La guerra del fin del mundo'' not only the recognition of his most ambitious and accomplished theme, but also, as considered by some critics, his greatest work of literature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=124}}</ref>

===''The Feast of the Goat''===
[[Image:Feast of the Goat.jpg|thumb|120px|right|A translation of [[The Feast of the Goat]]]]
{{main|The Feast of the Goat}}
''La Fiesta del Chivo,''(''The Feast of the Goat'') is Mario Vargas Llosa's most complete, most ambitious, and longest novel since ''The War at the End of the World.''<ref name="Williams267">{{Harvnb| Williams |2001|p=267}}</ref> Published in 2000, it is based on the historical dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]], who governed the [[Dominican Republic]] from 1930 until his assassination in 1961.<ref name="Williams267"/> Despite not being entirely accurate in a historical sense, Vargas Llosa employs [[literary realism]] throughout this novel; in fact, while describing ''The Feast of the Goat,'' he said, "I didn't invent anything that couldn't have happened."<ref>{{Harvnb| Williams |2001|p=270}}</ref> The novel has three main strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, daughter of a former political figure and Trujillo loyalist, who returns for the first time since leaving the Dominican Republic after Tujillo's assassination thirty years previously; the second strand concentrates on the assassination itself, the conspirators who carry it out, and its consequences; and the third and final strand deals with Trujillo himself in scenes from the end of his regime.<ref name="Williams267"/>

''La Fiesta del Chivo'' quickly received positive reviews in both Spain and Latin America.<ref>{{Harvnb| Williams |2001|p=268}}</ref> This novel has had a significant impact on the Latin-American world and is regarded as one of Vargas Llosa's best pieces of work.<ref name="Williams267"/>

==Other works==

Vargas Llosa followed his monumental work ''Conversaci<U+00F3>n en la catedral'' with the shorter and much more comic ''Pantale<U+00F3>n y las visitadoras'' (''[[Captain Pantoja and the Special Service]]'', 1972), which, through a series of vignettes of dialogues and documents, follows the establishment by the Peruvian armed forces of a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas.<ref name="booker33">{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=33}}</ref> These aspects of the plot are extremely similar to those of one of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels, ''The Green House;'' in fact, ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'' is basically a parody of both ''The Green House'' itself, as well as the literary approach that novel represents.<ref name="booker33" />

In 1977 Vargas Llosa published ''La tia Julia y el escribidor'' (''[[Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter]]''), based in part on his first marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=91}}</ref> She later wrote a memoir, ''Lo que Varguitas no dijo'' (''What Little Vargas Didn't Say'') in which she gave her own version of their relationship, stating how Vargas Llosa exaggerated many negative points in their courtship and marriage and minimized her role in assisting his literary career in his mock autobiography.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=221}}</ref> ''La tia Julia y el escribidor'' is considered to be one of the most striking examples of how language and imagery of pop culture is used in literature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=54}}</ref> Subsequently, Vargas Llosa's novel has been adapted into a Hollywood feature film, ''[[Tune in Tomorrow]]''.

Vargas Llosa's most recent novel, ''Travesuras de la ni<U+00F1>a mala'' (2006), relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate, with a woman with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.

== Style ==

Vargas Llosa's novels cover many different literary genres, including comedy (''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service''),<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=33}}</ref> crime fiction (''[[Who Killed Palomino Molero?]]''),<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar<U+00E9>n|1990|p=19}}</ref> the historical novel (''[[The War of the End of the World]]''),<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=75}}</ref> the political thriller (''The Feast of the Goat''),<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=267}}</ref> and erotic literature (''The Notebooks of Don Rigoberto'').  His writing style often includes intricate changes in time and narrator, similar to that of American novelist [[William Faulkner]], whom Vargas Llosa acknowledges as an extremely important literary influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=26}}</ref>

Mario Vargas Llosa's novels are considered to fall under the category of both [[modernist]] and [[postmodernist]] works.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=32}}</ref> His early works, such as, ''The Green House'' and ''Conversation in the Cathedral'' seem to be of a modernist vein; however, his later texts, including, ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service,'' ''Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,'' ''The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta,'' and ''The Storyteller'' appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=3}}</ref> Moreover, his earlier work seems to have a more serious, complex and fragmented tone, compared to a more farcical, simplistic one that is generally found in his later novels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=35}}</ref>  Vargas Llosa has been commended for his ability to combine both complex writing structures with simplistic themes into his works.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=51}}</ref> 

Vargas Llosa constantly uses the technique of interlacing dialogs throughout the majority of his novels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=13}}</ref>  By combining two conversations that occurred at different times, this technique creates the illusion of a flashback (shifting time). Moreover, Vargas Llosa sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location, rather than time, by weaving together two conversations that are taking place at the same time, but in different places.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=14}}</ref> 

Many of his works are based on historical events and his personal experiences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=48}}</ref> Most of Vargas Llosa's novels embody traditional themes that surround the conflictive nature of the characters and the illustration and interrelation of the different cultural, socio-economic, and political aspects of Peruvian and Latin American Society.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fern<U+00E1>ndez|1997|p=9}}</ref>  Many of his earlier novels were set in Peru.<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar<U+00E9>n|1990|p=19}}</ref>  However, in more recent novels he has expanded to other regions of Latin-America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic.  One of his more recent novels ''El para<U+00ED>so en la otra esquina'' (''The Way to Paradise'' (2003)) is set largely in [[France]] and [[Tahiti]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Vargas Llosa|2003|p=}}</ref>

==Political involvement==
Like many Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was initially a supporter of the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.<ref name="Kristal xi">{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=xi}}</ref>  However, he eventually became disenchanted with the policies of the Cuban government and moved considerably to the right.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|p=234}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Armas|1991|p=109}}</ref>
Ever since he detached himself from communist ideals, he has opposed both left and right wing authoritarian regimes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vincent|2007|p=1}}</ref> 

[[Image:Fredemo-vargasllosa.jpg|thumb|left|Vargas Llosa 1990 election poster]]
During the 1980s, Vargas Llosa became increasingly politically active in his native country, and became known for his staunch neoliberal views.  In 1987, he helped form and soon became leader of the Movimiento Libertad.<ref name="Bolland8">{{Harvnb|Boland|Harvey|1988|p=8}}</ref>  The following year his party entered into a coalition with the parties of Peru's two principal conservative politicians at the time, ex-president [[Fernando Belaunde Terry]] ([[Popular Action|AP]]) and [[Luis Bedoya Reyes]] ([[Partido Popular Cristiano (Peru)|PPC]]), to form the tripartite coalition known as Frente Democratico (FREDEMO).<ref name="Bolland8"/>  He ran for the presidency of Peru in 1990 as the candidate of the center-right FREDEMO coalition.  He proposed a drastic austerity program that frightened most of the country's poor. This program emphasized the need for privatization, a market economy, free trade, and most importantly, the dissemination of private property.<ref name=emilyparker>{{Harvnb|Parker|2007}}</ref>  During the campaign, his opponents read racy passages of his works over the radio in an apparent attempt to shock voters.  Although he won the first round with 34% of the vote, Vargas Llosa was defeated by a then-unknown agricultural engineer, [[Alberto Fujimori]], in the subsequent run-off.<ref name=emilyparker/> His account of his run for the presidency was subsequently included in a memoir, published in an English-language translation (by Helen Lane) as ''A Fish in the Water.''<ref>{{Harvnb|Larsen|2000|p=155}}</ref> Since his defeat, Vargas Llosa has focused mainly on his writing, with the occasional political involvement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=82}}</ref>

After acquiring Spanish citizenship in 1993, Vargas Llosa has increasingly made Spain his home, spending less time in his native country of Peru.<ref name="Williams83">{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=83}}</ref> In 1994 he was elected a member of the Spanish Royal Academy ([[Real Academia Espa<U+00F1>ola]]).<ref name="Williams83"/> He has also been involved in the country's political arena. On February 2008, he stopped supporting the [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] in favor of the recently created [[Union, Progress and Democracy|UPD]], claiming that certain conservative views held by the former party go against his liberal beliefs. His political ideologies appear in the book ''[[Pol<U+00ED>tica razonable]]'', written by himself along with [[Fernando Savater]], [[Rosa D<U+00ED>ez]], [[<U+00C1>lvaro Pombo]], [[Albert Boadella]] and [[Carlos Mart<U+00ED>nez Gorriar<U+00E1>n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://actualidad.terra.es/articulo/escritor_mario_vargas_llosa_pp_2277630.htm|title=Escritor Mario Vargas Llosa retira su apoyo al PP y pide el voto para UPyD|accessdate=2008-03-22|work=Terra Actualidad|language=Spanish}}</ref>

==Personal life==

Vargas Llosa has written a book-length study on [[Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez]], a onetime friend with whom he subsequently parted ways in 1976 when Vargas Llosa punched Garcia Marquez in the face in Mexico city at the ''Palacio de Bellas Artes.''<ref>{{Harvnb|Armas|1991|p=101}}</ref> A picture of Garcia Marquez's black eye was published in 2007.<ref>See Noam Cohen, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/books/29marq.html?_r=1&em&ex=11&oref=slogin "Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez<U+2019>s Shiner Ends Its 31 Years of Quietude"], ''New York Times'' (March 29, 2007) or [http://passouline.blog.lemonde.fr/files/2007/03/gabo.1174228476.jpg here]</ref> Although he has not spoken to Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez since, Vargas Llosa recently agreed to allow part of this book to be used as the introduction to a new edition of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', which is being re-released in Spain and throughout Latin America.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vincent|2007|p=3}}</ref> 

After the book, entitled ''Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez: historia de un deicidio,'' was published in 1971 in an edition of 20,000 copies, the initial edition quickly sold out; but despite great demand (and at least one pirated edition) Vargas Llosa refused to allow its republication for many years. The study was eventually included in a volume of his collected works in 2006. It has not been translated into English. He has also written book-length studies of Flaubert and of the [[Valencian]] writer [[Joanot Martorell]].  Vargas Llosa's discussion of his own novels is contained in ''A Writer's Reality'' (1991).

Vargas Llosa has taught at the [[Queen Mary College]] and King's College of the [[University of London]], [[Washington State University]] (Pullman), the [[University of Puerto Rico]] (R<U+00ED>o Piedras), at [[Columbia University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Georgetown University]] and at [[The City University of New York]].<ref name="sketch"> [http://libweb.princeton.edu/libraries/firestone/rbsc/aids/llosa/#bio "Biographical Sketch"]. Mario Vargas Llosa Papers.  Princeton University Library.</ref>

Vargas Llosa lives primarily in London and Madrid, and recently became a Spanish citizen.<ref name="Williams83"/> He has three children with his second wife, Patricia Llosa: <U+00C1>lvaro Vargas Llosa, a writer and editor; Gonzalo, a businessman; and Morgana, a photographer.

==Legacy ==

Mario Vargas Llosa is known as one of the major writers in Latin American literature.<ref name="castro-klaren1">{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar<U+00E9>n|1990|p=1}}</ref>  He is noted among other greats such as, [[Julio Cortazar]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]].<ref name="castro-klaren1" />  Indeed, for the literary critic [[Gerald Martin]] (writing in 1987), Vargas Llosa was "perhaps the most successful" as well as "certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years."<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|1987|p=205}}</ref>

The majority of Vargas Llosa's narratives have been translated into multiple languages--marking his international critical success.<ref name="castro-klaren1" />  Vargas Llosa is also noted for his substantial career as a journalist, an accomplishment not characteristic of many other Latin American writers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar<U+00E9>n|1990|p=2}}</ref> He is recognized among those who have most consciously promoted the embracing of both literature in general, and more specifically the novel itself, as avenues for meaningful commentary about life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mu<U+00F1>oz|2000|p=2}}</ref> During his prolific career, he has written more than a dozen novels, as well as numerous other books and stories, has been a voice for Latin-American literature for decades, and has also been a Presidential candidate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=84}}</ref> He has won numerous awards for his writing, from the 1959 [[Premio Leopoldo Alas]] and the 1962 [[Premio Biblioteca Breve]] to the 1993 [[Premio Planeta]] (for ''[[Lituma en los Andes]]'') and the Jerusalem Prize in 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DD1539F934A25752C0A963958260 |title=Vargas Llosa Wins The Jerusalem Prize|accessdate=2008-03-20 |work=New York Times [[January 17]], [[1995]]}}</ref>  The most important distinction he has received to date has probably been the 1994 award of the [[Cervantes Prize]], usually considered the most important prize in Spanish-language literature.

A number of Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted to the screen, including ''La ciudad y los perros'', ''Pantale<U+00F3>n y los visitadores'' (both by the distinguished Peruvian director [[Francisco Lombardi]]) and ''La fiesta del chivo'' (by Vargas Llosa's own cousin, [[Luis Llosa]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889771/ |title=Mario Vargas Llosa |accessdate=2008-03-20 |work=The Internet Movie Database }}</ref>  ''The Feast of the Goat'' has also been adapted as a theatrical play by [[Jorge Al<U+00ED> Triana]], a Colombian playwright and director.<ref>{{Harvnb|Navarro|2003|p=}}</ref>
