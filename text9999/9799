==Chronology of events==
===2011===
====October====
Following protests in London, Bristol and elsewhere in Britain, a Facebook page was set up under the name of Occupy Bath, calling for a public meeting to discuss the possibility of a protest camp in Bath. The meeting, held at the Percy Centre, agreed upon the date of 30 October 2011 for the establishment of a camp at location undisclosed to the attendees of the meeting.<ref name="bchron2">{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/Talks-12-day-occupation-Bath/story-13678201-detail/story.html |title=Talks on 12-day occupation of Bath|accessdate=2012-02-01 |publisher=This Is Bath|date=27 October 2011}}</ref>

Approximately 30 protestors met at Green Park Station on 30 October 2011 to determine the location of the camp and decided on [[Queen Square]], due to it being passed by thousands of people every day.<ref name="bchron1" /> The camp was established later that night, with 11 tents set up.<ref name="bchron1" /> Avon and Somerset police were in attendance at the beginning, but left after they considered the protest to be peaceful. <ref name="nowbath1">{{cite news|url=http://www.nowbath.co.uk/local-news/occupy-bath-gets-underway-40418/|title=Updated: Occupy Bath Gets Underway|accessdate=2012-02-01 |publisher=Now Bath|date=31 October 2011}}</ref>

==Manifesto==
The Occupy Bath Manifesto<ref name="bchron9" /> <ref name="nowbath2" />:

1 The current system is unsustainable. It is undemocratic and unjust. We need alternatives..

2 We are of all ethnicity, backgrounds, genders, generations, sexualities dis/abilities and faiths. We stand together with occupations all over the world.

3 We refuse to pay for the banks' crisis.

4 We do not accept the cuts as either necessary or inevitable. We demand an end to global tax injustice and our democracy representing corporations instead of the people.

5 We want regulators to be genuinely independent of the industries they regulate.

6 We support the strike on November 30 and the student action on November 9, and actions to defend our health services, welfare, education and employment, and to stop wars and arms dealing.

7 We want structural change towards authentic global equality. The world's resources must go towards caring for people and the planet, not the military, corporate profits or the rich.

8 We stand in solidarity with the global oppressed and we call for an end to the actions of our government and others in causing this oppression.

9 This is what democracy looks like. Come and join us!
