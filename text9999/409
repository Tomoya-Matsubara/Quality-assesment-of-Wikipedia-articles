'''John Joscelyn''' or '''John Joscelin''' (1529<U+2013>1603) was an English clergyman and antiquarian as well as secretary to [[Matthew Parker]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] during the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Joscelyn was involved in Parker's attempts to secure and publish medieval manuscripts on church history, and was one of the first scholars of the [[Old English]] language.  He also studied the early law codes of England. His Old English dictionary, although not published during his lifetime, contributed greatly to the study of that language. Many of his manuscripts and papers eventually became part of the collections of [[Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University]], or the [[British Library]].

==Early life==

Joscelyn was born in 1529, and was the son of Sir Thomas Joscelin and Dorothy Gate. John Joscelyn was their third son to survive childhood, and was probably born on his father's estate at [[High Roding|High Roding, Essex]]. He attended [[Queen's College, Cambridge|Queen's College]] at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] beginning in 1545, attaining a Bachelor's of Arts in 1549.<ref name=DNB/><ref>{{Venn|id=JSCN545J|name=Joscelyn, John}}</ref> In the school year 1550<U+2013>1551 he taught Latin at Queen's College, and the following school year he taught Greek. At the end of 1552, he was awarded a Master of Arts. In 1555, during Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]'s reign, Joscelyn subscribed to the required church doctrine, and was once more a teacher of Greek during the school year 1556<U+2013>1557.  However, in 1557 he resigned from his fellowship at Queen's College.<ref name=DNB>Martin "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15130 Joscelin <nowiki>[Joscelyn]</nowiki>, John (1529<U+2013>1603)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

==Work for Parker==

Shortly after he was appointed as archbishop, in 1559 Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, named Joscelyn to a [[Chaplain|chaplainacy]], and also as his Latin language secretary. The following year Parker gave Joscelyn a [[prebend]] in [[Hereford]], held until 1577. Unusually for the time, besides Greek and Latin Joscelyn was a scholar of Hebrew. From Parker's interest in the history of early Christianity, and to discover more information about the growth of papal power in the Middle Ages, Joscelyn also began to study [[Old English language|Old English]] (a topic of interest to Parker), and helped the archbishop in his studies of the English pre-[[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] church. Joscelyn helped discover lost manuscripts, obtained them for Parker, and prepared them for publication. Joscelyn also acquired manuscripts for himself, 40&nbsp;of which were written in Old English.<ref name=DNB/>

Joseclyn often annotated the manuscripts he or Parker owned, and even inserted some pages of faked script into the D manuscript of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.  He was, however, also concerned that their collections be properly cared for.  He had a good understanding of the law codes of the English [[Anglo-Saxon]] kings, which he used in the preparation of an Old English-Latin dictionary he worked on, but which was never completed.<ref name=DNB/> The dictionary was, however, of great help to later Old English scholars, as it passed into the hands of [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Robert Cotton]], and became part of the [[Cotton library]] as manuscripts Titus A xv and Titus A xvi.  Joscelyn's written work on Old English grammar also became part of the Cotton library, but was lost after Cotton loaned the manuscript to [[William Camden]] in 1612.<ref name=Graham422/>

==Legacy and death==

Joscelyn also published an edition of [[Gildas|Gildas']] work ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' in 1568, and wrote a history of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] at Cambridge that remained unpublished until 1880, 200&nbsp;years after his death. He contributed extensively to Parker's ''[[A Testimonie of Antiquitie Shewing the Auncient Fayth in the Church of England]]'', the earliest printed book containing portions in Old English.<ref name=DNB/> Joscelyn also contributed a large part of Parker's ''De Antiquitate Britannicae'', published in 1572.<ref name=Graham422/>

In 1577, Parker's successor gave Joscelyn a rectory at [[Hollingbourne, Kent]], replacing the prebend at Hereford.<ref name=DNB/>

Joscelyn died on 28 December 1602, probably at High Roding, and was buried in All Saint's Church in High Roding. He never married.<ref name=DNB/>

Joscelyn's contributions to the study of Old English have been called "a significant contribution to the development of the study of the language".<ref name=Graham422/> Besides his dictionary and grammar, his working notebook also became part of the Cotton library, now manuscript Vitellius D.vii. Other of his manuscripts, either written or acquired by him, were either given to Corpus Christi College by Parker's heirs, or became parts of the [[British Library]] or the [[Bodleian Library]].<ref name=Graham422>Graham "Anglo-Saxon Studies" ''Companion to Anglo-Saxon Literature'' pp. 422<U+2013>423</ref>
