'''No. 72 Wing''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] that operated during World War&nbsp;II. It was formed in April 1943 at [[Townsville]], Queensland, as part of North Eastern Area Command. Led by Group Captain [[Charles Eaton (RAAF officer)|Charles Eaton]], the wing soon deployed to [[Merauke]], Dutch New Guinea, where it comprised three [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s flying [[CAC Boomerang]] and [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, and [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|A-31 Vengeance]] dive bombers. Eaton was succeeded by Group Captain [[Allan Walters]] in mid-1943. No.&nbsp;72 Wing took part in the defence of [[Torres Strait]], undertaking interception, patrol and occasional ground-attack and anti-shipping duties. By July 1944, its original squadrons had all been disbanded or transferred to other operational formations. [[No. 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron]], which had arrived in May 1944, operating Kittyhawks, remained at Merauke until February 1945. The wing headquarters returned to Australia that May, and disbanded the following month.

No.&nbsp;72 Wing was formed on 23&nbsp;April 1943 at [[Townsville]], Queensland, under the command of Group Captain [[Charles Eaton (RAAF officer)|Charles Eaton]]. Early the next month, its headquarters deployed to [[Merauke]], described by the [[Australia in the War of 1939<U+2013>1945|official history of the RAAF in World War&nbsp;II]] as "a desolate marshy little port in Dutch New Guinea".<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 113]</ref><ref name="Monograph">AWM, ''Squadrons, Formations & Units of the Royal Australian Air Force and Their Deployment'', p. 119</ref> Controlling [[No. 84 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;84 Squadron]] (flying [[CAC Boomerang]] fighters), [[No. 86 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;86 Squadron]] ([[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters), and [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;12 Squadron]] ([[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|A-31 Vengeance]] dive bombers), the wing's purpose was to assist in the defence of [[Torres Strait]]. The Boomerangs, operating out of [[Horn Island, Queensland|Horn Island]], undertook air defence and patrol tasks in and around western New Guinea, first making contact with enemy forces on 16 May; they exchanged fire with three Japanese bombers, but the latter escaped into cloud. Merauke airfield was only completed in late June, and Nos.&nbsp;86 and 12 Squadrons began arriving early the next month; by then the wing had also acquired No.&nbsp;44 Operational Base Unit and its own medical receiving station and mobile fighter sector headquarters.<ref name="Odgers">Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 113<U+2013>116</ref> Eaton's relations with North Eastern Area Command in Townsville had meanwhile became strained. In his opinion, "the problems of Merauki were not understood from there&nbsp;... mountains were made out of molehills", and he was posted that July to lead a bombing and gunnery establishment in South Australia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Chris|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140082b.htm|title=Eaton, Charles (1895<U+2013>1979)|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate= on 12 May 2013}}</ref>  Later in the year he would form [[No. 79 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;79 Wing]] at Batchelor, Northern Territory.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/13.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 215<U+2013>218]</ref>

Group Captain [[Allan Walters]], formerly in charge of [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 (Fighter) Wing]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], assumed command of No.&nbsp;72 Wing following Eaton's reassignment.<ref name="Gillison">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/07.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp. 141<U+2013>142]</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Funnell|first=Ray|authorlink=Ray Funnell|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/walters-allan-leslie-11954/text21425|title=Walters, Allan Leslie (1905<U+2013>1968)|work= Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate= on 12 May 2013}}</ref> Enemy contact was generally sporadic and inconclusive, but on 9&nbsp;September 1944 a force of over thirty Japanese bombers and escorting fighters heading for Merauke were intercepted by fourteen of No.&nbsp;72 Wing's Kittyhawks and four of its Boomerangs; although most of the Kittyhawks' guns failed to fire through oil clogging, and none of the Boomerangs made contact, the Australian aircraft claimed one bomber and two fighters destroyed without loss. No.&nbsp;12 Squadron became fully operational at Merauke in September, but was mainly given patrol duty and only rarely saw enemy activity. The following month, No.&nbsp;84 Squadron converted to Kittyhawks and transferred to a new formation, [[No. 75 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;75 Wing]]. During late 1943 and early 1944, No.&nbsp;86 Squadron was actively engaged in air defence, enjoying some success against Japanese bombers and their escorts, as well as participating in attacks on infrastructure and shipping in Dutch New Guinea.<ref name="Odgers"/>

No.&nbsp;86 Squadron departed Merauke on 25&nbsp;April 1944; the squadron was subsequently reduced to a [[En cadre|cadre]] and its Kittyhawks transferred to [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;78]] and [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|81 Wings]] of [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|No.&nbsp;10 Operational Group]] on [[Numfor|Noemfoor Island]].<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/14.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 227]</ref><ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', p. 92</ref> It was replaced by the Dutch-Australian [[No. 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;120 Squadron]], which arrived from [[Canberra]] in early May and became operational on the 9th of the month.<ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', p. 101</ref> Walters handed over command of the wing to Group Captain Bill Hely in May.<ref name="ADB">{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Brian|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hely-william-lloyd-bill-10480/text18591|title=Hely, William Lloyd (Bill) (1909<U+2013>1970)|work= Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate= on 12 May 2013}}</ref> In July, No.&nbsp;12 Squadron was withdrawn to [[Strathpine, Queensland|Strathpine]], Queensland, where it was reduced to cadre status ahead of converting to [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers and eventually serving with another new formation, [[No. 85 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;85 Wing]].<ref>Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', p. 48</ref><ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', p. 36</ref> Hely departed in September 1944 to establish an army cooperation formation, [[No. 84 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;84 Wing]], at [[Cairns]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/19.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 318]</ref> Most of the RAAF units at Merauke were redeployed in late 1944 but No.&nbsp;120 Squadron remained there until February 1945, when it was declared non-operational.
