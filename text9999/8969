==History==
[[Image:CastelloMap.JPG|230px|right|thumb|Lower Manhattan in 1660, when it was part of [[New Amsterdam]]. The large structure toward the tip of the island is [[Fort Amsterdam]].]]
The name ''Manhattan'' derives from the word Manna-hata so written earliest in the 1609 logbook (Record of October 2) of Robert Juet, an officer of the [[Dutch East India Company]] yacht ''[[Halve Maen]]'' or Half Moon.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-history-hs216a1v,0,919043.story?coll=ny-lihistory-navigation Full Text of Robert Juet's Journal: From the collections of the New York Historical Society, Second Series, 1841 log book], ''[[Newsday]]'',.

"Note that Hudson's river is here called Mauritius River so named by Henry Hudson after stadholder (governor) Prince Maurice."</ref> It was the explorer Adriaen Block who, in a text of 1613, referred to it as "Hudson's river". During the Dutch period the river was mostly referred to as the North River which, until this very day, is the name used by people active in the maritime industry.
 
A manuscript map of 1610 depicts the name Manahata twice, on the west as well as the east side of the Mauritius River (later named Hudson River), referring to the tribes that lived at the mouth of the river as the Manahata Indians. Later historians supposed that these people would have been the [[Lenape]] and some have translated the manifold variations of the word as "island of many hills" from the [[Lenape language]].<ref name=Mannahatta>Holloway, Marguerite.

"He could envision what Henry Hudson saw in 1609 as he sailed along Mannahatta, which in the Lenape dialect most likely meant ''island of many hills.'''</ref> In 1625, Johannes de Laet, Director of the [[Dutch West India Company]] wrote in his <U+201C>New World<U+201D>, <U+201C>The great North River of New-Netherland is called by some the Manhattas River from the people who dwell near its mouth; but by our countrymen it is generally called the Great River<U+201D>.

He thus confirmed that the island had been purchased in 1626 by [[Peter Minuit]], the third director of [[New Netherland]] from the native [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for 60 guilders worth of trade goods<ref>[http://teachpol.tcnj.edu/amer_pol_hist/fi/00000002.htm Letter of 1626 stating that Manhattan Island had been purchased for the value of 60 guilders], accessed [[April 26]], [[2007]].</ref> (traditionally converted to about $24) which according to the Oregon State University website's estimated conversion factors, is about the equivalent of 500<U+2013>700 [[United States Dollar|USD]] today.  However, if the money had been invested at anything above a 6.25% return (essentially a bond's current yield), it would be worth over $250 billion today, which exceeds Manhattan's estimated value of $200 billion.<ref>This number is still inaccurate since the most recent estimate of Central Park alone is over half a trillion dollars ($528,783,552,000). That is the estimated real-estate value of Central Park<U+2019>s 843 acres at this moment, according to Jonathan Miller, head of the property-appraisal firm Miller Samuel.

It is virtually impossible to make more or less exact comparison of societies, values and price structures dated back to 1626, and 2006. The source warns that data of 1913 and earlier are highly approximative. Besides, the data, which had been tabulated, based on John J. McCusker's article ''How much is that in real money'' (Processing American Antiquarian Society 2001 ISBN 1-929545-01-0) started from 1665<U+2014>40 years after the time, when the trade was settled. However, these numbers give the feeling of the price paid for Manhattan.</ref>

It is generally assumed that the [[Italy|Italian]] navigator [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] explored [[New York Harbor]] in 1524<ref name=SciAm/> and that a few months later the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Esteban G<U+00F3>mez]] did the same.<ref>Sullivan, Dr. James. [http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk1/ch3/pt1.html "The History of New York State:  Book I, Chapter III"], USGenNet, accessed [[May 1]], [[2007]]. "There is satisfactory evidence that Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed into the outer harbor of New York in 1524. Esteban Gomez visited it a year later."</ref> However, there is no evidence of any exploration, latitude calculations, surveying or mapping. There is only a vague textual description of having seen an estuary that may perhaps resemble Hudson<U+2019>s river. None of those navigators from other nations had penetrated well into the bay or explored the chief river substantiated with textual and visual evidence until the Dutch did so in 1609. 

New Netherland was settled first in 1624 when thirty families disembarked from the ship New Netherland under the command of Cornelis Jacobsz May, New Netherland<U+2019>s first director, and settled on [[Governors Island]]. Peter Minuit was among them as volunteer. Their arrival transformed New Netherland into a province of the Dutch Republic from, previously, a territory for exploration and private trade since its discovery by the [Dutch] East India Company in 1609. Some of the settlers were spread around the territory in order to take physical and legal possession according to the Law of Nations. On this basis, the year 1624 has been recognized by the [[New York Legislature]] as the birth date of New York State.<ref name=Tolerance>[http://tolerancepark.org/_wsn/page5.html Tolerance Park HISTORIC NEW AMSTERDAM on Governors Island], Tolerance Park. Accessed [[May 12]], [[2007]]. See Legislative Resolutions Senate No. 5476 and Assembly No. 2708.</ref>

The States General (parliament) of the Dutch Republic had promised a trade monopoly for anyone who first would create and deliver a map based on private explorations and surveys for the territory situated between 40 and 45 degrees latitude. It was Adriaen Block and his partner Hendrick Christaensz who, based on four voyages, delivered a map in October 1614 to the States General on which they named the territory New Netherland. As a result, various trading companies amalgamated into the [[New Netherland Company]] in 1614, which was the recipient of a private trade monopoly with the natives. 

In 1625, the second director of New Netherland, Willem Verhulst, together with his Council, selected Manhattan Island as the place for the construction of a Fort Amsterdam, a citadel for the protection of the new arrivals. Land surveyor and civil engineer Cryn Fredericxsz van Lobbrecht arrived in June 1625 to lay out Fort Amsterdam at Manhattan<U+2019>s tip. The citadel's original design called for it being open at the waterside on the west as per instructions of [[April 25]], [[1625]], to civil engineer Cryn Fredericxsz, director Verhulst and his council. The year 1625 is therefore recognized as the birth date of New York City.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/features/greenbook_seal_flag.shtml City Seal and Flag], [[New York City]], accessed [[May 13]], [[2007]]. "Date: Beneath the horizontal laurel branch the date 1625, being the year of the establishment of New Amsterdam."</ref>

In 1664, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] had resolved to annex New Netherland and consolidate it with his North American possessions in order <U+201C>to install one form of government, both in church and state <U+2026> to install the Anglican government as in Old England<U+201D>. He sent an expeditionary force composed of New Englanders and <U+201C>reinforced by four royal ships crammed full with an extraordinary amount of men and warlike stores<U+201D> and demanded New Netherland<U+2019>s surrender. Director General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] and his council negotiated 24 articles of provisional transfer, which gave New Netherlanders liberties and freedoms unlike those available to [[New England]]ers and [[Virginia]]ns.<ref>[http://tolerancepark.org/_wsn/page2.html Tolerance Park HISTORIC NEW AMSTERDAM on Governors Island], Tolerance Park, accessed [[April 26]], [[2007]].</ref> New York County was named in honor of the Royal Majesty of Great Britain, the [[Duke of York]], later to become the Catholic [[James II of England]], after whom the City and State of New York were also named.<ref>[http://www.dos.state.ny.us/kidsroom/nysfacts/counties.html The Origins of New York State's County Names], accessed [[April 27]], [[2007]]. "NEW YORK in honor of the Duke of York.</ref>

Consequently, the negotiations assured that the legal and political tradition of tolerance as the basis of cultural diversity and pluralism since 1624 was perpetuated by the Articles of Transfer under English authority. Thus safeguarded, the notion of tolerance endured after conclusive jurisdictional establishment of English dominion over New Netherland in 1674, and through the formation of the United States of America, when it was reintroduced as a constitutional right under the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791. In 1691, however, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic religion]] was outlawed in New York by an act of parliament. This ban technically remained in effect until the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783.

From [[January 11]], [[1785]] to Autumn 1788, New York City was the fifth of five capitals under the [[Articles of Confederation]], with the [[Continental Congress]] residing at [[New York City Hall]] then at [[Fraunces Tavern]]. New York was the first capital of the country under the newly enacted [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] from [[March 4]], [[1789]] to [[August 12]], [[1790]] at [[Federal Hall]].<ref>[http://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_item/Nine_Capitals_of_the_United_States.htm The Nine Capitals of the United States].

New York City, surrounded by two brackish rivers, had a limited supply of fresh water available on the island, which dwindled as the city grew rapidly after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. To supply the needs of the growing population, the city acquired land in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and constructed the [[Croton Aqueduct]] system, which went into service in 1842. The system took water from a dam at the [[Croton River]], and sent it down through [[the Bronx]], over the [[Harlem River]] via the [[High Bridge (New York City)|High Bridge]], to storage reservoirs in [[Central Park]] and at [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]], and through a network of cast iron pipes on to consumer's faucets. In the early twentieth century, the existing water supply system was supplemented with much larger reservoirs in the [[Catskill Mountains]], connected to the city by a series of mammoth water tunnels.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/history.html New York City's Water Supply System: History], [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection]].

At the time of creation of New York County in 1683, its territory consisted of Manhattan Island, and occupied the same area that it occupies today. In 1874, the western portion of the present [[The Bronx|Bronx County]] was transferred to New York County, and in 1895 the remainder of the present Bronx County was transferred to New York County.<ref>Macy Jr., Harry.

"In 1683, when the Province of New York was first divided into counties, the City of New York also became New York County <U+2026> In 1874, to accommodate this growth, New York City and County annexed from Westchester County what is now the western Bronx <U+2026> In 1895 New York City annexed the eastern Bronx."</ref> In 1898, when the [[City of Greater New York]] was constituted as five boroughs, the separate boroughs of Manhattan and of the Bronx were formed, though both remained within the single County of New York. On [[January 1]], [[1914]], legislation tool effect taking those parts of the then New York County which had been annexed from [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] as the new Bronx County, and New York County was reduced to its present boundaries.<ref>Hermalyn, Gary and Ultan, Lloyd.

From the latter half of the 1960s through most of the 1970s, Manhattan suffered from [[Urban Exodus|urban flight]] as much of the middle-class fled to the suburbs due to an increase in crime. However, as with many other American cities, there was an increase in population growth in the latter part of the century due to a renewed interest in the urban lifestyle, a trend that began in the late 1980s and has continued to present day. It was thought that the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] would initiate a new exodus from the City due to a fear of [[terrorism]], but this has not occurred.

Marble Hill is one example of how Manhattan's land has been considerably altered by human intervention. The borough has seen substantial [[land reclamation]] along its waterfronts since Dutch colonial times. Reclamation is most notable in [[Lower Manhattan]] with modern developments such as [[Battery Park City]], created from land excavated during the construction of the [[World Trade Center]]. Much of the natural variations in topography have been evened out. 

[[Image:Grid 1811.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A modern redrawing of the 1807 version of the Commissioner's Grid plan for Manhattan, a few years before it was adopted in 1811.]]
Manhattan is loosely divided into [[Lower Manhattan|downtown]], [[Midtown Manhattan|midtown]], and [[Upper Manhattan|uptown]] regions, with [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] demarcating Manhattan's east and west sides.

Manhattan is connected by a bridge and tunnels to [[New Jersey]] to the west, and to three New York City boroughs<U+2014>[[the Bronx]] to the northeast and [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]] on [[Long Island]] to the east and south. Its only direct connection with the fifth New York City borough is the [[Staten Island Ferry]] across [[New York Harbor]], which is free of charge. The ferry terminal is located at [[Battery Park (New York)|Battery Park]] at its southern tip. It is possible to travel to Staten Island via Brooklyn, using one of Brooklyn's bridges, the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]].

The [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]], called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south roughly parallel to the shore of the [[Hudson River]], each 100 feet wide (30 m), with [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]] on the east side and [[Twelfth Avenue (Manhattan)|Twelfth Avenue]] in the west.

==Government==
{{main|Government of New York City}}
[[Image:Manhattan Municipal Building by David Shankbone edited-1.jpg|thumb|[[Manhattan Municipal Building]]]]
Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, Manhattan has been governed by the New York City Charter, which has provided for a "strong" [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council system]] since its revision in 1989.<ref>[http://www.abcny.org/pdf/Report%20on%20Ballot%20Proposals.pdf "Report on Ballot Proposals of the 2003 New York City Charter Revision Commission"] [[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]]. Accessed [[May 11]], [[2007]]. "Unlike most cities that employ nonpartisan election systems, New York City has a very strong mayor system and, following the 1989 Charter Amendments, an increasingly powerful City Council."</ref> The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Manhattan.

The office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]], which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment's]] [[Equal Protection Clause]] pursuant to the high court's 1964 "one man, one vote" decision.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0489_0688_ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection: Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris], [[Cornell Law School]]. Accessed [[June 12]], [[2006]].</ref>

Since 1990, the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Manhattan's [[Borough President]] is [[Scott Stringer]], elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.mbpo.org/about Manhattan Borough President Scott M. Stringer], Manhattan Borough President's Office. Accessed [[April 27]], [[2007]]. "Scott M. Stringer was sworn in as Manhattan<U+2019>s 26th Borough President in January of 2006<U+2026>"</ref>

Each of the city's five counties (coterminous with each borough) has its own criminal court system and [[District Attorney]], the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. [[Robert M. Morgenthau]], a Democrat, has been the District Attorney of New York County since 1974.<ref>[http://www.manhattanda.org/history/biography.htm Biography of Robert M. Morgenthau], New York County District Attorney's Office. Accessed [[April 27]], [[2007]]. "He returned to private life until 1974, when he made the first of eight successful bids for election as District Attorney of New York County."</ref> Manhattan has ten City Council members, the third largest contingent among the five boroughs. It also has 12 administrative districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for local residents.
As the host of the [[United Nations]], the borough is home to the world's largest international [[Consul (representative)|consular corps]], comprising 105 consulates, consulates general and honorary consulates.<ref>[http://www.consulsnewyork.com/about.htm Society of Foreign Consuls: About us]. Accessed [[July 19]], [[2006]].</ref> It is also the home of [[New York City Hall]], the seat of New York City government housing the [[Mayor of New York City]] and the [[New York City Council]]. The mayor's staff and thirteen municipal agencies are located in the nearby [[Manhattan Municipal Building]], completed in 1916, one of the largest governmental buildings in the world.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/agencyinfo/municipal_building.shtml The Municipal Building], [[New York City]].

Starting in the mid-19th Century, the United States became a magnet for immigrants seeking to escape poverty in their home countries. After arriving in New York, many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the [[slum]]s of the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] neighborhood, an area between [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] and the [[Bowery, Manhattan|Bowery]], northeast of [[New York City Hall]]. By the 1820s, the area was home to many [[gambling]] dens and [[Brothel|"houses of ill repute"]], and was known as a dangerous place to go to.

Lower Manhattan (Manhattan south of [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston Street]]) has a sharply different population than the rest of the borough. According to the 2000 census, the neighborhood was 41% Asian, 32% non-Hispanic white, 19% Hispanic and 6% black. 43% of residents were immigrants. These figures are affected by the demographic weight of Chinatown, which accounts for 55% of the population of Lower Manhattan. While the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] had few non-commercial residents after the 1950s, the area has seen a significant surge in its residential population, with estimates showing over 30,000 residents living in the area as of 2005, a jump from the 15,000 to 20,000 before the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref>Steinhauer, Jennifer.

Manhattan is a religiously diverse community. The largest religious affiliation is the [[Roman Catholic Church]], whose adherents constitute 564,505 persons (more than 36% of the population) and maintain 110 congregations. [[American Jews|Jews]] comprise the second largest religious group, with 314,500 persons (20.5%) and have 102 congregations.

The borough is also experiencing a baby boom that is unique among American cities; since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan grew by more than 32%. The growth is largely driven by the children of affluent white families. Manhattan<U+2019>s 35,000 or so white non-Hispanic toddlers are being raised by parents whose median income was $284,208 in 2005, which means they are growing up in wealthier households than similar youngsters in any other large county in the country. Among white families with toddlers, San Francisco ranked second, with a median income of $150,763, followed by Somerset, N.J. ($136,807); San Jose, Calif. ($134,668); Fairfield, Conn.

==Economy==
[[Image:6thAvenuefrom49th.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Skyscrapers along Sixth Avenue.]]
Manhattan is the economic engine of New York City. Its most important economic sector is the finance industry. The 280,000 workers in the finance industry collect more than half of all the wages paid in Manhattan, although they hold fewer than one of every six jobs in the borough. The pay gap between them and the 1.5 million other workers in Manhattan continues to widen, causing some economists to worry about New York City's growing dependence on their extraordinary incomes. Those high salaries contribute to job growth, but most of this job growth occurs in lower-paying service jobs in restaurants, retail and home health care and not many jobs in highly paid areas.<ref>McGeehan, Patrick.

In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest among the 325 largest counties in the United States. The national average was $784.<ref name=ManhattanLabor>[http://www.bls.gov/ro2/fax/qcew9310.pdf Average Weekly Wage in Manhattan at $1,453 in Second Quarter 2006], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], [[United States Department of Labor]], [[February 20]], [[2007]].Acessed [[February 21]], [[2007]].</ref> Wages in Manhattan were also the fastest growing among the nation's 10 largest counties.<ref name=ManhattanLabor />

==Culture==
Manhattan has been the scene of many important American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched on [[Washington Square Park]] to commemorate the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]], which killed 146 workers on [[March 25]], [[1911]]. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of female independence, reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements.<ref>[http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/ The Triangle Factory Fire], [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]], accessed [[April 25]], [[2007]].</ref>
[[Image:Times Square (Tall).jpg|thumb|[[Times Square]] is the center of the city's theater district.]]
The [[Harlem Renaissance]] in the 1920s established the African-American literary canon in the United States. Manhattan's vibrant visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American [[pop art]] movement, which gave birth to such giants as [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Perhaps no other artist is as associated with the downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s as [[Andy Warhol]], who socialized at clubs like [[Serendipity 3]] and [[Studio 54]] and was shot in the chest in 1968 by the radical feminist [[Valerie Solanas]], founder of the group "Society for Cutting Up Men" (S.C.U.M.) and author of the [[SCUM Manifesto]].

A popular haven for art, the downtown neighborhood of [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] is widely known for its galleries and cultural events.

[[Broadway theatre]] is often considered the highest professional form of theatre in the United States. [[Play]]s and [[musical theater|musicals]] are staged in one of the thirty-nine larger professional theatres, all but one located in Midtown Manhattan in and around Times Square, with 500 seats or more, that appeal to the mass audience.  Broadway theatres are usually run by a producing organization or another theatre group. A little more than a mile from Times Square is the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], home to one of the world's most prestigious opera houses, that of the [[Metropolitan Opera]].

Manhattan is also home to some of the most extensive art collections, both contemporary and historical, in the world including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], and the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]].

The borough has a place in several American [[idiom]]s. The phrase ''"[[New York minute (time)|a New York minute]]"'' is meant to convey a very short period of time, sometimes in hyperbolic form, as in "perhaps faster than you would believe is possible". It refers to the rapid pace of life in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web | author =|title = New York Minute| work = [[Dictionary of American Regional English]] |date = [[1984-01-01]]| url = http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-new1.htm| accessdate = 2006-09-05}}</ref> The term "[[melting pot]]" was first popularly coined to describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the [[Lower East Side]] in [[Israel Zangwill]]'s play ''[[The Melting Pot]]'', which was an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' set by Zangwill in New York City in 1908.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/fmc/timeline/emeltpot.htm "The Melting Pot"], ''The First Measured Century'', [[Public Broadcasting Service]].

In the early twentieth century, men would hang out on the corner here on Twenty-third Street and watch the wind blowing women's dresses up so that they could catch a little bit of ankle. This entered into popular culture and there are hundreds of postcards and illustrations of women with their dresses blowing up in front of the Flatiron Building.

===Sports===
Today, Manhattan is home of the [[NBA]]'s [[New York Knicks]] and [[NHL]]'s [[New York Rangers]], who play their home games at [[Madison Square Garden]], the only major professional sports arena in the borough.  The [[New York Jets]] proposed a [[West Side Stadium]] for their home field, but the proposal was eventually defeated in June 2005, leaving them at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]].

Central Park is bordered on the north by West [[110th Street (Manhattan)|110th Street]], on the west by [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]], on the south by West [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]], and on the east by [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]]. Along the park's borders, these streets are usually referred to as [[Central Park North]], [[Central Park West]], and [[Central Park South]], respectively. (Fifth Avenue retains its name along the eastern border.) The park was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]]. The park offers extensive [[walking track]]s, two [[ice-skating]] rinks, a wildlife sanctuary, and grassy areas used for various sporting pursuits, as well as [[playground]]s for children. The park is a popular oasis for migrating birds, and thus is popular with [[bird watcher]]s. The 6-mile (10 km) road circling the park is popular with joggers, bicyclists and inline skaters, especially on weekends and in the evenings after 7:00 p.m., when automobile traffic is banned.<ref>[http://www.centralpark.com/pages/general-info.html Central Park General Information], Central Park Conservancy.

While much of the park looks natural, it is in fact almost entirely landscaped and contains several artificial lakes. The construction of Central Park in the 1850s was one of the era's most massive public works projects. Some 20,000 workers crafted the topography to create the English-style pastoral landscape Olmsted and Vaux sought to create. Workers moved nearly 3 million cubic yards of soil and planted more than 270,000 trees and shrubs.<ref>[http://www.centralpark.com/pages/history_2.html Central Park History], Central Park Conservancy.

In the early days of Manhattan, wood construction and poor access to water supplies left the city vulnerable to fires.
