==Early life and career==
Xu Sheng was a native of Ju (<U+8392>), Langya (<U+7405><U+90AA>) [[Commandery (China)|commandery]], which is in present-day [[Ju County]], [[Rizhao]], [[Shandong]].<ref>(<U+5F90><U+76DB><U+5B57><U+6587><U+56AE><U+FF0C><U+7405><U+90AA><U+8392><U+4EBA><U+4E5F><U+3002>) Chen Shou. ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', Volume 55, Biography of Xu Sheng.</ref> When chaos broke out in central and northern China towards the [[end of the Han Dynasty]], Xu Sheng moved from his hometown to Wu commandery (<U+5433>; capital in present-day [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]) in southern China, where he gained a reputation for his bravery. He was later recruited by the warlord [[Sun Quan]], who controlled much of the territories in [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] at that time. Sun Quan appointed Xu Sheng as a "Major of Separate Command" (<U+5225><U+90E8><U+53F8><U+99AC>), placed him in command of 500 troops, and sent him to defend Chaisang (<U+67F4><U+6851>; southwest of present-day [[Jiujiang]], [[Jiangxi]]) from [[Huang Zu]], the Administrator of Jiangxia commandery (<U+6C5F><U+590F><U+90E1>; capital in present-day [[Yunmeng County]], [[Xiaogan]], [[Hubei]]).<ref>(<U+906D><U+4E82><U+FF0C><U+5BA2><U+5C45><U+5433><U+FF0C><U+4EE5><U+52C7><U+6C23><U+805E><U+3002><U+5B6B><U+6B0A><U+7D71><U+4E8B><U+FF0C><U+4EE5><U+70BA><U+5225><U+90E8><U+53F8><U+99AC><U+FF0C><U+6388><U+5175><U+4E94><U+767E><U+4EBA><U+FF0C><U+5B88><U+67F4><U+6851><U+9577><U+FF0C><U+62D2><U+9EC3><U+7956><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

Huang Zu once sent his son Huang She (<U+9EC3><U+5C04>) to lead a few thousand troops to attack Chaisang. At that time, Xu Sheng had less than 200 men with him, so they fired arrows at Huang She's advancing forces and wounded over 1,000 enemy soldiers. Xu Sheng then ordered the city gates to be opened and they charged out and defeated the enemy. Huang She no longer posed a threat to Xu Sheng after that battle.<ref>(<U+7956><U+5B50><U+5C04><U+FF0C><U+751E><U+7387><U+6578><U+5343><U+4EBA><U+4E0B><U+653B><U+76DB><U+3002><U+76DB><U+6642><U+540F><U+58EB><U+4E0D><U+6EFF><U+4E8C><U+767E><U+FF0C><U+8207><U+76F8><U+62D2><U+64CA><U+FF0C><U+50B7><U+5C04><U+540F><U+58EB><U+5343><U+9918><U+4EBA><U+3002><U+5DF2><U+4E43><U+958B><U+9580><U+51FA><U+6230><U+FF0C><U+5927><U+7834><U+4E4B><U+3002><U+5C04><U+9042><U+7D55><U+8FF9><U+4E0D><U+5FA9><U+70BA><U+5BC7><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

==Wars with Cao Cao and Liu Bei==
{{main|Battle of Ruxukou (213)|Battle of Xiaoyao Ford|Battle of Xiaoting}}

In 213, when [[Sun Quan]]'s rival [[Cao Cao]] led an army to attack Ruxu (<U+6FE1><U+9808>; north of present-day [[Wuwei County]], [[Wuhu]], [[Anhui]]), Xu Sheng accompanied Sun Quan to the battlefront to resist the enemy, leading to the [[Battle of Ruxukou (213)|Battle of Ruxu]]. Cao Cao launched a heavy assault on Hengjiang (<U+6A6B><U+6C5F>; southeast of present-day [[He County]], Anhui, on the northern shore of the [[Chang River]]), so Xu Sheng and Sun Quan's other generals led their forces to defend that position. Due to strong winds, their [[mengchong]]s (a type of warship) were blown across the river towards Cao Cao's side. Sun Quan's generals were all terrified and did not dare to land on the enemy's grounds. However, Xu Sheng led his men on a charge towards the enemy, and succeeded in felling a few, driving the rest back. When the winds stopped, Sun Quan's forces returned to their side and Xu Sheng received high praise from his lord.<ref>(<U+66F9><U+516C><U+51FA><U+6FE1><U+9808><U+FF0C><U+5F9E><U+6B0A><U+79A6><U+4E4B><U+3002><U+9B4F><U+751E><U+5927><U+51FA><U+6A6B><U+6C5F><U+FF0C><U+76DB><U+8207><U+8AF8><U+5C07><U+4FF1><U+8D74><U+8A0E><U+3002><U+6642><U+4E58><U+8499><U+885D><U+FF0C><U+9047><U+8FC5><U+98A8><U+FF0C><U+8239><U+843D><U+6575><U+5CB8><U+4E0B><U+FF0C><U+8AF8><U+5C07><U+6050><U+61FC><U+FF0C><U+672A><U+6709><U+51FA><U+8005><U+FF0C><U+76DB><U+7368><U+5C07><U+5175><U+FF0C><U+4E0A><U+7A81><U+65AB><U+6575><U+FF0C><U+6575><U+62AB><U+9000><U+8D70><U+FF0C><U+6709><U+6240><U+50B7><U+6BBA><U+FF0C><U+98A8><U+6B62><U+4FBF><U+9084><U+FF0C><U+6B0A><U+5927><U+58EF><U+4E4B><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

In 214-215, [[Sun Quan]] led his armies to attack [[Hefei]], a strategic fortress defended by Cao Cao's general [[Zhang Liao]], leading to the [[Battle of Xiaoyao Ford]]. During an early skirmish, when Sun Quan's forces were just setting up their camps outside Hefei, Zhang Liao suddenly led hundreds of troops on a fierce assault, completely catching the enemy off guard. Xu Sheng was defeated and his men fled, but were coerced into returning to battle after two deserters (one from Xu Sheng's unit and the other from [[Song Qian]]'s) were executed by [[Pan Zhang]].<ref>(<U+5408><U+80A5><U+4E4B><U+5F79><U+FF0C><U+5F35><U+907C><U+5944><U+81F3><U+FF0C><U+8AF8><U+5C07><U+4E0D><U+5099><U+FF0C><U+9673><U+6B66><U+9B2C><U+6B7B><U+FF0C><U+5B8B><U+8B19><U+3001><U+5F90><U+76DB><U+7686><U+62AB><U+8D70><U+FF0C><U+748B><U+8EAB><U+6B21><U+5728><U+5F8C><U+FF0C><U+4FBF><U+99B3><U+9032><U+FF0C><U+6A6B><U+99AC><U+65AC><U+8B19><U+3001><U+76DB><U+5175><U+8D70><U+8005><U+4E8C><U+4EBA><U+FF0C><U+5175><U+7686><U+9084><U+6230><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

==War with Wei, and death==
{{main|Battle of Dongkou|Incident at Guangling}}

In late 222, [[Cao Pi]] ordered his general [[Cao Xiu]] to lead the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] armies to attack Dongkou (<U+6D1E><U+53E3>; present-day [[Dongkou County]], [[Hunan]]). In response to the invasion, Xu Sheng, along with [[L<U+00FC> Fan]] and [[Quan Cong]] led [[Sun Quan]]'s forces across the river to defend Dongkou. However, they encountered a storm and many of their troops and ships were lost. Sun Quan's generals were browbeaten because they had lost about half of their ships in the storm, but were overjoyed when they heard of the arrival of [[He Qi]], who actually reached Dongkou behind schedule and was not affected by the disaster. Coincidentally, He Qi was obsessed with luxuries so his ships were finely decorated and his weapons were of top quality. Cao Xiu was shocked when he witnessed the grandeur display of He Qi's refulgent navy so he paused the attack and withdrew. Xu Sheng managed to gather his surviving troops and form a defence line along the shore. A naval battle ensued, during which Cao Xiu targeted L<U+00FC> Fan while sending his subordinates to attack Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng was outnumbered but he managed to hold his position. Both sides eventually withdrew their forces.<ref>(<U+66F9><U+4F11><U+51FA><U+6D1E><U+53E3><U+FF0C><U+76DB><U+8207><U+5442><U+7BC4><U+3001><U+5168><U+742E><U+6E21><U+6C5F><U+62D2><U+5B88><U+3002><U+906D><U+5927><U+98A8><U+FF0C><U+8239><U+4EBA><U+591A><U+55AA><U+FF0C><U+76DB><U+6536><U+9918><U+5175><U+FF0C><U+8207><U+4F11><U+593E><U+6C5F><U+3002><U+4F11><U+4F7F><U+5175><U+5C07><U+5C31><U+8239><U+653B><U+76DB><U+FF0C><U+76DB><U+4EE5><U+5C11><U+79A6><U+591A><U+FF0C><U+6575><U+4E0D><U+80FD><U+514B><U+FF0C><U+5404><U+5F15><U+8ECD><U+9000><U+3002><U+9077><U+5B89><U+6771><U+5C07><U+8ECD><U+FF0C><U+5C01><U+856A><U+6E56><U+4FAF><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

In late 224, when [[Cao Pi]] mobilised a large army to attack [[Sun Quan]], Xu Sheng suggested to pitch encampments from Jianye (<U+5EFA><U+696D>; the capital of Sun Quan's domain, in present-day [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu]]), erect fake towers within each camp, and suspend some warships on the river. Sun Quan's other generals disagreed and felt that such "defences" would serve no purpose, but Xu Sheng ignored them and proceeded with his plan.

Xu Sheng's ruse effectively led to the construction of a "wall" along the river banks that served as a border stretching over hundreds of ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''. When Cao Pi reached Guangling [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] (<U+5EE3><U+9675><U+90E1>; covering parts of present-day [[Jiangsu]]), he saw Sun Quan's "strong defences" and the high tide and sighed, "[[Cao Wei|Wei]] has thousands of armed cavalry units but they cannot be deployed here".<ref>(<U+9B4F><U+6C0F><U+6625><U+79CB><U+4E91><U+FF1A><U+6587><U+5E1D><U+6B4E><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+9B4F><U+96D6><U+6709><U+6B66><U+9A0E><U+5343><U+7FA3><U+FF0C><U+7121><U+6240><U+7528><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+300D>) Annotations from the ''Wei Shi Chunqiu'' (<U+9B4F><U+6C0F><U+6625><U+79CB>) to Chen Shou's ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', Volume 55, Biography of Xu Sheng.</ref> He then withdrew his forces.

Xu Sheng died sometime during the Huangwu era (222-229) in the reign of [[Sun Quan]], before the latter declared himself "Emperor of [[Eastern Wu]]". His militia and marquis title were inherited by his son, Xu Kai (<U+5F90><U+6977>).<ref>(<U+9EC3><U+6B66><U+4E2D><U+5352><U+3002><U+5B50><U+6977><U+FF0C><U+8972><U+7235><U+9818><U+5175><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

==Appraisal==
Xu Sheng was known for his confidence and fervent loyalty towards [[Sun Quan]], as demonstrated in the incident when Xing Zhen (<U+90A2><U+8C9E>) came to confer the title of "King of Wu" (<U+5433><U+738B>) on Sun Quan. In 220, Sun Quan became a [[vassal]] of the state of [[Cao Wei]], which replaced the [[Han Dynasty]] after the Wei founder, Cao Pi, forced [[Emperor Xian of Han]] to abdicate the throne to him. Cao Pi sent Xing Zhen as an emissary to meet Sun Quan and confer the title of "King of Wu" (<U+5433><U+738B>) on the latter. Xing Zhen behaved arrogantly in front of Sun Quan, which incurred much anger from Sun's subjects, including [[Zhang Zhao]] and Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng told his colleagues, "Isn't it humiliating to watch our lord submit to Xing Zhen and not be able to serve him with our lives and help him conquer Xuchang, Luoyang and Bashu?" Tears rolled down his face. When Xing Zhen heard Xu Sheng's remark, he told an aide, "It's obvious from the reactions of the subjects of Jiangdong that they will not remain subservient for long."<ref>(<U+53CA><U+6B0A><U+70BA><U+9B4F><U+7A31><U+85E9><U+FF0C><U+9B4F><U+4F7F><U+90A2><U+8C9E><U+62DC><U+6B0A><U+70BA><U+5433><U+738B><U+3002><U+6B0A><U+51FA><U+90FD><U+4EAD><U+5019><U+8C9E><U+FF0C><U+8C9E><U+6709><U+9A55><U+8272><U+FF0C><U+5F35><U+662D><U+65E3><U+6012><U+FF0C><U+800C><U+76DB><U+5FFF><U+61A4><U+FF0C><U+9867><U+8B02><U+540C><U+5217><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+76DB><U+7B49><U+4E0D><U+80FD><U+596E><U+8EAB><U+51FA><U+547D><U+FF0C><U+70BA><U+570B><U+5BB6><U+5E76><U+8A31><U+6D1B><U+FF0C><U+541E><U+5DF4><U+8700><U+FF0C><U+800C><U+4EE4><U+543E><U+541B><U+8207><U+8C9E><U+76DF><U+FF0C><U+4E0D><U+4EA6><U+8FB1><U+4E4E><U+FF01><U+300D><U+56E0><U+6D95><U+6CE3><U+6A6B><U+6D41><U+3002><U+8C9E><U+805E><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+8B02><U+5176><U+65C5><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+6C5F><U+6771><U+5C07><U+76F8><U+5982><U+6B64><U+FF0C><U+975E><U+4E46><U+4E0B><U+4EBA><U+8005><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+300D>) Chen Shou. ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', Volume 55, Biography of Xu Sheng.</ref> Xing Zhen was right, because in 222, Sun Quan declared independence from Wei but continued ruling his domain under the title "King of Wu" before proclaiming himself "Emperor of [[Eastern Wu]]" in 229.

Xu Sheng's self-ego did not always lead to positive actions though. After the [[Battle of Ruxukou (217)|Battle of Ruxu]] in 217, [[Zhou Tai]] was appointed as the commander of the garrison at Ruxu, with Xu Sheng and [[Zhu Ran]] as his subordinates. However, both of them were unwilling to submit to Zhou Tai's command, citing the latter's humble origins in comparison to their more affluent family backgrounds. When Sun Quan heard about it, he made a personal trip to Ruxu and hosted a party for all the officers there, during which he asked Zhou Tai to display his battle scars for all to see. He later awarded Zhou with an imperial parasol. After that incident, Xu Sheng and Zhu Ran agreed to submit to Zhou Tai's command.<ref>(<U+66F9><U+516C><U+51FA><U+6FE1><U+9808><U+FF0C><U+6CF0><U+5FA9><U+8D74><U+64CA><U+FF0C><U+66F9><U+516C><U+9000><U+FF0C><U+7559><U+7763><U+6FE1><U+9808><U+FF0C><U+62DC><U+5E73><U+865C><U+5C07><U+8ECD><U+3002><U+6642><U+6731><U+7136><U+3001><U+5F90><U+76DB><U+7B49><U+7686><U+5728><U+6240><U+90E8><U+FF0C><U+4E26><U+4E0D><U+4F0F><U+4E5F><U+FF0C> ... <U+65BC><U+662F><U+76DB><U+7B49><U+4E43><U+4F0F><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

Xu Sheng was also known for his tendency to worry too much. When he was serving as the Prefect of Wuhu, he arrested one of [[Jiang Qin]]'s subordinates and sought permission from Sun Quan to have that man executed. However, Sun Quan declined because Jiang Qin was away battling bandits in Yuzhang (<U+8C6B><U+7AE0>). Since then, Xu Sheng had been apprehensive of Jiang Qin. During the Battle of Ruxu in 217, Jiang Qin and [[L<U+00FC> Meng]] were placed in charge of military discipline among Sun Quan's forces. Xu Sheng was worried that Jiang Qin might use the opportunity to find fault with him, but much to his surprise, Jiang praised him in front of Sun Quan.<ref>(<U+521D><U+FF0C><U+6B3D><U+5C6F><U+5BA3><U+57CE><U+FF0C><U+751E><U+8A0E><U+8C6B><U+7AE0><U+8CCA><U+3002><U+856A><U+6E56><U+4EE4><U+5F90><U+76DB><U+6536><U+6B3D><U+5C6F><U+540F><U+FF0C><U+8868><U+65AC><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+6B0A><U+4EE5><U+6B3D><U+5728><U+9060><U+4E0D><U+8A31><U+FF0C><U+76DB><U+7531><U+662F><U+81EA><U+5ACC><U+65BC><U+6B3D><U+3002><U+66F9><U+516C><U+51FA><U+6FE1><U+9808><U+FF0C><U+6B3D><U+8207><U+5442><U+8499><U+6301><U+8AF8><U+8ECD><U+7BC0><U+5EA6><U+3002><U+76DB><U+5E38><U+754F><U+6B3D><U+56E0><U+4E8B><U+5BB3><U+5DF1><U+FF0C><U+800C><U+6B3D><U+6BCF><U+7A31><U+5176><U+5584><U+3002><U+76DB><U+65E3><U+670D><U+5FB7><U+FF0C><U+8AD6><U+8005><U+7F8E><U+7109><U+3002>) Chen Shou.
