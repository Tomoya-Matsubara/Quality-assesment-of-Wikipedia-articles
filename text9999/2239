'''HMCS ''Belleville''''' was a modified [[Flower class corvette|Flower-class corvette]] that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. She fought primarily in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] as a convoy escort. She was named for [[Belleville, Ontario]]. After the war she was sold to the [[Dominican Navy]] and served with them until 1972.

==Background==
{{main|Flower class corvette}}
Flower-class corvettes like ''Belleville'' serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different to earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ossian |first=Robert |url=http://www.thepirateking.com/ships/ship_types.htm |title=Complete List of Sailing Vessels |website=The Pirate King |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Fitzsimons |editor-first=Bernard |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons & Warfare |location=London |publisher=Phoebus |date=1978 |volume=11 |pages=1137<U+2013>1142 |isbn=}}</ref><ref name=Jane>{{cite book |title=Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II |location=New Jersey |publisher=Random House |date=1996 |isbn=0-517-67963-9 |page=68}}</ref>  The "corvette" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877.<ref>{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Nicholas |last2=Lawrence |first2=Richard |title=The Illustrated Companion to Nelson's Navy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I59v6rkg8egC&pg=PA39 |publisher=Stackpole Books |date=2005 |pages=39-63 |isbn=0-8117-3275-4}}</ref> During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, [[Winston Churchill]] reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a [[whaling ship]] design.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chesneau |first=Roger |last2=Gardiner |first2=Robert |title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships (1922-1946) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bJBMBvyQ83EC&pg=PA62 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date=June 1980 |page=62 |isbn=0-87021-913-8}}</ref> The generic name "flower" was used to designate the class of these ships, which <U+2013> in the Royal Navy <U+2013> were named after flowering plants.<ref name=Milner>{{cite book |title=North Atlantic Run |last=Milner |first=Marc |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1985 |pages=117<U+2013>119, 142<U+2013>145, 158, 175<U+2013>176, 226, 235, 285<U+2013>291 |isbn=0-87021-450-0}}</ref>

Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral [[Percy W. Nelles]]. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.<ref name=Macpherson2>{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Milner |first2=Marc |year=1993 |title=Corvettes of the Royal Canadian Navy 1939-1945|publisher=Vanwell Publishing |location=St. Catharines |pages=|isbn=1-55125-052-7}}</ref>

==Construction==
''Belleville'' was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1943-44 Increased Endurance Flower-class building program, which followed the main layout of the 1942-43 program. The only significant difference is that the majority of the 43-44 program replaced the 2-pounder Mk.VIII single "pom-pom" [[anti-aircraft]] gun with 2 twin 20-mm and 2 single 20-mm anti-aircraft guns.<ref name=Macpherson2/> ''Belleville'' was laid down by [[Kingston Shipbuilding|Kingston Shipbuilding Co.]] at [[Kingston, Ontario]] 21 January 1944 and launched 17 June later that year. She was commissioned into the RCN 19 October 1944 at Kingston.<ref name=uboat>{{cite web | url = http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/787.html | work = Uboat.net | title = HMCS ''Belleville''  (K 332) | accessdate = 28 September 2013|ref=Uboat.net}}</ref><ref name=Macpherson>{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910-1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages=100 |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}</ref>

==War service==
Before heading to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] for deployment, ''Belleville'' stopped at her namesake town. After arriving at Halifax she was sent to workup at [[Bermuda]] and required repairs upon her return. After they were completed she was assigned to the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]]. She was allocated to the escort group C-5 and escorted her first convoy at the end of March 1945. She spent the rest of the war with the group. She made her final return trip to Canada in June 1945.<ref name=Macpherson/>

==Post-war service==
''Belleville'' was [[paid off]] 5 July 1945 at [[Sorel, Quebec]] and laid up. She was transferred to the War Assets Corporation and sold to the Dominican Navy in 1947. She was renamed ''Juan Bautista Cambiaso'' and served with them until 1972 when she was sold for scrap.<ref name=Macpherson/>
