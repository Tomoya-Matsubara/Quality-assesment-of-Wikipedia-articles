'''Mike Leach''' (born [[March 9]], [[1961]] in [[Susanville, California]]) is the current [[head coach]] of the [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] [[American football|football]] [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|team]]. Leach has had a winning season every year since his tenure began at Tech. Former [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]] offensive coordinator [[Emory Bellard]] considers Leach the best offensive coach in the nation.<ref>http://www.capcitysportsreport.com/past/november/offensive_mastermind.pdf</ref>

==Early life==
Leach is a 1983 graduate of [[Brigham Young University]], with a B.S. in American Studies. He is atypical among [[NCAA]] [[Division I]] head football coaches, as he did not play football at the college level.  Leach is one of only five such coaches, with [[Mark Mangino]] of the [[University of Kansas]], [[Paul Johnson (American football coach)|Paul Johnson]] of the [[United States Naval Academy]], [[Dennis Franchione]] of [[Texas A&M University]], and [[Charlie Weis]] of the [[University of Notre Dame]]. In 1986 Leach earned a law degree from [[Pepperdine University]]. Leach is also one of the most prominent graduates of the [[United States Sports Academy]], from which he earned a Master's of Sports Science/Coaching in 1988.

==Coaching career==
Leach is known for building some very potent offenses, directing very prolific passing-oriented teams that have broken school and NCAA records at [[Valdosta State University]], [[University of Kentucky]], and [[University of Oklahoma]], where he was offensive coordinator, and [[Texas Tech]], where he became head coach in 2000. The Leach-coached Red Raiders' best finish came in 2002 and 2005, having 9-win seasons. In 2002, Tech swept its in-state conference rivals [[Baylor University|Baylor]], [[University of Texas|Texas]], and [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] first time since 1997 and defeated [[Clemson University|Clemson]] by 55-15 in the Tangerine Bowl. It was the Red Raiders' first postseason win since 1995 when they beated the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force]] Falcons in the Copper Bowl. In 2005, the Raiders opened their season 6-0, the best start since 1998, and defeated [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] first time under Leach's tenure.

Under Leach, the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Red Raiders]] have built a strong passing offense. It has led the NCAA in passing yardage for four years in a row. Leach might be more known for plugging new [[quarterback]]s into his spread/pass-oriented offense and having them reel off NCAA records. At Kentucky he tutored prospect [[Tim Couch]] into a No.1 [[NFL Draft]] Pick. At Oklahoma, [[Josh Heupel]] became an NFL draft pick following a year under Leach's tutelege. At Tech, he inserted [[Kliff Kingsburry]] for three years, who broke the NCAA records for completions in a career. Following Kingsburry, [[BJ Symons]] stepped in producing the most passing yards in a season in NCAA history. [[Sonny Cumbie]] jumped up leading the Red Raiders to an upset of nationally ranked California in the [[Holiday Bowl]]. [[Cody Hodges]] got called to duty, leading the NCAA in passing. Sophomore quarterback [[Graham Harrell]], the first non-senior starting QB since [[Kliff Kingsburry]], struggled early in the 2006 season. However, he showed steady improvement beginning with the game against [[Iowa State University|Iowa State]] and ended the season with a record-setting victory over the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]].

Under Mike Leach, Texas Tech has been known for its high-scoring offense and come-from-behind victories. A 70-35 win over heavily favored [[Texas Christian University]] in 2004 began with TCU leading 21-0 with 8 minutes remaining in the second quarter. Before Tech's scoring drives started, a TCU defensive back was caught mouthing into a TV camera, "They aren't going to score." Later in the season, Texas Tech beat [[University of Nebraska|Nebraska]], 70-10, forcing the Cornhuskers to give up more points in a single game than they had before in their 114-year history. In 2005, the Red Raiders were losing to [[Kansas State University|Kansas State]], 13-10, late in the second quarter but won the game 59-20. Also in 2005, Tech had a halftime lead of 14-10 over [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]]. By the end of the game, they increased the margin to 56-17. It was the Aggies' worst loss to the Red Raiders in the 64-year-old series.[[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/magazine/04coach.html?ei=5090&en=c9f46201dc95f91d&ex=1291352400&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all]] The 2006 season ended with the Insight Bowl where Tech overcame a 31-point deficit in the third quarter to defeat the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] 44-41 in overtime. The victory made history as the largest comeback in Division I-A bowl history.

During the 2005 game against Texas A&M, [[Fox Sports Net]] featured a segment that focused on Leach's odd affinity for [[pirate]]s.

Mike Leach was chosen to coach the South team during the 2007 inaugural [[North-South All-Star Classic|Inta Juice North-South All-Star Classic]] game.

Leach is 56-34 with the Red Raiders including 6-8 against the [[Texas Longhorns]] and the [[Texas A&M Aggies]], Tech's arch-rivals. He is the all-time winningest coach in postseason play in the Tech football history with 4-3 record.
