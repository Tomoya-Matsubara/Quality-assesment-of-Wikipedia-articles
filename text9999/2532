'''Homi Jehangir Bhabha''', [[Royal Society#Fellowship|FRS]] ([[October 30]] [[1909]] <U+2013> [[January 24]] [[1966]]) was an [[India]]n [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] of [[Parsi]]-[[Zoroastrianism|Zorastrian]] heritage who had a major role in the development of the Indian atomic energy program and is considered to be the father of India's nuclear program. Bhabha was born into a prominent family, through which he was related to [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]], [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], and [[Dorabji Tata|Dorab Tata]]. After receiving his early education at Bombay schools and at the [[Indian Institute of Science|Royal Institute of Science]], he attended [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] to pursue studies in mechanical engineering. After taking the mechanical engineering Tripos, he pursued studies under [[Paul Dirac]] to complete the Mathematics Tripos. Meanwhile, he worked at the Cavendish Laboratory while working towards his doctorate in theoretical physics under [[Ralph H. Fowler|R. H. Fowler]]. During this time, he embarked on groundbreaking research into the absorption of cosmic rays and electron shower production. Afterwards, he published a string of widely-accepted papers on his theories regarding cosmic ray showers. 

World War II broke out in September 1939 while Bhabha was vacationing in India. He chose to remain in India until the war ended. In the meantime, he accepted a position at the [[Indian Institute of Science]] in [[Bangalore]], headed by [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] [[C. V. Raman]]. He established the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the institute, and began to work on the theory of the movement of [[point particles]]. In 1945, he established the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in Bombay, and the [[Atomic Energy Commission of India]] three years later. In the 1950s, Bhabha represented India in International Atomic Energy Forums, and served as President of the [[United Nations]] Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] in 1955. He later served as the member of the [[Union Cabinet|Indian Cabinet]]'s Scientific Advisory Committee and set up the [[Indian National Committee for Space Research]] with [[Vikram Sarabhai]]. In January 1966, Bhabha died in a plane crash near [[Mont Blanc]], while heading to [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] to attend a meeting of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]'s Scientific Advisory Committee.

==Early life==
Bhabha was born in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] to Jehangir Hormaji Bhabha, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-educated [[barrister]], and Meherbai Framji Panday. Bhabha, at his birth, was directly linked to India's most prominent mercantile families. Through his mother, Bhabha was the great-grandson of [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit|Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]], a [[cotton mill|textiles]] entrepreneur noted for his philanthropic efforts,<ref name="Penneyp36">Penney, p36.</ref> and therefore distantly related by marriage to [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] through his second wife, [[Rattanbai Petit]], who was the elder Petit's granddaughter. Through his father, Bhabha was the grandson of Hormusji Bhabha, [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]], the Inspector-General of Education in [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], and the nephew of Meherbai Hormusji, who was married to [[Dorabji Tata|Dorab Tata]], the eldest son of [[Jamsetji Tata]].<ref name="VP">{{cite web|url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/bhabha/BHABHANEW.HTM|title=Homi Jehangir Bhabha|accessdate=2008-01-25|date=2006-04-25|last=Mahanti |first=Subodh|publisher=Vigyan Prasar}}</ref>

Bhabha received his early education at Bombay's Cathedral Grammar School, which became the [[Cathedral and John Connon School]] in 1922 after merging with the John Connon School, run by the city's Scottish Education Society. He entered [[Elphinstone College]] at age 15 after passing his [[Senior Cambridge|Senior Cambridge Examination]] with Honours. He then attended the [[Indian Institute of Science|Royal Institute of Science]] until 1927 before joining [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], the [[alma mater]] of his uncle Dorab Tata.<ref name="Penneyp36"/> His father and uncle Dorab planned for Bhabha to obtain an [[engineering]] degree from Cambridge and then return to India, where would join the [[Tata Steel|Tata Iron and Steel Company]] in [[Jamshedpur]]. However, during his studies, Bhabha felt more of an interest in the field of mathematics, instead of engineering. In 1928, Bhabha wrote to his father, informing him of his mixed feelings about his intended specialty: {{cquote|I seriously say to you that business or job as an engineer is not the thing for me. It is totally foreign to my nature and radically opposed to my temperament and opinions. Physics is my line. I know I shall do great things here. For, each man can do best and excel in only that thing of which he is passionately fond, in which he believes, as I do, that he has the ability to do it, that he is in fact born and destined to do it. My success will not depend on what A or B thinks of me. My success will be what I make of my work. Besides, India is not a land where science cannot be carried on. 

I am burning with a desire to do physics. I will and must do it sometime. It is my only ambition. I have no desire to be a 'successful' man or the head of a big firm. There are intelligent people who like that and let them do it. I hear you saying 'But you are not [[Socrates]] or [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'. No <U+2014> and that is what Berlioz's father said to Berlioz. He called him a useless musician when he was young <U+2014> [[Hector Berlioz]] who now accepted as one of the world's greatest geniuses and France's greatest musician. How can anybody else know at what time what one will do, if there is nothing to show. ... It is no use saying to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] 'You must be a scientist for it is great thing' when he did not care two hoots for science; or to Socrates 'Be an engineer; it is work of intelligent man'. It is not in the nature of things. I therefore earnestly implore you to let me do physics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Venkataraman |first=G. |title= Bhabha and His Magnificent Obsessions|year= 1994 |publisher= Universities Press (India) Limited |location=[[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]] |isbn=81-7371-007-4 | pages=p4}}</ref>}}

===Higher education and research at Cambridge===
Bhabha's father understood his son's predicament, and he agreed to finance his studies in mathematics provided that he obtain first class on his Mechanical Sciences [[Tripos]] exam. Bhabha took the Tripos exam in June 1930 and passed with first class.<ref name="Venkataramanp5">Venkataraman, p5.</ref> Afterwards, he embarked on his mathematical studies under [[Paul Dirac]], the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] who would later be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Erwin Schr<U+00F6>dinger]] in 1933 "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1933|accessdate=2008-01-26|date=|last= |first=|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}</ref> while working as a research student in [[theoretical physics]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]].<ref name="VP"/> At the time, the laboratory was the center of a number of scientific breakthroughs. [[James Chadwick]] had discovered the [[neutron]], [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] [[nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] [[lithium]] with high-energy protons, and [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] and [[Giuseppe Occhialini]] used [[cloud chamber]]s to demonstrate the production of [[lone pair|electron pair]]s and [[particle shower|showers]] by gamma radiation.<ref name="Penneyp39">Penney, p39.</ref> During the 1931<U+2013>1932 academic year, Bhabha was awarded the Salomons Studentship in Engineering. In 1932, he obtained first class on his [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]] and was awarded the [[W. W. Rouse Ball|Rouse Ball]] travelling studentship in mathematics. With the studentship, he worked with [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], [[Enrico Fermi]] in [[Rome]] and [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Hans Kramers]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].<ref name="VP"/>

==Work==
In January 1933, Bhabha published his first scientific paper, "Zur Absorption der H<U+00F6>henstrahlung" (translates to "The Absorption of Cosmic Radiation"), in the German [[academic journal]] entitled ''[[Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Physik]]'' (Journal of Physics). In the publication, Bhabha offered an explanation of the absorption features and electron shower production in cosmic rays.<ref name="Sreekantanp45">Sreekantan, p45.</ref> The paper helped him win the [[Isaac Newton]] Studentship in 1934, which he held for the next three years. The following year, he completed his [[doctorate|doctoral studies]] in theoretical physics under [[Ralph H. Fowler]].<ref name="Venkataramanp5"/><ref name="Sreekantanp43">Sreekantan, p43.</ref> During his studentship, he split his time working at Cambridge and with [[Niels Bohr]] in [[Copenhagen]]. In 1936, Bhabha collaborated with [[Walter Heitler]] to formulate a theory on cosmic ray showers. They conjectured that the showers were formed by the cascade production of gamma rays and positive and negative electron pairs. In this process, high energy electrons passing through matter would turn into high energy photons by means of the [[bremsstrahlung]] process. The photons then produced a positive and negative electron pair, which then led to additional production of photons. This process continued until the energy of the particles went below a critical value.<ref name="Sreekantanp45"/> 

In 1936, the two published a paper, "The Passage of Fast Electrons and the Theory of Cosmic Showers" in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society#Proceedings of the Royal Society A|Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A]]'', in which they used their theory to describe how primary cosmic rays from outer space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level. Bhabha and Heitler then made numerical estimates of the number of electrons in the cascade process at different altitudes for different electron initiation energies. The calculations agreed with the experimental observations of cosmic ray showers made by [[Bruno Rossi]] and [[Pierre Victor Auger]] a few years before.<ref name="Sreekantanp45"/> Bhabha later concluded that observations of the properties of such particles would lead to the straightforward experimental verification of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. In 1937, Bhabha was awarded the Senior Studentship of the 1851 Exhibition, which helped him continue his work at Cambridge until the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939.<ref name="Penneyp39"/>

In 1939, Bhabha went back to India for a brief holiday. In September, World War II broke out, and Bhabha decided not to return to England for the time being.<ref name="Sreekantanp46">Sreekantan, p46.</ref> He accepted an offer to serve as the Reader in the Physics Department of the [[Indian Institute of Science]], then headed by renowned physicist [[C. V. Raman]]. He received a special research grant from the Sir Dorab Tata Trust, which he used to establish the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the institute.<ref>Venkataraman, p6.</ref> Bhabha selected a few students, including [[Harish-Chandra]], who would later serve as the IBM von Neumann Professor in the School of Mathematics at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], to work with him.<ref name="Sreekantanp46"/>

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] on [[20 March]] [[1941]]. With the help of [[J. R. D. Tata]], he established the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in Bombay. With the end of the [[World War II]] and [[Independence of India|Indian Independence]], he received a commendation from [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] for his efforts towards peaceful development of atomic energy. He established the [[Atomic Energy Commission of India]] in 1948. He represented India in International Atomic Energy Forums, and as President of the [[United Nations]] Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] in 1955.

==Death and legacy==
He died in an Air India Boeing 707 air crash near [[Mont Blanc]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite news |first= K. S. |last=Parthasarathy |title= Dr Homi Bhabha - a great visionary |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20011025/science.htm#2 |work=[[The Tribune]] |publisher= |date=[[2001-10-25]] |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}</ref> Conspiracy theories point to a sabotage intended at impeding India's nuclear program, but his death still remains a mystery.

After his death, the Atomic Energy Establishment was renamed as the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] in his honour. Bhabha also encouraged research in [[electronics]], [[space science]], [[radio astronomy]] and [[microbiology]]. The famed radio telescope at [[Ooty]], India was his initiation, and it became a reality in 1970. Bhabha has since become known as the "Father of India's Atomic Energy Programme".<ref>{{cite book |last=Mirchandani |first=G.
