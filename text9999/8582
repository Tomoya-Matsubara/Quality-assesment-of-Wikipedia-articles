'''Little Llangothlin Nature Reserve''' is a [[wetland]] [[nature reserve]] lying about 10&nbsp;km north-east of the rural locality of [[Llangothlin, New South Wales|Llangothlin]], and some 20&nbsp;km north-east of [[Guyra, New South Wales|Guyra]], on the [[Northern Tablelands, New South Wales|Northern Tablelands]] of the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] region of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It contains the 120&nbsp;ha Little Llangothlin Lagoon, part of the smaller Billy Bung Lagoon, and was established in 1979 under the ''NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974''. In 1996 the 258&nbsp;ha reserve was designated a wetland of international importance under the [[Ramsar Convention]]. It, with the adjacent area of Bagot Road, is also listed on Australia<U+2019>s [[Register of the National Estate]].<ref name=npws>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkNature.aspx?id=N0531 |title=Little Llangothlin Nature Reserve |accessdate=2013-07-12 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service |date= }}</ref>

The Little Llangothlin Nature Reserve is an important site because it has some of the last high altitude freshwater lagoons on basalt soil on the New England Tableland of New South Wales. The reserve is situated in an area that has lost most of its vegetation to create arable land. It thus serves as a vital refuge for numerous species of birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles.<ref name="Little Llangothlin">{{cite web|title=Little Llangothlin Nature Reserve|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHome.aspx?id=N0531|publisher=NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service|accessdate=12 July 2013}}</ref> 

==Description==
The reserve lies on [[Tertiary]] [[basalt]] [[soil]]s on the New England Plateau at an altitude of 1360&nbsp;m above sea level, and is surrounded by [[Pastoral farming|pastoral farmland]]. It protects a still largely natural example of a high altitude lake, most of which have been cleared or severely modified in the region. The lagoon fills a natural depression in the tableland landscape; a former agricultural drainage ditch has been filled in to restore it<U+2019>s original water depth of about 2&nbsp;m when full. The vegetation includes [[Cyperaceae|sedgeland]], [[herbaceous plant|herbland]] and [[grass]]y [[woodland]]. Trees include [[Eucalyptus nova-anglica|New England peppermint]]s, [[Eucalyptus pauciflora|snowgum]]s and [[Acacia dealbata|silver wattle]]s. The rare [[Discaria pubescens|Hairy Anchor Plant]] and [[Thesium australe|Austral Toadflax]] are found there. The wetlands of the reserve form an important [[drought refuge]] for many kinds of [[waterbird]]s as well as supporting several species of [[frog]]s and [[reptile]]s.<ref name=npws/> A 4.8&nbsp;km walking track encircles the lagoon.
