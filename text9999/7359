'''Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert''' (1522 &ndash; 29 October 1590), also known as '''Theodore Cornhert''', was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer, philosopher, translator, politician and [[theology|theologian]]. Coornhert is often considered the Father of Dutch Renaissance scholarship.

==Biography==
Coornhert was the youngest son of Volckert Coornhert, an [[Amsterdam]] cloth merchant. As a child he spent some years in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. Returning home, he was [[inheritance|disinherited]] by his father's [[Will (law)|will]], for his marriage with Cornelia (Neeltje) Simons, a portionless gentlewoman from [[Haarlem]], whose sister was Anna Simonsdr, the mistress of [[Reinoud III van Brederode|Reginald]] (Reinoud), count of [[Castle Brederode|Brederode]] (they were the parents of Lucretia van Brederode). Through his sister-in-law, he became [[majordomo|major-domo]] to Reginald at his castle in [[Vianen]] for a short time. Soon after that, he bought a house in his wife's home town of Haarlem on the St. Janssteeg from Anna and her husband Jan. Though he started off working for Reginald, he lived near the school where the St. Jan [[Commandry (feudalism)|commanderij]] taught classic works and commissioned art. [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] had just returned from Italy and impressed Coornhert with his work. Coornhert became an [[engraver]] on [[copper]], and produced works in collaboration with Heemskerck which became popular.<ref name=Veldman>[http://dbnl.nl/tekst/veld039coor01_01/veld039coor01_01_0001.php Biography of Coornhert] by Ilja M.

Learning [[Latin language|Latin]], Coornhert published Dutch translations from [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]. His 1562 translation of the first twelve books of Homer's ''Odyssey'' is one of the first major works of Dutch Renaissance poetry.  He was appointed secretary to the city of [[Haarlem]] (1562) and secretary to the [[burgomaster]]s (1564). Throwing himself into the [[Dutch Revolt|struggle against Spanish rule]], he drew up the manifesto of [[William the Silent]], [[Prince of Orange]] (1566). Imprisoned at [[the Hague]] in 1568, he escaped to [[Cleves]], where he maintained himself by his art. Recalled in 1572, he was for a short time [[secretary of state]] in the [[Dutch Republic]]; his aversion to military violence led him to return to Cleves, where William continued to employ his services and his pen. 

Coornhert was also famous as a theologian. At 30 years of age, having become interested in theology, and being desirous of consulting [[St. Augustine]], he commenced the study of [[Latin language|Latin]]. He entered into controversy alike with [[Catholics]] and [[Dutch Reform Church|Reformers]], with both of whom he refused to communicate. Reformers, he said, were sadly wanted, but those who called themselves such were not the kind that the church required; what was needed was apostles directly inspired from heaven. Until such were sent, he advised all churches to join together in an undogmatic communion. Coornhert wrote and strove in favor of tolerance, opposing [[capital punishment]] for [[heresy|heretics]]. He had no party views; he criticized the [[Heidelberg Catechism]], which was authoritative in Holland. [[Jacobus Arminius]], employed to refute him, was won over by his arguments. 

According to the RKD, his pupils were [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Philip Galle]], and [[Cornelis Cort]].<ref>[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&database=ChoiceArtists&search=priref=18183 Dirck Volckertsz. Coornhert] in the [[RKD]]</ref>

==Works==
In addition to the 1566 manifesto, Coornhert wrote a treatise against the [[capital punishment]] of [[Heresy|heretic]]s, a pamphlet defending the rebellion of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], a preface to the [[Dutch grammar]] published by the Society of Rhetoricians of Amsterdam, and a number of poems, including, according to some, the popular song, ''[[Wilhelmus|Wilhelmus van Nassouwe]]''.<ref name=Curiosities>{{cite book|last=D'Israeli|first=Isaac|author-link=Isaac D'Israeli|title=Curiosities of Literature|page=14|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=hJRLAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14}}</ref>  Others, however, attributed it to [[Philip van Marnix]]. His collected works appeared in 1630.

On his death in 1590, his Dutch version of the [[New Testament]], following the Latin of [[Erasmus]], was never completed. His works, in prose and verse, were published in 1630 in 3 volumes.

[[Isaac D'Israeli]] calls him "one of the fathers of [[Dutch literature]], and even of their arts."<ref name=Curiosities />
