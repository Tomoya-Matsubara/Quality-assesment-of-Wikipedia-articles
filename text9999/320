The '''London<U+2013>Surrey Cycle Classic''' was a one-off, one-day bicycle race that acted as the test event for the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]]. The race was part of the [[London Prepares series]] of events. The race was run over the Olympic course, starting in [[The Mall, London|the Mall]] and heading into [[Surrey]], where the riders completed two laps of the [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]] loop before making their way back to the Mall. The course took the riders through four Royal Parks and six London Boroughs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonpreparesseries.com/roadcycling/spectator-info/index.html|title=Spectator information|publisher=London Prepares series|work=LOCOG|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref> Most of the riders represented countries instead of trade teams; however, there were several, mainly British, trade teams in the race with England being classified as one of them. The race was won by [[2011 Tour de France]] Green Jersey winner [[Mark Cavendish]].

==Route==
The race started on [[The Mall]] then headed out of London, using the [[Kings Road, London|Kings Road]] via [[Putney Bridge]], part of [[Roehampton]], [[Richmond Park]], [[Twickenham]] and west-central [[Teddington]] running to [[Hampton Court]] (on the Greater London border). From Hampton Court the race continued southwest, passing the towns of [[Walton on Thames]] and the outskirts of [[Weybridge]], then turned south, however unlike the Olympic course took the town centres of [[West Byfleet]], [[Woking]] and [[Guildford]], before heading east on the [[A25 road|A25]] to [[Dorking]]. From Dorking the race headed north around the Box Hill loop, twice instead of the nine scheduled for the Olympics, taking in the Zig Zag hills. From there the race headed north through [[Leatherhead]] and [[Esher]] on its return to London via Hampton Court before going through Richmond Park from the south ([[Kingston upon Thames]]) and then heading along the same roads the race used on its outbound journey back to the Mall.<ref name="Preview">{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/529685/london-surrey-cycle-classic-the-big-preview.html|title=London <U+2013> Surrey Cycle Classic the big preview|author=Will Irwin and Andy McGrath|date=12 August 2011|publisher=cycling weekly|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>

In the week preceding the race London experienced a [[2011 England Riots|series of riots]]; several football matches were called off, but the London<U+2013>Surrey Cycle Classic was allowed to proceed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14481516|title=Locog: London<U+2013>Surrey Cycle Classic 'to go ahead'|10 August 2011|work=BBC|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref> On race day British riders Liam Holohan, [[Kristian House]] and Tom Murray and Brazil's Cleberson Weber opened up a 6&nbsp;minute gap in the breakaway before the peloton started to pull them back on the final Box Hill climb.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cycling/14521435.stm|title=Mark Cavendish wins London 2012 road race test event|author=Ollie Williams|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 August 2011|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref> 2009 [[British National Road Race Championships|British road race champion]] House won the King of the Mountains award.<ref name=cw1/> The lead quartet were swept up in the final 9&nbsp;kilometres as Great Britain and England controlled the pace. [[Kurt-Asle Arvesen]] then made a bid for the win before being brought back. With 12&nbsp;kilometres to go, [[Tyler Farrar]] suffered a puncture. After chasing furiously he reached the peloton with 2&nbsp;kilometres to go, only to see his chance of the win wiped out as a crash occurred; according to [[Heinrich Haussler]] it was caused by two riders fighting. The crash split the peloton and in a group of just 20 riders [[Mark Cavendish]] beat [[Sacha Modolo]] of Italy and France's [[Samuel Dumoulin]] in a sprint finish on the Mall.<ref name=cw1>{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/529695/cavendish-wins-london-surrey-cycle-classic.html|title=Cavendish wins London<U+2013>Surrey Cycle Classic|author=Andy McGrath & Nigel Wynn|date=14 August 2011|publisher=Cycling Weekly|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>

[[File:NicoleCooke.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Nicole Cooke <U+2013> seen here at the Beijing Olympics <U+2013> accused the organisers of sexism]]There was no women's test event held, which led the [[Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Women's road race|2008 Olympic Champion]] [[Nicole Cooke]] to accuse the organisers of sexism. [[2010 UCI Road World Championships <U+2013> Women's time trial|2010 World Time Trial Champion]] [[Emma Pooley]] was also disappointed, stating "How much extra effort would go in to putting on a women's race? I'm sorry, but we have a sport as well, it kind of annoys me every time." To remedy the lack of racing on the course Cooke and [[Lizzie Armitstead]] followed the race in the team cars to survey the course.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/529692/cooke-and-armitstead-to-follow-men-s-race.html|author=Simon Richardson|date=12 August 2011|title=Cooke and Armitstead to follow men's race|publisher=Cycling Weekly|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>

LOCOG's Director of Sport Debbie Jevans declared herself pleased with the event. However in her debrief with the UCI she said she would look at comments from riders, the impact of the full road closures along the route and the crowd restrictions on Box Hill. Jevans said that overall consensus was that it was a 'fantastic' course which was 'technically challenging.' However, riders complained about the first part of the course, with Dumoulin commenting that it was "a little dangerous." Jevans also noted that the a section of the Box Hill area will be widened. As for the limited crowd of 3,400 on Box Hill, Jevans stated that she would look into trying to increase the capacity on that section as an estimated 100,000 people turned out to watch the event in total.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/529708/locog-happy-with-olympic-test-event-but-changes-will-be-made-if-necessary.html|date=15 August 2011|author=Nick Bull|title=LOCOG happy with Olympic test event - but changes will be made if necessary|publisher=Cycling weekly|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref> Pat McQuaid, president of the UCI, was impressed by the spectator turnout.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uci.ch/Modules/ENews/ENewsDetails.asp?id=NzUzMg&MenuId=MTU5MzU&LangId=1&BackLink=%2Ftemplates%2FUCI%2FUCI5%2Flayout%2Easp%3FMenuId%3DMTU5MzU%26LangId%3D1|title=The London<U+2013>Surrey Cycle Classic 2011 : Olympic test event hailed as a success|date=15 August 2011|publisher=uci.ch|work=UCI|accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref>

BBC Surrey received complaints about inaccurate signage and road closures that cut off large parts of the towns. Complaints about the closures led [[Surrey County Council]] to issue an apology through Councillor Denise Saliagopolous for the problems experienced.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14529320|title=Surrey council apologises for pre-2012 bike race road closures|date=15 August 2011|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>

==TV coverage==
A 20-minute highlights package was televised a week after the race on 21 August 2011. It was screened at 13:00 on BBC Two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013sdk6|accessdate=20 August 2011|title=Olympic Countdown|publisher=BBC}}</ref>
