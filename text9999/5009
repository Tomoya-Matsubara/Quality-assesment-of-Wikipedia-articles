'''Robusta''' is a sturdy species of [[coffee bean]] with low acidity and high bitterness; it is used primarily in instant coffee, espresso, and as a filler in ground coffee blends. The bean comes from the ''coffea robusta'' or [[coffea canephora]] plant which has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan [[Africa]]. 

==Cultivation and use==

Approximately 30% of the coffee produced in the world is robusta.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21581727-plenty-coffee-too-few-drinkers-brewed-awakening |title=Plenty of Coffee Too Few Drinkers - economist.com |work=economist.com |accessdate=19 July 2013 |date=13 July 2013}}</ref> It is mostly grown in [[Coffee production in Vietnam|Vietnam]], where French colonists introduced it in the late 19th century, though it is also grown in [[Africa]] and [[Coffee production in Brazil|Brazil]], where it is often called ''conilon''.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=GYZaVvtGJ4sC&pg=PA41 |title=Insect pest management: field and protected crops |page=41|author=A.

==Plant==
{{main|Coffea canephora}}
Robusta is a [[species]] of [[flowering plant]] in the [[rubiaceae]] [[Family (biology)|family]].  Though widely known as ''coffea robusta'', the plant is scientifically identified as ''coffea canephora'', which has two main varieties, ''robusta'' and ''nganda''.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=MPjMkLKebBQC&pg=PA58 |title=Agriculture & Fishery Technology Iv |page=58 |author=J. Dagoon |publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|year=2005 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> The plant has a shallow root system and grows as a robust tree or shrub to about 10 metres. It flowers irregularly, taking about 10&ndash;11 months for cherries to ripen, producing oval-shaped beans. The robusta plant has a greater crop yield than that of arabica, and contains more [[caffeine]] <U+2013>  2.7% compared to arabica's 1.5%.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=5JXBN7fqg0MC&pg=PA177 |title=The Cultural History of Plants|page=177|author=Mark Nesbitt|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year= 2005 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> As it is less susceptible to pests and disease,<ref name="DavironPonte2005">{{cite book|author1=Benoit Daviron|author2=Stefano Ponte|title=The Coffee Paradox: Global Markets, Commodity Trade and the Elusive Promise of Development|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mwpAO0J9ojgC&pg=PA51|year=2005|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84277-457-1|page=51}}</ref> robusta needs much less herbicide and pesticide than arabica.

Originating in upland forests in Ethiopia, robusta grows indigenously in Western and Central [[Africa]] from [[Liberia]] to [[Tanzania]] and south to [[Angola]]. It was not recognized as a species of ''[[coffea]]'' until 1897,<ref>[http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/28795724#page/279/mode/1up Pierre, Jean Baptiste Louis ex Froehner, Albrecht. 1897.
