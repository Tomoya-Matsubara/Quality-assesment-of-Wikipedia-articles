The '''Landesliga Hamburg-Hammonia''' is the sixth tier of the [[German football league system]] and the second-highest league in the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Hamburg]], together with the ''[[Landesliga Hamburg-Hansa]]''. It is named after the [[Latin]] word for Hamburg, [[Hammonia]].

==Overview==
===1947 to 1950===
The league was formed in 1947, alongside three other divisions on the same level in the City of Hamburg, as the '''Bezirksklasse Hamburg-Hammonia'''. The other three leagues were:
* [[Bezirksklasse Hamburg-Hansa]]
* [[Bezirksklasse Hamburg-Germania]]
* [[Bezirksklasse Hamburg-Olympia]]

The four new leagues replaced the ''1. Klasse Hamburg'' as the feeder leagues to the ''[[Stadtliga Hamburg]]'', which was now renamed ''Verbandsliga Hamburg''. The ''1. Klasse Hamburg'' had been operating since the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945 and consisted of three divisions. The change in the league system at this level came together with the establishment of the ''[[Oberliga Nord (1947-63)|Oberliga Nord]]'' as the new tier-one league in Northern Germany. This meant the new ''Bezirksklasse'' in Hamburg was now the third tier of the league system, below ''Oberliga'' and ''Verbandsliga''.

The league started out with ten clubs, with the league champion being promoted to the ''Verbandsliga''. In its second season, the league expanded to twelve clubs. The league above it was renamed from ''Verbandsliga Hamburg'' to ''Amateurliga Hamburg'' at the end of this season. The year after, in 1950, the ''Amateurliga'' was then reduced to one single division from the two it had been operating at previously.

For the ''Bezirksklasse'', this also meant a change: The four existing divisions were disbanded and replaced by two leagues:
* [[Bezirksklasse Hamburg-Alster]]
* [[Bezirksklasse Hamburg-Elbe]]

For the ''Hammonia-division'' (German: ''Hammonia-Staffel'') this meant a temporary end to its operation.

===1953 to 1963===
In 1953, the league was once more reestablished and the ''Elbe-Staffel'' and ''Alster-Staffel'' disbanded. Three of the four leagues in existence until 1950 were reformed, the ''Olympia-Staffel'' however, was not. The leagues were now named ''Verbandsligas'':
* '''Verbandsliga Hamburg-Hammonia'''
* [[Verbandsliga Hamburg-Hansa]]
* [[Verbandsliga Hamburg-Germania]]

Each of the three divisions had now fourteen clubs and the league champion was again promoted directly to the ''Amateurliga Hamburg''. The leagues were again the third tier of the German league system. In the fourteen-team per division era, usually the bottom two teams of each division were relegated. Additionally, teams would be moved between the three divisions according to geographical necessity, to balance them out.

In 1963, the [[Fussball Bundesliga]] was established in Germany. The old ''Oberliga Nord'' was disbanded and at its stead, the ''[[Regionalliga Nord (1963-74)|Regionalliga Nord]]'' was set as the second tier of the league system. The ''Amateurliga Hamburg'', now renamed ''Landesliga Hamburg'', slipped to third tier in the league system, making the three ''Verbandsligas'' the fourth tier now. Otherwise, nothing changed for the three leagues.

===1963 to 1974===
In the first couple of seasons after 1963, nothing changed for the three leagues.

In 1970, the ''Germania-Staffel'' was disbanded, leaving only the ''Hansa'' and ''Hammonia'' division on this level, as it is today. The two remaining divisions were increased in size, ''Hansa'' to seventeen and ''Hammonia'' to sixteen. Also, the leagues changed their name from ''Verbandsliga'' to ''Amateurliga''. The following seson, both divisions operated with sixteen clubs.

In 1974, the ''Regionalliga Nord'' was replaced by the ''[[2nd Bundesliga Nord (1974-81)|2nd Bundesliga Nord]]'' as the second tier in the region. As the new third tier, the ''[[Oberliga Nord]]'' was re-established. The ''Landesliga Hamburg'', now renamed ''Verbandsliga Hamburg'' slipped to fourth tier because of this change and the two ''Amateurligas'' below it therefore to fifth tier.

===1974 to 1994===
In 1978, the ''Amateurligas'' in Hamburg were renamed to ''Landesliga'', a name they carry to date. Nothing changed otherwise for the '''Landesliga Hamburg-Hammonia'''.

The league experienced no change in the two decades from 1974 to 1994, operating on sixteen teams for all but one season. Also, changes in the league system above it did not affect it in this time.

In 1994, however, the ''Regionalligas'' were reformed. In the north, this meant a reestablishing of the ''[[Regionalliga Nord]]''. The ''Oberliga Nord'' was disbanded again and in its stead, the ''[[Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein]]'' was formed. The ''Regionalliga'' becoming the new third tier in the league system meant for the ''Landesligas'' that they now fell to sixth tier.

===1994 to current===
The league continued to remain unchanged. The ''Oberliga Nord'' was re-formed, again, in 2004, replacing the ''Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein'' at this level. This meant no change for the ''Landesligas''.

In 2008, the ''[[3rd Liga]]'' was established and the ''Oberliga Nord'' once more disbanded. In stead of this league, the five northern ''Verbandsligas'' were elevated to the status of ''Oberliga'', meaning, the ''Verbandsliga Hamburg'' now became the ''[[Oberliga Hamburg]]''. The two leagues below it remained as the ''Landesligas'', unchanged in name and tier.
