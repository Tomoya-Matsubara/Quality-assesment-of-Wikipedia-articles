'''Velvet Revolver''' is an American [[hard rock]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] consisting of former [[Guns N' Roses]] members [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Duff McKagan]] and [[Matt Sorum]], alongside [[Dave Kushner]], formerly of [[Hardcore punk|punk]] band [[Wasted Youth (American band)|Wasted Youth]]. [[Stone Temple Pilots]] vocalist [[Scott Weiland]] was Velvet Revolver's lead singer from their formation until 2008. In 2004, the band achieved commercial success with their debut album, ''[[Contraband (Velvet Revolver album)|Contraband]]''. Despite positive reviews, some critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses, criticizing them for a "disconnection" between Scott Weiland and the rest of the band. With their single "[[Slither (song)|Slither]]", they won the 2005 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]].

The band released ''[[Libertad (Velvet Revolver album)|Libertad]]'' in 2007, driven by the release of the single "[[She Builds Quick Machines]]", and embarked on a tour with [[Alice in Chains]]. In April 2008, Weiland left Velvet Revolver and [[2008 Stone Temple Pilots Reunion Tour|reunited with Stone Temple Pilots]]. Velvet Revolver has been on indefinite hiatus since April 2008, and in November of that year, the band was released by their record label [[RCA Records]] at their request to allow them "complete freedom to go through whatever process it would take to accomplish" replacing Weiland.

The release of Slash's [[Slash (album)|self-titled debut solo album]] and Duff McKagan's addition to the [[Jane's Addiction]] lineup seemed to put the future of the band in doubt. However, McKagan left Jane's Addiction a few months after joining. Despite being on hiatus, Velvet Revolver has written new songs and plans to audition singers and reconvene in 2011.
