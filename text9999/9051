'''Drinsey Nook''' is a small village in the [[West Lindsey]] district of [[Lincolnshire]], England, about {{convert|2|mi|km}} south west of [[Saxilby]], close to the county border with [[Nottinghamshire]]. 

It is most notable for the case of  '''Tom Otter''', a man who murdered his new wife in 1805. Tom Otter lane is the B1190 running south of the village, and  Tom Otters bridge is named after the site of the murder.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Gentlemans Magazine|year=1848|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-1FIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA296&dq=Drinsey+nook&hl=en&ei=1_kqTpyTDcih8QOryp38Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Drinsey%20nook&f=false|author=W Pickering|edition=Vol 30|page=296}}</ref> 

The story says that Tom Otter, reputedly from [[Treswell, Nottinghamshire|Treswell]], was already a married man when he married his new wife, Mary, whom he murdered the same day, near the bridge that now bears his name. He hung in 1806, and was held in a [[Gibbet]] post by Gibbet Wood.<ref>{{cite book|title=The handbook guide to lincoln and business intelligencer|year=1855|publisher=R. E.
