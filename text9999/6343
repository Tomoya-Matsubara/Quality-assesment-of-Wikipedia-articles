The '''Bath School disaster''' is the historical name of the violent attacks perpetrated by [[Andrew Kehoe]] on May 18, 1927 in [[Bath Township, Michigan]] that killed 38 [[elementary school]] children and six adults, and injured at least 58 other people.<ref group="Note">Most of the victims were [[Bath Consolidated School]] students in the second to sixth [[Educational stages|grades]] (7<U+2013>14 years of age) according to Page 126 of Ellsworth's ''The Bath School Disaster''.</ref>  Kehoe first killed his wife, fire-bombed his farm and set off a major explosion in the [[Bath Consolidated School]], before committing [[suicide]] by detonating a final explosion in his truck. It is the deadliest [[mass murder]] in a school in United States history.<ref name = "Slate"/>

Andrew Kehoe, the 55-year-old [[school board]] [[treasurer]], was angry after his defeat in the spring 1926 election for township [[Clerk (municipal official)|clerk]]. He was thought to have planned his "murderous revenge" after that public defeat and he had a reputation for difficulty on the school board and in personal dealings. In addition, in June 1926 he was notified that his mortgage was going to be foreclosed.<ref name="dynamiter"/> For much of the next year, a neighbor noticed Kehoe had stopped working on his farm and thought he might be planning [[suicide]]. During that period, Kehoe purchased explosives and discreetly planted them on his property and under the school.

Kehoe's wife was ill with [[tuberculosis]], he had stopped making mortgage payments, and he was under pressure for foreclosure. Some time between May 16 and the morning of May 18, 1927, Kehoe murdered his wife by hitting her on the head with a blunt object.  On the morning of May 18 at about 8:45 a.m., he set off various incendiary devices on his homestead that caused the house and other farm buildings to be destroyed by the explosives' blast and subsequent fires.

Almost simultaneously, an explosion devastated the north wing of the school building, killing many schoolchildren. Kehoe had used a timed detonator to ignite hundreds of pounds of [[dynamite]] and incendiary [[pyrotol]], which he had secretly planted inside the school over the course of many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a rifle to detonate dynamite inside his [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]]-filled truck, killing himself, the [[superintendent (education)|school superintendent]], and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500&nbsp;pounds (230&nbsp;kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a timing device set to detonate at the same time as the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the [[basement]] of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended to blow up and destroy the entire school.

==Background==
===Bath Township===
{{See also|Bath Township, Michigan|Bath, Michigan}}

Bath Township is a small community located ten miles (16&nbsp;km) northeast of [[Lansing, Michigan]], and contains the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[village]] of Bath. In the early 1920s, the area was primarily [[agriculture|agricultural]]. In the early part of the 20th century, many small [[one-room school]]s, where different grades shared the same classroom and teacher, were closed. Educators of the era believed that children would receive a better and more [[education reform|complete education]] if students could attend a single school at one location.<ref name="education"/> The grades could be age-divided into classes, and the facilities could be of a higher quality.

After years of debate, in 1922 Bath Township voters approved creation of the consolidated school district, and the increase in property taxes to pay for the new school.<ref name="ellsworth ch 1"/> When the school opened, it had 236 students enrolled in grades 1-12.<ref name="ellsworth ch 1"/> All area landowners had to pay higher property taxes. At the time of the bombing, the village had about 300 residents.<ref name="dynamiter"/>

===Andrew Kehoe===
{{Main|Andrew Kehoe}}
[[File:AndrewKehoe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=a single grey-haired man dressed in a dark suit and white shirt, is looking directly at the photographer, while sitting in a chair at a table while apparently holding up a cigar|[[Andrew Kehoe|Andrew P. Kehoe]], circa 1920]]
[[Andrew Kehoe|Andrew Philip Kehoe]] was born in [[Tecumseh, Michigan]], on February 1, 1872. Kehoe's mother died when he was young, and his father married a much younger widow. Reportedly, Kehoe often quarreled with his stepmother. When he was fourteen, an accident at the oil stove set his stepmother on fire. Kehoe threw a bucket of water on her but, because the fire was [[Fire classes#Flammable liquid and gas|oil-based]], it spread the flames more rapidly over her body. She died from her injuries.<ref name="bernstein1"/> He studied electrical engineering at Michigan State College in Lansing and worked as an electrician in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref name="ellsworth ch 3"/>

After several years in Missouri, Kehoe returned to Michigan. At the age of 40, he married Ellen "Nellie" Price in 1912. Seven years later they moved to a farm they bought outside the village of Bath.<ref name="mayday p 27"/> Kehoe's neighbors described him as an intelligent man who was impatient with all who disagreed with him. Neighbors recounted that Kehoe had shot and killed a neighbor's dog that had come on his property and annoyed him by barking. He was known to have beaten one of his horses to death when it did not perform as well as he wanted.<ref name="ellsworth ch 1"/>

With a reputation for frugality, Kehoe was elected in 1924 as [[treasurer]] of the Bath Consolidated School board. While on the board, he argued endlessly for lower taxes. The later superintendent of the board, M.W. Keys, said that Kehoe "fought the expenditure of money for the most necessary equipment."<ref name="dynamiter"/>  He was considered extremely difficult to work with, often voting against the rest of the board and wanting his own way. He repeatedly accused the superintendent Emory Huyck of financial mismanagement.<ref name="ellsworth ch 3"/>

He argued with township financial authorities, trying to get the valuation of his property reduced, and claimed that he had paid too much for the farm. He also tried to get the mortgage taken off but was not successful.<ref name="ellsworth ch 3"/> In June 1926, he was notified that the company was going to foreclose on his property.<ref name="dynamiter"/>

Kehoe was appointed in 1925 to temporarily fill the position of town clerk but, several months later, he was defeated in the regular spring 1926 election for the position. This public rejection by the community angered him. In his eyewitness account, ''The Bath School Disaster'', Monty J. Ellsworth said he thought this rejection was the reason Kehoe had planned his "murderous revenge" of the bombings, to destroy the school and kill the community's children and many of its members.<ref name="ellsworth ch 1"/><ref name="ellsworth ch 5"/>

A. McMullen, another neighbor, noted that Kehoe had stopped working on his farm altogether for most of the preceding year, and thought he might be planning [[suicide]]. For this reason, when Kehoe gave him one of his horses about April 1927, McMullen returned it.<ref name="ellsworth ch 5"/>

It was discovered later that, as part of Kehoe's preparations to destroy his farm, he had cut all his wire fences, girdled young shade trees to kill them, and cut off his grapevine plants before putting them back on their stumps to hide the damage. He gathered lumber and other materials and put them in the tool shed, which he later exploded with an incendiary bomb.<ref name="ellsworth ch 5"/>

By the time of the bombing, Nellie Kehoe had become chronically ill with [[tuberculosis]], for which there was no effective treatment or cure. Her frequent hospital stays may have contributed to the family's debt. Kehoe had ceased making mortgage and [[homeowner's insurance]] payments months earlier.<ref name="ellsworth ch 3"/>

===Purchase and planting of explosives===
[[File:Bath School dynamite2.jpg|thumb|alt=boxes of [[Pyrotol]], sticks of dynamite, sacks of explosives and wiring in a pile|Explosives recovered from under the school]]
There is no clear indication when Kehoe conceived and planned the steps leading to the ultimate events, but his neighbor, M. J. Ellsworth, thought that Kehoe conceived his plan after being defeated in spring 1926 for the election as town clerk.<ref name="ellsworth ch 5"/> The general consensus of the townspeople was that Kehoe had worked on his plan at least since August of the previous year.<ref name="ellsworth ch 5"/>

M.W. Keyes, a member of the Bath School Board was quoted by the New York Times as saying
<blockquote>"I have no doubt that he made his plans last Fall [1926] to blow up the school...  He was an experienced electrician and the board employed him in November to make some repairs on the school lighting system.  He had ample opportunity then to plant the explosives and lay the wires for touching it off."<ref name="dynamiter"/></blockquote>Kehoe had free access to the building during the summer vacation of 1926.<ref name="ellsworth ch 4"/>

From mid-1926, Kehoe began purchasing more than a [[ton]] of [[pyrotol]], an incendiary explosive used by farmers during the era for excavation and burning of debris. In November 1926, he drove to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] and purchased two boxes of [[dynamite]] at a [[sporting goods]] store.<ref name="Inquest Page 343"/>  As dynamite was also commonly used on farms, Kehoe's purchase of small amounts of explosives at different stores and on different dates did not raise any suspicions. Neighbors reported hearing explosions set off on the farm, with one even calling him "the dynamite farmer".<ref>{{cite book|last=Buhk|first=Tobin|title=True Crime : Michigan: The State's Most Notorious Criminal Cases|year=2011|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NN-tA-cUerIC&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 15, 2013|page=57}}</ref>

In December 1926, according to the testimony of Lieutenant Lyle Morse, a [[Michigan State Police]] investigator with the Department of Public Safety, Kehoe purchased a [[.30-06|.30-caliber]] [[Winchester Model 54|Winchester bolt-action rifle]].<ref name="ellsworth ch 3"/><ref name="Inquest Page 343"/><ref group="Note">Ellsworth said in his account:
::I went down there to use their telephone last winter, about February, 1927, and he had just been shooting at the target. When I got through using the telephone, he showed me his new thirty Winchester bolt action rifle that he had bought two or three months before."
This sets the Winchester's date of purchase as being two to three months before February 1927, with the bombings and truck bomb (May 18, 1927) being staged five or six months after purchase. Ellsworth's recollection was corroborated by Lt. Morse's testimony before the Coroner's Inquest.</ref>

==Day of the disaster==
[[File:Kahoe House.jpg|thumb|left|alt=late 19th Century 2-story farmhouse with porches and a barn in the background|Andrew and Nellie Kehoe's house before the disaster]]
Prior to May 18, Kehoe had loaded the back seat of his truck with all sorts of metal debris capable of producing [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] during an explosion.<ref name="ellsworth ch 5"/>

[[File:Kahoe House remains-east.jpg|thumb|right|alt=a single chimney is all that is left standing after Kehoe's bombs destroyed his farm|The remains of Kehoe's house after the explosion]]
Nellie Kehoe had been discharged on May 16 from Lansing's St. Lawrence Hospital.<ref name="mayday p 97-98"/> Between her release and the bombings two days later, Kehoe killed his wife. Her death was later determined to be by blunt force trauma to the head with an unknown heavy object. He put her body in a [[wheelbarrow]] located in the rear of the farm's [[chicken coop]], where it was found, heavily charred, after the farm explosions and fire. Piled around the cart were silverware and a metal cash box. Ashes of several [[bank note]]s could be seen through a slit in the cash box.<ref name="dynamiter"/> Kehoe had placed and wired homemade pyrotol [[incendiary device|firebombs]] in the house and all the buildings of the farm. The burned remains of his two horses were found tied in their enclosures with their legs wired together, to prevent their being rescued during the fire.<ref name="ellsworth ch 5"/>

===Farm bombs===
At approximately 8:45 a.m., Kehoe detonated the firebombs in his house and farm buildings, causing some debris to fly into a neighbor's poultry brooding house.<ref name="Michigan History magazine"/>  Neighbors noticed the fire, and volunteers rushed to the scene.<ref name ="dynamiter"/><ref name="Biography.Com"/>

O.H. Bush, a fireman, and several other men crawled through a broken window of the farmhouse in search of survivors. When they determined no one was in the farmhouse, they salvaged what furniture they could before the fire spread into the living room. Discovering dynamite in the corner, Bush picked up an armful of explosives and handed it to one of the men.<ref name="dynamiter"/><ref group="Note">This man's name is rendered in the New York Times as "O.H. Buck" but in the Coroner's Inquest as "O.H. Bush".  Since the Inquest is an official government document, in this article his name is rendered as "O.H. Bush."</ref>  As Kehoe left his burning farm and house in his Ford truck, he stopped to tell those fighting the fire, "Boys, you're my friends. You better get out of here. You better head down to the school", and drove off.<ref name="Michigan History magazine"/><ref>Arnie Bernstein, ''Bath Massacre: America's First School Bombing'', Michigan State University Press, 2009</ref>

===Explosion in north wing of school===
[[File:Bath School Disaster-east.jpg|thumb|alt=onlookers mill around, looking at the half-destroyed Bath School building|Rear view of the school building after the bombing]]
Classes began at 8:30 a.m. that morning. At about 8:45 a.m.,<ref> Inquest - Pages 1, 2, 13, 27, 167, 289, 349</ref> in the basement of the north wing of the school, an alarm clock set by Kehoe detonated the dynamite and pyrotol he had hidden there. <ref> Inquest - Pages 1, 337, 349</ref>

Rescuers heading to the scene of the Kehoe farm fire heard the explosion at the school building, turned back and headed toward the school. Parents within the rural community also began rushing to the school.<ref name="ellsworth ch 2"/> Thirty-eight people, mostly children, were killed in the explosion of the north wing.<ref name="38die"/><ref name="Psycho"/> 

The first-grade teacher Bernice Sterling told an [[Associated Press]] reporter that the explosion was like an earthquake:
{{quote|It seemed as though the floor went up several feet," she said. "After the first shock I thought for a moment I was blind. When it came the air seemed to be full of children and flying desks and books. Children were tossed high in the air; some were catapulted out of the building.<ref name="ap"/>}}

The north wing of the school had collapsed. Parts of the walls had crumbled, and the edge of the roof had fallen to the ground. Monty Ellsworth, a neighbor of the Kehoes, recounted, {{quote|There was a pile of children of about five or six under the roof and some of them had arms sticking out, some had legs, and some just their heads sticking out. They were unrecognizable because they were covered with dust, plaster, and blood. There were not enough of us to move the roof.<ref name="ellsworth ch 2"/>}} Ellsworth volunteered to drive back to his farm and get a rope heavy enough to pull the school roof off the children's bodies. Returning to his farm, Ellsworth saw Kehoe in the opposite direction heading toward the school. "He grinned and waved his hand; when he grinned, I could see both rows of his teeth", said Ellsworth.<ref name="ellsworth ch 2"/>

The scene at the school building was chaotic. Robert Gates, a witness, said
{{quote|...&nbsp;mother after mother came running into the school yard, and demanded information about her child and, on seeing the lifeless form lying on the lawn, sobbed and swooned...In no time more than 100 men were at work tearing away the debris of the school, and nearly as many women were frantically pawing over the timber and broken bricks for traces of their children.<ref name = "United Press"/>}}

===Truck explosion===
[[File:Kehoe car.jpg|thumb|alt=the almost destroyed chassis of Kehoe's Ford pickup truck, surrounded by onlookers| The remains of Kehoe's Ford truck after the explosion]]
About a half hour after the explosion, Kehoe drove up to the school and saw Superintendent Huyck. Kehoe summoned the superintendent over to his truck.  Charles Hawson testified at the Inquest that he saw the two men struggle over some type of long gun and that the car then went up in an explosion,<ref name="Inquest Page 326"/> killing Superintendent Huyck, Kehoe, Glenn O. Smith, and Nelson McFarren, a retired farmer.<ref name="Inquest"/><ref name = "Burcar"/>  Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader, had wandered out of the collapsed school building and was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith (who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds) and injured several others.<ref name = "Burcar"/>

After Kehoe's truck exploded, Ellsworth recounted,
{{quote|I saw one mother, Mrs. Eugene Hart, sitting on the bank a short distance from the school with a little dead girl on each side of her and holding a little boy, Percy, who died a short time after they got him to the hospital. This was about the time Kehoe blew his car up in the street, severely wounding Perry, the oldest child of Mr. and Mrs. Hart.<ref name="ellsworth ch 2"/>}}

O.H. Bush, foreman of the road crew, recalled the scene after the final explosion:
{{quote|I began to feel as though the world was coming to an end. I guess I was a bit hazy. Anyway, the next thing I remember I was out on the street. One of our men was binding up the wounds of Glenn Smith, the postmaster. His leg had been blown off. I went back to the building and helped with the rescue work until we were ordered to stop while a search was made for dynamite.<ref name="dynamiter"/>}}

===Recovery and rescue===
[[File:Wheelbarrow-Kahoe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The pushcart or wheelbarrow where Nellie Kehoe's dead body was found (covered by a cloth and surrounded by onlookers) and protected with a crude fence |The pushcart where Nellie Kehoe's body was found]]
[[Switchboard operator|Telephone operators]] stayed at their stations for hours to summon doctors, [[undertaker]]s, area hospitals and anyone else who might help. The Lansing Fire Department sent several firefighters and its chief.<ref name="Finley2011">{{cite book|author=Laura Finley|title=Encyclopedia of School Crime and Violence|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xRyU1nEAB5YC&pg=PA43|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=13 September 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36239-2|page=43}}</ref>

The local physician, Dr. J. A. Crum and his wife, a nurse, had both served in [[World War I]], and had returned to Bath to open a [[pharmacy]]. After the explosion the Crums turned their drugstore into a [[triage]] center with the dead bodies being taken to the [[town hall]], which was being used as a morgue.<ref name="ellsworth ch 2"/>

Hundreds of people worked in the wreckage all day and into the night in an effort to find and rescue any children pinned underneath. Area contractors had sent all their men to assist, and many ordinary people came to the scene in response to the pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing [[Fire Department]] arrived on the scene, as did several [[Michigan State Police]] officers, who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to [[Sparrow Health System|Sparrow Hospital]] and St. Lawrence Hospital in [[Lansing]]. The construction of the latter facility had been financed in large part by [[Lawrence Price]], Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of [[Oldsmobile]]'s [[Lansing Car Assembly]].<ref name="mayday p 76"/>

[[Michigan Governor]] [[Fred Green]] arrived during the afternoon of the disaster and assisted in the relief work, carting bricks away from the scene. The Lawrence Baking Company of Lansing sent a truck filled with pies and sandwiches, which were served to rescuers in the township's community hall.<ref name="ellsworth ch 2"/>

The bombing had destroyed the north wing of the school. During the search, rescuers found an additional 500&nbsp;pounds (230&nbsp;kg) of dynamite, which had failed to detonate, in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices. The State Police found an [[alarm clock]] timed to go off at 8:45 a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in the second set of bombs, preventing them from detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.<ref name="dynamiter 2"/>

Police and fire officials gathered at the Kehoe farm to investigate the fires.  State troopers had searched for Nellie Kehoe throughout Michigan, thinking she was at a [[sanitorium|tuberculosis sanitorium]], but her charred body was found the following day, May 19, among the ruins of the farm.<ref name="dynamiter"/>  All the Kehoe farm buildings were destroyed, and the two horses trapped inside the barn died. Investigators found a wooden sign wired to the farm's fence with Kehoe's last message, "Criminals are made, not born", stenciled on it.<ref name="dynamiter"/>

The [[American Red Cross]], setting up operations at the Crum drugstore, took the lead in providing aid and comfort to the victims. The Lansing Red Cross headquarters stayed open until 11:30 that night to answer telephone calls, update the list of dead and injured and provide information and planning services for the following day.<ref name="ccrn 2a"/>

The local community responded generously, as reported at the time by the [[Associated Press]]: "...a sympathetic public assured the rehabilitation of the stricken community.  Aid was tendered freely in the hope that the grief of those who lost loved ones might be even slightly mitigated."<ref>"Friends Offer Aid to Blast Victims." [[The Baltimore Sun|The Sun]], 1927, page 12</ref>  The Red Cross managed donations sent to pay for both the medical expenses of the survivors and the [[burial]] costs of the dead. In a few weeks, $5,284.15 (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5284.15|1927|r=0}}}} today){{Inflation-fn|US}} was raised through donations, including $2,500 from the [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]] [[board of supervisors]] and $2,000 from the [[Michigan legislature]].<ref name="ccrn 23a"/>  In addition to monetary donations, the Red Cross Headquarters received extensive donations of flowers from strangers.<ref name="VictimsOfBlast"/>

Howell testified that after the fire began, Kehoe warned him and three boys to leave the farm, saying ""Boys, you are my friends, you better get out of here, you better go down to the school."<ref name="Inquest Page 95"/> Three telephone linemen working near Bath testified that Kehoe passed them on the road toward the school, and they saw him arrive there. He swerved his truck and stopped in front of the building. In the next instant, according to the linemen, the truck blew up, and one of them was struck by shrapnel.<ref name="Inquest Page 310"/><ref name="Inquest Page 314"/>  Other witnesses testified that Kehoe paused after stopping and called Superintendent Huyck over before blowing up his truck.<ref name="Inquest Page 326"/> 

Although there was never any doubt that Kehoe was the perpetrator, the jury was asked to determine if the school board or its employees were guilty of [[criminal negligence]].<ref name="mayday p 160"/> After more than a week of testimony, the jury exonerated the school board and its employees. In its verdict, the jury concluded that Kehoe "conducted himself [[sanity|sanely]] and so concealed his operations that there was no cause to suspect any of his actions; and we further find that the school board, and Frank Smith, [[janitor]] of the school building, were not negligent in and about their duties, and were not guilty of any negligence in not discovering Kehoe's plan."<ref name="mayday p 160"/>

The inquest determined that Kehoe murdered Superintendent Emory Huyck on the morning of May 18. It was also the jury's verdict that the school was blown up as part of a plan and that Kehoe alone, without the aid of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspirators]], murdered 43 people in total, including his wife Nellie. [[Suicide]] was determined to be the cause of Andrew Kehoe's death, which brought the total number of dead to 44 at the time of the inquest.<ref name="ccrn 26a"/>

On August 22, three months after the bombing, the fourth-grader Beatrice Gibbs died following hip surgery. Hers was the 45th and final death directly attributable to the Bath School disaster,<ref name="daggy p 29"/> which made it the most deadly attack to ever occur in an American school.<ref name = "Slate"/>

===Rebuilding===
Governor [[Fred Green]] quickly called for donations to aid the townspeople<ref name="dynamiter"/> and created the Bath Relief Fund with the money supplied by donors, the state, and local governments. People from around the country donated to the fund.

School resumed on September 5, 1927 and, for the 1927<U+2013>1928 school year, was held in the community hall, township hall, and two retail buildings. Most of the students returned. The board appointed O. M. Brant of [[Luther, Michigan]], to succeed Huyck as superintendent. The Lansing architect [[Warren Holmes]] donated construction plans, and the school board approved the contracts for the new building on September 14. On September 15, Michigan's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[List of United States Senators from Michigan|U.S. Senator]] [[James J. Couzens]] presented his personal check for $75,000 (roughly ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|75000|1927|r=2}}}} in today's money){{Inflation-fn|US}} to the Bath construction fund to build the new school.<ref name = "ind"/><ref>{{cite news|title=COUZENS REBUILDS SCHOOL|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=25 June 1927|page=14}}</ref><ref name="ellsworth ch 8"/>

The board demolished the damaged portion of the school and constructed a new wing with the donated funds. The "James Couzens Agricultural School," named for the senator, was dedicated on August 18, 1928.<ref name="Ashlee">Ashlee (2005), ''Traveling Through Time,'' p. 96</ref>

===Legacy===
[[File:MichiganHistoricalSign.jpg|thumb|alt=State of Michigan Historical marker with gold text on a green background, standing in a field of snow|The state historic site marker placed on the site]]
* In 1975 the Couzens building was demolished<ref name = "Plaque"/> and the site was redeveloped as the Bath School Memorial Park/James Couzens Memorial Park, dedicated to the victims. At the center of the park is the [[cupola]] of the building, the only part that is still preserved.<ref name = "Burcar"/>
* In 1991 a Michigan Historical Marker was installed at the park, a [[bronze]] [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] bearing the names of those killed and a brief description of events.<ref name="Ashlee">Laura Rose Ashlee, ''Traveling Through Time: A Guide To Michigan's Historical Markers''], University of Michigan Press, 2005, p. 1</ref>
* On November 3, 2008, the town announced that tombstones had been donated for Emilie and Robert Bromundt, the last two bombing victims whose graves were still unmarked. A grant from a foundation paid for the grave markers.<ref name="victims remembered"/>

====In media and the arts====
In 1928, artist [[Carlton W. Angell]] presented the board with a memorial [[statue]] titled ''Girl With a Cat''.<ref name="Michigan History magazine"/> The statue is presently in the Bath School Museum located within the school district's middle school.<ref name = "WXMI"/>

Michael Frederick self-published ''Missouri Madness'' (2001), his novel based on the events in Bath and set in a small town in Missouri in 1927.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Missouri-Madness-Novel-Michael-Frederick/dp/1893794024 Michael Frederick, ''Missouri Madness''], Michael Frederick Productions, 2001, accessed 17 December 2012</ref>
