==Life and Death==
Cossgrove arrived in Port Chalmers, Dunedin on the ''Alpine'' which sailed from Glasgow June 10th 1859 and arrived at Otago on September 12th 1859 with his father, James, mother and 3 brothers.<ref name="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~ourstuff/Alpine.htm"> [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~ourstuff/Alpine.htm Alpine 1859 from ''Otago Witness'' September 1859] </ref>  Mr Cosgrove taught at Sandymount school on the Otago Peninsula between 1874 and 1880.  He is attributed to a rising roll and introducing elementary science to the curriculum.<ref> Sandymount School, Centennial of Inauguration 1870-1970 (Pamphlet) </ref>  While teaching at Sandymount, he married Selina/Celina Robertson in the February of 1875 in the Otago Peninsular Parish, Dunedin. <ref name="http://archives.presbyterian.org.nz/marriageregisters/otagopeninsulamarriages.htm"> [http://archives.presbyterian.org.nz/marriageregisters/otagopeninsulamarriages.htm Otago Peninsular Parish Marriages] </ref> <ref name="http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3C34"> [http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3C34 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Cossgrove, David] </ref> Reports have been made of his student teacher capacity at East Teieri School <ref name="http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3C34"> [http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3C34 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Cossgrove, David] </ref>, however no record can be found of this. <ref> East Taeri School Centennial Pamphlet - list of student teachers </ref>  If 'Uncle David' (see section 2) is David Cossgrove, it can be assumed he moved on to teaching at another Dunedin school (after leaving Sandymount) in the early part of the 1880s.  He was in Westport by 1888 where he took the physical education class at Westport Girls' State School and ran the Naval Cadet Company at Westport Boys' State School. <ref name="Macdonald"> Macdonald, B.

It is known that the Cossgrove had a daughter, Muriel, who asked for a girl's equivalent to [[Scouts]] (for more information see [[GirlGuiding New Zealand]]<ref name="Iles">Iles, Marie (1976) ''65 Years of Guiding in New Zealand'' The Girl Guide Association New Zealand (inc): Christchurch</ref>) and another source lists three older daughters named Catherine, Selina and Elfrida. <ref name="http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3C34"> [http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3C34 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography - Cossgrove, David] </ref>

==Uncle David==
A series of articles were printed in the <i>Otago Witness</i> under the name of Uncle David.

They were dispatched to South Africa soon after arrival in London, despite the lack of basic supplies such as rifles, revolvers, ammunition, picks, shovels, axes, water buckets and bandoleers.  Cossgrove took the men round East London before they travelled to try and do something about the situation.  Making the best of the resources around them:  they bought up the empty wine bottles from various hotels to use for water!<ref name="Crawford, J."> Crawford, J.
