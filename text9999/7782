The '''Western railway line''' is a [[narrow gauge]] (1.067&nbsp;m or 3&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in) [[railway]], connecting the south-east and south-west regions of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. It commences at [[Toowoomba]], at the end of the [[Main Line railway]] from Brisbane, and extends west 810km to [[Cunnamulla]], passing through the major towns of [[Dalby]], [[Roma, Queensland|Roma]] and [[Charleville]]. Queensland was the first railway operator in the world to adopt narrow gauge for a main line,<ref>Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge', Boolarong Publications 1990</ref> and this remains the system wide gauge. 

==History==

The initial section of the Western Line was built from Toowoomba to Dalby, opening 16 April 1868 (the first section of the [[Southern railway line|Southern line]], from Gowrie Junction, about 12 km west of Toowoomba, to [[Warwick]], was opened in 1871, and bypassed in 1915). The line traverses relatively flat, easy country, gradually descending from 590m asl to 343m asl at Dalby.

From Dalby the line was extended to Roma from 1877, opening on 16 September 1880, then to Charleville from 1883, opening 1 March 1888. The line was then extended in a southerly direction, following the Warrego River to Cunnamulla, opening on 10 October 1898. The country is undulating but mostly level, with Roma being 302m asl, Charleville 300m asl, and Cunnamulla 192m asl. 

No significant earthworks were required for the construction of the line west of Dalby, and the rate of construction for all further sections was largely dictated by the annual funding allocations made by the Queensland government of the day.

The line was built to provide reliable transportation to facilitate the development and settlement of the southern Queensland interior by European settlers. It fulfilled that role until the adjacent road network was gradually upgraded to all-weather status from the 1960s-1990s, during which time the line gradually lost most traffic. Despite that, there remains a [[The Westlander|twice weekly passenger service]] as far as Charleville, and seasonal cattle trains from [[Quilpie]] and Cunnamulla. 

In recent years new coal mines near [[Chinchilla]] and Dalby have transported increasing tonnages (1-2M tonnes/month) for export from the Port of Brisbane at Fisherman Islands, which is now the main source of freight on the line. Grain is the other major, though seasonal freight.

===Standard of construction===

Beyond Roma the line remains largely as originally constructed, with light rail (21kg/m, 42lb/yard), 10 tonne axle load and minimal earthworks. East of Roma the line has been upgraded to 15 tonne axle load, but largely retains the original alignment, which results in significant limitations on the maximum line speed.

==Branch lines==

A series of branch lines were built to connect to the Western line, and these are listed from east to west below.

[[Crows Nest railway line|'''Pengarry Junction <U+2013> Crows Nest''']], 55km, opened December 1886, closed 1961.

Although not part of the Western line complex, it is worth noting that the opening of an 18km direct line from Toowoomba to Wyreema on the Southern line in 1915 bypassed the '''Gowrie Junction <U+2013> Wyreema''' section, though that section remained open to serve local traffic until 1961.

[[Haden railway line|'''Kingsthorpe <U+2013> Haden''']], 33km, opened December 1910, closed 1964.

[[Oakey<U+2013>Cooyar railway line|'''Oakey - Cooyar''']], 63km, opened April 1913, closed 1964.

[[Cecil Plains railway line|'''Oakey - Cecil Plains''']], 63km, opened April 1919, out of service since 1991.

[[Jandowae railway line|'''Dalby <U+2013> Jandowae''']], 48km, opened August 1914, this line services a significant grain growing district and was upgraded to 15 tonne axle load in the 1990<U+2019>s.

[[Bell Branch railway line|'''Dalby <U+2013> Bell''']], 38km, opened April 1906, out of service since 1994.

[[Glenmorgan railway line|'''Dalby - Glenmorgan''']], 165km, opened in sections between 1911 and 1931, the main traffic now is grain from Meandarra.

'''Chinchilla <U+2013> Barakula''' This line was built to very light standards, and was legally considered a tramway. Opened in May 1912, it was constructed to provide access to a large forest that would have supplied the 2.5m sleepers estimated to be required for the Great Western Railway proposal. It closed in 1971.

[[Wandoan railway line|'''Miles - Wandoan''']] 70km, opened December 1914. This line was approved to be built to Taroom, a further 60km, but that never occurred. The [[Surat Basin railway|Wandoan-Taroom]] area has significant undeveloped coal deposits, and construction of a line from Wandoan through Taroom to connect with the Moura coal line system has been proposed to provide access to the coal export terminal at Gladstone.

[[Injune railway line|'''Roma <U+2013> Injune''']], opened between 1916 and 30 June 1920, 101km, closed 31 December 1966

'''Westgate <U+2013> Quilpie''', 201km. In 1910 the Queensland government adopted a significant plan to build a railway on the Queensland section of the alignment proposed from Bourke in western NSW, to Darwin in the NT, known as the [[Great Western Railway, Queensland|<U+2018>Great Western Railway<U+2019>]]. To connect to that alignment, construction began in 1911 from Westgate (21km south of Charleville) in a westerly direction. The First World War hampered construction, which ceased in April 1917, making Quilpie the effective terminus. Despite suggestions after the war that construction be recommended, the GWR project was never re-activated. Quilpie (population 560) became the loading point for significant numbers of cattle from western areas. The line is still known as the Great Western line by QR.
