'''Samuel Levi Tomkins''' (born 23 March 1989) is an [[England|English]] professional [[rugby league]] footballer who plays for the [[Wigan Warriors]] in [[Super League]].

Tomkins was born in [[Milton Keynes]]. After his family moved [[Northern England|north]] in the early 1990s, he started playing for the Chorley Panthers amateur club when he was aged seven. In order to develop his career further, Tomkins' family moved to [[Wigan]] where he played for [[Wigan St Patricks|Wigan St. Patricks]], before receiving a scholarship from the [[Wigan Warriors]] with whom he signed a full-time contract at the end of 2007. In 2008 he played for Wigan Warriors in the [[2008 Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]], becoming the first rugby league player to score five tries in a first-grade debut. He is the younger brother of [[Joel Tomkins]], another rugby league footballer playing for the Wigan Warriors.

2009 would prove to be Tomkins' breakthrough year. He made his league debut against [[Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]] and made 27 appearances during the season, scoring 15 tries. He established himself as Wigan's first choice [[Rugby league positions#Stand-off|stand-off]], and was named in the [[Super League Dream Team]], as well as receiving the club's own Player of the Year and the Super League's Young Player of the Year awards. In 2010, Tomkins switched from stand-off to [[Rugby league positions#Fullback|fullback]] under Wigan's new head coach [[Michael Maguire (rugby league)|Michael Maguire]], also appearing occasionally at [[Rugby league positions#Scrum-half|scrum-half]]. That season, Wigan won its first league title since 1998; it was Tomkins' first honour as a player. Appearing in every game of Wigan's 2010 season, he retained his place in the Dream Team, and also received the [[Rugby League International Federation]]'s Rookie of the Year award.

Tomkins scored a hat-trick against [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] during his international debut, and appeared a further three times for [[England national rugby league team|England]] in 2009 at the [[2009 Rugby League Four Nations|Four Nations]], in which he played in the tournament's final. In a [[Test match (rugby league)|Test match]] mid-way through the 2010 season, Tomkins equalled the record for most tries scored in a single match by an England player when he scored four against [[France national rugby league team|France]]. In the [[2010 Rugby League Four Nations|Four Nations later that year]], Tomkins appeared in all three of England's matches as the team failed to progress past the first round. He also participated for England in the inaugural [[International Origin Match|International Origin]] against the [[Exiles rugby league team|Exiles]] in 2011.

== Club career ==
===Debut season===

When Wigan agreed to release the [[Rugby league positions#Stand-off|stand-off]] [[Trent Barrett]] from his contract, the club looked to find a long-term replacement.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = What they bring is an enthusiasm and energy to the squad, and some older players have fed off that. You look at Sam and he's a big threat. It is like, 'Gosh. Look at this kid, he just plays'. That raw energy spills over to other people because the youngsters are happy to be there. There aren't many veterans in the squad, it is a pretty young team. But they've sparked other people up and we've seen that against Harlequins and Bradford.
