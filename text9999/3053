'''Andrew Stuart Murray McCall''' (born 10 June 1964), usually known as '''Stuart McCall''', is a former Scottish [[association football|footballer]] who played in [[midfielder|central midfield]]. He is now a football [[coach (sports)|manager]], in charge of [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]].

He started his professional career with Bradford City, where he made his senior debut in 1982. He played six seasons at [[Valley Parade]], during which time he won the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] championship, a title which was overshadowed by the [[Bradford fire|Bradford fire disaster]] when 56 people died and in which his father [[Andy McCall (footballer born 1925)|Andy]] was injured. After missing out on promotion in [[1987-88 in English football|1987&ndash;88]] he moved to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], for whom he scored twice but finished on the losing side in the [[1989 FA Cup Final]]. In 1991 he moved to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], with whom he spent seven seasons and won six [[Scottish Premier League|league]] titles, three [[Scottish Cup]]s and two [[Scottish League Cup]]s. He returned to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] as captain to take them into the [[Premier League|top division]] of English football for the first time in 77 years. After four seasons he moved to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], where he retired as a player in 2005. McCall also won 40 [[cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and scored one goal in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy. He played in two [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]] but his international career ended after he was left out of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] squad.

He was part of the coaching staff during his second spell at Bradford City, briefly serving as caretaker/player manager in 2000. He continued his coaching at Sheffield United and was assistant manager to [[Neil Warnock]] until May 2007, when he returned to Bradford City for a third time, this time as manager on 1 June 2007.

In his first season at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in [[1992-93 in Scottish football|1992&ndash;93]], winning both cups 2&ndash;1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league.<ref name="rangers history">{{cite web

The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], but they failed to reach the final of either domestic cup. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], in [[1995-96 in Scottish football|1995&ndash;96]], Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] 5&ndash;1. Rangers again pushed Celtic into second place in [[1996-97 in Scottish football|1996&ndash;97]] and defeated Hearts 4&ndash;3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in [[1997-98 in Scottish football|1997&ndash;98]] they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by just two points on the final day of the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.<ref name="rangers history"/>

In February 2008, McCall became the 71st inductee into the Rangers hall of fame. McCall's former teammate and Rangers assistant manager [[Ally McCoist]] presented him with the award.<ref>{{cite news
