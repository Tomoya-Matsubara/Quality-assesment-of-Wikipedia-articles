The museum is privately owned by the Ropkey family. It stems from the founder Fred Ropkey's interest in military history and his past career as a Tank Platoon Leader in the [[US Marine Corps]] during the early 1950s.<ref >{{Cite web

The museum collection is primarily of [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]]s. These range from such rarities as a [[First World War]] [[Six Ton Tank M1917|M1917]] to a contemporary [[M109 howitzer|M109]] self-propelled howitzer.
