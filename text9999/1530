'''William Franklin''' "'''Billy'''" '''Graham, Jr.''' (born November 7, 1918) is an American [[evangelical Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]], ordained as a Southern Baptist minister, who rose to celebrity status with national media backing of [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Henry Luce]] in 1949. His [[sermon]]s were broadcast on radio and television. 

Graham is notable for having been a spiritual adviser to several [[President of the United States|United States Presidents]]; he was particularly close to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Richard M. Nixon]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D61E3AF93AA35751C1A964958260|title=The Transition; Billy Graham to lead Prayers|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=December 9, 1992|accessdate=December 24, 2007}}</ref> During the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights movement]], he began to support integrated seating for his revivals and crusades; in 1957 he invited Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] to jointly preach at a huge revival in [[New York City]], where they appeared together at [[Madison Square Garden]], and bailed the minister out of jail in the 1960s when he was arrested in demonstrations. 

Having built an evangelical empire and organized huge events worldwide, Graham has personally preached [[Good news (Christianity)|the Gospel]] to more people than any other person in history. His institutions include a variety of media and publishing outlets.<ref name="cincinnati post">{{cite news |title= BILLY GRAHAM: A MAN WITH A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.(SPECIAL SECTION) |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87912863.html|author=Barry M.

As of 2008, Graham's estimated lifetime audience, including radio and television broadcasts, topped 2.2 billion.<ref name="cincinnati post"/>

With his renown and international travel, Graham has repeatedly been on [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll|Gallup's list of most admired men and women]], and in 1999 was ranked as number seven for the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.gallup.com/poll/3367/mother-teresa-voted-american-people-most-admired-person-century.aspx] Gallup.com list of admired people for the 20th century</ref>

==Early life==
Named after his father and born November 7, 1918, he is the first son of Morrow Coffey (1892<U+2013>1981) and William Franklin Graham, Sr. (1888<U+2013>1962); he grew up on the family dairy farm farm near [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. Called Billy, he was raised in the [[Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church]] by his parents and was of Scottish descent.<ref>James E. Kilgore, ''Billy Graham, The Preacher,'' Exposition Press, 1968</ref><ref>David George Mullan, ''Narratives of the Religious Self in Early-Modern Scotland,'' Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010, p27</ref> In 1933, when [[Prohibition in the United States]] ended, Graham's father forced Billy and his sister Katherine to drink beer until they got sick, which created such an aversion that both avoided alcohol and drugs the rest of their lives.<ref name="time1993">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N. Ostling, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979573,00.html "God's Billy Pulpit"], ''Time'', November 15, 1993. [accessdate November 7, 2011]</ref> 

After Graham was turned down for membership in a local youth group because he was "too worldly,"<ref name="time1993"/> Albert McMakin, who worked on the Graham farm, persuaded the youth to go see [[Mordecai Ham]], an evangelist.<ref name="cincinnati post"/> According to his autobiography, Graham was converted in 1934 at age 16 during a series of revival meetings in Charlotte led by the evangelist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/faq/13.htm |title=Who led Billy Graham to Christ... |publisher=Archives, Billy Graham Center, Wheaton College |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref>

After graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936, Graham attended [[Bob Jones University|Bob Jones College]], located in [[Cleveland, Tennessee]]. After one semester, he found it too legalistic in both coursework and rules.<ref name="time1993"/> At this time, he was influenced and inspired by Pastor Charley Young from Eastport Bible Church. He was almost expelled, but [[Bob Jones, Sr.]] warned him not to throw his life away: "At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks.... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily."<ref name="time1993"/> 

In 1937, Graham transferred to the Florida Bible Institute (now [[Trinity College (Florida)|Trinity College of Florida]]). (Today's [[Florida College]] is now located at that site in [[Temple Terrace, Florida]].) In his autobiography, Graham wrote of receiving his "calling on the 18th green of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club," which is immediately in front of today's Sutton Hall at Florida College. Reverend Billy Graham Memorial Park was established on the [[Hillsborough River]] directly east of the 18th green and across from where Graham often paddled a canoe to a small island in the river, where he would preach to the birds, alligators, and cypress stumps. Graham eventually graduated from [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] in [[Wheaton, Illinois]] with a degree in [[anthropology]] in 1943.<ref>[http://www.wheaton.edu/academics/departments/socio Sociology and Anthropology Department] <U+2013> wheaton.edu</ref> 

It was during his time at Wheaton that Graham decided to accept the [[Bible]] as the [[infallibility|infallible]] word of God. [[Henrietta Mears]] of the [[First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood (Hollywood, California)]] was instrumental in helping Graham wrestle with the issue. He settled it at Forest Home Christian camp (now called Forest Home Ministries) southeast of the [[Big Bear Lake, California|Big Bear area]] in [[Southern California]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} A memorial there marks the site of Graham's decision.

==Family==
On August 13, 1943, Graham married Wheaton classmate [[Ruth Graham|Ruth Bell]] (1920<U+2013>2007), whose parents were [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[missionary|missionaries]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]].  Her father [[L. Nelson Bell]] was a general surgeon. Graham met Ruth at Wheaton: "I saw her walking down the road towards me and I couldn't help but stare at her as she walked. She looked at me and our eyes met and I felt that she was definitely the woman I wanted to marry." Ruth thought that he "wanted to please God more than any man I'd ever met."<ref name="satevepost">{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4151300.html |title=Billy Graham: the world is his pulpit |work=Saturday Evening Post |author= Stoddard, Maynard Good |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=March 1, 1986 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref> They married two months after graduation and later lived in a [[log cabin]] designed by Ruth in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] in [[Montreat, North Carolina]].<ref name="time1993"/> Ruth died on June 14, 2007, at the age of 87.

They had five children together: Virginia Leftwich (Gigi) Graham Tchividjian (born 1945); [[Anne Graham Lotz]] (born 1948; runs AnGeL ministries); Ruth Graham (born 1950; founder and president of Ruth Graham & Friends); [[Franklin Graham]] (born 1952; administers an international relief organization called [[Samaritan's Purse]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritanspurse.org/ |title=Samaritan's Purse |publisher=Samaritanspurse.org |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref> and will be his father's successor at the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]]); and Nelson Edman Graham (born 1958; a pastor who runs East Gates International,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastgates.org/awordfrombg.html |title=East Gates International |publisher=Eastgates.org |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2011}} {{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> which distributes Christian literature in China.) Graham has 19 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren. His grandson [[Tullian Tchividjian]] is senior pastor of [[Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church]] in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]].

To ensure no one mistook his actions, Graham had a policy to avoid being alone with any woman other than his wife Ruth. This has come to be known as the Billy Graham Rule.<ref>{{cite book|last=Olasky|first=Marvin|title=Salt, not sugar: twenty years of WORLD-class reporting|year=2006|publisher=[[World (magazine)|WORLD]]|page=78|author-link=Marvin Olasky}}</ref>

==Ministry==

===Career===
While attending college, Graham became pastor of the United Gospel Tabernacle and also had other preaching engagements.

Graham served briefly as pastor of the Village Church in [[Western Springs, Illinois]], not far from Wheaton, in 1943-44. While there, his friend [[Torrey Johnson]], pastor of the Midwest Bible Church in [[Chicago]], told Graham that his radio program "Songs in the Night" was about to be canceled for lack of funding. Consulting with the members of his church in Western Springs, Graham decided to take over Johnson's program with financial support from his parishioners. Launching the new radio program on January 2, 1944, still called ''Songs in the Night'', Graham recruited the [[baritone]] [[George Beverly Shea]] as his director of radio ministry. While the radio ministry continued for many years, Graham decided to move on in early 1945.  In 1947, at age 30, he was hired as president of [[Northwestern College (Minnesota)|Northwestern Bible College]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], the youngest person to serve as college president. Graham served as the president of Northwestern Bible College from 1948 to 1952.<ref name="books.google.com">[http://books.google.com/books?id=NvTR05fodqYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false "Farewell to God: My Reasons for Rejecting the Christian Faith"].</ref>

Initially, Graham intended to become a [[chaplain]] in the [[armed forces]] but, shortly after applying for a commission, contracted [[mumps]]. After a period of recuperation in [[Florida]], Graham was hired as the first full-time [[evangelism|evangelist]] of the new [[Youth for Christ International]] (YFCI), co-founded by Torrey Johnson and the Canadian evangelist [[Charles Templeton]]. Graham traveled throughout both the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] as an YFCI evangelist. Unlike many evangelists, Graham had little formal theological training.  Templeton applied to [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] for an advanced theological degree and urged Graham to do so as well, but the evangelist declined. He was already serving as the president of Northwestern Bible College.<ref name="time1993"/><ref name="books.google.com"/>

===Hearst bubble ===
Graham scheduled a series of [[revival meeting]]s in [[Los Angeles]] in 1949, for which he erected [[circus]] tents in a parking lot.<ref name="cincinnati post"/> He was given national coverage by the news mogul [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Scholars such as Ben Bagdikian believe that Hearst liked Graham's patriotism and appeals to youth; he thought the evangelist would help promote Hearst's conservative anti-communist views.<ref>"In 1949, for example, William Randolph Hearst, head of one large publishing empire, and Henry Luce, chief of another, Time, Inc., were both worried about communism and the growth of liberalism in the United States." "Hearst and Luce interviewed the obscure preacher [Graham] and decided he was worthy of their support. Billy Graham became an almost instantaneous national and, later, international figure preaching anticommunism. In late 1949, Hearst sent a telegram to all Hearst editors: "Puff Graham." The editors did<U+2014>in Hearst newspapers, magazines, movies, and newsreels. Within two months Graham was preaching to crowds of 350,000." (from Ben Bagdikian, ''The Media Monopoly'', Boston, Mass: Beacon Press, 2000 6th ed., p. 39 ff)</ref> The scholar Randall E. King notes that Hearst and Graham never met.<ref name="worldscollide">{{cite news |title= When worlds collide: politics, religion, and media at the 1970 East Tennessee Billy Graham Crusade |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19592304.html|author=Randall E.

===Crusades===
Billy Graham has conducted many revivals since 1948 and in the next decade, began to call them crusades, after the medieval Christian forces who tried to conquer Jerusalem. In 1959, he led his first crusade, which was in [[London]].  He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions got larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir.  He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward (a practice begun by [[Dwight L. Moody]]). Such people were called inquirers and were given the chance to speak one-on-one with a counselor, to clarify questions and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Moscow]] in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name="time1993"/>  During his crusades, he has frequently used the [[altar call]] song, "[[Just as I Am (hymn)#Altar Song in the Billy Graham crusades|Just As I Am]]".<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/billy-graham-and-the-last-crusade-496477.html], ''The Independent'' (UK)</ref>

Graham was offered a five-year, $5 million contract from [[NBC]] to appear on television opposite [[Arthur Godfrey]], but he turned it down in favor of continuing his touring revivals because of his prearranged commitments.<ref name="satevepost"/> Graham had missions in [[London]], which lasted 12 weeks, and a [[New York City]] mission in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] in 1957, which ran nightly for 16 weeks.

====Billy Graham Evangelistic Association====
In 1950, Graham founded the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] with its headquarters in [[Minneapolis]]. The association later relocated to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. BGEA Ministries have included:
* ''[[Hour of Decision]]'', a weekly radio program broadcast around the world for more than 50 years
* Mission television specials broadcast in almost every market in the US and Canada
* A syndicated newspaper column, ''My Answer'', carried by [[newspaper]]s across the United States and distributed by [[Tribune Media Services]]
* ''Decision'' magazine, the official publication of the Association
* ''[[Christianity Today]]'' was started in 1956 with [[Carl F. H. Henry]] as its first editor
* [http://www.passageway.org Passageway.org], the website for a children's program created by BGEA
* [[World Wide Pictures]], which has produced and distributed more than 130 films

====Civil rights movement====
[[File:Billy Graham & Martin Luther King.jpg|thumb|Graham with Martin Luther King]]
Graham had shown little concern for [[racial segregation|segregation]] until the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights movement]] began to receive national attention in the early 1950s.  Many of his early crusades were segregated. In response to the civil rights movement, Graham began to adjust his approach but was inconsistent, refusing to speak in some segregated auditoriums, while speaking to segregated audiences at others. In 1953 he tore down the ropes that organizers had erected to separate the audience into racial sections; he recounted in his memoirs that he told two ushers to leave the barriers down "or you can go on and have the revival without me.".<ref>Steven Patrick Miller, ''Billy Graham and the Rise of the Republican South'' (University of Pennsylvania, 2009), 28.</ref> But, he later acceded to segregated seating at [[Dallas, Texas]] and [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. He sometimes preached that the Bible said nothing about segregation,<ref>Michael G Long, ed., ''The Legacy of Billy Graham: Critical Reflections on America's Greatest Evangelist'', (Westminster/John Knox Press, 2008), 150<U+2013>151</ref> but another time warned a white audience, "we have been proud and thought we were better than any other race, any other people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to stumble into hell because of our pride."<ref>Miller (2009), ''Rise of the Republican South'', p. 30.</ref> After the 1954 [[US Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that public school segregation was unconstitutional, Graham insisted on integrated seating at his revivals. His inconsistent approach in the early years has led to differing assessments by historians of his career and complicated his legacy.<ref>Miller (2009), ''Rise of the Republican South'', pp. 26-30.</ref>

From the mid-1950s on, Graham became increasingly opposed to segregation and racism, while keeping his eye on public opinion. For instance, in 1957 he invited Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] to join him in the pulpit at his 16-week revival in New York City, where 2.3 million gathered at [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], and [[Times Square]] to hear them.<ref name="cincinnati post"/> Graham never appeared publicly again with King, but he posted bail for the minister to get him released from jail in 1963 during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights protests]] in Birmingham.<ref>Long (2008), ''Critical Reflections'', pp. 150<U+2013>151</ref> 

Graham's faith prompted his maturing view of race and segregation; the minister told one member of the [[KKK]] that integration was necessary primarily for religious reasons: "there is no scriptural basis for segregation," Graham argued, "The ground at the foot of the cross is level, and it touches my heart when I see whites standing shoulder to shoulder with blacks at the cross."<ref name="baptisthistory">{{cite news |title= Billy Graham: an appreciation |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87912863.html|publisher=''Baptist History and Heritage'' |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2007}}</ref>

==Later years==
[[File:Billy Graham.JPG|thumb|right|Graham with his son, Franklin, at [[Cleveland Stadium]], June 1994]]

Graham's visibility and popularity extended into the secular world. He created his own pavilion for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].<ref name=IN70>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/5th_dimension/chapters/credits.htm |title="Man in the 5th Dimension," In 70mm News / The 70mm Newsletter |publisher=In70mm.com |date=March 6, 2005 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref> He appeared as a guest on a 1969 [[Woody Allen]] television special, where he joined the comedian in a witty exchange on theological matters.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite book|url= http://books.google.com/?id=xS9f-DI5ag4C&pg=PA52&dq=billy+graham+woody+allen&cd=9#v=onepage&q=billy%20graham%20woody%20allen | title= Love, Sex, Death & The Meaning of Life: The Films of Woody Allen |author=Foster Hirsch | publisher=Da Capo Press | page=52 | year=200 | isbn= 0-306-81017-4}}</ref>
During the [[Cold War]], Graham became the first evangelist of note to speak behind the [[Iron Curtain]], addressing large crowds in countries throughout [[Eastern Europe]] and in the [[Soviet Union]], calling for [[peace]].<ref>Duffy, Michael and Gibbs, Nancy. ''TIME. [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1627139,00.html "Billy Graham: A Spiritual Gift to All"], ''TIME'', 31 May 2007, Retrieved 2007-24-11.</ref> During the [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] era, Graham consistently refused to visit [[South Africa]] until its government allowed integrated seating for audiences. During his first crusade there in 1973, he openly denounced [[apartheid]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Billy Graham in het Feyenoord stadion.ogg|thumb|left|Billy Graham at the Feyenoord-stadion in Rotterdam, The Netherlands (June 30, 1955)]]
In 1984, he led a series of summer meetings in the [[United Kingdom]], called Mission England, using outdoor football grounds as venues.

Graham was interested in fostering evangelism around the world. In 1983, 1986 and 2000 he sponsored, organized and paid for massive training conferences for Christian evangelists from around the world; with the largest representations of nations ever held until that time. Over 157 nations were gathered in 2000 at the [[Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre|RAI Convention Center]] in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].  At one revival in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], Graham attracted more than one million people to a single service.<ref name="satevepost"/> He appeared in [[China]] in 1988<U+2014>for Ruth, this was a homecoming, since she had been born in China to missionary parents. He appeared in [[North Korea]] in 1992.<ref name="baptisthistory"/>

On September 22, 1991 Graham held his largest event in [[North America]] on [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond, Central Park|the Great Lawn]] of New York's [[Central Park]]. City officials estimated over 250,000 in attendance. In 1998, Graham spoke at [[TED (conference)]] to a crowd of scientists and philosophers.

On September 14, 2001, in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], Graham was invited to lead a service at [[Washington National Cathedral]], which was attended by President [[George W. Bush]] and past and present leaders. He also spoke at the memorial service following the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995.<ref name="baptisthistory"/> On June 24<U+2013>26, 2005, Billy Graham began what he has said would be his last North American crusade, three days at the [[Flushing Meadows<U+2013>Corona Park]] in New York City. But on the weekend of March 11<U+2013>12, 2006, Billy Graham held the "Festival of Hope" with his son, [[Franklin Graham]]. The [[festival]] was held in [[New Orleans]], which was recovering from [[Hurricane Katrina]].

==Retirement==
Graham said that his planned [[retirement]] was because of his failing health. He has suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] for about 15 years, has had [[hydrocephalus]], [[pneumonia]], broken hips, and [[prostate cancer]]. In August 2005, a frail Graham appeared at the groundbreaking for his library in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. Then 86, Reverend Graham used a walker during the ceremony. On July 9, 2006, Graham spoke at the [[Metro Maryland Youth For Christ|Metro Maryland Franklin Graham Festival]], held in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]].

There had been controversy over his proposed burial place; he announced in June 2007 that he and his wife would be buried alongside each other at the [[Billy Graham Library]] in his hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. Graham's younger son Ned had argued with older son Franklin about whether burial at a library would be appropriate. [[Ruth Graham]] had said that she wanted to be buried not in Charlotte but in the mountains near [[Asheville, North Carolina]], where she had lived for many years; Ned supported his mother's choice.<ref name="washpostburial">{{cite news |title= A Family at Cross-Purposes |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/12/AR2006121201338.html|publisher=''Washington Post'' |date=December 13, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2007 }}</ref> Novelist [[Patricia Cornwell]], a family friend, also opposed burial at the library, calling it a tourist attraction. Franklin wanted his parents to be buried at the library site.<ref name="washpostburial"/> At the time of Ruth Graham's death, it was announced that they would be buried at the library site.

Graham has been admitted to the hospital for treatment in 2007 and 2011.<ref name="ABC12.com">''ABC12.com'', [http://abclocal.go.com/wjrt/story?section=nation_world&id=5582690 ''Evangelist Billy Graham hospitalized''], August 19, 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42996142/ns/us_news-life/ |title=Billy Graham hospitalized with pneumonia |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref>

In April 2010, Graham, at 91 and with substantial vision and hearing loss, made a rare public appearance at the re-dedication of the renovated Billy Graham Library.<ref>Tim Funk, [http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/04/21/92603/lion-in-winter-billy-graham-hearing.html "Lion in Winter: Billy Graham, Hearing and Sight Failing, Pays a Visit"] Charlotte Observer, April 2010.</ref> 

Billy Graham has preached [[Christianity]] to live audiences of nearly 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories through various meetings, including [[BMS World Mission]] and [[Global Mission]]. Graham has also reached hundreds of millions more through television, video, film, and webcasts.<ref>[http://www.billygraham.org/mediaRelations/bios.asp?p=1 Billy Graham Evangelistic Association] Billy Graham Bio</ref>

==Politics==
Politically, Graham is a registered member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name="nbcinterv2005">{{cite news |title= Rev.

He refused to join [[Jerry Falwell]]'s [[Moral Majority]] in 1979, saying: "I'm for morality, but morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice. We as clergy know so very little to speak with authority on the [[Panama Canal]] or superiority of armaments. Evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person. We have to stand in the middle in order to preach to all people, right and left. I haven't been faithful to my own advice in the past. I will be in the future."<ref name="baptisthistory"/>

According to a 2006 ''[[Newsweek]]'' interview, "For Graham, politics is a secondary to the Gospel.... When ''Newsweek'' asked Graham whether ministers<U+2014>whether they think of themselves as evangelists, pastors or a bit of both<U+2014>should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the [[Names of God|Lord]], I'm sure, but I think you have some<U+2014>like [[communism]], or [[Racial segregation|segregation]], on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out.'".<ref name="newsweek2006p4">{{cite news |title= Pilgrim's Progress, page 4 |url= http://www.newsweek.com/id/46365/page/4|publisher=''Newsweek'' |date=August 14, 2006 |accessdate=September 20, 2008 }}</ref>

Graham has had a personal audience with many sitting [[president of the United States|US presidents]] from [[Harry S. Truman]] to [[Barack Obama]]. Presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Bill Clinton]] sought his counsel, as did the [[Bush family]].<ref name="time100"/> After meeting with Truman in 1950, Graham told the press he had urged the president to counter [[communism]] in [[North Korea]]. Later he always treated his conversations with presidents as confidential.<ref name="worldscollide"/>  Truman disliked him and did not speak with him for years after that meeting.<ref name="time1993"/> Graham was criticized by some for being too attracted to the seat of political power.

Merle Miller quotes Truman on Graham in his oral biography ''Plain Speaking'':<blockquote>But now we've got just this one evangelist, this Billy Graham, and he's gone off the beam. He's...well, I hadn<U+2019>t ought to say this, but he<U+2019>s one of those counterfeits I was telling you about. He claims he's a friend of all the Presidents, but he was never a friend of mine when I was President. I just don<U+2019>t go for people like that. All he's interested in is getting his name in the paper.<ref>Miller, Merle (1974) Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry S. Truman. New York: Putnam. p. 363.</ref></blockquote>

Graham became a regular visitor during the tenure of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].  He purportedly urged him to intervene with federal troops in the case of the [[Little Rock Nine]] to gain admission of black students to public schools.<ref name="time1993"/> At that time he met and would become close friends with Vice President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name="worldscollide"/> After a special law was passed in 1952, Graham conducted the first [[Worship|religious service]] on the steps of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]].<ref name="time1993"/> Eisenhower asked for Graham while on his [[death]]bed.<ref name="washpost1991">{{cite news |title= The President Preacher; In Crisis, White House Turns to Billy Graham |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1044879.html|publisher=''The Washington Post'' |date=January 18, 1991 |accessdate=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>

After Nixon's victorious [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential campaign]], Graham became an adviser, regularly visiting the White House and leading the president's private worship services.<ref name="worldscollide"/> In a meeting they had with [[Golda Meir]], Nixon offered Graham the ambassadorship to [[Israel]], but he refused.<ref name="time1993"/> In 1970 Nixon appeared at a Graham revival in [[East Tennessee]], which they thought safe politically.  It drew one of the largest crowds in Tennessee and protesters against the Vietnam War. Nixon was the first president to give a speech from an evangelist's platform.<ref name="worldscollide"/> Their friendship became strained in 1973 when Graham rebuked Nixon for his post-[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] behavior and the profanity heard on the [[Watergate tapes]];<ref name = Maseko>{{Cite book | author = Achim Nkosi Maseko | title = Church Schism & Corruption | url = http://books.google.pl/books?id=gC93bLKtMqMC&pg=PA399&lpg=PA399&dq=%22Gerald+R.+Ford%22+funeral+%22Billy+Graham%22&source=bl&ots=87bhk6fVwD&sig=0Hw580v1EcQBr9uRnsISD62O-KE&hl=pl&ei=3KPaTobXBMPz-gb0-uzoDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&sqi=2&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22Gerald%20R.%20Ford%22%20funeral%20%22Billy%20Graham%22&f=false | publisher = | location = Durban | year = 2008 | page = 399 | isbn = 978-1-4092-2186-9}}</ref> they eventually reconciled after Nixon's resignation.<ref name="worldscollide"/>

Graham officiated at one presidential burial and one presidential funeral. He presided over the graveside services of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973 and took part in eulogizing the former president. Graham officiated at the funeral services of former First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] in 1993<ref name="time1993"/> and the [[Death and funeral of Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon]] in 1994.  
[[File:Billy Graham with Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|Billy Graham meeting with President Barack Obama in Montreat, 2010]]
On April 25, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] visited Rev.

===Foreign policy views===
Graham has been outspoken against [[communism]] and supportive of US [[Cold War]] policy, including the [[Vietnam War]]. In a 1999 speech, Graham discussed his relationship with the late [[North Korea]]n dictator [[Kim Il-sung]], praising him as a "different kind of communist" and "one of the great fighters for freedom in his country against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]." Graham went on to note that although he had never met Kim's son and former North Korean [[dictator]] [[Kim Jong-il]], he had "exchanged gifts with him."<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2553945.ece Preacher power: America's God squad] Independent Article,''Preacher power: America's God squad'', July 25, 2007</ref> Graham gave a globe surmounted with doves to the North Korean Friendship Museum.<ref name = Maseko/>

In March 1991, Graham said in reference to the Persian [[Gulf War]], "As our President, President Bush, has said, it is not the people of [[Iraq]] we are at war with. It is some of the people in that regime. Pray for peace in the [[Middle East]], a just peace."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://procinwarn.com/billy.htm |title=Quotation of section |publisher=Procinwarn.com |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref> Graham had earlier said that "there come times when we have to fight for peace." He went on to say that out of the war in the Gulf may "come a new peace and, as suggested by the President, a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]]."<ref>[given source: March 1991 CIB Bulletin]</ref>

==Controversy==

=== Discussion of Jews with Nixon ===
During the Watergate affair, there were suggestions that Graham had agreed with many of Nixon's anti-Semitic opinions, but he denied them and stressed his efforts to build bridges to the Jews. In 2002, the controversy was renewed when declassified "[[Nixon White House tapes|Richard Nixon tapes]]" confirmed remarks made by Graham to [[President Nixon]] three decades earlier.<ref name="nytimes03172002">[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/17/us/billy-graham-responds-to-lingering-anger-over-1972-remarks-on-jews.html Billy Graham Responds to Lingering Anger Over 1972 Remarks on Jews], ''New York Times'', March 17, 2002</ref> Captured on the tapes, Graham agreed with Nixon that [[Antisemitic canard#Accusations of controlling the media|Jews control]] the [[Media of the United States|American media]], calling it a "stranglehold" during a 1972 conversation with Nixon.<ref name="bbcregret">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1850077.stm Graham regrets Jewish slur] [[BBC]], ''Graham Regrets Jewish Slur'', March 2, 2002</ref> He went considerably beyond that in offensive remarks characterized as [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] by [[Abraham Foxman]] of the [[Anti-Defamation League]]<ref name="nytimes03172002"/> and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] author [[Richard Land]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20090625/confronting-graham-s-demons/index.html |title=Christian Post |publisher=Christian Post |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref> 

When the tapes were made public, Graham apologized <ref>[http://www.ujc.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=32770 Graham Apology Not Enough] Eric J Greenberg, [[United Jewish Communities]]</ref><ref name="newsweek1">{{cite news |title= Pilgrim's Progress, page 5 |url= http://www.newsweek.com/id/46365/page/5|publisher=''Newsweek'' |date=August 14, 2006 |accessdate=September 20, 2008 }}</ref> and said, "Although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I apparently made in an Oval Office conversation with President Nixon ... some 30 years ago (...). They do not reflect my views and I sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks."<ref name="associatedpress-belief">{{cite news |title= Billy Graham apologizes for anti-Semitic comments in 1972 conversation with Nixon |url= http://www.beliefnet.com/News/2002/03/Billy-Graham-Apologizes-For-Anti-Semitic-Comments-In-1972-Conversation-With-Nixon.aspx|publisher=''BeliefNet'' |author= Christopher Newton (Associated Press Writer) |date=March 2, 2002 |accessdate=April 28, 2012 }}</ref> According to ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, "[T]he shock of the revelation was magnified because of Graham's longtime support of [[Israel]] and his refusal to join in calls for conversion of the Jews."<ref name="newsweek1"/>

In 2009, more Nixon tapes were released, in which Graham is heard in conversation with Nixon referring to Jews and "the synagogue of [[Satan]]." A spokesman for Graham said that Graham has never been an anti-Semite and that the comparison (in accord with the context of the quotation in the [[Book of Revelation]]) was directed specifically at those claiming to be Jews, but not holding to traditional Jewish values.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-06-24-graham-tapes_N.htm|title=In Nixon tapes, Billy Graham refers to 'synagogue of Satan'|author=Cathy Lynn Grossman|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=July 31, 2009 | date=June 24, 2009}}</ref>

=== Fundamentalists ===
After Crusade in New York (1957) fundamentalists criticized Graham for his [[ecumenism]] (he was even called "Antichrist").<ref name="Wirt">{{Cite book | author = Sherwood Eliot Wirt | title = Billy: A Personal Look at Billy Graham, the World's Best-loved Evangelist | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton, Illinois | year = 1997 | page = 97 | isbn = 0-89107-934-3 | accessdate =January 16, 2011}}</ref>
