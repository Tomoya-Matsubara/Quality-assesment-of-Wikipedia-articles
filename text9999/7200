'''Bob Dylan''' (born '''Robert Allen Zimmerman'''; May 24, 1941) is an American [[singer-songwriter]] who has been a major figure in music for five decades.<ref name = "Newsweek97"/> Much of his most celebrated work dates from the [[1960s in music|1960s]] when he was an informal chronicler, and an apparently reluctant figurehead, of social unrest. A number of his songs such as "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" became anthems for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|US civil rights]]<ref>Dylan sang "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" at the Washington D.C. concert, January 20, 1986, which marked the inauguration of [[Martin Luther King Day]].

Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the ''[[Never Ending Tour]]''. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.<ref name = "Newsweek97">{{cite web| url = http://www.newsweek.com/1997/10/05/dylan-revisited.html| title = Dylan Revisited| author = Gates, David| date = October 6, 1997| accessdate = June 8, 2010| work= Newsweek}}</ref>

His paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from [[Odessa]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Ukraine]]) to the United States following the anti-Semitic [[pogrom]]s of 1905.<ref name = "Sounes-p12">Sounes, ''Down the Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 12<U+2013>13.</ref> His mother's maternal grandparents, Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein, were [[Lithuanian Jews]] who arrived in the United States in 1902.<ref name = "Sounes-p12"/> In his autobiography ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was [[Kyrgyz]] and her family originated from [[Istanbul]].<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 92<U+2013>93.</ref>

Dylan<U+2019>s parents, Abram Zimmerman and Beatrice "Beatty" Stone, were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community. Robert Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age six, when his father was stricken with polio and the family returned to his mother's home town, [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood. Robert Zimmerman spent much of his youth listening to the radio<U+2014>first to [[blues]] and [[American country music|country]] stations broadcasting from [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and, later, to early [[rock and roll]].<ref name = "Shelton-38"/> He formed several bands in high school: The Shadow Blasters was short-lived, but his next, The Golden Chords, lasted longer and played [[Cover version|covers]] of popular songs.<ref>Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref> Their performance of [[Danny and the Juniors]]' "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone off.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 29<U+2013>37.</ref> In his 1959 school yearbook, Robert Zimmerman listed as his ambition "To follow [[Little Richard]]."<ref name = "Shelton-38"/> The same year, using the name Elston Gunnn (sic), he performed two dates with [[Bobby Vee]], playing piano and providing handclaps.<ref name = "Gunnn">An interview with Bobby Vee suggests the young Zimmerman may have been eccentric in spelling his early pseudonym: "[Dylan] was in the Fargo/Moorhead area&nbsp;... Bill [Velline] was in a record shop in Fargo, Sam's Record Land, and this guy came up to him and introduced himself as Elston Gunnn<U+2014>with three n's, G-U-N-N-N."

Zimmerman moved to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] in September 1959 and enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]]. His early focus on rock and roll gave way to an interest in American folk music. In 1985, Dylan explained the attraction that folk music had exerted on him: "The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough&nbsp;... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms&nbsp;... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings."<ref name = "Crowe-1985">[[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], 1985, Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]].</ref> He soon began to perform at the 10 O'clock Scholar, a coffee house a few blocks from campus, and became actively involved in the local [[Dinkytown, USA|Dinkytown]] [[folk music]] circuit.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 65<U+2013>82.</ref><ref name = "No Direction Home">This is related in the documentary film ''[[No Direction Home]]'', Director: [[Martin Scorsese]].

During his Dinkytown days, Zimmerman began introducing himself as "Bob Dylan".<ref>Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 7.</ref> In his autobiography, Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of [[Dylan Thomas]].<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 78<U+2013>79.</ref> Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, Dylan remarked: "You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free."<ref name = "60minutes2005"/>

===1960s===
====Relocation to New York and record deal====
Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his freshman year. In January 1961, he moved to New York City, hoping to perform there and visit his musical idol [[Woody Guthrie]], who was seriously ill with [[Huntington's Disease]] in [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]].<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', p. 98.</ref> Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances. Describing Guthrie's impact on him, Dylan later wrote: "The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them ... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple."<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 244<U+2013>246.</ref> As well as visiting Guthrie in the hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's acolyte [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]. Much of Guthrie's repertoire was actually channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1|Chronicles]]'' (2004).<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 250<U+2013>252.</ref>

From February 1961, Dylan played at various clubs around [[Greenwich Village]]. In September, he eventually gained public recognition when [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] wrote a positive review in ''The New York Times'' of a show at [[Gerde's Folk City]].<ref>Robert Shelton, ''New York Times'', September 21, 1961, "Bob Dylan: A Distinctive Stylist" reproduced online: {{cite web

}}</ref> Hammond signed Dylan to [[Columbia Records]] in October. The performances on his first Columbia album, ''[[Bob Dylan (album)|Bob Dylan]]'' (1962), consisted of familiar folk, blues and [[gospel music|gospel]] material combined with two original compositions. The album made little impact, selling only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even.<ref name = "Scaduto110">Scaduto, ''Bob Dylan'', p. 110.</ref> Within Columbia Records, some referred to the singer as "Hammond's Folly" and suggested dropping his contract. Hammond defended Dylan vigorously. While working for Columbia, Dylan also recorded several songs under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt, for ''[[Broadside Magazine]]'', a folk music magazine and record label.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 157<U+2013>158.</ref>
[[File:Joan Baez Bob Dylan.jpg|thumb|280px|alt=Dylan is seated, singing and playing guitar. Seated to his right is a woman gazing upwards and singing with him.|With [[Joan Baez]] during the civil rights "[[March on Washington]]", August 28, 1963]]

Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962. He legally changed his name to Bob Dylan, and signed a management contract with [[Albert Grossman]]. Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable both for his sometimes confrontational personality, and for the fiercely protective loyalty he displayed towards his principal client.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 283<U+2013>284.</ref> Dylan subsequently said of Grossman, "He was kind of like a [[Colonel Tom Parker]] figure&nbsp;... you could smell him coming."<ref name = "No Direction Home" /> Tensions between Grossman and [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] led to Hammond being replaced as the producer of Dylan's second album by the young [[African American]] jazz producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]].<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 115<U+2013>116.</ref>

From December 1962 to January 1963, Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom.<ref name = "Heylin-p35">Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', pp. 35<U+2013>39.</ref> He had been invited by TV director [[Philip Saville]] to appear in a drama, ''[[The Madhouse on Castle Street]]'', which Saville was directing for [[BBC Television]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/music/bobdylan/madhouse.shtml| title = Dylan in the Madhouse| date = October 14, 2007| accessdate = August 31, 2009| publisher = BBC TV}}</ref> At the end of the play, Dylan performed "Blowin' in the Wind", one of the first major public performances of the song.<ref>Sounes, Howard. Down the Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan. Doubleday 2001. p159. ISBN 0-552-99929-6</ref> While in London, Dylan performed at several London folk clubs, including [[Les Cousins (music club)|Les Cousins]], [[Monto Water Rats|The Pinder of Wakefield]],<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/sep/17/popandrock.folk Web ''Guardian'' newspaper <U+00A9> Guardian News and Media Limited 2009]</ref> and [[Bunjies]].<ref name = "Heylin-p35"/> He also learned new songs from several UK performers, including [[Martin Carthy]].<ref name = "Heylin-p35"/>

By the time Dylan's second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', was released in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as both a singer and a songwriter. Many of the songs on this album were labeled [[protest song]]s, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by [[Pete Seeger]]'s passion for topical songs.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 138<U+2013>142.</ref> "Oxford Town", for example, was a sardonic account of [[James Meredith]]'s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the [[University of Mississippi]].<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 156.</ref>
[[File:Bob Dylan in November 1963.jpg|thumb|left|180px|alt=Dylan with his guitar onstage, laughing and looking downwards.|Bob Dylan in November 1963]]
His most famous song at this time, "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", partially derived its melody from the traditional [[slave]] song "No More Auction Block", while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo.<ref>The booklet by [[John Bauldie]] accompanying Dylan's ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1<U+2013>3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961<U+2013>1991]]'' (1991) says: "Dylan acknowledged the debt in 1978 to journalist Marc Rowland: ''Blowin' In The Wind' has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called 'No More Auction Block'<U+2014>that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' In The Wind follows the same feeling.{{' "}} pp. 6<U+2013>8.</ref> The song was widely recorded and became an international hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], setting a precedent for many other artists who had hits with Dylan's songs. "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]" was based on the tune of the folk ballad "[[Lord Randall]]". With its veiled references to nuclear apocalypse, it gained even more resonance when the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Cuban missile crisis]] developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 101<U+2013>103.</ref> Like "Blowin' in the Wind", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" marked an important new direction in modern songwriting, blending a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]], [[imagist]] lyrical attack with a traditional folk form.<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', pp. 329<U+2013>344.</ref>

|description=''[[Blowin' in the Wind]]'' was, according to critic Andy Gill, "the song with which Dylan's name is most inextricably linked, and safeguarded his reputation as a civil libertarian through any number of changes in style and attitude."<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', 23</ref>
|format=[[Ogg]]}}

While Dylan's topical songs solidified his early reputation, ''Freewheelin''' also included a mixture of love songs and jokey, surreal talking blues. Humor was a large part of Dylan's persona,<ref>Scaduto, ''Bob Dylan'', p. 35.</ref> and the range of material on the album impressed many listeners, including [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said, "We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude<U+2014>it was incredibly original and wonderful."<ref>''Mojo'' magazine, December 1993.</ref>

The rough edge of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some early listeners but an attraction to others. Describing the impact that Dylan had on her and her husband, [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote: "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying."<ref>Hedin (ed.), 2004, ''Studio A: The Bob Dylan Reader'', p. 259.

Others who recorded and had hits with Dylan's songs in the early and mid-1960s included [[The Byrds]], [[Sonny and Cher]], [[The Hollies]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[The Association]], [[Manfred Mann]], and [[The Turtles]]. Most attempted to impart a pop feel and rhythm to the songs, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk pieces. The cover versions became so ubiquitous that [[CBS]] started to promote him with the tag "Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/bob-dylans-songs-offer-rich-pickings-for-other-singers/2007/08/14/1186857512999.html | title = It ain't me babe but I like how it sounds | date = August 15, 2007 | accessdate = September 24, 2008 | last = Meacham | first = Steve | work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>

"Mixed Up Confusion", recorded during the ''Freewheelin''' sessions with a backing band, was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a [[rockabilly]] sound. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as "a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Sun Records]]."<ref>[[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], 1985, Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]]. Musicians on "Mixed Up Confusion": George Barnes & [[Bruce Langhorne]] (guitars); [[Dick Wellstood]] (piano); [[Gene Ramey]] (bass); [[Herb Lovelle]] (drums)</ref>

====Protest and ''Another Side''====
In May 1963, Dylan's political profile was raised when he walked out of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. During rehearsals, Dylan had been informed by [[CBS Television]]'s "head of program practices" that the song he was planning to perform, "[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]", was potentially libelous to the [[John Birch Society]]. Rather than comply with the censorship, Dylan refused to appear on the program.<ref>Dylan had recorded "Talkin' John Birch Society Blues" for his [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|''Freewheelin'']] album, but the song was replaced by later compositions, including "[[Masters of War]]". See Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 114<U+2013>115.</ref>
{{Listen

 |description= Dylan said of "The Times They Are a-Changin'": "This was definitely a song with a purpose. I wanted to write a big song, some kind of theme song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way. The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close and allied together at that time."<ref name = "Crowe-1985"/>
 |format     = [[Ogg]]}}

By this time, Dylan and Baez were both prominent in the [[civil rights movement]], singing together at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] on August 28, 1963.<ref>Dylan performed "[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]" and "[[When the Ship Comes In]]"; see Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 49.</ref> Dylan's third album, ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin']]'', reflected a more politicized and cynical Dylan.<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', pp. 37<U+2013>41.</ref> The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary, real life stories, with "Only A Pawn In Their Game" addressing the murder of civil rights worker [[Medgar Evers]]; and the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] "[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite [[William Zantzinger]].<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', pp. 221<U+2013>233.</ref> On a more general theme, "[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]" and "[[North Country Blues]]" address the despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, "Boots of Spanish Leather" and "One Too Many Mornings".<ref name = bbctimeline/>

By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 200<U+2013>205.</ref> These tensions were publicly displayed when, accepting the "[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] Award" from the [[National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee]] shortly after the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], an intoxicated Dylan brashly questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself (and of every man) in Kennedy's alleged assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].<ref>Part of Dylan's speech went: "There's no black and white, left and right to me any more; there's only up and down and down is very close to the ground. And I'm trying to go up without thinking of anything trivial such as politics."; see, Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 200<U+2013>205.</ref>

''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'', recorded on a single June evening in 1964,<ref>Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 60.</ref> had a lighter mood than its predecessor. The surreal, humorous Dylan reemerged on "I Shall Be Free #10" and "Motorpsycho Nightmare". "[[Spanish Harlem Incident]]" and "[[To Ramona]]" are romantic and passionate love songs, while "[[Black Crow Blues]]" and "[[I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)]]" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. "[[It Ain't Me Babe]]", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role his reputation had thrust at him.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 222.</ref> His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the [[impressionism|impressionistic]] "[[Chimes of Freedom]]," which sets elements of social commentary against a denser metaphorical landscape in a style later characterized by [[Allen Ginsberg]] as "chains of flashing images,"<ref>In an interview with Seth Goddard for ''Life'' magazine (July 5, 2001) Ginsberg claimed that Dylan<U+2019>s technique had been inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]: "(Dylan) pulled ''[[Mexico City Blues]]'' from my hand and started reading it and I said, 'What do you know about that?' He said, 'Somebody handed it to me in '59 in St. Paul and it blew my mind.' So I said 'Why?' He said, 'It was the first poetry that spoke to me in my own language.' So those chains of flashing images you get in Dylan, like 'the motorcycle black Madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen and her silver studded phantom lover,' they're influenced by Kerouac's chains of flashing images and spontaneous writing, and that spreads out into the people."

In the latter half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan<U+2019>s appearance and musical style changed rapidly, as he made his move from leading contemporary songwriter of the folk scene to [[folk-rock]] pop-music star. His scruffy jeans and work shirts were replaced by a [[Carnaby Street]] wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointy "[[Beatle boots]]". A London reporter wrote: "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of [[Leicester Square]]. He looks like an undernourished [[cockatoo]]."<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 267<U+2013>271; pp. 288<U+2013>291.</ref> Dylan also began to spar in increasingly surreal ways with his interviewers. Appearing on the [[Les Crane]] TV show and asked about a movie he was planning to make, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, "No, I play my mother."<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 178<U+2013>181.</ref>

====Going electric====
{{Main|Electric Dylan controversy}}

Dylan's April 1965 album ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' was yet another stylistic leap,<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 181<U+2013>182.</ref> featuring his first recordings made with electric instruments. The first single, "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]", owed much to [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Too Much Monkey Business]]"<ref>Heylin, 2009, ''Revolution In The Air, The Songs of Bob Dylan: Volume One'', pp. 220<U+2013>222.</ref> and was provided with an early [[music video]] courtesy of [[D.

By contrast, the [[A-side and B-side|B side]] of the album consisted of four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.<ref name = "Sounes-168">Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 168<U+2013>169.</ref> "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" quickly became one of Dylan's best known songs when [[The Byrds]] recorded an electric version that reached number one in both the U.S. and the U.K. charts.<ref>{{cite book|author=Warwick, N., Brown, T. & Kutner, J.|year=2004|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|edition=Third Edition|page=6|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9781844490585}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Whitburn, J.|page=130|year=2008|title=Top Pop Singles 1955<U+2013>2006|publisher=Record Research Inc|isbn=0-89820-172-1}}</ref> "[[It's All Over Now Baby Blue]]" and "[[It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]" were acclaimed as two of Dylan's most important compositions.<ref name = "Sounes-168"/><ref>Shelton, 2003, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 276<U+2013>277.</ref>

In the summer of 1965, as the headliner at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], Dylan performed his first electric set since his high school days with a [[pickup group]] drawn mostly from the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], featuring [[Mike Bloomfield]] (guitar), Sam Lay (drums) and Jerome Arnold (bass), plus [[Al Kooper]] (organ) and [[Barry Goldberg]] (piano).<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 208<U+2013>216.</ref> Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 Dylan, met with a mix of cheering and booing, left the stage after only three songs. One version of the legend has it that the boos were from the outraged folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. [[Murray Lerner]], who filmed the performance, said: "I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2007/10/exclusive_dylan_at_newport_who.html| title = Exclusive: Dylan at Newport<U+2014>Who Booed?| work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]

Nevertheless, Dylan's 1965 Newport performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 305<U+2013>314.</ref> <ref group=a>A year earlier, [[Irwin Silber]], the editor of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', had published an "Open Letter to Bob Dylan", criticising Dylan's stepping away from political songwriting: "I saw at Newport how you had somehow lost contact with people.  Some of the paraphernalia of fame were getting in your way." ''Sing Out!'', November 1964, quoted in Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 313. This letter has been mistakenly described as a response to Dylan's 1965 Newport appearance.</ref> In the September issue of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', singer [[Ewan MacColl]] wrote: "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time... 'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers...

====''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde''====
{{listen|filename=Bob Dylan - Like a Rolling Stone.ogg |title="Like A Rolling Stone"|description=Dylan's 1965 hit single, which appeared on the album ''Highway 61 Revisited''. In 2004, it was labelled the Greatest Song of All Time by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine.<ref name = "RS500"/>|format=[[Ogg]]}}

In July 1965, Dylan released the single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]," which peaked at #2 in the U.S. and at #4 in the UK charts. At over six minutes, the song has been widely credited with altering attitudes about what a pop single could convey. [[Bruce Springsteen]], in his speech during Dylan's inauguration into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] said that on first hearing the single, "that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind".<ref>Springsteen<U+2019>s Speech during Dylan<U+2019>s induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], January 20, 1988 Quoted in Bauldie, ''Wanted Man'', p. 191.</ref> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]'' listed it as number one on its list of "[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]".<ref name = "RS500">{{cite web| url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rstone.html#500Songs| title = The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs of All Time| accessdate = May 2, 2010| publisher = Rock List Music}}</ref> The song also opened Dylan's next album, ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]],'' titled after the road that led from Dylan's [[Minnesota]] to the musical hotbed of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].<ref>Gill, 1999, ''My Back Pages'', pp. 87<U+2013>88.</ref> The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by [[Mike Bloomfield]]'s blues guitar and [[Al Kooper]]'s organ riffs. "[[Desolation Row]]" offers the sole [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] exception, with Dylan making surreal allusions to a variety of figures in Western culture during this epic song, which was described by Andy Gill as "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of iconic characters, some historical ([[Einstein]], [[Nero]]), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary ([[T.S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]]), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse."<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', p. 89.</ref>

In support of the record, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts and set about assembling a band. [[Mike Bloomfield]] was unwilling to leave the Butterfield Band, so Dylan mixed Al Kooper and [[Harvey Brooks]] from his studio crew with bar-band stalwarts [[Robbie Robertson]] and [[Levon Helm]], best known at the time for being part of [[Ronnie Hawkins]]'s backing band [[The Hawks]] (later to become [[The Band]]).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DA103DF932A35752C1A961948260 | title = Recordings; Robbie Robertson Waltzes Back Into Rock | date = November 1, 1987 | accessdate = September 27, 2008 | last = Palmer | first = Robert | publisher = The New York Times}}</ref> On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound. The band's reception on September 3 at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] was more favorable.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 189<U+2013>90.</ref>

While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences on tour, their studio efforts floundered. Producer [[Bob Johnston]] persuaded Dylan to record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in February 1966, and surrounded him with a cadre of top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came down from New York City to play on the sessions.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 238<U+2013>243.</ref> The Nashville sessions produced the double-album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966), featuring what Dylan later called "that thin wild mercury sound".<ref>"The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on individual bands in the ''Blonde on Blonde'' album. It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up."

On November 22, 1965, Dylan secretly married 25-year-old former model [[Sara Dylan|Sara Lownds]].<ref name = "Sounes-p193">Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 193.</ref> Some of Dylan<U+2019>s friends (including [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]) claim that, in conversation immediately after the event, Dylan denied that he was married.<ref name = "Sounes-p193"/> Journalist [[Nora Ephron]] first made the news public in the ''[[New York Post]]'' in February 1966 with the headline "Hush! Bob Dylan is wed."<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 325.</ref>

Dylan undertook a [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|world tour]] of Australia and Europe in the spring of 1966. Each show was split into two parts. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and harmonica. In the second half, backed by [[the Hawks]], he played high voltage electric music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and [[Applause#Slow handclaps|slow handclapped]].<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 244<U+2013>261.</ref> The tour culminated in a famously raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester [[Free Trade Hall]] in England.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nme.com/reviews/bob-dylan/199| title = Live 1966| date = September 6, 1998| accessdate = May 2, 2010| publisher = nme.com}}</ref> A recording of this concert was finally given an official release in 1998, on the album ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert|The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966]]''. At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, [[John Cordwell]], who was angry with Dylan's electric sound, shouted: "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!" to which Dylan responded, "I don't believe you&nbsp;... You're a liar!" Dylan turned to his band and said, "Play it fucking loud!"<ref>Dylan's dialogue with the Manchester audience is recorded (with subtitles) in Martin Scorsese's documentary ''[[No Direction Home]]''</ref> and they launched into the final song of the night with gusto<U+2014>"Like a Rolling Stone."

====Motorcycle accident and reclusion====

After his European tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures on him increased. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] had paid an advance for a TV show they could screen.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 215.</ref> His publisher, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], was demanding a finished manuscript of the poem/novel ''[[Tarantula (book)|Tarantula]].'' Manager [[Albert Grossman]] had already scheduled an extensive concert tour for that summer and fall.

On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph]] Tiger 100 [[motorcycle]] on a road near his home in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], New York, throwing him to the ground.  Though the extent of his injuries were never fully disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several [[vertebrae]] in his neck.<ref name = "Sounes-217">Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 217<U+2013>219.</ref> Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident<ref name = "Mystery">{{cite web| url = http://www.americanheritage.com/email/articles/web/20060729-bob-dylan-motorcycle-woodstock-methamphetamine-robert-shelton-howard-sounes-ed-thaler.shtml| title = The Bob Dylan Motorcycle-Crash Mystery | accessdate = September 7, 2008| publisher = ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''| date = July 29, 2006}}</ref> since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.<ref name = "Sounes-217"/> Dylan later expressed concern about where his career and private life were headed up until the point of the crash: "When I had that motorcycle accident&nbsp;... I woke up and caught my senses, I realized that I was just workin' for all these leeches. And I didn't want to do that. Plus, I had a family and I just wanted to see my kids."<ref>Cott, ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 300.</ref> Many biographers believe that the crash offered Dylan the much-needed chance to escape from the pressures that had built up around him.<ref name = "Sounes-217"/><ref name="shades268">Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 268.</ref> In the wake of his accident, Dylan withdrew from the public and, apart from a few select appearances, did not tour again for eight years.<ref name = "Mystery"/>

Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began editing film footage of his 1966 tour for ''[[Eat the Document]]'', a rarely exhibited follow-up to ''[[Dont Look Back]]''. A rough-cut was shown to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] and was promptly rejected as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 216.</ref> In 1967 he began recording music with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, called "Big Pink".<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp.&nbsp;222<U+2013>225.</ref> These songs, initially compiled as demos for other artists to record, provided hit singles for [[Julie Driscoll]] ("[[This Wheel's on Fire (song)|This Wheel's on Fire]]"), [[The Byrds]] ("[[You Ain't Goin' Nowhere]]", "Nothing Was Delivered"), and [[Manfred Mann]] ([[Quinn the Eskimo]], "[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]"). Columbia belatedly released selections from them in 1975 as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''. Over the years, more and more of the songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on various [[bootleg recording]]s, culminating in a five-CD bootleg set titled ''The Genuine Basement Tapes'', containing [[List of Basement Tapes songs|107 songs and alternate takes]].<ref>Marcus, ''The Old, Weird America'', pp. 236<U+2013>265.</ref> In the coming months, the Hawks recorded the album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' using songs they first worked on in their basement in Woodstock, and renamed themselves [[The Band]],<ref>Helm, Levon and Davis, ''This Wheel's on Fire'', p. 164; p. 174.</ref> thus beginning a long and successful recording and performing career of their own.

In October and November 1967, Dylan returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Bob Dylan's 1967 recording sessions| url = http://www.bjorner.com/DSN01620%201967.htm#DSN01640| accessdate = November 10, 2008| publisher = Bjorner's Still On the Road}}</ref> Back in the recording studio after a 19-month break, he was accompanied only by [[Charlie McCoy]] on bass,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.charliemccoy.com/bio.html | title = Charlie McCoy's Bio | accessdate = September 25, 2008 | publisher = www.charliemccoy.com}}</ref> [[Kenny Buttrey]] on drums,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/kenny-buttrey-550523.html | title = Kenny Buttrey :'Transcendental' drummer for artists from Elvis Presley to Bob Dylan and Neil Young | date = September 23, 2004 | accessdate = September 25, 2008 | last = Wadey | first = Paul | publisher = ''[[The Independent]]'' | location=London}}</ref> and [[Pete Drake]] on steel guitar.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/drake_pete/bio.jhtml | title = Pete Drake: Biography | accessdate = September 25, 2008 | last = Harris | first = Craig | publisher = [[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> The result was ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'', a quiet, contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on both the [[American West]] and the [[Bible]]. The sparse structure and instrumentation, coupled with lyrics that took the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition seriously, marked a departure not only from Dylan's own work but from the escalating psychedelic fervor of the 1960s musical culture.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 282<U+2013>288.</ref> It included "[[All Along the Watchtower]]", with lyrics derived from the [[Book of Isaiah]] (21:5<U+2013>9). The song was later recorded by [[Jimi Hendrix]], whose version Dylan later acknowledged as definitive.<ref name = "Crowe-1985"/>  [[Woody Guthrie]] died on October 3, 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a Guthrie memorial concert held at [[Carnegie Hall]] on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by The Band.

Dylan's next release, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), was virtually a mainstream country record featuring instrumental backing by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with [[Johnny Cash]], and the hit single "[[Lay Lady Lay]]," which he originally wrote for the ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' [[soundtrack]], but did not submit in time to make the final cut.<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', p. 140.</ref> In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of [[Johnny Cash]]'s new television show, duetting with Cash on "[[Girl from the North Country]]", "I Threw It All Away" and "Living the Blues". Dylan next travelled to England to top the bill at the [[Isle of Wight]] rock festival on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the [[Woodstock Festival]] far closer to his home.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 248<U+2013>253.</ref>

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, critics charged Dylan's output was of varied and unpredictable quality.

Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]]'' attracted much media coverage, reflecting that Dylan's live appearances had become rare.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 328<U+2013>331.</ref>

Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock Studios, a small studio in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. These sessions resulted in one single, "Watching The River Flow", and a new recording of "When I Paint My Masterpiece".<ref name = bbctimeline>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/music/bobdylan/timeline/timeline_html.shtml | title = Bob Dylan Timeline | accessdate = September 25, 2008 | publisher = BBC}}</ref> On November 4, 1971 Dylan recorded "[[George Jackson (song)|George Jackson]]," which he released a week later.<ref name = bbctimeline/> For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of [[Black Panthers|Black Panther]] [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] in [[San Quentin Prison]] that summer.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', <U+00B4>pp. 342<U+2013>343.</ref>

In 1972, Dylan signed onto [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s film ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'', providing [[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)|songs and backing music]] for the movie, and playing the role of "Alias," a member of Billy's of some historical basis.<ref>C.

Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new record label, [[David Geffen]]'s [[Asylum Records]], when his contract with [[Columbia Records]] expired. On his next album, ''[[Planet Waves]]'', he used [[The Band]] as backing group, while rehearsing for a major tour. The album included two versions of "Forever Young," which became one of his most popular songs.<ref name = "Sounes-p273">Sounes, 2001, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 273<U+2013>274.</ref> [[Christopher Ricks]] has connected the chorus of this song with [[John Keats]]'s "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]," which contains the line "...forever panting, and for ever young."<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', p. 453.</ref> As one critic described it, the song projected "something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan",<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 354.</ref> and Dylan himself commented: "I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental."<ref>Dylan's comment in booklet notes to ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]'', 1985, CBS Records.</ref> Biographer [[Howard Sounes]] noted that [[Jakob Dylan]] believed the song was about him.<ref name = "Sounes-p273"/>

Columbia Records simultaneously released ''[[Dylan (1973 album)|Dylan]]'', a haphazard collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively cover songs), which was widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 358.</ref> In January 1974 Dylan and [[The Band]] embarked on their high-profile, coast-to-coast [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|North American tour]].

After the tour, Dylan and his wife became publicly estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and quickly recorded a new album entitled ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' in September 1974.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 368<U+2013>383.</ref> Dylan delayed the album's release, however, and re-recorded half of the songs at [[Sound 80]] Studios in [[Minneapolis]] with production assistance from his brother [[David Zimmerman (producer)|David Zimmerman]].<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 369<U+2013>387.</ref> During this time, Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, apparently miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had managed to sell only 700,000 copies of ''Planet Waves''.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 378</ref> Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which eventually reissued his two Asylum albums on their imprint.

Released in early 1975, ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' received mixed reviews. In the ''[[NME]]'', [[Nick Kent]] described "the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practise takes."<ref name = "Heylin 383">Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 383.</ref> In ''Rolling Stone'', reviewer [[Jon Landau]] wrote that "the record has been made with typical shoddiness."<ref name = "Heylin 383"/> However, over the years critics have come to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements, perhaps the only serious rival to his mid-60s trilogy of albums. In [[Salon.com]], Bill Wyman wrote: "''Blood on the Tracks'' is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-'60s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years."<ref>{{cite news | title = Bob Dylan | publisher = [[Salon.com]] | date = May 5, 2001 | url = http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/05/22/dylan/index3.html | accessdate = September 7, 2008 }}</ref> Novelist [[Rick Moody]] called it "the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape."<ref>Hedin, ''Studio A: The Bob Dylan Reader'', p. 109.</ref>

That summer Dylan wrote a lengthy ballad championing the cause of boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin "Hurricane" Carter]], who had been imprisoned for a triple murder committed in [[Paterson, New Jersey]] in 1966. After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote "[[Hurricane (song)|Hurricane]]", presenting the case for Carter's innocence.

Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour encompassed the release of the album ''[[Desire (Bob Dylan album)|Desire]]'', with many of Dylan's new songs featuring an almost [[travel literature|travelogue]]-like narrative style, showing the influence of his new collaborator, playwright [[Jacques Levy]].<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 386<U+2013>401,</ref><ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 408.</ref> The spring 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, ''Hard Rain'', and the LP ''[[Hard Rain (album)|Hard Rain]]''; no concert album from the better-received and better-known opening half of the tour was released until 2002's ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue|Live 1975]]''.<ref>{{cite web

The fall 1975 tour with the Revue also provided the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'', a sprawling and improvised narrative, mixed with concert footage and reminiscences.

In 1978, Dylan embarked on a year-long world tour, performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million people.

In the fall of 1980 Dylan briefly resumed touring for a series of concerts billed as "A Musical Retrospective", where he restored several of his popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. ''[[Shot of Love]]'', recorded the next spring, featured Dylan's first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with explicitly Christian songs. The haunting "[[Every Grain of Sand (Bob Dylan song)|Every Grain of Sand]]" reminded some critics of [[William Blake]]<U+2019>s verses.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 215<U+2013>221.</ref>

In the 1980s the quality of Dylan's recorded work varied, from the well-regarded ''[[Infidels]]'' in 1983 to the panned ''[[Down in the Groove]]'' in 1988. Critics such as [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] condemned Dylan's 1980s albums both for showing an extraordinary carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.<ref>Gray, ''Song & Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan'', pp. 11<U+2013>14.</ref> The ''Infidels'' recording sessions, for example, produced several notable songs that Dylan left off the album. Most well regarded of these were "[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]" (a tribute to the dead blues singer and an evocation of [[African American history]]),<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 56<U+2013>59.</ref> "Foot of Pride" and "Lord Protect My Child".<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 354<U+2013>356.</ref> These songs were later released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1<U+2013>3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961<U+2013>1991]]''.

Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded his next studio album, ''[[Empire Burlesque]]''.<ref name = Sounes362>Sounes, 2001, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 362.</ref> [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], who had remixed hits for [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]], was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker has said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound "a little bit more contemporary".<ref name = Sounes362>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 362.</ref>

Dylan sang on [[USA for Africa]]'s famine relief fundraising single "[[We Are the World]]". On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the climax at the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[JFK Stadium]], Philadelphia. Backed by [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ronnie Wood]], Dylan performed a ragged version of "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: "I hope that some of the money&nbsp;... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe&nbsp;... one or two million, maybe&nbsp;... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks."<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 367.</ref> His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire [[Willie Nelson]] to organize a series of events, [[Farm Aid]], to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 365<U+2013>367.</ref>

In April 1986, Dylan made a brief foray into the world of [[rap music]] when he added vocals to the opening verse of "Street Rock", a song featured on [[Kurtis Blow]]'s album ''Kingdom Blow''.<ref>Gray, 2006, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 63</ref> Dylan's next studio album,  ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'', was released in July 1986 and contained three cover songs (by Little [[Junior Parker]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and the traditional gospel hymn "[[Precious Memories]]"), plus three collaborations with other writers ([[Tom Petty]], [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Carole Bayer Sager]]), and two solo compositions by Dylan. One reviewer commented that "the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:aifrxqt5ld0e| title = Knocked Out Loaded| author = Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| accessdate = May 2, 2010| publisher = allmusic}}</ref> It was the first Dylan album since ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|Freewheelin']]'' (1963) to fail to make the Top 50.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 595.</ref> Since then, some critics have called the 11-minute epic that Dylan co-wrote with Sam Shepard, '[[Brownsville Girl]]', a work of genius.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 95<U+2013>100.</ref>

In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured extensively with Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with [[Grateful Dead|The Grateful Dead]] in 1987, resulting in a live album ''[[Dylan & The Dead]]''. This album received some very negative reviews: ''[[Allmusic]]'' said, "Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:czex97l7krkt

In 1987, Dylan starred in [[Richard Marquand]]'s movie ''[[Hearts of Fire]]'', in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up-rock-star-turned-chicken farmer whose teenage lover ([[Fiona (singer)|Fiona]]) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation (played by [[Rupert Everett]]).<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 376<U+2013>383.</ref> Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack<U+2014>"Night After Night", and "I Had a Dream About You, Baby", as well as a cover of [[John Hiatt]]'s "The Usual". The film was a critical and commercial flop.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 599<U+2013>604.</ref>
Dylan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1988, with [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s introductory speech declaring, "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.<ref>Speech on Bob Dylan's induction to the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, January 20, 1988, reprinted in Bauldie (ed.), ''Wanted Man: In Search of Bob Dylan'', pp. 191<U+2013>193.</ref>

When Dylan released the album ''[[Down in the Groove]]'' in May 1988, it was even more unsuccessful in its sales than his previous studio album.<ref name = "Sounes 385">Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 385.</ref> Michael Gray wrote: "The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant."<ref name="Gray 2000, p. 13">Gray, 2000, ''Song & Dance Man III'', p. 13.</ref> The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. Dylan co-founded the band with [[George Harrison]], [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Tom Petty]], and in the fall of 1988 their multi-platinum ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' reached number three on the US album chart,<ref name = "Sounes 385"/> featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 627<U+2013>628.</ref> Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, which they released with the unexpected title ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]''.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 638<U+2013>640.</ref>

Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with ''[[Oh Mercy]]'' produced by [[Daniel Lanois]]. Dylan critic Michael Gray wrote that the album was: "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s."<ref name="Gray 2000, p. 13"/><ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 145<U+2013>221.</ref> The track "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'', while "What Was It You Wanted?" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', pp. 413<U+2013>20.</ref> The religious imagery of "Ring Them Bells" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.<ref>Scott Marshall wrote: "When Dylan sings that 'The sun is going down upon the sacred cow', it's safe to assume that the sacred cow here is the biblical metaphor for all false gods.

Dylan's 1990s began with ''[[Under the Red Sky]]'' (1990), an about-face from the serious ''Oh Mercy''. The album contained several apparently simple songs, including "Under the Red Sky" and "Wiggle Wiggle". The album was dedicated to "Gabby Goo Goo"; this was later explained as a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and [[Carolyn Dennis]], Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four at that time.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 174.</ref> [[Sidemen]] on the album included [[George Harrison]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] from [[Guns N' Roses]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and [[Elton John]]. Despite the stellar line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 391.</ref>

In 1991, Dylan was honored by the recording industry with a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Lifetime_Awards/| title = Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award| accessdate = September 25, 2008| publisher = Grammy.com}}</ref> The event coincided with the start of the [[Gulf War]] against [[Saddam Hussein]], and Dylan performed his song "[[Masters of War]]".<ref name = "Heylin-664" /> Dylan then made a short speech that startled some of the audience.<ref name = "Heylin-664">Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 664<U+2013>665. Heylin quotes the speech: "My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.' "</ref>

The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering old folk and blues numbers: ''[[Good as I Been to You]]'' (1992) and ''[[World Gone Wrong]]'' (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song "Lone Pilgrim",<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 423.</ref> penned by a 19th century teacher and sung by Dylan with a haunting reverence. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. He claimed his wish to perform a set of traditional songs for the show was overruled by [[Sony]] executives who insisted on a greatest hits package.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 408<U+2013>409.</ref> The album produced from it, ''[[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)|MTV Unplugged]]'', included "John Brown", an unreleased 1963 song detailing the ravages of both war and [[jingoism]].

With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed-in on his Minnesota ranch,<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 693.</ref> Dylan booked recording time with [[Daniel Lanois]] at [[Miami]]'s [[Criteria Studios]] in January 1997.

His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, "I really thought I'd be seeing [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] soon."<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 420.</ref> He was back on the road by midsummer, and in early fall performed before [[Pope John Paul II]] at the World Eucharistic Conference in [[Bologna]], Italy.

September saw the release of the new Lanois-produced album, ''[[Time Out of Mind]]''. With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed. One critic wrote: "the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan's best overall collection in years."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:k9fpxqejldte| title = Time Out of Mind| author = Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| accessdate = May 1, 2010| publisher = allmusic}}</ref> This collection of complex songs won him his first solo "Album of the Year" [[Grammy Award]].<ref>Dylan had been one of several artists who had won "Album of the Year" in 1971 for ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]''{{cite web

In December 1997, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] presented Dylan with a [[Kennedy Center]] Honor in the East Room of the [[White House]], paying this tribute: "He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful."<ref>{{cite news| url = http://clinton4.nara.gov/textonly/WH/New/html/19971208-2814.html

In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his "born again" period and participated in the CD project ''[[Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan]]''. That year also saw the release of the film ''[[Masked & Anonymous]]'', a collaboration with TV producer [[Larry Charles]] that had Dylan appearing in a cast of well-knowns, including [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Penelope Cruz]] and [[John Goodman]].

====''Together Through Life'', ''Christmas in the Heart'' (2009)====
Bob Dylan released his album ''[[Together Through Life]]'' on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director [[Olivier Dahan]] asked him to supply a song for his new [[road movie]], ''[[My Own Love Song]]''; initially only intending to record a single track, "Life Is Hard," "the record sort of took its own direction". Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]].<ref>{{cite web

Andy Gill wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'' that the record "features Dylan in fairly relaxed, spontaneous mood, content to grab such grooves and sentiments as flit momentarily across his radar. So while it may not contain too many landmark tracks, it's one of the most naturally enjoyable albums you'll hear all year."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-bob-dylan-together-through-life-columbia-1673287.html| title = Bob Dylan's Together Through Life| author = Gill, Andy| date = April 24, 2009| accessdate = April 28, 2009| publisher = Salon.com | location=London}}</ref>

====''The Bootleg Series Vol. 9'' and ''The Original Mono Recordings''====

On October 18, 2010, Dylan released Volume 9 of his Bootleg Series, [[The Bootleg Series Vol. 9 <U+2013> The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964|''The Witmark Demos'']].

Witmark & Sons|Witmark Music]] from 1962 to 1964. One reviewer described the  set as "a kind of alternate early history of Dylan<U+2019>s songwriting process, 'writing five new songs before breakfast,' as he once famously quipped".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/bob_dylan/reviews/14419| title = Album Review: Bob Dylan - The Bootleg series Vol.9| author = Torn, Luke| date = 2010-10-16| accessdate = 2010-10-19

==Personal life==
===Family===
Dylan married [[Sara Dylan|Sara Lownds]] on November 22, 1965.  Their first child, [[Jesse Dylan|Jesse Byron Dylan]], was born on January 6, 1966, and they had three more children: Anna Lea, Samuel Isaac Abraham, and [[Jakob Dylan|Jakob Luke]] (born December 9, 1969). Dylan also adopted Sara's daughter from a prior marriage, Maria Lownds (later Dylan), (born October 21, 1961; now married to musician [[Peter Himmelman]]). In the 1990s his son Jakob became well known as the lead singer of the band [[The Wallflowers]]. Jesse Dylan is a film director and a successful businessman. Bob and Sara Dylan were divorced on June 29, 1977.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 198<U+2013>200.</ref>

In June 1986, Dylan married his longtime backup singer [[Carolyn Dennis]] (often professionally known as Carol Dennis).<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 372<U+2013>373.</ref> Their daughter, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, was born on January 31, 1986. The couple divorced in October 1992. Their marriage and child remained a closely guarded secret until the publication of [[Howard Sounes]]' Dylan biography, ''Down the Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'' in 2001.<ref>{{cite news

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:Bob Dylan 1984.jpg|thumb|230px|right|alt=Dylan performing onstage with an electric guitar.|Dylan touring in The Netherlands, in 1984]]
Growing up in [[Hibbing, Minnesota]], Dylan and his parents were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]].<ref>According to Robert Shelton, Dylan's teacher was "Rabbi Reuben Maier of the only synagogue on the [[Iron Range]], Hibbing's Agudath Achim Synagogue". See Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 35<U+2013>36.</ref> However, for a period during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bob Dylan publicly converted to Christianity. From January to April 1979, Dylan participated in Bible study classes at the [[Association of Vineyard Churches|Vineyard School of Discipleship]] in [[Reseda, California]]. Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: "Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob<U+2019>s house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord."<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 494.</ref><ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 76<U+2013>80.</ref>

By 1984, Dylan was deliberately distancing himself from the "[[Born again (Christianity)|born-again]]" label. He told [[Kurt Loder]] of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: "I've never said I'm [[Born again (Christianity)|born again]]. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an [[agnosticism|agnostic]]. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come." In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any Church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, "Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind."<ref>''Rolling Stone'', June 21, 1984, reprinted in Cott (ed.), ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 288.</ref> Since his trilogy of Christian albums, Dylan's faith has been a subject of scrutiny. In 1997 he told [[David Gates (author)|David Gates]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'':
{{blockquote|Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else.

I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.<ref name = "Newsweek97"/>}}

In an interview published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on September 28, 1997, journalist [[Jon Pareles]] reported that "Dylan says he now subscribes to no organized religion."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/arts/pop-jazz-a-wiser-voice-blowin-in-the-autumn-wind.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Wiser Voice Blowin' In the Autumn Wind|first=Jon|last=Pareles|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 28, 1997|accessdate=May 12, 2010}} Reprinted in Cott, ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', pp. 391<U+2013>396.</ref>

Dylan has been described, in the last 20 years, as a supporter of the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] movement<ref>Fishkoff, ''The Rebbe's Army: Inside the World of Chabad-Lubavitch'', p. 167.</ref> and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including the [[bar mitzvah]]s of his sons and attending [[Hadar Hatorah]] a [[Chabad Lubavitch]] [[Yeshiva]]. Subsequently, Jewish news services have reported that Dylan has "shown up" a few times at various [[High Holy Days]] for services at various [[Chabad|Chabad synagogues]].<ref>{{cite news | first=News Service | last=Shmais | title = Bob Dylan @ Yom Kippur davening with Chabad in Long Island | publisher = Shmais News Service | date = October 13, 2005 | url = http://www.shmais.com/pages.cfm?page=archivenewsdetail&ID=24447| accessdate = September 11, 2008}}</ref> For example, he attended Congregation Beth Tefillah, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] on September 22, 2007 ([[Yom Kippur]]), where he was called to the [[Torah]] for the sixth [[Torah_reading#Aliyot|aliyah]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Arutz| last=Sheva | title = Day of Atonement Draws Dylan to the Torah | publisher = Arutz Sheva<U+2014>Israel National News | date = September 24, 2007 | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/133709| accessdate = September 11, 2008}}</ref>

Dylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs. He has also made passing references to his religious faith&mdash;such as in a 2004 interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', when he told [[Ed Bradley]] that "the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God." He also explained his constant touring schedule as part of a bargain he made a long time ago with the "chief commander&mdash;in this earth and in the world we can't see."<ref name = "60minutes2005">{{cite web

==Legacy==
Bob Dylan is one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. Dylan was included in the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]] where he was called "master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/dylan.html| title = The Time 100: Bob Dylan| author = Cocks, Jay| date = June 14, 1999| accessdate = October 5, 2008| publisher = ''Time''}}</ref>  [[Howard Sounes]], the biographer of Bob Dylan,  placed him among the most exalted company when he said, "There are giant figures in art who are sublimely good<U+2014>[[Mozart]], [[Picasso]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Dickens]].

Initially modelling his style on the songs of [[Woody Guthrie]],<ref name = "chronicles243">Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 243<U+2013>246.</ref> and lessons learnt from the blues of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]],<ref name = "chronicles281">Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 281<U+2013>288.</ref> Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 60s, infusing it "with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/175077/Bob-Dylan | title = Bob Dylan | accessdate = October 5, 2008 | publisher = [[Britannica]] Online}}</ref> [[Paul Simon]] suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: "[Dylan's] early songs were very rich&nbsp;... with strong melodies. '[[Blowin' in the Wind]]' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while."<ref>Fong-Torres, ''The Rolling Stone Interviews, Vol. 2'', p. 424.

When Dylan made his move from acoustic music to a rock backing, the mix became more complex. For many critics, Dylan's greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid-'60s trilogy of albums<U+2014>''Bringing It All Back Home'', ''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde''. In [[Mike Marqusee]]'s words: "Between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, [[Symbolist poetry|symbolist]], [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist]] and [[Beat poetry]], [[surrealism]] and [[Dada]], advertising jargon and social commentary, [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]] and [[Mad magazine|''Mad'' magazine]], he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console."<ref>Marqusee, ''Wicked Messenger'', p. 139.</ref>

One legacy of Dylan<U+2019>s verbal sophistication was the increasing attention paid by literary critics to his lyrics.

Dylan<U+2019>s voice was, in some ways, as startling as his lyrics. New York Times critic [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] described Dylan's early vocal style as "a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like [[Dave Van Ronk|Dave Van Ronk's]]."<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 108<U+2013>111.</ref> [[David Bowie]], in his tribute, "[[Song for Bob Dylan]]", described Dylan's singing as "a voice of sand and glue". Dylan's voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal on his hit single, "Like a Rolling Stone", as "at once young and jeeringly cynical".<ref>Gray, 2006, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 413.</ref> As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal ''[[Oral Tradition Journal|Oral Tradition]]'', "Dylan<U+2019>s more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs&mdash;this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in "Everything is Broken" (on the album ''[[Oh Mercy]]'') is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality."<ref>{{cite web

Dylan's influence has been felt in several musical genres.

There have been dissenters. Because Dylan was widely credited with imbuing pop culture with a new seriousness, the critic [[Nik Cohn]] objected: "I can't take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage messiah, as everything else he's been worshipped as. The way I see him, he's a minor talent with a major gift for self-hype."<ref>Cohn, ''Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom'', pp. 164<U+2013>165.</ref> Similarly, Australian critic [[Jack Marx]] credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star: "What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant, faux-cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since, with everyone from [[Mick Jagger]] to [[Eminem]] educating themselves from the Dylan handbook."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24246783-25132,00.html

If Dylan<U+2019>s legacy in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music, as Dylan approaches the age of 70, he is today described as a figure who has greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. As [[J. Hoberman]] wrote in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] might never have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then<U+2014>having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning<U+2014>vanish into a folk tradition of his own making."<ref>{{cite web
