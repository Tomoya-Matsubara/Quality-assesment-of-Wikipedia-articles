'''Turkey''' ({{lang-tr|T<U+00FC>rkiye}}), known officially as the '''Republic of Turkey''' <span style="white-space:nowrap;">({{Audio|asd.ogg|''T<U+00FC>rkiye Cumhuriyeti''}})</span>, is a [[Eurasia]]n [[country]] that stretches across the [[Anatolia]]n peninsula in [[southwest Asia]] and the [[Balkans|Balkan]] region of southeastern [[Europe]]. Turkey borders eight countries: [[Bulgaria]] to the northwest, [[Greece]] to the west, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the northeast, [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] (the [[Nakhichevan]] [[exclave]]), and [[Iran]] to the east, [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] to the southeast. It borders the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west, and the [[Black Sea]] to the north. Turkey also contains the [[Sea of Marmara]], which is used by geographers to mark the border between Europe and [[Asia]], thus making Turkey [[transcontinental country|transcontinental]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/socrates/ects/go.php?page=turkey_geography  |title=Geography of Turkey|author=Sabanc<U+0131> University |authorlink=Sabanc<U+0131> University |publisher=Sabanc<U+0131> University |accessdate=2006-12-13|date=2005}}</ref>

The region comprising modern Turkey has overseen the birth of major civilizations such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s. Because of its strategic location, where two continents meet, [[Culture of Turkey|Turkey's culture]] has a unique blend of [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|Western]] tradition, often described as a bridge between the two civilizations. A powerful regional presence from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to [[China]] in the Eurasian landmass between [[Russia]] and [[India]], Turkey has come to acquire increasing strategic significance.<ref name= "Atat<U+00FC>rk" /><ref name= "Ottoman_Turkey" />

Turkey is a [[democracy|democratic]], [[secular state|secular]], unitary, [[constitutional republic]] whose [[Politics of Turkey|political system]] was established in 1923 under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]], following the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of [[World War I]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Turkey}}
The name for Turkey in the [[Turkish language]], ''T<U+00FC>rkiye'', can be divided into two words: ''T<U+00FC>rk'', which means "strong" in [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] and usually signifying the inhabitants of Turkey or a member of the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/92/T0419200.html |title=The American Heritage<U+00AE> Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition - "Turk"|author=American Heritage Dictionary|authorlink=American Heritage Dictionary|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|accessdate=2006-12-27|date=2000}}</ref> a later form of ''"tu-kin"'', name given by the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] to the people living south of the [[Altay Mountains]] of [[Central Asia]] as early as 177 BC;<ref name="TurkEtymology">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Turk |title=Online Etymology Dictionary - "Turk"|author=Douglas Harper|authorlink=|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2006-12-27|date=2001}}</ref> and the [[Arabic grammar#Nisba|abstract suffix]] ''-iye'', which means "owner" or "related to". The first recorded use of the term "T<U+00FC>rk" or "T<U+00FC>r<U+00FC>k" as an [[exonym and endonym|autonym]] is contained in the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon inscriptions]] of the [[G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rks]] (''Sky Turks'') of Central Asia (c. 8th century CE). The English word "Turkey" is derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''"Turchia"'' (c. 1369).<ref name="TurkEtymology" />

{{Main|History of Anatolia}}
[[Image:Troy1.jpg|thumb|left|275px Portion of the legendary walls of [[Troy|Troy (VII)]], identified as the site of the [[Trojan War]] (ca. 1200 BCE)]]
The Anatolian peninsula (also called Asia Minor), comprising most of modern Turkey, is one of the oldest continually inhabited regions in the world due to its location at the intersection of Asia and Europe. The earliest [[Neolithic]] settlements such as [[<U+00C7>atalh<U+00F6>y<U+00FC>k]] (Pottery Neolithic), [[<U+00C7>ay<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] to Pottery Neolithic), [[Nevali Cori]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]), [[Hacilar]] (Pottery Neolithic), [[G<U+00F6>bekli Tepe]] (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A) and [[Mersin]] are considered to be among the earliest human settlements in the world.<ref name="AnatoliaNeolithic">{{cite paper|url=http://www.canew.org/files/Thissen%20lecture.pdf|title=Time trajectories for the Neolithic of Central Anatolia|author=Thissen, Laurens|publisher=CANeW - Central Anatolian Neolithic e-Workshop|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=2006-12-21|date=2001-11-23}}</ref> The settlement of [[Troy]] starts in the Neolithic and continues into the [[Iron Age]]. Through recorded history, Anatolians have spoken [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[South Caucasian languages|Kartvelian]] languages, as well as many languages of uncertain affiliation. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]] languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the Indo-European languages have radiated.<ref name="AnatoliaIndoEuropean">{{cite journal|last=Balter|first=Michael|title=Search for the Indo-Europeans: Were Kurgan horsemen or Anatolian farmers responsible for creating and spreading the world's most far-flung language family?|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=303|issue=5662|pages=1323|date=2004-02-27}}</ref>
[[Image:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|thumb|left| The [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]], dating from 135 CE]]
The first major empire in the area was that of the [[Hittites]], from the 18th through the 13th century BCE. Subsequently, the [[Phrygia]]ns, an Indo-European people, achieved ascendancy until their kingdom was destroyed by the [[Cimmerians]] in the 7th century BCE.<ref name="TroyHittiteEmpirePhrygians">{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/03/waa/ht03waa.htm|title=Anatolia and the Caucasus (Asia Minor), 2000 <U+2013> 1000 B.C. in ''Timeline of Art History.''|author=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|authorlink=Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=2006-12-21|date=October 2000}}</ref> The most powerful of Phrygia's successor states were [[Lydia]], [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]]. The Lydians and Lycians spoke languages that were fundamentally Indo-European, but both languages had acquired non-Indo-European elements prior to the Hittite and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] periods.

Western Anatolia, was meanwhile settled by the [[Ionians]], one of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek peoples]].

[[Image:OttomanEmpireIn1683.png|thumb|left|The Ottoman Empire at the height of its power (ca. 1680)]]

The ''House of Seljuk'' was a branch of the ''Kinik'' [[Oghuz Turks|O<U+011F>uz Turks]] who in the [[9th century]] resided on the periphery of the [[Muslim history#Abbasids|Muslim world]], north of the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Aral Sea]]s in the Yabghu [[Khagan]]ate of the O<U+011F>uz confederacy.<ref>{{cite book|title=Al Hind: The Making of the Indo Islamic World, Vol. 1, Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam, 7th-11th Centuries|first=Andre|last=Wink|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|location=|year=1990|id=ISBN 90-04-09249-8}}</ref> In the 10th century, the Seljuks migrated from their ancestral homelands into the eastern Anatolian regions that had been an area of settlement for O<U+011F>uz Turkic tribes since the end of the first millennium.<!--The 10th century ''was'' the end of the first millennium; clarify.-->

[[Image:Blaue moschee 6minarette.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (Blue Mosque) is one of the most famous [[Ottoman architecture|architectural legacies]] of the Ottoman Empire.]]

Following their victory over the Byzantine Empire in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the Turks began to abandon their nomadic roots in favour of a permanent role in Anatolia, bringing rise to the Seljuk Empire.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|first=Cyril|last=Mango|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|location=|year=2002|id=ISBN 0-1981-4098-3}}</ref> The empire was not to last, however; by 1243 the Seljuk armies were defeated by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] and the power of the empire slowly disintegrated.

The Ottoman Empire interacted with both [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|Western]] cultures throughout its 623-year history. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was among the world's most powerful political entities, often locking horns with the powers of eastern Europe in its steady advance through the [[Balkans]] and the southern part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name= "Ottoman_Turkey">{{cite book|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|first=Stanford|last=Jay Shaw|coauthors=Kural Shaw, Ezel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|year=1977|id=ISBN 0-5212-9163-1}}</ref> Following [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|years of decline]], the Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] through the [[Ottoman-German Alliance]] in 1914, and was ultimately defeated.

On [[November 1]], the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|newly founded parliament]] formally abolished the [[Sultan]]ate, thus ending 623 years of Ottoman rule. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of 1923 led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed "Republic of Turkey" as the [[successor state]] of the Ottoman Empire, and the republic was officially proclaimed on [[October 29]] [[1923]], in the new capital of [[Ankara]].<ref name= "Ottoman_Turkey" />

Turkey's main political, economic and military relations have remained rooted within the West since the foundation of the republic and its membership to [[NATO]] in 1952.<ref name= "Truman Doctrine" /> Ankara became a crucial strategic ally in diverting Soviet forces from Central Europe and preventing their expansion into the Mediterranean.

The [[European Union]] remains Turkey's biggest trading partner, and the presence of a well-established [[Turkish diaspora]] in Europe has contributed to the development of extensive relations between the two over the years.

The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600&nbsp;[[kilometre]]s (1,000&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) long and 800&nbsp;km (500&nbsp;mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.<ref name="USLC_TRGeo">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/turkey/18.htm |title=Geography of Turkey|author=US Library of Congress|authorlink=US Library of Congress|publisher=US Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-12-13|date=}}</ref> Turkey's area, inclusive of lakes, occupies 779,452 [[square kilometre]]s (300,948 [[square mile|&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi]]), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) are in [[Southwest Asia]] and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in [[Europe]],<ref name="USLC_TRGeo" /> thus making Turkey a [[transcontinental country]]. Turkey's size makes it the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|37th-largest]] country (after [[Mozambique]]). It is somewhat bigger than [[Chile]] or the U.S. state of [[Texas]]. Turkey is encircled by seas on three sides: the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west, the [[Black Sea]] to the north and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. Turkey also contains the [[Sea of Marmara]] in the northwest.<ref name="TRGeo_TRMinistryTourism" />

The European section of Turkey, in the northwest, is [[Eastern Thrace]], and forms the borders of Turkey with Greece and Bulgaria. The Asian part of the country, [[Anatolia]] (also called Asia Minor), consists of a high central plateau with narrow coastal plains, in between the K<U+00F6>ro<U+011F>lu and East-Black Sea mountain range to the north and the [[Taurus Mountains]] to the south. Eastern Turkey has a more mountainous landscape, and is home to the sources of rivers such as the [[Euphrates]], [[Tigris]] and [[Aras River|Aras]], and contains [[Lake Van]] and [[Mount Ararat]], Turkey's highest point at 5,165&nbsp;[[metre]]s (16,946&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).<ref name="TRGeo_TRMinistryTourism" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=4996 |title=Mount Ararat (A<U+011F>r<U+0131> Da<U+011F><U+0131>), Turkey|author=NASA - Earth Observatory|authorlink=NASA|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2006-12-27|date=2001}}</ref>

Turkey is geographically divided into seven regions: [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]], [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]], [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea]], [[Central Anatolia Region, Turkey|Central Anatolia]], [[East Anatolia Region, Turkey|Eastern Anatolia]], [[South Eastern Anatolia Region, Turkey|Southeastern Anatolia]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]]. The uneven north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long, narrow belt. This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey's total land area. As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau becomes increasingly rugged as it progresses eastward.<ref name="TRGeo_TRMinistryTourism">{{cite web|url=http://www.turizm.net/turkey/info/geography.html |title=Geography of Turkey|author=Turkish Ministry of Tourism|authorlink=|publisher=Turkish Ministry of Tourism|accessdate=2006-12-13|date=2005}}</ref>

[[Image:NEO ararat big.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Mount A<U+011F>r<U+0131> is the highest peak in Turkey at 5,165&nbsp;m (16,946&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) and is located in the [[I<U+011F>d<U+0131>r Province]] in the Eastern Anatolia region.]]

Turkey's varied landscapes are the product of complex earth movements that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent [[earthquake]]s and occasional [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions. The [[Bosporus]] and the [[Dardanelles]] owe their existence to the [[geologic fault|fault lines]] running through Turkey that led to the creation of the Black Sea. There is an earthquake fault line across the north of the country from west to east, which caused [[1999 <U+0130>zmit earthquake|a major earthquake]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/civil_eng/structural_lab/eq-rp/seismicity.html |title=Brief Seismic History of Turkey|author=|authorlink=|publisher=University of South California, Department of Civil Engineering|accessdate=2006-12-26|date=}}</ref>

The [[climate]] is a Mediterranean [[temperate climate]], with hot, dry summers and mild, wet and cold winters, though conditions can be much harsher in the more arid interior. Mountains close to the coast prevent Mediterranean influences from extending inland, giving the interior of Turkey a continental climate with distinct seasons. The central Anatolian Plateau is much more subject to extremes than coastal areas. Winters on the plateau are especially severe. Temperatures of <U+2212>30&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] to <U+2212>40&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (<U+2212>22&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]] to -40&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) can occur in the mountainous areas in the east, and snow may lie on the ground 120 days of the year. In the west, winter temperatures average below 1&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (34&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). Summers are hot and dry, with temperatures generally above 30&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (86&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in the day. Annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] averages about 400&nbsp;[[millimetre]]s (15&nbsp;[[inch|in]]), with actual amounts determined by elevation. The driest regions are the Konya plain and the Malatya plain, where annual rainfall frequently is less than 300&nbsp;millimetres (12&nbsp;in). May is generally the wettest month, whereas July and August are the most dry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meteor.gov.tr/2006/english/eng-climateofturkey.aspx |title=Climate of Turkey|author=Turkish State Meteorological Service|authorlink=Turkish State Meteorological Service|publisher=Turkish State Meteorological Service|accessdate=2006-12-27|date=2006}}</ref>

For most of its republican history, Turkey has adhered to a quasi-[[statism|statist]] approach, with strict government controls over private sector participation, foreign trade, and [[foreign direct investment]]. However, during the 1980s, Turkey began a series of reforms, initiated by Prime Minister [[Turgut <U+00D6>zal]] and designed to shift the economy from a statist, insulated system to a more private-sector, [[market economy|market]]-based model.<ref name="80sLiberalization">{{cite book|title=Economics and Politics of Turkish Liberalization|first=Tevfik F.|last=Nas|publisher=Lehigh University Press|location=|year=1992|id=ISBN 0-9342-2319-X}}</ref> The reforms spurred rapid growth, but this growth was punctuated by sharp [[recession]]s and financial crises in 1994, 1999 (following the earthquake of that year),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/422653.stm |title=Turkish quake hits shaky economy|author=|authorlink=|work=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2006-12-12|date=1999-08-17}}</ref> and 2001,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1800869.stm |title='Worst over' for Turkey|author=|authorlink=|work=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2006-12-12|date=2002-02-04}}</ref> resulting in an average of 4% [[gross domestic product|GDP]] growth per annum between 1981 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTURKEY/Resources/361616-1144320150009/Labor_C2.pdf |title=Turkey Labor Market Study|author=World Bank|authorlink=World Bank|publisher=World Bank|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-12-10|date=2005}}</ref> Lack of additional reforms, combined with large and growing [[public sector]] [[deficit]]s and widespread [[political corruption|corruption]], resulted in high [[inflation]], a weak [[List of banks in Turkey|banking]] sector and increased [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] volatility.<ref>{{cite book|title=OECD Reviews of Regulatory Reform - Turkey: crucial support for economic recovery : 2002|first=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|last=|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|location=|year=2002|id=ISBN 92-64-19808-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9264198083&id=ufYU_fR7mLgC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&ots=xxhe4iYB7B&dq=Turkey&sig=5WqjRxHbjn4ObFDJc_sQKuIB2sg#PPP1,M1}}</ref>

Since the economic crisis of 2001 and the reforms initiated by the finance minister of the time, [[Kemal Dervi<U+015F>]], inflation has fallen to single-digit numbers, investor confidence and foreign investment have soared, and unemployment has fallen. Turkey has gradually opened up its markets through economic reforms by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment and the [[privatization|privatisation]] of publicly-owned industries, and the liberalisation of many sectors to private and foreign participation has continued amid political debate.<ref name="TR_Eco">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6103008.stm |title=Robust economy raises Turkey's hopes|author=Jorn Madslien|authorlink=|work=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2006-12-12|date=2006-11-02}}</ref>

Turkey's GDP ranks 17th in the world, and Turkey is a member of [[G20 industrial nations|G20]] which brings together the 20 largest economies of the globe. Turkey's economy is no longer dominated by traditional agricultural activities in the rural areas, but more so by a highly dynamic industrial complex in the major cities, mostly concentrated in the western provinces of the country, along with a developed services sector. The agricultural sector accounts for 11.9% of GDP, whereas industrial and service sectors make up 23.7% and 64.5%, respectively.<ref name="WorldBank_Turkey_glance" /> The tourism sector has experienced rapid growth in the last twenty years, and constitutes an important part of the economy. In 2005, there were 24,124,501 [[Tourism in Turkey|visitors]] to the country, who contributed 18.2 billion USD to Turkey's revenues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=3852067 |title=Tourism statistics for 2005|author=Anadolu Agency (AA)|authorlink=Anadolu Agency|work=H<U+00FC>rriyet|accessdate=2006-12-10|date=2006-01-27}}</ref> Other key sectors of the Turkish economy are construction, automotive industry, electronics and textiles.

<!-- The reference at the end of the paragraph is for the whole paragraph -->
Article 66 of the [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkish Constitution]] defines a "Turk" as anyone that is "bound to the Turkish state through the bond of [[Turkish nationality law|citizenship]]"; therefore, the legal use of the term "Turkish" as a citizen of Turkey is different from the ethnic definition. However, the majority of the Turkish population are of [[Turkish people|Turkish ethnicity]]. Other major ethnic groups include the [[Kurds in Turkey|Kurds]], [[Circassians]], [[Roma people|Roma]], [[Arabs in Turkey|Arabs]] and the three officially-recognized minorities (per the treaty of Lausanne) of [[Greeks in Turkey|Greeks]], [[Armenians in Turkey|Armenians]] and [[Jews in Turkey|Jews]]. The largest non-Turkic ethnicity is the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], a distinct ethnic group traditionally concentrated in the southeast of the country. Minorities other than the three official ones do not have any special group privileges, and while the term "[[minority group|minority]]" itself remains a sensitive issue in Turkey, it is to be noted that the degree of [[assimilation]] within various [[ethnic group]]s outside the recognized minorities is high, with the following generations adding to the [[melting pot]] of the Turkish main body. Within that main body, certain distinctions based on diverse [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origins could be made as well.

Due to a demand for an increased labour force in post-World War II Europe, many Turkish citizens emigrated to [[Western Europe]] (particularly [[West Germany]]), contributing to the creation of a [[Turkish diaspora|significant diaspora]]. Recently, Turkey has also become a destination for numerous immigrants, especially since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the consequent increase of freedom of movement in the region.

Many schools of music are popular throughout Turkey, from "[[Arabesque music|arabesque]]" to [[Turkish hip hop|hip-hop]] genres, as a result of the interaction between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along with Europe, and thus contributing to a blend of Central Asian Turkic, Islamic and European traditions in modern-day Turkish music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkmusikisi.com/osmanli_musikisi/the_ottoman_music.htm |title=The Ottoman music|author=<U+00C7>inu<U+00E7>en Tanr<U+0131>korur|authorlink=<U+00C7>inu<U+00E7>en Tanr<U+0131>korur|publisher=www.turkmusikisi.com|accessdate=2006-12-12|date=}}</ref> Turkish literature was heavily influenced by [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] and, especially, [[Persian literature|Persian]] literature during most of the Ottoman era, though towards the end of the Ottoman Empire the effect of both Turkish folk and Western literary traditions became increasingly felt. The mix of cultural influences is dramatized, for example, in the form of the "new symbols [of] the clash and interlacing of cultures" enacted in the work of [[Orhan Pamuk]], winner of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6044192.stm |title=Pamuk wins Nobel Literature prize|author=|authorlink=|work=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2006-12-12|date=2006-10-12}}</ref>

Architectural elements found in Turkey are also testaments to the unique mix of traditions that have influenced the region over the centuries. In addition to the traditional [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine elements]] present in numerous parts of Turkey, many artifacts of the later [[Ottoman architecture]], with its exquisite blend of local and Islamic traditions, are to be found throughout the country, as well as in many former territories of the Ottoman Empire. Since the 18th century, Turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by Western styles, and this can be particularly seen in Istanbul where buildings like the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]] and the [[Dolmabah<U+00E7>e Palace]] are juxtaposed next to numerous modern skyscrapers, all of them representing different traditions.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Ottoman Architecture|first=Godfrey|last=Goodwin|publisher=Thames & Hudson|location=|year=2003|id=ISBN 0-5002-7429-0|url=}}</ref>

The most popular sport in Turkey by far is [[football (soccer)|football]], with certain professional and national matches drawing tens of millions of viewers on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/sports.htm |title=Sports in Turkey|author=Burak Sansal|publisher=allaboutturkey.com|accessdate=2006-12-13|date=2006}}</ref> Nevertheless, other sports such as [[basketball]] and [[auto racing|motor sports]] (following the inclusion of [[Istanbul Park|<U+0130>stanbul Park]] on the [[Formula 1]] racing calendar) have also become popular recently. The traditional Turkish national sport has been the [[Ya<U+011F>l<U+0131> g<U+00FC>re<U+015F>]] (''Oiled Wrestling'') since Ottoman times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/yagligures.htm |title=Oiled Wrestling|author=Burak Sansal|publisher=allaboutturkey.com|accessdate=2006-12-13|date=2006}}</ref>
