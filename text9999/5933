'''U8''' is a line on the [[Berlin U-Bahn]]. It has 24 stations and is 18.1&nbsp;km long. The U8 is one of two north&ndash;south Berlin U-Bahn lines, and runs from [[Wittenau]] to [[Berlin-Neuk<U+00F6>lln|Neuk<U+00F6>lln]] via [[Gesundbrunnen]]. The original proposal was for a [[Monorail|suspended monorail]] like the [[Wuppertal Schwebebahn]].

== Colouring and Naming ==
[[File:Berlin U8.svg|50px|left]]
The U8 line has had dark blue as its distinguishing colour since it first opened in 1927. It initially ran between Gesundbrunnen and Neuk<U+00F6>lln and was therefore known as the GN-Bahn. Until 1966 it was designated the D line; when the U-Bahn then changed to a numeric designation system, it was renamed Line 8. In 1984, the letter U was added as part of efforts to better distinguish the S-Bahn from the U-Bahn.

== History ==

=== Gesundbrunnen to Neuk<U+00F6>lln: the GN-Bahn ===
[[File:U-Bahn Berlin Leinestra<U+00DF>e.JPG|thumb|left|The sparse [[Leinestra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Leinestra<U+00DF>e station]] on the U8 line]]

In 1902, a [[Nuremberg]] company, the ''Continentale Gesellschaft f<U+00FC>r elektrische Unternehmungen'', approached Berlin's executive council, the ''Magistrat'', about building a [[monorail]] like the one [[Wuppertal_Schwebebahn|that had already been built]] in [[Wuppertal|Elberfeld-Barmen (now part of Wuppertal)]]. Their preferred route ran from Gesundbrunnen to Rixdorf (later renamed [[Berlin-Neuk<U+00F6>lln|Neuk<U+00F6>lln]]). However, the Magistrat and city council were sceptical about the project, above all fearing accidents.

In 1907, [[AEG]] made a competing proposal for almost the same route, in the form of an underground line within the city and an elevated railway in the suburban districts. After lengthy negotiations, in March 1912 the City of Berlin and AEG finally agreed upon a contract for the construction and operation of the line. Agreement was ultimately reached under considerable time pressure, because planning authority in matters of transport was to pass in April 1912 to the Greater Berlin Association and their position on this project was undetermined. 

The line was to begin as elevated track on Schwedenstra<U+00DF>e and then continue to Humboldthain via Badstra<U+00DF>e. From there it would run underground to Hermannplatz via Brunnenstra<U+00DF>e, Rosenthaler Stra<U+00DF>e, Weinmeisterstra<U+00DF>e, M<U+00FC>nzstra<U+00DF>e, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Stra<U+00DF>e, Neue Friedrichstra<U+00DF>e, Br<U+00FC>ckenstra<U+00DF>e, Neanderstra<U+00DF>e, Dresdener Stra<U+00DF>e, Luisenufer, Reichenberger Stra<U+00DF>e, Kottbusser Stra<U+00DF>e and Kottbusser Damm. AEG intended to build the line for the wider of the two train formats, known as ''[[Berlin U-Bahn#Gro<U+00DF>profil (large profile)|Gro<U+00DF>profil]]'' (large profile), like the first north-south line. 

Construction began in 1912. Like [[Siemens]], AEG had formed a subsidiary elevated railway company, AEG-Schnellbahn-AG. However, in the short period before and during the First World War, only a few tunnel sections were completed, among them the tunnel under the River [[Spree]], between the Waisenbr<U+00FC>cke and the Jannowitzbr<U+00FC>cke. Finally, AEG's financial situation became so difficult that they ceased all construction work in October 1919. Thereupon the City of Berlin brought a successful legal action against AEG, as a result of which AEG-Schnellbahn-AG was liquidated. The city then received all the tunnel sections which had been built and planned to complete the line itself, but was at the time still in the process of constructing the first north-south U-Bahn.

At that time plans were considered for eventually extending the line, some of them adventurous, for example a connection to the ''Heidekrautbahn'' railway to the north and another to the ''Neuk<U+00F6>lln-Mittenwald Railway'' to the south, so that theoretically a mass transit line would have been created extending from Gro<U+00DF> Sch<U+00F6>nebeck in Schorfheide through Berlin to [[Mittenwalde]].

Work did not resume on the GN-Bahn until 1926. The change of oversight had advantages for Berlin, because it made it possible to correct some sections of the route, for example, the northern elevated section, which was entirely eliminated, and the location of the tunnel at the [[Alexanderplatz]].

The first work was on the southern portion of the GN-Bahn, so that service began on 17 July 1927 between Boddinstra<U+00DF>e  and Sch<U+00F6>nleinstra<U+00DF>e. Between these stations was the [[Hermannplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hermannplatz station]], which had been built as part of the simultaneous construction of the first north-south U-Bahn, finished 4 years earlier; here passengers were now for the first time able to transfer from one "large profile" (wide-body) line to another. A switching track was built between the two. 

Construction then progressed north. At the [[Kottbusser Tor (Berlin U-Bahn)|Kottbusser Tor station]], the existing elevated station was relocated to make changing trains easier. Operation of the trunk line continued on wooden trestles.

It now seemed natural to continue the line via Dresdener Stra<U+00DF>e and the [[Oranienplatz]] to Neanderstra<U+00DF>e (now [[Heinrich-Heine-Stra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Heinrich-Heine-Stra<U+00DF>e]]) - perhaps too natural: the stretch to Kottbusser Tor would have been very short. In addition, noting the [[Karstadt]] store at Hermannplatz, the [[Wertheim (department store)|Wertheim]] department store had realised the advantages of a connection to the U-Bahn and reputedly paid 5 million [[Reichsmark]]s for a change in the plans. The GN-Bahn would now be diverted to [[Moritzplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Moritzplatz]] and then round a sharp curve to Neanderstra<U+00DF>e. So Wertheim in Moritzplatz also acquired an entrance from the U-Bahn. The shell of a station at Oranienplatz, which had already been constructed by AEG, remains unused to the present day.<ref>[http://www.bliverbau.de/berlin/u-bahn/oranienplatz/oranienplatz.htm Oranienplatz] on Florian Schulz' Berlins blinde Verkehrsbauten site, retrieved 18 October 2010 {{de icon}}</ref>

After Moritzplatz, the route follows the Neanderstra<U+00DF>e and provisionally terminated at the station of that name (renamed [[Heinrich-Heine-Stra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Heinrich-Heine-Stra<U+00DF>e]] in 1960). The segment between [[Sch<U+00F6>nleinstra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Sch<U+00F6>nleinstra<U+00DF>e]] and Neanderstra<U+00DF>e was opened on 12 February 1928 as far as Kottbusser Tor and on 6 April of the same year to Neanderstra<U+00DF>e. A year later, an additional station opened south of Boddinstra<U+00DF>e, [[Leinestra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Leinestra<U+00DF>e]] (in August 1929).

Beyond the Neanderstra<U+00DF>e station was the previously constructed tunnel under the Spree. However, since this needed to be altered and the Jannowitzbr<U+00FC>cke was in bad condition, a completely new bridge was constructed with a new U-Bahn crossing beneath it. The old tunnel was later put to use for a service connection between the U5 and U8 (sometimes called the "orphan tunnel").

[[File:U-Bahn Berlin Alexanderplatz2.JPG|thumb|right|Alexanderplatz station: an early underground shopping arcade]]
The U-Bahn construction at Alexanderplatz took a long time, because the opportunity was taken to completely re-design the square. Some adjustments were also made to the line of the route, and the GN-Bahn thus appreciably better integrated into the remainder of the public transport system.

At [[Alexanderplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Alexanderplatz]], a large transfer terminal was created for the U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams and buses. At that time also, the so-called "mother of all underground shopping concourses" was created. Today, in contrast, it seems rather small in comparison to, for example, the arcade at the [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|Hauptwache station]] in Frankfurt.

Alexanderplatz station now has the form of an 'H'. The eastern leg of the 'H' is the U-Bahn station already opened in 1913 for what is today the U2. The western leg is the GN-Bahn station (today the U8). The crosspiece is the U-Bahn under the [[Frankfurter Allee]], then under construction. Two platforms were built, used by what is today the U5 and projected to be used by a planned line from [[Potsdamer Platz]] to [[Weissensee (Berlin)|Weissensee]]. 

There were no further major problems; for the most part, AEG tunnels already existed. The section from Neanderstra<U+00DF>e to [[Gesundbrunnen (Berlin U-Bahn)|Gesundbrunnen]] opened on 18 April 1930.

As with the other wide-format line, operation was transferred to the elevated railway company.

=== An ill-fated line ===

After the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, Line U8 was not in a good situation. It began with 6 stations in [[West Berlin]], followed by an equally long section under the territory of [[East Berlin]] ('ghost stations') and ended at Gesundbrunnen station after 2 more stations in the western sector. As a result, the line was of little use for public transport, and in addition was always potentially open to disruption by the [[GDR]].

In 1962, plans crystallised for a new residential district in West Berlin, the [[M<U+00E4>rkisches Viertel]]. Like [[Gropiusstadt]], this ought naturally to have U-Bahn service. The [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] to [[Frohnau]], which passed nearby, was ignored; West Berliners boycotted it because it was operated by the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]], an arm of the GDR government,<ref name=Elkins106>T.H.

When Line 9 was extended to [[Osloer Stra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Osloer Stra<U+00DF>e]], a lower-level platform for the U8 was constructed at the same time. Work on that extension began in 1973, and the 1.4&nbsp;km extension was opened on 5 October 1977.

[[File:U-Bahn Berlin Pankstra<U+00DF>e.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pankstra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Pankstra<U+00DF>e station]]'s other purpose as an emergency shelter is hardly discernible]]
Beyond the Gesundbrunnen station, the line continues under Badstra<U+00DF>e. At the junction with Pankstra<U+00DF>e a station was built also called Pankstra<U+00DF>e. The [[Pankstra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Pankstra<U+00DF>e U-Bahn station]] was constructed to also be usable as a shelter, for example in case of war. So the station has sanitary facilities, an emergency kitchen, a filtered ventilation system, etc. In an emergency it can shelter exactly 3,339 people. The additional costs were paid by the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Finance]]. The walls were tiled in brown and the columns clad in aluminium sheeting. One curiosity remains at Pankstra<U+00DF>e station: the silver letters affixed to the walls spell the name "Pankstrasse", not according to the correct German spelling, "Pankstra<U+00DF>e". 

The line then continues along Schwedenstra<U+00DF>e to the previously  prepared [[Osloer Stra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Osloer Stra<U+00DF>e station]]. A service track was added here so that now trains can also be transferred from the U8 to the U9.
  
[[File:U-Bahn Berlin Residenzstra<U+00DF>e.JPG|thumb|right|Brightly decorated columns at the [[Residenzstra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Residenzstra<U+00DF>e station]] are intended to recall carpets in the now destroyed [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschlo<U+00DF>]]]]
Not until 10 years later, on 27 April 1987, was it possible to open the next section of the line, to [[Paracelsus-Bad (Berlin U-Bahn)|Paracelsus-Bad]] (construction had begun in 1980). The extensions on the other lines had proceeded significantly faster; here work lasted an unusually long time. 

After Osloer Stra<U+00DF>e station, the line continues along Schwedenstra<U+00DF>e, which changes its name to Residenzstra<U+00DF>e shortly before it intersects Reginardstra<U+00DF>e. A station was built near the Sch<U+00E4>fersee lake. There were many disputes over what to name it; the name finally agreed upon is [[Franz-Neumann-Platz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Franz-Neumann-Platz (Am Sch<U+00E4>fersee)]] (Franz-Neumann-Platz (at the Sch<U+00E4>fersee). Like the following stations on the line, this station bears the unmistakeable stamp of station architect [[Rainer G. R<U+00FC>mmler|Rainer R<U+00FC>mmler]]. On its walls are trees, intended to symbolise the parkland surrounding the lake. 

To better integrate the line into the district of [[Reinickendorf (locality)|Reinickendorf]], it then detours slightly, not continuing beneath the industrial area to the [[Berlin-Wilhelmsruh railway station|Wilhelmsruh S-Bahn station]], but instead taking a route via the [[Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik|Karl Bonhoeffer Neuropsychiatric Clinic]] and the [[Reinickendorf town hall]]. It then continues under Residenzstra<U+00DF>e, where again a station of that name was built, makes a wide curve under the junction of Residenzstra<U+00DF>e and Lindauer Allee, and a few hundred metres later comes to the [[Paracelsus-Bad (Berlin U-Bahn)|Paracelsus-Bad station]].

[[File:U-Bahn Berlin Paracelsus-Bad.JPG|thumb|left|[[Paracelsus-Bad (Berlin U-Bahn)|Paracelsus-Bad station]] is intended to be reminiscent of a swimming pool]]
The [[Residenzstra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Residenzstra<U+00DF>e station]], intended to be reminiscent of the Berlin Imperial palace, is decorated with plans of the now destroyed [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschlo<U+00DF>]]. The supporting pillars are decorated in very bright colours and probably intended to evoke the rich carpets of the residence. Paracelsus-Bad station was designed to evoke associations with the nearby swimming baths. In addition there are pictures on the wall, one of which shows the doctor and philosopher [[Paracelsus]] (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim).

This new section of the line was actually intended to be inaugurated on the precise 750th anniversary of the city of Berlin, 30 April 1987. However, since the festivities that day were to begin with a celebration at the [[Internationales Congress Centrum Berlin|ICC]], the then Executive Mayor, [[Eberhard Diepgen]], would not be able to attend and hence the opening was brought forward by 3 days. Once more, a long time passed before the next extension of the line towards M<U+00E4>rkisches Viertel. It was 1994 before it was possible to take the U8 to the [[Berlin-Wittenau station|Wittenau S-Bahn station]].

=== Completion of the U8 ===
[[File:U-Bahn Berlin Wittenau.JPG|thumb|right|[[Wittenau (Berlin U-Bahn)|Wittenau station]], provisional and probably eventual terminus of the line]]
The residents of [[M<U+00E4>rkisches Viertel]] had been promised a U-Bahn connection ever since the late 1960s. After examination of several options, the decision was to extend the U8. By 1987, two stages in this extension had been completed: [[Gesundbrunnen (Berlin U-Bahn)|Gesundbrunnen]] <U+2013> [[Osloer Stra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Osloer Stra<U+00DF>e]] and Osloer Stra<U+00DF>e <U+2013> [[Paracelsus-Bad (Berlin U-Bahn)|Paracelsus-Bad]]. The third stage still remained to be built. After the Berlin Transport Company, [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe]], took over operation of the [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] in West Berlin and the [[Berlin-Frohnau station|Frohnau]] section of line was reopened on 1 October 1984, there was increasing criticism of the U8 extension, which would run almost parallel to the S-Bahn. However, the [[Senate of Berlin|Senate of West Berlin]] was not to be dissuaded and resumed construction on the U-Bahn. Even a directive from the government of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic]] in Bonn to instead invest in badly needed renovations of the S-Bahn, coupled with a warning that subsidies to Berlin would be reduced, was dismissed with the argument that cessation of the U-Bahn construction would cause severe economic harm to the city.

Ground was broken on 27 February 1985, while the preceding segment of the U8 was also still under construction. The intended terminus of the third stage of the line extension was Wilhelmsruher Damm, near the [[Berlin-Wittenau station|Wittenau S-Bahn station]]. This was apparently to distinguish the U-Bahn from the S-Bahn. Only shortly before dedication of the new segment did the Senate correct the name of the station, which has since been called [[Wittenau (Berlin U-Bahn)|Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm)]], but is commonly known simply as Wittenau.

After Paracelsus-Bad, the line continues under Lindauer Allee to [[Lindauer Allee (Berlin U-Bahn)|Lindauer Allee station]], the only one on the U8 to have outside platforms. After a long curve, the U8 is running under the S-Bahn. The location of the next station requires a long walk to transfer between the two. There was also disagreement concerning the name of this station: the S-Bahn station at this point was called ''Wittenau (Kremmener Bahn)'', to distinguish it from ''Wittenau (Nordbahn)'' (which is now ''Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm)'' to match the U-Bahn station). The U-Bahn station was to be called [[Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik (Berlin U-Bahn)|Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik]] after the psychiatric clinic. This was a mouthful that was only slowly accepted. On the S-Bahn, to this day "Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik" is announced but the shorter "Karl-Bonhoeffer-Klinik" appears on signs. The subway line then continues under the clinic. To minimise disturbance, this stretch of tunnel was excavated using a [[Tunnelling shield|shield]], and rubber sound baffling was also needed. This attracted repeated criticism from those who would have preferred open tunnelling with shoring up of buildings. Other problems also arose during construction of this stretch of line: the Brandenburg sand made work particularly difficult and numerous oversized boulders ([[glacial erratic]]s) caused delays. 

After Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik the U8 turns onto Eichborndamm, where the [[Rathaus Reinickendorf (Berlin U-Bahn)|Rathaus Reinickendorf station]] was built. 1,101&nbsp;m further, it reaches its current and probably ultimate terminus, Wittenau. The intention still remains today to extend this line to M<U+00E4>rkisches Viertel. However, as with other U-Bahn construction projects, the extreme budgetary crisis in the state of Berlin is preventing further construction.

The completed extension, which is 3.6&nbsp;km long and comprises 4 new stations, was opened on 24 September 1994. Construction cost 600 million DM. As with other newly built sections of the U-Bahn in this period, [[Rainer G. R<U+00FC>mmler|Rainer R<U+00FC>mmler]] was responsible for the design of the stations. Critics say that this section would represent his peak, but that R<U+00FC>mmler had a tendency to excess. This is particularly evident in the [[Lindauer Allee (Berlin U-Bahn)|Lindauer Allee station]], where he primarily made use of the symbol on the coat of arms of the city of [[Lindau]], the [[linden tree]]. At the Wittenau U-Bahn station, the colours green and yellow were supposed to radiate a certain peace, which he associated with the intended station name ''Wilhelmsruher Damm''.  

[[File:U-Bahn Berlin Hermannstra<U+00DF>e 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hermannstra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hermannstra<U+00DF>e station]], planned since 1910]]
Plans for a U-Bahn to the [[Berlin Hermannstra<U+00DF>e station|Hermannstra<U+00DF>e S-Bahn station]] had existed since 1910. When the so-called GN-Bahn was opening in stages between 1927 and 1930, plans to extend it were not abandoned. The first work on a southwards extension began in 1929; but the [[1929 economic crisis|economic crisis]] prevented its continuation. Ultimately, the City of Berlin cancelled the project in 1931. At that point, the tunnel from the [[Leinestra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Leinestra<U+00DF>e station]] and approximately one third of the future platform for the [[Hermannstra<U+00DF>e (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hermannstra<U+00DF>e station]] had been completed. 

In 1940 the station, still only a shell, was converted into an [[air-raid shelter]], since it was located very deep underground because the line crossed under the [[Berlin Ringbahn|Ringbahn]], which at this point runs in a [[Cutting (transportation)|cutting]]. To this day, relics in the station recall that time. 

After 1961, the extension plans were no longer pursued, since there was no demand for transfer capability to the S-Bahn, operated by the GDR's [[Deutsche Reichsbahn|Reichsbahn]].<ref name=Elkins106/>  [[BVG|Berlin Transport]] used the stubs of tunnel which had already been built to park surplus trains.

After [[German reunification|reunification]] in 1990, many things seemed possible. The S-Bahn Ringbahn, shut down by the Reichsbahn after a [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany)#The S-Bahn in West Berlin during the Cold War|1980 strike]], was to be re-opened. The re-opening was scheduled for 17 December 1993, which meant that the [[Berlin Senate|Senate]] and Berlin Transport had to work very fast, because construction had to begin on the U-Bahn before the Ringbahn re-opened. During work on the station, the trains which had been parked there in the 1960s were discovered. Many U-Bahn fans were delighted that one of the discoveries was an antique BI train.

The work included renovation of the old tunnel and existing platform section as well as construction of the remainder of the platform and a 320-meter turnaround beyond it to the south. In addition, transfer access to the S-Bahn platform above and possible stairways to a planned regional station had to be accommodated.

Finally, on 13 July 1996, the 168th Berlin U-Bahn station opened. Here too, [[Rainer G. R<U+00FC>mmler|Rainer R<U+00FC>mmler]] was responsible for the design of the station, incidentally for the last time. He referred very strongly to the stations on the preceding stretch of line and designed a very sparse station lined with turquoise tiles. So that the historic shelter signs would remain visible, glass was substituted for the tiles in some places.

With the commissioning of this station, the U8 reached what is up to now its final form. Even though an extension to M<U+00E4>rkisches Viertel is planned, it is unlikely that it will become a reality for decades. The previously planned extension towards Britz was cancelled because the [[U7 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U7]] follows a parallel route.
