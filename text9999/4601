==Biography==
===Early life and career===
'''Val Mayerik''' was born in 1950<ref name=lam>[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/mayerik_val.htm Val Mayerik] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]</ref><!--THIS IS VERY PROBABLY TRUE BUT NEEDS CITATION in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Ohio]].{{cn}} He majored in art and philosophy at [[Youngstown State University]], which he attended from 1968 to 1972.--> Upon college graduation, he met and began working as an assistant to Ohio-based comic-book artist [[Dan Adkins]], alongside fellow assistant [[P. Craig Russell]].<ref name=lam /> Through Adkins, who was primarily an [[inker]] for [[Marvel Comics]], Mayerik broke into comics that summer as [[penciler]], over Adkins layouts, of the eight-page story "Spell of the Dragon", starring author [[John Jakes]]' [[sword-and-sorcery]] hero [[Brak the Barbarian]]. Published in the [[horror fiction|horror]]-[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] ''Chamber of Chills'' # 2 (Jan. 1973), it appeared a month after his first published comics work, the full-length "The Monster of the Monoliths" in Marvel's ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' # 21, which Mayerik and Russell penciled over [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] layouts.<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/Val%20Mayerik/sort/chrono/ Val Mayerik] and misspelling [http://www.comics.org/credit/name/Val%20Mayerick/sort/chrono/ Val Mayerick] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>

Mayerik quickly found more assignments, penciling Marvel's adaptation of [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', over Adkins layouts, in ''[[Supernatural Thrillers]]'' # 2 (Feb. 1973); and doing his first full penciling, with writer [[George Alec Effinger]]'s adaptation of [[Lin Carter]]'s "[[Thongor]]! Warrior of Lost [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]" story "Thieves of Zangabal", in ''[[Creatures on the Loose]]'' # 22 (March 1973).<ref name=gcd />

===Howard the Duck===
Mayerik became the regular artist of the [[swamp]]-monster feature "[[Man-Thing]]" in ''[[Adventure into Fear|Fear]]'' #13 (April 1973).<ref name=gcd /> Six issues later, he and writer [[Steve Gerber]] introduced Howard the Duck.<ref name=gcd /> Initially a minor supporting character intended only for an issue or two, the anthropomorphic waterfowl &mdash; bedecked in suit and tie as a parody of [[funny animal]] ducks, except for his [[cigar]]-smoking and his angry, ascerbic wit &mdash; Howard eventually became a star character with his own satiric series, penciled first by [[Frank Brunner]] and then [[Gene Colan]]. The character shortly afterward became a mainstream [[pop-culture]] figure.

Mayerick continued to pencil both the "Man-Thing" and "Thongor" series until the former received his own title, for which Mayerik drew the premiere issue (Jan. 1974). While also doing scattered horror/fantasy/[[science-fiction]] anthology stories, Mayerik teamed with Gerber on a second series, the [[Living Mummy]], in ''Supernatural Thrillers'', and took over the art on ''The [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein Monster]]''. With writer [[Doug Moench]], he did a monumental adaptation of Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] novel ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' in the black-and-white [[magazine]] ''Marvel Preview'' # 5-6 (April & Spring 1976). He also penciled the final six issues of the 20-issue, 1974 to 1977 jungle-lord series ''[[Ka-Zar]]''.<ref name=gcd />

Also interested in acting, Mayerik appears in ''The Demon Lover'' (1977),a low-budget horror [[film]] shot in and around [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Marvel and New York===
In early 1977, Mayerik moved to [[New York City]], where he acted [[off-off-Broadway]] and found work with artist [[Neal Adams]]' [[Continuity Associates]] studio, sharing space with fellow fledglings [[Howard Chaykin]], [[Walt Simonson]], and [[Jim Starlin]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} 

During this time, he drew the first ''Howard the Duck Annual'' (May 1977) and ''Howard the Duck'' #22-23 (March<U+2013>April 1978).<ref name=gcd /> He was also an artist on the ''Howard the Duck'' [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] in 1977.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He co-plotted and co-scripted, in addition to drawing, Howard the Duck #33 (Sept. 1986), the second and last issue of a short-lived series revival coinciding with the release of the movie ''[[Howard the Duck#Other media|Howard the Duck]]''. He expanded beyond his prolific Marvel work to draw for ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' magazine and the [[Warren Publishing]] line of black-and-white comics magazines; the latter work included the continuing [[samurai]] feature "[[Young Master]]", reprints of which appeared as backup stories in Mayerik and writer [[Larry Hama]] 1987-1989 ''Young Master'' series published by [[New Comics Group]].<ref name=gcd />

Mayerik left New York City in 1981, moving first to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where he did local [[TV]] and film work and [[regional theater]] in addition to his art, before settling in Oregon in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Commercial art===
Mayerik continued to draw for comics through the 1980s and early 1990s, working on series for [[Eclipse Comics]], [[First Comics]], [[Now Comics]], [[Pacific Comics]], and Harvey Pekar's self-published ''[[American Splendor]]'', in addition to Marvel,<ref name=gcd /> but was seguing toward more of a career in advertising art and in illustration for the [[game]]s industry, including the [[roleplaying game]] companies [[TSR, Inc.]] and [[Wizards of the Coast]].<ref name=rpg>[http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&creatorid=1802 Pen & Paper TBG Database: Val Mayerik]. [http://www.webcitation.org/5nKhqcSe8 WebCitation archive].</ref> As a spin-off of this, he drew the four-issue [[Acclaim Comics]] [[miniseries]] ''Magic: The Gathering &mdash; The Shadow Mage'' (July-Oct. 1995).<ref name=gcd />

As of 2010 Mayerik illustrates the comics strip "Useful Idiots" with [[James Hudnall]] for the political site [[BigJournalism.com]]. The trip runs every Friday and mocks the news media.

Mayerik has done [[storyboards]] and other art for clients ranging from [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Microsoft]] to the [[American Indian College Fund]] and the [[Oregon Historical Society]].<ref name=official>[http://www.valmayerik.com/ Val Mayerik] (official site)</ref>
