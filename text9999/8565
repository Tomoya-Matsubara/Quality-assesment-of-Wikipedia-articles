'''Pope Saint Sergius I''' (died September 8, 701) was [[Pope]] from 687&ndash;701. Selected to end a schism between [[Antipope Paschal]] and [[Antipope Theodore]], Sergius I ended the last disputed ''[[sede vacante]]'' of the [[Byzantine Papacy]].

His papacy was dominated by his response to the [[Quinisext Council]], whose canons he refused to accept. As a result of the dispute [[Justinian II]] ordered Sergius I's abduction (as his predecessor [[Constans II]] had done with [[Pope Martin I]]), but with the assistance of the [[exarch of Ravenna]], Sergius I was able to avoid trial in Constantinople.

==Early life==
Sergius I came from an [[Antioch]]ene [[Syria]]n family which had settled at [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]]. Sergius left Sicily and arrived in Rome during the pontificate of [[Pope Adeodatus]].<ref name="e223">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 223.</ref> A fellow Sicilian [[Pope Leo II]] ordained him [[cardinal-priest]] of [[Santa Susanna]] on June 27, 683 and he rose through the ranks of the clergy.<ref name="e223"/><ref>Horace Mann:  ''The lives of the popes.'' Vol. I pt. 2, London 1903, p. 80</ref> He remained cardinal-priest of S. Susanna until his selection as pope.<ref name="e223"/>

==Election==
Sergius I owed his election as [[Pope Conon]]'s successor to skillful intrigues against [[Antipope Paschal]] and [[Antipope Theodore]], the other candidates. The two armed factions entered open combat before Sergius I was chosen by a group of judges, soldiers, clergy, and citizens.<ref name="e216">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 216.</ref> Sergius I was brought to the Palatine imperial palace and then the Lateran.<ref name="e216"/> The "numerical superiority" of this new faction forced Theodore from the ''[[patriarchium]]'', whereafter he acknowledged Sergius I as pope.<ref name="e216"/>

Paschal remained unconvinced, and while pretending to accept Sergius, sent messengers to the [[exarch of Ravenna]] [[John Platyn]] promising gold in exchange for military support.<ref name="e216"/> The exarch arrived, demanded the gold, and looted [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], but departed after Sergius I's consecration.<ref name="e216"/> Paschal was eventually confined to a monastery on charges of witchcraft.<Ref name="e216"/>

Sergius I was consecrated on December 15, 687, ending the last disputed ''[[sede vacante]]'' of the [[Byzantine Papacy]].<ref name="e217">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 217.</ref>

==Papacy (687-701)==
On April 10, 689, Sergius I baptised King [[Caedwalla of Wessex]] in [[Rome]].  He also ordained [[Saint Willibrord]] as bishop of the [[Frisia]]ns, and the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' states he also ordained [[Berhtwald]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. 

Sergius founded the [[diaconie]] of [[S. Maria in Via Lata]], on the [[Corso]] from the [[Porta Flaminia]] to [[Capitoline Hill]], encompassing a quarter of the city which developed in the eighth century.<ref name="e210"/> He also "restored and embellished" the Eastern church of [[SS. Cosmas and Damian]].<ref name="e210">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 210.</ref>

===Response to the Quinisext Council===
Sergius I did not attend the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692, but sent legates (including his ''[[apocrisiarius]]'' and suffragan Basil, the [[bishop of Gortyna]] in Crete), who ended up subscribing to the canons as "holding the place of the entire synod of the Holy Roman Church".<ref name="e220">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 220.</ref> Sergius I himself rejected certain canons of the Council, although he continued to support political unity with Constantinople.<ref name="e222">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 222.</ref> It is unknown exactly which canons Sergius I objected to, but he declared that he would "rather die than consent to erroneous novelties".<ref name="e222"/> Sergius I's objections, however, did not extend to the anathemization of his predecessor, [[Pope Honorius I]], who at the time was also condemned in Western formulas.<ref name="e222"/> The canon which declared Constantinople equal in privileges but second in honor to Rome was also probably not the point of contention as it differed little from the pronouncements of earlier councils.<ref name="e222"/>

However, the Quinisext Council did approve all eighty-five of the [[Apostolic Canons]], while Sergius I would only have supported the first fifty.<ref name="e222"/> The bulk of the resistance probably stemmed from varying doctrines and practices between east and west; for example, Roman deacons were prohibited from living with their wives after ordination, Roman priests were prohibited from having married twice prior to ordination, and Roman Christians were prohibited from fasting on the Saturdays of [[Great Lent]] and allowed to consume animal blood.<ref name="e222"/> These and other practices differed from the Trullan canons.<ref name="e222"/>

In a symbolically important step, Sergius I declared support for the chant "Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on us" at the breaking of the Host during Mass, and restored the damaged facade mosaic in St. Peter's atrium that depicted the [[Worship of the Lamb]]; the depiction of Christ as lamb had been prohibited by the Council.<ref name="e223"/> The ''[[Agnus Dei]]'' would have been chanted in both Greek and Latin during this period, in the same manner as the other liturgical changes of Sergius I.<ref>Ekonomou, 2007, p. 250.</ref> Sergius I himself composed a litany in Greek (extant in the [[Athelstan Psalter]] to be recited on the [[feast of all saints]].<ref>Ekonomou, 2007, p. 254, 280n94.</ref>

Enraged, Emperor [[Justinian II]] dispatched his ''[[magistrianus]]'', also named Sergius, to Rome to arrest bishop [[John of Portus]], the chief papal legate to the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] and Boniface, the papal counselor.<ref name="e223"/> The two high ranking officials were brought to Constantinople as a warning to the pope.<Ref name="e223"/> Eventually, Justinian II ordered Sergius I's arrest and abduction to Constantinople by his notoriously violent bodyguard ''[[protospatharios]]'' Zacharias.<ref name="e223"/> However, the militia of the exarch of Ravenna and the [[Duchy of Pentapolis]] frustrated the attempt.<ref name="e224">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 224.</ref> Zacharias nearly lost his own life in an attempt to arrest Sergius I.<ref>Ekonomou, 2007, p. 44.</ref> Rather than seizing upon the anti-Byzantine sentiment, Sergius I did his best to quell the uprising.<ref name="e224"/>

==Death==
Sergius died on September 8, 701.  He was succeeded by [[Pope John VI|John VI]].
