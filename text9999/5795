The '''Jindalee Operational Radar Network''' ('''JORN''') is an [[over-the-horizon radar]] network that can monitor air and sea movements across 37,000km<sup>2</sup>. It has an official range of 3,000 km but depending upon certain atmospheric conditions has a range up to and including the Korean peninsula. It is used in the defence of [[Australia]] and can also monitor maritime operations, wave heights and wind directions. Up to now, the network has cost approximately $A1.8 billion.

==History==
The roots of the JORN can be traced back to post [[World War II]] experiments in the [[United States]] and a series of Australian experiments beginning in the early 1950s.  From July 1970 a study was undertaken, resulting in a proposal for a program, to be carried out in three phases, to develop an over-the-horizon-radar system.<ref name=d_h_sinnott>[http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/page/3984/ The Development of Over-the-Horizon Radar in Australia] - paper by D.H. Sinnott on the Australian Department of Defence website</ref>.

The first phase was designated project [[Geebung]].  Geebung aimed to define operational
requirements for an OTHR and study applicable technologies and techniques.  The project carried out
a series of ionospheric soundings, evaluating the suitability of the ionosphere for the operation
of an OTHR radar.<ref name=d_h_sinnott />

Geebung was the foundation for Project Jindalee, the second phase, aimed at proving the
feasibility and costing of OTHR.  This second phase was to be carried out by Radar Division, which later become the [[High Frequency Radar Division]] within the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]].<ref name=d_h_sinnott />

Project Jindalee came into being during the period 1972-1974 and was divided into three stages.<ref name=d_h_sinnott />

Stage 'A' commenced in April 1974.  It involved the construction of a prototype radar
receiver at Mount Everard, near [[Alice Springs]], a transmitter at Harts Range, 160km away and a beacon in [[Derby, Western Australia|Derby]].
Once completed in October 1976 the Stage A radar ran for two years, closing in December 1978.
Stage A formally ended in February 1979 having achieved its mission of proving the feasibility of OTHR.<ref name=d_h_sinnott />

The success of stage A resulted in the construction of a larger stage 'B' radar, drawing
on the knowledge gained from stage A.  Stage B commenced on 6 July 1978.  The new radar
was constructed next to the stage A radar.  Developments during stage B included 
real time signal processing, using custom built processors, larger antenna arrays and higher
power transmitters, resulting in a more sensitive and capable radar.  The first data was
received by stage B in the period April to May 1982.  The first ship was detected in January 1983
and an aircraft automatically tracked in February 1984.  Trials were carried out with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]
during April 1984, substantially fulfilling the mission of stage B, to demonstrate an OTHR operating
in Australia.  Another two years of trials were carried out before the Jindalee project officially
finished in December 1985.<ref name=d_h_sinnott />

Stage 'C' became the conversion of the stage B radar to an operational radar.  This stage saw
substantial upgrades to the stage B equipment followed by the establishment of [[No. 1 Radar Surveillance Unit RAAF]] (1RSU) and the handover of the radar to 1RSU.  The aim was to provide Australia's defence forces with
operational experience of OTHR.<ref name=colegrove>{{cite conference|first=Samuel B.(Bren)|last=Colegrove|title=Project Jindalee: From Bare Bones To Operational OTHR|booktitle=IEEE International Radar Conference - Proceedings|pages=825-830|publisher=IEEE|date=2000|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/6874/18502/00851942.pdf|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref>

The third phase of the OTHR program was the design and construction of the JORN.  The decision to build the JORN was announced in October 1986.  [[Telstra]], in association with [[GEC-Marconi]], became the prime contractor and a fixed price contract for the construction of the JORN was signed on 11th June 1991.   The JORN was to be completed by 13th June 1997.<ref name=colegrove />

By 1996 the project was experiencing technical difficulties and cost overruns<ref>{{cite web|first=Ray|last=McNally|title=Jindalee Operational Radar Network: Department of Defence|work=The Auditor-General Performance Audit Audit Report No.28 1995-96|publisher=Australian National Audit Office|date=1996-08-18|url=http://www.anao.gov.au/WebSite.nsf/Publications/4A256AE90015F69B4A25690A002479D2/$file/rpt28-96.pdf|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref><ref name=colegrove />.  Telstra reported an [[Australian dollar|$A]]609 million loss and announced that it could not guarantee a delivery date.<ref name=sinclairjones>{{cite web|url=http://defence-data.com/features/fpage37.htm|title=JORN assures early warning for Australia|accessdate=2006-11-15|last=Sinclair-Jones|first=Michael|date=2000-02-29|work=Defence Systems Daily|publisher=Defence Data Ltd.}}</ref>

The failed Telstra contract prompted the project to enter a fourth phase: completion of the JORN and its subsequent maintenance using a new contractor.  In February 1997 [[Lockheed Martin]] and [[Tenix]] received a contract to deliver and manage the JORN.  Subsequently during June 1997 Lockheed and Tenix formed the company [[RLM Group]] to handle the joint venture<ref name="RLM">[http://www.rlmgroup.com.au RLM Group web site]</ref>.  An operational radar system was delivered in April 2003, with maintenance contracted to continue until February 2007<ref name=dmo_website>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/esd/jp2025/jp2025.cfm|title=Projects: JP 2025 - Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN)|accessdate=2006-11-15|last=Thurston|first=Robin|date=2006-06-21|work=Defence Materiel Organisation Website|publisher=Department of Defence}}</ref>.

As a consequence of the duration of its construction the JORN delivered in 2003 was designed to a specification developed in the early 1990s.  During this period the Alice Springs radar had evolved significantly under the guidance of the DSTO.  In February 2004 a fifth phase of the JORN project was approved.   This current phase aims to upgrade the Laverton and Longreach Radars to reflect over a decade of OTHR research and development.  Phase five is scheduled to run until approximately the year 2010.<ref name=dmo_website />

==Network==
The JORN consists of two active radar stations; one near [[Longreach, Queensland]] (JOR1) and a second near [[Laverton, Western Australia]] (JOR2), a control centre in [[RAAF Base Edinburgh|Edinburgh, South Australia]] (JCC), seven [[transponders]] and twelve vertical [[Ionosonde|ionosondes]] distributed around Australia and its territories<ref name=colegrove />.  DSTO uses a radar station near [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]] (JFAS) for research and development<ref name="wise">{{cite journal|last=Wise|first=John C.|title=Summary of recent Australian radar developments|journal=IEEE A&E Systems Magazine|issue=Dec 04|pages=8-10|publisher=IEEE|date=2004-12|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/62/30020/01374061.pdf|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref> and also has its own network of vertical/oblique ionosondes for research purposes.<ref name=colegrove /><ref name="lowell">{{cite web|url=http://ulcar.uml.edu/slist.htm|title=Digisonde Station List|accessyear=2006-11-29|year=2004|month=Feb|publisher=University of Massachusetts Lowell, Center for Atmospheric Research}}</ref><ref name="Gardiner-Garden">{{cite conference|first=R.S.|last=Gardiner-Garden|title=Ionospheric variability in sounding data from JORN|booktitle=Workshop on the Applications of Radio Science (WARS)|date=2006-02|location=Leura, NSW|url =http://www.ips.gov.au/IPSHosted/NCRS/wars/wars2006/proceedings/poster/gardiner_garden_p.ppt|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>
The Alice Springs radar can be patched into the JORN to provide a third active radar station<ref name="wise" />.

Each radar station consists of a transmitter site and a receiver site, separated by a large distance to prevent the transmitter from interfering with the receiver.  The four JORN transmitter and receiver sites are:

The [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] radar was the original 'Jindalee Stage B' test bed on which the design of the other two stations was based.  It continues to act as a research and development testbed in addition to its operational role.

The Mount Everard receiver site contains the remains of the first, smaller, 'Jindalee Stage A' receiver.  It is visible in aerial photos, behind the stage B receiver ({{coor d|23.530074|S|133.68782|E|region:AU_scale:10000}}).  The stage A transmitter was rebuilt to become the stage B transmitter<ref name=d_h_sinnott />.

The [[high frequency]] radio transmitter arrays at Longreach and Laverton have 28 elements, each driven by a 20 [[kilowatt]] power amplfier giving a total power of 560kW<ref name=colegrove />.  Stage B transmitted 20kW per amplifier<ref name=colegrove />. The signal is bounced off the [[ionosphere]] and is received at the Longreach and Laverton stations.  The receiver stations use [http://www.kel.com.au/ KEL Aerospace] KFR35 series receivers<ref name="wise" />.  JORN uses radio frequencies between 5 and 30 MHz<ref name="kell1">{{cite web|url=http://www.kel.com.au/products/kpr35c1.htm|title=Specification: KPR35C1 HF Radar Receiver|accessdate=2006-11-29|work=KEL Aerospace website|publisher=KEL Aerospace|quote=RF Input Frequency Range: 5 to 30MHz}}</ref><ref name="kell2">{{cite web|url=http://www.kel.com.au/products/kpr35c2.htm|title=Specification: KPR35C2 HF Radar Receiver|accessdate=2006-11-29|work=KEL Aerospace website|publisher=KEL Aerospace|quote=RF Input Frequency Range: 5 to 30MHz}}</ref><ref name="kell3">{{cite web|url=http://www.kel.com.au/products/kpr35c3.htm|title=Specification: KPR35C3 HF Radar Receiver|accessdate=2006-11-29|work=KEL Aerospace website|publisher=KEL Aerospace|quote=RF Input Frequency Range: 5 to 30MHz}}</ref>, which is far lower than most other civilian and military radars that operate in the [[microwave]] frequency band.

The JORN [[ionosonde]] network is made up of vertical ionosondes, providing a real time map of the ionosphere.  Each vertical incidence sounder (VIS) is a standardized Single-Receiver "[http://umlcar.uml.edu/digisonde_dps.html Digisonde]" Portable Sounder built by [[University_of_Massachusetts_Lowell|Lowell]] for the JORN. A new ionospheric map is generated every 225 seconds.<ref name="Gardiner-Garden">{{cite conference|first=R.S.|last=Gardiner-Garden|title=Ionospheric variability in sounding data from JORN|booktitle=Workshop on the Applications of Radio Science (WARS)|date=2006-02|location=Leura, NSW|url =http://www.ips.gov.au/IPSHosted/NCRS/wars/wars2006/proceedings/poster/gardiner_garden_p.ppt|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>  In a clockwise direction around [[Australia]], the locations of the twelve (11 active and one test) JORN ionosondes are below.

==Operation and uses==
The JORN network is operated by [[No. 1 Radar Surveillance Unit RAAF]] (1RSU). Data from the JORN sites is fed to the JORN Correlation Centre at [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]] where it is passed on to other agencies and military units. Officially the system allows the [[Australian Defence Force]] to observe all air and sea activity north of Australia to distances of 3000km. This encompasses all of Java, Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and halfway across the Indian Ocean. Other sources put the range at 4000km from the Australian coastline<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.rfsworld.com/StayConnected/pdf/Stay2_98.pdf|title=JORN HF Antenna Arrays Project Completed|accessdate=2006-11-21|last=Styles|first=Barry|date=1998 (issue 2)|format=[[PDF]]|work=Stay Connected: The Radio Frequency Systems Bulletin|publisher=Radio Frequency Systems (RFS)|pages= 11-12|quote=RFS Australia proudly completes the USD25M Antenna Arrays for the Jindalee Operational Radar Network on time, on budget and within specification.

The JORN is so sensitive it was able to track planes taking off and landing in East Timor 2600 km away.  It is able to detect a [[Cessna 172]] aeroplane and research is underway to increase the sensitivity by "up to 100 fold"<ref name=alicespringsnews />. It is also reportedly able to detect stealth aircraft <ref name=sinclairjones />; aside from the fact that most stealthy aircraft are optimized for defeating much higher-frequency radar from front-on rather than low-frequency radars from above, JORN is reputedly able to detect aircraft wake turbulence.
