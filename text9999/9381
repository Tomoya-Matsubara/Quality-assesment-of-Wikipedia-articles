'''Fred McFeely Rogers''' (March 20, 1928 <U+2013> February 27, 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[educator]], [[Presbyterian]] [[Minister (religion)|minister]], [[songwriter]], and [[television]] host. Rogers was the host of the [[television]] show ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', in production from 1968 to 2001.

== Personal life ==
Rogers was born in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]], [[Pennsylvania]], a town located 40&nbsp;miles (65&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Pittsburgh]]. He was born to James and Nancy Rogers; he spent many years as an only child. Early in his life he spent much of his free time with his maternal grandfather, Fred McFeely, and had an interest in music. He would often sing along as his mother would play the piano and, at the age of 5, began to play the piano as well.<ref>[http://www.wqed.org/mag/archives/index_0403.shtml Pittsburgh Magazine]</ref> 

Rogers graduated from Latrobe [[High School]] (1946), where [[Orrin Hatch]] was a contemporary.<ref>

==Television career==
===Early work in television===

Fred Rogers had a life-changing moment when he first saw television in his parents' home. He entered [[seminary]] after college, but was diverted into [[television]] after his first experience as a viewer; he wanted to explore the potential of the medium. In an interview with [[CNN]] conducted a few years before his death, Rogers stated, "I went into television because I hated it so, and I thought there was some way of using this fabulous instrument to be of nurture to those who would watch and listen."<ref>[http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/08/10/rogers/index.html Salon Brilliant Careers | Fred Rogers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

He thus applied for a job at [[NBC]] in [[New York]] and was accepted because of his music degree. Rogers moved to New York in 1951 and spent three years working in the production staff for music-centered programming such as ''NBC Opera Theater''. He also worked on [[Gabby Hayes]]' show for children. Ultimately, Rogers decided that commercial television's reliance on advertisement and merchandising undermined its ability to educate or enrich young audiences, so he quit working at NBC.

In 1954, he began working at [[WQED (TV)|WQED]], a Pittsburgh [[public television]] station, as a [[puppeteer]] on a local children's series, ''The Children's Corner''. For the next seven years, he worked with host [[Josie Carey]] in unscripted [[live TV]], developing many of the puppets, characters and music used in his later work, such as [[King Friday XIII]], and Curious X the Owl. 

Rogers began wearing his famous [[sneakers]] when he found them to be quieter than his work shoes when he moved about behind the set. He was also the voices behind King Friday XIII and Queen Sara Saturday (named after his wife), rulers of the neighborhood, as well as X the Owl, [[Henrietta Pussycat]], Daniel Striped Tiger, Lady Elaine Fairchild, and [[Donkey Hodie]]. The show won a Sylvania Award<ref>[http://uv201.com/TV_Pages/sylvania_award.htm Sylvania Award page 1952-1958]</ref> for best children's show, and was briefly broadcast nationally on NBC. 

For eight years during this period, he would leave the WQED studios during his lunch breaks to study [[theology]] at the nearby [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary]].  Rogers, however, was not interested in preaching, and after his ordination, he was specifically charged to continue his work with children's television. He had also done work at the [[University of Pittsburgh|University of Pittsburgh's]] Graduate School of Child Development.

In 1963, Rogers moved to [[Toronto]], where he was contracted by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) to develop a 15-minute children's television program: ''Misterogers'' (sic),<ref name=MBC>Roger's 1963 CBC show was ''Misterogers'' <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>.

|title=Fred McFeeley Rogers, U.S. Children's Television Host/Producer
|author=Williams, Suzanne
|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications}}</ref> which would be his debut in front of the [[Professional video camera|camera]]. The show was a hit with children, but lasted for only three seasons on the [[network television|network]]. Many of his famous set pieces, such as Trolley, [[Eiffel Tower]], the 'tree', and 'castle' were all created by designers at the CBC. While on production in Canada, Rogers brought with him his friend and [[understudy]], [[Ernie Coombs]], who would go on to create ''[[Mr. Dressup]]'', a very successful and long running children's show in Canada which, in many ways, was similar to ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood''.  ''Mr. Dressup'' had also used some of the songs that would later go on Rogers' later program.

In 1966, Rogers acquired the rights to his program from the CBC, and moved the show to WQED in Pittsburgh, where he had worked on ''The Children's Corner''. He developed the new show for the [[Eastern Educational Network]]. Stations that carried the program were limited, but included educational stations in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Washington, DC]] and [[New York City]]. 

After returning to Pittsburgh, Rogers attended and participated in activities at the Sixth Presbyterian church in the [[Squirrel Hill]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh, a [[More Light]] congregation which he attended until his death.<ref>http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030504mccall0504p4.asp</ref>   

Distribution of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' began on February 19, 1968. The following year, the show moved to [[PBS]] (Public Broadcasting Service). In 1971, Rogers formed Family Communications, Inc. (FCI), and the company established offices in the WQED building in Pittsburgh. Initially, the company served solely as the production arm of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'', but now develops and produces an array of children's programming and educational materials.

===''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood''===
{{Main|Mister Rogers' Neighborhood}}

''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' began airing in 1968 and ran for 895 episodes; the last set of new episodes were taped in December 2000, and began airing in August 2001. At its peak, in 1985, 8 percent of households tuned in to the show.<ref>[http://www.wqed.org/mag/archives/index_0403.shtml Pittsburgh Magazine]</ref>

* Each episode begins the same way, with Mister Rogers walking until he is coming home and singing his theme song, "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" and changing into [[Sneaker (footwear)|sneakers]] and a zippered [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] sweater.   <ref name="Sweater">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-13|url=http://wpsu.org/sweater/
|title=Mister Rogers' Hood Sweater Drive
|publisher=WPSU TV/FM, Penn State Public Broadcasting}}</ref>
* In an episode, Rogers might have an earnest conversation with his television audience, interact with live guests, take a field trip to a nearby place such as a [[bakery]] or [[music store]], or watch a short film. 
* Typical video subject matter includes demonstrations of how inanimate objects, such as [[bulldozers]] and [[crayons]], work or are manufactured. 
* Each episode includes a trip to Rogers' "[[Neighborhood of Make-Believe]]", which features a trolley that has its own chiming theme song, a castle, and the kingdom's citizens, including King Friday XIII ([[Friday the 13th]]). The subjects discussed in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe often allow further development of thematic elements discussed in Mister Rogers' "real" neighborhood.
* Mister Rogers often fed his fish during episodes.  They were originally named Fennel and Frieda.
* Typically, each week's episodes explore a major theme, such as going to school for the first time.  Originally, most episodes ended with a song entitled "Tomorrow", while Friday episodes looked forward to the week ahead with an adapted version of "It's Such a Good Feeling."  In later seasons, all episodes ended with "Feeling."

Visually, the presentation of the show was very simple; it did not feature the [[animation]] or fast pace of other children's shows. Rogers composed all the music for his series. He was concerned with teaching children to love themselves and others. He also tried to address common childhood fears with comforting songs and [[skit]]s. For example, one of his famous songs explains how you can't be pulled down the [[bathtub]] drain<U+2014>because you won't fit. He even once took a trip to the [[Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh]] to show children that a hospital is not a place to fear. During the [[Gulf War]] in 1990-91, he assured his audience that all children in the neighborhood would be well cared for, and asked parents to promise to take care of their own children. The  message was aired again by PBS during the media storm that preceded the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|military action]] against [[Iraq]] in 2003.

===Other television work===
In 1994, Rogers created another one-time special for PBS called ''Fred Rogers' Heroes'' which consisted of documentary portraits of four real-life people whose work helped make their communities better.  Rogers, uncharacteristically dressed in a suit and tie, hosted in wraparound segments which did not use the "Neighborhood" set.

For a time Rogers produced specials for parents as a precursor to the subject of the week on the Neighborhood called "Mister Rogers Talks To Parents About (whatever the topic was)".  Rogers didn't host those specials though as other people like [[Joan Lunden]], who hosted the Conflict special, and other news announcers played MC duties in front of a gallery of parents while Rogers answered questions from them.  These specials were made to prep the parents for any questions the children might ask after watching the episodes on that topic of the week.

The only time Rogers appeared on television as someone other than himself was in 1996, when he played a preacher on one episode of ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]].''<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.wqed.org/mag/0403_remember3.shtml WQED Multimedia: Pittsburgh Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

In the mid-1980s, the [[Burger King]] fast-food chain lampooned Rogers' image with an actor called "Mr. Rodney", imitating Rogers' television character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v18/ai_3275741/|title=Burger King ad strategy pushes unit volumes near $1M|last=Edwards|first=Joe|date=1984-05-21|work=Nation's Restaurant News|accessdate=2009-05-16}}</ref> Rogers found the character's pitching fast food as confusing to children, and called a press conference in which he stated that he did not endorse the company's use of his character or likeness (Rogers did no commercial endorsements of any kind throughout his career, though he acted as a pitchman for several non-profit organizations dedicated to learning over the years).  The chain publicly apologized for the ''[[faux pas]]'', and pulled the ads.

===Emmys for programming===
''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' won four [[Emmy]] awards, and Rogers received one for lifetime achievement. 

During the 1997 [[Daytime Emmys]], the Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Rogers. The following is an excerpt from ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'s'' coverage of the gala, written by Tom Junod:

{{cquote|Mister Rogers went onstage to accept the award <U+2014> and there, in front of all the soap opera stars and talk show sinceratrons, in front of all the jutting man-tanned jaws and jutting saltwater bosoms, he made his small bow and said into the microphone, "All of us have special ones who have loved us into being. Would you just take, along with me, ten seconds to think of the people who have helped you become who you are. Ten seconds of silence."

And then he lifted his wrist, looked at the audience, looked at his watch, and said, 'I'll watch the time." There was, at first, a small whoop from the crowd, a giddy, strangled hiccup of laughter, as people realized that he wasn't kidding, that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch, but rather a man, an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked. And so they did. One second, two seconds, seven seconds <U+2014> and now the jaws clenched, and the bosoms heaved, and the mascara ran, and the tears fell upon the beglittered gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier. And Mister Rogers finally looked up from his watch and said softly "May God be with you," to all his vanquished children.<ref name="junod">Tom Junod.

== Advocacy ==
=== Mister Rogers and PBS funding ===
In 1969, Rogers appeared before the [[United States Senate]] [[United States Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet|Subcommittee on Communications]]. His goal was to support funding for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], in response to significant proposed cuts. In about six minutes of testimony, Rogers spoke of the need for social and emotional education that public television provided. He passionately argued that alternative television programming like his ''Neighborhood'' helped encourage children to become happy and productive citizens, sometimes opposing less positive messages in media and in popular culture. He even recited the lyrics to one of his songs.

The chairman of the subcommittee, [[John O. Pastore]], was not previously familiar with Rogers' work, and was sometimes described as gruff and impatient. However, he reported that the testimony had given him goosebumps, and declared, "I think it's wonderful. Looks like you just earned the $20&nbsp;million." The subsequent congressional appropriation, for 1971, increased PBS funding from $9&nbsp;million to $22&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2883185966575573317

=== Mister Rogers and the VCR ===
During the controversy surrounding the introduction of the household [[videocassette recorder|VCR]], Rogers was involved in supporting the manufacturers of VCRs in court. His 1979 [[testimony]] in the case ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'' noted that he did not object to home recording of his television programs, for instance, by families in order to watch together at a later time. This testimony contrasted with the views of others in the television industry who objected to home recording or believed that devices to facilitate it should be taxed or regulated.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] considered the testimony of Rogers in its decision that held that the [[Betamax]] video recorder did not [[Copyright infringement|infringe copyright]]. The Court stated that his views were a notable piece of evidence "that many [television] producers are willing to allow private time-shifting to continue" and even quoted his testimony in a footnote:

{{cquote|Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the "Neighborhood" at hours when some children cannot use it ... I have always felt that with the advent of all of this new technology that allows people to tape the "Neighborhood" off-the-air, and I'm speaking for the "Neighborhood" because that's what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of their family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been "You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions." Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/464_US_417.htm#464us417n27 Sony Corp. of Amer. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.], 464 U.S. 417 (1984) n27</ref>}}

The [[Home Recording Rights Coalition]] later stated that Rogers was "one of the most prominent witnesses on this issue."

Rogers had been a supporter of VCR use since its very early days.  In his final week of episodes of the original run in 1976, Rogers used a [[U-Matic]] VCR to show scenes from past episodes, as a way to prepare viewers for repeats that would begin the following week.

== Death and memorial ==

Speakers remembered Rogers' love of children, devotion to his religion, enthusiasm for music, and quirks. Teresa Heinz Kerry said of Rogers, "He never condescended, just invited us into his conversation.  He spoke to us as the people we were, not as the people others wished we were."

On [[New Years Day]] of 2004, [[Michael Keaton]] hosted the PBS TV special "Mr. Rogers: America's Favorite Neighbor". It was released on DVD September 28 that year. Keaton was a former stagehand on the show before he quit to become an actor.

To mark what would have been his 80th birthday, Rogers' production company sponsored several events to memorialize him, including  "Won't You Wear a Sweater Day", during which fans and neighbors were asked to wear their favorite sweaters in celebration.<ref>[http://www.fci.org/NeighborDays/sweater.asp Won't You Be My Neighbor Days<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVeyLr2fGNA YouTube - Mister Rogers: "Won't You Wear a Sweater?"
