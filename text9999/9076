'''British war crimes''' are crimes committed by the [[armed forces of the United Kingdom]] from its formation in 1707 to the present day.

===Rapes===
Austin J. App's book, ''Ravishing the Women of Conquered Europe'', claims that some 2,000,000 German women were raped in 1945, <!-- in one year alone?? --> not only by members of the [[Red Army]] but also by American and British troops.<ref>Biggs, Barton (2010). ''Wealth, War and Wisdom. ''John Wiley & Sons, p. 311; ISBN 1118039440</ref> According to writer Sean Longden, although far from the scale of those committed by the Soviets, rapes of local women were a common feature among British troops in Germany. Even elderly women were targeted. The [[Royal Military Police]] tended to turn a blind eye towards abuse of German prisoners and civilians but rape was a major issue for them. Some officers reportedly treated this behaviour with leniency.<ref name=":23">Longden, Sean (2004) ''To the victor the spoils: D-Day to VE Day, the reality behind the heroism''. Arris Books, p. 195; ISBN 1844370380</ref> 

Many rapes resulted from alcohol or post-traumatic stress, but there were also instances of premeditated attacks, such as the assault on three German women in the town of Neustadt am R<U+00FC>bemberge and the attempted gang-rape of two local girls at gunpoint in the village of Oyle, near [[Nienburg, Lower Saxony|Nienburg]], which ended in the death of one of the women when a soldier (it is not clear if unintentionally or otherwise) discharged his gun, striking her in the neck. There were also reports of "sexual assault and offences" committed by British soldiers against children in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]; a number of servicemen were convicted of these crimes while fraternizing with Dutch and Belgian families during the winter of 1944-45.<ref name=":23"/>

This more remote camp near Garissa, eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial "rehabilitation process" or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work.
