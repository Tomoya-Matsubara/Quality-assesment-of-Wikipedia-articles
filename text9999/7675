'''Alpha Kappa Alpha''' '''(<U+0386><U+039A><U+0386>)''' was the first [[Greek alphabet|Greek-lettered]] of four [[sorority|sororities]] established and incorporated by [[African-American]] college women. The sorority was founded on [[January 15]], [[1908]], at [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] by a group of nine students, led by [[Ethel Hedgeman Lyle]]. Forming a sorority broke barriers for African-American women in areas where little power or authority existed due to a lack of opportunities for minorities and women in the early twentieth century.<ref>Tamara L. Brown, Gregory Parks, Clarenda M. Phillips, ''African American Fraternities and Sororities: The Legacy and the Vision''. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2005. p.342</ref> Alpha Kappa Alpha was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] on [[January 29]], [[1913]].

Consisting of college-educated women of [[Black race|African]], [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Asian people|Asian]], and [[Hispanic]] descent, the sorority serves through a membership of more than 200,000 women in over 975 chapters in the United States and several other countries.<ref name=AKAmember/> Women may join through undergraduate chapters at a college or university, or through a graduate chapter after acquiring a college degree.<ref name=AKAint>{{cite web |date=2006 |url=http://www.akainternational.org/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=34    |title=Historical Overview|publisher=Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. - International Region|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>  

Since being founded a century ago, Alpha Kappa Alpha has helped to improve social and economic conditions through community service programs. Members have improved education through independent initiatives, contributed to community-building by creating programs and associations &ndash; such as the Mississippi Health Clinic &ndash; and influenced federal legislation by [[U.S. Congress|Congressional]] lobbying through the National Non-Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights. The sorority works with communities through service initiatives and progressive programs relating to education, family, health, and business. 

Alpha Kappa Alpha is part of the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] (NPHC). The current International President is [[Barbara A. McKinzie]], and the sorority's document and pictorial archives are located at [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]].

===Beginnings: 1907&ndash;1912===
In Spring 1907, Ethel Hedgeman led the efforts to create a sisterhood at Howard University.

At the time, Alpha Kappa Alpha existed as one chapter at Howard University with a ritual and sponsored social events. No plan of nationalizing or incorprorating the organization existed.<ref name=quander>{{cite web |url=http://www.thequanderquality.com/nellie2.htm |title=Nellie Quander, Page Two |publisher=The Quander Quality|accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref> Alpha Kappa Alpha continued to grow at Howard. In [[October 11]], [[1912]], twenty-two members were initiated into Alpha Kappa Alpha. Seven officers were elected: [[Myra Hemmings]], president; [[Ethel Cuff Black|Ethel Black]], vice-president, [[Delta Sigma Theta Sorority#Delta Founders|Edith Young]], secretary; [[Delta Sigma Theta Sorority#Delta Founders|Jessie Dent]], corresponding secretary, [[Winona Cargile Alexander|Winona Alexander]], custodian; [[Delta Sigma Theta Sorority#Delta Founders|Frederica Dodd]], sergeant-at-arms, and [[Delta Sigma Theta Sorority#Delta Founders|Pauline Minor]] was the treasurer.<ref>Parker 1979, op. cit., p. 30.</ref><ref>Giddings, op. cit., p. 48.</ref> The twenty-two were dismayed at progress and wanted to reorganize the sorority.<ref name=skip4>{{cite web |last=Mason |first=Herman "Skip" |date=1999-04-20 |url=http://www.skipmason.com/hm/hm04.htm |title=The <U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391>/<U+0394><U+03A3><U+0398> Connection |publisher=skipmason.com |accessdate=2006-04-14}}</ref><ref name="giddings-49">Giddings, op. cit., p. 49.</ref> 

According to Delta Sigma Theta historian [[Paula Giddings]], the group of members wanted to establish a national organization, enlarge the scope of activities of the sorority, change its name and symbols, and be more politically oriented.<ref name=giddings-49/> When [[Nellie Quander]], a graduate member, heard about changing the sorority name, she disagreed and gave the other women a deadline to stop the efforts to reorganize the sorority.<ref>Giddings, op. cit., pp. 50<U+2013>51.</ref>  However, the twenty-two declined and instead formed Delta Sigma Theta on [[January 13]], [[1913]].<ref>Giddings, op. cit., p. 53.</ref>  

Later Quander, along with five other sorority members, led an initiative to incorporate Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority as a perpetual body on [[January 29]], [[1913]].<ref name=lambdaeta-1/> The organization was nationally incorporated in Washington, D.C., as a [[non-profit]] under the name '''Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated''' on [[January 30]], [[1913]].<ref name=dcra>{{cite web |url=http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=6337 |title=District of Columbia Organization Information |publisher=dcra.dc.gov |accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> During the same year the sorority began using Greek names for officers.<ref>McNealey 2006, op. cit., p. 331.</ref>

Throughout the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], members assisted the Travelers Aid Society, to help thousands of [[Southern United States|Southern]] Blacks adjust to [[Northern United States|Northern]] society, find housing and navigate around the city.

Candidates who withstood this period were initiated into the sorority.<ref name=log/> Membership interest is processed by an interest meeting, known as a "rush". After the candidate receives an official letter from the sorority, she can participate in the membership intake process. Prospective members must have a C+ average prior to their membership submission as well as have a record in community service. If a prospective member has graduated, that member could be invited to join the sorority at the discretion of the graduate chapter.<ref name=prospective>{{cite web |first=Alpha Kappa Alpha - Prospective Members Chapter|date=2006|url=http://www.aka1908.com/present/membership/prospectivemembers/

[[Image:EAFlogo.png|150px|thumb|Official logo of the Educational Advancement Foundation]]
Alpha Kappa Alpha's Educational Advancement Foundation (EAF) is a separate and [[tax-exempt]] branch of the sorority, which "provide[s] financial support to individuals and organizations engaged in lifelong learning."<ref name=aboutEAF>{{cite web |url=http://www.akaeaf.org/about/|title=About Educational Advancement Foundation|publisher=Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated - Educational Advancement Foundation|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> The foundation awards academic scholarships (for undergraduate members of the sorority, as well as non-members), [[Fellow|fellowship]]s, and [[Grant (money)|grants]] for community service.<ref name=PASEAF>{{cite web |url=http://www.akaeaf.org/programsandinitiatives/|title=AKA Educational Advancement Foundation Programs|publisher=Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated - Educational Advancement Foundation|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> 

====History and donations====
The foundation was the brainchild of Constance Holland, the sister of former Alpha Kappa Alpha International President Dr. Barbara Phillips, in 1978.  The foundation had official beginnings in 1980 and the sorority donated US$10,000 for the project. Eight years later, the organization first awarded $10,000 to fourteen students.  In 1991, EAF first awarded mini-grants to community organizations.  In 1998, EAF provided the first Youth Partners Accessing Capital (P.A.C.) award to an undergraduate member.  

At the organization's twentieth anniversary in 2000, EAF published ''Perpetuating Our Posterity: A Blueprint for Excellence.'' The book served as a comprehensive history of the organization and as a source of advice for other beginning philanthropies. EAF went online with a [[website]] in 2003. 

The organization celebrated a silver anniversary in [[Nassau, Bahamas]] in 2005. EAF is incorporated into International President Barbara A. MacKenzie's centennial program for funding under '''E'''xcellent '''S'''cholarly '''P'''erformance.
