'''S<U+00F8>ren Aabye Kierkegaard''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[<U+02C8>s<U+0153><U+02D0><U+0250>n <U+02C8>k<U+02B0>i<U+0250><U+032F>g<U+030A><U+0259><U+02CC>g<U+030A><U+0252><U+02D0><U+02C0>]}}, but usually [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] as {{IPA|[<U+02C8>kirk<U+0259>g<U+0251>(<U+0279>)d]}}; {{audio|DA-S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard.ogg|Listen}}<!-- What dialect/language is this supposed to represent a pronunciation in? Danish filtered through UK RP English? -->) [[5 May]], [[1813]] &ndash; [[11 November]], [[1855]]) was a prolific 19th century [[Denmark|Danish]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]]. Kierkegaard strongly criticized both the [[Hegelianism]] of his time, and what he saw as the empty [[ceremony|formalities]] of the [[Church of Denmark|Danish church]]. Much of his work deals with religious problems such as the nature of faith, the institution of the [[Christian Church]], Christian ethics and theology, and the [[emotion]]s and [[feeling]]s of individuals when faced with life choices. His early work was written under various [[pseudonym]]s who present their own distinctive viewpoints in a complex dialogue. Kierkegaard left the task of discovering the meaning of the works to the reader, because "the task must be made difficult, for only the difficult inspires the noble-hearted".<ref>Kierkegaard, S<U+00F8>ren. ''Journals and Papers'', Indiana University Press, ISBN 0253182409</ref> Subsequently, many have interpreted Kierkegaard as an [[existentialist]], [[neo-orthodox]]ist, [[postmodernist]], [[Humanistic psychology|humanist]], [[individualist]], etc.. Crossing the boundaries of [[philosophy]], [[theology]], [[psychology]], and [[literature]], Kierkegaard came to be regarded as a highly significant and influential figure in contemporary thought.<ref>Hubben, William.

==Life==
===Early years (1813&ndash;1841)===
S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard was born to an affluent family in [[Copenhagen]], the capital of Denmark. His father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard, was a strongly religious man. Convinced that he had earned God's wrath, he believed that none of his children would live past the age attained by Jesus Christ, that of 33. He believed his personal [[sin]]s, such as cursing the name of God in his youth and possibly impregnating Kierkegaard's mother out of wedlock, necessitated this punishment. Though many of his seven children died young, his prediction was disproved when two of them surpassed this age. This early introduction to the notion of sin and its connection from father and son laid the foundation for much of Kierkegaard's work (particularly ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''). Kierkegaard's mother, Anne S<U+00F8>rensdatter Lund Kierkegaard, is not directly referred to in his books, although she too affected his later writings. Despite his father's occasional religious melancholy, Kierkegaard and his father shared a close bond. Kierkegaard learned to explore the realm of his imagination through a series of exercises and games they played together.

Kierkegaard's father died on [[August 9]], [[1838]] at the age of 82. Before his death, he asked S<U+00F8>ren to become a pastor. S<U+00F8>ren was deeply influenced by his father's religious experience and life and felt obligated to fulfill his wish. Two days later, on [[August 11]], Kierkegaard wrote:  ''"My father died on Wednesday.<ref>According to the ''Journals'', Michael died at approximately 2:00 a.m., early Thursday morning.</ref> I had so very much wished that he might live a few years longer, and I look upon his death as the last sacrifice which he made to his love for me; ... he died for me in order that, if possible, I might still turn into something. Of all that I have inherited from him, the recollection of him, his transfigured portrait ... is dearest to me, and I will be careful to preserve [his memory] safely hidden from the world."''<ref name="Dru">Dru, Alexander. ''The Journals of S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard'', Oxford University Press, 1938.</ref>

Kierkegaard attended the School of Civic Virtue, excelling at [[Latin]] and [[history]]. He went on to study [[theology]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], but while there he was drawn more towards [[philosophy]] and [[literature]]. At university, Kierkegaard wrote his dissertation, ''[[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]'', which was found by the university panel to be a noteworthy and well-thought out work, but a little too wordy and literary for a philosophy thesis.<ref name="irony">Kierkegaard, S<U+00F8>ren. ''The Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates'', Princeton University Press 1989, ISBN 0691073546</ref>  Kierkegaard graduated on [[October 20]], [[1841]] with a ''Magister Artium'', which today would be designated a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]. With his family's inheritance, Kierkegaard was able to fund his education, his living, and several publications of his early works.

===Regine Olsen (1837&ndash;1841)===
[[Image:Regine olsen.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Regine Olsen, the love of his life, and a muse for his writings.]]

Another important aspect of Kierkegaard's life (generally considered to have had a major influence on his work) was his broken engagement to [[Regine Olsen]] (1822 - 1904). Kierkegaard met Regine on [[8 May]], [[1837]] and was instantly attracted to her, and she to him. In his journals, Kierkegaard wrote about his love for Regine:

{{Quotation|Thou sovereign of my heart treasured in the deepest fastness of my chest, in the fullness of my thought, there ... unknown divinity!  Oh, can I really believe the poet's tales, that when one first sees the object of one's love, one imagines one has seen her long ago, that all love like all knowledge is remembrance, that love too has its prophecies in the individual. ... it seems to me that I should have to possess the beauty of all girls in order to draw out a beauty equal to yours; that I should have to circumnavigate the world in order to find the place I lack and which the deepest mystery of my whole being points towards, and at the next moment you are so near to me, filling my spirit so powerfully that I am transfigured for myself, and feel that it's good to be here.|S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard|Journals<ref name="Dru"/> ([[2 February]] [[1839]])}}

On [[8 September]], [[1840]], Kierkegaard formally proposed to Regine. However, Kierkegaard soon felt disillusioned and melancholic about the marriage. Less than a year after he had proposed, he broke it off on [[11 August]], [[1841]]. In his Journals, Kierkegaard mentions his belief that his "melancholy" made him unsuitable for marriage, but his precise motive for ending the engagement remains unclear.  It is generally believed that the two were deeply in love, perhaps even after she married [[Johan Frederik Schlegel]] (1817&ndash;1896), a prominent civil servant (not to be confused with the German philosopher [[Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich von Schlegel]], (1772-1829) ). For the most part, their contact was limited to chance meetings on the streets of [[Copenhagen]]. Some years later, however, Kierkegaard went so far as to ask Regine's husband for permission to speak with her, but Schlegel refused. 

Soon afterwards, the couple left the country, Schlegel having been appointed Governor in the [[Danish West Indies]]. By the time Regine returned, Kierkegaard was dead. Regine Schlegel lived until 1904, and upon her death she was buried near Kierkegaard in the [[Assistens Cemetery]] in Copenhagen.

===First Authorship (1841 &ndash; 1846)===
Although Kierkegaard wrote a few articles on politics, women, and entertainment in his youth and university days, many scholars believe Kierkegaard's first noteworthy work is either his university thesis, ''[[The Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]'', which was presented in 1841, or his masterpiece and arguably greatest work, ''[[Either/Or]]'', which was published in 1843. In either case, both works critiqued major figures in Western philosophic thought ([[Socrates]] in the former and [[Hegel]] in the latter), showcased Kierkegaard's unique style of writing, and displayed a maturity in writing from his works of youth. ''[[Either/Or]]'' was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in [[Berlin]] and was completed in the autumn of 1842.

[[Image:manuscript_philosophical_fragments.png|250px|thumb|Kierkegaard's manuscript of [[Philosophical Fragments]].<ref name="manuscript">{{cite web | title=Manuscripts from the S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard Archive | work=Royal Library of Denmark | url=http://www.kb.dk/kultur/expo/sk-mss/index-en.htm | accessdate=April 23 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>]] 

In the same year ''Either/Or'' was published, Kierkegaard found out Regine was engaged to be married to [[Johan Frederik Schlegel]]. This fact affected Kierkegaard and his subsequent writings deeply. In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', published in late 1843, one can interpret a section in the work as saying: 'Kierkegaard hopes that through a divine act, Regine would return to him'.<ref name=Lippitt>Lippitt, John. ''Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Kierkegaard and Fear and Trembling''. Routledge, 2003, ISBN 9780415180474</ref> ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]'', published on the very same day as ''Fear and Trembling'', is about a young gentleman leaving his beloved. Several other works in this period make similar overtones of the Kierkegaard-Olsen relationship.

Other major works in this period focus on a critique of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and form a basis for [[existential psychology]]. ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', ''[[The Concept of Dread]]'', and ''[[Stages on Life's Way]]'' are about thoughts and feelings an individual may face in life, existential choices and its consequences, and whether or not to embrace religion, specifically [[Christianity]], in one's life. Perhaps the most valiant attack on [[Hegelianism]] is the ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'' which discusses the importance of the individual, subjectivity as truth, and countering the Hegelian claim that "The Rational is the Real and the Real is the Rational".<ref name="Hegel">Hegel, G.W.F. ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', Oxford University Press, 1979, ISBN 0198245971</ref>

Most of the works in this authorship were philosophical in nature and written pseudonymously and indirectly, representing different view-points and ways of life. However, Kierkegaard published two or three theological discourses, written under his own name, for each of the respective philosophical works.<ref>In English, they've been collected in the ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Princeton University Press, ISBN 0691020876.</ref> Kierkegaard wrote these discourses to clarify philosophical aspects of the pseudonymous work, discuss the theological aspects of the work, and edify the reader.<ref>{{cite web | title=D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on the Discourses | work=D. Anthony Storm | url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org/kw5.htm | accessdate=November 9 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Corsair Affair (1845&ndash;1846)===
On [[22 December]], [[1845]], [[Peder Ludvig M<U+00F8>ller]] published an article critiquing ''[[Stages on Life's Way]]''. The article gave ''Stages'' a poor review, but showed little understanding of the work. M<U+00F8>ller was also a contributor of ''[[Corsaren|The Corsair]]'', a Danish satirical paper that lampooned people of notable standing. Kierkegaard wrote a response in order to defend the work, ridicule M<U+00F8>ller, and bring down ''The Corsair'', earning him the ire of the paper and its editor, [[Me<U+00EF>r Aaron Goldschmidt]]. 

The only two articles that Kierkegaard wrote in response to M<U+00F8>ller were ''[[Activity of a Traveling Esthetician]]'' and ''[[Dialectical Result of a Literary Police Action]]''. The former focused on insulting M<U+00F8>ller's integrity and responding to his critique. The latter was a directed assault on ''The Corsair'', in which Kierkegaard openly asked to be satirized.

{{Quotation|With a paper like ''The Corsair'', which hitherto has been read by many and all kinds of people and essentially has enjoyed the recognition of being ignored, despised, and never answered, the only thing to be done in writing in order to express the literary, moral order of things<U+2014>reflected in the inversion that this paper with meager competence and extreme effort has sought to bring about<U+2014>was for someone immortalized and praised in this paper to make application to be abused by the same paper ... May I ask to be abused<U+2014>the personal injury of being immortalized by ''The Corsair'' is just too much.|S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard|Dialectical Result of a Literary Police Action<ref>Kierkegaard, S<U+00F8>ren. ''Dialectical Result of a Literary Police Action'' in ''Essential Kierkegaard''.</ref>}}

Over the next few months, ''The Corsair'' took Kierkegaard up on his offer to "be abused", and unleashed a series of attacks making fun of Kierkegaard's appearance, voice, and habits. For months, he was harassed on the streets of Denmark. 
In an 1846 journal entry, Kierkegaard makes a long, detailed explanation of his attack on M<U+00F8>ller and ''The Corsair'', and also explains that this attack made him quit his indirect communication authorship:

{{Quotation|The days of my authorship are past, God be praised. I have been granted the satisfaction of bringing it to a conclusion myself, understanding when it is fitting that I should make an end, and next after the publication of ''[[Either/Or]]'' I thank God for that. That this, once again, is not how people would see it, that I could actually prove in two words that it is so. I know quite well and find [my authorship] quite in order. But it has pained me; it seemed to me that I might have asked for that admission; but let it be. If only I can manage to become a priest. However, much of my present life may have satisfied me: I shall breathe more freely in that quiet activity, allowing myself an occasional literary work in my free time.|S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard|Journals<ref name="Dru"/> ([[9 March]] [[1846]])}}

===Second Authorship (1846&ndash;1853)===
[[Image:Sicknessmanuscript.jpg|300px|thumb|Kierkegaard's manuscript of ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''.<ref name="manuscript" />]] 

Whereas his first authorship focused on Hegel, this authorship focused on the [[hypocrisy]] of Christendom. It is important to realise that by '[[Christendom]]' Kierkegaard meant not Christianity itself, but rather the church and the applied religion of his society. After the Corsair incident, Kierkegaard became interested in "the public" and the individual's interaction with it. His first work in this period of his life was ''[[Two Ages: A Literary Review]]'' which was a critique of the novel ''Two Ages'' (in some translations ''Two Generations'') written by [[Thomasine Christine Gyllembourg-Ehrensv<U+00E4>rd]]. After giving his critique of the story, Kierkegaard made several insightful observations on the nature of the present age and its passionless attitude towards life. One of his complaints about [[modernity]] is its passionless view of the world. Kierkegaard writes that "the present age is essentially a sensible age, devoid of passion ... The trend today is in the direction of mathematical equality, so that in all classes about so and so many uniformly make one individual". In this, Kierkegaard attacks the [[Conformism|conformity]] and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of individuals into an indifferent public, "the crowd".<ref name="LitRev">Kierkegaard, S<U+00F8>ren. ''A Literary Review'', Penguin Classics, 2001, ISBN 0140448012</ref>  Although Kierkegaard attacks the public, he is supportive of communities where individuals keep their diversity and uniqueness.

Other works continue to focus on the superficiality of "the crowd" attempting to limit and stifle the unique individual. ''[[The Book on Adler]]'' is a work about Pastor [[Adolf Peter Adler]]'s claim to have had a sacrilegious revelation and to have suffered ostracisation and expulsion from the pastorate as a consequence.

As part of his analysis of the crowd, Kierkegaard realized the decay and decadence of the [[Christian church]], especially the [[Church of Denmark|Danish State Church]]. Kierkegaard believed Christendom had "lost its way" on the Christian faith. Christendom in this period ignored, skewed, or gave mere 'lip service' to the original Christian doctrine. Kierkegaard felt his duty in this later era was to inform others about the shallowness of so-called "Christian living". He wrote several criticisms on contemporary Christianity in works such as ''[[Christian Discourses]]'', ''[[Works of Love]]'', and ''[[Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits]]''.

''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' is one of Kierkegaard's most popular works of this era, and although some contemporary atheistic philosophers and psychologists dismiss Kierkegaard's suggested solution as [[faith]], his analysis on the nature of [[Existential despair|despair]] is one of the best accounts on the subject and has been emulated in subsequent philosophies, such as [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s concept of existential guilt and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]'s [[Sartre and bad faith|bad faith]].

Around 1848, Kierkegaard began a literary attack on the [[Church of Denmark|Danish State Church]] with books such as ''[[Practice in Christianity]]'', ''[[For Self-Examination]]'', and ''[[Judge for Yourselves!]]'', which attempted to expound the true nature of Christianity, with [[Jesus]] as its role model.

===Attack upon Christendom (1854&ndash;1855)===
[[Image:KierkegaardGrave.jpg|250px|thumb|S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard's grave in Assistens Kirkeg<U+00E5>rd]]

Kierkegaard's final years were taken up with a sustained, outright attack on the [[Church of Denmark|Danish People's Church]] by means of newspaper articles published in ''The Fatherland'' (''F<U+00E6>drelandet'') and a series of self-published pamphlets called ''The Moment'' (''<U+00D8>jeblikket'').<ref>Lowrie, Walter. {{cite web | title=Kierkegaard's Attack on Christendom | work=House Church | url=http://www.hccentral.com/gkeys/kier.html | accessdate=April 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Kierkegaard was initially called to action by a speech by Professor [[Hans Lassen Martensen]] who called his recently deceased predecessor Bishop Jakob P. Mynster a "truth-witness, one of the authentic truth-witnesses."<ref name="Elmer">Duncan, Elmer. ''S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard: Maker of the Modern Theological Mind'', Word Books 1976, ISBN 0876804636</ref>

Kierkegaard had an affection towards Mynster, but had come to see that his conception of Christianity was in man's interest, rather than God's, and in no way was Mynster's life comparable to that of a 'truth-witness.' 

Before the tenth chapter of ''The Moment'' could be published, Kierkegaard collapsed on the street and was eventually taken to a hospital. He stayed in the hospital for over a month and refused to receive communion from a pastor, whom Kierkegaard regarded as merely an official and not a servant of God. 

He said to Emil Boesen, a friend since childhood who kept a record of his conversations with Kierkegaard and was himself a pastor, that his life had been one of great and unknown suffering, which looked like vanity to others but was not. 

Kierkegaard died in [[Frederiks Hospital|Frederik's Hospital]] after being there for over a month, possibly from complications from a fall he had taken from a tree when he was a boy. He was interred in the [[Assistens Cemetery|Assistens Kirkeg<U+00E5>rd]] in the [[N<U+00F8>rrebro]] section of Copenhagen. At Kierkegaard's funeral, his nephew Henrik Lund caused a disturbance by protesting that Kierkegaard was being buried by the official church even though in his life he had broken from and denounced it. Lund was later fined.

''Kierkegaard: A Kind of Poet'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971, ISBN 0812210425</ref> Two of his popular ideas are "subjectivity",<ref>Kierkegaard is not an extreme subjectivist; he would not reject the importance of objective truths.</ref> and the "leap to faith," popularly referred to as the "leap of faith."<ref name="leap">''The Danish equivalent to the English phrase "leap of faith" does not appear in the original Danish nor is the English phrase found in current English translations of Kierkegaard's works. However, Kierkegaard does mention the concepts of "faith" and "leap" together many times in his works. See ''Faith and the Kierkegaardian Leap'' in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard.</ref><ref name="CambComp" />  The [[leap of faith]] is his conception of how an individual would believe in God, or how a person would act in love. It is not a rational decision, as it is transcending rationality in favour of something more uncanny, that is, faith. As such he thought that to have faith is at the same time to have doubt. So, for example, for one to truly have faith in God, one would also have to doubt that God exists; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought, without which the faith would have no real substance. Doubt is an essential element of faith, an underpinning. In plain words, to believe or have faith that God exists, without ever having doubted God's existence or goodness, would not be a faith worth having. For example, it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists, when one is looking at it and touching it. In the same way, to believe or have faith in God is to know that one has no perceptual or any other access to God, and yet still has faith in God.<ref>''Kierkegaard attempted repeatedly to bring to focus the importance of doubt in the Christian way of life. A passage from his journals describes the idea of the forgiveness of sin:'' "To believe the forgiveness of one's sins is the decisive crisis whereby a human being becomes spirit; he who does not believe this is not spirit. ... Anyone who in truth has experienced and experiences what it is to believe the forgiveness of one's sins has indeed become another person."'' ''S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers'', ed. by Howard V. Hong, VIII A 673 n.d., 1848., Indiana University Press, 1976, ISBN 0253182409</ref>

Kierkegaard also stressed the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'' that "subjectivity is truth" and "truth is subjectivity."  This has to do with a distinction between what is objectively true - that a man named Jesus of Nazareth lived and died on a cross, for instance - and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth.  People who in ''some sense'' believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently.  Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor.  

Kierkegaard primarily discusses subjectivity with regard to religious matters, however.  As already noted, he argues that doubt is an element of faith and that it is impossible to gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ.  The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed ''likely'' to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all.  Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.<ref name="Conclude">Kierkegaard, S<U+00F8>ren. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', Princeton University Press, 1992, ISBN 0691020825</ref>

==Indirect communication and pseudonymous authorship==
[[Image:Kierkegaard Enten-Eller.jpg|150px|thumb|Either/Or, one of Kierkegaard's works, was authored under the pseudonyms "A" and "B," or Judge William, and edited under the pseudonym Victor Eremita.]]

Half of Kierkegaard's authorship was written behind the mask of several pseudonymous characters he created to represent different ways of thinking. This was part of Kierkegaard's [[indirect communication]]. According to several passages in his works and  journals, such as ''[[The Point of View of my Work as an Author]]'', Kierkegaard wrote this way in order to prevent his works from being treated as a philosophical system with a systematic structure. In the ''Point of View'', Kierkegaard wrote: "In the pseudonymous works, there is not a single word which is mine. I have no opinion about these works except as a third person, no knowledge of their meaning, except as a reader, not the remotest private relation to them."<ref name="PtView">Kierkegaard, S<U+00F8>ren. ''The Point of View'', Princeton University Press, 1998, ISBN 0691058555</ref>

Kierkegaard used indirect communication to make it difficult to ascertain whether he actually held any of the views presented in his works. He hoped readers would simply read the work at face value without attributing it to some aspect of his life. Kierkegaard also did not want his readers to treat his work as an authoritative system, but rather look to themselves for interpretation. 

Early Kierkegaardian scholars, such as [[Theodor W. Adorno]], have disregarded Kierkegaard's intentions and argue the entire authorship should be treated as Kierkegaard's own personal and religious views.<ref name="Adorno">Adorno, Theodor W. ''Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic'', University of Minnesota Press, 1933 (reprint 1989), ISBN 0816611866</ref>  This view leads to many confusions and contradictions which make Kierkegaard appear incoherent.<ref name="Marcia">Morgan, Marcia. {{cite web | title=Adorno<U+2019>s Reception of Kierkegaard: 1929-1933 | work=University of Potsdam | url=http://www.stolaf.edu/collections/kierkegaard/newsletter/issue46/46002.htm | accessdate=April 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref>  However, many later scholars such as the [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]], have respected Kierkegaard's intentions and interpreted his work by attributing the pseudonymous texts to their respective authors.

Kierkegaard's most important pseudonyms, in chronological order:

== Journals ==
[[Image:cover_journals_kierkegaard.png|200px|right|thumb|The cover of the first English edition of The Journals, edited by Alexander Dru in 1938.]]
Kierkegaard's journals are essential to understanding him and his work.<ref>{{cite web | title=S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard's Journal Commentary | work=D. Anthony Storm | url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org/journals.htm | accessdate=April 23 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  He wrote over 7000 pages in his journals describing key events, musings, thoughts about his works and everyday remarks.<ref>''Given the importance of the journals, references in the form of ''(Journals, XYZ)'' are referenced from Dru's 1938 Journals. When known, the exact date is given; otherwise, month and year, or just year is given.''</ref>  The entire collection of Danish journals has been edited and published in 13 volumes which consist of 25 separate bindings including indices. The first English edition of the journals was edited by Alexander Dru in 1938.<ref name="Dru" />

His journals reveal many different facets of Kierkegaard and his work and help elucidate many of his ideas. The style in his journals is among the most elegant and poetic of his writings. Kierkegaard took his journals seriously and even once wrote that they were his ''most trusted confidant'':

{{Quotation |I have never confided in anyone. By being an author I have in a sense made the public my confidant. But in respect of my relation to the public I must, once again, make posterity my confidant. The same people who are there to laugh at one cannot very well be made one's confidant.|S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard|Journals<ref name="Dru"/> ([[4 November]] [[1847]])}}

His journals are also the source of many [[aphorism]]s credited to Kierkegaard. The following passage is perhaps the most oft-quoted aphorism from Kierkegaard's journals and is usually a key quote for [[existentialist]] studies:  ''"The thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die."''  It was written on [[August 1]], [[1835]].<ref name="Dru"/>

Although his journals clarify some aspects of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he uses to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. However, Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In 1849, he wrote:

{{Quotation |Only a dead man can dominate the situation in Denmark. Licentiousness, envy, gossip, and mediocrity are everywhere supreme. Were I to die now the effect of my life would be exceptional; much of what I have simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance and have a great effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right.|S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard|Journals<ref name="Dru"/> (December 1849)}}

==Kierkegaard and Christendom==
[[Image:Marmorkirken.jpg|250px|thumb|Kierkegaard mounted an attack on Christian institutions in his final years. He felt the established state church was detrimental to individuals.]]
{{see also|Theology of S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard}}
As mentioned above, Kierkegaard took up a sustained attack on all of [[Christendom]], or Christianity as a political entity, during the final years of his life. In the 19th century, most Danes who were citizens of [[Denmark]] were necessarily members of the [[Church of Denmark|Danish State Church]]. Kierkegaard felt this [[state church|state-church]] union was unacceptable and perverted the true meaning of Christianity.<ref name="Elmer" />  The main points of the attack include:

*''Church congregations are meaningless'': The idea of congregations keeps individuals as children since Christians are disinclined from taking the initiative to take responsibility for their own relation to God. Kierkegaard stresses that "Christianity is the individual, here, the single individual."<ref name="Malik">Kirmmse, Bruce. {{cite web | title=Review of Habib Malik, Receiving S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard | work=Stolaf | url=http://www.stolaf.edu/collections/kierkegaard/newsletter/issue39/39002.htm | accessdate=April 23 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

*''Christendom had become secularized and political'': Since the Church was controlled by the State, Kierkegaard believed the State's bureaucratic mission was to increase membership and oversee the welfare of its members. More members would mean more power for the clergymen: a corrupt ideal. This mission would seem at odds with Christianity's true doctrine, which is to stress the importance of the individual, not the whole.<ref name="Dru" />

*''Christianity becomes an empty religion'':  Thus, the [[state church]] political structure is offensive and detrimental to individuals, since everyone can become "Christian" without knowing what it means to be Christian. It is also detrimental to the religion itself since it reduces Christianity to a mere fashionable tradition adhered to by unbelieving "believers", a "herd mentality" of the population, so to speak.

{{Quotation |If the Church is "free" from the state, it's all good. I can immediately fit in this situation. But if the Church is to be [[political emancipation|emancipated]], then I must ask: By what means, in what way?  A religious movement must be served religiously - otherwise it is a sham!  Consequently, the emancipation must come about through martyrdom - bloody or bloodless. The price of purchase is the spiritual attitude. But those who wish to emancipate the Church by secular and worldly means (i.e. no martyrdom), they've introduced a conception of tolerance entirely consonant with that of the entire world, where tolerance equals indifference, and that is the most terrible offence against Christianity. ... the doctrine of the established Church, its organization, are both very good indeed. Oh, but then our lives: believe me, they are indeed wretched.|S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard|Journals<ref name="Dru"/> (January 1851)}}

Attacking the incompetence and corruption of the Christian churches, Kierkegaard seemed to have anticipated philosophers like [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] who would go on to criticize the Christian religion. 

{{Quotation |I ask: what does it mean when we continue to behave as though all were as it should be, calling ourselves Christians according to the [[New Testament]], when the ideals of the New Testament have gone out of life?  The tremendous disproportion which this state of affairs represents has, moreover, been perceived by many. They like to give it this turn: the human race has outgrown Christianity.|S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard|Journals<ref name="Dru"/> ([[June 19]] [[1852]])}}

==Criticisms of Kierkegaard==
Some of Kierkegaard's famous philosophical critics in the 20th century include [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]]. [[Atheist]]ic philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[agnostic]] philosophers like [[Martin Heidegger]] mostly support Kierkegaard's philosophical views, but criticize and reject his religious views<ref name="Sartrehum">Sartre, Jean-Paul. {{cite web | title=Existentialism is a Humanism | work=World Publishing Company | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm | accessdate=April 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>Dreyfus, Hubert. ''Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I''. MIT Press, 1998. ISBN 0-262-54056-8.</ref>.

Adorno's take on Kierkegaard's philosophy has been less than faithful to the original intentions of Kierkegaard. At least one critic of Adorno considers his book ''Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic'' to be "the most irresponsible book ever written on Kierkegaard" because Adorno takes Kierkegaard's pseudonyms literally, and constructs an entire philosophy of Kierkegaard which makes him seem incoherent and unintelligible. This is like confusing [[William Shakespeare]] with [[Othello]] and [[Dostoevsky]] with [[Raskolnikov]].<ref>Westphal, Merold. ''A Reading of Kierkegaard's Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Purdue University Press 1996, ISBN 1557530904</ref> Another reviewer mentions that "Adorno is [far away] from the more credible translations and interpretations of the Collected Works of Kierkegaard we have today".<ref name="Marcia" />

Levinas' main attack on Kierkegaard is focused on his ethical and religious stages, especially in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''. Levinas criticizes the [[leap of faith]] by saying this suspension of the ethical and leap into the religious is a type of [[violence]].

{{Quotation |Kierkegaardian violence begins when existence is forced to abandon the ethical stage in order to embark on the religious stage, the domain of belief. But belief no longer sought external justification. Even internally, it combined communication and isolation, and hence violence and passion. That is the origin of the relegation of ethical phenomena to secondary status and the contempt of the ethical foundation of being which has led, through Nietzsche, to the amoralism of recent philosophies.|Emmanuel Levinas|Existence and Ethics, (1963)<ref>Lippit, John. ''Kierkegaard and Fear and Trembling'', Routledge 2003, ISBN 0415180473</ref>}}

Levinas points to the fact that it was God who first commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac and that it was an angel who commanded Abraham to stop. If Abraham was truly in the religious realm, he would not have listened to the angel to stop and should have continued to kill Isaac. "Transcending ethics" seems like a loophole to excuse would-be murders from their crime and thus is unacceptable.<ref name="Katz">Katz, Claire Elise. {{cite web | title=The Voice of God and the Face of the Other | work=Penn State University | url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/journals/tr/archive/volume10/Katz.html | accessdate=April 23 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On Kierkegaard's religious views, Sartre offers this argument against [[existence of God]]: If existence precedes essence, it follows from the meaning of the term sentient that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. In ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Sartre's phrasing is that God would be a ''[[Pour soi|pour-soi]]'' [a being-for-itself; a consciousness] who is also an ''en-soi'' [a being-in-itself; a thing]: which is a contradiction in terms. 

Sartre agrees with Kierkegaard's analysis of Abraham undergoing anxiety (Sartre calls it anguish), but Sartre doesn't agree that God told him to do it. In his lecture, ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'', he says:

{{Quotation |The man who lies in self-excuse, by saying "Everyone will not do it" must be ill at ease in his conscience, for the act of lying implies the universal value which it denies. By its very disguise his anguish reveals itself. This is the anguish that Kierkegaard called "the anguish of Abraham." You know the story: An angel commanded [[Abraham]] to sacrifice his son; and obedience was obligatory, if it really was an angel who had appeared and said, "Thou, Abraham, shalt sacrifice thy son." But anyone in such a case would wonder, first, whether it was indeed an angel and secondly, whether I am really Abraham. Where are the proofs? A certain mad woman who suffered from [[hallucination]]s said that people were telephoning to her, and giving her orders. The doctor asked, "But who is it that speaks to you?" She replied: "He says it is God." And what, indeed, could prove to her that it was God? If an angel appears to me, what is the proof that it is an angel; or, if I hear voices, who can prove that they proceed from heaven and not from hell, or from my own subconsciousness or some pathological condition? Who can prove that they are really addressed to me?  |Jean-Paul Sartre|Existentialism is a Humanism<ref name="Sartrehum" />}}

In Kierkegaard's view, Abraham's certainty had its origin in that 'inner voice' which cannot be demonstrated or shown to another ("The problem comes as soon as Abraham wants to be understood"). To Kierkegaard, every external "proof" or justification is merely on the outside and external to the subject.<ref>{{cite web | title=D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on the Postscript | work=D. Anthony Storm | url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org/kw12.htm | accessdate=April 23 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Kierkegaard's proof for the immortality of the soul, for example, is rooted in the extent to which one wishes to live forever.

==Influence and reception==
[[Image:S<U+00F8>ren-Kirkegaard-Statue.jpeg|thumb|The S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard Statue in Copenhagen.]]

Kierkegaard's works were not widely available until several decades after his death. In the years immediately after his death, the Danish State Church, a major institution in Denmark at the time, shunned his work and urged other Danes to do likewise. In addition, the obscurity of the Danish language, relative to [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]], made it nearly impossible for Kierkegaard to acquire non-Danish readers.

The first academic to draw attention to Kierkegaard was his fellow Dane [[Georg Brandes]], who published in German as well as Danish. Brandes gave the first formal lectures on Kierkegaard and helped bring Kierkegaard to the attention of the rest of [[Europe]].<ref name="Brandes">{{cite web | title=Georg Brandes | work=Books and Writers | url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/brandes.htm | accessdate=April 24|accessyear=2006}}</ref> In 1877, Brandes also published the first book on Kierkegaard's philosophy and life. The dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]] became interested in Kierkegaard and introduced his work to the rest of [[Scandinavia]]. While independent German translations of some of Kierkegaard's works began to appear in were the 1870s,<ref>Cappelorn, Niels J. ''Written Images'', Princeton University Press, 2003, ISBN 0691115559</ref> academic German translations of whole portions of Kierkegaard's work had to wait until the 1910s. These translations made it possible for Kierkegaard to begin exerting his enormous influence on 20th-century German, French, and English thinkers and authors. 

In the 1930s, the first academic English translations,<ref>''However, an independent English translation of selections/excerpts of Kierkegaard appeared in 1923 by Lee Hollander, and published by the University of Texas at Austin.''</ref> by [[Alexander Dru]], [[David F. Swenson]], [[Douglas V. Steere]], and [[Walter Lowrie (translator)|Walter Lowrie]] appeared, under the editorial efforts of [[Oxford University Press]] editor [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]].<ref name="CambComp" /> The second and currently widely used academic English translations were published by the [[Princeton University Press]] in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, under the supervision of Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong. A third official translation, under the aegis of the [[S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard Research Center]], will extend to 55 volumes and is expected to be completed sometime after 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title=S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard Forskningscenteret | work=University of Copenhagen | url=http://www.sk.ku.dk/eng.asp | accessdate=August 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Many [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]], both theistic and atheistic, and theologians drew many concepts from Kierkegaard, including the notions of angst, despair, and the importance of the individual. His fame as a philosopher grew tremendously in the 1930s, in large part because the ascendant existentialist movement pointed to him as a precursor, although he is now seen as a highly significant and influential thinker in his own right.<ref>Weston, Michael. ''Kierkegaard and Modern Continental Philosophy''. Routledge, 1994, ISBN 0415101204</ref> Kierkegaard is commemorated as a teacher in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church]] on November 11. 

Philosophers and theologians influenced by Kierkegaard include [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Karl Barth]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Emil Brunner]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Rudolf Bultmann]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Joseph Soloveitchik]], [[Paul Tillich]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]]. [[Paul Feyerabend]]'s scientific anarchism was inspired by Kierkegaard's idea of subjectivity as truth. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was immensely influenced and humbled by Kierkegaard,<ref name="Creegan" /> claiming that "Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow. He bewilders me without working the good effects which he would in deeper souls".<ref name="Creegan" />  [[Karl Popper]] referred to Kierkegaard as "the great reformer of Christian ethics, who exposed the official Christian morality of his day as anti-Christian and anti-humanitarian hypocrisy".<ref>Popper, Sir Karl R. ''The Open Society and Its Enemies Vol 2: Hegel and Marx''. Routledge, 2002, ISBN 0415290635</ref> 

Contemporary philosophers such as [[Emmanuel L<U+00E9>vinas]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[J<U+00FC>rgen Habermas]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and [[Richard Rorty]], although sometimes highly critical, have also adapted some Kierkegaardian insights.<ref name="Postmod">Matustik, Martin Joseph and Merold Westphal (eds). ''Kierkegaard in Post/Modernity'', Indiana University Press, 1995, ISBN 0253209676</ref><ref>MacIntyre, Alasdair. "Once More on Kierkegaard" in ''Kierkegaard after MacIntyre''. Open Court Publishing, 2001, ISBN 081269452X</ref><ref>Rorty, Richard. ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''. Cambridge University Press, 1989, ISBN 0521367816</ref> [[Jerry Fodor]] has written that Kierkegaard was "a master and way out of the league that the rest of us [philosophers] play in".<ref name="Fodor">Fodor, Jerry. {{cite web | title=Water's water everywhere | work=London Review of Books | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n20/fodo01_.html | accessdate=April 23 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Kierkegaard has also had a considerable influence on 20th-century literature. Figures deeply influenced by his work include [[W. H. Auden]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Franz Kafka]],<ref name="Kafka">McGee, Kyle. {{cite web | title=Fear and Trembling in the Penal Colony | work=Kafka Project | url=http://www.kafka.org/index.php?id=185,290,0,0,1,0 | accessdate=April 24|accessyear=2006}}</ref> [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Walker Percy]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and [[John Updike]].<ref name="Updike">Kierkegaard, S<U+00F8>ren with Foreword by John Updike. ''The Seducer's Diary'', Princeton University Press, 1997, ISBN 0691017379</ref>

Kierkegaard also had a profound influence on [[psychology]] and is more or less the founder of [[Christian psychology]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Society for Christian Psychology | work=Christian Psychology | url=http://www.christianpsych.org/ | accessdate=April 24|accessyear=2006}}</ref> and of [[existential psychology]] and [[existential therapy|therapy]].<ref name="Ostenfeld" /> Existentialist (often called "humanistic") psychologists and therapists include [[Ludwig Binswanger]], [[Victor Frankl]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Carl Rogers]], and [[Rollo May]]. May based his ''The Meaning of Anxiety'' on Kierkegaard's ''The Concept of Anxiety''. Kierkegaard's [[sociology|sociological]] work ''Two Ages: The Age of Revolution and the Present Age'' provides an interesting critique of [[modernity]].<ref name="LitRev" /> Kierkegaard is also seen as an important precursor of [[postmodern]]ism.<ref name="Postmod" />

Kierkegaard predicted his posthumous fame, and foresaw that his work would become the subject of intense study and research. In his journals, he wrote: 
{{Quotation |What the age needs is not a genius - it has had geniuses enough, but a martyr, who in order to teach men to obey would himself be obedient unto death. What the age needs is awakening. And therefore someday, not only my writings but my whole life, all the intriguing mystery of the machine will be studied and studied. I never forget how God helps me and it is therefore my last wish that everything may be to his honour|S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard|Journals<ref name="Dru"/> ([[20 November]] [[1847]])}}
