The '''White Shoal Light''' is a [[lighthouse]] located 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) west of the [[Mackinac Bridge]] in [[Lake Michigan]].  It is an active [[aid to navigation]].<ref name="Vol7"/>

==History==
===Overview===
The period between 1852 and the beginning of the 20th century saw great activity on the [[Great Lakes]] by the [[United States Lighthouse Board]].  Between 1852 and 1860 26 new lights were built.  Even as the [[United States Civil War]] and its aftermath slowed construction, a dozen new lights were still lit in that decade. In the 1870s, 43 new lights were built on the Lakes.  The 1880s saw more than one hundred lights constructed.<ref name="Clarke">[http://clarke.cmich.edu/lighthouses/lhhist1.htm ''Beacons in the Night'', Clarke Historical Library.] [[Central Michigan University]].</ref><ref name="Hyde">Hyde, Charles K., and Ann and John Mahan. The Northern Lights: Lighthouses of the Upper Great Lakes. Detroit: [[Wayne State University Press]], 1995. ISBN 0-8143-2554-8 ISBN 978-0-8143-2554-4.</ref>

As the new century began, on the Great Lakes the Lighthouse Board operated 334 major lights, 67 [[fog horn]]s and 563 [[buoys]].<ref name="Clarke"/><ref name="Hyde"/>

During the 19th century design of Great Lakes lights slowly evolved. Until 1870 the most common design was to build a keeper's dwelling with the light on the dwelling's roof or on a relatively small square tower attached to the house. In the 1870s, so as to raise lights to a higher [[focal plane]], conical brick towers, usually between eighty to one hundred feet tall were constructed. In the 1890s [[steel]] lined towers began to replace the older generation of [[brick]] building.<ref name="Clarke"/><ref name="Hyde"/>  ''See'' [[Big Sable Point Light]] for a striking transition and transformation.

The White Shoal Light was the culmination of a forty year effort<U+2014>between 1870 and 1910<U+2014>where engineers began to build lights on isolated [[islands]], [[reefs]], and [[shoals]] that were significant navigational hazards. To that time, [[Light ships]] were the only practical way to mark the hazards, but were dangerous for the sailors who manned them, and difficult to maintain.  "Worse, regardless of the type of anchors used lightships could be blown off their expected location in severe storms, making them a potential liability in the worst weather when captains would depend on the charted location of these lights to measure their own ship's distance from dangerous rocks."<ref name="Clarke"/><ref name="Hyde"/>  ''See'', [[United States lightship Huron (LV-103)]].

Successively, using underwater crib designs, the Board built on a shoal the [[Waugoshance Light]] (1851), and demonstrated a "new level of expertise" in constructing of the [[Spectacle Reef Light]] (1874), [[Stannard Rock Light]] (1882) and [[Detroit River Light|Detroit River (Bar Point Shoal)]] (also known as the Detroit River Entrance Light) (1885). "The long and expensive process of building lights" in remote and difficult sites "ended in nationally publicized engineering projects that constructed" [[Rock of Ages Light|Rock of Ages]] (1908) and the White Shoal (1910) lights.<ref name="Clarke"/><ref name="Hyde"/>

In the first three decades of the twentieth century the Lighthouse Board and the new Lighthouse Service continued to build new lights on the Great Lakes. For 1925, the Board had under its auspices around the Great Lakes: 433 major lights; ten lightships; 129 fog signals; and about 1,000 buoys. Of these 1,771 navigational aids, 160 stations had resident [[lighthouse keeper|keepers]], as most navigational aids were automated.<ref name="Clarke"/><ref name="Hyde"/>  By 1925 nearly all of the Great Lakes lighthouses that today exist<U+2014>excepting ''e.g.'', [[Poe Reef Light]] and [[Gravelly Shoal Light]] and some memorial lights, namely [[Manning Memorial Light]].<ref name="WobserManning">[http://lighthouse.boatnerd.com/gallery/Michigan/manning.htm Wobser, David, Manning Memorial Light], at boatnerd.com</ref><ref name="CentralManning">[http://www.lighthousecentral.com/lighthouse_gallery.php4?lighthouse=Robert%20H.%20Manning%20Memorial%20Light Lighthouse Central,  Photographs, History, Directions and Way points for Robert H.

This is part of a larger pattern of building 14 [[reef]] lights around Michigan, which was intended to help ships navigate through and around the [[shoals]] and hazards around the Straits of Mackinac.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=bBvbpF0utMwC&pg=PA249&lpg=PA249&dq=poe+reef+lighthouse&source=bl&ots=J6RgoCzrnf&sig=7y1a7WiPyZ4q_ja-fDCgAz-L5rE&hl=en&ei=if2ySu_RDYmmMbqltNoO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5#v=onepage&q=poe%20reef%20lighthouse&f=false Roberts, Bruce; Jones, Ray.

===Building the Light===
This crib style light was built in 1912<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clarke.cmich.edu/lighthouses/index.htm |author= Wagner, John L. |title=''Beacons Shining in the Night: The Lighthouses of Michigan (Chronology of Michigan Lighthouses)'' | publisher=Clarke Historical Library, [[Central Michigan University]]}}</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=b6AYAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA372&lpg=PA372&dq=Helical+daymark&source=bl&ots=ZzCtkSHTM9&sig=vAoYncR92R3nlpwKNEJr-cL1lzk&hl=en&ei=RdiMTPKLEMX6nAfDqr3ECw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&sqi=2&ved=0CCUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false New International Yearbook (1913) ''Lighthouses'', pp. 372-373.]</ref> at a cost of $225,000.00.  In addition to a [[fog signal]], it also had a submersible bell that would toll the number "23" to warn off mariners.<ref name = "National Geographic">{{cite journal |last=Putnam |first= George R. |year=1913 |month= January |title= Beacons of the Seas: Lighting the Coasts of the United States |journal=National Geographic Magazine |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |pages=19 |id= |url= http://books.google.com/?id=LNQKAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#PPA19,M1 |accessdate=June 8, 2009 }}</ref>  This early 20th Century technological innovation was an audible precursor to a mid Century innovation using radar, [[RACON]], which was later installed at this location.<ref name="Vol7"/>

Because of growing [[cargo ship|freighter]] traffic in and through the [[Straits of Mackinac]], this light was part of a larger plan to build lighthouses to protect ships and mariners in the area.<ref>*[http://www.lighthousefriends.com/macstraits.html Lighthouses in the Mackinac Straits, Lighthouse Friends.]</ref>  This is one of the first three "lightship stations" of the Great Lakes.  Its construction, along with [[Waugoshance Light]], was a "major engineering feat" because of its distance and isolation from land.<ref>[http://www.michiganlighthouse.org/Lighthouses/lighthouse_detail.php117.htm Michigan Lighthouse Project, White Shoal Light.]</ref>  Until 1910, Lightship ''LV56'' served at White Shoal. Construction for this light began in 1908: the [[crib pier]] being built in [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]], and transported by ship.<ref>[http://www.lighthousecentral.com/lighthouse_gallery.php4?lighthouse=White%20Shoal%20Light Roach, Jerry, Lighthouse Central, Photographs, History, Directions and Way points for White Shoal Light, ''The Ultimate Guide to West Michigan Lighthouses'' (Publisher: Bugs Publishing LLC - 2005).] ISBN 0-9747977-0-7.</ref>  The [[lighthouse keeper|keeper]] house was accompanied by a [[fog signal]] building that housed a [[diaphone]], that has since been removed.<ref name="NPS"/>

==Description==
The tower was coated in [[gunnite]] after completion.<ref>[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/michigan/whiteshoal/whiteshoal07.htm Historic U.S. Coast Guard photo of White Shoal Lighthouse at Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light.]</ref>

The lighthouse is unique:
# The massive original lens was a 2nd Order [[Fresnel Lens]] manufactured by Barbier, Benard & Turenne of Paris.  It had a "two-sided design known as a bi-valve configuration, with each side "featuring 7 refracting and 15 reflecting prisms."   The lens floated on a bed of [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] and was powered by a [[clockwork]] mechanism suspended in the tower.  It had a range of up to {{convert|28|mi|km}} and generated 1.2 million candle power.<ref>[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/michigan/whiteshoal/whiteshoal.htm Terry Pepper, ''Seeing The Light'', White Shoal Light.]</ref>  Similar lights were installed at [[Grosse Point Light]] (the only remaining 2nd Order Fresnel still in operation on the Great Lakes) and [[Rock of Ages Light]].<ref>[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/illumination/fresnel/2order.htm Second Order Fresnel lens, Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light.]</ref>  It was automated in 1976.<ref name="NPS"/>  The original lens is on display at the [[Whitefish Point Light]] Museum.<ref name="Rowlett">{{cite rowlett|miwl}}</ref><ref name="Friends">[http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=210 Anderson, Kraig, Lighthouse friends, White Shoal Light].</ref>

==Seeing the light==
A private boat is the best way to see this light close up.  Short of that, Shepler's Ferry Service out of [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]] offers periodic lighthouse cruises in the summer season.<ref name="Friends"/>  Its "westbound Lighthouse Tour" <U+2014> three hours more or less <U+2014> includes passes by various lights, including White Shoal Light, [[Waugoshance Light]] (which it replaced), [[Wilderness State Park]], [[Gray's Reef Light]] (originally built in 1891), and [[St. Helena Island Light]].  A so-called grand lighthouse excursion is a yearly event sponsored through the Great Lakes Lightkeeper Association, and includes these and many other lights.  Schedules and rates are available from Shepler's.<ref>[http://www.sheplersferry.com/lighthouses/lighthouses.html  Shepler's Ferry Service].</ref>

Another alternative is to charter a [[seaplane]] to make a tour of the Mackinac Straits and environs.<ref>[http://www.mightymac.org/seatour.htm Stoke, Keith, ''A seaplane tour of the Straits''].</ref>
