The 20 '''Bristol and Exeter Railway 4-2-2 locomotives''' were [[broad gauge]] [[4-2-2]] express steam locomotives built for the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] by the [[Avonside Engine Company|Stothert and Slaughter]] in [[Bristol]]. The first entered service in 1849. The Bristol and Exeter Railway was [[Consolidation (business)|amalgamated]] into the [[Great Western Railway]] on 1 January 1876 and eight 4-2-2s survived at this time, the last being withdrawn in 1889.

Three of the infamous [[4-2-4 (locomotive)|4-2-4T]] locomotives were rebuilt by the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1877 as 4-2-2 tender locomotives.
