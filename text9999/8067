The [[typhoon]] formed on June&nbsp;28, 2002, near the FSM, and for several days it meandered while producing heavy rainfall across the region. On Chuuk, the highest 24-hour precipitation total was 506&nbsp;mm (19.9&nbsp;in), which was greater than the average monthly total. The rain produced floods up to {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, causing deadly landslides across the island that killed 47&nbsp;people. There was also one death on nearby [[Pohnpei]], and damage in the FSM totaled over $100&nbsp;million.{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 2002 [[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group="nb"}}

After affecting the FSM, Chataan began a northwest track as an intensifying typhoon. Its [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] passed just north of [[Guam]] on July&nbsp;4, though the eyewall moved across the island and dropped heavy rainfall. Totals were highest in southern Guam, peaking at 536&nbsp;mm (21.1&nbsp;in). Flooding and landslides from the storm severely damaged or destroyed 1,994&nbsp;houses. Damage on the island totaled $60.5&nbsp;million, and there were 23&nbsp;injuries. The typhoon also affected [[Rota (island)|Rota]] in the [[Northern Marianas Islands]] with gusty winds and light rainfall. Typhoon Chataan attained its peak intensity of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph) on July&nbsp;8. It weakened while turning to the north, and after diminishing to a tropical storm Chataan struck eastern Japan on July&nbsp;10. High rainfall, peaking at {{convert|509|mm|in|abbr=on}}, flooded 10,270&nbsp;houses. Damage in Japan totaled about $500&nbsp;million.

The name Chataan means "rainy day" in the [[Chamorro language]], which is spoken on Guam.<ref name="reut74"/> The [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) named the storm Gloria while the typhoon was in the vicinity of the country.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Xinhua|date=2002-07-09|publisher=ReliefWeb|title=Typhoon death toll rises to 27 in Philippines|accessdate=2012-06-28|url=http://reliefweb.int/node/104869}}</ref>

After affecting Guam, Chataan continued toward the northwest and gradually intensified. At 0000&nbsp;UTC on July&nbsp;8, the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph <small>10-minute sustained</small>) while located near the Japanese island of [[Okinotorishima]].<ref name="jma"/> The JTWC assessed that Chataan had reached its peak intensity of 240&nbsp;km/h (150&nbsp;mph <small>1-minute sustained</small>) about six hours earlier; on that basis, the agency classified the system as a [[tropical cyclone scales|super typhoon]]. On July&nbsp;8, Chataan turned toward the north around the subtropical ridge while maintaining its peak winds for about 18&nbsp;hours.<ref name="atcr"/> On July&nbsp;9 the typhoon turned to the northeast, and late that day it weakened to a severe tropical storm. At around 1530&nbsp;UTC on July&nbsp;10, Chataan made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[B<U+014D>s<U+014D> Peninsula]] in [[Honshu]] with winds of about 100&nbsp;km/h (65&nbsp;mph <small>10-minute sustained</small>).

==Preparations and impact==
===Federated States of Micronesia===
While Chataan was in its formative stages and still tied to the monsoon trough, it produced a large area of heavy rainfall and strong winds that affected Pohnpei and Chuuk in the FSM. The storm passed very near Chuuk with wind gusts of 82&nbsp;km/h (51&nbsp;mph). In the day before Chataan affected the island, it dropped torrential rainfall due to its elongated structure and slow movement. Persistent winds from the larger monsoon trough generated high surf and tides of 0.3&nbsp;m (1&nbsp;ft) above normal across the region. The most significant effects were from the rainfall, peaking at 954&nbsp;mm (37.5&nbsp;in) at the Chuuk Weather Service Office over 13&nbsp;days. The highest 24-hour total was 506&nbsp;mm (19.9&nbsp;in) on Weno Island, of which 361&nbsp;mm (14.2&nbsp;in) fell in 12&nbsp;hours;<ref name="prelim"/> this was greater than the average monthly rainfall total for the station.<ref name="ifrc74"/>

High winds downed power lines on Chuuk,<ref name="ncdc"/> while surf destroyed seawalls and buildings along the coast.<ref name="fsm73">{{cite report|author=FSM Information Service|publisher=ReliefWeb|date=2002-07-03|title=Tropical Storm Chataan wreaks havoc in FSM|accessdate=2012-06-27|url=http://reliefweb.int/node/105071}}</ref> The rains causes severe flooding across the island that reached {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in some locations,<ref name="ifrc74b"/> triggering at least 30&nbsp;mudslides that killed 47&nbsp;people.

===Guam===
[[File:Chataan Guam.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Effects of Typhoon Chataan, including torrential rains and strong winds, on Guam]]

The highest sustained winds were estimated at 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph), with gusts to 167&nbsp;km/h (104&nbsp;mph) at [[Andersen Air Force Base]]. Gusts were slightly higher at [[Apra Harbor]], peaking at 170&nbsp;km/h (106&nbsp;mph), and gusts may have reached as high as 200&nbsp;km/h (125&nbsp;mph). Similar to its effects on Chuuk, Chataan dropped heavy rainfall on Guam,<ref name="prelim"/> peaking at 536&nbsp;mm (21.1&nbsp;in) on Mount Almagosa; the same station reported 311&nbsp;mm (12.2&nbsp;in) in about three hours.<ref name="usgs">{{cite report|author=Richard A.

High winds caused damage across Guam, mostly to roofs and to poorly built or wooden structures.<ref name="prelim"/> A total of 1,996&nbsp;houses were severely damaged or destroyed.<ref name="ncdc"/> Better constructed homes fared well during the storm, and there was little window damage. The winds also downed power lines,<ref name="prelim"/> leaving an island-wide power outage. [[John F. Kennedy High School (Guam)|John F.

The storm flooding contaminated [[Fena Lake]], which provides water to the military base, for a few days.<ref name="prelim"/><ref name="usgs"/> In addition, 34 of the island's 110&nbsp;water wells failed due to the storm. Flooding also destroyed a building and damaged the runway at [[Antonio B.

Some of the downed trees struck cars, but the winds were not strong enough to overturn any vehicles. In the higher elevations of Guam, some areas experienced heavy crop damage due to strong winds; however, crop damage in general was less than expected,<ref name="prelim"/> estimated at around $500,000. In [[Apra Harbor]], high seas washed ashore or sank five boats, and a [[United States Navy|Navy]] barge spilled 397,000&nbsp;litres (105,000&nbsp;gallons) of oil. Overall, Chataan caused about $60&nbsp;million in property damage on Guam, and there were 23&nbsp;injuries, none of them serious.<ref name="ncdc"/>
