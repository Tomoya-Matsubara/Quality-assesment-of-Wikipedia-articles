The '''Daarul Uloom Deoband''' ({{lang-hi|<U+0926><U+093E><U+0930><U+0941><U+0932> <U+0909><U+0932><U+0942><U+092E> <U+0926><U+0947><U+0935><U+092C><U+0928><U+094D><U+0926>}}, {{lang-ur|<U+062F><U+0627><U+0631><U+0627><U+0644><U+0639><U+0644><U+0648><U+0645> <U+062F><U+06CC><U+0648><U+0628><U+0646><U+062F>}}) is an [[Darul Uloom|Islamic school]]  in India and is where the [[Deobandi Islamic movement]] was started. It is located at [[Deoband]], a town in Saharanpur district of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. It was founded in 1866 by several prominent Islamic scholars ([[Ulama]]), headed by Maulaana [[Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi]]. The other prominent founding scholars were [[Rashid Ahmad Gangohi|Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi)]] and Haaji Saiyyid 'Aabid Husaiyn. The institution is highly respected across the [[India]], as well as in other parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. 

A large group of scholars at the Daarul Uloom Deoband had opposed the establishment of a state established along sectarian lines, particularly the demands of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] for the [[Partition of India|Partition]] of [[British Raj|British India]] into Muslim and non-Muslim sections.<ref>ISLAAMIC PAKISTAN: ILLUSIONS & REALITY, by 'Abdus-Sattaar Ghazzaali.</ref><ref>A History of Pakistan and Its Origins By Christophe Jaffrelot, Gillian Beaumont, page: 224, ISBN 1-84331-149-6.</ref> It has been suggested that the real reason for their opposition to Partition was their desire to Islaamize all of India.<ref>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-barelvi.htm</ref> Maulaana [[Husain Ahmed Madani]] was one of the scholars who opposed the idea of Pakistan. He was also Shaiykhul-Hadees (Chief of [[Hadith]] department) of Daarul Uloom Deoband and led the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind]], an organization of the 'Ulamaa, that saw nothing Islaamic in the idea of Pakistan. He said: "All should endeavour jointly for such a democratic government in which Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and Parsis are included. Such a freedom is in accordance with Islam." The school advocates an orthodox version of Islaam and has repeatedly distanced itself from religious extremism.

==Background==
[[image:Deoband.jpg|thumb|300px|left]]
{{Deobandi}}
In 1857, the British [[East India Company]] put down with a heavy hand the independence movement begun by disparate north Indian forces, conducted in the name of the otherwise powerless [[Bahadur Shah II|Bahaadur Shaah Zafar Gurakani]]. Emperor Zafar became the last Mughal Emperor, for he was deposed the following year and exiled to Burma, with many of his sons put to death. This marked a seminal moment for Indo-Islaamic consciousness, specifically for the established Muslim elites of north India, who tended to view the defeat of 1857 as the end of their political pre-eminence and the beginning of what could be a dark period of Muslim history in India.

In this situation, a group of learned theologians, led by Maulaana [[Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi]], established the Daarul Uloom Seminary in the town of Deoband, in order to preserve Indo-Islaamic culture and train the youth in Islaamic knowledge. The foundation of Daarul Uloom Deoband was laid down in 1283 A.H. (21 May 1866 A.D.) beneath a pomegranate tree.   Naanautawi claimed he had been inspired to do so by a dream in which the [[Prophets of Islam|Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] spoke to him.<ref>Knowledge - An odyssey - The Historic Journey http://www.inter-islam.org/Pastevents/Jknowledge.html</ref> The pedagogical philosophy of Deoband was focused on teaching revealed Islaamic sciences, known as Manqoolaat, to the Indian Muslim population, according to the [[Hanafi]] tradition. In this seminary, Naanautawi instituted modern methods of learning: Teaching in classrooms, a fixed and carefully selected curriculum, lectures by different faculties recognised as leaders in their fields, exam periods, merit prizes, a publishing press and so on. The faculty instructed its students primarily in [[Urdu]], the [[lingua franca]] of the urbanised section of the region, and supplemented it with study of [[Arabic]] (for theological reasons) and [[Persian language|Persian]] (for cultural and literary reasons).   In due course, it also unwittingly cemented the growing association of the Urdu language with the north Indian Muslim community. The founders consciously decided to divorce the seminary from political or governmental participation. Instead, it was to run as an autonomous institution, supported by voluntary financial contributions from the Muslims at large. 

Its over 15,000 graduates have gone on to found many similar Madaaris (schools) across [[South Asia]] and further afield; the followers of this school of theology are often described as followers of the [[Deobandi]] school of thought.

==Pattern of education==
Deoband's curriculum is based on the 17th-century Indo-Islaamic syllabus known as [[Dars-i-Nizami]]. The core curriculum teaches Islaamic law (''[[sharee'ah]]''), Islaamic  jurisprudence (''[[Fiqh]]''), traditional Islaamic spirituality (''[[Tasawwuf]]'', which is the focus of [[Sufism]]), as well as several other fields of Islaamic study.<ref>[http://darululoom-deoband.com/english/sys_of_edu/index.htm The System Of Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Mawlaana [[Ashraf Ali Thanwi|Ashraf 'Ali Thaanwi]], Sharee'at and Tasawwuf pg. 11, 112, 113</ref> 

The current syllabus  consists of four stages. The first three stages can be completed in a total of eight years. The final stage is a post-graduate stage where students specialize in a number of advanced topics, such as the [[Hadith studies|sciences]] of [[Hadith]], [[Fiqh]] and so on.

==Impact of the Deoband School==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Masjid Rasheed Deoband.jpg|thumb|right|Masjid Rasheed Deoband]] -->
Many Islaamic schools throughout modern [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]] - and more recently in [[Afghanistan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[South Africa]] - as well as in hundreds of other places throughout the world are affiliated, or theologically linked, to Daarul Uloom Deoband. Famous seminaries have been established by its graduates, e.g. [[Darul-uloom Nadwatul Ulama|Nadwatul 'Ulamaa]] in [[Lucknow]], [[Madrasah In'aamiyyah]] <ref>[http://www.alinaam.org.za/Madrasah In'aamiyyah] Madrasah In'aamiyyah</ref> Camperdown, near [[Durban]] in [[South Africa]], and three important seminaries in Pakistan, viz. [[Darul 'Uloom Karachi]], [[Jamiah|Jaami'ah]] Ashrafiyah [[Lahore]],<ref>http://www.ashrafia.org.pk/index.html</ref> and Jaami'ah Ziyaaul-Qur'aan (Al-Ma'roof Baagh-Waali Masjid), [[Faisalabad]]. As the official website of the Daarul Uloom proclaims in flowery language, 'the whole of Asia is redolent with the aroma of this Prophetic garden.'

==India's Independence Movement==
In the meeting of the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind]] at [[Calcutta]], in 1926, the participants included graduates of Daarul Uloom, Deoband and they supported the group which called for complete independence of India from the [[British India|British]] rule. [[Indian National Congress]] was to declare complete independence as its goal three years later, in its session at [[Lahore]].

The famous freedom fighter [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], who visited Daarul Uloom during his visit to India in 1969, had said<ref>http://www.darululoom-deoband.com Official website of Darul Uloom Deoband</ref>: "I have had relation with Daarul Uloom since the time the Shaiykhul-Hind, [[Maulana Mehmud Hasan]], was alive. Sitting here, we used to make plans for the independence movement, as to how we might drive away the English from this country and how we could make India free from the yoke of slavery of the [[British Raj]]. This institution has made great efforts for the freedom of this country".

==Recent developments==
The Daarul Uloom has expanded its activities and started new departments during the last decades. In view of great challenge from the [[Ahmadiyyah|Ahmadiyyah Movement]] (Qaadiyaanism), Daarul Uloom convened the All India Tahaffuz Khatm-e-Nubuwwat Conference and established a special department to refute Qaadiyaanism. It started the 'Shaiykhul Hind Academy' for publishing books, and training students in Urdu journalism. In 1996, the Computer Department was opened, which was later extended and an Internet Department also added. The Daarul Uloom has also introduced a two-year full-time Diploma in English language and literature for students wishing to pursue higher education in universities.

==Condemnation of terrorism==

The conference also denounced widespread attempts to blame religious Muslims for terrorist incidents.<ref>''Muslim clerics declare terror "un-Islaamic"'' [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Muslim_clerics_declare_terror_un-Islaamic/articleshow/2813375.cms ''Times of India'' Feb. 25, 2008]</ref>
