'''Interstate 75''' ('''I-75''') is a part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] that runs from [[Miami, Florida]], to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]]. I-75 enters [[Michigan]] from [[Ohio]] in the south, north of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and runs generally northward through [[Detroit]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] and [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], crosses the [[Mackinac Bridge]], and ends at the [[Canada|Canadian]] border in Sault Ste. Marie. The freeway runs for approximately {{convert|396|mi|km}} on both of Michigan's peninsulas. The landscapes traversed by I-75 include [[Southern Michigan]] farmland, northern forests, suburban bedroom communities, and the urban core of Detroit. The freeway also uses three of the state's monumental bridges to cross major bodies of water. There are four [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary Interstates]] in the state related to I-75, as well as nine current or former [[Business routes of Interstate 75 in Michigan|business routes]], with either Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) or Business Spur I-75 (BS I-75) designations.

The freeway bears several names in addition to the I-75 designation. The southern segment was called the '''Detroit<U+2013>Toledo Expressway''' during planning in the 1950s and 1960s. Through Detroit, I-75 is the '''Fisher Freeway''' or the '''Walter P. Chrysler Freeway''', named for pioneers in the auto industry. Sections on either side of the Mackinac Bridge are the '''G. Mennen Williams Freeway''' or the '''Prentiss M. Brown Freeway''', named for politicians who helped get the bridge built. Officially, the entire length is the '''American Legion Memorial Highway''', after the [[American Legion|organization of the same name]]. Various sections carry components of the four [[Great Lakes Circle Tour]]s in the state.

Several [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trails spanned the state along the general path of the modern freeway. After statehood, several of these were converted into [[plank road]]s that later became some of the first state highways. In the 1920s, five of these were added to the [[United States Numbered Highway System]]: [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US Highway&nbsp;2]] (US&nbsp;2), [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]], [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US&nbsp;24]], [[U.S. Route 25 in Michigan|US&nbsp;25]], and [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US&nbsp;27]]. In the 1950s, a '''Michigan Turnpike''' was proposed as a [[toll road|tolled]], [[controlled-access highway]] in the Lower Peninsula. After passage of the [[Federal Highway Act of 1956]], this turnpike proposal was shelved as a free Interstate Highway was planned. Construction started in 1957, signs went up in 1959, and I-75 was completed in 1973. Since completion, the freeway has been upgraded with the construction of the [[Zilwaukee Bridge]] near Saginaw and improved connections to the [[Ambassador Bridge]] in Detroit.

Crossing the state line north of [[Toledo, Ohio]], I-75 enters Michigan in [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe County]] carrying the [[Lake Erie Circle Tour]] (LECT) near the North Maumee Bay of [[Lake Erie]]. The freeway runs parallel to the shoreline of the Great Lake and past the community of [[Luna Pier, Michigan|Luna Pier]]. Further north, I-75 passes to the southeast of [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]] and crosses the [[River Raisin]] between the city and the river mouth. North of the river, the freeway turns further inland running through farmland. Near [[Newport, Michigan|Newport]], [[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]] splits off to the northwest and I-75 continues its northeasterly trek through Monroe County. When it crosses the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]], the trunkline enters [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] between [[South Rockwood, Michigan|South Rockwood]] and [[Rockwood, Michigan|Rockwood]].<ref name=MDOT12>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= State Transportation Map |year= 2012 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km (main map); 1&nbsp;in:2.5&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;cm:1.75&nbsp;km (inset) |at= Section B11<U+2013>G11, G11<U+2013>M14, M14<U+2013>N13, main map; section B8<U+2013>E11, E11<U+2013>H9, Detroit Area inset }}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |title= Overview Map of I-75 in Michigan |url= https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=I-75+N&daddr=42.41798,-83.08751+to:Sault+Ste+Marie+International+Bridge&hl=en&sll=46.496915,-84.358006&sspn=0.056958,0.058279&geocode=FbTHfAIdLBAG-w%3BFTw_hwIdai8M-ylN2vRw_M0kiDFiEnNGSZxgpQ%3BFaypxQId-sH4-g&oq=Sault&mra=ls&via=1&t=h&z=7 |accessdate= October 27, 2012}}</ref>

On the north side of the county line, I-75 begins to run inland of, and parallel to, the [[Detroit River]], entering the [[Downriver]] area. The freeway turns northerly after the interchange with [[M-85 (Michigan highway)|M-85]] (Fort Street) near [[Gibraltar, Michigan|Gibraltar]], and the LECT departs I-75 to follow M-85 north of the interchange. The landscape transitions to suburban residential areas instead of farmland through this area. The freeway turns back northeasterly in [[Taylor, Michigan|Taylor]] and intersects the southern end of [[M-39 (Michigan highway)|M-39]] (Southfield Highway) in [[Lincoln Park, Michigan|Lincoln Park]]. I-75 crosses the [[Ecorse River]] and passes through an industrial area of Metro Detroit. Further north, the freeway spans the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]] in the southern part of Detroit.<ref name= MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

I-75 parallels to M-85 (Fort Street) and follows the Detroit River as far east as the [[Ambassador Bridge]]. Near the bridge's approaches, the freeway turns 90<U+00B0> away from the river and intersects the eastern end of [[Interstate 96|I-96]] before turning again to follow the river further inland. From there, I-75 meets [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]] (Lodge Freeway) and crosses under [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|M-1]] (Woodward Avenue). East of Woodward, the freeway travels past both [[Comerica Park]] and [[Ford Field]], homes of the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Detroit Lions]] professional sports teams, respectively.<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

===Detroit to the Tri-Cities===
[[File:I-75 Chrysler Freeway looking south.jpg|thumb|Looking south along the Chrysler Freeway to the Detroit skyline|alt=Photograph]]
Immediately east of Ford Field, I-75 turns northwesterly to follow the Chrysler Freeway away from the downtown Detroit area. The transition from the Fisher Freeway involves a set of one-lane ramps through the interchange with the connections to [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|Interstate 375]] and [[M-3 (Michigan highway)|M-3]] (Gratiot Avenue). Heading north-northwesterly, I-75 passes to the east of the campus of [[Wayne State University]] and through an interchange with [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] (Edsel Ford Freeway). The Chrysler Freeway passes to the west of [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] and to the east of [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]], [[enclave]]s within Detroit. I-75 meets M-8 (Davison Freeway) and continues through residential areas of Detroit's northern side. North of [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|M-102]] (8&nbsp;Mile Road), the freeway crosses out of Detroit and into [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]]. The Chrysler Freeway jogs through the suburb of [[Hazel Park, Michigan|Hazel Park]],<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/> site of the "worst freeway for accidents in Metro Detroit" at a curve near 9&nbsp;Mile Road.<ref name=oosting>{{cite news |first= Jonathan |last= Oosting |date= December 5, 2010 |title= Worst Freeway for Accidents in Metro Detroit?

Further north, I-75 intersects [[Interstate 696|I-696]] near 10&nbsp;Mile Road. The freeway continues northward for about {{convert/spell|6|mi|km}} into [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], where it turns westward. The route for I-75 zig-zags through Troy and [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] as the freeway alternates from north<U+2013>south to east<U+2013>west to bypass [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. Near the [[M-59 (Michigan highway)|M-59]] interchange, I-75 passes the headquarters for [[Chrysler]]. Further north, by the [[M-24 (Michigan highway)|M-24]] interchange, it runs near [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], home of the [[Detroit Pistons]]. The freeway traverses through additional suburban residential areas as it runs northwesterly away from Pontiac. These subdivisions end north of [[Clarkston, Michigan|Clarkston]], which is the location of the northern terminus for [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US&nbsp;24]]. Continuing through [[Holly, Michigan|Holly]] and [[Newark, Oakland County, Michigan|Newark]], the freeway transitions back to a rural, wooded setting.<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

As I-75 approaches [[Grand Blanc, Michigan|Grand Blanc]], the landscape changes back to suburbs. [[Interstate 475 (Michigan)|I-475]] (UAW Freeway) splits off to the north to bypass the east side of [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], and I-75 merges with [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]]. The combined I-75/US&nbsp;23 turns northerly to round the west side of the city. I-75/US&nbsp;23 meets [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] near the [[Bishop International Airport]] southwest of downtown Flint. The freeway continues northward along the western residential neighborhoods, encountering the northern end of I-475 near [[Mount Morris, Michigan|Mount Morris]]. I-75 passes to the west of [[Clio, Michigan|Clio]] and the east of [[Birch Run, Michigan|Birch Run]], the latter home to a large outlet mall. From there, the trunkline travels through farmland in southern [[Saginaw County, Michigan|Saginaw County]].<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

===Central Michigan===

I-75/US&nbsp;23 enters the southern reaches of the suburban [[Tri-Cities (Michigan)|Tri-Cities]] at [[Bridgeport, Michigan|Bridgeport]] and proceeds northward through the area. The freeway passes to the east of downtown [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]]. [[Interstate 675 (Michigan)|I-675]] splits off to run westward into downtown, and I-75 curves around to the northwest to cross the [[Saginaw River]] on the [[Zilwaukee Bridge]] in the suburb of [[Zilwaukee, Michigan|Zilwaukee]]. North of the river, I-675 reconnects to I-75, which continues northward into [[Bay County, Michigan|Bay County]]. The freeway passes to the west of [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], encountering the eastern end of the [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]] freeway. From there, I-75/US&nbsp;23 curves northwesterly to bypass Kawkawlin before continuing north to the [[Standish, Michigan|Standish]] area through farmlands inland from the [[Saginaw Bay]]. West of Standish, US&nbsp;23 splits to follow the [[Lake Huron]] shoreline, and I-75 turns northwesterly to run inland.<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

West of [[Sterling, Michigan|Sterling]], the landscape changes again; in this area the freeway enters forest lands. I-75 continues northwestward through [[Arenac County, Michigan|Arenac County]] and crosses into western [[Ogemaw County, Michigan|Ogemaw County]]. [[M-30 (Michigan highway)|M-30]] passes under the freeway without an interchange as I-75 rounds the west side of [[West Branch, Michigan|West Branch]]. On the northwest side of that city, [[M-55 (Michigan highway)|M-55]] merges onto I-75, and the two highways turn to run concurrently westward into [[Roscommon County, Michigan|Roscommon County]]. East of [[Prudenville, Michigan|Prudenville]], M-55 splits from the freeway. I-75 turns northward to curve around the east of [[Houghton Lake (Michigan)|Houghton]] and [[Higgins Lake|Higgins]] lakes. Turning back to the northwest, the trunkline bypasses [[Roscommon, Michigan|Roscommon]] to the south and transfers into southern [[Crawford County, Michigan|Crawford County]]. About {{convert/spell|5|mi|km}} north of the county line, I-75 meets the northern end of [[U.S. Route 127 in Michigan|US&nbsp;127]],<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/> the former [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US&nbsp;27]].<ref name=ranzenberger>{{cite news |url= http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:MPMB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=12050B7ED0067678&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0B0A2F7372D54C748F8A8C4C17175B68 |title= US&nbsp;127 Signs Getting Updated |first= Mark |last= Ranzenberger |work= [[Morning Sun (Mount Pleasant)|The Morning Sun]] |location= Mount Pleasant, MI |accessdate= August 23, 2012 |date= April 27, 2008 |pages= 1A, 6A |oclc= 22378715}}</ref>

===Northern Michigan===
[[File:I-75 MI exit 254.jpg|thumb|Exit&nbsp;254 south of Grayling|alt=Photograph of]]
After the US&nbsp;127 interchange, I-75 turns northward, and passes to the east of [[Grayling, Michigan|Grayling]]. There are a pair of interchanges on either end of town for [[Interstate 75 Business (Grayling, Michigan)|BL I-75]], and the southern one is a [[partial interchange]]; only northbound I-75 traffic may access the business loop and traffic entering the freeway may only access southbound I-75. There is no interchange further north for [[M-72 (Michigan highway)|M-72]]; access to that highway is provided through the business loop. On the north side of Grayling, there is a full interchange for BL I-75/[[M-93 (Michigan highway)|M-93]] that provides the southbound I-75 connection to M-72 as well as access from both directions to the [[Hartwick Pines State Park]].<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

Crossing into southern [[Otsego County, Michigan|Otsego County]], I-75 continues northward through [[Northern Michigan]] forests. It passes to the east of the community of [[Waters, Michigan|Waters]] and [[Otsego Lake (Michigan)|Otsego Lake]]. North of exit&nbsp;279, I-75 proceeds by the [[Gaylord Regional Airport]] and crosses the [[45th parallel north|45th Parallel]], the halfway mark between the [[Equator]] and the [[North Pole]] by latitude. The freeway then traverses the west side of [[Gaylord, Michigan|Gaylord]] and continues through forests in the northern sections of the county. North of [[Vanderbilt, Michigan|Vanderbilt]], I-75 enters southern [[Cheboygan County, Michigan|Cheboygan County]],<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/> assuming the G. Mennen Williams Freeway name.<ref name=barnett88/>

I-75 continues northward through Cheboygan County, passing the community of [[Indian River, Michigan|Indian River]] and spanning the [[Indian River (Mullett Lake)|river of the same name]]. North of town, the freeway traverses the area between [[Burt Lake|Burt]] and [[Mullett Lake|Mullett]] lakes before intersecting the southern end of [[M-27 (Michigan highway)|M-27]]; that highway provides access to [[Topinabee, Michigan|Topinabee]] and [[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]]. I-75 continues northward through tree farms and other agricultural properties in rural Cheboygan County. Cheboygan is accessible by way of interchanges for [[C-64 (Michigan county highway)|C-64]] and [[C-66 (Michigan county highway)|C-66]], a pair of [[List of County-Designated Highways in Michigan|county-designated highways]] in this area. North of C-66, I-75 turns northwesterly. The freeway meets the northern end of [[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US&nbsp;31]] and picks up the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]] (LMCT) designation before entering [[Emmet County, Michigan|Emmet County]] on the south side of [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]]. I-75 then parallels the county line on the west side of the village, meeting the northern end of US&nbsp;23. After that interchange, the [[Lake Huron Circle Tour]] (LHCT) merges in from the south. There is one more interchange along the freeway before I-75 ascends the approaches to the [[Mackinac Bridge]].<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

===Mackinac Bridge===
The Mackinac Bridge carries I-75 across the [[Straits of Mackinac]] that separate Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form the connection between Lakes [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]] and Huron.<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/> The structure, unlike the rest of the state highways in Michigan like I-75, is under the maintenance and control of the [[Mackinac Bridge Authority]] (MBA).{{#tag:ref|The MBA is an independent state agency responsible for the Mackinac Bridge and thus maintains that section of the overall highway system.

North of the Mackinac Bridge, I-75 passes to the west of downtown [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]], traveling between the [[Father Marquette National Memorial]] and the [[Straits State Park]]. There is an interchange north of the toll plaza that marks the eastern end of [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US&nbsp;2]] in the state. The LMCT departs I-75 to follow US&nbsp;2 while the LHCT follows [[Interstate 75 Business (St. Ignace, Michigan)|BL I-75]] through town. The freeway curves around the [[Mackinac County Airport]] and meets the northern end of the business loop near [[Castle Rock (Michigan)|Castle Rock]]; the LHCT returns to I-75 at that interchange as well.

==History==

===Indian trails to state highways===
[[File:Michigan's Indian trails.png|thumb|upright|Map of the pre-statehood Indian trails|alt=Black and white map]]
Before Michigan became a state, the first land transportation corridors were the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trails.<ref name=morrison1>[[#Morrison|Morrison]], p.&nbsp;1.</ref> The [[French-Indian Trail]] ran through southeastern Michigan between [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], Monroe and Detroit. The [[Saginaw Trail]] ran north from Detroit to the Saginaw area where it connected with the original [[Mackinaw Trail]] that ran roughly parallel to, and west of, the modern I-75. Another path, the Cheboygan Trail, ran parallel to the modern freeway to the east between the West Branch area and Cheboygan. In the UP, an extension of the Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie.<ref name=mason18>[[#Mason|Mason]], p.&nbsp;18.</ref> In the 19th century, the [[Michigan Legislature]] chartered private companies to build and operate [[plank road]]s or turnpikes in the state, many of which replaced the original Indian trails. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well.<ref name=morrison7-8>[[#Morrison|Morrison]], pp.&nbsp;7<U+2013>8.</ref> By the first decade of the 20th century, only 23 of the 202&nbsp;chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century.<ref name= mason4>[[#Mason|Mason]], p.&nbsp;4.</ref>

The [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|State Trunkline Highway System]] was formed on May 13, 1913, and several sections of the system were designated along the course of the then-future I-75. Division&nbsp;1 connected the Ohio state line northeasterly to Detroit, and Division&nbsp;2 connected Detroit with Mackinaw City. A branch of Division&nbsp;7 ran north from St. Ignace to Sault Ste. Marie.<ref name=STLHA>[[#MichLeg|Michigan Legislature]], p.&nbsp;1868</ref> The system was signposted in 1919,<ref name=press-1919-09-20>{{cite news |title=Michigan May Do Well Following Wisconsin's Road Marking System |work= The Grand Rapids Press |date= September&nbsp;20, 1919 |page= 10 |oclc= 9975013}}</ref> and those highways were marked on maps for the first time. The first [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]] was designated along the highways from Ohio through Detroit to Standish.<ref group=lower-alpha>Northeast of Standish, M-10 ran along the Lake Huron shoreline.</ref> [[M-76 (Michigan highway)|M-76]] connected Standish with Grayling, where the first [[M-14 (Michigan highway)|M-14]] ran northward to Cheboygan.

From the state line northward, M-10 was included as a part of [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US&nbsp;24]] and [[U.S. Route 25 in Michigan|US&nbsp;25]]. At Detroit, M-10 was used as a part of [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]]. North of Grayling, M-14 was redesignated as a part of [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US&nbsp;27]]. M-12 was used for [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US&nbsp;2]].<ref name=USH>{{cite map |publisher= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title= United States System of Highways |cartography= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |url= http://www.okladot.state.ok.us/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/misc-maps/1926us.pdf |date= November&nbsp;11, 1926 |accessdate= May 10, 2008 |format= PDF |oclc= 32889555}}</ref>

The southernmost section from the state line north to the Detroit area is the Detroit<U+2013>Toledo Expressway.<ref name=WCRCreport>{{cite report |author= Board of Wayne County Road Commissioners |authorlink=Wayne County Road Commission |year= 1960 |title= Route Location Study: FAI&nbsp;75: Detroit<U+2013>Toledo Expressway to Rouge River |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |oclc= 23314996}}</ref> The segment through southern and central Detroit is known as the Fisher Freeway. It was dedicated on September 17, 1970, to the Fisher Brothers, who founded [[Fisher Body]], later a part of [[General Motors]].<ref name=barnett81-2>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp.&nbsp;81<U+2013>2.</ref> After the curve in downtown Detroit, I-75 follows the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway northward. That segment is named for [[Walter P. Chrysler]], founder of [[Chrysler]]. The name was chosen by the Detroit Common Council on November 6, 1957, and codified in state law in 1990; the state definition for the name places the northern end of the designation at the Oakland<U+2013>Genesee county line.<ref name=barnett233>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p.&nbsp;233.</ref>

Officially, the entire length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a practical matter, this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate. The [[American Legion]] was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the signage. Public Act&nbsp;174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands.<ref name=barnett22-3>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp.&nbsp;22<U+2013>3.</ref> Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution&nbsp;216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976.<ref>{{cite web |first= J. |last= Hunault |date= January 8, 2002 |title= Public Act 142 of 2001: Second Analysis |url= http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2001-2002/billanalysis/House/htm/2001-HLA-4878-B.htm |location= Lansing |publisher= House Fiscal Agency |accessdate= August 18, 2013}}</ref> The designation was formally repealed in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |author= [[Michigan Legislature]] |date= October 26, 2001 |title= Memorial Highways Act (Public Act 142 of 2001) |url= http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(t5evgs55wwcpy52x4vc1jt3k))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-250-1100|work= [[Michigan Compiled Laws]] |at= Section 250.1100 |accessdate= August 18, 2013}}</ref>

Two other segments near the Straits of Mackinac were named in 1976 for figures instrumental in the construction of the Mackinac Bridge. From the Cheboygan<U+2013>Otsego county line north to the bridge, I-75 was named for [[G. Mennen Williams]], the former governor once called "Michigan's Politician of the Century" in the press.<ref name=barnett88>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p.&nbsp;88.</ref> The section in Mackinac County from the northern end of the Mackinac Bridge was named for [[Prentiss M.

Along its route in the state, I-75 utilizes three of Michigan's monumental bridges. The first of them is the Zilwaukee Bridge near Saginaw. The original bridge across the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built in 1960 as a [[bascule bridge]] to allow shipping traffic to use the river. Opening the drawbridge would back traffic up on I-75/US&nbsp;10/US&nbsp;23 for upwards of four hours on holiday weekends.<ref name=hyde166>[[#Hyde|Hyde]], p.&nbsp;166.</ref> Approved in 1974, construction on the replacement bridge started in October 1979. A major construction accident in August 1982 delayed completion of the new Zilwaukee Bridge; a bridge pier partially collapsed when contractors overloaded a section under construction. The affected {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} deck segment tilted to rest {{convert/spell|3|ft|m}} higher on one end and {{convert/spell|5|ft|m}} lower on the other.<ref name=hyde168>[[#Hyde|Hyde]], p.&nbsp;168.</ref> The structure was originally supposed to cost $76.8&nbsp;million with a 1983 completion date; in the end it cost $131.3&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|131300000|1983|r=-4}}}} in 2010{{Inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}}) when the southbound span finally opened on September 19, 1988.<ref name=blade88>{{cite news |author=Staff Writer |date=September 19, 1988 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C3BRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zw0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3349,13274&dq=zilwaukee+bridge&hl=en |title=Zilwaukee Bridge Now Open North, South<U+2014>Partly |work= The Blade |location= Toledo, OH |page=1 |oclc= 12962717 |accessdate= October 29, 2012}}</ref> The structure is the largest concrete segmental bridge in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title= A Brief History of Paving |work= The Grand Rapids Press| page= A8 |oclc= 9975013}}</ref>

The second is the Mackinac Bridge that connects Michigan's two peninsulas at the Straits of Mackinac. A structure was first proposed in 1888 by one of the directors of the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]] on [[Mackinac Island]]. Car ferry service was started in 1923 to cross the straits, and a bridge authority was first created in 1934 to investigate the possibility of building a permanent connection across the straits. This early authority started with a 1921 proposal for a series of bridges that would have connected [[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]] to [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]] by way of [[Bois Blanc Island (Michigan)|Bois Blanc]], [[Round Island (Michigan)|Round]], and Mackinac islands. The federal [[Public Works Administration]] rejected loan and grant requests for that project. A second, direct crossing was then proposed based on designs used for the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]]. The collapse of that bridge and World War II delayed any further work on a structure beyond tests of the lake bottom and the construction of the {{convert|4200|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} causeway on the St. Ignace side; the first bridge authority was abolished in 1947.<ref name=hyde159>[[#Hyde|Hyde]], pp.&nbsp;159<U+2013>66.</ref> The current agency was created on June 6, 1950.<ref name=Rubin13>[[#Rubin|Rubin]], pp.&nbsp;13<U+2013>7.</ref>

The MBA was authorized in 1952 to sell bonds to finance construction,<ref name=hyde159/> which were sold on December 17, 1953, to finance the $99.8&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|99800000|1953|r=-5}}}} in 2010{{Inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}}) cost of the bridge.<ref name=rubin103>[[#Rubin|Rubin]], pp.&nbsp;103<U+2013>7.</ref> The structure was designed by [[David B. Steinman]] and built by [[Merritt-Chapman & Scott]] for the substructure and the [[American Bridge Company]] division of [[U.S. Steel Corporation]] for the superstructure. Construction started in 1954 and the Mackinac Bridge opened to traffic on November 1, 1957. Final work on the bridge was completed in September 1958. Overall, the structure has a {{convert|3800|ft|m|adj=on}} central suspension span flanked by two {{convert|1800|ft|m|adj=on}} side spans. With the two backstay spans, the Mackinac Bridge is {{convert|8614|ft|m}} long between cable anchorages, the longest in the world at the time it opened.{{#tag:ref|The [[Akashi Kaiky<U+014D> Bridge|Akashi Kaiky<U+014D>]] and [[Great Belt Bridge|Great Belt]] bridges in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] are each longer between anchorages at {{convert|12826|ft|m}} and {{convert|8,921|ft|m}} respectively,<ref>{{cite news |title= Bridge Facts |work= [[Monroe Evening News|The Monroe Evening News]] |date= September 2, 2007 |page= 1E |oclc= 35981181}}</ref> but the Mackinac is still the longest between anchorages in the [[Western Hemisphere]],<ref>{{cite news |first= Susan R. |last= Pollack |date= May 23, 2007 |title= The Mighty Mac Is Turning 50!: Head North This Summer for Big Doings around Mackinaw and the Upper Peninsula |work= The Detroit News |page= 3E |issn= 1055-2715 }}</ref> and crosses a wider body of water.|group=lower-alpha}} The total length of the structure is {{convert|26444|ft|m}} with two {{Convert|555|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} towers and {{convert|155|ft|m}} of clearance for passing ships under the main span.<ref name=hyde159/> In 2000, the bridge was named "Michigan's No. 1 Civil Engineering Project of the 20th Century" in 2000 by the Michigan Section of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE), and the structure was named a [[National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]] in 2010 by the national ASCE.<ref>{{cite news |first= Doris |last= Parker|title= Celebrating the Soo Locks, Mackinac Bridge |work= [[Cheboygan Daily Tribune]] |agency= Associated Press |date= June 23, 2012 |page= A2 |issn= 0746-665X}}</ref>
