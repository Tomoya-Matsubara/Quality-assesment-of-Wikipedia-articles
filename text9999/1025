'''State Route 310''' ('''SR&nbsp;310''') is a north-south [[state highway]] located in the [[southwest Georgia|southwestern part]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==Route description==
SR&nbsp;310 begins at an [[intersection (road)|intersection]] with [[Georgia State Route 253|SR&nbsp;253]] east of [[Reynoldsville, Georgia|Reynoldsville]]. The route heads due north to the town of [[Brinson, Georgia|Brinson]]. There, it intersects [[U.S. Route 84 in Georgia|US&nbsp;84]]/[[Georgia State Route 38|SR&nbsp;38]]. After Brinson, the route curves northeast, and then northwest, to meet its northern terminus, an intersection with [[U.S. Route 27 in Georgia|US&nbsp;27]]/[[Georgia State Route 1|SR&nbsp;1]] in [[Colquitt, Georgia|Colquitt]]. The roadway continues as [[Georgia State Route 45 Connector|SR&nbsp;45 Connector]] (South 1st Street).<ref name="Google"/>

==History==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=January 2013}}
{{Cleanup|date=January 2013|reason=poorly-written and unsourced}}
Considering that, only a year after the highway was commissioned, the [[Miller County, Georgia|Miller County]] section of the highway was decommissioned, leaving the Brinson section of SR&nbsp;310 as a double spur in [[Decatur County, Georgia|Decatur County]], ending at the Miller County line to the north and [[Lake Seminole]] to the south with the other section of the highway across the lake. In 1965, a new route was constructed in Miller County, extending from the SR&nbsp;310 stub end north to Colquitt. However, oddly enough, this road did not become part of SR&nbsp;310 for more than two decades to come. In fact, the extension to Colquitt was not completed until the early 1990s. Perhaps the consideration of decommissioning the highway was so strong that no action was taken for all that time.

When the Miller County section was commissioned, SR&nbsp;310 was at maximum length, extending nearly {{convert|33|mi|km}}. This all changed, however, in 1995. That year, the {{convert|5.8|mi|km|adj=on}} dead end '''Yates Spring Road''' section south of SR&nbsp;253 to Lake Seminole was decommissioned and the {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=on}} portion of the highway on the other side of the lake was changed to [[Georgia State Route 97 Spur|SR&nbsp;97 Spur]].

The northern terminus of the highway was relocated within Colquitt to Grow Street instead of connecting to US&nbsp;27 in downtown. That portion is now SR&nbsp;45 Connector.
