'''Platinum''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|p|l|<U+00E6>|t|i-|n|<U+0259>|m}} or {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|p|l|<U+00E6>|t|<U+0259>n|<U+0259>|m}}) is a [[chemical element]] with the [[chemical symbol]] '''Pt''' and an [[atomic number]] of 78.

Its name is derived from the Spanish term ''platina'', which is literally translated into "little silver".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/464081/platinum-Pt "platinum (Pt)."] Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online.

Even though it has six naturally occurring [[isotopes]], platinum is one of the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|rarest elements in the Earth's crust]] and has an average abundance of approximately 5&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/kg. It is the [[Reactivity series|least reactive metal]]. It occurs in some [[nickel]] and [[copper]] ores along with some native deposits, mostly in [[South Africa]], which accounts for 80% of the world production.

As a member of the [[platinum group]] of elements, as well as of the [[group 10 element|group 10]] of the [[periodic table of elements]], platinum is generally non-reactive. It exhibits a remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and as such is considered a [[noble metal]]. As a result, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the [[alluvium|alluvial sands]] of various rivers, it was first used by [[pre-Columbian]] South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, but it was not until [[Antonio de Ulloa]] published a report on a new metal of [[Colombia]]n origin in 1748 that it became investigated by scientists.

Platinum is used in [[catalytic converter]]s, laboratory equipment, [[electric]]al contacts and [[electrode]]s, [[platinum resistance thermometer]]s, [[dentistry]] equipment, and jewelry. Because only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, it is a scarce material, and is highly valuable and is a major [[List of traded commodities#Precious metals|precious metal commodity]]. Being a [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]], it leads to health issues upon exposure to its salts, but due to its corrosion resistance, it is not as toxic as some metals.<ref>{{citeweb |url= http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/123081/AQG2ndEd_6_11Platinum.PDF|title= Platinum|}}</ref> Its compounds, most notably [[cisplatin]], are applied in [[chemotherapy]] against certain types of cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |  pmid = 20593091 |  year = 2010 |  last1 = Wheate |  first1 = NJ |  last2 = Walker |  first2 = S |  last3 = Craig |  first3 = GE |  last4 = Oun |  first4 = R |  title = The status of platinum anticancer drugs in the clinic and in clinical trials |  volume = 39 |  issue = 35 |  pages = 8113<U+2013>27 |  doi = 10.1039/C0DT00292E |  journal = Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)}}</ref>

Platinum's resistance to wear and tarnish is well suited for making fine [[jewelry]]. The metal has an excellent resistance to [[corrosion]] and high temperature and has stable electrical properties. All of these characteristics have been used for industrial applications.<ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=KXwgAZJBWb0C&pg=RA1-PT8|chapter = Platinum|pages = 8<U+2013>9|isbn = 978-0-87170-518-1|title = Handbook of corrosion data|author1 = Craig, Bruce D|author2 = Anderson, David S|author3 = International, A.S.M.|date = 1995-01}}</ref>

===Chemical===
{{see also|Platinum group}}
[[File:Platin loest sich in heissem Koenigswasser.JPG|left|thumb|Platinum dissolves in hot ''[[aqua regia]]'']]
The most common [[oxidation state]]s of platinum are +2 and +4. The +1 and +3 oxidation states are less common, and are often stabilized by metal bonding in bimetallic (or polymetallic) species. As is expected, tetracoordinate platinum(II) compounds tend to adopt 16-electron [[square planar]] geometries. While elemental platinum is generally unreactive, it dissolves in hot ''aqua regia'' to give soluble [[hexachloroplatinic acid]] ("H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>", formally (H<sub>3</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub><U+00B7>''n''H<sub>2</sub>O ):<ref name="Kauuf"/>

As a [[HSAB theory|soft acid]], platinum has a great affinity for sulfur, such as on [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO); numerous DMSO complexes have been reported and care should be taken in the choice of reaction solvent.<ref name = han>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/om700543p|title = Mono- vs Bis(carbene) Complexes: A Detailed Study on Platinum(II)<U+2212>Benzimidazolin-2-ylidenes|year = 2007|first1 = Y. |last1 = Han |first2= H.

==Isotopes==
{{main|Isotopes of platinum}}
Platinum has six naturally occurring [[isotopes]]: <sup>190</sup>Pt, <sup>192</sup>Pt, <sup>194</sup>Pt, <sup>195</sup>Pt, <sup>196</sup>Pt, and <sup>198</sup>Pt. The most [[isotopic abundance|abundant]] of these is <sup>195</sup>Pt, comprising 33.83% of all platinum. It is the only stable isotope with a non-zero spin; with a spin of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, <sup>195</sup>Pt satellite peaks are often observed in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopy (i.e. Pt-phosphine and Pt-alkyl complexes). <sup>190</sup>Pt is the least abundant at only 0.01%. Of the naturally occurring isotopes, only <sup>190</sup>Pt is unstable, though it decays with a half-life of 6.5{{e|11}}&nbsp;years. <sup>198</sup>Pt can undergo [[alpha decay]], but its decay had never been observed (the [[half-life]] is known to be longer than 3.2{{e|14}}&nbsp;years), therefore it is considered stable. Platinum also has 31 synthetic isotopes ranging in atomic mass from 166 to 202, making the total number of known isotopes 37. The least stable of these is <sup>166</sup>Pt with a half-life of 300&nbsp;<U+00B5>s, while the most stable is <sup>193</sup>Pt with a half-life of 50&nbsp;years. Most platinum isotopes decay by some combination of [[beta decay]] and alpha decay. <sup>188</sup>Pt, <sup>191</sup>Pt, and <sup>193</sup>Pt decay primarily by [[electron capture]]. <sup>190</sup>Pt and <sup>198</sup>Pt have [[double beta decay]] paths.<ref name="nubase">{{cite journal| last = Audi| first = G.|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3<U+2013>128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.H.}}</ref>

Platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and [[alloy]]ed with [[iridium]] as platiniridium.

The alluvial deposits used by [[pre-Columbian]] people in the [[Choc<U+00F3> Department]], [[Colombia]] are still a source for platinum group metals. Another large alluvial deposit is in the [[Ural Mountains]], Russia, and it is still mined.<ref name="CRC"/>

In [[nickel]] and [[copper]] deposits, platinum group metals occur as [[sulfide]]s (e.g., (Pt,Pd)S), [[telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]] (e.g., PtBiTe), [[antimonide]]s (PdSb), and [[arsenide]]s (e.g., PtAs<sub>2</sub>), and as end alloys with nickel or copper. Platinum arsenide, [[sperrylite]] (PtAs<sub>2</sub>), is a major source of platinum associated with nickel ores in the [[Sudbury Basin]] deposit in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. At [[Platinum, Alaska]], about 545,000 [[troy ounce]]s had been mined between 1927 and 1975. The mine ceased operations in 1990.<ref>{{cite web

===Halides===
Hexachloroplatinic acid mentioned above is probably the most important platinum compound, as it serves as the precursor for many other platinum compounds.

==History==
Platinum occurs naturally in the [[alluvium|alluvial sands]] of various rivers, though there is little evidence of its use by ancient people. However, the metal was used by [[pre-Columbian]] Americans near modern-day [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador]] to produce artifacts of a white gold-platinum alloy. The first European reference to platinum appears in 1557 in the writings of the [[Italy|Italian]] humanist [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] as a description of an unknown noble metal found between [[Dari<U+00E9>n Province|Dari<U+00E9>n]] and Mexico, "which no fire nor any Spanish artifice has yet been able to liquefy."<ref name="weeks">{{cite book| title = Discovery of the Elements|pages = 385<U+2013>407|author = Weeks, M.

Other chemists across Europe soon began studying platinum, including [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]]<ref>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=GWNQAAAAcAAJ | title = Versuche mit dem neuen mineralischen K<U+00F6>rper Platina del pinto genannt | author1 = Marggraf | first1 = Andreas Sigismund | year = 1760}}</ref> [[Torbern Bergman]], [[J<U+00F6>ns Jakob Berzelius]],<!--http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=pmr-v23-i4-155-156&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CFoQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.platinummetalsreview.com%2Fpdf%2Fpmr-v23-i4-155-156.pdf&ei=FxWTT_6YOoOLswaKy7XeBA&usg=AFQjCNFn8__okV3fK4xcNSg1bQ-Nm_NZHg--> [[William Lewis (scientist)|William Lewis]],<!--http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=platina+William+Lewis&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CC4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.platinummetalsreview.com%2Fpdf%2Fpmr-v7-i2-066-069.pdf&ei=hhWTT4-YNozLsgb14LGLBA&usg=AFQjCNHCECiLbEjXypnkLTujKyMs47FANQ--> and [[Pierre Macquer]]. In 1752, [[Henrik Teofilus Scheffer|Henrik Scheffer]] published a detailed scientific description of the metal, which he referred to as "white gold", including an account of how he succeeded in fusing platinum ore with the aid of [[arsenic]]. Scheffer described platinum as being less pliable than gold, but with similar resistance to corrosion.<ref name="weeks"/>

Carl von Sickingen researched platinum extensively in 1772. He succeeded in making [[malleable]] platinum by [[alloy]]ing it with gold, dissolving the alloy in hot ''aqua regia'', precipitating the platinum with [[ammonium chloride]], igniting the ammonium chloroplatinate, and hammering the resulting finely divided platinum to make it cohere. [[Franz Karl Achard]] made the first platinum crucible in 1784. He worked with the platinum by fusing it with arsenic, then later [[volatilisation|volatilizing]] the arsenic.<ref name="weeks"/>

Since the other platinum family members were not discovered yet (platinum was the first in the list), Scheffer and Sickingen made the false assumption that due to its hardness <U+2013> which is slightly more than for pure [[iron]] <U+2013> platinum was a relatively non pliable material, even brittle at times, when in fact its ductility and malleability are close to that of gold. Their assumptions could not be avoided since the platinum they experimented with was highly contaminated with minute amounts of the platinum family elements such as [[Osmium]] and [[Iridium]] amongst others, which embrittled the platinum alloy.
Alloying this impure platinum residue called "plyoxen" with gold was the only solution at the time to obtain a pliable compound, but nowadays, very pure platinum is available and extremely long wire can be drawn from pure platinum, very easily, due to its crystalline structure which is similar to that of many soft metals.<ref>[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/platinum.htm mysite.du.edu](bibliography is included in the link)</ref>

In 1786, [[Charles III of Spain]] provided a library and laboratory to [[Pierre-Fran<U+00E7>ois Chabaneau]] to aid in his research of platinum. Chabaneau succeeded in removing various impurities from the ore, including gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron. This led him to believe he was working with a single metal, but in truth the ore still contained the yet-undiscovered platinum group metals. This led to inconsistent results in his experiments. At times, the platinum seemed malleable, but when it was alloyed with iridium, it would be much more [[brittle]]. Sometimes the metal was entirely incombustible, but when alloyed with osmium, it would volatilize. After several months, Chabaneau succeeded in producing 23&nbsp;kilograms of pure, malleable platinum by hammering and compressing the sponge form while white-hot. Chabeneau realized the infusibility of platinum would lend value to objects made of it, and so started a business with Joaqu<U+00ED>n Cabezas producing platinum ingots and utensils. This started what is known as the "platinum age" in Spain.<ref name="weeks"/>

In 2007, [[Gerhard Ertl]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for determining the detailed molecular mechanisms of the catalytic oxidation of [[carbon monoxide]] over platinum ([[catalytic converter]]).<ref>{{cite journal |pages = 385<U+2013>407|doi = 10.1002/anie.200800480 |title = Reactions at Surfaces: From Atoms to Complexity (Nobel Lecture) |pmid = 18357601 |issue = 19 |year = 2008 |last1 = Ertl |first1 = Gerhard |journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume = 47}}</ref>

Platinum, along with the rest of the [[Platinum group|platinum metals]], is obtained commercially as a by-product from [[nickel]] and [[copper]] mining and processing. During [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|electrorefining of copper]], noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals as well as [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] settle to the bottom of the cell as "anode mud", which forms the starting point for the extraction of the platinum group metals.<ref name="usgs2008-summary">{{cite journal |author=George, M.

If pure platinum is found in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is also nonmagnetic, while nickel and iron are both magnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, while other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in either of the two acids and recovering the remaining platinum.<ref name="heiserman">{{cite book|title=Exploring Chemical Elements and their Compounds|last = Heiserman |first= David L.|pages = 272<U+2013>274|publisher = TAB Books|isbn = 0-8306-3018-X|year = 1992}}</ref>

One suitable method for purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, and the other platinum group metals, is to process it with ''aqua regia'', in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, while osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated by the addition of [[iron(III) chloride]] and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as [[Ammonium hexachloroplatinate|ammonium chloroplatinate]] by the addition of [[ammonium chloride]]. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to the metal by heating.<ref>{{cite journal|first1 = L. B.|last1 = Hunt|last2 = Lever |first2= F.

==Applications==
[[File:Aufgeschnittener Metall Katalysator f<U+00FC>r ein Auto.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a [[Catalytic converter|metal-core catalytic converter]]]]
Of the 239&nbsp;tonnes of platinum sold in 2006, 130&nbsp;tonnes were used for [[vehicle emissions control]] devices, 49&nbsp;tonnes for jewelry, 13.3&nbsp;tonnes in electronics, and 11.2&nbsp;tonnes in the chemical industry as a catalyst. The remaining 35.5&nbsp;tonnes went to various other minor applications, such as electrodes, anticancer drugs, [[oxygen sensor]]s, [[spark plug]]s and turbine engines.<ref name="USGS-Y-06">{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/platinum/myb1-2006-plati.pdf |

===Catalysis===
The most common use of platinum is as a [[catalyst]] in chemical reactions, many times as [[platinum black]]. It has been employed in this application since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a [[catalytic converter]], which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst in a number of separate processes, but especially in [[catalytic reforming]] of straight run [[Petroleum naphtha|naphtha]]s into higher-octane gasoline which becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO<sub>2</sub>, also known as [[Adams' catalyst]], is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for [[vegetable oil]]s.<ref name="krebs"/> Platinum metal also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of [[hydrogen peroxide]] into [[water]] and oxygen gas.<ref>{{cite book|title=General Chemistry: Principles & Modern Applications|author = Petrucci, Ralph H.|edition=9th|page = 606|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2007|isbn=0-13-149330-2}}</ref>

===Standard===
[[File:Platinum-Iridium meter bar.jpg|thumb|right|International Prototype Meter bar]]
From 1889 to 1960, the [[metre|meter]] was defined as the length of a platinum-iridium (90:10) alloy bar, known as the [[International Prototype Meter]] bar. The previous bar was made of platinum in 1799. The [[International Prototype Kilogram]] remains defined by a cylinder of the same platinum-iridium alloy made in 1879.<ref name="meter">{{cite book|doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-00738-5_4|chapter = Chapter 4.

===Precious metal===
[[File:2005 AEPlat Proof Obv.png|thumb|left|100px|Platinum Eagle]]

{{main|Platinum as an investment|Platinum coin}}
Platinum is a [[precious metal]] [[commodity]]; its [[bullion]] has the [[ISO currency code]] of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewelry, usually as a 90<U+2013>95% alloy, due to its inertness and shine. Jewelry trade publications advise jewelers to present minute surface scratches (which they term [[patina]]) as a desirable feature.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.professionaljeweler.com/archives/articles/2004/aug04/0804fys.html|title=Professional Jeweler's Magazine Archives, issue of August 2004 | accessdate = June 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.diamondcuttersintl.com/a-platinum-primer|title = Platinum primer|publisher = Diamond Cutters International|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref>

In [[watchmaking]], [[Vacheron Constantin]], [[Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex]], [[Breitling SA|Breitling]], and other companies use platinum for producing their limited edition watch series. Watchmakers appreciate the unique properties of platinum, as it neither tarnishes nor wears out (relative to gold).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://watches.infoniac.com/index.php?page=post&id=44|title = Unknown Facts about Platinum|publisher = watches.infoniac.com|accessdate = 2008-09-09}}</ref>

[[File:platinum prices 91-07.JPG|thumb|right|Average price of platinum from 1991 to 2007 in US$ per [[troy ounce]] (~$20/g)<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lppm.org.uk/statistics.aspx|title = Fixing Statistics|publisher = The London Platinum and Palladium Market|accessdate = 2010-06-13}}</ref>]]

The price of platinum, like other industrial commodities, is more volatile than that of gold. In 2008, the price of platinum dropped from $2,252 to $774 per oz,<ref name="Kitco Pt 2008 prices">{{cite web |title = One Year Platinum |publisher=Kitco |url=http://www.kitco.com/LFgif/pt2008.gif |accessdate=2011-06-28}}</ref> a loss of nearly 2/3 of its value. By contrast, the price of gold dropped from ~$1,000 to ~$700/oz during the same time frame, a loss of only 1/3 of its value.

During periods of sustained economic stability and growth, the price of platinum tends to be as much as twice the price of gold, whereas during periods of economic uncertainty,<ref name="TheSpeculativeInvestor">{{cite web|title = Platinum versus Gold|publisher=The Speculative Invertor|url = http://www.speculative-investor.com/new/article150402.html}}</ref> the price of platinum tends to decrease due to reduced industrial demand, falling below the price of gold. Gold prices are more stable in slow economic times, as gold is considered a safe haven and gold demand is not driven by industrial uses. In the 18th century, platinum's rarity made King [[Louis XV of France]] declare it the only metal fit for a king.<ref name="mineralszone">{{cite web |title=Platinum |publisher=Minerals Zone |url=http://www.mineralszone.com/minerals/platinum.html |accessdate=2008-09-09}}</ref>

===Other uses===
In the laboratory, platinum wire is used for electrodes; platinum pans and supports are used in [[thermogravimetric analysis]] because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000&nbsp;<U+00B0>C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent [[magnet]]s.<ref name="krebs"/> Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.<ref name="CRC"/>

Platinum's rarity as a metal has caused advertisers to associate it with exclusivity and wealth. "Platinum" debit cards have greater privileges than do "[[gold]]" ones.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Gwin|first1 = John|title = Pricing Financial Institution Products|journal = Journal of Professional Services Marketing|volume = 1|page = 91|year = 1986|doi = 10.1300/J090v01n03_07|issue = 3}}</ref> "[[RIAA certification|Platinum awards]]" are the second highest possible, ranking above "gold", "[[silver]]" and "[[bronze]]", but below [[diamond]].

Platinum is considered a precious metal, although its use is not as common as the use of gold or silver. The frame of the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth|Crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]], manufactured for her coronation as Consort of [[King George VI]], is made of platinum. It was the first British crown to be made of this particular metal.<ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=SImTll3uupIC&pg=PA312|title = The Signs and Symbols Bible: The Definitive Guide to Mysterious Markings|isbn = 978-1-4027-7004-3|author1 = Gauding, Madonna|date = 2009-10-06}}</ref>

==Health issues==
According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], short-term exposure to platinum salts may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and long-term exposure may cause both respiratory and skin allergies. The current [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standard is 2&nbsp;micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an 8-hour work shift.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0520.pdf |format=PDF |title=Occupational Health Guideline for Soluble Platinum Salts (as Platinum) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2008-09-09}}</ref>

As platinum is a [[catalyst]] in the manufacture of the [[silicone rubber]] and gel components of several types of [[implant (medicine)|medical implants]] (breast implants, joint replacement prosthetics, artificial lumbar discs, vascular access ports, etc.), the possibility platinum could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study.
