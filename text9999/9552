The '''Tammar Wallaby''' (''Macropus eugenii''), also known as the '''Dama Wallaby''' or '''Darma Wallaby''', is a small member of the [[kangaroo]] family and is the model species for research on kangaroos and [[marsupial]]s. It is found on offshore islands on the South [[Australia]]n and Western Australian coast. It persists in large numbers on [[Kangaroo Island]], where it [[seasonal breeder|seasonally breeds]] in large numbers and can become a problem to farmers through competition for pasture and grain crops. High densities of these animals also have impact on the density of low vegetation across the Island. The Tammar Wallaby was seen on [[West Wallabi Island]] in the [[Houtman Abrolhos]] off [[Western Australia]] by survivors of the 1628 ''[[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]]'' [[shipwreck]], and recorded by [[Francisco Pelsart]] in his 1629 ''Ongeluckige Voyagie''. This represents the first recorded sighting of a [[Macropodidae|macropod]] by Europeans,<ref name="Pearson 2005">{{cite journal | first = Michael | last = Pearson | year = 2005 | title = Great Southern Land: The maritime exploration of Terra Australis | publisher = Department of the Environment and Heritage, Government of Australia | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/pubs/great-southern-land.pdf | accessdate = 2007-12-21 | isbn = 0642551855 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929132830/http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/pubs/great-southern-land.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}</ref> and probably also the first sighting of an Australian mammal.<ref name="Storr 1965">{{cite journal | first = Glen | last = Storr | year = 1965 | title = The physiography, vegetation and vertebrate fauna of the Wallabi Group, Houtman Abrolhos | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 1<U+2013>14}}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
The tammar wallaby was first described by French naturalist [[Anselme Ga<U+00EB>tan Desmarest]] in 1817. It specific name comes from Eugene Hamelin, Commander of the ship ''Naturaliste''.<ref name=Tyndale2005/>{{rp|333}} Its common name is derived from the thickets of the local shrub ''[[Allocasuarina campestris]]'' that it sheltered in in Western Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=12&ved=0CB0QFjABOAo&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dec.wa.gov.au%2Fcomponent%2Foption%2Ccom_docman%2Ftask%2Cdoc_download%2Fgid%2C133%2FItemid%2C%2F&rct=j&q=Dama%20Tammar&ei=UfgdTtCSD6T3mAXZ54HKBw&usg=AFQjCNH4o4__i6_dVDy6tiVo8epzjv3U9g&sig2=w-CVnWK69RMlIKOKeBK3yw|title=Tammar Wallaby ''Macropus eugenii'' (Desmarest, 1817)|work=Department of Environment and Conservation|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> It is classified along with the kangaroos and larger wallabies in the genus ''[[Macropus]]''. Within this, it is placed in the subgenus ''Notomacropus'' along with several species of wallaby, all members of which have a facial stripe.<ref name="dawson85">{{cite journal|last=Dawson, Lyndall; Flannery, Tim|date=1985|title=Taxonomic and Phylogenetic Status of Living and Fossil Kangaroos and Wallabies of the Genus Macropus Shaw (Macropodidae: Marsupialia), with a New Subgeneric Name for the Larger Wallabies|journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|volume=33|issue=4|pages=473-98 }}</ref>

The tammar wallabies on [[Flinders Island]] were described as having a greyer coat and thinner head than the tammars on Kangaroo Island<ref>Jones FW. 1924. ''Mammals of South Australia '', Government Printer, Adelaide. (1968 reprint)</ref> and were given a separate name, while East and West Wallabi Islands are smaller than the Kangaroo Island tammars. Other early naturalists suspected that all island populations composed one species.<ref>Gould J. 1973. ''Kangaroos ''. New edition of ''The Mammals of Australia'', Vol 2, first published in 1863.

Macmillan Australia, Melbourne.</ref> A more recent study has compared tammar wallaby skulls in museums around the world with skulls from extant populations on the Abrolhos Islands, Garden Island, Middle Island and Kangaroo Island as well as those from New Zealand and found that there were three distinct groups; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island, a second ground composed of population form Flinders Island and mainland Southern Australia in the 19th century as well as populations from New Zealand and a third group composed of the Kangaroo Island population.<ref>Poole WE, Wood JT, Simms NG, 1991.

===Subspecies===
As such, three subspecies of tammar wallaby are currently recognised:<ref name=WADEC/>
* ''M. e. derbianus'' (Western Australia and nearby islands)
* ''M. e. decres'' ([[Kangaroo Island]], South Australia)
* ''M. e. eugenii'' (Extinct in South Australia and Flinders Island but introduced to New Zealand).

===Evolution===
Fossil evidence exists from the late Pleistocene, with remains found in the Naracoorte Caves.<ref name="dawson85"/> Island tammar wallabies have been isolated from those on the mainland for 15,000-7,000 years, since the end of the last Ice Age and each population shows genetic differences from each other.<ref name=Tyndale2005/>{{rp|332}} It is likely that tammars originated in South Australia and spread to Western Australia and evolved tolerance of [[sodium fluoroacetate]]. The lethal dose for mainland Western tammars was >5 mg/kg, while the lethal dose for tammar on East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island is <2 mg/kg.<ref name=Oliver1979> Oliver AJ,  King DR. 1979. "Fluoroacetate Tolerance, a Genetic Marker in Some Australian Mammals". ''Australian Journal of Zoology'' 27 (3) 363 <U+2013> 372. [http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/ZO9790363.htm doi:10.1071/ZO9790363]</ref> Plant species that have sodium fluoroacetate do not occur on the islands and thus tammar must have retained their tolerance since their islolation 11,500-7000 years ago.<ref name=Tyndale2005/>{{rp|334}}   By contrast tammars from the eastern part of their range are highly susceptible to 1080 posion with the lethal dose for tammars on Kangaroo Island being <0.2 mg/kg. <ref name=Oliver1979/> Between the Garden Island and Kangaroo Island populations, at two ends of the species<U+2019> continuum, there are also differences in serum proteins, iron-building transferrin protein and red cell antigens.<ref name=Tyndale2005/>{{rp|333}}

The tammar wallaby is the smallest wallaby species. It has a small head and large ears; the tail is long and thick at the base.<ref name=diversity/> It is dark, grizzled grey-brown above, becomes [[rufous]] on the sides of the body and the limbs, especially in males are pale grey-buff below.<ref name=WADEC>[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:CytJ_toNZ4AJ:www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,133/Itemid,/+tammar+wallaby&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgR_a4oKd9voeWv2aUWtPGzqxOM1m15PbZbFu0Z4c_CK-ArJ-JFSaIbGYDrHMf-EWTGt8NwSek5aKRES0KY76lcVvprSSfiREQErb4aYbGXWlVZIp8fwiiM5QAR4HoNPyLIgJKT&sig=AHIEtbSE6ZlDgkKgePNuAQ7p3g0GbkRhJg Tammar wallaby] Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation</ref> The tammar wallaby exhibits significant [[sexual dimorphism]], with the  maximum recorded weight in males being 9.1 kg and maximum recorded weight in females is 6.9 kg.

==Conservation and introduction to New Zealand==
[[File:Abrolhos North-Island3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tammar wallaby on [[North Island]] in the [[Houtman Abrolhos]]. Although native to the mainland and nearby islands, the Tammar Wallaby has only recently been introduced to North Island, and in the absence of any predators, has increased in population to the point where the islands's vegetation is being heavily overgrazed.]]
Tammar wallaby populations on both mainland Australia and some islands have been greatly reduced or even eradicated since European occupation. The mainland population of tammars have been descripted as "very plentiful in many parts of the south-west, but rapidly disappearing in the cultivated districts, especially towards the northern end of its range."<ref>Shortridge GC. 1909.

(2005) ''Life of Marsupials'', pp. 332-42. CSIRO Publishing. ISBN 0643062572</ref>{{rp|332}} In the 19th century, tammars were so common on the [[Eyre Peninsula]] and around Adelaide that [[wikt:battue|battues]] were organized to destroy large numbers to protect crops and pastures. This has caused drastic declines and the tammar became extinct in Adelaide by the 1920s and in the Eyre Peninsula probably by the 1970s.<ref name=Tyndale2005/>{{rp|332-33}} However the genotype of Eyre tammars survives as they were introduced to New Zealand on [[Kawau Island]] and [[Rotorua]]. Farming activities led to the extinction of the tammar on Flinders Island and St. Peter<U+2019>s Island. Only on Kangaroo Island are tammars abundant and secure.<ref name=Tyndale2005/>{{rp|333}} 

==Ecology and life history==
[[File:Tammar wallaby Innes.JPG|thumb|230px|left|The tammar is mostly  nocturnal]]
On Kangaroo Island, tammar wallabies shelter under divaricating bushes which cover most of the island. Tammars are [[nocturnal]], being most active after dusk and before dawn. During this time, they forage for acacia seeds in the shrubs and feed on grassy clearing or farmland pasture.<ref name=Tyndale2005/>{{rp|335}} Tammars live in well-defined home ranges of 42 ha in summer and 16 ha in winter, and the ranges overlap with each other.<ref name=Inns1980>Inns RW. 1980. "Ecology of the Kangaroo Island wallaby, ''Macropus eugenii'' (Desmarest), in Flinders Chase National Park, Kangaroo Island". (PhD dissertation). University of Adelaide.</ref> Tammars occupy a daytime area of scrub for shelter from the sun and then move to another area of grassland at night. In summer, grass dries off and the tammars move over greater distances than in winter to higher quality food.<ref name=Inns1980/> Plant species in their diet include ''[[Gastrolobium bilobum]]'', ''[[Austrodanthonia setacea]]'', and ''[[Corymbia calophylla]]''.<ref name=WADEC/> 
[[File:Tamarwallaby.JPG|thumb|230px|right|Tammar resting]]
Tammars lick their forearms and pant to maintain their body temperature against high ambient temperatures. When the ambient temperature is above 30<U+00B0>C, the respiratory system of the tammar increases steeply and evaporate water loss also increases. When the ambient  temperature is above 40<U+00B0>C, it can no longer control its body temperature and will die unless it can get away from the heat.<ref>Dawson TJ, Denny MJS, Hulbert AJ, 1969.

They can live on seawater because they have a renal concentrating capacity far greater than other small macropods.<ref>Hume  ID, Dunning A. 1979.

===Breeding===
[[File:Macropus eugenii with calf 2.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Mother wallaby with young in pouch]]
The tammar wallaby has a promiscuous mating system with females mating with multiple males.<ref name=Rudd1994>Rudd CD. 1994.

====TSDS====
In late 1998, between 120 and 230 tammar wallabies died suddenly in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms. and most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome is known as Tammar Sudden Death Syndrome (TSDS) and the pathogen is an [[orbivirus]] of the family [[Reoviridae]]. It does not occur south of Sydney, and captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have suffered subsequent infections in summer months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kirkland|first=Peter D.|date=June 2005|title=Epidemic Viral Diseases in Wildlife|journal=Microbiology Australia|volume=26|issue=2|pages=82-85|issn=1324-4272|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=haCr7ztxTrwC&pg=PA82&dq=Tammar+Wallaby&hl=en&ei=yPMdTr36BKOimQWk14W7Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Tammar%20Wallaby&f=false}}</ref>

==Genome==
[[File:Tammar Wallaby.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Tammars are easy to keep in captivity]]
The genome of a marsupial is of great interest to scientists studying [[comparative genomics]], because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans: [[mice]] are too close and have not developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote. <ref name=proposal>[http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/WallabySEQ.pdf  Proposal to sequence the genome of the model marsupial ''Macropus eugenii'' (Tammar Wallaby)] </ref> The tammar wallaby is one of the [[model organism]]s as it is cheap to maintain and relatively tractable to scientific study.<ref>J A Marshall Graves. 2002.

Australian scientists, led by Dr. [[Ben Cocks]], have found a compound in the milk of the Tammar Wallaby called [[AGG01]] which has the potential to be a new and powerful form  of antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein and in laboratory testing AGG01 has been shown to be 100 times more effective than [[penicillin]], killing over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria (both gram-positive and gram<U+2013>negative) and fungus that it was incubated with, including ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Proteus vulgaris]]'' and [[golden staphylococcus]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Fighting superbugs with milk | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025484.300-fighting-superbugs-with-milk.html | work = [http://NewScientist.com NewScientist.com] | date = 20 April 2006 | accessdate = 2006-09-07}}</ref>
