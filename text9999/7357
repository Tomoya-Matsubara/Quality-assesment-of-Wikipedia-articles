==Overview==
The city site has been occupied for thousands of years.  The [[Assyrians]] called the city [[Melid]]du.<ref name="Hawkins, John D. 2000">Hawkins, John D. ''Corpus of Hieroglyphic Luwian Inscriptions. Vol. 1: Inscriptions of the Iron Age.'' Walter de Gruyter, 2000.</ref> Following Roman expansion into the east, the city was renamed in [[Latin]] as '''Melitene'''.  The site of ancient Malatya lies a few kilometres from the modern city in what is now the village of [[Arslantepe]] and near the dependant district center of [[Battalgazi]] ([[Byzantine]] to [[Ottoman Empire]]).  Present-day Battalgazi was the location of the city of Malatya until the 19th century, when a gradual move of the city to the present third location began.  Battalgazi's official name was [[Eskimalatya]] (''Old Malatya''); until recently, it was a name used locally.

==History==
=== Aslantepe and Ancient Malatya===
{{main|Arslantepe}}
Arslantepe has been inhabited since the development of agriculture in the [[Fertile Crescent]], nearly 6,000 years ago. From the [[Bronze Age]], the site became an administrative center of a larger region in the kingdom of ''[[Isuwa]]''. The city was heavily fortified, probably due to the [[Hittites|Hittite]] menace from the west. The Hittites conquered the city in the fourteenth century B.C. In [[Hittite language|Hittite]], ''melid'' or ''milit'' means "honey," offering a possible etymology for the name. After the end of the Hittite empire, the city became the center of the [[Neo-Hittite]] state of [[Kammanu]]. The city continued old Hittite traditions and styles.  Researchers have discovered a palace inside the city walls, which has statues and reliefs that are examples of the artistic works of that age. The people erected a palace, accompanied by monumental stone sculptures of lions and the ruler.  [[Archeologists]] first began to excavate the site of Arslantepe in the 1930s, led by [[French people|French]] archaeologist [[Louis Delaporte]]. 

The [[Assyria]]n king [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115-1077 B.C.) forced the kingdom of Malatya to pay tribute to Assyria.  Malatya continued to prosper until the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] (722-705) sacked the city in 712 BC. At the same time, the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] invaded [[Anatolia]], and the city declined. Since 1961, an Italian team of archaeologists, today led by Marcella Frangipane, have been working at the site.

Under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, Melitene was the base camp of [[Legio XII Fulminata|Legio XII ''Fulminata'']]. It was a major center in [[Lesser Armenia]] (''P'ok'r Hayk<nowiki>'</nowiki>''), remaining so until the end of the fourth century A.D. Emperor [[Theodosius I]] divided the region into two provinces: [[First Armenia]] (Hayk'), with its capital at [[Sivas]]; and [[Second Armenia]], with its capital at Melitene.<ref name="SAE">{{hy icon}} Hakobyan, Tadevos Kh.

===Middle Ages===
During the reign of the Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527-565), new administrative reforms were carried out in this region, and Melitene became the capital of the province of [[Third Armenia]].<ref>{{cite book

In the 9th century, under its semi-independent emir [[Umar al-Aqta]], Malatya rose to become a major opponent of the [[Byzantine Empire]], until Umar was defeated and killed at [[Battle of Lalakaon|Lalakaon]] in 863. The Byzantines attacked the city many times, but did not finally take it until the campaigns of [[John Kourkouas]] in 927-934. After successively accepting and renouncing vassal status, the city was finally taken in May 934, its Muslim inhabitants driven out or forced to convert, and replaced by Greek and Armenian settlers.<ref>{{cite book

In the tenth century the Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] convinced the [[Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch]] to move many of his followers into the region of Melitene. These [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]] set up bishoprics in Melitene as well as in many surrounding cities.<ref>{{cite book

  | isbn = }}</ref> In the period that followed the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] advance into Anatolia after the [[Battle of Manzikert]], [[Gabriel of Melitene]], a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[Armenian people|Armenian]] (see [[Hayhurum]]) who had risen from the ranks of the Byzantine army, governed the city. From 1086 to 1100 he preserved his independence with the aid of the [[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|Beylik]] of the [[Danishmends]] and after 1100, he invested heavily on the commanders of the [[First Crusade]], especially [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] and [[Baldwin of Boulogne]].<ref>[[Gabriel of Melitene|Gabriel]] gave his daughter [[Morphia of Melitene]] in marriage to [[Baldwin of Boulogne|Baldwin]] along with a [[dowry]] of 50,000 gold [[bezants]]. He also helped pay the [[ransom]] for [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]] when he was made captive by [[Danishmend Gazi]]. Even Baldwin's beard weighed heavily on [[Melitene]]. [[William of Tyre]] relates an anecdote in which Baldwin manipulates Gabriel's Oriental sensitivities, especially the reverence for the beard, and manages to extract 30,000 bezants from the ruler by duping him, through a scene arranged with his knights, into believing that he had put his beard in pledge for his soldiery's pay. Gabriel swiftly settled the account and Baldwin and his knights left rejoiced at the success of their stratagem, laughing heartily at the ridiculous veneration of the Orientals for the beard. There are no records of these Armenian assets thus siphoned having been later returned in one form or the other, either by Baldwin or relatives. In september 1101, the Danishmend Turks captured Malatya and in 1113, Baldwin forced [[Morphia of Melitene|Morphia]] to enter in a [[convent]] to marry another woman.

The Danishmends took over Malatya one years later in 1101 (see [[Battle of Melitene]]). With the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] based in [[Konya]] taking over the [[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|Beylik]] of Danishmend in late 12th century, Malatya became part of their realm. It was part of [[Mamluks]] in end of 13th century. The city became [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] in 1515.

===Modern===
The current city of Malatya was founded in 1838, with the old site of Mitilene now designated as Old Malatya.<ref>''Britannica''. 15th Edition (1982), Vol. 7, p. 526</ref>

Malatya was the scene of anti-Armenian violence during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the [[Hamidian Massacres]] of 1895-1896, the Armenians of Malatya unsuccessfully attempted to defend themselves against the persecutions of the Ottoman government. Over 7,500 of them were massacred, the great majority of them women, children and elderly.<ref name="SAE"/> In the aftermath, a [[Red Cross]] team sent to Malatya and led by Julian B. Hubbell concluded that 1,500 Armenian houses had been pillaged and 375 burned to the ground.<ref>{{cite book

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia|1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'']], Malatya city was inhabited by 30,000 people at the time, with a clear [[Turkish people|Turkish]] majority, and an Armenian population of 3,000, of whom 800 were [[Catholics]].<ref>{{CathEncy| url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Melitene | title = Melitene|author=| accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> A more recent source, however, states that Malatya's population hovered around 40,000, of which half (20,000) were Armenian.<ref name="SAE"/> Of the five churches in the city, three belonged to the Armenians. They were chiefly involved in commerce, silkworm cultivation and agriculture. In the spring of 1915, the Armenians of the town were rounded up by Ottoman authorities and [[Armenian Genocide|sent on death marches]] to the deserts of Syria. Those who survived the Armenian Genocide settled in a number of different countries.<ref name="SAE"/>

==Cuisine==
[[File:Malatya Aprikot Cakes.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Apricot products in Malatya]]
Meatballs (k<U+00F6>fte) have a special place in the cuisine as do apricots, which are used in many meals from kebabs (meat broiled or roasted in small pieces) to desserts. There are over seventy kinds of k<U+00F6>fte (meatballs) usually made with wheat and other ingredients mixed in.  "Kagit Kebabi" is one of the most important local specialities.  "Kagit Kebabi" is a dish made of lamb and vegetables broiled in a wrapper, which is usually oily paper.

The Malatya region is best known for its [[apricot]] orchards. About 50% of the fresh apricot production and 95% of the dried apricot production in Turkey, the world's leading apricot producer, is provided by Malatya<ref>{{cite web | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0196890406001932 Abstract:| title = Input<U+2013>output energy analysis in dry apricot production of Malatya, Turkey |author=Kemal Eseng<U+00FC>n, Orhan G<U+00FC>nd<U+00FC>z, G<U+00FC>listan Erdal [[Gaziosmanpa<U+015F>a University]], [[Tokat]])|publisher=Energy Conversion and Management, [[ScienceDirect]], [[Elsevier]], [[Holland]]| accessdate=}}</ref> and the name of the fruit is synonymous with the city. After having been brought from its homeland in [[Eastern Armenia]], it reached its most delicious and sophisticated form in the fertile soil of Malatya in [[Western Armenia]], nourished from the alluvial soil of the [[Euphrates]]. Overall, about 10-15% of the worldwide crop of fresh apricots, and about 65-80% of the worldwide production of dried apricots comes out of Malatya. Malatya apricots are often sun-dried by family-run orchards using traditional methods, before they are collected and shipped throughout the world.

==Festivals==
Malatya Fair and Apricot Festivities has been held since 1978, every year in July, to promote Malatya and apricots and to convene the producers to meet one another. During the festivities, various sports activities, concerts and apricot contests are organized.

Near Apricot Festivities, there are also some other annual activities on summer. Cherry Festivities at Ye<U+015F>ilyurt District of Malatya and Grape Festivities at [[Arapgir]] District are organized annually.

==Sports==
Malatya's official team is [[Malatyaspor]] with colors red and yellow. Malatyaspor football team is currently competing in [[TFF Second League]]. Malatyaspor's stadium is Malatya <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC> Stadium located in the city's center. Malatya's other team is [[Malatya Belediyespor]] with colors green and orange. It is currently competing in [[TFF Third League]].

==Education==
[[Inonu University]], one of the largest universities in eastern region of Turkey, is located in Malatya. It was established in 1975 and has three institutions and nine faculties on its campus, with more than 2,500 faculty and 20,000 students. Its large campus is located in the southern part of Malatya. There are 162 High schools and some of the well-known, national high school entrance examination based high schools in Malatya are [[Malatya Science High School]], Malatya Anatolian High School, Turgut <U+00D6>zal Anatolian High School, and Yaman Turk High School.

==Transportation==
By its relative advance in [[industry|industrial growth]], Malatya is also a pole of attraction for its surrounding regions, in commercial as well as inward immigration terms. The city is at a key junction in Turkey<U+2019>s road and rail network. By rail, it also serves as the junction for [[Aleppo]] through [[Syria]]-[[Samsun]] line. The [[bus terminal]] is located 5 kilometers west of the city center and there are regular intercity services to and from [[Ankara]], [[Istanbul]] and [[Gaziantep]]. The railway station lies at a distance of 3 kilometers west of the city center and daily express trains run to [[Elaz<U+0131><U+011F>]], [[Diyarbak<U+0131>r]], Istanbul and Ankara. Both these stations are easily reached by taxis and [[dolmu<U+015F>]] services.

Malatya's airport, [[Erha<U+00E7> Airport]], is 26 kilometers west of the city center and there are daily domestic flights from [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]] and [[Izmir]]. Since 2007 there have also been international flights during the summer months. These international flights are especially from German cities to Malatya, and most of the passengers are Turkish citizens who are now living and working in German.
