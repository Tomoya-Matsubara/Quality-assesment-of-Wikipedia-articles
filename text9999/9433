The idea of <U+017B>ydokomuna continued to endure to a certain extent in post-war Poland, because Polish anti-communists saw the Soviet-backed communist rise to power as the fruition of pre-war anti-Polish agitation; and with it came the implication of Jewish responsibility. The appointment of Jews in positions responsible for oppressing the populace further fueled this perception.<ref>Bozena Szaynock.

<U+017B>ydokomuna survives in the post-Soviet era primarily in rhetoric on the political fringe. However, in the minds of others the contentions of some Polish historians regarding Jewish disloyalty to Poland under the Soviets raises the specter of <U+017B>ydokomuna.<ref name=Bartov />

==Prelude==

The concept of a Jewish conspiracy threatening Polish social order dates in print to the pamphlet ''Rok 3333 czyli sen nies<U+0142>ychany'' (The Year 3333, or the Incredible Dream) by [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]] author and political activist [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]], written in 1817 and published posthumously in 1858.

At the end of the 19th century, [[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy|National Democratic]] party characterized Poland's Jews and other opponents of Dmowski's party as internal enemies who were behind international conspiracies inimical to Poland and who were agents of disorder, disruption and socialism.<ref name=BPorter>Brian Porter.

==Origin==
The term ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'' originated in connection with the Russian [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and became a prominent antisemitic stereotype<ref>Robert Blobaum. ''Antisemitism and Its Opponents in Modern Poland'' Cornell University Press, 2005, pp. 81-82.</ref> expressing political paranoia<ref name="Polonsky 2" /> and targeting Jewish communists during the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. The [[October Revolution|Russian revolution]] and emerging [[Soviet]] regime was seen by many Poles as Russian [[imperialism]] in a new guise.<ref name="Polonsky 2"/> The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the [[Polish Communist Party]] further heightened such fears.<ref name="Polonsky 2"/> According to [[Jaff Schatz]], the strength of the ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'' belief stemmed from age-old Polish fears of Russia and from anti-communist and antisemitic attitudes. Schatz writes that "because anti-Semitism was one of the main forces that drew Jews to the Communist movement, <U+017B>ydokomuna meant turning the effects of anti-Semitism into a cause of its further increase."<ref>Jaff Schatz, ''The Generation: The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Communists of Poland'', University of California Press, 1991, p. 95.</ref><ref>Jaff Schatz, "Jews and the Communist Movement in Interwar Poland," in Jonathan Frankel, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=POkxdm6DoAsC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=jaff+schatz+jews+communism&source=web&ots=B5QNMKyJ49&sig=KW-p4_cdwuVM_kHyU9zifzYbX8M&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA30,M1 ''Dark Times, Dire Decisions: Jews and Communism: Studies in Contemporary Jewry'']'', Oxford University Press US, 2005, p. 30.</ref> ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'' boosted antisemitism by amplifying ideas about an alleged "[[List_of_conspiracy_theories#Jewish_world_domination|Jewish world conspiracy]]."<ref name="Gerrits71">Andre Gerrits.

Page 71.</ref> According to this thinking, Bolshevism and communism became "the modern means to the long-attempted Jewish political conquest of Poland; the <U+017B>ydokomuna conspirators would finally succeed in establishing a '[[Judeopolonia|Judeo-Polonia]].'"<ref>David S. Wyman, Charles H. Rosenzveig.

Accusations of ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'' accompanied a wave of [[anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1918<U+2013>20|anti-Jewish violence in Poland during the years 1918-1920]], when violence against Jews was legitimized as Polish national self-defense against a people who were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. This ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'' paranoia led to violence and killings of Jews in a number of towns, including the [[Pinsk massacre]], in which 35 innocent Jews were murdered, and the [[Lw<U+00F3>w pogrom (1918)|Lw<U+00F3>w pogrom]], in which 72 Jews were murdered. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] served to heighten the stereotype.<ref name="Piotrowski-41-42">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Tadeusz Piotrowski]] | coauthors = | title =Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide... | year =1997 | editor = | pages =41<U+2013>42| chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher McFarland & Company | location = | isbn =0-7864-0371-3 | format = | accessdate = }}</ref><ref>Joanna B.

==Interbellum==
[[Image:1.2 The Jewish Bolshevism Image.png|thumb|150px|Caricatures of [[Bolshevik]] leaders from [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''[[The Jewish Bolshevism]]'']]

The National Democrats (''Endeks'') emerged from the [[Polish legislative election, 1930|1930 Polish elections]] to [[Sejm]] as the main opposition party to the [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski|Pi<U+0142>sudski]] government. Pi<U+0142>sudski had a liberal attitude towards minorities, and was respected by much of the Polish Jewish minority.<ref name="Cieplinski">{{cite web|last=Cieplinski|first=Feigue|url=http://www.binghamton.edu/history/resources/bjoh/PolesAndJews.htm|title=Poles and Jews: The Quest For Self-Determination 1919<U+2013>1934|year=2002|work=History Department at Binghamton University|dateformat = mdy|accessdate=June 2, 2006}}</ref> In the midst of the [[Great Depression]] and in a climate of widespread nationalist and antisemitic sentiment, the Endeks launched an anti-Jewish campaign aimed at exploiting dissatisfaction with the government at a time of economic crisis. The anti-Jewish agitation included calls for reducing the numbers of Jews in the country and an economic boycott (launched in 1931), leading to outbreaks of violence against Jews, particularly at universities. Following the death of Pi<U+0142>sudski in 1935, the Endeks moved towards seizing power in Poland, and began to exploit the "Jewish question" in full. The Endeks and other parties on the right employed the old ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'' stereotype alongside a new slogan, ''Folksfront'', both signifying an alleged alliance between Jews and communists.<ref>Joseph Marcus.

In the period between the two world wars, the ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'' myth grew concurrently in Poland with the myth of the "criminal Jew."<ref name="RB" /> Statistics from the 1920s had indicated a Jewish crime rate that was well below the percentage of Jews in the population. However, a subsequent reclassification of how crime was recorded<U+2014>which now included minor offenses<U+2014>succeeded in reversing the trend, and Jewish criminal statistics showed an increase relative to the Jewish population by the 1930s. These statistics were used by the Polish antisemitic press to propagate an image of the "criminal Jew;" additionally, political crimes by Jews were magnified, creating a perception of a criminal ''<U+017B>ydokomuna''.<ref name="RB">Robert Blobaum. "[http://books.google.com/books?id=HeUvRvZY0dEC&pg=PA13&dq=zydokomuna+catholic+violent&sig=ACfU3U0NoCZXGP13Eqc6Mqv3IkbL5MEq1Q#PPA97,M1 ''Criminalizing the <U+2018>Other<U+2019>: Crime, Ethnicity, and Antisemitism in Early. Twentieth-Century Poland.'']" In: Robert Blobaum, ed. ''Antisemitism and its opponents in modern Poland''. Cornell University Press, 2005: 83-97.</ref>

Another important factor was the perceived dominance of Jews in the leadership of the [[Communist Party of Poland]] (''KPP''). As noted by historian [[Joseph Marcus]], the KPP should not be considered a "Jewish party," as it was in fact in opposition to traditional Jewish economic and national interests.<ref>Joseph Marcus. ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9027932395&id=82ncGA4GuN4C&pg=PA362&lpg=PA362&ots=wlRamGIAQ3&dq=zydokomuna+endeks&sig=oiNo2S0bQl7bW6EUb3edvKEcKXg#PPA290,M1 Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland, 1919-1939.]'' Walter de Gruyter, 1983. p.290.</ref> The Jews supporting KPP saw themselves as international communists and rejected much of the Jewish culture and tradition.<ref name="IPN-UB"/> Nonetheless, the KPP, along with the [[Polish Socialist Party]], was notable for its decisive stand against anti-semitism.<ref> Celia Stopnicka Heller.

Page 253-254.</ref> Notably, the party had strong Jewish representation at higher levels. Out of fifteen leaders of the ''KPP'' central administration in 1936, eight were Jews. Jews constituted 53% of the "active members" of the ''KPP'', 75% of its "publication apparatus," 90% of the "international department for help to revolutionaries" and 100% of the "technical apparatus" of the Home Secretariat. In Polish court proceedings against communists between 1927 and 1936, 90% of the accused were Jews. In terms of membership, before its dissolution in 1938, 25% of ''KPP'' members were Jews; most urban ''KPP'' members were Jews<U+2014>a substantial number, given an 8.7% Jewish minority in [[Second Polish Republic|prewar Poland]].<ref name="Piotrowski-36-37">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] | coauthors = | title =Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide... | year =1997 | editor = | pages =36<U+2013>37 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =McFarland & Company | location = | isbn =0-7864-0371-3 | format = | accessdate = }}</ref>

According to Jaff Schatz's summary of Jewish participation in the prewar Polish communist movement: <blockquote>Throughout the whole interwar period, Jews constituted a very important segment of the Communist movement. According to Polish sources and to Western estimates, the proportion of Jews in the KPP [the Communist Party of Poland] was never lower than 22 percent. In the larger cities, the percentage of Jews in the KPP often exceeded 50 percent and in smaller cities, frequently over 60 percent. Given this background, a respondent's statement that "in small cities like ours, almost all Communists were Jews," does not appear to be a gross exaggeration.<ref name="JS">''[http://books.google.ca/books?id=A4FlatJCro4C&pg=PA37&dq=%22Jewish+membership+in+the+Communist+organization+in+Warsaw+increased+dramatically,+from+44+percent+in+1930+to+over+65+percent+in+1937%22&sig=ACfU3U2jjK18hcK_Qj0R3S-fdmEplMjjBw#PPA37,M1  Poland's Holocaust]'' p. 37</ref></blockquote> 

Research on voting patterns in Poland's parliamentary elections in the 1920s has shown that Jewish support for the communists was proportionally less than their representation in the total population.<ref name="Blobaum">{{cite book| author = Robert Blobaum | title= Antisemitism and Its Opponents In Modern Poland | publisher = [[Cornell University Press]] | year =1983 | url = http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801489695&id=gXisr7fgDjwC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&ots=HPSPnptsOw&dq=zydokomuna&sig=3joDtgo-m6NQriwVofZZ_sp_X30 | isbn = 0-691-11306-8}} p. 97.</ref> Support for Poland's communist and pro-Soviet parties came largely from Ukrainian and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Belarusian voters.<ref name="Blobaum"/> Schatz notes that even if post-war claims by Jewish communists that 40% of the 266,528 communist votes on several lists of front organizations at the [[Polish legislative election, 1928|1928 Sejm election]] came from the Jewish community were true (a claim Marcus describes as "almost certainly an exaggeration"),<ref>Joseph Marcus.

Though some Jews had initially benefited from the effects of the Soviet invasion, this occupation soon began to strike at the Jewish population as well; independent Jewish organizations were abolished and Jewish activists were arrested. Hundreds of thousands of Jews who had fled to the Soviet sector were given a choice of Soviet citizenship or returning to the German occupied zone.

The Polish-American historian [[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]] stressed that after the [[History of Poland (1945-1989)|Soviet takeover of Poland]] in 1945 violence had developed amid postwar retribution and counter-retribution, exacerbated by the breakdown of law and order and a [[cursed soldiers|Polish anti-Communist insurgency]].<ref name="Chod">[[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]], [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/catalog/data/088033/0880335114.HTM ''After the Holocaust Polish-Jewish Conflict in the Wake of World War II''], Columbia University Press, New York 2003, ISBN 0-88033-511-4</ref> According to Chodakiewicz, some Jewish "avengers" endeavored to extract justice from the Poles who harmed Jews during the War and in some cases Jews attempted to reclaim property confiscated by the Nazis. These phenomena further reinforced the stereotype of ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'', a Jewish-Communist conspiracy in post-war Poland. Chodakiewicz noted that after World War Two, the Jews were not only victims, but also aggressors. He describes cases in which Jews cooperated with the Polish secret police, denouncing Poles and members of the [[Home Army]]. Chodakiewicz noted that some 3500 to 6500 Poles died in late 1940s because of Jewish denunciations or were killed by Jews themselves.<ref name="On">{{pl icon}} Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, [http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80708,4830600.html ''Chodakiewicz: medialny "Strach" i niemedialna prawda''], gazeta.pl, 2008-01-11</ref>

Regarding this period, [[Andre Gerrits]] writes, in his study of the myth, that though communism was now a reality in Poland,

<blockquote>The vigor of antisemitism during the first post-war decade cannot be exclusively attributed to the prominent role of individuals of Jewish extraction in the newly-established Communist regimes. Various factors played a role<U+2014>from the continuation of traditional anti-Jewish sentiments (ethnically or religiously inspired) to the overall radicalizing effect of the war and the fear that the Jews who returned from camps, exile or hiding would reclaim their [property].<ref>Andre Gerrits. "Antisemitism and Anti-Communism: The Myth of 'Judeo-Communism' in Eastern Europe". ''East European Jewish Affairs''. 1995, vol. 25, no. 1:49-72. Page 61.</ref></blockquote>

The combination of the effects of the Holocaust and postwar antisemitism led to a dramatic mass emigration of Polish Jewry in the immediate postwar years. Of the estimated 240,000 Jews in Poland in 1946, only 90,000 remained a year later.<ref>Natalia Aleksiun.

The image of the Jew as a threatening outsider took on a new form as antisemitism was now linked to the imposition of communist rule in Poland, and rumors of massive collaboration of Jews with the unpopular new regime and the Soviet Union. Of the fewer than 80,000 Jews who remained in Poland, many had political reasons for doing so; according to one historian, "their group profile ever more closely resembled the mythic <U+017B>ydokomuna."<ref>Michael C.

During [[Stalinism]], the preferred Soviet policy was to keep sensitive posts in the hands of non-Poles.

These Jewish members of the security forces would become useful as [[scapegoat]]s in the period of de-Stalinization. According to one account:<blockquote>While Poland<U+2019>s communists had been highly selective in their choice of Jewish scapegoats after Stalin<U+2019>s death, if only because other Jews in the party and security apparatus could not be excluded from participating in the whole process, and the desire of the leadership to keep a tight grip on the scope of the ensuing investigations, there is further evidence to suggest that Poland<U+2019>s communists had grown accustomed to placing the burden of their own failures to gain sufficient legitimacy among the Polish population during the entire communist period on the shoulders of Jews in the party.<ref>L.W.

As described in one historical account, the party hardline [[Natolin faction|"Natolin" faction]] "once again used anti-Semitism as a political weapon and found an echo both in the party ''apparat'' and in society at large, where traditional stereotypes of an insidious Jewish cobweb of political influence and economic gain resurfaced, but now in the context of 'Judeo-communism,'  the <U+017B>ydokomuna."<ref>Frances Millard.

As historian Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled anti-semitic claims and classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'' myth to communist Poland, Stola writes: <blockquote>"Paradoxically, probably the most powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest as a tool of communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them."<ref name="stola1968">Dariusz Stola.

==1989&ndash;present==
Post-communist Poland experienced what has been described as a sudden, intense and widespread outburst of anti-Jewish mood, including allegations that Jews were to blame for Poland's "decline" during the communist years, and Jew-baiting of political opponents during election campaigns. More recent efforts have emerged from a wide range of sources in the Polish community to challenge these conceptions of Jews and to foster a pluralistic society in Poland.<ref>Steven Elliott Grosby, Athena S.

The expression ''<U+017B>ydokomuna'' is now used almost exclusively by fringe nationalists, usually in reference to former communist party members and to "liberals" who have supported capitalist reforms, [[globalization]] and [[European integration]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Organizations attacked as "''<U+017B>ydokomuna''" have included the ''[[Democratic Left Alliance|SLD]]'' and ''[[Freedom Union (Poland)|UW]]'' [[political party|political parties]], and ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', whose editor-in-chief, [[Adam Michnik]], is of Jewish origin.<ref>[[Henryk Paj<U+0105>k]], ''Pi<U+0105>ty rozbi<U+00F3>r Polski 1990<U+2013>2000'', Wydawnictwo Retro, 1998, p.92</ref> 

Historian [[Omer Bartov]] has written that "recent writings and pronouncements seem to indicate that the myth of the <U+017B>ydokomuna (Jews as communists) has not gone away"{{ndash}}as evidenced by the writings of younger Polish scholars, such as [[Marek Chodakiewicz]], contending Jewish disloyalty to Poland during the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet occupation]].<ref name=Bartov>Omer Bartov.

On July 11, 2009, several hundred Polish [[neo-Nazi]] sympathizers marched on the streets of [[Warsaw]], shouting out slogans such as "National-Socialism", "Down with Jewish chauvinism" and "Down with the Jewish occupation". <ref>([http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,7249121,Heil_Hitler_na_11_listopada.html] Gazeta Wyborcza)</ref>

==Historiography==
[[Historiography]] of <U+017B>ydokomuna remains controversial.<ref>Marci Shore.

Gross]] have polarized debate over anti-Jewish violence in Poland, Gross and his supporters characterizing <U+017B>ydokomuna as an antisemitic clich<U+00E9> while to some of his critics <U+017B>ydokomuna was a fact of history.<ref name="jbmsov"/>

Historians [[Joanna B. Michlic]] and [[Laurence Weinbaum]] charge that post-1989 Polish historiography has seen a revival of "an ethnonationalist historical approach".<ref name="jbmsov"/><ref>http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/986231.html Whoever controls the past By Laurence Weinbaum</ref> According to Michlic, among some Polish historians, "[myth of <U+017C>ydokomuna] served the purpose of rationalizing and explaining the participation of ethnic Poles in killing their Jewish neighbors and, thus, in minimizing the criminal nature of the murder."<ref name="jbmsov">Joanna B.
