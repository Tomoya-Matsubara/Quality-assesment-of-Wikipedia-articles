The '''2009 UEFA Champions League Final''' was played on 27 May 2009 at the [[Stadio Olimpico]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. The match determined the winners of the [[2008<U+2013>09 UEFA Champions League|2008<U+2013>09 season]] of the [[UEFA Champions League]], a tournament for the top [[association football|football]] clubs in Europe. The match was won by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] of [[Spain]], who beat [[England]]'s [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2<U+2013>0. [[Samuel Eto'o]] opened the scoring in the 10th&nbsp;minute, and [[Lionel Messi]] added another goal 20&nbsp;minutes from the end to earn Barcelona an historic [[Treble (association football)#Continental trebles|treble]] of [[La Liga]], the [[Copa del Rey]] and the Champions League, a feat never before achieved by a Spanish club.<ref name="guardiola_salutes">{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Ashby |title=Guardiola salutes his treble winners |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/fixturesresults/round=15280/match=302813/report=rw.html |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=27 May 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009 }}</ref> The match was refereed by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[referee (association football)|referee]] [[Massimo Busacca]].<ref name="referee"/>

==Background==
Manchester United and Barcelona had previously faced each other nine times in European competitions: three times in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and six times in the UEFA Champions League. Of those nine matches, Manchester United had recorded three wins to Barcelona's two, with the remaining four matches finishing in draws. The only time that the two teams met in a final came in 1991, when they contested the [[1991 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1991 Cup Winners' Cup final]]. The first meeting between the two sides came in the third round of the [[European Cup Winners' Cup 1983<U+2013>84|1983<U+2013>84 Cup Winners' Cup]]; Barcelona won the first leg at the [[Camp Nou]] 2<U+2013>0, but Manchester United won the return leg 3<U+2013>0 at [[Old Trafford]] to reach the semi-finals. That result marked Manchester United's biggest win over Barcelona; Barcelona's biggest win was a 4<U+2013>0 home victory in the group stage of the [[1994<U+2013>95 UEFA Champions League|1994<U+2013>95 Champions League]]. The most recent meeting between the teams came in the semi-finals of the [[2007<U+2013>08 UEFA Champions League|2007<U+2013>08 Champions League]], when United held Barcelona to a 0<U+2013>0 draw at the Camp Nou before beating them 1<U+2013>0 back at Old Trafford.<ref>{{cite web |title=United versus Barcelona |url=http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/opponents/barcelona.html |publisher=StretfordEnd.co.uk |accessdate=7 May 2009 }}</ref>

Both teams went into the match as the champions of their respective countries <U+2013> the first time that the final had been contested by domestic champions since [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|1999]], when Manchester United beat [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2<U+2013>1 at Barcelona's home, the Camp Nou <U+2013> both winning with games to spare. Manchester United won their 11th [[Premier League]] title with a 0<U+2013>0 draw at home to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 16 May,<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 0-0 Arsenal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8038259.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=17 May 2009 }}</ref> while Barcelona were confirmed as [[La Liga]] champions for the first time in three years when [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] lost to [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] on the same day.<ref name="spanish_title">{{cite news |title=Barca clinch Spanish league title |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8054011.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=17 May 2009 }}</ref> Both Manchester United and Barcelona were also looking for another Champions League title to cap a season in which they had won multiple trophies: Manchester United had already won four out of a possible seven trophies in [[Manchester United F.C. season 2008<U+2013>09|2008<U+2013>09]] and were playing for the possibility of becoming the third team to retain the [[The Double#European Double|European Double]] (the domestic league and the European Cup), while Barcelona were aiming to become the first Spanish club to win a [[Treble (association football)#Continental trebles|Treble]] of [[La Liga 2008<U+2013>09|La Liga]], the [[Copa del Rey 2008<U+2013>09|Copa del Rey]] and the UEFA Champions League.<ref name="spanish_title"/>

The [[Stadio Olimpico]] in [[Rome]] had hosted three [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winners|European Cup finals]] before 2009: the [[1977 European Cup Final|1977]] and [[1984 European Cup Final|1984 finals]], both of which were won by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] <U+2013> Liverpool beat [[Borussia M<U+00F6>nchengladbach]] 3<U+2013>1 in 1977 before beating home side [[A.S.

The construction of the stadium was commissioned by Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] in the mid-1930s as the centrepiece of a new sports complex in the city, to be named ''Foro Mussolini''. After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the complex was renamed ''Foro Italico'' and the stadium was radically redesigned as a 54,000-capacity arena for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. After hosting the [[1987 World Championships in Athletics|1987 World Athletics Championships]], the stadium was redeveloped in time for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], at which [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]'s 1<U+2013>0 win over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] was played there. The stadium's most recent renovation, in 2008, increased its capacity to 72,689.<ref name="olimpico"/>

As the reigning champions of the UEFA Champions League, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] began their title defence at the group stage, for which they were given the top seed. This position amongst the top eight European clubs meant that they would avoid drawing former European champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] until at least the first knockout round, although they were faced with the prospect of drawing [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] or [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Nevertheless, United ended up being drawn into Group E with two teams they had played against before: [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] (whom they had drawn in [[2005<U+2013>06 UEFA Champions League|2005<U+2013>06]]) and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] ([[2006<U+2013>07 UEFA Champions League|2006<U+2013>07]]); and one they had not: [[AaB Football|Aalborg BK]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd to face Celtic in Europe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7584644.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2009 }}</ref>

Two victories <U+2013> away to Aalborg and at home to Celtic <U+2013> and four draws were enough to secure passage to the knockout stage of the competition. Following a Celtic victory over Villarreal in the final group match, United went through as group winners.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 2-2 Aalborg |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7763234.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 December 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2009 }}</ref> This meant that they would avoid Roma, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, [[F.C. Porto|Porto]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the first knockout round; however, their potential opposition still included Internazionale, [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] and Real Madrid. The draw paired Manchester United with [[Jos<U+00E9> Mourinho]]'s Internazionale, but since United had won their group, they were rewarded by having the second leg at home.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd to face Mourinho's Inter |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7790235.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2009 }}</ref>

United started the first leg the better of the two sides, and although Inter improved in the second half, neither side was able to find the net during the match, and United took a 0<U+2013>0 draw back to [[Old Trafford]]. The draw was also United's 20th match since their last defeat in the UEFA Champions League, breaking [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]'s 19-match record that had stood for 13 years.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Ashenden |title=Inter Milan 0-0 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7904057.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=24 February 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2009 }}</ref> The lack of an [[away goals rule|away goal]] at the [[San Siro]] meant that United could not afford to concede a goal in the event of a draw. A fourth-minute headed goal from [[Nemanja Vidi<U+0107>]], however, got the home side off to a good start, and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] doubled United's lead four&nbsp;minutes into the second half. Shots from both [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi<U+0107>]] and [[Adriano Leite Ribeiro|Adriano]] hit the frame of the Manchester United goal in either half of the match, but they were unable to find the back of the net, and the 2<U+2013>0 result sent the English champions through to the next stage of the competition.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 2-0 Inter Milan (agg 2-0) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7899577.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2009 }}</ref>

The draw for the quarter-finals paired United with [[F.C. Porto|Porto]], against whom they had played in the first knockout round of the [[2003<U+2013>04 UEFA Champions League|2003<U+2013>04 competition]].

A 40-yard goal from Ronaldo in the sixth&nbsp;minute put United into the lead, and although both sides pressed for another goal, it proved to be the only one of the game, making Manchester United the first English side to win in Porto.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Fletcher |title=FC Porto 0-1 Man Utd (agg 2-3) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7976970.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2009 }}</ref>

With two away goals on the United scoreboard, Arsenal now had to score four goals to reach the final. However, it was United who scored the next goal, as they hit Arsenal on the break and Ronaldo scored within 15 seconds of Arsenal losing the ball at the other end of the pitch. 15&nbsp;minutes from time, Arsenal were awarded a [[penalty kick]] after [[Darren Fletcher]] brought [[Cesc F<U+00E0>bregas]] down in the [[penalty area]], a foul for which Fletcher was sent off <U+2013> despite replays showing that Fletcher had won the ball before making contact with F<U+00E0>bregas.

The [[Stadio Olimpico]] in [[Rome]] was selected as the venue for the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], on 4 October 2006. The committee <U+2013> who decided the venue for the 2008 final and the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final|2008]] and [[2009 UEFA Cup Final]]s at the same meeting <U+2013> based its decision on a number of factors, including stadium capacity, safety and security facilities, and accessibility.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Chaplin |title=Moscow chosen for 2008 final |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=464106.html |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |location=[[Ljubljana]] |date=4 October 2006 |accessdate=12 May 2009 }}</ref>

Since [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|1999]], the UEFA Champions League final has been given a unique visual identity in order to increase the marketing appeal of the event. Designed by [[London]]-based design and branding agency Radiant, the theme for the 2009 final was revealed on 25 October 2008, and it incorporated several typically [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] images; the logo was centred around an outline of the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]], upon which was written "MMIX" <U+2013> "2009" in [[Roman numerals]]; around the base of the trophy was a stylised [[laurel wreath]], and in the background was a simplified image of the interior of the [[Colosseum]]. An alternative logo consisting of the UEFA Champions League logo surrounded by a laurel wreath was also released. The entire theme was based on a colour scheme of deep red and silver-white.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ancient and modern touch for 2009 logo |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=766089.html |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=25 October 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2009 }}</ref>

A trophy handover ceremony was held in Rome on 21 April 2009, at which [[Ole Gunnar Solskj<U+00E6>r]], representing Manchester United as the previous season's champions, returned the trophy to UEFA president [[Michel Platini]]. Platini then presented the trophy to [[Gianni Alemanno]], the [[List of mayors of Rome|Mayor of Rome]], that it might be put on display in and around the city until the day of the final. Also present at the ceremony were the president and vice-president of the [[Italian Football Federation]], Giancarlo Abete and [[Demetrio Albertini]], the ambassador for the final, [[Bruno Conti]], and Emilio Di Toro on behalf of the [[Italian National Olympic Committee]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Rome ready for trophy handover |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=822348.html |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=21 April 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2010 }}</ref>

[[File:Official match ball in Rome.jpg|thumb|upright|A giant replica of the ''adidas Finale Rome'' at the UEFA Champions Festival]]
The official [[Football (ball)|match ball]] for the 2009 Champions League final was the ''[[adidas]] Finale Rome''. Based on the "Starball" design that has been used for the Champions League final since [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final|2001]] and become synonymous with the UEFA Champions League, the ''Finale Rome'' was unveiled on 16 March 2009. The colour scheme was a traditional Roman [[burgundy (color)|burgundy]] with a gold border around the stars. The ball used the same panel configuration as the [[UEFA Euro 2008#Match ball|Adidas Europass]] and the [[Adidas Teamgeist]] before it, and the same thermal bonding process was used to adhere the panels to each other, while the surface of the ball featured the same "PSC-Texture" as was debuted with the Europass; the surface of the ball was covered with thousands of tiny pimples, which was designed to improve the grip between [[football boot|boot]] and ball.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iconic 'Finale Rome' set for ultimate stage |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=811193.html |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=adidas Roma Champions League Final Ball Revealed! |url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/general/archive/2009/03/16/football-news-adidas-roma-champions-league-final-ball-revealed-16-03-09.aspx |work=SoccerBible.com |publisher=SoccerBible |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2009 }}</ref>

===Officials===
[[File:Massimo Busacca.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Swiss referee [[Massimo Busacca]] at work]]
The [[referee (association football)|referee]] for the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final was [[Massimo Busacca]], representing the [[Swiss Football Association]].<ref name="referee"/> Having been on FIFA's list of internationally accredited referees since 1999,<ref>{{cite web |title=Switzerland - Men's Referees List |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/association=sui/peoplekind=ref.html |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=14 October 2009 }}</ref> Busacca had experience of officiating 32 UEFA Champions League matches, six of them during the 2008<U+2013>09 season, and most recently the second leg of Manchester United's quarter-final against [[F.C.

He also took charge of the first leg of the semi-final between Manchester United and Barcelona in the [[2007<U+2013>08 UEFA Champions League|2007<U+2013>08 competition]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Paolo |last=Menicucci |title=Busacca relishes chance to referee final |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=833822.html |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=27 May 2009 |accessdate=27 May 2009 }}</ref> Busacca also refereed at both the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008]], and took charge of the [[2007 UEFA Cup Final]] between [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] and [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] at [[Hampden Park]], [[Glasgow]], on 16 May 2007.<ref name="referee"/>

As usual, the referee was supported by assistant referees and a fourth official from the same country; in the 2009 final, Massimo Busacca was assisted by Matthias Arnet and Francesco Buragina, with Claudio Circhetta as the fourth official.<ref name="referee"/>

===Kits===
Having been designated as the official [[Home (sports)|"home" team]], Barcelona were given the first choice of kits for the final and opted to wear their traditional red and blue halved shirts. Since the Barcelona home kit clashed with both Manchester United's home and European away kits, the Red Devils wore their white domestic away kit for the first time in a European Cup final. They wore blue for their first European Cup final against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in [[1968 European Cup Final|1968]], but wore red for both of their most recent finals in [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|1999]] and [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008]]. Manchester United had previously worn white against Barcelona in five matches, losing just one of them <U+2013> a 2<U+2013>0 defeat in 1984 <U+2013> while the only win in white came in the [[1991 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1991 Cup Winners' Cup Final]]. The other three matches finished in draws: two 3<U+2013>3 and one 0<U+2013>0. Barcelona, on the other hand, had won two of their five European Cup finals <U+2013> they wore orange for their win over [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in [[1992 European Cup Final|1992]] but wore their usual blue and red stripes for their most recent win in [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|2006]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. However, two of their European Cup final defeats came against teams wearing white <U+2013> against [[FC Steaua Bucure<U+015F>ti|Steaua Bucure<U+015F>ti]] in [[1986 European Cup Final|1986]] and against [[A.C.

===Opening ceremony===
{{Double image stack|right|FCB Mosaic.jpg|For Sir Matt mosaic.jpg|200|Fans of both teams form club-specific mosaics in the build-up to the match.}}
The 2009 UEFA Champions League Final officially opened with the opening of the UEFA Champions Festival at Rome's ''[[Arch of Constantine|Arco di Constantino]]'' and the ''Parco di Colle Oppio'' above the [[Colosseum]]. The Champions Festival was opened by former [[Italy national football team|Italian]] international [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Luca Marchegiani]] on 23 May 2009 and ran until the afternoon on the day of the final, culminating with a football match between a European side coached by [[Ruud Gullit]] and an all-Italian team featuring [[Alessandro Costacurta]] and final ambassador [[Bruno Conti]]. Other attractions at the Champions Festival included appearances by representatives from both clubs ([[Bryan Robson]] and [[Ole Gunnar Solskj<U+00E6>r]] for Manchester United and [[Hristo Stoichkov]] for Barcelona), exhibitions featuring memorabilia from past UEFA Champions League tournaments and the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]] on display.<ref>{{cite news |title=UEFA Champions Festival in Rome |url=http://www.uefa.com/multimediafiles/download/pressrelease/uefa/uefamedia/83/16/29/831629_download.pdf |format=PDF |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=4 June 2009 }}</ref>

===Match summary===
====First half====
Barcelona kicked the match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper [[V<U+00ED>ctor Vald<U+00E9>s]] to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further pressure on the attack resulted in [[Yaya Tour<U+00E9>]] fouling [[Anderson Lu<U+00ED>s de Abreu Oliveira|Anderson]] within [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]'s shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Vald<U+00E9>s, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and [[Gerard Piqu<U+00E9>]] did well to divert [[Park Ji-Sung]]'s follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting [[corner kick|corner]] was cleared, but only as far as [[Wayne Rooney]], whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a [[goal kick]].

Both teams struggled to put a flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventh&nbsp;minute: having been played the ball by [[Michael Carrick]], Ronaldo turned away from Piqu<U+00E9> on the edge of the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40&nbsp;yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and [[Patrice Evra]] had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the ball on the chest before hitting the ball just past the far post.

[[File:041 men at work UEFA 2009, Rome.jpg|thumb|left|Thierry Henry picks the ball out of the net after Barcelona's first goal.]]
However, despite United's early pressure, it was Barcelona who scored the first goal of the match. [[Edwin van der Sar]] cleared the ball downfield for Manchester United, but it was headed away by Barcelona's [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|midfield anchor]] [[Sergio Busquets]]. Carrick was first to the ball for Manchester United, but he could only head it as far as [[Xavi]], who passed to [[Andr<U+00E9>s Iniesta]]. The Manchester United defence backed away from the Spaniard, who <U+2013> after exchanging passes with [[Lionel Messi]] <U+2013> played the ball into the path of [[Samuel Eto'o]] in the Manchester United penalty area. [[Nemanja Vidi<U+0107>]] attempted to shepherd the Cameroonian striker towards the goal line, but Eto'o easily stepped inside him and toe-poked the ball past Van der Sar to make it 1<U+2013>0 to Barcelona inside 10&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="minute_by_minute">{{cite web |title=Minute-by-minute |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/fixturesresults/round=15280/match=302813/report=mbm.html |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=27 May 2009 |accessdate=30 May 2009 }}</ref>

The goal shifted the balance of the game in Barcelona's favour, as United had been on top in terms of shots and possession up to that point. Almost immediately after the restart <U+2013> Vidi<U+0107> gave away an unnecessary corner. In a rehearsed corner move, Xavi played the ball back to the edge of the penalty area towards Messi, but the tournament's top scorer was unable to make a proper connection. Nevertheless, Bar<U+00E7>a retained possession through some sharp inter-passing between Xavi and Iniesta. When United did managed to regain the ball, however, it was quickly given away by a poor pass from Carrick, while Anderson mis-timed a kick and completely missed the ball. It was now Barcelona's turn to pressurise the United players, forcing them into backward passes or long, hopeful balls forward.

The quality of the teams' passing remained the main difference between them; however, in the 16th&nbsp;minute, Barcelona lost the ball and [[Ryan Giggs]] sent a long ball forward to Ronaldo. Ronaldo's first touch took him inside Piqu<U+00E9> before going back outside the former Manchester United defender, who cynically blocked Ronaldo's run, earning himself the first [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] of the match. Ronaldo shaped to take the free kick himself, but it was Giggs who shot for goal, only to curl the ball just over the bar.<ref name="minute_by_minute"/>

[[File:039 men at work UEFA 2009, Rome.jpg|thumb|Michael Carrick (background) watches as Lionel Messi shoots.]]
Barcelona responded almost immediately, [[Carles Puyol]] finding Eto'o with a long throw-in down the right wing. The Cameroonian then found Messi, who cut inside and hit a curling 25-yard shot that just shaved the top of the crossbar. A quick-passing move from United followed, culminating with a through-ball to Park in the inside right channel, only for Vald<U+00E9>s to cut out the pass, taking out the [[South Korea]]n in the process. The resulting throw-in eventually broke to Ronaldo, whose 30-yard shot went just wide. Vald<U+00E9>s' clash with Park, however, left him requiring treatment, and although the injury was not sufficient to necessitate a substitution, Vald<U+00E9>s chose to leave his next few goal kicks to Piqu<U+00E9>.

[[File:035 men at work UEFA 2009, Rome.jpg|thumb|left|Andr<U+00E9>s Iniesta (on the ground) is fouled by Anderson (number 8).]]
In the 22nd&nbsp;minute, a lofted through-pass from Carrick found Rooney on the left wing, but the Liverpudlian's cross was blocked by Tour<U+00E9> and went out for a corner kick. The corner, taken by Giggs, found Ronaldo, but the Portuguese got too far under the ball and headed over. Intricate passing from the Barcelona midfield got the Catalans moving upfield until a shoulder charge from Anderson sent Iniesta stumbling to the ground in the inside left channel 30&nbsp;yards from goal. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who sent the ball just wide of the near post. Another free kick followed, as Messi was bundled over by a double-challenge from Vidi<U+0107> and Carrick, but it came to nothing.

[[File:2009 Champions League Final Xavi free kick.jpg|thumb|Xavi prepares to take the consequent free kick.]]
With ten&nbsp;minutes left until half-time, the Manchester United defence effectively switched off and allowed Tour<U+00E9> to dribble unopposed to within 15&nbsp;yards of their penalty area before slipping the ball out wide to Puyol, whose low cross was diverted behind by Vidi<U+0107>. The corner kick was taken short and the eventual cross was headed behind for another corner on the opposite side by Evra. The second corner was crossed in towards Piqu<U+00E9>, but he was unable to make contact with the ball.

With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's confidence began to show: first, Messi attempted to flick a pass over the top of the United defence to [[Thierry Henry]], which [[Rio Ferdinand]] intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidi<U+0107>. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it was just too high for the French striker, and referee [[Massimo Busacca]] took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.

====Second half====
[[File:021 men at work UEFA 2009, Rome.jpg|thumb|left|Thierry Henry takes on Rio Ferdinand in the Manchester United penalty area.]]
After bringing on [[Carlos T<U+00E9>vez]] in place of [[Anderson Lu<U+00ED>s de Abreu Oliveira|Anderson]] at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with T<U+00E9>vez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4-4-2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but <U+2013> unlike the first half <U+2013> it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta came away with the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar and ended up going out for a throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing [[Sylvinho]]; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught on the edge of the six-yard box by Van der Sar.

[[File:019 men at work UEFA 2009, Rome.jpg|thumb|Carlos T<U+00E9>vez fouls Andr<U+00E9>s Iniesta on the edge of the Manchester United penalty area.]]
Pressure high up the pitch from Barcelona kept Manchester United in their own half, forcing them into attempting long balls downfield. A scrappy few moments in and around the centre circle followed, but Manchester United eventually came away with the ball. However, a lapse in communication between Giggs and Evra on the left wing allowed Eto'o to steal in and advance on the Manchester United goal. He cut in from the right wing and played a through-ball just out of reach of Messi, who went to ground after O'Shea had put his hand on Messi's shoulder. A period of sustained pressure from Barcelona followed, culminating with a run from Iniesta, who could only be stopped by a foul from T<U+00E9>vez on the edge of the Manchester United penalty area. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who curled the ball around the defensive wall and onto the post with Van der Sar beaten.

[[File:Xavi al palo!.jpg|thumb|left|Xavi hits the free kick towards goal.]]
United responded with their first extended period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's first couple of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqu<U+00E9>. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Tour<U+00E9> kicked at thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59th&nbsp;minute <U+2013> despite appearing to be level with the last defender <U+2013> Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward stepped over the ball several times in an attempt to wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to slide the ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing a few moments later, but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqu<U+00E9>, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.

In the 66th&nbsp;minute, Alex Ferguson completed his attacking quartet by bringing [[Dimitar Berbatov]] on in place of Park.<ref name="minute_by_minute"/> Ronaldo was penalised for a high elbow when challenging for a header with Puyol a minute later before Rooney forced another corner off Piqu<U+00E9> in the 69th&nbsp;minute. However, United's numbers up front in search of another goal left them wanting in defence; a weak clearance from Van der Sar was cut out by Puyol who played the ball to Eto'o on the right side of the penalty area. The ball broke to Xavi on the edge of the area, who crossed for Messi to send a looping header over the United goalkeeper and into the far side of the goal for a two-goal lead. Immediately after the goal, Henry was replaced by [[Seydou Keita (footballer)|Seydou Keita]], allowing Barcelona to adopt a more defensive stance.<ref name="minute_by_minute"/>

United responded to the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was deflected to Ronaldo on the far side of the goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Vald<U+00E9>s. The resulting corner reached Berbatov on the far side of the goal, but it was deemed to have crossed the goal line first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached the goal line, he was fouled by Ronaldo, who <U+2013> despite going in two-footed <U+2013> escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.

Manchester United used their third and final substitute in the 75th&nbsp;minute, replacing Giggs with [[Paul Scholes]], who took over as team captain. Ronaldo and Scholes each received yellow cards in the 78th and 80th&nbsp;minutes, respectively; Ronaldo's yellow card was awarded for a robust shoulder-charge on Puyol as the Barcelona right back shepherded the ball out for a goal kick, while Scholes was booked for a late challenge on Busquets. While the referee played advantage after Scholes' foul, Iniesta cut inside from the left wing and hit a shot that was saved above the head of Van der Sar. An extended spell of Barcelona possession followed, as they strung a series of around 20 passes together, culminating with Puyol attempting to clip the ball over the onrushing Van der Sar, who blocked the shot. Both players went for the follow-up, but the Dutch goalkeeper was first to the ball and sent Puyol sprawling.<ref name="minute_by_minute"/>

In the 85th&nbsp;minute, Scholes clipped the ball over the top of the Barcelona defensive line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for T<U+00E9>vez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to T<U+00E9>vez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.

As the match entered its closing stages, the referee allotted a minimum of three&nbsp;minutes of injury time. The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, allowing Iniesta to steal in and play the ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidi<U+0107> to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock the ball out for a corner. Barcelona manager Josep Guardiola brought [[Pedro Rodr<U+00ED>guez Ledesma|Pedro Rodr<U+00ED>guez]] on for Iniesta in the second&nbsp;minute of added time, before Vidi<U+0107> was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash of heads with Messi when going for a header. That was to be the final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.<ref name="minute_by_minute"/>

====Trophy presentation====

At the final whistle, Barcelona manager [[Josep Guardiola]] offered his commiserations to each of Manchester United's players, while former Manchester United defender [[Gerard Piqu<U+00E9>]] fraternised with his erstwhile team-mates. Both teams then retreated to either end of the stadium to applaud their fans.

Despite there being no Italian or French representative in the final, the figures were much the same in those two countries as they were in Spain and the United Kingdom, with Italy's [[Rai Uno]] garnering an average viewership of 9.63&nbsp;million and France's [[TF1]] receiving 8.25&nbsp;million. Only 6.55&nbsp;million people watched the match on Germany's [[Sat.1]] channel.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Clarke |title=European soccer final wins TV prize |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004248.html?categoryid=3599&cs=1&nid=2565 |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2009 }}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, [[bookmaker]]s made a profit out of patriotic Britons placing bets on a Manchester United victory. [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]] reported two bets of around <U+00A3>20,000 placed on Manchester United, while [[Paddy Power]] received one of <U+00A3>5,500 and [[Ladbrokes]] one of <U+00A3>3,000. Ladbrokes also took a bet of <U+00A3>10,000 on a Barcelona win, but bookmakers reported that most of the money was put on Manchester United. Extrabet.com paid out <U+00A3>12,000 to a <U+00A3>3,000 bet on Samuel Eto'o to score the first goal at 4<U+2013>1.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Roebuck |title=Barcelona triumph keeps the bookies happy |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/may/28/champions-league-final-betting |work=guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2009 }}</ref>

==Rewards==
Both teams received significant financial rewards for reaching the Champions League final. However, despite losing the match, it was Manchester United who earned the most money from their 2008<U+2013>09 Champions League campaign, receiving [[Euro|<U+20AC>]]38.281&nbsp;million compared to Barcelona's <U+20AC>30.968&nbsp;million. All 32 teams in the group stage of the competition received <U+20AC>3&nbsp;million for taking part in the competition and <U+20AC>2.4&nbsp;million for their participation in the group stage matches, as well as further bonuses based on their performances in each match (<U+20AC>600,000 for each win and <U+20AC>300,000 for each draw). For their four wins and one draw, Barcelona received a performance bonus of <U+20AC>2.7&nbsp;million, while Manchester United earned <U+20AC>2.4&nbsp;million for their two wins and four draws. Both teams then also received a total of <U+20AC>7.7&nbsp;million for their participation in the rounds leading up to the final; however, Barcelona received a win bonus of <U+20AC>7&nbsp;million for winning the final, while Manchester United received <U+20AC>4&nbsp;million for finishing as runners-up. The biggest difference between the teams' financial rewards came as a result of their share of the market pool, based on the value of the television market in their home countries. As the most successful of the English teams in the competition, Manchester United received the greatest share (<U+20AC>18.781&nbsp;million) of approximately <U+20AC>55.5&nbsp;million reserved for the English teams. However, although Barcelona were the most successful of the Spanish teams in the competition, they had finished in third place in [[La Liga]] the [[La Liga 2007<U+2013>08|previous season]], and so received the second-smallest share of the <U+20AC>33.8&nbsp;million given to the four Spanish clubs, taking home <U+20AC>8.168&nbsp;million.<ref name="distribution"/>

In addition to receiving almost <U+20AC>31&nbsp;million in prize money, as winners of the UEFA Champions League, Barcelona competed in the [[2009 UEFA Super Cup]], in which they beat [[2008<U+2013>09 UEFA Cup]] winners [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] 1<U+2013>0 at [[Stade Louis II]] in [[Monaco]] on 28 August 2009,<ref name="super_cup"/> and in the [[2009 FIFA Club World Cup]] in [[Abu Dhabi]].<ref name="club_world_cup"/>
