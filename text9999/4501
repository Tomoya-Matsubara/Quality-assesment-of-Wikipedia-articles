The '''Petersen graph''' is a small [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] that serves as a useful example and counterexample in [[graph theory]].  The graph is named for [[Julius Petersen]], who published it in 1898.  Petersen constructed it to be the smallest bridgeless cubic graph with no three-edge-coloring.<ref>[http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/drg/graphs/Petersen.html The Petersen graph] by Andries E. Brouwer.</ref>  Although the graph is generally credited to Petersen, it had in fact first appeared 12 years earlier, in 1886.<ref>{{cite journal|author=A. B. Kempe|title=A memoir on the theory of mathematical form|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=177|pages=1&ndash;70|year=1886}}</ref>

== Properties ==
=== Basic properties ===

The Petersen graph ...

* is 3-connected and hence 3-edge-connected and bridgeless.  See the [[Glossary of graph theory#Connectivity|glossary]].
* has independence number 4 and is 3-partite.  See the [[Glossary of graph theory#Independence|glossary]].
* is [[cubic graph|cubic]], is [[strongly regular graph|strongly regular]], has domination number 3, and has a perfect matching and a 2-factor.  See the [[Glossary of graph theory#Adjacency and degree|glossary]].
* has [[radius (graph theory)|radius]] 2 and diameter 2.
* has [[chromatic number]] 3 and [[chromatic index]] 4, making it a [[snark (graph theory)|snark]].  (To see that there is no 3-edge-coloring requires checking four cases.)  It was the only known snark from 1898 until 1946.

=== Other properties ===

The Petersen graph ...

* is [[planar graph|nonplanar]].  It has as [[minor (graph theory)|minor]]s both the [[complete graph]] <math>K_5</math> (contract the five short edges in the first picture), and the [[complete bipartite graph]] <math>K_{3,3}</math>.
* has [[crossing number]] 2.
* can be embedded in the [[projective plane]] with six pentagonal faces.
* has a [[Hamiltonian path]] but no Hamiltonian cycle.
* is [[symmetric graph|symmetric]], meaning that it is [[edge-transitive graph|edge transitive]] and [[vertex-transitive graph|vertex transitive]].
* is one of only five known connected vertex transitive graphs with no Hamiltonian cycle.  It is conjectured that there are no others.
* is [[hypohamiltonian graph|hypohamiltonian]], meaning that although it has no Hamiltonian cycle, deleting any vertex makes it Hamiltonian.  See [[:Image:Petersen graph 2.svg|this embedding]] for a demonstration of the hypohamiltonian property.
* is one of only 14 cubic [[distance-regular graph]]s.<ref>According to [http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~gordon/remote/foster/#drgs Cubic symmetric graphs (The Foster Census)].</ref>
* is the [[complement graph|complement]] of the [[line graph]] of <math>K_5</math>.
* is a [[unit distance graph]], meaning it can be drawn in the plane with all the edges length 1.
* has [[automorphism group]] the [[symmetric group]] <math>S_5</math>.
* is the [[Kneser graph]] <math>KG_{5,2}</math>.  (This means you get the Petersen graph from the following construction: Take the 2-element subsets of a 5-element set as vertices, and connect two vertices if they are disjoint as sets.)
* is the graph formed by the vertices and edges of the [[hemi-dodecahedron]], that is, a [[dodecahedron]] with opposite points, lines and faces identified together.
* has [[graph spectrum]] &minus;2, &minus;2, &minus;2, &minus;2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3.
* has [[Thue number]] five

Every [[graph homomorphism|homomorphism]] of the Petersen graph to itself that doesn't identify adjacent vertices is an automorphism.

=== Largest and smallest ===

The Petersen graph ...
* is the smallest [[snark (graph theory)|snark]].
* is the smallest bridgeless cubic graph with no Hamiltonian cycle.
* is the smallest bridgeless cubic graph with no three-edge-coloring.
* is the largest cubic graph with diameter 2.
* is the smallest hypohamiltonian graph.
* is the smallest cubic graph of [[girth]] 5.  (It is the unique <math>(3,5)</math>-[[cage (graph theory)|cage]].  In fact, since it has only 10 vertices, it is the unique <math>(3,5)</math>-[[Moore graph]].)
* is the smallest connected vertex-transitive graph that is not a [[Cayley graph]]
* has 2000 [[Spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning tree]]s, the most of any 10-vertex cubic graph<ref>Jakobson and Rivin 1999; Valdes 1991. The cubic graphs with 6 and 8 vertices maximizing the number of spanning trees are [[M<U+00F6>bius ladder]]s.</ref>.

== As counterexample ==

The Petersen graph frequently arises as a counterexample or exception in graph theory.  For example, if ''G'' is a 2-connected, ''r''-regular graph with at most 3''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 vertices, then ''G'' is Hamiltonian or ''G'' is the Petersen graph.<ref>Holton and Sheehan, page 32</ref>

== Generalized Petersen graphs  ==

In 1969 [[Mark Watkins]] introduced a family of graphs generalizing the Petersen graph.  The '''generalized Petersen graph''' <math>G(n,k)</math> is a graph
with vertex set

: <math>\{u_0, u_1, \dots, u_{n-1}, v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{n-1}\}</math>

and edge set

: <math>\{u_i u_{i+1}, u_i v_i, v_i v_{i+k} : i=0,\dots,n-1\}</math>

where subscripts are to be read modulo <math>n</math> and <math>k < n/2</math>.

The Petersen graph itself is <math>G(5,2)</math>.

This family of graphs possesses a number of interesting properties. For example,
# <math>G(n,k)</math> is vertex-transitive if and only if <math>n = 10, k = 2</math> or <math>k^2 \equiv \pm 1 \pmod n</math>.
# It is edge-transitive only in the following seven cases: <math>(n,k) = (4,1), (5,2), (8,3), (10,2), (10,3), (12,5), (24,5) </math>.
# It is [[bipartite]] if and only if <math>n</math> is even and <math>k</math> is odd.
# It is a [[Cayley graph]] if and only if <math>k^2 \equiv 1 \pmod n</math>.

Among the generalized Petersen graphs are the ''n''-prism <math>G(n,1)</math>,
the [[D<U+00FC>rer graph]] <math>G(6,2)</math>, the [[M<U+00F6>bius-Kantor graph]] 
<math>G(8,3)</math>, the [[dodecahedron]] <math>G(10,2)</math>, and the [[Desargues graph]] <math>G(10,3)</math>.

The Petersen graph itself is the only generalized Petersen graph that is not 3-[[edge coloring|edge-colorable]]. [Castagna and Prins, 1972]

== Petersen graph family ==

The '''Petersen graph family''' consists of the seven graphs that can be formed from the [[complete graph]] <math>K_6</math> by zero or more applications of [[Y-<U+0394> transform|<U+0394>-Y or Y-<U+0394> transform]]s.  A graph is [[intrinsically linked graph|intrinsically linked]] if and only if it contains one of these graphs as a subgraph.
