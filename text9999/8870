'''Tropical Storm Edouard''' was the first of eight [[tropical cyclone]]s to develop in September of 2002, at the time the highest on record for any month.<ref name="sept2002sum">{{cite web|author=Avila, Beven, Pasch, Stewart, Franklin, and Stewart|year=2002|title=Summary of Tropical Cyclone Activity for September 2002|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/tws/MIATWSAT_sep.html}}</ref> The fifth tropical storm of the [[2002 Atlantic hurricane season]], Edouard developed into a tropical cyclone on [[September 1]] from an area of convection in association with a [[surface weather analysis|cold front]] to the east of [[Florida]]. Under weak steering currents, Edouard drifted to the north and executed a clockwise loop to the west. Despite moderate to strong levels of [[wind shear]], the storm reached a peak intensity of 55&nbsp;mph (90&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 3]], though quickly weakened as it tracked westward. Edouard made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on northeastern Florida on [[September 5]], and after crossing the state it dissipated on [[September 6]] while being absorbed into the larger circulation of [[Tropical Storm Fay (2002)|Tropical Storm Fay]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Tropical Storm Edouard dropped moderate rainfall across Florida, peaking at over 7&nbsp;inches (175&nbsp;mm) in the western portion of the state. Though it was a tropical storm at landfall, winds were light across the path of the storm over land. Several roads were flooded from moderate precipitation. No casualties were reported, and damage was minimal.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Edouard 2002 track.png}}
An area of cloudiness and rainshowers developed several hundred miles east-southeast of [[Bermuda]] on [[August 25]], likely in association with a low-level disturbance that formed along a [[Surface weather analysis|cold front]]. For several days, it moved southwestward, and, while located on the southwestern end of an upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] to the north of [[Puerto Rico]], deep convection throughout the system increased. The system tracked westward,<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Richard J. Pasch|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-12-10|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2002edouard.shtml}}</ref> and initially remained disorganized while surface pressures remained high.<ref name="aug28two">{{cite web|author=Beven & Cobb|year=2002|title=August 28 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-10|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2002/Aug/2002082902.ABNT20}}</ref> The system turned to a northwest drift, and began to slowly organize on [[August 30]] while located a few hundred miles northeast of the [[Bahamas]].<ref name="beven830">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2002|title=August 30 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-10|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2002/Aug/2002083021.ABNT20}}</ref>  A broad [[low pressure area]] developed on [[August 31]] though convection remained disorganized as winds of 20 to 25&nbsp;mph (32 to 40&nbsp;km/h) were reported in squalls. Conditions remained favorable for continued organization,<ref name="beven831">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2002|title=August 31 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-10|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2002/Aug/2002083121.ABNT20}}</ref> and convection increased and persisted across the system. The system developed into Tropical Depression Five on [[September 1]] after developing a low-level circulation while located about 140&nbsp;miles (225&nbsp;km) east of [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Upon first forming, the tropical depression was located in an area of light to moderate westerly [[wind shear]]. With a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to the north and west of the depression, the system moved to the northwest under weak steering currents.<ref name="stewart1">{{cite web|author=Stewart|year=2002|title=Tropical Depression Five Discussion|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-10|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/al052002.discus.001.html}}</ref> The depression slowly strengthened and intensified into Tropical Storm Edouard on [[September 2]] while located about 120&nbsp;miles (190&nbsp;km) east of [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. The storm remained disorganized with wind shear displacing most of the deep convection from the low-level circulation. Upon becoming a tropical storm, forecasters initially predicted Edouard to gradually turn to the northeast, and within three days be located a short distance off the coast of [[South Carolina]] with winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h). However, forecasters admitted little confidence in the prediction,<ref name="beven3">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Discussion Three|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/al052002.discus.003.html}}</ref> and later forecasts predicted the storm to execute a loop and track westward into northern Florida or southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Shortly after the [[tropical cyclogenesis]] of Edouard, steering currents became weak, resulting in the storm to turn sharply eastward.<ref name="tcr"/> Late on September 2 deep convection developed over the center,<ref name="franklin4">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Discussion Four|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/al052002.discus.004.html}}</ref> though the center quickly became exposed again.<ref name="franklin5">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Discussion Five|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/al052002.discus.005.html}}</ref> The environment appeared to become more hostile on September 2 and [[September 3|3]] with increasing shear and dry air overspreading the center.<ref name="tcr"/> Despite the conditions, the storm maintained vigorous convection over the eastern portion of the circulation, and it quickly intensified on September 3 to reach peak winds of 55&nbsp;mph (90&nbsp;km/h). A [[Hurricane Hunters|Reconaissance Aircraft]] flight into the system estimated surface winds of up to 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) and reported flight level winds of 82&nbsp;mph (132&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="franklin8">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Discussion Eight|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/al052002.discus.008.html}}</ref>

Shortly after peaking in intensity, Tropical Storm Edouard began to weaken as convection diminished from vertical shear and dry air, and later on [[September 3]] the center was exposed from the steadily decreasing convection. The development of a weak and narrow mid-level ridge turned the storm to the west-southwest towards northeastern Florida.<ref name="tcr"/> Despite strong levels of wind shear, Edouard remained a tropical storm while producing sporadic amounts of deep convection, and on [[September 4]] the [[rainbands|banding structure]] improved.<ref name="franklin12">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Discussion Twelve|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/al052002.discus.012.html}}</ref> Early on [[September 5]], Edouard made landfall near [[Ormond Beach, Florida]] as a minimal tropical storm, and almost immediately weakened to a tropical depression over land. It tracked across the state for about 13&nbsp;hours and entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] near [[Crystal River, Florida|Crystal River]].<ref name="tcr"/> Initial forecasts predicted Edouard to restrengthen to a tropical storm over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico,<ref name="franklin12"/> though uncertainty was noted due to the development of [[Tropical Storm Fay (2002)|Tropical Storm Fay]] in the northwestern portion of the gulf.<ref name="franklin13">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Discussoin Thirteen|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/al052002.discus.013.html}}</ref> Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, the depression encountered strong wind shear from the outflow of Tropical Storm Fay.<ref name="tcr"/> Edouard generated minimal amounts of intermittent convection along the southeastern portion of its circulation, enough for it to remain a [[tropical cyclone]].<ref name="franklin17">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2002|title=Tropical Depression Edouard Discussion Seventeen|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/al052002.discus.017.html}}</ref> By [[September 6]] the remaining convection dissipated, and Edouard dissipated while becoming absorbed into the larger circulation of Tropical Storm Fay.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
[[Image:Edouard090402pm.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Tropical Storm Edouard near landfall]]
Three hours after developing, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] from [[Titusville, Florida]] to [[Brunswick, Georgia]] due to uncertainty in the track of the storm. Hours after becoming a tropical storm, a tropical storm warning was issued from [[Fernandina Beach, Florida]] to the mouth of the [[Savannah River]], with a tropical storm watch further northward to the mouth of the [[Santee River|South Santee River]] in [[South Carolina]], though these were cancelled after Edouard turned to the east. About 10 hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued another tropical storm warning from Titusville, Florida to Brunswick, Georgia, with a tropical storm watch further south to [[Sebastian Inlet, Florida]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Two days before the storm made landfall, several [[List of counties in Florida|Florida counties]] were monitoring the progress of the storm. Though no serious impact was anticipated, [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]] officials identified possible shelters if warranted. [[Putnam County, Florida|Putnam County]] officials placed several shelters on standby, and utility crews in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] were placed on standby in the event of power failure. Several media releases of information were issued regarding the storm. The State Emergency Operation Center was on Level 2, or partial activation, and the state government organized two conferences to discuss county actions in regards to the storm.<ref name="sept02sitep">{{cite web|author=Florida State Emergency Response Team|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Situation Report|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.floridadisaster.org/eoc/eoc_Activations/Edouard_02/Sitrep_090302_1.PDF}}</ref> The [[National Weather Service]] issued a [[flood watch]] hours before Edouard made landfall for much of eastern Florida due to the expected rainfall from the storm.<ref name="sept04sitep">{{cite web|author=Florida State Emergency Response Team|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Situation Report 2|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.floridadisaster.org/eoc/eoc_Activations/Edouard_02/Sitrep_090402_2.PDF}}</ref>

The [[South Carolina]] Emergency Management Division monitored the progress of the storm, and the Division increased its awareness level in response to the storm. Important state agencies in South Carolina government were notified to be ready to respond if the need arose.<ref name="Scprep">{{cite web|author=Joe Farmer & John Legare|year=2002|title=SCEMD Monitors Tropical Storm Edouard|publisher=Emergency Managent Division of South Carolina|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://scemd.org/News/newsrel/2002nr/ed1.pdf}}</ref>

==Impact==
[[Image:Edouard2002rain.gif|right|thumb|300px|Rainfall summary for Edouard]]
In Bermuda, the outflow from the storm produced cloudy conditions throughout the island. Squally conditions were reported a short distance to the west of the island, though no rain was reported on Bermuda.<ref name="bm">{{cite web|author=Bermuda Weather Service|year=2002|title=Bermuda Weather for September 2002|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2002-09.html}}</ref>

While moving erratically off the east coast of Florida, Tropical Storm Edouard produced rough surf conditions and rip currents along many beaches. Beachgoers and visitors were advised to exercise extreme caution.<ref name="pro2">{{cite web|author=Mike Stone|year=2002|title=State Emergency Operations Center Continues to Monitor Tropical Storm Edouard|publisher=State of Florida Department of Community Affairs|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.floridadisaster.org/eoc/eoc_Activations/Edouard_02/PR02-15TSEdouard.pdf}}</ref> The storm produced water levels about 6 inches above normal near [[Cape Canaveral]], though elsewhere wave action and storm tides were not significant.<ref name="nws">{{cite web|author=Melbourne, Florida National Weather Service|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Edouard Post Tropical Cyclone Report|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/mlb/surveys/edouard02/edouard2002.html}}</ref> Despite being a tropical storm at landfall, sustained tropical storm force winds were not observed.

Moderate rainfall resulted in river flooding along the [[Saint Johns River]], resulting in flooding along roads in [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole County]]. Roadway, urban, and lowland flooding was also reported in [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard]] and [[Orange County, Florida|Orange counties]].

==Records & naming==
Both Edouard and Fay were in the Gulf of Mexico concurrently for 24&nbsp;hours on [[September 5]] and [[September 6|6]]. There are only two known times prior when there were two tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico; two tropical depressions existed on [[June 18]], [[1959 Atlantic hurricane season|1959]], and one depression and one hurricane existed on [[September 5]], [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933]]. Edouard and Fay existed the longest together out of the three.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurdat Data for Tropical Cyclones 1851-2005|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt}}</ref>

This storm was the fourth usage of the name '''Edouard''', the first having occurred in the [[1984 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Edouard|1984 season]]. Because damage was minimal, the name was not retired, and is on the list of names for the [[Post-2007 Atlantic hurricane seasons|2008 season]].<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurdat Data for Tropical Cyclones 1851-2005|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt}}</ref>
