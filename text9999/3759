'''Gustav Julius Werner Hartenstein''' (27 February 1908 <U+2013> 8 March 1943) was a ''[[Korvettenkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' with the [[Kriegsmarine]] during [[World War II]] and commander of {{GS|U-156|1941|2}}. He was also a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. He is credited with the sinking of 20 ships for a total of {{GRT|97504|metric=yes|first=yes}}, further damaging three ships of {{GRT|18811|metric=yes}} and damaging one warship of {{GRT|1190|metric=yes}}.

Hartenstein joined the [[Reichsmarine]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1928. After a period of training on surface vessels and service on various [[torpedo boat]]s, he transferred to the [[U-boat]] service in 1941. In September 1942, Hartenstein was involved in the [[Laconia incident|''Laconia'' incident]]. He and the entire crew of ''U-156'' were [[killed in action]] by depth charges from a US [[PBY Catalina]] aircraft on 8 March 1943.

==Early life and pre-war service==
Hartenstein was born in [[Plauen]] in the [[Vogtland]] of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] on 27 February 1908. He was the second child of William Karl Adolf Hartenstein, an export merchant, and Selma Emma Hartenstein, n<U+00E9>e Schlingensiepen.<ref>R<U+00F6>ll 2011, p. 72.</ref> Hartenstein had an older sister, Thea, and a younger sister, Charlotte. He celebrated his [[confirmation]] in 1923 and graduated from the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|''humanistische Staatsgymnasium'']] (humanities-oriented secondary school) in Plauen with his ''[[Abitur]]'' (diploma) in 1926. Prior to joining the military service studied two semesters of [[jurisprudence]]. He [[Matriculation|signed in]] at the ''Albert-Ludwigs-Universit<U+00E4>t Freiburg'' ([[University of Freiburg]]) in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] on 29 April 1927.<ref>R<U+00F6>ll 2011, pp. 51<U+2013>53, 72.</ref>

Aged 20, Hartenstein began his naval career with the [[Reichsmarine]] on 1 April 1928 as a member "Crew 1928" (the incoming class of 1928).{{#tag:ref|The German [[Reichsmarine]] which was renamed the [[Kriegsmarine]] on 1 June 1935.|group="Note"}} After he underwent basic military training in the 2nd department (II. ''Abteilung'') of the standing ship division (''Schiffsstammdivision'') of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Stralsund]] (1 April 1928 <U+2013> 30 June 1928), he was transferred to the [[training ship]] [[Niobe (schooner)|''Niobe'']] (1 July 1928 <U+2013> 15 October 1928) attaining the rank of ''[[Midshipman|Seekadett]]'' (Naval Cadet) on 11 October 1928. Following a fourteen month stay onboard [[German cruiser Emden|cruiser ''Emden'']] (16 October 1928 <U+2013> 3 January 1930) he advanced in rank to ''[[F<U+00E4>hnrich zur See]]'' (Ensign) on 1 January 1930. Hartenstein then underwent a number of officer training courses at the [[Naval Academy at M<U+00FC>rwik]], including navigational training cruises on the survey vessel [[Meteor (1915)|''Meteor'']], before transferring to the [[light cruiser]] [[German cruiser K<U+00F6>ln|''K<U+00F6>ln'']] (1 October 1931 <U+2013> 23 September 1934). His stay on ''K<U+00F6>ln'' was occasionally interrupted to attend further training courses at [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel]]-Wik.<ref>Busch and R<U+00F6>ll 2003, p. 257.</ref> 

Hartenstein served as I. ''Wachoffizier'' (1st watch officer) on torpedo boat ''Greif'' from 30 September 1936 to 13 November 1938.<ref name="Busch and R<U+00F6>ll p258">Busch and R<U+00F6>ll 2003, p. 258.</ref> Hartenstein was promoted to ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' (captain lieutenant) on 1 June 1937. He participated in numerous patrols in 1937 to 1938 on board ''Greif'' in Spanish waters as part of the "[[Legion Condor]]" during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. For these services he was awarded the [[Spanish Cross]] in Bronze ({{Lang|de|Spanienkreuz in Bronze}}) on 6 June 1936.<ref>R<U+00F6>ll 2011, p. 73.</ref>

==World War II==
Attached to commanding [[German torpedoboats of World War II|torpedo boats]] before the war, he completed 65 patrols in the [[North Sea]], Norwegian waters, [[Bay of Biscay]] and in the [[English Channel]] in the first period of the war.<ref name="R<U+00F6>ll p34">R<U+00F6>ll 2011, p. 34.</ref> Hartenstein took command of torpedo boat ''Seeadler'' on 20 November 1938. In October 1939 Hartenstein transferred and switched command of torpedo boat ''Jaguar'' with ''Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'' [[Franz Kohlauf]] who took over command of ''Seeadler''. On 30 March 1941, command of ''Jaguar'' was given to ''Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'' [[Friedrich-Karl Paul]] and Hartenstein transferred to the U-boat force, and on 4 September 1941 given command of ''U-156''. For his service on torpedo boats, Hartenstein was awarded the [[German Cross]] in Gold ({{Lang|de|''Deutsches Kreuz in Gold''}}) on 2 February 1942.<ref name="Busch and R<U+00F6>ll p258"/> On her second patrol Hartenstein commanded a wolf pack of U-boats during the [[Attack on Aruba]] in February 1942, attacking an [[oil refinery]]. [[Karl D<U+00F6>nitz]] personnally pinned the German Cross in Gold on Harteinstein's leather jacket on 17 March 1942.<ref name="R<U+00F6>ll p34"/>

===3rd patrol===
[[File:USS Blakeley ohne Bug.jpg|thumb|right|The heavily damaged USS ''Blakeley'']]
On Hartenstein's third patrol (22 April 1942 <U+2013> 7 July 1942), ''U-156'' sank twelve ships and damaged a further two, including the [[USS Blakeley (DD-150)|USS ''Blakeley'']] on 25 May 1942. This achievement earned Hartenstein a reference in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'' on 6 June 1942. The ''Wehrmachtbericht'' was an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. To be singled out individually in the ''Wehrmachtbericht'' was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations' section of one's Service Record Book.<ref>R<U+00F6>ll 2011, p. 67.</ref> 

''U-156'' positioned near [[Fort-de-France]] was ordered to observe the traffic to and from [[Martinique]]. Lying roughly {{Convert|11|nmi|km mi}} off shore, the hydrophones detected a ship. Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position firing two torpedoes. One torpedo struck the bow of the ''Blakeley'' after a 25-second run-time. Hartenstein observed that the bow was completely blown away but its engines kept running. The waters around Martinique were extremely shallow and Hartenstein decided not to pursue the destroyer.<ref>R<U+00F6>ll 2011, p. 46.</ref>

===4th patrol and ''Laconia'' incident===
[[File:U-156 37-35 Laconia 1942 09 15.jpg|left|thumb|''U-156'' (foreground) and [[German submarine U-507|''U-507'']] (background) on 15 September 1942]]
On ''U-156's'' fourth patrol (20 August 1942 <U+2013> 16 November 1942), Hartenstein organised the rescue of the survivors of [[RMS Laconia (1921)|RMS ''Laconia'']], resulting in the [[Laconia incident|''Laconia'' incident]] and [[Laconia Order|''Laconia'' order]].<ref name="R83"/>

On 12 September 1942 ''U-156'' was patrolling off the coast of [[West Africa]] midway between [[Liberia]] and [[Ascension Island]] roughly {{Convert|600|nmi|km mi}} south of [[Cape Palmas]]. At  11.37 the [[aft]] [[Port and starboard|port]] lookout sighted a smoke stack at 230 degrees. Hartenstein followed the target, which was zigzagging at {{Convert|14|kn|km/h mph}}, until the general direction of the large [[ocean liner]] became evident. ''U-156'' was running at {{Convert|17|kn|km/h mph}} into a favorable attack position. Hartenstein ordered the attack at 21.07. He lowered speed at 22.00 and ordered a surfaced [[Deflection (military)|deflection]] shot from torpedo tubes I and III. After three minutes and six seconds the first torpedo detonated followed shortly by the second.<ref name="R83">R<U+00F6>ll 2011, p. 83.</ref> He hoped to capture the ship's senior officers. To his surprise, Hartenstein saw over two thousand people struggling in the water. Hartenstein immediately began rescue operations. ''Laconia'' sank at 23:23.

At 6.00 Hartenstein ordered the following message send on the 25m wavelength:<ref name="R<U+00F6>ll p89">R<U+00F6>ll 2011, p. 89.</ref>

<blockquote>
"If any ship will assist the ship-wrecked Laconia crew, I will not attack providing I am not being attacked by ship or air forces. I picked up 193 men. 4<U+00B0>53 South/11<U+00B0>26 West <U+2013> German submarine"<ref name="R<U+00F6>ll p89"/>
</blockquote>

The message was repeated twice on the international 600m wavelength.<ref name="R<U+00F6>ll p89"/> Heading to a rendezvous with [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] ships under [[Red Cross]] banners, the U-boats were attacked by a [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army]] [[B-24 Liberator]] [[bomber]] at 12.32 on 16 September 1942.<ref>R<U+00F6>ll 2011, p. 115.</ref>

''U-156'' received a radio message on 17 September 1942 indicating that Werner Hartenstein, as 63rd member of the U-boat service and 125th of the Kriegsmarine, was awarded Germany's highest military honor, the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. Hartenstein handed out one bottle of beer for each member of the crew. Celebrating the event, Hartenstein held a speech, honoring the achievements of everyone and that he would wear this decoration in their name.<ref>R<U+00F6>ll 2011, p. 119.</ref>

===5th patrol and death===
During her fifth patrol, on 8 March 1943, Hartenstein and the entire crew of ''U-156'' were [[killed in action]] by depth charges from a US [[PBY Catalina]] aircraft (VP-53/P-1; Lieutenant E. Dryden), east of [[Barbados]]. The Catalina dropped four Mark 44 Torpex water-bombs at 13.15 from an altitude of {{Convert|75|ft|m}} to {{Convert|100|ft|m}} which straddled ''U-156''. Two bombs were observed to hit the water {{Convert|10|ft|m}} to {{Convert|15|ft|m}} starboard and just aft of ''U-156'', lifting it and breaking it in two, followed by an explosion. At least eleven survivors were seen swimming in the water. The Americans dropped two rubber rafts and rations and five men were seen to reach one the rafts. The [[USS Barney (DD-149)|USS ''Barney'']] was dispatched from [[Trinidad]] to rescue the survivors. The search was abandoned on 12 March 1943. ''[[Korvettenkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' [[Ernst Kals]], chief of the [[2nd U-boat Flotilla]] at [[Lorient]], sent a letter to Werner Hartenstein's parents on the 23 April 1943 indicating that their son is missing in action as of 12 March 1943. The US officials announced the destruction of the U-boat on 10 May 1943.<ref>R<U+00F6>ll 2011, pp. 135<U+2013>139.</ref>
