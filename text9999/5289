Arcadiopolis) in [[Turkey]] between the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Bulgarians]] were victorious.

== Origins of the conflict ==

After the major Bulgarian success in the [[battle of Tryavna]] in 1190 their troops launched frequent attacks on [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to liberate all Bulgarian lands. The Byzantines could not face the fast Bulgarian cavalry which attacked from different directions on a vast area. Towards 1194 [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen I]] had taken the important city of [[Sofia]] and the surrounding areas as well as the upper valley of the [[Struma River]] from where his armies advanced deep into Macedonia.<ref>Nicetas Choniates. Historia, p. 573</ref>

== The battle ==

To distract his attention the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] decided to strike in eastern direction. They assembled the Eastern army under its commander [[Alexios Gidos]] and the Western army under its [[Domestic of the Schools|Domestic]] [[Basil Vatatzes]] to stop the dangerous rise of Bulgarian power. Near Arcadiopolis in Eastern Thrace they met the Bulgarian army. After a fierce battle the Byzantine armies were annihilated. Most of Gidos's troops perished and he had to flee for his life, while the Western army was fully slaughtered and Basil Vatatzes was killed on the battlefield.

== Aftermath ==

After the defeat [[Isaac II Angelos]] had to plea the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] King [[B<U+00E9>la III of Hungary|Bela III]] for help. Byzantium had to attack from the south and [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Hungary]] was to invade the north-western Bulgarian lands and take [[Belgrade]], Branichevo and eventually [[Vidin]] but the plan failed. In March 1195 Isaac II managed to organize a campaign against Bulgaria<ref>Nicetas Choniates. Historia, p. 587-589</ref> but he was deposed by his brother [[Alexios III Angelos]] and that campaign failed as well. In the next year the Byzantines were defeated in the [[battle of Serres]].
