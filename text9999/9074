The '''Arenal Volcano''', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|'''Volc<U+00E1>n Arenal'''}}, is an active [[andesite|andesitic]] [[stratovolcano]] in north-western [[Costa Rica]] (10.5N, 84.7W), about 90 [[kilometre|km]] north-west of [[San Jos<U+00E9>, Costa Rica|San Jos<U+00E9>]], in the province of [[Alajuela Province|Alajuela]]. Recognised as a volcano since the 19th century, it was known by foreign investigators as "Volcan Costa Rica, Rio Frio", "Canastos" Volcano and "Cerro de los Guatusos". The area remained largely unexplored until [[1937]], when a documented expedition took place to reach the summit. 

Once locally known as {{lang|es|Cerro Arenal}} (i.e. Mount Arenal) it was presumed extinct until [[July 29]], [[1968]] when it erupted after approximately 400 years of dormancy.  The eruption wiped out the town of Arenal and killed 87 people [http://www.arenal.net/arenal-volcano-1968-eruption.htm].  It has been in continuous eruption since then.

Arenal rises 1657 [[metre]]s above [[sea level]] and overlooks [[Lake Arenal]]; both are part of [[Arenal Volcano National Park]]. The country's most active volcano, Arenal's eruptions are [[strombolian]] in type, being frequent but moderate. This constant activity makes Arenal a popular tourist destination, especially at night ([[:Image:Arenal volcano night.jpg|See image]]). The last major eruption of Arenal occurred on [[August 23]], [[2000]].  Most of the time, the volcano is surrounded by clouds near the tip, and it is touted as good luck to see the whole volcano without clouds.  The volcano heats several [[hot springs]] nearby, including [[Tabacon]], a popular tourist destination.

This is one of seven historically active Costa Rican volcanoes: [[Po<U+00E1>s Volcano|Po<U+00E1>s]], [[Iraz<U+00FA> Volcano|Iraz<U+00FA>]], [[Miravalles Volcano|Miravalles]], [[Oros<U+00ED> Volcano|Oros<U+00ED>]], [[Rinc<U+00F3>n de la Vieja Volcano|Rinc<U+00F3>n de la Vieja]] [complex], and [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]].
