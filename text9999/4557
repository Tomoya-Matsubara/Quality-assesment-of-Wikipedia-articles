In March 2007, Santorum joined the law firm Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott, LLC. He was to primarily practice law in the firm<U+2019>s Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C., offices, where he was to provide business and strategic counseling services to the firm's clients.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Santorum was born in Winchester, [[Virginia]], and raised in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia]], and [[Butler County, Pennsylvania]]. He is the son of Aldo Santorum (born 1923) and Catherine Keane (n<U+00E9>e Dughi; born 1918). His father was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]], and his mother was of half Italian and half Irish descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/senators/santorum.htm |title=Santorum genealogy |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}</ref><ref name="offbio">{{cite web|url=http://santorum.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=AboutRickSantorum.Biography&CFID=11631531&CFTOKEN=17630065|title=The Senator's Biography|work=Santorum's Senate website|accessdate=December 30, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061230084254/http://santorum.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=AboutRickSantorum.Biography&CFID=11631531&CFTOKEN=17630065 |archivedate=December 30, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-BcYAQAAMAAJ&q=Catherine+%22Keane+%22+%22Dughi+%22&dq=Catherine+%22Keane+%22+%22Dughi+%22&hl=en |title=The Pennsylvania manual - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref><ref>http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dGwyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PrUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1572,4682192&dq=rick-santorum+italian+irish&hl=en</ref>

Both of Santorum's parents worked at the [[Veterans Administration|Veterans<U+2019> Administration]] (VA) Hospital in [[Butler, Pennsylvania|Butler]], and the family lived on the VA hospital post. His father became licensed as a psychologist in August 1974. He attended schools in the [[Butler Area School District]],<ref>Butler Senior High School classbook, "The Magnet", 1975</ref> where he gained the nickname <U+201C>Rooster<U+201D>, allegedly because he "always had a few errant hairs on the back of his head that refused to stay down", and he was "noisy, showy, dogged and determined like a rooster and never backed down".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060616/16santorum.htm |title=Nation & World: 20 things about Rick Santorum <U+2013> US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=May 10, 1958 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}</ref>

Santorum graduated from [[Carmel High School (Mundelein, Illinois)|Carmel High School]] in [[Mundelein, Illinois]], in 1976,<ref>{{cite news|author=Tony Scifo|work=Daily Herald|title=Carmel's political alumni return for chat with students Carmel High School|date=November 5, 1996}}</ref> where his father transferred within the VA hospital system. He lists his residency as [[Penn Hills, Pennsylvania]], and maintains a home in [[Leesburg, Virginia]], for his work in Washington, D.C.

Santorum earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]], having majored in [[Political Science]], from The [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1980, and a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1981. He is a member of [[Tau Epsilon Phi]] fraternity.

In 1986, Santorum earned a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) from the [[The Pennsylvania State University <U+2013> Dickinson School of Law|Dickinson School of Law]], was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar, and began practicing law in [[Pittsburgh]]. While working at the [[law firm]] of [[Kirkpatrick & Lockhart]], he represented the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], arguing that [[professional wrestling]] should be exempt from federal [[anabolic steroid]] regulations because it was not a sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citypaper.net/articles/2005-09-29/cover.shtml|title=The Path of the Righteous Man: How Rick Santorum became the nation's evangelical poster boy|author=Mike Newall|publisher=Philadelphia citypaper.net|date=September 29, 2005|accessdate=August 23, 2006}}</ref> Santorum left private practice after first being elected to the House in November 1990.

==Family==
Santorum and his wife, Karen Garver Santorum, have seven children: Elizabeth Anne (born 1991); Richard John ("Johnny"), Jr. (born 1993); Daniel James (born 1995); Sarah Maria (born 1998); Peter Kenneth (born 1999); Patrick Francis (born 2001); and Isabella "Bella" Maria (born 2008). Bella was subsequently diagnosed with [[Trisomy 18]], a serious genetic disorder which is fatal before birth in 90 per cent of cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/politics/story.php?id=34416|title=Senator Rick Santorum Pondering a Run for the U.S. Presidency|author=John-Henry Westen|publisher=LifeSiteNews.com|date=September 13, 2009|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}</ref> In 1996, their son Gabriel Michael was born prematurely and lived for only two hours (a [[Medical ultrasonography|sonogram]] taken before Gabriel was born revealed that his posterior urethral valve was closed and that the prognosis for his survival was therefore poor). While pregnant, Karen Santorum developed a life-threatening intrauterine infection and a fever that reached nearly 105 degrees. She went into labor when she was 20 weeks pregnant and allowed doctors to give her [[Oxytocin]] to speed the birth.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/magazine/22SANTORUM.html?pagewanted=1|title=The Believer|date=May 22, 2005|accessdate=June 13, 2011|work=The New York Times|first=Michael|last=Sokolove}}</ref>

Karen Santorum wrote a book about the experience: ''Letters to Gabriel: The True Story of Gabriel Michael Santorum''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Letters to Gabriel|author=Karen Garver Santorum|year=1998|publisher=CCC of America|isbn=1-56814-528-4}}</ref> In it, she writes that the couple brought the deceased infant home from the hospital and introduced the dead child to their living children as "your brother Gabriel" and slept with the body overnight before returning it to the hospital.

Santorum and his family usually attend [[Latin Mass]] at [[Saint Catherine of Siena]] Church, near Washington, D.C. On November 12, 2004, Santorum and his wife were invested as Knight and Dame of Magistral Grace of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Knights of Malta]] in a ceremony at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maltausa.org/files/newsletter_hospitallers_04.pdf|format=PDF|title=HOSPITALLERS|publisher=Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and Malta|work=Volume 1|date=Winter 2004/2005|accessdate=August 25, 2006}}</ref>

==Political career==
[[File:Rick Santorum official photo.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Santorum served in the [[United States Senate]] representing Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007.]]
Santorum first became actively involved in politics through volunteering for the late Senator [[H. John Heinz III|John Heinz]].

After earning his Juris Doctor, Santorum became an administrative assistant to Republican State Senator [[Doyle Corman]] (until 1986). He was director of the Pennsylvanian Senate's local government committee from 1981 to 1984, then director of the Pennsylvanian Senate's Transportation Committee until 1986.

In 1990, at age 32, Santorum was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Pennsylvania's 18th District]], located in the eastern suburbs of [[Pittsburgh]]. He scored a significant upset, defeating a seven-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent, [[Doug Walgren]]. Although the 18th was heavily Democratic, Santorum attacked Walgren for living outside the district for most of the year. He was re-elected in 1992, in part because the district lost its share of Pittsburgh as a result of redistricting. In Congress, as a member of the [[Gang of Seven]], Santorum worked to expose congressional corruption by naming the guilty parties in the [[House banking scandal]].

[[Image:SantroumBarn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A barn painted with Santorum's logo and slogan. The barn was used in a 1994 political advertisement.]]
In 1994, at the age of 36, Santorum was [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 1994|elected to the U.S. Senate]], defeating the incumbent Democrat, [[Harris Wofford]], who was 32 years older. The theme of Santorum's 1994 campaign signs was "Join the Fight!"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Santorum was [[U.S. Senate election, 2000|re-elected]] in 2000 defeating Congressman [[Ron Klink]] by a 52.4% to 45.5% margin.

In 1996 he endorsed [[Arlen Specter]] for president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=13494 |title=Our Campaigns <U+2013> US President <U+2013> R Primaries Race <U+2013> Jul 7, 1996 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref>

In a 2002 [[PoliticsPA]] [[feature story]] designating politicians with [[Yearbook|yearbook superlatives]], he was named the "Most Ambitious".<ref name=yearbook>{{cite web| title =Keystone State Yearbook Committee| work=[[PoliticsPA]]| publisher=The Publius Group | year = 2001| url = http://www.politicspa.com/yearbookcommittee.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020803170058/www.politicspa.com/yearbookcommittee.htm|archivedate=August 31, 2002}}</ref>

As chairman of the [[Senate Republican Conference]], Santorum directed the communications operations of Senate Republicans and was a frequent party spokesperson. He was the youngest member of the Senate leadership and the first Pennsylvanian to hold such a prominent position since Senator [[Hugh Scott]] was Republican leader in the 1970s. In addition, Santorum served on the Senate Agriculture Committee; the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; the Senate Special Committee on Aging; and the [[Senate Finance Committee]], of which he was the chairman of the Subcommittee on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and Family Policy.

In January 2005, Santorum announced his intention to run for [[United States Senate Republican Whip]], the second-highest post in the Republican caucus after the [[Pennsylvania United States Senate election, 2006|2006 election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05026/448138.stm|title=Santorum focusing on re-election to Senate, not White House run|author=Maeve Reston|work=post-gazette.com|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=January 26, 2005}}</ref> The move came because it was presumed the incumbent whip, [[Mitch McConnell]] of [[Kentucky]], was viewed as having the inside track to succeeding [[Bill Frist]] of [[Tennessee]] as Senate Republican leader.

During the lame-duck session of the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]], Santorum was one of only two senators who voted against [[Robert Gates]] to become Secretary of Defense. He opposed Gates' advocacy of engaging [[Iran]] and [[Syria]] to solve the problem, saying that talking to "radical Islam" would be an error.

During his third term re-election campaign for his Senate seat against [[Bob Casey, Jr.]], Santorum introduced the term "Islamic fascism", while questioning "his opponent's ability to make the right decisions on national security at a time when 'our enemies are fully committed to our destruction.'"<ref>"Santorum: Casey lacking on security" http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06300/733425-177.stm</ref>

Santorum sat at the Senate's [[candy desk]] for ten years and kept it stocked with [[The Hershey Company|Hershey<U+2019>s chocolates]], [[Peanut Chews]] and [[Hot Tamales]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Joyner|first=James|title=Santorum Ouster Means End of Senate Candy Desk|url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/santorum_ouster_means_end_of_senate_candy_desk/|newspaper=Outside the Beltway|date=January 5, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Toeplitz|first=Shira|title=Mark Kirk: Senate candy man|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrush/0211/Mark_Kirk_Senate_candy_man.html|newspaper=Politico|date=February 13, 2011}}</ref>

Santorum was defeated 59% to 41% in the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|2006 U.S. Senate election]] by Democratic candidate Bob Casey, Jr. This was the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent Senator since [[United States Senate election in South Dakota, 1980|1980]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In September 2005, Santorum gave a speech that outlined the successes and failures<U+2014>but more centrally the future<U+2014>of conservatism, at the [[Heritage Foundation]]'s First International Conservative Conference on Social Justice. In November 2005, he adapted his speech into an [[Editorial|op-ed]] piece for the political website [[Townhall.com]] outlining his vision for "[[Compassionate Conservatism]]".

{{quote|What I call "Compassionate Conservatism" has something unique to offer to the shaping of our future.

The [[Associated Press]] reported that on July 20, 2006, Santorum stated that "Islamic fascism rooted in Iran is behind much of the world's conflict, but he is opposed to military action against the country", in a speech where he "also defended the treatment of prisoners in [[Guantanamo Bay]]."<ref name=Helf>"Santorum says Iran at center of world's conflict" By Kimberly Hefling, The Associated Press. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06202/707588-177.stm</ref> The senator indicated that "effective action against Iran" would require America's fighting "for a strong Lebanon, a strong Israel, and a strong Iraq."<ref name=Helf/>

On September 7, 2006, Santorum outlined his views on foreign policy in an [[Editorial|op-ed]] piece for the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' and discussed Islamic fascism, closing with a rally cry:

{{quote|<U+201C>I believe we are at war with Islamic fascists and I singled out Iran and Syria as examples of Islamic fascist regimes. Many Muslims say the same thing, and the editors should, too, for it is undeniable. [...]

I have said time and time again across Pennsylvania these past weeks that the fight against Islamic fascism is the great test of our generation. Leaders are obliged to articulate this threat and to propose what is necessary to defeat it. That is my purpose, and our national calling. The American people have always rallied to the cause of freedom once they understood what was at stake. I have no doubt that they will again.<U+201D>|Rick Santorum<ref>In Rebuttal: Islamic fascists vs. Islam itself" by Rick Santorum, September 7, 2006. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06250/719619-109.stm, in response to In response to the Sept. 1 Post-Gazette editorial "Loose Talk: The Bush Rhetoric on Iraq Is Sounding Desperate"</ref><U+201D>}}

Santorum has referred to his grandfather's historical encounter with Italian fascism as an inspiration for his 2012 presidential campaign.<ref>Ward, Jon.

==Legislation and issues==
Santorum has attracted support and criticism because of his [[socially conservative]] and strong views, including his views on [[same-sex marriage]], homosexuality, and [[abortion]]. His views are presented in his 2005 book, ''[[It Takes a Family]]'', published by the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]] of [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], Delaware.

Santorum has been active in addressing the issues of welfare reform and government accountability. He is a self-described conservative who favors restricting or prohibiting [[abortion]]. Santorum has said he is personally against abortion and has expressed disapproval of homosexuality, issues that he believes should be decided by elected officials rather than the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]: <U+201C>what I<U+2019>d like to do is have these kinds of incredibly important moral issues be decided by the American public, not by nine unelected, unaccountable judges.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|title=George Stephanopoulos Interviews Sen.

===Illegal immigration===
In 2006, Santorum opposed the Senate immigration reform proposal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Banville|first=Lee|title=Still Trailing in Polls, Santorum Hammers on Illegal Immigration|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/politics/july dec06/santorum_08-01.html|work=Online NewsHour|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|date=August 1, 2006|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}</ref> Instead, Santorum stated that the U.S. should act to enforce currently existing laws. He has openly stated his strong opposition to amnesty for undocumented immigrants. He supports the construction of a barrier along the U.S.<U+2013>Mexican border, an increase in the number of border patrol agents on the border, and the stationing of National Guard troops along the border. He also believes that undocumented immigrants should be deported immediately when they commit crimes, and that undocumented immigrants should not receive benefits from the government. Finally, the former senator believes that English should be established as the national language in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ricksantorum.com/Issues/Read.aspx?ID=6|title=On the Issues|publisher=RickSantorum.com|accessdate=August 23, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060711215552/http://www.ricksantorum.com/Issues/Read.aspx?ID=6 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 11, 2006}}</ref>

===Intelligent design===
{{Main|Santorum Amendment}}
In 2001, Santorum tried unsuccessfully to insert language which came to be known as the "[[Santorum Amendment]]" into the [[No Child Left Behind]] bill that sought to promote the teaching of [[intelligent design]] while questioning the academic standing of [[evolution]] in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].<ref name="wapostslevin">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html|title=Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens|author=Peter Slevin|work=Washington Post|date=March 14, 2005}}</ref> The amendment, crafted with the assistance of the [[Discovery Institute]],<ref name="wapostslevin" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumniweb.oru.edu/oru%20alumni/right106.html|title=We'd Like Some Answers Origin of man, universe continues to cause debate|work=Alumni News Stories|publisher=[[Oral Roberts University]] Alumni Foundation|accessdate=August 23, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060502050713/http://alumniweb.oru.edu/oru+alumni/right106.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 2, 2006}}</ref> would have required schools to discuss possible controversies surrounding scientific topics, and gave the theory of evolution as an example, opening the door for intelligent design as an opposing theory to be presented in science classrooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issues.org/issues/18.3/hill.html#Language|title=Language on evolution attached to education law|work=Issues in Science and Technology|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|date=Spring 2002|accessdate=August 23, 2006}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> A federal court in Santorum's own state, along with the majority of scientific organizations, including the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], say the Institute has manufactured the controversy they want to teach by promoting a false perception that evolution is "a theory in crisis", portraying it as being the subject of wide controversy and debate within the scientific community.<ref name="kitzmiller_pg89">"ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the ''controversy'', but not ID itself, should be taught in science class.

===Workplace Religious Freedom Act===
Santorum and U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]], ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Massachusetts|MA]]), were the lead sponsors of the [[Workplace Religious Freedom Act]] (WRFA), which would require employers to accommodate the religious observances of their employees as long as such accommodations would not impose an "undue hardship" on the employer. Thus, employers would be required to afford employees flexible work shifts so that they could observe religious holidays and to permit employees to wear religiously required clothing at work. Versions of the WRFA have been introduced in 1997, 2000, and 2003, but have failed to be enacted.

===National Weather Service===
{{Main|National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005}}

On April 14, 2005, Santorum introduced the [[National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005]] to "clarify the duties and responsibilities of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS), and for other purposes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.786:|title=National Weather Services Duties Act of 2005 (Introduced in Senate)|accessdate=August 23, 2006}}</ref> This legislation, if enacted, would prohibit the NWS from publishing weather data to the public when private-sector entities, such as [[AccuWeather]], a company based in Santorum's home state, perform the same function commercially. Accuweather employees have contributed at least $5500 to Santorum since 1999, according to the Federal Election Commission.<ref name="20mostcorrupt">{{cite web |url= http://www.beyonddelay.org/summaries/santorum.php|title= Sen.

Opponents of this bill contend{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} that weather data is collected at taxpayer expense, and therefore it should be made freely available to the public, and not provided solely to private corporations that will charge fees for access. They also claim that the vague language in the bill is an attempt to prevent the NWS from issuing free forecasts because such functions are currently provided by the private sector and would be considered competition.

The bill was never enacted or voted upon, dying in committee.

===Statements regarding homosexuality===
{{Main|Santorum controversy regarding homosexuality|Campaign for "santorum" neologism}}
A controversy arose following Santorum's statements about homosexuality in an interview with the [[Associated Press]] that was published on April&nbsp;20, 2003. In response to a question about how to prevent [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse of children]] by priests, Santorum said the priests were engaged in "a basic homosexual relationship", and went on to say that he had "[...] no problem with homosexuality. I have a problem with homosexual acts"; that the right to privacy, as detailed in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]],'' "doesn't exist in my opinion in the [[United States Constitution]]"; that, "whether it's [[polygamy]], whether it's adultery, whether it's [[sodomy]], all of those things are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family"; and that [[sodomy law]]s properly exist to prevent acts that "undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family". When the Associated Press reporter asked whether homosexuals should not then engage in homosexual acts, Santorum replied, "Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that's what? Children. Monogamous relationships. In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality".<ref name="usa today">{{cite news|title=Excerpt from Santorum interview|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|date=April 23, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}</ref>

When questioned for his remarks, Santorum stated that they were intended not to equate homosexuality with [[incest]] and [[pedophilia]], but rather as a critique of the specific legal position that the right to privacy prevents the government from regulating consensual acts among adults (such as [[bigamy]], incest, etc.).

In protest of the remarks, syndicated columnist [[Dan Savage]] launched a contest among his readers in May 2003 to coin a new word "santorum" with an unflattering sexual definition, and followed this with a Google bombing campaign to spread the new term. Since 2004, Savage's [[Google bomb]] has regularly been the top search result for Santorum's surname, leading to what commentators have dubbed [[Campaign for "santorum" neologism|"Santorum's Google problem"]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rovzar |first=Chris |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/09/does_rick_santorum_really_have.html |title=Does Rick Santorum Really Have a Google Problem? |publisher=NYmag.com Daily Intel |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name="rollcall">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_84/-203455-1.html |title=Santorum Talks About Longtime Google Problem |publisher=Roll Call |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Santorum has characterized the campaign as a "type of vulgarity" common on the Internet.<ref name="rollcall"/> In an interview with [[Politico]] on September 20, 2011, Santorum stated that he had contacted Google directly, asking for the removal of search results with the unflattering term.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burns |first=Alexander |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/63952.html |title=Rick Santorum contacted Google, says company spreads 'filth'|publisher=Politico |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}</ref>

During the presidential debate held August 11, 2011, in [[Ames]], [[Iowa]], Santorum stated that the Iranian regime "tramples the rights of gays", suggesting that he opposes bias against gays as part of his general support for [[1953 Iranian coup d'<U+00E9>tat|past U.S.-backed intervention]] in domestic Iranian politics.<ref>http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/08/paul-and-santorum-battle-over-iran.php</ref><ref>http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/08/11/294431/santorum-iran-tramples-the-rights-of-gays/</ref>

===Comments about the Boston Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal===
In 2005, a controversy developed over comments about [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Massachusetts, that Santorum made in a 2002 article about the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal]]. Santorum wrote:
{{quote|It is startling that those in the media and academia appear most disturbed by this aberrant behavior, since they have zealously promoted [[moral relativism]] by sanctioning "private" moral matters such as alternative lifestyles. Priests, like all of us, are affected by culture. When the culture is sick, every element in it becomes infected. While it is no excuse for this scandal, it is no surprise that Boston, a seat of academic, political and cultural [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] in America, lies at the center of the storm.|Rick Santorum<ref>{{cite web|title=Fishers of Men|url=http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=30|author=Rick Santorum|publisher=Catholic Online|date=July 12, 2002|accessdate=August 23, 2006}}</ref>}}

These comments came to wider attention through an opinion column in the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' on June 24, 2005. Columnist [[John Baer]] cited Santorum's article, stating, "I'd remind you this is the same Senate leader who recently likened Democrats fighting to save the [[filibuster]] to [[Reducto ad Hitlerum|Nazis]]."<ref>{{cite news|title=A look into Santorum's brain|author=[[John Baer]]|publisher=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|date=June 24, 2005}}</ref>

Santorum's remarks were criticized, especially in [[Massachusetts]]. On July 12, 2005, ''[[Boston Globe]]'' columnist Brian McGrory called on Santorum to explain his statement, and reported that Robert Traynham, Santorum's Director of Communications, told him "It's an open secret that you have [[Harvard University]] and [[MIT]] that tend to tilt to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] in terms of academic biases. I think that's what the senator was speaking to." Julie Teer, a spokeswoman for Governor of Massachusetts, Republican [[Mitt Romney]], said "What happened with the church sex abuse scandal was a tragedy, but it had nothing to do with geography or the culture of Boston."

Later that day, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (D-Massachusetts) delivered a personal rebuke to Santorum on the Senate floor, saying "The people of Boston are to blame for the clergy sexual abuse? That is an irresponsible, insensitive and inexcusable thing to say."<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennedy rips Santorum comments: Says senator owes victims apology|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/07/14/kennedy_rips_santorum_comments/|author=Susan Milligan|work=Boston Globe|date=July 14, 2005}}</ref> Santorum has stood by his 2002 article and has not apologized.

On July 21, 2005, [[Rush Limbaugh]] interviewed Santorum about Kennedy's speech. Santorum said that he was being targeted by the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]], which, he said, coordinated with the media to publicize Kennedy's speech. He argued that his statement about Boston was taken out of context from an article he had written three years earlier. Santorum agreed with Limbaugh's summary that it was "no surprise that the center of the Catholic Church abuse took place in very liberal, or perhaps the nation's most liberal area, Boston." Santorum reiterated his broader theme of a cultural connection, saying that it is "no surprise that the culture affects people's behavior. [...] the liberal culture<U+2014>the idea that [...] sexual inhibitions should be put aside and people should be able to do whatever they want to do, has an impact on people and how they behave." When asked why Boston specifically was mentioned, Santorum pointed out that, in July 2002, the outrage of American Catholics, as well as his own, was focused on the [[Archdiocese of Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/eibessential/eib_interviews/senator_rick_santorum_.guest.html|title=Senator Rick Santorum (Interview)|publisher=RushLimbaugh.com|date=July 21, 2005|accessdate=August 23, 2006}}</ref>

===Hurricane Katrina===
On September 4, 2005, Santorum spoke to a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] television station, [[WTAE-TV|WTAE]], about the evacuation warnings given for [[Hurricane Katrina]]:

On September 6, in a follow-up interview with WTAE, Santorum said,

On September 8, during an interview with [[public radio|public-radio]] station [[WITF-FM]], in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], Pennsylvania, Santorum said

Santorum was the sponsor of legislation proposed to ''prevent'' the National Weather Service from issuing those warnings, thus competing with [[private sector|private-sector]] weather services, as discussed [[Rick Santorum#Legislation and issues|above]].

Santorum added a [[synthetic fuel|synthetic-fuel]] tax-credit amendment to a larger bill introduced in the Senate by [[Charles Grassley]], the [[Iowa]] Republican who headed the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]]. ''[[Time Magazine]]'' called this tax-credit scheme "a multibillion-dollar [[scam]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1167738,00.html|title=A Magic Way to Make Billions|author=Donald L.

===Pennsylvania residency and tuition fee===
In November 2004, a controversy developed over education costs for Santorum's children. Santorum's legal address is a three-bedroom house in [[Penn Hills, Pennsylvania|Penn Hills]], Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, which he purchased for $87,800 in 1997 and is located next to the home of his wife's parents. But since 2001, he has spent most of the year in [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]], Virginia, a town about one hour's drive west of Washington, D.C., and about 90 minutes' drive south of the Pennsylvania border, in a house he purchased for $643,000. The ''Penn Hills Progress'', a local paper, reported that Santorum and his wife paid about $2,000 per year in property taxes on their Pennsylvania home ($487.20 per year to Allegheny County, 2006 through 2008, based on a 2007 value of $106,000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.county.allegheny.pa.us/RealEstate/Search.asp |title=Allegheny County Assessment |publisher=.county.allegheny.pa.us |date=January 1, 2002 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}</ref> plus Penn Hills School District tax). The paper also found that another couple<U+2014>possibly renters<U+2014>were registered voters at the same address.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yourpennhills.com/pennhillsprogress/article/more-questions-raised-about-santorum-residency|title=More questions raised about Santorum residency|author=Vera Miller|date=November 17, 2004|publisher=[[Gateway Newspapers]]}}</ref>

At the time the issue arose, Santorum's five older children attended the [[Western Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpccs.com/ |title=The Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School <U+2013> PA Cyber |publisher=Wpccs.com |accessdate=June 18, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> with 80 percent of tuition costs paid by the Penn Hills School District.<ref>{{citenews | first=Daniel | last=Reynolds | title= Santorum school flap continues |date=November 19, 2004 | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_274635.html | work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | accessdate =April 25, 2007 }}</ref> At a meeting in November 2004, the Penn Hills School District announced that it did not believe Santorum met the qualifications for residency status, because he and his family spent most of the year in Virginia. They demanded repayment of tuition costs totaling $67,000.

When news reports showed Sen. Santorum was renting his Penn Hills home, Santorum withdrew his five children from the cyber education program that Penn Hills School District paid for. That saved Penn Hills taxpayers about $38,000 a year.<ref>Editorial: Home school / Santorum, not the state, should pay Penn Hills. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 11, 2006. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06254/720366-192.stm</ref> Although Santorum said he would make other arrangements for his children's education, he insisted that he did not owe the school board any back tuition. Once the controversy surfaced, the children were withdrawn from the cyber school and were then home schooled.<ref>Santorum tuition OK'd, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 13, 2006. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06256/721451-56.stm</ref>

On July 8, 2005, a Pennsylvania state hearing officer had ruled that the Penn Hills School District had not filed objections to Santorum's residency in a timely manner and dismissed the complaint. Santorum hailed the ruling as a victory against what he termed "baseless and politically motivated charges". Santorum told reporters that "[n]o one's children<U+2014>and especially not small, school-age children<U+2014>should be used as pawns in the '[[Opposition research|politics of personal destruction]].'"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05193/536563.stm|title=Penn Hills loses bid to charge Santorum for online school tuition|author=Amy McConnell Schaarsmith|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=July 12, 2005}}</ref> In the 2006 senate campaign, Santorum ran television commercials with Santorum's son saying "My dad's opponents have criticized him for moving us to Washington so we could be with him more."<ref>Santorum has got to be kidding.

In September 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Education agreed to pay the district $55,000 to settle the dispute over money withheld from the district to pay for the children of U.S. Senator Rick Santorum to attend a cyber charter school.

The matter rose again in May 2006. Santorum has said that his family stays during holidays and at times on weekends at the Penn Hills house. But the ''Progress'' reported in May that the house appeared unoccupied, and Casey's campaign noted that in a press release. Santorum then accused Casey's campaign of supporting trespassing on his property, saying of Casey "Now that he is a nominee, it is time for him to start acting like a candidate instead of a thug." Casey, in a statement, called the charges "false and malicious." His campaign, in a news release, described Santorum's actions as "weirdness".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/pennsylvania/14626414.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061001083735/http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/pennsylvania/14626414.htm|archivedate=October 1, 2006|title=Santorum calls Casey a 'thug' in residency flap|author=Carrie Budoff|date=May 20, 2006|publisher=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|accessdate=August 23, 2006}}</ref>

In September 2006, Santorum formally asked that the county remove the homestead tax exemption from his Penn Hills residence. He said that he had made similar requests to county officials in conversations in 2005 and earlier in 2006, but to no avail. In his letter, Santorum insisted that he was entitled to the exemption, which is worth about $70 annually, but chose not to take advantage of it because of the political dispute.<ref>James O'Toole, [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06270/725348-177.stm "Santorum asks county to drop tax exemption"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', September 27, 2006</ref> While homeowners in the county are eligible for a tax savings averaging $70 a year on their primary residences, the county council president noted that Santorum had "said during a televised debate that he spends about 30 days in his Penn Hills house each year.".<ref>Santorum campaign: No county tax break.

Allegheny County Election Office records indicate that, while a registered voter in the county, Santorum had since 1995 voted absentee.<ref name="yourpennhills2004">Santorum bills for children's school $100K<br>District pays, though family lives in Virginia. Vera Miller

The only way for Santorum to not pay for his children's private education was to enroll them in the Penn Hills School District. Virginia state law only requires local school districts to pay for private school tuition fee when a student has disabilities and enrolls in a school that can satisfy his or her needs, according to Charles Pyle, Virginia Department of Education spokesman. Otherwise, children in Virginia must attend their local public schools.<ref name="yourpennhills2004"/>

Santorum's supporters have said that the controversy is politically motivated because the school board is controlled by Democrats (Erin Vecchio, the school board member who first publicly raised the issue, is the chair of the local Democratic Party). They also have said that since Santorum votes in Penn Hills and pays [[property tax|property]] and school taxes there, he is entitled to the same privileges as any other Penn Hills resident and should not be deprived of these privileges as a result of his service in the U.S. Senate.<ref>{{citenews | title= State Pays Penn Hills Schools In Santorum Dispute

===Declaration regarding WMDs in Iraq===
In June 2006, Santorum declared that [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) had been found in Iraq.<ref name="wmdiraq">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200499,00.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080424081106/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200499,00.html|archivedate=April 24, 2008|title=Report: Hundreds of WMDs Found in Iraq|publisher=Fox News|date=June 22, 2006|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}</ref> The specific weapons he referred to were chemical munitions dating back to the [[Iran<U+2013>Iraq War]] that were buried in the early 1990s. The report stated that while agents had degraded to an unknown degree, they remained dangerous and possibly lethal.<ref name="wmdiraq" /> Officials of the Department of Defense, CIA intelligence analysts, and the White House have all explicitly stated that these expired casings are not part of the WMDs threat that [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] was launched to contain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101837.html|title=Lawmakers Cite Weapons Found in Iraq|date=June 23, 2006|work=Washington Post|author=Dafna Linzer}}</ref>

Santorum's declaration was based, in part, on declassified portions of a classified report from the National Ground Intelligence Center of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report on Iraqi Chemical Munitions|url=http://santorum.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=1078|date=June 21, 2006|accessdate=September 13, 2006|format=PDF}}</ref> Portions were declassified in a summary that made six key points:
* Since 2003, Coalition forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions which contain degraded or vacant [[mustard gas|mustard]] or [[sarin]] nerve agent casings.
* Despite many efforts to locate and destroy Iraq<U+2019>s pre<U+2013>[[Gulf War]] chemical munitions, filled and unfilled warheads are believed to still exist. They have no viable military capability, however.
* Pre<U+2013>Gulf War chemical munitions could be sold on the [[black market]]. Use of these weapons by terrorists or [[Iraqi insurgency|insurgent]] groups could have implications for Coalition forces in Iraq.
* The most likely munitions remaining are sarin- and mustard-filled projectile casings.
* The purity of the agent inside the munitions depends on many factors, including the manufacturing process, potential additives, and environmental storage conditions. While agents degrade over time, the residue could be hazardous upon dermal contact.
* It has been reported in open press that insurgents and Iraqi groups desire to acquire and use chemical weapons.

===Animal rights===
In 2005 a coalition of [[animal rights]] groups, spearheaded by the [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) and the [[Doris Day Animal League]] (DDAL) mounted a failed effort to push the ''Pet Animal Welfare Statute of 2005'' (PAWS) through Congress. The bill was proposed by Senator Santorum and sponsored by Senator [[Dick Durbin]] (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (then-R-PA). PAWS would have reclassified most small and hobby breeders as commercial breeders subjecting them to [[USDA]] regulations, allowed home inspections and placed fees and compliance expenses on pet breeders. Fellow Congressmen were told that PAWS was "the [[puppy mill]] bill".
This was Santorum's third failed attempt at pet-related legislation.

===ACLU suit===
In 2005, four teenagers were ejected from a bookstore in Wilmington, Delaware, where Santorum was scheduled for a book signing, after they were overheard expressing critical opinions of the senator.<ref name=ACLU>ACLU settles lawsuit stemming from 2005 Santorum event, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Friday, June 29, 2007 http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07180/798038-85.stm</ref> The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed suit, which was settled in 2007. As a result of the settlement, the Delaware State Police were required to pay legal fees for the plaintiffs and provide training to officers on free speech rights. The Santorum staff members who requested the ejection were required to apologize and to relinquish their salaries for the event<U+2014>$2,500.00<U+2014>to plaintiffs in damages.

===Other===
As a key member of the [[Gang of Seven]] (a group of seven freshmen Republican Congressmen), Santorum helped expose a [[House banking scandal|scandal]] at the House Bank. The Gang of Seven's reform-minded agenda is often cited as a foundation of the [[Republican Revolution|1994 Republican takeover]] of the House of Representatives.

In 1996, as a U.S. senator, Santorum served as Chairman of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] Task Force on Welfare Reform.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. The legislation that became the [[Welfare Reform Act of 1996]] written by Florida congressman [[E. Clay Shaw, Jr.]], passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]].

Though not a named author of the special Schiavo legislation, Santorum played a key role in shepherding the bill through the Senate to a vote on March 20, 2005. Santorum has frequently stated that he does not believe a "[[right to privacy]]" exists under the Constitution, even within marriage; he has been especially critical of the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), which held that the Constitution guaranteed the aforementioned right, and on that basis, overturned a law prohibiting the sale and use of [[birth control|contraceptives]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/santorum200507190728.asp|title=The Constitutional Wrecking Ball|author=Rick Santorum|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=July 19, 2005}}</ref>

Santorum is also a supporter of partial privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. Since the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Santorum has held forums across Pennsylvania on the topic.

In 2005, Santorum sponsored the [[Iran Freedom and Support Act]], which appropriated $10&nbsp;million aimed at [[regime change]] in Iran. The Act passed with overwhelming support. However, Santorum nevertheless voted against the [[Lautenberg]] amendment which would have closed the loophole which allows companies like [[Halliburton]] to do business with Iran through their foreign affiliates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjvoice.com/v16/16105santorum.html|title=Rick Santorum On Iran: His record does not match his rhetoric|publisher=[[Philadelphia Jewish Voice]]|author=Bonnie Squires|coauthors=Dan Loeb|work=Op/Ed|date=September 18, 2006|accessdate=September 22, 2006}}</ref>

In reference to the [[Iraq war]] in 2006, Santorum drew an analogy with ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in one of his addresses:

{{quote|As the [[hobbit]]s are going up [[Mount Doom]], the [[Eye of Sauron|Eye of Mordor]] is being drawn somewhere else. It's being drawn to Iraq and it's not being drawn to the U.S. You know what?

==2006 campaign==
{{Main|Pennsylvania United States Senate election, 2006}}
{{Very long|section|date=June 2011}}
In 2006, Santorum sought re-election to a third term in the U.S. Senate. His Democratic opponent was State Treasurer [[Robert P. Casey, Jr.|Bob Casey, Jr.]], the son of popular former governor [[Robert P. Casey|Robert Casey, Sr.]](D) Santorum's seat was a prime target of Democratic efforts to gain Senate seats in the [[U.S. Senate election, 2006|2006 elections]]. Casey's candidacy was bolstered by his opposition to abortion, negating one of Santorum's key issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Casey Widens Lead Over Santorum In Pennsylvania, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Voters Lean To Pro-Choice Side Of Abortion Debate|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1327.xml?ReleaseID=873|publisher=[[Quinnipiac University]]|date=February 13, 2006}}</ref>

Republican strategists took as a bad omen Santorum's primary result in 2006, in which he ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Republican gubernatorial nominee [[Lynn Swann]], also unopposed, garnered 22,000 more votes statewide than Santorum in the primary, meaning thousands of Republican voters abstained from endorsing Santorum for another Senate term.<!-- broken http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06138/691235-100.stm --> This may have been partly due to Santorum's support for Arlen Specter, over Congressman [[Pat Toomey]] in the 2004 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. Even though Santorum is only slightly less conservative than Toomey, he joined virtually all of the state and national Republican establishment in supporting the moderate Specter. This led many socially and fiscally conservative Republicans to consider Santorum's support of Specter to be a betrayal of their cause.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nysun.com/article/41237| title=Outside Santorum's Sanctum| author=Jerry Bowyer| publisher=New York Sun| date=October 10, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nationalreview.com/moore/moore200404150838.asp| title=Santorum's Shame| author=Stephen Moore| publisher=National Review| date=April 15, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://development.americasfuture.org/doublethink/2004/05/02/betrayal-in-pennsylvania/| title=Betrayal in Pennsylvania| author=Timothy P.

On May 22, 2006, the polling firm Rasmussen Reports declared that Santorum was the "most vulnerable incumbent" among the Senators running for re-election.<ref name="rasvuln">{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Senate: Casey by 23 Santorum Remains Most Vulnerable Incumbent|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2006/senate_races/pennsylvania_senate_casey_by_23|publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]]|date=May 31, 2006}}</ref> However, in August 2006, polling showed Santorum with his highest approval rating in months, 48 percent, a twelve-point jump between July and August. Nearly as many Pennsylvanians, 45 percent, said they had an unfavorable view of the Senator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surveyusa.com/50State2006/100USSenatorApproval060817State.htm|title=Approval Ratings for all 100 U.S. Senators as of 08/17/06|publisher=[[SurveyUSA]]|accessdate=September 9, 2006}}</ref>

For most of the campaign, Santorum was behind by 15 points or more. Most polls during the summer of 2006 showed the race between Casey and Santorum becoming [[Pennsylvania United States Senate election, 2006#Opinion polling|increasingly competitive]], but a poll released by [[Quinnipiac University]] on September 26 showed Casey's margin ballooning back to a double-digit lead.<ref name=forbes.com>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkdispatch.com/pennsylvania/ci_4404075|title=Casey Doubles Lead Over Santorum|author=Kimberly Hefling|publisher=[[York Dispatch]]|date=September 26, 2006}}</ref>

One day before the Quinnipiac poll was released, a Pennsylvania state judge ruled against a potential third-party candidate, Carl Romanelli of the Green Party. Romanelli fell about 8,900 petition signatures shy of the threshold needed to be placed on the statewide ballot in November. On October 4, 2006, the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court also rejected Romanelli's legal challenge.<ref name=thetimestribune.com>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17296894&BRD=2185&PAG=461&dept_id=415898&rfi=6|title=Ousted Romanelli Now Faces Money Problems|author=Elizabeth Skrapets|publisher=[[The Times-Tribune (Scranton)|Scranton Times-Tribune]]|date=October 7, 2006}}</ref> This was a potential blow to the Santorum campaign, as Romanelli was expected to siphon off some Casey voters.<ref name=forbes.com>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/business/businesstech/feeds/ap/2006/09/25/ap3043325.html|title=Pa.

There is also some question as to whether Romanelli and Pennsylvania's Green Party violated federal election laws when they accepted tens of thousands of dollars in donations from people also backing Santorum's campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/15167552.htm|title=Santorum donors give to Green Party|author=Carrie Budoff|publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=August 1, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/pennsylvania/counties/montgomery_county/15524018.htm|title=Lawyer: Green candidate's Senate petition is invalid|author=Martha Raffaele, Associated Press|publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=September 14, 2006}}</ref>

Santorum found himself mired in controversy over his residency. For many years, he has maintained a modest home in [[Penn Hills, Pennsylvania|Penn Hills]], a suburb of Pittsburgh, which he claims as his official residence. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} However, his family lived in the [[Virginia]] suburbs of Washington when the Senate was in session.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Since this meant Santorum spent most of the year away from Pennsylvania, critics argued it was not unlike the living arrangements he denounced in his 1990 House race against Walgren.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Santorum accused Walgren of being out of touch with his Pittsburgh-area district, symbolized by his home in the Virginia suburbs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} On [[NBC]]'s [[Meet the Press]] on September 3, 2006, Santorum admitted that he only spends "maybe a month a year, something like that" at his Pennsylvania residence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14568263/page/10|title=Meet the Press transcript|publisher=[[NBC]]|date=September 13, 2006}}</ref>

Santorum also drew criticism for enrolling five of his six children in an online "cyber school" in Pennsylvania's [[Allegheny County]] (home to Pittsburgh and most of its suburbs), despite the fact the children lived in Virginia. The [[Penn Hills]] School District was billed $73,000 in tuition for the cyber classes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gatewaynewspapers.com/pennhillsprogress/65799/|title=Dems Press Cyber Cost Issue|author=Vera Miller|publisher=[[Penn Hills Progress]]|date=September 20, 2006}}</ref>

At least one of Santorum's television ads called into question his campaign's use of the facts regarding Casey and persons who have donated money to the Casey campaign. According to the ad, some of the persons who have given Casey money are or have been under investigation for various crimes. An editorial in Casey's hometown newspaper, ''[[The Times-Tribune (Scranton)|The Scranton Times-Tribune]]'', points out that all but one of the contributions "[was] made to Casey campaigns when he was running for other offices, at which time none of the contributors were known to be under investigation for anything."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17200385&BRD=2185&PAG=461&dept_id=418218&rfi=6|title=Santorum hurls the low hard one|author=Editorial|publisher=[[The Times-Tribune (Scranton)|The Scranton Times-Tribune]]|date=September 15, 2006}}</ref> In fact, two of the persons cited in the Santorum campaign ad had actually given contributions to Mr. Santorum's 2006 Senate campaign.

A heated debate between the candidates occurred on October 11, 2006.<ref name=PPG1006>Toland, Bill. [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06286/729698-177.stm Santorum, Casey go toe-to-toe in debate].

Ed Rendell or challenger Lynn Swann, who had debated each other in Pittsburgh the [previous] week".<ref name=PPG1006/>

In late October, during the Lebanon County Republican Committee<U+2019>s annual dinner at the Lantern Lodge, Santorum said "If we are not successful here and things don<U+2019>t go right in the election, there<U+2019>s a good chance that the course of our country could change."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} "We are in the equivalent of the late 1930s, and this election will decide whether we are going to continue to appease or whether we will stand and fight while we have a chance to win without devastating consequences."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ldnews.com/news/ci_4541386| title=
Santorum issues GOP call to arms| author=Brad Rhen| publisher=Lebanon Daily News| date=October 25, 2006}}</ref>

Santorum on August 28 gave a speech to Pennsylvania media at the Pennsylvania Press Club luncheon in Harrisburg (which he earlier gave to the National Club) claiming that terrorist attacks on America by "radical Islamists" were part of a more than three-century-old plot to restore Shia clerics to power and bring "the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|12th Imam]]" out of hiding.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
He said, according to the online news service, [[Capitolwire]]: <U+201C>They believe, as all Shias do, in the Hidden Imam, the 12th Imam," the 12th descendant in a straight line from Mohammed the Prophet, who disappeared in 874, at the age of 5. <U+201C>The Shia believe that he is the Messiah and he is in hiding and that he will return. <U+2026> They believe <U+2026> he will return with radical Islam, when Shia dominates the world. Well, for over 1,000 years, ... the East and West fought, up until 1683 ... In 1683, not that long ago, the Islamists had surrounded the gates of Vienna and were on the verge of toppling it after a siege; ... but the West united, and led by the Poles, [King] John Sobieski and the Polish Hussars defeated [the Arab forces] in a one-day battle on the plains outside Vienna.
<U+201C>What was the high-water mark of this 1,000-year war? It was the day before. What was the date the day before? Sept. 11, 1683.<U+201D>

This speech eventually led to Santorum launching a tour called "The Gathering Storm," comparing himself to the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who alerted his nation and the world to the Nazi menace in the 1930s, and then fought with America, Russia and others to defeat the Germans, Italians and Japan in World War II in the 1940s.<ref>Raffaele, Martha. [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06300/733425-177.stm Santorum: Casey lacking on security]. ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', October 27, 2006.</ref> The Associated Press' Jennifer Yates wrote on Oct. 27 that Santorum said: "This is a moment, a critical crossroads in American history," as she noted that "Santorum, who invoked Winston Churchill's memoir <U+2013> "The Gathering Storm" <U+2013> about the causes of World War II" then told her and audiences: "The parallel is so profound."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Days before, Yates reported, Santorum said: Casey's election and that of other Democrats trying to take over the U.S. House and Senate would be "a disaster for the future of the world."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

On the Sunday before the election, Casey responded to the comment, telling Capitolwire: "Who runs a campaign like that? No one believes terrorists are going to be more likely to attack us, because I defeat Rick Santorum. Does even he believe that?"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Santorum wrote that many women have disclosed to him that it is more "socially affirming to work outside the home than to give up their careers to take care of their children.... What happened in America so that mothers and fathers who leave their children in the care of someone else <U+2013> or worse yet, home alone after school between three and six in the afternoon <U+2013> find themselves more affirmed by society? Here, we can thank the influence of radical feminism."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
Polls showed many female voters resented this description of why they worked, especially Republican and independent women whose abandonment of Santorum doomed his campaign, reported the online news service Capitolwire, based in Harrisburg.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
In a question-and-answer session on Aug. 28 at the Pennsylvania speech, Santorum tried again to address the issue and said his problem was that federal taxes now consumed 27 percent of family wages, and the second wage earner in most families made only 25 percent of the first's wages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

<U+201C>First, I would say, read the book and I think if you read the book, you can answer the question yourself. Because anyone who has read the book instead of the comments pulled out by the [[Democratic National Committee]] about the book, which was four sentences, by the way, in a 430-page book, <U+2026> would tell you I am supportive of families in a variety of different ways. ... What does the average second-earner in the family make? Twenty five percent of the first earner. ... Because of our tax code, we make it virtually impossible to maintain a standard of living and at the same time, be home with your children. ... Number two, look, I believe that women should have choices when it comes to the workforce. And they should be real choices.
"And look, I came from a family where my mother worked, all her life, made more money than my dad (N.B.: his mother and father were a registered nurse and psychiatrist, respectively). I have more people working in my office who are women, in senior policy positions, than men. So I don<U+2019>t have a hang-up with women working. I do have a hang-up with the government and others in society not nurturing, supporting and encouraging parents to be home with their kids when they need to be home. And I think we need to do more as a society to help them.<U+201D>{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Post-Senate career==
Before failing to win re-election in 2006, Santorum had frequently been mentioned as a possible [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential candidate]]. Such speculation faded when, during the course of the campaign and in light of unimpressive poll numbers, he declared that, if re-elected, he would serve a full term. After he lost, Santorum once again ruled out a presidential run.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/16032443.htm|title=Santorum: No oval office run|author=Carrie Budoff|work=inquirer.com|publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=November 17, 2006}}</ref>

In March 2007 Santorum joined Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott, LLC, where he primarily practiced law in the firm's [[Pittsburgh]] and Washington, D.C. offices providing business and strategic counseling services to the firm's clients.

Santorum formally announced his run for the Republican presidential nomination on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' on June 6, 2011, saying he's "in it to win."

On September 16th, 2011, Rick Santorum announced that he was replacing Michael Biundo as National Political Director with Ajay Bruno, a rising conservative political operative. The reasons cited were the minimal traction gained in the campaign as well as many internal problems with poor staffing choices. <ref>http://www.p2012.org/candidates/santorumorg.html</ref>
