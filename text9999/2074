'''Female genital mutilation''' ('''FGM'''), also known as '''female genital cutting''' and '''female circumcision''', is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external [[female genitalia]], or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons."<ref name=WHO1>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ "Female genital mutilation"], World Health Organization, February 2013 (hereafter WHO 2013).</ref> FGM is practised as a cultural ritual by [[Ethnic groups in Africa|ethnic groups]] in 28 countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Sarahan]] and [[Northeast Africa|north-east Africa]], as well as in parts of Asia, the Middle East and within immigrant communities elsewhere.<ref name=where/> It is typically carried out on girls aged four to ten, with or without [[anaesthesia]], by a traditional circumciser using a knife, razor or scissors.<ref name=agelead>Toubia, Nahid.

The practice involves one or more of several procedures, which vary according to the ethnic group. They include removal of all or part of the [[clitoris]] and [[clitoral hood]]; removal of all or part of the clitoris and [[inner labia]]; and in its most severe form ([[infibulation]]) removal of all or part of the inner and [[labia majora|outer labia]] and the fusion of the wound. In this last procedure, which the WHO calls [[#WHO Type III|Type III]] FGM, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, and the wound is opened up for intercourse and childbirth.<ref name=TypeIIIdef/> The health effects depend on the procedure but can include recurrent infections, chronic pain, infertility, [[epidermoid cyst]]s, [[Obstetric labor complication|complications during childbirth]] and fatal [[Bleeding|hemorrhaging]].<ref name=Abdulcadira>Abdulcadira, Jasmine; Margairaz, C.; Boulvain, M; Irion, O.

Both seem to have a past of contagious diffusion. Both are exaggerated over time and both increase with status. Both are supported and transmitted by women, are performed on girls about six to eight years old, and are generally not initiation rites. Both are believed to promote health and fertility.

The procedure is generally performed, with or without anaesthesia, by a traditional circumciser (a cutter or ''exciseuse''), usually an older woman who also acts as the local midwife, known as a ''daya'' in Egypt. Male [[Barber#History|barber]]s, who assume the role of health workers in some areas, may also carry out FGM, as well as male cirumcision.<ref>[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf UNICEF 2005], p. 7: "The large majority of girls and women are cut by a traditional practitioner, a category which includes local specialists (cutters or exciseuses), traditional birth attendants and, generally, older members of the community, usually women.

There is a fourth category, [[#Type IV|Type IV]], for miscellaneous procedures such as piercing and cauterization.<ref name=WHOclassification2008>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf "Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation"], World Health Organization, 2008 (hereafter WHO 2008), pp. 4, 22<U+2013>28.

The study's authors advised the WHO to revise its classification.<ref name=Elmusharaf2006/> UNICEF instead uses (1) cut, no flesh removed (pricking); (2) cut, some flesh removed; (3) sewn closed; and (4) type not determined/unsure/doesn't know.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p. 48: "In the most recent MICS and DHS, types of FGM/C are classified into four main categories: 1) cut, no flesh removed, 2) cut, some flesh removed, 3) sewn closed, and 4) type not determined/not sure/doesn't know. These categories do not fully match the WHO typology. Cut, no flesh removed describes a practice known as nicking or pricking, which currently is categorized as Type IV. Cut, some flesh removed corresponds to Type I (clitoridectomy) and Type II (excision) combined. And sewn closed corresponds to Type III, infibulation."</ref>

===WHO Types I and II===
The WHO's Type I is subdivided into two. Type Ia is the removal of the [[clitoral hood]], which is rarely, if ever, performed alone<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf WHO 2008], p. 24.

Type III ([[infibulation]]) is the removal of all external genitalia and the fusing of the wound, leaving a small hole (2<U+2013>3&nbsp;mm)<ref name=Abdulcadira/> for the passage of urine and menstrual blood. The inner and outer labia are cut away, with or without excision of the clitoris.<ref name=TypeIIIdef>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf WHO 2008], p. 4: "Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation)."

The wound is sutured, using surgical thread, [[agave]] or [[acacia]] thorns, and the girl's legs are tied from hip to ankle for a period, perhaps 2<U+2013>6 weeks, until the tissue has bonded, forming a wall of flesh and skin across the [[vulva]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9326757 Elchalal et al 1997].

"With her kitchen knife the woman then pierces and slices open the hood of the clitoris and then begins to cut it out. While another woman wipes off the blood with a rag, the operator digs with her fingernail a hole the length of the clitoris to detach and pull out that organ. The little girl screams in extreme pain, but no one pays the slightest attention."<p>After removing the clitoris with the knife, the woman "lifts up the skin that is left with her thumb and index finger to remove the remaining flesh. She then digs a deep hole amidst the gushing blood. The neighbor women who take part in the operation then plunge their fingers into the bloody hole to verify that every remnant of the clitoris is removed." See Lantier, Jacques.

*Momoh 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA6 pp. 6<U+2013>7], also describes an infibulation: "[E]lderly women, relatives and friends secure the girl in the [[lithotomy position]]. A deep incision is made rapidly on either side from the root of the clitoris to the [[Frenulum of labia minora|fourchette]], and a single cut of the razor excises the clitoris and both the labia majora and labia minora.<p> "Bleeding is profuse, but is usually controlled by the application of various [[poultice]]s, the threading of the edges of the skin with thorns, or clasping them between the edges of a split cane. A piece of twig is inserted between the edges of the skin to ensure a patent [[foramen]] for urinary and menstrual flow. The lower limbs are then bound together for 2<U+2013>6 weeks to promote [[Hemostasis|haemostatis]] and encourage union of the two sides ... Healing takes place by [[primary intention]], and, as a result, the [[introitus]] is obliterated by a drum of skin extending across the orifice except for a small hole. Circumstances at the time may vary; the girl may struggle ferociously, in which case the incisions may become uncontrolled and haphazard. The girl may be pinned down so firmly that bones may fracture."</ref> Anthropologist [[Janice Boddy]] witnessed the infibulation of two sisters in northern Sudan in 1976; the procedure was carried out by a traditional circumciser, or midwife, using an anaesthetic:

{{quote box
|quote=
A crowd of ''habobat'' (grandmothers) have gathered in the yard <U+2013> not a man in sight. ... The girl lies docile on an ''angarib'', beneath which smoulders incence in a cracked clay pot. Her hands and feet are stained with henna applied the night before. Several kinswomen support her torso; two others hold her legs apart. Miriam [the midwife] thrice injects her genitals with local anesthetic, then, in the silence of the next few moments, takes a small pair of scissors and quickly cuts away her clitoris and labia minora; the rejected tissue is caught in a bowl below the bed. ... I am surprised there is so little blood. ... Miriam staunches the flow with a white cotton cloth. She removes a surgical needle from her midwife's kit ... and threads it with suture. She sews together the girl's outer labia leaving a small opening at the vulva. After a liberal application of antiseptic the operation is over.

Women gently lift the sisters as their ''angaribs'' are spread with multicolored ''birish''s, "red" bridal mats. The girls seem to be experiencing more shock than pain ... Amid trills of joyous ululations we adjourn to the courtyard for tea; the girls are also brought outside. There they are invested with the ''jirtig'': ritual jewelry, perfumes, and cosmetic pastes worn to protect those whose reproductive ability is vulnerable to attack from malign spirits and the evil eye. The sisters wear bright new dresses, bridal shawls called ''garmosis'' (singular), and their family's gold. Relatives sprinkle guests with cologne, much as they would at a wedding; redolent incense rises on the morning air. Newly circumcised girls are referred to as little brides (''arus''); much that is done for a bride is done for them, but in a minor key. Importantly, they have now been rendered marriageable.<ref name=Boddy1989p50>[[Janice Boddy|Boddy, Janice]].

Boddy wrote that older women in Sudan recalled a procedure much more painful, in which the circumciser would scrape away the external genitals with a straight razor, and with no anaesthetic. She would then pull the skin on either side of the wound together and secure it with acacia thorns, inserting a straw or hollow reed to create a hole for urine and menstrual blood. The girl would lie with her legs tied together for up to 40 days.<ref>Boddy 1989, [http://books.google.com/books?id=TK6NIp5uVwsC&pg=PA51 p. 51].</ref>

The infibulated woman's vulva is cut open for sexual intercourse and childbirth. It can take up to two years for a husband to penetrate his wife's infibulation. Boddy wrote in 1989 that it was a point of pride for men in Sudan that their wives give birth within a year of marriage, so the midwife might have to be sent for secretly to enlarge the wife's opening.<ref>Boddy 1989, [http://books.google.com/books?id=TK6NIp5uVwsC&pg=PA54 p. 54].</ref> Hanny Lightfoot-Klein, a social psychologist, interviewed 300 Sudanese women and 100 Sudanese men in the 1980s and described the penetration by the men of their wives' infibulation:

{{quote box
|quote=
The penetration of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some who are unable to penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place. ... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, with the help of the "little knife." This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis. In some women, the scar tissue is so hardened and overgrown with keloidal formations that it can only be cut with very strong surgical scissors, as is reported by doctors who relate cases where they broke scalpels in the attempt.<ref name=Lightfoot>Lightfoot-Klein, Hanny.

===WHO Type IV===
A variety of other procedures are collectively known as Type IV, which the WHO defines as "all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example, pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization." The WHO does not include cosmetic procedures such as [[labiaplasty]] or procedures used in [[sex reassignment surgery]] within its categories of FGM (see [[#comparison|below]]).<ref name=WHOelective/>

Type IV ranges from ritual nicking of the clitoris to [[Labia stretching|stretching the labia]] or clitoris, burning or scarring the genitals, or introducing harmful substances into the vagina to tighten it.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf WHO 2008], p. 24.</ref> Social scientist [[Stanlie M. James]] writes that Mairo Usman Mandara, a Nigerian surgeon, has described several practices that involve cutting internal genitalia (introcision); these include [[hymenotomy]], the removal of a [[hymen]] regarded as too thick, practised by the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] in West Africa. They also include [[gishiri cutting]], in which the vagina's anterior wall is cut with a razor blade or penknife to enlarge it; according to James, this might be done during obstructed labour or to address other medical issues.<ref>James, Stanlie M. "Female Genital Mutilation," in Bonnie G. Smith (ed.). ''The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Women in World History'', Oxford University Press, 2008 (pp. 259<U+2013>262), [http://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&pg=PA259 p. 259].</ref> Izett and Toubia write that it often results in [[vesicovaginal fistula]]e and damage to the anal sphincter.<ref>[https://apps.who.int/dsa/cat98/fgmbook.htm Izett and Toubia (WHO), 1998].</ref><!--rewrite, expand and re-source-->

===Reinfibulation and defibulation===
Women may request reinfibulation <U+2013> the restoration of the infibulation <U+2013> after giving birth, known in Sudan as ''El-Adel'' (re-circumcision or, literally, "putting right" or "improving"). Two cuts are made around the vagina, then sutures are put in place to tighten it to the size of a pinhole. Vanja Bergrren writes that this has the effect of mimicking virginity. It may also be carried out just before marriage, after divorce or to prepare elderly women for death.<ref name=Bergrren>Bergrren, Vanja, et al. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17217115 "Being Victims or Beneficiaries?

Defibulation, or deinfibulation, is a surgical technique to reverse the closure of the vaginal opening after infibulation; it consists of a vertical cut opening up normal access to the vagina.<ref>Nour, N.M.; Michaels, K.B.; and Bryant, A.E.

Procedures have been developed to repair clitoral integrity, such as by [[Pierre Foldes]], a French urologist and surgeon, and [[Marci Bowers]], an American surgeon who studied his work, using intact clitoral tissue from inside women's bodies to form a new clitoris.<ref name=Conant>Conant, Eve.

===Complications===
[[File:Knifes FGM.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photograph|Knives used for FGM in East Africa, photographed in 2004]]
FGM has no known health benefits.<ref>Berga, Rigmor C. and Denisona Eva. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07399332.2012.721417#tabModule "A Tradition in Transition: Factors Perpetuating and Hindering the Continuance of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) Summarized in a Systematic Review"], ''Health Care for Women International'', 34(10), 2013: "According to leading health organizations, there are no known health benefits to FGM/C ..."</ref> It has immediate and late [[complication (medicine)|complication]]s, which depend on several factors: the type of FGM; the conditions in which the procedure took place and whether the practitioner had medical training; whether unsterilized or surgical single-use instruments were used; whether surgical thread was used instead of agave or acacia thorns; the availability of antibiotics; how small a hole was left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood; and whether the procedure was performed more than once (for example, to close an opening regarded as too wide or re-open one too small).<ref name=Abdulcadira/>

Immediate complications include fatal [[hemorrhage]], acute [[urinary retention]], [[urinary infection]], [[wound infection]], [[septicemia]], [[tetanus]] and transmission of [[hepatitis]] or [[HIV]] if instruments are non-sterile or reused.<ref name=Abdulcadira/> It is not known how many girls and women die from the procedure; few records are kept, complications may not be recognized, and fatalities are rarely reported.<ref>[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf UNICEF 2005], p. 16: "The mortality rate of girls and women undergoing FGM/C is not known, since few records are kept and deaths due to FGM/C are rarely reported as such. Medical records are also of limited use in determining morbidity due to FGM/C because complications resulting from the practice, including subsequent difficulties in childbirth, are often not recognised or reported as such and may be attributed to other causes. In some cases, these assigned causes may be medical in nature, but in others, they may reflect traditional beliefs or be attributed to supernatural causes. As a result, many girls who experience complications are treated with traditional medicines or cures and are not referred to health centres."</ref>

Late complications vary depending on the type of FGM performed.<ref name=Abdulcadira/> The formation of scars and [[keloid]]s can lead to strictures, obstruction or fistula formation of the urinary and genital tracts. Urinary tract sequelae include damage to urethra and bladder with infections and [[Fecal incontinence|incontinence]]. Genital tract sequelae include vaginal and pelvic infections, [[dysmenorrhea]], [[dyspareunia]] and [[infertility]].<ref name=Kelly/> Complete obstruction of the vagina results in [[hematocolpos]] and [[hematometra]].<ref name=Abdulcadira/> Other complications include [[epidermoid cyst]]s that may become infected, neuroma formation, typically involving nerves that supplied the clitoris, and pelvic pain.<ref name=Dave>Dave, Amish J.; Sethi, Aisha; and Morrone, Aldo. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21095534 "Female Genital Mutilation: What Every American Dermatologist Needs to Know"], ''Dermatologic Clinics'', 29(1), January 2011, pp. 103<U+2013>109 (review).</ref>

FGM may complicate pregnancy and place women at higher risk for obstetrical problems, which are more common with the more extensive FGM procedures.<ref name=Abdulcadira/> Thus, in women with Type III FGM who have developed [[Vesicovaginal fistula|vesicovaginal]] or [[rectovaginal fistula]]e <U+2013> holes that allow urine and faeces to seep into the vagina <U+2013> it is difficult to obtain clear urine samples as part of prenatal care, making the diagnosis of conditions such as [[preeclampsia]] harder.<ref name="Kelly"/> Cervical evaluation during labour may be impeded and labour prolonged. Third-degree laceration, anal sphincter damage and emergency caesarean section are more common in women who have experienced FGM.<ref name=Abdulcadira/> [[Neonatal mortality]] is also increased. The WHO estimated that an additional 10<U+2013>20 babies die per 1,000 deliveries as a result of FGM; the estimate was based on a 2006 study conducted on 28,393 women attending delivery wards at 28 obstetric centers in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan. In those settings all types of FGM were found to pose an increased risk of death to the baby: 15 percent higher for Type I, 32 percent for Type II and 55 percent for Type III.<ref name=Banks2006>Banks, E. et al.

Psychological complications include depression and loss of trust in caregivers.<ref>Dorkenoo 1999, p. 90.</ref> Toubia writes that girls living in communities where FGM is practised are torn between fear of the procedure and wanting to please their parents and gain social status. She writes that many infubulated women live with chronic anxiety and depression and fear of infertility.<ref name=toubia1994>[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199409153311106 Toubia 1994], pp. 712<U+2013>716 (this paper proposes a classification system that differs from the one used by the WHO.)</ref> Feelings of shame and betrayal can develop when they move outside their traditional circles and are confronted with the view that mutilation is not the norm.<ref name=Abdulcadira/> They typically report sexual dysfunction and [[dyspareunia]] (painful sexual intercourse), but FGM does not necessarily destroy sexual desire in women. According to several studies in the 1980s and 1990s, the women said they were able to enjoy sex, though the risk of sexual dysfunction was higher with Type III.<ref>Boyle, Elizabeth Heger.

FGM is viewed by its practitioners as an essential part of raising a girl.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html WHO 2013]: "FGM is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl properly, and a way to prepare her for adulthood and marriage."</ref> Among the reasons cited are hygiene and aesthetics, purity and honour, and birth control.<ref>James 2008, [http://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&pg=PA261 p. 261].</ref> The promotion of fertility is another reason: political scientist [[Gerry Mackie]] writes that the women's fertility is emphasized by de-emphasizing their sexuality.<ref name=Mackie1996p1005/> Most often cited is a desire to promote female virginity and fidelity.<ref>James 2008, p. 261: "The most frequently mentioned rationale is the need to control women, especially their sexuality."
*Rahman and Toubia 2000, pp. 5<U+2013>6: "A fundamental reason advanced for female circumcision is the need to control women's sexuality ... FC/FGM is intended to reduce women's sexual desire, thus promoting women's virginity and protecting marital fidelity, in the interest of male sexuality."</ref> Female monogamy protects [[patrilineage]] by increasing the likelihood that a man is the father of his wife's children,<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/643328 Oldfield Hayes 1975], p. 617.</ref> and infibulation almost guarantees monogamy because of the pain associated with sex and the difficulty of opening an infibulation without being discovered.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html WHO 2013]: "When a vaginal opening is covered or narrowed (type 3 above), the fear of the pain of opening it, and the fear that this will be found out, is expected to further discourage 'illicit' sexual intercourse among women with this type of FGM."</ref> Women whose husbands travel may be reinfibulated during the man's absence. The procedure also helps to prevent rape.<ref name=Mackie1996p1004>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096305 Mackie 1996], p. 1004 (also [http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf here]).</ref>

The primary sexual concerns vary between communities. [[Anika Rahman|Rahman]] and Toubia write that the focus in Egypt, Sudan and Somalia is on curbing premarital sex, whereas in Kenya and Uganda it is to reduce a woman's sexual desire for her husband so that he can more easily take several wives. In both cases, they argue, the aim is to serve the interests of male sexuality.<ref>Rahman and Toubia 2000, pp. 5<U+2013>6.</ref> Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes argued in 1975 that, in Sudan, virginity is more of a concept than a physiological state, and that a woman can regain her virginity and honour (her ''ird'', or sexual dignity) by being infibulated.<ref>Oldfield Hayes, Rose. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/643328 "Female Genital Mutilation, Fertility Control, Women's Roles, and the Patrilineage in Modern Sudan: A Functional Analysis"], ''American Ethnologist'' 2(4), November 1975 (pp. 617<U+2013>633), p. 622.</ref>

Female genitals are regarded within communities that practise FGM as dirty and ugly; physicians Miriam Martinelli and [[:es:Jaume Enric Oll<U+00E9>|Jaume Enric Oll<U+00E9>-Goig]] write that the preference is for women's genitalia to be "flat, rigid and dry."<ref name=Martinelli>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3598278/ Martinelli and Oll<U+00E9>-Goig 2012].</ref> In some societies, such as among the [[Dogon people]] of Mali, the procedure is performed to differentiate between the genders, based on the belief that the clitoris confers masculinity on a girl and the foreskin of a boy makes him feminine. Gruenbaum writes that in northern Sudan the clitoris and labia (the "masculine" parts) are viewed as ugly, and the smooth, infibulated vulva as feminine, at least by women who support infibulation.<ref>For the Dogon, see Dettwyler 1994, p. 27; for the rest, see Gruenbaum 2001, [http://books.google.com/books?id=JOXmOLBd4E4C&pg=PA678 p. 68], citing Assad 1980, p. 4.</ref> There are also various myths about the dangers of the clitoris: girls are told it will keep on growing, will harm a baby if it comes into contact with the baby's head, can make men impotent, and that failing to have it removed will see them shunned by the community.<ref>Gollaher 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=usEzSffvPBMC&pg=PA197 p. 197]; [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096305 Mackie 1996], p. 1009 (also [http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf here]).</ref> A more practical reason for FGM's continuance is that the female circumcisers or midwives rely to some extent on the practice for their living and status, and are therefore inclined to declare it a cultural necessity.<ref>Windle, Sarah et al. "Harmful Traditional Practices and Women's Health: Female Genital Mutilation" in John Erihi (ed.), ''Maternal and Child Health: Global Challenges, Programs, and Policies'', Springer 2009, p. 180.

Mackie compares FGM with the practice of [[footbinding]] in China. Like FGM, footbinding was an ethnic marker carried out on young girls, was nearly universal where practised, controlled sexual access to women, was tied to ideas about honour, appropriate marriage, health, fertility and aesthetics, was supposed to enhance male sexual pleasure, and was supported by the women themselves.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096305 Mackie 1996], pp. 999<U+2013>1000 (also [http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf here]).</ref>

In the rural Eygyptian hamlet where we have conducted fieldwork some women were not familiar with groups that did not circumcise their girls. When they learned that the female researcher was not circumcised their response was disgust mixed with joking laughter. They wondered how she could have thus gotten married and questioned how her mother could have neglected such an important part of her preparation for womanhood.

A 1988 poem by Somali woman Dahabo Musa described infibulation as the "three feminine sorrows": the procedure itself, the wedding night when the woman has to be cut open, then childbirth when she has to be cut again.<ref>Abdalla, Raqiya D.

Nearly 59 percent of 3,210 Sudanese women in physician Asma El Dareer's 1980s study said they preferred Types II and III over Type I.<ref name=Kirby2005p84>Kirby, Vicki. "Out of Africa: 'Our Bodies Ourselves'?" in Obioma Nnaemeka (ed.), ''Female Circumcision and the Politics of Knowledge: African Women in Imperialist Discourses'', Praeger, 2005, p. 84.</ref> Women in Sudan discussing circumcision with Janice Boddy in 1984 depicted Type I by opening their mouths and Type III by closing them tight, asking her: "Which is better, an ugly opening or a dignified closure?" Boddy wrote that the women avoided being photographed laughing or smiling for the same reason, preferring human orifices to be left closed or minimized, particularly female ones.<ref>Boddy 1989, [http://books.google.com/books?id=TK6NIp5uVwsC&pg=PA52 p. 52]. Gruenbaum (pp. 68<U+2013>69) argues that FGM associates women with enclosure and the domestic interior of the home, rather than the exterior of the public sphere for men.</ref>

Izett and Toubia write that any change to the state of a woman's infibulation can affect her sense of identity and security. They cite the case of a Somali mother of three who was advised to remain defibulated after childbirth to cure her [[gonorrhoea]], but who insisted on being re-infibulated, leading to pain and infection so severe she could hardly walk. They argue that she did this out of "her own sense of impurity," not for her husband's benefit.<ref name=IzettToubia>Izett, Susan and [[Nahid Toubia|Toubia, Nahid]]. [https://apps.who.int/dsa/cat98/fgmbook.htm "Female Genital Mutilation: An Overview"], World Health Organization, 1998.</ref> Women who have not undergone FGM may find themselves shunned by other women and less likely to find a husband. Sociologist Elizabeth Heger Boyle writes that, in Tanzania, the [[Maasai people|Masai]] will not call an uncircumcised woman "mother" when she has children, and the [[Kuria people|Kuria]] laugh at uncut women when they go bathing. In several communities uncut women may not be allowed to attend funerals and other public events.<ref>Boyle 2002, p. 37.</ref>

Some Western feminists <U+2013> to the anger of their African counterparts <U+2013> have attributed the women's support for FGM to [[false consciousness]], the idea that they have simply internalized the [[sexism]] of their environments.<ref>Duncan, Jennifer S. "French feminism's struggle to become global," in Francisca de Haan, Margaret Allen, June Purvis (eds.), ''Women's Activism: Global Perspectives from the 1890s to the Present'', Routledge, 2013, p. 193: "That French feminists would fail to recognize the dissonance surrounding their campaigns against female genital cutting among African women highlights the problems of coalition building within a feminist framework. In particular, the feminist notion of false consciousness, which asserted that individual women were often complicit in their own oppression as they internalized sexist ideas about themselves, provoked hostility among African women who were suspicious of Western feminist motives and of solutions that did not incorporate complementary gender roles."
*[http://www.iscgmedia.com/uploads/6/0/9/7/6097060/johnsdotter_cvs.pdf Johnsdotter and Ess<U+00E9>n 2010], p. 31: "Other radical feminist writers in the US and Western Europe admitted there was a discrepancy involved in labelling female circumcision as a form of male violence when women are generally the ones arranging the procedure and are often the most fervent advocates of the tradition. A way to resolve this paradox was to ascribe false consciousness to all the female actors who uphold and defend these practices ..."
*Pedwell, Carolyn. ''Feminism, Culture and Embodied Practice: The Rhetorics of Comparison'', Routledge, 2010, p. 62: "[F]eminist theorists ... seek to break down binaries which depict 'female genital mutilation' as the result of complicity, oppression and false consciousness ''against'' representations of cosmetic surgery as a free, empowered and authentic choice."
*Gruenbaum 2001, p. 35: "The usual response in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States women's movement was that women who accepted subordination might be said to have a 'false consciousness' ... For the most part, Western feminists have found themselves in a dilemma in dealing with female circumcision. To label women of a different culture as having a 'false consciousness' for advocating circumcision sounds like a delegitimization of the culture or beliefs of others."</ref> Mackie calls the support a "belief trap": "a belief that cannot be revised because the costs of testing the belief are too high." The cost of dissent in this case, he writes, is that the dissenters may fail to have descendants.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096305 Mackie 1996], p. 1009 (also [http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf here]).</ref>

===Support from men===
In a study in the Gambia, where Types I and II are practised and three out of 4 women are cut, just over 60 percent of men said they supported FGM and intended to have it performed on their daughters. Almost 72 percent did not know that it had negative health effects. Most said they were not involved in the decision to have their daughters cut. Men between 31 and 45 expressed the least support for it.<ref>Kaplan, Adriana et al.

A reason women often offer in support of infibulation is that it enhances male sexual pleasure. Gruenbaum reports that men seem to enjoy the effort to penetrate their wife's infibulation, and "can be very generous with gifts of gold or other precious things when they find the tightness of the opening to their liking."<ref>Gruenbaum 2001, p. 140.</ref> Some studies have suggested otherwise.<ref name=Mackie1996p1005>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096305 Mackie 1996], p. 1005 (also [http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf here]).</ref> Fewer than 20 percent of 1,545 men in a 1980s study by Sudanese physician Asma El Dareer said they preferred Type III over the other forms.<ref name=Kirby2005p84/>

===FGM and religion===
{{further|Religious views on female genital mutilation}}
Mackie writes that FGM is found only in or adjacent to [[Islam]]ic groups, but is not practised in most Muslim countries. It is also not practised in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], Islam's holiest cities, where the Saudis regard it as a [[Paganism|pagan]] custom. There is no mention of it in the [[Koran]], although it is praised in several ''[[hadith]]'', sayings attributed to Mohammed, as noble but not required.<ref name=Mackie1996p1004>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096305 Mackie 1996], pp. 1004<U+2013>1005 (also [http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf here]): "FGM is found only in or adjacent to Islamic groups (some Christians practice it to avoid damnation). This is curious, because FGM, beyond the mild ''sunna'' supposedly akin to male circumcision, is not found in most Islamic countries nor is it required by Islam. Mutilation is not practiced in Mecca or Medina, and Saudis reportedly find the custom pagan. The Koran is silent on FGM, but several ''hadith'' (sayings attributed to Mohammed) recommend attenuating the practice for the woman's sake, praise it as noble but not commanded, or advise that female converts refrain from mutilation because even if pleasing to the husband it is painful to the wife."
*Nussbaum 1999, p. 125: "The one reference to the operation in the ''hadith'' classifies it as a ''makrama'', or nonessential practice."</ref> Islamic scholars debate whether it is desirable, and several Muslim leaders have spoken out against it.<ref>Gruenbaum 2001, [http://books.google.com/books?id=JOXmOLBd4E4C&pg=PA63 pp. 63<U+2013>66].

Knight adds that Egyptologists are uncomfortable with the translation of the word "uncircumcised" because it offers no information about what might constitute the circumcised state.</ref> The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] (c. 64 BCE <U+2013> c. 23 CE) wrote of it after visiting Egypt around 25 BCE: "This is one of the customs most zealously pursued by them [the Egyptians]: to raise every child that is born and to circumcise the males and excise the females."<ref name=KnightStrabo>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p. 318: "That custom is excision of the clitoris and other external female genitalia, sometimes called female circumcision but now usually referred to in Egypt as female genital mutilation (FGM); the first extant literary mention of it is by the Greek geographer Strabo, who visited Egypt in about 25 BCE: 'This is one of the customs most zealously pursued by them [the Egyptians]: to raise every child that is born and to circumcise the males and excise the females'" (citing Strabo,''Geographika'', 17.2.5).
*Strabo, ''Geography of Strabo'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17B*.html#ref273 Book VII, chapter 2], 17.2.5, wrote: "One of the customs most zealously observed among the Aegyptians is this, that they rear every child that is born, and circumcise [''{{lang|grc-la|peritemnein}}''] the males, and excise [''{{lang|grc-la|ektemnein}}''] the females, as is also customary among the Jews, who are also Aegyptians in origin, as I have already stated in my account of them."
*Strabo also wrote, ''Geography of Strabo'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16D*.html Book XVI, chapter 4], 16.4.9: "And then to the Harbour of Antiphilus, and, above this, to the Creophagi [meat-eaters], of whom the males have their sexual glands mutilated [''{{lang|grc-la|kolobos}}''] and the women are excised [''{{lang|grc-la|ektemnein}}''] in the Jewish fashion." A different translation [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.371:1145.GreekTexts here] reads: "Then follows the harbour of Antiphilus, and above this a tribe, the Creophagi, deprived of the prepuce, and the women are excised after the Jewish custom."
*See Cohen 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=PmL-LogqJ-YC&pg=PA59 p. 59ff] for a discussion of Strabo on this point; he argues that Strabo conflated the Jews with the Egyptians.
*[[Jacob Neusner]] (''Approaches to Ancient Judaism'', Volume 4, Scholars Press, 1993, p. 148) writes that Strabo was confused about Jewish custom. He also writes: "the Greek verb {{lang|grc|<U+03C0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03AD><U+03BC><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD>}} [''{{lang|grc-la|peritemnein}}''] 'to cut around/off,' denoted not only circumcision but could be used of any mutilation of body parts, such as the severing of a nose or ears; in Herodotus it is associated with various barbarian practices."

The Minerva Group, Inc., 2001, [http://books.google.com/books?id=-_g0L-K_XLIC&pg=PA45 pp. 45<U+2013>46].</ref> The philosopher [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]] (c. 20 BCE <U+2013> 50 CE) contrasted the Egyptian practice with God's commandment in the [[Book of Genesis]] (c. 950<U+2013>500 BCE) that boys be circumcised, writing: "the Egyptians by the custom of their country circumcise the marriageable youth and maid in the fourteenth (year) of their age, when the male begins to get seed, and the female to have a menstrual flow."<ref>Genesis 17:10; [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p. 333.</ref>

A [[heiroglyph]] of a woman in labour and the physical examination of [[Mummy|mummies]] by Australian pathologist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] (1871<U+2013>1937) suggest that Type III was not performed in ancient Egypt, although as part of the mummification process, the skin of the outer labia was pulled toward the anus to form a covering over the [[pudendal cleft]] (possibly to prevent sexual violation), which gave the appearance of Type III. Smith wrote that soft tissues were often removed by embalmers, or had simply deteriorated, so that it was not possible to determine from the mummies whether Types I and II had been practised.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p. 331, citing G. Elliot Smith, ''A Contribution to the Study of Mummification in Egypt'', 1906, p. 30.
*[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p. 331, also quotes [[Marc Armand Ruffer]] (1859<U+2013>1917), ''Studies in the Paleopathology of Egypt'', University of Chicago Press, 1921, p. 171: "the bodies are in such a state that it would often be difficult to state with certainty whether such an operation had been done." She adds: "In light of the fact that only rarely have scientific researchers autopsying mummies specifically looked for the presence or absence of FGM, conclusive remarks about the prevalence of the practice must await a detailed study of a large cohort of female mummies."</ref><!--check Browne and slaves-->

Egyptologist Mary Knight writes that there is only one extant reference from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] that suggests FGM might have been practised outside Egypt. [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus of Lydia]] wrote in a history of [[Lydia]] in the fifth century BCE: "The Lydians arrived at such a state of delicacy that they were even the first to 'castrate' their women." Knight argues from the context that "castrate" refers here to a form of sterilization.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p. 326: "Extant fragments from a fifth-century BCE history of Lydia by Xanthos of Lydia, a contemporary of Herodotus, say: 'The Lydians arrived at such a state of delicacy that they were even the first to "castrate" their women.'" Lydia wrote that the purpose of the "castration," which is not described, was to keep women youthful, perhaps in the sense of allowing the Lydian king to have intercourse with them without pregnancy. Knight concludes that "castration" is therefore probably not a reference to FGM, but may have been a reference to some form of sterilization.</ref><!--Note: Several non-specialists sources say that Herodotus, Agatharchides, or a papyrus from 163 BCE refer to female circumcision, but this appears not to be correct; it should not be added without a specialist source (ancient historian).-->

Mackie writes that FGM in Africa became tied up with the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]]. The Egyptians took captives in the south to be used as slaves, and slaves from Sudan were exported through the Red Sea to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The English explorer [[William George Browne|William Browne]] (1768<U+2013>1813) reported in 1799 that infibulation was carried out on slaves in Egypt to prevent pregnancy (although the Swedish ethnographer, [[:sv:Carl G<U+00F6>sta Widstrand|Carl G<U+00F6>sta Widstrand]], argued that the slave traders simply paid a higher price for women who were infibulated anyway), and the Portuguese missionary [[Jo<U+00E3>o dos Santos]] (d. 1622) wrote of a group in Mogadishu who had a "custome to sew up their Females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their Masters put in them."<ref name=Mackie1996p1003>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096305 Mackie 1996], p. 1003 (also [http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf here]), citing Carl G<U+00F6>sta Widstrand, "Female Infibulation," ''Studia Ethnographica Upsaliensia'', XX, 1960, pp. 95<U+2013>124, and Jo<U+00E3>o dos Santos, ''Ethiopia Oriental'', 1609, in G.S.P.

*Physician and ethnologist [[Charles Gabriel Seligman|Charles Seligman]] (1873<U+2013>1940) suggested in 1913 that FGM derived from ceremonies performed by [[Afroasiatic languages|Hamito-Semitic]] people on the [[Red Sea]] coast, spreading westwards and southwards across Africa; see Seligman, Charles G. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2843546 "Aspects of the Hamitic problems in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan"],''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', 1913, 40(3), (pp. 593<U+2013>705), pp. 612, 639<U+2013>640.

Historians Robert Strayer and Jocelyn Murray write that uncircumcised girls in Kenya were outcasts, often ending up as prostitutes, so to ask the Kikuyu to give up FGM was to them unthinkable.

Such was the focus on FGM that the 1929<U+2013>1931 period in Kenya became known in the country's historiography as the [[Female circumcision controversy (Kenya, 1929<U+2013>1932)|female circumcision controversy]].

:::::::::<blockquote>The real argument lies not in the defense of the general surgical operation or its details, but in the understanding of a very important fact in the tribal psychology of the Kikuyu <U+2013> namely, that this operation is still regarded as the essence of an institution which has enormous educational, social moral and religious implications, quite apart from the operation itself.

In 1956, under pressure from the British, the council of male elders (the ''Njuri Nchecke'') in Meru, Kenya, announced a ban on clitoridectomy. Historian Lynn Thomas writes that over two thousand girls <U+2013> mostly teenagers, but some as young as eight <U+2013> were charged over the next three years with having carried out the procedure on each other with razor blades, a practice that came to be known as ''Ngaitana'' ("I will circumcise myself"), so-called because the girls claimed to have cut themselves to avoid naming their friends.<ref>Thomas 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&pg=PA129 pp. 129<U+2013>130].

===Growth of African opposition===
<!--add section after this one on eradication efforts, pledge societies, Mackie, game theory-->Opposition to the colonial attitudes notwithstanding, Africans also began to campaign against FGM. In the 1920s the Egyptian Doctors' Society called for it to be banned, and in December 1928 Egyptian surgeon Ali Ibrahim Pasha, the director of [[Cairo University]], spoke out against it during a medical conference. Opposition in Egypt continued throughout the 1930s to 1950s. A booklet published by ''Al Doktor'' in May 1951 criticized it as hazardous and unnecessary. An Egyptian women's magazine, ''Hawwaa'', published a series of critical articles about it in 1957 and 1958, and the next year it became illegal to perform FGM in any of Egypt's state-run health facilities.<ref>Abd el Salam, S.

===Challenges to the mainstream position===
{{Medical anthropology}}
{{see|The Clash of Civilizations}}
<!--add Yael Tamir; and Ehrenreich and Barr on intersex-->There have been several challenges to the prevailing discourse on FGM. Anthropologist [[Eric Silverman]] writes that the practice is one of the "central moral topics of contemporary anthropology," politically loaded with colonial and post-colonial history.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/25064860 Silverman 2004], pp. 427<U+2013>428.</ref> The international debates often rely on data gathered by anthropologists, who are criticized if they adopt a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralist]] stance rather than defending human rights, while eradicationists stand accused of cultural colonialism.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/25064860 Silverman 2004], p. 420.</ref>

Ugandan law professor [[Sylvia Tamale]] argued in 2011 that the early Western opposition stemmed from a [[Judeo-Christian]], voyeuristic judgment that African sexual culture, including not only FGM but also [[dry sex]], [[polygyny]] and [[levirate marriage]], consisted of primitive practices that required correction.<ref>Tamale 2011, p. 19.</ref> [[Fran Hosken]]'s ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females'' (1979), in particular, was criticized for [[ethnocentrism]] and its insistence on Western intervention.<ref>Abusharaf, Rogaia Mustafa. "Revisiting Feminist Discourses on Inbulation: The Hosken Report," in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&pg=PA160 pp. 160<U+2013>163].</ref> Hosken was uncompromising in her language. She called FGM a "training ground for male violence," saw the women as "mentally castrated" and "participating in the destruction of their own kind," and argued that infibulation "teaches male children that the most extreme forms of torture and brutality against women and girls is their absolute right and what is expected of real men."<ref>Hosken, Fran. ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females'', Women's International Network, 1979, cited in [http://www.iscgmedia.com/uploads/6/0/9/7/6097060/johnsdotter_cvs.pdf Johnsdotter and Ess<U+00E9>n 2010], p. 31.</ref>

[[File:Alice Walker, 1989.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|FGM eradicationists, including novelist [[Alice Walker]], have been criticized for failing to respect the women's own desires and interests.]]
Tamale writes that, following the report's publication, opposition to FGM became an obsession of anthropologists and women's rights activists, who "flocked to the continent with the zeal of missionaries to save African women from this barbaric practice."<ref>Tamale 2011, p. 19, citing Oloka-Onyango and Tamale 1995.</ref> While there is a significant body of African research that opposes FGM, she cautions that African feminists object to what she calls the "imperialist, racist and dehumanising infantilization of African women" inherent in attempts to stem it.<ref>Tamale 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&pg=PA20 p. 20].

African-American feminists have come into conflict too over FGM: [[Stanlie James]] criticized the writer [[Alice Walker]], who has campaigned against it, calling her "'possessed' of the pernicious notion that she can and must rescue those unfortunate women from themselves."<ref name=James2002p89>James, Stanlie M. "Listening to Other(ed) Voices: Reflections around Female Genital Cutting," in Stanlie M. James and Claire C. Robertson (eds.), ''Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood'', University of Illinois Press, 2002, p. 89.</ref>

Anthropologist [[Richard Shweder]] writes of the international consensus against FGM that the accuracy of the factual and moral claims are taken for granted to such an extent that the practice has become an "obvious counterargument to cultural pluralism." He argues that the research may not support this view, citing reviews of the literature on FGM in 1999, 2003 and 2005 by medical anthropologist and epidemiologist [[Carla Obermeyer]].<ref>Shweder 2002, pp. 218<U+2013>219.

And Other Questions About a Rite in Africa"], ''The New York Times'', 5 October 2007.</ref> Obermeyer wrote that her reviews indicated that the more serious medical complications are relatively infrequent.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/649659 Obermeyer 1999], p. 92 (also [http://csde.washington.edu/fogarty/casestudies/shellduncanmaterials/day%202/Obermeyer,%20C.%20%281999%29%20Female%20genital%20surgeries.pdf here]).

Shweder argues that anthropologists who specialize in gender issues in Africa have long been aware of the discrepancies between their own experiences and the global discourse on FGM. He cites a controversial lecture delivered in 1999 to the American Anthropological Association in Chicago, in which Sierra Leonan-American anthropologist [[Fuambai Ahmadu]] challenged the claims that FGM has a negative effect on women's sexuality, and that it stems from unwitting subjugation. On the contrary, Ahmadu argued, the ceremonies and procedures are an embrace of female authority. Ahmudu was herself cut as an adult in Sierra Leone as part of her initiation into the [[Sande society|Bundu]] secret society.<ref>Shweder 2002, pp. 217<U+2013>218.

===Comparison with cosmetic procedures===
Obermeyer argues that FGM may be conducive to women's well-being within their communities in the same way that procedures such as [[breast implant]]s, [[rhinoplasty]] and male circumcision may help people in other cultures.<ref>
[http://www.jstor.org/stable/649659 Obermeyer 1999], p. 94 (also [http://csde.washington.edu/fogarty/casestudies/shellduncanmaterials/day%202/Obermeyer,%20C.%20%281999%29%20Female%20genital%20surgeries.pdf here]).</ref> The WHO does not include cosmetic procedures such as [[labiaplasty]] (reduction of the inner labia), [[vaginoplasty]] (tightening of the vaginal muscles) and [[clitoral hood reduction]] as examples of FGM; the group writes that some elective practices do fall within its categories, but its broad definition aims to avoid loopholes.<ref name=WHOelective>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf WHO 2008], p. 28: "Some practices, such as genital cosmetic surgery and hymen repair, which are legally accepted in many countries and not generally considered to constitute female genital mutilation, actually fall under the definition used here. It has been considered important, however, to maintain a broad definition of female genital mutilation in order to avoid loopholes that might allow the practice to continue."</ref> Gynaecologist Birgitta Ess<U+00E9>n and anthropologist Sara Johnsdotter argue that this is a double standard, with adult African women (for example, those seeking reinfibulation after childbirth) viewed as mutilators trapped in a primitive culture, while other women seeking cosmetic genital surgery are viewed as exercising their right to control their own bodies.<ref>[http://www.hmb.utoronto.ca/HMB303H/Case_Studies/Kenya-FGM/FGM_%26_Cosmetic_Surgery.pdf Ess<U+00E9>n and Johnsdotter 2004], p. 613.

Maibach (eds.), ''The Vulva: Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology'', CRC Press, 2006, [http://books.google.com/books?id=beenEjKmvPwC&pg=PA267 p. 267]: "Given the World Health Organization's definition of female genital mutilation ... then the conclusion that the Western history of female genital surgery should be considered genital mutilation is compelling. More troubling is the realization that the procedures now conducted in the name of elective genital enhancements in Western countries are no less a form of mutilation. Thus, genital mutilation is not a practice peculiar to far-away developing countries."

[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|[[Martha Nussbaum]] argues that the key moral and legal issue with FGM is that it is conducted on children using physical force.]]
Some of the legislation banning FGM would seem to cover cosmetic genital alteration. The law in Sweden, for example, bans operations "on the external female genital organs which are designed to mutilate them or produce other permanent changes in them ... regardless of whether consent ... has or has not been given."<ref>[http://www.iscgmedia.com/uploads/6/0/9/7/6097060/johnsdotter_cvs.pdf Johnsdotter and Ess<U+00E9>n 2010], p. 32.
*In the UK the [[Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003]] says: "A person is guilty of an offence if he excises, infibulates or otherwise mutilates the whole or any part of a girl's labia majora, labia minora or clitoris," unless "necessary for her physical or mental health." Although the legislation refers to girls, it applies to women too. See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/31 "Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003"], legislation.gov.uk, and [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/female_genital_mutilation/#a02 "Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003"] (legal guidance), Crown Prosecution Service: "The Act refers to 'girls', though it also applies to women."</ref> Because anti-FGM laws are not used to stop cosmetic genital procedures, Ess<U+00E9>n and Johnsdotter argue that it seems the law distinguishes between Western and African female genitals, and deems only African women unfit to make their own decisions. Where FGM is banned even if consent is given, physicians may end up having to ask of prospective patients whether they appear to be victims of African patriarchy before deciding whether to offer them genital alteration.<ref name=Johnsdotter2010p32/>

Arguing against these parallels, philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] writes that the key issue with FGM is that it is mostly conducted on children using physical force. She argues that the distinction between social pressure, which might reduce autonomy, and physical force is always morally and legally salient, and is arguably comparable to the distinction between seduction and rape.<ref>Nussbaum 1999, p. 123.</ref> She also argues that the literacy of women in practising countries is generally poorer than that of women in the Western world, and that this <U+2013> together with a lack of political power <U+2013> reduces their ability to make informed choices for themselves and their families.<ref>Nussbaum 1999, pp. 123<U+2013>124.</ref>
