'''William Buckland''' DD [[Royal Society|FRS]] (12 March 1784 <U+2013> 14 August 1856) was an English theologian who became [[Dean of Westminster]]. He was also a geologist and [[paleontology|palaeontologist]], writing the first full account of a [[fossil]] [[dinosaur]], which he named [[Megalosaurus]]. His work proving that [[Kirkdale Cave]] had been a prehistoric [[hyena]] den, for which he was awarded the [[Copley Medal]], was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events from the distant past. He was a pioneer in the use of fossilised faeces, for which he coined the term [[coprolite]]s, to reconstruct ancient ecosystems.

Buckland was a proponent of the [[Gap creationism|Gap Theory]] that interpreted the biblical account of Genesis as referring to two separate episodes of creation separated by a lengthy period; it emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a way to reconcile the scriptural account with discoveries in geology that suggested the earth was very old. Early in his career he believed that he had found geologic evidence of the [[Deluge myth|biblical flood]], but later became convinced that the [[ice age|glaciation theory]] of [[Louis Agassiz]] provided a better explanation, and he played an important role in promoting that theory in Great Britain.

==Early life and university==
[[File:William Buckland bust.JPG|left|thumb|120px|Bust of William Buckland, in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]].]]
Buckland was born at [[Axminster]] in Devon<ref name=EB>Chisholm, 1911</ref> and, as a child, would accompany his father, the Rector of Templeton and Trusham, on his walks where interest in road improvements led to collecting fossil shells, including [[ammonite]]s, from the [[Jurassic]] [[Lias (period)|lias]] rocks exposed in local quarries.

He was educated first at [[Blundell's School]], Tiverton, Devon, and then at [[Winchester College]], from where in 1801 he won a scholarship to study for the ministry at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], also attending the lectures of [[John Kidd (chemist)|John Kidd]] on mineralogy and chemistry, as well as developing an interest in geology and carrying out field research on [[Stratum|strata]], during vacations.<ref name=EB/> Having taken his BA in 1804, he went on to obtain his MA degree in 1808. He then became a [[Fellow]] of Corpus Christi in 1809, was ordained as a priest and continued to make frequent geological excursions, on horseback, to various parts of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. In 1813, he was appointed reader in mineralogy, in succession to [[John Kidd (chemist)|John Kidd]], giving lively and popular lectures with increasing emphasis on geology and palaeontology. As (unofficial) curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], he built up collections, touring Europe and coming into contact with scientists including [[Georges Cuvier]].

==Rejection of flood geology and Kirkdale Cave ==
[[Image:Buckland hyena.jpg|thumb|right| [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] drew this cartoon of Buckland poking his head into a prehistoric hyaena den in 1822 to celebrate Buckland's ground breaking analysis of the fossils found in Kirkdale Cave.<ref name="Rudwick1992_38-42"/>]]
In 1818, Buckland was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. That year he persuaded the [[Prince Regent]] to endow an additional Readership, this time in Geology and he became the first holder of the new appointment, delivering his inaugural address on 15 May 1819. This was published in 1820 as ''Vindici<U+00E6> Geologi<U+00E6>; or the Connexion of Geology with Religion explained'', both justifying the new science of geology and reconciling geological evidence with the [[Bible|biblical]] accounts of [[Creation myth|creation]] and [[Noah's Ark|Noah's Flood]]. At a time when others were coming under the opposing influence of [[James Hutton]]'s theory of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], Buckland developed a new hypothesis that the word "beginning" in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] meant an undefined period between the origin of the earth and the creation of its current inhabitants, during which a long series of extinctions and successive creations of new kinds of plants and animals had occurred. Thus, his [[catastrophism]] theory incorporated a version of [[Old Earth creationism]] or [[Gap creationism]]. Buckland believed in a global deluge during the time of Noah but was not a supporter of [[flood geology]] as he believed that only a small amount of the strata could have been formed in the single year occupied by the deluge.<ref>[http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p82.htm History of the Collapse of Flood Geology and a Young Earth]</ref>

From his investigations of fossil bones at [[Kirkdale Cave]], in [[Yorkshire]], he concluded that the cave had actually been inhabited by [[hyena|hyaenas]] in antediluvian times, and that the fossils were the remains of these hyaenas and the animals they had eaten, rather than being remains of animals that had perished in the Flood and then carried from the tropics by the surging waters, as he and others had at first thought. In 1822 he wrote:

<blockquote>
It must already appear probable, from the facts above described, particularly from the comminuted state and apparently gnawed condition of the bones, that the cave in Kirkdale was, during a long succession of years, inhabited as a den of hyaenas, and that they dragged into its recesses the other animal bodies whose remains are found mixed indiscriminately with their own: this conjecture is rendered almost certain by the discovery I made, of many small balls of the solid calcareous excrement of an animal that had fed on bones... It was at first sight recognised by the keeper of the Menagerie at Exter Change, as resembling, in both form and appearance, the faeces of the spotted or cape hyaena, which he stated to be greedy of bones beyond all other beasts in his care.<ref name="Rudwick1992_38-42">Rudwick, Martin ''Scenes from Deep Time'' (1992) pp. 38<U+2013>42</ref>
</blockquote>

While criticised by some, Buckland's analysis of Kirkland Cave and other bone caves was widely seen as a model for how careful analysis could be used to reconstruct the Earth's past, and the Royal Society awarded Buckland the [[Copley Medal]] in 1822 for his paper on Kirkdale Cave.<ref name="Rudwick2005">Rudwick, Martin ''Bursting The Limits of Time: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Revolution'' (2005) pp. 622<U+2013>638, 631</ref> At the presentation the society's president, [[Humphry Davy]], said:
<blockquote>
by these inquiries, a distinct epoch has, as it were, been established in the history of the revolutions of our globe: a point fixed from which our researches may be pursued through the immensity of ages, and the records of animate nature, as it were, carried back to the time of the creation.<ref name="Rudwick2005"/>
</blockquote>

While Buckland's analysis convinced him that the Bones found in Kirkdale Cave had not been washed into the cave by a global flood, he still believed the thin layer of mud that covered the remains of the hyaena den had been deposited in the subsequent 'Universal Deluge'.<ref name="Rudwick2005"/>  He developed these ideas into his great scientific work ''Reliqui<U+00E6> Diluvian<U+00E6>, or, Observations on the Organic Remains attesting the Action of a Universal Deluge''<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VsoQAAAAIAAJ&dq=william+buckland&ie=ISO-8859-1 ''Reliqui<U+00E6> Diluvian<U+00E6>, or, Observations on the Organic Remains attesting the Action of a Universal Deluge'']</ref> which was published in 1823 and became a best seller. However, over the next decade as geology continued to progress Buckland changed his mind. In his famous Bridgewater Treatise, published in 1836, he acknowledged that the biblical account of Noah's flood could not be confirmed using geological evidence.<ref>Rudwick, Martin ''Worlds Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform'' (2008) p. 427</ref> By 1840 he was very actively promoting the view that what had been interpreted as evidence of the 'Universal Deluge' two decades earlier, and subsequently of deep submergence by a new generation of geologists such as Charles Lyell, was in fact evidence of a major glaciation.

==''Megalosaurus'' and marriage ==

[[File:Buckland family silhouette.jpg|thumb|Buckland family silhouette]] 
He continued to live in Corpus Christi College and, in 1824, he became [[President of the Geological Society of London|president]] of the [[Geological Society of London]]. Here he announced the discovery, at Stonesfield, of fossil bones of a giant reptile which he named [[Megalosaurus]] (''great lizard'') and wrote the first full account of what would later be called a [[dinosaur]].

In 1825, Buckland resigned his college fellowship: he planned to take up the living of [[Stoke Charity]] in Hampshire but, before he could take up the appointment, he was made a [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], a rich reward for academic distinction without serious administrative responsibilities. In December of that year he married [[Mary Buckland|Mary Morland]] of [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], Oxfordshire, an accomplished illustrator and collector of fossils. Their honeymoon was a year touring Europe, with visits to famous geologists and geological sites. She continued to assist him in his work, as well as having nine children, five of whom survived to adulthood. His son [[Francis Trevelyan Buckland|Frank Buckland]] became a well-known practical naturalist, author, and Inspector of Salmon Fisheries. On one occasion, Mary helped him decipher footmarks, found in a slab of sandstone, by covering the kitchen table with paste, while he fetched their pet tortoise and confirmed his intuition, that tortoise footprints matched the fossil marks.

==The Red Lady of Paviland==

On 18 January 1823 Buckland climbed down to [[Paviland Cave]], where he discovered a skeleton which he named the [[Red Lady of Paviland]], as he at first supposed it to be the remains of a local prostitute.<ref>Sommer, Marianne ''Bones and ochre: the curious afterlife of the Red Lady of Paviland'' (2007) p. 1</ref> It is the oldest anatomically modern human found in the United Kingdom. Although he found the skeleton in Paviland Cave in the same strata as the bones of extinct mammals (including [[mammoth]]), Buckland shared the view of [[Georges Cuvier]] that no humans had coexisted with any extinct animals, and he attributed the skeleton's presence there to a grave having been dug in historical times, possibly by the same people who had constructed some nearby pre-Roman fortifications, into the older layers.<ref>Rudwick, Martin ''Worlds Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform'' (2008) pp. 77<U+2013>79</ref> Carbon-data tests have since dated the skeleton, now known to be male as from circa 33,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|years before present (BP)]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2752538 | pmid=19706482 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0903821106 | volume=106 | issue=38 | title=Out of Africa: modern human origins special feature: isotopic evidence for the diets of European Neanderthals and early modern humans |date=September 2009 | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | pages=16034<U+2013>9|bibcode = 2009PNAS..10616034R }}</ref>

==Coprolites and the Liassic food chain==
The fossil hunter [[Mary Anning]] noticed that stony objects known as "[[bezoar]] stones" were often found in the abdominal region of [[ichthyosaur]] skeletons found in the [[Lias Group|Lias]] formation at [[Lyme Regis]]. She also noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales, and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. These observations by Anning led Buckland to propose in 1829 that the stones were fossilised feces. He coined the name [[coprolite]] for them; the name came to be the general name for all fossilised feces. Buckland also concluded that the spiral markings on the fossils indicated that ichthyosaurs had spiral ridges in their intestines similar to those of modern sharks, and that some of these coprolites were black because the ichthyosaur had ingested ink sacs from [[belemnite]]s. He wrote a vivid description of the Liassic food chain based on these observations, which would inspire [[Henry De la Beche]] to paint [[Duria Antiquior]], the first pictorial representation of a scene from the distant past.<ref>Rudwick, Martin ''Worlds Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform'' pp. 154<U+2013>155.</ref> After De le Beche had a lithographic print made based on his original [[watercolour]], Buckland kept a supply of the prints on hand to circulate at his lectures.<ref>Gordon, Mrs [Elizabeth Oke] [http://books.google.com/books?id=2OALAAAAMAAJ&printsec=titlepage&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''The life and correspondence of William Buckland, D.D., F.R.S.''] (1894) pp. 116<U+2013>118</ref> He also discussed other similar objects found in other formations, including the fossilised hyena dung he had found in Kirkdale Cave. He concluded:

<blockquote>In all these various formations our Coprolites form records of warfare, waged by successive generations of inhabitants of our planet on one another: the imperishable phosphate of lime, derived from their digested skeletons, has become embalmed in the substance and foundations of the everlasting hills; and the general law of Nature which bids all to eat and be eaten in their turn, is shown to have been co-extensive with animal existence on our globe; the [[Carnivora]] in each period of the world's history fulfilling their destined office, <U+2013> to check excess in the progress of life, and maintain the balance of creation.<ref>Rudwick, Martin ''Worlds Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform'' p. 155.</ref>
</blockquote>

Buckland had been helping and encouraging [[Roderick Murchison]] for some years, and in 1831 was able to suggest a good starting point in South Wales for Murchison's researches into the rocks beneath the secondary strata associated with the [[mesozoic|age of reptiles]]. Murchison would later name these older strata, characterised by marine invertebrate fossils, as [[Silurian]], after a tribe that had lived in that area centuries earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=192<U+2013>193}}</ref> In 1832 Buckland presided over the second meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]], which was then held at Oxford.

==Bridgewater Treatise ==

Buckland was commissioned to contribute one of the set of eight ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'', "On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation". This took him almost five years' work and was published in 1836 with the title [http://books.google.com/books?id=MR4HAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=william+buckland&ie=ISO-8859-1 ''Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology'']. His volume included a detailed compendium of his theories of day-age, gap theory and a form of [[progressive creationism]] where [[faunal succession]] revealed by the fossil record was explained by a series of successive divine creations that prepared the earth for humans.<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=190<U+2013>196}}</ref> In the introduction he expressed the [[argument from design]] by asserting that the families and phyla of biology were "clusters of contrivance":
<blockquote>''The myriads of petrified Remains which are disclosed by the researches of Geology all tend to prove that our Planet has been occupied in times preceding the Creation of the Human Race, by extinct species of Animals and Vegetables, made up, like living Organic Bodies, of 'Clusters of Contrivances,' which demonstrate the exercise of stupendous Intelligence and Power. They further show that these extinct forms of Organic Life were so closely allied, by Unity in the principles of their construction, to Classes, Orders, and Families, which make up the existing Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms, that they not only afford an argument of surpassing force, against the doctrines of the Atheist and Polytheist; but supply a chain of connected evidence, amounting to demonstration, of the continuous Being, and of many of the highest Attributes of the One Living and True God.''</blockquote>

Following [[Charles Darwin]]'s return from the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' voyage]], Buckland discussed with him the [[Galapagos land iguana]]s and [[Marine iguana]]s.<ref name=Letter359>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-359.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project <U+2013> Letter 359 <U+2013> Darwin, C. R. to Buckland, William, (15 June 1837)|accessdate=23 December 2008}}</ref> He subsequently recommended Darwin's paper on the role of [[earthworm]]s in [[Pedogenesis|soil formation]] for publication, praising it as "a new & important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence on the surface of the Earth<U+2014>in fact a new Geological Power", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.<ref name=Letter404>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project <U+2013> Letter 404 <U+2013> Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838 |accessdate=23 December 2008}}</ref>

==Glaciation theory ==

By this time Buckland was a prominent and influential scientific celebrity and a friend of the [[Tory]] prime minister, Sir [[Robert Peel]]. In co-operation with [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Charles Lyell]], he prepared the report leading to the establishment of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.

Having become interested in the theory of [[Louis Agassiz]], that polished and striated rocks as well as transported material, had been caused by ancient glaciers, he travelled to [[Switzerland]], in 1838, to meet Agassiz and see for himself. He was convinced and was reminded of what he had seen in Scotland, Wales and northern England but had previously attributed to the Flood. When Agassiz came to Britain for the [[Glasgow]] meeting of the British Association, in 1840, they went on an extended tour of Scotland and found evidence there of former glaciation. In that year Buckland had become president of the Geological Society again and, despite their hostile reaction to his presentation of the theory, he was now satisfied that glaciation had been the origin of much of the surface deposits covering Britain.

In 1845 he was appointed by Sir Robert Peel to the vacant [[List of Deans of Westminster|Deanery of Westminster]] (he succeeded [[Samuel Wilberforce]]). Soon after, he was inducted to the living of [[Islip, Oxfordshire|Islip]], near Oxford, a preferment attached to the deanery. As Dean and head of Chapter, Buckland was involved in repair and maintenance of [[Westminster Abbey]] and in preaching suitable sermons to the rural population of Islip, while continuing to lecture on geology at Oxford. In 1847, he was appointed a trustee in the [[British Museum]] and, in 1848, he was awarded the [[Wollaston Medal]], by the Geological Society of London.

==Illness and death ==
Around the end of 1850, he contracted tuberculosis, and he died of it in 1856.{{citation needed|reason=Frank Buckland died of tuberculosis, lungcancer or... The cause of William Buckland's death is obviously obscure: In 1849 he got ill (aphatic and depressed) and it grew worse until his death. I guess there is a mix-up between father and son here, especially as the reference is a biography, to which I don't have access, about the son.|date=January 2015}}<ref>Burgess G.H.O. 1967. ''The curious world of Frank Buckland''. Baker, London. p67</ref> The plot for his grave had been reserved but, when the gravedigger set to work, it was found that an outcrop of solid [[Jurassic]] limestone lay just below ground level and explosives had to be used for excavation. This may have been a last jest by the noted geologist, reminiscent of Richard Whatley's ''Elegy intended for Professor Buckland'' written in 1820:

:Where shall we our great Professor inter
:That in peace may rest his bones?
:If we hew him a rocky sepulchre
:He'll rise and break the stones
:And examine each stratum that lies around
:For he's quite in his element underground

==Known eccentricities==
Buckland preferred to do his field palaeontology and geological work wearing an [[academic gown]].<ref name=ODNB>{{Harvnb|Haile|2007}}</ref> His lectures were notable for their dramatic delivery.<ref name="oumBuckland">[http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/learning/pdfs/buckland.pdf "Learning More<U+2026> William Buckland"  Oxford University Museum ]</ref>

Buckland's passion for scientific observation and experiment extended to his home, where he had a table inlaid with dinosaur coprolites. The original table top is exhibited at the Lyme Regis Museum.<ref>[http://www.lymeregismuseum.co.uk/images/stories/research/buckland.pdf "William Buckland's Coprolite Table" Lyme Regis Museum]</ref><ref name="bp news">[http://www.bridportnews.co.uk/news/localnews/10579424.19th_century_table_created_out_of_fossil_poo_recreated_for_descendants_of_original_owner/ Harry Hogger "19th century table created out of fossil poo recreated for descendants of original owner" ''Bridport News" 30 July 2013]</ref>

Not only was William Buckland's home filled with specimens <U+2013> animal as well as mineral, live as well as dead <U+2013> but he claimed to have eaten his way through the animal kingdom: zo<U+00F6>phagy. The most distasteful items were [[Mole (animal)|mole]] and [[bluebottle fly]];<ref>{{citation

The [[raconteur]] [[Augustus Hare]] claimed that "Talk of strange relics led to mention of the heart of a French King preserved at Nuneham in a silver casket. Dr. Buckland, whilst looking at it, exclaimed, 'I have eaten many strange things, but have never eaten the heart of a king before', and, before anyone could hinder him, he had gobbled it up, and the precious relic was lost for ever." The heart in question is said to have been that of [[Louis XIV]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Birk |first=Aaron |author2=Robert Krulwich  |title=Who Wants To Eat Jellyfish Omelets? Dolphin Meatballs?

==Legacy==

[[Dorsum Buckland]], a wrinkle ridge on the [[Moon]], is named after him. Buckland Island (known today as Ani-Jima), in the [[Bonin Islands]] (Ogasawara-Jima), was named after him by Captain Beechey on 9 June 1827.
