==Biography==
===Early years===

Verne Ralph Smith was born May 8, 1892, in [[Alila, California]], the son of a [[dairy farm|dairy farmer]]. He attended public school in [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]] and graduated as the [[valedictorian]] of his class.<ref name="ALWW">Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole, ''The American Labor Who's Who.'' New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 216.</ref> Smith, one of 4 children, spent his youth working on the family farm in the [[San Joaquin Valley]], leaving for school at the age of 20.<ref name="Garlin">Sender Garlin, "Vern Smith is New 'Daily' Correspondent in USSR," ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 10, no. 203 (August 24, 1933), pg. 6.</ref>

Smith attended the [[University of California]] at [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], from which he graduated in 1916 with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[Economics]]. While at Berkeley, Smith was the secretary of his school's chapter of the [[Intercollegiate Socialist Society]] and president fo the California International Cosmopolitan Club.<ref name="ALWW" />

During the years of [[World War I|First World War]], Smith was a [[Second Lieutenant]] of the [[infantry]] in the Officers' Reserve, but was never ordered to active duty.<ref name="Garlin" /> He worked variously as a farm hand, construction worker, and storekeeper.<ref name="ALWW" />

===Journalistic career===

Smith travelled east, working a job in the [[Kansas]] wheat fields. In 1921 he joined the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) as a member of [[Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union, No. 110]].<ref name="Garlin" /> He later followed the harvest to [[Canada]], before heading for [[Seattle, Washington]], where he became editor of the IWW's west coast newspaper, ''[[The Industrial Worker]].''<ref name="Garlin" />

Smith joined the local "Marxian Club" in Seattle in 1922 <U+2014> this at a time when the [[Communist Party of America]] was a secret ("underground") organization. Smith later recalled:

<blockquote>
"I read [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'' and decided that the Communists probably had the right idea and joined the Marxian Club. This club was a legal group in Seattle under the influence of the underground Communist Parties. I never got into the underground movement, but went with the club into the Workers Party when the club joined the Party in a body immediately after the organization of the Workers Party [in December 1921]."<ref name="Garlin" /></blockquote>

When the IWW turned against the Communists in 1922, Smith remained in the union under the direction of the Workers Party in Seattle.<ref name="Garlin" /> Smith remained as editor of the paper until June of 1923, at which time the IWW sent him to [[Chicago]] to edit the organization's primary English-language newspaper, ''[[Industrial Solidarity]].''<ref name="Garlin" /> He was also the assistant manage of the IWW's Educational Bureau in 1924.<ref name="ALWW" />

Smith was exposed as a secret member of the Workers (Communist) Party in 1926 and fired from his position as editor of ''Industrial Solidarity.'' He was immediately taken onto the staff of the Communist Party's daily newspaper, ''[[The Daily Worker]],'' also published in Chicago at the time.<ref name="Garlin" /> When the paper moved to [[New York City]] in 1927, Smith moved with it, remaining on the staff for the rest of the 1920s and throughout most of the 1930s, save for a 7 month period when he was made editor of ''[[Labor Unity]],'' the monthly magazine of the [[Trade Union Unity League]], an affiliate of the Communist Party.<ref name="Garlin" />

During the [[Harlan County, Kentucky]] mine strikes of the early 1930s, Smith was dispatched to the area as ''The Daily Worker's'' correspondent. Smith was arrested along with a number of strike organizers and relief workers and was incarcerated for four months in the Harlan County jail, the last 31 days of which were in solitary confinement.<ref name="Garlin" />

In August 1933, Smith was made the Moscow correspondent of ''The Daily Worker.'' During his stint there, he wrote two books highly favorable to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet system]], one dealing with coal miners in the [[Donets Basin]] and the other with workers on a Soviet [[collective farm]].

Smith returned to California after his time in Moscow, as labor editor and foreign editor of the CP's California newspaper, the ''[[People's Daily World]].''<ref name="Costello">Paul Costello, [http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/1946-1956/costello01.htm "Anti-Revisionist Communism in the United States, 1945-1950,"] ''Theoretical Review'' No. 11, July-August 1979, pps. 10-17.</ref> He also taught in [[San Francisco]] at the Tom Mooney Labor School, a Communist Party educational project.

Smith was expelled from the Communist Party in 1946 during the party's crackdown on so-called [[anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]] [[left wing]] factional dissidents.<ref name="Costello" />
