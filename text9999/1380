'''"My Kind of Town"''' or '''"My Kind of Town (Chicago Is)"''' is a popular [[song]] composed by [[Jimmy Van Heusen]], with lyrics by [[Sammy Cahn]].<ref name=SL>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Frank-Sinatra/My-Kind-Of-Town.html|accessdate=2007-09-26|title=Frank Sinatra My Kind Of Town Lyrics|publisher=SeekLyrics.com|date=2007}}</ref> It was originally part of the musical score for ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'', a 1964 musical film starring several members of the [[Rat Pack]].<ref>Shapiro, Nat and Bruce Pollock (eds.), "Popular Music 1920-1979, (A Revised Cumulation)" Volume 2: Song Listing J-T, 1985, Gale Research Company, ISBN 0-8103-0847-9.</ref> It was nominated for the 1964 [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] but lost to "[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]" from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.<ref name=1964Oscar>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1190839931934|accessdate=2007-09-26|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|title=1964 (37th) - MUSIC (Song)}}</ref> Although the song predated the [[Grammy Award]] Best Original Song for a Motion Picture category, the entire score was nominated for the 1964 Grammy Award in the category [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Best Original Score Written for A Motion Picture]], but it lost to the eponymously titled ''Mary Poppins'' score.<ref name=STME>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-main-event.eu/musik/grammyawards/19647thgrammyawards.html|accessdate=2007-10-01|publisher=Sinatra - The Main Event|title=1964 - 7th Grammy Awards|date=1999}}</ref>

[[Frank Sinatra]] has recorded several versions which have appeared on many of his albums. Also, many artists have performed the song as a tribute to Sinatra in posthumous [[tribute album]]s. In addition, the song had been recorded by many other artists prior to Sinatra's death. The lyrics, which praise the city of [[Chicago]] for its people and institutions, repeat the phrase My Kind of Town several times, usually in a line that says "My kind of town, Chicago is".

==Versions==
Popularized by Sinatra, "My Kind of Town" was originally recorded on [[April 8]] [[1964]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The official [[B-side]] song was "I Like To Lead When I Dance". The song was recorded as a [[Gramophone record|45]] on [[Reprise Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songsbysinatra.com/records/singles.html|accessdate=2007-09-26|publisher=Tom Rednour & Wordcrafters Graphic Design|date=2000-07-31|title=Songs by Sinatra}}</ref>  The sheet music was copyrighted and published by Sergeant Music Co., Glorste Inc. and Van Heusen Music Corp. The music is written in the [[key (music)|key]] of A-flat, in 2/2 [[meter (music)|meter]] (known as [[cut time]]) with an [[allegro]] [[tempo (music)|tempo]].<ref>Cahn, Sammy and Jimmy Van Heusen, "My Kind of Town", 1964, Sergeant Music Co., Glorste Inc. and Van Heusen Music Corp.</ref>

Sinatra recorded "My Kind of Town" twice in a studio setting, and two live versions were officially released, on ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Main Event <U+2013> Live]]'' (1974).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://songsbysinatra.com/songs/a2z/a2z_main.html|accessdate=2007-09-26|publisher=Tom Rednour & Wordcrafters Graphic Design|date=2000-07-31|title=Songs by Sinatra: Songs A2Z}}</ref>  One of the more famous [[bootleg recording]] is a [[May 22]] [[1968]] concert at the [[Oakland Coliseum]].<ref name=OCC/> On the 1966 album ''Sinatra at the Sands'', the song appears both as the 20th and 22nd (final) track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Sinatra-Sands-Frank-Count-Orchestra/dp/B000006OBQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3506741-5283202?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1190914672&sr=8-1|accessdate=2007-09-27 |title=Sinatra at the Sands|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.}}</ref> However, the final track is merely a one-minute reprise. On the 1994 album ''[[Duets II]]'', Sinatra sings with his son, [[Frank Sinatra, Jr.]], as the 13th of 14 tracks with a length of 2:36.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Duets-II-Frank-Sinatra/dp/B000002TO1/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3506741-528320=2?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1190767576&sr=1-1|accessdate=2007-09-26|title=Duets II |publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.}}</ref>

Sinatra would occasionally alter the lyrics slightly. In early version, when the [[Union Stock Yards]] (which closed in 1971) still existed, one of the final lines was "The Union Stockyard, Chicago is".<ref name=SL/> In later versions, this line is replaced with "The [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Cubbies]], Chicago is".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waste.org/bauhaus/l/mykindoftown.html|title=My Kind Of Town|accessdate=2007-09-26|publisher=waste.org}}</ref>

The song also appears on ''The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live & Swingin'' a 2003 DVD and CD release of the 1965 "Frank Sinatra Spectacular" benefit concert. However, since the concert takes place in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], St. Louis is substituted for Chicago as the town in Sinatra's affections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Rat-Pack-Collection-Swingin/dp/B0000CF342/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3506741-5283202?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1190917966&sr=1-1|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher =Amazon.com, Inc.|title=The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live & Swingin (CD & DVD)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404206/|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=Internet Movie Database Inc.|title=Live and Swingin': The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection}}</ref>
