An '''isotopically pure diamond''' is type of [[diamond]] that is composed entirely of one [[isotope]] of [[carbon]].  Isotopically pure diamonds have been [[synthetic diamond|manufactured]] from either the more common carbon isotope with [[mass number]] 12 (abbreviated as [[carbon-12|<sup>12</sup>C]]) or the less common [[carbon-13|<sup>13</sup>C]] isotope.  Compared to natural diamonds that are composed of a mixture of <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C isotopes, isotopically pure diamonds possess improved characteristics such as increased [[thermal conductivity]].<ref name "Anthony_1992">{{cite journal | author = Anthony TR, Banholzer | volume = 1 | issue = 5-6 | year = 1992 | month = April | pages = 717-726 | journal =  Diamond and Related Materials | doi = 10.1016/0925-9635(92)90197-V | title = Properties of diamond with varying isotopic composition }}</ref>  Thermal conductivity of isotopically enriched diamonds is at a minimum when <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C are in a ratio of 1:1 and reaches a maximum when the composition is 100% <sup>12</sup>C or 100% <sup>13</sup>C .<ref name "Anthony_1992"/>

The isotopes of carbon can be separated in the form of [[carbon dioxide]] gas by cascaded chemical exchange reactions with amine carbamate.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Takeshita K, Ishidaa M | volume = 31 | issue = 15 | year = 2006 | month = December | pages = 3097<U+2013>3107 | journal = ECOS 2004 - 17th International Conference on Efficiency, Costs, Optimization, Simulation, and Environmental Impact of Energy on Process Systems | doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2006.04.002 | title = Optimum design of multi-stage isotope separation process by exergy analysis}}</ref> Such CO<sub>2</sub> can be converted to methane and from there to isotopically pure [[synthetic diamonds]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Carbon | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | year = 1996 | month = November | pages = 1323<U+2013>1328 | title = Graphite rod precursors for isotopically pure fullerenes and diamond | author=Anthony TR, Bradley JC, Horoyski PJ,  Thewal MLW | doi=10.1016/S0008-6223(96)00060-7}}</ref> Isotopically enriched diamonds have been synthesized by application of [[chemical vapor deposition]] followed by [[high pressure]].<ref name "Anthony_1992"/>

=== Carbon 12 ===

The <sup>12</sup>C isotopically pure, (or in practice 15-fold enrichment of isotopic number, 12 over 13 for carbon) diamond gives a 50% higher [[thermal conductivity]] than the already high value of 900-2000 [[Watt|W]]/([[Metre|m]]<U+00B7>[[Kelvin|K]]) for a normal diamond, which contains the natural isotopic mixture of 98.9% <sup>12</sup>C and 1.1% <sup>13</sup>C. This is useful for heat sinks for the [[semiconductor]] industry.<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the thermal conductivity of diamond under changes to its isotopic character | author = Bray JW, Anthony TR | year = 1991 | month =  February | journal = Z.

=== Carbon 13 ===

Isotopically pure <sup>13</sup>C diamond layers 20 micrometers thick are used as stress sensors due to the advantageous [[Raman spectroscopy]] properties of <sup>13</sup>C.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Qiu W, Velisavljevic N, Baker PA, Vohra YK, Weir ST | title = Isotopically pure 13C layer as a stress sensor in a diamond anvil cell | journal = Appl.
