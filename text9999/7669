The '''Palace of Charles V''' is a [[Renaissance|Renacentist]] construction in [[Granada]], southern [[Spain]], located on the top of the hill of the Assabica, inside the [[Nasrid]] fortification of the [[Alhambra]]. It was commanded by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], who wished to establish his residence close to the Alhambra palaces. Although the [[Catholic Monarchs]] had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in [[1492]], Charles V intended to construct a permanent residence befitting an [[emperor]]. The project was given to [[Pedro Machuca]], an architect whose biography and influences are poorly understood. At the time, Spanish architecture was immersed in the [[Plateresque]] style, still with traces of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] origin. Machuca built a palace corresponding stylistically to [[Mannerism]], a mode still in its infancy in [[Italy]]. The exterior of the building uses a typically Renaissance combination of [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] on the lower level and [[ashlar]] on the upper. Even if accounts that place Machuca in the atelier of [[Michelangelo]] are accepted, at the time of the construction of the palace in 1527 the latter had yet to design the majority of his architectural works.

The plan of the palace is a 63 meter [[square (geometry)|square]] containing an inner circular [[patio]]. This structure, the main Mannerist characteristic of the palace, has no precedent in [[Renaissance architecture]], and places the building in the [[avant-garde]] of its time. The palace has two floors (not counting [[mezzanine floor]]s). On the exterior, the lower is of a padded [[Tuscan order]], while the upper is of the [[ionic order]], alternating [[pilaster]]s and [[pediment]]ed windows. Both main fa<U+00E7>ades boast portals made of stone from the [[Sierra Elvira]].

The circular patio has also two levels. The lower consists of a [[doric order|doric]] [[colonnade]] of conglomerate stone, with an orthodox classical entablature formed of [[triglyph]]s and [[Metope (architecture)|metope]]s. The upper floor is formed by a stylized ionic colonnade whose [[entablature]] has no decoration. This organisation of the patio shows a deep knowledge of the architecture of the [[Roman Empire]], and would be framed in pure Renaissance style but for its curved shape, which surprises the visitor entering from the main fa<U+00E7>ades. The interior spaces and the staircases are also governed by the combination of square and circle. Similar aesthetic devices would be developed in the following decades under the classification of Mannerism.
