'''Acton Town''' is a [[London Underground]] station in the south-west corner of [[Acton, London|Acton]] of the [[London Borough of Ealing]], west [[London]]. The station is served by the [[District line|District]] and [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]] lines and is in [[List of stations in London fare zone 3|Travelcard Zone 3]].<ref name=tubemap>{{cite map/Standard Tube Map}}</ref> On the District line, it is between [[Chiswick Park tube station|Chiswick Park]] and [[Ealing Common tube station|Ealing Common]] stations, and on the Piccadilly line it is between [[Hammersmith tube station (Piccadilly and District lines)|Hammersmith]] ([[Turnham Green tube station|Turnham Green]] in the early mornings and late evenings) and Ealing Common stations.<ref name=tubemap />

Acton Town station was opened as Mill Hill Park on 1 July 1879 by the [[District Railway]] (DR, now the District line).<ref name=architecture>{{cite web |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=508142 |work=Pastscape |title=Detailed Result:Acton Town Station |publisher= [[Historic England]] |accessdate=12 April 2015 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150412033144/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=508142 |archivedate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}</ref> It remained as a terminus until on 1 May 1883 and 23 June 1903 the DR opened two branches from Acton Town to [[Hounslow Town tube station|Hounslow Town]] and [[Park Royal & Twyford Abbey tube station|Park Royal & Twyford Abbey]] respectively. On 4 July 1932 the Piccadilly line was extended to Acton Town. District line services to both the Hounslow and Uxbridge branches were withdrawn completely on 9 and 10 October 1964 after which operations were provided by the Piccadilly line alone.

The original brick-built station was built in 1879 and in February 1910 the station building was reconstructed.<ref name=architecture /> On 1 March 1910 the station was given its present name.<ref name=architecture /> In 1931 and 1932 the station was rebuilt again in preparation for transferring the Uxbridge branch service from the District line to the Piccadilly line.<ref name=architecture /> The new station was designed by [[Charles Holden]]<ref name=architecture /> in a modern European geometric style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass.<ref name="eh_1263471" />

===District line===
====Hounslow and Uxbridge branches====
Acton Town station was opened as Mill Hill Park on 1 July 1879{{sfn|Glinert|2012}} by the [[District Railway]] (DR, now the District line) on its extension from Turnham Green to Ealing Broadway.<ref name=architecture /><ref name=culgdistrict>{{cite web |url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/district.html |work=Clive's Underground Line Guides |title=District line |last=Feather |first=Clive |accessdate=22 March 2015 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150403112633/http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/district.html |archivedate=3 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}</ref> On 1 May 1883 the DR opened a branch from Acton Town to the now defunct [[Hounslow Town tube station|Hounslow Town station]], which developed into the Heathrow branch.<ref name=culgdistrict /> On 23 June 1903 the DR tracks extended north of Acton Town to a new station at [[Park Royal & Twyford Abbey tube station|Park Royal & Twyford Abbey]] which became the first of the Underground's surface lines to use electric traction instead of steam with the Acton Town <U+2014> Ealing Common section also electrified.<ref name=culgdistrict /> The existing deep tube lines, ([[City and South London Railway]], [[Waterloo & City line|Waterloo & City Railway]] (now Waterloo & City line) and [[Central London Railway]]) had always been electrically powered.{{sfn|Greathead|1896|p=7}}<ref name=culgw&c>{{cite web |url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/waterloo.html |work=Clive's Underground Line Guides |title=Waterloo & City line |last=Feather |first=Clive |accessdate=12 April 2015 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150412031513/http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/waterloo.html |archivedate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}</ref>{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=56}} Services on the Hounslow branch (now the Heathrow branch) and to Central London were electrified on 13 June 1905 and 1 July 1905 respectively.<ref name=culgdistrict />

====South Acton branch====
[[File:Acton Town stn eastbound District look west.JPG|thumb|right|Eastbound District line platform looking west with the remains of the branch on the right]]
On 13 June 1905 passenger service began on the short branch to [[South Acton railway station|South Acton]].<ref name=culgdistrict /><ref name=sact>{{cite web |url=http://www.abandonedstations.org.uk/South_Acton_station.html |title=District line <U+2014> South Acton to Acton Town |work=Abandoned Stations |accessdate=22 March 2015 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150414101156/http://www.abandonedstations.org.uk/South_Acton_station.html |archivedate=14 April 2015}}</ref> A short fifth platform for the single car train of the South Acton branch was provided to the north of the eastbound island platform.<ref name=sact /> At first the service ran to [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow West]] and to [[Uxbridge tube station|Uxbridge]] but it was later reduced to a shuttle between Acton Town and South Acton on 15 February 1932.<ref name=culgdistrict /><ref name=sact />{{#tag:ref|The branch was also known as the "There and back while the kettle boils" branch because of the short distance and quick turnaround at South Acton.<ref name=culgdistrict />|group=note}} The South Acton branch was closed on 28 February 1959 due to low usage;<ref name=culgdistrict /> its platform at Acton Town has been removed and little of the branch remains except a bridge support on the south side of Bollo Lane<ref name=sact /> and hidden remains at the station.

===Piccadilly line===
On 4 July 1932 the Piccadilly line was extended west from its original terminus at Hammersmith and shared the route with the District line to Ealing Common.<ref name=architecture /><ref name=culgpiccadilly /> From Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line was replaced by the Piccadilly line, and from that date, District line trains from Acton Town ran only either to Hounslow West or to Ealing Broadway.<ref name=culgpiccadilly /> On 9 January 1933 Piccadilly line trains, sharing with the District line, began serving [[Northfields tube station|Northfields]] on the Hounslow branch, and their service was extended to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933 but Piccadilly line trains did not call at South Ealing until 1935.<ref name=culgpiccadilly /> District line services on the Hounslow branch were withdrawn on 9 and 10 October 1964 after which operations were provided by the Piccadilly line alone.<ref name=culgdistrict />
