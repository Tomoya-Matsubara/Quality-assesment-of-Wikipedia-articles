Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].

In the reserve race, Cambridge's [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] defeated Oxford's Isis in a record time, while Cambridge won the [[Women's Boat Race]].

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 12 July 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  First held in 1829, the race takes place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 12 July 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/tv-and-radio | title = TV and radio | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref>  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1995|1995 race]] by four lengths,<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/results| publisher =The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref> with Cambridge leading overall with 72 victories to Oxford's 68 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatrace.org/men/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref>

The first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s.  The race is conducted as part of the [[Henley Boat Races]], but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/history | title = A brief history of the Women's Boat Race | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 9 July 2014}}</ref>  The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965.  It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.<ref name=results/>

The previous year's race was watched by seven million viewers in the United Kingdom alone.  Oxford coach [[Daniel Topolski|Dan Topolski]] suggested part of the appeal was the fact the contest was "absolutely amateur" but still "represents quality."<ref name=dream/>  Former Oxford [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] and Olympic gold medallist [[Jonny Searle]] agreed, calling the Boat Race "a unique experience."<ref name=dream/>  Both Topolski and Searle predicted a close race, Cambridge coach [[Robin Williams (rowing coach)|Robin Williams]] agreed: "We've got to accord Oxford some respect.  I think we're again the better crew ... but the only way to find out is on the water."<ref name=dream/> [[Penny Chuter]], one of the other Oxford coaches, noted "Cambridge have a continuity ... but we have more power this year."<ref name=dream/>  Cambridge's boat club president John Carver had earlier withdrawn from the race with injury.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rowing-carver-withdraws-from-boat-race-1340475.html | work = [[The Independent]] | title = Rowing: Carver withdraws from Boat Race | first = Hugh | last = Matheson | date = 5 March 1996 | accessdate = 15 July 2014}}</ref>  Oxford's director of rowing, Steve Royle, said of his crew: "these guys love a scrap."<ref name=fluency/>

The 250 officers from [[Wandsworth Parks Police|Wandsworth Police]] lining the embankments were able to replace their traditional helmets for peaked caps for the first time, in order to discourage members of the crowd from removing them and throwing them into the river.<ref>{{Citation | title = Helmets off for fans of Bertie Wooster | first = Oliver | last = Auugst | work = [[The Times]] | date = 6 April 1996 | page = 1 | issue = 65547}}</ref>  The race was sponsored for the tenth consecutive year by [[Beefeater Gin]], and umpired by former Cambridge Blue Mike Sweeney.<ref name=dom>{{Cite news | title = Story of Light Blue dominance set to run and run| work = [[The Times]] | first = David | last =Miller | date = 8 April 1996 | page = 21 | issue = 65548}}</ref><ref name=key>{{ Cite news | title = Key may be reserves of strength| work = [[The Times]] | first = Mike | last =Rosewell | date = 8 April 1996 | page = 21 | issue = 65548}}</ref>
