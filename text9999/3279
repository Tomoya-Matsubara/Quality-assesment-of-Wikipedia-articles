'''''The Mystery of a Hansom Cab''''' is a [[mystery fiction]] [[novel]] by English writer [[Fergus Hume]]. 

==Author==
Originally from Britain, Fergus Hume worked as a [[barrister's clerk]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] at the time of the book's first publication.<ref name="companion" /> Hume would go on to become a prolific writer, authoring more than 130 additional novels in fiction subjects including [[science fiction]] and adventure.<ref name="companion" /><ref name="lyons">{{cite book|title=A History of the Book in Australia 1891-1945: A National Culture in a Colonised Market |first=Martyn |last=Lyons|coauthors= John Arnold|pages=241-243|year=2001|publisher=University of Queensland Press|isbn=0702232343}}</ref><ref name="davies">{{cite book|title=Vintage Mystery and Detective Stories|first=David Stuart |last=Davies|pages=15-17, 1059, 1063|year=2006|publisher=Wordsworth Editions Ltd|isbn=1840220651}}</ref>

==Plot==
The story of ''The Mystery of a Hansom Cab'' takes place in Melbourne, Australia, and involves an investigation into a [[homicide]] where the deceased was discovered in the evening inside of a [[taxicab]]. The city of Melbourne is itself a significant factor in the plot and setting, and is described by the author: "Over all the great city hung a clould of smoke like a pall."<ref name="stuart">{{cite book|first= Stuart |last=Macintyre|title=A Concise History of Australia |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=0521516080|pages=111-113}}</ref> Throughout the novel the influential and secretive Frettbly family is a key element, and it is revealed later in the book that they have an illegitimate daughter living on the streets. The name of the killer himself is not as much of a significant revelation in the story, as is the role of the Frettbly family and their secret. The class divide between the wealthy and less fortunate of the city of Melbourne is juxtaposed throughout the plot.<ref name="parrinder" /> The [[protagonist]] in the novel is a law enforcement official named Detective Gorby, who is tasked with solving the murder.<ref name="pierce" /> Hume uses descriptive text to describe the character's investigative skills: "He looked keenly round the room, and his estimate of the dead man's character was formed at once."<ref name="pierce" /> The author commented in a later introduction, "All of the scenes in the book, especially the slums, are described from personal observation; and I passed a great many nights in Little Bourke Street, gathering material".<ref name="companion" /> 

==Publication history==
''The Mystery of a Hansom Cab'' was first published in Melbourne, Australia, in 1886, and subsequently published in Britain in 1887.<ref name="companion">{{cite book|title=A Companion to Crime Fiction|first=Charles J.|last= Rzepka|coauthors= Lee Horsley|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=1405167653|pages=107-109}}</ref> The author self-published the first edition of the novel.<ref name="davies" /><ref name="birns">{{cite book|first=Nicholas |last=Birns|coauthors= Rebecca McNeer|pages=391-393|title=A Companion to Australian Literature since 1900|publisher=Camden House|year=2007|isbn=1571133496}}</ref> Hume wrote an introduction to a revised edition published in 1898.<ref name="companion" />
