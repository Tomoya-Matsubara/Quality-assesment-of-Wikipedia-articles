'''Severe Tropical Cyclone Susan''' was one of [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#South Pacific Ocean|the most intense tropical cyclones]] on record within the [[Tropical cyclone basins#South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific basin]], which was first noted on December 20, 1997, as a weak [[tropical disturbance]] located to the north of [[American Samoa]]. Over the next 12 days, the disturbance remained weak while it gradually moved towards the southwest before it started to rapidly develop on January 2, 1998 while it was located near the [[Fiji]]an dependency of [[Rotuma]]. The disturbance was declared a [[tropical cyclone]] later that day, but was not [[Tropical cyclone naming|named]] Susan until the next day, after it had intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone on the [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|Australian Scale]]. Over the next few days, Susan moved towards the southwest and continued to intensify before it reached its peak intensities as a [[Tropical cyclone scales|category five tropical cyclone]] during January 5 while it was located about {{Convert|400|km|mi|disp=5|abbr=on}} to the northwest of [[Vanuatu]]'s [[capital city]] [[Port Vila]].

At this stage as the cyclone was moving towards the southwest it posed a severe threat to Vanuatu however, during that day Susan recurved towards the southeast and subsequently spared Vanuatu a direct hit. After sparing Vanuatu a direct hit, Susan started to accelerate towards the southeast and while starting to weaken significantly passed close enough to Fiji during January 7 and 8 to cause [[Beaufort scale|gale force winds]] in Fiji's southern and western islands. While continuing to move towards the southeast, Susan started to interact with [[Cyclone Ron|Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron]] during January 8 before it absorbed Ron by 0600&nbsp;UTC the next day and starting to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of the combined systems were then monitored for another day until they were last noted on January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to [[New Zealand]]. Despite sparing Vanuatu and Fiji direct hits, heavy rain and gale force winds associated with Susan were reported to have caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan and Fijian islands. These islands included [[Viti Levu]] where a possible [[tornado]] destroyed the roof of a shopping centre and the Vanuatuan island of [[Aoba Island|Ambrym]], where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with.

Late on January 6, RSMC Nadi issued a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Australia and the South Pacific|tropical cyclone alert]] for Fiji, while Susan was located about {{convert|600|km|mi|disp=5|abbr=on}} to the west of [[Nadi, Fiji]].<ref name="Susan Prem report"/> The alert stated that Susan, was expected to pass as close as {{convert|300|km|mi|disp=5|abbr=on}} to the southwest of [[Viti Levu]] during the next day.<ref name="Susan Prem report"/> It also warned that there was a chance that the cyclone would curve more towards the east-southeast and bring gale force or stronger winds over Fiji.<ref name="Susan Prem report"/> Early the next day as squally strong north to north-easterly winds were starting to affect Fiji, RSMC Nadi upgraded the alert to a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Australia and the South Pacific|gale warning]] for [[Vatulele]], [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]], western and south-western [[Viti Levu]] and the [[Yasawa]] and [[Mamanuca]] island groups.<ref name="Susan Prem report"/>

On January 7 and 8, Susan passed close enough to Fiji, to cause some minor coastal damage to several southern and western Fijian islands, including on the main island of Viti Levu.<ref name="1997-98 BoM"/> The cyclone also brought with it some beneficial rainfall which helped to ease the drought conditions that were present in Fiji.<ref name="Blows"/> However, gale force winds, high seas, a heavy swell and storm surge inundated Bequ Island and a village on Kadavu Island, while partly destroying beach-fronts, roads, jetties and bridges within the archipelago.<ref name="1997-98 BoM"/> Within [[Lautoka]] several shops, power lines, a bus station and the roof of a shopping complex were damaged after what was believed to be either a [[tornado]] or tornadic winds developed in one of Susan's [[rainbands]] as it crossed the shoreline.<ref name="97-98 ATCR"/><ref name="Susan Prem report"/><ref name="Lautoka">{{cite web|url=http://archives.pireport.org/archive/1998/january/01-08-up.html|title=Cyclone Susan hits Lautoka, Fiji|author=Pacific Islands Report|date=January 8, 1998|accessdate=July 26, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60S6qeNiX|archivedate=July 26, 2011|publisher=Pacific Islands Development Program/Center for Pacific Islands Studies}}</ref> Firemen and linesmen from the [[Fiji Electricity Authority]] were called in to assist police to clear downed power wires.<ref name="Lautoka"/>
