The secondary feud on the SmackDown! brand was between [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Eddie Guerrero]]. The feud first started in March at [[WrestleMania XX]], when Guerrero defeated Angle to successfully retain the WWE Championship.

Towards the end of the match, [[El Gran Luchadore]] (Kurt Angle) interfered, giving JBL enough time to escape the cage and win the match. After the match ended, Guerrero attacked El Gran Luchadore and pulled off his mask, revealing him to be Kurt Angle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/smackdown/040715.htm|title=Angle's a Fraud|accessdate=2008-03-08|date=2004-07-15|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/040715.html|title=SmackDown! results - July 15, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-08|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> The following week, on ''SmackDown!'', [[Vince McMahon]] [[Professional wrestling match types#B|booked]] a match between Angle and Guerrero for SummerSlam.<ref name=sd-0722_pwwew/><ref name=sd-0722_oww/>
