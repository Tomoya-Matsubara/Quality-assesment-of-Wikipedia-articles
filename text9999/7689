'''Static-X''' is an American [[industrial metal]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. They were formed in 1994. They are signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] and have released six albums, their most recent being ''[[Cult of Static]]'', which was released on March 17, 2009.

The band rose to fame with their debut album ''[[Wisconsin Death Trip (album)|Wisconsin Death Trip]]'', which went platinum in 2001.<ref name="platinum">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=&resultpage=78&id=F08994D3-FF52-7C8E-5BDE-262FADF6D771|title=British Rock Royalty Add More Awards|date=2001-07-02|publisher=[[RIAA]]|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref> However, this is the only album they have released to date that has reached such sales levels. Their sound incorporates elements of a sub-genre called [[industrial metal]]. Static-X often refer to themselves as "evil disco".<ref name="evil_dsico">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=26730|title=Interview with Tony Campos Of Static-X|date=2007-06-08|publisher=Metalunderground.com|accessdate=2008-03-11}}</ref>

Static-X has released six studio albums, one compilation album, one EP, twelve singles, twelve videos and a guitar tab book entitled ''[[Static-X Guitar Anthology]]''. They recorded a DVD entitled ''[[Where the Hell Are We and What Day Is It... This Is Static-X]]'', but it was never released due to a threatened lawsuit by [[Sharon Osbourne]] over tracks recorded at [[Ozzfest]].

==Biography==
===Inception and debut album (1994<U+2014>2000)===
[[Image:WayneStatic.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Wayne Static]]

Static-X was founded in 1994 after the disbandment of [[Wayne Static]] and Ken Jay's former band Deep Blue Dream. Static and Jay originally met at the [[Chicago]] record store where Jay worked and were introduced to one another by [[The Smashing Pumpkins|Smashing Pumpkins]] vocalist [[Billy Corgan]] (the band also shared a rehearsal space with Smashing Pumpkins for a time).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  Once Deep Blue Dream folded, Static and Jay joined the Chicago metal band Stygian and recorded a demo under the band name Drill only to later move to [[Los Angeles]] to search for new band members. There, they met bassist [[Tony Campos]] and guitarist [[Koichi Fukuda]], completing the band's original lineup. Originally, they were meant to be called the name of their debut album, [[Wisconsin Death Trip (album)|Wisconsin Death Trip]], but figured it was too long and went with Static-X.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Static-X signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in early 1998, and released their debut album, ''[[Wisconsin Death Trip (album)|Wisconsin Death Trip]]'', on March 23, 1999. Soon after, they released their first single "Push It" (featuring remixes by fellow [[Warner Bros. Records]] artists [[Mephisto Odyssey]]), followed by "[[I'm with Stupid (Static-X song)|I'm with Stupid]]" and "[[Bled for Days]]" in 2000. Static-X toured strictly in support of the album and twice performed on [[Ozzfest]]. In the following year a promotional [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[The Death Trip Continues]]'', was released, however this album was not available in stores. In 2001, ''Wisconsin Death Trip'' went platinum and is, to date, Static-X's only album to reach this success.<ref name="platinum" />

The band has contributed numerous tracks from this album to video game soundtracks and for other promotional applications. The song "Otsegolation" was used in the [[PlayStation]] video game, ''[[Omega Boost]]'', where it is featured in the main menu and the final boss sequence. The song "Push It" is included in the games ''Street Skater 2'' and ''[[Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes]]'', both also for the PlayStation gaming console, and as downloadable content for the game ''[[Rock Band]]'' ) on the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] gaming consoles. Most recently the song "Love Dump" was featured in the soundtrack to the 2009 [[action-adventure game|action adventure]] game, ''[[Br<U+00FC>tal Legend]]'' for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

===''Machine'' and ''Shadow Zone'' (2000<U+2014>2003)===
[[Image:TonyCampos.JPG|thumb|Tony Campos]]

During recording of their follow-up album ''[[Machine (Static-X album)|Machine]]'', Koichi Fukuda left the band to spend time with his girlfriend and pursue other musical opportunities. Fukuda was only on one song "Otsego Undead" as keyboardist, which was on the soundtrack to ''[[Dracula 2000]]''. As Fukuda's replacement, former [[Dope (band)|Dope]] member [[Tripp Eisen]] stepped in. ''Machine'' was released May 22, 2001 to major success, and shortly after, Static-X began work on their third album, ''[[Shadow Zone]]'', this time with Eisen performing and writing on the album. However, before they could start recording, Ken Jay left the band due to musical and political differences. To drum on the album, [[Josh Freese]] of [[A Perfect Circle]] and [[The Vandals]] was brought in. Later, [[Nick Oshiro]], formerly of [[Seether]], was selected as Jay's replacement and the band's permanent drummer.

During production of the album, [[Jonathan Davis]] of [[Korn]] contacted Wayne Static to record the vocals for a song he wrote for the ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]'' soundtrack, entitled "Not Meant for Me" as well as contributing the song "Cold". A music video for the song was included as one of the special features on the DVD release (see: ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]])''. ''Shadow Zone'' was later released on October 7, 2003. Static-X continued their affiliation with video game soundtracks: "This Is Not" from ''Machine'', was included in the video game ''[[Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder]]''; "The Only" from ''Shadow Zone'' was featured on the soundtrack of ''[[Need for Speed: Underground]]''.

===''Beneath, Between, Beyond'' and ''Start a War'' (2003<U+2014>2006)===
[[Image:NickOshiro.JPG|thumb|left|Nick Oshiro]]

July 20, 2004 saw the release of ''[[Beneath, Between, Beyond|Beneath... Between... Beyond...]]'', a collection of rarities and demos. Shortly after the release of ''Beneath... Between... Beyond...'', the band commenced work on their fourth studio album, ''[[Start a War]]''. In February, 2005, Tripp Eisen was arrested in a sex scandal involving minors, and was subsequently fired from the band.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=2005-03-07|title=STATIC-X: TRIPP EISEN's California Arrest Log Posted Online|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=33435|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref> Former guitarist Koichi Fukuda, who had been providing samples and keyboards for the new album, rejoined Static-X to fill the gap left by Eisen.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=2007-07-18|title=STATIC-X Rejoined By Guitarist KOICHI FUKUDA|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=33842|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref> ''Start a War'' was finally released on June 14, 2005. "I'm the One" and "Dirthouse" were released as singles from the album. The song "Skinnyman" is included in the soundtrack of the 2005 street racing game ''[[Need For Speed: Most Wanted]]'', while the song "Start a War" was featured in [[WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006]].

===''Cannibal'' (2006<U+2014>2008)===
[[Image:KoichiFukuda.JPG|thumb|Koichi Fukuda]]

''[[Cannibal (Static-X album)|Cannibal]]'', released on April 3, 2007, marked the studio return of their original guitarist, Koichi Fukuda. One of the new tracks called "No Submission" is available on the ''[[Saw III#Soundtrack|Saw III soundtrack]]''. The full track has also been released on Static-X's MySpace page. "[[Cannibal (Static-X song)|Cannibal]]" was released as a [[music download|digital download]] single at [[iTunes]]. "[[Destroyer (Static-X song)|Destroyer]]" was released as a lead off radio single, before the album was released. Videos for the singles were supposed to be taken at the same time.

On March 20, the upcoming album was preceded with an exclusive ''Destroyer'' EP. The video for "Destroyer" has also been produced and is available now at headbangersball.com. The album itself debuted at #36 in the U.S. with sales of over 30,000.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author=Hasty, Katie|date=2007-04-11|title='NOW 24' Trumps McBride, Duff, Timbaland At No. 1|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003569925}}</ref>
	
On May 10, 2007 it was announced that the band would be playing on the main stage at [[Ozzfest#2007|Ozzfest 2007]]. Additionally, in a recent interview, Wayne Static announced his side-project called "Pighammer".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[The News Tribune]]|author=Jasmin, Ernest A.|date=2007-07-13|title=Ozzfest 2007 metal for the masses|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/ae/story/109094.html|accessdate=2007-07-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930165522/http://www.thenewstribune.com/ae/story/109094.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}</ref>
	
The chorus of the song "Destroyer" was used in an advertisement promoting the latest video game in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] franchise, [[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008|Smackdown vs. Raw 2008]].

In November 2007, Tony Campos joined legendary industrial act [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] as a temporary touring bassist for Ministry's C U LaTour in the wake of [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]]'s death.

===''Cannibal Killers Live'', ''Cult of Static'' and recent events (2008<U+2014>present)===
The band began their sixth studio album, ''[[Cult of Static]]'', in January 2008 after returning from the Operation Annihilation tour in Australia. In a posting at the Static-X message boards Wayne Static said that this time around he is focusing on longer buildups and break downs like in the Wisconsin Death Trip days of the band, however the album still maintains the heaviness that was present on Cannibal. On October 14, 2008 Static-X released their much anticipated live CD/DVD, [[Cannibal Killers Live]]. On December 11, 2008 Wayne Static confirmed on the Static-X Message Board the new album's release date and name saying "I had hoped to announce it here first, but my publicist beat me to the punch! The new record is indeed entitled "[[Cult of Static]]" and will be released March 17. The "cult" part of the title is not to be taken in any religious manner, I am referring to and giving respect to the loyalty of all you good people that have supported us through the years. This record is definitely darker than Cannibal and has more synths and loops as well. And this is also the most crushing guitar tone I have ever had. There are 11 songs instead of our usual 12, and they are mostly longer and more epic than ever before." The album debut at #16 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, the highest a Static-X album has ever been since their second studio album, Machine. A new Static-X song called "Lunatic" appeared on soundtrack to the movie [[War Zone (Punisher: War Zone)|Punisher: War Zone]]. In 2009, the band performed at the [[Download Festival]]. It also was the first time the band made an appearance at [[Rock on the Range]].

After finishing their final tour dates in Australia at the end of 2009, [[Wayne Static]] announced on the band's official X-Boards that he will now be focusing on his side project Pighammer. In a follow up post he was quoted "It's doubtful I will do anything with Static-X for the next couple years" leading fans to interpret that the band is still together and just on hiatus. Later, he revealed that Tony Campos had left the band,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=2005-03-07|title=Uncensored Net Noise June 18, 2010 With Guest Wayne Static from Static X|url=http://podcast.morningshowcentral.com/?p=194#|accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref> and Campos has since joined the metal band [[Soulfly]], taking over from Bobby Burns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=160130 |title=Former STATIC-X Bassist Joins SOULFLY |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> Koichi Fukuda went on to join [[industrial metal]]/[[ambient music|ambient]] band [[Drugstore Fanatics]].

In 2010, Wayne Static has been confirmed for [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] 2011 as part of his 'Pighammer' solo project.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hellfest

In 2012 Wayne Static decided to reform Static-X, but none of the original members will join him.  Instead his solo band will tour under the name Static-X.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=176105 |title=STATIC-X Is Back... Sort Of |publisher=Blabbermouth.Net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref>

==Style and influences==
Though Static-X have described their music as "evil disco", Static-X's sound shares much in common with their industrial metal influences, using heavy [[Distortion (guitar)|distortion]], [[electronic keyboards]], pounding bass riffs, and fast-paced, aggressive [[vocals]]. Songs sometimes apply heavy use of synthesizers and insertion of [[sampling (music)|samples]], such as snippets of movie dialogue. For example, ''A Dios Alma Perdida'' samples spaceship drone sound effects and alien chatter from the film ''[[Laserblast]]''. A new element used on their ''Cannibal'' album is the presence of guitar solos; solos weren't present in the previous albums, except (briefly) on the albums 'Shadow Zone' in the song 'Destroy All' and 'Start a War' in the song 'Pieces'.

Static-X have been labeled a variety of genres by the press, most notably [[nu metal]]<ref name="musicmight">{{cite web|last=Sharpe-Young|first=Garry|title=MusicMight Biography|url=http://musicmight.com/artist/united+states/california/los+angeles/static+x|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref><ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/staticx-machine.shtml www.popmatters.com] "The impressionistic lyrics touch on most of the nu metal genre's tropes ...  and in fact the epitome of nu metal angst in general"
</ref><ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/33163/static-x-cannibal/ www.popmatters.com] "Wisconsin Death-Trip, which established them, alongside Slipknot, as one of the most extreme bands to emerge from the 'nu metal' movement"
</ref><ref>[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,2953921,00.html www.artistdirect.com] "Welcome to second-string n<U+00FC>-metal, where the satanic ibex no longer roams the land, and song lyrics focus on an abstract hatred of ex-girlfriends."
</ref><ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/staticx/albums/album/310912/review/5944449/machine www.rollingstone.com] "Among the pierced and masked knuckleheads of new metal, Static-X roar and chug like 'bots with loose hip bolts."
</ref> although the band disputes this, stating they are "more industrial than anything else".<ref>[http://www.revolt-media.com/features/?cat=30 www.revolt-media.com] "Opinions varied once Static-X starting rocking with nu metal bands such as Staind and Linkin Park on such tours as the 2001 Family Values Tour. Then the Static-X boys released a rare assortment of demos, remixes and cover tracks, Beneath...Between...Beyond..., in 2004 which led many folks to believe the band was winding down. 'We were lumped into nu metal because of who we were touring with at the time. People categorize bands by whatever<U+2019>s convenient. We<U+2019>re more industrial than anything else, but it could<U+2019>ve been worse. They could have called us disco.'"</ref>

==The Otsego songs==
Song titles using variations of the word "Otsego" exist on their first four albums, with ''Cannibal'' being the first album to break this trend. The songs are titled: "Otsegolation", "Otsego Undead", "Otsegolectric" and "Otsego Amigo". The track "Otsego Undead" is misspelled on the ''Dracula 2000'' soundtrack, and was printed as "Ostego Undead". An explanation for the "Otsego" tracks was given in a 2003 interview with ''Metal Edge Magazine'', where Wayne Static said: {{cquote|[[Otsego, Michigan|Otsego]] is a town near where I went to college at [[Michigan]] ([[Western Michigan University]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]]), and it was kind of a depressing, small town. There was a guy named Dean there, and I had his fake ID.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}}}
