Father '''Jacques Marquette''' S.J. (June 1, 1637 <U+2013> May 18, 1675),<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9051070/Jacques-Marquette Jacques Marquette - Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> sometimes known as ''P<U+00E8>re  Marquette'' or ''James Marquette'',<ref>[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Archdiocese of Chicago|Catholic Encyclopedia (1913): Archdiocese of Chicago]], Retrieved February 23, 2012</ref> was a [[French people|French]] [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] who founded [[Michigan]]'s first European settlement, [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]], and later founded [[St. Ignace, Michigan]].  In 1673 Father Marquette and [[Louis Jolliet]] were the first [[Europe]]ans to explore and map the northern portion of the [[Mississippi River]].

==Biography==
Jacques Marquette was born in [[Laon]], [[France]], on June 1, 1637 and joined the [[Society of Jesus]] at age 17.  After he worked and taught in France for several years, the Jesuits assigned him to [[New France]] in 1666 as a [[missionary]] to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. He showed great proficiency in learning the local languages, especially [[Wyandot language|Huron]].
In 1668 Father Marquette (French: ''P<U+00E8>re Marquette'') was moved by his superiors to missions farther up the [[St. Lawrence River]] in the western [[Great Lakes]] region.  He helped found missions at [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in present-day [[Michigan]] and at [[La Pointe, Wisconsin|La Pointe]], on [[Lake Superior]] near the present-day city of [[Ashland, Wisconsin]]. At La Pointe he encountered members of the [[Illiniwek|Illinois]] tribes, who told him about the important trading route of the Mississippi River.  They invited him to teach their people, whose settlements were mostly further south. Because of wars between the [[Wyandot people|Hurons]] at La Pointe and the neighboring [[Lakota people]], Father Marquette left the mission and went to the [[Straits of Mackinac]]; he informed his superiors about the rumored river and requested permission to explore it.

Leave was granted, and in 1673, Marquette joined the expedition of [[Louis Jolliet]], a French-Canadian explorer.  They departed from [[St. Ignace]] on May 17, with two canoes and five [[voyageurs]] of French-Indian ancestry (now recognized as the ethnic group [[M<U+00E9>tis]]).  They followed [[Lake Michigan]] to [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]] and up the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]], nearly to its headwaters.  From there, they were told to portage their canoes a distance of slightly less than two miles through marsh and oak plains to the [[Wisconsin River]].  Many years later, at that point the town of Portage, Wisconsin was built, named for the ancient path between the two rivers.  From the portage, they ventured forth, and on June 17, they entered the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] near present-day [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]].

The Joliet-Marquette expedition traveled to within {{convert|435|mi}} of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] but turned back at the mouth of the [[Arkansas River]]. By this point they had encountered several natives carrying European trinkets, and they feared an encounter with explorers or colonists from [[Spain]].<ref>Catton, Bruce (1984). ''Michigan: A History'', p. 14. W. W. Norton & Company. ISBN 0-393-30175-3</ref> They followed the Mississippi back to the mouth of the [[Illinois River]], which they learned from local natives provided a shorter route back to the Great Lakes. They reached Lake Michigan near the site of modern-day [[Chicago]], by way of the [[Chicago Portage]]. In September Marquette stopped at the mission of St. Francis Xavier, located in present-day [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], while Jolliet returned to Quebec to relate the news of their discoveries.

[[File:Marquette Winter Monument Chicago.JPG|right|thumb|Monument marking where Marquette spent the winter of 1674<U+2013>75 in what is now Chicago]]
Marquette and his party returned to the Illinois Territory in late 1674, becoming the first Europeans to winter in what would become the city of Chicago. As welcomed guests of the [[Illinois Confederation]], the explorers were feasted ''en route'' and fed ceremonial foods such as [[sagamite]].<ref>[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/001583.asp Wisconsin Historical Society]</ref>

In the spring of 1675, Marquette traveled westward and celebrated a public [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois]] near [[Starved Rock State Park|Starved Rock]]. A bout of [[dysentery]] which he had contracted during the Mississippi expedition sapped his health. On the return trip to St. Ignace, he died at age 37 near the modern town of [[Ludington, Michigan]]. 

A Michigan Historical Marker at this location reads:
{{cquote|"Father Jacques Marquette, the great Jesuit missionary and explorer, died and was buried by two French companions somewhere along the Lake Michigan shore on May 18, 1675. He had been returning to his mission at St. Ignace which he had left in 1673 to go exploring in the Mississippi country. The exact location of his death has long been a subject of controversy. A spot close to the southeast slope of this hill, near the ancient outlet of the [[Pere Marquette River]], corresponds with the death site as located by early French accounts and maps and a constant tradition of the past. Marquette's remains were reburied at [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]] in 1677."<ref>[http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=S0278.htm Marquette's Death - Michigan Historical Marker Registered Site S0278 ]</ref>}}

The Ojibway Museum on State Street in downtown St. Ignace is in a building that was constructed adjacent to Marquette's gravesite during urban development.
