'''Priyanka Chopra''' ({{IPA-hns|pr<U+026A><U+02C8>j<U+0259><U+014B>ka<U+02D0> <U+02C8>t<U+0283>o<U+02D0>p<U+027D>a<U+02D0>|pron}}; born 18 July 1982) is an Indian film actress, singer, and songwriter. The winner of the [[Miss World]] pageant of 2000, through her successful film career Chopra has become one of Bollywood's highest-paid actresses and one of the most popular celebrities in India. She has won a [[National Film Award for Best Actress]] and [[Filmfare Awards]] in four categories.

Chopra was born in [[Jamshedpur]] to parents who were both physicians in the [[Indian Army]], causing the family to move frequently during her childhood, but she considers [[Bareilly]] her real home. As a teenager she lived for some years with an aunt in the United States. In 2000, her mother entered her into the [[Femina Miss India]] contest, in which she finished second and took the Miss India World title.{{efn|At the time, the second place contestant of [[Femina Miss India]] was given the title "Miss India World" and sent to the Miss World competition, whereas the first place contestant was sent to [[Miss Universe]], and third place to [[Miss Asia Pacific International]].<ref name=winners/>}} She was then entered into the Miss World pageant, where she was crowned [[Miss World 2000]] and [[List of Miss World Continental Queen of Beauty winners|Miss World Continental Queen of Beauty{{mdash}}Asia & Oceania]], becoming the fifth Indian to win the competition.

Although Chopra at one time aspired to study engineering or psychiatry, she accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her acting debut in the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] film ''[[Thamizhan]]'' in 2002. The following year, she starred in ''[[The Hero: Love Story of a Spy|The Hero]]'', her first [[Bollywood|Hindi film]] release, and followed it with the box-office hit ''[[Andaaz]]'', which won her the [[Filmfare Best Female Debut Award]] and a nomination for the [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award]]. She subsequently earned wide critical recognition for the role of a seductress in the 2004 thriller ''[[Aitraaz]]'', winning her the [[Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role]]. By 2006, Chopra had established herself as a leading actress of Hindi cinema with starring roles in the highly successful films ''[[Krrish]]'' and ''[[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]]''. After receiving mixed reviews for a series of unsuccessful films, she received critical acclaim for her portrayal of unconventional characters, including a troubled model in the 2008 drama ''[[Fashion (film)|Fashion]]'', a feisty Marathi woman in the 2009 caper thriller ''[[Kaminey]]'', a serial killer in the 2011 [[neo-noir]] ''[[7 Khoon Maaf]]'', and an autistic woman in the 2012 romantic comedy ''[[Barfi!]]''

In addition to acting in films, she participates in stage shows, has hosted a [[Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi (season 3)|reality show]] on television, and has written columns for India's national newspapers. Chopra has engaged in philanthropic activities, and was appointed as a [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]] for Child Rights on 10 August 2010. In 2012, she released her first single "[[In My City]]", which, although a commercial success in India, was met with mixed reactions from the critics.

After starting 2006 with special appearances in three films, Chopra starred in [[Rakesh Roshan]]'s superhero film ''[[Krrish]]'' (a sequel to the 2003 science-fiction film ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]''). Co-starring with [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Rekha]] and [[Naseeruddin Shah]], Chopra played a young television journalist who schemes to take advantage of an innocent young man with remarkable physical abilities, but eventually falls in love with him. The film was the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India and grossed over {{INRConvert|1.17|b|0}} worldwide attaining a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] status.<ref name=boi06>{{cite web|title=Box Office 2006|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=212&catName=MjAwNg==|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> At the film premiere, members of the [[Bharatiya Yuva Morcha]] of Indore staged a protest against the release of the film, linked to the problems Chopra's family were facing with former secretary Prakash Jaju and the allegations that she was linked to Karachi-based underworld don Chhota Shakeel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1066532351.html|title=Priyanka's presence in 'Krrish' earns the flick protest|publisher=''Hindustan Times''|date=23 June 2006|accessdate=8 June 2013}}{{subscription required|via=Highbeam}}</ref> Her next film was [[Dharmesh Darshan]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Aap Ki Khatir (2006 film)|Aap Ki Khatir]]'', co-starring [[Akshaye Khanna]], [[Ameesha Patel]] and [[Dino Morea]].

Chopra's final release of 2006 was [[Farhan Akhtar]]'s action-thriller ''[[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]]'' (a remake of the [[Don (1978 film)|1978 film of the same name]]), with [[Shahrukh Khan]]. Chopra portrayed Roma (played by [[Zeenat Aman]] in the original film), who joins the underworld to avenge Don for killing her brother. The actress received martial-arts training for her role in the movie, and performed her own stunts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Little film action for female stunt artistes|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-01/mumbai/29492819_1_stunts-film-industry-action-scenes|work=The Times of India|author=Dubey, Bharti |date=1 May 2011|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> The film was declared a box-office success in India and overseas, with revenues of {{INRConvert|1.05|b|0}}.<ref name="Lifetime"/> Raja Sen of Rediff.com believed that Chopra convincingly portrayed Roma, "looking every bit the competent woman of action".<ref>{{cite web|title=SRK pays just tribute to Big B's Don|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/oct/20don.htm|author=Sen, Raja|publisher=Rediff.com|date=20 October 2006|accessdate=13 December 2012}}</ref>

In 2007, Chopra had two leading roles. Her first film was [[Nikhil Advani]]'s ''[[Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love]]'', a romantic comedy in six chapters with an [[ensemble cast]]. She was featured opposite Salman Khan in the first chapter as Kamini, an [[Item number|item girl]] and aspiring actress who tries to land the lead role in a [[Karan Johar]] film with a publicity gimmick.<ref>{{cite web|title=Box Office 2007 |url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=214&catName=MjAwNw==|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> Film critic Sukanya Verma praised her flair for comedy, especially her impressions of [[Meena Kumari]], [[Nargis]] and [[Madhubala]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Salaam-E-Ishq: Stars shine in mediocre film|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/jan/26salaam.htm|author=Verma, Sukanya|publisher=Rediff.com|date=26 January 2007|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> Both ''Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love'' and her next film, ''[[Big Brother (film)|Big Brother]]'', proved unsuccessful at the domestic box-office.<ref name="journey2"/>

In 2008, Chopra starred opposite [[Harman Baweja]] in [[Harry Baweja|his father's]] ''[[Love Story 2050]]''. Chopra played a double role, so she coloured her hair twice; once red to portray the girl from the future and then black for the girl of the past.<ref>{{cite web|title=Code Red|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080613/jsp/entertainment/story_9403163.jsp|author=Shah, Jigar |work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|date=13 June 2008|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> Her performance was poorly received; [[Rajeev Masand]] was unimpressed with Chopra's chemistry with her co-star, remarking that her character "fails to inspire either affection or sympathy".<ref>{{cite web|title=Masand's Verdict: Love Story 2050|author=Masand, Rajeev|publisher=CNN-IBN|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/love-story-2050-partpredictable-partgobbledygook/68318-8.html|date=5 July 2008|accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> She next appeared in the comedy ''[[God Tussi Great Ho]]'', portraying a TV anchor opposite Salman Khan, [[Sohail Khan]] and Amitabh Bachchan.

===Critical acclaim (2008<U+2013>11)===
The string of poorly received films ended when Chopra starred in [[Madhur Bhandarkar]]'s ''[[Fashion (film)|Fashion]]'', a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed the lives and careers of several fashion models. Chopra portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months' consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar's confidence in her.<ref>{{cite web|title=Style watch: Priyanka wears 137 outfits in Fashion|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2008/oct/301008fashionpriyankachopra.htm|work=Mid Day|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref> During production, the media spread rumours that she was starving herself to reduce her weight to that of a supermodel.

[[Anurag Basu]]'s ''[[Barfi!]]'', with Ranbir Kapoor and [[Ileana D'Cruz]], was her final appearance of 2012.
