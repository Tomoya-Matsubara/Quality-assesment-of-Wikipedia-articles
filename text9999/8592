The '''Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex''' is a recreation facility in [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is located on [[David Bauer (ice hockey)|Father David Bauer]] Drive, west of Uptown. The complex contains the '''Sunlife Arena''', a 4,132-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] that is home to the [[Waterloo Siskins]] and the [[Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks]] [[Ice hockey|hockey]] teams, the [[Kitchener-Waterloo Kodiaks]] [[Major Series Lacrosse]] team, and the '''Swimplex''', a 30m pool that was the city's first municipally-owned indoor pool.

Construction of the $21 million facility began in December 1991 and the Rec Complex opened in September 1993. While under construction, the site was selected for the 1994 [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Scott Tournament of Hearts]], the Canadian women's [[curling]] championship. It was called the Waterloo Recreation Complex until May 2001, when ''Memorial'' was added after the city closed the [[Waterloo Memorial Arena]]. The building honours the 69 Waterloo residents killed in the two [[world war]]s.
