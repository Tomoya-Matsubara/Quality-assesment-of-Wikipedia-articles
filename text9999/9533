'''New York State Route 22''' (NY&nbsp;22) is [[New York]] [[state highway]] running north&ndash;south parallel to the state's eastern edge from the outskirts of [[New York City]] to a short distance south of the [[United States-Canada border|Canadian border]]. At over {{convert|337|mi|km}}, it is the state's longest north&ndash;south route and the third longest overall, after [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] and [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]].{{ref label|note01|a|^}} Many of the state's major east&ndash;west roads intersect with Route&nbsp;22 just before crossing the state line into the neighboring [[New England]] states.

Almost all of Route&nbsp;22 is a two-lane rural road that only passes through small villages and hamlets.  The exceptions are its southern end in the heavily populated [[Bronx]] and lower [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], and a section of that runs through the city of [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]] near the northern end. The rural landscape that the road passes through varies from horse country and views of the large reservoirs of the [[New York City water supply system|New York City watershed]] in the northern suburbs of city, to [[dairy farm]]s further upstate in the hilly [[Taconic Mountains|Taconics]] and [[Berkshire Mountains|Berkshires]], to the undeveloped, heavily forested [[Adirondack Park]] along the shores of [[Lake Champlain]]. An {{convert|86|mi|km|adj=on}} section from [[Fort Ann (village), New York|Fort Ann]] to [[Keeseville, New York|Keeseville]] is part of the [[All-American Road]] known as the [[Lakes to Locks Passage]]. 

The southernmost section of the road was known as the '''White Plains Post Road''' in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a major highway connecting New York City to [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], the Westchester [[county seat]]. Route&nbsp;22 in its modern form was established in 1930 as one of the principal routes from New York City to Canada.

==Route description==
Route&nbsp;22 starts as an urban arterial road, passing through the most populous communities along its route within its first {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}}.  It changes direction slightly from north to northeast at a [[traffic circle]] near [[Kensico Reservoir|Kensico Dam]] and becomes a mostly two-lane rural route all the way to the Canadian border.

===Bronx to Kensico Dam===
[[Image:NY 22 first reassurance shield.jpg|right|thumb|First reassurance shield of NY 22]]
Route 22 starts as Provost Avenue at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 1 in New York|US&nbsp;1]] in the [[Bronx]], intersecting with [[East 233rd Street (Bronx)|East 233rd Street]] about {{convert|0.2|mi|km|abbr=on}} later.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York City, New York |publisher=[[American Automobile Association]] |cartography=American Automobile Association |year=2007}}</ref> It soon crosses the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] county line into [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]] and becomes South Third Avenue, beginning a {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} section in that county.<ref name="nymap07"/> Shortly after the county line, Route&nbsp;22 makes a sharp turn to the right at the South Columbus Avenue intersection. It parallels the nearby [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] as it heads into the New York City suburbs of [[Bronxville, New York|Bronxville]] and [[Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York|Tuckahoe]]. At [[Wilson Woods Lake]], it crosses a pair of railroad tracks and becomes North Columbus Avenue, then has its first interchange with a [[limited-access road]] at the [[Cross County Parkway]]. NY&nbsp;22 is mostly locally maintained within the city of Mount Vernon.<ref name=westchestermap>{{cite map|publisher=Westchester County Department of Public Works|url=http://www.westchestergov.com/planningdocs/pdfmaps/countystateroadsparks.pdf |year=2006|accessdate=2007-11-30|title=Westchester County and State Road Map|format=PDF}}</ref>

After leaving Scarsdale, NY&nbsp;22 continues north into the hamlet of [[Hartsdale, New York|Hartsdale]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

The route parallels the [[Bronx River Parkway]] (BRP) as it enters Westchester's county seat, [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].<ref name="nymap07"/> Within the city of White Plains, NY&nbsp;22 is maintained by Westchester County, with unsigned designations of County Road&nbsp;53 (Scarsdale line to NY&nbsp;125), County Road&nbsp;108 (NY&nbsp;125 to Westchester Avenue), and County Road&nbsp;87 (Broadway to North Castle line).<ref name=westchestermap/> NY&nbsp;22 also intersects [[New York State Route 125|NY&nbsp;125]] and [[New York State Route 119|NY&nbsp;119]] in downtown White Plains, then bends to the northwest along North Broadway, eventually intersecting the [[Cross-Westchester Expressway]] ([[Interstate 287|I-287]]). [[White Plains Rural Cemetery]] is visible to the west as NY&nbsp;22 continues northward out of the city.<ref name="nymap07"/>

In North White Plains, the area that the road passes through becomes a little less developed as it goes over a gentle rise to the [[traffic circle]] where the BRP ends and the [[Taconic State Parkway]] begins, just south of [[Kensico Dam]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

===Kensico Reservoir to Brewster===
While the Taconic State Parkway continues along the northwest heading Route&nbsp;22 had been following, Route&nbsp;22 itself veers to the northeast along the reservoir's south shore towards a short [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[New York State Route 120|NY&nbsp;120]],<ref name="nymap07"/> just north of [[IBM]]'s [[Armonk, New York|Armonk]] headquarters and the "Duke's Trees angle", the westernmost point in [[Connecticut]].<ref name="Duke's Trees">New York State State Law, Article 2, Section 2.</ref> For the first time, NY&nbsp;22 runs parallel to New York's eastern border, intersecting [[I-684]] for the first of several times just north of the short portion of that highway in Connecticut. A short distance later, [[New York State Route 433|NY&nbsp;433]], one of the state's shortest highways, heads south from NY&nbsp;22 into [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

After that junction, NY&nbsp;22 bends back to the north, paralleling I-684 as a narrow, shaded meandering two-lane rural route through the Westchester countryside of large wooded lots and houses well-screened from the road. In downtown [[Bedford (CDP), New York|Bedford]], the first settlement since White Plains, the highway overlaps with [[New York State Route 172|NY&nbsp;172]] for a few blocks, then intersects [[New York State Route 121|NY&nbsp;121]] at its southern terminus. Route&nbsp;22 itself follows a due-north heading from the hamlet, passing the Caramoor Center, the [[John Jay Homestead State Historic Site]] (the first [[National Historic Landmark]] along the highway), and [[Harvey School]], before it briefly widens at a major intersection with [[New York State Route 35|NY&nbsp;35]] near [[Katonah, New York|Katonah]].<ref name="nymap07"/> Two miles north of that junction, NY&nbsp;22 becomes parallel to I-684 into the [[Somers, New York|Town of Somers]] and the hamlet of [[Goldens Bridge, New York|Goldens Bridge]]. On the other side of the interstate, accessible via [[New York State Route 138|NY&nbsp;138]], is the [[Goldens Bridge (Metro-North station)|Goldens Bridge train station]] on [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[Harlem Line]], which begins a long parallel alignment with NY&nbsp;22 at this point.<ref name="nymap07"/>
[[Image:I-84 bridge over US 6-US 202-NY 22 and Croton River.jpg|thumb|left|I-84 overpass north of Brewster]]
The railroad's [[Purdy's (Metro-North station)|Purdy's]] station is a short distance west of the next junction, [[New York State Route 116|NY&nbsp;116]], after which NY&nbsp;22 crosses under I-684, remaining between it and the railroad tracks. Turning left onto Hardscrabble Road, it follows the tracks away from the interstate to the site of [[Croton Falls (Metro-North station)|the next station]], [[North Salem, New York|North Salem]]'s hamlet of [[Croton Falls, New York|Croton Falls]]. Just north of the hamlet, Route&nbsp;22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]]. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], following the [[Croton River]] north past the [[spillway]] of [[East Branch Reservoir]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

After paralleling the reservoir for almost two miles, a third route, [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]], joins the concurrency just east of the village of [[Brewster, New York|Brewster]]. The three routes cross under a high, long bridge carrying [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]], then veer east to an interchange with the north end of I-684. US&nbsp;6 and 202 continue east for [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] while NY&nbsp;22 uses the northbound on-ramp of the I-684 roadway.<ref name="nymap07"/> The short expressway connector that carries northbound I-684 traffic to northbound NY&nbsp;22 is NY Reference Route&nbsp;981B.

=== Harlem Valley, Taconics and Berkshires ===
[[Image:NY 22 with Harlem Valley view.jpg|right|thumb|NY 22 looking north into the Harlem Valley from Patterson]]
Route&nbsp;22 continues heading northeast along a narrow strip of land between the East Branch and [[Bog Brook Reservoir|Bog Brook]] reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas of the town of [[Patterson, New York|Patterson]], where two local state highways, [[New York State Route 312|NY&nbsp;312]] and [[New York State Route 164|164]], come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, [[New York State Route 311|NY&nbsp;311]], and passing another strip plaza, NY&nbsp;22 crosses into [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

After another supermarket strip to the east, a long, gentle [[divided highway|divided]] bend in the road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where [[New York State Route 55|NY&nbsp;55]] comes in from the west. It joins NY&nbsp;22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of [[Pawling (village), New York|Pawling]] and then by [[Trinity-Pawling School]]. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY&nbsp;22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends its name to the railroad line.<ref name="nymap07"/> The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the [[Appalachian Trail]] crosses the road next to [[Appalachian Trail (Metro-North station)|] [[flag stop]] on the line.

Routes&nbsp;22 and 55 continue their long curve into the town of [[Dover, New York|Dover]], past the [[Harlem Valley-Wingdale (Metro-North station)|Harlem Valley-Wingdale]] station next to the road across from the now-closed buildings of [[Harlem Valley State Hospital|Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center]]. The NY&nbsp;55 concurrency ends when that road heads towards Connecticut at [[Wingdale, New York|Wingdale]], once the last stop on the Harlem Line. As a result of a service extension in 2002, the diesel engines can be seen along the reopened track beyond here, through [[Dover Plains (Metro-North station)|Dover Plains]] and into [[Amenia, New York|Amenia]], where an overlap with [[New York State Route 343|NY&nbsp;343]] begins. The railroad line ends at [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]], the most distant Metro-North station from the city in [[as the crow flies|direct miles]]. Route&nbsp;343 remains joined with Route&nbsp;22 into the hamlet of Amenia, where it separates and heads towards state line. At the same junction, [[U.S. Route 44|US&nbsp;44]] comes in from [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] to begin an overlap with Route&nbsp;22.<ref name="nymap07"/> The valley opens up as the southern [[Taconic Mountains|Taconics]] loom ahead.
[[Image:NY 22 and NY 343.jpg|left|200px|thumb|NY 343 and NY 22 concurrency near Dover, New York]]
After intersecting with [[New York State Route 199|NY&nbsp;199]] at its eastern end, NY&nbsp;22 and US&nbsp;44 veer northeast into the small village of [[Millerton, New York|Millerton]] in the northern protrusion of Dutchess County's Oblong, an area once the subject of a boundary dispute between New York and Connecticut in the late 17th century. US&nbsp;44 continues eastward towards Connecticut while NY&nbsp;22 resumes its northward course into the shadow of the ridge ahead, where three states converge near the {{convert|2311|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Brace Mountain]], Dutchess County's highest, and Connecticut's highest point on [[Mount Frissell]]'s southern slope. At another gentle curve, NY&nbsp;22 slips into [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] and the town of [[Ancram, New York|Ancram]].<ref name="nymap07"/> North of the county line, [[Massachusetts]] becomes the state behind [[Alander Mountain]] and the other peaks visible to the east. The southernmost route from New York to the Massachusetts state line, [[New York State Route 344|NY&nbsp;344]], leaves for [[Bash Bish Falls|Bashbish Falls State Park]] at the hamlet of [[Copake Falls, New York|Copake Falls]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

The next major junction is in [[Hillsdale, New York|Hillsdale]] where [[New York State Route 23|NY&nbsp;23]] crosses NY&nbsp;22 on its way to [[Catamount Ski Center]], which straddles the New York&ndash;Massachusetts state line. At the hamlet of Green River, [[New York State Route 71|NY&nbsp;71]], the state's shortest two-digit route, begins at NY&nbsp;22 heading east into Massachusetts. NY&nbsp;22  then crosses into [[Austerlitz, New York|Austerlitz]], where the surrounding terrain becomes much more wooded and the valleys become narrower. In the center of town, East Hill Road offers a short detour to [[Steepletop]], the farm where [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] lived. A short distance later, NY&nbsp;22 intersects with [[New York State Route 203|NY&nbsp;203]] at its eastern end.<ref name="nymap07"/>

Route&nbsp;22 then veers sharply to the northeast, resuming a northward direction only a short distance from the state line, a few hundred feet to the east. It then rounds a mountain and heads west, paralleling the [[New York State Thruway]]'s Berkshire section ([[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]) for a mile. NY&nbsp;980D (an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]]) leaves to the east, where it becomes [[Massachusetts Route 102]] at the state line. After Thruway exit&nbsp;B3, NY&nbsp;22 resumes its northerly heading. From here it intersects [[New York State Route 295|NY&nbsp;295]], then passes [[Queechy Lake]]. NY&nbsp;22 then straightens out to reach [[New Lebanon, New York|New Lebanon]], where it intersects [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. New York's longest east&ndash;west route (US&nbsp;20) overlaps with its longest north&ndash;south route (NY&nbsp;22) for a mile before the former continues to [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]] and the latter returns to the border-paralleling course, which takes it into [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]].<ref name="nymap07"/>
[[Image:NYSR22 WashingtonCty.jpg|thumb|right|Route 22 through [[Washington County, New York|Washington County]]]]
As NY&nbsp;22 continues north, it remains, at first, within a mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with [[New York State Route 43|NY&nbsp;43]] in [[Stephentown, New York|Stephentown]]. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the [[Berkshire Mountains|Berkshires]]. Wide curves take the road through [[Berlin, New York|Berlin]], where [[Berlin Mountain]], the highest peak in the state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route&nbsp;22 trends further west, then back east to where [[New York State Route 2|NY&nbsp;2]] crosses via an overpass at [[Petersburgh, New York|Petersburgh]] on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York-Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY&nbsp;22, [[New York State Route 346|NY&nbsp;346]] at North Petersburgh, enters [[Vermont]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

Shortly afterward, the highway descends gently from the Berkshires to meet another major state road, [[New York State Route 7|NY&nbsp;7]], and overlaps with it for a short distance. Two miles after that concurrency ends, NY&nbsp;22 follows the upper [[Hoosic River]] to [[Hoosick Falls, New York|Hoosick Falls]], the first village it has passed through since Millerton. There are no other state routes here, but after another {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}}, at North Hoosick, [[New York State Route 67|NY&nbsp;67]] comes in from the east and the two roads overlap as they leave Rensselaer County.<ref name="nymap07"/>

=== Washington County ===
Almost immediately after the joined roads cross the county line, NY&nbsp;67 splits off to the west, crossing the Hoosick back into Rensselaer County, while NY&nbsp;22 straightens out again to go due north. After {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}}, it reaches [[Cambridge (village), New York|Cambridge]], where [[New York State Route 313|NY&nbsp;313]] forks off to the east. In the middle of town, [[New York State Route 372|NY&nbsp;372]], a local connector to [[Greenwich, New York|Greenwich]], ends.<ref name="nymap07"/>
[[Image:NY 22 - US 4 concurrency signs.jpg|left|thumb|NY 22 along with its concurrency with U.S. Route 4 south of Whitehall]]
North of Cambridge, the highway continues through a rolling landscape of fields and farms, the low transitional country between the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]]. Beyond [[New York State Route 29|NY&nbsp;29]]'s eastern terminus at Greenwich Junction, Route&nbsp;22 heads eastward again through {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} of countryside until, just before reaching [[Granville (village), New York|Granville]], it comes within a {{convert|.5|mi|m|abbr=on}} of the state line, the closest it has come to that boundary since Austerlitz. At the village's south end, NY&nbsp;22 intersects [[New York State Route 149|NY&nbsp;149]] and the two routes overlap for several blocks until NY&nbsp;149 begins its short journey to Vermont. Just north of Granville, the first of NY&nbsp;22's two suffixed routes, [[New York State Route 22A|NY&nbsp;22A]], begins its route running closely parallel to the state line and then into Vermont, where it becomes [[Vermont Route 22A|VT&nbsp;22A]], paralleling the parent route for some distance on the other side of the state line.<ref name="nymap07"/>

Immediately after this junction, NY&nbsp;22 begins a long curve away from the state line that has it running due west at the end of [[New York State Route 40|NY&nbsp;40]] in North Granville. It heads northwest a little further until, after passing between [[Great Meadows Correctional Facility|Great Meadows]] and [[Washington Correctional Facility|Washington]] state prisons, it reaches [[U.S. Route 4 in New York|US&nbsp;4]] and turns right to join it, resuming its northward course. The overlap with US&nbsp;4, one of the few along Route&nbsp;22 that pairs it with another north&ndash;south route, lasts for seven miles (11 km) along the base of the Adirondack foothills between the low country and [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], before ending in [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall]], where US&nbsp;4 leaves to assume the east&ndash;west course it takes across northern New England.<ref name="nymap07"/>

=== Adirondack Park and Lake Champlain===
[[Image:NY 22 N of Whitehall.jpg|right|thumb|View to the Drowned Lands at the south end of Lake Champlain from near Whitehall]]
As NY&nbsp;22 bends westward after leaving Whitehall, it rounds the north end of the ridge to the west, offering views into Vermont. Once again the Vermont state line is very near NY&nbsp;22, but now it is separated from New York by water instead of land. The stream at the bottom of this valley, surrounded by the low lying Drowned Lands [[flood plain]], is the inflow for [[Lake Champlain]]. The lake's South Bay, which the road crosses immediately after this turn, is also the [[Blue Line (New York State)|Blue Line]]. Route&nbsp;22 has now entered  [[Adirondack Park]], the {{convert|6100000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} [[Forest Preserve (New York)|Forest Preserve]] and [[National Historic Landmark]], and the largest state-level [[protected area]] in any state. Within the park, NY&nbsp;22 mainly follows the lakeshore, closer to some of its more populated areas.<ref name="nymap07"/>

It continues along the hillside of [[Black Mountain (New York)|Black Mountain]], Washington County's highest peak, as it meanders north on the narrowing [[isthmus]] between Lakes Champlain and George. Near the northern end, it crosses the [[Essex County, New York|Essex County]] line. Two miles later, it reaches the first settlement along its length within the Adirondack Park, [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]].<ref name="nymap07"/>
[[Image:NY 9N-NY 22 concurrency signs in Ticonderoga.jpg|left|thumb|NY 9N and NY 22 signs at the concurrency's southern terminus]]
The highway skirts the northeastern edge of the village, the site of [[Battle of Ticonderoga|key battles]] in both the [[French and Indian War|French and Indian]] and [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary]] Wars, as [[New York State Route 74|NY&nbsp;74]] comes in from the ferry to the east. This overlap lasts for almost two miles until NY&nbsp;74 goes straight ahead at the intersection with [[New York State Route 9N|NY&nbsp;9N]], while NY&nbsp;22 turns right to join NY&nbsp;9N, the longest suffixed route in the state, and return to its northbound orientation.<ref name="nymap07"/>

At first, Routes&nbsp;22 and 9N veer west, away from the lake, but then return to its shoreline to avoid a nearby mountain, just before [[Crown Point, New York|Crown Point]]. Another reference route, NY&nbsp;910L, runs from 9N and 22 along the peninsula to become [[Vermont Route 17|VT&nbsp;17]]. They remain close to the widening lake for the next {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} through [[Port Henry, New York|Port Henry]] to [[Westport, New York|Westport]], where 9N leaves for [[Elizabethtown, New York|Elizabethtown]]. Beyond that junction, Route&nbsp;22 again turns inland, going through the easy pass around Split Rock Mountain. At Bouquet, it makes an abrupt right turn to go due east back to the lakeshore and ferry landing at [[Essex, New York|Essex]].<ref name="nymap07"/>
[[Image:Approaching NY 910L on NY 9N & 22.JPG|right|thumb|Signs as the NY 9N-22 concurrency approaches NY 910L]]
Route&nbsp;22 heads to the northwest again, away from the lake, until it heads west and intersects [[US 9 (NY)|US&nbsp;9]] in the town of [[Chesterfield, New York|Chesterfield]], the other major north&ndash;south surface route up the state's eastern side. Routes&nbsp;22 and 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway ([[I-87]]), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles in the southern part of the state, run through a narrow corridor for two miles until Routes&nbsp;9 and 22 veer east again toward [[Keeseville, New York|Keeseville]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

Here, Route&nbsp;9N ends and Routes&nbsp;9 and 22 separate. The two will exchange corridors, with US&nbsp;9 following the lake shore line while NY&nbsp;22 remains mostly inland. NY&nbsp;22 enters [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton County]] just north of Keeseville, and then leaves Adirondack Park {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond at the [[Peru, New York|Peru]] town line.<ref name="nymap07"/>

=== Clinton County ===
Just south of the [[Peru (CDP), New York|hamlet of Peru]], the short [[New York State Route 442|NY&nbsp;442]] terminates at Route&nbsp;22. In the hamlet itself, after the Little Au Sable River crossing, NY&nbsp;22's other suffixed route, NY&nbsp;22B, branches off further inland. NY&nbsp;22 continues north of Peru, and returns to the Northway's side again in a mile. After another five miles, it has its first exit on the Northway near the now-closed [[Plattsburgh Air Force Base]]. It continues northeastward, crossing the [[Saranac River]] into [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]],<ref name="nymap07"/> the first city and most populous community NY&nbsp;22 has passed through since White Plains.
[[Image:NY 22 northern terminus (as of 2008).jpg|left|thumb|The northern terminus of NY 22 as of 2008. However, the image was taken before the truncation]]
NY&nbsp;22 runs along South Catherine Street for a few blocks, then divides into [[one-way couplet]]s for the first time since Westchester County, with northbound traffic moving a block to the east to follow Oak Street, while southbound traffic comes down North Catherine Street. It parallels US&nbsp;9 for a couple of blocks, intersecting [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]] (Cornelia Street) just a block west of its eastern terminus at that highway. After Boynton Avenue, the separate streets reunite and turns northwest just before it has its second and final exit with the Northway. Just after the exit, [[New York State Route 374|NY&nbsp;374]] begins along the westbound route as NY&nbsp;22 turns to the north once again.<ref name="nymap07"/>

The highway follows the railroad tracks into [[Beekmantown, New York|Beekmantown]] until it bears left at a fork, trending further west to Beekmantown Corners, where another short local road, [[New York State Route 456|NY&nbsp;456]], comes to its western end. After crossing into the next town, [[Chazy, New York|Chazy]], NY&nbsp;22 bears left again at another fork to drift further to the west.<ref name="nymap07"/> The terrain around the road becomes increasingly wooded, with long unbroken stretches of pine, in the northern portion of the town. This is briefly broken at another western terminus of a short local road, [[New York State Route 191|NY&nbsp;191]], in the hamlet of Sciota.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=a50|title=Beekmantown, NY quadrangle|year=1979|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref>

Route&nbsp;22 continues past Sciota in a fairly straight north-northwesterly course through more woods with small home and farm clearings. Those yield to mostly fields just before the [[Great Chazy River]], after which NY&nbsp;22 comes to an end at [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]] in [[Mooers (CDP), New York|Mooers]].<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=b50|title=West Chazy, NY quadrangle|year=1979|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=a50|title=Mooers, NY quadrangle|year=1979|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref> <!--After passing through the [[Canada Border Services Agency|Canadian customs]] station, the roadway continues an additional 46 km (29 miles) to [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec|Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]] as [[Quebec Route 219]].<ref name="QC219">{{cite map|publisher=Google Maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from:+RTE-219+%4045.004945,+-73.603834+to:+RTE-219+%4045.279400,+-73.361838+to:Rue+St-Jacques+%4045.306180,+-73.269290&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=il|title=Overview Map of Quebec Route 219 |accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref>-->

==History==
===Old roads===
The road from the modern-day Bronx (then part of Westchester County) through White Plains to Bedford and points north was originally an old Indian path.<ref name=nyt83>{{cite news |author=Roberta Hershenson|title=Old Indian Trail Called Route 22|work=[[New York Times]] |date=1983-08-21|page=WC1}}</ref> This path was later used and widened by the first European settlers. During colonial times, the road was known as "the road to Bedford and Vermont".<ref name=nyt83/> Further north, near Lake Champlain, the route now used by Route&nbsp;22 was used by the [[St. Francis Indians]] of Canada as they went south to find warmer fishing areas.<ref name=nyt50>{{cite news|work=[[New York Times]]|title=Topics of the Times|date=1950-07-23|page=E8}}</ref> The old road was also used heavily during the [[American Revolution]] to transport iron south from the mines in the [[Adirondacks]].<ref name=nyt50/>

Once [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] became the county seat of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] in 1759, the road between this village and the city of New York (then encompassing only [[Manhattan]]) became an important route and was established as the '''White Plains Post Road'''. Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] along the old [[Boston Post Road]].<ref name=jenkins>{{cite book |accessdate=2007-11-30 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E9nIC6Lva5sC&printsec=titlepage#PPA209,M1 |author=S. Jenkins|title=The Story of the Bronx|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons |date=1912| pages=Chap. X}}</ref> A new bridge over the [[Harlem River]] (the original [[Harlem Bridge]]) was opened in 1797, shortening the route out of Manhattan. This also relocated the Boston and White Plains Post Roads to a new alignment along [[Third Avenue (Bronx)|Third Avenue]] and [[Boston Road (Bronx)|Boston Road]]. The White Plains Post Road separated from the Boston Post Road in Bronxdale, with the road to Boston heading east and the road to White Plains heading north. The old White Plains Post Road roughly followed the alignment of modern-day ''White Plains Road'', which was laid out in 1863.<ref name=jenkins/> (The original post road was to the east of the modern-day avenue). The White Plains Post Road continued north through [[Olinville, New York|Olinville]], [[Wakefield, New York|Wakefield]], and [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]], where the route shifted east to modern-day ''White Plains Post Road'', going through [[Bronxville, New York|Bronxville]] and [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]] to [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].<ref name=comstock>{{cite book|accessdate=2007-11-30 |author=State of New York|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9qs3AAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA290|author=S.

The stretch from Salem to the [[Vermont]] border in [[Granville, New York|Granville]] was part of the old [[Northern Turnpike]], which began in [[Lansingburgh, New York|Lansingburgh]] and went along modern-day [[New York State Route 40|Route&nbsp;40]]. The Northern Turnpike was chartered on [[April 1]], [[1799]].<ref name="northern turnpike">{{cite book|accessdate=2007-11-30|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KJEDAAAAQAAJ |publisher=Packard and Van Benthuysen |author=State of New York |title=The Revised Statutes of the State of New-York, 1827-1828|year=1829|pages=Vol. III, pp. 587-624}}</ref>

===Public ownership===
[[Image:NY 22 Patterson.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of State Road in Patterson, which would later become part of 22]]
In 1868, the [[New York Legislature|New York State Legislature]] formed a commission "to regulate, grade, widen, gravel, and improve the old White Plains Post Road", which was amended in 1870 to "macadamize the road"<ref>{{cite book|accessdate=2007-11-30|author=State of New York |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dHo4AAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA568 |title=Statutes at Large of the State of New York, 1867|publisher=Weed, Parsons & Co.|year=1870 |pages=p. 568}}</ref> between Mount Vernon and White Plains. The post road south of Mount Vernon, which was part of New York City, was later widened between 1902 and 1908.<ref name=jenkins/>

[[State highway]]s were first formally defined by the state legislature in 1909 and given numeric designations,<ref>{{cite book|accessdate=2007-11-30 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hZ4AAAAAMAAJ|title=New York State, Laws of 1909, Chap. 30 (The Highway Law)|publisher=J. B. Lyon |year=1919|author=State of New York}}</ref> although these initial designations were not publicly signed. Portions of modern Route&nbsp;22 were defined as part of legislative routes&nbsp;1 and 22. Legislative route&nbsp;1 went from the New York City line north along the White Plains Post Road to White Plains, then detoured to Harrison (via Westchester Avenue), before proceeding north to [[Armonk, New York|Armonk]] (via modern [[New York State Route 120|NY&nbsp;120]]). Legislative route&nbsp;1 continued north along modern NY&nbsp;22 to Austerlitz, where it then turned northwest to Valatie (via modern [[New York State Route 203|NY&nbsp;203]]), then followed [[US 9 (NY)|US&nbsp;9]] to Albany. Legislative route&nbsp;22 had two segments. The southern segment began in Troy, following [[New York State Route 7|NY&nbsp;7]] to Hoosick, then went north along modern NY&nbsp;22 up to Putnam Station (south of Ticonderoga).

===Route 22 designation===
In 1924, New York signed several major state roads with route numbers. Most of Legislative route&nbsp;1 was designated as NY&nbsp;22, but with a direct route between White Plains and Armonk.<ref name=1924n/> Also, instead of continuing to Valatie, NY&nbsp;22 initially ended at [[Hillsdale, New York|Hillsdale]] (at the intersection with [[NY 23]]).<ref name=1924n/> By 1929, the road to Valatie had been improved and NY&nbsp;22 was extended to [[U.S. Route 9 (New York)|U.S. Route 9]], with a length of {{convert|139|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=1930gb>{{cite book|author=Automobile Legal Association (ALA)|title=Automobile Green Book, 1930/31 edition|publisher=Scarborough Motor Guide Co|year=1930}}</ref> The middle section of modern NY 22 was designated in 1924 as NY&nbsp;24, running for {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} from [[Stephentown, New York|Stephentown]] to [[Comstock, New York|Comstock]].<ref name=1924n/> The portion of modern NY&nbsp;22 north of Whitehall remained unnumbered in 1924 but gained the designation of NY&nbsp;30 in 1925, when the original NY&nbsp;30, which began in [[Mechanicville, New York|Mechanicville]], was extended north of Whitehall to the Canadian border.<ref>{{cite book|author=Automobile Legal Association (ALA)|title=Automobile Green Book, 1925 edition|publisher=Scarborough Motor Guide Co|year=1925}}</ref> In the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]], the NY&nbsp;24 and NY&nbsp;30 designations were both reassigned elsewhere. The NY&nbsp;22 designation was extended north along old NY&nbsp;24 and NY&nbsp;30,<ref name=renum/> incorporating newly improved roads between Austerlitz and Stephentown, resulting in a route length of {{convert|370|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|author=Automobile Legal Association (ALA)|title=Automobile Green Book, 1931/32 edition|publisher=Scarborough Motor Guide Co|year=1931}}</ref> The segment of old NY&nbsp;22 between Austerlitz and Valatie was renumbered to [[New York State Route 203|NY&nbsp;203]].<ref name=renum/>
[[Image:Harlem - W124st - Malcolm X - south.jpg|left|thumb|View down Lenox Avenue from West 124th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard. This was once part of NY 22 in Manhattan]]
In December 1934, at the insistence of the [[Automobile Club of New York]], several numbered routes were extended and signed within [[New York City]], with NY&nbsp;22 being one of these routes. NY&nbsp;22 was extended south from the Mount Vernon line in the Bronx along [[White Plains Road]], then it shifted via [[East 233rd Street (Bronx)|East 233rd Street]] to [[Webster Avenue]] until [[Fordham Road]] ([[U.S. Route 1 (New York)|US&nbsp;1]]). From Fordham Road, it continued south along the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] (overlapped with [[New York State Route 100|NY&nbsp;100]]), crossing into Manhattan via [[East 149th Street (Bronx)|East 149th Street]] to the [[145th Street Bridge]]. In Manhattan, the NY&nbsp;22/100 pair continued south along [[Lenox Avenue]], [[110th Street (Manhattan)|110th Street]], [[Fifth Avenue]], [[96th Street (Manhattan)|96th Street]], and [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]], ending at [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston Street]] ([[NY 1A]]).<ref>{{cite news|work=[[New York Times]]|title=Mark ways in the city|date=1934-12-16|page=XX12|accessdate=2007-11-30}}</ref> By 1941, the alignment within Mount Vernon was shifted east to use Columbus Avenue and South 3rd Avenue (current NY&nbsp;22), continuing its route to New York City via East 233rd Street as before.<ref>{{cite map|year=1941|url=http://www.nycroads.com/history/1941_metro-4/|title=New York metropolitan area|publisher=Gousha|accessdate=2007-11-30}}</ref> On [[January 1]], [[1970]], the NY&nbsp;22 designation was removed from Manhattan and most of the Bronx, and the short piece remaining in the city was realigned to meet US&nbsp;1 at its current southern terminus.<ref name="1970log">{{cite web|url=http://www.greaternyroads.info/pdfs/state70.pdf|title=Official description of touring routes in New York State as of January 1, 1970|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|date=1970|accessdate=2007-11-30|format=PDF}}</ref>

===U.S. Route 7===
In the original plan for the [[U.S. Highway System]], as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926,<ref>{{cite map|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1926us.jpg|title=U.S. Highway System as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926|year=1926|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture}}</ref> [[U.S. Route 7]] was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY&nbsp;22 to [[Amenia, New York|Amenia]], where it shifted northeast into [[Sharon, Connecticut]] to use old [[New England Route 4]] through Massachusetts and Vermont all the way to the Canadian border. Apparently New York State did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by [[AASHO]] (now known as [[AASHTO]]) had been amended so that the southern end of US&nbsp;7 began in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] instead.<ref>{{cite book|author=American Association of State Highway Officials|title=United States Numbered Highways|date=1927}}</ref>

=== State Route 9N concurrency ===
When the [[1930 New York State Route renumbering]] occurred, the stretch from Ticonderoga to Keeseville (now concurrent with [[New York State Route 9N]] was Route 22 alone. [[New York State Route 47 (1930)|Route 47]] was also located at an intersection with Route 22 in Ticonderoga. From Westport to Keeseville, Route 9N was then known as New York State Route 195, and was concurrent with Route 22. At the time, Route 9N only stretched from Elizabethtown to Keeseville, and by 1938, was extended over 195 and 47, becoming concurrent with 22 up to Keeseville.<ref name=renum /> 

Also, during the 1930s, Route 8, which ended in Chestertown, was extended onto 9N, where it made a 3-way concurrency from Ticonderoga to Crown Point, where it turned off the highway onto Bridge Road.<ref name="1936map"/> Route 8 remained intact along this routing until the late 1960s, when Route 8 was truncated back to NY 9N in [[Hague, New York|Hague]].<ref name="1970log"/>

===Realignments===
[[Image:Dutchess CR 81 with blade sign.jpg|right|thumb|Dutchess CR 81, a realigned section of NY 22]]
Over the course of many years, several sections of NY&nbsp;22 were straightened, realigned to new roads, or both. Some old alignments are still either county-maintained or state-maintained. Several old alignments are still marked in [[Dutchess County, NY|Dutchess County]]: '''NY&nbsp;980G''' (a [[reference route (New York)|reference route]]) in [[Dover Plains, New York|Dover Plains]] at the south junction with [[New York State Route 343|NY&nbsp;343]]; '''County Route&nbsp;81''' between Wingdale and Amenia in the town of [[Amenia (town), New York|Amenia]]; and '''County Route&nbsp;6''' between the hamlets of Wingdale and Dover Plains, along the west bank of the [[Tenmile River]], in the town of [[Dover, New York|Dover]].<ref name="1936map">{{cite map|title=New York|publisher=Esso|cartography=[[General Drafting]]|year=1936}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=aa50|title=Dover Plains, NY quadrangle|year=1989|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref> Within the 44/22 concurrency, the intersection with '''County Route&nbsp;5''' south of Millerton is also a former alignment of Route&nbsp;22.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from%3A%20CR-5%2FSmithfield%20Rd%20%4041.909478%2C%20-73.540816%20to%3A%20CR-5%2FOld%20Route%2022%20%4041.922900%2C%20-73.537818&um=1&sa=N&tab=wl|title=Overview map of Dutchess CR 5 (Old Route 22)|publisher=Google Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref>

==Suffixed routes==
[[Image:NY 22B-NY 3 jn 1.jpg|right|thumb|NY 22B at its junction with NY 3]]
NY&nbsp;22 has two suffixed routes, both in the [[North Country, New York|North Country]].
*'''[[New York State Route 22A|NY&nbsp;22A]]''' ({{convert|10.61|mi|km|2|abbr=on}}<ref name="traffic counts" />) is a spur connecting NY&nbsp;22 to the [[Vermont]] state line south of [[Fair Haven, Vermont|Fair Haven]]. Once in Vermont, the route becomes [[Vermont Route 22A|VT&nbsp;22A]].
*'''NY&nbsp;22B''' ({{convert|10.90|mi|km|2|abbr=on}}<ref name="traffic counts" />) is a bypass around the southern and western extents of [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]]. NY&nbsp;22B begins at NY&nbsp;22 in [[Peru (CDP), New York|Peru]] and continues north through [[Schuyler Falls, New York|Schuyler Falls]] to [[Morrisonville, New York|Morrisonville]], where it terminates at [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]] near [[Clinton County Airport]].
