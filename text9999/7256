After retiring from Saraswata Matha, Nigamananda spent the last fourteen years of his life in [[Puri]]. [[Durga Charan Mohanty]], a school student, met him at [[Nilachala Kutir]] in 1930 and recognized him as [[sadguru]].<ref name="absmath.org">[http://absmath.org/en/nigamananda/Lifestory.htm Events-Life History of Swami Nigamananda]</ref> Mohanty became Nigamananda's disciple and wrote books for Nigamananda's establishment [[Nilachala Saraswata Sangha]] and translated Nigamananda's Bengali books into [[Oriya language|Oriya]]. Under Mohanty's encouragement, more than 100 [[ashram]]s operate in [[Orissa]].

Satchidananda directed Nigamananda to undertake pilgrimages to the four institutions ([[Char Dham]]) of religious seats and realize for himself the significance of each, as the [[Hindu]]s held these places of worship sacred.<ref>[http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/june2006/engpdf/13.pdf Mahadham Orissa Review, June 2006] By Govt. of [[Orissa]]</ref> After these pilgrimages, he returned to the ashram.

On his arrival at the ashram, Sachidananda reviewed Nigamananda<U+2019>s pilgrimages and said: "My boy! You have travelled widely and seen the religious places and acquired knowledge and experience. All that I had to teach you has been accomplished but it is for you now to put my teachings into practice.

Again Nigamananda went out to seek a guru. In 1903 he met a "yogi guru" ([[yoga]] master) - whom he called "Sumeru Dasji" (otherwise known as [[Koot Hoomi Lal Singh]] or Kuthumi). Nigamananda was accepted as his disciple. Under Das's guidance he learned yoga.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=6eVWAAAAMAAJ&q=search Religious movements in modern Bengal] Author-Benoy Gopal Ray, Visva-Bharati, 1965,''After continuous search he found a Yogi Guru Sumeru Das ji....''

=== Recognition as paramahamsa (1904) ===

In 1904 Nigamananda went to [[Allahabad]] to see [[Kumbh Mela|kumbha mela]] and learned that his master Sachidandand was in the area, staying with [[Sankaracarya]] of [[Sringeri Matha]]. He found Sankaracarya (mahant or superior) sitting on an elevated throne surrounded by 125 [[sadhu|monks]], including his guru. Seeing him, Nigamananda went first to pay his respects to his guru, and then to the higher-ranking mahant. The sadhu were upset by this perceived disrespect in not honoring the "mahant" first, but in response Nigamananda quoted the scripture: "Mannatha  shri jagannatha madguru shri jagadguru madatma sarvabhutatma tasmai shri gurave namaha (<U+092E><U+0928><U+093E><U+0925><U+0939> <U+0936><U+094D><U+0930><U+0940> <U+091C><U+0917><U+0928><U+094D><U+0928><U+093E><U+0925> <U+092E><U+0926><U+0917><U+0941><U+0930><U+0941> <U+0936><U+094D><U+0930><U+0940> <U+091C><U+0917><U+0926><U+0917><U+0941><U+0930><U+0941> <U+092E><U+0926><U+093E><U+0924><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E> <U+0938><U+0930><U+094D><U+0935><U+092D><U+0942><U+0924><U+093E><U+0924><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E> <U+0924><U+0938><U+094D><U+092E><U+0948> <U+0936><U+094D><U+0930><U+0940> <U+0917><U+0941><U+0930><U+0935><U+0947> <U+0928><U+092E><U+0903>)", meaning, "My guru is highest in whole world, hence I should respect my guru first".<ref name="Chinmoy2003">{{cite book|author=Sri Chinmoy|title=Wisdom of Sri Chinmoy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vKiFI67GIFMC&pg=PA82|accessdate=30 July 2011|series='''Should one always consider his Guru the Highest'''|date=1 March 2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1943-6|pages=82<U+2013>}}</ref><ref>[http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1983/gjuly83/stotram.shtml Gurustotram Yoga Magazine]</ref><ref>[http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/books/0455/1/5 ''My Guru Is The Highest'']</ref> Nigamananda further explained to the sadhu assemblies that "on the basis of the [[vedanta philosophy]] there was no difference between his "Guru" (Shri Sachidanand Saraswati) and "Jagadguru" (Shri Shankarcharya)".<ref name="India)1982">{{cite book|author=<U+0100>di <U+015A>a<U+1E45>kara Advaita Research Centre (Madras, India)|coauthors=''Non-difference between Guru and AcSrya JAGADGURU''|title=The Voice of <U+015A>a<U+1E45>kara|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pafWAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 June 2011|year=1982|publisher=<U+0100>di <U+015A>a<U+1E45>kara Advaita Research Centre|page=140}}</ref><ref name="Fitzgerald2008">{{cite book|author=Michael Oren Fitzgerald|coauthors=''The voice of the Jagadguru is an essential part of his message.

To achieve the above objectives, he initiated thousands of interested men and women of all walks of life and taught them his spiritual practices. They were devoid of sectarian bias in that they did not provide a complete package of worship, prayer and meditation. He encouraged his disciples to meet periodically in groups ([[sangha]]) of three or more to offer prayer and worship to the guru, to exchange spiritual experiences and to chant "jayaguru" (<U+091C><U+092F><U+0917><U+0941><U+0930><U+0941> <U+0B1C><U+0B5F><U+0B17><U+0B41><U+0B30><U+0B41>),<ref name="(Pur<U+012B>India)2001">{{cite book|author1=Nilachal Saraswat Sangh (Pur<U+012B>|author2=India)|title=Sadguru Swami Nigamananda|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=El8qAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=23 March 2011|year=2001|publisher=Nilachal Saraswat Sangha, Puri|page=295}}</ref> a non-sectarian word he invented, meaning "Glory due to the Master". He instructed them to read spiritual books and devise ways and means for managing [[matha]] and ashrams and pledging to lead the life of a spiritually inspired ideal householder. He advised his disciples that the glory of God or Guru is experienced through the medium of the word "jayaguru". One can reach at God through this name since God is the Guru or Master of the Universe. People belonging to any sect or creed can accept this name without any risk to their progress in the religious life.<ref>An article published in www.geocities.com from ''Swami Chetanananda Saraswati''</ref>

== Philosophy and teachings ==

[[File:Sacred lotus Nelumbo nucifera.jpg|144px|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] had told [[Arjuna]] about the relationship between Guru and God during the course of His teaching. He had used the word "AHAM" when He meant Himself as Guru and "TAT" when He meant God. He mentioned God in the following verses: ''tat-prasadat param santim sthanam prapsyasi sasvatam'' [[Bhagavadgeeta|(Bhagvad Gita 18.62)]].<ref name="Chinmayananda">{{cite book|author=Swami Chinmayananda|title=Srimad Bhagawada Gita: Chapter XVIII|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VMX3-54zcYMC&pg=PA146|accessdate=16 July 2011|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|isbn=978-81-7597-098-4|pages=146 or (484 10.39)}}</ref>]]

Nigamananda was a [[sanyasi]] of the [[Adi Shankara]] cult. He studied [[vedanta philosophy]] due to Shankaracharya after he was initiated as a sanyasi of that order.<ref name="Bagchee1987">{{cite book|author=Moni Bagchee|title=Sadguru Nigamananda: a spiritual biography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nrkcAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2 August 2011|year=1987|publisher=Assam Bangiya Saraswat Math|page=76}}</ref>

Nigamananda's core-teachings were that guru and [[Istha-deva|istha]] are identical and that disciples should adopt ideals of [[Adi Shankara|Lord Shankar]] (i.e. the path of ''gyan'') and ideals of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Lord Gaurang]] (i.e. the path of ''bhakti''). He indicated that Shankar's disciplines were difficult and that Lord Gaurang offered an easier path. According to Nigamananda, Shankar and Gaurang provide a sweet combination of Gyan and Bhakti to lead the world in the right way.<ref name="Nigam<U+0101>nanda1997">{{cite book|author=Nigam<U+0101>nanda|title=The divine universal gospels of Sri Nigamananda: translation, a lucid word to word rendering to English|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WXTXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 October 2011|series='''THE PHILOSOPHY OF ACHARYA SANKARA AND PATH OF GOURANGA DEVA '''|year=1997|publisher=Amitabh Giri|page=122}}</ref><ref>[http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HTB/102497.htm Banglapedia, Nigamananda was initiated as a Samnyasi of Shankar's Order]</ref>

Nigamananda's philosophy and teachings as per ''Chetanananda Saraswati'' are explained here:

=== Avatar and Sadguru ===

Nigamananda never admitted that he was God-incarnate or an [[Avatar]] (<U+0905><U+0935><U+0924><U+093E><U+0930>) although many disciples fancied him as one.<ref name="Bagchee1987">{{cite book|author=Moni Bagchee|title=Sadguru Nigamananda: a spiritual biography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nrkcAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2011|year=1987|publisher=Assam Bangiya Saraswat Math|pages=111<U+2013>112 ("I am No Avatar, just a Sadguru")}}</ref> He stated that an incarnation is an exclusive descent of God on earth to uphold spiritual order. Although he could, the Avatar ordinarily does not enlighten or guide individuals. Through his agency righteousness is established and demonic forces are destroyed. Nigamananda wanted to be treated as a Sadguru (a perfect spiritual Master, also one form of God) who, on account of his quest over a succession of births and deaths, attained the knowledge of his Swaroop <U+0938><U+094D><U+0935><U+0930><U+0941><U+092A> (true or potential nature, i.e., supreme universal consciousness). Scriptural evidence shows that Gautam himself had to pass through many births before realising the truth and becoming the [[Buddha]].<ref name="Gupta1983">{{cite book|author=S. K.

=== Sadguru, Jagadguru and God ===

According to Nigamananda the disciple should take his Guru to be the Jagadguru (or the World Master, the [[Purushottama]]) and not an ordinary human being, in tune with [[Krishna]]'s statement in the [[Bhagavadgeeta]]:<ref name="(Pur<U+012B>India)2001">{{cite book|author1=Nilachal Saraswat Sangh (Pur<U+012B>|author2=India)|title=Sadguru Swami Nigamananda|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=El8qAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=4 April 2011|year=2001|publisher=Nilachal Saraswat Sangha, Puri|pages=''Google search string "sadguru jagadguru god nigamananda"''}}</ref>

<blockquote>{{Quotation|''He who truely knows My birth and activities to be divine is not born again but attains to Me''&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Bhagavadgeeta|Bhagavadgeeta (4.9)]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bhagavad-gitaasitis.com/ | title = PURPORT| accessdate = 2011-07-09 | last = Pada | first = Prabhu | work = Bhagavad-gita As It Is&nbsp;<U+2013> Macmillan 1972 Edition | publisher = Prabhupad Book Stores | quote = One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.}}</ref> }}</blockquote>

[[Pata<U+00F1>jali|Patanjali's]] aphorism expands this idea: "By contemplating on the form of one who has no attachments, concentration of mind is attained", Nigamananda advised his disciples to meditate on his physical form such that all the admirable qualities and attributes in him would get automatically transferred into their beings and fashion their souls.<ref name="(Swami)1985">{{cite book|author=Bi<U+015B>uddh<U+0101>nanda Sarasvat<U+012B> (Swami)|title=In quest of myself: an autobiography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UVUqAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=12 April 2011|edition=Quote of Swami Nigamananda|year=1985|publisher=Nigamananda Ashram|page=57}}</ref> Further he assured that because he had, by employing three modes of spiritual practice, simultaneously experienced the nature of Brahman (<U+092C><U+094D><U+0930><U+0939><U+094D><U+092E>), Paramatma (<U+092A><U+0930><U+092E><U+093E><U+0924><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E>) (supreme universal self) and Bhagawan (<U+092D><U+0917><U+0935><U+093E><U+0928>) (personal and universal Godhead.) He proclaimed that his disciples would simultaneously have such an experience. That, he said, "was his only expectation from his disciples and he would love to wait for the day to see that fulfilled".<ref name="Madras1967">{{cite book|author=Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras|title=The Vedanta kesari|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pVNRAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=9 July 2011|year=1967|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math.|page=492}}</ref>

=== Order of Spiritual Attainments ===

According to Nigamananda, the theory of self-realization requires expanding the individual self to the status of the supreme universal self. The expansions can be directly practiced only by the most competent among the aspirant ''[[Sanyas|samyasis]]'' by means of precise intellectual inquiry, analysis and deep meditation, although service to the Master is the key to success in such pursuits as well.<ref name="googlebooks">[http://books.google.co.in/books?ei=JzKgTbWDA46yrAfZ76mDAw&ct=result&id=El8qAAAAYAAJ&dq=nigamananda+jivanmukta&q=Jivanmukta+Upasana+ Swami Nigamananda's JIVANMUKTA UPASANA (''realisation of truth or liberation in the present life'')THEORY, Book: Sadguru Swami Nigamananda (Page:207)] By NSS Puri (India).</ref> However, Nigamananda pointed out that true transcendental divine love and ecstasy could be properly experienced by the most fortunate ones only after they had attained [[monism|monistic]] realization of the supreme as declared by [[Lord Krishna]] himself in the Bhagavadgeeta:

<blockquote>{{Quotation|''Having realized the state of oneness with the supreme self or Parabrahman and attaining tranquility in spirit, the aspirant neither grieves nor desires and regarding all beings as alike he attains supreme devotion to Me'' - [[Bhagavadgeeta|Bhagavadgeeta (18.54)]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bhagavad-gitaasitis.com/ | title = PURPORT| accessdate = 2011-07-09 | last = Pada | first = Prabhu | work = Bhagavad-gita As It Is&nbsp;<U+2013> Macmillan 1972 Edition | publisher = Prabhupad Book Stores | quote = One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.}}</ref> }}</blockquote>

=== Reconciliation of Monistic and Dualistic Pursuits ===

Unlike saints who recognized and preached a diversity of doctrines for self / God realisation and offered multiple paths to attain them, Nigamananda suggested the realisation of the oneness of self and the supreme universal self (or [[Parabrahman]]-<U+092A><U+0930><U+0902><U+092C><U+094D><U+0930><U+0939><U+094D><U+092E>) as the true and the highest goal of human life.<ref name="Ray1965">{{cite book|author=Benoy Gopal Ray|title=Religious movements in modern Bengal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=btYXAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 July 2011|year=1965|publisher=Visva-Bharati|page=102}}</ref>

For most aspirants the path is one of true devotion to the perfect spiritual master (Sadguru) who initiates them. Rendering personal service to the Master and invoking his grace through prayers, chanting and simple meditation are the chief modes of spiritual practice for them. They will acquire non-dualistic realization that their Master is a realized soul (Brahmajnani-<U+092C><U+094D><U+0930><U+0939><U+094D><U+092E><U+091C><U+094D><U+091E><U+093E><U+0928><U+0940>) and experience bliss due to intense love for him over the course of time, when they are enabled to participate in his Leela (love play-<U+0932><U+093F><U+0932><U+093E>) for helping others.

Nigamananda pointed out that the path shown by Gouranga, who practiced and preached unconditional devotion and love for God, was rather narrow, inasmuch as it was directed to [[Sri Krishna]] as the only God. In order to broaden that path, Nigamananda suggested taking the master as an embodiment of [[Sri Krishna]] (or any other deity whom the aspirant loved), in which case the guide himself becomes the goal. In this way Nigamananda convincingly reconciled the two apparently contradictory creeds of Shankaracharya and Gauranga who advocated the principle and practice of apparent duality between the devotee and God. After all, Nigamananda pointed out that in the path of devotion and love the aspirant has to subdue or tame his ego adequately and hence he attains to the same stage as that of the monastic aspirant whose ego loses its identity on attaining to his goal. In the former case, the devotee's individuality is reduced to a trifle, overpowered by personal god-consciousness, whereas in the latter the aspirant loses his self-consciousness in the ocean of impersonal universal consciousness.<ref name="Nigam<U+0101>nanda1997">{{cite book|author=Nigam<U+0101>nanda|title=The divine universal gospels of Sri Nigamananda: translation, a lucid word to word rendering to English|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WXTXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|series='''THE PHILOSOPHY OF ACHARYA SANKARA AND PATH OF GOURANGA DEVA '''|year=1997|publisher=Amitabh Giri|page=122}}</ref>

Nigamananda pointed out that although the doctrine of monastic vedanta philosophy treats the supreme reality in terms of oneness of individual and universal consciousness, it does not systematically explain the structure of the material creation that is addressed by [[Samkhya philosophy]].<ref name="Bagchee1987">{{cite book|author=Moni Bagchee|title=Sadguru Nigamananda: a spiritual biography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nrkcAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|series='''Yoga philosophy in its metaphysical aspects is closely allied to Samkhya philosophy'''|year=1987|publisher=Assam Bangiya Saraswat Math|page=9}}</ref>

This latter does not treat the supreme reality as well. Similarly, whereas [[Christianity]] emphasizes service and surrender as means to God realization, the Indian philosophy of [[Poorva Mimamsa]] prescribes various rituals for the attainment of personal and collective happiness despite cycles of birth and death.

=== Other key teachings ===

Other key teachings of Nigamananda as stated by ''Chetnananda Saraswati'' are:

* Spiritual liberation requires the help of a liberated person (a Master Sadguru or simply Guru). In the Hindu scriptures that person is known as Guru. Without his grace or favor none can make progress. He who has attained the ultimate reality (Paramatman or Brahman) as one and the same as himself (the Atman) is the Guru.<ref name="DasGangopadhyay2001">{{cite book|author1=Manoj Das|author2=Neeta Gangopadhyay|author3=Sahitya Akademi|title=Tales told by mystics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z5KBAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 April 2011|year=2001|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1175-9|pages=xii<U+2013>233}}</ref>
* The Guru cannot be equated in importance to formal learning, pilgrimage or divinity. No other is more worthy of respect.
* The Guru is the embodiment of what the Vedanta teaches&nbsp;<U+2013> the individual self (the Atman) is one and the same as the cosmic self (Paramatman or Brahman).
* A Sadguru never curses anyone. Even his anger helps the disciple. The advantage of depending on a Sadguru is unique and is superior to depending on God because God never materializes to give instructions.
* The Guru and the disciple are inseparable in a way. The Guru cannot exist without being a part of a true disciple<U+2019>s personality or character.
* The two pathways to liberation are by initiation into and observation of the austerities of [[sannyasa]] yoga or by service to a Sadguru. The former is extremely arduous&nbsp;<U+2013> the disciple must in a sense die. In other words, he must lose body consciousness. But if one unconditionally loves the Guru by way of rendering service to him sincerely, spiritual liberation may be obtained relatively easily.
* Nothing substantial can be achieved without Guru<U+2019>s grace.
* The mantra that Guru gives during initiation and the disciple<U+2019>s chosen divinity (or [[Personal god|Ista]]) are the same. Unless the Guru becomes the chosen divinity, the mantra received loses its power.<ref name="Eliot1998">{{cite book|author=Sir Charles Eliot|coauthors=''Guru and Ista (deity) are one and the same''|title=Hinduism and Buddhism: an historical sketch|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kMnOBpUy7P4C&pg=PA210|accessdate=15 June 2011|year=1998|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-0679-2|pages=250<U+2013>}}</ref><ref name="Brahma2007">{{cite book|author=Brahma|coauthors=''No difference is supposed to exist between the guru and the ista''|title=The Fundamentals of Religion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=akPlrHBkOj8C&pg=PA252|accessdate=15 June 2011|date=1 August 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-3303-1|pages=252<U+2013>}}</ref>

* Acquisition of disciples is not Guru<U+2019>s profession; it is his heart's inspiration. The Guru cares for and guides the disciple hoping that one day the disciple will get spiritually enlightened.

* The Guru is the embodiment of both the monistic (non-dual) ideology due to the great Shankaracharya and love divine as preached by Sri Sri Gouranga Mahaprahbu. As the disciple submits to the Guru, his latent characteristics unfold. Spiritual life based on such a relationship can help harmonize the diverse faiths in the world.<ref name="Nigam<U+0101>nanda1997"/>

== Yoga, theories and techniques ==

The following theories are collected from the Oriya book ''Shri Shri Thakur Nigamananda'' (<U+0936><U+094D><U+0930><U+0940> <U+0936><U+094D><U+0930><U+0940> <U+0920><U+093E><U+0915><U+0941><U+0930> <U+0928><U+093F><U+0917><U+092E><U+093E><U+0928><U+0902><U+0926>) and the writer, Durga Charan Mohanty-Banamali Dash:

=== Theory of jibanamukta upasana ===

One of Nigamananda's major precepts was the theory of [[Jivanmukta|Jibanamukta Upasana]] (<U+091C><U+0940><U+0935><U+0928><U+092E><U+0941><U+0915><U+094D><U+0924> <U+0909><U+092A><U+093E><U+0938><U+0928><U+093E>), which he believed could lead the [[sadhaka]] to quick self-realization.<ref name="googlebooks"/><ref name="Bulletin of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture">{{cite book|title=Bulletin of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xjXkAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 April 2011|volume=Swami Nigamananda on "Tantra"& "Self realization" & "Death"|date=1 January 1969|publisher=The Institute|pages=130<U+2013>134}}</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=6eVWAAAAMAAJ&q=kokila Religious movements in modern Bengal] Author-Benoy Gopal Ray, Visva-Bharati, 1965,''I desire that Indian should rise once again and attain the ideals ancient Rishis who showed mankind the spirit light. Let them lead mankind to the full knowledge and realization of self....'' '''Page -102'''</ref>

=== Karmic theory ===

According to Nigamananda, [[karma]] is of three kinds viz. [[kriyamana karma|kriyaman]], [[Sanchita karma|sanchita]] and [[Prarabdha karma|prarbdha]].
Enjoying the results of one's labour while alive is kriyaman; death before enjoyment produces sanchita [[karma]] or accumulated labour. Enjoying accumulated karma after rebirth is prarbdha. By virtue of sadhana, the effects of kriyaman and sanchita can be wiped out during a life but it is not possible to erase prarbdha. A person possessed with worldly ambitions is sure to continue the endless journey of birth and death. [[Jiva]]tma leaves the gross body to travel in the spirit world or [[Ghost|pret lok]] (ghost world). After undergoing karmic effects, it returns to the physical world with a body for the fulfillment of desires from its prior incarnation. How it moves from one world to another is a mystery. Yogis can perceive the mystery and tell the past [[sanskar]] of jiva.<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?ei=nI-mTefhMcLyrQe245T-CQ&ct=result&id=xjXkAAAAMAAJ&dq=karma+nigamananda&q=nigamananda Bulletin of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture] ''Quote=Swami Nigamananda's Quote on "Death and Life",|Date=1 January 1969, Publisher=The Institute.

=== On death ===

Nigamananda's insight into death:

{{Quote box|quote=<small>You are not to live here for ever. Someday you will have to depart from this world. If you prepare yourself to face death you have to realize what death is, what exists after death and what happens to the soul when it makes its exit from this body. Man need not fear death since it is a process of promotion to a better life<ref name="Bulletin of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture">{{cite book|title=Bulletin of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xjXkAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 September 2011|date=1 January 1969|publisher=The Institute|page=134}}</ref></small>|align=right}}

Nigamananda said that one should remember that death is coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should also remember that death is not far off. Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment to wealth and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren. They will be left in the deserted crematory ground with the beasts and birds joyously waiting to feast upon their flesh. Thinking of this will drive evil thoughts from the mind.<ref name="Bulletin of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture"/><ref name="Bibudhara<U+00F1>jana2008">{{cite book|author=Bibudhara<U+00F1>jana|title=Divine death: Lord Jagannath, the new embodiment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p4HXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 April 2011|year=2008|publisher=Prajnaloka|isbn=978-81-89858-04-9|page=140}}</ref>

==== Hatha yoga and Laya yoga ====

[[Hatha yoga]] can be carried out when the body is made fit for the purpose. The body should be cleansed first of impurities through sat sadhna, the six elementary practices of yoga. Hatha yoga is completely different from [[laya yoga]]. Hatha yoga can make the body strong, enabling it to survive for four hundred years or more, whereas laya yoga helps the aspirant to attain union with the supreme. If the body is not kept purified both externally and internally with hatha yoga, attempting laya yoga would yield no result.<ref>[http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/dspace/handle/10689/3826 ''Yogi Guru -Bangla''(7th Edition)], Chapter:"HATH YOGA, LAYA YOGA (<U+0939><U+0920> <U+092F><U+094B><U+0917>-<U+0932><U+092F> <U+092F><U+094B><U+0917>)" , PAGES: 74-75 Author: Paramhansa, Nigamananda, West Bengal Public Library Network</ref><ref name="ReferenceC">Yogiguru NIGAMANANDA (Oriya), Edition-2011,"YOGA TATWA-<U+092F><U+094B><U+0917> <U+0924><U+0924><U+094D><U+0935>" (YOGA CHARI PRAKAR-<U+092F><U+094B><U+0917> <U+091A><U+093E><U+0930><U+0940> <U+092A><U+094D><U+0930><U+0915><U+093E><U+0930>)", PAGES:88-89 Writer: [[Durga Charan Mohanty]], Nilanchala Saraswata Sangha, Puri</ref>

==== Dharana and dhyan ====

Nigamananda taught that the breathing system is closely connected with the intricate workings of the mind. Therefore practice of [[pranayama]] leads to calmer breathing and thereby maintains tranquility of mind. Mind is subjected to forces of disturbed thoughts owing to irregular breathing. He said
"I had applied myself to the higher practices of yoga, thereafter, i.e. [[Dh<U+0101>ra<U+1E47><U+0101>|dharana]] and [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyan]] (mediation)". The sadhaka is likely to peril his life if he does not take assistance of another during these advanced practices. During [[Dh<U+0101>ra<U+1E47><U+0101>]], the sadhaka experiences his own progress and when the estimated height in sadhana is achieved, he enters into successive steps of progress. While being absorbed in the practice of [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyan]], the sadhaka may cross over to the state of samadhi. When he achieves this state of consciousness is not predictable. Until samadhi, the sadhaka gropes in the darkness aided by Guru.<ref name="ReferenceC">Yogiguru NIGAMANANDA (Oriya), Edition-2011,''Chapter:"YOGA TATWA-<U+092F><U+094B><U+0917> <U+0924><U+0924><U+094D><U+0935>'', PAGE:86 Writer: [[Durga Charan Mohanty]], Nilanchala Saraswata Sangha, Puri</ref><ref>[http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/dspace/handle/10689/3826 ''Yogi Guru -Bangla''(7th Edition)], ''Chapter:"DHARANA, DHANA-<U+0927><U+094D><U+092F><U+093E><U+0928> <U+0927><U+093E><U+0930><U+0928><U+093E>'' , PAGE: 70-71 Author: Paramahansa, Nigamananda, West Bengal Public Library Network</ref>

==== Sampragyant samadhi ====
