Shorter than most major leaguers, Fuld says: "When I realized I was going to be limited physically, I looked for guys in the big leagues who were little. I'd buy baseball cards and find anyone under 5<U+2013>10 who played in the outfield, and say, 'That's my guy; there's hope.'"<ref name=aao/> Despite his size, by the time he was 12 years old, Fuld was competing in a league of 14- to 16-year-olds.

In June 2009, Fuld married his high school sweetheart, Sarah.

==Diabetes==

Fuld was diagnosed with [[diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes]] when he was 10 years old.  He recalled, "I was losing weight, I was thirsty all the time, just classic symptoms, so my parents knew something was wrong and the doctor diagnosed it right away. It was tough, but when I realized there was no other alternative, I just looked at it as a challenge."<ref name=sten>{{cite web|author=Lisa Winston|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071114&content_id=2300768&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Fuld wins Stenson Award; Cubs prospect overcame juvenile diabetes on way to Majors |publisher=MLB.com |date=November 14, 2009|accessdate=June 2, 2009 }}</ref> 

At the age of 12, he met pitcher [[Bill Gullickson]], who also had diabetes, and talked to him for two minutes. "That was enough to inspire me," Fuld said.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|author=Carrie Muskat|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100317&content_id=8815166&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Fuld running down big league dream; Diabetes can't stop Cubs outfielder from competing for job|publisher=MLB.com|date=March 17, 2010|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref> "Any time I can talk to young diabetic kids, I look forward to that opportunity," said Gullickson.<ref>"Major League Dad", ''[[SouthtownStar]]'', February 3, 2008</ref>

Former Cub All Star third baseman [[Ron Santo]] was also afflicted with Type 1 diabetes.  Santo hid his ailment from others during his playing days, because he was afraid they would consider him weak.<ref name=autogenerated3/> Santo later had both his legs amputated, because of complications caused by his diabetes.<ref name=autogenerated3/>

Now, at least six times a day Fuld opens a small black case, withdraws a [[glucometer]], pricks a finger ("It's pretty painless; I've got calloused fingers"), and checks his [[blood sugar]] (a 30-second process).<ref name=autogenerated3/><ref name=dailyherald1/> He does it whenever he feels he should check his blood sugar level, even if he is in the clubhouse or the dugout.<ref name=autogenerated3/> He gives himself shots of [[insulin]] at breakfast and dinner times.<ref name=dailyherald1/><ref name=ins>{{cite web|last=Cornelius|first=Maria M.|title=Fuld Getting it Done|publisher=Inside Pitch|url=http://mets.scout.com/a.z?s=228&p=2&c=666558|date=August 9, 2007|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref>

Fuld is also comfortable handling the kidding in the clubhouse regarding his treatments. "We dish it out pretty good about his insulin shots,<U+201D> said his AA manager [[Pat Listach]]. "We always give him stuff about putting needles in the refrigerator, and shooting up in the clubhouse. He takes it all in stride. He<U+2019>s a good guy."<ref name=ins/>

Asked whether he thinks about his blood sugar level when he is chasing fly balls, he answered: "For those brief moments, it's out of my mind. I get back to the dugout, and it definitely crosses my mind. 'OK, my face is intact <U+2013> what about my sugar?'"<ref name=autogenerated3/>

==Baseball career==

Fuld attended [[Berwick Academy]] as an eighth grader, during which time the University of New Hampshire's baseball coach opined that he had the best batting swing of any player in the State.

In 2008, Fuld started the season with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs.

Fuld began the 2008 season at Triple-A Iowa, but was demoted to the Double-A Tennessee Smokies in May after struggling at the plate due to a right thumb injury.

In 2008, Fuld pushed Pie for the center field spot during spring training.  Piniella said that Pie was only "a head or nose in front" of Fuld,<ref>{{cite news|url=|title=Fuld, Pie in race for job in center|author=Paul Sullivan|accessdate=March 3, 2011| work=Chicago Tribune|date=February 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Antonen|first=Mel|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/2007-11-29-nl-needs_N.htm|title=Winter meetings preview: NL teams check lists twice|work=USA Today|date=December 1, 2007|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}</ref> and commented:

Asked which player he would most like to switch positions with, [[Geovany Soto]] said:

====Tampa Bay Rays (2011<U+2013>present)====
After the 2010 season, Fuld was traded to the [[Tampa Bay Rays]].  He was traded with minor leaguers [[Hak-Ju Lee]], [[Brandon Guyer]], [[Robinson Chirinos]], and [[Christopher Archer]] for starting pitcher [[Matt Garza]], outfielder [[Fernando Perez (baseball)|Fernando Perez]], and a minor league prospect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/news/story?id=5998431|author=Bruce Levine |title=Source: Cubs agree to Garza deal|publisher=ESPN |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110105&content_id=16392484&vkey=news_chc&c_id=chc|author=Carrie Muskat |title=Cubs, Rays close to completing deal for Matt Garza |publisher=MLB.com |date= January 7, 2011|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}</ref> 

Tommy Rancel of [[ESPN]] opined that Fuld is an early favorite to become the Rays' [[fourth outfielder]] or late-inning weapon off the bench, and be "Tampa Bay's version of [[Brett Gardner]]; albeit in a reduced role".<ref name="espn2"/>  Manager [[Joe Maddon]] noted what he referred to as Fuld's "freaky-weird" outstanding walks-to-strikeouts ratio:  325 walks vs. 272 strikeouts in his professional career.<ref name="autogenerated5">{{cite web|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2011/feb/27/280100/pirates-give-rays-first-spring-loss-10-3/sports-rays/ |title=Pirates give Rays first spring loss, 10<U+2013>3 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |date= February 27, 2011|author=Tony Fabrizio |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref>  Rays hitting coach [[Derek Shelton]] observed that: "[Fuld's] contact ratio is off the charts.
