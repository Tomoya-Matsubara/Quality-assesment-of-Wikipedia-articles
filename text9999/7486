He says the mispronunciation caught on in high school, and rather than fight it he just went with it.")</ref> born January 15, 1979 in [[Austin, Texas]]) is a [[quarterback]] for the [[New Orleans Saints]] of the [[National Football League]]. He was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the [[San Diego Chargers]] in the second round of the [[2001 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] where he was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.

Brees has been selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] four times in his career <U+2013> with the Chargers in [[2005 Pro Bowl|2004]] and the Saints in [[2007 Pro Bowl|2006]], [[2009 Pro Bowl|2008]], and [[2010 Pro Bowl|2009]]. He was named the NFL's [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]] in 2004, the [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|Offensive Player of the Year]] in 2008, and the [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]] of [[Super Bowl XLIV]].

He won the state championship with [[Westlake High School (Austin, Texas)|Westlake High School]] and also holds many records there.<ref>Martel, Brett. <U+2013> "Brees settles into new team, home <U+2013> Ex-Boiler hopes to do `something great'". <U+2013> [[Associated Press]] (c/o ''[[The Journal Gazette]]''). <U+2013> August 6, 2006. <U+2013> Retrieved: 2010-02-07.</ref>

==College career==
Brees graduated from [[Purdue University]] with a degree in [[Industrial Management]]. He left Purdue with [[Big Ten Conference]] records in passing yards (11,792), [[touchdown]] passes (90), total offensive yards (12,693), completions (1,026), and attempts (1,678). He led the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Boilermakers]] to the [[2001 Rose Bowl]], Purdue's first appearance there since 1967.  In the game Purdue lost by ten points to the Washington Huskies. Brees was a finalist for the [[Davey O'Brien Award]] as the nation's best quarterback in 1999. He won the [[Maxwell Award]] as the nation's outstanding player of 2000 and won the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Today's Top VIII Award]] as a member of the Class of 2001. Brees was also fourth in [[Heisman Trophy]] voting in 1999 and third in 2000. Brees also set an NCAA record with the longest pass ever (99 yards), to receiver [[Vinny Sutherland]] against [[Northwestern]] on September 25, 1999

As a senior, Brees was named the [[Academic All-America]] Player of the Year, the first Purdue player since [[Bruce Brineman]] (1989) to earn national academic honors. Brees also was awarded Purdue's Leonard Wilson Award for unselfishness and dedication.

==Professional career==
===San Diego Chargers===
====2001 NFL Draft====
Brees' college success led to projections that he would be a mid-to-late first round draft pick in the [[2001 NFL Draft]], but he slipped due to concerns about his relatively short stature for a professional quarterback (6'0"), a perceived lack of arm strength, and a sense that he had succeeded in college in a system designed for him. Ultimately, Brees was the second quarterback selected in the 2001 draft, chosen by the [[San Diego Chargers]] as the first pick of the second round.<ref name="AP2001">{{Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Trade works well as Chargers get Tomlinson, then Brees | date=April 21, 2001 | publisher= | url =http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/2001/draft/news/2001/04/21/chargers_draft_ap/ | work =[[Associated Press|AP]] at [[Sports Illustrated|SI.com]] | pages = | accessdate = 2010-01-19 | language = }}</ref>

San Diego originally had the first pick in that draft, but traded it to [[Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta]] (which used it to draft [[Michael Vick]]) in return for the fifth pick of the first round, with which San Diego drafted [[LaDainian Tomlinson]].<ref name="AP2001" />

====Early career====
Brees played in his first professional game on November 4, 2001 against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He had won the starting job over [[Doug Flutie]] during training camp before the start of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]], but was later replaced during the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]] by Flutie.

Brees' career with the Chargers was put in jeopardy after San Diego [[Rivers-Manning Trade|acquired]] [[North Carolina State Wolfpack football|NC State's]] [[Philip Rivers]]. After the trade, it was almost certain Brees' days as the Chargers' starting QB were over. However, Rivers held out nearly all of training camp. This forced the Chargers coaching staff to give Brees one last look and he remained the starter throughout the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]].  Brees was selected to the 2005 NFL Pro Bowl following an impressive 2004 season in which the Chargers won the AFC West. He was named 2004 [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]].

====2005====
Brees became a free agent after the season and was not expected to return to San Diego, which had already committed a large sum of money to Rivers. The team eventually designated Brees a [[franchise player]], giving him a one-year contract that quadrupled his pay to $8 million for [[2005 NFL season|2005]].

Under the terms of the franchise player contract, Brees was eligible to be traded or sign with another team, but the Chargers would have had to receive two future first round draft choices in return. He was not traded and continued to start the remainder of the 2005 season.

Brees continued his productive play in 2005, as he posted a career high in passing yards with 3,576. Brees also posted an 89.2 rating, 10th best in the NFL.  However, in the last game of the 2005 season against the [[2005 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], Brees tore his [[Glenoidal labrum|labrum]] while trying to pick up his own fumble after being hit by Broncos [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]]. Denver tackle [[Gerard Warren]] hit Brees while he was on the ground, causing the injury. Brees underwent [[arthroscopic surgery]] performed by [[Dr. James Andrews]] to repair the torn [[Glenoidal labrum|labrum]] in his right (throwing) shoulder on January 5, 2006. Subsequent reports mention additional [[rotator cuff]] damage. He also went to get treated by Dr. Saby Szajowitz after the surgery to recover from it and get his muscle moving.

Brees was selected as first alternate to the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] [[Pro Bowl]] team for the 2005 season. He would have played in his second consecutive Pro Bowl due to the injury to starter [[Carson Palmer]], but his own injury dictated that the AFC Pro Bowl roster would have to be filled by second alternate [[Jake Plummer]].

After the season, the Chargers offered Brees a 5-year, $50 million contract that paid $2 million in base salary the first year and the rest heavily based on performance incentives. Brees took the incentive-based offer as a sign of no confidence by the Chargers and promptly demanded the type of money a top 5 "franchise" quarterback would receive.

===New Orleans Saints===
[[Image:Brees london 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Brees warming up in [[Wembley Stadium]] in a game against his former team [[San Diego Chargers]]]]
After the Chargers refused to increase their offer, Brees met with other teams. The [[New Orleans Saints]] and the [[Miami Dolphins]] were interested. New Orleans made an offer that included $10 million in guaranteed money the first year and a $12 million option the second year. Miami was unsure if Brees' shoulder was completely healed and did not offer the money Brees was seeking. The Dolphins ended negotiations and traded for [[Minnesota Vikings]] QB [[Daunte Culpepper]] instead. Brees signed a 6-year, $60 million deal with the Saints on March 14, 2006.

====2006====
Brees had a productive first year with the Saints, as the team, under first-year head coach [[Sean Payton]], rebounded from its disastrous [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|2005 season]] (when the team was unable to play in New Orleans due to the damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]] and struggled to a 3<U+2013>13 record) to finish with a 10<U+2013>6 regular season record and won the NFC South division title.  Brees threw a league-leading 4,418 passing yards, finished third in the league with 26 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions and a 96.2 passer rating. Brees was named starting quarterback for the NFC in the [[2007 Pro Bowl]]. On January 5, 2007, Brees was named first runner-up behind former teammate Tomlinson for league MVP by the [[Associated Press]]. Brees and Tomlinson were co-recipients of the [[Walter Payton Man of the Year Award]].

On January 13, 2007, in his first playoff game for New Orleans, Brees was 20<U+2013>32 in passing attempts with 1 touchdown and no interceptions against the [[2006 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[Louisiana Superdome]]. The Saints held on to win 27<U+2013>24, and advanced to the franchise's first [[National Football League playoffs, 2006-07|NFC Championship Game]] against the [[Chicago Bears]]. Though he completed 27 of 49 passes for 354 yards against the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], and two touchdowns, Brees committed three costly turnovers, and was penalized for an intentional grounding in the endzone, resulting in a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]], as the Saints lost 39<U+2013>14.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wilner|first=Barry |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/recap;_ylt=AnvlF4Cz0U8fEkX29CykCwE5nYcB?gid=20070121003&prov=ap|title=Bears reach first Super Bowl in 21 years |work=Sports.yahoo.com|date=2007-01-22|accessdate=2008-11-28}}</ref>  Brees then dislocated his left elbow during the first quarter of the Pro Bowl.

====2007====
The [[2007 NFL season|following season]] Brees passed for 4428 yards and tied a then team record with 28 touchdowns. He also set the NFL record previously held by Rich Gannon for pass completions in a single season with 440. However, the [[2007 New Orleans Saints season|Saints]] missed the playoffs.

====2008====
In [[2008 NFL season|2008]], the Saints again missed the playoffs but Brees had a strong year statistically, finishing 15 yards short of the NFL record for passing yards thrown in a single season set by [[Dan Marino]] in [[1984 NFL Season|1984]]. He finished the season with 5,069 yards and became the second quarterback in NFL history to throw for over 5,000 yards in a season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap?game_id=29776&displayPage=tab_recap| title=Kasay helps Panthers solidify NFC's No. 2 seed with win over Saints| date=2008-12-28| publisher=Associated Press ''via'' NFL.com| accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> He passed for 300 yards ten times during the season, tying [[Rich Gannon]]'s [[2002 NFL Season|2002]] record. He was named [[FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air Player of the Week]] for his performances during weeks 8 and 12 and was named the [[Associated Press|AP]] 2008 Offensive Player of the Year.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090106/ap_on_sp_fo_ne/fbn_ap_offensive_player;_ylt=Ak1J8iC8RaOmmtrsjRt.AgoLMxIF Saints QB Brees is AP Offensive Player of the Year] Yahoo News, January 6, 2009</ref>

====2009 Super Bowl Season====
In the first game of the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]] against the [[2009 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]], Brees set a career-high and franchise-tying record with six touchdown passes, (NFL record for opening week) going 26/34 for 358 yards. The next week, Brees led the Saints to a 48<U+2013>22 win over the [[2009 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], throwing for 311 yards and three touchdown passes. Brees also tied the record for most touchdown passes by the end of week 2 with 9. In week 6 against the 5<U+2013>0 [[2009 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], Brees completed 23 of 30 passes for 369 yards, 4 touchdown passes and a passer rating of 156.8 in a dominant 48<U+2013>27 victory.

In week 7, Brees led a dramatic comeback victory on the road against the [[2009 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]], 46<U+2013>34. The [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|Saints]] quickly faced a 24<U+2013>3 deficit in the second quarter, trailing for the first time all season at that point, and failing to score on their first possession as they had in all of their previous contests. Brees had a poor outing, but provided two crucial rushing touchdowns, one just before the second half to narrow the deficit to 24<U+2013>10, and one in the third quarter to give the Saints their first lead of the game, 37<U+2013>34.

The next week, Brees threw for 308 yards on 25 of 33 passing along with two touchdowns and one interception in leading the Saints to a 35<U+2013>27 victory and franchise tying best start at 7<U+2013>0 against the rival [[2009 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. In week 9, Brees helped guide the team to a 30<U+2013>20 victory over the [[2009 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. This would be Drew's first victory over the Carolina Panthers in the Superdome and allowed the Saints to take their best ever start in franchise history at 8<U+2013>0.

In week 12, Brees led the Saints to an 11<U+2013>0 record, defeating the [[2009 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] 38<U+2013>17 on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. Drew Brees totaled 371 yards passing, posting a perfect passer rating of 158.3.

After close victories over the [[2009 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] and Falcons in successive weeks to start 13<U+2013>0, Brees and the Saints lost their first game of the season to the [[2009 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], 24<U+2013>17, after [[DeMarcus Ware]] caused a Brees fumble in the final seconds, ending a fourth quarter rally. The Saints would then lose their last two games, with Brees sitting out the week 17 finale against Carolina.  Their 13<U+2013>3 record secured the #1 seed in the NFC.

Brees' individual statistics led to numerous accolades,<ref>[http://www.theadvertiser.com/article/20100121/SPORTS/1210325/Savior-Saint]</ref> including a [[Pro Bowl]] selection, the [[Maxwell Football Club]]'s [[Bert Bell Award]], and runner-up in voting for the AP [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|Offensive Player of the Year]], and [[All-Pro]] awards. He finished the season with a completion percentage of 70.62, establishing a new NFL record.<ref>{{Cite news| first=Brett | last=Martel | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Like Williams, Brees prefers to play for record | date=December 31, 2009 | publisher= Yahoo Sports| url =http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-saints-breesrecord&prov=ap&type=lgns | work =Yahoo Sports | pages = | accessdate = 2010-01-13 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Record & Fact Book | date= | publisher= NFL.com | url =http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/indiv/passing | work =NFL.com | pages = | accessdate = 2010-01-13 | language = }}</ref>

In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Saints routed the [[2009 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] 45<U+2013>14 to advance to the NFC Championship, where they defeated the [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 31<U+2013>28 in overtime. Brees completed 17 of 31 passes for 191 yards and 3 touchdowns.

The underdog Saints defeated the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] 31<U+2013>17 in [[Super Bowl XLIV]] on February 7, 2010. Brees tied a Super Bowl record with 32 pass completions and won the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award]]. He threw for 288 yards and 2 touchdowns. It was the first league championship in Saints franchise history.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2010-02-07-super-bowl_N.htm|title=Saints stump Colts 31<U+2013>17 to win franchise's first Super Bowl title|date=2010-02-07|work=USA Today|accessdate=2010-02-08 | first=Jarrett | last=Bell}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Brees was born in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name="WebsiteBio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.drewbrees.com/about.html|title=Drew Brees Foundation: bio}}</ref>

Brees married his college sweetheart, Brittany Dudchenko, in February 2003. They both met and dated while attending [[Purdue University]]. He and his wife Brittany purchased and renovated a home in [[Uptown New Orleans]]. Brees and his wife Brittany welcomed their first child, a son named Baylen Robert Brees on January 15, 2009, which was also Brees' 30th birthday.<ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/article/2009-01-29/saints-qb-enjoys-life-new-dad "Saints QB enjoys life as new dad"], [[Associated Press|AP]] at ''[[Sporting News]]'', January 29, 2009.</ref>  Their second son, Bowen Christopher Brees, was born on October 19, 2010.<ref>[http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?S=13351872 "New Brees goes by the name of Bowen"], [[WAFB]], October 20, 2010.</ref>. With the news about the Brees adding a new member to their family, Drew also told his Twitter fans they didn't have a name for the second baby boy and asked his 283,770 followers for name suggestions that started with the letter B. After a few days and thousands of suggestions they decided to name his baby boy Bowen. His big brother Baylen was 21 months at the time of his birth.

On July 6, 2010, Brees released his first book,<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/excerpt-coming-back-stronger-drew-brees/story?id=11090457</ref> entitled ''Coming Back Stronger: Unleashing the Hidden Power of Adversity'', co-authored by Chris Fabry and published by [[Tyndale House]].<ref>Drew Brees with Chris Fabry, ''Coming Back Stronger: Unleashing the Hidden Power of Adversity'' ([[Tyndale House]] Publishers, 2010), ISBN 9781414339436.

Brees was born with a [[mole (skin marking)|mole]] on his right cheek. When Brees was 3, his parents considered having the birthmark removed, but doctors said that there was no medical reason to remove it.<ref>Lee Jenkins, [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/07/sports/07iht-chargers.html?_r=1 His Eyes Wide Shut, Brees Saves Career].

Brees' mother, Mina Brees, died on August 7, 2009 at age 59. The death was ruled a suicide.<ref>[http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2009/11/16/mina_brees_death_ruled_suicide.html]</ref> Brees was briefly excused from training camp for a "family matter."<ref>[http://nfl.fanhouse.com/2009/08/09/drew-brees-mother-dies-saints-qb-excused-from-training-camp?icid=main|aimzones|dl4|link5|http%3A%2F%2Fnfl.fanhouse.com%2F2009%2F08%2F09%2Fdrew-brees-mother-dies-saints-qb-excused-from-training-camp Death of Brees' mother]</ref> In 2006, Brees described their relationship as "nonexistent" ever since he refused to hire her as his agent when he entered the NFL.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2644387 "Brees wants no part of mom's campaign in Texas"], [[Associated Press|AP]], October 31, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/football/nfl/08/10/brees.ap/index.html "Drew Brees mother dies in Colorado"], [[Associated Press|AP]], August 10, 2009.</ref> After her death, Brees stated that this quote was three years old and that his relationship with his mother had been improving.<ref>Jason Cole, [http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=jc-saintscamp081109&prov=yhoo&type=lgns "Mom<U+2019>s death makes Brees blink, but focus remains"], [[Yahoo!

Brees became a brother of the [[Sigma Chi Fraternity]] while at Purdue.

Brees could have gone to [[Brown University]], and said that if he had, he might be in politics right now. His host on a recruiting visit was [[Sean Morey (American football)|Sean Morey]], a former Pro Bowler for [[Arizona Cardinals]].<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/peter_king/02/05/gameplan/index.html, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', February 6, 2010.</ref>

In April 2010, Brees was voted by fans as the cover athlete of [[EA Sports]] upcoming [[Madden NFL 11]] [[video game]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5125018&campaign=rss&source=NFLHeadlines "Brees on cover of 'Madden NFL 11'"], ''[[ESPN]]'', April 22, 2010.</ref>

Brees revealed in an interview with [[CBS's 60 Minutes]], which aired in September, 2010, that he was a top ranking youth tennis player who defeated [[Andy Roddick]] in competition.  In a final match versus Roddick he was soundly beaten however.

In October 2010, Brees appeared in a video where he gave a strong anti-bullying message in the wake of a series of gay teenage suicides. The text of his speech included "If you think that making fun of someone is harmless, you<U+2019>re wrong. If you think it<U+2019>s OK to do because everyone else is doing it, you<U+2019>re wrong. Bullying has to stop, and it has to start with you."<ref>http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/10/16/drew-brees-stands-up-to-bullies/</ref>
