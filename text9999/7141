'''Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta''' (born March 28, 1986), better known by her stage name '''Lady Gaga''', is an American pop [[singer-songwriter]]. She began performing in the rock music scene of New York City's [[Lower East Side]] in 2003 and enrolled at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. She soon signed with [[Interscope Records|Streamline Records]], an imprint of [[Interscope Records]]. During her early time at Interscope, she worked as a songwriter for fellow label artists and captured the attention of [[Akon]], who recognized her vocal abilities, and signed her to his own label, [[Kon Live Distribution]].

Gaga came to prominence following the release of her debut studio album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), which was a commercial success and achieved international popularity with the singles "[[Just Dance]]" and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]". The album reached number one on the record charts of six countries, accomplished positions within the top-ten worldwide, and topped the [[Dance/Electronic Albums|''Billboard'' Dance/Electronic Albums]] chart while simultaneously peaking at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States. Achieving similar worldwide success, the follow-up EP ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009) produced a further two global chart-topping singles "[[Bad Romance]]" and "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]" and allowed her to embark on a second global headlining concert tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]], just months after having finished her first, [[The Fame Ball Tour]]. Her second studio album, ''[[Born This Way]]'', is scheduled for release on May 23, 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/17386/202983|title=Lady Gaga Names Her New Album 'Born This Way'|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2010-09-13|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Gaga's treatment of her fans as "Little Monsters" has inspired criticism, due to the highly commercial nature of her music and image.<ref name="nytimesreview" /> To some, this dichotomy contravenes the concept of outsider culture. Writing for ''The Guardian'', [[Kitty Empire]] opined that the dichotomy "...allows the viewer to have a 'transgressive' experience without being required to think. At [her performance's] core, though, is the idea that Gaga is at one with the freaks and outcasts. The Monster Ball is where we can all be free. This is arrant nonsense, as the scads of people buying Gaga's cunningly commercial music are not limited to the niche worlds of [[drag queen]]s and hip night creatures from which she draws her inspiration. But Gaga seems sincere."<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/feb/21/lady-gaga-men-arena-manchester|title=Lady Gaga at MEN arena, Manchester|date=2010-02-21|accessdate=2010-06-18|last=Empire|first=Kitty|work=The Guardian|location=london}}</ref> [[Camille Paglia]] wrote a cover story "Lady Gaga and the death of sex" on September 12, 2010, in ''[[The Sunday Times]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shakenstir.co.uk/index.php/features/gaga-and-the-death-of-sex/features/20608/ |title=Lady Gaga and the death of sex|authorlink=Camille Paglia|last=Paglia|first=Camille|date=2010-09-12|accessdate=2010-10-04|work=The Sunday Times}}</ref> in which she asserts that Gaga "is more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/opinion/lady-gagas-grab-for-attention-enough-to-make-you-gag/story-e6freri6-1225923966643 |title=Lady Gaga's grab for attention enough to make you gag|first=Jane |last=Fynes-Clinton|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=2010-09-15|accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
Besides her career in music, Gaga has enhanced her repertoire as a philanthropist who has contributed to various charities and [[humanitarianism]] works.

Although declining an invitation to record [[We Are the World 25 for Haiti|a benefit song]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga Explains Her Absence From 'We Are The World' Recording|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1631353/lady-gaga-explains-her-absence-from-we-world-recording.jhtml|date=2010-02-05|accessdate=2011-01-06|work=<U+2018><U+2018>MTV<U+2019><U+2019>|publisher=MTV Networks|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena}}</ref> Gaga held a concert of The Monster Ball Tour following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] and dedicated it to the country<U+2019>s reconstruction relief fund. This concert, held at the [[Radio City Music Hall]], New York, on January 24, 2010, donated any received revenue to the relief fund while, in addition, all profits from sales of products on Gaga<U+2019>s official online store on that same day were donated. Gaga announced that an estimated total of [[United States dollar|$]]500,000 was collected for the fund.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1630614/20100127/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Says She Raised $500,000 For Haiti Relief|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=2010-01-27|work=''MTV''|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref>

Gaga also contributes in the fight against [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] with the focus upon educating young women about the risks of the disease. In collaboration with [[Cyndi Lauper]], Gaga joined forces with [[Make-up Art Cosmetics|MAC Cosmetics]] to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam. Titled Viva Glam Gaga and Viva Glam Cyndi for each contributor respectively, all net proceeds of the lipstick line were donated to the cosmetic company<U+2019>s campaign to prevent HIV and AIDS worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga gets lippy: The pop star teams with Mac to raise Aids awareness|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1264165/Lady-Gaga-gets-lippy-The-pop-star-teams-Mac-raise-Aids-awareness.html|date=2010-04-10|accessdate=2011-01-06|first=Benji|last=Wilson|work=Daily Mail|location=London}}</ref> In a press release, Gaga declared, "I don't want Viva Glam to be just a lipstick you buy to help a cause.

Gaga attributes much of her early success as a mainstream artist to her gay fans and is considered to be a rising [[gay icon]].<ref name="fabmag">{{cite news|url=http://www.fabmagazine.com/features/362/Gaga.html|title=Going Gaga|last=Thomas|first=Matt|publisher=[[Pink Triangle Press]]|work=[[fab (magazine)|fab]]|accessdate=2009-08-11|date=2009-07-09}}</ref> Early in her career she had difficulty getting [[airplay|radio airplay]], and stated, "The turning point for me was the gay community.

After ''The Fame'' was released, she revealed that the song "Poker Face" was about her [[bisexuality]]. In an interview with ''Rolling Stone'', she spoke about how her boyfriends tended to react to her bisexuality, saying "The fact that I'm into women, they're all intimidated by it. It makes them uncomfortable. They're like, 'I don't need to have a threesome. I'm happy with just you'."<ref name="rsannual" /> When she appeared as a guest on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' in May 2009, she praised DeGeneres for being "an inspiration for women and for the gay community".<ref name="ellen">{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1181210/Lady-GaGas-wacky-headgear-knocks-chat-host-Ellen-DeGeneres.html | title=Lady GaGa's wacky headgear almost knocks out chat show host Ellen DeGeneres | date=2009-05-13| work=Daily Mail | accessdate=2009-08-11 |publisher=Associated Newspapers}}</ref> She proclaimed that the October 11, 2009, [[National Equality March]] rally on the [[national mall]] was "the single most important event of her career."

[[File:DADT rally Lady Gaga.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaga addresses the crowd at [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network|SLDN]]'s "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" rally in 2010]]
Gaga attended the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]] accompanied by four service members of the [[United States Armed Forces]]: Mike Almy; David Hall; Katie Miller and Stacy Vasquez. All of whom, under the US military's "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" (DADT) policy, had been prohibited from serving [[Coming out|openly]] because of their sexuality.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lady Gaga Goes Political in Maine|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2010-09-20|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/us/politics/21gaga.html?_r=1&src=me|last=Zezima|first=Katy|accessdate=2010-09-21}}</ref> In addition, Gaga wore a dress fabricated from the flesh of a dead animal to the awards ceremony.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Gaga wished that the dress, more widely known as the "meat dress", was interpreted as a statement of human rights with focus upon those in the LGBT community adding that "If we don't stand up for what we believe in and if we don't fight for our rights, pretty soon we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones."<ref name=autogenerated1 /> She later released three [[YouTube]] videos urging her fans to contact their Senators in an effort to overturn the policy. On September 20, 2010, she spoke at the [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]]'s "4the14K" Rally in [[Deering Oaks|Deering Oaks Park]] in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]]. The name of the rally signified the number <U+2013> an estimated 14,000 <U+2013> of service members discharged under the DADT policy at the time. During her remarks, she urged members of the US Senate (and in particular, moderate Republican Senators from Maine, [[Olympia Snowe]] and [[Susan Collins]]) to vote in favor of legislation that would repeal the DADT policy. Following this event, editors of ''[[The Advocate]]'' commented that she had become "the real fierce advocate" for gays and lesbians.<ref>{{cite news |title=Obama: I<U+2019>m a <U+2018>Fierce Advocate<U+2019> for Gay and Lesbians|work=The Washington Independent|date=2008-12-08|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/22526/obama-im-a-fierce-advocate-for-gay-and-lesbians|last=McGann|first=Laura|accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/09/21/Lady_Gaga_Weve_Found_Our_Fierce_Advocate/|title=Gaga: We've Found Our Fierce Advocate|accessdate=2010-09-21|date=2010-09-28|work=The Advocate}}</ref>
