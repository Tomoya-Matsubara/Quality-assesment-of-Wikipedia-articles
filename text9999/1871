This is a '''discography of The Libertines''', a [[London]], [[England]]-based [[indie rock]] band. [[The Libertines]], who formed in 1997, consisted of [[Pete Doherty]] ([[vocalist|vocals]]/[[rhythm guitar]]), [[Carl Bar<U+00E2>t]] (vocals/[[lead guitar]]), [[John Hassall (musician)|John Hassall]] ([[bass guitar|bass]]) and [[Gary Powell]] ([[drumkit|drums]]). The band have released two [[studio album]]s, four [[extended play]]s (EPs), one [[compilation album]], six [[single (music)|single]]s and six [[music video]]s. This list does not include material performed by members of The Libertines that was recorded with [[Babyshambles]], [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]], [[Yeti (band)|Yeti]], [[The Streets]], [[Littl'ans]], [[Client (band)|Client]], [[The Chavs]] or [[Razorlight]].

The Libertines were formed by frontmen Doherty and Bar<U+00E2>t in 1998. The band released their first single "[[What a Waster]]" in June 2002 on [[Rough Trade]] records. The single broke into the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40]], and earned the band acclaim from the British music press.<ref>Beaumont, Mark ([[28 May]] [[2002]]). [http://www.nme.com/reviews/the-libertines/6411 "A new dawn has come, brothers and sisters..."]. ''[[NME]]''. Retrieved on [[10 May]] [[2008]].</ref> The Libertines followed up with their debut full-length album ''[[Up the Bracket]]'' in October 2002. Although ''Up the Bracket'' only peaked at number thirty-five in the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]], the album was critically-acclaimed,<ref>Fox, Jason ([[3 October]] [[2002]]).

Retrieved on [[10 May]] [[2008]].</ref> and rated as one of the the year's best by many publications .<ref>[http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A1645.htm " The Libertines: ''Up the Bracket''"]. AcclaimedMusic.net. Retrieved on [[10 May]] [[2008]].</ref> Two singles were released to support the album; "[[Up the Bracket (song)|Up the Bracket]]", which reached number twenty-nine in the UK, and "[[Time for Heroes]]", which peaked at the twentieth spot. In August 2003, The Libertines released their fourth single, "[[Don't Look Back into the Sun]]". It was their highest-charting effort so far, reaching number eleven. The band's self-titled second album ''[[The Libertines (album)|The Libertines]]'' was released a year later in August 2004. The album debuted at the top of the British charts, helped by lead single "[[Can't Stand Me Now]]", which hit number two. ''The Libertines'', which was certified [[British Phonographic Industry|platinum]] in the UK, saw the band chart in the [[United States]] for the first time, peaking at number 111 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''. However the album was to be the band's last, as they soon disbanded after due to Doherty's substance abuse problems, run-ins with the law and disagreements with Bar<U+00E2>t.<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/the-libertines/18492 "No More Time for Heroes?"].
