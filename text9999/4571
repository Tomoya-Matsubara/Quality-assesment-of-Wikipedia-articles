'''U2''' are <!-- ("They are") Please note that British English uses the plural "are" instead of the Americanised singular "is" -->a [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The band consists of [[Bono]] ([[singing|vocals]] and [[guitar]]), [[The Edge]] (guitar, [[keyboards]], and vocals), [[Adam Clayton]] ([[bass guitar]]), and [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] ([[Drum kit|drums]] and [[percussion instrument|percussion]]).

The band formed in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. By the mid-1980s, the band had become a top international act. Their success as a live act was greater than their success as a record selling act until their 1987 album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'',<ref>{{cite video | people =[[Paul McGuinness]] | title =Classic Albums: The Joshua Tree | medium =Television documentary | publisher =Rajon Vision |year=1998 }}</ref> which according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', elevated the band's stature "from heroes to superstars".<ref name="RS_xx">{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Elysa | title = U2: The Rolling Stone Files | work = Rolling Stone | year = 1994 | location = New York | pages = xx | isbn = ISBN 0-283-06239-8}}</ref> U2 responded to the [[Electronic dance music|dance]] and [[alternative rock]] revolutions and their own sense of musical stagnation by reinventing themselves with their 1991 album ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' and the accompanying [[Zoo TV Tour]]. Since 2000, U2 have pursued a more conventional rock sound that retains the influence of their previous musical explorations.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1976<U+2013>1979)===
[[Image:U2-teenagers.jpg|thumb|right|U2 in their early years: (left to right) Clayton, Mullen, Bono, Edge]]
The band formed in Dublin on 25 September 1976.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 27</ref> <!--as an Irish topic, under Wikipedia rules this article uses international dating, i.e., dd/mm/yyyy not American dating mm/dd/yyyy.--> [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]], then 14, posted a notice on his secondary school notice board ([[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]]) seeking musicians for a new band. Seven teenage boys attended the initial practice in Mullen's kitchen. It was, as Mullen put it, "'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge." The group featured Mullen on drums, [[Bono|Paul Hewson (Bono)]] on lead vocals, [[The Edge|Dave Evans (The Edge)]] and his brother [[Dik Evans]] on guitar, [[Adam Clayton]], a friend of the Evans brothers on bass guitar, and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen.<ref>Chatterton (2001), page 130</ref> Soon after, the group settled on the name "Feedback", because it was one of the few technical terms they knew.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 30</ref> Martin did not return after the first practice, and McCormick left the group within a few weeks. Most of the group's material initially consisted of cover versions, which the band said was not their forte.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} The original material the band did write demonstrated a sound influenced by their [[post-punk]] peers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/u2/biography | title = U2: Biography: Rolling Stone | work = Rolling Stone | accessdate = 14 August 2008}}</ref>

</blockquote>

In March 1977, the band changed their name to "The Hype".<ref>de la Parra (2003), page 6</ref> Dik Evans, who was older and by this time at college, was becoming the odd man out. The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble and he was "phased out" in March 1978. During a farewell concert in the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Church Hall in [[Howth]], which featured The Hype playing covers, Dik ceremoniously walked offstage. The remaining four band members completed the concert playing original material as "U2".<ref name="U2_by_U2_46-48">McCormick (2006), pages 46<U+2013>48</ref> Steve Averill, a punk rock musician and family friend of Clayton's, had suggested six potential names from which the band chose "U2" for its ambiguity and open-ended interpretations, and because it was the name that they disliked the least.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 44</ref>

On [[Saint Patrick's Day]] in 1978, U2 won a talent show in [[Limerick|Limerick, Ireland]]. The prize consisted of <U+00A3>500 and studio time to record a demo which would be heard by CBS Ireland. This win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling band.<ref name="U2_by_U2_46-48"/> The band recorded their first demo tape at Keystone Studios, in Harcourt Street, Dublin, in April 1978.<ref name="Bono">Wall, Mick, (2005).

===''Boy'', ''October'', and ''War'' (1980<U+2013>1983)===

The band's second album, ''[[October (album)|October]],'' was released in 1981 and contained overtly spiritual themes. During the album's recording sessions, Bono and The Edge left the band due to spiritual conflicts, and U2 ceased to exist for a brief period of time.<ref>{{cite album-notes |title=October |albumlink=October (album) |bandname=U2 |year=2008 |last=McCormick |first=Neil |format=Remastered deluxe edition CD booklet |publisher=[[Island Records]] |publisherid=B0010948-02}}</ref> Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group in Dublin called the 'Shalom Fellowship', which led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the rock and roll lifestyle.<ref>Flanagan (1995), pages 46<U+2013>48</ref> Recording was further complicated when a briefcase containing lyrics for several working songs was stolen from backstage during the band's performance at a nightclub in [[Portland, Oregon]]; it was recovered and returned to the band in 2004, nearly a quarter century later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3945519.stm |title=U2 lyrics returned after 23 years |publisher=BBC News |date=22 October 2004 |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play.

[[Image:U2 21081983 01 800b.jpg|thumb|right|Bono performs in Norway during the [[War Tour]] in 1983.]]
Resolving the doubts of the ''October'' period, U2 released ''[[War (album)|War]]'' in 1983.<ref>Stokes (1996), page 36</ref> A record where the band "turned pacifism itself into a crusade",<ref>Reynolds, Simon.

''War'' was U2's first album to feature the photography of [[Anton Corbijn]], who remains U2's principal photographer and has had a major influence on their vision and public image.<ref>McCormick (2006), page 127</ref> U2's first commercial success, ''War'' debuted at number one in the UK, and its first single, "[[New Year's Day (song)|New Year's Day]]", was the band's first hit outside Ireland or the UK.<ref>"New Year's Day" reached number ten on the UK charts, and received extensive radio coverage in the US, almost breaking that country's Top 50.

On the subsequent [[War Tour]], the band performed to sold-out concerts in mainland Europe and the U.S. The image of Bono waving a white flag during performances of "Sunday Bloody Sunday" became a familiar sight.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.motherjones.com/arts/books/1989/05/bono.html | title = Bono Bites Back | publisher = MotherJones.com | first = Adam | last = Block | date = 1 May 1989 | accessdate = 6 September 2007}}</ref> U2 recorded the ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' live album on this tour, as well as the ''[[Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky|Live at Red Rocks]]'' concert film, both of which received extensive play on the radio and [[MTV]], expanding the band's audience and cementing the band's prowess as a live band.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://netmusiccountdown.com/inc/artist.php?artist=U2 | title = Net Music Countdown: U2 | publisher = netmusiccountdown.com | accessdate = 6 September 2007}}</ref> Their generally unfavourable record deal with Island Records was coming to an end, and in 1984 U2 signed a highly lucrative extension.

Stung by criticism of ''Rattle and Hum'', the band made a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for their seventh studio album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]''; the change was their most dramatic since ''The Unforgettable Fire''.<ref>Flanagan (1995), pages 4<U+2013>6; Graham (2004), page 43</ref> The band began work on ''Achtung Baby'' in East Berlin in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, seeking inspiration and renewal on the eve of [[German reunification]].<ref>Flanagan (1995), page 7</ref> The sessions instead proved to be difficult. In Berlin, conflict arose within the band over the quality of material and musical direction. While Adam and Larry preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work, Bono and The Edge were inspired by [[alternative rock]] and European [[electronic dance music|dance music]] and advocated a change. Weeks of slow progress, arguments, and tension subsided when the band rallied around a chord progression The Edge had written, creating the song "[[One (U2 song)|One]]".<ref>Flanagan (1995), pages 6<U+2013>11</ref> The band completed the album in Dublin.

In November 1991, U2 released ''Achtung Baby''. Sonically, the album incorporated dance, [[industrial music|industrial]], and alternative rock influences of the time and the band referred to the album as the sound of "four men chopping down the Joshua Tree".<ref>{{cite web | last = Paulsen | first = John | title = Deep Cuts: U2: Part I

The [[Zoo TV Tour]] of 1992<U+2013>1993 was a [[multimedia]] event, and showcased an extravagant but intentionally bewildering array of hundreds of video screens, upside-down flying [[Trabant]] cars, mock transmission towers, [[satellite television|satellite TV]] links, [[subliminal message]]s, and Bono's over-the-top stage characters such as "[[The Fly (U2 song)|The Fly]]", "Mirror-Ball Man", and "(Mister) MacPhisto". The extravagant shows were intentionally in contrast to the austere staging of previous U2 tours, and mocked the excesses of rock and roll by appearing to embrace these very excesses. The shows were, in part, U2's way to represent the pervasive nature of cable television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping.<ref>de la Parra (1994), pages 139<U+2013>41; Flanagan (1995), pages 12,13, 58<U+2013>61; Stokes (1996), pages 110<U+2013>11</ref> Prank phone calls were made to [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]], the [[United Nations]], and others. Live satellite uplinks to war-torn [[Sarajevo]] caused controversy.<ref>de la Parra (2003), pages 153, 166</ref>

Quickly recorded and released during a break in the Zoo TV tour in mid-1993, the ''[[Zooropa]]'' album continued many of the themes from ''Achtung Baby'' and the Zoo TV tour. Initially intended as an [[Extended play|EP]], the band expanded ''Zooropa'' into a full-length [[LP album]]. It was an even greater departure from the style of their earlier recordings, incorporating [[techno]] influences and other electronic effects.<ref>Graham (2004), page 51</ref> [[Johnny Cash]] sang the vocal on the "[[The Wanderer (U2 song)|The Wanderer]]". Most of the songs were played at least once during the 1993 leg of the tour, which extended through Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan; half the album's tracks became fixtures in the set.<ref>de la Parra (2003), pages 166<U+2013>72</ref>

===''Passengers'', ''Pop'', and PopMart (1994<U+2013>1999)===
In 1995, U2 released an experimental album called ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]''. Brian Eno, producer of three previous U2 albums, contributed as a full partner, including writing and performing. For this reason, and due to the record's highly experimental nature, the band chose to release it under the moniker "Passengers" to distinguish it from U2's conventional albums. It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received generally poor reviews. However, the single "[[Miss Sarajevo]]" featuring [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and which Bono cites as one of his favourite U2 songs,<ref>McCormick (2006), page 261<U+2013>62</ref> was a hit.

The band subsequently chose to begin writing and recording for the album with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno in June 2007.

Despite these broad consistencies, U2 have introduced new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album. U2's early sound was influenced by bands such as [[Television (band)|Television]] and [[Joy Division]], and has been described as containing a "sense of exhilaration" that resulted from The Edge's "radiant chords" and Bono's "ardent vocals".<ref>Reynolds (2005), page 368</ref> U2's sound began with post-punk roots and minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on ''Boy'' and ''October'', but evolved through ''War'' to include aspects of rock anthem, funk, and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive.<ref>Considine J.D.

''The Unforgettable Fire'', which began with the Edge playing more keyboards than guitars, as well as follow-up ''The Joshua Tree'', had [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] at the production helm. With their influence, both albums achieved a "diverse texture".<ref name="RS_JT"/> The songs from ''The Joshua Tree'' and ''Rattle and Hum'' placed more emphasis on Lanois-inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music, which stemmed from the band's burgeoning fascination with America's culture, people and places. In the 1990s, U2 reinvented themselves as they began using [[synthesizer]]s, [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]], and [[electronica|electronic]] beats derived from alternative music, dance music, and [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] on ''Achtung Baby'',<ref>Gardner, Alysa (22 January 1997).

Social and political commentary, often embellished with [[Christianity|Christian]] religious and spiritual imagery,<ref name="lyrics">Pareles, Jon (14 November 2004).

Retrieved 18 February 2007.</ref> are a major aspect of U2's lyrical content. Songs such as "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]" and "Mothers of the Disappeared" were motivated by current events of the time. The former was written about [[The Troubles|the troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]],<ref>McCormick (2006), pages 135, 139</ref> while the latter concerns the struggle of [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo|mothers]] whose children were kidnapped and killed under [[Argentina]]'s military dictatorship that began in 1976.

Bono's personal conflicts and turmoil related to family colour songs like "[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]", "[[Tomorrow (U2 song)|Tomorrow]]" and "[[Kite (song)|Kite]]". An emotional yearning or pleading is another frequent conveyance,<ref name="ABOUT_TOP10"/> in tracks such as "[[Yahweh (song)|Yahweh]]",<ref>[http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/u2/reviews/400 U2 - How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb Review.] uncut.co.uk. Retrieved 18 February 2007.</ref> "[[Peace on Earth (U2 song)|Peace on Earth]]", and "[[Please (U2 song)|Please]]". The investigation of loss and anguish coupled with hopefulness and resiliency, which is central to ''The Joshua Tree'',<ref name="RS_JT"/> has motivated much of U2's songwriting and music. Some of this lyrical ideation has been amplified by Bono and the band's personal experiences during their youth in Ireland, as well as Bono's campaigning and activism later in his life. U2 have used tours such as [[Zoo TV Tour|Zoo TV]] and [[PopMart Tour|PopMart]] to caricature social trends, such as media overload and consumerism, respectively.<ref name="NYT_POP"/>

While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their music, U2's lyrics and music have been criticized as apolitical because of their vagueness and "fuzzy imagery", and a lack of any specific references to actual people or characters.<ref>{{cite web|title=The soaring nothingness of U2|author=Plotz, David|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2061087/|date=25 January 2002|work=Slate|accessdate=19 January 2008}}</ref>

Since the early 1980s, the members of U2<U+2014>as a band and individually<U+2014>have collaborated with other musicians, artists, celebrities, and politicians to address issues concerning poverty, disease, and social injustice.

In 1984, Bono and Adam Clayton participated in [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] to raise money for [[Ethiopia]]n [[famine relief]]. The initiative produced the hit charity single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", which would be the first among several collaborations between U2 and [[Bob Geldof]]. In July 1985, U2 played [[Live Aid]], a follow-up to Band Aid's efforts. Bono and his wife Ali, invited by [[World Vision]], later visited Ethiopia where they witnessed the famine first hand. Bono would later say this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting.<ref>Tyrangiel, Josh (4 March 2002).

In 1986, U2 participated in the [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour in support of [[Amnesty International]] and in [[Self Aid]] for unemployment in Ireland. The same year, Bono and Ali Hewson also visited [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] at the invitation of the [[Sanctuary movement]], and saw the effects of the [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador Civil War]]. These 1986 events greatly influenced ''The Joshua Tree'' album, which was being recorded at the time.

Since 2000, Bono's campaigning has included [[Jubilee 2000]] with Bob Geldof, [[Muhammad Ali]], and others to promote the cancellation of third world debt during the [[Great Jubilee]]. In January 2002, Bono co-founded the multinational [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], [[DATA]], with the aim of improving the social, political, and financial state of Africa. He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa.<ref>Kagan Daryn.
