'''Jarrod Scott Saltalamacchia''' (born May 2, 1985, in {{city-state|West Palm Beach|Florida}}), is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[catcher]] for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. 

He is often referred to by his nickname, '''"Salty"''', due in part to the length of his [[surname]], which at 14 letters, is the longest in Major League history;<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/braves/2007-05-09-salt_N.htm]</ref> his complete name, at 20 letters, is tied for the longest with former [[San Francisco Giants]] pitcher [[William Van Landingham]].

==Baseball career==
Saltalamacchia was drafted out of [[Royal Palm Beach]] High School in the first round of the [[2003 Major League Baseball Draft]] by the [[Atlanta Braves]].

===Atlanta Braves===
In 2006, Saltalamacchia had a breakout season at Class A Myrtle Beach, where the switch-hitting slugger hit .314 with 35 doubles, 19 homers and 81 RBIs in 129 games.

In the {{By|2007}} season, Saltalamacchia started at catcher for the [[Minor league baseball|Double-A]] [[Mississippi Braves]]. Only 22 games into the season, he belted 7 [[home run]]s with a [[batting average]] of .373.

On his 22nd birthday, he was called up to Atlanta to replace [[Brayan Pe<U+00F1>a]] on the roster and to fill in for [[Brian McCann (baseball player)|Brian McCann]], who re-injured his finger on May 1, {{mlby|2007}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070502&content_id=1942469&vkey=news_atl&fext=.jsp&c_id=atl|title=Saltalamacchia solid in debut|accessdate=2007-05-03 |last= Rogers |first=Bowman|date=May 3, 2007|format= |work=Braves.com |publisher= |quote= }}</ref>  Saltalamacchia's call-up made him the new record-holder of the longest last name in Major League Baseball history, at 14 letters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/braves/2007-05-03-saltalamacchia-long-name_N.htm?csp=34|title=Man of letters: Saltalamacchia sets mark|last=Glier|first=Ray|date=May 3, 2007|work=USA Today}}</ref>

On May 6, 2007, Saltalamacchia had the first [[Hit (baseball)|hit]] of his major league career in the sixth inning against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. In the seventh inning, with two outs and two men on base, Saltalamacchia got his first [[Run batted in|RBI]], which also drove in the winning run for the Braves. On May 27, 2007, Saltalamacchia hit his first major league home run, a solo shot off [[Cole Hamels]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. On June 26 in a start at first base, Saltalamacchia had his first multi-home run game. Both blasts came batting [[right-handed]] off [[left-handed]] [[Washington Nationals]] [[pitcher]] [[Mike Bacsik (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Bacsik]].

On Mother's Day, May 14, 2007, Saltalamacchia was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a [[pink bat]] to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation.

Because Saltalamacchia was "blocked" (McCann, who was recently signed to a large contract with Atlanta, is a more accomplished player already catching with the Braves), he was the subject of much trade speculation within baseball, as a powerful switch-hitting catcher commands interest from nearly any baseball club within the major leagues. After much speculation, he was traded to the Texas Rangers on July 31, 2007, with four prospects for first baseman [[Mark Teixeira]] and reliever [[Ron Mahay]].

Though actual playing time was limited, Saltalamacchia batted .284 with 4 home runs and 12 RBI in 47 games with Atlanta in 2007.

===Texas Rangers===
Upon joining the Rangers after being traded and changing his number to 18 from 16, [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Ron Washington]] stated that Saltalamacchia would serve as a first baseman and catcher. In his first game with the Rangers on August 1, 2007, Saltalamacchia started at first base and drove in two runs. 

On August 22, 2007, Saltalamacchia had two home runs and seven RBIs in the historic 30-3 rout of the [[Baltimore Orioles]].<ref>{{cite web | title = "Rangers break record." | date = 2007-08-22 | publisher = MLB.com | url = http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/wrap.jsp?ymd=20070822&content_id=2163718&vkey=wrapup2005&fext=.jsp&team=away&c_id=tex}}</ref>

In 46 games with the Rangers in 2007, Saltamacchia batted .251, collecting 7 home runs and 21 RBIs.

On March 26, {{mlby|2008}}, Saltalamacchia lost the starting catching job to [[Gerald Laird]], and the Rangers chose to send him down to the minors to catch every day instead of sitting as the backup.<ref>{{cite web |title="Laird named Rangers' starting catcher, Saltalamacchia sent down"|date=2008-03-26|publisher=ESPN.com| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/spring2008/news/story?id=3313476}}</ref> However, Saltalamacchia was soon called up on April 25, 2008.<ref>[http://startelegramsports.typepad.com/foul_territory/2008/04/saltalamacchia.html Foul Territory: JD confirms Saltalamacchia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Saltalamacchia suffered a shoulder injury on August 15, 2009 and was placed on the disabled list.
