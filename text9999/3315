'''Gunnhild konungam<U+00F3><U+00F0>ir''' (''mother of kings'') or '''Gunnhild Gormsd<U+00F3>ttir'''<ref>Or, alternatively, '''Gunnhild <U+00D6>zurard<U+00F3>ttir'''.</ref> (c. 910 &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; c. 980) is a character that appears in the [[Icelandic Sagas]], according to which she was the wife of [[Eric Bloodaxe]] ([[king of Norway]] 930<U+2013>34, [[jarl of Orkney|'King' of Orkney]] c. 937<U+2013>54, and king of [[J<U+00F3>rv<U+00ED>k]] 948<U+2013>49 and 952<U+2013>54). Many of the details of her life are disputed, including her parentage. Although she is treated in the sagas as a historical person, even her historicity is a matter of some debate.<ref>''E.g.,'' Downham 112-120; Jones 121<U+2013>24; Bradbury 38; Orfield 129; Ashley 444; Alen 88; Driscoll 88, note 15.</ref> Gunnhild appears prominently in many [[Norse sagas]], including ''[[Fagrskinna]]'', ''[[Egil's Saga]]'', ''[[Njal's Saga]]'', and ''[[Heimskringla]]''. What details of her life are known come largely from [[Iceland]]ic sources, which generally asserted that the Icelandic settlers had fled from Harald's tyranny. While the historicity of such sources as the ''[[Landnamabok]]'' is disputed, the perception that Harald had exiled or driven out many of their ancestors led to an attitude among Icelanders generally hostile to Erik and Gunnhild. Scholars such as [[Gwyn Jones (author)|Gwyn Jones]] therefore regard some of the episodes reported in them as suspect.<ref>Jones 121<U+2013>24.</ref>

The sagas relate that Gunnhild lived during a time of great change and upheaval in Norway. Her father-in-law [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]] had recently united much of Norway under his rule. Shortly after his death, Gunnhild and her husband were overthrown and exiled. She spent much of the rest of her life in exile in [[Orkney]], [[Jorvik]] and [[Denmark]]. A number of her many children with Erik became co-rulers of Norway in the late tenth century.

==Origins==
According to the 12th century [[Historia Norvegiae]], Gunnhild was the daughter of [[Gorm the Old]], king of [[Denmark]], and Erik and Gunnhild met at a feast given by Gorm. Modern scholars have largely accepted this version as accurate.<ref>For example, Bradbury 38; Orfield 129; Ashley 444; Alen 88; Driscoll 88, note 15.</ref> In their view, her marriage with Erik was a dynastic union between two houses, that of the Norwegian [[Ynglings]] and that of the early [[List of kings of Denmark|Danish monarchy]] (who may have claimed descent from [[Ragnar Lodbrok]]), in the process of unifying and consolidating their respective countries. Erik himself was the product of such a union between Harald and Ragnhild, a Danish princess from [[Jutland]].<ref>Jones 94<U+2013>95. The purported descent of Gorm from King Ragnar through his son [[Sigurd Snake-eye]] comes from, ''inter alia'', ''[[Ragnarssona <U+00FE><U+00E1>ttr]]'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 3&ndash;4; but many modern [[scholars]] regard the tales of Ragnar and his family as confused and unreliable. See, for example, Jones 204&ndash;211; Forte 69.</ref>

Gwyn Jones in particular supported the identification of Gunnhild as the daughter of Gorm, and regarded the stories of her origins in [[Halogaland]] in northern [[Norway]] and her tutelage by Finnish wizards as part of a general Icelandic hostility towards Gunnhild and Erik.<ref name=Jones_121-22>Jones 121<U+2013>22.</ref>
[[Image:Shaman.jpg|thumb|upright|Copper carving (1767) by O.H. von Lode showing a Saami [[shaman]] with his [[rune drum]] (meavrresg<U+00E1>rri)]]
''Heimskringla'' and ''Egil's Saga'', on the other hand, assert that Gunnhild was the daughter of [[Ozur Toti]], a [[hersir]] from Halogaland.<ref>For example, ''Harald Fairhair's Saga'' <U+00A7> 34. The ''<U+00C1>grip af N<U+00F3>regskonungas<U+00F6>gum'' calls her father Ozurr lafskegg [dangling beard], thus also ''Fagrskinna''; Driscoll <U+00A7> 5 & p. 88, note 15.</ref> Accounts of her early life vary between sources. ''Egil's Saga'' relates that "Eirik fought a great battle on the [[Northern Dvina]] in [[Bjarmaland]], and was victorious as the poems about him record. On the same expedition he obtained Gunnhild, the daughter of Ozur Toti, and brought her home with him."<ref>''Egil's Saga'' <U+00A7> 37.</ref>

Gwyn Jones regarded many of the traditions that grew up around Gunnhild in the Icelandic sources as fictional.<ref name=Jones_121-22 /> However, both [[Theodoricus monachus]] and the ''[[<U+00C1>grip af N<U+00F3>regskonungas<U+00F6>gum]]'' report that when Gunnhild was at the court of [[Harald Bluetooth]] after Erik's death, the Danish king offered marriage to her; if valid, these accounts call into question the identification of Gunnhild as Harald's sister, but their most recent editors follow Jones in viewing their accounts of Gunnhild's origins as unreliable.<ref>Theodoricus, <U+00A7> 6 & p. 64, note 54; Driscoll, <U+00A7> 11 & p. 91, note 39.</ref>

''Heimskringla'' relates that Gunnhild lived for a time in a hut with two [[Saami|Finnish]] wizards and learned [[seithr|magic]] from them. The two wizards demanded sexual favors from her, so she induced Erik, who was returning from an expedition to [[Bjarmland]], to kill them. Erik then took her to her father's house and announced his intent to marry Gunnhild.<ref>''Harald Fairhair's Saga'' <U+00A7> 34.</ref> The older ''Fagrskinna'', however, says simply that Erik met Gunnhild during an expedition to the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] north, where she was being "fostered and educated ... with M<U+01EB>ttull, king of the [[Saami|Finns]]".<ref>''Fagrskinna'' <U+00A7> 8.</ref> Gunnhild's Finnish sojourn is described by historian Marlene Ciklamini as a "fable" designed to set the stage for placing the blame for Erik's future misrule on his wife.<ref>Ciklamini 210-211.</ref>

===Erik's kinslaying and exile===
Gunnhild and Erik are said to have had the following children: [[Gamle Eriksson|Gamle]], the oldest; then [[Guthorm Eriksson|Guthorm]], [[Harald Greycloak|Harald]], [[Ragnfrod Eriksson|Ragnfrod]], [[Ragnhild Eriksdotter|Ragnhild]], [[Erling Eriksson|Erling]], [[Gudrod Eriksson|Gudrod]], and [[Sigurd Sleva]].<ref>''Harald Fairhair's Saga'' <U+00A7> 46.</ref> ''Egil's Saga'' mentions a son named R<U+00F6>gnvald, but it is not known whether he can be identified with one of those mentioned in ''Heimskringla'', or even whether he was Gunnhild's son or Erik's by another woman.

Gunnhild was widely reputed to be a ''[[v<U+00F6>lva]]'', or [[witch]].<ref>''E.g., Harald Fairhair's Saga'' <U+00A7> 34; ''Njal's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 5<U+2013>8; Fox 289<U+2013>310.</ref> Prior to the death of [[Harald Fairhair]], Erik's popular half-brother [[Halfdan Haraldsson the Black]] died mysteriously, and Gunnhild was suspected of having "bribed a witch to give him a [[poison|death-drink]]."<ref>"Harald Fairhair's Saga" <U+00A7> 44.</ref> Shortly thereafter, Harald died and Erik consolidated his power over the whole country. He began to quarrel with his other brothers, egged on by Gunnhild, and had four of them killed, beginning with [[Bj<U+00F8>rn Farmann]] and later [[Olaf Haraldsson Geirstadalf|Olaf]] and [[Sigr<U+00F8>d Haraldsson|Sigr<U+00F8>d]] in battle at [[T<U+00F8>nsberg]].<ref>''Harald Fairhair's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 45<U+2013>46.</ref>
As a result of Erik's tyrannical rule (which was likely greatly exaggerated in the sagas) he was expelled from Norway when the nobles of the country declared for his half-brother, [[Haakon the Good]].<ref>Jones 94<U+2013>95.</ref>

===Orkney and Jorvik===
According to the Icelandic sagas, Erik set sail with his family and his retainers to [[Orkney]], where they settled for a number of years. During that time Erik was acknowledged as "King of Orkney" by its ''de facto'' rulers, the [[Earl|jarl]]s [[Arnkel Turf-Einarsson|Arnkel]] and [[Erlend Turf-Einarsson]].<ref>''E.g.'', Ashley 443<U+2013>44.</ref> Gunnhild went with Erik to [[Jorvik]] when, at the invitation of [[Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York|Bishop Wulfstan]], the erstwhile Norwegian king settled as client king over northern [[England]].<ref>According to the "Saga of Haakon the Good", it was King [[Athelstan of England]] who appointed Erik as ruler of Jorvik, but this is chronologically problematic; Athelstan died in 939. Ashley, among others, proposes that Erik received his commission from Athelstan but did not take it up until later. Ashley 443<U+2013>44.</ref> At Jorvik, both Erik and Gunnhild may have been baptized.<ref>Saussaye 183.</ref>
[[Image:Haakon den godes saga - Gunnhild d<U+00F8>pes - C. Krohg.jpg|thumb|Baptism of Gunnhild. Illustration by Krohg.]]

Following Erik's loss of Jorvik and subsequent death at the [[Battle of Stainmore]] (954), the survivors of the battle brought word of the defeat to Gunnhild and her sons in [[Northumberland]].<ref>''Haakon the Good's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 4<U+2013>5.</ref> Taking with them all that they could, they set sail for Orkney, where they exacted tribute from the new jarl, [[Thorfinn Skullsplitter]].<ref>''Haakon the Good's Saga'' <U+00A7> 5.</ref>

Ultimately, however, Gunnhild decided to move on; marrying her daughter Ragnhild to Jarl Thorfinn's son [[Arnfinn Thorfinnsson|Arnfinn]], she took her other children and set sail for Denmark.<ref>Ashley 443; see also ''Haakon the Good's Saga'' <U+00A7> 5; ''Fagrskinna'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 8<U+2013>9. Ragnhild would later, according to the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'', murder Arnfinn, marry his brother Havard, murder him in turn, and then marry their brother Ljot. Ashley 443<U+2013>44.</ref>

It is worth noting that some modern historians call into question the identification of the Erik who ruled over Jorvik with Erik Bloodaxe. None of the English sources for Erik's reign in [[Northumbria]] identify him as Norwegian or as the son of Harald Fairhair. A thirteenth-century letter from [[Edward I]] to [[Pope Boniface VIII]] identifies Erik as [[Scottish people|Scottish]] in origin.<ref name="Downham 116">Downham 116.</ref> Lappenberg, Plummer and Todd, writing in the late nineteenth century, identified Erik as a son of [[Harald Bluetooth]], a claim Downham discounts as untenable.<ref name="Downham 116"/> Downham, however, regards Erik the king of Jorvik as a distinct individual from Erik Bloodaxe, and thus views Gunnhild's sojourn in Orkney and Jorvik as the construct of later saga-writers who conflated different characters between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries.<ref>Downham 118.</ref>

===Conflict with Egil Skallagrimsson===
Gunnhild was the nemesis of [[Egil Skallagrimsson]], and his saga and poetry present her in a particularly negative light. Egil was introduced to Erik by his older brother [[Thorolf Skallagrimsson|Thorolf]], who was a friend of the prince, and the brothers were originally on good terms with Erik and Gunnhild.<ref>''Egil's Saga'' <U+00A7> 36.</ref> However, during a sojourn in Norway around 930, Egil got into an inheritance dispute with certain members of Erik's court, during which he killed B<U+00E1>r<U+00F0>r of Atley, one of the king's  retainers.<ref>''Egil's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 56<U+2013>58.</ref>

Gunnhild ordered her two brothers to kill Egil and Thorolf. Egil killed the pair when they confronted him, greatly increasing the Queen's thirst for revenge.<ref name="Egil">''Egil's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 59<U+2013>60.</ref>
[[Image:Egil Skallagrimsson 17c manuscript.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Picture of Egil in a 17th century manuscript of [[Egils Saga]].]]

Erik then declared Egil an outlaw in Norway. Berg-<U+00D6>nundr gathered a company of men to capture Egil, but was killed in his attempt to do so.<ref name="Egil"/> During his escape from Norway, Egil killed [[R<U+00F6>gnvald Eriksson]], Erik's son.<ref>''Egil's Saga'' <U+00A7> 60.</ref>  He then cursed Erik and Gunnhild by setting a horse's head on a pole in a shamanic ritual (the pillar was a ''n<U+00ED><U+00F0>st<U+00F6>ng'' or "[[Ni<U+00F0>ing Pole|n<U+00ED><U+00F0>-pole]]"; n<U+00ED><U+00F0> translates, roughly, to 'scorn' or 'curse'.) and saying:
<blockquote>"Here I set up a [[Ni<U+00F0>ing Pole|''n<U+00ED><U+00F0>''-pole]], and declare this ''n<U+00ED><U+00F0>'' against King Erik and Queen Gunnhildr", &mdash; he turned the horse-head to face the mainland &mdash; "I declare this ''n<U+00ED><U+00F0>'' at the land-spirits there, and the land itself, so that all will fare astray, not to hold nor find their places, not until they wreak King Erik and Gunnhild from the land." He set up the pole of n<U+00ED><U+00F0> in the cliff-face and left it standing; he faced the horse's eyes on the land, and he rist runes upon the pole, and said all the formal words of the curse.<ref>''Egil's Saga'' <U+00A7> 60. the Icelandic source is, essentially, giving Egil credit for the ouster of Gunnhild and Erik from Norway.</ref></blockquote>

The last encounter between Egil and Gunnhild occurred around 948 in Jorvik. Egil was shipwrecked on a nearby shore and came before Erik, who sentenced him to death. But Egil composed a ''[[dr<U+00E1>pa]]'' called "[[H<U+00F6>fu<U+00F0>lausn]]" in Erik's praise over a single night.<ref>He did so despite being pestered by the noise of a bird, which he believed was Gunnhild disguised with magic. ''Egil's Saga'' <U+00A7> 62</ref> When he recited it in the morning, Erik gave him his freedom and forgave the killing of R<U+00F6>gnvald, against Gunnhild's wishes.<ref>''Egil's Saga'' <U+00A7> 64.</ref>

==Life after Erik==
===In Denmark===
[[Image:Haakon den godes saga - Gunnhild faar bud om Eiriks doed- C. Krohg.jpg|thumb|upright|Gunnhild learns that Erik is dead. Illustration by Krohg.]]

After the death of her husband, Gunnhild took refuge with her sons at the court of [[Harald Bluetooth]] at [[Roskilde]].<ref>''Haakon the Good's Saga'' <U+00A7> 10. As noted above, Harald may have been Gunnhild's brother or half-brother.</ref> Tradition ascribes to Gunnhild the commissioning of the [[skald]]ic poem [[Eir<U+00ED>ksm<U+00E1>l]] in honor of her fallen husband.<ref>Jones 123; ''Fagrskinna'' <U+00A7> 8; ''Haakon the Good's Saga'' <U+00A7> 10.</ref>

In Denmark, Gunnhild's son Harald was fostered by the king himself, and her other sons were given properties and titles.<ref>''Fagrskinna'' <U+00A7> 9; ''Haakon the Good's Saga'' <U+00A7> 10.</ref> As King Harald was involved in a war against Haakon's Norway, he may have sought to use Gunnhild's sons as his proxies against the Norwegian king.<ref>''Haakon the Good's Saga'' <U+00A7> 10.</ref> One of her sons, Gamle, died fighting King Haakon around 960.<ref>''Haakon the Good's Saga'' <U+00A7> 26.</ref>

===Return to Norway===
Gunnhild returned to Norway in triumph when her remaining sons killed King Haakon at the [[Battle of Fitjar]] in 961. Ironically, the battle was a victory for Haakon's forces but his death left a power vacuum which Gunnhild's son Harald, with Danish aid, was able to exploit.<ref>Jones 122. A story recorded in the ''Saga of Haakon the Good'', regarded by Ciklamini as a fable, relates that Gunnhild brought about King Haakon's death through the use of a magic arrow shot by one of her servants. Ciklamini 211.</ref> With her sons now ensconced as the lords of Norway, Gunnhild was from this time known as ''konungam<U+00F3><U+00F0>ir'', or "Mother of Kings."<ref>Jones 123<U+2013>24.</ref>
[[Image:Haakon den godes saga - Hold fram som du stevner - C. Krohg.jpg|thumb|left|Battle between Gunnhild's sons and the army of Haakon. Illustration by Krohg.]]
During the reign of [[Harald II of Norway|Harald Greyhide]], Gunnhild dominated the court; according to ''Heimskringla'' she "mixed herself much in the affairs of the country."<ref>Jones 123<U+2013>25; ''Harald Grafeld's Saga'' <U+00A7> 1.</ref> Gunnhild's sons killed or deposed many of the jarls and [[petty king]]s that had hitherto ruled the Norwegian provinces, seizing their lands. Famine, possibly caused or exacerbated by these campaigns, plagued the reign of Harald.<ref>Jones 123<U+2013>25; ''Harald Grafeld's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 2<U+2013>17.</ref>

Among the kings slain (around 963) was [[Tryggve Olafsson]] whose widow [[Astrid Eriksdotter]] fled with her son [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]] to [[Sweden]] and then set out for the eastern [[Baltic region|Baltic]].<ref>Jones 124<U+2013>25; ''Olaf Tryggvason's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 2<U+2013>3.</ref> According to ''Heimskringla'' Astrid's flight and its [[Olaf I of Norway#Birth and early life|disastrous consequences]] were in response to Gunnhild having sent soldiers to kidnap or kill her infant son.<ref>Jones 131<U+2013>32; ''Olaf Tryggvason's Saga'' <U+00A7> 3.</ref>
[[Image:Gunnhild-egger-sine-sonar.jpg|left|thumb|Gunnhild and her sons. Illustration by Krohg.]]

Gunnhild was the patron and lover of [[Hrut Herjolfsson]] (or [[Hr<U+00FA>tur Herj<U+00F3>lfsson]]), an Icelandic chieftain who visited Norway during the reign of Gunnhild's son Harald.<ref>Ordower 41<U+2013>61; ''Njal's Saga'' <U+00A7> 3.</ref> This dalliance was all the more scandalous given the difference in their ages; the fact that Gunnhild was a generation older than Hrut was considered noteworthy.<ref>Jochens 204 at n. 56.</ref> Gunnhild engaged in public displays of affection with Hrut that were normally reserved for married couples, such as putting her arms around his neck in an embrace.<ref>Jochens 71.</ref> Moreover, Gunnhild had Hrut sleep with her alone in "the upper chamber."<ref>Jochens 73.</ref> ''Laxdaela Saga'' in particular describes the extent to which she became enamored of Hrut:

<blockquote>Gunnhild, the Queen, loved him so much that she held there was not his equal within the guard, either in talking or in anything else. Even when men were compared, and noblemen therein were pointed to, all men easily saw that Gunnhild thought that at the bottom there must be sheer thoughtlessness, or else envy, if any man was said to be Hrut's equal.<ref>''Laxdaela Saga'' <U+00A7> 19.</ref></blockquote>

She helped Hrut take possession of an inheritance by arranging the death of a man named Soti at the hands of her servant, [[Augmund]] and her son Gudrod.<ref>''Njal's Saga'' <U+00A7> 5.</ref> When Hrut returned home, Gunnhild gave him many presents, but she cursed Hrut with [[priapism]] to ruin his marriage to Unn, daughter of [[Mord Fiddle]]; the two ultimately divorced.<ref>''Njal's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 5<U+2013>8; Fox 289<U+2013>310. In describing the problem to her father, Unn says "when he comes to me his [[penis]] is so large that he can't have any satisfaction from me, and we've both tried every possible way to enjoy each other, but nothing works." ''Njal's Saga'' <U+00A7> 7. Earlier, more prudish translations such as Sir George W. DaSent's 1861 edition merely reported cryptically that Hrut and Unn "did not pull together well as man and wife" and that Hrut "was not master of himself."</ref>

Gunnhild also showed great favor to [[Olaf the Peacock]], Hrut's nephew, who visited the Norwegian court after Hrut's return to Norway. She advised him on the best places and items to trade and even sponsored his trade expeditions.<ref>''Laxdaela Saga'' <U+00A7> 21.</ref>

[[Image:Olav Tryggvasons saga - Geirmund Haakon jarl - C. Krohg.jpg|thumb|Haakon Sigurdsson. Illustration by Krohg.]]

===Exile and death===
[[Haakon Sigurdsson]], [[Trondejarls|jarl of Hla<U+00F0>ir]], arranged the death of Harald Greyhide around 971 with the connivance of Harald Bluetooth, who had invited his foster-son to Denmark to be invested with new Danish [[fief]]s. Civil war broke out between Jarl Haakon and the surviving sons of Erik and Gunnhild, but Haakon proved victorious and Gunnhild had to flee Norway once again, with her remaining sons Gudrod and Ragnfred.<ref>''Olaf Tryggvason's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 16<U+2013>18.</ref> They went to Orkney, again imposing themselves as overlords over Jarl Thorfinn.<ref>Ashley 443; ''Olaf Tryggvason's Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 16<U+2013>18.</ref> However, it appears that Gunnhild was less interested in ruling the country than in having a place to live quietly, and her sons used the islands as a base for abortive raids on Haakon's interests; the government of Orkney was therefore firmly in the hands of Thorfinn.<ref>Ashley 443.</ref>
[[Image:Haraldskaerwoman.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Haraldsk<U+00E6>r Woman in a glass covered coffin, [[Vejle]], Denmark]]
According to the ''[[Jomsvikinga Saga]]'', Gunnhild returned to Denmark around 977 but was killed at the orders of King Harald by being drowned in a bog. The ''<U+00C1>grip'' and Theodoricus Monachus's ''Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium'' contain versions of this account.<ref>See, generally, Ashley 443; ''Jomsvikinga Saga'' <U+00A7><U+00A7> 4&ndash;8.</ref>
[[Image:Olav Tryggvasons saga-Gunnhild-C. Krohg.jpg|thumb|upright|Gunnhild as an old woman. Illustration by Krohg.]]

In 1835, the body of a murdered or ritually [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] woman, the so-called [[Haraldsk<U+00E6>r Woman]], was unearthed in a bog in [[Jutland]]. Because of the account of Gunnhild's murder contained in the ''Jomsviking Saga'' and other sources, the body was mistakenly identified as that of Gunnhild. Based upon the belief of her royal personage, King [[Frederick VI of Denmark]] commanded an elaborate [[sarcophagus]] be [[wood carving|carved]] to hold her body.  This royal treatment of Haraldsk<U+00E6>r Woman<U+2019>s remains explains the excellent state of conservation of the corpse; conversely, [[Tollund Man]], a later discovery, was not properly conserved and most of the body has been lost, leaving only the head as original material in his display. Later [[radiocarbon dating]] demonstrated that the Harakdsk<U+00E6>r Woman was not Gunnhild, but rather a woman who lived in the 6th century BCE.<ref>"[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/bog/gunhild.html Haraldskaer Woman: Bodies of the Bogs]", ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'', [[Archaeological Institute of America]], 10 December 1997. Radiochemical dating methods were not available until well into the twentieth century.</ref>

==Appearances in literature==
Gunnhild was a villain in [[Robert Leighton]]'s 1934 novel ''[[Olaf the Glorious]]'',<ref>Macmillan, 1929.</ref> a fictionalized biography of [[Olaf Tryggvason]]. She is the central character of the novel ''[[Mother of Kings]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]],<ref>[[Tor Books]], 2003</ref> (which makes her a granddaughter of [[Ragnvald Eysteinsson]], accepts the version of her living with the Finnish warlocks and emphasizes her being a witch) and also appears in [[Cecelia Holland]]'s ''[[The Soul Thief]]''.<ref>Forge Books, 2002.</ref>  In ''The Demon of Scattery''<ref>Ace Books, 1979.</ref> by Poul Anderson and [[Mildred Downey Broxon]], the main characters, the Viking Halldor and the [[Irish people|Irish]] ex-[[nun]] Brigit, become Gunnhild's paternal grandparents.
