'''Native Americans in the United States''' are the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples in North America]] within the boundaries of the present-day [[continental United States|continental]] [[United States]], parts of [[Alaska]], and the island state of [[Hawaii]]. They are composed of numerous, distinct [[Native American tribes]] and [[ethnic group]]s, many of which survive as intact political communities. The terms used to refer to Native Americans have been [[Native American name controversy|controversial]]. According to a 1995 [[U.S.&nbsp;Census Bureau]] set of home interviews, most of the respondents with an expressed preference refer to themselves as '''American Indians''' or '''Indians''', and this term has been adopted by major newspapers and some academic groups; however, this term does not include [[Native Hawaiians]] or those [[Alaskan Natives]], such as [[Aleut people|Aleuts]], [[Alutiiq]], [[Cup'ik]], [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]], and [[Inuit]] peoples, who are not American Indians.

Since the end of the 15th&nbsp;century, the [[Human migration|migration]] of Europeans to the Americas, and their importation of [[Africans]] as [[slaves]], has led to centuries of conflict and adjustment between [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]] societies. Europeans created most of the early written historical record about Native Americans after the colonists' immigration to the Americas.<ref name="test">Calloway, Colin G. [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/native-americans-first-view-whites-shore "Native Americans First View Whites from the Shore."] ''American Heritage'', Spring 2009. Retrieved 29 Dec 2011</ref> Many Native Americans lived as [[hunter-gatherer]] societies and told their histories by oral traditions. In many groups, women carried out sophisticated cultivation of numerous varieties of staple crops: maize, beans and squash. The indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the [[agrarian]], proto-industrial, mostly Christian [[immigrants]] from western [[Eurasia]]. Many Native cultures were [[matrilineal]]; the people occupied lands for use of the entire community, for hunting or agriculture. Europeans at that time had [[patriarchal]] cultures and had developed concepts of individual property rights with respect to land that were extremely different.

The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans, as well as shifting alliances among different nations of each culture through the centuries, caused extensive political tension, ethnic violence and social disruption. The Native Americans suffered high fatalities from the contact with [[infectious disease|infectious]] Eurasian diseases, to which they had no acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. [[Epidemics]] after European contact caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations. Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of what today constitutes the U.S. vary significantly, ranging from 1 million to 18 million.<ref name="ggbook">{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=yiKgBuSUPUIC&lpg=RA1-PA44|title=The Native Peoples of North America |author= Bruce E.

</ref> or forced) became a consistent policy through American administrations. During the 19th&nbsp;century, the ideology of [[manifest destiny]] became integral to the American nationalist movement. Expansion of European-American populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in increasing pressure on Native American lands, warfare between the groups, and rising tensions. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from their homelands within established states to lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], accommodating European-American expansion.

The first European Americans to encounter the western interior tribes were generally fur traders and trappers. There were also [[Jesuit]] [[missionaries]] active in the Northern Tier. As United States expansion reached into the [[American West]], settler and miner migrants came into increasing conflict with the [[Great Basin tribes|Great Basin]], [[Great Plains tribes|Great Plains]], and other Western tribes. These were complex [[nomadic]] cultures based on [[horse culture]] and seasonal [[bison]] hunting. They carried out strong [[resistance movement|resistance]] to United States incursions in the decades after the [[American Civil War]], in a series of [[Indian Wars]], which were frequent up until the 1890s, but continued into the 20th century. The transcontinental [[railroad]] brought more non-Natives into tribal land in the west. Over time, the U.S. forced a series of treaties and land cessions by the tribes, and established reservations for them in many western states. U.S. agents encouraged Native Americans to adopt European-style farming and similar pursuits, but European-American agricultural technology of the time was inadequate for often dry reservation lands.  In 1924, Native Americans who were not already U.S. citizens were [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924|granted citizenship]] by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]].

Contemporary Native Americans have a unique relationship with the United States because they may be members of nations, tribes, or bands with sovereignty and [[treaty rights]]. Since the late&nbsp;1960s, Native American activism has led to the building of cultural infrastructure and wider recognition: they have founded independent newspapers and online media; FNX, the first Native American television channel (2011),<ref name="NATV">[http://nafsa.ucdavis.edu/NAFSA%20News.html "FNX: First Nations Experience Television"], NAFSA News (Native American Faculty and Staff Association), University of California, Davis, accessed 25 October 2011.</ref> community schools, [[tribal colleges and universities|tribal colleges]], and tribal museums and language programs; [[Native American studies]] programs in major universities; and national and state museums. Native American and Alaskan Native authors have been increasingly published; they work as academics, policymakers, doctors, and in a wide variety of occupations. Cultural activism has led to an expansion of efforts to teach and preserve indigenous languages for younger generations. Their societies and cultures flourish within a larger population of descendants of immigrants (both voluntary and involuntary): [[African]], [[Asian people|Asian]], [[Middle Eastern]], [[European ethnic groups|European]], and other peoples.

According to the most generally accepted theory of the [[settlement of the Americas]], migrations of humans from [[Eurasia]] to the Americas took place via [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] which connected the two continents across what is now the [[Bering Strait]]. The number and composition of the migrations is still being debated.<ref name="ReferenceA">Ehlers, J., and P.L.

The [[Clovis culture]], a [[megafauna]] hunting culture is primarily identified by use of fluted [[spear]] points. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive [[Clovis point]], a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of [[carbon dating]] methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years [[Before Present|B.P.]] (roughly 9100 to 8850&nbsp;BCE).

Numerous [[Paleoindian]] cultures occupied North America, with some arrayed around the [[Great Plains]] and [[Great Lakes]] of the modern [[United States of America]] and [[Canada]], as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest. According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living on this continent since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional [[creation stories]]. Other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river, believed to be the [[Mississippi]].<ref>Deloria, V., Jr., (1997) ''Red Earth White Lies: Native Americans and The Myth of Scientific Fact''.</ref> Genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast Asians. Archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the Americas.

The [[Folsom Tradition]] was characterized by use of [[Folsom point]]s as projectile tips, and activities known from kill sites, where slaughter and butchering of [[bison]] took place. Folsom tools were left behind between 9000&nbsp;BCE and 8000&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Hillerman, Anthony G. (1973).

Linguists, anthropologists and archeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into North America, later than the first Paleo-Indians. They migrated into Alaska and northern Canada, south along the Pacific Coast, into the interior of Canada, and south to the Great Plains and the American Southwest. They were the earliest ancestors of the [[Athabascan]]- speaking peoples, including the present-day and historical [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]]. They constructed large multi-family dwellings in their villages, which were used seasonally. People did not live there year round, but for the summer to hunt and fish, and to gather food supplies for the winter.<ref>Leer, Jeff, Doug Hitch, & John Ritter. 2001.

They were part of the [[Southwestern Archaic Traditions|Southwestern Archaic Tradition]] centered in north-central [[New Mexico]], the [[San Juan Basin]], the [[Rio Grande]] Valley, southern [[Colorado]], and southeastern [[Utah]].

Since the 1990s, archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] sites in present-day Louisiana and Florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[mound]]s; they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of [[Neolithic Revolution]] to sustain such large villages over long periods. The prime example is [[Watson Brake]] in northern Louisiana, whose 11-mound complex is dated to 3500&nbsp;BCE, making it the oldest, dated site in the Americas for such complex construction. It is nearly 2,000&nbsp;years older than the [[Poverty Point]] site. Construction of the mounds went on for 500&nbsp;years until was abandoned about 2800 BCE, likely due to changing environmental conditions.<ref name="Saunders1">[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5333/1796.full#ref-2 Joe W.

[[Poverty Point culture]] is a Late Archaic [[archaeological culture]] that inhabited the area of the lower Mississippi Valley and surrounding Gulf Coast. The culture thrived from 2200&nbsp;BCE to 700&nbsp;BCE, during the Late Archaic period.<ref>^ Fagan, Brian M. 2005. ''Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent''. Fourth Edition. New York. Thames & Hudson Inc. p. 418.</ref> Evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100&nbsp;sites, from the major complex at [[Poverty Point, Louisiana]] across a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} range to the [[Jaketown Site]] near [[Belzoni, Mississippi]]. Poverty Point is a {{convert|1|mi2}} complex of six major earthwork concentric rings, with additional platform mounds at the site. Artifacts show the people traded with other Native Americans located from Georgia to the Great Lakes region. This is one among numerous mound sites of complex indigenous cultures throughout the Mississippi and Ohio valleys. They were one of several succeeding cultures often described as [[mound builder (people)|mound builder]]s.

The [[Woodland period]] of [[North America]]n [[pre-Columbian]] cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000&nbsp;BCE to 1,000&nbsp;CE in the eastern part of North America. The term "Woodland" was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites dated between the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] and the [[Mississippian culture]]s. The [[Hopewell tradition]] is the term used to describe common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern [[United States]] from 200 BCE to 500 CE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283 |title=Hopewell |publisher=Ohio History Central}}</ref>
[[File:Nordamerikanische Kulturareale en.png|thumb|300px|[[Cultural area]]s of pre-Columbian North America, according to [[Alfred Kroeber]].]]
The Hopewell tradition was not a single [[culture]] or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, who were connected by a common network of trade routes,<ref name="Price">{{Cite book |author=Douglas T. Price, and Gary M. Feinman |year=2008 |title=Images of the Past, 5th edition |pages=274<U+2013>277 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-340520-9}}</ref> known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern [[United States]] into the southeastern [[Canada|Canadian]] shores of [[Lake Ontario]]. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange; most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes. The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over the United States.

[[Coles Creek culture]] is an [[archaeological culture]] from the Lower [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] valley in the southern present-day United States. The period marked a significant change in the cultural history of the area. Population increased dramatically. There is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity, especially by the end of the Coles Creek sequence. Although many of the classic traits of [[chiefdom]] societies were not yet manifested, by 1000&nbsp;CE the formation of simple [[elite]] polities had begun. Coles Creek sites are found in [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]]. It is considered ancestral to the [[Plaquemine culture]].

[[Hohokam]] is one of the four major prehistoric archaeological traditions of the present-day [[American Southwest]].<ref name="mark">Chenault, Mark, Rick Ahlstrom, and Tom Motsinger, (1993) ''In the Shadow of South Mountain: The Pre-Classic Hohokam of 'La Ciudad de los Hornos','' Part I and II.</ref> Living as simple farmers, they raised corn and beans. The early Hohokam founded a series of small villages along the middle [[Gila River]]. The communities were located near good arable land, with [[dry farming]] common in the earlier years of this period.<ref name="mark"/> [[Water well|Wells]], usually less than {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} deep, were dug for domestic water supplies by 300 CE to 500 CE.<ref name="mark"/> Early Hohokam homes were constructed of branches bent in a semi-circular fashion and covered with twigs and reeds. The last layer was heavily applied mud and other materials at hand.<ref name="mark"/>

The [[Mississippian culture]], which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys and built sites throughout the Southeast, created the largest [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] in North America north of Mexico, most notably at [[Cahokia]], on a tributary of the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois. Its ten-story [[Monks Mound]] has a larger circumference than the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] at [[Teotihuacan]] or the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] of [[Egypt]]. The {{convert|6|mi2}} city complex was based on the culture's cosmology; it included more than 100&nbsp;mounds, positioned to support their sophisticated knowledge of [[astronomy]], and built with knowledge of varying soil types. It included a [[Woodhenge]], whose sacred [[Thuja|cedar]] poles were placed to mark the summer and winter [[solstices]] and fall and spring [[equinoxes]]. The society began building at this site about 950&nbsp;CE, and reached its peak population in 1,250&nbsp;CE of 20,000<U+2013>30,000 people, which was not equalled by any city in the present-day United States until after 1800. Cahokia was a major regional [[chiefdom]], with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the sixteenth century, the earliest Spanish explorers encountered Mississippian peoples in the interior of present-day North Carolina and the Southeast.

Sophisticated pre-Columbian sedentary societies evolved in North America. The [[Mississippian culture]] developed the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]], the name which archeologists have given to the regional stylistic similarity of [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[iconography]], [[ceremony|ceremonies]] and [[mythology]]. The rise of the complex culture was based on the people's adoption of [[maize]] agriculture, development of greater population densities, and [[chiefdom]]-level complex social organization from 1200 CE to 1650 CE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/SECC/sld008.htm |title=Connections |author=muller}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Townsend |first=Richard F., and Robert V.

The peoples developed an independent, sophisticated and stratified society, after the cultivation of maize allowed the accumulation of crop surpluses to support a higher density of population. This in turn led to the development of specialized skills among some of the peoples. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the [[religion]] of the Mississippian peoples, and is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.<ref>{{Cite book |editors=F.

The [[Haudenosaunee]] ([[Iroquois|Iroquois League of Nations]] or "People of the Long House"), then based in present-day upstate and western [[New York]], had a [[Confederation|confederacy]] model from the mid-15th&nbsp;century.

Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th&nbsp;century, or in the 17th&nbsp;century [[Beaver Wars]]. Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Kaw people|Kaw]], [[Ponca]] and [[Omaha people]]. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. The Osage warred with [[Caddo]]-speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |title=Osage |publisher=Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture |accessdate=2010-11-29|last=Burns |first=LF}}</ref>

===European exploration and colonization===

After 1492 [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[Age of Discovery#Atlantic Ocean|exploration and colonization of the Americas]] revolutionized how the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]]s perceived themselves. One of the first major contacts, in what would be called the American [[Deep South]], occurred when the conquistador [[Juan Ponce de&nbsp;Le<U+00F3>n]] landed in [[Florida|La Florida]] in April&nbsp;1513. Ponce de Le<U+00F3>n was later followed by other Spanish explorers, such as [[P<U+00E1>nfilo de&nbsp;Narv<U+00E1>ez]] in 1528 and [[Hernando de Soto]] in&nbsp;1539. The subsequent [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists in North America]] often rationalized their expansion of empire with the assumption that they were saving a barbaric, pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.<ref>{{Cite book

In the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], the policy of [[Indian Reductions]] resulted in the forced conversions to Catholicism of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] in northern ''[[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Nueva Espa<U+00F1>a]].'' They had long-established [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Religion|religious traditions]] and [[Theology|theological]] beliefs. What developed during the colonial years and since has been a syncretic Catholicism that absorbed and reflected indigenous beliefs; the religion changed in New Spain.

Estimating the number of Native Americans living in what is today the United States of America before the arrival of the European explorers and settlers has been the subject of much debate. While it is difficult to determine exactly how many Natives lived in North America before Columbus,<ref>"[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/268/5217/1601 Microchronology and Demographic Evidence Relating to the Size of Pre-Columbian North American Indian Populations]".

[[Chicken pox]] and [[measles]], [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] but rarely fatal among Europeans (long after being introduced from [[Asia]]), often proved deadly to Native Americans. [[Smallpox]] [[epidemic]]s often immediately followed European exploration and sometimes destroyed entire village populations.

In 1618<U+2013>1619, smallpox killed 90% of the Native Americans in the area of the [[Massachusetts Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9968/9968.ch01.html |title=David A.

Between 1754 and 1763, many Native American tribes were involved in the [[French and Indian War]]/[[Seven Years War]]. Those involved in the [[fur trade]] in the northern areas tended to ally with French forces against British colonial militias. Native Americans fought on both sides of the conflict. The greater number of tribes fought with the French in the hopes of checking British expansion. The British had made fewer allies, but it was joined by some tribes that wanted to prove assimilation and loyalty in support of treaties to preserve their territories. They were often disappointed when such treaties were later overturned. The tribes had their own purposes, using their alliances with the European powers to battle traditional Native enemies.

====Animal introductions====
With the meeting of two worlds, animals, insects, and plants were carried from one to the other, both deliberately and by chance, in what is called the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Sheep, pigs, horses, and cattle were all Old World animals that were introduced to contemporary Native Americans who never knew such animals.<ref>[http://spider.georgetowncollege.edu/htallant/courses/his111/columb.htm]</ref> 

In the 16th&nbsp;century, Spaniards and other Europeans brought [[horse]]s to Mexico. Some of the horses escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild. The early [[Equus scotti|American horse]] had been game for the earliest humans on the continent. It was hunted to extinction about 7000&nbsp;BCE, just after the end of the [[last glacial period]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Native Americans benefited by reintroduction of horses. As they adopted use of the animals, they began to change their cultures in substantial ways, especially by extending their nomadic ranges for hunting. 

The reintroduction of the horse to [[North America]] had a profound impact on [[Plains Indian|Native American culture of the Great Plains]]. The tribes trained and used horses to ride and to carry packs or pull [[travois]]. The people fully incorporated the use of horses into their societies and expanded their territories. They used horses to carry goods for exchange with neighboring tribes, to hunt [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[American Bison|bison]], and to conduct wars and horse raids.

===King Philip's War===
[[King Philip's War]] sometimes called [[Metacomet|Metacom]]'s War or Metacom's Rebellion, was an armed conflict between Native American inhabitants of present-day southern New England and English colonists and their Native American allies from 1675 to 1676. It continued in northern New England (primarily on the Maine frontier) even after King Philip was killed, until a [[Treaty of Casco (1678)|treaty was signed at Casco Bay]] in April 1678.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} According to a combined estimate of loss of life in Schultz and Tougias' "King Philip's War, The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict" (based on sources from the Department of Defense, the Bureau of Census, and the work of Colonial historian Francis Jennings), 800 out of 52,000 English colonists of [[New England]] (1 out of every 65) and 3,000 out of 20,000 natives (3 out of every 20) lost their lives due to the war, which makes it proportionately one of the bloodiest and costliest in the history of America.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} More than half of New England's ninety towns were assaulted by Native American warriors. One in ten soldiers on both sides were wounded or killed.<ref>[http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/horsemusket/kingphilip/default.aspx Philip's War: America's Most Devastating Conflict]. Walter Giersbach. Military History Online.</ref>

The war is named after the main leader of the Native American side, Metacomet, Metacom, or Pometacom, known to the English as "King Philip." He was the last Massasoit (Great Leader) of the Pokanoket Tribe/Pokanoket Federation & Wampanoag Nation. Upon their loss to the Colonists and the attempted genocide of the Pokanoket Tribe and Royal Line, many managed to flee to the North to continue their fight against the British (Massachusetts Bay Colony) by joining with the Abanaki Tribes and Wabanaki Federation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

During the [[American Revolution]], the newly proclaimed [[United States]] competed with the British for the allegiance of Native American nations east of the [[Mississippi River]]. Most Native Americans who joined the struggle sided with the British, based both on their trading relationships and hopes that colonial defeat would result in a halt to further colonial expansion onto Native American land. Many native communities were divided over which side to support in the war and others wanted to remain neutral. The first native community to [[Treaty of Fort Pitt (1778)|sign a treaty with the new United States Government]] was the [[Lenape]]. For the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy, based in New York, the American Revolution resulted in [[civil war]]. The only Iroquois tribes to ally with the colonials were the Oneida and Tuscarora.

[[Frontier warfare during the American Revolution]] was particularly brutal, and numerous atrocities were committed by settlers and native tribes alike. Noncombatants suffered greatly during the war. Military expeditions on each side destroyed villages and food supplies to reduce the ability of people to fight, as in frequent raids by both sides in the [[Mohawk Valley]] and western New York.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9077648/Wyoming-Massacre Wyoming Massacre], ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica''.</ref> The largest of these expeditions was the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779, in which American colonial troops destroyed more than 40 Iroquois villages to neutralize Iroquois raids in [[upstate New York]]. The expedition failed to have the desired effect: Native American activity became even more determined.

The British made peace with the Americans in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], through which they ceded vast Native American territories to the United States without informing or consulting with the Native Americans.  The [[Northwest Indian War]] was led by Native American tribes trying to repulse American settlers. The United States initially treated the Native Americans who had fought as allies with the British as a conquered people who had lost their lands. Although most members of the Iroquois tribes went to Canada with the Loyalists, others tried to stay in New York and western territories to maintain their lands. The state of New York made a separate treaty with Iroquois nations and put up for sale {{convert|5000000|acre|km2}} of land that had previously been their territories.  The state established small reservations in western New York for the remnant peoples.

[[Robert Remini]], a historian, wrote that "once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans."<ref name="remini_submit_adoption" /> The United States appointed agents, like [[Benjamin Hawkins]], to live among the Native Americans and to teach them how to live like whites.<ref name="perdue" />

In the late 18th century, reformers starting with Washington and Knox,<ref>''The Great Confusion in Indian Affairs: Native Americans and Whites in the Progressive Era'', Tom Holm, http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/excerpts/exholgre.html</ref> supported educating native children and adults, in efforts to "[[civilization|civilize]]" or otherwise assimilate Native Americans to the larger society (as opposed to relegating them to [[Native American reservation|reservations]]). The [[Civilization Fund Act]] of 1819 promoted this civilization policy by providing funding to societies (mostly religious) who worked on Native American improvement.

====Resistance====
[[File:Tecumseh02.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tecumseh]] was the Shawnee leader of [[Tecumseh's War]] who attempted to organize an alliance of Native American tribes throughout North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snowwowl.com/swolfpastnotables.html |title=Past Notable Native Americans |publisher=Snowwowl.com |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>]]
As American expansion continued, Native Americans resisted settlers' encroachment in several regions of the new nation (and in unorganized territories), from the Northwest to the Southeast, and then in the West, as settlers encountered the tribes of the [[Great Plains]].  

East of the Mississippi River, an intertribal army led by [[Tecumseh]], a Shawnee chief, fought a number of engagements in the Northwest during the period 1811<U+2013>12, known as [[Tecumseh's War]]. In the latter stages, Tecumseh's group allied with the British forces in the [[War of 1812]] and was instrumental in the conquest of [[Detroit]]. Conflicts in the Southeast include the [[Creek War]] and [[Seminole Wars]], both before and after the [[Indian Removal]]s of most members of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] beginning in the 1830s under President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s policies.

Native American nations on the plains in the west continued armed conflicts with the United States throughout the 19th century, through what were called generally "[[Indian Wars]]." The [[Battle of Little Bighorn]] (1876) was one of the greatest Native American victories. Defeats included the [[Sioux Uprising]] of 1862,<ref>{{cite book |author=Kenneth Carley |title=The Dakota War of 1862|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xU5gUgZcmPEC&pg=PA1-IA2 |accessdate=1 May 2011 |date=15 July 2001 |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press |isbn=978-0-87351-392-0 |page=1}}</ref> the [[Sand Creek Massacre]] (1864) and [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] in 1890.<ref>Ralph K.

According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), <blockquote>"The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians."<ref>Thornton, Russell (1990).

====American expansion====
[[File:American progress.JPG|thumb|Native Americans flee from the allegorical representation of [[Manifest Destiny]], [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], painted in 1872 by [[John Gast (painter)|John Gast]]]]

In July 1845, the New York newspaper editor John L. O<U+2019>Sullivan coined the phrase, "Manifest Destiny," as the "design of Providence" supporting the territorial expansion of the United States.<ref>Worlds Together, Worlds Apart, Robert Tignor, Jeremy Adelman, Stephen Aron, Stephen Kotkin, Suzanne Marchand, Gyan Prakash, Michael Tsin, W.W. Norton & Company, New York, 2000, p. 274.</ref> [[Manifest Destiny]] had serious consequences for Native Americans, since continental expansion for the United States took place at the cost of their occupied land. Manifest Destiny was a justification for expansion and westward movement, or, in some interpretations, an ideology or doctrine that helped to promote the process of civilization. Advocates of Manifest Destiny believed that expansion was not only good, but that it was obvious and certain. The term was first used primarily by [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] in the 1840s to promote the annexation of much of what is now the [[Western United States]] (the [[Oregon Territory]], the [[Texas Annexation]], and the [[Mexican Cession]]).

The age of Manifest Destiny, which came to be associated with extinguishing American Indian territorial claims and removing them to reservations, gained ground as the United States population explored and settled west of the Mississippi River. Although Indian Removal from the Southeast had been proposed by some as a humanitarian measure to ensure their survival away from Americans, conflicts of the nineteenth century led some Americans to regard the natives as "savages".

====Removals and reservations====
{{main|Americanization of Native Americans}}
{{Further|List of Native American reservations in the United States}}

In the 19th century, the incessant [[Manifest Destiny|westward expansion of the United States]] incrementally compelled large numbers of Native Americans to resettle further west, often by force, almost always reluctantly. Native Americans believed this forced relocation illegal, given the [[Hopewell Treaty|Hopewell Treaty of 1785]]. Under President [[Andrew Jackson]], [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, which authorized the President to conduct treaties to exchange Native American land east of the [[Mississippi River]] for lands west of the river . As many as 100,000 Native Americans relocated to the West as a result of this [[Indian Removal]] policy. In theory, relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many Native Americans did remain in the East. In practice, great pressure was put on Native American leaders to sign removal treaties.

The most egregious violation of the stated intention of the removal policy took place under the [[Treaty of New Echota]], which was signed by a dissident faction of [[Cherokee]]s but not the principal chief.  The following year, the Cherokee conceded to removal, but Georgia included their land in a lottery for European-American settlement before that.  President Jackson used the military to gather and transport the Cherokee to the west, whose timing and lack of adequate supplies led to the deaths of an estimated 4,000 Cherokees on the [[Trail of Tears]]. About 17,000 Cherokees, along with approximately 2,000 enslaved blacks held by Cherokees, were taken by force migration to Indian Territory.<ref>Carter (III), Samuel (1976). ''Cherokee Sunset: A Nation Betrayed : A Narrative of Travail and Triumph, Persecution and Exile''. New York: Doubleday, p. 232.</ref>

Tribes were generally located to reservations where they could more easily be separated from traditional life and pushed into European-American society. Some southern states additionally enacted laws in the 19th century forbidding non-Native American settlement on Native American lands, with the intention to prevent sympathetic white missionaries from aiding the scattered Native American resistance.<ref>see [[Genocides in history#Americas]]</ref>

====Education and Indian boarding schools====
{{main|Indian boarding schools}}
After the Indian wars in the late 19th century, the United States established [[Native American boarding schools]], initially run primarily by or affiliated with Christian missionaries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewarticle.asp?AuthorID=2616&id=7375 |work=authorsden.com |title=What Were Boarding Schools Like for Indian Youth? |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> At this time American society thought that Native American children needed to be acculturated to the general society. The [[boarding school]] experience often proved traumatic to Native American children, who were forbidden to speak their [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#Greenland, Canada & USA|native languages]], taught [[Christianity]] and denied the right to practice their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Native American identities<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/static/archive/news/projects/native/day2_main.html

Since the rise of self-determination for Native Americans, they have generally emphasized education of their children at schools near where they live. In addition, many federally recognized tribes have taken over operations of such schools and added programs of language retention and revival to strengthen their cultures. Beginning in the 1970s, tribes have also founded [[Tribal colleges and universities|colleges]] at their reservations, controlled and operated by Native Americans, to educate their young for jobs as well as to pass on their cultures.

|publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}</ref> Their fellow soldiers often held them in high esteem, in part since the legend of the tough Native American warrior had become a part of the fabric of American historical legend. White servicemen sometimes showed a lighthearted respect toward Native American comrades by calling them "chief". The resulting increase in contact with the world outside of the reservation system brought profound changes to Native American culture. "The war", said the U.S.&nbsp;Indian Commissioner in 1945, "caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era", affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.<ref>Bernstein, p. 131</ref> The most significant of these changes was the opportunity<U+2014>as a result of wartime labor shortages<U+2014>to find well-paying work in cities, and many people relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry.

There were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200&nbsp;[[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] men served in World War&nbsp;II; only about half came home alive. In addition many more [[Navajo people|Navajo]] served as code talkers for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although [[cryptology|cryptologically]] very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese.

====Self-determination====
{{main|Native American self-determination|Native American civil rights}}

Military service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the [[occupation of Alcatraz Island]] (1969<U+2013>1971) by a student Indian group from [[San Francisco]]. In the same period, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded in [[Minneapolis]], and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public.

Through the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the [[Wounded Knee incident]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300&nbsp;[[Oglala Lakota]] and [[American Indian Movement]]&nbsp;(AIM) activists took control of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] on February&nbsp;27,&nbsp;1973. Indian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71&nbsp;days. During much gunfire, one [[United States Marshal]] was wounded and paralyzed.

In 1975 the U.S.&nbsp;Congress passed the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]], marking the culmination of 15&nbsp;years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s&nbsp;policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S.&nbsp;government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance.

By this time, tribes had already started to establish community schools to replace the BIA&nbsp;boarding schools. Led by the [[Navajo Nation]] in&nbsp;1968, tribes started [[tribal colleges and universities]], to build their own models of education on reservations, preserve and revive their cultures, and develop educated workforces. In&nbsp;1994 the U.S.&nbsp;Congress passed legislation recognizing the tribal colleges as [[land-grant colleges]], which provided opportunities for funding. Thirty-two tribal colleges in the United States belong to the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]]. By the early 21st&nbsp;century, tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools.

In addition, Native American activism has led major universities across the country to establish [[Native American studies]] programs and departments, increasing awareness of the strengths of Indian cultures, providing opportunities for academics, and deepening research on history and cultures in the United States. Native Americans have entered academia; journalism and media; politics at local, state and federal levels; and public service, for instance, influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to American Indians. In&nbsp;1981, [[Tim Giago]] founded the ''[[Lakota Times]]'', an independent Native American newspaper, located at the Pine Ridge Reservation but not controlled by tribal government. He later founded the [[Native American Journalists Association]]. Other independent newspapers and media corporations have been developed, so that Native American journalists are contributing perspective on their own affairs and other policies and events.

In&nbsp;2004 Senator [[Sam Brownback]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] of [[Kansas]]) introduced a joint resolution (Senate Joint Resolution&nbsp;37) to "offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States" for past "ill-conceived policies" by the U.S.&nbsp;government regarding Indian Tribes.<ref name="HISTORIC RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES INTRODUCED IN U.S. CONGRESS May 6, 2004">{{cite web

==International indigenous rights==
Activists around the world have been working on organizing for indigenous rights. On September&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2007 the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], after nearly 25&nbsp;years of discussion. Indigenous representatives from the United States, particularly from AIM, played a key role in the development of this Declaration, as did indigenous peoples from the Americas and other nations. It was passed with an overwhelming majority of 143&nbsp;votes in favor; only Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States voted against it. Each of these four nations has indigenous populations that became outnumbered, disfranchised and historically oppressed by new immigrant groups.<ref>{{Cite book

==Current legal status==
{{main|Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Native American tribe}}
There are 562&nbsp;[[List of Native American Tribal Entities|federally recognized tribal governments]] in the United States. These tribes possess the right to form their own governments, to enforce laws (both civil and criminal) within their lands, to tax, to establish requirements for membership, to license and regulate activities, to zone and to exclude persons from tribal territories. Limitations on tribal powers of self-government include the same limitations applicable to states; for example, neither tribes nor states have the power to make war, engage in foreign relations, or coin money (this includes paper currency).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2005/January/200501281313241CJsamohT0.7689478.html |work=america.gov |title=The U.S. Relationship To American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref>

Many Native Americans and advocates of Native American rights point out that the U.S.&nbsp;federal government's claim to recognize the "sovereignty" of Native American peoples falls short, given that the United States wishes to govern Native American peoples and treat them as subject to U.S.&nbsp;law. Such advocates contend that full respect for Native American sovereignty would require the U.S.&nbsp;government to deal with Native American peoples in the same manner as any other sovereign nation, handling matters related to relations with Native Americans through the Secretary of State, rather than the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. The Bureau of Indian Affairs reports on its website that its "responsibility is the administration and management of {{convert|55700000|acre|km2}} of land held in trust by the United States for American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives".<ref>{{cite web

As of year&nbsp;2000, the largest tribes in the United States by population were [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Sioux]], [[Chippewa]], [[Apache]], [[Blackfeet]], [[Iroquois]], and [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]]. In 2000, eight of ten Americans with Native American ancestry were of mixed ancestry. It is estimated that by 2100 that figure will rise to nine out of ten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:D-aV4g_I9XQJ:www.law.nyu.edu/kingsburyb/spring04/indigenousPeoples/classmaterials/class10/Class%2010%20Item%20A6%20-%20Gould.doc+genealogy++ |work=Columbia Law Review |title=Mixing Bodies and Beliefs: The Predicament of Tribes |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref>
In addition, there are a number of tribes that are [[List of State Recognized American Indian Tribal Entities|recognized by individual states]], but not by the federal government. The rights and benefits associated with state recognition vary from state to state.

Some tribal nations have been unable to document the cultural continuity required for federal recognition. The [[Ohlone|Muwekma Ohlone]] of the San Francisco bay area are pursuing litigation in the federal court system to establish recognition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muwekma.org |title=The Muwekman Ohlone |accessdate=2007-06-22 |work=muwekma.org}}</ref> Many of the smaller eastern tribes, long considered remnants of extinct peoples, have been trying to gain official recognition of their tribal status. Several in Virginia and North Carolina have gained state recognition. Federal recognition confers some benefits, including the right to label arts and crafts as Native American and permission to apply for grants that are specifically reserved for Native Americans. But gaining federal recognition as a tribe is extremely difficult; to be established as a tribal group, members have to submit extensive [[genealogy|genealogical]] proof of tribal descent and continuity of the tribe as a culture.

In the state of [[Virginia]], Native Americans face a unique problem. Virginia has no federally recognized tribes but the state has recognized eight. This is related historically to the greater impact of disease and warfare on the Virginia Indian populations, as well as their intermarriage with Europeans and Africans. Some people confused the ancestry with culture, but groups of Virginia Indians maintained their cultural continuity. Most of their early reservations were ended under the pressure of early European settlement.

Some historians also note the problems of Virginia Indians in establishing documented continuity of identity, due to the work of [[Walter Ashby Plecker]] (1912<U+2013>1946). As registrar of the state's Bureau of Vital Statistics, he applied his own interpretation of the [[one-drop rule]], enacted in law in&nbsp;1924 as the state's Racial Integrity Act. It recognized only two races: "white" and "colored".

Plecker, a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]], believed that the state's Native Americans had been "mongrelized" by intermarriage with [[African American]]s; to him, ancestry determined identity, rather than culture. He thought that some people of partial black ancestry were trying to "[[passing (racial identity)|pass]]" as Native Americans. Plecker thought that anyone with any African heritage had to be classified as colored, regardless of appearance, amount of European or Native American ancestry, and cultural/community identification. Plecker pressured local governments into reclassifying all Native Americans in the state as "colored", and gave them lists of family surnames to examine for reclassification based on his interpretation of data and the law. This led to the state's destruction of accurate records related to families and communities who identified as Native American (as in church records and daily life). By his actions, sometimes different members of the same family were split by being classified as "white" or "colored". He did not allow people to enter their primary identification as Native American in state records.<ref name="home.hamptonroads.com">{{cite web |url=http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |work=Pilotonline.com |title=The black-and-white world of Walter Ashby Plecker |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> In 2009, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee endorsed a bill that would grant federal recognition to tribes in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146//|title=Virginia tribes take another step on road to federal recognition}}</ref>

To achieve federal recognition and its benefits, tribes must prove continuous existence since&nbsp;1900. The federal government has maintained this requirement, in part because through participation on councils and committees, federally recognized tribes have been adamant about groups' satisfying the same requirements as they did.<ref name="home.hamptonroads.com"/>

Native American struggles amid poverty to maintain life on the reservation or in larger society have resulted in a variety of health issues, some related to nutrition and health practices.

In addition to increasing numbers of American Indians entering the fields of community health and medicine, agencies working with Native American communities have sought partnerships, representatives of policy and program boards, and other ways to learn and respect their traditions and integrate the benefits of Western medicine within their own cultural practices.

In the early 21st century, Native American communities have exhibited continuing growth and revival, playing a larger role in the American economy, and in the lives of Native Americans. Communities have consistently formed governments that administer services such as [[firefighting]], [[natural resource]] management, social programs, housing and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]]. Most Native American communities have established [[court]] systems to adjudicate matters related to local ordinances, and most also look to various forms of moral and social authority, such as forms of [[restorative justice]], vested in the traditional culture of the tribal nation. To address the housing needs of Native Americans, Congress passed the ''Native American Housing and Self Determination Act'' (NAHASDA) in 1996. This legislation replaced public housing built by the BIA, and other 1937 Housing Act programs directed towards Indian Housing Authorities, with a block-grant program providing funds to be administered by the Tribes to develop their own housing.

Universities have conducted relatively little public opinion research on attitudes toward Native Americans among the general public. In 2007 the non-partisan Public Agenda organization conducted a focus group study. Most non-Native Americans admitted they rarely encountered Native Americans in their daily lives. While sympathetic toward Native Americans and expressing regret over the past, most people had only a vague understanding of the problems facing Native Americans today.

American Indian activists in the United States and Canada have criticized the use of Native American [[mascot]]s in sports, as perpetuating stereotypes. European Americans have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back to at least the 18th&nbsp;century.<ref name="Calloway">''First Peoples,'' Colin G. Calloway, 2nd Edition, 2004</ref> While supporters of the mascots say they embody the heroism of Native American warriors, AIM particularly has criticized the use of mascots as offensive and demeaning. While many universities and professional sports teams (for example, the [[Cleveland Indians]], who had a [[Chief Wahoo]]) no longer use such images without consultation and approval by the respective nation, some lower-level schools continue to do so. On the other hand, in the Bay Area of California, Tomales Bay High and Sequoia High have retired their Indian mascots.

Native Americans have been depicted by [[List of American artists|American artists]] in various ways at different historical periods. During the 16th century, the artist [[John White (surveyor)|John White]] made watercolors and engravings of the people native to the southeastern states. John White<U+2019>s images were, for the most part, faithful likenesses of the people he observed.

The artist [[Theodore de&nbsp;Bry]] used White<U+2019>s original watercolors to make a book of engravings entitled, ''A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia''. In his book, de Bry often altered the poses and features of White<U+2019>s figures to make them appear more European. During the period when White and de Bry were working, when Europeans were first coming into contact with Native Americans, Europeans were greatly interested in native American cultures. Their curiosity created demand for a book like de Bry<U+2019>s.

A number of 19th and 20th-century United States and Canadian painters, often motivated by a desire to document and preserve Native culture, specialized in Native American subjects. Among the most prominent of these were [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], [[George Catlin]], [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Seth Eastman]], [[Paul Kane]], [[W. Langdon Kihn]], [[Charles Bird King]], [[Joseph Henry Sharp]], and [[John Mix Stanley]].

During the construction of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in the early 19th century, the [[U.S. government]] commissioned a series of four relief panels to crown the doorway of the [[United States Capitol rotunda|Rotunda]]. The reliefs encapsulate a vision of European<U+2014>Native American relations that had assumed mythic historical proportions by the 19th&nbsp;century. The four panels depict: ''The Preservation of Captain Smith by Pocahontas'' (1825) by [[Antonio Capellano]], ''The Landing of the Pilgrims'' (1825) and ''The Conflict of Daniel Boone and the Indians'' (1826<U+2013>27) by [[Enrico Causici]], and ''William Penn<U+2019>s Treaty with the Indians'' (1827) by [[Nicholas Gevelot]]. The reliefs by European sculptors present versions of the Europeans and the Native Americans, in which the Europeans appear refined and the natives appear ferocious. The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] representative of [[Virginia]], [[Henry A. Wise]], wrote about how Native Americans might think of the reliefs: "We give you corn, you cheat us of our lands: we save your life, you take ours." While many 19th-century images of Native Americans conveyed similarly negative messages, artists such as [[Charles Bird King]] sought to express a more balanced image of Native Americans.

During this time, some fiction writers were informed about and sympathetic to Native American culture. [[Marah Ellis Ryan]] conveyed the culture with sympathy.

In the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in [[movies]] and [[television]] roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included ''The Last of the Mohicans'' (1920), ''Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans'' (1957), and ''[[F Troop]]'' (1965<U+2013>67). In later decades, Native American actors such as [[Jay Silverheels]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Television series|The Lone Ranger]]'' television series (1949<U+2013>57) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), which depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles.

For years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles. During the years of the series ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959<U+2013>1973), no major or secondary Native characters appeared on a consistent basis. The series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949<U+2013>1957), ''[[Cheyenne]]'' (1957<U+2013>1963), and ''[[Law of the Plainsman]]'' (1959<U+2013>1963) had Native characters who were essentially aides to the central white characters. This continued in such series as ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How the West Was Won]]''. These programs resembled the "sympathetic" yet contradictory film ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' of 1990, in which, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, the narrative choice was to relate the Lakota story as told through a Euro-American voice, for wider impact among a general audience.<ref>Shohat, Ella, and Stam, Robert. ''Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media''. New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref>
Like the 1992 remake of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]'' (1993), ''Dances with Wolves'' employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages.

In 2004 producer Guy Perrotta presented the film ''[[Mystic Voices: The Story of the Pequot War]]'' (2004), a television documentary on the first major war between colonists and Native peoples in the Americas. Perrotta and Charles Clemmons intended to increase public understanding of the significance of this early event. They believed it had significance not only for northeastern Native Peoples and descendants of English and Dutch colonists, but for all Americans today. Wanting to make the film historically accurate and unbiased, the producers invited a broadly based Advisory Board, and used scholars, Native Americans, and descendants of the colonists to help tell the story. They elicited personal and often passionate viewpoints from contemporary Americans. The production portrayed the conflict as a struggle between different value systems, which included not only the Pequot, but a number of other Native American tribes, most of which allied with the English. It presents facts and seeks to help viewers better understand the several peoples who fought the War.

In 2009 ''[[We Shall Remain (documentary)|We Shall Remain]]'' (2009), a television documentary by [[Ric Burns]] and part of the [[American Experience]] series, presented a five-episode series "from a Native American perspective". It represented "an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non-Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project."<ref>{{Cite news |title=About the Project: We Shall Remain|url =http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/the_films/about |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> The five episodes explore the impact of [[King Philip's War]] on the northeastern tribes, the "Native American confederacy" of [[Tecumseh's War]], the US-forced relocation of Southeastern tribes known as the [[Trail of Tears]], the pursuit and capture of [[Geronimo]] and the [[Apache Wars]], and concludes with the [[Wounded Knee incident]], participation by the [[American Indian Movement]], and the increasing resurgence of modern Native cultures since.

===Terminology differences===
{{further2|[[Native American name controversy]]}}

====Common usage in the United States====
[[File:Martha gradolf hochunk.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Martha Gradolf, [[Hochunk]] weaver from [[Indiana]]]]
Native Americans are more commonly known as Indians or American Indians, and have been known as Aboriginal Americans, Amerindians, Amerinds, Colored,<ref name="clr"/><ref name="osv">{{cite web |title=OSV Documents <U+2013> Historical Background on People of Color in Rural New England in the Early 19th Century |url=http://www.osv.org/explore_learn/document_viewer.php?DocID=2044|year=2003|accessdate=2009-06-12 |publisher=Old Sturbridge Inc |author=Jack Larkin}}</ref> First Americans, Native Indians, Indigenous, Original Americans, Red Indians, Redskins or Red Men.
The term ''Native American'' was introduced in the [[United States]] by academics{{Who|date=May 2012}} in preference to the older term ''Indian'' to distinguish the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from the people of [[India]], and to avoid negative stereotypes associated with the term ''Indian''. Some academics{{Who|date=May 2012}} believe that the term ''Indian'' should be considered outdated or offensive. Many indigenous Americans, however, prefer the term ''American Indian''.<ref name="Census">{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762158.html |work=Infoplease |title=Preference for Racial or Ethnic Terminology |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}
</ref> Others point out that anyone born in the United States is, technically, native to America. In this sense, "native" was substituted for "indigenous". Today, people from India (and their descendants) who are citizens of the United States are called ''[[Indian American]]s'' or ''Asian Indians''.

Criticism of the [[neologism]] ''Native American'' comes from diverse sources. [[Russell Means]], an American Indian activist, opposes the term ''Native American'' because he believes it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians. He has also argued that the use of the word ''Indian'' derives not from a confusion with [[India]] but from a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] expression ''En Dio'', meaning "in God".<ref>Russell Means "I am an American Indian, not a native American!" (Treaty Productions, 1996); citation given here [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/5526] and here [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/bismarck_200504A16.html] and they cover the general subject and some Means' contribution, but have no reference to "En Dio" and only those non-working links to text.</ref> Furthermore, some American Indians{{Who|date=October 2009}} question the term ''Native American'' because, they argue, it serves to ease the conscience of "white America" with regard to past injustices done to American Indians by effectively eliminating "Indians" from the present.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allthingscherokee.com/atc_sub_culture_feat_events_070101.html |work=All Things Cherokee |title=What's in a Name? Indians and Political Correctness |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> Still others (both Indians and non-Indians){{Who|date=October 2009}} argue that ''Native American'' is problematic because "native of" literally means "born in," so any person born in the Americas could be considered "native". The compound "Native American" is generally [[capitalization|capitalized]] to differentiate the reference to the indigenous peoples.

A 1995 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred ''American Indian'' to ''Native American''.<ref name="Census" /> Most American Indians are comfortable with ''Indian'', ''American Indian'', and ''Native American'', and the terms are often used interchangeably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/aihmterms.html |work=Infoplease |title=''American Indian'' versus ''Native American'' |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> The traditional term is reflected in the name chosen for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], which opened in 2004 on the Mall in [[Washington, D.C.]].

Recently, the U.S.&nbsp;Census Bureau has introduced the "Asian-Indian" category to avoid ambiguity for descendants of people from India.

===Gambling industry===
[[File:Sandia Casino, detail.jpg|thumb|Sandia Casino, owned by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] of [[New Mexico]]]]
{{Main|Native American gaming}}
[[Gambling]] has become a leading industry. [[Casino]]s operated by many Native American governments in the United States are creating a stream of gambling revenue that some communities are beginning to use as leverage to build diversified economies. Native American communities have waged and prevailed in legal battles to assure recognition of rights to self-determination and to use of natural resources. Some of those rights, known as treaty rights, are enumerated in early treaties signed with the young United States government. [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Tribal sovereignty]] has become a cornerstone of American [[jurisprudence]], and at least on the surface, in national legislative policies. Although many Native American tribes have casinos, the [[impact of Native American gaming]] is widely debated. Some tribes, such as the [[Winnemem Wintu]] of [[Redding, California]], feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out. These tribes refuse to participate in the gambling industry.

==Society, language, and culture==
===Ethno-linguistic classification===
{{Main|Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous languages of the Americas|}}

Far from forming a single ethnic group, Native Americans were divided into several hundred ethno-linguistic groups, most of them grouped into the [[Na-Den<U+00E9>]] ([[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]]), [[Algic]] (including [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]), [[Uto-Aztecan]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], [[Siouan<U+2013>Catawban languages|Siouan<U+2013>Catawban]], [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]], [[Salishan languages|Salishan]] and [[Yuman languages|Yuman]] phyla, besides many smaller groups and several [[language isolate]]s. Demonstrating genetic relationships has proved difficult due to the great linguistic diversity present in North America.

The indigenous peoples of North America can be classified as belonging to a number of large cultural areas:
[[File:Early Localization Native Americans USA.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Early Indian languages in the US]]
*[[Alaska Natives]]
**Arctic: [[Eskimo<U+2013>Aleut]]
**Subarctic: [[Northern Athabaskan languages|Northern Athabaskan]]
*[[Western United States]]
**[[Californian tribes]] (Northern): [[Yok-Utian]], [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages|Pacific Coast Athabaskan]], [[Coast Miwok]], [[Yurok language|Yurok]], [[Palaihnihan languages|Palaihnihan]], [[Chumashan languages|Chumashan]], [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]]
**[[Plateau tribes]]: [[Interior Salish]], [[Plateau Penutian languages|Plateau Penutian]]
**[[Great Basin tribes]]: [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]]
**[[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Pacific Northwest Coast]]: [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages|Pacific Coast Athabaskan]], [[Coast Salish]]
**[[Southwestern tribes]]: [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Yuman]], [[Southern Athabaskan languages|Southern Athabaskan]]
*[[Central United States]]
**[[Plains Indians]]: [[Siouan languages|Siouan]], [[Plains Algonquian languages|Plains Algonquian]], [[Southern Athabaskan languages|Southern Athabaskan]]
*[[Eastern United States]]
**[[Northeastern Woodlands tribes]]: [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], [[Central Algonquian languages|Central Algonquian]], [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]]
**[[Southeastern tribes]]: [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean]], [[Siouan languages|Siouan]], [[Catawban languages|Catawban]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]

Of the surviving languages, Uto-Aztecan has the most speakers (1.95&nbsp;million) if the languages in Mexico are considered (mostly due to 1.5&nbsp;million speakers of [[Nahuatl]]); Nadene comes in second with approximately 180,200&nbsp;speakers (148,500 of these are speakers of [[Navajo language|Navajo]]). Na-Den<U+00E9> and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada across much of the continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]]) with two outliers in [[California]] ([[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]]); Na-Den<U+00E9> spans from Alaska and western [[Canada]] through [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and California to the [[Southwestern United States|U.S. Southwest]] and northern Mexico (with one outlier in the Plains).
Another area of considerable diversity appears to have been the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]]; however, many of these languages became extinct from European contact and as a result they are, for the most part, absent from the historical record.

===Cultural aspects===
[[File:Hopi woman dressing hair of unmarried girl.jpg|thumb|[[Hopi]] woman dressing hair of unmarried girl from 1900.]]
[[File:Navajo Sheep.jpg|thumb|Sheep remain an important aspect in Navajo Tradition and Culture.]]

Though cultural features, language, clothing, and customs vary enormously from one tribe to another, there are certain elements which are encountered frequently and shared by many tribes.
'''''
Early [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes made stone weapons from around 10,000&nbsp;years ago; as the age of [[metallurgy]] dawned, newer technologies were used and more efficient weapons produced. Prior to contact with Europeans, most tribes used similar weaponry. The most common implements were the bow and arrow, the war club, and the spear. Quality, material, and design varied widely. [[Native American use of fire]] both helped provide and prepare for [[food]] and [[Pre-Columbian savannas of North America|altered the landscape of the continent]] to help the human population flourish.

Large mammals like [[mammoth]]s and [[mastodon]]s were largely extinct by around 8000&nbsp;BCE. Native Americans switched to hunting other large game, such as [[American Bison|bison]]. The Great Plains tribes were still hunting the bison when they first encountered the Europeans. The Spanish reintroduction of the horse to North America in the 17th&nbsp;century and Native Americans' learning to use them greatly altered the natives' culture, including changing the way in which they hunted large game. (Evidence of pre-historic horses prior to the arrival of the Spanish has been found in the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref name="KCBS">{{Cite news |title=Cache Of Ice Age Fossils Found Near Tar Pits |url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090220060922/http://cbs2.com/local/ice.age.fossils.2.937436.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[KCBS-TV]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=February 18, 2009}}</ref><ref name="LA TIMES">{{Cite news |author=Thomas H.

===Organization===
[[File:Zuni-girl-with-jar2.png|thumb|upright|[[Zuni people|Zuni]] girl with pottery jar on her head in 1909]]

====Gens structure====
Early European American scholars described the Native Americans as having a society dominated by [[clans]] or [[gens|gentes]] (in the Roman model) before tribes were formed. There were some common characteristics:
*The right to elect its [[sachem]] and chiefs.
*The right to depose its sachem and chiefs.
*The obligation not to marry in the gens.
*Mutual rights of inheritance of the property of deceased members.
*Reciprocal obligations of help, defense, and redress of injuries.
*The right to bestow names on its members.
*The right to adopt strangers into the gens.
*Common religious rights, query.
*A common burial place.
*A council of the gens.<ref name="Morgan1907">{{Cite book

====Tribal structure====
Subdivision and differentiation took place between various groups. Upwards of forty stock languages developed in North America, with each independent tribe speaking a dialect of one of those languages. Some functions and attributes of tribes are:
[[File:Shonto begay.jpg|thumb|upright|Shonto Begay, [[Navajo people|Navajo]] painter from [[Arizona]]]]
*The possession of the gentes.
*The right to depose these sachems and chiefs.
*The possession of a religious faith and worship.
*A supreme government consisting of a council of chiefs.
*A head-chief of the tribe in some instances.<ref name="Morgan1907"/>

===Society and art===
{{Further|petroglyph|pictogram|petroform|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous ceramics of the Americas|Native American jewelry}}
The [[Iroquois]], living around the [[Great Lakes]] and extending east and north, used strings or belts called ''[[wampum]]'' that served a dual function: the knots and beaded designs mnemonically chronicled tribal stories and legends, and further served as a medium of exchange and a unit of measure. The keepers of the articles were seen as tribal dignitaries.<ref>[http://www.tolatsga.org/iro.html Iroquois History]. Retrieved February 23, 2006.</ref>

[[Pueblo peoples]] crafted impressive items associated with their religious ceremonies. ''[[Kachina]]'' dancers wore elaborately painted and decorated masks as they ritually impersonated various ancestral spirits. Sculpture was not highly developed, but carved stone and wood fetishes were made for religious use. Superior weaving, embroidered decorations, and rich dyes characterized the textile arts. Both turquoise and shell jewelry were created, as were high-quality pottery and formalized pictorial arts.

[[Navajo people|Navajo]] spirituality focused on the maintenance of a harmonious relationship with the spirit world, often achieved by ceremonial acts, usually incorporating [[sandpainting]]. The colors<U+2014>made from sand, charcoal, cornmeal, and pollen<U+2014>depicted specific spirits. These vivid, intricate, and colorful sand creations were erased at the end of the ceremony.

===Agriculture===
{{Further|Native American cuisine}}

[[File:Zea mays.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Maize]] grown by Native Americans]]
[[File:1940 govt photo minnesota farming scene chippewa baby teething on magazine indians at work.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Chippewa baby waits on a cradleboard while parents tend rice crops (Minnesota, 1940).]]

An early crop the Native Americans grew was [[squash (plant)|squash]]. Others early crops included [[cotton]], [[sunflower]], [[pumpkins]], [[tobacco]], [[goosefoot]], [[knotgrass]], and [[sump weed]].

Agriculture in the southwest started around 4,000 years ago when traders brought cultigens from Mexico. Due to the varying climate, some ingenuity was needed for agriculture to be successful. The climate in the southwest ranged from cool, moist mountains regions, to dry, sandy soil in the desert. Some innovations of the time included [[irrigation]] to bring water into the dry regions and the selection of seed based on the traits of the growing plants that bore them. In the southwest, they grew beans that were self-supported, much like the way they are grown today.

In the east, however, they were planted right by corn in order for the vines to be able to "climb" the cornstalks. The most important crop the Native Americans raised was [[maize]]. It was first started in [[Mesoamerica]] and spread north. About 2,000 years ago it reached eastern America. This crop was important to the Native Americans because it was part of their everyday diet; it could be stored in underground pits during the winter, and no part of it was wasted. The husk was made into art crafts, and the cob was used as fuel for fires. By 800 CE the Native Americans had established three main crops&nbsp;<U+2014> beans, squash, and corn&nbsp;<U+2014> called the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]].

The agriculture gender roles of the Native Americans varied from region to region. In the southwest area, men prepared the soil with [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]]. The women were in charge of planting, weeding, and harvesting the crops. In most other regions, the women were in charge of doing everything, including clearing the land. Clearing the land was an immense chore since the Native Americans rotated fields frequently. There is a tradition that [[Squanto]] showed the Pilgrims in New England how to put fish in fields to act like a fertilizer, but the truth of this story is debated. Native Americans did plant beans next to corn; the beans would replace the [[nitrogen]] which the corn took from the ground, as well as using corn stalks for support for climbing. Native Americans used controlled fires to burn weeds and clear fields; this would put nutrients back into the ground. If this did not work, they would simply abandon the field to let it be fallow, and find a new spot for cultivation.

Europeans in the eastern part of the continent observed that Natives cleared large areas for cropland. Their fields in New England sometimes covered hundreds of acres. Colonists in Virginia noted thousands of acres under cultivation by Native Americans.<ref name="Krech">{{Cite book |last=Krech III |first=Shepard |title=The ecological Indian: myth and history |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. |location=New York, New York |year=1999 |edition=1 |page=107 |isbn=0-393-04755-5}}</ref>

Native Americans commonly used tools such as the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[Sledgehammer|maul]], and [[dibber]]. The hoe was the main tool used to till the land and prepare it for planting; then it was used for weeding. The first versions were made out of wood and stone. When the settlers brought iron, Native Americans switched to iron hoes and hatchets. The dibber was a digging stick, used to plant the seed. Once the plants were harvested, women prepared the produce for eating. They used the maul to grind the corn into mash. It was cooked and eaten that way or baked as corn bread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/agriculture-american-indians? |work=Answers.com |title=American Indian Agriculture |accessdate=February 8, 2008}}</ref>

===Religion===
{{Further|Native American religion}}

[[File:Baptism of Pocahontas.jpg|thumb|right|Baptism of [[Pocahontas]] was painted in 1840. John Gadsby Chapman depicts Pocahontas, wearing white, being baptized Rebecca by Anglican minister Alexander Whiteaker in Jamestown, Virginia; this event is believed to have taken place in 1613 or 1614.]]

Traditional Native American ceremonies are still practiced by many tribes and bands, and the older theological belief systems are still held by many of the "traditional" people.{{Specify|date=July 2009}} These [[spirituality|spiritualities]] may accompany adherence to another faith, or can represent a person's primary religious identity. While much Native American spiritualism exists in a tribal-cultural continuum, and as such cannot be easily separated from tribal identity itself, certain other more clearly defined movements have arisen among "traditional" Native American practitioners, these being identifiable as "religions" in the clinical sense. Traditional practices of some tribes include the use of sacred herbs such as tobacco, [[Hierochloe odorata|sweetgrass]] or [[Leucophyllum|sage]]. Many Plains tribes have [[sweatlodge]] ceremonies, though the specifics of the ceremony vary among tribes. Fasting, singing and prayer in the ancient languages of their people, and sometimes [[Native American music|drumming]] are also common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Midewin|Midewiwin Lodge]] is a traditional medicine society inspired by the oral traditions and prophesies of the [[Ojibwa]] (Chippewa) and related tribes.

Another significant religious body among Native peoples is known as the [[Native American Church]]. It is a [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] church incorporating elements of Native spiritual practice from a number of different tribes as well as symbolic elements from [[Christianity]]. Its main rite is the [[peyote]] ceremony. Prior to 1890, traditional religious beliefs included [[Wakan Tanka]]. In the American Southwest, especially [[New Mexico]], a syncretism between the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] brought by Spanish missionaries and the native religion is common; the religious drums, chants, and dances of the [[Pueblo people]] are regularly part of [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]'s [[Saint Francis Cathedral]].<ref>[http://www.csp.org/communities/docs/fikes-nac_history.html A Brief History of the Native American Church] by Jay Fikes. Retrieved February 22, 2006.</ref> Native American-Catholic syncretism is also found elsewhere in the United States. (e.g., the National [[Kateri Tekakwitha]] Shrine in [[Fonda, New York]] and the [[National Shrine of the North American Martyrs]] in [[Auriesville, New York]]).

The [[eagle feather law]] (Title 50 Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations) stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain [[eagle]] feathers for [[religious]] or spiritual use. The law does not allow Native Americans to give [[eagle]] feathers to non-Native Americans.

===Gender roles===
{{Main|Gender roles in First Nations and Native American tribes}}

[[File:Doctor.susan.la.flesche.picotte.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dr. [[Susan La Flesche Picotte]] was the first Native American woman to become a [[physician]] in the [[United States]].]]

Gender roles were differentiated in most Native American tribes, and both had power in decisionmaking within the tribe. Many tribes, such as the [[Haudenosaunee]] Five Nations and the Southeast Muskogean tribes, had [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] systems, in which property and hereditary leadership were controlled by and passed through the maternal lines. The children were considered to belong to the mother's clan and achieved status within it. When the tribe adopted war captives, the children became part of their mother's clan and accepted in the tribe. In Cherokee and other matrilineal cultures, wives owned the family property. When young women married, their husbands joined them in their mother's household. This enabled the young women to have assistance for childbirth and rearing; it also protected her in case of conflicts between the couple. If they separated or the man was killed at war, the woman had her family to assist her. In addition, in matrilineal culture, the mother's brother was the leading male figure in a male child's life, as he mentored the child within the mother's clan.

The husband had no standing in his wife's and children's clan, as he belonged to his own mother's clan. Hereditary clan chief positions passed through the mother's line, not the father's. Chiefs were selected on recommendation of women elders, who also could disapprove of a chief. There were sometimes hereditary roles for men called peace chiefs, but war chiefs were selected based on proven prowess in battle. Men usually had the roles of hunting, waging war, and negotiating with other tribes, including the Europeans after their arrival.

Others were [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], although several [[Kinship and descent|different systems]] were in use.  In the [[patrilineal]] tribes, such as the [[Omaha]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and [[Ponca]], hereditary leadership passed through the male line, and children were considered to belong to the father and his [[clan]]. For this reason, when Europeans or American men took wives from such tribes, their children were considered "white" like their fathers, or "[[mixed race|half-breeds]]".  Generally such children could have no official place in the tribe because their fathers did not belong to it, unless they were adopted by a male and made part of his family.<ref name="TrueLogan">[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/collections/vol19/v19p064.htm  Melvin Randolph Gilmore, "The True Logan Fontenelle"], ''Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society,'' Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, p. 64, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011</ref>

Men hunted, traded and made war. The women had primary responsibility for the survival and welfare of the families (and future of the tribe); they gathered and cultivated plants, used plants and herbs to treat illnesses, cared for the young and the elderly, made all the clothing and instruments, and processed and cured meat and skins from the game. They tanned hides to make clothing as well as bags, saddle cloths, and tepee covers. Mothers used [[cradleboard]]s to carry an infant while working or traveling.<ref>[http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20030302141755/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_013100_gender.htm [[Beatrice Medicine]], "Gender"], ''Encyclopedia of North American Indians,'' 9 February 2006.</ref> 

At least several dozen tribes allowed [[polygyny]] to sisters, with procedural and economic limits.<ref name="Morgan1907"/>

Apart from making homes, women had many additional tasks that were also essential for the survival of the tribes. They made weapons and tools, took care of the roofs of their homes and often helped their men hunt [[American bison|bison]].<ref>[http://www.indians.org/articles/native-american-women.html "Native American Women"], Indians.org.

===Sports===
Native American leisure time led to competitive individual and team sports. [[Jim Thorpe]], [[Notah Begay III]], [[Jacoby Ellsbury]], and [[Billy Mills]] are well known professional athletes.

====Team based====
[[File:Ball players.jpg|thumb|Ball players from the [[Choctaw]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe as painted by [[George Catlin]] in the 1830s]]

Native American ball sports, sometimes referred to as [[lacrosse]], stickball, or baggataway, was often used to settle disputes; rather than going to war which was a civil way to settle potential conflict. The [[Choctaw]] called it ISITOBOLI ("Little Brother of War");<ref name="choctaw_stickball">

</ref> The game is played with one or two rackets/sticks and one ball. The object of the game is to land the ball on the opposing team's goal (either a single post or net) to score and to prevent the opposing team from scoring on your goal. The game involves as few as twenty or as many as 300 players with no height or weight restrictions and no protective gear. The goals could be from around {{convert|200|ft}} apart to about {{convert|2|mi}}; in Lacrosse the field is {{convert|110|yd}}. A Jesuit priest{{Who|date=August 2009}} referenced stickball in 1729, and George Catlin painted the subject.

====Individual based====
[[Chunkey]] was a game that consisted of a stone shaped disk that was about 1<U+2013>2&nbsp;inches in diameter. The disk was thrown down a {{convert|200|ft|m|sing=on}} corridor so that it could roll past the players at great speed. The disk would roll down the corridor, and players would throw wooden shafts at the moving disk. The object of the game was to strike the disk or prevent your opponents from hitting it.

====U.S. Olympics====
[[File:Jim Thorpe at desk.jpg|thumb|[[Jim Thorpe]] was called the "greatest athlete in the world" by king [[Gustaf V of Sweden]]]]
[[File:BillyMills Crossing Finish Line 1964Olympics.jpg|thumb|right|[[Billy Mills]] crosses the finish line for the 10,000 meter race at the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Tokyo Olympics]]]]
[[Jim Thorpe]], a [[Sauk and Fox]] Native American, was an all-round athlete playing football and baseball in the early 20th century. Future President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] injured his knee while trying to tackle the young Thorpe. In a 1961 speech, Eisenhower recalled Thorpe: "Here and there, there are some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and he could do anything better than any other football player I ever saw."<ref name="CNN">Botelho, Greg.

[[Billy Mills]], a [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] officer, won the gold medal in the 10,000 meter run at the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Tokyo Olympics]]. He was the only American ever to win the Olympic gold in this event. An unknown prior to the Olympics, Mills finished second in the U.S. Olympic trials.

[[Billy Kidd]], part [[Abenaki]] from [[Vermont]], became the first American male to medal in [[alpine skiing]] in the Olympics, taking silver at age 20 in the [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] in the [[Alpine skiing at the 1964 Winter Olympics|1964 Winter Olympics]] at [[Innsbruck, Austria|Innsbruck]], [[Austria]].<br>Six years later at the 1970 World Championships, Kidd won the gold medal in the [[Alpine skiing combined|combined]] event and took the bronze medal in the slalom.

===Music and art===
{{Main|Native American music|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
[[File:Jake fragua jemez pueblo.jpg|thumb|upright|Jake Fragua, [[Jemez Pueblo]] from [[New Mexico]]]]
Traditional [[Native American music]] is almost entirely [[Texture (music)|monophonic]], but there are notable exceptions. Native American music often includes [[drum]]ming and/or the playing of rattles or other percussion instruments but little other instrumentation. [[Native American flute|Flutes]] and whistles made of wood, cane, or bone are also played, generally by individuals, but in former times also by large ensembles (as noted by Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|de Soto]]). The tuning of modern flutes is typically [[pentatonic]].

Performers with Native American parentage have occasionally appeared in American popular music, such as [[Robbie Robertson]] (The Band), [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], [[Tori Amos]], [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]], and [[CocoRosie]]. Some, such as [[John Trudell]], have used music to comment on life in Native America, and others, such as [[R. Carlos Nakai]] integrate traditional sounds with modern sounds in instrumental recordings. A variety of small and medium-sized recording companies offer an abundance of recent music by Native American performers young and old, ranging from pow-wow drum music to hard-driving rock-and-roll and rap.

The most widely practiced public musical form among Native Americans in the United States is that of the pow-wow. At [[pow-wow]]s, such as the annual [[Gathering of Nations]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], members of drum groups sit in a circle around a large drum. Drum groups play in unison while they sing in a native language and dancers in colorful regalia dance clockwise around the drum groups in the center. Familiar pow-wow songs include honor songs, intertribal songs, crow-hops, sneak-up songs, grass-dances, two-steps, welcome songs, going-home songs, and war songs. Most indigenous communities in the United States also maintain traditional songs and ceremonies, some of which are shared and practiced exclusively within the community.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Bierhosrt, John |title=A Cry from the Earth: Music of North American Indians |publisher=Ancient City Press |year=1992}}</ref>

Native American art comprises a major category in the world art collection. Native American contributions include [[Native American pottery|pottery]], [[painting]]s, [[jewellery]], [[weaving]]s, [[sculpture]], [[basketry]], and [[wood carving|carvings]]. [[Franklin Gritts]] was a Cherokee artist who taught students from many tribes at Haskell Institute (now [[Haskell Indian Nations University]]) in the 1940s, the ''Golden Age'' of Native American painters. The integrity of certain Native American artworks is protected by an act of Congress that prohibits representation of art as Native American when it is not the product of an enrolled Native American artist.

===Economy===
The [[Inuit]], or [[Eskimo]], prepared and buried large amounts of dried meat and fish. [[Pacific Northwest]] tribes crafted seafaring dugouts {{convert|40|<U+2013>|50|ft}} long for fishing. Farmers in the Eastern Woodlands tended fields of maize with hoes and digging sticks, while their neighbors in the Southeast grew tobacco as well as food crops. On the Plains, some tribes engaged in agriculture but also planned buffalo hunts in which herds were driven over bluffs. Dwellers of the Southwest deserts hunted small animals and gathered acorns to grind into flour with which they baked wafer-thin bread on top of heated stones. Some groups on the region's mesas developed irrigation techniques, and filled storehouses with grain as protection against the area's frequent [[droughts]].

In the early years, as these native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade, they exchanged food, crafts, and furs for blankets, iron and steel implements, horses, trinkets, firearms, and alcoholic beverages.

====Barriers to economic development====
[[File:The King of the Seas in the Hands of the Makahs - 1910.jpg|thumb|"The King of the Seas in the Hands of the Makahs," photograph taken in 1910 of [[Makah people|Makah]] Native Americans]]
Today, other than tribes successfully running casinos, many tribes struggle, as they are often located on reservations isolated from the main economic centers of the country. The estimated 2.1 million Native Americans are the most impoverished of all ethnic groups. According to the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], an estimated 400,000 Native Americans reside on reservation land. While some tribes have had success with gaming, only 40% of the 562 federally recognized tribes operate [[casino]]s.<ref name="NIGA">{{cite web |url=http://www.indiangaming.org/library/indian-gaming-facts/index.shtml |title=NIGA: Indian Gaming Facts}}</ref> According to a 2007 survey by the [[U.S. Small Business Administration]], only 1% of Native Americans own and operate a business.<ref name="SBA">{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/December/20071221175918ABretnuH0.3369257.html|title=Number of U.S. [[minority group|Minority]] Owned Businesses Increasing}}</ref> Native Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every social statistic: highest teen suicide rate of all minorities at 18.5 per 100,000, highest rate of teen pregnancy, highest high school drop-out rate at 54%, lowest [[per capita income]], and [[unemployment]] rates between 50% to 90%.

The barriers to [[economic development]] on Native American reservations have been identified by [[Joseph Kalt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hpaied/people/kalt.htm |title=Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development |accessdate=2008-06-17 |last=Kalt |first=Joseph}}</ref> and [[Stephen Cornell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://udallcenter.arizona.edu/staff/scornell.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080619015224/http://udallcenter.arizona.edu/staff/scornell.html|archivedate=2008-06-19 |title=Co-director, Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development |accessdate=2008-06-17 |last=Cornell |first=Stephen}}</ref> of the [[Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development]] at [[Harvard University]], in their report: ''What Can Tribes Do?

Strategies and Institutions in American Indian Economic Development|accessdate=2008-06-17 |last=Cornell, S. |first=Kalt, J.}}</ref> are summarized as follows:

*Lack of access to capital.
*Lack of human capital (education, skills, technical expertise) and the means to develop it.
*Reservations lack effective planning.
*Reservations are poor in natural resources.
*Reservations have natural resources, but lack sufficient control over them.
*Reservations are disadvantaged by their distance from markets and the high costs of transportation.[[File:(Teacher with picture cards giving English instruction to Navajo day school students.) - NARA - 295158.tif|thumb|Teacher with picture cards giving English instruction to Navajo day school students]]
*Tribes cannot persuade investors to locate on reservations because of intense competition from non-Native American communities.
*The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] is inept, corrupt, and/or uninterested in reservation development.
*Tribal politicians and bureaucrats are inept or corrupt.
*On-reservation factionalism destroys stability in tribal decisions.
*The instability of tribal government keeps outsiders from investing. (Many tribes adopted constitutions by the 1934 [[Indian Reorganization Act]] model, with two-year terms for elected positions of chief and council members deemed too short by the authors for getting things done)
*Entrepreneurial skills and experience are scarce.
*Tribal cultures get in the way.

A major barrier to development is the lack of entrepreneurial knowledge and experience within [[Indian reservations]]. "A general lack of education and experience about business is a significant challenge to prospective entrepreneurs," was the report on Native American [[entrepreneurship]] by the [[Northwest Area Foundation]] in 2004. "Native American communities that lack entrepreneurial traditions and recent experiences typically do not provide the support that entrepreneurs need to thrive. Consequently, experiential entrepreneurship education needs to be embedded into school curricula and after-school and other community activities. This would allow students to learn the essential elements of entrepreneurship from a young age and encourage them to apply these elements throughout life.".<ref name="CFED">{{cite web |url=http://www.energizingentrepreneurs.org/content/cr.php?id=4&sel=5 |title=Native Entrepreneurship: Challenges and opportunities for rural communities&nbsp;<U+2014> CFED, Northwest Area Foundation December 2004}}</ref> ''[[Rez Biz]]'' magazine addresses these issues.

European impact was immediate, widespread, and profound<U+2014>more than any other race that had contact with Native Americans during the early years of colonization and nationhood.

</ref> Marriages took place in English, Spanish, and French colonies between Native Americans and Europeans. Given the preponderance of men among the colonists in the early years, generally European men married American Indian women.  In 1528, [[Isabel Moctezuma|Isabel de Moctezuma]], an heir of [[Moctezuma II]], was married to Alonso de Grado, a Spanish Conquistador. After his death, the widow married [[Juan Cano de Saavedra]]. Together they had five children. Many heirs of Emperor [[Moctezuma II]] were acknowledged by the Spanish crown, who granted them titles including [[Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo]].

On April 5, 1614, [[Pocahontas]] married the Englishman [[John Rolfe]]. They had a child called [[Thomas Rolfe]]. Intimate relations among Native American and Europeans were widespread, beginning with the French and Spanish explorers and trappers. For instance, in the early 19th century, the Native American woman [[Sacagawea]], who would help translate for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], was married to the French-Canadian trapper [[Toussaint Charbonneau]]. They had a son named [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]]. This was the most typical pattern among the traders and trappers.

There was fear on both sides, as the different peoples realized how different their societies were.<ref name="white_red_relations1"/> The whites regarded the Indians as "savage" because they were not Christian. They were suspicious of cultures which they did not understand.<ref name="white_red_relations1"/> The Native American author, Andrew J. Blackbird, wrote in his ''History of the [[Ottawa]] and [[Chippewa]] Indians of Michigan,'' (1897), that white settlers introduced some immoralities into Native American tribes. Many Indians suffered because the Europeans introduced alcohol and the whiskey trade resulted in alcoholism among the people, who were [[Alcohol tolerance#Alcohol tolerance in different ethnic groups|alcohol-intolerant]].<ref name="white_red_relations1"/>

Blackbird wrote:
<blockquote>
"The Ottawas and Chippewas were quite virtuous in their primitive state, as there were no illegitimate children reported in our old traditions. But very lately this evil came to exist among the Ottawas-so lately that the second case among the Ottawas of 'Arbor Croche' is yet living in 1897.

As European-American women started working independently at missions and Indian schools in the western states, there were more opportunities for their meeting and developing relationships with Native American men. For instance, [[Charles Eastman]], a man of European and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] descent whose father sent both his sons to [[Dartmouth College]], got his medical degree at [[Boston University]] and returned to the West to practice. He married [[Elaine Goodale]], whom he met in South Dakota. He was the grandson of [[Seth Eastman]], a military officer from Maine, and a chief's daughter. Goodale was a young European-American teacher from Massachusetts and a reformer, who was appointed as the US superintendent of Native American education for the reservations in the Dakota Territory. They had six children together.

====European enslavement====

When Europeans arrived as [[colonists]] in North America, Native Americans changed their practice of [[slavery]] dramatically.  Native Americans began selling war captives to whites rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor in the [[West Indies]] grew with the cultivation of [[sugar cane]], Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and some were exported to the "sugar islands." The British settlers, especially those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo.  Accurate records of the numbers enslaved do not exist. Scholars estimate tens of thousands of Native Americans may have been enslaved by the Europeans, being sold by Native Americans themselves.

Slavery became a caste of people who were foreign to the English (Native Americans, Africans and their descendants) and non-Christians.  The Virginia General Assembly defined some terms of slavery in 1705:
{{quote|All servants imported and brought into the Country... who were not Christians in their native Country... shall be accounted and be slaves. All Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves within this dominion ... shall be held to be real estate. If any slave resists his master ... correcting such slave, and shall happen to be killed in such correction ... the master shall be free of all punishment ... as if such accident never happened.|Virginia General Assembly declaration, 1705<ref name="pbsafna">{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr3.html |title=The Terrible Transformation:From Indentured Servitude to Racial Slavery |accessdate=2010-01-07 |year=2009 |publisher=PBS}}</ref>}}

The slave trade of Native Americans lasted only until around 1730.  It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including the [[Yamasee War]]. The [[Indian Wars]] of the early 18th century, combined with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country.  The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies.  The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the [[Choctaw]], the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], and the [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] for protection.

Native American women were at risk for rape whether they were enslaved or not; during the early colonial years, settlers were disproportionately male.  They turned to Native women for sexual relationships.<ref name="udayu">{{cite web |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/05intersection/Gender/rape.htm|title="The Realities of Enslaved Female Africans in America", excerpted from ''Failing Our Black Children: Statutory Rape Laws, Moral Reform and the Hypocrisy of Denial'' |author=Gloria J.

====Traditions of Native American slavery====

The majority of Native American tribes did practice some form of slavery before the European introduction of African slavery into North America, but none exploited slave labor on a large scale. In addition, Native Americans did not buy and sell captives in the pre-colonial era, although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for their own members.<ref name="amslav">{{cite web |url=http://mmslibrary.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/slavery-and-native-americans-in-british-north-america-and-the-united-states.pdf |title=Slavery and Native Americans in British North America and the United States: 1600 to 1865 |author= Tony Seybert |accessdate=2009-06-20 |year=2009 |publisher=}}</ref>

The conditions of enslaved Native Americans varied among the tribes. In many cases, young enslaved captives were adopted into the tribes to replace warriors killed during warfare or by disease. Other tribes practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes; but, this status was only temporary as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society.<ref name="amslav"/>

"Native Americans, during the transitional period of Africans becoming the primary race enslaved, were enslaved at the same time and shared a common experience of enslavement.

While numerous tribes used captive enemies as servants and slaves, they also often adopted younger captives into their tribes to replace members who had died. In the Southeast, a few Native American tribes began to adopt a slavery system similar to that of the American colonists, buying African American slaves, especially the [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]]. Though less than 3% of Native Americans owned slaves, divisions grew among the Native Americans over slavery.<ref name="wil">

}}</ref> Native Americans in the South shared some experiences with Africans, especially during the period, primarily in the 17th century, when both were enslaved. The colonists along the Atlantic Coast had begun enslaving Native Americans to ensure a source of labor. At one time the slave trade was so extensive that it caused increasing tensions with the various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes, as well as the [[Iroquois]].  Based in New York and Pennsylvania, they had threatened to attack colonists on behalf of the related [[Iroquoian]] [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] before they migrated out of the South in the early 1700s.<ref name="afrna">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/ethnography/aah/aaheritage/lowCountry_furthRdg1.htm |title=African American Heritage and Ethnography: Work, Marriage, Christianity |author=National Park Service |date=2009-05-30 |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>

In the 1790s, [[Benjamin Hawkins]] was assigned as the US agent to the southeastern tribes, who became known as the Five Civilized Tribes for their adoption of numerous Anglo-European practices.  He advised the tribes to take up slaveholding to aid them in European-style farming and plantations. He thought their traditional form of slavery, which had looser conditions, was less efficient than [[chattel]] slavery.<ref name="afch">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xpusu6xQq6QC&pg=PA33&dq=afro+cherokee+smallpox&lr=#v=onepage&q=afro%20cherokee%20smallpox&f=false |title=Ties That Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom |author=Tiya Miles |accessdate=2009-10-27 |year=2008 |publisher=University of California Press }}</ref> In the nineteenth century, some members of these tribes who were more closely associated with settlers, began to purchase African-American slaves for workers. They adopted some European-American ways to benefit their people. 

The writer William Loren Katz contends that Native Americans treated their slaves better than did the typical European American in the [[Deep South]].<ref name="wil">{{cite web |url=http://www.williamlkatz.com/Essays/History/AfricansIndians.php |title=Africans and Indians: Only in America|author=William Loren Katz |accessdate=2008-09-20 |year=2008 |publisher=William Loren Katz}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> Though less than 3% of Native Americans owned slaves, bondage created destructive cleavages among those who were slaveholders.

Among the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], mixed-race slaveholders were generally part of an elite hierarchy, often based on their mothers' clan status, as the societies had [[matrilineal]] systems. As did Benjamin Hawkins, European fur traders and colonial officials tended to marry high-status women, in strategic alliances seen to benefit both sides. The Choctaw, Creek and Cherokee believed they benefited from stronger alliances with the traders and their societies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The women's sons gained their status from their mother's families; they were part of hereditary leadership lines who exercised power and accumulated personal wealth in their changing Native American societies. The historian Greg O'Brien calls them the Creole generation to show that they were part of a changing society.{{Citation needed|not sure this is helpful|date=October 2011}} The chiefs of the tribes believed that some of the new generation of mixed-race, bilingual chiefs would lead their people into the future and be better able to adapt to new conditions influenced by European Americans.<ref name="wil"/> Proposals for [[Indian Removal]] heightened the tensions of cultural changes, due to the increase in the number of [[mixed-race]] Native Americans in the South. Full bloods, who tended to live in areas less affected by colonial encroachment, generally worked to maintain traditional ways, including control of communal lands. While the traditional members often resented the sale of tribal lands to Anglo-Americans, by the 1830s they agreed it was not possible to go to war with the colonists on this issue.

===Who are Native Americans===

====Admixture and genetics====
[[File:Creeks in Oklahoma.png|thumb|Members of the Creek (Muscogee) Nation in [[Oklahoma]] around 1877; they include men with some European and African ancestry.<ref>Charles Hudson, ''The Southeastern Indians'', 1976, p. 479.</ref>]]
Intertribal mixing was common among Native American tribes, so individuals often had ancestry from more than one tribe, particularly after tribes lost so many members from disease.<ref name="accessgenealogy1"/><ref name="uwec1"/> Bands or entire tribes occasionally split or merged to form more viable groups in reaction to the pressures of climate, disease and warfare.<ref name="eurekalert.org">[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-07/uoia-ycs071508.php "Y chromosome study sheds light on Athapaskan migration to southwest US"], ''Eureka Alert'', Department of Energy Public Newslist</ref> A number of tribes traditionally adopted [[prisoners of war|captives]] into their group to replace members who had been captured or killed in battle. These captives were from rival tribes and later from European settlements. Some tribes also sheltered or adopted white traders and runaway slaves, and others owned slaves of their own. Tribes with long trading histories with Europeans show a higher rate of European admixture, reflecting years of intermarriage between European men and Native American women.<ref name="eurekalert.org"/> A number of paths to genetic and ethnic diversity among Native Americans existed.

In recent years, genetic genealogists have been able to determine the proportion of Native American ancestry carried by the African-American population. The literary and history scholar [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] had experts on his TV programs about African-American ancestry. They stated that 5% of African Americans have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry. A greater percentage could have a smaller proportion of Indian ancestry, but their conclusions show that popular estimates of admixture may have been too high.<ref>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past'', New York: Crown Publishers, 2009, pp. 20<U+2013>21.</ref>

DNA testing is not sufficient to qualify a person for specific tribal membership as it cannot distinguish among Native American groups.

Native American identity has historically been based on culture, not just biology, as many American Indian peoples adopted captives from their enemies and assimilated them into their tribes. The Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism (IPCB) notes that:<blockquote>"Native American markers" are not found solely among Native Americans. While they occur more frequently among Native Americans, they are also found in people in other parts of the world.<ref name="bldl2">{{cite web |url=http://www.weyanoke.org/historyculture/hc-DNAandIndianAncestry.html |title=Can DNA Determine Who is American Indian?

Geneticists state:<blockquote>Not all Native Americans have been tested; especially with the large number of deaths due to disease such as small pox, it is unlikely that Native Americans only have the genetic markers they have identified, even when their maternal or paternal bloodline does not include a non-Native American.<ref name="hur"/><ref name="bldl1"/></blockquote>

====Tribal Classifications====

To receive tribal services, a Native American must belong to, and be certified by, a recognized tribal organization. Each tribal government makes its own rules for eligibility of citizens or tribal members. The federal government has standards related to services available to certified Native Americans. For instance, federal scholarships for Native Americans require the student to be enrolled in a federally recognized tribe and have at least one-quarter Native American descent (equivalent to one grandparent), attested to by a [[Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood]] (CDIB) card. Among tribes, qualification may be based upon a required percentage of Native American "blood" (or the "[[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]]") of an individual seeking recognition, or documented descent from an ancestor on the [[Dawes Rolls]] or other registers.

Some tribes have begun requiring [[genealogical DNA test]]ing, but this is usually related to an individual's proving parentage or direct descent from a certified member.<ref>[http://www.racesci.org/racescinow/genetics,race,and%20ancestry/5.html Karen Kaplan, "Ancestry in a Drop of Blood"], Race Science Now (August 30, 2005), Retrieved February 20, 2006.</ref> Requirements for tribal membership vary widely by tribe. The Cherokee require documented genealogical descent from a Native American listed on the early 1906 [[Dawes Rolls]]. Tribal rules regarding recognition of members who have heritage from multiple tribes are equally diverse and complex.

Tribal membership conflicts have led to a number of legal disputes, court cases, and the formation of activist groups. One example of this are the [[Cherokee Freedmen]]. Today, they include descendants of African Americans once enslaved by the Cherokees, who were granted, by federal treaty, citizenship in the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|historic Cherokee Nation]] as freedmen after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[Cherokee Nation|modern Cherokee Nation]], in the early 1980s, excluded them from citizenship, unless individuals can prove descent from a Cherokee Native American (not Cherokee Freedmen) listed on the Dawes Rolls.

====Increased self-identification====
Since the census of 2000, people who have, or believe they have, Native American ancestry may designate themselves, for census purposes, as being of more than one race.<ref name="2010 Census AMAN" /> Since the 1960s the number of people claiming Native American ancestry has grown significantly and by the 2000 census the number had more than doubled.  Sociologists attribute this dramatic change to "ethnic shifting" or "ethnic shopping" and reflects a willingness of people to question their birth identities and adopt new ethnicities that they are more compatible with. Author [[Jack Hitt]] writes:

{{quote|The reaction from lifelong Indians runs the gamut. It is easy to find Native Americans who denounce many of these new Indians as members of the wannabe tribe. But it is also easy to find Indians like Clem Iron Wing, an elder among the Sioux, who sees this flood of new ethnic claims as magnificent, a surge of Indians ''trying to come home.'' Those Indians who ridicule Iron Wing's lax sense of tribal membership have retrofitted the old genocidal system of blood quantum -- measuring racial purity by blood -- into the new standard for real Indianness, a choice rich with paradox.<ref name="Newest Indians">{{cite news|title=The Newest Indians|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F17FD3A580C728EDDA10894DD404482|accessdate=June 2, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times Magazine|date=August 21, 2005|author=Jack Hitt}}</ref>}} 

Journalist Mary Annette Pember notes that wanting to belong to the Native American culture may be a result of increased interest in genealogy, the romanticization of the lifestyle, and a family tradition of believing that somewhere there were Native American ancestors.  Problems is classification are compounded by different qualifications for tribal membership by different tribes, a fear of registering with a tribe because it is seen as a method of control initiated by the federal government, and the problem of individuals who are of 100% Native American background who, because of their mixed tribal heritage, do not qualify to belong to any individual tribe. Pember concludes:

{{quote|The subjects of genuine American Indian blood, cultural connection and recognition by the community are extremely contentious issues, hotly debated throughout Indian country and beyond. The whole situation, some say, is ripe for misinterpretation, confusion and, ultimately, exploitation.}}

In addition, 2.3 million people, or another 0.7 percent, reported American Indian and Alaska Native in combination with one or more other races. Together, these two groups totaled 5.2 million people. Thus, 1.7 percent of all people in the United States identified as American Indian and Alaska Native, either alone or in combination with one or more other races.<ref name="2010 Census AMAN" />

The definition of American Indian or Alaska Native used in the 2010 census:<blockquote>According to Office of Management and Budget, <U+201C>American Indian or Alaska Native<U+201D> refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.<ref name="2010 Census AMAN">{{cite web|title=The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-10.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census|accessdate=June 2, 2010|coauthors=Tina Norris, Paula L.

78% of Native Americans live outside a reservation. Full blood individuals are more likely to live on a reservation than mixed blood individuals. The Navajo, with 286,000 full blood individuals, is the largest tribe if only full-blood individuals are counted; the Navajo are the tribe with the highest proportion of full blood individuals, 86.3%. The Cherokee, the largest tribe with 819,000 individuals, has only 284,000 full blood individuals.<ref name=Navajo2010>{{cite news|title=Census: Native count jumps by 27 percent|url=http://navajotimes.com/news/2012/0112/012612census.php|accessdate=June 2, 2012|newspaper=The Navajo Times|date=Jan. 26, 2012|author=Cindy Yurth|agency=Ts<U+00E9>;yi' Bureau}}</ref>

[[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] primarily focus on [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups]] and [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups]]. "Y-DNA" is passed solely along the [[patrilineal]] line, from father to son, while "mtDNA" is passed down the [[matrilineal]] line, from mother to offspring of both sexes. Neither [[Genetic recombination|recombines]], and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutation at each generation with no intermixture between parents' genetic material.<ref name="nomenclature">{{cite journal |year=2002 |title=A Nomenclature System for the Tree of Human Y-Chromosomal Binary Haplogroups |pages=339<U+2013>348 |volume=12|issue=2|doi=10.1101/gr.217602 |last1=Consortium |first1=T.
