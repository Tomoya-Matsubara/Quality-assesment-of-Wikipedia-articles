'''King's Highway 410''', also known as '''Highway 410''' and colloquially as '''the four-ten''', is a [[400-series highways|400-series highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]] that connects Highways [[Ontario Highway 401|401]] and [[Ontario Highway 403|403]] to [[Brampton]]. North of Brampton, the [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]] connects to [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway&nbsp;10]], which continues north through [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]] as a four lane [[arterial road]]. The route is patrolled by the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] and has a speed limit of {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}}.

Highway&nbsp;410 was built along the [[right-of-way (transportation)|alignment]] of Heart Lake Road south of Boivard Drive, while north of Boivard Drive it was built along a new alignment. The highway was designated in 1978 between Highway&nbsp;401 and Boivard Drive (later [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway&nbsp;7]]), though it was only two lanes wide and did not feature any [[interchange (road)|interchanges]]. It was widened throughout the 1980s and completed as a freeway in 1991. In 2003, construction began on a northward extension of the freeway that was completed in late 2009.

A notable feature of Highway 410 is the four-level interchange with Highways 401 and 403 which includes a large [[flyover (overpass)|flyover]] ramp from Highway 401 eastbound to Highway 410 northbound, constructed in 1990. The entire freeway features a grass median as opposed to an [[Ontario Tall Wall]] like neighbouring freeways.

== Route description ==
[[File:Courtney Park and 410.JPG|thumb|left|The 410 and Courtneypark Drive]]
Highway 410 is a commuter freeway and a bypass of Brampton, acting as the southward continuation of [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway 10]]. The highway is also a continuation of Highway 403 from the south, which ends at the 401. The freeway begins as several ramps converge from Highway 401 north of the large interchange.<ref name="GHmap">{{cite map

Maintaining a straight north-westward course, it passes beneath Courtney Park Drive and Derry Road, with a slight jog to the right between the two underpasses. The freeway then intersects [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] as it crosses into Brampton and passes beneath an electrical corridor. Veering to the right once again, the freeway enters a second industrialized area and returns to its northwest&ndash;southeast orientation. It passes beneath [[Steeles Avenue]] and later Queen Street East, the former [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]], now [[Peel Regional Road 107]]. Until it was decommissioned across the [[Greater Toronto Area]], Highway&nbsp;7 was [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] between Queen Street East and Boivard Drive. Passing north of Queen Street, the highway exits the industrial area and enters residential subdivisions.<ref name="GHmap" />

Throughout this section, Highway 410 is located within a [[Cutting (transportation)|cutting]] below grade. It passes beneath several roads until Bovaird Drive. The recently completed extension begins at this point,<ref name="extmto" /> as Highway 410 passes to the west of [[Trinity Common]] and diverges from its straight path into [[Natural environment|greenspace]] and alongside the [[Heart Lake Conservation Area]].<ref>{{cite news

After rising back to level ground, it curves north, passing beneath Valleywood Drive. The central concrete median and high-mast lighting end as the freeway becomes Highway 10, which continues north as a four-lane undivided road to [[Orangeville, Ontario|Orangeville]], [[Shelburne, Ontario|Shelburne]] and eventually [[Owen Sound]].<ref name="2010 mapart">{{cite map

[[File:Highway 401 interchange with 403-410 in 1987.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A complicated freeway interchange|Until 1990, Highway 410 did not connect with Highway 403, and existed as a [[Super two]] north of Highway 401]]
Planning for highway 410 began during the late 1960s as a result of the rapid suburbanization of Brampton. On May&nbsp;25, 1965, the Department of Highways (DHO) unveiled the Toronto Region Western Section Highway Planning Study. The plan designated several new highway corridors and widening projects through Peel and [[Regional Municipality of Halton|Halton]], including Highway&nbsp;10.<ref>{{cite news

However, it did not include a truck bypass that was desired by Brampton city council. In 1969, [[William H. Brydon]] would encourage the DHO to construct this bypass utilizing Heart Lake Road, and announced the plans at his final city council meeting as mayor, claiming that it may be known as the Brampton Expressway and would connect with Highway&nbsp;401.<ref>{{cite news

Prior to the construction of Highway&nbsp;410, Heart Lake Road was flanked by the industrial lands of Brampton and [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalae]] north of Steeles Avenue. Between Steeles and Highway&nbsp;401 was agricultural lands.<ref name="BramptonExpressway" /> In 1975, construction began on the widening of Highway&nbsp;401 between Highway&nbsp;10 (Hurontario Street) and Highway&nbsp;427. During this expansion from six to eight lanes, a directional and loop ramp were constructed at Heart Lake Road to allow access to and from Toronto.<ref>{{cite news
