'''''Up in the Air''''' is a 2009 American [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] directed by [[Jason Reitman]] and co-written by Reitman and [[Sheldon Turner]]. It is a film adaptation of the 2001 [[Up in the Air (novel)|novel of the same name]], written by [[Walter Kirn]]. The story is about a corporate [[downsize]]r Ryan Bingham ([[George Clooney]]) and his travels. The film follows his isolated life and philosophies along with the people he meets along the way. Filming was primarily in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which substituted for a number of other cities shown in the film. Several scenes were also filmed in [[Detroit, Michigan]], [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and [[Miami, Florida]].

Reitman heavily promoted ''Up in the Air'' with personal appearances during film festivals and other showings, starting with the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 5, 2009. The Los Angeles premiere was at the [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Mann Village Theater]] on Monday, November 30, 2009. [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] scheduled a limited North American release on December 4, 2009, broadening the release on December 11, 2009, with a wide release on December 23, 2009.

The [[National Board of Review]] and the [[Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association]] named ''Up in the Air'' the Best Picture of 2009. It received eight [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] nominations and garnered a win for Adapted Screenplay, six [[67th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nominations, earning a win for Best Screenplay, and three [[15th Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild]] nominations. It received six [[82nd Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, but did not win in any category. ''Up in the Air'' also received recognition from numerous critics' associations.

== Plot ==
Ryan Bingham ([[George Clooney]]) makes his living traveling to workplaces around the United States and breaking the news to workers that they have been let go for employers unwilling to do it themselves. Ryan also delivers motivational speeches, using the analogy "What's In Your Backpack?" to extol the virtues of a life free of burdens like relationships with people as well as things, arguing that the best way to live is to travel light, with little to hold you down.

Ryan relishes his perpetual travels. His personal ambition is to earn ten million [[frequent-flyer program|frequent flyer]] miles with [[American Airlines]]. While traveling, he meets another frequent flyer named Alex ([[Vera Farmiga]]). They begin a [[casual relationship]], meeting whenever they can arrange to cross paths.

Ryan is unexpectedly called back to his company's offices in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. An ambitious, freshly graduated new hire, Natalie Keener ([[Anna Kendrick]]) is promoting a plan to cut costs by conducting layoffs via [[video conference|videoconferencing]]. Ryan argues that Natalie knows nothing about the actual process, live or not, as she has never fired anyone and does not know how to handle upset people. He plays the role of a fired employee to show her inexperience. His boss ([[Jason Bateman]]) assigns him to take Natalie with him on his next round of terminations, much to his annoyance.

As they travel together and become better acquainted, Natalie questions Ryan's philosophy, but he is satisfied with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by [[text message]]. Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex in spite of their obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterwards they are ordered back to Omaha to begin implementing Natalie's program. There are problems during a test run; one laid off man breaks down in tears before the camera, and she is unable to comfort him.

Instead of returning immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex to accompany him to his younger sister Julie's ([[Melanie Lynskey]]) wedding near [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. He learns that the reason that Julie had him take photos of a cutout picture of her and future husband Jim ([[Danny McBride (actor)|Danny McBride]]) in various places is because they cannot afford a [[honeymoon]] trip. When Jim gets [[cold feet]], Ryan's older sister talks Ryan into using his motivational skills to persuade Jim to go through with it. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy of non-commitment, he persuades Jim that "everyone needs a co-pilot" and the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding takes place without any further problems.

Ryan begins having second thoughts about his own life. As he starts to deliver his "What's In Your Backpack?" speech at a convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], he realizes he no longer believes it and walks off the stage. On an impulse, he flies to Alex's home in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. When she opens the door, he is stunned to discover she is a married woman with children; Ryan leaves without saying a word. She later tells him on the phone that her family is her real life and he is simply an escape.

On his flight home, the crew announces that Ryan has just crossed the ten million mile mark. The airline's chief pilot ([[Sam Elliott]]) comes out of the cockpit to meet Ryan. He notes that Ryan is the youngest person to reach the milestone; Ryan, who had been awaiting that moment for a long time is speechless.

Back in his office, Ryan calls the airline to transfer five hundred thousand miles each to his sister, Julie, and brother-in-law, Jim Miller, enough for them to fly around the world for their honeymoon. His boss then tells Ryan that a woman he and Natalie fired has killed herself, and that an upset Natalie has quit via text message and left without another word. The company puts the remote-layoff program on hold because of government concerns and puts Ryan "back on the road".

Natalie applies for a job in [[San Francisco, California]]. The interviewer is impressed by her qualifications and a glowing recommendation from Ryan, and hires her. The film concludes with Ryan standing in front of a vast destination board, looking up, and letting go of his luggage, echoing a sentiment expressed by Natalie earlier.

==Themes==
The film has a thematic connection to the children's book ''[[The Velveteen Rabbit]]'', which appears in the film, before the wedding.<ref>{{cite news | last = Harper | first = J.

Reitman noted that
<blockquote>
In one sense, it's a movie about a man who fires people for a living. In another sense, it's a movie about a man who collects air miles excessively. In another sense, it's about a man who meets a woman who's so similar to him that even though they both believe in the idea of living solo, they begin to fall in love.<ref>{{cite news | last = Karger | first = Dave | title = Toronto preview: All eyes on 'Up in the Air' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = September 9, 2009 | url = http://oscar-watch.ew.com/2009/09/09/toronto-preview-all-eyes-on-up-in-the-air/ | accessdate = September 9, 2009 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

Reitman also later stated that "the movie is about the examination of a philosophy.

===Background===
[[Walter Kirn]] wrote ''[[Up in the Air (novel)|Up in the Air]]'', the book on which the film is based, during a snowbound winter on a ranch in rural [[Montana]], while thinking about airports, airplanes and first-class passengers he had met who would strongly resemble Ryan Bingham.<ref name="CB 2009-11-05">{{cite news | last = Nemiroff | first = Perri | title = Interview: Up In The Air's Jason Reitman, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick and Walter Kirn | work = [[Cinema Blend]] | date = November 5, 2009 | url = http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Up-In-The-Air-s-Jason-Reitman-Vera-Farmiga-Anna-Kendrick-and-Walter-Kirn-15568.html | accessdate = November 7, 2009 }}</ref> The novel was published in 2001 and, shortly after, [[Sheldon Turner]] discovered the book and wrote a screenplay adaptation, which he sold to [[DreamWorks]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/deal-central/column-post/air-holds-damage-control-screening-13493|title='Up in the Air' Holds a Damage-Control Screening|last=Pond|first=Steve|date=January 25, 2010|work=The Wrap|accessdate=August 3, 2010}}</ref>

[[Canadian-American]] filmmaker [[Jason Reitman]] later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] [[blurb]] on the cover) while browsing in the [[Los Angeles]] bookstore [[Book Soup]].<ref name="VR1118012459">{{cite news | last = D'Alessandro | first = Anthony | title = Reitman on origins of 'Air' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = December 9, 2009 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118012459.html | accessdate = December 9, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="wrap012510">{{cite news | last = Pond | first = Steve | title = 'Up in the Air' Holds a Damage-Control Screening | work = [[The Wrap]] | date = January 25, 2010 | url = http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/air-holds-damage-control-screening-13493 | accessdate = January 29, 2010}}</ref> Reitman persuaded his father, Canadian-American filmmaker [[Ivan Reitman]], to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from [[Ted Griffin]] and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turner's script in their own work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the original script that was (unbeknownst to Reitman) written by Turner. Some of Turner's inventions that were used in the final film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech ("Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now..."), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male).<ref name="wrap012510"/><ref name="LAT 2010-01-15">{{cite news | last = Zeitchik | first = Steven | title = Screenwriting credits, floating up in the air | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = January 15, 2010 | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/01/james-cameron-jason-reitman-anthony-minghella-avatar.html | accessdate = January 16, 2010 }}</ref> Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, and later admitted to being confused when the [[Writers Guild of America]] ruled that he should share credit with Turner, whose script Reitman claimed to have never read.

On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in ''[[Rocket Science (film)|Rocket Science]]''. On Clooney, he said, "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney.

While shooting the film in St. Louis and Detroit, Reitman placed an ad in the paper asking if people who recently lost their job wanted to be in a documentary about job loss. He specified "documentary" in the ad so actors would not respond to the ad. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it was for these people.<ref>{{cite news | last = McCollum | first = Charlie | title = Jason Reitman flies high with 'Up In the Air' | work = [[San Jose Mercury News]] | date = December 3, 2009 | url = http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_13903281?source=rss&nclick_check=1 | accessdate = December 6, 2009 }}</ref> They received a startling amount of responses, with 100 responses, including 60 people on camera (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis).<ref name="MOL 2009-11-27">{{cite news | last = Roberts | first = Sheila | title = Jason Reitman Interview, Up in the Air | work = Movies on Line | date = November 27, 2009 | url = http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17517.html | accessdate = November 29, 2009 }}</ref> Twenty-two made it into the film.<ref name="Final Credits">{{cite web | title = "Up in the Air" End Title Credits | publisher = [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] | url = http://www.paramount.com/webmaster/assets/synopsis/30/UITA%20Final%20End%20Credits.pdf | accessdate = December 11, 2009 }}</ref> They interviewed them for about ten minutes on what it is like to lose their job in this kind of economy, and after that they would "fire" them on camera and ask them to either respond the way they did the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they wished they had responded.<ref name="CB 2009-11-05"/><ref name="HR 2009-09-12">{{cite news | last = Zeitchik | first = Steven | title = 'Up in the Air's' recession-themed flight plan | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = September 12, 2009 | url = http://riskybusiness.blogs.thr.com/2009/09/12/jason-reitman-toronto-up-in-the-air/ | accessdate = September 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="WSJ 2009-09-13">{{cite news | last = Kaufman | first = Anthony | title = Toronto Film Festival: George Clooney's "Up In the Air" Spotlights Economic Trouble | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = September 13, 2009 | url = http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/09/13/toronto-film-festival-george-clooneys-up-in-the-air-spotlights-economic-trouble/ | accessdate = September 13, 2009 }}</ref>

Reitman needed fifty days to film ''Up in the Air'', eight of which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots turned out to be more difficult than he had expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many of the aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are featured in the trailer but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carries the [[space shuttle]] flew the aircraft used for the aerial shots.<ref name="SFilm 2009-09-16"/><ref name="FS 2009-09-16"/>

===Editing===
The post-production schedule for ''Up in the Air'' was shorter than [[Jason Reitman]]'s previous two films. The editing team had only 16 to 17 weeks post-schedule, whereas usually the editing deadline is from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman was involved in post-production during shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in L.A. to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would look at them. He flew home every weekend to work with her for a few hours on Saturdays or Sundays in order to stay on schedule.<ref>{{cite news | last = VanAirsdale | first = S.T. | title = Meet Dana E.

Editing helped determine how nonverbal moments shape the first meeting between Ryan and Alex, who become lovers. "In a scene like that, there is a sort of playfulness that goes on," editor, [[Dana E. Glauberman]] said. "There were little looks that they gave each other. Sometimes I stayed a beat longer on a take to get that little sparkle in their eyes&nbsp;...&nbsp;You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing. Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after."<ref>{{cite news | last = Giardina | first = Carolyn | title = Hidden key to thesps' success: editors | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = December 10, 2009 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118012549.html | accessdate = December 11, 2009 }}</ref>

Kevin Renick wrote the song "Up in the Air" two years prior to knowing that Reitman was working on a film adaptation to the book.<ref name="SLPD 2009-11-13">{{cite news | last = Williams | first = Joe | title = 'Up in the Air' gives St. Louis musician a big break | work = [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date = November 13, 2009 | url = http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/entertainment/stories.nsf/0/DBC742F56E55E1338625766B006F041C | accessdate = November 14, 2009 }}</ref> He had been laid off at the time, and was an unrecorded, unemployed St. Louis musician. When Renick researched the film he discovered that the theme of the film was much the same as the song he had written. "The song is about uncertainty, disconnection and loneliness, while alluding to career transition," Renick explained. "It's a melancholy song, and a narrative about finding out where your life's going to go."<ref>{{cite news | last = Wichern | first = Amanda | title = "Up In The Air": A dream came true for Kirkwood High grad Kevin Renick when his song was featured in new George Clooney movie | work = Webster-Kirkwood Times | date = December 4, 2009 | url = http://www.websterkirkwoodtimes.com/Articles-i-2009-12-04-167861.113118_Up_In_The_Air.html | accessdate = December 6, 2009 }}</ref> He handed a cassette to Reitman after the director did an interview at [[Webster University]]. Renick included a spoken-word introduction about the song on the cassette so that Reitman would know why he was giving the song to him. Reitman found a tape deck, listened, liked the song and placed the original introduction and song from the cassette midway through the credits.

Reitman heavily promoted ''Up in the Air'' with personal appearances during film festivals and other showings. He stated that he could relate to and enjoys the idea of Ryan Bingham's lifestyle. "Yesterday <nowiki>[October 28, 2009]</nowiki> I took my 10th flight in 10 days so I live that life myself and I kinda enjoy it," Reitman said, "I think when you're in an airplane it's the last refuge for the people who enjoy being alone and reading a book."<ref name="News 8 Austin">{{cite news | last = Diaz | first = Victor | title = Clooney's newest movie closes Austin Film Festival | work = [[News 8 Austin]] | date = October 29, 2009 | url = http://www.news8austin.com/content/your_news/default.asp?ArID=257091 | accessdate = October 29, 2009 }}</ref>

''Shave Magazine''{{'s}} Jake Tomlinson gave the film four out of five stars and wrote that "There is a very strong sense of humor as well as emotional depth, yet the scope of the film sometimes limits these sentiments.
