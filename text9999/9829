'''Allan John Clarke''' (born 31 July 1946 in [[Short Heath, Willenhall]], [[Staffordshire]]), nicknamed "Sniffer", is a former [[association football|footballer]] who played in [[the Football League]] for [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], and won 19 international [[cap (sport)|caps]] for [[England national football team|England]].<ref name=NB>{{cite web |url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player/allanclarke.htm |title=Allan Clarke |work=UK A<U+2013>Z Transfers |publisher=Neil Brown |accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref> He was one of English football's greatest goalscorers who shot to fame in the much-admired and feared [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] team of the late 1960s and early 1970s.  

==Early career==
Clarke started his career at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] and made his debut aged 16, then moved to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. Such was his early promise that [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] then paid <U+00A3>150,000 for Clarke in 1968 when he had yet to play at the highest level. He spent just one season at Leicester City, reaching his peak in an appearance in the 1969 [[FA Cup]] Final which Leicester City lost 1-0 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. On June 24, 1969, [[Don Revie]] paid <U+00A3>165,000 to Leicester City for Clarke's services, and so began one of the deadliest goalscoring careers in English football.

==Heyday==
Clarke peaked at Elland Road and he scored 26 goals in his first season (and earned the predatory [[nickname]] ''"Sniffer"'', which stuck throughout his career) as Leeds United chased a dream "treble" of [[Football League First Division|League championship]], FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] though ultimately they won nothing. Clarke hit the post in the FA Cup Final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] (with strike partner [[Mick Jones (footballer born 1945)|Mick Jones]] following up to score the rebound) and then went on a mazy run through several [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] defenders in the replay to set up a goal for Jones again, but Leeds United still lost. The title had already gone to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on the last day of the season, and the European Cup campaign ended with defeat to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the semi-final.

==International recognition==
The summer of [[1970]] gave Clarke an opportunity to take some consolation from an eventful but ultimately fruitless club season - he was called up for [[England national football team|England]]'s 1970 [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] squad in [[Mexico]], despite being uncapped, and made his debut for his country against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] in the heat and pressure of a World Cup first round match. Clarke scored the only goal of the match from the penalty spot.

==European success==
Clarke became an England regular thereafter and was in the Leeds United side which won its second [[UEFA Cup|Fairs Cup]] in 1971 - scoring in the final against [[Juventus]] - while again missing out on the League Championship in the last week of the season and losing to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] in the fifth round of the FA Cup (after which he was told by club medics that he was suffering from [[pleurisy]]). But in 1972, his place in Leeds United's folklore would arrive.

==His most famous goal==
Leeds United reached the FA Cup Final again in the competition's [[centenary]] year and at Wembley they faced [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], the Cup holders. In a tight and largely unexciting game, Clarke threw himself at a Jones cross early in the second half and the diving header nestled into the corner of the net.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHm_waxoUgU Film of Alan Clarke's goal] 1972 F.A. Cup Final</ref> He had hit the crossbar with another diving header earlier in the game. Leeds United won 1-0 and Clarke finally had an FA Cup winner's medal. Naturally for Leeds United, there had to be some sourness to temper the sweet, and they lost the League title and the chance of emulating Arsenal's "double" when they lost to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] two days after winning the FA Cup.

==1973 - a bad year==
Clarke played again at Wembley - and lost - when Leeds United were surprisingly beaten 1-0 by [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the 1973 FA Cup Final. Leeds won nothing in what was, for them, a low-key season. Later that year, he was in the England team which needed to beat [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at Wembley to qualify for the 1974 World Cup. A goal down, England were awarded a penalty from which Clarke coolly scored, but he was among many England players thwarted by the brilliant Polish goalkeeper [[Jan Tomaszewski]]. A 1-1 draw was not enough and England did not go to the '74 World Cup.

==Domestic winner, European loser==
Clarke was again Leeds United's top scorer as he finally earned a league title medal in 1974 as Leeds United sauntered to the crown on a record run of 29 opening matches without defeat. The following year he won his 19th and final England cap - he scored a healthy ten goals during his international career - and helped Leeds United to the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] Final.

Leeds United lost the match to [[Bayern Munich]] 2-0 and were denied a clear penalty when Clarke was tackled from behind and felled by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] in the penalty area. This was the last time the great 1960s and 1970s Leeds United generation would be in contention for an honour in the game. The Revie side started to break up - their manager had left in 1974 for the England job - and Clarke himself left the club in 1978 after 351 appearances and 151 goals, with a knee injury curtailing his ability to play at top-flight level. His last major act in a Leeds United shirt was to score in the 1977 FA Cup Semi-Final, but the game ended 2-1 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. He also scored the winning goal in a 1-0 victory for Leeds against Manchester United in 1978 just months before he left Leeds.

==Mangerial Career==
Clarke went to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] as player-manager in June [[1978]] and under him they won promotion to the old third Division in May [[1979]]. A year later, they finished mid-table, an impressive enough achievement for Leeds United to ask their most famous goalscorer to come back as manager in September [[1980]]. This proved a bad move, as sadly, Clarke also became remembered by Leeds United fans as the man who took the club to relegation in [[1982]]. He was sacked on June 25 1982. 

He had another spell at Barnsley between July 1, 1985 and November 8, 1989 when he was dismissed with the club third from bottom in the Second Division, and at [[Scunthorpe United]] between February [[1983]] and August 24, 1984, when he resigned. He was briefly [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] manager for six months but he was sacked on November 30, 1990 to be replaced by [[Steve Thompson (footballer born 1955)|Steve Thompson]]. After a few months scouting, after being fired from Lincoln, Clarke has not been employed in football since.

Clarke has pursued business interests since [[1993]], through being a travelling salesman for MTS Nationwide, a firm based at [[Wakefield]], [[West Yorkshire]]. He has, however, remained an outspoken critic of the game, and like all the Leeds United players of the Revie era, has remained fiercely protective of the reputation of both the manager and the club. He has suffered from [[Arthritis|arthritic]] [[knee]]s in recent years.

Clarke was the second of five brothers to play the professional game - four of whom played for [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] across three decades.
[[Frank James Clarke|Frank]] was the only Clarke brother not to represent Walsall, playing for [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]]; [[Derek Clarke|Derek]] played for Walsall, [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Orient]]; [[Kelvin Clarke|Kelvin]] played for Walsall; and the youngest sibling, [[Wayne Clarke]], played for Walsall towards the end of his career after very successful spells with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Birmingham City and Everton (where he won the League championship in 1987). He also represented [[England national football team|England]] at schoolboy level.

He is now living in [[Scunthorpe]], [[Lincolnshire]].
