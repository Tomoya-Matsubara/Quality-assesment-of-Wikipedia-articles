'''Hugh Boyle Ewing''', ([[October 31]], [[1826]] &ndash; [[June 30]], [[1905]]), was a diplomat, author, attorney, and [[Union Army]] general during the [[American Civil War]]. He a member of the prestigious Ewing family, son of [[Thomas Ewing]], the eldest brother of [[Thomas Ewing, Jr.]] and [[Charles Ewing (General)|Charles Ewing]], and the foster brother of [[William T. Sherman]]. 

==Early life and career==

He was educated at the [[West Point|U.S. military academy]], but was forced to resign on the eve of graduation after failing an engineering exam which was a major embarrassment to his family.<ref name="warner">[http://books.google.com/books?id=2PSgcaLic-AC&pg=PA3&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=BDHetzw8BquXSuTeIaysXvJmlTQ#PPA146,M1 Warner 1963, p. 146]</ref> While a member of the cadet corps, he was close friends with future Union generals [[John Buford]], Nathaniel C. McLean, and John Tidball.<ref>Longacre, p. 25</ref> His father appointed [[Philip Sheridan]] to the open seat.<ref>[http://hometown.aol.com/ohiocwtc/Trail2.html Ohio In the Civil Wair, Trail II "The Generals"]</ref> During the gold rush in [[1849]] went to [[California]] where he joined an expedition ordered by his father, then [[Secretary of the Interior]], to rescue immigrants who were imprisoned in the Sierra by the heavy snows.<ref name="brown"/> He returned in 1852 with dispatches for the government.<ref name="heid"/>

He then completed his course in law and settled in [[St. Louis, Mo.]], where he practiced from 1854 to 1856, when he removed with his young brother, Thomas Jr., and brother-in-laws William T. Sherman and Hampden B. Denman to [[Leavenworth, Kansas]] and began speculating in lands, roads, and government housing.<ref name="warner"/> They quickly established one of the leading law firms of Leavenworth, as well as a financially powerful land agency.<ref>Rossman 1980, p. 121</ref> In 1858 he was married to Henrietta, daughter of George W. Young, a large plantation owner of the [[District of Columbia]], whose family was prominent in the settlement and history of [[Maryland]].<ref name="warner"/> He soon afterward took charge of his father's salt works in Ohio.<ref name="brown"/>

==Civil War==

General Ewing was an ambitious, literate, and erudite officer who held a strong sense of responsibility for the men under his command.<ref name="twoohfour"/> He combined his West Point experience with the Civil War system of officer election.<ref name="twoohfour">[http://books.google.com/books?id=_wofLatTIsEC&pg=PA258&lpg=PA258&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing+papers%22&source=web&ots=THAal3Rg1y&sig=WHeu4ZxyqgqKM3i0_fRIzMp3oyU#PPA203,M1 Burton 1998, p. 204]</ref> In April, 1861, he was appointed by [[William Dennison (Ohio governor)|Governor Dennison]] brigade-inspector of Ohio volunteers, and he served under [[William Rosecrans|Rosecrans]] and [[George Brinton McClellan|McClellan]] in western Virginia.<ref name="brown"/> He was made colonel of the 30th Ohio volunteers in August, 1861, Brigadier General, Nov. 29, 1862, and Major General by brevet in 1865.<ref name="warner"/>

In November of 1861, when his brother-in-law William T. Sherman was relieved of his command in disgrace, Ewing aided his younger sister Ellen Ewing Sherman in making the rounds of Washington DC, denying sensationalist media claims that Sherman was insane, and personally lobbying the President for Sherman's reinstatement.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=k-yQW4DdxIsC&pg=PA137&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=5TvkskW1NlSAizkXd5SbtdJMOm0#PPA136,M1 Boritt 1994, p. 135]</ref> Ewing and his sister had argued that Sherman's requests for men and material in Kentucky had been denied in Washington, and that the charges of insanity had been part of a conspiracy orchestrated by Adjutant General [[Lorenzo Thomas]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=k-yQW4DdxIsC&pg=PA137&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=5TvkskW1NlSAizkXd5SbtdJMOm0#PPA136,M1 Boritt 1994, p. 136]</ref> Eventually the political influence of the Ewing family persevered, and with the assistance of [[Henry Halleck]], Sherman was returned to command.<ref name="heid">Heidler, Jeanne, Heidler, David, & Coles, David. ''Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History''. Santa Barbara, California, ABC-CLIO: 2000.</ref> President Lincoln praised Sherman's "talent & conduct" publicly to a large group of important officers, and later banished Thomas to a meaningless post on recruiting duty in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=k-yQW4DdxIsC&pg=PA137&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=5TvkskW1NlSAizkXd5SbtdJMOm0#PPA136,M1 Boritt 1994, p. 137]</ref>

Under McClellan he held command of a regiment and then a brigade of the Kanawha Division in the [[IX Corps (ACW)|IX Corps]].<ref name="heid"/> In the [[Battle of South Mountain]] he led the assault which drove the enemy from the summit; and at midnight of that day he received an order placing him in command of the brigade of Colonel Eliakim P. Scammon, who was in temporary command of the Kanawha division after its commander General [[Jacob D. Cox]] had been elevated to command of the IX Corps, replacing the fallen General [[Jesse Lee Reno]] who was killed earlier that day.<ref name="warner"/> At [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] his brigade was placed upon the extreme left of the army, where, according to the report of [[Ambrose Burnside|General Burnside]], "by a brilliant change of front he saved the left from being completely driven in."<ref>[http://www.civilwarhome.com/burnsideantietam.htm Report of. Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, U. S. Army, Commanding Right Wing, Army of the Potomac, Of Operations September 7-19.]</ref>

After Antietam, Ewing was placed on sick leave because of chronic [[dysentery]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=epbbg1CA4CAC&pg=PA111&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=rEQpS9Kp6Nv_MvLmCrPw4U5kjJ0 Welsh 1996, p. 111]</ref> He served throughout the campaign before Vicksburg, leading the assaults made by [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]]; and upon its fall was placed in command of a division in the [[XVI Corps (ACW)|XVI Corps]].<ref name="warner"/> At [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] he was given command of the 4th division of the [[XV Corps (ACW)|XV Corps]], which formed the advance of Sherman's army and carried Missionary Ridge.<ref name="sword">Sword, p. 157</ref> Sherman considered Ewing his most reliable division commander.<ref name="sword"/>

In the aftermath of Vicksburg, Ewing's command had wrecked Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]]' Fleetwood Plantation, and Ewing turned over Davis' personal correspondence to his brother-in-law Sherman.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=56R_N48VhnkC&pg=PA359&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=t8eqwnpln_1odN8o7ByBzMonxG8#PPA360,M1 Allen 1999, p. 359]</ref> However, Ewing also sent copies of the letters to a few people he had known in Ohio, which after publishing, permanently ruined the reputation of former President [[Franklin Pierce]] of New Hampshire.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=56R_N48VhnkC&pg=PA359&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=t8eqwnpln_1odN8o7ByBzMonxG8#PPA360,M1 Allen 1999, p. 360]</ref> Their release coincided with that of Pierce's book, ''Our Old Home''. As early as 1860, Pierce had written to Davis about "the madness of northern abolitionism", and other letters uncovered stated that he would "never justify, sustain, or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless unnecessary war", and that "the true purpose of the war was to wipe out the states and destroy property."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=56R_N48VhnkC&pg=PA359&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=t8eqwnpln_1odN8o7ByBzMonxG8#PPA360,M1 Allen 1999, p. 360]</ref>

Ewing was then placed in command of the occupation forces in [[Louisville in the American Civil War|Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref name="warner"/> He was unfortunate enough to serve during General [[Stephen Gano Burbridge]]'s "reign of terror" where martial law was declared several times.<ref>Beach 1995, p. 177</ref> On August 11, General Burbridge ordered soldiers from the 26th Kentucky to select four men to be taken from prison in Louisville to [[Eminence, Kentucky]], to be shot for unknown outrages, and on August 20, several suspected Confederate guerrillas were also to be taken from Louisville and executed. General Ewing declared their innocence and sought a pardon from Burbridge, but he refused to give the pardon and the men were shot.<ref>Beach 1995, p. 184</ref>

In his autobiography, Ewing describes an incident in October 1862 with Colonel Augustus Moor, who had struck a member of Ewing's regiment with his sword when the enlisted soldier had fallen out of a march. Ewing immediately confronted Moor. In his own words:

{{Quotation|He was at the table with his Staff and Colonels, drinking Ohio wine from long-necked bottles, and smoking, and presented quite an old-time German scene. I Told him I would not tolerate the German custom of treating common soldiers, if applied to my men, by any officer. I preserved discipline by taking care of my troops, collectively and individually.|Hugh Boyle Ewing<ref>Ewing, p. 272</ref>}}

Colonel Moor quickly apologized. While General Ewing respected the discipline of the German regiment, he preferred a different atmosphere in his own command, better suited to Americans. He was capable of recognizing the military tradition of other units while accommodating the unique needs of his own.<ref>Burton 1998, p. 205</ref> General Ewing was ordered to North Carolina in 1865, and was planning an expedition up the Roanoke river to co-operate with the army of the James, when Lee surrendered.<ref name="brown">Brown vol. III, p. 24</ref>

==Postbellum Career==

In 1864, Ewing suffered an attack of [[rheumatism]], and received treatment several times thereafter, often being confined to his chair.<ref name="heid"/> He was likely prostrated with illness as Commander of Louisville during Burbridge's madness in Kentucky.<ref name="brown"/> After leaving the Army, he experienced painful attacks for the rest of his life, often bedridden for periods of up to forty days.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=epbbg1CA4CAC&pg=PA111&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=rEQpS9Kp6Nv_MvLmCrPw4U5kjJ0 Welsh 1996, p. 111]</ref>

President [[Andrew Johnson]] appointed him U.S. Minister to Holland, where he served, 1866-70.<ref name="heid"/> This appointment may have drawn the ire of the [[Radical Republicans]], for Speaker of the House [[James G. Blaine]] urged for Ewing to be recalled and replaced with his brother Charles. Blaine told the President that Hugh was 'acting badly'.<ref>[http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohstemplate.cfm?action=detail&Page=0059185.html&StartPage=165&EndPage=195&volume=59&newtitle=Volume%2059%20Page%20165 Beatty, p. 184]</ref> Blaine himself was disingenous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator [[John Sherman]] that he was doing everything possible to nominate his close personal friend Ohioan General [[Roeliff Brinkerhoff]] for the post.<ref>[http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohstemplate.cfm?action=detail&Page=0059185.html&StartPage=165&EndPage=195&volume=59&newtitle=Volume%2059%20Page%20165 Beatty, p. 185]</ref> Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon.

Upon his return to the United States Ewing retired upon a farm near [[Lancaster, Ohio]] where he died of old age.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=epbbg1CA4CAC&pg=PA111&dq=%22hugh+boyle+ewing%22&sig=rEQpS9Kp6Nv_MvLmCrPw4U5kjJ0 Welsh 1996, p. 111]</ref> He was the author of: ''The Black List; A Tale of Early California'' (1887); ''A Castle in the Air'' (1887); ''The Gold Plague'', and other works.<ref name="heid"/>
