Sullivan County is located in north central Pennsylvania, about 123&nbsp;miles (198&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and 195&nbsp;miles (314&nbsp;km) east-northeast of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].<ref name="distance">{{cite web | last = Michels | first = Chris | year = 1997 | url = http://www2.nau.edu/~cvm/latlongdist.html | title = "Latitude/Longitude Distance Calculation" |publisher = Northern Arizona University | accessdate = 2007-09-17}}</ref> [[2008|As of 2008]], its thirteen incorporated municipalities include four boroughs and nine townships. Sullivan County covers 452&nbsp;square miles (1,172&nbsp;[[km<U+00B2>]]), of which 450&nbsp;square miles (1,165&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) are land and 2&nbsp;square miles (6&nbsp;km<U+00B2>, 0.53%) are water. Its municipalities range in size from the borough of [[Dushore, Pennsylvania|Dushore]] with 0.9&nbsp;square miles (2.3&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) to [[Davidson Township, Pennsylvania|Davidson Township]] with 78.2&nbsp;square miles (202.3&nbsp;km<U+00B2>). [[Cherry Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Cherry Township]] has the highest population of any municipality (1,718 or 26.2% of the county total as of 2000), while the borough of [[Forksville, Pennsylvania|Forksville]] has the lowest population (147 or 2.2%).<ref name="census"/>

Under Pennsylvania law, there are two types of [[Municipal corporation|incorporated municipalities]] in the county: [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|boroughs]] and [[Township (Pennsylvania)|townships]]. Any municipality in Pennsylvania with more than 10 persons can incorporate as a borough. Any township or borough with a population of at least 10,000 can ask the [[Pennsylvania State Legislature|state legislature]] to become chartered as a city. However, as Sullivan County has a population of only 6,556, it has no [[List of cities in Pennsylvania|cities]]. There are no unincorporated areas in the county, since all territory in Pennsylvania is incorporated.<ref name="PA govt"/>

==History==
The land which became Sullivan County was originally purchased from the [[Iroquois]] by the [[Province of Pennsylvania]] in 1768, as part of the first [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]]. It was originally part of [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]], then became part of [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming County]] when it was formed in 1795.<ref name="history"> {{cite book | last = Meginness | first = John Franklin | title = History of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania: including its aboriginal history; the colonial and revolutionary periods; early settlement and subsequent growth; organization and civil administration; the legal and medical professions; internal improvement; past and present history of Williamsport; manufacturing and lumber interests; religious, educational, and social development; geology and agriculture; military record; sketches of boroughs, townships, and villages; portraits and biographies of pioneers and representative citizens, etc. etc." | date = 1892 | url = http://www.usgennet.org/usa/pa/county/lycoming/history/lyco-history-01.html | accessdate = 2007-08-05 | edition = 1st Edition | publisher = Brown, Runk & Co. | location = Chicago, IL | id = ISBN 0-7884-0428-8 | quote = (Note: ISBN refers to Heritage Books July 1996 reprint. URL is to a scan of the 1892 version with some [[Optical Character Recognition|OCR]] typos). }}</ref> Sullivan County itself was formed from the northeastern part of Lycoming County on [[March 15]] [[1847]]. It was the thirteenth and last county formed at least partly from Lycoming County, and the fifth entirely formed from it.<ref name ="history"/> 

According to the official state publication ''Pennsylvania Local Government'', Sullivan County was named for Pennsylvania state senator Charles C. Sullivan, who "took an active part in procuring passage of the bill" establishing the county.<ref name="PA govt"/> However, according to former Pennsylvania state librarian [[Frederic A. Godcharles]] (1933), the county is named for General [[John Sullivan]], who led the [[Sullivan Expedition]] against the Iroquois in 1779.<ref name="godcharles"/>

While all four boroughs were formed after Sullivan County was established, seven of the nine townships were formed while still part of Lycoming County. The first of these was Shrewsbury Township, which encompassed all of modern Sullivan County when originally formed in 1803. Elkland Township was formed from Shrewsbury in 1804, as were Cherry (1824), Davidson (1833), and Forks Townships (1833). Plunketts Creek Township was formed from [[Franklin Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Franklin]] and Davidson Townships in 1838, and Fox Township was formed from Elkland in 1839. When Sullivan County was formed in 1847, both Shrewsbury and [[Plunketts Creek Township, Pennsylvania|Plunketts Creek Townships]] were split, with each county originally having a township of that name. Plunketts Creek Township in Sullivan County changed its name to Hillsgrove Township in 1856.<ref name="sullivan history"/> Sullivan County has no former townships, and no counties have been formed from it.

When formed in 1847, Sullivan County had no boroughs. The unincorporated village of Cherry Hill in Cherry Township served as the first county seat until 1850, when Laporte was founded in the geographic center of the county, and became its new county seat.<ref name="godcharles"/> In 1850 the population of the county was 3,694 and it grew steadily to a peak of 12,134 in 1900. This was just after the borough of Eagles Mere was incorporated as the last of the county's municipalities, in 1899.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/newlong3.php | title= Historical Census Browser: Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania: Total Population by County 1850-1960 |publisher = University of Virginia Library | format = Searchable database | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref> Much of this growth was fueled by [[lumber]]-based industry, but the [[Old growth forest|virgin forests]] were almost all gone by 1900 and the population declined in seven of ten decades since then, decreasing by a total of 46% between 1900 and 2000.<ref name ="sullivan history" /><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/pa190090.txt |title= "Pennsylvania, Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990" | author= | author = Richard L.
