Cambridge's coaches were Fraser Emilie Churchill (who had rowed for the Light Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1883|1883]], [[The Boat Race 1884|1884]] and [[The Boat Race 1885|1885 races]]), Charles William Moore (who represented Cambridge in the [[The Boat Race 1881|1881]], [[The Boat Race 1882|1882]], 1883 and 1884 races), Frederick Islay Pitman (who rowed in 1884, 1885 and [[The Boat Race 1886|1886]]), Herbert Edward Rhodes (who rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1873|1873]], [[The Boat Race 1874|1874]], [[The Boat Race 1875|1875]] and [[The Boat Race 1876|1876 races]]) and Henry Tudor Trevor-Jones.  Oxford were coached by [[Tom Cottingham Edwards-Moss]] (who rowed for the Dark Blues four times between the 1875 and the [[The Boat Race 1878|1878 races]]) and [[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough|William Grenfell]] (who rowed for Oxford in 1877, 1878 and was non-rowing boat club president in 1879).<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>

The umpire for the race was [[Frank Willan (rower)|Frank Willan]] who won the event four consecutive times, rowing for Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1866|1866]], [[The Boat Race 1867|1867]], [[The Boat Race 1868|1868]] and [[The Boat Race 1869|1869 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 59</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 3.5&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (77.6&nbsp;kg), {{convert|3.25|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.  For the only time in the history of the event, every rower from the Cambridge crew had taken part in the previous year's race, with [[Stanley Muttlebury]] making his fourth consecutive appearance.  As a result of the availability of the the former [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]], there was little competition in the trial eights, and the Cambridge crew were considered to be "not nearly as fast" as they had been in 1888.<ref>Drinkwater, p. 92</ref> Only the [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] Thomas Welby Northmore was new to the event.  Oxford's crew contained three former Blues, including H. R. Parker who was rowing in his third Boat Race.<ref name=burn64>Burnell, p. 64</ref>  All of the competitors were registered as British.<ref>Burnell, p. 38</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]], along which the race is conducted]]
Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford.<ref name=burn64/>  Commencing at 1.15pm, at a high [[stroke rate]] Cambridge took an early lead, before settling down to a "long, steady and tremendously powerful stroke".<ref>Drinkwater, pp. 92&ndash;93</ref>  By the Crab Tree pub, they were almost clear and despite a spurt from the Dark Blues, Cambridge were a length-and-a-half ahead by [[Hammersmith Bridge]].  They continued to pull away at Chiswick and despite the "tremendous sea raised by the wind above [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes]]",<ref>Drinkwater, p. 93</ref> extended their lead further to win by three lengths in a time of 20 minutes 14 seconds.<ref name=dodd308>Dodd, p. 308</ref>  It was Cambridge's fourth consecutive victory and their fifth in six years, with the fastest winning time since Oxford's victory in the [[The Boat Race 1882|1882 race]].  The victory took the overall record to 23&ndash;22 in Oxford's favour.<ref name=results/>
