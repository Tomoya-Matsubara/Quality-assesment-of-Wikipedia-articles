'''''Jurassic Park''''' is a 1993 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] film<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/programs/2015_jurassic.html |title=NOVA Online &#124; Teachers &#124; Program Overview &#124; Real Jurassic Park, The |publisher=PBS |date=1993-11-09 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and based on the [[Jurassic Park|novel of the same name]] by [[Michael Crichton]]. The film centers on the fictional [[Isla Nublar]] (Spanish for "Cloudy Island"), in [[Costa Rica]], where billionaire philanthropist John Hammond ([[Richard Attenborough]]) and a team of genetic scientists from his company have created an [[amusement park]] of [[Cloning|cloned]] [[dinosaur]]s.

Before Crichton's book was even published studios such as Warner Bros., Columbia TriStar, 20th Century Fox, and Universal had already began bidding to acquire the picture rights. Spielberg, with the backing of Universal Studios, acquired the rights to the novel before its publication in [[1990 in literature|1990]], and Crichton himself was hired by Universal Studios for an additional [[United States dollar|$]]500,000 to adapt the novel into a proper screenplay.<ref>http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Jurassic_Park_Series</ref> [[David Koepp]] wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel's exposition and violence, and made numerous changes to the characters.

''Jurassic Park'' is regarded as a landmark in the use of computer-generated imagery, and received positive reviews from critics, who praised the effects, though reactions to other elements of the picture, such as character development, were mixed. During its release, the film grossed more than $914 million worldwide, becoming the most successful film released up to that time (surpassing ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and surpassed 4 years later by ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''), and it is currently the [[List of highest-grossing films|15th highest grossing feature film]] (taking inflation into account, it is the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States|18th-highest-grossing film]] in [[North America]]). It is the most financially successful film for [[NBC Universal]] and Steven Spielberg.

== Plot ==
The wealthy billionaire and dinosaur enthusiast John Hammond ([[Richard Attenborough]]), [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[InGen]] has recently created Jurassic Park; a futuristic theme park populated with dinosaurs cloned from [[DNA]] taken from fossilized mosquitoes preserved in [[amber]]. The park is situated on Isla Nublar, an island 87 miles north-west of [[Costa Rica]]; for security purposes, the island is surrounded by fifty miles of electric fence, and the dinosaurs have had their chromosomes altered to make them all female to prevent reproduction.

After an incident in the park, where a worker is fatally savaged by a [[Velociraptor]], Hammond is advised by his lawyer Donald Gennaro ([[Martin Ferrero]]) to have two experts sign off on the island for the benefit of health and safety. To that end, Hammond invites paleontologist Alan Grant ([[Sam Neill]]) and paleobotanist Ellie Sattler ([[Laura Dern]]) along with Dr. Ian Malcolm ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), a chaotician, and Hammond's grandchildren&mdash;Timothy "Tim" Murphy ([[Joseph Mazzello]]) and Alexis "Lex" Murphy ([[Ariana Richards]])&mdash;to Jurassic Park, in order to convince his lawyers the park is safe. The group is sent into the park as part of a [[safari]] experience to observe most of the animals. Hammond, meanwhile, observes his guests along with Head Technician Ray Arnold ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) and his Head of Security, Robert Muldoon ([[Bob Peck]]).

However, it transpires that one of the computer programmers, Dennis Nedry ([[Wayne Knight]]), is in the employ of BioSyn, a corporate rival of InGen, and has been paid a substantial price to steal fertilized dinosaur [[embryo]]s. To allow the theft, Nedry infects the park's security measures with a [[computer virus]] to allow him access to the embryo storage, inadvertently deactivating the electrified fences containing the dinosaurs. The rest of the group, who have been stranded in the park due to the system shutdown, are attacked by the [[Tyrannosaurus]] escaping from its paddock; Gennaro is killed and Malcolm is badly injured. Grant survives and escapes with the children into the park. Nedry flees with his prize, but his jeep gets stuck, and while trying to winch it out Nedry is blinded and eventually killed by an escaped [[Dilophosaurus]]. The embryos are lost.

With the virus affecting the entire park's systems, Hammond recommends a total shutdown of the park's systems. He, along with Sattler, Arnold, Muldoon and Malcolm, shuts down the park's system and retreats to the emergency bunker, from where Arnold heads to the maintenance compound to reboot the system. When he doesn't return, Muldoon and Sattler head for the compound; on the way, they pass the raptor paddock, and discover the raptors (whose fence wasn't shut off by Nedry but was affected by the park-wide shut-down) have escaped. At the same time, Grant and the children discover a nest full of hatched eggs; the dinosaurs are breeding. Grant theorizes this is due to using frog DNA to fill in gaps in the dinosaur gene sequence, as some frogs are able to change gender in a single-sex environment.

As Muldoon and Sattler proceed to the maintenance compound, Muldoon realizes they are being hunted by Velociraptors. The pair split up; Muldoon goes after the raptors, while Sattler heads for the maintenance shed. She manages to reactivate the park's systems (narrowly escaping a Velociraptor hiding inside the shed, which has killed Arnold); meanwhile, Muldoon is ambushed and killed by the Velociraptors. Grant and the kids head for the visitor's centre; he leaves the kids alone in the kitchen while he reunites with Sattler and the others. The kids find that two Velociraptors have entered the visitor centre, but they are able to evade the dinosaurs, reunite with Grant and Sattler and get the park's security systems working from the control room. Grant contacts Hammond and tells him to call the mainland for rescue, but the two raptors find the group and attack.

The group flees, only to be cornered in the entrance hall by the Velociraptors, who get ready to pounce. As all seems lost, the Tyrannosaurus breaks into the hall and seizes one of the raptors in its jaws, killing it. The second raptor charges the T-Rex as Sattler, Grant and the kids run for safety as the two dinosaurs fight; they are rescued by Malcolm and Hammond, who have fled the emergency bunker in a Jeep, where Grant tells Hammond he will not endorse Jurassic Park, a decision with which Hammond agrees. As they drive away, the Tyrannosaurus finishes off the Velociraptor and roars in triumph.

The group reaches the helipad, where they are evacuated from the island. As their helicopter flies across the ocean back to the mainland, Grant sees a flock of pelicans flying past, reminders of the connection between birds and dinosaurs.

== Production ==
[[Michael Crichton]] originally conceived a [[screenplay]] about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur; he continued to wrestle with his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.<ref>{{cite video | people = Michael Crichton | title = Michael Crichton on the Jurassic Park Phenomenon | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal | date = 2001}}</ref> Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.<ref name="mcbride">[[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]] (1997). ''Steven Spielberg''. Faber and Faber, 416<U+2013>9. ISBN 0-571-19177-0</ref> Before the book was published, Crichton demanded a non-negotiable fee of $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] and [[Tim Burton]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and [[Richard Donner]], and [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Joe Dante]] bid for the rights,<ref name="mcbride" /> but Universal eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg.<ref name="Production notes">DVD Production Notes</ref> Universal paid Crichton a further $500,000 to adapt his own novel,<ref>{{cite news | title = Leaping Lizards | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1990-12-07 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318785,00.html | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> which he had finished by the time Spielberg was filming ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]''. Crichton noted that because the book was "fairly long" his script only had about 10 to 20 percent of the novel's content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons.<ref name="Biodrowski">Steve Biodrowski. ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' Magazine, Vol. 24, No.2, pg. 12, "Jurassic Park: Michael Crichton"</ref> After completing ''Hook'', Spielberg wanted to film ''[[Schindler's List]]''. [[Music Corporation of America]] (then the parent company of Universal Pictures) president [[Sid Sheinberg]] gave a green light to the film on one condition: that Spielberg make ''Jurassic Park'' first. Spielberg later said, "He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''."<ref name="mcbride" />

Spielberg hired [[Stan Winston]] to create the animatronic dinosaurs, [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[go motion]] dinosaurs for [[long shot]]s, [[Michael Lantieri]] to supervise the on-set effects, and [[Dennis Muren]] to do the digital compositing. Paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] supervised the designs, to help fulfil Spielberg's desire to portray the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. Horner dismissed the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early animatics,<ref name="Earl doc">{{cite video | title = The Making of Jurassic Park <U+2014> Hosted by James Earl Jones | medium = VHS | publisher = Universal |date = 1995}}</ref> complaining, "[The dinosaurs] have no way of doing that!" Taking Horner's advice, Spielberg insisted that Tippett take the tongues out.<ref name="French">Lawrence French. ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' Magazine, Vol.24, No.2, pg. 9, "Jurassic Park: Dinosaur Movements"</ref> Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs before molding [[latex]] skins, which were fitted over complex robotics. Tippett created stop-motion [[animatic]]s of major scenes, but, despite go motion's attempts at motion blurs, Spielberg still found the end results unsatisfactory in terms of working in a [[live-action]] feature film.<ref name="Earl doc" /> Animators Mark Dippe and Steve Williams went ahead in creating a computer-generated walk cycle for the ''T. Rex'' skeleton and were approved to do more.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 49.</ref> When Spielberg and Tippett saw an animatic of the ''T. Rex'' chasing a herd of ''[[Gallimimus]]'', Spielberg said, "You're out of a job," to which Tippett replied, "Don't you mean extinct?"<ref name="Earl doc" /> Spielberg later wrote both the animatic and his dialogue between him and Tippett into the script.<ref name="gallies">Shay, Duncan, p. 134<U+2013>5.</ref> As [[George Lucas]] watched the demonstration alongside of them, his eyes began to tear up. "It was like one of those moments in history, like the invention of the light bulb or the first telephone call," he said. "A major gap had been crossed, and things were never going to be the same."<ref>Shone, Tom.

[[Malia Scotch Marmo]] began a script rewrite in October 1991 over a five-month period, merging Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 39<U+2013>42.</ref> Screenwriter [[David Koepp]] came on board afterward, starting afresh from Marmo's draft, and used Spielberg's idea of a cartoon shown to the visitors to remove much of the exposition that fills Crichton's novel.<ref name="koepp">Shay, Duncan, p. 55<U+2013>6.</ref> Spielberg also excised a sub-plot of ''[[Procompsognathus]]'' escaping to the mainland and attacking young children, as he found it too horrific.<ref>{{cite news | title = A Tale Of Two 'Jurassics' | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1993-06-18 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306930,00.html | accessdate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> This sub-plot would eventually be used as a prologue in the Spielberg-directed sequel, ''The Lost World''. Hammond was changed from a ruthless businessman to a kindly old man, because Spielberg identified with Hammond's obsession with showmanship.<ref name="lack of story?">McBride, p. 421<U+2013>422.</ref> He also switched the characters of Tim and Lex; in the book, Tim is aged 11 and into computers, and Lex is only seven or eight and into sports. Spielberg did this because he wanted to work with the younger Joseph Mazzello, and it also allowed him to introduce the sub-plot of Lex's adolescent crush on Grant.<ref name="casting" /> Koepp changed Grant's relationship with the children, making him hostile to them initially to allow for more [[characterization#Character development|character development]].<ref name="mcbride" /> Koepp also took the opportunity to cut out a major sequence from the book, for budgetary reasons, where the T. Rex chases Grant and the children down a river before being tranquilized by Muldoon. This scene was revived in part in ''Jurassic Park III'' with the ''Spinosaurus'' replacing the T.Rex.<ref name="koepp" />

After 25 months of pre-production, filming began on August 24, 1992, on the [[Hawaii]]an island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]].<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 65 and 67.</ref> The three-week shoot involved various daytime exteriors.<ref name="Production notes" /> On September 11, [[Hurricane Iniki]] passed directly over Kaua{{okina}}i, which caused the crew to lose a day of shooting.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 86.</ref> Several of the storm scenes from the movie are actual footage shot during the hurricane. The scheduled shoot of the ''Gallimimus'' chase was moved to [[Kualoa Ranch]] on the island of [[Oahu]] and one of the beginning scenes had to be created by digital animating a still shot of scenery.<ref name="gallies" /> The crew moved back to mainland USA to shoot at [[Universal Studios]]'s Stage 24 for scenes involving the raptors in the kitchen.<ref name="Production notes" /> The crew also shot on Stage 23 for the scenes involving the power supply, before going on location to [[Red Rock Canyon State Park (California)|Red Rock Canyon]] for the [[Montana]] dig scenes.<ref name="location">Shay, Duncan, p. 91<U+2013>92.</ref> The crew returned to Universal to shoot Grant's rescue of Tim, using a fifty-foot prop with hydraulic wheels for the car fall, and the ''Brachiosaurus'' encounter. The crew filmed scenes for the Park's labs and control room, which used animations for the computers lent from [[Silicon Graphics]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].<ref name="triple cite">Shay, Duncan, p. 95<U+2013>105.</ref>

The crew moved to [[Warner Bros. Studios]]' Stage 16 to shoot the ''T. Rex'' attack on the tour cars.<ref name="triple cite" /> Shooting proved frustrating due to water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur.<ref name="big fan" /> The ripples in the glass of water caused by the ''T. Rex''{{'}}s footsteps was inspired by Spielberg listening to [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] in his car, and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused. Lantieri was unsure of how to create the shot until the night before filming, when he put a glass of water on a guitar he was playing, which achieved the concentric circles in the water Spielberg wanted. The next morning, guitar strings were put inside the car and a man on the ground plucked the strings to achieve the effect.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 200 things that rocked our world|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=February 2006|page=131}}</ref> Back at Universal, the crew filmed scenes with the ''Dilophosaurus'' on Stage 27. Finally, the shoot finished on Stage 12, with the climactic chases with the raptors in the Park's computer rooms and Visitor's Center.<ref name="dilo">Shay, Duncan, p. 113<U+2013>114.</ref> Spielberg brought back the ''T. Rex'' for the climax, abandoning his original ending in which Grant uses a platform machine to maneuver a raptor into a fossil tyrannosaur's jaws.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 118.</ref> The film wrapped twelve days ahead of schedule on November 30,<ref name="Production notes" /><ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 120.</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | title = Spielberg parks 'Jurassic' under sked, budget | publisher = Variety | date = 1992-12-01 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862089.html?categoryid=2&cs=1 | accessdate = 2007-01-27}}</ref> and within days editor [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]] had a rough cut ready, allowing Spielberg to go ahead with filming ''Schindler's List''.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 126.</ref>

In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and ''Gallimimus''. As well as the computer-generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richards' stunt double.<ref name="Earl doc" /> Compositing the dinosaurs onto the live action scenes took around an hour.

* ''[[Velociraptor]]'' also has a major role and is portrayed as the film's [[antagonist]]. The animal's depiction was not based on the actual dinosaur genus in question (which itself was significantly smaller), rather the related (and larger) genus ''[[Deinonychus]]'', which had been synonymised with ''Velociraptor'' by [[Gregory S.

Coincidentally, before ''Jurassic Park'''s theatre release, the similar ''[[Utahraptor]]'' was discovered, though was proved bigger in appearance than the film's raptors; this prompted Stan Winston to joke, "We made it, then they discovered it."<ref name="magic" /> For the attack on character Robert Muldoon, the raptors were [[Suitmation|played by men in suits]].<ref name="dilo" /> [[Dolphin]] screams, [[walrus]]es bellowing, [[geese]] hissing, [[Crane (bird)|an African crane]]'s mating call, and human rasps were mixed to formulate various raptor sounds.<ref name="Earl doc" /><ref name="the end" /> Following discoveries made after the film's release, most paleontologists theorized that [[dromaeosaur]]s like ''Velociraptor'' and ''Deinonychus'' had feathers.<ref name="paul2002">Paul, G.S. 2002.

* ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' was also very different from its real-life counterpart, made significantly smaller to make sure audiences did not confuse it with the raptors.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 36.</ref> Its [[neck frill]] and its ability to spit venom are fictitious. Its vocal sounds were made by combining a [[swan]], a [[hawk]], a [[howler monkey]], and a [[rattlesnake]].<ref name="Earl doc" />

* ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' is the first dinosaur seen by the park's visitors.

Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer [[Gary Rydstrom]] decided to represent them with [[whale song]]s and [[donkey]] calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder.<ref name="the end" />

* ''[[Triceratops]]'' has an extended cameo. Its appearance was a particular logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg asked to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 83.</ref> Winston also created a baby ''Triceratops'' for Ariana Richards to ride, which was cut from the film for pacing reasons.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 64.</ref>

* ''[[Gallimimus]]'' and ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'' roles are mainly cameos. ''Gallimimus'' feature in a stampede scene where one of them is devoured by the ''Tyrannosaurus''. ''Parasaurolophus'' appears in the background during the first encounter with the ''Brachiosaurus''.

=== Critical ===
The film received mostly positive reviews. High praise was heaped on the visual effects, although there was much criticism leveled at the characterization and departures from the book. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen<U+2026> On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents<U+2026>[but] [i]t becomes less crisp on screen than it was on the page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away."<ref>{{cite news | author=[[Janet Maslin]] | title = Screen Stars With Teeth To Spare | publisher = The New York Times | date = 1993-06-11 | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&title1=&title2=JURASSIC%20PARK%20%28MOVIE%29&reviewer=Janet%20Maslin&v_id=26808&pdate=19930611&oref=slogin | accessdate = 2007-02-04}}</ref> In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] described the film as "colossal entertainment<U+2014>the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed.

Most significantly, when many filmmakers saw ''Jurassic Park'''s use of [[computer generated imagery|computer-generated imagery]], they realized that many of their visions, previously thought unfeasible or too expensive, were now possible.
