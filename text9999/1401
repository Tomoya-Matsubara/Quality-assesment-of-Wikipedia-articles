Juliet diagnoses him with appendicitis and deems an [[appendectomy]] necessary.  She sends [[Sun-Hwa Kwon|Sun Kwon]] ([[Yunjin Kim]]) to get medical supplies from the "Staff" [[Dharma Initiative]] medical station.  Sun is accompanied by [[Jin-Soo Kwon|Jin Kwon]] ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), [[Daniel Faraday]] ([[Jeremy Davies (actor)|Jeremy Davies]]) and [[Charlotte Lewis (Lost)|Charlotte Lewis]] ([[Rebecca Mader]]); the latter pair are increasingly distrusted by the survivors.  Jin realizes that Charlotte is fluent in Korean and confronts her after their successful trip, threatening to hurt Daniel if she continues to lie about her agenda and does not get Sun off the island.  Jack convinces Juliet to allow him to remain awake during the surgery with Kate holding a mirror so that he can see and direct the surgery.  As Juliet operates, Jack's consciousness proves to be a detriment and her nurse<U+2014>dentist [[Bernard Nadler]] ([[Sam Anderson]])<U+2014>knocks him out with chloroform.  The appendectomy is a success; afterwards, Juliet tells Kate that Jack really does love Kate and not Juliet.<ref name=episode>[[Edward Kitsis|Kitsis, Edward]] (writer) & [[Adam Horowitz|Horowitx, Adam]] (writer) & [[Stephen Williams (director)|Williams, Stephen]], "Something Nice Back Home".

Sawyer gives Miles a "restraining order" to keep him away from Claire as they travel to the survivors' beach camp with Claire's infant son Aaron.  On their way, Miles discovers the partially-buried bodies of [[Danielle Rousseau]] ([[Mira Furlan]]) and [[Characters of Lost#The Others|Karl]] ([[Blake Bashoff]]) and encounter [[Characters of Lost#Other Kahana crew members|Frank Lapidus]] ([[Jeff Fahey]]), who saves their lives by instructing them to hide from a nearby [[Characters of Lost#Other Kahana crew members|Martin Keamy]] ([[Kevin Durand]]) and the other mercenaries, who are on their way back to the helicopter to return to the freighter ''Kahana''.  At night, Miles watches Claire as she leaves with her deceased father Christian.  Sawyer awakes the next morning to find Aaron alone in a nearby tree and calls out for Claire with no response.<ref name=episode/>

In flashforwards, Jack has returned to work as a doctor in Los Angeles.  He is engaged to Kate and lives with her while helping to raise Aaron (William Blanchette).  Jack visits [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes]] ([[Jorge Garcia]]), who is in a mental institution.  Hurley has not been taking his medication, is hallucinating his deceased friend [[Charlie Pace]] ([[Dominic Monaghan]]) and believes that the [[Characters of Lost#Oceanic Six|Oceanic Six]] have died and gone to heaven.  Hurley gives Jack a message from Charlie: "You're not supposed to raise him."  Charlie has also told Hurley that Jack will be receiving a visitor.  On two occasions, Jack sees his father; Jack's colleague Erika Stevenson (April Parker Jones) prescribes him the anti-anxiety drug [[clonazepam]].  After overhearing a phone call, Jack becomes suspicious of Kate.  A heated argument ensues a few nights later, in which she reveals that she is doing an errand for Sawyer, who Jack says is on the island by choice.  Aaron arrives as Jack blurts out that Kate and Aaron are not related.<ref name=episode/>
