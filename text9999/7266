'''Gregorian chant''' is the central tradition of Western [[plainsong|plainchant]], a form of [[monophony|monophonic]] [[liturgy|liturgical]] chant of [[Western Christianity]] that accompanied the celebration of Mass and other ritual services. This vast repertory of chants is the oldest music known as it is the first repertory to have been adequately notated in the 10th century. In general, the chants were learnt by the [[viva voce]] method, that is by following the given example orally, which took many years of experience in the [[Schola cantorum|Schola Cantorum]]. Gregorian chant originated in Monastic life, in which singing the 'Divine Service' nine times a day at the proper hours was upheld according to the [[Rule of St Benedict|Rule of St. Benedict]]. Singing psalms made up a large part of the life in a monastic community, while a smaller group and soloists sang the chants. In its long history Gregorian Chant has been subjected to many gradual changes and some reforms. 

==History==
Gregorian chant was organized, codified, and notated mainly in the [[Franks|Frankish]] lands of western and central Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, with later additions and redactions, but the texts and many of the melodies have antecedents going back several centuries earlier. Although popular belief credits [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]] with having personally invented Gregorian chant, scholars now believe that the chant bearing his name arose from a later [[Carolingian]] synthesis of Roman and [[Gallican chant]] and that at that time the attribution to Gregory I was a 'marketing ruse' to invest it with a pedigree of Holy Inspiration in efforts to create one liturgic protocol that would be practised throughout the entire Empire. One Empire, one Church, one Chant - imposing Unity was a central issue in Carolingian days.
During the following centuries the Chant tradition was still at the heart of Church music, where it gave rise to various extensions in the sense that new performance practices had won their way in in which new music on new texts was introduced or the existing chants were extended by setting them as [[Organum]]. Even the [[polyphonic]] music that arose from the venerable old chants in the Organa by [[Leonin]] and [[Perotin]] in Paris (1160-1240) ended in [[Monophony|monophonic]] chant and in later traditions new composition styles were practised in juxtaposition (or co-habitation) with monophonic chant. This practice continued into the lifetime of [[Francois Couperin]], whose Organ Masses were meant to be performed with alternating [[homophonic]] Chant. Although it had mostly fallen into disuse after the Baroque period, Chant experienced a revival in the 19th century in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Anglo-Catholic]] wing of the [[Anglican Communion]].  
   
===Organization===
Gregorian chants are organized into eight [[musical mode|modes]]. Typical melodic features include characteristic [[incipit]]s and [[cadence (music)|cadence]]s, the use of [[reciting tone]]s around which the other notes of the [[melody]] revolve, and a vocabulary of musical motifs woven together through a process called [[centonization]] to create families of related chants.

Although the modern major and minor scales are strongly related to two of the church modes, the modern eight-tone scale is based on different harmonic principles and is organized differently from the scales of the church modes, which are based on six-note patterns called [[hexachord]]s.  The main notes in a hexachord are the ''dominant'' and the ''final''. Depending on where the final falls in the sequence of the hexachord, the mode is characterized as either ''authentic'' or ''plagal''.  Modes with the same final share certain characteristics, and it is easy to modulate back and forth between them, hence the eight modes fall into four larger groupings based on their finals.

===Notation===
Gregorian chants are notated in a graphic notation which uses a repertoire of specific signs called [[neume]]s, that captured a basic musical gesture (see [[musical notation]]). As books represented a large capital, the early chantbooks were notated with abbreviations in the text wherever possible with the neumes written over the text. In later stadia one or more lines were added, and during the 11th century this obvious need to capture also the intervals had evolved into the square notation, from which eventually modern [[staff (music)|five-line staff]] developed during the 16th century.<ref>Development of notation styles is discussed at [http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory2.htm Dolmetsch online], accessed 4&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006</ref> Gregorian chant was the central and dominating musical tradition throughout Europe and as such is at the root of musical developments that were to issue from it, as the rise of [[polyphony]] in the eleventh century.

===Singers===
Gregorian chant was traditionally sung by [[choir]]s of men and boys in churches, or by women and men of [[religious order]]s in their [[chapel]]s. It is the music of the [[Roman Rite]], performed in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the monastic [[Canonical hours|Office]]. Although Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West to become the official music of the Christian liturgy, Ambrosian chant still continues in use in Milan, and there are musicologists exploring both that and the Mozarabic chant of Christian Spain. Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship.<ref name=Catholic>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/v8.html The Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Second Vatican Council]. This view is held at the highest levels, including [[Pope Benedict XVI]]: [http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=44963 Catholic World News 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;2006]  both accessed 5&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006</ref> During the 20th century, Gregorian chant underwent a musicological and popular resurgence resulting in the creation of some of the first chant recordings by artists including [[Noirin Ni Riain]].

===Development of earlier plainchant===
Unaccompanied singing has been part of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[liturgy]] since the earliest days of the Church. Until the mid-1990s, it was widely accepted that the [[psalms|psalmody]] of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Jewish]] worship significantly influenced and contributed to [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] ritual and chant. This view is no longer generally accepted by scholars, due to analysis that shows that most early Christian hymns did not have Psalms for texts, and that the Psalms were not sung in [[synagogue]]s for centuries after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Destruction of the Second Temple]] in [[Anno Domini|AD]]&nbsp;70.<ref>David Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 484<U+2013>5.</ref> However, early Christian rites did incorporate elements of Jewish worship that survived in later chant tradition. [[Canonical hours]] have their roots in Jewish prayer hours. "[[Amen]]" and "[[alleluia]]" come from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and the threefold "[[sanctus]]" derives from the threefold "kadosh" of the [[Kedusha]].<ref>Willi Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 34.</ref>

The [[New Testament]] mentions singing hymns during the [[Last Supper]]: "When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the [[Mount of Olives]]" {{bibleverse||Matthew|26.30|NT}}. Other ancient witnesses such as [[Pope Clement I]], [[Tertullian]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius]], and [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] confirm the practice,<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 74.</ref> although in poetic or obscure ways that shed little light on how music sounded during this period.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 484-7 and James McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 72.</ref> The 3rd-century Greek "[[Oxyrhynchus hymn]]" survived with musical notation, but the connection between this hymn and the plainchant tradition is uncertain.<ref>McKinnon, James W.: "Christian Church, music of the early", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 11&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]</ref>

Musical elements that would later be used in the Roman Rite began to appear in the 3rd century. The ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', attributed to the theologian [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]], attests the singing of [[Hallel]] psalms with Alleluia as the refrain in early Christian [[agape feast|''agape'' feasts]].<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 486.</ref> Chants of the Office, sung during the canonical hours, have their roots in the early 4th century, when desert monks following [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]] introduced the practice of continuous psalmody, singing the complete cycle of 150 psalms each week. Around 375, [[antiphon]]al psalmody became popular in the Christian East; in 386, [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]] introduced this practice to the West.

Scholars are still debating how plainchant developed during the 5th through the 9th centuries, as information from this period is scarce. Around 410, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] described the [[responsory|responsorial]] singing of a [[Gradual]] psalm at Mass. At ca. 520, [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedictus of Nursia]] established what is called the rule of St. Benedict, in which the protocol of the Divine Office for monastic use was laid down. Around 678, Roman chant was taught at [[York]].<ref>James McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 320.</ref> Distinctive regional traditions of Western plainchant arose during this period, notably in the British Isles ([[Celtic chant]]), Spain ([[Mozarabic chant|Mozarabic]]), Gaul ([[Gallican chant|Gallican]]), and Italy ([[Old Roman chant|Old Roman]], [[Ambrosian chant|Ambrosian]] and [[Beneventan chant|Beneventan]]). These traditions may have evolved from a hypothetical year-round repertory of 5th-century plainchant after the western [[Roman Empire]] collapsed.

===Origins of the new tradition===
[[Image:Gregory I - Antiphonary of Hartker of Sankt Gallen.jpg|thumb|right| A dove representing the [[Holy Spirit]] sitting on [[Pope Gregory I]]'s shoulder symbolizes  Divine Inspiration]]The Gregorian repertory was systematized for use in the [[Roman Rite]]. According to [[James McKinnon]], the core liturgy of the Roman Mass was compiled over a brief period in the late 7th century. Other scholars, including Andreas Pfisterer and Peter Jeffery, have argued for an earlier origin for the oldest layers of the repertory.

Scholars debate whether the essentials of the melodies originated in Rome, before the 7th century, or in [[Franks|Francia]], in the 8th and early 9th centuries. Traditionalists point to evidence supporting an important role for [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]] between 590 and 604, such as that presented in H. Bewerung's article in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.<ref>{{ws|"[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Gregorian chant|Gregorian chant]]" in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}, article by H. Bewerung.</ref> Scholarly consensus, supported by [[Willi Apel]] and Robert Snow, asserts instead that Gregorian chant developed around 750 from a synthesis of Roman and [[Gallican chant]] commissioned by [[Carolingian]] rulers in France. During a visit to Gaul in 752<U+2013>753, [[Pope Stephen II]] had celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] using Roman chant. According to [[Charlemagne]], his father [[Pippin the Younger|Pepin]] abolished the local [[Gallican rite]]s in favor of the Roman use, in order to strengthen ties with Rome.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 79.</ref> In 785<U+2013>786, at Charlemagne's request, [[Pope Hadrian I]] sent a papal [[sacramentary]] with Roman chants to the Carolingian court. This Roman chant was subsequently modified, influenced by local styles and Gallican chant, and later adapted into the system of eight [[musical mode|modes]]. This Frankish-Roman Carolingian chant, augmented with new chants to complete the liturgical year, became known as "Gregorian." Originally the chant was probably so named to honor the contemporary [[Pope Gregory II]],<ref>McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 114.</ref> but later lore attributed the authorship of chant to his more famous predecessor Gregory the Great. Gregory was portrayed dictating plainchant inspired by a dove representing the [[Holy Spirit]], giving Gregorian chant the stamp of holy authority.  Gregory's authorship is popularly accepted as fact to this day.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 13.</ref>

===Dissemination and hegemony===
Gregorian chant appeared in a remarkably uniform state across Europe within a short time. [[Charlemagne]], once elevated to [[Holy Roman Emperor]], aggressively spread Gregorian chant throughout his empire to consolidate religious and secular power, requiring the clergy to use the new repertory on pain of death.<ref>David Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 10.</ref> From English and German sources, Gregorian chant spread north to [[Scandinavia]], [[Iceland]] and [[Finland]].<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 604.</ref> In 885, [[Pope Stephen V]] banned the [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]] liturgy, leading to the ascendancy of Gregorian chant in Eastern Catholic lands including [[Poland]], [[Moravia]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Austria]].

The other plainchant repertories of the Christian West faced severe competition from the new Gregorian chant. Charlemagne continued his father's policy of favoring the Roman Rite over the local Gallican traditions. By the 9th century the Gallican rite and chant had effectively been eliminated, although not without local resistance.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 80.</ref> The Gregorian chant of the [[Sarum Rite]] displaced [[Celtic chant]]. Gregorian coexisted with [[Beneventan chant]] for over a century before Beneventan chant was abolished by papal decree (1058). [[Mozarabic chant]] survived the influx of the [[Visigoths]] and [[Moors]], but not the Roman-backed prelates newly installed in Spain during the [[Reconquista]]. Restricted to a handful of dedicated chapels, modern Mozarabic chant is highly Gregorianized and bears no musical resemblance to its original form. [[Ambrosian chant]] alone survived to the present day, preserved in [[Milan]] due to the musical reputation and ecclesiastical authority of [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]].

Gregorian chant eventually replaced the local chant tradition of Rome itself, which is now known as [[Old Roman chant]]. In the 10th century, virtually no musical manuscripts were being notated in Italy. Instead, Roman Popes imported Gregorian chant from the German Holy Roman Emperors during the 10th and 11th centuries. For example, the [[Credo]] was added to the [[Roman Rite]] at the behest of the German emperor [[Henry II of Germany|Henry II]] in 1014.<ref>Richard Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 47.</ref> Reinforced by the legend of Pope Gregory, Gregorian chant was taken to be the authentic, original chant of Rome, a misconception that continues to this day. By the 12th and 13th centuries, Gregorian chant had supplanted or marginalized all the other Western plainchant traditions.

Later sources of these other chant traditions show an increasing Gregorian influence, such as occasional efforts to categorize their chants into the Gregorian [[musical mode|mode]]s. Similarly, the Gregorian repertory incorporated elements of these lost plainchant traditions, which can be identified by careful stylistic and historical analysis. For example, the ''[[Improperia]]'' of [[Good Friday]] are believed to be a remnant of the Gallican repertory.<ref>Carl Parrish, "A Treasury of Early Music" pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref>

===Early sources and later revisions===
The first extant sources with musical notation were written around 930 (Graduale Laon). Before this, plainchant had been transmitted orally. Most scholars of Gregorian chant agree that the development of music notation assisted the dissemination of chant across Europe. The earlier notated manuscripts are primarily from [[Regensburg]] in [[Germany]], [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]] in [[Switzerland]], [[Laon]] and [[Abbey of St. Martial|St. Martial]] in [[France]].

Gregorian chant has in its long history been subjected to a series of redactions to bring it up to changing contemporary tastes and practice. The more recent redaction undertaken in the Benedictine Abbey of St. Pierre, Solesmes, has turned into a huge undertaking to restore the allegedly corrupted chant to a hypothetical "original" state. Early Gregorian chant was revised to conform to the theoretical structure of the [[musical mode|mode]]s. In 1562&ndash;63, the [[Council of Trent]] banned most [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]]s. Guidette's ''Directorium chori'', published in 1582, and the ''Editio medicea'', published in 1614, drastically revised what was perceived as corrupt and flawed "barbarism" by making the chants conform to contemporary aesthetic standards.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 288<U+2013>289.</ref> In 1811, the French musicologist [[Alexandre-<U+00C9>tienne Choron]], as part of a conservative backlash following the liberal Catholic orders' inefficacy during the [[French Revolution]], called for returning to the "purer" Gregorian chant of Rome over French corruptions.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 622.</ref>

In the late 19th century, early liturgical and musical manuscripts were unearthed and edited. Earlier, Dom [[Prosper Gueranger]] revived the monastic tradition in Solesmes. Re-establishing the Divine Office was among his priorities, but no proper chantbooks existed. Many monks were sent out to libraries throughout Europe to find relevant Chant manuscripts. In 1871, however, the old Medicea edition was reprinted ([[Pustet]], Regensburg) which [[Pope Pius IX]] declared the only official version. In their firm belief that they were on the right way, Solesmes increased its efforts. In 1889, after decades of research, the monks of [[St. Peter's Abbey, Solesmes|Solesmes]] released the first book in a planned series, the [[Pal<U+00E9>ographie Musicale]]. The incentive of its publication was to demonstrate the corruption of the 'Medicea' by presenting photographed notations originating from a great variety of manuscripts of one single chant, which Solesmes called forth as witnesses to assert their own reforms. The monks of Solesmes brought in their heaviest artillery in this battle, as indeed the academically sound 'Paleo' was intended to be a war-tank, meant to abolish once and for all the corrupted Pustet edition. On the evidence of congruence throughout various manuscripts (which were duely published in [[facsimile]] editions with ample editorial introductions) Solesmes was able to work out a practical reconstruction.  This reconstructed chant was academically praised, but rejected by Rome until 1903, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] died. His successor, [[Pope Pius X]], promptly accepted the Solesmes chant <U+2014> now compiled as the ''[[Liber usualis]]'' <U+2014> as authoritative. In 1904, the Vatican edition of the Solesmes chant was commissioned. Serious academic debates arose, primarily owing to stylistic liberties taken by the Solesmes editors to impose their controversial interpretation of rhythm. The Solesmes editions insert phrasing marks and note-lengthening ''episema'' and ''mora'' marks not found in the original sources. Conversely, they omit significative letters found in the original sources, which give instructions for rhythm and articulation such as speeding up or slowing down. These editorial practices has placed the historical authenticity of the Solesmes interpretation in doubt.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 624<U+2013>627.</ref> Ever since the restoration of Chant was taken up in Solesmes, there have been lengthy discussions of exactly what course was to be taken. Some favored a strict academic rigour and wanted to postpone publications, while others concentrated on practical matters and wanted to supplant the corrupted tradition as soon as possible. Roughly a century later, this breach  between a strict musicological approach and the interest of the Church which is in keeping one central tradition for the congregation without too much confusing changes made to the repertory. Thus the established performance tradition since the onset of the restoration is at odds with musicological evidence. 

In his ''motu proprio'' ''[[Tra le sollicitudine]]'', Pius X mandated the use of Gregorian chant, encouraging the faithful to sing the [[Ordinary of the Mass]], although he reserved the singing of the [[proper (liturgy)|Proper]]s for males. While this custom is maintained in [[traditionalist Catholic]] communities, the Catholic Church no longer persists with this ban. [[Vatican II]] officially allowed worshipers to substitute other music, particularly modern music in the vernacular, in place of Gregorian chant, although it did reaffirm that Gregorian chant was still the official music of the Catholic Church, and the music most suitable for worship.<ref name=Catholic>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/v8.html The Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Second Vatican Council]</ref>

==Musical form==
===Melodic types===
Gregorian chant is of course vocal music. The text, the phrases, words and eventually the syllables, can be sung in various ways. The most straightforward is recitation on the same tone, which is called "syllabic" as each syllable is sung to a single tone. Likewise, simple chants are often syllabic throughout with only a few instances where two or more notes are sung on one syllable. "Neumatic" chants are more embellished and [[ligatures]], a connected group of notes, written as a single compound neume, abound in the text. [[Melismatic]] chants are the most ornate chants in which elaborate melodies are sung on long sustained vowels as in the Alleluia, ranging from five or six notes per syllable to over sixty in the more prolix melismas.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' pp. 85<U+2013>88.</ref>

Gregorian chants fall into two broad categories of melody: [[recitative]]s and free melodies.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 203</ref> The simplest kind of melody is the '''liturgical recitative'''. Recitative melodies are dominated by a single pitch, called the ''[[reciting tone]]''. Other pitches appear in melodic formulae for [[incipit]]s, partial [[cadence (music)|cadence]]s, and full cadences. These chants are primarily syllabic. For example, the [[Collect]] for [[Easter]] consists of 127 syllables sung to 131 pitches, with 108 of these pitches being the reciting note A and the other 23 pitches flexing down to G.<ref>Hoppin, ''Anthology of Medieval Music'' p. 11.</ref> Liturgical recitatives are commonly found in the [[Accentus Ecclesiasticus|accentus]] chants of the liturgy, such as the intonations of the Collect, [[Epistle]], and [[Gospel]] during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and in the direct [[psalmody]] of the [[Canonical hours|Office]].{{listen|filename=Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day.ogg|title=Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day|description=example of liturgical recitative in Gregorian chant}}

''Psalmodic'' chants, which intone [[psalms]], include both recitatives and free melodies.  Psalmodic chants include ''direct psalmody'' , ''antiphonal chants'', and ''responsorial chants''.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 81.</ref> In direct psalmody, psalm verses are sung without refrains to simple, formulaic tones. Most psalmodic chants are antiphonal and responsorial, sung to free melodies of varying complexity.
[[Image:Evora06.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Missal with Gregorian chants]]

'''Antiphonal chants''' such as the [[Introit]], and [[Communion (chant)|Communion]] originally referred to chants in which two choirs sang in alternation, one choir singing verses of a psalm, the other singing a refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''. Over time, the verses were reduced in number, usually to just one psalm verse and the [[Doxology]], or even omitted entirely. Antiphonal chants reflect their ancient origins as elaborate recitatives through the reciting tones in their melodies. Ordinary chants, such as the [[Kyrie]] and [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]], are not considered antiphonal chants, although they are often performed in antiphonal style.{{listen|filename=Loquetur Dominus.ogg|title=''Loquetur Dominus'', Introit for Week XXXIV of Ordinary Time|description=example of antiphonal psalmody in Gregorian chant}}

'''Responsorial chants''' such as the [[Gradual]], [[Alleluia]], [[Offertory]], and the Office Responsories originally consisted of a refrain called a ''respond'' sung by a choir, alternating with psalm verses sung by a soloist. [[Responsory|Responsorial]] chants are often composed of an amalgamation of various stock musical phrases, pieced together in a practice called ''[[centonization]]''. Tracts are melismatic settings of psalm verses and use frequent recurring cadences and they are strongly centonized. {{listen|filename=De profundis.ogg|title=''De profundis'', Tract for the Requiem Mass|description=example of responsorial psalmody in Gregorian chant}}

Gregorian chant evolved to fulfill various functions in the Roman Catholic liturgy. Broadly speaking, liturgical recitatives are used for texts intoned by deacons or priests. Antiphonal chants accompany liturgical actions: the entrance of the officiant, the collection of offerings, and the distribution of sanctified bread and wine. Responsorial chants expand on readings and lessons.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 123.</ref>

The non-psalmodic chants, including the [[Ordinary of the Mass]], [[Sequence (poetry)|sequence]]s, and [[hymn]]s, were originally intended for congregational singing.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 131.</ref> The structure of their texts largely defines their musical style. In sequences, the same melodic phrase is repeated in each couplet. The strophic texts of hymns use the same syllabic melody for each stanza.

===Modality===
{{main|Musical mode}}
Early plainchant, like much of Western music, is believed to have been distinguished by the use of the [[diatonic scale]]. Modal theory, which postdates the composition of the core chant repertory, arises from a synthesis of two very different traditions: the speculative tradition of numerical ratios and species inherited from ancient Greece and a second tradition rooted in the practical art of cantus. The earliest writings that deal with both theory and practice include the [[Musica enchiriadis|Enchiriadis]] group of treatises, which circulated in the late ninth century and possibly have their roots in an earlier, oral tradition. In contrast to the ancient Greek system of tetrachords (a collection of four continuous notes) that descend by two tones and a semitone, the Enchiriadis writings base their tone-system on a tetrachord that corresponds to the four finals of chant, D, E, F, and G. The disjunct tetrachords in the Enchiriadis system have been the subject of much speculation, because they do not correspond to the diatonic framework that became the standard Medieval scale (for example, there is a high F#, a note not recognized by later Medieval writers). A diatonic scale with a chromatically alterable b/b-flat was first described by Hucbald, who adopted the tetrachord of the finals (D, E, F, G) and constructed the rest of the system following the model of the Greek Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems. These were the first steps in forging a theoretical tradition that corresponded to chant. 

Around 1025, [[Guido d'Arezzo]] revolutionized Western music with the development of the ''gamut'', in which pitches in the singing range were organized into overlapping [[hexachord]]s. Hexachords could be built on C (the natural hexachord, C-D-E^F-G-A), F (the soft hexachord, using a B-flat, F-G-A^Bb-C-D), or G (the hard hexachord, using a B-natural, G-A-B^C-D-E). The B-flat was an integral part of the system of hexachords rather than an [[accidental (music)|accidental]]. The use of notes outside of this collection was described as [[musica ficta]].

Gregorian chant was categorized into eight [[musical mode|mode]]s, influenced by the eightfold division of Byzantine chants called the ''[[oktoechos]]''.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 11.</ref> Each mode is distinguished by its ''final'', ''dominant'', and ''ambitus''. The ''final'' is the ending note, which is usually an important note in the overall structure of the melody. The ''dominant'' is a secondary pitch that usually serves as a [[reciting tone]] in the melody. ''[[Ambitus (music)|Ambitus]]'' refers to the range of pitches used in the melody. Melodies whose final is in the middle of the ambitus, or which have only a limited ambitus, are categorized as ''plagal'', while melodies whose final is in the lower end of the ambitus and have a range of over five or six notes are categorized as ''authentic''. Although corresponding plagal and authentic modes have the same final, they have different dominants.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' pp. 64<U+2013>5.</ref> The existent pseudo-Greek names of the modes, rarely used in medieval times, derive from a misunderstanding of the Ancient Greek modes; the prefix "Hypo-" (under, Gr.) indicates a plagal mode, where the melody moves below the final. In contemporary Latin manuscripts the modes are simply called Protus authentus /plagalis, Deuterus, Tritus and Tetrardus: the 1st mode, authentic or plagal, the 2nd mode etc. In the Roman Chantbooks the modes are indicated by Roman numerals.

:Modes 1 and 2 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on D, sometimes called [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and [[Hypodorian mode|Hypodorian]].
:Modes 3 and 4 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on E, sometimes called [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]] and [[Hypophrygian mode|Hypophrygian]].
:Modes 5 and 6 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on F, sometimes called [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] and [[Hypolydian mode|Hypolydian]].
:Modes 7 and 8 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on G, sometimes called [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] and [[Hypomixolydian mode|Hypomixolydian]].

Although the modes with melodies ending on A, B, and C are sometimes referred to as [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]], [[Locrian mode|Locrian]], and [[Ionian mode|Ionian]], these are not considered distinct modes and are treated as [[Transposition (music)|transposition]]s of whichever mode uses the same set of hexachords. The actual pitch of the Gregorian chant is not fixed, so the piece can be sung in whichever range is most comfortable.

Certain classes of Gregorian chant have a separate musical formula for each mode, allowing one section of the chant to transition smoothly into the next section, such as the [[psalm tone]]s between antiphons and psalm verses.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 82.</ref>

Not every Gregorian chant fits neatly into Guido's hexachords or into the system of eight modes. For example, there are chants<U+2014>especially from German sources<U+2014>whose [[neume]]s suggest a warbling of pitches between the notes E and F, outside the hexachord system.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 22.</ref> Early Gregorian chant, like [[Ambrosian chant|Ambrosian]] and [[Old Roman chant]], whose melodies are most closely related to Gregorian, did not use the modal system.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 166<U+2013>78, and Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 454.</ref>  The great need for a system of organizing chants lies in the need to link antiphons with standard tones, as in for example, the psalmody at the Office.    Using Psalm Tone i with an antiphon in Mode 1 makes for a smooth transition between the end of the antiphon and the intonation of the tone, and the ending of the tone can then be chosen to provide a smooth transition back to the antiphon.  As the modal system gained acceptance, Gregorian chants were edited to conform to the modes, especially during 12th-century [[Cistercian]] reforms. Finals were altered, melodic ranges reduced, melismas trimmed, B-flats eliminated, and repeated words removed.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 608<U+2013>10.</ref> Despite these attempts to impose modal consistency, some chants<U+2014>notably Communions<U+2014>defy simple modal assignment. For example, in four medieval manuscripts, the Communion ''Circuibo'' was transcribed using a different mode in each.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 171<U+2013>2.</ref>

===Musical idiom===
Several features besides modality contribute to the musical idiom of Gregorian chant, giving it a distinctive musical flavor. Melodic motion is primarily [[steps and skips|stepwise]]. Skips of a third are common, and larger skips far more common than in other plainchant repertories such as [[Ambrosian chant]] or [[Beneventan chant]]. Gregorian melodies are more likely to traverse a seventh than a full octave, so that melodies rarely travel from D up to the D an octave higher, but often travel from D to the C a seventh higher, using such patterns as D-F-G-A-C.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 256<U+2013>7.</ref> Gregorian melodies often explore chains of pitches, such as F-A-C, around which the other notes of the chant gravitate.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 21.</ref> Within each mode, certain incipits and cadences are preferred, which the modal theory alone does not explain. Chants often display complex internal structures that combine and repeat musical subphrases. This occurs notably in the [[Offertory|Offertories]]; in chants with shorter, repeating texts such as the [[Kyrie]] and [[Agnus Dei]]; and in longer chants with clear textual divisions such as the Great Responsories, the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], and the [[Credo]].<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 258<U+2013>9.</ref>

Chants sometimes fall into melodically related groups. The musical phrases [[centonization|centonized]] to create [[Gradual]]s and [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]]s follow a musical "grammar" of sorts. Certain phrases are used only at the beginnings of chants, or only at the end, or only in certain combinations, creating musical families of chants such as the ''[[Iustus ut palma]]'' family of Graduals.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 344<U+2013>63.</ref> Several [[Introit]]s in mode 3, including ''Loquetur Dominus'' above, exhibit melodic similarities. Mode III (E authentic) chants have C as a dominant, so C is the expected reciting tone. These mode III Introits, however, use both G and C as reciting tones, and often begin with a decorated leap from G to C to establish this tonality.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 110<U+2013>113.</ref> Similar examples exist throughout the repertory.

===Notation===
{{main|Neume}}
[[Image:Neume2.jpg|thumb|270px|right| Offertory ''Iubilate deo universa terra'' in unheightened [[neume]]s.]]
The earliest notated sources of Gregorian chant (written ca. 950) used symbols called ''[[neume]]s'' (Gr. sign (of the hand) to indicate tone-movements and relative duration within each syllable. A sort of musical stenography that seems to focus on gestures and tone-movements but not the specific pitches of individual notes, nor the relative starting pitches of each neume. Given the fact that Chant was learned in an oral tradition in which the texts and melodies were sung from memory, this was obviously not necessary. The neumatic manuscripts display great sophistication and precision in notation and a wealth of graphic signs to indicate the musical gesture and proper pronunciation of the text.
Scholars postulate that this practice may have been derived from [[cheironomy|cheironomic]] hand-gestures, the [[ekphonetic]] notation of [[Byzantine chant]], punctuation marks, or diacritical accents.<ref>Levy, Kenneth: "Plainchant", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (Accessed 20&nbsp;January&nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com/shared/views/article.html?section=music.40099.2.3#music.40099.2.3 (subscription access)]</ref> Later adaptations and innovations included the use of a dry-scratched line or an inked line or two lines, marked C or F showing the relative pitches between neumes. Consistent relative heightening first developed in the Aquitaine region, particularly at [[Saint Martial|St. Martial de Limoges]], in the first half of the eleventh century. Many German-speaking areas, however, continued to use unpitched neumes into the twelfth century.  Additional symbols developed, such as the ''custos'', placed at the end of a system to show the next pitch. Other symbols indicated changes in articulation, duration, or tempo, such as a letter "t" to indicate a [[tenuto]]. Another form of early notation used a system of letters corresponding to different pitches, much as [[Shaker music]] is notated. 

[[Image:gregorian chant.gif|frame|270px|right|The ''Liber usualis'' uses square notation, as in this excerpt from the ''Kyrie eleison (Orbis factor)''.]]By the 13th century, the neumes of Gregorian chant were usually written in ''square notation'' on a four-line staff with a clef, as in the ''Graduale Aboense'' pictured above. In square notation, small groups of ascending notes on a syllable are shown as stacked squares, read from bottom to top, while descending notes are written with diamonds read from left to right. When a syllable has a large number of notes, a series of smaller such groups of neumes are written in succession, read from left to right. The oriscus, quilisma, and liquescent neumes indicate special vocal treatments, that have been largely neglected due to uncertainty as to how to sing them. Since the 1970s, with the influential insights of [[Dom. E. Cardine (see below under 'rhythm'), ornamental neumes have received more attention from both researchers and performers. 
B-flat is indicated by a "b-mollum" (Lat. soft), a rounded undercaste 'b' placed to the left of the entire neume in which the note occurs, as shown in the "Kyrie" to the right. When necessary, a "b-durum" (Lat. hard), written squarely, indicates B-natural and serves to cancel the b-mollum . This system of square notation is standard in modern chantbooks.

==Performance==
===Texture===
Chant was traditionally reserved for men, as it was originally sung by the all-male clergy during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the prayers of the [[Canonical hours|Office]]. Outside the larger cities, the number of available clergy dropped, and lay men started singing these parts. In [[convent]]s, women were permitted to sing the Mass and Office as a function of their consecrated life, but the choir was still considered an official liturgical duty reserved to clergy, so lay women were not allowed to sing in the ''[[Schola cantorum]]'' or other choirs.<ref>Carol Neuls-Bates, ''Women in Music'' p. 3.</ref>

Chant was normally sung in unison. Later innovations included ''[[Trope (music)|tropes]]'', which is a new text sung to the same melodic phrases in a melismatic chant (repeating an entire Alleluia-melody on a new text for instance, or repeating a full phrase with a new text that comments on the previously sung text) and various forms of ''[[organum]]'', (improvised) harmonic embellishment of chant melodies focusing on octaves, fifths, fourths, and, later, thirds. Neither tropes nor organum, however, belong to the chant repertory proper. The main exception to this is the sequence, whose origins lay in troping the extended [[melisma]] of [[Alleluia]] chants known as the [[jubilus]], but the sequences, like the tropes, were later officially suppressed. The [[Council of Trent]] struck sequences from the Gregorian corpus, except those for [[Easter]], [[Pentecost]], [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] and [[All Souls' Day]].

We do not know much about the particular vocal stylings or performance practices used for Gregorian chant in the Middle Ages. On occasion, the clergy was urged to have their singers perform with more restraint and piety. This suggests that virtuosic performances occurred, contrary to the modern stereotype of Gregorian chant as slow-moving mood music. This tension between musicality and piety goes far back; [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] himself criticized the practice of promoting clerics based on their charming singing rather than their preaching.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 504.</ref> However, [[Odo of Cluny]], a renowned monastic reformer, praised the intellectual and musical virtuosity to be found in chant:

{{cquote|For in these [Offertories and Communions] there are the most varied kinds of ascent, descent, repeat..., delight for the ''cognoscenti'', difficulty for the beginners, and an admirable organization... that widely differs from other chants; they are not so much made according to the rules of music... but rather evince the authority and validity... of music.<ref>Apel, p. 312.</ref>}}

True antiphonal performance by two alternating choruses still occurs, as in certain German monasteries. However, antiphonal chants are generally performed in responsorial style by a solo cantor alternating with a chorus. This practice appears to have begun in the Middle Ages.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 197.</ref> Another medieval innovation had the solo cantor sing the opening words of responsorial chants, with the full chorus finishing the end of the opening phrase. This innovation allowed the soloist to fix the pitch of the chant for the chorus and to cue the choral entrance.

===Rhythm===
Because of the obviously evasive quality of medieval notation as the silent remains of a living tradition, displaced a thousand years out of its cultural context, rhythm in Gregorian chant has always been a hotbed of debate among scholars. From the very beginning there was a fundamental difference in point of view on rhythm. To complicate matters further, a host of ornamental neumes are used in the earliest manuscripts that pose many difficulties  on the rhythmic plane. Certain neumes such as the ''pressus'', pes quassus, strophic neumes indicate repeated notes, which may indicate lengthening by repercussion, in some cases with added ornaments. By the 13th century, with the widespread use of square notation, most chant was sung with an approximately equal duration allotted to each note, although [[Jerome of Moravia]] cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened.<ref>Hiley, "Chant," ''Performance Practice: Music before 1600'' p. 44. "The performance of chant in equal note lengths from the 13th century onwards is well supported by contemporary statements."</ref>  While the standard repertory of Gregorian Chant was partly being supplanted with new forms of polyphony, the earlier melo-rhythmic refinements of monophonic chant seem to fall into disuse. Later redactions such as the ''Editio medicaea'' of 1614 rewrote chant so that melismas, with their melodic accent, fell on accented syllables.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 289.</ref> This aesthetic held sway until the re-examination of chant in the late 19th century by such scholars as Wagner, [[Joseph Pothier|Pothier]], and [[Andr<U+00E9> Mocquereau|Mocquereau]], who fell into two camps.

One school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, advocated imposing rhythmic meters on chants, although they disagreed on how that should be done. An opposing interpretation, represented by Pothier and Mocquereau, supported a free rhythm of equal note values, although some notes are lengthened for textual emphasis or musical effect. The modern Solesmes editions of Gregorian chant follow this interpretation. Mocquereau divided melodies into two- and three-note phrases, each beginning with an ''ictus'', akin to a beat, notated in chantbooks as a small vertical mark. These basic melodic units combined into larger phrases through a complex system expressed by [[cheironomy|cheironomic]] hand-gestures.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 127.</ref> This approach prevailed during the twentieth century, propagated by [[Justine Ward|Justine Ward's]] program of music education for children, until the liturgical role of chant was diminished after the liturgical reforms of [[Paul VI]],  and new scholarship "essentially discredited" Mocquereau's rhythmic theories.<ref>Dyer, Joseph: "Roman Catholic Church Music", Section VI.1, Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com] (subscription access)]</ref>

Common modern practice favors performing Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, largely for aesthetic reasons.<ref>William P. Mahrt, "Chant," ''A Performer's Guide to Medieval Music'' p. 18.</ref> The text determines the accent while the melodic contour determines the phrasing. The note lengthenings recommended by the Solesmes school remain influential, though not prescriptive.

Dom Eugene Cardine, (1905-1988) monk from Solesmes, published his 'Semiologie Gregorienne' in 1970 in which he clearly explains the musical significance of the neumes of the early chant manuscripts. Cardine shows the great diversity of neumes and graphic variations of the basic shape of a particular neume, which can not be expressed in the square notation. This variety in notation must have served a practical purpose and therefore a musical significance. Nine years later, the Graduale Triplex was published, in which the Roman Gradual, containing all the chants for Mass in a Year's cycle, appeared with the neumes of the two most important manuscripts copied under and over the 4-line staff of the square notation. The Graduale Triplex made widely accessible the original notation of Sankt Gallen and Laon (compiled after 930 AD) in a single chantbook and was a huge step forward. Dom Cardine had many students who have each in their own way continued their semiological studies, some of whom also started experimenting in applying the newly understood principles in performance practice.
The studies of Cardine and his students (Godehard Joppich, Luigi Augustoni, Marie-No<U+00EB>l Colette, Rupert Fischer, Marie-Claire Billecocq  to name a few) have clearly demonstrated that rhythm in Gregorian chant as notated in the 10th century rhythmic manuscripts (notably Skt. Gallen and Laon) manifest such rhythmic diversity and melodic/rhythmic ornamentations for which there is hardly a living performance tradition in the Western world. Contemporary groups that endeavour to sing according to the manuscript traditions have evolved after 1975. Some practising researchers favour a closer look at non Western (liturgical) traditions, in such cultures where the tradition of modal monophony was never abandoned.  

Another group with different vieuws are the mensuralists or the proportionalists, who maintain that rhythm has to be interpreted porportionately, where shorts are exactly half the longs. This vieuw is advocated by John Blackley and his 'Schola Antiqua New York'.

===Melodic restitution===
Recent developments involve an intensifying of the semiological approach according to Dom Cardine, which also gave a new impetus to the research into melodic variants in various manuscripts of chant. On the basis of this ongoing research it has become obvious that the Graduale and other chantbooks contain many melodic errors, some very consistently, (the mis-interpretation of third and eighth mode) necessitating a new edition of the Graduale according to state-of-the-art [[melodic restitution]]s. The so-called Munsterschwarzach-group under the guidance of Godehard Joppich and various other groups and individuals have done extensive work in this field. In this approach the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry a whealth of melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison between the two groups has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not so easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen. Referring to these manuscripts, he called his own transcription Gradual Lagal. Furthermore, while making the transcription, he cross-checked with the melodic manuscripts to correct modal errors or other melodic errors found in the Graduale Romanum. His intention was to provide a corrected melody in rhythmic notation but above all - he was also a choirmaster - suited for practical use, therefore a simplex, integrated notation.

==Liturgical functions==
Gregorian chant is sung in the Office during the [[canonical hours]] and in the liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Texts known as ''[[Accentus Ecclesiasticus|accentus]]'' are intoned by bishops, priests, and deacons, mostly on a single [[reciting tone]] with simple melodic formulae at certain places in each sentence. More complex chants are sung by trained soloists and choirs. The most complete collection of chants is the ''[[Liber usualis]]'', which contains the chants for the [[Tridentine Mass]] and the most commonly used Office chants. Outside of monasteries, the more compact ''[[Graduale Romanum]]'' is commonly used.

===Proper chants of the Mass===
The Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Sequence, Offertory and Communion chants are part of the [[Proper (liturgy)|Proper]] of the Mass. "Proprium Missae" in Latin refers to the chants of the Mass that have their proper individual texts for each Sunday throughout the annual cycle. As opposed to 'Ordinarium Missae' which have fixed texts (but various melodies) (Kyrie, Benedictus, Sanctus, Agnus Dei).

[[Introit]]s cover the procession of the officiants. Introits are antiphonal chants, typically consisting of an antiphon, a psalm verse, a repeat of the antiphon, an intonation of the Gloria Patri [[Doxology]], and a final repeat of the antiphon. [[Reciting tone]]s often dominate their melodic structures.

[[Gradual]]s are responsorial chants that follow the reading of the [[Epistle]]. Graduals usually result from ''[[centonization]]''; stock musical phrases are assembled like a patchwork to create the full melody of the chant, creating families of musically related melodies. Graduals are accompanied by a elaborate Verse, so that it actually consists in two different parts, A B. Often the first part is sung again, creating  a 'rondeau' A B A. At least the verse, if not the complete gradual, is for the solo cantor and are in elaborate, ornate style with long, wide-ranged melisma's.

The [[Alleluia]] is known for the ''[[jubilus]]'', an extended joyful melisma on the last vowel of 'Alleluia'. The Alleluia is also in two parts, the alleluia proper and the psalmverse, by which the Alleluia is identified (Alleluia V. Pascha nostrum) . The last melism of the verse is the same as the jubilus attached to the Alleluia. Alleluias are not sung during penitential times, such as [[Lent]]. Instead, a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] is chanted, usually with texts from the Psalms. Tracts, like Graduals, are highly centonized.

[[Sequence (poetry)|Sequence]]s are sung poems based on couplets. Although many sequences are not part of the liturgy and thus not part of the Gregorian repertory proper, Gregorian sequences include such well-known chants as ''[[Victimae paschali laudes]]'' and ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus]]''. According to [[Notker Balbulus]], an early sequence writer, their origins lie in the addition of words to the long [[melisma]]s of the jubilus of Alleluia chants.<ref>Richard Crocker, ''The Early Medieval Sequence'' pp. 1<U+2013>2.</ref>

[[Offertory|Offertories]] are sung during the giving of offerings. Offertories once had highly prolix melodies in their verses, but the use of verses in Gregorian Offertories disappeared around the 12th century. These verses however, are among the most ornate and elaborated in the whole chant repertoir. Offertories are in form closest to Responsories, which are likewise accompanied by at least one Verse and the opening sections of both Off. and Resp. are partly repeated after the verse(s). This last section is therefore called the 'repetenda' and is in performance the last melodic line of the chant.  

[[Communion (chant)|Communion]]s are sung during the distribution of the [[eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist]]. In presentation the Communio is similar to the Introitus, an antiphon with psalmverse. Communion melodies are often tonally ambiguous and do not fit into a single [[musical mode]] which has led to the same communio being classed in different modes in different manuscripts or editions.

===Ordinary chants of the Mass===
The Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei use the same text in every service of the Mass. Because they follow the regular invariable "order" of the Mass, these chants are called "[[Ordinary of the Mass|Ordinary]]."

The [[Kyrie]] consists of a threefold repetition of "Kyrie eleison" ("Lord, have mercy"), a threefold repetition of "Christe eleison" ("Christ have mercy"), followed by another threefold repetition of "Kyrie eleison." In older chants, "Kyrie eleison imas" ("Lord, have mercy on us") can be found. The Kyrie is distinguished by its use of the [[Hellenistic Greek|Greek language]] instead of Latin. Because of the textual repetition, various musical repeat structures occur in these chants. The following, Kyrie ad. lib. VI as transmitted in a Cambrai manuscript, uses the form ABA CDC EFE', with shifts in [[tessitura]] between sections. The E' section, on the final "Kyrie eleison," itself has an aa'b structure, contributing to the sense of climax.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 153.</ref>{{listen|filename=Kyrie 55, Vatican ad lib. VI, Cambrai.ogg|title=Kyrie 55, Vatican ad lib. VI, from Cambrai, Bibl. Mun. 61, fo.155v, as transcribed by David Hiley|description=example of musical repeat structures in Gregorian chant}}

The [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] recites the Greater [[Doxology]], and the [[Credo]] intones the [[Nicene Creed]]. Because of the length of these texts, these chants often break into musical subsections corresponding with textual breaks. Because the Credo was the last Ordinary chant to be added to the Mass, there are relatively few Credo melodies in the Gregorian corpus.

The [[Sanctus]] and the [[Agnus Dei]], like the Kyrie, also contain repeated texts, which their musical structures often exploit.

Technically, the [[Ite missa est]] and the [[Benedicamus Domino]], which conclude the Mass, belong to the Ordinary. They have their own Gregorian melodies, but because they are short and simple, and have rarely been the subject of later musical composition, they are often omitted in discussion.

[[Image:Salve Regina.png|thumb|left|Plainchant notation for the solemn setting of the [[Salve Regina]]. A simple setting is used more commonly.]]
===Chants of the Office===
Gregorian chant is sung in the [[canonical hours]] of the [[monastic]] Office, primarily in antiphons used to sing the [[Psalms]], in the Great Responsories of [[Matins]], and the Short Responsories of the Lesser Hours and [[Compline]]. The psalm antiphons of the Office tend to be short and simple, especially compared to the complex Great Responsories.

At the close of the Office, one of four ''[[Marian antiphon]]s'' is sung. These songs, ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'' (see top of article), ''Ave Regina caelorum'', ''Regina caeli laetare'', and ''Salve, Regina'', are relatively late chants, dating to the 11th century, and considerably more complex than most Office antiphons. Apel has described these four songs as  "among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages."<ref>Willi Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 404.</ref>

==Influence==
===Medieval and Renaissance music===
Gregorian chant had a significant impact on the development of [[medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]]. Modern staff notation developed directly from Gregorian neumes. The square notation that had been devised for plainchant was borrowed and adapted for other kinds of music. Certain groupings of neumes were used to indicate repeating rhythms called [[rhythmic mode]]s. Rounded noteheads increasingly replaced the older squares and lozenges in the 15th and 16th centuries, although chantbooks conservatively maintained the square notation. By the 16th century, the fifth line added to the [[staff (music)|musical staff]] had become standard. The [[clef#The F clef|bass clef]] and the [[Flat (music)|flat]], [[Natural sign|natural]], and [[sharp (music)|sharp]] accidentals derived directly from Gregorian notation.<ref>Chew, Geoffrey and Richard Rastall: "Notation", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (Accessed 27&nbsp;June&nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]</ref>

Gregorian melodies provided musical material and served as models for tropes and [[liturgical drama]]s. Vernacular hymns such as "Christ ist erstanden" and "Nun bitten wir den heiligen Geist" adapted original Gregorian melodies to translated texts. Secular tunes such as the popular Renaissance "[[In Nomine]]" were based on Gregorian melodies. Beginning with the improvised harmonizations of Gregorian chant known as [[organum]], Gregorian chants became a driving force in medieval and Renaissance [[polyphony]]. Often, a Gregorian chant (sometimes in modified form) would be used as a ''[[cantus firmus]]'', so that the consecutive notes of the chant determined the harmonic progression. The Marian antiphons, especially ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'', were frequently arranged by Renaissance composers. The use of chant as a cantus firmus was the predominant practice until the [[Baroque]] period, when the stronger harmonic progressions made possible by an independent bass line became standard.

The Catholic Church later allowed polyphonic arrangements to replace the Gregorian chant of the Ordinary of the Mass. This is why the Mass as a compositional form, as set by composers like [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], features a Kyrie but not an Introit. The Propers may also be replaced by choral settings on certain solemn occasions. Among the composers who most frequently wrote polyphonic settings of the Propers were [[William Byrd]] and [[Tom<U+00E1>s Luis de Victoria]]. These polyphonic arrangements usually incorporate elements of the original chant.

===20th century===
The renewed interest in [[early music]] in the late 19th century left its mark on 20th-century music. Gregorian influences in classical music include the choral setting of four chants in "Quatre motets sur des th<U+00E8>mes Gr<U+00E9>goriens" by [[Maurice Durufl<U+00E9>]], the carols of [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], and the choral work of [[Arvo P<U+00E4>rt]]. Gregorian chant has been incorporated into other genres, such as [[Enigma (musical project)|Enigma]]'s "[[Sadeness (Part I)]]", the chant interpretation of pop and rock by the German band [[Gregorian (band)|Gregorian]], the [[techno]] project [[E Nomine]], and the work of [[black metal]] band [[Deathspell Omega]]. The modal melodies of chant provide unusual sounds to ears attuned to modern scales.

Gregorian chant as plainchant experienced a popular resurgence during the [[New Age music]] and [[world music]] movements of the 1980s and '90s. The iconic album was ''[[Chant (album)|Chant]]'', recorded by the [[Benedictine]] monks of [[Silos Abbey|Santo Domingo de Silos]], which was marketed as music to inspire timeless calm and serenity. In 2008, the Cistercian Monks of Austrian [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] released the CD ''Chant<U+2013>Music for Paradise'', which became the best-selling album of the Austrian pop charts and peaked #7 of the UK charts. In the USA, the album was released under the title ''Chant<U+2013>Music for the Soul'' and peaked #187. It became [[conventional wisdom]] that listening to Gregorian chant increased the production of [[beta wave]]s in the brain, reinforcing the popular reputation of Gregorian chant as tranquilizing music.<ref>Le Mee, ''Chant : The Origins, Form, Practice, and Healing Power of Gregorian Chant'' p. 140.</ref> Gregorian chant has often been parodied for its supposed monotony, both before and after the release of ''Chant''. Famous references include the flagellant monks in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' intoning "Pie Jesu Domine." The [[asteroid]] [[100019 Gregorianik]] is [[Meanings of asteroid names|named in its honour]], using the German short form of the term.
Gregorian chanting has been also used in [[Vision of Escaflowne]] anime series.
