'''William Beverley''' (1696<U+2013>1756) was a prominent 18th-century legislator, civil servant, planter, and landowner in the [[Colony of Virginia]]. 

Born in Virginia in 1696, Beverley was the son of planter and historian [[Robert Beverley, Jr.]] (c. 1667<U+2013>1722) and his wife Ursula Byrd Beverley (1681<U+2013>1698), thus he was the scion of two prominent Virginia families. Beverley was the nephew of [[Peter Beverley]] (1668<U+2013>1728), [[List of Speakers of the Virginia House of Burgesses|Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses]], and the grandson of wealthy Virginia planter [[William Byrd I]] (1652<U+2013>1704) of [[Westover Plantation]]. Beverley's mother died at the age of 17, and he was sent to England where he received his education. 

Following his education, Beverley undertook a career in public service. He served as the Clerk of Court for [[Essex County, Virginia|Essex County]] (1716<U+2013>1745) and served in the [[House of Burgesses|Virginia House of Burgesses]] representing both [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]] (1736<U+2013>1738) and Essex County (1742<U+2013>1749). Beverley also served on the [[Virginia Governor's Council]] in 1750.

Beverley inherited an extensive estate following the death of his father in 1722 and amassed significant landholdings throughout Virginia, from which he received revenue from [[tobacco]] production and 119 tenancies. His development of the "Beverley Manor" land tract of {{convert|118941|acres|km2}} in present-day [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta County]] spurred further settlement west of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. Beverley was selected by [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] to serve as a commissioner on an expedition with [[Peter Jefferson]] to establish the [[Fairfax Line]] boundary of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]].

== Early life and education ==
William Beverley was born in 1696, the only child of [[Robert Beverley, Jr.]] (c. 1667<U+2013>1722) and his wife, Ursula Byrd Beverley (1681<U+2013>1698).<ref name="Byrd1">{{Harvnb|Byrd|1916|p=350.}}</ref><ref name="Evans1">{{Harvnb|Evans|2009|p=}}</ref> Robert Beverley, Jr., of Beverley Park plantation in [[King and Queen County, Virginia|King and Queen County]], was a wealthy planter who participated in the [[Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition]] and was the first native-born historian of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]].<ref name="Gwathmey2">{{Harvnb|Gwathmey|1979|p=174.}}</ref><ref name="McCleskey1">{{Harvnb|McCleskey|1990|p=465.}}</ref> William Beverley's father Robert wrote ''History of the Present State of Virginia'' in 1705, the first known history of Virginia to be compiled.<ref name="Wise1">{{Harvnb|Wise|1918|p=298.}}</ref> Beverley's uncle [[Peter Beverley]] (1668<U+2013>1728) served as [[List of Speakers of the Virginia House of Burgesses|Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses]].<ref name="Stanard1">{{Harvnb|Stanard|1896|p=269.}}</ref> His mother Ursula Byrd Beverley was the daughter of [[William Byrd I]] (1652<U+2013>1704) and Maria Horsmanden Byrd of [[Westover Plantation]].<ref name="Byrd1" /><ref name="Gwathmey2" /><ref name="Wise2">{{Harvnb|Wise|1918|p=309.}}</ref> Ursula was affectionately known as "Little Nutty" to her family.<ref name="Byrd1" /> William Beverley's mother Ursula died on October 31, 1698 shortly before the age of 17, and was interred at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].<ref name="Byrd1" /><ref name="Wise2" /><ref name="VHS1">{{Harvnb|Virginia Historical Society|1928|p=341.}}</ref> Through his paternal grandmother, Margaret Boyd Beverley, William Beverley was a great-grandson of Scottish noble [[James Boyd, 9th Lord Boyd]] (died 1654).

Beverley inherited an extensive estate following the death of his father in 1722, and continued building upon his father's pursuits in land speculation.<ref name="Evans1" /><ref name="VHS1"/> He accrued income through his vast landholdings, from both the harvest and production of [[tobacco]] and revenue from tenant farmers.<ref name="Evans1" /> By 1745, Beverley's estate produced 57 [[hogshead]]s of [[tobacco]].<ref name="Evans1" /> However, the income Beverley received from 119 tenant farmers on his landholdings in [[Caroline County, Virginia|Caroline]], [[Culpeper County, Virginia|Culpeper]], Orange, and King and Queen counties was far more lucrative.<ref name="Evans1" /><ref name="Glanville2">{{Harvnb|Glanville|Mays|2010|p=2.}}</ref>

Following his marriage to Elizabeth Bland around 1725, Beverley established his residence at an estate known as [[Blandfield]], which he named for his wife's family and encompassed {{convert|3450|acres|km2}} along the [[Rappahannock River]] in Saint Anne's Parish of Essex County.<ref name="Beverley2">{{Harvnb|Beverley|1914|p=297.}}</ref><ref name="Glanville1">{{Harvnb|Glanville|Mays|2010|p=1.}}</ref><ref name="VHLC2">{{Harvnb|Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission|1969|p=3.}}</ref> The Blandfield property had been granted by patent to his grandfather Major Robert Beverley, Sr. in 1683 as part of a larger tract consisting of {{convert|100000|acres|km2}}.<ref name = "Blandfield1">{{cite web |url=http://www.blandfieldplantation.com/pages/history.main.html |title= The History of Blandfield Plantation  |date=2015 |website= Blandfield Plantation |publisher= Blandfield Plantation |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}</ref> Construction of the first [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style mansion at Blandfield was probably begun around 1750 for Beverley, but is no longer standing.<ref name="VHLC2" /><ref name = "Blandfield1"/><ref name="VHLC1">{{Harvnb|Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission|1969|p=2.}}</ref> The Blandfield estate maintained its own wharves along the Rappahannock, from where the plantation's tobacco was shipped across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name="Gwathmey2" /><ref name="Glanville1" />

In addition to agricultural pursuits and land tenancies, Beverley received additional revenue from the sale of land throughout western Virginia.<ref name="Evans1" /> The alleviating of restrictive land laws by the Virginia colonial government allowed Beverley to establish his own terms with settlers on his lands.<ref name="Osborn1">{{Harvnb|Osborn|2007|p=4.}}</ref> Initially, he sold parcels of land in the [[Shenandoah Valley]].<ref name="Evans1" /> On September 6, 1736, Beverley, John Randolph, [[Richard Randolph]], and [[John Robinson (Virginia)|John Robinson]] were deeded a [[land patent]] by [[Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet]], on behalf of the [[The Crown|Crown]], for a tract of {{convert|118941|acres|km2}} on the headwaters of the [[Shenandoah River#South Fork Shenandoah River|South Fork Shenandoah River]] in present-day [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta County]].<ref name="Gwathmey2" /><ref name="McCleskey1" /><ref name="W&M1">{{Harvnb|William and Mary Quarterly|2006|p=887.}}</ref> On September 16, the Randolphs and Robinson released sole ownership of the tract to Beverley, which he planned to survey and sell as part of his land brokerage operation.<ref name="Gwathmey2" /><ref name="W&M1" /><ref name="Mulkearn1">{{Harvnb|Mulkearn|1954|p=567.}}</ref> This tract became known as "Beverley Manor."<ref name="Gwathmey2" /><ref name="McCleskey1" /><ref name="W&M1" /> The granting of this tract to Beverley spurred further settlement of the region west of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]].<ref name="Gwathmey2" /> Beverley commissioned James Patton, a ship captain from [[Ulster]], to recruit Irish and [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]] immigrants to purchase and settle his lands in Augusta County.<ref name="Evans1" /> On August 8, 1737, Beverley wrote to Captain Patton: "I should be very glad if you could import families enough to take the whole off from our hands at a reasonable price and tho' the order mentions families from Pensilvania [sic], yet families from Ireland will do as well."<ref name="Mulkearn1" /> In 1738, Beverley entrusted John Lewis of northern [[Ireland]], father of [[Thomas Lewis (Virginia)|Thomas Lewis]], with agent authority to show and sell his lands in Augusta County.<ref name="McCleskey3">{{Harvnb|McCleskey|1990|p=469.}}</ref> William Beverley donated a land lot in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] for the construction of the [[Augusta County Courthouse]] in 1748.<ref name="Gwathmey5">{{Harvnb|Gwathmey|1979|p=396.}}</ref>

By 1743, Beverley sought to acquire a land grant of {{convert|20000|acres|km2}} in the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]] on the [[Shenandoah River|Shenandoah]] and the [[Potomac River#South Branch Potomac River|South Branch Potomac]] rivers from [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]].<ref name="Evans1" /> Beverley planned to divide these Northern Neck lands among tenants and raise horses and cattle there.<ref name="Evans1" /> Beverley and other men, including [[John Robinson (Virginia)|John Robinson]] and his father, purchased {{convert|100000|acres|km2}} of land on the [[Greenbrier River]] in 1745 for further land [[speculation]] and settlement.<ref name="Evans1" /> Beverley's land sales totaled {{convert|42119|acres|km2}} by 1744, and by the time of his death in 1756, he had sold {{convert|80455|acres|km2}}, from which he earned a profit of <U+00A3>2,647.<ref name="Evans1" />
