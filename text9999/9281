One day in early summer, she makes him take her to swimming lessons<!--You sure these are lessons and not training?--><!--in the translation I read, she says "take me to swimming school"--> on his bicycle. On the way back, to avoid classmate Osamu Akaishi, who also likes Wakaba, K<U+014D> joins a sandlot baseball game. Because he has never played before, he [[Baseball positions|fields]] badly, but because he has practiced in the Tsukishima family's [[batting cage]]s since he was three years old, he hits the game-winning [[home run]].

After their joint 11th birthday, Wakaba gives K<U+014D> a plan, scheduling birthday presents for him to give her through age 20. K<U+014D>'s classmate Daiki Nakanishi makes him practice and subsequently pitch in a sandlot game against a team with Wakaba's little sister Aoba as pitcher. It is a close game, but in the end they lose. Wakaba later tells Aoba that K<U+014D> might one day pitch {{convert|160|km/h|mph|sp=us}}, Aoba's ideal in a man, but that if he does, Aoba cannot have him. At a swimming camp, Wakaba drowns while saving a younger girl. K<U+014D> knows not how to respond to this until, on the evening after her funeral, he sees Akaishi crying outside Wakaba's house, which makes him realize that he just needs to cry.

 | Summary         = Four years later, in her second year at Seish<U+016B> Junior High, Aoba is a pitcher for the school baseball team. Inspired by her and by a promise to Wakaba, K<U+014D> (in his third year) has been following Aoba's workout routine<!--He promised to follow Aoba's workout routine?--><!--Yup-->, although Aoba still hates him for having monopolized Wakaba. Starting pitcher Keiichiro Senda asks Aoba out without waiting for a response. When she does not show up, Senda goes to her house but is frightened off by the family cat.

When K<U+014D> hits four home runs at the Tsukishima batting cages, Aoba is annoyed, especially since she cannot match it. Nakanishi recruits K<U+014D> for a reunion game of their sandlot team and, with K<U+014D> [[Baseball positions|fielding]] and batting, they win in a close game. Afterward, Nakanishi learns that K<U+014D> refrained from joining the middle school team, despite his surprisingly fast [[fastball]], because Nakanishi had been excluded from it for fighting. Aoba and K<U+014D> foil a burglary, which they glimpsed from the train to school, by hitting the burglar with a baseball. However, Senda receives the credit for it. Akaishi disbelieves the foiling to be Senda's doing. He learns from Aoba that it was her who threw the ball and that K<U+014D> had been carrying it. Later, he learns from Nakanishi that he and K<U+014D> have been training.

Akaishi takes over K<U+014D>'s secret training on the condition that Nakanishi joins the high school baseball team. At the Tsukishima batting cages, an unknown boy breaks K<U+014D>'s home run record and complains that the [[pitching machine]]s are too slow. As K<U+014D> practices pitching with Akaishi as catcher, the latter tells him about a dream Wakaba had the night before she left for swimming camp. In the dream, K<U+014D> and Akaishi were playing as a [[Battery (baseball)|battery]] at [[High school baseball in Japan|K<U+014D>shien]]. During [[New Year's Eve]] Aoba's little sister Momiji gets sick, and K<U+014D> stays at their house to care for her, because Aoba is a bad nurse and cook.

Senda passes the selection test for the first-string team, but K<U+014D>, Akaishi, and Nakanishi do not take it and are put on the "prefab" second-string team<!--"Prefab hut", OK, but a "prefab team"? That needs explaining.--><!--does that help?-->. Before the summer tournament, the two teams are to hold a [[scrimmage]] that according to rumor is to determine the future of the prefab players. To surprise Coach Daimon at the scrimmage, Coach Maeno has K<U+014D> and Akaishi not use their full strength when practicing in sight of the first-stringers. Daimon recruits Aoba from the junior high team as a disposable<!--What separates a normal practice pitcher from a disposable one?--> practice pitcher, and is surprised when she almost strikes Azuma out even after pitching too much. Afterward, Aoba tells K<U+014D> that she will continue pitching for the first-stringers to learn their batting weaknesses. While the prefab team prepares for the scrimmage, Maeno approves Akaishi's proposed strategy and lineup.

 | Summary         = The night before the scrimmage, K<U+014D> asks Aoba's opinion of his pitching, because, he says, he has never played in an official game and so has no comparison for it. She calls it not bad,<!--This reads as if "not bad" belonged into quotation marks. Maybe you could reword it to avoid the word "calls"?--><!--why not just use the quotation marks? it's what she says--> which pleases him. He then makes a bet with her that he will keep the first-stringers from scoring more than five runs. After Senda, the starting pitcher for the first-string team, allows the prefab team to get three runs in the second inning, Daimon kicks him off the team and Maeno substitutes him in as [[shortstop]] for the prefabs. Though Daimon is confident that his batters can hit against an unknown pitcher even without his coaching, K<U+014D>'s pitching speed and Aoba's data on their batters cause trouble for the first-string players, with the exception of Azuma. Because of his lack of experience and stamina, K<U+014D> tires out quickly. In the fifth inning, he tells catcher Akaishi that he can have either speed or control, but not both. Akaishi has him go for speed and, despite his erratic pitches, the first-stringers still have trouble hitting. Even though his batters' difficulties, Daimon persists on seeing K<U+014D> as a nobody for being on the prefab team, which to him is nothing but a cesspool. In the [[Inning#Baseball|bottom]] of the sixth inning, Azuma hits his third home run, putting the first-string team up 5 to 3.<!--wouldn't scores, being measures, always be numerals?-->

 | Summary         = After prefab player Mikihara is tagged out<!--"Tagged out"?--> while running for home, Senda reveals that Daimon will not promote anyone to first-string, no matter how well they play, but Maeno convinces Mikihara to play his best anyway, for pride alone. At the bottom of the seventh, first-string center-fielder<!--"Center-fielder"?--> Miki<!--Who is Miki?--> notices that if K<U+014D> had [[Base on balls|walked]] Azuma, the prefabs would be ahead three to one. At the top of the ninth, K<U+014D> [[Run batted in|bats]] in two runners, tieing the game. While on base, he tells Azuma that he did not think that the latter would hit the pitches, which he hit home runs off. At the bottom of the ninth, K<U+014D> strikes Azuma out, but gives up a game-winning double<!--"Double"?--> to the next batter.

A few days later, K<U+014D> helps the spoiled first-string manager shop for a day in return for the last available teapot which is the 16th birthday gift on Wakaba's schedule of presents, which K<U+014D> had promised to buy her. While Seish<U+016B>'s first-string team plays in the prefectural [[High school baseball in Japan|summer baseball tournament]], Maeno takes the prefab team on an intensive training camp in the mountains. K<U+014D> forgets a suitcase and Aoba takes it to him by bus. She is misdirected by K<U+014D>'s father and a local woodcutter and gets lost in a thunderstorm. Eventually, she is found by K<U+014D> and Senda. Maeno tells Aoba that the other players are training hard because they have become fans of K<U+014D>. Because Miki ignored Daimon's instructions to make a play, he is left out of the Seish<U+016B> lineup in the round-of-16 game.

 | Summary         = Without Miki [[Batting (baseball)|batting]], Seish<U+016B> fails to reach the quarterfinals. After the game, Aoba meets Junpei Azuma, Y<U+016B>hei Azuma's older brother, who drives her home and becomes a regular suitor of her older sister, Ichiy<U+014D>. Aoba and K<U+014D> visit the swimming pool, where they are reminded of swimming with Wakaba. Daimon learns that the prefab team has been playing against other teams but dismisses it as they lost all six games. However, Azuma learns that they were playing against teams, who all reached the quarterfinals or better in the summer tournament.

The interim principal, who has been backing Daimon, orders the prefab team dissolved. However, Maeno proposes to instead hold a rematch scrimmage with the losing team's coach losing his job. Daimon agrees. Because of his differences with Daimon, Miki transfers out. The prefab players recruit Aoba to play center field for the scrimmage. Before the scrimmage, Azuma deliberately injures himself to avoid playing and tells Daimon to prove that he has enough other good players to take him to K<U+014D>shien. Daimon says that he will overlook this<!--Azuma injuring himself or him saying what he said?--><!--it's ambiguous in context, it looks like both--> and that the interim principal will not honor the agreement with Maeno anyway.

As the scrimmage starts, the school chairman, who is also the grandfather of the prefab team's manager, tells Daimon and the interim principal that he ratifies the coaching wager. The first two innings, K<U+014D> lets the bases get [[Bases loaded|loaded]] before striking out the next three batters. To get him settled down, Akaishi tells K<U+014D> to pitch as if they were in extra innings and a single [[Run (baseball)|run]] would lose the game. By the middle of the sixth inning, the game is scoreless.

 | Summary         = Daimon tells the interim principal not to worry, as the first-string pitcher is throwing a [[perfect game]]. However, at the top of the seventh, the pitcher starts tiring. Aoba hits a [[Single (baseball)|single]], then scores off Senda's [[Batted ball|fly ball]]. The chairman tells the interim principal that he has heard about irregularities in the school's finances and that he trusts that his faith in Daimon's winning program was well placed. Azuma tells Daimon that they need more batters like Miki, as K<U+014D> is an even better pitcher than he was during the first scrimmage and the best they have faced all year. In the bottom of the ninth, K<U+014D> strikes out all three first-string batters, winning the game.

Daimon is fired and many of his picked players follow him to another school. Azuma stays and begins [[Boarding house|living with]] the Kitamuras because the baseball dorm is closed down. When Azuma asks him about a photograph of Wakaba, K<U+014D> admits that he was in love with her. In response to Junpei asking about it, K<U+014D> says that he based his pitching form on Aoba's. He then learns from her that Junpei's promising career as a pitcher was ended by an injury. That winter, Aoba goes on a date with five boys at once to get them to stop asking her out. The spoiled manager has the team help her learn how to pitch for an audition for the movie adaptation of ''[[Idol Ace]]'', and when she gets a supporting role quits the team.<!--I thought she already knew how to pitch. Also, who leaves the team, Aoba or the spoiled manager?--> During K<U+014D>'s first visit to Aoba's maternal grandparents since Wakaba's death, K<U+014D> and Aoba are reminded of her. The following spring, Aoba's cousin, Mizuki Asami, comes to live with the Tsukishimas.

 | Summary         = At the start of the school year, Aoba and Mizuki enter Seish<U+016B> High School. Aoba joins the baseball team, which pleases Akaishi and Maeno even though she cannot play in regulation games. Mizuki expresses an interest in Aoba and wonders whether K<U+014D>'s fastball has reached 160&nbsp;km/hr. Several girls ask Mizuki out. He turns them down, claiming to be in love with Aoba, and tells some irate boys that the rumor that Aoba is going out with K<U+014D> is false. During their first practice game of the season, Aoba is the starting pitcher. When K<U+014D> takes over, Akaishi tells him not to throw too hard just to compete. Mizuki takes Aoba to a movie that she once saw with Wakaba, though Aoba refuses to call it a date. Afterwards, Mizuki puts up anonymous posters at school, which claim that he and Aoba are a couple. After watching Aoba and K<U+014D> squabble, Ichiy<U+014D> notes their similarity. Aoba tries to set a classmate up with K<U+014D> and is annoyed when he turns her down.

K<U+014D>, Akaishi, Azuma, and Nakanishi scout a practice game of the local favorite team, Ryu<U+014D> Academy, where they meet Miki, who is also scouting Ryu<U+014D> for another school. For Wakaba's 17th birthday, K<U+014D> buys the scheduled shiny pendent. When the prefectural tournament schedule is announced, Ryu<U+014D> is seeded first and Seish<U+016B> is bracketed to play them in their third game.

 | Summary         = Seish<U+016B>'s first game of the tournament is [[Mercy rule#Baseball and softball|called]]<!--"Called"?--><!-- this is the best link I can find; need more? --> in the fifth inning. Afterward, K<U+014D> catches pitches for Aoba, who was for the first time not allowed to play, because she is a girl. A scout for their next opponent, Sann<U+014D>, overhears Akaishi and Nakahara discuss their own team's weaknesses. Seish<U+016B> has trouble the first couple innings handling Sann<U+014D>'s [[bunt]]ing,<!--I happen to know what bunting is, but it's too much jargon none the less. Please reword it.--><!--I'm stumped by this one, and have no idea how--> however, with K<U+014D>'s fielding, they hold them to only one run. Sann<U+014D>'s coach describes a pitcher who can strike out bunters as a player seen only once every ten years. When Seish<U+016B> starts scoring in the sixth, Maeno attributes this to Seish<U+016B>'s players being too inexperienced to have consistent weaknesses.

After Seish<U+016B> wins 8<U+2013>1, the newspaper coverage highlights K<U+014D>'s {{convert|150|km/h|mph|adj=on|sp=us}} fastball. When Mizuki comments that K<U+014D> has not reached 160&nbsp;km/hr, Aoba says that she wanted many things when she was a child. In a flashback, Wakaba describes her final dream to Aoba, which includes Aoba playing center field at Koshien.

The game against the first-seeded Ryu<U+014D> begins. In the first inning, both pitchers retire<!--"Retire"?--> three straight batters, but Azuma hits a home run at the top of the second. Ryu<U+014D>'s star batter, Shimano, who forced his coach to keep the team's other strong batter, Mishima, on the bench to keep attention on himself, manages to hit a single, but is [[left on base]]. At the bottom of the third, Seish<U+016B> is leading 1<U+2013>0.

In the seventh inning, with the score unchanged, K<U+014D> strikes out his tenth batter. Shimano breaks a finger while catching Azuma's hit and is replaced by Mishima who, when Ryu<U+014D> next bats, hits a [[Home run#Grand slam|solo home run]] to tie the game. At the top of the ninth, Senda hits a single, thus ensuring that both teams' best hitters, Azuma and Mishima, will bat again. As Azuma comes to bat with two outs, Ryu<U+014D> sends out a [[relief pitcher]], who intentionally walks Azuma before striking out Akaishi. K<U+014D> starts sacrificing control for speed to pitch for Mishima, who manages to hit a blazing [[line drive]] that K<U+014D> catches. The game goes into extra innings. At the bottom of the tenth, with two out and a runner on second, Ryu<U+014D>'s pitcher hits a line drive that K<U+014D>, with his arm still affected by Mishima's hit, fails to catch. Ryu<U+014D> scores, winning the game. Aoba, who had been enthusiastically cheering K<U+014D>'s pitching, is disappointed but manages to smile at K<U+014D> afterward.

Akane wins that year's K<U+014D>shein poster art contest with a picture based on photos of Aoba, which K<U+014D> had used to model his pitching after. Azuma tells Aoba that the only girl he would consider going out with is her. For [[Valentine's Day]], Aoba has K<U+014D> give Azuma chocolates from her. Akane tells K<U+014D> that she will give him chocolates if he shows her a photo of Wakaba. Azuma later says to K<U+014D> that he likes Aoba because she is hard to figure out, because she is not true to herself. When Akane sees photos of K<U+014D> and Wakaba together, she comments on how obvious it is that Wakaba loved him and that she would still love him today. Then she gives him belated Valentine's chocolate.

Azuma accidentally hits Aoba with a [[line drive]] during practice, breaking her leg. Because he feels guilty about it, he stops hitting hard during practice. To keep Aoba occupied in the hospital, K<U+014D> brings her a ball and a glove. Akaishi gives Akane tickets to a [[kabuki]] performance and tells her that K<U+014D> likes it. Then he gives K<U+014D> a book to study up on it. K<U+014D> goes with her on his first date and afterwards brings Akaishi kabuki-themed snacks. When Aoba is discharged, Azuma starts hitting hard again. Ryu<U+014D> wins the spring K<U+014D>shein tournament.

When she and Azuma go home together, Nakanishi calls her hospital stay a boost to their<!--Whose relationship?--><!--the only antecedent they in the sentence, Aoba and Azuma--> relationship. In return for the kabuki play, Akane gives Akaishi and K<U+014D> [[mobile phone charms]] she made. When Aoba teaches K<U+014D> new [[breaking pitch]]es, Azuma describes this as her way of climbing onto the mound at K<U+014D>shien, using K<U+014D>'s body. Akane starts working as a waitress at the Tsukishima's cafe. One night, K<U+014D> escorts her home, because she thinks that she is being followed by a stalker, who is actually interested in Aoba. In return for her coaching, K<U+014D> gives Aoba a garish t-shirt, which, to his surprise, she thanks him for. After Ichiy<U+014D> agrees to marry Junpei Azuma if Seish<U+016B> makes it to K<U+014D>shein, he joins the team an enthusiastic assistant coach.<!--I don't understand this sentence.--><!--better?--> Akane tells Aoba that she was sickly as a child and envied active girls like her. When Junpei and Aoba scout Ryu<U+014D> before the summer prefectural tournament, he asks what she thinks of Azuma but she cannot answer.<!--Why can't she answer?--><!--why is never stated; it's *implied* that it's because her feelings are confused, but stating so is OR--> For K<U+014D>'s 18th birthday, both Akane and Aoba give him cake and he buys the scheduled, slightly expensive earrings for Wakaba.

 | Summary         = The brackets for the summer prefectural tournament are announced, which have Seish<U+016B> meeting former head coach Daimon's current school in the second round. A younger player tells K<U+014D> that the team has gotten a lot better because of Aoba's influence and gets K<U+014D> to confirm that she and Azuma are not yet officially dating. As a result, various members of the team ask Aoba out based on whether they perform well during Seish<U+016B>'s first game.<!--Please clarify.--><!--took a stab at it, danged awkward tho'--> Akane tells Aoba that she and K<U+014D> are a lot alike and that if she learns to love herself, she will be able to see what Wakaba saw in K<U+014D>. Seish<U+016B>'s first game is called after five innings, but only K<U+014D> makes his promised goal to Aoba by striking out 10 batters. Daimon's team plays Sena, an unknown school led by Miki, the player he drove off the Seish<U+016B> team, and loses in a close game. Azuma tells Aoba that  to understand her popularity, she needs to recognize her good points.<!--This seems clumsy, though I can't really improve upon it either.--><!--how's that?--> In the game against Sena, Seish<U+016B> gets on base<!--"On base"?--> several times but fails to score through seven innings, while not allowing Sena any [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. Azuma tells K<U+014D> that Miki has not factored Aoba's influence on the younger Seish<U+016B> players and in the bottom of the eighth, one of them hits a three-run homer. In the ninth, Miki hits a home run, preventing K<U+014D> from pitching a no-hitter. Seish<U+016B> wins 3 to 1.

 | Summary         = Seish<U+016B> continues advancing in the tournament. Based on Aoba's coaching, K<U+014D> adjusts his form during his next game, which sacrifices control but gives him a speed near 160&nbsp;km/h. Afterward, K<U+014D> tries to explain to reporters Aoba's importance even though she cannot play. Akane enters the hospital for testing for an unspecified illness, which disturbs Akaishi's focus during Seishu's quarterfinal game. When he and Aoba visit the hospital after their win, Akane tells them she promised to go on a date with K<U+014D> after the tournament, and that she may require surgery. In the semifinal, Seish<U+016B> faces Nishikura, a team that has come from behind to win every game by one run. Senda and Akaishi hit home runs as [[leadoff batter]]s the first two innings, and Nishikura scores one run in the first. In the eighth inning, with Nishikura having failed to get on base since the second inning, Seishu scores six runs and the game is called for Seish<U+016B>, 8 to 1. After the game, K<U+014D> finally visits Akane in the hospital, where she tells him her surgery will be the morning of Seish<U+016B>'s final game against heavily favored Ryu<U+014D>, and asks he not tell Akaishi this. K<U+014D> and Aoba visit Wakaba's grave together, where K<U+014D> prays that Akane's surgery goes well, and Aoba tells him Wakaba would forgive him if he went out with Akane. At practice, Aoba jokingly asks Azuma out to a movie, and he accepts, saying he seriously likes her.
