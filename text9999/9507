The '''Canadian Council for Israel and Jewish Advocacy (CIJA)''' was founded in 2004 as the principal advocacy, oversight and co-ordinating body for a number of [[Jewish Canadian]] organizations including the [[Canada-Israel Committee]] (and the Quebec-Israel Committee), the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]]/[[United Jewish Appeal]] and [[National Jewish Campus Life]]. It is the advocacy arm of the [[United Israel Appeal]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite news | author =David Noble | title =The New Israel Lobby in Action | publisher =Canadian Dimension  | date =November 1, 2005 | url =http://canadiandimension.com/articles/1890 | accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref>

The CIJA's chief executive officer is [[Hershell Ezrin]] who has been in this position since the organization's inception.<ref>{{cite news | author =Sheldon Gordon | title =Head of New Canadian Council To Organize Grassroots Efforts | publisher =The Forward  | date =February 27, 2004 | url =http://www.forward.com/articles/6426/ | accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref>

CJIA's lobbying and outreach efforts have included meetings and functions that attract high-ranking members of the Canadian government, including the prime minister, and it has financed trips to Israel for Canadian officials and thought leaders.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title =Harper to deliver mini-throne speech to group | publisher =CTV.ca  | date =February 5, 2007 | url =http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070205/harper_speech_070205/20070205?hub=Politics | accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author =Sheldon Kirshner | title =Canadian university presidents visit Jewish state | publisher =Canadian Jewish News  | date =July 30, 2008 | url =http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15083&Itemid=101 | accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> The CIJA's creation has been criticized as an attempt to "corporatize" the funding structure of Jewish community organizations and tie them to pro-[[Israel]] advocacy.<ref>{{cite news | author =Isi Leibler | title =Candidly Speaking: Canadian Israel advocacy in turmoil | publisher = Jerusalem Post | date =September 20, 2008 | url =http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1221745575447&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull | accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref>

In April 2008, CIJA was at the center of a global controversy when [[Iran]] objected to its receiving [[non-governmental organization]] accreditation for a [[United Nations]] conference on [[racism]]; CJIA withdrew its accreditation request.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title =Iran seeks to block Canadian NGO | publisher =Jewish Telegraphic Agency  | date =April 22, 2008 | url =http://jta.org/news/article/2008/04/22/108198/canadairan | accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref>
