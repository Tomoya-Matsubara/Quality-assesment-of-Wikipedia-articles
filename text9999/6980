The '''lobed stingaree''' (''Urolophus lobatus'')  is a common [[species]] of [[Myliobatiformes|stingray]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Urolophidae]], [[endemism|endemic]] to southern [[Western Australia]] in shallow, [[inshore]] sand and [[seagrass]] [[habitat]]s. This species is plain sandy in color above and has a broad, rounded [[pectoral fin]] disc. It is characterized by an enlarged, semicircular skin lobe of unknown function on the inner rim of each nostril. Its tail is slender, with lateral skin folds and a lance-like [[caudal fin]] but no [[dorsal fin]]. The maximum recorded width is {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=on}}.

A [[benthic]] [[predator]], the lobed stingaree feeds mostly on [[crustacean]]s, and to a much lesser extent on small [[bony fish]]es, [[polychaete worm]]s, and [[mollusc]]s. It is [[aplacental viviparous]], with females typically bearing a single pup every October or November after a [[gestation period]] of ten months. Developing [[embryo]]s are nourished by maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk") after they exhaust their supply of [[yolk]]. In the northern portion of its range, the lobed stingaree is frequently [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by [[trawler]]s. Though it generally survives the experience, it has a tendency to abort its young when captures. However, this species is not greatly affected by human activity overall, and it has been listed under [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).

==Taxonomy==
Australian [[ichthyologist]] [[R. J. McKay|Roland McKay]] described the lobed stingaree in an 1966 issue of the ''Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia'', giving it the [[specific epithet]] ''lobatus'' in reference to its unique nasal lobes. The [[type specimen]] was collected from a depth of {{convert|31|-|33|m|ft|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Rottnest Island]] off Western Australia.<ref>{{cite journal |title=McKay, R.J. |date=1966 |title=Studies on Western Australian sharks and rays of the families Scyliorhinidae, Urolophidae and Torpedinidae |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=65&ndash;82}}</ref>

==Description==
The lobed stingaree has a rounded [[pectoral fin]] disc much wider than long, with nearly straight leading margins. The snout is fleshy and forms an obtuse angle; the tip may protrude slightly past the disc. The medium-sized eyes are followed by teardrop-shaped [[spiracle]]s, which have a rounded posterior margin. The outer posterior corner of each nostril forms a visible lobe. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed trailing margin; the front corners of the curtain are enlarged into distinctive, semicircular lobes. The mouth is small and contains 9&ndash;10 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor; a handful of papillae are also found on the lower jaw.<ref name="last and stevens"/> The small teeth have roughly oval bases. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are short. The [[pelvic fin]]s are small and rounded.<ref name="last and compagno">{{cite book |author=Last, P.R. and L.J.V.

The tail is slender and very flattened, measuring 87&ndash;100% as long as the disc and bearing a prominent horizontal skin fold on either side. There is a dorsally positioned, serrated stinging spine near the [[caudal fin]], which is long, narrow, and leaf-shaped. There is no [[dorsal fin]]. The skin entirely lacks [[dermal denticle]]s. This species is yellowish brown above, becoming slightly lighter at the lateral margins of the side, and white below; some individuals have irregular blotches and/or a dark stripe along the dorsal midline of the tail. The caudal fin becomes dark towards the tip..<ref name="last and stevens"/> Males and females can grow up to {{convert|24|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=on}} across respectively.<ref name="iucn"/>

==Biology and ecology==
Almost 90% of the food volume consumed by the lobed stingaree consists of [[crustacean]]s, in particular [[mysid]]s, [[amphipod]]s, [[shrimp]]s, and [[cumacea]]ns, which are captured on or just above the bottom. This species also feeds on [[polychaete]] worms, small [[bony fish]]es, and rarely [[mollusc]]s. Rays smaller than {{convert|19|cm|in|abbr=on}} across take relatively more mysids, amphipods, and cumaceans, while larger rays take more shrimps and fishes, and have a more diverse diet overall. Its dietary composition also shifts seasonally, mostly reflecting the greater availability of shrimp in summer and fall and cumaceans in winter and spring.<ref name="platell et al"/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Partitioning of food resources amongst 18 abundant benthic carnivorous fish species in marine waters on the lower west coast of Australia |author=Platell, M.E. and I.C.

Like other stingrays, the lobed stingaree is [[aplacental viviparous]]. Females have a single functional [[uterus]], on the left, and an annual reproductive cycle. [[Mating]] occurs in November and October and [[ovulation]] from mid-November and mid-January, implying that the females store [[sperm]] internally for 1&ndash;3 months before [[fertilization]]. The [[gestation period]] lasts ten months; although up to six eggs may be fertilized, usually only a single pup (rarely two) develops to term. The embryo is initially nourished by an external [[yolk sac]]; by five months of age, the embryo measures {{convert|5.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and has transferred most of the remaining yolk into its [[digestive tract]]. By six months of age, the mother begins to deliver nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") through thread-like extensions of the uterine [[epithelium]] called "trophonemata", which grow into the mouth, gills, and spiracles of the embryo. The disc and tail of the embryo are folded to hug the sting next to the body. Birthing occurs in late October or early November, with the newborns measuring around {{convert|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} across. Females grow more slowly and to a larger ultimate size than males. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached by males at around {{convert|16|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and two years of age, and by females at around {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and three years of age. The [[maximum lifespan]] is 12 and 14 years for males and females respectively.<ref name="iucn"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=White, W.T., M.E. Platell, and I.C.

==Human interactions==
The lobed stingaree is often [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by [[scallop]] and prawn [[trawl]]ers operating off [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Mandurah]] in the northern part of its range. It usually survives to be released alive, though stingarees have a tendency to abort their young upon capture. As the number of vessels that catch this species is small, and it faces no other significant conservation threats within its range, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has assessed the lobed stingaree as of [[Least Concern]]. It would would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.<ref name="iucn"/>
