'''HMAS ''Yarra'' (U77)''', named for the [[Yarra River]], was a [[Grimsby class sloop|''Grimsby'' class]] sloop of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) that served during World War II. Commissioned in 1936, ''Yarra'' spent the early part of the war in Australian waters, then was transferred to the [[East Indies Station]] in 1940. The sloop operated in the Red Sea, then was involved in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] and the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]. After operating as part of the [[Tobruk Ferry Service]] in the Mediterranean during November, ''Yarra'' was reassigned to Southeast Asia in response to Japanese attacks. On 4 March 1942, ''Yarra'' was attacked and sunk by a force of Japanese cruisers and destroyers while attempting to protect ships withdrawing to Australia.

''Yarra'' was laid down by the [[Cockatoo Island Dockyard]] at Sydney, New South Wales on 24 May 1934, launched on 28 March 1935 by the wife of Archdale Parkhill, Minister for Defence,{{citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=cite does not cover launching lady}} and commissioned into the RAN on 21 January 1936.<ref name=Bastock132>Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 132</ref>

==Operational history==
In December 1939, ''Yarra'' was attached to the [[20th Minesweeping Flotilla (Australia)|20th Minesweeping Flotilla]].<ref name=Bastock132/> On 28 August 1940, the sloop sailed from Fremantle for service on the [[East Indies Station]].<ref name=Bastock132/> She arrived in Aden on 18 September, then was assigned to convoy operations in the Red Sea.<ref name=Bastock132/>

On 20 October, ''Yarra'' was part of the escort for Allied convoy BN 7.<ref name=Bastock132/> The convoy was [[Attack on convoy BN 7|attacked]] by a force of Italian destroyers; these were driven off, with [[Italian destroyer Francesco Nullo|Italian destroyer ''Francesco Nullo'']] forced aground.<ref name=Bastock132/> During the action, two torpedoes were fired by the Italians at ''Yarra''; the sloop successfully evading both.<ref>O'Hara, ''Struggle for the Middle Sea'', p. 103</ref>

From March until April 1941, ''Yarra'' was docked at Bombay for refitting.<ref name=Bastock132/> On 12 April, the sloop joined the escort of Convoy BP7<ref>Lyman, ''Iraq 1941'', p. 28</ref> from Karachi to the Persian Gulf.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} After arriving in the gulf, ''Yarra'' became involved in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]].<ref name=Bastock132/> During August, the ship operated in Iranian waters in support of the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Anglo-Soviet invasion]].<ref name=Bastock132/> The sloop secured several ports and oil-producing facilities, sank the sloop [[Iranian sloop Babr|''Babr'']], and was involved in the capture of two Iranian gunboats and the Italian ship ''Hilda''.<ref>Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', pp. 132-3</ref> In November, the sloop was transferred to the Mediterranean, and operated as part of the [[Tobruk Ferry Service]].<ref name=Bastock133>Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 133</ref>

In December, the Japanese declaration of war saw ''Yarra'' reassigned to Southeast Asia.<ref name=Bastock133/> She ledt Alexandria on 9 December, and reached Java on 11 January 1942, where she commenced convoy escort duties.<ref name=Bastock133/> On 5 February, the sloop escorted a convoy to Singapore; the last convoy to arrive before the city was [[Battle of Singapore|captured by the Japanese]].<ref name=Bastock133/> While en route, the convoy was attacked by Japanese aircraft: ''Yarra'' shot down one and damaged several others, then rescued over 1800 soldiers from the burning troopship {{SS|Empress of Asia}}.<ref name=Bastock133/> On 6 February, the sloop left Singapore with a southbound convoy.<ref name=Bastock133/> ''Yarra'' left the convoy when near Palembang to take up the tow of the disabled destroyer {{HMAS|Vendetta|D69|2}}, with the two ships reaching Tanjong Priok.<ref name=Bastock133/>

==Loss==
The deterioration of the Allied position in Southeast Asia promoted a general withdrawal south.<ref name=Bastock133/> On 2 March, ''Yarra'' arrived at Tjilatjap with the depot ship ''Anking'', the tanker ''Francol'', and the minesweeper MMS-51: the sloop was ordered to escort the other three ships to Fremantle.<ref name=Bastock133/> A day later, the ship rescued forty survivors of the Dutch ship ''Paragi'' from liferafts.<ref name=Bastock133/>

Early on 4 March 1942, the convoy encountered a Japanese fleet: the cruisers ''[[Japanese cruiser Atago|Atago]]'', ''[[Japanese cruiser Takao|Takao]]'', and ''[[Japanese cruiser Maya|Maya]]'', accompanied by four destroyers.<ref name=Bastock133/> ''Yarra''{{'}}s commander, [[Robert William Rankin]], laid down a smokescreen, then ordered the convoy to scatter while the sloop held off the Japanese warships.<ref name=Bastock133/> Despite the efforts of ''Yarra'', the other three Allied ships were pursued and sunk, and the sloop was sunk by cruiser gunfire shortly after 08:00, with only 34 survivors from the ship's company and the ''Paragi'' rescuees.<ref name=Bastock133/> Attrition reduced the number of survivors to 13 by the time they were rescued on 9 March by the [[Netherlands submarine K-XI|Dutch submarine ''K-XI'']].<ref name=Bastock133/>

The sloop's wartime service was later recognised with two [[battle honour]]s: "Libya 1941" and "East Indies 1942".<ref name=newhonours>{{cite news |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |title=Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=honourslist>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |title=Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref>
