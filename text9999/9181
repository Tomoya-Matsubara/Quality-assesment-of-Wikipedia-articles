==History==

The date that ''New Mill'' was built is not known, but is thought to have been in the mid eighteenth century. A windmill was recorded at [[Walton on the Hill]] in 1295, The earliest in Surrey. A windmill at Tadworth was sold in 1600 and a windmill on [[Banstead|Banstead Common]] was mentioned in a survey of the Manor of Banstead for Sir [[Nicholas Carew]] in 1680. An Act of Parliament in 1755 mentions the windmill, which was marked on Rocque's map of 1762. The mill lost two sails in 1893, and worked by wind until 1902, latterly assisted by a [[steam engine]]. Another post mill<ref name=Old>Presumably called the ''Old Mill''</ref> stood close by until 1890.<ref name=Book>{{cite book | last = Farries, Kenneth G and Mason, Martin T| year = 1966| title = The Windmills of Surrey and Inner London| pages = p208-210| publisher = Charles Skilton| location = London}}</ref>

The second pair of sails fell off in a drought in 1921. The mill was damaged by a bomb in 1941 and again by a [[V-1 flying bomb|flying bomb]] in 1944. Repairs were carried out in 1950.<ref name=Book/> Recently, concerns have been raised about the condition of the mill, and basic repairs are planned.<ref name=Stag>{{cite web| url= http://www.s-t-a-g.co.uk/| publisher =Save Tadworth Action Group| title = HELP SAVE OUR WINDMILL!| accessdate= 2008-05-17}}</ref>
