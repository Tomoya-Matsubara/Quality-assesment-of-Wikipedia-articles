'''Prairie Avenue''' is a north<U+2013>south thoroughfare on the [[South side (Chicago)|South Side of Chicago]], which historically extended from 16th Street in the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], to the city's southern limits and beyond. The street has a rich history from its origins as a major trail for horseback riders and [[carriage]]s. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a six-[[City block|block]] section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago's elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes part of the historic [[Prairie Avenue District]], which was declared a [[Chicago Landmark]] and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Several of Chicago's most important [[history of Chicago|historical figures]] have lived on the street. This is especially true of the period of recovery from the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 when many of the most important families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the [[political history of Chicago|political history]], the [[Chicago architecture|architecture]], the [[culture of Chicago|culture]], the [[economy of Chicago|economy]], as well as the [[law and government of Chicago]]. The street has over time been influenced by the [[demographics of Chicago]].

The importance of the street has declined, but it still has landmark buildings and is the backbone of an historic district. Preservation battles regarding various properties on the street have been notable with one having been chronicled on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''. As of 2009, the street is being redeveloped to host valuable and important condominiums. Recently, developments have extended the street north to accommodate new high-rise condominiums, such as [[One Museum Park]], along [[Roosevelt Road (Chicago)|Roosevelt Road]] (12th Street).  The redevelopment has extended the street so that it has prominent buildings bordering [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] with Prairie Avenue addresses.

Prairie Avenue once served as an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trail linking [[Fort Dearborn]] to [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] in [[Indiana]] and thus derived its name from the vast [[midwest]]ern [[prairie]] land between the two endpoints.<ref name=SCRS/> In 1812, the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] occurred in the area that is now the northern section of the street, in what is known as the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago School of Architecture Foundation |coauthors=Prairie Avenue Historic District Committee |title=Prairie Avenue Historic District |accessdate=2007-11-14|date=June 1975 }}</ref> Casualties of the battle, such as [[William Wells (soldier)|William Wells]] and [[George Ronan]], were struck down here.<ref name="Kinzie Gordon">{{cite book |title=The Fort Dearborn Massacre |last=Kinzie Gordon |first=Nelly |year=1912 |publisher=[[Rand McNally & Co.]] |location=Chicago |isbn= |page=56}}</ref>

Over time, the district has evolved from an upscale neighborhood to a factory district and back to an upscale neighborhood. Zoning in 1853 anticipated residential development, although only one grand villa existed at the time. By 1877 the eleven-block area of Prairie Avenue as well as Calumet Avenue housed elite residences. By 1886 the finest mansions in the city, each equipped with its own carriage house, stood on Prairie Avenue.<ref name=NC>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11413.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Conzen, Michael P, Douglas Knox and Dennis McClendon|title=Neighborhood Change: Prairie Avenue, 1853-2003|work=[[The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago]]|year=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]}}</ref> In the 1880s and 1890s, mansions for [[George Pullman]], [[Marshall Field]], John J.

By 1911, warehouses and factories cramped the Prairie Avenue District. Large industry overtook the district by 1950. Early 21st century deindustrialisation, urban congestion, and historic preservation have brought the return of trendy buildings, and restored as well as renovated structures.

In the 1850s, railroad related industries prospered near the lumber district along the South Branch of the [[Chicago River]]. Thus, the business district began to supplant the elegant residences along [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan]] and Wabash Avenues south of Jackson Boulevard.<ref name="EOC562">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/877.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=McClendon, Dennis|title=Near South Side|work=[[The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago]]|year=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]}}</ref> Shortly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the city's wealthy residents settled on Prairie Avenue due to its proximity to the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] less than a mile away and the fact that traveling there did not involve crossing the [[Chicago River]].

During the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s, upper Prairie Avenue residents were central to cultural and social fabric of the city. The economy was supported by the thousands of jobs created by the [[Pullman Car Company]] and [[Armour and Company]]. Chicago's richest man, Marshall Field, changed the buying habits of the city. John Shorthall saved the property from total chaos after the [[Great Chicago Fire]] by saving property records. At one point in the 1880s, sixteen of the 60 members of the [[Commercial Club of Chicago]] lived on Prairie Avenue.  [[George Armour]] headed the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, which became the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/10431.html|accessdate=2007-10-19|title=The Worlds of Prairie Avenue|work=[[The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago]]|year=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]}}</ref>  1801 South Prairie resident, [[William Wallace Kimball]], employed about 1500 people around the start of the 20th century in his organ and piano manufacturing company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2740.html|accessdate=2008-05-12|title=Kimball (W.

As a home to many of Chicago's leading families, Prairie Avenue became the base of many important political movements. Woman's [[suffrage]] had activists, such as Illinois Women Suffrage Association President Jane Jones, on Prairie Avenue.  ''Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State of Illinois'', {{ussc|146|387|1892}}, pitted the public welfare of the city against the railroad industry and was the foundation for the public trust doctrine which facilitated the city's reclamation of much of the lakefront. Prairie Avenue residents bolstered other efforts to fight against the railroads. The concentration of wealth also made Prairie Avenue the target of complaints about taxation inequities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410065.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|title=Prairie Ave Gallery: Prairie Avenue Politics|work=[[The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago]]|year=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]}}</ref>

Many of these leading families also took part in [[philanthropy]].  John Shorthall, founder of Chicago Title & Trust and Prairie Avenue resident, created the Illinois Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and convened local and state societies to unite under a national organization ([[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]) that could combine its political strength and lobby Congress. The [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] was a successor entity of the Armour Institute of Technology, which was an outgrowth of the generosity of Philip and [[Joseph Armour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410062.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|title=Prairie Ave Gallery: Philanthropies|work=[[The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago]]|year=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]}}</ref>

==Preservation==
Historic preservation in Chicago has saved some of the city's architectural heritage. The efforts of the [[Chicago Architecture Foundation]] and the [[Landmarks and Preservation Council of Illinois]] have been at the forefront of these efforts. The [[Commission on Chicago Landmarks]] (now part of the city's Department of Planning and Development) has designated the Prairie Avenue Historic District as a city landmark.<ref name="EOC383">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/586.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Sciacchitano, Barbara|title=Historic Preservation|work=[[The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago]]|year=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]}}</ref>

In 2000, the [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]]-designed 1907 [[Georgian Revival]] Platt Luggage Building at 2301 South Prairie was the subject of preservation debates when [[McCormick Place]] attempted to tear it down to build a parking garage.  The conflict, which was not settled before [[Wrecking ball|wrecker]]s had knocked a hole in a corner of the building and which included protests and a petition to the [[Illinois Supreme Court]], was described on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/12/us/chicago-girds-for-big-battle-over-its-skyline.html|title=Chicago Girds for Big Battle Over Its Skyline|accessdate=2009-09-24|date=2000-11-12|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Rozhon, Tracie|page=1}}</ref> Preservationists, including the [[Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois]] and the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], eventually dropped their appeals once the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority committed to incorporating the original [[facade]] of the building into the exterior of the parking garage at an additional cost of $2.5&nbsp;million to the project.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB4249FDB556378&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Platt's preservation is sweet, but there's a bitter aftertaste|accessdate=2009-09-24|date=2000-10-06|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Bey, Lee|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB486EBC6FD2A92&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Platt Building's Western Facade Only To Be Spared Demolition|accessdate=2009-09-24|date=2000-10-06|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Mendell, David|page=3}}</ref>

In 2003, the area redevelopment was well underway. [[Deindustrialization]] and [[urbanization]] had pushed out [[manufacturing]]. As a result, factories were generally demolished, or converted to [[loft apartment]] buildings. Some neglected mansions survive as restored or renovated properties in the historic district.<ref name=NC/> Today, Prairie Avenue is undergoing a redevelopment that includes [[One Museum Park]] (1215 South Prairie Avenue) and [[One Museum Park West]] (1201 South Prairie Avenue).  These Prairie Avenue addresses border the [[Roosevelt Road]] side of [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]].  One Museum Park is the tallest building on [[Chicago's South Side]] and among the [[List of tallest buildings in Chicago|tallest buildings in Chicago]].<ref name=EMP/> It surpassed [[340 on the Park]] as the tallest all-residential building in Chicago,<ref name=EMP>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&lng=3&id=133771|title=One Museum Park|accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=[[Emporis.com]]}}</ref> and it is second to the [[Trump World Tower]] in the United States.

<!--Today, the most prominent historic portion of Prairie Avenue from 16th to Cermak, and the surround Prairie District is undergoing transformation including restoration of the Marshall Field Jr. Mansion, construction of the Commonwealth Historic Prairie Avenue Homeowners Association mansions, restoration of The Wheeler Mansion (south Calumet ave), and more projects.  Additionally, streetscape improvements are completed or planned through support of the Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance, including the cul-de-sac improvements in the 1900 Block of Prairie Avenue.

The Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance, made up of residents in and around the Prairie District and South Michigan Avenue Corridor, is the sole resident and community organization recognized by the City of Chicago for the areas from 15th Street to Cermak, and Lakeshore drive west to beyond Michigan Avenue. The Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance brings neighbors together in order to build a sense of community, preserve the integrity of the neighborhood's historic character, address issues of the neighborhood, provide the neighborhood with an effective communication link with the Alderman, developers, government officials and other influential groups, and to empower residents to work together in improving the neighborhood. In 2008, the PDNA, in support from 2nd Ward Alderman R Fioretti and Mayor Richard Daley host the 30 year celebration of the inaugural Prairie District Landmarking with the Festival on Prairie Avenue.-->
