The '''''Conte di Cavour''''' class was a [[battleship]] class of the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. They were preceded by the single-ship {{ship|Italian battleship|Dante Alighieri||2}} class of battleships, and followed by the {{Sclass|Andrea Doria|battleship|4}}.

==Background==
This class was the first large group of [[dreadnought]]s in the ''Regia Marina'', being preceded by the battleship ''Dante Alighieri'', and followed by the ''Andrea Doria'' class.<ref name=hore174-176>Hore, pp. 174-176</ref><ref name=jackson14/> The ships were designed by Admiral and Engineer-General [[Edoardo Masdea]].<ref name=jackson16>Jackson, p. 16</ref>
==Design==
===Armor===
Critics thought that, in the Italian tradition of warship construction and design, the armor of this class of ships was to light. This was remedied during the 1933-1937 reconstruction, when the [[Pugliese system]] of armor was fitted. During the reconstruction horizontal armor was thickened to {{convert|135|mm|in|disp=flip}}, and the vertical side armor was thickened by {{convert|50|mm|in|disp=flip}}.<ref name=hore175>Hore, p. 175</ref>
===Armament===
[[File:Conte di Cavour class main weapon.svg|thumb|left|300px|Original main armament layout]]
The main armament at construction consisted of 13<U+00D7>{{convert|12|in|mm}} (or {{convert|12.6|in|mm}}) guns in five turrets. Three triple turrets were installed in A,Q and Y positions and two twin turrets were installed in B and X positions. The guns were an [[Armstrong Whitworth]] design. At the time, this was just one gun less than the number carried by the Brazilian ''Rio de Janeiro'' (later the British battleship {{HMS|Agincourt|1913|2}}), the then most heavily armed battleship in the world.<ref name=hore175 />

===Propulsion===
The pre-reconstruction machinery for all three ships consisted of a four shaft direct drive turbine arrangement with 20 boilers. The post-reconstruction machinery, however, consisted of a four shaft direct drive turbine arrangement with 8 oil fired boilers.<ref name=hore244>Hore, p. 244</ref><ref name=jackson14/><ref name=jackson16/>
==Reconstruction==
The first two ships, ''Conte di Cavour'' and ''Giulio Cesare'', underwent an extensive reconstruction program during the interwar period between World War I and World War II. A new bow section was added which added {{convert|34|ft|m}} to their length. The horsepower was tripled. The ships were converted from a four shaft direct drive turbine machinery to two shafts and the number of boilers was decreased from 20 to 8. The type of boilers used in the engines was also changed. The maximum speed was increased by {{convert|6|kn|mph km/h}}. The center turret was removed, and the superstructure was completely rebuilt. The {{convert|12|in|mm}} guns were removed in favor of {{convert|12.6|in|mm}} guns.<ref name=hore244/>

The class was composed of three ships, all laid down in 1910 and completed in 1914-15:

*''Conte di Cavour'' (reconstructed before World War II)
*''Giulio Cesare'' (reconstructed before World War II)
*''Leonardo da Vinci'' (sunk during World War I)
===''Conte di Cavour''===
{{main|Italian battleship Conte di Cavour}}
The ''Conte di Cavour'' was designed in 1908, launched 10 August 1911, and completed in 1914. She was named after the [[Count#In Italy|Count]] [[Camillo Benso di Cavour]], who was a statesman and one of the architects of the unification of Italy. She was extensively rebuilt between 1933 and 1937. She served in World War I, but did not see any action until World War II.<ref name=hore175/><ref name=jackson14>Jackson, p. 14</ref>

She served in the southern [[Adriatic Sea]] during World War I, but saw no action. In 1919, she sailed to the [[United States of America]] on a cruise. In 1923, she participated in supporting operations while Italian troops occupied the island of [[Corfu]].<ref name=jackson14/>

The ''Conte di Cavour'' took part in the [[Battle of Calabria]] (also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo) on 9 July 1940, in which she and her sister ship ''Giulio Cesare'' engaged the British battleships {{HMS|Warspite||6}}, {{HMS|Malaya||2}}, {{HMS|Royal Sovereign||2}}, and the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Eagle||2}}. ''Warspite'' hit ''Giulio Cesare'' at extreme range, and the Italian battleships retreated. [[Admiral Cunningham]], commander of the British fleet, gave chase, and pursued the Italians to within sight of [[Calabria]].<ref name=hore42>Hore, p. 42</ref><ref name=hore244/>

On 11 November 1940, ''Conte di Cavour'' was at anchor in the Taranto naval base when she was attacked, along with the other warships, by [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from the [[Royal Navy|British]] [[aircraft carrier]] {{ship|HMS|Illustrious}}. One of the Swordfish, piloted by [[Lieutenant Commander|Lt. Cdr.]] K. Williamson, passed over the stern of the {{ship|Italian battleship|Diga di Tarantola}} and released its torpedo at the [[destroyer]] {{ship|Italian destroyer|Fulmine||2}}. The torpedo missed its intended target, but hit the ''Conte di Cavour'' and exploded against her. The ''Conte di Cavour'' soon sank and settled on the bottom.<ref name=hore244/><ref name=jackson14/>

She was later raised and towed to [[Trieste]] for repairs, sunk again by the Italians to prevent her falling into [[Nazi Germany|German]] hands, raised again by the Germans in September 1943, but sunk again by the [[USAAF]] during a 1945 air raid. Her wreckage was broken up at the end of World War II and scrapped in 1951.<ref name=hore244/><ref name=jackson14/>
===''Giulio Cesare''===

{{main|Italian battleship Giulio Cesare}}
The ''Giulio Cesare'', like the ''Conte di Cavour'', was also designed in 1908, but launched 15 October 1911. She was also extensively redesigned 1933-1937. She similarly served during World War I, but did not see any action until World War II.<ref name=hore175/><ref name=jackson16/>

During World War I, she also, like the ''Conte di Cavour'', served in the Adriatic Sea, but saw no action during the war.<ref name=jackson16/>

During World War II, she saw early action against the British [[Mediterranean fleet]]. She took part in the [[Battle of Calabria]] (also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo) on 9 July 1940, in which she and her sister ship ''Conte di Cavour'' engaged the British battleships HMS ''Warspite'', ''Malaya'', ''Royal Sovereign'', and the aircraft carrier HMS ''Eagle''. ''Warspite'' hit ''Giulio Cesare'' from {{convert|26000|yd|m ft}} with a {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} shell, and the Italian battleships retreated. [[Admiral Cunningham]], commander of the British fleet, gave chase, and pursued the Italians to within sight of [[Calabria]].<ref name=hore42/><ref name=hore244/>

The ''Giulio Cesare'' was also engaged in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] on 27 November 1940 against [[Force H]] and the British battleships {{HMS|Renown||6}} and {{HMS|Ramillies||2}}.<ref name=hore244 />

She was damaged by a near miss in a air raid at [[Naples]] in January 1941.<ref name=jackson16 /> 

She also participated in the [[First Battle of Sirte]] on 17 December 1941, against British cruisers and destroyers.<ref name=hore244 /><ref name=jackson16 />
===''Leonardo da Vinci''===

{{main|Italian battleship Leonardo da Vinci}}
The ''Leonardo da Vinci'' was launched 1911, completed in 1915, and served during World War I but unlike her sister ships, she did not survive to serve during World War II, but was sunk by an internal magazine explosion at [[Taranto]] harbor in 1916. She was raised, but scrapped in 1921. This explosion was blamed on saboteurs, but was more likely was the result of an accident resulting from unstable ammunition.<ref name=hore175/>
