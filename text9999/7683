[[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] '''Sir Henry Wells''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (22 March 1898 &ndash; 20 October 1973) was a senior officer in the [[Australian Army]]. Serving as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] from 1954 to 1958, Wells' career culminated with his appointment as the first [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee]], a position marking him as the professional head of the Australian Military. He served in this capacity from March 1958 until March 1959, when he retired from the army.

Born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Wells' career in the Australian Army began in 1916 when he entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]]. Graduating as a lieutenant three years later, he served in a variety of staff and instructional positions before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. Initially posted to the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] as a staff officer in 1940, Wells was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made senior liaison officer to [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]]. Serving in [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his leadership at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]]. Transferred to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]] in 1943 as a brigadier, he served in the [[New Guinea Campaign]] with the headquarters of [[II Corps (Australia)|II Corps]] and later in the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaign]] with I Corps.

Wells was promoted to major general in 1946 and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff. Following promotion to lieutenant general, he was made Commander-in-Chief, [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea]] from 1953 to 1954, serving during the last days of the war. In retirement, Wells was a director of several companies. Aged 75, he died in 1973.

==Early life and career==
Wells was born in the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] town of [[Kyneton, Victoria|Kyneton]] on 22 March 1898,<ref name="WWII">{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&VeteranID=789658|title=Wells, Henry|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=8 March 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}</ref> the youngest of seven children to Arthur Wells, a [[draper]], and his wife Elizabeth (n<U+00E9>e Carter). Educated at [[Kyneton Secondary College|Kyneton High School]], Wells entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in February 1916, where he was a keen sportsman. Graduating from the college in December 1919, he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[First Lieutenant|lieutenant]] in the Australian Army, and posted to [[England]] for further training.<ref name="ADB">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Andrews|first=E. M.|year=2002|id=A160617b|title=Wells, Sir Henry (1898 &ndash; 1973)|accessdate=8 March 2009}}</ref>

On his return to Australia, Wells was appointed as [[adjutant]] and [[quartermaster]] of the 8th Light Horse Regiment in 1921. The following year, he was allocated to the 9th Light Horse Regiment. In February 1926, Wells was briefly appointed [[brigade major]] of the 6th Cavalry Brigade, before becoming an instructor at the Small Arms School, Sydney, during July. On 14 December that year, Wells married Lorna Irene Skippen in a ceremony at St John's Church of England, [[Cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]]; the couple would later have two sons.<ref name="ADB"/>

During 1927, Wells was assigned to the Royal Military College, Duntroon as a company commander and promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]] that December. Returning to the Small Arms School as an instructor in 1931, he was dispatched to England and attended the [[Staff College, Camberley]] between 1935 and 1936. Arriving back in Australia, Wells was made adjutant and quartermaster of the 4th/3rd Battalion, and later brigade major of the [[1st Brigade (Australia)|1st Infantry Brigade]]. During 1938, he was reposted to Royal Military College, Duntroon as a lecturer in [[Military tactics|tactics]].<ref name="ADB"/>

==Second World War==
===Greece and North Africa===
On 15 May 1940, Wells transferred to the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] for active service during the Second World War.<ref name="WWII"/> Promoted to [[major]], he was posted to the headquarters of the 7th Division. Wells proceeded with the division to the [[Middle East]], where, on arriving in December, he was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] and posted as senior liaison officer to I Corps.<ref name="ADB"/> During this time, the Australian [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]] and I Corps Headquarters were diverted for service in the [[Battle of Greece|Greek Campaign]].<ref name="Long34"/>

Wells arrived in Greece on 7 March 1941, with an advance party of Lieutenant General [[Thomas Blamey|Sir Thomas Blamey's]] I Corps staff.<ref name="Long34">{{Harvnb|Long|1953|p=34}}</ref> On 10 April, a plan was formulated to withdraw Greek and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops from their positions in the [[Verria]] pass of the [[Vermion Mountains]] to the River [[Aliakmon]]. To carry this out, Blamey despatched Wells to coordinate the movement of the 12th Greek Division west to its new position.<ref>{{Harvnb|Long|1953|p=54}}</ref><ref name="OBERecommendation">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7682462|title=Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)<U+2014>Image details<U+2014>Wells, Henry<U+2014>30 December 1941|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view full pdf of original recommendation|accessdate=8 March 2009}}</ref> The withdrawal began on 12 April, but the force's movement was hampered due to lack of vehicles and the division did not arrive until late evening the following day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Long|1953|p=65}}</ref> During this time, Wells travelled between I Corps Headquarters and the 12th Greek Division, organising and coordinating the division's movement, despite frequent air attacks on the roads.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="OBERecommendation"/>

General [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|Sir Henry Maitland Wilson]]&mdash;the British commander in Palestine and [[Transjordan]]&mdash;believed that I Corps' loss of transport and signal equipment precluded it from participating in the campaign from the outset.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1953|pp=340&ndash;341}}</ref> Instead, Wilson attempted to exercise command from the [[King David Hotel]]. This proved to be a serious error, as his staff were preoccupied with political and administrative issues, and were too remote from the battlefields to exercise the close command required.<ref>{{Harvnb|Long|1953|p=527}}</ref> Following a series of reverses, I Corps headquarters was sent for on 18 June, and Lieutenant General [[John Lavarack]] assumed command that day. The headquarters was confronted by a difficult situation, with almost all reserves committed. Lavarack began regrouping his force, concentrating the 7th Division for a decisive thrust towards [[Beirut]]. Hard fighting was required before the campaign was brought to a successful conclusion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Long|1953|pp=413&ndash;414}}</ref>

Promoted to [[colonel]], Wells became General Staff Officer, 1st Grade (GSO1), to the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]] in November 1941.<ref name="ADB"/> As such, he was the 9th Division's chief of staff, responsible for the full range of staff activities.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|p=544}}</ref> On 28 June 1942, Wells accompanied Lieutenant General [[Leslie Morshead|Sir Leslie Morshead]]&mdash;Commander of the 9th Division&mdash;to [[Cairo]], where they received orders tasking the 9th Division with the defence of Cairo.

The brigade was lacking in equipment, and Wells spent that day arranging equipment for the unit as well as overseeing its preparation; the brigade moved forward the next day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|pp=551&ndash;552}}</ref> The divisional headquarters proceeded to El Alamein on 7 July, and was posted to the northern flank of the British front line.
