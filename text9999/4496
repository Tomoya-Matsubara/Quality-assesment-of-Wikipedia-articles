The '''Star of Bethlehem''', also called the '''Christmas Star''',<ref>"[http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast16May_1.htm A Christmas Star for SOHO]". Retrieved 4 July 2008.</ref> is a star in [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition that revealed the birth of [[Jesus]] to the [[Biblical Magi|magi]] (or "wise men") and later led them to [[Bethlehem]]. According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]],<ref name="Matt211">{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:11|NKJV}}</ref> the magi were men "from the east" who were inspired by the appearance of the star to travel to [[Jerusalem]] in search of a [[king of the Jews]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:1<U+2013>2|NKJV}}</ref> There they met King [[Herod the Great|Herod]] of [[Judea]], who advised them that the child they sought was in [[Bethlehem]], a nearby village. While the magi were on their way to Bethlehem, the star appeared again. Following the star, it stopped this time above the place where Jesus was born.  The magi found Jesus with his mother, paid him homage, worshipped him and gave gifts. They then returned to their "own country".<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:11<U+2013>12|NKJV}}</ref>

[[Christians]] generally regard the star as a miraculous [[sign]] given by God to mark the birth of the Christ (or [[Messiah]]). Some [[theologians]] claimed that the star fulfilled a prophecy, known as the [[Star Prophecy]]. In modern times, [[astronomers]] have proposed various explanations for the star. A [[nova]], a [[planet]], a [[comet]], an [[occultation]], and a [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] (massing of planets) have all been suggested. The star has also been interpreted as an astrological event.

Many scholars question the historicity of the story, regarding the star as a pious fiction created by the author of the Gospel of Matthew. <ref>For example, Paul L. Maier, "Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem", in ''Chronos, Kairos, Christos II'', Mercer University Press (1998), 171; [[Geza Vermes]], ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', London, Penguin, 2006, p22;  [[E.

==Biblical narrative==
The [[Gospel of Matthew]] states that magi ([[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''magoi'', usually translated as "wise men" but in this context probably meaning "astronomer" or "astrologer"<ref>Raymond Edward Brown, ''An Adult Christ at Christmas: Essays on the Three Biblical Christmas Stories'', Liturgical Press (1988), page 11; ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'', Eerdmans (2000), page 844.</ref>) arrived at the court of Herod in Jerusalem and told the king of a star which signified the birth of the King of the Jews:

<blockquote>
<p>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, ''Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East'' [or ''at its rising''] ''and have come to worship Him.'' When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:1<U+2013>4|NKJV}} [[New King James Version]] (1982).</ref></p>
</blockquote> 

Herod was "troubled" when the magi told him that a "king of the Jews" had been born because that was one of his own titles, conferred by the [[Roman Senate]].<ref>Thomas G. Long, ''Matthew'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1997), page 18.</ref> He understood this phrase to refer to the Messiah, a leader of the Jewish people whose coming was foretold in Old Testament prophecy. So he asked his advisors where the Messiah would be born.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:4|NKJV}}.</ref> They answered Bethlehem, birthplace of King [[David]], and quoted the [[prophet]] [[Book of Micah|Micah]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:5<U+2013>6|NKJV}}. The Old Testament version of this prophecy can be found at {{bibleverse||Micah|5:2<U+2013>4|NKJV}}.</ref> The king passed this information along to the magi.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:8|NKJV}}.</ref>

[[Image:Chartres2006 039.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Adoration of the Magi'', [[Chartres Cathedral]], by Jehan de Beauce, France, 16th century.]]
<blockquote>
<p>
:::::::::::::Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, ''Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also.'' When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:7<U+2013>10|NKJV}}.</ref></p>
</blockquote>

Matthew's account suggests that the magi knew from the star that the "king of the Jews" had already been born even before they arrived in Jerusalem. The magi presented Jesus with gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]].<ref name="Matt211"/> In a dream, the magi were warned not to return to Jerusalem, so they "left for their own country by another road".<ref name="Matt212">{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:12|NKJV}}.</ref> When Herod realized that he had been tricked, he [[Massacre of the Innocents|ordered the execution of all male children in Bethlehem]] age 2 and under, based on the information the magi had given him concerning the time the star first appeared.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:16|NKJV}}.</ref> Joseph, warned in a dream, takes his family to Egypt for their safety.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:13--14|NKJV}}.</ref> After Herod dies, God calls Joseph and his family back from Egypt, which is said to fulfill the prophecy, "Out of Egypt I called My Son."<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:16|NKJV}}. The Old Testament version is at {{bibleverse||Hosea|11:1|NKJV}} and refers the departure of the Hebrews from Egypt under [[Moses]]. This suggests that Matthew sees the life of Jesus as recapitulating the story of the Jewish people,[http://biblemeanings.info/Words/Place/Egypt.htm] which begins with God showing [[Abraham]] the stars in the sky. {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:5|NKJV}}</ref>

==Interpretations and explanations==
===Fulfillment of prophecy===
The ancients believed that astronomical phenomena were connected to terrestrial events. Miracles were routinely associated with the birth of important people, including the [[Hebrew]] [[patriarchs]], as well as [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] heroes.<ref name="Vermes">{{Citation

<blockquote>
<p>If, then, at the commencement of new dynasties, or on the occasion of other important events, there arises a comet so called, or any similar celestial body, why should it be matter of wonder that at the birth of Him who was to introduce a new doctrine to the human race, and to make known His teaching not only to Jews, but also to Greeks, and to many of the barbarous nations besides, a star should have arisen? Now I would say, that with respect to comets there is no prophecy in circulation to the effect that such and such a comet was to arise in connection with a particular kingdom or a particular time; but with respect to the appearance of a star at the birth of Jesus there is a prophecy of Balaam recorded by Moses to this effect: ''There shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a man shall rise up out of Israel.''<ref name="Origen2">{{cite web

The magi are sometimes called "kings" because of the belief that they fulfill a prophecy by [[Isaiah]] concerning a journey to Jerusalem by gentile kings.<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|60:1<U+2013>7|NKJV}}.</ref> In the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation Matthew probably used, this prophecy mentions gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, the same gifts the magi presented to Jesus.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:11|NKJV}}</ref> In the [[Book of Daniel]], the magi ([[Aramaic]] ''mag'', [[Septuagint]] ''magoi'') are portrayed as an association of scholars in [[Babylon]].<ref>See {{bibleverse||Daniel|1:20|NKJV}}, {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|NKJV}}, {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:48|NKJV}}, {{bibleverse||Daniel|4:1|NKJV}}, {{bibleverse||Daniel|4:9|NKJV}}, {{bibleverse||Daniel|5:11|NKJV}}.</ref> Daniel, who in the book is selected chief magus, was considered "one of the greatest prophets" by the Jews, according to Josephus.<ref>{{cite web

While Origen argued for a naturalistic explanation, [[John Chrysostom]] viewed the star as purely miraculous: "How then, tell me, did the star point out a spot so confined, just the space of a manger and shed, unless it left that height and came down, and stood over the very head of the young child? And at this the evangelist was hinting when he said, ''Lo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.''"<ref>{{cite book

===Astronomical object===
The magi told Herod that they saw the star "at its rising",<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:2|NKJV}}.</ref> which suggests that they observed an astronomical object.

In 1614, [[Germany|German]] astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] determined that a series of three conjunctions of the planets [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] occurred in the year 7 BC.<ref name="Mosley1"/> Although conjunctions were important in [[astrology]], Kepler was not thinking in astrological terms. He argued that a planetary conjunction could create a [[nova]], which he linked to the Star of Bethlehem.<ref name="Mosley1"/> Modern calculations show that there was always a significant gap between the two planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient almanac has been found in [[Babylon]] which covers the events of this period, but it makes no specific reference to the conjunctions.<ref name="MarkKidger">{{cite web

Chinese and Korean stargazers observed an object thought to be a nova or a [[comet]] around 5 BC.<ref name="MarkKidger"/> This object was observed for over seventy days with no movement recorded.<ref name="MarkKidger"/> Ancient writers described comets as "hanging over" specific cities, just as the Star of Bethlehem was said to have "stood over" the "place" where Jesus was (presumably the town of Bethlehem).<ref name="Jenkins">Jenkins, R.M., [http://www.bristolastrosoc.org.uk/uploaded/BAAJournalJenkins.pdf "The Star of Bethlehem and the Comet of AD 66"], ''Journal of the British Astronomy Association'', June 2004, '''114''', pp. 336<U+2013>43.</ref> This phrase was not used to describe other astronomical objects, so perhaps the tail of a comet was thought to point to a specific terrestrial location.

Another Star of Bethlehem candidate is [[Uranus]], which passed close to Saturn in 9 BC and Venus in 6 BC. This is unlikely because Uranus moves very slowly and is only dimly visible.<ref>{{cite book

A recent hypothesis states that the star of Bethlehem was a supernova or hypernova occurring in the nearby [[Andromeda Galaxy]]. Although supernovae have been detected in Andromeda, it is extremely difficult to detect a supernova remnant in another galaxy, let alone obtain an accurate date of when it occurred.<ref>Tipler, F.J.,[http://www.math.tulane.edu/~tipler/starofbethlehem.pdf The Star of Bethlehem: a Type Ia/Ic Supernova in the Andromeda Galaxy].  Dept. of Mathematics and Dept. of Physics, Tulane University; New Orleans, LA 70118. 20 March 2005.[]</ref>

===Astrological event===
The use of the phrase "king of the Jews" by the magi has led many writers to link the Star of Bethlehem to astrology. In [[Hellenistic]] astrology, [[Jupiter]] was the king planet and [[Regulus]] (in the constellation [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]]) was the king star.<ref name="Newman1">Newman, Robert C., [http://ibri.org/DVD-1/Papers/StarofBethlehem/75starbethlehem.htm "The Star of Bethlehem: A Natural-Supernatural Hybrid?"], Interdisciplinary Biblical Research Institute, 2001. A visual presentation is given [http://askelm.com/video/real/xmas_star.swf here].</ref> As they traveled from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, the star "went before" the magi and then "stood over" the place where Jesus was. In astrological interpretations, these phrases are said to refer to [[prograde and retrograde motion|retrograde motion]] and to stationing, i.e., Jupiter appeared to reverse course for a time, then stopped, and finally resumed its normal progression<ref>Molnar, Micheal R., [http://www.eclipse.net/~molnar/index.html ''Revealing the Star of Bethlehem''].</ref> 

In 3<U+2013>2 BC, there was a series of seven conjunctions, including three between [[Jupiter]] and [[Regulus]] and a strikingly close conjunction between Jupiter and [[Venus]] near Regulus on June 17, 2 BC.<ref name="Newman1"/> "The fusion of two planets would have been a rare and awe-inspiring event", according to an influential paper by Roger Sinnott.<ref>Sinnott, Roger, "Thoughts on the Star of Bethlehem", ''[[Sky and Telescope]]'', December 1968, pp. 384<U+2013>386.</ref>

Astronomer Michael Molnar has proposed a link between a double occultation of Jupiter by the moon in 6 BC in [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] and the Star of Bethlehem, particularly the second occultation on April 17.<ref name="Molnar">Molnar, Michael R., [http://www.eclipse.net/~molnar/index.html ''The Star of Bethlehem: The Legacy of the Magi''], Rutgers University Press: 1999. ISBN 0-8135-2701-5.</ref> This event was quite close to the sun and would have been difficult to observe, even with a small [[telescope]],<ref name="Kidger3">Kidger, Mark, [http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc120501.html "The Star of Bethlehem"], Cambridge Conference Correspondence, [[December 5]], [[2001]].</ref> which had not yet been invented. 
Occultations of planets by the moon are quite common, but [[Firmicus Maternus]], an astrologer to Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], wrote that an occultation of Jupiter in Aries was a sign of the birth of a divine king.<ref name="Molnar"/><ref name="Stenger">Stenger, Richard, [http://edition.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/12/27/star.coverup/index.html "Was Christmas star a double eclipse of Jupiter?"], [[December 27]], [[2001]]</ref> "When the royal star of Zeus, the planet Jupiter, was in the east this was the most powerful time to confer kingships. Furthermore, the Sun was in Aries where it is exalted. And the Moon was in very close conjunction with Jupiter in Aries", Molnar wrote.<ref name="Molnar"/> This set of planetary conditions reoccurs every sixty years.<ref name="Molnar"/>

===Historical fiction===
Instead of focusing on the events around the time of the birth of Jesus, the historical fiction approach considers what sources were available to Matthew when he composed his gospel (AD 85<U+2013>90) and what events might have influenced his thinking. Several aspects of the story give reason to doubt that an actual historical event is being portrayed.<ref>Raymond E. Brown, ''The Birth of the Messiah'', Anchor Bible Reference Library (1993), page 188.</ref> There are no records of failed magi searches, so the magi seem to have witnessed an event that allowed them to determine with certainty that a king had been born.<ref name="Jenkins">Jenkins, R.M., [http://www.bristolastrosoc.org.uk/uploaded/BAAJournalJenkins.pdf "The Star of Bethlehem and the Comet of 66AD"], ''Journal of the British Astronomy Association'', June 2004, '''114''', pp. 336--43.</ref> But a nova, a comet, or a conjunction would not qualify as a unique event. Moreover, several of the astronomical explanations that have been put forward are equally plausible as birth signifiers.<ref name="Jenkins"/> The magi traveled a great distance, but when they arrive in Bethlehem they merely gave some gifts. They served the storyteller's purpose of glorifying Jesus, but their motives remain obscure.

Matthew is the only one of the four [[gospels]] which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or the magi. The [[Gospel of Mark]], considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels,<ref>Ben Witherington, ''The Gospel of Mark: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary'', Eerdmans (2001), page 8; R. T. France, ''The Gospel of Mark: A Commentary on the Greek Text'', Eerdmans (2002), page 16; Head, Peter M., [http://www.tyndale.cam.ac.uk/Tyndale/staff/Head/Christology.htm ''Christology and the Synoptic Problem: An Argument for Markan priority''], Cambridge, 1997, ISBN 0-521-58488-4. For a case against Markan priority, see Peabody, David B., Lamar Cope, and Allan J. McNicol, [http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/3015_3211.pdf ''One Gospel From Two: Mark's Use of Matthew and Luke''], Trinity Press International, 2002, ISBN 1-56338-352-7. The traditional view, presented by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and others, was that Matthew was written first and that Mark was redacted from Matthew.</ref> does not include a nativity narrative or any hint that Jesus was born in Bethlehem.<ref>See {{bibleverse||Mark|6:1|NKJV}}</ref> The author of the [[Gospel of John]] also appears to be unaware of the Bethlehem nativity narratives.<ref>See {{bibleverse||John|1:46|NKJV}}.</ref> The Gospels often described Jesus as "of Nazareth,"<ref>In Greek, ''Nazar<U+0113>nos'' (Nazarene) or ''Naz<U+014D>raios'' (Nazorean). In {{bibleverse||Matthew|2:23|NKJV}}, ''Nazar<U+0113>nos'' is a play on the Hebrew word ''nazer'', literally "branch," figuratively "descendant [of David]." See Miller, Fred P., "Isaiah's Use of the word 'Branch' or Nazarene"</ref> but never as "of Bethlehem". Many scholars have concluded that Jesus was probably born in [[Nazareth]] and that the nativity narratives are influenced by the desire of the Gospel writers to portray his birth as a fulfillment a prophecy in the [[Book of Micah]] concerning a Bethlehem birth.<ref>Nikkos Kokkinos, "The Relative Chronology of the Nativity in Tertullian", in Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman and others, eds., ''Chronos, Kairos, Christos II'', Mercer University Press (1998), page 125<U+2013>6; Funk, Robert W. and the Jesus Seminar, ''The Acts of Jesus: The Search for the Authentic Deeds of Jesus'', HarperSanFrancisco, 1999, ISBN 0-06-062979-7. pp. 499, 521, 533, Paul L. Maier, "Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem", in ''Chronos, Kairos, Christos II'', Mercer University Press (1998), 171. For the prophecy, see {{bibleverse||Micah|5:2<U+2013>-4|NKJV}}.</ref>

Matthew's description of the miracles and portents attending the birth of Jesus can be compared to stories concerning the birth of [[Augustus]] (63 BC), the first Roman emperor.<ref>The god [[Apollo]] was said to have conceived with Augustus' mother and there was a "public portent" indicating that a king of Rome would soon be born. ([[Suetonius]], C. Tranquillus, ''The Lives of the Twelve Caesars'', [http://www.princeton.edu/~champlin/cla219/augiesuet.htm#1 "The Divine Augustus"], Chapter 94.)</ref> Linking a birth to the first appearance of a star was consistent with the popular belief each person's life was linked to a particular star.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137&layout=&loc=2.6 II vi] 28</ref> Magi and astronomical events were linked in the public mind by the visit to [[Rome]] of a delegation of magi at the time of a spectacular appearance of [[Halley's Comet]] in AD 66.<ref name="Jenkins"/> This delegation was led by King Tiridates of [[Armenia]], who came seeking confirmation of his title from Emperor [[Nero]]. Ancient historian [[Dio Cassius]] wrote that, "The King did not return by the route he had followed in coming,"<ref name="Jenkins"/> a line echoed in Matthew's account.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:12|NKJV}}</ref>

==Determining the year Jesus was born==
[[Image:L Adoration des Mages.jpg|thumb|250px|right|"Adoration of the Magi", by Jean Fouquet. This illumination is from ''Heures d'<U+00C9>tienne Chevalier.'' France, 15th century. The Star of Bethlehem can be seen in the top right. The soldiers and castle in the background may represent the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453).]]
{{seealso|Chronology of Jesus}}

Which event is most plausible as an explanation of the Star of Bethlehem depends on which year is accepted as the year Jesus was born. Matthew wrote that Jesus was born when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died shortly after a lunar [[eclipse]]. This is usually identified as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Coins issued by Herod's successors show that they dated their reigns as beginning in 4 BC.<ref>Timothy David Barnes, <U+201C>The Date of Herod<U+2019>s Death,<U+201D> ''Journal of Theological Studies'' ns 19 (1968), 204<U+2013>19; P. M. Bernegger, <U+201C>Affirmation of Herod<U+2019>s Death in 4 B.C.,<U+201D> ''Journal of Theological Studies'' ns 34 (1983), 526<U+2013>31.</ref>

According to Matthew's account, Jesus must have been born sometime between the first appearance of the Star of Bethlehem and the time the magi arrived in Herod's court. As Herod ordered the execution of boys age 2 and under, the star must have made its first appearance within the previous two years. There was, however, no Roman census in 6<U+2013>4 BC. The [[Census of Quirinius]] took place in 6<U+2013>7 AD. The census Luke referred to could have been another event such as a mass oath taking that took place when Augustus was given the title "father of the nation" (3<U+2013>2 BC).<ref name="Mosley1"/> Other scholars, however, argue that Luke was simply mistaken.<ref>For example, James Douglas Grant Dunn, Jesus Remembered, (Eerdmans, 2003) p344.
