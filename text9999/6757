The '''reindeer''' (''Rangifer tarandus''), also known as the '''caribou''' when wild in [[North America]], is an [[Arctic]] and [[Subarctic]]-dwelling [[deer]], widespread and numerous across the northern [[Holarctic]].  

==Distribution and habitat==

[[Image:Rentier fws 1.jpg|thumb|left|Large male Reindeer]]
The reindeer is widespread and numerous in the northern [[Holarctic]]. Originally it was found in [[Scandinavia]], Eastern Europe, [[Russia]], [[Mongolia]], and northern [[China]] north of the 50th [[latitude]]. In North America it was found in [[Alaska]], [[Canada]], and the northern U.S. States from [[Washington]] to [[Maine]]. In the 19th century, it was apparently still present in southern [[Idaho]]. It also occurred naturally on [[Sakhalin]], [[Greenland]], and probably even in historical time in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. During the late [[Pleistocene]], reindeer were found as far south as [[Nevada]] and [[Tennessee]] in North America and [[Spain]] in Europe.<ref>Ronald M. Nowak: ''Walker's Mammals of the World''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999 ISBN 0-8018-5789-9</ref><ref>Sommer R. S. and Nadachowski A.: ''Glacial refugia of mammals in Europe: evidence from fossil records.'' Mammal Rev. 2006, Volume 36, No. 4, 251-265.</ref> Today, wild reindeer have disappeared from many areas within this large historical range, especially from the southern parts where it vanished almost everywhere. Large populations of wild reindeer are still found in Siberia, Greenland, Alaska, and Canada.
[[Domestication|Domesticated]] reindeer are mostly found in northern Scandinavia, Russia, and [[Iceland]] (where they were introduced by humans in the 18th century). The last wild reindeer in Europe are found in portions of southern [[Norway]].<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4491]</ref>The southern boundary of the species' natural range is approximately at 62<U+00B0> north [[latitude]].

[[Image:RangiferTarandus.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Southern-most reindeer: a South Georgian reindeer with velvet-covered horns.]]
A few reindeer from Norway were introduced to the South Atlantic island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] in the beginning of the 20th century. Today there are two distinct herds still thriving there, permanently separated by [[glacier]]s. Their total numbers are no more than a few thousand. The [[flag]] and the [[coat of arms]] of the territory contain an image of a reindeer.

Around 4,000 reindeer have been introduced into the French subantarctic archipelago of [[Kerguelen Islands]].

==Biology and behavior==
[[Image:ReindeerLoosingVelvet.jpg|thumb|left|Reindeer antlers grow again each year under a layer of fur called velvet. This reindeer is currently losing the velvet layer on one of its antlers.]]
===Anatomy===
The weight of a female varies between {{convert|60|and|170|kg|abbr=on|lk=on}}. In some subspecies of reindeer, the male is slightly larger; in others, the male can weigh up to {{convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Both sexes grow [[antler]]s,<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/bela/html/rangifer.htm Reindeer / Caribou]</ref> which (in the Scandinavian variety) for old males fall off in December, for young males in the early spring, and for females, summer. The antlers typically have two separate groups of points (see image), a lower and upper. [[List of domesticated animals|Domesticated]] reindeer are shorter-legged and heavier than their wild counterparts. 

Reindeer have specialized noses featuring nasal [[nasal concha|turbinate bone]]s that dramatically increase the surface area within the [[nostril]]s. Incoming cold air is warmed by the animal's [[Thermoregulation|body heat]] before entering the lungs, and water is condensed from the expired air and captured before the deer's breath is exhaled, used to moisten dry incoming air and possibly absorbed into the blood through the [[mucous membrane]]s.

Reindeer [[hoof|hooves]] adapt to the season: in the summer, when the tundra is soft and wet, the footpads become spongy and provide extra traction. In the winter, the pads shrink and tighten, exposing the rim of the hoof which cuts into the [[ice]] and crusted [[snow]] to keep it from slipping. This also enables them to dig down (an activity known as "cratering")<ref name=cratering>"In the winter, the fleshy pads on these toes grow longer and form a tough, hornlike rim. Caribou use these large, sharp-edged hooves to dig through the snow and uncover the [[lichen]]s that sustain them in winter months. Biologists call this activity "cratering" because of the crater-like cavity the caribou<U+2019>s hooves leave in the snow." [http://www.taiga.net/projectcaribou/pdf/allaboutcaribou.PDF All About Caribou.] - Project Caribou</ref><ref name=cratering_image>[http://www.arcticphoto.co.uk/stories/avkas/ry0246-32.htm Image of reindeer cratering in snow.]</ref> through the snow to their favorite food, a [[lichen]] known as [[Cladonia rangiferina|reindeer moss]].  The knees of many species of reindeer are adapted to produce a clicking sound as they walk.

The reindeer coat has two layers of [[fur]], a dense [[wool]]ly undercoat and longer-haired overcoat consisting of hollow, air-filled hairs.

===Diet===
Reindeer are [[ruminant]]s, having a four-chambered stomach. They mainly eat [[lichen]]s in winter, especially [[Cladonia rangiferina|reindeer moss]]. However, they also eat the leaves of [[willow]]s and [[birch]]es, as well as [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and [[grass]]es. There is some evidence to suggest that on occasion they will also feed on [[lemming]]s,<ref>[http://www.fieldandstream.com/fieldstream/hunting/biggame/article/0,13199,490357,00.html Field & Stream - Dream Hunts: Caribou on the Move]</ref> [[arctic char]], and [[egg (biology)|bird eggs]].<ref>Terrestrial Mammals of Nunavut by Ingrid Anand-Wheeler.

===Reproduction===
Mating occurs from late September or October to early November. Males battle for access to females.  Two males will lock each other<U+2019>s antlers together and try to push each other away. The most dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 females to mate with. A male will stop eating during this time and lose much of its body reserves. 
Calves may be born the following May or June. After 45 days, the calves are able to graze and forage but continue suckling until the following fall and become independent from their mothers.

===Migration===
The reindeer travels the furthest of any terrestrial mammal. The caribou of North America can run at speeds up to {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and can travel as much as {{convert|5000|km|mi|abbr=on}} a year. Migrations can number in the thousands. The most extensive migrations occur in spring and fall.  During fall migrations, the groups become smaller and the reindeer begin to mate. During the winter, reindeer travel to forested areas to forage under the snow. By spring, groups leave their winter grounds to go to the calving grounds. A reindeer can swim easily and quickly; migrating herds will not hesitate to swim across a large lake or broad river.

==Reindeer and humans==
===Hunting===
{{See also|Reindeer hunting in Greenland}}

Reindeer hunting by humans has a very long history and caribou/wild reindeer "may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting."<ref name=Burch>"In North America and Eurasia the species has long been an important resource--in many areas ''the'' most important resource--for peoples inhabiting the northern boreal forest and tundra regions. Known human dependence on caribou/wild reindeer has a long history, beginning in the Middle Pleistocene (Banfield 1961:170; Kurt<U+00E9>n 1968:170) and continuing to the present....The caribou/wild reindeer is thus an animal that has been a major resource for humans throughout a tremendous geographic area and across a time span of tens of thousands of years." Ernest S. Burch, Jr. [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7316%28197207%2937%3A3%3C339%3ATCRAAH%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage The Caribou/Wild Reindeer as a Human Resource.] ''American Antiquity'', Vol. 37, No. 3 (Jul., 1972), pp. 339-368.</ref>

Humans started hunting reindeer in the [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods and humans are today the main predator in many areas. Norway and Greenland have unbroken traditions of hunting wild reindeer from the [[ice age]] until the present day. In the non-forested mountains of central Norway, such as [[Jotunheimen]], it is still possible to find remains of stone built [[trapping pit]]s, guiding fences, and bow rests, built especially for hunting reindeer. These can, with some certainty, be dated to the [[Migration Period]] although it is not unlikely that they have been in use since the [[Stone Age]].

Norway is now preparing to apply for nomination as a [[World Heritage Site]] for areas with traces and traditions of reindeer hunting in Central S<U+00F8>rlandet ([[Southern Norway]]).

Wild caribou are still hunted in North America and Greenland. In the traditional lifestyle of the [[Inuit]] people, Northern [[First Nations]] people, [[Alaska Natives]], and the [[Kalaallit]] of Greenland, the caribou is an important source of food, clothing, shelter, and tools.

=== Reindeer husbandry ===
[[Image:Archangel reindeer3.jpg|right|thumb|A reindeer sled, [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Russia]].  Late nineteenth century [[photochrom]].]]
[[Image:Reindeer milking.jpg|thumb|right|Milking reindeer in the 19th century]]
Reindeer have been [[Herding|herded]] for centuries by several Arctic and Subarctic people including the [[Sami people|Sami]] and the [[Nenets people|Nenets]]. They are raised for their meat, hides, antlers and, to a lesser extent, for milk and transportation. Reindeer are not considered fully domesticated, as they generally roam free on pasture grounds. In traditional nomadic herding,  reindeer herders migrate with their herds between coast and inland areas according to an annual migration route, and herds are keenly tended. However, reindeer have never been bred in captivity, though they were tamed for milking as well as for use as draught animals or [[Working animal|beasts of burden]].

The use of caribou as semi-domesticated livestock in Alaska was introduced in the late 1800s by [[Sheldon Jackson]] as a means of providing a livelihood for [[Indigenous peoples|Native peoples]] there. A regular mail run in [[Wales, Alaska]] used a sleigh drawn by caribou. In Alaska, caribou herders use [[satellite]] telemetry to track their herds, using online maps and databases to chart the herd's progress.

===Economy===
The reindeer has (or has had) an important economic role for all [[List of indigenous peoples#Circumpolar North|circumpolar peoples]], including the Saami, Nenets, [[Khanty people|Khants]], [[Evenks]], [[Yukaghir]]s, [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], and [[Koryaks]] in Eurasia. It is believed that domestication started between the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]. [[Siberia]]n deer owners also use the reindeer to ride on (Siberian reindeer are larger than their Scandinavian relatives). For breeders, a single owner may own hundreds or even thousands of animals. The numbers of Russian herders have been drastically reduced since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. The fur and meat is sold, which is an important source of income. Reindeer were introduced into Alaska near the end of the 19th century; they interbreed with native caribou subspecies there. Reindeer herders on the [[Seward Peninsula]] have experienced significant losses to their herds from animals (such as wolves) following the wild caribou during their migrations.

Reindeer meat is popular in the Scandinavian countries. Reindeer [[meatball]]s are sold canned. [[Saut<U+00E9>ed reindeer]] is the best-known dish in Lapland. In Alaska, reindeer [[sausage]] is sold locally to supermarkets and [[grocery store]]s.

Reindeer antler is powdered and sold as an [[aphrodisiac]], nutritional or medicinal supplement to Asian markets.

A company from Wales (UK) is also making paper from the cellulose fibers recovered from the dung of reindeer - which they call [http://www.creativepaperwales.co.uk/reindeer_poo_paper.asp Reindeer Poo PaperTM]. 

Caribou have been a major source of subsistence for Canadian [[Inuit]].

===In History===
The first written description of reindeer is in [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] (chapter 6.26) from the 1st century BC. Here, it is described:
{{quote|There is an ox shaped like a stag. In the middle of its forehead a single horn grows between its ears, taller and straighter than the animal horns with which we are familiar. At the top this horn spreads out like the palm of a hand or the branches of a tree. The females are of the same form as the males, and their horns are the same shape and size.}}

===Local names===
The name ''Caribou'' comes, through French, from [[M<U+00ED>kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]] ''qalipu'', meaning "snow-shoveler", referring to its habit of pawing through the snow for food.<ref>Flexner, Stuart Berg and Leonore Crary Hauck, eds. (1987). ''The Random House Dictionary of the English Language'', 2nd ed. (unabridged). New York: Random House, pp. 315-16)</ref> In [[Inuktitut]], the caribou is known by the name tuttuk (Labrador dialect).

== Subspecies ==
Reindeer have been divided since 1961 into two major groups, the tundra reindeer with six subspecies and the woodland reindeer with three subspecies. Among the tundra subspecies are three small-bodied, high-artic island forms. These island subspecies are probably not closely related, since the svalbard reindeer seems to have evolved from large european reindeer, whereas peary caribou and the extinct arctic reindeer are closely related and probably having evolved in high-arctic North America<ref >Peter Gravlund, Morten Meldgaard, Svante P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo, and Peter Arctander: Polyphyletic Origin of the Small-Bodied, High-Arctic Subspecies

====Tundra reindeer====
* '''Arctic reindeer''' (''R. tarandus eogroenlandicus''), an [[Extinction|extinct]] [[subspecies]] found until 1900 in eastern Greenland.
* '''[[Peary Caribou]]''' (''R. tarandus pearyi''), found in the northern islands of the Nunavut and the Northwest Territories of Canada.
* '''Svalbard Reindeer''' (''R. tarandus platyrhynchus''), found on the [[Svalbard]] islands of Norway, is the smallest subspecies of reindeer.

* '''Mountain/Wild Reindeer''' (''R. tarandus tarandus''), found in the Arctic tundra of  Eurasia, including the Fennoscandia peninsula of Northern Europe.
* '''[[Porcupine caribou]]''' or '''Grant's Caribou''' (''R. tarandus granti'') which are found in Alaska, the [[Yukon]], and the [[Northwest Territories]] of Canada.
* '''[[Barren-ground Caribou]]''' (''R. tarandus groenlandicus''), found in [[Nunavut]] and the Northwest Territories of Canada and in western Greenland.

====Woodland reindeer====
* '''Finnish Forest Reindeer''' (''R. tarandus fennicus''), found in the wild in only two areas of the [[Fennoscandia|Fennoscandia peninsula]] of [[Northern Europe]], in Finnish/Russian [[Karelia]], and a small population in central south [[Finland]]. The Karelia population reaches far into Russia, however, so far that it remains an open question whether reindeer further to the east are ''R. t. fennicus'' as well.
* '''[[Migratory Woodland Caribou|Woodland Caribou]]''' (''R. tarandus caribou''), or '''forest caribou''', once found in the North American [[taiga]] (boreal forest) from Alaska to [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and as far south as [[New England]] and [[Washington]]. Woodland Caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range and are considered "[[Threatened species|threatened]]" where they remain, with the notable exception of the Migratory Woodland Caribou of northern [[Quebec]] and [[Labrador]], Canada.  The name of the [[Cariboo]] district of central [[British Columbia]] relates to their once-large numbers there, but they have almost vanished from that area in the last century. A herd is protected in the [[Caribou Mountains (Alberta)|Caribou Mountains]] in [[Alberta]].
* '''[[Queen Charlotte Islands caribou]]''' (''R. tarandus dawsoni'') from Haida Gwaii was believed to represent a distinct subspecies. It became extinct at the beginning of the 20th century. However, recent DNA analysis from mitochondrial DNA of the remains from those reindeer suggest, that the animals from Haida Gwaii were not genetically distinct from the Canadian mainland reindeer subspecies<ref>S. A. Byun, B. F. Koop, and T. E. Reimchen: ''Evolution of the Dawson caribou (''Rangifer tarandus dawsoni'')''. Can. J.

===Santa Claus' reindeer===
{{main|Santa Claus's reindeer}}
[[Image:reindeer.yate.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|Two Scottish reindeer relax after pulling Santa's sleigh, at the switching on of Christmas lights]]
[[Santa Claus]]' sleigh is pulled by flying reindeer. These were first named in the 1823 poem ''[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]'', where they are called Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder, and Blixem. Dunder was later changed to Donder and <U+2014> in other works <U+2014> Donner (in German, "thunder"), and Blixem was later changed to Blitzen (German for "lightning"). Some consider Rudolph as part of the group as well, though he was not part of the original named work referenced previously. Rudolph was added to the story by Robert L. May in 1939 as "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]."

==Miscellaneous==

* The caribou is the official national animal of Isle de Beaulieu.
* The Canadian [[Quarter (Canadian coin)|quarter]] features a depiction of a Caribou on one face.
* Several Norwegian municipalities have one or more reindeer depicted in their coat-of-arms: [[Eidfjord]], [[Porsanger]], [[Rendalen]], [[Troms<U+00F8>]], [[Vads<U+00F8>]], and [[V<U+00E5>g<U+00E5>]].
* The historic province of [[V<U+00E4>sterbotten]] in [[Sweden]] has a reindeer in its coat-of-arms. The present [[V<U+00E4>sterbotten County]] has very different borders and uses the reindeer combined with other symbols in its coat-of-arms. The city of [[Pite<U+00E5>]] also has a reindeer.
* The logo for [[Ume<U+00E5> University]] features three reindeer.
