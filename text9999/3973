[[File:Rome-Seleucia-Parthia 200bc.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Rome]], [[Parthia]] and [[Seleucid Empire]] in 200&nbsp;BC. Soon both the Romans and the Parthians would invade the Seleucid-held territories, and become the strongest states in western Asia.]]

The '''Roman&ndash;Persian Wars''' were a series of conflicts between states of the [[Greco-Roman world]] and two successive [[Greater Iran|Iranian empires]]: the Parthian and the Sassanid. Battles between the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Roman Republic]] began in 92&nbsp;BC;  wars began under the late Republic, and continued through the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid empire]]s. They were ended by the [[Muslim conquests|Arab Muslim invasions]], which devastated the Sassanid and [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine East Roman]] empires shortly after the end of the last war between them.

Although warfare between the Romans and the Parthians/Sassanids lasted for seven centuries, the frontier remained largely stable. A game of [[tug of war]] ensued: towns, fortifications, and provinces were continuously sacked, captured, destroyed, and traded. Neither side had the logistical strength or manpower to maintain such lengthy campaigns far from their borders, and thus neither could advance too far without risking stretching their frontiers too thin. Both sides did make conquests beyond the border, but in time the balance was almost always restored. The line of stalemate shifted in the 2nd century AD: it had run along the northern [[Euphrates]]; the new line ran east, or later northeast, across [[Mesopotamia]] to the northern [[Tigris]]. There were also several substantial shifts further north, in [[Armenia]] and the [[Caucasus]].

The expense of resources during the Roman&ndash;Persian Wars ultimately proved catastrophic for both empires. The prolonged and escalating warfare of the 6th and 7th centuries left them exhausted and vulnerable in the face of the sudden emergence and expansion of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Caliphate]], whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the end of the last Roman&ndash;Persian war. Benefiting from their weakened condition, the [[Rashidun army|Arab Muslim armies]] swiftly [[Muslim conquests|conquered]] the [[Rashidun conquest of the Sassanian Empire|entire Sassanid Empire]], and [[Byzantine<U+2013>Arab Wars|deprived the Eastern Roman Empire]] of its [[Muslim conquest of Syria|territories in the Levant]], [[Arab conquest of Armenia|the Caucasus]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|rest of North Africa]]. Over the following centuries, most of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] came under Muslim rule. As it stands, this was the longest conflict in human history, lasting approximately 721 years.

==Historical background==
According to [[James Howard-Johnston]], "from the third century&nbsp;BC to the early seventh century&nbsp;AD, the rival players [in the East] were grand polities with imperial pretensions, which had been able to establish and secure stable territories transcending regional divides".<ref>Howard-Johnston (2006), 1</ref> The Romans and Parthians came into contact through their respective conquests of parts of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. During the 3rd century&nbsp;BC, the Parthians migrated from the [[Central Asia]]n steppe into northern [[Iran]]. Although subdued for a time by the Seleucids, in the 2nd century they broke away and established an independent state that steadily expanded at the expense of their former rulers, conquering [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Ruled by the [[Parthia|Arsacid dynasty]], the Parthians fended off several Seleucid attempts to regain their lost territories, and extended their rule deep into [[India]] (see [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]]).<ref name="BEn">Ball (2000), 12&ndash;13; Dignas&ndash;Winter (2007), [http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/49258/excerpt/9780521849258_excerpt.pdf 9] (PDF)</ref> Meanwhile the Romans expelled the Seleucids from their territories in [[Anatolia]] in the early 2nd century&nbsp;BC, after defeating [[Antiochus III the Great]] at [[Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC)|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Magnesia|Magnesia]]. Finally, in 64&nbsp;BC [[Pompey]] conquered the remaining Seleucid territories in Syria, extinguishing their state and advancing the Roman eastern frontier to the [[Euphrates]], where it met the territory of the Parthians.<ref name="BEn" />

==Roman&ndash;Parthian Wars==

===Roman Republic vs. Parthia===
Parthian enterprise in the [[Western world|West]] began in the time of [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] and was revived by [[Mithridates II of Parthia|Mithridates II]], who negotiated unsuccessfully with [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] for a Roman&ndash;Parthian alliance (c.&nbsp;105&nbsp;BC).<ref>Plutarch, ''Sulla'', 5. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sulla*.html 3&ndash;6]<br/>* Mackay (2004), 149; Sherwin-White (1994), 262</ref> When [[Lucullus]] invaded [[Roman Armenia|Southern Armenia]] and led an attack against [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes]] in 69&nbsp;BC, he corresponded with [[Phraates III of Parthia|Phraates III]] to dissuade him from intervening. Although the Parthians remained neutral, Lucullus considered attacking them.<ref>Bivar (1993), 46<br/>* Sherwin-White (1994), 262<U+2013>263</ref> In 66&ndash;65&nbsp;BC, Pompey reached agreement with Phraates, and Roman&ndash;Parthian troops invaded [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], but a dispute soon arose over the Euphrates boundary. Finally, Phraates asserted his control over Mesopotamia, except for the western district of [[Osroene]], which became a Roman dependency.<ref>Sherwin-White (1994), 264</ref>

The Roman general [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] led an invasion of Mesopotamia in 53&nbsp;BC with catastrophic results; he and his son [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)|Publius]] were killed at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] by the Parthians under [[Surena#General Surena|General Surena]]; this was the worst Roman defeat since the [[Battle of Cannae]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html 23&ndash;32]<br/>* Mackay (2004), 150</ref> The Parthians raided Syria the following year, and mounted a major invasion in 51&nbsp;BC, but their army was caught in an ambush near [[Antigonia (Syria)|Antigonea]] by the Romans, and they were driven back.<ref>Bivar (1993), 56</ref>

The Parthians largely remained neutral during [[Caesar's civil war]], fought between forces supporting [[Julius Caesar]] and forces supporting [[Pompey]] and the traditional faction of the [[Roman Senate]]. However, they maintained relations with Pompey, and after his defeat and death, a force under [[Pacorus I of Parthia|Pacorus I]] assisted the Pompeian general [[Q. Caecilius Bassus]], who was besieged at [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] Valley by Caesarian forces. With the civil war over, Julius Caesar prepared a campaign against Parthia, but his assassination averted the war. The Parthians supported [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] during the ensuing [[Liberators' civil war]] and sent a contingent to fight on their side at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42&nbsp;BC.<ref>Justin, ''Historiarum Philippicarum'', XLII.[http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Parthian.html 4]<br/>* Bivar (1993), 56&ndash;57</ref> After the Liberators' defeat, the Parthians invaded Roman territory in 40&nbsp;BC in conjunction with the Roman [[Quintus Labienus]], a former supporter of Brutus and Cassius. They swiftly overran the Roman province of Syria and advanced into [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]], overthrowing the Roman client [[Hyrcanus II]] and installing his nephew [[Antigonus the Hasmonean|Antigonus]]. For a moment, the whole of the Roman East seemed lost to the Parthians or about to fall into their hands. However, the conclusion of the second [[Roman civil wars|Roman civil war]] soon revived Roman strength in [[Asia]].<ref>Bivar (1993), 57</ref> [[Mark Antony]] had sent [[Publius Ventidius Bassus|Ventidius]] to oppose Labienus, who had invaded Anatolia. Soon Labienus was driven back to Syria by Roman forces, and, although reinforced by the Parthians, was defeated, taken prisoner, and killed. After suffering a further defeat near the [[Syrian Gates]], the Parthians withdrew from Syria. They returned in 38&nbsp;BC but were decisively defeated by Ventidius, and Pacorus was killed. In Judaea, Antigonus was ousted with Roman help by [[Herod the Great|Herod]] in 37&nbsp;BC.<ref>Justin, ''Historiarum Philippicarum'', XLII.[http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Parthian.html 4]; Plutarch, ''Antony'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html 33&ndash;34]<br/>* Bivar (1993), 57&ndash;58</ref> With Roman control of Syria and Judaea restored, Mark Antony led a huge army into [[Atropatene]], but his siege train and its escort were isolated and wiped out, while his [[Armenians|Armenian allies]] deserted. Failing to make progress against Parthian positions, the Romans withdrew with heavy casualties. Antony was again in Armenia in 33&nbsp;BC to join with the [[Medes|Median]] king against [[Augustus|Octavian]] and the Parthians. Other preoccupations obliged him to withdraw, and the whole region came under Parthian control.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', XLIX, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/49*.html 27&ndash;33]<br/>* Bivar (1993), 58&ndash;65</ref>

===Roman Empire vs. Parthia===
[[File:Parthia 001ad.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Parthia, its subkingdoms, and neighbors in 1&nbsp;AD]]
With tensions between the two powers threatening renewed war, [[Gaius Caesar]] and [[Phraates V of Parthia|Phraataces]] worked out a compromise in 1&nbsp;AD. According to the agreement,  Parthia undertook to withdraw its forces from Armenia and to recognize a ''[[de facto]]'' Roman protectorate there. Nonetheless, Roman&ndash;Persian rivalry over control and influence in Armenia continued unabated for the next several decades.<ref>Sicker (2000), 162</ref> The decision of the Parthian King [[Artabanus III (of Parthia)|Artabanus III]] to place his son on the vacant Armenian throne triggered a war with Rome in 36&nbsp;AD, which ended when Artabanus III abandoned claims to a Parthian sphere of influence in Armenia.<ref>Sicker (2000), 162&ndash;163</ref> War erupted in 58&nbsp;AD, after the Parthian King [[Vologases I]] forcibly installed his brother [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates]] on the Armenian throne.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'', XII.[[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 12#50|50&ndash;51]]<br/>* Sicker (2000), 163</ref> Roman forces overthrew Tiridates and replaced him with a [[Cappadocian]] prince, triggering an [[Roman<U+2013>Parthian War of 58<U+2013>63|inconclusive war]]. This came to an end in 63&nbsp;AD after the Romans agreed to allow Tiridates and his descendants to rule Armenia on condition that they receive the kingship from the Roman emperor.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'', XV.[[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#27|27&ndash;29]]<br/>* Rawlinson (2007), 286&ndash;287</ref>

A fresh series of conflicts began in the 2nd century AD, during which the Romans consistently held the upper hand over Parthia. The Emperor [[Trajan]] invaded Armenia and Mesopotamia during 114 and 115 and annexed them as Roman provinces. He captured the Parthian capital, [[Ctesiphon]], before sailing downriver to the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref name="S167">Sicker (2000), 167</ref> However, uprisings erupted in 115 AD in the occupied Parthian territories, while a major [[Kitos War|Jewish revolt]] broke out in Roman territory, severely stretching Roman military resources. Parthian forces attacked key Roman positions, and the Roman garrisons at [[Seleucia]], [[Nisibis]] and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] were expelled by the local inhabitants. Trajan subdued the rebels in Mesopotamia, but having installed the Parthian prince [[Parthamaspates of Parthia|Parthamaspates]] on the throne as a client ruler, he withdrew his armies and returned to Syria. Trajan died in 117, before he was able to reorganize and consolidate Roman control over the Parthian provinces.<ref name="S168">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'',  LXVIII, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html 33]<br/>* Sicker (2000), 167&ndash;168</ref>

Trajan's Parthian War initiated a "shift of emphasis in the 'grand strategy of the Roman empire'&nbsp;", but his successor, [[Hadrian]], decided that it was in Rome's interest to re-establish the Euphrates as the limit of its direct control. Hadrian returned to the ''[[status quo ante bellum|status quo ante]]'', and surrendered the territories of Armenia, Mesopotamia, and [[Adiabene]] to their previous rulers and client-kings.<ref>Lightfoot (1990), 115: "Trajan succeeded in acquiring territory in these lands with a view to annexation, something which had not seriously been attempted before&nbsp;... Although Hadrian abandoned all of Trajan's conquests&nbsp;... the trend was not to be reversed. Further wars of annexation followed under Lucius Verus and Septimius Severus."; Sicker (2000), 167<U+2013>168</ref>

[[Roman<U+2013>Parthian War of 161<U+2013>66|War over Armenia]] broke out again in 161, when [[Vologases IV of Parthia|Vologases IV]] defeated the Romans there, captured Edessa and ravaged Syria. In 163 a Roman counter-attack under [[Statius Priscus]] defeated the Parthians in Armenia and installed a favored candidate on the Armenian throne. The following year [[Avidius Cassius]] invaded Mesopotamia, winning battles at [[Dura-Europos]] and Seleucia and sacking Ctesiphon in 165. An epidemic which was sweeping Parthia at the time, possibly of [[smallpox]], spread to the Roman army and forced its withdrawal;<ref>Sicker (2000), 169</ref> this was the origin of the [[Antonine Plague]] that raged for a generation throughout the Roman Empire. In 195&ndash;197, a Roman offensive under the Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] led to Rome's acquisition of northern Mesopotamia as far as the areas around [[Nisibis]], [[Singara]] and the 2nd sacking of Ctesiphon.<ref>Herodian, Roman History, III, [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre309.html 9.1&ndash;12]<br/>Campbell (2005), 6&ndash;7; Rawlinson (2007), 337&ndash;338</ref> A final war against the Parthians was launched by the Emperor [[Caracalla]], who sacked [[Arbil|Arbela]] in 216. After his assassination, his successor, [[Macrinus]], was defeated by the Parthians near [[Battle of Nisibis (217)|Nisibis]]. In exchange for peace, he was obliged to pay for the damage caused by Caracalla.<ref>Herodian, Roman History,&nbsp;IV, [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre410.html 10.1&ndash;15.9]<br/>Campbell (2005), 20</ref>

==Roman&ndash;Sassanid Wars==

===Early Roman&ndash;Sassanid conflicts===
[[File:Bas relief nagsh-e-rostam al.jpg|thumb|Rock-face relief at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] of Iranian emperor Shapur I (on horseback) capturing Roman emperor Valerian (standing) and Philip the Arab (kneeling)]]

Conflict resumed shortly after the overthrow of Parthian rule and [[Ardashir I]]'s foundation of the Sassanid Empire. Ardashir raided Mesopotamia and Syria in 230 and demanded the cession of all the former territories of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].<ref>Herodian, ''Roman History'', VI, [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre602.html 2.1&ndash;6]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXX, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html 4.1&ndash;2]<br/>* Dodgeon&ndash;Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), I, 16</ref> After fruitless negotiations, [[Alexander Severus]] set out against Ardashir in 232 and finally repulsed him.<ref>Herodian, ''Roman History'', VI, [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre605.html 5.1<U+2013>6]<br/>* Dodgeon&ndash;Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), I, 24&ndash;28; Frye (1993), 124</ref> In 238&ndash;240, towards the end of his reign, Ardashir attacked again, taking several cities in Syria and Mesopotamia, including [[Carrhae]] and Nisibis.<ref>Frye (1993), 124&ndash;125; Southern (2001), 234&ndash;235</ref> The struggle resumed and intensified under Ardashir's successor [[Shapur I]], who invaded Mesopotamia. His forces were defeated at a [[Battle of Resaena|battle]] near [[Resaena]] in 243 and the Romans regained Carrhae and Nisibis.<ref>Frye (1993), 125</ref> Encouraged by these victories, Roman Emperor [[Gordian III]] advanced down the Euphrates but was repelled near [[Ctesiphon]] at the [[Battle of Misiche]] in 244.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'', 27.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#27 7&ndash;8]; Sibylline Oracles, XIII, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/sib/sib13.htm 13&ndash;20]<br/>* Frye (1993), 125; Southern (2001), 235</ref>  Gordian III was then killed, and successor Emperor [[Phillip the Arab]] hastily negotiated a peace settlement.

With the Roman Empire debilitated by Germanic invasions and a series of short-term emperors, Shapur I soon resumed his attacks. He conquered Armenia and killed its king, defeated the Romans at the [[Battle of Barbalissos]] in 253, and sacked [[Antioch]].<ref>Frye (1993), 125; Southern (2001), 235&ndash;236</ref> Between 258 and 260, Shapur captured Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] after defeating his army at the [[Battle of Edessa]]. He advanced into Anatolia but was defeated by Roman forces there; attacks from [[Odaenathus]] of [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyra]] forced the Persians to withdraw from Roman territory, surrendering Armenia and Antioch.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/lactantius/demort.shtml 5]; Sibylline Oracles, XIII, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/sib/sib13.htm 155&ndash;171]<br/>* Frye (1993), 126; Southern (2001), 238</ref>

[[File:Julian Campaign 363.png|250px|thumb|left|[[Julian the Apostate|Julian's]] unsuccessful campaign in 363 resulted in the loss of the Roman territorial gains under the peace treaty of 299.]]
The Emperor [[Carus]] launched a successful invasion of Persia in 283, sacking the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon for the third time. The Romans probably would have extended their conquests had Carus not died in December of that year.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'', 38.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#38 2&ndash;4]; Eutropius, ''Abridgment of Roman History'', IX, [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#18 18.1]<br/>* Frye (1993), 128; Southern (2001), 241</ref>

After a brief peace early in [[Diocletian]]'s reign, the Persians renewed hostilities when they invaded Armenia and defeated the Romans outside Carrhae in either 296 or 297.<ref name="Frye (1993), 130; Southern (2001), 242">Frye (1993), 130; Southern (2001), 242</ref> However, [[Galerius]] crushed the Persians in the [[Battle of Satala (298)|Battle of Satala]] in 298, capturing the treasury and the royal [[harem]], an utter disgrace for the Persian monarch. The resulting peace settlement gave the Romans control of the area between the [[Tigris]] and the [[Great Zab|Greater Zab]]. This was the most decisive Roman victory for many decades; all the territories that had been lost, all the debatable lands, and control of Armenia lay in Roman hands.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'', 39.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 33&ndash;36]; Eutropius, ''Abridgment of Roman History'', IX, [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#18 24&ndash;25.1]<br/>* Frye (1993), 130&ndash;131; Southern (2001), 243</ref>

The arrangements of 299 lasted until the mid-330s, when [[Shapur II]] began a series of offensives against the Romans. Despite a string of victories in battle, his campaigns achieved little lasting effect: three Persian sieges of Nisibis were repulsed, and while Shapur succeeded in taking Amida and Singara, both cities were soon regained by the Romans.<ref name="Frye (1993), 130; Southern (2001), 242"/> Following a lull during the 350s while Shapur fought off nomad attacks on Persia's northern frontier, he launched a new campaign in 359 and again captured Amida. This provoked a major offensive in 363 by the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], who advanced down the Euphrates to Ctesiphon.<ref>Frye (1993), 137</ref> Julian won the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Battle of Ctesiphon]] but was unable to take the Persian capital and retreated along the Tigris. Harried by the Persians, Julian was killed in a [[Battle of Samarra|skirmish]]. With the Roman army stuck on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, Julian's successor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] made peace, agreeing to major concessions in exchange for safe passage out of Sassanid territory. The Romans surrendered their former possessions east of the Tigris, as well as Nisibis and Singara, and Shapur soon conquered Armenia.<ref>Frye (1993), 138</ref> In 384 or 387, a definitive peace treaty was signed by [[Shapur III]] and [[Theodosius I]] dividing Armenia between the two states. Meanwhile, the northern territories of the Roman Empire were [[Migration Period|invaded]] by Germanic, Alanic, and Hunnic peoples, while Persia's northern borders were threatened first by a number of Hunnic peoples and then by the [[Hephthalites]]. With both empires preoccupied by these threats, a largely peaceful period followed, interrupted only by two brief wars, the [[Roman-Sassanid war (421-422)|first in 421&ndash;422]] and the second in 440.<ref>Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/14*.html XIV.1]; Frye (1993), 145; Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 37&ndash;51</ref>

That year an armistice was reached as a result of an invasion of Armenia by the [[Huns]] from the [[Caucasus]]. Although the two powers negotiated, it was not until November 506 that a treaty was agreed to.<ref>Procopius, ''Wars'', I.9.24<br />* Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), II, 77</ref> In 505, Anastasius ordered the building of a great fortified city at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]].

This was because the construction of new fortifications in the border zone by either empire had been prohibited by a treaty concluded some decades earlier. Anastasius pursued the project despite Persian objections, and the walls were completed by 507&ndash;508.<ref>Joshua the Stylite, ''Chronicle'', [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/joshua_the_stylite_02_trans.htm XCIII&ndash;XCIV]<br />* Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), II, 77</ref>

The Persians broke the "Treaty of Eternal Peace" in 540&nbsp;AD, probably in response to the Roman reconquest of much of the former western empire, which had been facilitated by the cessation of war in the East. Khosrau I invaded and devastated Syria, extorting large sums of money from the cities of Syria and Mesopotamia, and systematically looting other cities including [[Antioch]], whose population was deported to Persian territory.<ref name="BrJustFPW">Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), II, 102; see H.

Early in 548, King [[Gubazes II of Lazica|Gubazes]] of [[Lazica]], having found Persian protection oppressive, asked Justinian to restore the Roman protectorate. The emperor seized the chance, and in 548&ndash;549 combined Roman and Lazic forces won a series of victories against Persian armies, although they failed to take the key garrison of [[Petra]].

===War for the Caucasus===
{{details|Byzantine<U+2013>Sassanid War of 572<U+2013>591}}
War broke out again when Armenia and Iberia revolted against Sassanid rule in 571&nbsp;AD, following clashes involving Roman and Persian proxies in Yemen and the Syrian desert, and after Roman negotiations for an alliance with the [[Gokturks|Turks]] against Persia.<ref>[[John of Epiphania]], ''History'', [http://www.ancientsites.com/aw/Post/1048936 2 AncientSites.com] gives an additional reason for the outbreak of the war: "[The Medians'] contentiousness increased even further&nbsp;... when Justin did not deem to pay the Medians the five hundred pounds of gold each year previously agreed to under the peace treaties and let the Roman State remain forever a tributary of the Persians."

[[File:Persia 600ad.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Sassanid Empire and its neighbors (including the Eastern Roman Empire) in 600&nbsp;AD]]
The Romans exploited Persian disarray as general [[Justinian (general)|Justinian]] invaded deep into Persian territory and raided [[Atropatene]].<ref name="TW95" /> Khosrau sought peace but abandoned this initiative after [[Tamkhusro]] won a victory in Armenia, where Roman actions had alienated local inhabitants.<ref name="TW96">Treadgold (1997), 224; Whitby (2000), 95&ndash;96</ref> In the spring of 578 the war in Mesopotamia resumed with Persian raids on Roman territory.

[[File:Roman-Persian Frontier in Late Antiquity.svg|250px|thumb|The Roman-Persian frontier in the 4th to 7th centuries]]
During the 580s, the war continued inconclusively with victories on both sides. In 582, Maurice won a battle at Constantia over Adarmahan and Tamkhusro, who was killed, but the Roman general did not follow up his victory; he had to hurry to [[Constantinople]] to pursue his imperial ambitions.<ref>Soward, [http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/Theophylact.pdf Theophylact Simocatta and the Persians] (PDF); Treadgold (1997), 226; Whitby (2000), 96</ref> Another Roman victory at [[Battle of Solachon|Solachon]] in 586 likewise failed to break the stalemate.<ref>Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), II, 168-169</ref>

The Persians captured [[Silvan, Turkey|Martyropolis]] through treachery in 589, but that year the stalemate was shattered when the Persian general [[Bahram Chobin]], having been dismissed and humiliated by Hormizd IV, raised a rebellion. Hormizd was overthrown in a palace coup in 590 and replaced by his son [[Khosrau II]], but Bahram pressed on with his revolt regardless and the defeated Khosrau was soon forced to flee for safety to Roman territory, while Bahram took the throne as Bahram VI. With support from Maurice, Khosrau raised a rebellion against Bahram, and in 591 the combined forces of his supporters and the Romans restored Khosrau II to power. In exchange for their help, Khosrau not only returned Dara and Martyropolis but also agreed to cede the western half of Iberia and more than half of Persian Armenia to the Romans.<ref>Theophylact, V, ''History'', I, [http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/Theophylact.pdf 3.11] (PDF) and [http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/Theophylact.pdf 15.1] (PDF)<br />* Louth (2005), 115; Treadgold (1997), 231&ndash;232</ref>

In 602 the Roman army [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns|campaigning in the Balkans]] mutinied under the leadership of [[Phocas]], who succeeded in seizing the throne and then killed Maurice and his family. Khosrau II used the murder of his benefactor as a pretext for war.<ref>Foss (1975), 722</ref> In the early years of the war the Persians enjoyed overwhelming and unprecedented success. They were aided by Khosrau's use of a pretender claiming to be Maurice's son, and by the revolt against Phocas led by the Roman general Narses.<ref>Theophanes, ''Chronicle'', 290&ndash;293<br />* Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), II, 183&ndash;184</ref> In 603 Khosrau defeated and killed the Roman general Germanus in Mesopotamia and laid siege to Dara. Despite the arrival of Roman reinforcements from Europe, he won another victory in 604, while Dara fell after a nine-month siege.

During these years, Heraclius strove to rebuild his army, slashing non-military expenditures, devaluing the currency and melting down Church plate, with the backing of [[Sergius I of Constantinople|Patriarch Sergius]], to raise the necessary funds to continue the war.<ref>Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), II, 196</ref> In 622, Heraclius left Constantinople, entrusting the city to Sergius and general Bonus as regents of his son.

Meanwhile, Heraclius formed an alliance with the [[Gokturks|Turks]], who took advantage of the dwindling strength of the Persians to [[Third Perso-Turkic War|ravage their territories]] in the Caucasus.<ref>Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), II, 209&ndash;212</ref> Late in 627, Heraclius launched a winter offensive into Mesopotamia, where, despite the desertion of the Turkish contingent that had accompanied him, he defeated the Persians at the [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|Battle of Nineveh]].

==Aftermath==
{{See also|Muslim conquests|Islamic conquest of Persia|Byzantine<U+2013>Arab Wars}}
The devastating impact of this last war, added to the cumulative effects of a century of almost continuous conflict, left both empires crippled. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. The Sassanids were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation from Khosrau II's campaigns, religious unrest, and the increasing power of the [[Shah|provincial landholders]].<ref>Howard-Johnston (2006), 9: "[Heraclius'] victories in the field over the following years and its political repercussions&nbsp;... saved the main bastion of Christianity in the Near East and gravely weakened its old Zoroastrian rival."</ref> The Roman Empire was also severely affected, with its financial reserves exhausted by the war and the Balkans now largely in the hands of the Slavs.<ref>Haldon (1997), 43&ndash;45, 66, 71, 114&ndash;15</ref> Additionally, Anatolia was devastated by repeated Persian invasions; the Empire's hold on its recently regained territories in the Caucasus, Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt was loosened by many years of Persian occupation.<ref>Ambivalence toward Byzantine rule on the part of [[miaphysitism|miaphysites]] may have lessened local resistance to the Arab expansion (Haldon [1997], 49&ndash;50).</ref>

Neither empire was given any chance to recover, as within a few years they were struck by the onslaught of the [[Arab]]s (newly united by [[Islam]]), which, according to Howard-Johnston, "can only be likened to a human tsunami".<ref>Foss (1975), 746&ndash;47; Howard-Johnston (2006), xv</ref> According to George Liska, the "unnecessarily prolonged Byzantine&ndash;Persian conflict opened the way for Islam".<ref>Liska (1998), 170</ref> The Sassanid Empire rapidly succumbed to these attacks and was completely destroyed. During the Byzantine&ndash;Arab Wars, the exhausted Roman Empire's recently regained eastern and southern provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] were also lost, reducing the Empire to a territorial rump consisting of Anatolia and a scatter of islands and footholds in the Balkans and Italy.<ref>Haldon (1997), 49&ndash;50</ref> These remaining lands were thoroughly impoverished by frequent attacks, marking the transition from classical urban civilization to a more rural, medieval form of society. However, unlike Persia, the Roman Empire (in the form of the Byzantine Empire) ultimately survived the Arab assault, holding onto its residual territories and decisively repulsing two Arab sieges of its capital in [[Siege of Constantinople (674)|674&ndash;678]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|717&ndash;718]].<ref>Haldon (1997), 61&ndash;62; Howard-Johnston (2006), 9</ref> The Roman Empire also lost its territories in [[Crete]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|southern Italy to the Arabs]] in later conflicts, though these too were [[Byzantine reconquest|ultimately recovered]].

==Strategies and military tactics==
{{Roman-Persian Wars timeline infobox}}
When the Roman and Parthian Empires first collided in the 1st century BC, it appeared that Parthia had the potential to push its frontier to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and the Mediterranean. However, under Pacorus and Labienus, the Romans repulsed the great invasion of Syria and were gradually able to take advantage of the weaknesses of the Parthian military system, which, according to [[George Rawlinson]], was adapted for national defense but ill-suited for conquest. The Romans, on the other hand, were continually modifying and evolving their "grand strategy" from Trajan's time onwards, and were by the time of Pacorus able to take the offensive against the Parthians.<ref>Rawlinson (2007), 199: "The Parthian military system had not the elasticity of the Romans&nbsp;... However loose and seemingly flexible, it was rigid in its uniformity; it never altered; it remained under the thirtieth Arsaces such as it had been under the first, improved in details perhaps, but essentially the same system." According to Michael Whitby (2000), 310, "the eastern armies preserved the Roman military reputation through to the end of the 6th century by capitalizing on available resources and showing a capacity to adapt to a variety of challenges".</ref> Like the Sassanids in the late 3rd and 4th centuries, the Parthians generally avoided any sustained defense of Mesopotamia against the Romans. However, the [[Iranian plateau]] never fell, as the Roman expeditions had always exhausted their offensive impetus by the time they reached lower Mesopotamia, and their extended line of communications through territory not sufficiently pacified exposed them to revolts and counterattacks.<ref name="Wheeler (2007), 259">Wheeler (2007), 259</ref>

From the 4th century&nbsp;AD onwards, the Persian Sassanids grew in strength and adopted the role of aggressor. They considered much of the land added to the Roman Empire in Parthian and early Sassanid times to rightfully belong to the Persian sphere.<ref name="Fr473">Frye (2005), 473</ref> Everett Wheeler argues that "the Sassanids, administratively more centralized than the Parthians, formally organized defense of their territory, although they lacked a standing army until Khosrau I".<ref name="Wheeler (2007), 259"/> In general the Romans regarded the Sassanids as a more serious threat than the Parthians, while the Sassanids regarded the Roman Empire as the enemy ''par excellence.''<ref>Greatrex (2005), 478; Frye (2005), 472</ref>

Militarily, the Sassanids continued the Parthians' heavy dependence on the combination of light-horse archers and [[cataphract]]s, the [[heavy cavalry|heavy armored cavalry]] provided by the aristocracy. They added a contingent of [[war elephant]]s obtained from the [[Indus Valley]], but their [[infantry]] quality was inferior to that of the Romans.<ref>Cornuelle, [http://www.derafsh-kaviyani.com/english/sassanian.html An Overview of the Sassanian Persian Military]; Sidnell (2006), 273</ref> The Persian heavy cavalry inflicted several defeats on the Roman foot-soldiers, including those led by Crassus in 53&nbsp;BC,<ref>According to Reno E. Gabba, the Roman army was reorganized over time after the impact of the Battle of Carrhae (Gabba [1966], 51&ndash;73).</ref> Mark Antony in 36&nbsp;BC, and Valerian in 260&nbsp;AD. The need to counter this threat led to the introduction of ''cataphractarii'' into the Roman army;<ref>Vegetius, III, ''Epitoma Rei Militaris'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/vegetius3.html 26]<br/>* Verbruggen&ndash;Willard&ndash;Southern (1997), 4&ndash;5</ref> as a result, heavily armed cavalry grew in importance in both the Roman and Persian armies after the 3rd century AD and until the end of the wars.<ref name="Fr473" /> The Romans had achieved and maintained a high degree of sophistication in siege warfare and had developed a range of [[siege machine]]s. On the other hand, the Parthians were inept at besieging; their cavalry armies were more suited to the [[hit-and-run tactics]] that destroyed Antony's siege train in 36&nbsp;BC. The situation changed with the rise of the Sassanids, when Rome encountered an enemy equally skilled in siegecraft, who made use of [[artillery]], machines captured from the Romans, embankments, and [[siege tower]]s.<ref>Campbell&ndash;Hook (2005), 57&ndash;59; Gabba (1966), 51&ndash;73</ref>

Towards the end of the 1st century&nbsp;AD, Rome organized the protection of its eastern frontiers through a line of fortifications, the ''[[limes]]'' system, which lasted until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century after improvements by Diocletian.<ref>Shah<U+00EE>d (1984), 24&ndash;25; Wagstaff (1985), 123&ndash;125</ref> Like the Romans, the Sassanids constructed defensive walls opposite the territory of their opponents. According to R. N. Frye, it was under Shapur II that the Persian system was extended, probably in imitation of Diocletian's construction of the ''limes'' of the Syrian and Mesopotamian frontiers of the Roman Empire. The Roman border units were known as ''[[limitanei]]'', and they faced the [[Lakhmids]] in [[Iraq]], who frequently aided the Persians in their contests with the Romans. Shapur intended a permanent defense force against other Arabs of the desert, especially those allied with Rome. Shapur also built a line of fortifications in the west on the model of the Roman system of ''limes'', which impressed the Sassanids.<ref>Frye (1993), 139; Levi (1994), 192</ref>

By the beginning of Sassanid rule, a number of buffer states existed between the empires. These were absorbed by the central state over time, and by the 7th century the last buffer state, the Arab Lakhmids of [[Al-Hirah]], was annexed to the Sassanid Empire. Frye notes that in the 3rd century&nbsp;AD such client states played an important role in Roman&ndash;Sassanid relations, but both empires gradually replaced them by an organized defense system run by the central government and based on the ''limes'' and the fortified frontier cities, such as Dara.<ref name="Fr 139">Frye (1993), 139</ref> Recent studies and assessments comparing the Sassanids and Parthians have reaffirmed the superiority of Sassanid siegecraft, [[military engineer]]ing, and organization,<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080218155534.htm Excavations In Iran Unravel Mystery Of "Red Snake"], Science Daily; Levi (1994), 192</ref> as well as ability to build defensive works.<ref>Rekavandi&ndash;Sauer&ndash;Wilkinson&ndash;Nokandeh, [http://www.archaeology.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1555&Itemid=27 The Enigma of the Red Snake]</ref>

==Assessments==
The Roman&ndash;Persian Wars have been characterized as "futile" and too "depressing and tedious to contemplate".<ref>Brazier (2001), 42</ref> Prophetically, [[Cassius Dio]]  noted their "never-ending cycle of armed confrontations" and observed that "it is shown by the facts themselves that [Severus'] conquest has been a source of constant wars and great expense to us. For it yields very little and uses up vast sums; and now that we have reached out to peoples who are neighbor of the Medes and the Parthians rather than of ourselves, we are always, one might say, fighting the battles of those peoples."<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXV, 3.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/75*.html 2&ndash;3]<br/>* Garnsey&ndash;Saller (1987), 8</ref> In the long series of wars between the two powers, the frontier in upper Mesopotamia remained more or less constant. Historians point out that the stability of the frontier over the centuries is remarkable, although Nisibis, Singara, Dara and other cities of upper Mesopotamia changed hands from time to time, and the possession of these frontier cities gave one empire a trade advantage over the other. As Frye states:<ref name="Fr 139" />

{{quote|''One has the impression that the blood spilled in the warfare between the two states brought as little real gain to one side or the other as the few meters of land gained at terrible cost in the trench warfare of the First World War.''}}

Both sides attempted to justify their respective military goals in both active and reactive ways. The Roman quest for world domination was accompanied by a sense of mission and pride in [[Western culture|Western civilization]] and by ambitions to become a guarantor of peace and order. Roman sources reveal long-standing prejudices with regard to the Eastern powers' customs, religious structures, languages, and forms of government. [[John F. Haldon]] underscores that "although the conflicts between Persia and East Rome revolved around issues of strategic control around the eastern frontier, yet there was always a religious-ideological element present". From the time of Constantine on, Roman emperors appointed themselves as the protectors of Christians of Persia.<ref>Barnes (1985), 126</ref> This attitude created intense suspicions of the loyalties of Christians living in Sassanid Iran and often led to Roman&ndash;Persian tensions or even military confrontations.<ref>Sozomen, ''Ecclesiastical History'', II, [http://www.freewebs.com/vitaphone1/history/sozomen.html#P3230_1341005 15]<br/>* McDonough (2006), 73</ref> A characteristic of the final phase of the conflict, when what had begun in 611&ndash;612 as a raid was soon transformed into a war of conquest, was the pre-eminence of the Cross as a symbol of imperial victory and of the strongly religious element in the Roman imperial propaganda; Heraclius himself cast Khosrau as the enemy of God, and authors of the 6th and 7th centuries were fiercely hostile to Persia.<ref>Haldon (1999), 20; Isaak (1998), 441</ref> This tradition of a "pro-Roman" historical scholarship prevailed for centuries, and it was not until recently that scholars adopted a broader approach and attempted to illuminate the lesser-known Persian position.<ref>Dignas&ndash;Winter (2007), [http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/49258/excerpt/9780521849258_excerpt.pdf 1&ndash;3] (PDF)</ref>

==Historiography==
[[File:HumiliationValerianusHolbein.jpg|thumb|left|The Humiliation of Valerian by Shapur ([[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1521, pen and black ink on a chalk sketch, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]])]]
The sources for the history of Parthia and the wars with Rome are scant and scattered. The Parthians followed the Achaemenid tradition and favored oral [[historiography]], which assured the corruption of their history once they had been vanquished. The main sources of this period are thus [[Roman historiography|Roman]] ([[Tacitus]], [[Marius Maximus]], and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]) and [[Greek historiography|Greek historians]] ([[Herodian]], [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Plutarch]]). The 13th book of the [[Sibylline oracles|Sibylline Oracles]] narrates the effects of the Roman&ndash;Persian Wars in Syria from the reign of Gordian III to the domination of the province by Odaenathus of Palmyra. With the end of Herodian's record, all contemporary chronological narratives of Roman history are lost, until the narratives of [[Lactantius]] and [[Eusebius]] at the beginning of the 4th century, both from a Christian perspective.<ref>Dodgeon&ndash;Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), I, 5; Potter (2004), 232&ndash;233</ref>

The principal sources for the early Sassanid period are not contemporary. Among them the most important are the Greeks [[Agathias]] and [[Malalas]], the Persians [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]] and [[Ferdowsi]], the Armenian [[Agathangelos]], and the Syriac Chronicles of Edessa and Arbela, most of whom depended on late Sassanid sources, especially [[Khwaday-Namag]]. The [[Augustan History]] is neither contemporary nor reliable, but it is the chief narrative source for Severus and Carus. The trilingual (Greek, Parthian, and Middle Persian) inscriptions of Shapur are primary sources.<ref>Frye (2005), 461&ndash;463; Shahbazi, [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v12f3/v12f3036b.html Historiography]</ref> These were isolated attempts at approaching written historiography however, and by the end of the 4th century&nbsp;AD, even the practice of carving rock reliefs and leaving short inscriptions was abandoned by the Sassanids.<ref name="Iranica">Shahbazi, [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v12f3/v12f3036b.html Historiography]</ref>

For the period between 353 and 378, there is an eyewitness source to the main events on the eastern frontier in the ''Res Gestae'' of [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]. For the events covering the period between the 4th and the 6th century, the works of [[Sozomenus]], [[Zosimus]], [[Priscus]], and [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]] are especially valuable.<ref>Dodgeon&ndash;Greatrex&ndash;Lieu (2002), I, 7</ref> The single most important source for Justinian's Persian wars up to 553 is [[Procopius]]. His continuators [[Agathias]] and [[Menander Protector]] offer many important details as well. [[Theophylact Simocatta]] is the main source for the reign of Maurice,<ref>Boyd (1999), 160</ref> while [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]], [[Chronicon Paschale]] and the poems of [[George of Pisidia]] are useful sources for the last Roman&ndash;Persian war. In addition to Byzantine sources, two Armenian historians, [[Sebeos]] and [[Movses Khorenatsi|Movses]], contribute to the coherent narrative of Heraclius' war and are regarded by Howard-Johnston as "the most important of extant non-Muslim sources".<ref>Howard-Johnston (2006), 42&ndash;43</ref>
