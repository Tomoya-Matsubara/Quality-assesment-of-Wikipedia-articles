The highway is entirely within [[Roscommon County, Michigan|Roscommon County]] in the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]].

==History==
M-157 was originally designated in 1931 as a connector route between M-55 and [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US&nbsp;27]] (present day M-18).<ref name="MSHD31-07">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=July 1, 1931 |cartography= H.M.

A new alignment, the present-day routing of M-157, was then commissioned just to the east.<ref name="MSHD32-10">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=October 1, 1932 |cartography= H.M.
