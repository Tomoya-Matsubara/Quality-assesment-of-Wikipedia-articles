The '''social sciences''' comprise academic disciplines concerned with the study of the social life of human groups and individuals including [[anthropology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[human geography]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]].

== History of the social sciences ==
{{main|History of the social sciences}}

The word "science" is older than its modern use. Through the influence of [[positivism]], the word has become a short-form for "[[natural science]]". It is a recent development that society has become the object of an organized body of knowledge which can be standardized and taught objectively, while following its own rules and methodology.

=== Ancient Greece ===
{{seealso|Ancient Greece}}
In [[ancient philosophy]], there was no difference between [[mathematics]] and the study of [[history]], [[poetry]] or [[politics]].<ref>Ching-Yung Lin - University of Columbia http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~cylin/ibm/cylin-projects-sc.html</ref> Only with the development of [[mathematical proof]] did there gradually arise a perceived difference between "scientific" disciplines and others. Thus, [[Aristotle]] studied [[Orbit|planetary motion]] and poetry with the same methods, and [[Plato]] mixed [[geometrical]] proofs with his demonstration on the state of intrinsic knowledge.

=== Augustine ===
[[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] in the 5th century AD. Bruce Haddock, in 'The Political Classics: Essential Texts from Plato to Rousseau' ([[OUP]] 1992), describes the work as '' a veritable encyclopedia of late Roman culture... [a] penetrating account of human motivation.''..

Significant contributions to the social sciences were made by [[Islamic science|Muslim scientists]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. [[Ab<U+016B> al-Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>|Al-Biruni]] (973<U+2013>1048) has been called "the first [[anthropology|anthropologist]]".<ref name=Ahmed>Akbar S. Ahmed (1984). "Al-Biruni: The First Anthropologist", ''RAIN'' '''60''', p. 9-10.</ref> He wrote detailed comparative studies on the [[anthropology]] of peoples, religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and [[South Asia]]. Al-Biruni's anthropology of religion was only possible for a scholar deeply immersed in the lore of other nations.<ref>J. T. Walbridge (1998). "Explaining Away the Greek Gods in Islam", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''59''' (3), p. 389-403.</ref> 
Biruni has also been praised by several scholars for his [[Islam]]ic anthropology).<ref>"Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.</ref>

He is best known for his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (''Prolegomenon'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]).

=== European thought ===
{{seealso|Age of Enlightenment}}

After the fall of Rome, which did little in the way of science, theorizing was transferred to the priesthood and a group of scholars known as the scholastics. Prominent thinkers of the [[Dark Ages]] such as [[Abelard]], [[Erigena]], [[St. Anselm]] and [[John of Salisbury]] made few comments on economic analysis. [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the 13th century expressed interest in political sociology and wrote on some economics. Near the [[Renaissance]] which began around the 14th century Buridanus and Oresmius wrote on money. In the 15th century St. Atonine of Florence wrote of a comprehensive economic process. In the 16th century Leonard de Leys (Lessius), Juan de Lego, and particularly Luis Molina wrote on economic topics. These writers focused on explaining property as something for "public good".<ref name=Schumpeter1954>{{cite book |  url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en  | title =  History of economic analysis | year = 1954 | page = 70-142 author = Schumpeter JA. | accessdate = 2009-04-21}}</ref>

Representative figures of the 17th century include [[David Hartley]], Hugo Grotius, [[Thomas Hobbes]], John Locke, and Samuel von Putendorf. Thomas Hobbes argued that [[deductive reasoning]] from [[axiom]]s created a scientific framework, and hence his ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'' was a scientific description of a political [[commonwealth]].  In the eighteenth century social science was called moral philosophy, as contrasted from natural philosophy and mathematics, and included the study of natural theology, natural ethics, natural jurisprudence, and policy ("police"), which included economics and finance ("revenue"). Pure philosophy, logic, literature, and history were outside these two categories. [[Adam Smith]] was a professor of moral philosophy, and he was taught by [[Francis Hutcheson]]. Figures of the time included [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Quesnay]], Rousseau, [[Giambattista Vico]],  [[William Godwin]], [[Gabriel Bonnet de Mably]], and [[Andre Morellet]]. The [[Encyclop<U+00E9>die]] of the time contained various works on the social sciences.<ref name=Schumpeter1954/>

=== Nineteenth century ===
{{seealso|Nineteenth century}}
The term "social science" first appeared in the 1824 book ''An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness; applied to the Newly Proposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth'' by [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] (1775<U+2013>1833). [[Auguste Comte]] (1797<U+2013>1857) argued that ideas pass through three rising stages, [[theological]], [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]]. He defined the difference as the first being rooted in assumption, the second in [[critical thinking]], and the third in positive observation. This framework, still rejected by many, encapsulates the thinking which was to push [[economic]] study from being a descriptive to a mathematically based discipline. [[Karl Marx]] was one of the first writers to claim that his methods of research represented a [[science|scientific]] view of history in this model.

With the late 19th century, attempts to apply equations to statements about [[human behavior]] became increasingly common. Among the first were the "Laws" of [[philology]], which attempted to map the change over time of sounds in a [[language]]. 

It was with the work of [[Charles Darwin]] that the descriptive version of [[social theory]] received another shock. [[Biology]] had, seemingly, resisted mathematical study, and yet the [[Natural Selection|theory of natural selection]] and the implied idea of [[genetic inheritance]] - later found to have been enunciated by [[Gregor Mendel]], seemed to point in the direction of a scientific biology based, like [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], on mathematical relationships.

=== Twentieth century ===
{{seealso|Twentieth century}}
In the first half of the 20th century, [[statistics]] became a free-standing discipline of [[applied mathematics]]. Statistical methods were used confidently, for example in an increasingly statistical view of biology. 

The first thinkers to attempt to combine inquiry of the type they saw in Darwin with exploration of human relationships, which, [[evolution]]ary theory implied, would be based on selective forces, were [[Freud]] in Austria and [[William James]] in the [[United States]]. Freud's theory of the functioning of the [[mind]], and James' work on experimental [[psychology]] would have enormous impact on those that followed. Freud, in particular, created a framework which would appeal not only to those studying psychology, but artists and writers as well.

One of the most persuasive advocates for the view of scientific treatment of philosophy would be [[John Dewey]] (1859<U+2013>1952). He began, as Marx did, in an attempt to weld [[Hegelian]] [[idealism]] and [[logic]] to experimental science, for example in his ''Psychology'' of 1887. However, he abandoned Hegelian constructs. Influenced by both [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]], he joined the movement in America called [[pragmatism]]. He then formulated his basic doctrine, enunciated in essays such as "The Influence of Darwin on Philosophy" (1910).

This idea, based on his theory of how [[organism]]s respond, states that there are three phases to the process of inquiry:

# Problematic Situation, where the typical response is inadequate.
# Isolation of Data or subject matter.
# Reflective, which is tested empirically.

With the rise of the idea of quantitative measurement in the physical sciences, for example [[Lord Rutherford]]'s famous maxim that any knowledge that one cannot measure numerically "is a poor sort of knowledge", the stage was set for the conception of the humanities as being precursors to "social science."

This change was not, and is not, without its detractors, both inside of academia and outside. The range of critiques begin from those who believe that the [[physical sciences]] are qualitatively different from social sciences {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, through those who do not believe in statistical science of any kind {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, through those who disagree with the [[methodology]] and kinds of conclusion of social science {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, to those who believe the entire framework of scientificizing these disciplines is mostly from a desire for prestige.

Some social science subfields have become very quantitative in methodology. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it have made many of the natural sciences interested on some aspects of social science methodology.<ref>Vessuri, Hebe. (2000). "Ethical Challenges for the Social Sciences on the Threshold of the 21st Century." Current Sociology 50, no. 1 (January): 135-150. [http://www.web-miner.com/socsciethics.htm], Social Science Ethics: A Bibliography, Sharon Stoerger MLS, MBA </ref> Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of [[medicine]], [[sociobiology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[bioeconomics]] and the [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]]. Increasingly, quantitative and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences.

In 1924, prominent social scientists established the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] honor society for the social sciences.  Among its key objectives were to promote interdisciplinary cooperation and develop an integrated theory of human personality and organization.  Toward these ends, a journal for interdisciplinary scholarship in the various social sciences and lectureship grants were established.

=== Rise ===
[[Theodore Porter]] argued in ''The Rise of Statistical Thinking'' that the effort to provide a synthetic social science is a matter of both administration and discovery combined, and that the rise of social science was, therefore, marked by both pragmatic needs as much as by theoretical purity. An example of this is the rise of the concept of [[IQ|Intelligence Quotient]], or IQ.  It is unclear precisely what is being measured, but the measurement is useful in that it predicts success in various endeavors.

The rise of [[industrialism]] had created a series of [[social]], [[economic]], and [[political]] problems, particularly in managing supply and demand in their political economy, the [[Resource management|management of resources]] for [[military]] and developmental use, the creation of mass [[education system]]s to train individuals in symbolic reasoning and problems in managing the effects of [[industrialization]] itself. The perceived senselessness of the "Great War" as it was then called, of 1914<U+2013>18, now called [[World War I]], based in what were perceived to be "emotional" and "irrational" decisions, provided an immediate impetus for a form of decision making that was more "scientific" and easier to manage. Simply put, to manage the new multi-national enterprises, private and governmental, required more data. More data required a means of reducing it to information upon which to make decisions. Numbers and charts could be interpreted more quickly and moved more efficiently than long texts. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it have made many of the so-called hard sciences dependent on social science methodology. Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of [[medicine]], [[neuropsychology]], [[bioeconomics]] and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences.

In the 1930s this new model of managing decision making became cemented with the [[New Deal]] in the US, and in Europe with the increasing need to manage industrial production and governmental affairs. Institutions such as [[The New School for Social Research]], [[International Institute of Social History]], and departments of "social research" at prestigious universities were meant to fill the growing demand for individuals who could quantify human interactions and produce models for decision making on this basis.

Coupled with this pragmatic need was the belief that the clarity and simplicity of mathematical expression avoided systematic errors of holistic thinking and logic rooted in traditional argument. This trend, part of the larger movement known as [[modernism]] provided the rhetorical edge for the expansion of social sciences.

=== Present state ===
There continues to be little movement toward consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories which, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks. See [[consilience]].

=== Studying Social Science ===
Universities throughout the world consider the study of the social sciences as vital for the future of society, and most cater for many degrees in the multiplicity of social science fields.

In the United States, a degree candidate who has studied a field within the social sciences may earn a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, particularly if the field was within one of the traditional "[[liberal arts]]" - such as history - or may earn a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree, as the social sciences constitute one of the two main branches of "science" (the other being the "natural sciences").  In addition, beginning in the 20th century, specialized degrees have been created at some institutions specifically for a social science - such as [[Bachelor of Economics]] degree, though such specialized degrees are relatively rare in the United States.

The [[Bachelor of Social Science]], [[BSocSc]] or B.Soc.Sc is  a degree targeted at the social sciences in particular, it is often more flexible and in-depth than other degrees which also include social science subjects. The [[Bachelor of Social Science]] can be studied at the [[University of Adelaide]],  [[University of Waikato]] ([[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[New Zealand]]), [[University of Sydney]] ([[Sydney]], ([[Australia]]), [[University of New South Wales]] ([[Sydney]]), [University of Hong Kong]] ([[Hong Kong]], [[China]]), [[University of Manchester]] ([[Manchester]], [[England]]), [[Lincoln University]] ([[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]), [[National University of Malaysia]] ([[Bangi]], [[Malaysia]]), and [[University of Queensland]] ([[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]).

== Branches of Social Science ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2009}}

=== Anthropology ===
{{main|Anthropology}}
{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}
[[Anthropology]] is the holistic discipline that deals with the integration of different aspects of the Social Sciences, [[Humanities]], and [[Human biology|Human Biology]]. It includes [[Archaeology]], [[Prehistory]], [[Physical Anthropology|Physical]] or [[Physical Anthropology|Biological Anthropology]], [[Anthropological Linguistics]], [[Social Anthropology|Social]] and [[Cultural Anthropology]], [[Ethnology]] and [[Ethnography]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word anthropos (<U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B8><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C2>) is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "human being" or "person." [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences."

=== Economics ===
{{main|Economics}}
[[File:Market-Chichicastenango.jpg|thumb|Buyers bargain for good prices while sellers put forth their best front in [[Chichicastenango]] Market, [[Guatemala]].]]
[[Economics]] is a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109547?query=Economics&ct= economics - Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The word "economics" is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|<U+03BF><U+1F36><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>}} [''oikos''], "family, household, estate," and  <U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C2> [''nomos''], "custom, law," and hence means "household management" or "management of the state." An [[economist]] is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a university [[academic degree|degree]] in the subject. The classic brief definition of economics, set out by [[Lionel Robbins]] in 1932, is "the science which studies human behavior as a relation between scarce means having alternative uses." Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no [[economic problem]]. Briefer yet is "the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants" and "the study of the financial aspects of human behaviour."

Economics has two broad branches: [[microeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a [[household]], firm and [[macroeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. Another division of the subject distinguishes [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from [[normative economics]], which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve [[Subjectivity|subjective]] value judgments. Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis. Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the [[physiocrats|physiocratic school]]. Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to social situations where there is no monetary consideration, such as [[public choice theory|politics]], [[law]], [[Experimental economics|psychology]], [[Economic history|history]], [[religion]], [[marriage]] and family life, and other social interactions.

This paradigm crucially assumes (1) that resources are [[scarcity|scarce]] because they are not sufficient to satisfy all wants, and (2) that "economic value" is willingness to pay as revealed for instance by market (arms' length) transactions. Rival schools of thought, such as [[heterodox economics]], [[institutional economics]], [[Marxist economics]], [[socialism]], [[green economics]], and [[economic sociology]], make other grounding assumptions, such as that economics primarily deals with the exchange of value, and that labor (human effort) is the source of all value.

The expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].<ref name="Imperialism">[[Edward Lazear|Lazear, Edward P.]] (2000|. "Economic Imperialism," ''Quarterly Journal Economics'', 115(1)|, p[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2586936 p. 99]-146.

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education}}
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|right|thumb|A depiction of Europe's oldest university, the [[University of Bologna]], Italy]]
Education [[List of education topics|encompasses]] [[teaching]] and [[learning]] specific [[skill]]s, and also something less tangible but more profound: the imparting of [[knowledge]], positive [[judgement]] and well-developed [[wisdom]]. Education has as one of its fundamental aspects the imparting of [[culture]] from generation to generation (see [[socialization]]). To educate means 'to draw out', from the Latin ''educare'', or to facilitate the realization of an individual's potential and talents. It is an application of [[pedagogy]], a body of theoretical and applied research relating to teaching and learning and draws on many disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].<ref>[http://www.teachersmind.com/education.htm An overview of education]</ref>

The education of an individual human begins at birth and continues throughout life. (Some believe that education begins even before birth, as evidenced by some parents' playing music or reading to the baby in the womb in the hope it will influence the child's development.) For some, the struggles and triumphs of daily [[personal life|life]] provide far more instruction than does formal [[school]]ing (thus [[Mark Twain]]'s admonition to "never let school interfere with your education"). [[Family]] members may have a profound educational effect <U+2014> often more profound than they realize <U+2014> though family teaching may function very informally.

=== Geography ===
{{Main|Geography}}
[[File:Physical world.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Earth]]]]
Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy. The latter examines the natural environment and how the [[climate]], [[vegetation]] & life, [[soil]], [[water]] and [[landforms]] are produced and interact.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=Association of American Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |dateformat=mdy|accessdate=October 9 2006 }}</ref> As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is [[environmental geography]]. Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans.<ref name="Hayes-Bohanan">{{cite web |last=Hayes-Bohanan |first=James |title=What is Environmental Geography, Anyway? |url=http://webhost.bridgew.edu/jhayesboh/environmentalgeography.htm |dateformat=mdy|accessdate=October 9 2006 }}</ref>

Geographers attempt to understand the [[earth]] in terms of physical and spatial relationships. The first geographers focused on the science of [[mapmaking]] and finding ways to precisely [[Map projection|project]] the surface of the earth. In this sense, geography bridges some gaps between the natural sciences and social sciences. [[Historical geography]] is often taught in a college in a unified Department of Geography.

Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline, closely related to [[Geographic Information Science|GISc]], that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment.  The fields of [[Urban Planning]], [[Regional Science]], and [[Planetology]] are closely related to geography. Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as [[Geographic Information Systems|GIS]], [[remote sensing]], [[aerial photography]], [[statistics]], and [[global positioning systems]] (GPS).

The field of geography is generally split into two distinct branches: physical and human. ''[[Physical geography]]'' examines phenomena related to [[Climatology|climate]], [[Oceanography|oceans]], [[Pedology (soil study)|soils]], and the [[Geodesy|measurement of earth]]. ''[[Human geography]]'' focuses on fields as diverse as [[Cultural geography]], [[Transportation geography|transportation]], [[Health geography|health]], [[Military geography|military operations]], and [[Urban geography|cities]]. Other [[Geography#Branches of geography|branches of geography]] include [[Social geography]], [[regional geography]], [[geomatics]], and [[environmental geography]].

=== History ===
{{main|History}}
History is the continuous, systematic [[narrative]] and [[research]] of past events as relating to the human species; as well as the study of all events in [[time]], in relation to humanity. There is much debate over history's classification of academe, for instance in the [[United States]] the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] includes history in its definition of a [[Humanities]] (as it does for applied Linguistics)<ref>[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/overview.html Overview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. However the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] classifies History as a Social science.<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/researchdoc/summary.html Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States: Continuity and Change<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> History can be seen as the sum total of many things taken together and the spectrum of events occurring in action following in order leading from the past to the present and into the future. The ''[[historical method]]'' comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

=== Law ===
{{main|Law}}
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]]]]
Law in common parlance, means a rule which (unlike a rule of ethics) is capable of enforcement through institutions.<ref>{{cite book|title=Crimes Against Humanity|first=Geoffrey| last=Robertson| authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|year=2006| publisher=Penguin|pages=90| isbn=9780141024639}}</ref> The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects.

Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social sciences and humanity. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long lasting effects on the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed<ref>see [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]</ref> and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the Latin word ''lex''.<ref>see [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal Mirriam-Webster's Dictionary]</ref>

=== Linguistics ===
{{main|Linguistics}}
[[File:Ferdinand de Saussure.jpg|thumb|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], recognized as the father of modern [[linguistics]]]]
Linguistics investigates the cognitive and social aspects of human language. The field is divided into areas that focus on aspects of the linguistic signal, such as [[syntax]] (the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences), [[semantics]] (the study of meaning), [[phonetics]] (the study of speech sounds) and [[phonology]] (the study of the abstract sound system of a particular language); however, work in areas like [[evolutionary linguistics]] (the study of the origins and evolution of language) and [[psycholinguistics]] (the study of psychological factors in human language) cut across these divisions. 

The overwhelming majority of modern research in linguistics takes a predominantly [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] perspective (focusing on language at a particular point in time), and a great deal of it<U+2014>partly owing to the influence of [[Noam Chomsky]]<U+2014>aims at formulating theories of the cognitive processing of language. However, language does not exist in a vacuum, or only in the brain, and approaches like contact linguistics, [[Creole language|creole]] studies, [[discourse analysis]], social interactional linguistics, and [[sociolinguistics]] explore language in its social context. Sociolinguistics often makes use of traditional quantitative analysis and [[statistics]] in investigating the frequency of features, while some disciplines, like contact linguistics, focus on qualitative analysis. While certain areas of linguistics can thus be understood as clearly falling within the social sciences, other areas, like [[acoustic phonetics]] and [[neurolinguistics]], draw on the natural sciences.  Linguistics draws only secondarily on the humanities, which played a rather greater role in linguistic inquiry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Ferdinand Saussure]] is considered the father of modern linguistics.

=== Political science ===
{{main|Political science|Politics}}
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|left|thumb|[[Aristotle]] asserted that man is a political animal in his book ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'']]
[[Political science]] is an [[academia|academic]] and [[research]] discipline that deals with the theory and practice of [[politics]] and the description and analysis of [[political system]]s and political behavior. Fields and subfields of political science include political economy,[[political philosophy|political theory and philosophy]], [[civics]] and [[comparative politics]], theory of [[direct democracy]], apolitical governance, participatory direct democracy, national systems, cross-national political analysis, political development, [[international relations]], [[foreign policy]], [[international law]], politics, [[public administration]], administrative behavior, public law, judicial behavior, and [[Policy|public policy]].  Political science also studies [[power in international relations]] and the theory of [[Great powers]] and [[Superpowers]].

Political science is methodologically diverse.  Approaches to the discipline include classical political philosophy, [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretivism]], [[structuralism]], and [[behavioralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], pluralism, and [[institutionalism]]. Political science, as one of the [[social science]]s, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]], [[case studies]], and model building. [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] is credited with coining the phrase "political science" while teaching history at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

==== Public Administration ====
{{main|Public administration}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

One of the main branches of political science, '''public administration''' can be broadly described as the development, implementation and study of branches of government [[policy]].  The pursuit of the public good by enhancing [[civil society]] and [[social justice]] is the ultimate goal of the field. Though public administration has historically referred to as government management, it increasingly encompasses [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) that also operate with a similar, primary dedication to the betterment of humanity. 

Differentiating public administration from business administration, a closely related field, has become a popular method for defining the discipline.  First, the goals of public administration are more closely related to those often cited as goals of the American founders and democratic people in general.  That is, public employees work to improve equality, justice, security, efficiency, effectiveness, and, at times, for profit.  These values help to both differentiate the field from business administration, primarily concerned with profit, and define the discipline.   Second, public administration is a relatively new, multidisciplinary field.  [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s ''The Study of Administration'' is frequently cited as the seminal work.  Dr. Wilson advocated a more professional operation of public officials' daily activities.  Further, the future president identified the necessity in the United States of a separation between party politics and good [[bureaucracy]], which has also been a lasting theme.  

The multidisciplinary nature of public administration is related to a third defining feature: administrative duties.  Public administrators work in public agencies, at all levels of government, and perform a wide range of tasks.  Public administrators collect and analyze data (statistics), monitor fiscal operations (budgets, accounts, and cash flow), organize large events and meetings, draft legislation, develop policy, and frequently execute legally mandated, government activities.  Regarding this final facet, public administrators find themselves serving as parole officers, secretaries, note takers, paperwork processors, records keepers, notaries of the public, cashiers, and managers.  Indeed, the discipline couples well with many vocational fields such as information technology, finance, law, and engineering.  When it comes to the delivery and evaluation of public services, a public administrator is undoubtedly involved.

=== Psychology ===
{{main|Psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]] was the founder of [[experimental psychology]]]]
[[Psychology]] is an [[academic]] and [[applied science|applied]] field involving the study of  behavior and mental processes. Psychology also refers to the application of such [[knowledge]] to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental illness]].   

Psychology differs from [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]] in seeking to capture explanatory generalizations about the [[mental function]] and overt [[behaviour]] of individuals, while the other disciplines focus on creating descriptive generalizations about the functioning of social groups or situation-specific human behavior.  In practice, however, there is quite a lot of cross-fertilization that takes place among the various fields.  Psychology differs from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behavior, and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of [[neuropsychology]] combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they have subjectively produced. 
Many people associate Psychology with Clinical Psychology which focuses on assessment and treatment of problems in living and psychopathology.  In reality, Psychology has myriad specialties including: Social Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Industrial-Organizational Psychology, [[Mathematical psychology]], Neuropsychology, and Quantitative Analysis of Behaviour to name only a few. The word ''psychology'' comes from the [[ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]] <U+03C8><U+03C5><U+03C7><U+03AE>, ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' ("soul", "mind") and ''[[-logy|logy]]'', study).

Psychology is a very broad science that is rarely tackled as a whole, major block. Although some subfields encompass a natural science base and a social science application, others can be clearly distinguished as having little to do with the social sciences or having a lot to do with the social sciences. For example, biological psychology is considered a natural science with a social scientific application (as is clinical [[medicine]]), social and occupational psychology are, generally speaking, purely social sciences, whereas neuropsychology is a natural science that lacks application out of the scientific tradition entirely. In British universities, emphasis on what tenet of psychology a student has studied and/or concentrated is communicated through the degree conferred: B.Psy. indicates a balance between natural and social sciences, B.Sc. indicates a strong (or entire) scientific concentration, whereas a B.A. underlines a majority of social science credits.

=== Social Work ===
{{main|Social Work}}

[[Social Work]]  is concerned with social problems, their causes, their solutions and their human impacts. Social workers work with individuals, families, groups, organizations and communities. Social Work is the profession committed to the pursuit of social justice, to the enhancement of the quality of life, and to the development of the full potential of each individual, group and community in society. Social refers to human society or its organization. stem "soci-" which is from the Latin word socius, meaning member, friend, or ally, thus referring to people in general. It is a social science involving the application of social theory and research methods to the study and improve  the [[life|lives]] of [[human|people]], [[group (sociology)|groups]], and [[society|societies]]. Social work is unique in that it seeks to simultaneously navigate across and within micro , mezzo, and macro systems -in order to sufficiently address and resolve social issues at every level. Social work incorporates and utilizes all of the social sciences as a means to improve the human condition.

Social work bases its methodology on a systematic body of evidence-based knowledge derived from research and practice evaluation, including local and indigenous knowledge specific to its context. It recognizes the complexity of interactions between human beings and their environment, and the capacity of people both to be affected by and to alter the multiple influences upon them including bio-psychosocial factors. The social work profession draws on theories of human development and behaviour and social systems to analyse complex situations and to facilitate individual, organizational, social and cultural changes. (International Federation of Social Workers).

In social work research there is a great deal of traditional research, both qualitative and quantitative being carried out, primarily by university-based researchers, but also in different fields, by researchers based in institutes, foundations, or social service agencies. Meanwhile, the majority of social work practitioners continue to look elsewhere for knowledge. This is a state of affairs that has persisted since the outset of the profession in the first decade of the twentieth century. One reason for the practice-research gap is that practitioners deal with situations that are unique and idiosyncratic, while research deals with regularities and aggregates. The translation between the two is often imperfect. A hopeful development for bridging this gap is the compilation in many practice fields of collections of "best practices," largely taken from research findings, but also distilled from the experience of respected practitioners.

One of the most prominent organizations promoting social work research science is The Society for Social Work and Research (http://www.sswr.org/) which is a non-profit professional society incorporated in the State of New York in 1993. The Society is devoted to the involvement of social workers, other social work faculty, and social work students in research and to promotion of human welfare through research and research applications.

=== Sociology ===
{{main|Sociology}}
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emile Durkheim]] is considered as one of the founding fathers of sociology.]]
[[Sociology]] is the study of society and human social action. It generally concerns itself with the [[social rule]]s and [[process (general)|processes]] that bind and separate people not only as [[individual]]s, but as members of [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[Group (sociology)|groups]], [[Community|communities]] and [[social institution|institutions]], and includes the examination of the organization and development of human social life. The sociological field of interest ranges from the analysis of short [[social contact|contacts]] between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of [[globalization|global social processes]]. Most sociologists work in one or more [[Subfields of sociology|subfields]].

The meaning of the word comes from the suffix "-ology" which means "study of," derived from Greek, and the stem "soci-" which is from the Latin word socius, meaning member, friend, or ally, thus referring to people in general. It is a social science involving the application of social theory and research methods to the study of the [[social]] [[life|lives]] of [[human|people]], [[group (sociology)|groups]], and [[society|societies]], sometimes defined as the study of [[social interactions]]. It is a relatively new [[academic discipline]] which evolved in the early 19th century. 

Because sociology is such a broad discipline, it can be difficult to define, even for professional sociologists. One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-fields that examine different dimensions of society. For example, [[social stratification]] studies inequality and class structure; [[demography]] studies changes in a population size or type; [[criminology]] examines criminal behavior and deviance; [[political sociology]] studies government and laws; and the sociology of race and [[sociology of gender]] examine society's racial and gender cleavages. 

Sociological methods, theories, and concepts may inspire sociologists to explore the origins of [[common sense|commonly accepted]] conventions. Sociology offers insights about the social world that extend beyond explanations that rely on individual quirks and personalities. Sociologist may find general social patterns in studying the behaviour of particular individuals and groups. This specific approach to social reality is sometimes called the [[sociological perspective]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Sociologists use a diversity of research methods, including [[case studies]], [[historiography|historical research]], [[interviewing]], [[participant observation]], [[social network analysis]], [[statistical survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]], and model building, among other approaches. Since the late 1970s, many sociologists have tried to make the discipline useful for non-academic purposes. The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, developers, and others interested in resolving social problems and formulating [[Policy|public policy]], through subdisciplinary areas such as [[evaluation research]], methodological [[assessment]], and [[public sociology]].
New sociological sub-fields continue to appear - such as [[community studies]], [[computational sociology]], [[network analysis]], [[actor-network theory]] and a growing list, many of which are [[List of academic disciplines|cross-disciplinary]] in nature.

== Social theory and research methods ==
Many social scientists emphasize the subjective nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of [[critical theory]], [[dialectical materialism]], [[feminist theory]], [[phronetic social science]], assorted branches of [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] such as [[Proletarian revolution|revolutionary theory]] and [[Class conflict|class theory]], [[Post-colonialism|post-colonial theory]], [[postmodernism]] as well as the related [[Anti-intellectualism|intellectual criticalism]] and [[Antiscience|scientific criticalism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[Irrationalism|rational criticalism]], [[social constructionism]], [[structuralism]], and [[structural functionalism]]. 

And many scientists emphasize the (difficult to achieve) goal of objective research or [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. These scientists emphasize the importance of measurement and analysis. Research methods attempt to reduce [[quantitative method|quantitative]] and [[qualitative method|qualitative]] aspects of social phenomena into numerical variables. Questionnaires, field-based data collection, archival database information and laboratory-based data collections are some of the measurement techniques used.

== Criticism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2007}}
The social sciences are sometimes criticized as being less scientific than the [[natural sciences]], in that they are seen as being less rigorous or empirical in their methods.  This claim has been made in the so-called [[Science Wars]] and is most commonly made when comparing social sciences to fields such as physics, chemistry or biology in which corroboration of the hypothesis is far more incisive with regard to data observed from specifically designed experiments. Social sciences can thus be deemed to be largely observational, in that explanations for cause-effect relationships are largely subjective. A limited degree of freedom is available in designing the factor setting for a particular observational study. Social scientists however, argue against such claims by pointing to the use of  a rich variety of scientific processes, mathematical proofs, and other methods in their professional literature. Flyvbjerg (2001) has argued that the discussion of whether natural science is more scientific than social science is futile; social science is best practiced as [[phronesis]], whereas natural science is best practiced as [[episteme]], in the classical Greek meaning of the terms, and both have important if different roles to play in the production of knowledge in society.

It has been argued that the social world is much too complex to be studied as one would study static molecules.  The actions or reactions of a molecule or chemical substance are always the same when placed in certain situations.  Humans, on the other hand, are much too complex for these traditional scientific methodologies.  Humans and society do not have certain rules that always have the same outcome and they cannot guarantee to react the same way to certain situations.

A third criticism is that social sciences tend to be compromised more frequently by politics, since results from social science may threaten certain centers of power in a society, particularly ones which fund the research institutions. Further, complexity exacerbates the problems, since observed social data may be the result of factors which are hard to evaluate in isolation.

Not all institutions recognize some fields listed above as social sciences or as being only social scientific. Some disciplines have characteristics of both the humanities, social and natural sciences: for example some subfields of [[anthropology]], such as [[biological anthropology]], are closely related to the natural sciences whereas [[archaeology]] and [[linguistics]] are social sciences, while cultural anthropology is very much linked with the humanities. Note that social science methodologies are being incorporated into so-called hard science fields like medicine, where a three-legged stool to the understanding of physical well-being is now emphasized in the medical curriculum: biological, socio-psychological, and environmental.

The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand [[encyclopedia]] of [[Diderot]], with articles from [[Rousseau]] and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in its specialised encyclopedias. The older editions are therefore of strong historical interest while the newest reflects current discussions and methodologies.
