The '''Sweet Track''' is an ancient [[causeway]] in the [[Somerset Levels]], England. It was built in 3807 or 3806 BC and has been claimed to be the oldest road in the world. It was the oldest [[timber trackway]] discovered in [[Northern Europe]] until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000 year-old trackway in [[Belmarsh (HM Prison)|Belmarsh prison]]. It is now known that the Sweet Track was largely built over the course of an earlier structure, the [[Post Track]].

The track extended across the marsh between what was then an island at [[Westhay]], although much of the marsh has now been drained, and a ridge of high ground at [[Shapwick, Somerset|Shapwick]], a distance close to {{convert|2000|m|ft}}. The track is one of a network that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Various artefacts, including a [[jadeite|jadeitite]] axe head, have been found along its length.

Construction was of crossed wooden poles which were driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was only used for a period of around 10 years and then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970 most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the [[British Museum]] and a reconstruction of a section was built at the [[Peat Moors Centre]] near [[Glastonbury]].

==Location==
The track was built between what was in the early 4th millennium BC an island at [[Westhay]], and a ridge of high ground at [[Shapwick, Somerset|Shapwick]] close to the [[River Brue]].  A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of pre-historic lake dwellings, and were likely to have been similar to the later [[Glastonbury Lake Village]] near [[Godney]], itself built on a [[Marsh|morass]] on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, [[bracken]], rubble and clay.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Iron Age Communities in Britain (4th Ed) |year=2005|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3lkEgdtOvGEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn=0415347793&cd=1#v=onepage&q |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, Oxon |isbn=0415347793 |page=266 }}</ref>

The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby.  These tracks connected settlements on the [[peat bog]], and include the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay, and Nidons trackways.<ref name="digitaldigging">{{cite web|title=Sweet Track <U+2013> Somerset Levels|url=http://digitaldigging.co.uk/maps/trackways/prehistoric-sweet-track-somerset-levels.html|publisher=Digital Digging|accessdate=8&nbsp;June 2010}}</ref> Sites such as the nearby [[Meare Pool]] provide evidence that the purpose of these structures was to enable easier travel between the settlements. Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of [[Raised bog|raised peat bogs]] around it, particularly during the [[Subatlantic]] climatic period ([[1st millennium BC]]), and [[Core sample|core sampling]] demonstrates that it is filled with at least {{convert|2|m|ft}} of detritus mud.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rippon|first=Stephen|year=2004|title=Making the Most of a Bad Situation?

The two villages within Meare Pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat, such as tents, windbreaks and animal folds. Clay was later spread over the peat, providing raised stands for occupation, industry and movement, and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chapmana|first=Henry P.|coauthors= Van de Noort, Robert|year=2001|title=High-Resolution Wetland Prospection, using GPS and GIS: Landscape Studies at Sutton Common (South Yorkshire), and Meare Village East (Somerset)|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=28|issue=4|pages=365<U+2013>375 |doi=10.1006/jasc.2000.0581|accessdate=11 July 2010|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WH8-45BT6MH-S&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=5d01004612f0220ca987f9ba64bf1175}}</ref>

The wood used to build the track is now classed as [[bog-wood]], the name given to wood that for long periods (sometimes hundreds of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from [[Decomposition|decaying]] by the [[acid]]ic and [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] bog conditions.  Bog-wood is usually stained brown by [[tannin]]s dissolved in the acidic water, and represents an early stage of [[fossil]]isation.  The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Department of the Environment]].<ref name="brunning">{{cite book|last=Brunning|first=Richard|title=Somerset Archaeology: Papers to Mark 150 Years of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society|year=2000|publisher=Somerset County Council|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/HES_150_Years_Chapter_11.pdf|format=PDF|editor=CJ Webster|chapter=11.

A [[geophysical]] survey of the area in 2008 showed unclear [[magnetometer]] data; the wood may be influencing the peat's [[hydrology]], causing the loss or collection of minerals within the pore water and peat matrix.<ref>{{cite web|last=Armstrong|first=K.|title=Archaeological geophysical prospection in peatland environments: Locating the Sweet Track at Canada Farm, Shapwick Heath (Somerset)|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/11145/1/armstrong_cheetham_abstract_v2_.pdf|work=EIGG 8th Meeting on Recent Work In Archaeological Geophysics, 16 Dec 2008, The Geological Society, Burlington House, London, UK.| format      =PDF|publisher=Bournemouth University|accessdate=8&nbsp;June 2010|coauthors=Cheetham, P|year=2008}}</ref>

==Builders==
The community that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised the area around 3900 BC and the evidence suggests that they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled.<ref name="Costen">{{cite book |author=Costen, M.

The centre was run by the Somerset Historic Environment Service, but was closed in October 2009 as a result of budget cuts imposed by [[Somerset County Council]]. The main exhibits are extant, but future public access is uncertain. Other samples of the track are held in the [[Somerset County Museum]].<ref name="digitaldigging"/>

Sections of the track have been designated as a [[Scheduled Monument]],<ref name="sshersweettrack"/> meaning that it is a "nationally important" historic building and [[archaeological site]] protected against unauthorised change.<ref name="schedule">{{citation |title=The Schedule of Monuments |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1369 |work=Pastscape |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref>  These sections are also included in [[English Heritage]]'s [[Heritage at Risk Register]].<ref>{{cite web|title=South West England|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/HAR_Register_South_West_2009/southwest-2009-har-register.pdf|work=Heritage at Risk|publisher=English Heritage|format=PDF|accessdate=30 June 2010|page=183}}</ref>
