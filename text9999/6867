"'''Let Me Think About It''' is a song by Danish [[Soul music|soul]] singer [[Ida Corr]] and Dutch [[House music|house]] DJ [[Fedde le Grand]]. It is a remix by le Grand of Corr's original track which appeared on her 2006 album ''Robosoul''. The song features vocals by Corr and Danish [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Burhan G]].

==Production==
In 2006 Ida Corr, Christian von Staffeldt aka Motrack and Burhan Genc wrote the track for Ida Corr's second album ''Robosoul''.<ref name="citytv">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_-2GNcSvqI City TV Interview]</ref> Corr, Motrack and Kasper Tranberg produced the original album version of the song.<ref name="wktu">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUhMlCMFrV4&fmt=18 WKTU Interview]</ref> soul version album.

In 2007 Fedde Le Grand heard the album version through Ida's label ''Lifted House''. He then produced a remix of the song and released it through his label ''[[Flamingo Recordings]]''.<ref name="citytv">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_-2GNcSvqI City TV Interview]</ref>

The remix has an electro and house feel, with a 'jerky' beat and also with an element of jazz. The original song uses less drums and has an acoustic-urban feel.

==Critical reception==
Alex Fletcher of [[Digital Spy]] gave the song four out of five stars, and wrote: "Fedde has teamed up with Ida Corr to produce another three minutes of thunderous dance-tastic frivolities. 'Let Me Think About It' couldn't possibly be any more of an [[Ibiza]] TUNE. It's the sound of [[Pete Tong]], [[Dave Pearce]] and [[Scott Mills]] stood screaming with a load of Club 18-30 reps, while some boozed-up bikini-clad temptress grinds up against you all soaked up into a CD package. Packed with parping horns, cascading synth beats and the sound of a fire alarm being played along to the theme from ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]''".<ref>{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|title=Music - Singles Review - Ida Corr vs Fedde Le Grand: 'Let Me Think About It'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a76279/ida-corr-vs-fedde-le-grand-let-me-think-about-it.html|date=25 September 2007|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=10 July 2010}}</ref>

==Music video==
In summer 2007 director [[Marcus Adams]] shot the [[music video]] for the remix in [[London]]. The video features Ida Corr with an afro hairdo and the dancers Anchelique Mariano, Dominique Tipper and Stephanie Fitzpatrick, dressed in a similar manner dancing and feigning to play various instruments. Dancer [[Jason Beitel]], who mimes to Burhan G's voice, is the male protagonist of the clip. Natricia Bernard did the choreography.<ref name="YouTube">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQTIEUzBOm8&fmt=18 Behind The Scenes]</ref>

==Chart performance==
The song is the third Danish single of Ida Corr's album ''Robosoul'' and the third single from Fedde le Grand, released in the [[UK]], following the No. 1 smash hit "[[Put Your Hands Up 4 Detroit]]", and the well-received collaboration with Danish singer [[Camille Jones]], "[[The Creeps]]".
"Let Me Think About It" became the most successful single for both artists. The single reached #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on the October 7, 2007 chart and stayed there for one more week.
It has peaked at #14 on the Australian [[ARIA Charts|ARIA]] Singles Chart, #58 in the Polish Singles Chart and #11 on South African Radio [[5FM]]. The single also peaked at #3 in [[Romania]].

In the [[United States]] it was released by Ida Corr (but listed as "Ida Corr vs. Fedde le Grand") and reached number one on [[Hot Dance Airplay|Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay]] chart on February 9, 2008, making it the first import single to reach the chart, up until the week ending March 1, when [[Warner Bros. Records]] picked up the single for a US commercial release. Many stations such as Hot 99.5, z100, and 102.7 (Kiss FM), Pulse 87 and WKTU added this song to their inventory due to high digital download sales.
