During the next season he signed for Croatian giants [[HNK Hajduk Split]] where he played until 1994 when he returned back to Zadar where he stayed for couple of months.

After time spent in Prva HNL he joined his first and only club abroad, the [[Slovenia]]n side [[NK Maribor]] where he had his best years. He played in Maribor for 8 seasons up until his retirement in 2005. During his time in Maribor he earned a status of club legend and is considered as one of the best defenders that ever played for ''the violets''.

According to his wishes he has played the first part of the season without payment from the club.<ref>http://24ur.com/sport/balajic-se-je-vrnil-v-maribor.html</ref> In his last couple of seasons he was also the team captain.

He has earned a total of 175 appearances for Maribor in Slovenian first league, [[Slovenian PrvaLiga|1.SNL]] where he scored 29 goals in the process.<ref>http://www.prvaliga.si/klubi/mostvo/igralec.asp?idi=39735&id=&all=1</ref>
