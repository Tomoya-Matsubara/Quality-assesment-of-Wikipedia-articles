'''Emmanuel Berl''' (2 August 1892 <U+2013> 21 September 1976) was a [[France|French]] [[journalist]], [[historian]] and [[essayist]]. He was born at [[Le V<U+00E9>sinet]] in the modern ''[[Departments of France|d<U+00E9>partement]]'' of [[Yvelines]], and is buried in the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]], Paris. In 1937 he married the singer, composer and film actress [[Mireille Hartuch]]; she had nicknamed him "Th<U+00E9>odore" (which is what appears on their tomb). Berl was the cousin of [[Lisette de Brinon]].

==Biography==
Emmanuel Berl was from an upper middle class Jewish family related to [[Bergson]] and [[Proust]] and the novelist and screenwriter Monique Lange. He studied [[philosophy]] before  volunteering for the armed services in 1914. Discharged in 1917 with a respiratory disease after having received the [[Croix de guerre]] (or, war cross), he joined the [[surrealists]], especially working with [[Louis Aragon]], [[Gaston Bergery]] and his former schoolmate from the Lyc<U+00E9>e Carnot, [[Pierre Drieu La Rochelle]]. In 1927, Berl and La Rochelle published a short-lived periodical: ''Les Derniers Jours''.  In 1928, with <U+00C9>douard Berth, [[Marcel D<U+00E9>at]], [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]] and [[Pierre Mend<U+00E8>s-France]], he took part in the editing of the ''Cahiers bleus'' which had just launched [[George Valois]]. The same year, he met [[Andr<U+00E9> Malraux]] to whom he dedicated his ''Mort de la pens<U+00E9>e bourgeoise'', a satire in which Emmanuel Berl called for a more committed culture and literature.

During the 1930s, he entered politics on the side of the radicals.  After working for the weekly ''Monde'', in 1932 he launched the weekly ''Marianne'', which was the leading weekly on the left until the appearance of ''Vendredi'' in 1935.  In it, he defended a political line favourable to the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] but his intransigent [[pacifism]] and his equal refusal of both [[fascist]] and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]] led him to adopt [[heterodox]] positions and to show his curiosity and sympathies in [[neosocialism|neo-socialism]].  He clashed with the left because he favoured equipping France with a large and strong army.   He stated: "''Je suis pour la force et contre la violence''" (<U+201C>I am for force and against violence<U+201D>). 

In 1937, [[<U+00C9>ditions Gallimard]] sold ''Marianne''. Emmanuel Berl resigned from the paper and founded a new weekly: ''Le Pav<U+00E9> de Paris'', which he led until the exodus from Paris in 1940.  He left for the southwest before being called on 17 June to [[Bordeaux]], where Pierre Bouthillier asked him to work on a speech for Marshal [[Philippe P<U+00E9>tain]] (then President of the Council). He also drafted the two speeches of 23 and 25 June in which were powerful phrases like "I hate the lies which hurt you so much" ("''Je hais les mensonges qui vous ont fait tant de mal''") and  "The earth, it does not lie" ("''La terre, elle, ne ment pas''"), among others. After a short spell in [[Vichy]], he turned his back on the new regime and returned to his wife Mireille in [[Cannes]] and settled, in July 1941, in [[Argentat]]. There he drafted ''Histoire de l'Europe'' (History of Europe) and was reunited with Bertrand de Jouvenal, [[Jean Effel]] and Andr<U+00E9> Malraux. 

After World War II, he left politics to concentrate on literature and editing autobiographical works, including the notable book ''Sylvia''.  In 1967, the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise]] awarded him the Grand Prix de litt<U+00E9>rature.

After his death, at Paris, [[Patrick Modiano]] and [[Bernard Morlino]] did a lot to ensure his memory.  The former published ''Interrogatoire'', and the latter published two posthumous books of his friend: ''Essais'' and ''Un spectateur engag<U+00E9>''.  Morlino also published his own works: ''Les tribulations d'un pacifiste'' and ''Berl, Morand et moi''.
