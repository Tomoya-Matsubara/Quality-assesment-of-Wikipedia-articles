'''Michael Kitome Echols''' (born October 13, 1978) is a former [[American football]] [[cornerback]] who played in both the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). He was selected in the fourth round of the [[2002 NFL Draft]] by the [[Tennessee Titans]]. He played [[college football|collegiately]] for the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]].

At Wisconsin, he was a four<U+2013>year starter at cornerback. He finished his career with a recovered [[Fumble (American football)|fumble]] and 12 [[Interception (American football)|interceptions]], returning one for a touchdown. Before his junior season in 2000, he was suspended one game for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. After the season, he was given second<U+2013>team All<U+2013>[[Big Ten Conference]] honors. In 2002, after graduating from Wisconsin, he declared for the NFL Draft. He was drafted by the Titans and debuted later that season. However, after four weeks, he injured his leg and missed the rest of the season. The following season, he saw limited action before being released by the team in 2004. After his stint with the Titans ended, he spent time with the [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Indianapolis Colts]], and [[Detroit Lions]], failing to appear in a game for any of the teams. In 2006, Echols played his final professional game for the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the CFL, intercepting a pass in his only game for the team.
