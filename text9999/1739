'''Johann Eduard Hari''' (born 21 January 1979) is a British writer and journalist who has written regular columns for ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and made contributions to several other publications. In 2011, he was suspended from ''The Independent'' following multiple charges of plagiarism and was separately accused of making malicious edits of several of his critics' [[Wikipedia]] pages under a [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|pseudonym]],<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/12/johann-hari-suspended-independent</ref> an allegation he later admitted to.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html</ref> The exposed plagiarism led to him being forced to return his 2008 [[Orwell Prize]]<ref>http://theorwellprize.co.uk/news/the-orwell-prize-and-johann-hari/</ref> and later was a contributing factor in his decision to leave ''The Independent''.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/johann-hari-leaves-the-independent-6292659.html</ref> Hari is currently believed to be writing a book on the war on drugs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hari, Johann|url=http://johannhari.com/2012/01/20/a-short-update/ |title=Update <U+2013> Johann Hari |publisher=Johannhari.com |date=20 January 2012|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Hari was born in [[Glasgow]] and raised in London from the age of one. He attended [[John Lyon School]], (an [[independent school]] affiliated to [[Harrow School]]) and then [[Woodhouse College]], a state [[sixth-form]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hari|first=Johann|title=A simple lesson on schools: Money works|url=http://www.johannhari.com/2004/03/17/a-simple-lesson-on-schools-money-works|accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref> He graduated from [[King's College, Cambridge]], in 2001 with a [[Double First|double first]] in Social and Political Sciences.<ref>http://johannhari.com/about/</ref>

==Career==
In 2000 he was joint winner of ''The Times'' Student News Journalist of the Year award for his work on the Cambridge student newspaper ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''. After university he joined the ''New Statesman'', where he worked between 2001 and 2003, and then wrote two columns a week for ''The Independent''. At the 2003 ''Press Gazette'' Awards, he won Young Journalist of the Year.<ref name="Spanner">{{cite news|last=Spanner|first=Huw|title=Let The Fiery Columns Glow|work=[[Third Way Magazine]]|pages=16<U+2013>19|date=November 2004}}</ref> A play by Hari, ''Going Down in History'', was performed at the [[Garage Theatre]] in [[Edinburgh]], and his book ''God Save the Queen?'' was published by Icon Books in 2002.<ref name="Spanner" />

In addition to being a [[columnist]] for ''[[The Independent]]'' and the [[Huffington Post]], Hari's work also appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[The Nation]], ''[[Le Monde]]'', ''[[El Pais]]'', the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] and ''[[Ha'aretz]]''. He appeared regularly as an arts critic on the [[BBC Two]] programme ''[[the Review Show]]'', and he was a book critic for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. In 2009 he was named by the ''Daily Telegraph'' as one of the most influential people on the left in Britain.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/6231925/Top-100-most-influential-Left-wingers-100-51.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Top 100 most influential Left-wingers: 100-51 | first1=Iain | last1=Dale | first2=Brian | last2=Brivati | date=27 September 2009 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref>

==Journalistic controversy==
In June 2011 Hari was accused of plagiarism in his use of unattributed quotations in interviews, where he had used previously published quotes in place of his interviewees' recorded answers. The [[Orwell Prize]], which he had won in 2008, was withdrawn following a comparison between one of the articles for which he won the award and the original ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' article on which it was based. He was shown to have made misleading edits on Wikipedia under a pseudonym. Hari apologised for his actions, although that apology was publicly criticised.<ref name=" Chivers  The Daily Telegraph" /><ref name=" Seymour_Guardian " /><ref name="DAG_newstatesman " />

===Plagiarism===
Problems with Hari's journalism were first publicized by the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' in 2003.<ref name="Thompson_The Daily Telegraph">{{cite news

A month later the spokesman for the Council of the Orwell Prize announced that it had "arrived at a clear and unanimous decision" as to whether Hari would be allowed to retain the prize he had been awarded in 2008. Public announcement was delayed after the ''Independent'' had "requested that the council consider further representations by Johann Hari before announcing the decision",<ref name=pg>Andrew Pugh (25 July 2011) [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?c=1&sectioncode=1&storycode=47579 Announcement on Hari's Orwell Prize decision delayed] [[Press Gazette]]</ref> which could not be made while the ''Independent'' inquiry was ongoing.

In July 2011, both ''[[Private Eye]]'' and [[Damian Thompson]] in his ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' blog accused Hari of inventing an atrocity for his Orwell Prize winning article on the [[Central African Republic]]. Thompson said that  this "horrified the charity so much that it complained to Simon Kelner, the editor of the Independent. Nothing happened".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100097915/johann-hari-invented-quotes-in-report-from-central-african-republic-says-charity-that-took-him-there/ | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Johann Hari 'invented quotes' in report from Central African Republic, says charity that took him there | date=20 July 2011}}</ref><ref>Damian Thompson (27 July 2011) [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100098789/johann-hari-in-africa-the-crucial-emails/ Johann Hari in Africa: the crucial emails]</ref><ref>(27 July 2011) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/07/27/johann_hari Johann Hari suddenly in much more trouble.

The Council ruled that the substantial use of unattributed and unacknowledged material did not meet the standards expected of Orwell Prize-winning journalism."

===Apology===
''The Independent'' reported in September 2011 that "Johann Hari, the writer and columnist for ''The Independent'', has admitted plagiarism allegations and will attend a journalism training course before being allowed to rejoin the newspaper" but that the results of the investigation by Whittam Smith are not to be made public.<ref name="Milmo">Cahal Milmo [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/independent-columnist-apologises-for-plagiarism-2354706.html "Independent columnist apologises for plagiarism",] ''The Independent'', 14 September 2011</ref> The editor of ''The Independent'', [[Chris Blackhurst]], said that some aspects of Hari's journalism had fallen short of the publication's ethical standards, and that Hari had "acknowledged his mistakes and made a full apology."<ref name="Milmo"/>

Hari published an apology and admission of misconduct,<ref name="Hari149">Johann Hari [http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html "A personal apology",] ''The Independent'' (website), 14 September 2011</ref> and admitted to using a pseudonym to add positive material to the Wikipedia article about himself and negative material to Wikipedia articles about people he had disputes with.<ref name="Hari149"/> Hari said he would take unpaid personal leave of absence until 2012 and seek training in journalistic ethics at his own expense. 

According to Blackhurst, speaking as a witness during the [[Leveson inquiry]] on 10 January 2012, Hari had "severely damaged" the paper, but announced that he would return to ''The Independent'' during February as a columnist.<ref>Lisa O'Carroll [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jan/10/independent-editor-johann-hari-scandal "Independent editor: Johann Hari scandal 'severely damaged' paper"], ''The Guardian'', 10 January 2012</ref> This development was soon reversed.

He wrote: "I'm not willing to see other people, who are [sic] played no part in those errors ... take the flack [sic] too".<ref>Conal Urquhart [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jan/20/johann-hari-quits-the-independent "Johann Hari quits the Independent after plagiarism storm"], ''The Guarian'', 20 January 2012</ref>

===Criticism of apology===
After Hari's apology was published, Cristina Odone, blogging for ''The Telegraph'', said that neither she nor the other victims had received any direct apology from ''The Independent'' or from Hari himself for his malicious editing of their Wikipedia articles.<ref>[[Cristina Odone]] [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/cristinaodone/100105146/johann-hari-hounded-me-for-years-all-he-gets-is-four-months-unpaid-holiday-from-the-independent-but-the-truth-will-come-out/ "Johann Hari hounded me for years: all he gets is four months' unpaid holiday from the Independent. But the truth will come out",] ''Daily Telegraph'', 15 September 2011</ref>

The published apology attracted a strongly worded critique from journalist [[Toby Young]], who also criticized ''The Independent'' for failing to sack Hari.<ref>[[Toby Young]]: [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100105124/fisking-johann-haris-apology-in-todays-independent/#dsq-content "Fisking Johann Hari's 'apology' in today's ''Independent''"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 19 September 2011.</ref> Tom Chivers, also in ''The Daily Telegraph'', called the apology "evasive",<ref name=" Chivers  The Daily Telegraph">{{cite news
