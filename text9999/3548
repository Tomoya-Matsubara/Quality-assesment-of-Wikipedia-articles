'''''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'''''{{efn|Although later printings have used the [[EYD|Perfected Spelling]] ''Bunga Roos dari Cikembang'', this article retains the original spelling.}} ({{IPA-id|bu<U+02C8><U+014B>a <U+02C8>rus da<U+02C8>ri t<U+0283>i<U+02C8>k<U+0259>mba<U+014B>|}}; translated to English as '''''The Rose of Cikembang''''') is a 1927 [[Malay trade and creole languages|vernacular Malay-language]] novel written by [[Kwee Tek Hoay]]. The seventeen-chapter book follows a plantation manager, Aij Tjeng, who must leave his beloved ''njai'' ([[concubine]]) Marsiti so that he can be married. Eighteen years later, after Aij Tjeng's daughter Lily dies, her fianc<U+00E9> Bian Koen discovers that Marsiti had a daughter with Aij Tjeng, Roosminah, who greatly resembles Lily. In the end Bian Koen and Roosminah are married.

Inspired by the lyrics to the song "If Those Lips Could Only Speak" and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was initially written as an outline for the stage drama troupe Union Dalia. Kwee intermixed several languages other than Malay, particularly Dutch, [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and English; he included two quotes from English poems and another from an English song. The novel has been interpreted variously as promotion of [[theosophy]], a treatise on the [[Buddhist]] concept of [[reincarnation]], a call for education, an ode to ''njais'', and a condemnation of how such women are treated.

The novel was initially published as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] in Kwee's magazine ''[[Panorama (Indies magazine)|Panorama]]''; it proved to be his most popular work. By 1930 there had been a number of stage adaptations, leading Kwee to ask readers to help him enforce his [[copyright]]. The work was filmed [[Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (1931 film)|in 1931]] by [[The Teng Chun]] and then in 1975 by [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]]. The book, though not considered part of the Indonesian literary canon, ranks amongst the most reprinted works of [[Chinese Malay literature]]. It has been translated into Dutch and English.

==Plot==
Oh Aij Tjeng is a young [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] man who runs a plantation in [[West Java]]. He lives there with his ''njai'' ([[concubine]]), a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] woman named Marsiti. The two are deeply in love and promise to be faithful forever. However, not long afterwards Aij Tjeng's father Oh Pin Loh comes to tell Aij Tjeng that he has been [[betrothed]] to Gwat Nio, the daughter of the plantation's owner Liok Keng Djim. Marsiti is sent away by the elder Oh and, after Aij Tjeng orders his manservant Tirta to find her, Tirta disappears as well. After the marriage, Aij Tjeng finds in Gwat Nio all of the same traits which made him fall in love with Marsiti, but even more polished owing to her better education. He falls in love with her and begins to forget Marsiti.

One day Keng Djim calls Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio to his deathbed, where he confesses that he has recently learned that Marsiti was his daughter from a [[native Indonesians|native]] ''njai'' he had taken as a youth, and that Marsiti had died. He greatly regrets that he and Pin Loh had her chased away from the plantation. Keng Djim hints that there is another secret to be shared, but dies before he can reveal it. Aij Tjeng calls for his father, to discover the secret, but finds that he too has died.

Eighteen years later, Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have a daughter named Lily, who is betrothed to a rich Chinese youth named Sim Bian Koen. Lily, although beautiful and talented, is obsessed with death and sadness; she believes that she is destined to die young. She eventually tells Bian Koen to find another fianc<U+00E9>e as she will soon leave him. She falls ill shortly thereafter, and doctors are unable to save her. In the aftermath, Bian Koen considers suicide and Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio become sick from their despair.

By the following year Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have mostly recovered, having moved far away and turned to religion. Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends to go to war in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise to wait for the anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds an extremely well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.

When he wakes up at his home, Bian Koen tells his parents that he saw Lily in Cikembang. After investigating, the Sims discover that "Lily" is in fact Aij Tjeng's daughter with Marsiti, Roosminah, who was raised in secret by Tirta. Because of her beauty, equal to that of Lily in every way, she is known as "The Rose of Cikembang". The Sims are able to contact Aij Tjeng, and after discovering Roosminah's background they have Roosminah take over Lily's identity. Her extravagant wedding with Bian Koen is attended by thousands, including Marsiti's spirit.

Five years later, Bian Koen and Roosminah live at Goenoeng Moelia with their two children. While Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio are visiting, the couple's daughter Elsy (guided by Marsiti's spirit) brings them flowers from a tree Marsiti had planted. The family take it as a sign of her love.

==Writing==
''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was written by journalist [[Kwee Tek Hoay]]. Born to an ethnic Chinese textile merchant and his native wife,{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=273}} Kwee had been raised in [[Chinese culture]] and educated at schools that focused on preparing students for life in a modern world, as opposed to promoting tradition for its own sake. By the time he wrote the novel, Kwee was an active proponent of Buddhist teachings. He also wrote extensively on themes relating to native Indonesians{{sfn|JCG, Kwee Tek Hoay}} and was a keen social observer.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2000, Chinese-Indonesian writers}} Kwee read extensively in Dutch, English, and Malay; he drew on these influences after becoming a writer.{{sfn|Sidharta|1996|pp=333<U+2013>334}} His first novel, ''Djadi Korbannja "Perempoean Hina"'' (''The Victim of a "Contemptible Woman"''), was published in 1924.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=92}}

According to his original introduction, Kwee was inspired to write the novel after hearing his daughter singing Charles Ridgewell and Will Godwin's "If Those Lips Could Only Speak" (identified by Kwee as "Mimi d'Amour"). He was struck by the melancholic lyrics and decided to write a "sad story or stage play"{{efn|Original: "''... satoe tjerita atawa lelakon komedie jang sedih.''"}}{{sfn|Kwee|2001a|pp=298<U+2013>299}} based on it. However, he did not begin the writing process until February 1927, when the Union Dalia Opera requested permission to perform his earlier work ''[[Allah jang Palsoe]]'' (''A False God''; 1919). As he considered the work too difficult for the native troupe, he began writing an original outline for their performance, based on his musings. Union Dalia performed ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' on 5 March 1927, using an outline Kwee had written; the novel was not completed until 20 April.{{sfn|Kwee|2001a|pp=298<U+2013>299}} During a conversation with fellow writer Khouw Sin Eng, Kwee said that part of the story had been based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', particularly the appearance of a dead person coming back to life.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=92}}

''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' is divided into seventeen chapters{{sfn|Kwee|1930b|p=100}} and, in its first printing, was 157 pages in length.{{sfn|Sidharta|1989b|p=307}} As such, it is considerably shorter than some of Kwee's other works.{{efn|''Drama dari Merapi'' (''Drama from Merapi'') was 620 pages long, while ''Drama di Boven Digoel'' (''Drama from Boven Digoel''), his longest, was 718 pages {{harv|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=273}}.}}{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=273}} Translator George A. Fowler writes that, unlike works published by [[Balai Pustaka]], the book did not receive a professional [[copyediting|copyedit]] before publication; this was common for works of [[Chinese Malay literature]], which "never had, nor indeed wanted, the corrective, prescriptive 'good literary taste' filter of European editors".{{sfn|Fowler|2013b|p=xxix}}

==Style==
''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was written in [[Malay trade and creole languages|vernacular Malay]], as common for works by contemporary Chinese writers in the [[Dutch East Indies]].{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=100}} Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo writes that Kwee's use of the language, one common within contemporary society, was more "modern" than most of the more formal Balai Pustaka publications (perhaps excepting [[Abdul Muis|Abdoel Moeis]]' ''[[Salah Asuhan]]'' [''Never the Twain''], published the following year): it remained focused on key events, those required to advance the story as a whole.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=101}} The book uses non-Malay words commonly: Sumardjo counts 87&nbsp;Dutch words, 60&nbsp;from [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and 14&nbsp;English ones.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=120}}

During dialogue, diction is dependent on the character's social background: Sumardjo writes that Marsiti speaks as a poor villager with little education would, and that Aij Tjeng's father and father-in-law use constructions and give advice only plausible if coming from older people. He finds only one character, the [[Columbia University]]-educated Bian Koen, as unrealistic: Sumardjo criticises Bian Koen's emotionality, considering it unfitting of an individual with the character's education and life experiences.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=183}} In other instances Kwee builds suspense by extended use of [[ellipsis|ellipses]], a form which Sumardjo suggests was inspired by contemporary ''[[silat]]'' (traditional martial arts) stories.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=105}}

As was conventional in contemporary novels such as [[Marah Roesli]]'s ''[[Sitti Nurbaya]]'' (1922), ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' integrates poetic verse into its narrative. One example, an original work in Sundanese, is sung by Marsiti after confiding her dream to Aij Tjeng.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=101}} Two others are quoted from English poems. The first is an untitled work by Irish poet [[Thomas Moore]],{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=202}} beginning with the lines "Go, let me weep".{{sfn|Kwee|1930b|p=89}} The second is the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the novel ''[[Hyperion (Longfellow novel)|Hyperion]]'' (1839) by American writer [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=202}} A final piece of verse, also in English, consists of the lyrics that inspired Kwee to write the novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Kwee|2001a|p=298}}, {{harvnb|Kwee|2001b|p=342<U+2013>343}}</ref> Malay-language translations are provided for all English and Sundanese quotations.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=202}} An example, one of three quatrains sung by Marsiti, follows:

==Themes==
In his foreword, Kwee wrote that ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was intended to lead readers to consider how fate is often at odds with the wants of those involved.{{sfn|Kwee|2001a|p=300}} Critical readings have, however, been diverse. [[Sinologist]] [[Myra Sidharta]] notes that the book is replete with mysticism common at the time,{{sfn|Sidharta|1996|pp=333<U+2013>334}} as does another sinologist, John Kwee. The latter cites four examples: a dream of Marsiti's, later shown to be prophetic, in which she is forcibly separated from Aij Tjeng despite his previous promise that they would never part, a discussion of reuniting with loved ones after death, Marsiti's spirit attending her daughter's wedding, and a scene towards the end of the novel in which Marsiti's spirit guides Roosminah's daughter to pick flowers for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio.{{sfn|Kwee|1989|pp=178<U+2013>179}} [[Nio Joe Lan]], in his history of Chinese Malay literature, notes that Kwee was the only Chinese writer of romances to also write on [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] (particularly [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese]]) philosophy. He finds mysticism to be a common theme in Kwee's works, noting it as particularly well-developed in the later novel ''Soemangetnja Boenga Tjempaka'' (''The Joy of the Cempaka Flowers'').{{sfn|Nio|1962|p=108}}

Eric Oey of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], writes that the novel's mysticism builds into a promotion of [[theosophy]] and Buddhist ideals: Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio read about both, then leave their materialistic lives to become more spiritual. Ultimately, he writes, the concept of [[reincarnation]] is put forth when Roosminah is discovered soon after Lily's death.{{sfn|Oey|1989|pp=246<U+2013>247}} Faruk of [[Gadjah Mada University]] also notes the novel's concept of reincarnation, drawing on its repeated emphasis on the parallels (both physical and psychological) between the half-sisters Marsiti and Gwat Nio, as well as Lily and Roosminah.{{sfn|Faruk|2007|pp=264<U+2013>266}}

[[File:Nyai from Sjair Njaie Dasima.jpg|thumb|Studies have emphasised the role of ''njais'' in ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang''.]]
Sidharta, considering the same interrelations between Marsiti/Gwat Nio, does not suggest reincarnation, instead writing that the novel showed that there is no difference in the love of a ''njai'' and a lawfully wedded wife.{{sfn|Sidharta|1989a|pp=75<U+2013>76}} Translator Maya Sutedja-Liem, in a similar vein, notes a "modern" message against mistreatment of ''njais''. However, she concludes that the emphasis on the mystical powers which Marsiti seems to possess causes an abandonment of [[realism (arts)|realism]], thus rendering the book "anti-modern".{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=271}}

Much commentary has focused on the novel's depiction of ''njais'', a subject common in contemporary Chinese Malay literature.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Salmon|1985|pp=98<U+2013>99}} writes that ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' remains the most popular of such contemporary works, which included such titles as ''Oelar jang Tjantik'' (''The Beautiful Snake''; 1929) by Soe Lie Piet and ''Boenga Roos Merah'' (''The Red Rose''; 1939) by Chang Mung Tze.}}{{sfn|Salmon|1985|p=98<U+2013>99}} Sumardjo describes the novel as an [[ode]] to ''njais'', citing Marsiti's loyalty to Aij Tjeng and her pureness of purpose; Marsiti is ultimately recognised for her devotion when her grave in Cikembang is moved to Batavia, with empty spaces on either side for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Sumardjo finds subtle criticism of the Dutch and Chinese men who kept ''njais'', showing the women as often becoming victims of their lovers. He suggests that this was manifested in the character of Keng Djim's unnamed ''njai'' (Marsiti's mother), who is banished after rumours spread that she has been unfaithful.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=104}} Sutedja-Liem likewise emphasises the role of the ''njai'' within the story, considering it an ode to the love and loyalty of the concubines.{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=273}}

Sidharta suggests that the novel was written as an argument that the [[illegitimate children]] of ''njais'' would be able to develop as any other person, given the proper education.{{sfn|Sidharta|1996|pp=333<U+2013>334}} Sutedja-Liem likewise finds that the need for education (including an understanding of music) is a subtext found in the novel. However, unlike Sidharta she considers this message directed not only at the children of ''njais'', but women in general.{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=271}} Only through receiving an education and following Chinese and European [[etiquette]], she writes, could a woman be considered truly "modern".{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=273}}

==Publication history==
''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was originally published in 1927, as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] in Kwee's magazine ''[[Panorama (Indies magazine)|Panorama]]'', running from March to September. The story was compiled as a book later that year and published by Hoa Siang In Kiok.{{sfn|Sidharta|1989b|p=307}} This printing, with the slogan "Roh manoesia djadi mateng dalem tangis / The soul ripens in tears" on its cover,{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=101}} sold out.{{sfn|Kwee|1930a|p=IV}} However, Kwee suggested that "writing Malay novels&nbsp;... was not enough to live on".{{efn|Original: "''... pakerdjaan mengarang tjerita Melajoe&nbsp;... tida membri hatsil jang bole dipake idoep.''"}}{{sfn|Kwee|1930a|p=II}}

The book has since proved to be one of Kwee's most popular novels, and is one of the most commonly reprinted works of Chinese Malay literature.{{sfn|Sidharta|2001|pp=xx<U+2013>xxi}} Its second printing was in 1930, by Kwee's publishing house Panorama, with a third printing by Swastika in 1963;{{sfn|Sidharta|1989b|p=307}} at the time it was the only work of Chinese Malay literature to have been republished after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945<U+2013>49).{{sfn|Kwee|1989|p=172}} Sidharta records a fourth printing in 1972, although she does not note a publisher.{{sfn|Sidharta|1996|pp=333<U+2013>334}} A new printing, adapting the [[EYD|1972 spelling reform]], was included in the second volume of ''Kesastraan Melayu Tionghoa dan Kebangsaan Indonesia'', an anthology of Chinese Malay literature.{{sfn|Kwee|2001a|p=297}}

Several translations have been made. In 2007 ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was translated to Dutch as ''De roos uit Tjikembang'' by Sutedja-Liem; this edition was published by [[Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies|KITLV Press]] as part of the anthology ''De Njai: Moeder van Alle Volken: 'De Roos uit Tjikembang' en Andere Verhalen'' (''The Njai: Mother of All Peoples: 'De Roos uit Tjikembang' and Other Stories'').{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=269}} In 2013 the [[Lontar Foundation]] published an English-language translation by Fowler under the title ''The Rose of Cikembang''.{{sfn|Kwee|Fowler|2013|loc=cover}}

==Reception==
[[File:Dardanella advertisement, Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang.jpg|thumb|alt=Newspaper advertisement|An advertisement for a performance of ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' in [[Medan]] by [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]], 1930]]
Stage performances and adaptations of ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' began before the novel was completed, beginning with the Union Dalia performance in 1927.{{sfn|Kwee|2001a|pp=298<U+2013>299}} By 1930 numerous native and ethnic-Chinese troupes had performed the story;{{sfn|Kwee|1930a|p=II}} some received direct help from Kwee.{{sfn|Kwee|1989|p=172}}  Though these stage performances were sometimes credited for the novel's success, Kwee discounted the idea, writing that the two mediums were different and, in adaptations, changes were necessary. He noted the tendency of native troupes to emphasise Marsiti's role as one such change{{sfn|Kwee|1930a|p=II}} and considered most such adaptations&nbsp;<U+2013> excepting those performed by [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]]&nbsp;<U+2013> to be of poor quality; he wrote that they generally did not pay him for the right to use the story. In the 1930 edition Kwee asked readers to inform ''Panorama'' of any illegal performances, to help him enforce his copyright.{{sfn|Kwee|1930a|p=III}} Stage performances have continued into the 2000s.<ref>See, for instance, {{harvnb|The Jakarta Post 2000, Chinese-Indonesian writers}}; {{harvnb|Ramsay 2012, Remembering}}</ref>

The novel has twice been adapted for film. The first adaptation, [[Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (1931 film)|released in 1931]], was directed by [[The Teng Chun]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Boenga Roos}} The sinologist [[Leo Suryadinata]] lists the film as the first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] sound film in the Dutch East Indies,{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=43}} although film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] suggests there was [[Karnadi Anemer Bangkong|another domestic talkie]] released in 1930.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=137}} In 1975 [[Bunga Roos dari Cikembang (1975 film)|an adaptation]] was made by [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]] under the title ''Bunga Roos dari Cikembang'', following the Perfected Spelling System. Although the main points of the story remained the same, several of the Chinese names were Indonesianised. Oh Aij Cheng, for example, was renamed Wiranta, while Gwat Nio was changed to Salmah.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Bunga Roos}}

Modern reviews of the novel have been positive. Nio describes the book as a "beautiful tragic romance"{{efn|Original: "''... tjerita tragis jang indah''"}} that "enchants the heart."{{efn|Original: "''... menawan hati.''"}}{{sfn|Nio|1962|pp=31, 77}} Indonesian scholar of Indonesian literature Jakob Sumardjo writes that, though in most of his works Kwee appeared to be strongly impressing his point of view on the reader to the point of "tearing the novels' structural balance",{{efn|Original: "''... merobek keseimbangan struktural novel.''"}} this flaw was not present in ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang''; instead, Sumardjo finds it "truly good in its form and technique, though the ideals contained within may not be that significant".{{Efn|Original: "''... benar-benar bagus dalam bentuk dan tekniknya, meskipun dari segi gagasan mungkin tidak begitu besar artinya.''"}}{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=99}} Fowler writes that the love between Aij Tjeng and Marsiti is handled with "unusual delicacy and tenderness" despite the social ostracism faced by ''njais''.{{sfn|Fowler|2013a|p=xxvi}}

As with all works written in vernacular Malay, the novel has not been considered part of the Indonesian literary canon.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=100}} In his doctoral thesis, J. Francisco B. Benitez posits a socio-political cause for this. The Dutch colonial government used [[Malay language|Court Malay]] as a "language of administration", a language for everyday dealings, while the Indonesian nationalists appropriated the language to help build a national culture. Chinese Malay literature, written in "low" Malay, was steadily marginalised.{{sfn|Benitez|2004|pp=82<U+2013>83}} Sumardjo, however, sees a question of classification: though vernacular Malay was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the time, it was not Indonesian, and as such, he asks whether works in vernacular Malay should be classified as local literature, Indonesian literature, or simply Chinese Malay literature.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1989|p=100}}
