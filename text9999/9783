"'''Cry Me a River'''" is a song recorded by American recording artist [[Justin Timberlake]] for his 2002 debut studio album ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]''. It was written by Timberlake, [[Scott Storch]] and producer [[Timbaland]], and was inspired by Timberlake's former relationship with pop singer [[Britney Spears]]. [[Jive Records]] released the single to [[Contemporary hit radio|contemporary hit]] and [[Rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic radio]] in the United States on November 24, 2002, as the album's second single. Accompanied by [[clavinet]], [[Beatboxing|beatbox]], guitars, [[synthesizer]]s, Arabian-inspired [[riffs]] and [[Gregorian chant]]s, "Cry Me a River" is a [[funk]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past.

The single received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it a stand-out track on ''Justified'' and praised Timbaland's production. It won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[2004 Grammy Awards|2004 ceremony]]. The song peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Pop Songs]] charts and charted in the top ten in other countries. It was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and silver by the [[Syndicat National de l'<U+00C9>dition Phonographique]] (SNEP).

Filmmaker [[Francis Lawrence]] directed the music video for "Cry Me a River" in [[Malibu, California]]. In the video, Timberlake's character spies on his ex-lover and shows her the love for his new partner. Spears alleged that the video was a [[publicity stunt]], but Timberlake maintained that she did not inspire the production. The clip won the awards for [[Best Male Video]] and [[Best Pop Video]] at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Timberlake performed "Cry Me a River" on his three major concert tours: [[Justified World Tour]] (2003<U+2013>04), [[Justified/Stripped Tour]] (2003) and [[FutureSex/LoveShow]] (2007). The song has been covered by various recording artists, including [[Leona Lewis]] and [[Taylor Swift]]. Spears recorded an [[answer song]] titled "[[Everytime]]" for her 2003 studio album ''[[In the Zone]]''.

==Music video==
===Development and synopsis===
The music video for "Cry Me a River" was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] in [[Malibu, California]], during the week of October 29, 2002.<ref name=mtv1/> Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, "[Me and Justin] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [general way] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it".<ref name=mtv3>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1476973/river-about-britney-justin-but-not.jhtml|title='Cry Me A River' About Britney And Justin, But Not: VMA Lens Recap|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=August 18, 2003|accessdate=September 5, 2011|publisher=MTV News. Viacom}}</ref> Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats.<ref name=mtv3/> Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with [['N Sync]] and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does."<ref name=mtv3/> The music video for "Cry Me a River" was released onto the [[iTunes Store]] on April 28, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/music-video/cry-me-a-river-edited-version/id207699128|title=Cry Me a River (Edited version)|publisher=iTunes Store (US).

[[File:JT - Cry Me a River.png|thumb|left|alt=A young man stalking a blonde woman who is wearing a green cap|Timberlake stalking the blonde woman who allegedly portrays Spears inside her house]]
The video begins with a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears<ref name=por/>), walking out of her house hand-in-hand with an unidentified man.<ref name="war">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459124/justin-britney-at-war.jhtml|title=Justin And Britney At War, Magazine Cover Story Declares|publisher=MTV News.

[[CBS Radio]]}}</ref> Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice in the back of the car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.

The video is about me."<ref name="war"/> However, Spears told ''Rolling Stone'' in October 2003 that she received a call from Timberlake saying he wanted to get back together with her and that she was in a music video with him. She states that he reassured her by saying, "Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal".<ref name="britney rolling stone"/> Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it.
