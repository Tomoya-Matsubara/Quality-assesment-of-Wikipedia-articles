== Origin and development ==

Tamil belongs to the [[Southern Dravidian languages|southern]] branch of the [[Dravidian languages]].  It is sometimes classified as being part of a [[Tamil languages|Tamil language family]], which alongside Tamil proper, also includes the languages of about 35 ethno-linguistic groups<ref>Prof. A.K. Perumal, Manorama Yearbook (Tamil) 2005 pp.302-318 </ref> such as the [[Irula language|Irula]], and [[Yerukala language|Yerukula]] languages (see [[SIL Ethnologue]]).  This group is a subgroup of the [[Tamil-Malayalam languages]], which falls under a subgroup of the [[Tamil-Kodagu languages]], which in turn is a subgroup of the [[Tamil-Kannada languages]].  The closest major relative of Tamil is Malayalam which is explained by the fact that until about the ninth century, Tamil and [[Malayalam]] were dialects of one language,<ref name="krishnamurti">{{cite book | last = Krishnamurti | first = Bhadriraju | title = The Dravidian Languages | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | series = Cambridge Language Surveys | year = 2003 | isbn = 0521771110 | pages = 140}}</ref> called "Tamil" by the speakers of both.<ref name="freeman-1998">{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Rich |year=1998 |month=February |title=Rubies and Coral: The Lapidary Crafting of Language in Kerala |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=38-65 at p.39}}</ref>  Although many of the differences between Tamil and Malayalam evidence a pre-historic split between eastern and western dialects,<ref "malayalamorigin">

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Tamil distribution.png|thumb|Distribution of Tamil speakers in South India and Sri Lanka (1961).]]
Tamil is the first language of the majority in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] and [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|North Eastern Province]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The language is spoken by small groups of minorities in other parts of these two countries such as [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], and [[Maharashtra]] in case of India and [[Colombo]] and the hill country in case of Sri Lanka.

There are currently sizeable [[Tamil diaspora|Tamil-speaking populations]] descended from colonial-era migrants in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Asians in South Africa|South Africa]], and [[Mauritius]]. Many people in [[Guyana]], [[Fiji]], [[Suriname]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] have Tamil origins,<ref>World Language. [http://www.worldlanguage.com/Languages/Tamil.htm Tamil Language]. Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> but only a small number speak the language there. Groups of more recent migrants [[Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora|from Sri Lanka]] and India exist in [[Canada]] (especially [[Toronto]]), [[United States|USA]], [[Australia]], many [[Middle East]]ern countries, and most of the western [[Europe]]an countries.

The dialects spoken in [[Sri Lanka]] retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in [[India]],<ref>Thomas Lehmann, "Old Tamil" in Sanford Steever (ed.), ''The Dravidian Languages'' Routledge, 1998 at p. 75; E.

===Spoken and literary variants===
[[Image:Tamil.gif|280px|right|The Tamil alphabet]]
In addition to its various dialects, Tamil exhibits different forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language (''{{IAST|ca<U+1E45>kattami<U+1E3B>}}''), a modern literary and formal style (''{{IAST|centami<U+1E3B>}}''), and a modern [[colloquial]] form (''{{IAST|ko<U+1E6D>untami<U+1E3B>}}''). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum. For example, it is possible to write ''{{IAST|centami<U+1E3B>}}'' with a vocabulary drawn from ''{{IAST|ca<U+1E45>kattami<U+1E3B>}}'', or to use forms associated with one of the other variants while speaking ''{{IAST|ko<U+1E6D>untami<U+1E3B>}}''.<ref>Harold Schiffman, "[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/diglossia/handbuk.html Diglossia as a Sociolinguistic Situation]", in Florian Coulmas (ed.), ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. London: Basil Blackwell, Ltd., 1997 at pp. 205 et seq.</ref>

In modern times, ''{{IAST|centami<U+1E3B>}}'' is generally used in formal writing and speech. For instance, it is the language of textbooks, of much of [[Tamil literature]] and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, ''{{IAST|ko<U+1E6D>untami<U+1E3B>}}'' has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of ''{{IAST|centami<U+1E3B>}}''. Most contemporary [[film|cinema]], [[theatre]] and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in ''{{IAST|ko<U+1E6D>untami<U+1E3B>}}'', and many [[politician]]s use it to bring themselves closer to their audience.  The increasing use of ''{{IAST|ko<U+1E6D>untami<U+1E3B>}}'' in modern times has led to the emergence of unofficial <U+2018>standard<U+2019> spoken dialects. In [[India]], the <U+2018>standard<U+2019> ''{{IAST|ko<U+1E6D>untami<U+1E3B>}}'' is based on <U+2018>educated non-brahmin speech<U+2019>, rather than on any one dialect,<ref>Harold Schiffman, "Standardization or restandardization: The case for <U+2018>Standard<U+2019> Spoken Tamil". ''Language in Society'' 27 (1998), pp. 359<U+2013>385.</ref> but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of [[Thanjavur]] and [[Madurai]]. In [[Sri Lanka]] the standard is based on the dialect of [[Jaffna]].

== Writing system ==
{{main|Tamil script}}
[[Image:History of Tamil script.jpg|thumb|right|History of Tamil script.]]
Tamil is written using a script called the ''{{IAST|va<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>e<U+1E3B>uttu}}'', an [[abugida]] belonging to the [[Brahmic family]].  The Tamil script consists of 12 [[vowel]]s, 18 [[consonant]]s and one special character, the ''<U+0101>ytam''.  The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters.  As with other [[Indic scripts]], all consonants have an inherent vowel ''a'', which in Tamil, is removed by adding an overdot called a ''{{IAST|pu<U+1E37><U+1E37>i}}'', to the consonantal sign.  Unlike most Indic scripts, the Tamil script does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced [[plosive]]s.  Instead, plosives are articulated with voice or unvoiced depending on their position in a word, in accordance with the rules of [[Tamil phonology]], as discussed below.

The Tamil script evolved from [[Tamil-Brahmi]] or Tamili, which differed from Asokan Brahmi in a number of ways.  By the 9th century, Tamil-Brahmi had evolved into more rounded characters, called ''[[vatteluttu]]'' (meaning ''curved letters''), from which the modern script evolved.  In the 18th century, some changes were made to the script by the Italian missionary Constanzo Beschi, known in Tamil as [[Veeramamunivar]], to make it easier to print.  These included placing vowel markers in both the left and right of the consonants. Around 1935, [[E.V.Ramaswamy Periyar]] suggested some further changes to make it amenable to [[printing]].<ref name=periyar>{{cite web

The traditional system of writing loan-words, which involved respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology remains.<ref>As recommended in the traditional grammar, the Tolk<U+0101>ppiyam.

==Sounds==
{{main|Tamil phonology}}

Tamil phonology is characterised by the presence of [[retroflex consonant]]s, and strict rules for the distribution within words of voiced and unvoiced [[plosive]]s. Tamil phonology permits few consonant clusters, which can never be word initial. Native grammarians classify Tamil phonemes into vowels, consonants, and a "secondary character", the <U+0101>ytam.

===Vowels===
Tamil vowels are called ''{{IAST|uyire<U+1E3B>uttu}}'' (''uyir'' <U+2013> life, ''{{IAST|e<U+1E3B>uttu}}'' <U+2013> letter). The vowels are classified into short (''{{IAST|ku<U+1E5F>il}}'') and long (five of each type) and two [[diphthong]]s, /ai/ and /au/, and three "shortened" (''{{IAST|ku<U+1E5F><U+1E5F>iyal}}'') vowels.

The long (''{{IAST|ne<U+1E6D>il}}'') vowels are about twice as long as the short vowels. The [[diphthong]]s are usually pronounced about 1.5 times as long as the short vowels, though most grammatical texts place them with the long vowels.

|}

===Consonants===
Tamil [[consonants]] are known as ''{{IAST|meyye<U+1E3B>uttu}}'' (''mey''<U+2014>body, ''{{IAST|e<U+1E3B>uttu}}''<U+2014>letters). The [[consonant]]s are classified into three categories with six in each category: ''{{IAST|valli<U+1E49>am}}''<U+2014>hard, ''{{IAST|melli<U+1E49>am}}''<U+2014>soft or [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]], and ''{{IAST|i<U+1E6D>ayi<U+1E49>am}}''<U+2014>medium. 

Unlike most Indian languages, Tamil does not have [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants. In addition, the voicing of [[plosive]]s is governed by strict rules in ''{{IAST|centami<U+1E3B>}}''. Plosives are unvoiced if they occur word-initially or doubled. Elsewhere they are voiced, with a few becoming [[fricative]]s [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]]ally. [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]s and [[Approximant consonant|approximant]]s are always voiced.<ref>''See e.g.'' the pronunciation guidelines in G.U. Pope (1868). ''A Tamil hand-book, or, Full introduction to the common dialect of that language''. (3rd ed.). Madras, Higginbotham & Co.</ref>

The sounds {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/<U+0282>/}} are peripheral to the phonology of Tamil, being found only in loanwords and frequently replaced by native sounds. There are well-defined rules for elision in Tamil categorised into different classes based on the phoneme which undergoes elision.

===Aytam===
Classical Tamil also had a phoneme called the ''[[<U+0100>ytham|<U+0101>ytam]]'', written as <U+2018><U+0B83><U+2019>. Tamil grammarians of the time classified it as a special character (''{{IAST|c<U+0101>rpe<U+1E3B>uttu}}''), but it is very rare in modern Tamil. The rules of pronunciation given in the Tolk<U+0101>ppiyam, a text on the grammar of Classical Tamil, suggest that the ''<U+0101>ytam'' could have [[Glottal stop|glottalised]] the sounds it was combined with. It has also been suggested that the ''<U+0101>ytam'' was used to represent the [[Implosive consonant|voiced implosive]] (or closing part or the first half) of geminated voiced plosives inside a word.<ref>''See generally'' F. B. J. Kuiper, "Two problems of old Tamil phonology", ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 2:3 (September 1958) pp. 191-224, esp. pp. 191-207.</ref>

==Grammar==
{{main|Tamil grammar}}

Much of Tamil [[grammar]] is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the ''[[Tolk<U+0101>ppiyam]]''.  Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar ''{{IAST|Na<U+1E49><U+1E49><U+016B>l}}''  which restated and clarified the rules of the ''Tolk<U+0101>ppiyam'', with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely ''{{IAST|e<U+1E3B>uttu}}'', ''col'', ''{{IAST|poru<U+1E37>}}'', ''y<U+0101>ppu'', ''{{IAST|a<U+1E47>i}}''. Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.<ref name=five_parts_grammar>{{cite web
  | url = http://www.southasia.upenn.edu/tamil/lit.html
  | title = "Five fold grammar of Tamil"
  | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}
</ref>

Similar to other Dravidian languages, Tamil is an [[agglutinative language]].<ref name="agglutinative_lang">{{cite web
 | url = http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15434311laq0302_5?cookieSet=1&journalCode=laq
 | title = "Tamil is an agglutinative language"
 | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref> Even though Tamil is characterised by its use of [[retroflex consonants]] similar to the other [[Dravidian languages]], it also uses a unique liquid l (<U+0BB4><U+0BCD>).<ref name="retroflex_consonants">{{cite web
 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=2Qwf3pAxJpUC&pg=PA40&ots=kqeR3TbYVk&dq=Tamil+retroflex+consonants&sig=xUZeNAJUhQOR6UMroReeMr0Kwtg#PPA40,M1
 | title = "A Reference Grammar of Classical Tamil Poetry: 150 B.C.-Pre-Fifth/Sixth Century A.D. By V. S. Rajam"
 | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref> Tamil words consist of a [[lexeme|lexical root]] to which one or more [[affix]]es are attached. Most Tamil affixes are [[suffix]]es. Tamil suffixes can be ''[[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] suffixes'', which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or ''[[inflection]]al suffixes'', which mark categories such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of [[agglutination]], which can lead to long words with a large number of suffixes.

===Morphology===

Tamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes (''{{IAST|ti<U+1E47>ai}}'')<U+2014>the "[[rational]]" (''{{IAST|uyarti<U+1E47>ai}}''), and the "[[irrational]]" (''{{IAST|a<U+1E35><U+1E5F>i<U+1E47>ai}}'')<U+2014>which include a total of five classes (''p<U+0101>l'', which literally means <U+2018>gender<U+2019>). [[Human]]s and [[deity|deities]] are classified as "rational", and all other nouns ([[animal]]s, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The "[[rational]]" nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes (''p<U+0101>l'')<U+2014>masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The "[[irrational]]" nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes - irrational singular and irrational plural. The ''p<U+0101>l'' is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an [[honorific]], gender-neutral, singular form.<ref name="classes_of_nouns">{{cite web
  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=TPgAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA47&dq=rational+nouns+in+tamil
  | title = "Classes of nouns in Tamil"
  | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref>

Suffixes are used to perform the functions of [[case]]s or [[postposition]]s. Traditional grammarians tried to group the various suffixes into eight cases corresponding to the cases used in [[Sanskrit]]. These were the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[sociative case|sociative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], and [[ablative case|ablative]]. Modern grammarians argue that this classification is artificial, and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case.<ref>Harold Schiffman, "Standardization and Restandardization: the case of Spoken Tamil." ''Language in Society'' 27:3 (1998) pp. 359-385 and esp. pp.374-375.</ref> Tamil nouns can take one of four [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es, ''i'', ''a'', ''u'' and ''e'' which are functionally equivalent to the demonstratives in [[English language|English]].

Tamil [[verb]]s are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of [[suffix]]es, which show person, number, mood, tense and voice.
*Person and number are indicated by [[suffix]]ing the [[oblique case]] of the relevant [[pronoun]] (''<U+0113>n'' in the above example). The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from [[grammatical particle]]s, which are added to the stem.
*Tamil has two voices. The first indicates that the subject of the sentence ''undergoes'' or ''is the object of'' the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence ''directs'' the action referred to by the verb stem.
*Tamil has three simple tenses<U+2014>past, present, and future<U+2014>indicated by the suffixes, as well as a series of perfects indicated by compound suffixes. Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same [[morpheme]]s which mark tense categories.

Traditional grammars of Tamil do not distinguish between [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s, including both of them under the category ''uriccol'', although modern grammaraians tend to distinguish between them on morphological and syntactical grounds.<ref name="lehmann1989">{{cite book |last = Lehmann |first = Thomas |title = A Grammar of Modern Tamil |year= 1989 |publisher= Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics and Culture |location= Pondicherry}} at pp. 9-11 </ref>

Tamil has no [[article (grammar)|article]]s. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number "one" as an indefinite article, or by the context.<ref name="steeversummary">{{Citation | first = E. | last = Annamalai | first2= S.B. | last2 = Steever | editor-last = Steever | editor-first = Sanford B. | contribution = Modern Tamil | title = The Dravidian Languages | year = 1998 | pages = pp. 100-128 | place = London | publisher = Routledge | id =  ISBN 0415100232}} at p. 109.</ref>

In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between [[inclusive we|inclusive]] pronouns <U+0BA8><U+0BBE><U+0BAE><U+0BCD> ''n<U+0101>m'' (we), <U+0BA8><U+0BAE><U+0BA4><U+0BC1> ''namatu'' (our) that include the addressee and [[exclusive we|exclusive]] pronouns <U+0BA8><U+0BBE><U+0B99><U+0BCD><U+0B95><U+0BB3><U+0BCD> ''{{IAST|n<U+0101><U+1E45>ka<U+1E37>}}'' (we), <U+0B8E><U+0BAE><U+0BA4><U+0BC1> ''ematu'' (our) that do not. The bifurcation of the First Person Plural pronoun (we in English) into inclusive and exclusive versions can be found in [[Inclusive and exclusive we|other languages]] too.<ref name="steeversummary"/>

===Syntax===

Tamil is a consistently [[Branching (linguistics)|head-final]] language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with typical word order [[Subject Object Verb]] (SOV).<ref name="SOV_language">{{cite web
  | url = http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/schuh/lx001/Discussion/d02.html
  | title = "Tamil is a head-final language"
  | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref> However, Tamil also exhibits extensive ''scrambling'' (word order variation), so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] effects. Tamil has [[postposition]]s rather than [[prepositions]]. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.

Tamil is a [[null subject language]]. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs and objects. It is possible to construct valid sentences that have only a verb<U+2014>such as ''{{IAST|mu<U+1E6D>intuvi<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>atu}}'' ("completed")<U+2014>or only a subject and object, without a verb such as ''{{IAST|atu e<U+1E49> v<U+012B><U+1E6D>u}}'' ("That, my house"). Tamil does not have a [[copula]] (a linking verb equivalent to the word ''is''). The word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning more easily.

==Vocabulary==
{{seealso|Wiktionary:Category:Tamil language|Wiktionary:Category:Tamil derivations}}
A strong sense of [[linguistic purism]] is found in Modern Tamil.<ref>Sumathi Ramaswamy, En/Gendering Language: The Poetics of Tamil Identity" ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 35:4. (Oct. 1993), pp. 683-725.</ref> Much of the modern vocabulary derives from classical Tamil,<ref>For example Cre-A<U+2019>s Modern Tamil Dictionary contains 15,875 words, of which only a small percentage of words, some with Grantha letters are loan words.</ref> as well as governmental and non-governmental institutions, such as the [[Government of Sri Lanka]], the [[Tamil Virtual University]], and [[Annamalai University]]. 

These institutions have generated technical dictionaries for Tamil containing [[neologisms]] and words derived from Tamil roots to replace loan words from English and other languages. Since  mediaeval times, there has been a strong resistance to the use of Sanskrit words in Tamil.<ref>Sumathi Ramaswamy, "Language of the People in the World of Gods: Ideologies of Tamil before the Nation" ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', 57:1. (Feb. 1998), pp. 66-92.</ref> As a result, the Prakrit and Sanskrit loan words used in modern Tamil are, unlike in some other Dravidian languages, restricted mainly to some spiritual terminology and [[abstract noun]]s.<ref>Dr.T.P. Meenakshisundaram, A History of Tamil Language, Sarvodaya Ilakkiya Pannai, 1982 (translated) p. 241-2</ref> Besides Sanskrit, there are a few loan words from Persian and Arabic implying there were trade ties in ancient times.<ref name="Veliath001">[[Silapadhigaaram]], [[Manimekalai]], P.T.Srinivasa Iyengar<U+2019>s "History of the Tamils: from the earliest times to 600 AD", Madras, 1929</ref> Many [[List of loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil|loan words from Portuguese and Dutch]] and English were introduced into colloquial and written Tamil during the colonial period.
