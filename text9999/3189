The '''green lanternshark''' (''Etmopterus virens'') is a [[species]] of [[Squaliformes|dogfish shark]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Etmopteridae]], found in the western central [[Atlantic Ocean]]. This species usually occurs on the upper [[continental slope]] below a depth of {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Reaching {{convert|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the green lanternshark has a slender body with a long, thin tail and low, conical [[dermal denticle]]s on its flanks. It is dark brown or gray with ventral black coloration, which contain light-emitting [[photophore]]s that may serve a [[crypsis|cryptic]] and/or social function. Green lanternsharks are thought to be gregarious and may attack their prey, [[squid]] and [[octopus]] often larger than themselves, in packs. Reproduction is [[aplacental viviparous]], with females giving birth to litters of 1&ndash;3 young. This relatively common shark is an occasional, valueless [[bycatch]] of [[commercial fisheries]]; currently it does not appear to be significantly threatened by human activities.

==Taxonomy==
The green lanternshark was scientifically described in 1953 by [[Henry B. Bigelow]], William C. Schroeder, and [[Stewart Springer]], in the ''Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University''. The [[type specimen]] was a {{convert|20.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} long male caught at a depth of {{convert|403|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The [[specific epithet]] ''virens'' is [[Latin]] for "green".<ref name="compagno">{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |date=1984 |title=Sharks of the World: An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Shark Species Known to Date |place=Rome |publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization |isbn=9251013845 |page=88}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bigelow, H.B., W.C.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the green lanternshark is restricted to the upper [[continental slope]]s of the western central Atlantic. In the Gulf of Mexico, it occurs from [[Texas]] to [[Florida]] and [[Cuba]], and off the [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. In the Caribbean Sea, it is found off [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]], and from [[Panama]] to [[Venezuela]] and perhaps as far as [[Brazil]].<ref name="iucn"/> This largely [[benthic|bottom-dwelling]] species has been caught at a depth of {{convert|196|-|915|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with most individuals being found deeper than {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="mceachran and fechhelm">{{cite book |title=Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico: Myxiniformes to Gasterosteiformes |author=McEachran, J.D. and J.D.

==Description==
[[Image:Green lanternshark nmfs3.jpg|thumb|left|The black ventral markings of the green lanternshark contain light-emitting photophores.]]
A slim-bodied shark with a short, blunt snout and a long, narrow tail, the green lanternshark attains a maximum known length of {{convert|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="compagno et al"/> The eyes are very large and oval in shape. The nostrils are preceded by short skin flaps. There are 29&ndash;34 tooth rows in the upper jaw, each tooth with a narrow central cusp flanked by fewer than three pairs of lateral cusplets. The lower jaw contains 24&ndash;32 tooth rows, their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface and each tooth bearing a horizontal narrow cusp.<ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/> The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are very short, comparable to the [[spiracle]] in size.<ref name="compagno"/>

The first [[dorsal fin]] bears a spine in front and originates over the trailing margin of the broad and rounded [[pectoral fin]]s. The second dorsal fin also bears a spine in front and is over twice as large as the first in area, with the span between it and the first dorsal fin approximate equal to the distance between the snout tip and first gill slit. There is no [[anal fin]]. The [[caudal fin]] is low and narrow, with an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe about as long as the head. The [[dermal denticle]]s on the sides of the body are stout and thorn-shaped, widely spaced without any regular pattern; the snout is mostly covered by denticles.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/> The dorsal coloration is dark brown to gray; the underside of the body and snout are black, with a broad black marking above and behind each [[pelvic fin]], and thin black marks on the tail.<ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/> These black markings contain numerous [[bioluminescence|light-emitting]] [[photophore]]s.<ref name="compagno et al"/>

==Biology and ecology==
[[Image:Green lanternshark nmfs5.jpg|thumb|A green lanternshark pup alongside an adult.]]
The ventrally positioned photophores of the green lanternshark may serve to disguise its silhouette from potential [[predator]]s via [[countershading|counter-illumination]]. Like many other bioluminescent deep-sea sharks, it has a yellow spot over its [[pineal gland]] that acts as a "window" for the detection of ambient light levels.<ref name="ellis"/> This shark is caught sporadically but in large numbers at a time, suggesting that they may travel in [[shoaling and schooling|schools]].<ref name="compagno"/> If so, their photophores may also allow individual sharks in a group to keep sight of and coordinate with its cohorts.<ref name="ellis"/>

Green lanternsharks feed mainly on [[squid]] and [[octopus]],<ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/> and are frequently found with [[cephalopod]] eyes and beaks in their [[stomach]]s so large that the sharks would have had to distend their jaws considerably to swallow them.<ref name="ellis"/> It is uncertain how these diminutive sharks manage to overwhelm prey often much larger than themselves; Stewart Springer has proposed that they may [[group hunting|attack in packs]], "swarming" over a single large squid or octopus with each shark sawing off pieces of flesh.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="ellis">{{cite book |author=Ellis, R. |title=Deep Atlantic: Life, Death, and Exploration in the Abyss |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |date=1996 |isbn=1558216634 |pages=195&ndash;197}}</ref> As with other members of its family, this species is [[aplacental viviparous]] with females giving birth to litters of 1&ndash;3 young.<ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/> The newborn pups measure {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long;<ref name="compagno et al"/> males attain [[sexual maturity]] at a length of {{convert|18.3|-|23.6|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and females at a length of {{convert|22.0|-|25.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="iucn"/>

==Human interactions==
Relatively common, the green lanternshark is caught infrequently as [[bycatch]] in deepwater fisheries but has no commercial value because of its small size. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has assessed it as of [[Least Concern]], as at present it appears to face no substantial threats. However, like many other deep-sea sharks there is a paucity of information on this species, and vigilance is warranted regarding expanding fisheries within its range.<ref name="iucn"/>
