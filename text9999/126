The '''History of Bolton Wanderers F.C.''' covers the period from its founding in 1874 up to the present.

==Early history (1877<U+2013>1929)==
[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.]] was founded by the Reverend Thomas Ogden, the schoolmaster at Christ Church in 1874 as Christ Church F.C.<ref>{{cite news|title=Whites to honour the first Wanderer |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/1594445.print/|work=Bolton News |date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref> It was initially run from the church of the same name on Deane Road, Bolton, on the site where the Innovation factory of the [[University of Bolton]] now stands. The club left the location following a dispute with the vicar, and changed its name to Bolton Wanderers in 1877. The name was chosen as the club initially had a lot of difficulty finding a permanent ground to play on, having used three venues in its first four years of existence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Dan|title=The Rough Guide to English Football: A fans' handbook 1999<U+2013>2000|year=1999|publisher=[[Rough Guides|Rough Guides Ltd]]|page=60|isbn=1-85828-455-4}}</ref>

In the [[1887<U+2013>88 FA Cup]], Bolton Wanderers were involved in a protracted first round match against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Welsh international [[Robert Roberts (footballer born 1864)|Bob Roberts]] scored the only goal of the initial match played on 15 October 1887, but the result was declared invalid as Bolton Wanderers had fielded an ineligible player, Robert Struthers.<ref name = "Collett">{{cite book | title= The Complete Record of the FA Cup|last= Collett|first= Mike |year= 2003|publisher=Sports Books |isbn=1-899807-19-5|pages=279<U+2013>280}}</ref> There then followed two drawn matches (with Roberts again scoring in the first), before Everton won the second replay (the fourth match altogether) 2<U+2013>1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/stats/?mode=season&era_id=1|title=Everton Season Statistics 1887<U+2013>1888|publisher=Everton Stats|accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref> This time, however, Everton were disqualified for fielding two professional players who had been registered as amateurs,<ref>{{cite book | title= Association Football in Victorian England <U+2013> A History of the Game from 1863 to 1900|last= Gibbons|first= Philip |year= 2001|publisher=Upfront Publishing|isbn=1-84426-035-6|page=97}}</ref> and the match was awarded to Bolton, who then suffered a club record 9<U+2013>1 defeat in the second round away to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref name = "Collett"/>

Bolton were one of the 12 founder members of the [[Football League]], which formed in 1888.<ref>{{cite web | title=In the Beginning <U+2013> 1800s |work=Bolton Wanderers official website | url=http://www.bwfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,1004~534169,00.html | accessdate=24 June 2007 }}</ref> Having remained in the Football League since its formation, Bolton have spent more time in the top flight ([[Premier League]]/old [[Football League First Division|First Division]]) than out of it.

The period before and after the [[First World War]] was Bolton's most consistent period of top-flight success as measured by league finishes, with the club finishing outside the top 8 of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] on only two occasions between [[1911<U+2013>12 in English football|1911<U+2013>12]] and [[1927<U+2013>28 in English football|1927<U+2013>28]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boltonwanderers-mad.co.uk/league_history/bolton_wanderers/index.shtml |title=League History Bolton Wanderers <U+2013> Bolton Wanderers FC |publisher=Bolton Wanderers Mad |date= |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> In this period Bolton equalled their record finish of third twice, in [[1920<U+2013>21 in English football|1920<U+2013>21]] and [[1924<U+2013>25 in English football|1924<U+2013>25]], on the latter occasion missing out on the title by just 3 points (in an era of 2 points for a win).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1924-25.html |title=England 1924/25 |publisher=Rsssf.com |date=20 September 2000 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>

On 28 April 1923, Bolton won the cup at their third attempt to win their first major trophy, beating [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 2<U+2013>0 in the first ever [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] final. The match, famously known as [[1923 FA Cup Final|The White Horse Final]] was played in front of over 127,000 supporters. Bolton's centre-forward, [[David Jack]] scored the first ever goal at Wembley Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|title=The F.A.

==Top flight run and cup success (1929<U+2013>1958)==
From 1935 to 1964, Bolton enjoyed an uninterrupted stay in the top flight <U+2013> regarded by fans as a golden era <U+2013> spearheaded in the 1950s by [[Nat Lofthouse]]. The years of the [[Second World War]] saw most of the Wanderers' playing staff see action on the front, a rare occurrence within elite football, as top sportsmen were generally assigned to physical training assignments, away from enemy fire. As it is, no less than 15 Bolton professionals, led by their captain [[Harry Goslin]], volunteered for active service in 1939, and were enlisted in the 53rd Bolton Artillery regiment.<ref name="wartime">{{cite book |last1=Purcell|first1=Tim|last2=Gething|first2=Mike|title=Wartime Wanderers: Bolton Wanderers <U+2013> A football team at war|date=22 November 2001|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=1-84018-583-X}}</ref> By the end of the war, 32 of the 35 pre-war professionals saw action in the British forces. The sole fatality was Goslin, who had by then risen to the rank of Lieutenant and was killed by shrapnel on the Italian front shortly before Christmas 1943. 53rd Bolton Artillery took part in the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] and also served in the campaigns of Egypt, Iraq and Italy.<ref name="wartime" /> Remarkably, a number of these soldiers managed to carry on playing the game in these theatres of war, taking on as 'British XI' various scratch teams assembled by, among others, [[Farouk of Egypt|King Faruk of Egypt]] in Cairo and Polish forces in Baghdad.<ref name="wartime" />

On 9 March 1946, the club's home was the scene of the [[Burnden Park disaster]], which at the time was the worst tragedy in British [[Association football|football]] history. 33 Bolton Wanderers fans were crushed to death, and another 400 injured, in an [[FA Cup]] quarter-final second leg tie between Bolton and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC News <U+2013> Burnden Park football disaster remembered 65 years on|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-12686632|publisher=BBC News|date=9 March 2011|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> There was an estimated 85,000 strong crowd crammed in for the game, at least 15,000 over-capacity. The disaster led to [[Ronw Moelwyn Hughes|Moelwyn Hughes]]'s official report, which recommended more rigorous control of crowd sizes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Norman|year=1998|title=Have They Forgotten Bolton?|journal=The Sports Historian|volume=18|issue=1|pages=pp 120<U+2013>151|publisher=The British Society of Sports History|doi=10.1080/17460269809444773|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/1998/sh181i.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>

In 1953 Bolton played in one of the most famous FA Cup finals of all time <U+2013> [[1953 FA Cup Final|The Stanley Matthews Final]] of 1953. Bolton lost the game to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] 4<U+2013>3 after gaining a 3<U+2013>1 lead. Blackpool were victorious thanks to the skills of [[Stanley Matthews|Matthews]] and the goals of [[Stan Mortensen]].<ref>{{cite news|title=1953 <U+2013> The Matthews Final|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1321960.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 May 2001|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>

Bolton Wanderers have not won a major trophy since 1958, when two Lofthouse goals saw them overcome [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1958 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] in front of a 100,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|title=1958 <U+2013> Man Utd's Brave Dream|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1321966.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 May 2001|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> The closest they have come to winning a major trophy since then is finishing runners-up in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], first in 1995 and again in 2004.

==Few highs and many lows (1958<U+2013>1995)==
Hopes were high at Burnden Park in May 1978 when Bolton sealed the Second Division title and gained promotion to the First Division. However, they only remained there for two seasons before being relegated.<ref name="completerecord">{{cite book|last=Marland|first=Simon|title=Bolton Wanderers: The Complete Record|year=2011|publisher=DB Publishing|isbn=1-85983-972-X}}</ref>

Following relegation in 1980, Bolton signed former Manchester United [[European Cup]] winning striker [[Brian Kidd]] from Everton for <U+00A3>110,000<ref>{{cite web|title=England Players <U+2013> Brian Kidd|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersK/BioKiddB.html|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> as they prepared to challenge for a quick return to the First Division. Kidd scored a hat-trick in his third game for Bolton, a 4<U+2013>0 win over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the league, but the rest of the season was a struggle as Bolton failed to finish anywhere near the promotion places. Manager [[Stan Anderson]] was sacked at [[1980<U+2013>81 in English football|end of the season]] and replaced by coach [[George Mulhall]].<ref name="completerecord" /> By the end of the [[1981<U+2013>82 in English football|1981<U+2013>82 season]], Bolton were no closer to promotion and had lost several key players including [[Peter Reid]] and [[Neil Whatmore]]. There were then rumours that Brazilian legend [[Pel<U+00E9>]] would be appointed to take over from George Mulhall as manager, but the job went to [[John McGovern (footballer)|John McGovern]] (a European Cup winner with Nottingham Forest) who became Bolton's first player-manager.<ref name="completerecord" />

However, the appointment of McGovern as manager was not the turning point that everyone at Burnden Park had hoped it would be, and in 1983 Bolton were relegated to the Third Division after losing 4<U+2013>1 at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on the final day of the season.<ref name=1980-1999>{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,1004~535741,00.html |title=Bolton Wanderers &#124; 1980<U+2013>1999 |publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C. |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>

McGovern remained in charge for the [[1983<U+2013>84 in English football|1983<U+2013>84 season]], and for a while it looked as though he was the man to turn things around as his predominantly young team did well in the Third Division. An 8<U+2013>1 win over [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] that season was Bolton's best league win for 50 years, but in the end Bolton failed to win promotion. McGovern then made way for new manager [[Charlie Wright]], who remained in charge until December 1985.<ref name=1980-1999 />

At the end of the [[1986<U+2013>87 in English football|1986<U+2013>87 season]], Bolton Wanderers suffered relegation to the Fourth Division for the first time in their history. But the board kept faith in manager [[Phil Neal]] (who was appointed in December 1985) and they won promotion back to the Third Division at the first attempt. The deciding goal was scored by [[Robbie Savage (footballer born 1960)|Robbie Savage]] in a thrilling 1<U+2013>0 win at Wrexham. Wrexham missed a penalty in the opening 30 minutes and both teams squandered a succession of chances. Bolton's Robbie Savage hit the post from a free kick before the referee blew the final whistle. It was during Neal's reign at manager that Nat Lofthouse was appointed lifetime President of the football club. Neal won the [[Football League Trophy|Sherpa Van Trophy]] in 1989 and remained in charge until the summer of 1992 when he made way for [[Bruce Rioch]], who a few years earlier had won two successive promotions with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. His penultimate season ([[1990<U+2013>91 in English football|1990<U+2013>91]]) saw Bolton pipped to the final automatic promotion place by [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and lose to [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in the playoff final, but his final season saw them finish a disappointing 13th.<ref name=1980-1999 />

In the early part of Rioch's tenure, Bolton gained a giantkilling reputation in cup competitions. In 1993 Bolton beat FA Cup holders [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 2<U+2013>0 in a third round replay at [[Anfield]], thanks to goals from [[John McGinlay]] and [[Andy Walker (footballer born 1965)|Andy Walker]]. The club also defeated higher division opposition in the form of Wolves (2<U+2013>1) that year before bowing out to Derby County (3<U+2013>1). Bolton also secured promotion to the second tier for the first time since 1983. In 1994 Bolton beat FA Cup holders [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3<U+2013>1 after extra time in a fourth round replay, and went on to reach the quarter-finals, bowing out 1<U+2013>0 at home to local rivals (and then Premier League) [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]. Bolton also defeated top division opposition in the form of Everton (3<U+2013>2) and Aston Villa (1<U+2013>0) that year.

==Colin Todd era (1995<U+2013>1999)==
Bolton reached the Premiership in 1995 under the management of Rioch, thanks to a victory over Reading in the Division One playoff final. Rioch, who also led Bolton to the League Cup Final in 1995, a 2<U+2013>1 defeat by Liverpool, left to take charge at Arsenal after the promotion success and was replaced by [[Roy McFarland]], who was joined by Rioch's assistant [[Colin Todd]] as joint manager. Bolton were bottom for virtually all of the [[1995<U+2013>96 in English football|1995<U+2013>96]] Premiership campaign and Bolton dismissed McFarland on New Year's Day 1996 and appointed Todd in his place. Todd was unable to save Bolton from relegation as they lost their penultimate game 1<U+2013>0 to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but the Bolton board kept faith in him. The Bolton board's loyalty in Todd was rewarded when they won promotion back to the Premiership at the first attempt thanks to a season in which they achieved 98 league points and 100 goals in the process of securing the Division One championship, the first time since 1978 that they had finished top of any division. This season also marked the club's departure from Burnden Park to the Reebok Stadium, the last game at the stadium being a 4<U+2013>1 win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].John Mcginley scored the final goal at burnden park.

Bolton were relegated on goal difference at the end of the [[1997<U+2013>98 in English football|1997<U+2013>98]] Premiership campaign. Bolton reached the 1999 Division One playoff final but lost 2<U+2013>0 to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. Todd resigned as manager the following autumn and was replaced by [[Sam Allardyce]].

==Sam Allardyce era (1999<U+2013>2007)==
Bolton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, Worthington Cup and play-offs but lost to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]],<ref>{{cite web|title=April 2nd 2000 <U+2013> FA Cup semi-final Wembley Aston Villa 0 Bolton 0 Aston Villa won 4<U+2013>1 on penalties|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/april-2nd-2000---fa-123004|publisher=Birmingham Mail|date=9 April 2010|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Bolton suffer semi-final heartbreak|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/801711.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 June 2000|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]<ref>{{cite web|title='We've only got ourselves to blame' <U+2013> says Bergsson |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/archive/2000/05/18/Lancashire+Archive/6082228._We_ve_only_got_ourselves_to_blame____says_Bergsson/ |publisher=The Bolton News|date=18 May 2000|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> respectively. In [[2000<U+2013>01 in English football|2000<U+2013>01]] Bolton were promoted back to the [[Premier League]] after beating Preston North End 3<U+2013>0 in the [[2001 Football League First Division play-off Final|play-off final]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Clockwatch: Bolton 3<U+2013>0 Preston|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1356039.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 May 2001|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>
Bolton struggled in the following two seasons, but survived in the Premier League. The 2001<U+2013>02 season began with a shock as they destroyed [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]] 5<U+2013>0 at [[Filbert Street]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Bolton blast Leicester|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1495420.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 August 2001|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> to go top of the table.

In the 2002<U+2013>03 season Bolton made a poor start and, despite another win away at Manchester United, they were bottom until a vital and spectacular 4<U+2013>2 win against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] at [[Elland Road]].<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC SPORT <U+2013> Football <U+2013> Eng Prem <U+2013> Bolton Stun Leeds|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2430743.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 November 2002|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> Despite suffering from a lack of consistency, Bolton ground out the results needed and secured survival in a final day 2<U+2013>1 victory over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2978087.stm|title= Bolton seal survival|date=11 May 2003|publisher=BBC| accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> The star of the season, [[Jay-Jay Okocha]], was another high profile signing and went on to be a legend at the Reebok Stadium.

Megson guided Bolton to survival with a 16th place finish, their safety being confirmed on the final day of the season, as they went on an unbeaten run for their final five games, as well as taking them to the last sixteen of the UEFA Cup. During the European run, Bolton gained a famous draw at former European champions [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] as well as becoming the first British team to beat [[Red Star Belgrade]] in Belgrade. They also defeated [[Atl<U+00E9>tico Madrid]] on aggregate before being knocked out by [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting Lisbon]].

The new manager broke Bolton's record transfer fee with the signing of [[Johan Elmander]] from Toulouse on 27 June 2008, in a deal which cost the club a reported <U+00A3>8.2&nbsp;million and saw Norwegian striker [[Daniel Braaten]] head in the opposite direction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bwfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~1335286,00.html|title=Wanderers land Swede|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=6 April 2009|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/7478332.stm|title=Bolton sign <U+00A3>10m-rated Elmander|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=6 April 2009|publisher=BBC Sport  }}</ref> Bolton's season started slowly, winning their opening game against [[Stoke City]] 3<U+2013>1 then going on a run of 5 games without a win. November was undoubtedly their best month with four wins from their five games losing only to [[Liverpool F.C|Liverpool]]. January saw former fan favourite [[Kevin Nolan]] leave the club to relegation bound [[Newcastle United]] in a <U+00A3>4&nbsp;million deal, with [[Mark Davies (footballer)|Mark Davies]] and [[S<U+00E9>bastien Puygrenier]] the only positive signings coming in. Tensions soon began to build between supporters and Megson after he branded them 'pathetic'.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/7858772.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Megson angered by 'pathetic' fans | date=29 January 2009}}</ref> This tension was key factor in his eventual sacking. Mixed results across the rest of the season left Bolton flirting with relegation but they finally finished 13th on 41 points.

Over the summer, Megson signed [[Sean Davis (footballer)|Sean Davis]], [[Lee Chung-Yong]], [[Zat Knight]], [[Paul Robinson (defender born 1978)|Paul Robinson]] (on-loan from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]]) and [[Ivan Klasni<U+0107>]] (on loan from [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]). The 2009<U+2013>2010 season started where the last one was headed, with only four wins from their opening 18 fixtures, notable losses including a 0<U+2013>2 home loss to [[Blackburn Rovers|Blackburn]] and a 1<U+2013>5 drubbing at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

On 30 December 2009, Bolton announced that Megson had been sacked by the club due to a run of poor performances. His last game in charge, the night before his sacking, was a 2<U+2013>2 draw at home to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] after letting slip a 2<U+2013>0 lead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/8434719.stm|title=Bolton Wanderers sack manager Gary Megson |date=30 December 2009|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref> On 8 January 2010, former player [[Owen Coyle]] was announced as Megson's replacement as manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~1926660,00.html|title=Coyle Is Back|date=8 January 2010|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|accessdate=8 January 2010}}</ref>

Coyle marked his first game in charge with a 2<U+2013>0 defeat to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], but won his next home match against former employers [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

However, Bolton's form picked up towards the half way point of the season and in January they climbed out of the relegation zone. During that months transfer window the club received their second highest ever transfer fee when [[England national football team|England]] defender Gary Cahill was sold to [[Chelsea F.C.]] for <U+00A3>7million. Bolton used some of this money to bring in defender [[Tim Ream]] from [[New York Red Bulls]] and forward [[Marvin Sordell]] from [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and also loaned Japanese midfielder [[Ryo Miyaichi]] from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for the rest of the season.

On 17 March 2012, Coyle travelled to the [[London Chest Hospital]] with [[Fabrice Muamba]] who had suffered from a Cardiac Arrest whilst playing against [[Tottenham Hotspur]] at [[White Hart Lane]] in a [[FA Cup]] match. Muamba stayed in a critical condition and Coyle has now pleaded for the most support possible around the country for Muamba.

On 13 May 2012, Bolton Wanderers were relegated from the Premiership by one point on the last day of the season after drawing 2<U+2013>2 with Stoke City. In the aftermath of relegation, chairman [[Phil Gartside]] revealed the intention to cut the wage bill by half to ease financial concerns surrounding the club. Striker [[Ivan Klasni<U+0107>]] and defender [[Mark Connolly]] were the first to leave the club.

On 9 October 2012, Bolton Wanderers announced that [[Owen Coyle]] had been relieved of his duties as manager after a dismal start to the Championship season, leaving Wanderers in 18th position going into the second international break of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/OfficialBWFC/status/255601006417686529 |title=Coyle relieved of duties |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> Following his sacking, [[Jimmy Phillips (footballer born 1966)|Jimmy Phillips]] and [[Sammy Lee (footballer)|Sammy Lee]] were put in temporary charge of the first team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/OfficialBWFC/status/255604574583394304 |title= Phillips and Lee put in temporary charge |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>

Freedman's first game in charge was a 2<U+2013>1 victory over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] at the [[Reebok Stadium]] where goals by [[Martin Petrov]] and [[David N'Gog]] secured the win. Freedman added to both his coaching and player options within the first fortnight of his tenure, with experienced coach [[Lennie Lawrence]] and former Palace team mate [[Curtis Fleming]] joining the Bolton staff. His first addition on the playing squad since taking over was that of the one month loan signing of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City's]] midfielder [[Jacob Butterfield]]. His first permanent signing as Bolton boss was [[Craig Davies (footballer)|Craig Davies]] from [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in early January 2013. This was followed by the signing of [[Craig Dawson]] on loan from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 24 January 2013, despite [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] all also having loan bids accepted. Additional to this he brought in midfielders [[Medo Kamara]] on a permanent basis from [[FK Partizan Belgrade]] and [[Steve De Ridder]] on loan from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] within his first transfer window as Bolton manager.
