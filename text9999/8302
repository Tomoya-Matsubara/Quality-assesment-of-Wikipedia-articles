'''Hurricane Henri''' was a rare [[tropical cyclone]] that entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] without having made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]]; it was the second of four times this occurred during the [[20th century]]. The eighth named storm and fifth hurricane of the [[1979 Atlantic hurricane season]], it formed on [[September 14]] in the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]]. Throughout much of its duration, Henri moved erratically and initially maintained a general westward track. On [[September 16]] it attained tropical storm status, and a day later it reached hurricane status. By two days later, after experiencing hostile conditions, Henri weakened to tropical depression status as it turned to the northeast, and on [[September 24]] it merged with a [[surface weather analysis|frontal low]] in the northeast Gulf of Mexico. Due to its slow and erratic motion, the hurricane forced evacuations along the [[Mexico|Mexican]] coastline. Its remnants brought rainfall and flooding to the [[Florida Panhandle]].

Hurricane Henri developed as Tropical Depression Seventeen in the extreme northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] on [[September 14]] from a [[tropical wave]], which had previously moved off the coast of [[Africa]].<ref name="tcr1">{{cite web | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1979-prelim/henri/prelim01.gif | title = Hurricane Henri Tropical Cyclone Report - Page 1| accessdate = 2008-01-10 | last = Hebert | first = Paul J. | date = 1979 | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] }}</ref> The formation of a tropical depression was confirmed by reports from [[Hurricane Hunters]].<ref name="ats">{{cite web | url = http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/108/7/pdf/i1520-0493-108-7-966.pdf | title = Atlantic Tropical Systems of 1979| accessdate = 2008-01-10 | last = Frank | first = Neil | date = 1980 | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] }}</ref> The depression tracked northward, brushing the eastern portion of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]]. After reaching the [[Gulf of Mexico]] it turned sharply westward, with a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] preventing further northward movement. The depression turned southwestward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Henri on [[September 16]].<ref name="tcr1"/>

Tropical Storm Henri continued to intensify as it tracked through the [[Bay of Campeche]]. On [[September 17]], the storm turned northwestward after the ridge to its north weakened, and later that day Henri reached hurricane status; six hours later, it reached peak winds of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) about 150&nbsp;miles (245&nbsp;km) northeast of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]. Subsequently, a broad [[low pressure area]] developed over the western Gulf of Mexico, causing the motion of Henri to become erratic. On [[September 18]], the cyclone began a steady weakening trend, believed to have been caused by land interaction and the funneling of moisture toward a developing disturbance near the [[Texas]] coast.<ref name="tcr1"/> Henri turned eastward on [[September 19]] and weakened to tropical depression status. It failed to regain significant convection, and it turned northeastward along an extended [[cold front]]. On [[September 24]], Henri merged with the frontal trough in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.<ref name="tcr2">{{cite web | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1979-prelim/henri/prelim02.gif | title = Hurricane Henri Tropical Cyclone Report - Page 2| accessdate = 2008-01-10 | last = Hebert | first = Paul J. | date = 1979 | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]]}}</ref>

This was the first use of the name ''Henri'' for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin. The name remained on the [[list of tropical cyclone names]], having been used for a weak tropical storm in [[1985 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Henri|1985]] and a tropical storm in [[Tropical Storm Henri (2003)|2003]]. It is scheduled to be re-used in the [[Post-2008 Atlantic hurricane seasons|2009 season]].<ref name="hurdat"/>
