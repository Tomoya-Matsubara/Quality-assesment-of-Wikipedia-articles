'''Song Xu''' ({{zh-cpw|c=<U+5B8B><U+65ED>|p=S<U+00F2>ng X<U+00F9>|w='''Sung Hs<U+00FC>'''}}, b. [[1525]]), was a Chinese landscape painter. His courtesy name was ''Shimen'' or <U+201C>Stone Gate<U+201D>, along with other designations. Song Xu eventually became a [[Buddhist]] priest and adopted various religious names. He was according to some sources from [[Jixing]] in [[Zhejiang]] province, but according to others from [[Huzhou]] in Zhejiang Province. He was and extremely well read and well versed individual who was greatly influenced by [[Zen]] (Chan) Buddhist teaching. He was an expert landscapist, but also excelled at human figures. In the late 1500s he traveled throughout China. A 1543 scroll shows his study of the [[Song Dynasty|Song period]] painter [[Hsia Kuei]]. He is said to have studied the works of the master artist [[Shen Zhou]] (1427-1509). Song's eccentric paintings are often characterized by inscriptions in characters of an archaic style. An extant painting of Buddhist Arhats bears a date of 1605. Other works show a still active painter at eighty-one. Song Xu was an artist that was largely individualistic and independent, working for the most part outside the major painting schools of his age.
