The third '''HMS ''Black Joke''''' was probably built in [[Baltimore]] in 1824, becoming the Brazilian [[slave ship]] ''Henriquetta''. The [[Royal Navy]] captured her in September 1827 and purchased her into the service.  The [[West Africa Squadron]] (or 'Preventative Squadron') employed her to chase down slave ships. Over the course of a five-year career she freed many hundreds of slaves. She was deliberately burnt in May 1832 because her timbers had rotted to the point that she was no longer fit for active service.

==''Henriquetta'' - slaver==

Built as a [[Baltimore Clipper]] (possibly the vessel ''Griffen''<ref name=TT>{{cite book |title=Tidewater Triumph: The Development and Worldwide Success of the Chesapeake Bay Pilot Schooner |last=Footner |first=Geoffrey |year=1998 |publisher=Mystic Seaport Museum |location=Mystic, CT |isbn=0-913372-80-3 |page=155 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M7a5mqVBo1YC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>), ''Henriquetta'' (also ''Henri Quatre'') was a [[brig]] designed to be fast. Sold to the Emperor of Brazil in 1825,<ref name=TT/> she worked for a slave dealer at [[Bahia]], making <U+20A4>80,000 ($400,000) by running 3,040 slaves across to Brazil in only six voyages over a period of three years.<ref>Villiers, Allan  (October 1955) "The Drive for SPEED AT SEA", ''American Heritage'' vol. 6 no. 6.</ref><ref name=Tinnie>Tinnie (2008).</ref>

[[French frigate Sibylle (1792)|HMS ''Sybille'']] captured her on 6 September 1827.<ref>Log of the [[French frigate Sibylle (1792)|HMS ''Sybille'']] held by [[The National Archives]], archival reference ADM 51/3466</ref> Lieutenant F A Collier, captain of ''Sybille'', wrote to the Admiralty noting that at the time of her capture ''Henriquetta'' was 257 tons, mounted 3 guns and had a crew of 38 men. She had 569 enslaved Africans on board "and had landed at Bahia 3,360 slaves in the last two years".<ref>Correspondence from Collier to the Admiralty, 12 December 1827, held at The National Archives, archival reference ADM 1/1682</ref>

She was sold at auction in Sierra Leone on 5 January 1828, for <U+00A3>330 ($1,650).<ref name=Tinnie/>

==''Black Joke'' - slave catcher==

She was taken into service as a tender to ''Sybille'', under the command of Lieutenant William Turner of ''Sybille''. During her service with the [[Royal Navy]], ''Black Joke''{{'}}s crew included an assistant surgeon, three midshipmen, thirty seamen and five marines as well as a number of [[Liberia]]n [[Seedies and Kroomen|Kroomen]] for use on detached boat service. She was armed with one long 18-pounder on a pivot mount.

On 5 January 1828 she sailed with ''Sybille'' and the 20-gun [[sixth-rate]] [[post ship]] [[HMS Esk (1813)|''Esk'']]. On 12 January she captured the Spanish schooner ''Gertrudes'', which carried 155 slaves. The ''Gertrudes'' had out-run the other two British warships, but not ''Black Joke''.

On 2 April a Spanish 14-gun brig fired on ''Black Joke'' as she approached the brig. After two hours of exchanging shots, and after suffering several casualties, the brig hoisted a flag of truce. She turned out to be the ''Providentia'', with a crew of 80 men. She had fired on the ''Black Joke'' as ''Providentia''{{'}}s captain had been warned that a Colombian privateer answering to the same description as ''Black Joke'' was in the area. Turner therefore released her.<ref name="Black Joke 1832">"Life and Adventures of the Black Joke, recently deceased at Sierra Leone" (1832) ''United service magazine'' vol.10.</ref>

On 1 May 1828 ''Black Joke'' fought the large and well-armed pirate ''President<U+00E9>''.  After two hours of action, and following the death of their captain and two others, as well as the wounding of a number more, the crew of the ''President<U+00E9>'' sought a truce.  (''Black Joke'' sustained one killed and a number wounded.)  The crew of ''President<U+00E9>'' underwent an examination before being committed for trial on charges of piracy.  Many of her crew appeared to be British or have anglicized names, and they were sent back to England for trial. The next day ''Black Joke'' retook the Portuguese vessel ''Hosse'', which ''President<U+00E9>'' had taken as a prize. ''Presidente'' was lost at sea on her way to Sierra Leone but ''Black Joke'' earned salvage money for ''Hosse''.<ref name="Black Joke 1832"/>

On 16 May, ''Black Joke'' captured ''Vengador''. She had a crew of 45 men and eight guns but offered no resistance. She carried 645 slaves, the most ever captured on a single ship.

On 14 November ''Black Joke'' assisted [[HMS Primrose (1810)|''Primrose'']] in catching the  ''Zephorina'', which was carrying 218 slaves. On 14 November Turner received promotion to Commander. He turned over command of ''Black Joke'' to Lieutenant Henry Downes of ''Sybille''. In November of the same year ''Black Joke'' was forced to leave the coast of [[Bioko|Fernando Po]] due to fever onboard.

In January 1829 ''Black Joke'' saw a Spanish brig as she loaded slaves and sailed for [[Havana]].  ''Black Joke'' chased her for a total of 31 hours, and when the wind dropped, resorted to [[oar|sweeps]] to bring herself within gunshot of her prey.  ''El Almirante'' mounted a total of 14 guns, ten Gover's 18-pounder [[cannon]] and 4 long 9-pounders, and a crew of 80 men. ''Black Joke'' was almost half the size of ''El Almirante'' and again, mounted just one 18-pounder.  Good shiphandling, the discipline of the Royal Navy gun crew, and light winds gave Lt Downes the advantage. In 80 minutes he defeated and captured the slaver, which  suffered 15 dead and a further 13 wounded, while ''Black Joke'' suffered only one killed and five wounded. ''El Almirante'' held 466 slaves, who were later landed.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://publishing.yudu.com/An8w/navynewsjune2007/resources/36.htm|title = Navy News, June 2007|accessdate =2008-02-09}}</ref>

On 6 March ''Black Joke'' captured the 2-gun brigantine ''Carolina'', which carried 420 slaves. After this capture Downes was invalided home because of illness, and received a promotion to Commander on his return in recognition of the capture of ''El Almirante''. He had freed a total of 887 slaves.

By April 1830 ''Black Joke'' was in refit in [[Sierra Leone]]. In July she captured the ''Dos Amigos'', a Baltimore schooner with a crew of 34 and armed with a single carronade. When ''Black Joke'' captured her she had 567 African captives aboard. The Admiralty put ''Dos Amigos'' up for auction where the Commodore of the British Anti-Slavery Squadron, Jonathan Hayes, bought her and named her [[HMS Fair Rosamond (1830)|''Fair Rosamond'']].  In December ''Black Joke'' was cruising in the [[Bight of Benin]] with [[HMS Medina (1813)|HMS ''Medina'']].

On 21 February 1831 she captured a slaver with 300 slaves on board. In a famous action on 26 April 1831, while under the command of Lt William Ramsey, ''Black Joke'' captured the much larger and more heavily armed Spanish slaver ''Marinerito'' off the island of [[Fernando Po|Bioko]]. At one point, 14-year-old Midshipman Hinde from ''Black Joke'' took command and rescued the boarding party, including Ramsey, which had become stranded on the Spanish slaver's deck. ''Marinerito'' had 15 of her crew killed; ''Black Joke'' lost one man killed. Of the 496 slaves on ''Marinerito'', 26 were found to have died and 107 were in so weakened a state that they were landed on Bioko, where more than half subsequently died. The remainder were taken to freedom in Sierra Leone.

In September, in company with ''Fair Rosamond'', ''Black Joke'' chased two Spanish slavers into the [[Bonny River]].  ''Black Joke''{{'}}s captain, [[Lieutenant]] Ramsey, reported that "during the chase they were seen to throw their slaves overboard, by twos shackled together by the ankles, and left in this manner to sink or swim." The British captured the Spanish vessels, ''Regulus'' and ''Rapido'', on 10 September and took them to [[Sierra Leone]], where the [[Admiralty Court]] condemned them.  ''Black Joke'' freed 39 slaves, for which a half bounty was paid to the captain and crew.  A further bounty was paid for the 29 slaves who died between the capture and the condemnation of the ''Regulo''.

In all, between November 1830 and March 1832, ''Black Joke'' and ''Fair Rosamond'' accounted for 11 out of the squadron's take of 13 slavers.

==Fate==

A survey held on the ''Black Joke'' in 1832 stated that her timbers were rotten, and that "she is not, in our opinion, a vessel calculated fit for H.M. Service."  There were discussions about further use of ''Black Joke'', including use as a Government vessel for Sierra Leone. She was due to be transferred to the governor when the Rear Admiral changed his mind and ordered that ''Black Joke'' be destroyed. She was burnt on 3 May 1832<ref>Correspondence between the governor, the Colonial Secretary and the Board of Admiralty held by The National Archives, reference ADM 1/4249</ref> and her stores sold.  The surveyors attached examples of her timber; all that now remains of the famous slave-chaser is an envelope filled with brown dust in [[The National Archives]]. In 1958 "a small quantity of the 'testings' of the timber of ''Black Joke'' were sent to Lagos for exhibition in the museum there".<ref>The National Archives reference ADM 1/74</ref>.

When the Royal Navy ordered that ''Black Joke'' be burned, Peter Leonard, surgeon of [[HMS Dryad (1795)|HMS ''Dryad'']], wrote that she was the ship {{cquote|which has done more towards putting an end to the vile traffic in slaves than all the ships of the station put together.<ref>Lloyd, Christopher (1968) ''The Navy and the Slave Trade: The Suppression of the African Slave Trade in the Nineteenth Century''.(Routledge).
