'''''Lord of the Universe''''' is a 1974 [[documentary film]] about [[Prem Rawat]] (at the time known as Guru Maharaj Ji) at an event in November 1973 at the [[Houston Astrodome]] called "[[Millennium '73]]". ''Lord of the Universe'' was first broadcast on [[PBS]] on February 2, 1974, and released in a [[VHS]] format on November 1, 1991. The documentary chronicles Maharaj Ji, his followers and [[anti-Vietnam War]] activist [[Rennie Davis]] who was a spokesperson of the [[Divine Light Mission]] at the time. A counterpoint is presented by [[Abbie Hoffman]] who appears as a commentator. It includes interviews with several protagonists, including followers, ex-followers, a [[mahatma]], a [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christian]], and a [[Hare Krishna]].

The production team of [[TVTV|Top Value Television]] produced the documentary, using [[Portapak]] video cameras. The TVTV team followed Maharaj Ji across the United States over a period of six weeks, and edited a large amount of tape down to the fifty-eight minute piece. It was the first documentary made on 1/2-inch (13&nbsp;mm) video tape broadcast nationally, and also the first independent video documentary shown on national public television. 

The documentary was generally well-received, and garnered its TVTV production team the 1974 [[Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award|Alfred I. du Pont/Columbia University Award in Broadcast Journalism]]. The documentary received a negative review in the ''[[New York Post]]'', and positive reviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. The ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'' wrote that the TVTV team had improved since their previous work, but wanted them to move on to more challenging subjects.

Abbie Hoffman appears as a commentator in the documentary, and addresses some of the points raised in Davis' speech, stating: "It's rather arrogant of Rennie to say that he has found God and has his Telex number in his wallet."<ref name="adler" /> The TVTV crew interviewed different "premies", or followers of Prem Rawat, throughout the film, and one teenage boy was quoted as stating: "Before I came to the Guru I was a freak, smoking dope and dropping out - and my parents were happier then than they are with this."<ref name="adler" /> In a later part of the film, a loudspeaker voice announces: "Those premies who came in private cars can leave now..Those who came in rented buses can stay and meditate until further notice."<ref name="adler" /><ref name="subtle" />  Adherents of other belief systems also appear in the documentary, including a born-again Christian who criticizes devotees for "following the devil", and a Hare Krishna follower.<ref name="boylerevisited">{{cite book | last =Boyle | first =Deirdre | title =Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited | publisher =Oxford University Press US | year =1997 |  pages =76<U+2013>85 | isbn = 0195110544}}</ref>

A separate storyline is seen concurrently through the coverage of the "Millennium '73" event, involving a man named Michael who has come to [[Houston, Texas]] to receive [[Teachings of Prem Rawat|"Knowledge"]] from Maharaj Ji.  Once Michael has received the "Knowledge", he defends the secrecy behind the rituals.  Michael's experiences are contrasted in the documentary with interviews with "ex-premies" or former followers of Maharaj Ji, recounting their initiation and later disillusionment with Maharaj Ji's teachings.  One of them says after receiving "Knowledge" from Maharaj Ji, he was told that this free gift required lifetime devotion and donations of "worldly goods".<ref name="boylerevisited" />

Maharaj Ji is shown in a scene in the Astrodome relating a ''[[satsang]]'' to the attendants.  He is seen dressed in gold-colored clothing and a crown, and sits on a platform throne.  The story he relates to the crowd involves a young boy who comes to Houston, while searching for a [[Superman]] [[comic book]].  While seated on the platform, Maharaj Ji is surrounded by flashing moon signs and women wearing [[Garland (decoration)|decorative garlands]], while a band called "Blue Aquarius" plays his theme song.<ref name="boylerevisited" />  The stage is decorated with glitter and [[neon light]]s, and Maharaj Ji's brother performs [[rock music]] songs.<ref name="boyle" />  Abbie Hoffman gives a final comment in the documentary, stating: "If this guy is God, this is the God the United States of America deserves."<ref name="intermix" /><ref name="subtle" /><ref name="boylerevisited" />

== Production ==
The documentary was produced by Top Value Television (TVTV) in association with TV Lab, and was primarily directed by [[Michael Shamberg]].<ref name="shales" /><ref name="televisionquarterly">{{cite journal | last =Popkin| first = Ray | title =What's Light, Quick, Cheap ... and Revolutionary? | journal =Television Quarterly | volume = 12  | issue = 2| pages =pp. 54<U+2013>57 | publisher =[[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] |date =Spring 1975}}</ref>   TVTV had received initial funding for the documentary through a small grant from the Stern Foundation, with an additional promise from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]].<ref name="televisionquarterly" />  David Loxton arranged a post-production budget of [[USD|USD$]]4,000, and the total production costs for the documentary amounted to $36,000 <U+2013> about forty-five percent of the average costs for a PBS film production at the time.<ref name="boylerevisited" />  Several camera crews used 1/2-inch (13&nbsp;mm) black and white portapaks, and followed Maharaj Ji and his group across the United States for six weeks.<ref name="adler" /><ref name="televisionquarterly" />  The TVTV production team debated whether or not to include the secret techniques of Maharaj Ji in the documentary, and finally decided that it was vital to disclose these practices in the piece.<ref name="boylerevisited" />  They chose to have an ex-premie divulge these practices rather than use a narration, but were fearful of potential repercussions, which never came.<ref name="boylerevisited" />  TVTV member Tom Weinberg found a man who demonstrated [[meditation]] techniques in the documentary, which he described as being the "Knowledge".<ref name="boylerevisited" />  Producer Megan Williams stated that TVTV crew members empathized with the experiences of Maharaj Ji's followers, because there was very little age difference between them and the TVTV production team. Nevertheless, many in the crew of TVTV felt superior to these "lost souls" describing the followers as "gurunoids".<ref name="boylerevisited" />

At the end of filming, eighty-two hours of tape were edited to the final fifty-eight minute documentary piece.<ref name="televisionquarterly" />  TVTV's team utilized [[graphic]]s, live music, and [[wide angle lens]] shots.<ref name="vdb" />   [[Stop-action]] sequences where quotations flash on the screen were also used for effect.<ref name="adler" />  The production was the first Portapak video documentary made  for national television, and the "first program originally made on 1/2-inch [13&nbsp;mm] video tape to be broadcast nationally".<ref name="intermix" /><ref name="johannagill">{{cite news  | last =Gill | first =Johanna |title =Video: State of the Art | work =Video History Project | page =1 of 3 |publisher =Experimental Television Center | url =http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/history/people/ptext.php3?id=29&page=1 | accessdate =  2007-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  | last =High | first =Kathy | title =On Reel New York | work =[[WNET|thirteen WNET New York]] |publisher = [[WNET]]| url =http://www.thirteen.org/reelny/previous_seasons/reelnewyork2/overview.html | accessdate =  2007-11-07}}</ref>  ''Lord of the Universe'' was also: "The first independent video documentary made for national broadcast on public television."<ref>{{cite book

== Reception ==
=== Awards ===
The documentary received the 1974 "Alfred I. du Pont/Columbia University Award in Broadcast Journalism"   (DuPont Award).<ref name="intermix" /><ref name="vdb">{{cite web | last =Staff |title =Lord of the Universe | work =Video Data Bank | url =http://www.vdb.org/smackn.acgi$tapedetail?LORDOFTHEU  |  accessdate =  2007-11-07}}</ref><ref name="dupont" />  The jurors from the 1974 DuPont-Columbia awards stated that the documentary was: "hectic, hilarious and not a little disquieting. With a heavier and less sure hand, the subject would have been squashed beneath the reporters<U+2019> irony or contempt. As it was, cult religion was handed to us, live and quivering, to make of it what we would."<ref name="dupont" />  The group<U+2019>s work impressed WNET president [[John Jay Iselin]], and he raised additional funds that helped TVTV to produce five more programs, including ''Gerald Ford<U+2019>s America''.<ref name="video history project">{{cite news  | last =Mella | first =Leanne  |title =Set in Motion: The New York State Council on the Arts Celebrates 30 Years of Independents: On Television | work =Video History Project  | year =1994 | url =http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/history/people/ptext.php3?id=61&page=1 | accessdate = 2007-11-08 }}</ref>

=== Reviews ===
Ron Powers of the ''Chicago Sun Times'' called the documentary "highly recommended viewing", and described it as: "...&nbsp;both as an example of skeptical, unimpressed (but never vicious) journalism, and as a peek into the future of television&nbsp;...&nbsp;a clever, ironic and eventually devastating documentary".<ref>{{cite news  | last =Powers | first = Ron |title ='Participatory TV Goes to Guru Gala |publisher = ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]''
  | date = March 16, 1974}}</ref>  ''Electronic Arts Intermix'' described ''Lord of the Universe'' as "a forceful expose on the sixteen-year-old Guru Maharaj Ji and the national gathering of his followers at the Houston Astrodome".<ref name="intermix" />  Michael Blowen of ''The Boston Globe'' wrote that the documentary "captures the absurdity of Millennium '73", and that "The desperation of flower people alienated from politics is both touching and hilarious as they offer hope for eternal life to other converts."<ref name="blowen">{{cite news   | last =Blowen  | first =Michael  |title =A Glimpse of America 'Subject to Change'  | work =[[The Boston Globe]]  | page =31  | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]]  | date =February 21, 1989 }}</ref>  

Dick Adler of the ''Los Angeles Times'' gave the documentary a positive review, writing: "'The Lord of the Universe' doesn't really take sides, which doesn't mean it's a bland hour trying to please everybody.  It's considerable bite comes first from the material TVTV so carefully gathered and there from the artfully wise frame in which it chose to present it."<ref name="adler">{{cite news  | last =Adler | first =Dick | title =TV REVIEW: Videotape Explorers on Trail of a Guru | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | page =B2 | date =February 23, 1974}}</ref>  Deirdre Boyle wrote in ''Art Journal'' that the piece was "the zenith of TVTV's guerrilla-TV style".<ref name="boyle" /> According to Boyle's ''Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited'', as in all TVTV tapes, everyone in the documentary comes across as foolish, describing the production's sarcasm as the "ultimate leveler" using equal irony  "both with the mighty and the lowly".<ref name="boylerevisited" /> 

Katy Butler writing in the ''San Francisco Bay Guardian'' stated that the TVTV style had improved since their previous work, noting: "This show has fewer interjections from TVTV personnel, fewer moments that drag, more technological razzle-dazzle (color footage, slow motion, stop motion, tight and rapid cutting)."  However, she also described Guru Maharaj Ji and his entourage as "an easy target", and wrote that "anybody can look like a fool when a smartass wide angle lens distorts their face, and teenage ex-dopers who think a fat boy is God don't stand a chance".  Butler wished that TVTV would move on to more challenging subjects for their future work.<ref>{{cite news  | last =Butler | first =Kay  |title =Dissecting the Guru on the Tube | work =[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]] |date =February 28, 1974}}</ref> Bob Williams of the ''New York Post'' called the documentary a "deplorable film" and "flat, pointless, television".<ref name="bobwilliams" />  He wrote: "The hour-long program was remiss in not providing some small examination of the available box-office take of the goofy kid guru, much less telling prospective contributors how it got involved in spending how much of its foundation grants and viewer subscription money in such a questionable venture without more inquisitive journalistic endeavor, or ignoring gurus."<ref name="bobwilliams">{{cite news  | last = Wiliams | first = Bob |title =On the Air: TVTV Illuminates the Ji |publisher = ''[[New York Post]]'' | date = February 25, 1974|page=42}}</ref>

A review in ''[[The Oakland Tribune]]'' described the film as "a fascinating hour documentary on the guru's three-day happening at the Houston Astrodome", and commented that the event was "deftly captured by the mobile video cameras of TVTV, a group of talented young tapemakers".<ref>{{cite news | last =Staff | title =March On Television | work =[[The Oakland Tribune]] | date =March 11, 1974}}</ref> John J. O'Connor, of ''The New York Times'' described TVTV's work as "a terrific documentary", and complimented the team on the visual results of the piece, noting: "After TVTV superbly dissected the guru, his 'holy family' and his followers, more objective viewers might have chosen to laugh, cry, or throw up."<ref>{{cite news  | last = O'Connor | first =John J.| title =TV: Meditating on Young Guru and His Followers | work =[[The New York Times]] | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date =February 25, 1974}}</ref> In a later piece by O'Connor in 1975, he wrote that TVTV "gained a respectable measure of national success with 'The Lord of the Universe'".<ref>{{cite news | last =O'Connor | first =John J. | title =TV Review; Videotapes Living Up to Star Billing | work =[[The New York Times]] | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date =February 6, 1975 }}</ref>
