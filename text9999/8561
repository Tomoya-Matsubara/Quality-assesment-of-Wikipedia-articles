'''Inauguration of a Torah scroll''' ({{lang-he|<U+05D4><U+05DB><U+05E0><U+05E1><U+05EA> <U+05E1><U+05E4><U+05E8> <U+05EA><U+05D5><U+05E8><U+05D4>}}, ''Hachnasat Sefer Torah'') is a ceremony in which one or more [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] are installed in a [[synagogue]], or in the sanctuary or [[Beth midrash|study hall]] of a [[yeshiva]], rabbinical college, university campus, nursing home, military base, or other institution. The ceremony is held for new and restored scrolls alike, as well as for the transfer of Torah scrolls from one sanctuary to another.

If the Torah scroll is a new one, the ceremony begins with the writing of the last letters of the scroll in the home of the donor. All scrolls are then carried in an outdoor procession to the synagogue, characterized by singing, dancing, and musical accompaniment. Inside the synagogue, there is more singing and dancing, a short prayer service, placement of the scroll in the [[Torah ark]], and a ''[[seudat mitzvah]]'' (celebratory meal).

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 19427 Religion in Israel.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Hachnosat Sefer Torah procession in [[Lod]], Israel, early 1960s]]
The escorting of a Torah scroll to its new home has its source in the procession of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] to [[Jerusalem]], led by King [[David]]. As described in the [[Book of Samuel]], this event was marked by dancing and the playing of musical instruments.<ref>II [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] 6:14-15.</ref> Both the [[Kohen|kohanim]] and David himself "danced before the Ark" or "danced before the Lord".<ref name=chabad>{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1041022/jewish/Dedicating-a-New-Torah-Scroll.htm|title=Dedicating a New Torah Scroll|first=Baruch S.|last=Davidson|publisher=[[Chabad|Chabad.org]]|year=2015|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|van der Zande|2012|p=104}}

==Description==
===Writing the final letters===

If the Torah scroll is a new one, the event begins with a ceremony called ''siyum haTorah'' (completion of the Torah) or ''kesivas haosiyos'' (writing of the letters), in which the final letters at the end of the scroll are inked in by honorees. This ceremony usually takes place in the home of the one who is donating the scroll. The basis for this practice is a [[Talmud]]ic teaching that whoever corrects one letter in a Torah scroll earns the same merit as one who writes an entire Torah scroll.<ref>''[[Kodashim#Menachot|Menachot]]'' 30a.</ref> It is considered a great honor to be selected for the writing of one of the last letters.{{sfn|van der Zande|2012|pp=104-5}} Since most people are not professional scribes, many [[Sofer|scribe]]s outline the final letters beforehand for the honorees to fill in.<ref name=chabad/>{{sfn|Blumenthal|Liss|2005|p=363}}

The Torah scroll is then dressed in its mantle and sash, and adorned with its crown and ''[[yad]]'' (pointer) (in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] communities);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chabadhouston.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/58112/jewish/Customs-for-a-new-Sefer-Torah.htm|title=Customs for a New Sefer Torah|year=2015|accessdate=12 May 2015|publisher=Chabad.org}}</ref> in [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] communities, the Torah scroll is placed in an ornamental wooden or silver case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jstandard.com/index.php/content/item/dancing_in_the_street/ |title=Dancing in the Street|first=Abigail Klein|last=Leichman|date=28 September 2014|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=Jewish Standard}}</ref> Following the responsive reading of several verses, the procession begins.<ref name=ott/>

The scroll or scrolls are carried under a [[chuppah]] (marriage canopy), as "acceptance of the Torah is seen as being analogous to a marriage with God".{{sfn|van der Zande|2012|p=105}}{{refn|The marriage imagery is derived from the [[Midrash]], which compares the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai to a wedding: "Mount Sinai was the chuppah, the Jewish people the bride, the Almighty the groom, and the ring the Torah".{{sfn|van der Zande|2012|p=105}}}} The chuppah may be as simple as a ''[[tallit]]'' supported by four poles,{{sfn|van der Zande|2012|p=105}} or a velvet canopy supported by poles.

[[File:AmonaTorah5312.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Dancing with the new Torah scroll and other Torah scrolls in [[Amona, Mateh Binyamin|Amona]]]]
When the procession nears the synagogue, yeshiva, or other destination, the other Torah scrolls that are already housed in the [[Torah ark|ark]] of the sanctuary are removed and carried outside to "welcome" the new scroll; then all the scrolls are carried inside together.<ref name=ott>{{cite web |url=http://ott.co.il/new-torah/ |title=Torah Dedication|publisher=Ot Institute|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>

Inside the synagogue, public prayers are recited in the style of [[Simchat Torah]], beginning with ''Atah hareisa'' (You have betrothed).<ref name=chabad/><ref name=ott/> Then the men and boys in attendance dance seven ''[[hakafot]]'' (circuits) around the [[bimah|reader's table]] while holding all the Torah scrolls, similar to the synagogue celebrations on Simchat Torah.<ref name=chabad/> Following this, the Torah scrolls that already belong to the synagogue are returned to the ark and the new Torah scroll is placed on the reader's table. The donor of the scroll says the blessing of ''[[Shehecheyanu]]'', both on the new scroll and on the new clothing that he wears in honor of the occasion.<ref name=ott/> A [[Torah reading|Torah reader]] reads the final chapter of the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] (Deuteronomy 34:1-12) from the new scroll. The scroll is then placed in the ark amid more singing and dancing.<ref name=ott/> The cantor then recites Psalm 24 with the traditional tune sung on [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Yom Kippur]],{{sfn|Benisch|2003|p=468}} followed by the recital of additional verses, ''[[Aleinu]]'', and the [[Kaddish#Mourner's Kaddish|Mourner's Kaddish]].<ref name=ott/>

Everyone in attendance then sits down to a ''seudas mitzvah'' (festive meal) at which the Rav of the congregation and other [[Talmid Chacham|Torah scholars]] discourse on subjects pertaining to the importance of the Torah, such as valuing [[Torah study]], supporting Torah scholars and institutions, and living a Torah lifestyle.<ref name=chabad/>{{sfn|van der Zande|2012|p=104}}
