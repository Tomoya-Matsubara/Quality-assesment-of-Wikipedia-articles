Viruses are [[parasite]]s that reproduce inside the [[cell biology|cells]] of the organisms they infect. When a virus infects a cell, it reprograms that cell's normal [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes thereby forcing the cell to make thousands of identical copies of the infecting virus by using the cell's [[protein]], [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] building blocks. This process usually kills the infected cell. 

Viruses are grouped depending on the type of organism they infect. Therefore viruses are either animal, plant or [[bacteria]]l types. They are so small that it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to cover 1 centimetre. The origins of viruses is unclear; some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s or [[transposon]]s, which are stretches of [[DNA]] that can exist separately from [[chromosome]]s. Other viruses may have evolved from [[bacteria]].

A virus consists of two parts: the genetic material, a [[nucleic acid]] that contains all the information necessary for the production of new virus particles, and a protein coat that protects this genetic material. The coat is called a [[capsid]] and can either be a simple container, or a much more complex structure, containing [[enzyme]]s. Capsid shapes vary from simple helical and icosahedral (polyhedral or near-spherical) forms, to more complex structures with tails or an [[viral envelope|envelope]]. 

Plant, animal and bacterial cells all contain two types of nucleic acid. The genetic information needed to make new proteins is always encoded in [[DNA]]: this code is translated into a specific type of [[RNA]] called [[messenger RNA]] that carries the information to the parts of the cell that make proteins. In contrast, each type of virus only contains one type of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA. 

Within cells there are structures called [[organelle]]s, each organelle has one or more important functions. These organelles along with cell enzymes are needed for [[metabolism]] and life. Viruses do not have organelles and must use those within a cell to reproduce. Outside of a host cell, viruses are completely inactive and are considered neither living nor dead. Indeed, it is controversial whether viruses are actually living organisms. Some consider them non-living since they do not meet all the criteria of the definition of [[life]]. However, viruses do have genes and evolve over time.

Viral infections in human and animals usually cause an immune response and disease. Often, a virus is completely eliminated by the [[immune system]]. [[Antibiotic]]s have no effect on viruses, but [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed to treat life-threatening infections. [[Vaccine]]s that produce lifelong [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] can prevent virus infections.

Viruses spread in many different ways. Viruses of plants are often spread from plant to plant by insects acting as [[vector (biology)|vector]]s. Specific virus infections of animals and humans are also spread by biting insects. But not all viruses can be spread in this way. Each [[species]] of virus relies on a specific method. Some, such as [[influenza]] are carried by the air and are spread by coughing and sneezing. Others, such as [[norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]] contaminate food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses that are transmitted during sex.

==Origins of viruses==
The origin of modern viruses is not entirely clear but <ref>Holmes EC, Drummond AJ. The evolutionary genetics of viral emergence.Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2007;315:51-66.</ref> [[Molecular biology|molecular techniques]] have been the most useful means of hypothesising how they arose,<ref>Liu Y, Nickle DC, Shriner D, Jensen MA, Learn GH Jr, Mittler JE, Mullins JI. Molecular clock-like evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.Virology. 2004 Nov 10;329(1):101-8.</ref> and two main hypotheses currently exist.<ref name="prescott">{{cite book | title=Microbiology| last=Prescott| first=L| date=1993| publisher=Wm. C. Brown Publishers| id=0-697-01372-3}}</ref> 

Small viruses with only a few genes may be runaway stretches of nucleic acid originating from the genome of a living organism. Their genetic material could have been derived from transferable genetic elements such as [[plasmid]]s or [[transposon]]s, that are prone to moving within, leaving, and entering genomes. In this way new viruses are constantly emerging and therefore, not all viruses have viral "ancestors".<ref>Keese P, Gibbs A. Plant viruses: master explorers of evolutionary space.Curr Opin Genet Dev. 1993 Dec;3(6):873-7.</ref> 

Viruses with larger genomes, such as [[poxvirus]]es, may have once been small cells that parasitised larger host cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitic lifestyle would have been lost in a streamlining process known as ''retrograde-evolution'' or ''reverse-evolution''. The bacteria [[Rickettsia]] and [[Chlamydia]] are living cells that, like viruses, can only reproduce inside host cells. They lend credence to the streamlining hypothesis, as their parasitic lifestyle is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a host cell.

== Discovery of viruses ==
[[Image:TMV.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Tobacco mosaic virus]]]]
In the late 19th century [[Charles Chamberland]] made a filter with holes small enough to remove [[bacteria]].<ref name=Horzinek_1997>{{cite journal | author = Horzinek MC| title = The birth of virology | journal = Antonie van Leeuwenhoek | year = 1997 | volume = 71 | pages = 15&ndash;20 | doi=10.1023/A:1000197505492 }}</ref> [[Dimitri Ivanovski]] used this filter to study [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. He published the results of his experiments which proved that crushed leaf extracts of infected tobacco plants were still infectious after filtration. 
At the same time, several other scientists proved that, although these agents were different from bacteria, they could cause disease, and that viruses were about a hundred times smaller than bacteria. The term ''virus'' was first used by the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]] who used the words "contagium vivum fluidum" to mean <U+201C>soluble living germ<U+201D>.<ref>Chung, King-Thom and Ferris, Deam Hunter (1996).

Counting these dead areas allowed him to count the viruses in the suspension. 

With the invention of [[electron microscopy]] came the first images of viruses. In 1935 [[Wendell Stanley]] examined tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from [[protein]].<ref name="pmid17756690">{{cite journal |author=Stanley WM, Loring HS |title=The isolation of crystalline tobacco mosaic virus protein from diseased tomato plants|journal= |volume=83 |issue=2143 |pages=85 |year=1936 |pmid=17756690 |doi=10.1126/science.83.2143.85}}</ref> A short time later the virus was separated into protein and [[nucleic acid]] parts.<ref name="pmid17788438">{{cite journal |author=Stanley WM, Lauffer MA |title=Disintegration of tobacco mosaic virus in urea solutions |journal= |volume=89 |issue=2311 |pages=345<U+2013>347 |year=1939 |pmid=17788438 |doi=10.1126/science.89.2311.345}}</ref><ref name="pmid16590772">{{cite journal |author=Tsugita A, Gish DT, Young J, Fraenkel-Conrat H, Knight CA, Stanley WM |title=The complete protein amin acid sequence of the protein of Tobacco Mosaic Virus |journal=Proc.

== Structure of viruses ==
[[Image:Virus-types.png|right|thumb|400px|Virus structure]]
A virus particle, known as a [[virion]] consists of [[nucleic acid]] surrounded by a protective coat of [[protein]] called a [[capsid]].<ref name="pmid14019094">{{cite journal |author=CASPAR DL, KLUG A |title=Physical principles in the construction of regular viruses |journal=Cold Spring Harb.

The arrangement of the capsomers can either be [[truncated icosahedron|icosahedral]] (20<U+2013>sided) or helical. Most viruses made from DNA are icosahedral and RNA viruses are either helical or icosahedral.The proteins that attach to the nucleic acid are known as [[nucleoprotein]]s, and together form a [[nucleocapsid]]. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of [[lipid]] called an [[viral envelope|envelope]]. Most DNA viruses do not have an envelope but most RNA viruses are enveloped.

=== Size ===
Viruses are some of the smallest infectious agents and the majority of them can only be seen by [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]]. Most viruses are around 100 [[nanometres|nm]] in diameter but their sizes range from 20 to 300nm. They are so small that it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to cover 1 centimetre.<ref name="pmid14019094">{{cite journal

===Virus genes ===
There are two kinds of genetic material: [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA or RNA sequence. Most organisms use DNA, but [[RNA virus|many viruses]] (e.g., [[retrovirus]]es) have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA and RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix. 

Viruses, although simple compared to cell-based organisms, are very efficient at reproducing. They have only a few [[gene]]s compared to humans who have 20,000<U+2013>25,000.<ref name="IHSGC2004">{{cite journal | author = International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome. | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011 | pages = 931-45 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15496913}} [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7011/full/nature03001.html] </ref> For example, [[Influenza]] virus has only 8 genes and [[rotavirus]] has 11. These genes encode structural proteins, i.e. form the viral structure, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus. 

Most viruses produce a protein that is an [[enzyme]] called a polymerase. Polymerase is used to make new copies of the viral DNA or RNA. Often this protein is also a structural protein that forms part of the virus particle. These polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient than their counterparts produced by the host cell.

In some species of virus the DNA or RNA is not a continuous [[molecule]] but is split into several separate strands. These are called segmented [[genome]]s. The Influenza virus genome is made up from 8 separate segments of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these segments can mix and produce new strains of the virus, this is called [[genetic|reassortment]].

===Virus protein synthesis===
[[image:Biological cell.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram of a typical [[eukaryotic]] cell, showing subcellular components. [[Organelle]]s: (1) [[nucleolus]] (2) [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (3) [[ribosome]] (4) [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] (5) rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) (6) [[Golgi apparatus]] (7) [[Cytoskeleton]] (8) smooth ER (9) [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (10) [[vacuole]] (11) [[cytoplasm]] (12) [[lysosome]] (13) [[centriole]]s within [[centrosome]]]]
Cells make new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information encoded in [[RNA]]. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce [[messenger RNA]] which migrates through the cell. The mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called [[ribosome]]s where they are used to make proteins. This is called translation. The protein amino acid sequence is based on the mRNA [[nucleoside|base]] sequence. 

Virus particles are made from several [[protein]]s that they cannot produce by themselves, therefore they rely on the host cell to make them. Viruses do this in many different ways, however, eventually all of them produce mRNA.<ref name="pmid4329869">{{cite journal

In other RNA viruses, the genomic RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called negative-sense RNA viruses. In viruses made of DNA the method of mRNA production is similar to a cell. Retroviruses are very different, they are based on RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.<ref name="pmid17433108">{{cite journal

== Virus life-cycle ==

{{main|Viral life cycle}}

[[Image:HepC replication.png|left|thumb|400px|Life-cycle of a typical virus, following infection of a cell by a single virus, thousands of offspring are released]]
Viruses can only multiply within a living cell. When a virus infects a cell, it makes the cell form new viruses by synthesising new viral nucleic acid and proteins, thereby forming complete new virus particles.<ref>N.J. Dimmock et al. "Introduction to Modern Virology, 6th edition." Blackwell Publishing, 2007.</ref><ref>N.J. Dimmock et al. "Introduction to Modern Virology, 6th edition." Blackwell Publishing, 2007.</ref>

There are six ''basic'', overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:<ref> {{cite book

'''Attachment''' is a binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) infects only human [[T cells]], because its surface protein, [[gp120]], can only react with [[CD4]] and other molecules on the T cell's surface. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells that they are capable of replicating in.
  
'''Penetration''': following attachment, viruses enter the host cell by [[endocytosis]] or by fusion with the cell. 

'''Uncoating''' happens inside the cell when the viral [[capsid]] is removed and destroyed by viral [[enzymes]] or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid. 

'''Replication''' of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses foreign messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus' nucleic acids by viral polymerase. 

'''Assembly''' takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form new virus particles.

'''Release''' occurs when the new viruses escape from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by causing the cells to burst, a process called [[lysis]]. Other viruses such as [[HIV]] are released more gently by a process called [[viral shedding|budding]].

==Viruses and disease==
:''For more examples of diseases caused by viruses see [[List of infectious diseases]]''
[[Image:Norwalk.jpg|thumb|[[Norovirus]]. Ten Norovirus particles; this RNA virus causes winter vomiting disease. It is often in the news as a cause of gastro-enteritis on cruise ships and in hospitals.]]
Human diseases caused by viruses include the [[common cold]], [[influenza|the flu]], [[chickenpox]] and [[cold sores]]. Serious diseases such as [[Ebola]], [[AIDS]] and [[influenza]] are caused by viruses. The ability of viruses to cause disease is called [[virulence]] and the mechanism is called [[pathogenesis]].
Viruses cause different diseases depending on the types of cell that they infect. 
Some viruses can cause life-long or [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections where the viruses continue to replicate in the body despite the hosts' defense mechanisms.<ref name="pmid17931183">{{cite journal |author=Bertoletti A, Gehring A |title=Immune response and tolerance during chronic hepatitis B virus infection |journal=Hepatol.

People chronically infected with Hepatitis B virus are known as carriers who serve as reservoirs of infectious virus.

There are many ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by insects called [[vector (biology)|vector]]s. Common vectors include [[Bacteria]], [[Fungi]], [[Nematodes]], [[arthropods]] and [[arachnids]].  Some viruses that infect animals and humans are also spread by biting insects, but direct animal-to-animal, person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission is more common. Some virus infections are spread by contaminated food and water, ([[Norovirus]] and [[Rotavirus]]), others are  airborne, ([[Influenza|Influenza virus]]). Viruses such as [[HIV]], [[Hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C]] are often transmitted by [[unprotected sex]] or contaminated [[hypodermic needle]]s. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread in order to prevent infections and epidemics.

==Prevention and treatment==
===Vaccines===
{{details|Vaccination}}
[[Vaccination]] is a way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as [[polio]], [[measles]], [[mumps]] and [[rubella]].<ref name="pmid17068034">{{cite journal |author=Asaria P, MacMahon E |title=Measles in the United Kingdom: can we eradicate it by 2010? |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7574 |pages=890<U+2013>5 |year=2006 |pmid=17068034 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38989.445845.7C}}</ref> [[Smallpox]] infections have been eradicated.<ref name="pmid16989262">{{cite journal |author=Lane JM |title=Mass vaccination and surveillance/containment in the eradication of smallpox |journal=Curr.

[[Image:Aciclovir.svg|left|left|thumb|100px|The guanine analogue [[Aciclovir]]]] 
Over the past twenty years the development of [[antiviral drug]]s has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Antiviral drugs are often [[nucleoside analogues]], (fake DNA building blocks), which are incorporated into the viral DNA during its replication. DNA, and thus virus, replication is then halted because these analogues lack the [[hydroxyl groups]] which along with [[phosphorus]] atoms, link together to form the strong "backbone" of the DNA molecule. This is called DNA [[chain termination]].<ref name="pmid15592828">{{cite journal |author=Magden J, K<U+00E4><U+00E4>ri<U+00E4>inen L, Ahola T |title=Inhibitors of virus replication: recent developments and prospects |journal=Appl.

Other antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle. [[HIV]] is dependent on a proteolytic enzyme called the [[HIV-1 protease]] for it to become fully infectious. There is a class of drugs called [[protease inhibitors]] which have been designed to inactivate the enzyme.

[[Hepatitis C]] is caused by an [[RNA]] virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease is [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] and without treatment they remain [[infectious]] for the rest of their lives.
