'''''Epacris impressa''''', also known as '''common heath''', is a plant of the heath family [[Ericaceae]] that is native to the south-east of [[Australia]]. It generally grows as a small shrub 0.5<U+2013>1 m (1.6<U+2013>3.3&nbsp;ft) high with small stiff leaves. The red, pink or white tube-like flowers appear from late autumn to early spring. Honeyeaters, particularly the [[eastern spinebill]], feed upon the nectar of the flowers. The introduced [[bumblebee]] has been recorded robbing nectar in Tasmania.

A highly regarded garden plant, the common heath has proven a difficult plant to [[Plant propagation|propagate]] reliably, which has limited its use in horticulture and revegetation. It grows best in a well-drained but moist soil in a semishaded position. The pink-flowered form, often referred to as '''pink heath''', is the [[floral emblem]] of the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

==Description==
[[File:Epacris impressa pink 6942.jpg|right|thumb|Habit]]
''Epacris impressa'' grows as a woody shrub with an erect [[Habit (biology)|habit]] and can reach 2 to 3 metres (7<U+2013>10&nbsp;ft) high, although plants in the range of 0.5 to 1 metre tall (1.6<U+2013>3.3&nbsp;ft) are more commonly observed. The branches are stiff and have small leaves with prickly, pointed apices that are {{cvt|8|-|16|mm|in|sigfig=1}} long. The flowers mainly occur between late autumn and early spring, arising in dense and sometimes pendulous clusters along the stems. White, pink or red in colour,
they are 1<U+2013>2&nbsp;cm long (0.8 inch) and are narrow and tubular with five indentations on the base.<ref name=Corrick>{{cite book|author=Corrick, Margaret G.; Fuhrer, Bruce A.| title=Wildflowers of Victoria and Adjoining Areas| publisher=Bloomings Books|location= Melbourne, Victoria | year=2001 | isbn=1876473142|page=73}}</ref><ref name=APNI23924>{{APNI | name = ''Epacris impressa'' var.

The [[type specimen]] of common heath was collected in 1793 by French botanist [[Jacques Labillardi<U+00E8>re]] in [[Van Diemens Land]] (now Tasmania) during a voyage with [[Bruni D'Entrecasteaux]].

He classified plants collected by [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Alan Cunningham]] in the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] as ''E. impressa'' as a separate species ''[[Epacris reclinata|E. reclinata]]''.<ref name="Bentham 1869"/>

In the same work,  Bentham named and described  two naturally-occurring varieties, ''Epacris impressa'' var. ''grandiflora'' and ''E. impressa'' var. ''ovata''.<ref name=StaceI/> Plant specimens designated as ''grandiflora'' had been collected in the [[Wimmera]], the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]] (including those previously designated as ''E. tomentosa'') and at [[Stawell, Victoria|Stawell]] in Victoria.

In his 1972 publication ''A Handbook to Plants in Victoria'', Victorian botanist [[James Hamlyn Willis|Jim Willis]] felt that dividing the species into subspecies was not feasible given that common heath is highly variable in flower colour and leaf shape, though he conceded the Grampians race ''grandiflora'' might be distinctive based on its larger [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]]s and coarser and hairier foliage.<ref name=StaceI/> Currently,  both ''grandiflora'' and ''ovata'' are  regarded as synonyms of ''Epacris impressa'' rather than being classified as distinct varieties.<ref name=APNI23924/><ref name=APNI24101>{{APNI|name=''Epacris impressa'' var. ovata Benth.|id=24101|accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref>  The plant populations that best fit Bentham's original description of ''grandiflora'', also known as Grampians heath, occur naturally on [[sandstone]] at locations including Mount Zero, Mount Stapylton and the [[Black Range State Park|Black Range]].<ref name="Cochrane 1980"/><ref name=RBG/> Other nearby populations are regarded as having intermediate characteristics, including those in the Victoria Range and [[Mount Arapiles]].<ref name=RBG>{{cite web|title=''Epacris impressa''|work=Flora of Victoria Knowledge Base|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne|url=http://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/dbpages/dev/vicflora/index.php/viclist/name/835|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref> Although not recognised in the [[Australian Plant Census]], the variety is noted as "rare" on the list of ''Advisory List of Rare or Threatened Plants in Victoria''

In 1977 Helen Stace and Yvonne Fripp from [[La Trobe University]] studied 195 populations of ''Epacris impressa'' in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, and found that 120 consisted of mixed stands of two or more [[Race (biology)|races]] while 75 populations were of one race only. They identified four races based on the following corolla characteristics:<ref name=StaceI/>

==Distribution==
''Epacris impressa'' is commonly found in coastal regions and nearby foothills in a region extending from [[Kangaroo Island]] and the southern [[Mount Lofty Ranges]] in [[South Australia]] across southern Victoria, extending to the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]] and the [[Little Desert]], and northwards to southern [[New South Wales]] as far as the [[Clyde River, New South Wales|Clyde River]] in the [[Budawang Range]].<ref name=eflorasa>{{cite web|title=''Epacris impressa'' |work=eflorasa|publisher= Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources|url=http://www.flora.sa.gov.au/cgi-bin/speciesfacts_display.cgi?form=speciesfacts&family=&genus=epacris&species=impressa&iname=&submit=Display|accessdate=31 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=NSW/><ref Name=ANBG/> It is also widespread in [[Tasmania]].<ref name=key>{{cite web|title=''Epacris impressa''|work=Key to Tasmanian Vascular Plants|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/dicotkey/dicotkey/EPACRIDS/sEpacris_impressa.htm|publisher=University of Tasmania|accessdate=31 May 2014}}</ref> Plants are recorded at altitudes up to {{convert|1,200|m|ft}} at Mount Stradbroke and Mount Tingaringy in [[East Gippsland]].<ref name="Cochrane 1980">{{cite book|author=Cochrane, G.R.; Fuhrer, B.A.; Rotherdam, E.M.; Simmons, J.& M.; Willis, J.H.| title=Flowers and Plants of Victoria and Tasmania |publisher=A.H. & A.W.

[[File:Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris female.jpg|left|thumb|Eastern spinebill on ''Epacris impressa'',  [[Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens]]]]
[[Honeyeater]]s, such as the [[eastern spinebill]], are attracted to the flowers in their native habitat.

Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells.<ref name=EJ84/> As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard [[pruning]] after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth afterwards.

[[Plant propagation|Propagation]] both by seed and cuttings is difficult, reducing potential production by plant nurseries.
