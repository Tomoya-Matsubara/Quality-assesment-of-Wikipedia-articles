==EA Sports controversy==
UFC president [[Dana White]] has declared himself "at war" with [[EA]] over the development of the [[EA Sports MMA]] video game. White assumed that he initially wanted EA to develop ''UFC 2009 Undisputed'' and remarks "EA Sports told us, 'You're not a real sport. We wouldn't touch this thing. We want nothing to do with this.'" "We put our asses on the line, THQ and the UFC, to make a video-game deal in the worst economy in the world," White told reporters recently. "We go out there and do this thing, and it's successful, and now god-damn EA Sports wants to do a video game.<ref>http://mmajunkie.com/news/15490/ufc-president-dana-white-says-ea-sports-responsible-for-current-mma-video-game-war.mma</ref> 

White warned the fighters who intend to be included in the upcoming EA Sports MMA game release, claiming that "If you do business with EA, you won't be in the UFC." Former [[UFC Heavyweight Championship|UFC heavyweight champion]]s [[Tim Sylvia]]<ref name="gamasutra.com">http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24141"</ref> and [[Andrei Arlovski]], as well as still under contract [[Frank Trigg]] (who has now been released from his UFC Contract following his loss to [[Matt Serra]] <ref name="mmajunkie.com">http://mmajunkie.com/news/15059/ea-sports-to-release-mma-videogame-ea-sports-mma-in-2010.mma/</ref>) and [[Vladimir Matyushenko]]<ref>http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab285/nonstopjc/004.jpg</ref>  confirmed their presence in the EA Sports MMA video game. Fan favorite [[Randy Couture]] was under contract with UFC before agreeing to be a part of EA Sports MMA, but is able to take part in the game due to never signing over his likeness to the UFC for use in video games.

==Reception==
The game has been met with overall positive reviews. Numerous video game websites have awarded the game with high praise for its various improvements over last year's version. 

Dakota Grabowski of GameZone.com gave the game a 9/10. His final verdict was "All in all, UFC Undisputed 2010 is a force to be reckoned with." THQ has put every other fighting game on notice as UFC Undisputed 2010 has moved into the domain of one of the best games in the genre."<ref>http://ps3.gamezone.com/reviews/item/ufc_undisputed_2010_review/</ref>

Additionally, [[GamePro|GamePro.com]]'s Caleb Newby awarded the game five out of five stars, calling it "an intensely satisfying experience."<ref>http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/215203/ufc-undisputed-2010/</ref> [[GameTrailers|GameTrailers.com]] gave it a 9.0 out of 10 stating that it one of the most technically accomplished and brutally satisfying video game entries to date.
<ref>http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-ufc-undisputed/100541</ref>

However, IGN.com gave the game a score of 7.8. Reviewer Greg Miller stated that while the game is good, its little issues hold it back from being impressive.  <ref>http://xbox360.ign.com/objects/022/022736.html</ref>.

Gamespot.com gave the game a 8.0 out of 10 stating that the game's strong point is the core game-play, while the menu heavy career mode can prove to be a bit tedious. Though the reviewer later states that even though the career mode is flawed, it is still capable of keeping you engaged in your character's career.

The Australian video game talk show ''[[Good Game]]'''s two reviewers gave the game a 8/10 and 8.5/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2920412.htm |title=Good Game stories - UFC Undisputed 2010| publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date=2010-06-07}}</ref>
