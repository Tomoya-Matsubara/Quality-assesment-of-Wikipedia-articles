The '''Voluntary Human Extinction Movement''' ('''VHEMT'''{{cref2|A}}) is an [[environmental movement]] that calls for all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary [[Human extinction|extinction of mankind]]. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because it would prevent [[environmental degradation]]. The group states that a decrease in the human population would prevent a significant amount of man-made human suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.

VHEMT was founded in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an activist who became involved in the environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's [[biosphere]] and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesperson. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, because of the human reproductive drive mankind will never voluntarily seek extinction.

==History==
The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement was founded by Les U. Knight, a resident of [[Portland, Oregon]],<ref name=te/> who was raised in a large family.<ref name=sfc/> After becoming involved in the environmental movement as a college student in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human [[overpopulation]]. After coming to this conclusion, he joined the [[Zero Population Growth]] organization<ref name=te/> and chose to get a [[vasectomy]] at age 25.<ref name=sfc>{{cite news|last=Dicum|first=Gregory|title=Maybe None|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2005/11/16/gree.DTL|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 16, 2005}}</ref> He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems.<ref name=te>{{cite news|title=Sui genocide|url=http://www.economist.com/node/179963|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Economist|date=December 17, 1998}}</ref> He believes that this idea has been held to by some people throughout human history.<ref name=o142>Ormrod 2011, p. 142</ref>

In 1991, Knight began publishing VHEMT's newsletter,<ref name=te/> known as ''These Exit Times''.<ref name=ti/> In the newsletter, he asked readers not to procreate to further human extinction.<ref name=te/> VHEMT has also published cartoons,<ref name=ta>{{cite news|title=Sites answer 300 million questions|url=http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061022/NEWS/610220322/1016/FEATURES07|accessdate=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Barre Montpelier Times Argus|date=October 22, 2006}}</ref> including a comic strip titled "Bonobo Baby", featuring a woman who forgoes childbearing in favor of adopting a [[bonobo]].<ref name=ti>{{cite news|last=Jarvis|first=Stephen|title=Live long and die out: Stephen Jarvis encounters the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/live-long-and-die-out-stephen-jarvis-encounters-the-voluntary-human-extinction-movement-1372200.html|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=April 24, 1994}}</ref> In 1996, Knight created a website for VHEMT;<ref name=o143/> it was available in 11 languages by 2010.<ref name=w310>Weisman 2010, p. 310</ref> VHEMT's logo features the letter "V" (for Voluntary) and an inverted Earth.<ref name=vhemtlogo/>{{cref2|B}}

==Organization and promotion==
VHEMT functions as a loose network rather than a formal organization,<ref name=o1423>Ormrod 2011, pp. 142<U+2013>3</ref> and does not compile a list of members. Daniel Metz of [[Willamette University]] stated in 1995 that VHEMT's mailing list had just under 400 subscribers.<ref name=te/> Six years later, the [[Fox News Channel]] claimed the list had only 230 subscribers.<ref name=fox/> Knight states that anyone who agrees with his ideology is a member of the movement;<ref name=te/> he claims that this includes "millions of people".<ref name=aboutvhemt>

Knight serves as the spokesperson for VHEMT.<ref name=te/> He attends environmental conferences and events, where he publicizes information about population growth.<ref name=w310/> VHEMT's message has, however, primarily been spread through coverage by media outlets, rather than events and its newsletter.<ref name=o143>Ormrod 2011, p. 143</ref> VHEMT sells buttons and T-shirts,<ref name=o143/> as well as [[bumper sticker]]s that say "Thank you for not breeding".<ref name=ti/>

==Ideology==
Knight argues that the [[human population]] is far greater than the Earth can handle, and that allowing humans to die out is the best thing that can be done for Earth's biosphere.<ref name="CNN Technology"/> This is due to his belief that humans are "incompatible with the biosphere",<ref name=ti/> and that human existence is solely self-serving, lacking any ecological benefit.<ref name=cbc/> He argues that the vast majority of human societies have not lived [[Sustainable living|sustainable lifestyles]],<ref name=sfc/> and that attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not change the fact that human existence is harmful to the Earth.<ref name=ti/> Human extinction is promoted on the grounds that it will prevent human suffering and the [[Extinction#Modern_extinctions|extinction of other species]]; Knight points out that many species are threatened by the rise of the human population.<ref name=te/><ref name=fox>{{cite news|title=Anti-People Group Pushes for Man's Extinction|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110429112341/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,30834,00.html|accessdate=February 19, 2012|newspaper=Foxnews.com|date=July 29, 2001}}</ref><ref name="CNN Technology"/>

James Ormrod, a psychologist who profiled the group in the journal ''Psychoanalysis, Culture & Society'', claims that the "most fundamental belief" of VHEMT is that "human beings should stop reproducing", and that some people consider themselves members of the group but do not actually support human extinction.<ref name=o143/> Knight, however, believes that even if humans become more environmentally friendly, they could still return to environmentally destructive lifestyles and hence should be eliminated.<ref name=sfc/> Residents of [[First World]] countries bear the most responsibility to change, according to Knight, as they consume a large proportion of resources.<ref name=og/>

Knight believes that animal species are more important than human accomplishments, such as art. He argues that species which are higher on the [[food chain]] are less important than lower species, and that humans are therefore not very valuable to the planet.<ref name=ti/> His ideology is drawn in part from [[deep ecology]], and he sometimes refers to the Earth as [[Gaianism|Gaia]].<ref name=o158>Ormrod 2011, p. 158</ref> He notes that human extinction is unavoidable, and that it is better to become extinct soon to avoid concomitant extinctions.<ref name="CNN Technology">

VHEMT members who strongly believed that "Civilization [is] headed for collapse" were most likely to embrace these views.<ref name=e267>Ellis 1998, p. 267</ref> However, VHEMT does not take any overt political stances.<ref name=o143/>

VHEMT promotes a more extreme ideology than [[Population Action International]], a group that argues humanity should reduce<U+2014>but not eliminate<U+2014>its population to care for the Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the [[Church of Euthanasia]], which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism.<ref name=fox/><ref name=maclean/> The 1995 survey found that thirty six percent considered themselves members of [[Earth First!]] or had donated to the group in the previous five years.<ref name=e382>Ellis 1998, p. 382&ndash;3</ref>

==Reception==
Knight states his group's ideology runs counter to contemporary society's [[natalism]]. He believes this pressure has stopped many people from supporting, or even discussing, population control.<ref name=sfc/> He admits that his group is unlikely to succeed, but contends that attempting to reduce the Earth's population is the only moral option.<ref name=ti/>

Reception of Knight's idea in the mainstream media has been mixed. Writing in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Gregory Dicum states that there is an "undeniable logic" to VHEMT's arguments, but he doubts whether Knight's ideas can succeed, arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded.<ref name=sfc/> Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in ''[[The Independent]]'', noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the human reproductive drive.<ref name=ti/> In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Guy Dammann applauds the movement's aim as "in many ways laudable", but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction.<ref name=gd>{{cite news|last=Dammann|first=Guy|title=Am I fit to breed?|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/28/children-parents|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=December 28, 2008}}</ref> In the same paper, Abby O'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success, VHEMT's goal is difficult to attain.<ref name=tg02>{{cite news|last=O'Reilly|first=Abby|title=No more babies, please|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/24/nomorebabiesplease|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=November 24, 2007}}</ref> Knight contends in response to these arguments that though sexual desire is natural, human desire for children is a product of [[enculturation]].<ref name=ti/>

The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]] has criticized Knight's platform, arguing that the existence of humanity is divinely ordained.<ref name=fox/> Ormrod claims that Knight "arguably abandons deep ecology in favour of straightforward misanthropy". He notes that Knight's claim that the last humans in an extinction scenario would have an abundance of resources promotes his cause based on "benefits accruing to humans". Ormrod sees this type of argument as counter-intuitive, arguing that it borrows the language of "late-modern consumer societies". He faults Knight for what he sees as a failure to develop a consistent and unambiguous ideology.<ref name=o158/> ''[[The Economist]]'' characterizes Knight's claim that voluntary human extinction is advisable due to limited resources as "Malthusian bosh". The paper further states that compassion for the planet does not necessarily require the pursuit of human extinction.<ref name=te/> [[Frank Furedi]] also deems VHEMT to be a [[Malthusian]] group, classifying them as a type of environmental organization that "[thinks] the worst about the human species".<ref name=spike>{{cite news|last=Furedi|first=Frank|title=Environmentalism|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/3817|accessdate=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Spiked|date=September 12, 2007}}</ref> Writing in ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', Josie Appleton argues that the group is indifferent to humanity, rather than "anti-human".<ref name=spiked1/>

Brian Bethune writes in ''[[Maclean's]]'' that Knight's logic is "as absurd as it's unassailable". However, he doubts Knight's claim that the last survivors of the human race would have pleasant lives and suspects that a "collective loss of the will to live" would prevail.<ref name=maclean/> In response to Knight's platform, journalist [[Sheldon Richman]] argues that humans are "active agents" and can change their behavior. He contends that people are capable of solving the problems facing Earth.<ref name="CNN Technology"/> [[Alan Weisman]], author of ''[[The World Without Us]]'', suggests a limit of one child per family as a preferable alternative to abstinence from reproduction.<ref name=maclean/>

[[Katharine Mieszkowski]] of [[Salon.com]] recommends that childless people adopt VHEMT's arguments when facing "probing questions" about their childlessness.<ref name=sdc>{{cite news|last=Mieszkowski|first=Katharine|title=No need to breed?|url=http://www.salon.com/2005/11/16/human_extinction/singleton/|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=Salon.com|date=November 16, 2005}}</ref> Writing in the ''Journal for Critical Animal Studies'', Carmen Dell'Aversano notes that VHEMT seeks to renounce children as a symbol of perpetual human progress. She casts the movement as a form of "queer oppositional politics" because it rejects perpetual reproduction as a form of motivation. She argues that the movement seeks to come to a new definition of "civil order", as [[Lee Edelman]] suggested that [[queer theory]] should. Dell'Aversano believes that VHEMT fulfills Edelman's mandate because they embody the [[death drive]] rather than ideas that focus on the reproduction of the past.<ref name=da>

Although Knight's organization has been featured in a book titled ''[[Donna Kossy#Kooks (1994)|Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief]]'',<ref name=te/> [[Oliver Burkeman]] from ''The Guardian'' notes that in a phone conversation Knight is "rather sane and self-deprecating".<ref name=tg>{{cite news|last=Burkeman|first=Oliver|title=Climate change: calling planet birth|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/13/climate-change-family-size-babies|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 12, 2010}}</ref> Weisman echoes this sentiment, characterizing Knight as "thoughtful, soft-spoken, articulate, and quite serious".<ref name=spiked1>{{cite news|last=Appleton|first=Josie|title=Unleashing nature<U+2019>s terror|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/reviewofbooks_printable/3628/|accessdate=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Spiked|date=July 20, 2007}}</ref> Philosophers [[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] view VHEMT's stance as extreme, but they note that the movement formed in response to extreme stances found in "modern humanism".<ref name=bk269>Best & Kellner 2001, p. 268<U+2013>9</ref>
