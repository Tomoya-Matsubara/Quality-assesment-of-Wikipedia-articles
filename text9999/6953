As a player he was a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] from 1986 until 2012, however since 1999 he had mixed his playing duties with various coaching and management positions. He notably played in the [[Premier League]] for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], and in the [[Football League]] for [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]], [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]].
