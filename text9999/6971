The '''Olympic Stadium''' in [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[London]], England was the centrepiece of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the last stop in the [[2012 Summer Olympics torch relay|2012 Olympics torch relay]], and the venue of the athletic events as well as the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing]] ceremonies. It was the central venue of the  [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].

It is located at Marshgate Lane in London's Stratford district in the [[Lower Lea Valley]]. The stadium has a capacity of 80,000, making it the third-largest stadium in England behind [[Wembley Stadium]] and [[Twickenham Stadium]].

Land preparation for the stadium began in mid-2007, with the official construction start date on 22 May 2008, although piling works for the foundation unofficially began four weeks ahead of that date. The stadium will also host the [[2017 World Championships in Athletics]].

==Development==
On 13 October 2009, [[LOCOG]] confirmed that it had selected the Team Stadium consortium (consisting of [[Sir Robert McAlpine]]; HOK Sport + Venue + Event, now known as Populous; and [[Buro Happold]]) to start negotiations with, in hope to find the contractor fulfilling the eventual design and build contract of the new Olympic Stadium.<ref>[http://www.london2012.com/en/news/archive/2006/October/2006-10-13-15-34.htm "Negotiations Start with Arsenal Stadium Team"]. London 2013 Official Website. Retrieved 19 December 2007.</ref>

The ODA received international and national interest to prequalify for the design and construction tender but Team Stadium was the only consortium to meet all prequalification criteria. The consortium was also the team who delivered the locally acclaimed new [[Emirates Stadium]], home of [[Arsenal F.C.]] team stadium members have extensive experience in the design and build of sports venues, including the [[Stadium Australia|Olympic Stadium]] for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Games]].

On 11 October 2011, Britain's Olympics minister [[Hugh Robertson (politician)|Hugh Robertson]] confirmed the collapse of the Olympic Park Legacy Company's (ORTO) agreement with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] to take over the stadium after the games. The OPLC announced that negotiations with West Ham, unveiled as the preferred stadium bidder in February 2011, had ended because of growing concerns over delays caused by the ongoing legal dispute with rival club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. West Ham had not signed any contracts, allowing the OPLC to abandon talks with the club. The stadium, which cost an estimated <U+00A3>486 million, will now remain in public ownership and leased out to an anchor tenant following a new tender process.<ref>[http://aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=38130 Olympic Stadium Legacy Deal Collapses; UK Athletics Says Boost for London 2017 Bid] ''Around the Rings Website''.

==Structures and facilities==
[[File:Olympic Stadium London design.jpg|thumb|right|[[Exploded view drawing|Exploded view]] of the stadium's layers]]
The stadium design was launched on 7 November 2007. The architect, [[Populous (company)|Populous]], is an architectural firm specialising in the design of sports facilities and convention centres, as well as planning of major special events.<ref>{{cite web|author=Administrator |url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/london/london_olympic_stadium.htm |title=London Olympic Stadium, Building, Photos, Architect, London Olympics Stadium Building |publisher=E-architect.co.uk |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> Construction took four years from 2007 to 2011.

The stadium's track and field arena is excavated out of the soft clay found on the site, around which is permanent seating for 25,000, built using concrete "rakers". The natural slope of the land is incorporated into the design, with warm-up and changing areas dug into a semi-basement position at the lower end. Spectators enter the stadium via a podium level, which is level with the top of the permanent seating bowl. A demountable lightweight steel and concrete upper tier is built up from this "bowl" to accommodate a further 55,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.building.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=583&storycode=3121620&c=0 | title=On Your Marks: Countdown to 2012, London's Olympic Stadium | work=[[Building (magazine)|Building]] | date=5 September 2008 | accessdate=19 October 2008 | author=Spring, Martin}}</ref>

[[File:London Olympic Stadium Interior - April 2012.jpg|thumb|The Olympic Stadium interior]]
The stadium is made up of different tiers; during the games the stadium was able to hold 80,000 spectators. The base tier, which will be permanent and allow for 25,000 seats, is a sunken elliptical bowl that is made up of  low-carbon-dioxide concrete; this contains 40 percent less embodied carbon than conventional concrete.<ref name="Olympic Stadium">{{cite web|title=Olympic Stadium 2012|url=http://www.london2012.com/olympic-stadium|publisher=London Olympic Stadium}}</ref> The foundation of the base level is 5,000 piles reaching up to 20 metres deep. From there, there is a mixture of driven cast ''[[in situ]]'' piles, continuous flight auger piles, and vibro concrete columns. The second tier, which holds 55,000 seats, is 315 metres long, 256 metres wide, and 60 metres high.<ref name=ICE>{{cite web|title=PVC at Olympics destined for reuse or recycling|url=http://www.wasterecyclingnews.com/article/20120801/NEWS02/120809998/pvc-at-olympics-destined-for-reuse-or-recycling|publisher=waste recycling news|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref> The stadium is built using nearly four times less steel, approximately 10,700 tons, in the structure than that of the Olympic Stadium in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics. In addition to the minimal use of steel, which makes it 75 percent lighter, the stadium also uses high-yield large diameter pipes which were surplus on completion of [[North Sea Gas]] pipeline projects, recycled [[granite]], and many of the building products were transported using trains and barges rather than by lorry.<ref name=eco-friendly>{{cite web|last=Radnedge|first=Aidan|title=Why Plymouth Argyle and Dartford FC Are Top of Eco-Friendly League Table|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/newsfocus/882601-why-plymouth-argyle-and-dartford-fc-are-top-of-eco-friendly-league-table|work= [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref>

===Exterior wrap===
[[File:Olympic Stadium (London) illuminated, 3 August 2012.jpg|thumb|right|The Olympic Stadium during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]]]
Plastic, or an environmentally sustainable fabric such as [[hemp]], was initially designed to be wrapped around the stadium exterior and imprinted with a mural-type design. The wrap would have been {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} high and would have encircled the {{convert|900|m|yd|-2|adj=on|abbr=off}} circumference of the stadium. Both hemp and the continuous wrapping were ruled out. The final design for the wrap consists of 2.5&nbsp;m-wide fabric panels, twisted at 90-degree angles to allow entry to the stadium at the bottom of the structure, and held in place with tensioned cables.<ref>{{registration required|date=July 2012}} {{cite web|last=Olcayto |first=Rory |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3114827 |title=Olympic Stadium's Latest Design Unveiled |publisher=Bdonline.co.uk |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> It has been reported in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that a member of the stadium-design team, Rod Sheard, would have preferred the wrap to take the form of a continuous video screen, although no costing for this was ever given.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/23/olympics2012.olympics2008 |title= Wrap Around Video Screen Proposed for London Stadium |accessdate=19 October 2008 |work= [[The Guardian]]  | first=Robert | last=Booth | date=23 August 2008}}</ref> On 4 August 2011, it was announced that [[Dow Chemical Company]] would fund the wrap for the stadium, in return for being able to advertise on the wrap until 26 June 2012, at which point all advertising and logos would be removed as per Olympic requirements. The wrap is made from [[polyester]] and [[polyethylene]], is printed using UV curable inks and encircles the stadium. Installation of the wrap began on 14 April 2012.<ref name=Dowwrap>{{registration required|date=July 2012}} {{cite news|last=Kortekaas|first=Vanessa|date = 4 August 2011 | title=Dow Chemical Wraps Up Olympic Deal|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9c96fbba-be02-11e0-ab9f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1U4lqy9Lc|accessdate=4 August 2011| work = [[Financial Times]]}}</ref>

===Roof===
[[File:cmglee RIBA model Olympic Stadium.jpg|thumb|Architectural model of a section of the stadium showing how the roof is suspended from the truss ring.]]
To allow for fast on-site assembly, compression truss and roof column connections were bolted; this will also enable easy disassembling of the roof structure after the closing ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Delivering London 2012: the Olympic Stadium|url=http://dxdoi.org/10.1680/cien.2011.164.6.37|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineering|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> The cable-supported roof structure covers approximately two thirds of the stadium's seating.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/7081346.stm|title=London Unveils 2012 Stadium Plan |accessdate=5 August 2008 | publisher = BBC News | date=7 November 2007}}</ref> A six-month study conducted by Olympic organisers found that while no roof at all could invalidate any potential world records set at the stadium, a partial roof reduced the chance of winds that can invalidate sprint and jump records from fifty percent to five percent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The roof is made from a [[phthalate]]-free [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) fabric to keep costs down.

Serge Ferrari, a French manufacturer of tarpaulins was selected to supply PVC fabrics which are reused and recycled after the use and demodulation of the temporary venues. The material will potentially be reused in football stadiums in Brazil for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Others will be recycled with the PVC Recycling process [[Vinyloop]].

Dan Epstein Head of Sustainable Development at [[Olympic Delivery Authority]] (ODA) says <blockquote style="font-style: italic">''As we have done in the past with materials such as timber and concrete, we want to use the opportunity of hosting the London 2012 Games to work with industry to set new standards. In this case this may help move the industry towards more sustainable manufacture, use and disposal of PVC fabrics.'' <ref>{{cite web|title=London 2012 seeks sustainable solutions for temporary venues|url=http://www.london2012.com/news/articles/2009/5/london-2012-seeks-sustainable-solutions-for-temporary-ve-1243087.html|publisher=ODA|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

===Stadium island===
[[File:Olympic Stadium October 2009 SM.jpg|thumb|The Olympic Stadium site under construction in October 2009]]
The stadium site is on former industrial land between the [[River Lee (England)|River Lea]] (which rejoins the [[Lee Navigation|Navigation]] below [[Old Ford Lock]]), the [[City Mill River]], and the Old Pudding Mill River; parts of the [[Bow Back Rivers]]. Another branch of this system, St Thomas' Creek, {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=off}} to the south, completes an "island" surrounded by water. Two hundred metres to the east is the [[Waterworks River]]; with the [[London Aquatics Centre]] on its eastern bank. This "island" site for the stadium lies at the southern end of the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]]. The existing waterways were modified to surround the stadium, and access is via several footbridges positioned around the building's perimeter. The stadium island is at the most western point of Newham. Bow, Tower Hamlets is directly located west of the stadium.

The stadium has been built on the site of the northern corner of Marshgate Lane and Knobs Hill Road, Stratford, London E15. The Knobs Hill Road trading estate was one of the industrial areas demolished to make way for the Olympic Park. The stadium occupies the northern part of the former estate.
Knobs Hill Road was probably named to commemorate Knobs Hill Cottage, Marshgate Lane, Stratford, which stood from the 19th century until the inter war period (1919<U+2013>1939). According to the 1886 Stratford Trade Directory, it belonged to Mr George Stroud. His occupation was listed as <U+201C>pig dealer<U+201D>. The cottage is named on the contemporary Essex, Middlesex and London 1:2500 and one inch Ordnance Survey maps. The cottage appears to be associated with the Knobs Hill flour mill, which stood at the northern end of the Pudding Mill River. The first mill on the site was Nobshill Windmill, in the Manor of West Ham. The cottage site appears to be within the stadium boundary, the mills stood slightly to the northeast.

Olympic Stadium's grandstands contain a lighting system developed by [[Tait Technologies]] that allows them to function as a giant video screen.  Individual "paddles" containing nine [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] pixels each were installed between each seat of the stadium, which can be controlled via a central system to display video content wrapped across the stadium. The system was primarily intended for use during the ceremonies of the Olympics and Paralympics; where they were used to display over 70 minutes of animated content during the Olympics' opening ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|title=The lights fantastic: How Danny Boyle used 'paddles' with tiny bulbs to turn Olympics audience into a giant video screen|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2181447/Olympic-magic-revealed-The-tiny-paddle-Danny-Boyle-used-turn-opening-ceremony-audience-giant-video-screen.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>

The stadium is equipped with a nine lane Mondo 400 metres athletics track. It also has a 60 metre indoor sprint track and will have space for lectures, offices, commercial, conference and hospitality. It is also seen by the London Legacy Development corporation that the stadium will host tours, concerts and art and culture events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonlegacy.co.uk/investment-and-venues/venues-and-infrastructure/the-stadium/ |title=The Stadium &#124; London Legacy Development Corporation |publisher=Londonlegacy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>

==Response==
The stadium design received a mixed response from the media, with reviews ranging from "magnificent" to a "bowl of [[blancmange]]".<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/London-Olympic-stadium-divides-opinion/2007/11/08/1194329412685.html London Olympic Stadium Divides Opinion"]. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''. Retrieved 12 December 2007.</ref> The design was promoted as example of "sustainable development", but some architecture critics have questioned both its aesthetic value and suitability as a national icon&nbsp;<U+2013> especially when compared to [[Beijing National Stadium]]. For example, Ellis Woodman, ''[[Building Design]]''s architecture critic, said of the design: "The principle of it being dismountable is most welcome... it demonstrates an obvious interest in establishing an economy of means and as such is the antithesis of the 2008 Olympic stadium in Beijing. But while that's an achievement, it's not an architectural achievement. In design terms what we're looking at is pretty underwhelming." He went on to criticise the procurement and design processes&nbsp;<U+2013> stating of the latter that it should have been subject to an architectural competition.<ref>[http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3099433 HOK's 2012 "Olympic Stadium Design Revealed&nbsp;<U+2013> Images and Slideshow]. ''[[Building Design]]''. Retrieved 12 December 2007.</ref> This view was echoed by Tom Dyckhoff, ''[[The Times]]'''s architecture critic, who described the design as "tragically underwhelming" and commented that the "architecture of the 2008 and 2012 Olympics will, in years to come, be seen by historians as a "cunning indicator of the decline of the West and the rise of the East".<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/architecture_and_design/article2824547.ece "Olympic Stadium Is Deflated Architecture at an Inflated Price"].  ''[[The Times]]''. Retrieved 12 December 2007.</ref>
Despite the criticism the Olympic Stadium has been nominated for the 2012 [[Stirling Prize]] in architecture.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vanessa Thorpe |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/jul/22/olympic-stadium-shortlisted-for-architecture-prize |title=Olympic Stadium is in the running for Stirling prize gold &#124; Art and design &#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>

Amanda Baillieu writing in ''Building Design'' challenged the designer's claims that the stadium is environmentally sustainable and good value for money. Instead, it is asserted that the reality will be the opposite. In particular, she claimed that:
* the temporary roof could not be reused to cover the permanent 25,000 seating area&nbsp;<U+2013> given the difference in size;
* it is unlikely that the removed seating would be wanted for any other event e.g. the [[Commonwealth Games 2014|Glasgow Commonwealth games]]; and
* the costs involved in dismantling the stadium&nbsp;<U+2013> and surrounding "pods"&nbsp;<U+2013> has not been factored into the estimated cost.<ref>[http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?setioncode=427&storycode=3099593&featurecode=12091&c=1 "Stadium Disappoints All Round"].

==Post-Olympics==
On 12 November 2010, it was announced that two bids had been shortlisted for the stadium post-Olympics. They are a joint bid from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]] and [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG), with the second bid from [[West Ham United F.C.]] and [[Newham Council]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11746496 | publisher = BBC News | title=Tottenham and West Ham Lead London 2012 Stadium Bid | date=12 November 2010}}</ref> The former bid would maintain the 80,000 capacity, while the latter would reduce it to 60,000.

===Bids===
;Bid 1: AEG & Tottenham Hotspur
[[File:AEG & Tottenham Hotspur Olympic Stadium.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of the proposed new stadium by [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]]]
These joint bidders had originally expressed individual interest in the venue but submitted a joint bid to take over. AEG is the company that redeveloped the loss making [[Millennium Dome]] exhibition venue in South East London into the profitable music venue [[The O2 (London)|The O2]]. When the formal bidding process opened, little was known of AEG's plans for the stadium, but they were described as among the front-runners of interested parties, along with West Ham.<ref name=SkyNews8Aug2010HopefulsEnterNextRound/> On 26 July 2010, it was rumoured that Tottenham might be interested in taking over the stadium post-Games. The club have plans to build a new stadium adjacent to their current home, but the capacity could not reach that of the Olympic Stadium, making a move attractive to the club.

;Bid 2: West Ham United and Newham Council

Following the 2010 takeover by [[David Gold (businessman)|David Gold]] and [[David Sullivan (publisher)|David Sullivan]], the new owners of West Ham United expressed their desire to make the stadium as the club's new home. With [[Boris Johnson]] expressing his desire for a football team to take over the stadium after the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics this seemed the most likely option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/19012010/58/premier-league-gold-sullivan-west-ham.html|title=Gold and Sullivan Take Over West Ham | accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> At the opening of the formal bid process, West Ham United were considered favourites once they reversed from their initial opposition to keeping the running track as well as planning a <U+00A3>100m conversion to create a 60,000 capacity venue, which would also host international football, international athletics, as well as [[Essex County Cricket Club]], international [[Twenty20]] cricket matches, [[National Football League|NFL]] games and [[Live Nation]] events.<ref name=BBC18Aug2010WestHamOptimism>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/8905127.stm|title=West Ham's Grounds for Optimism over Olympic Stadium |publisher= [[BBC Sport]] |date=18 August 2010|accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref>

;Originally expressed interest

The legacy plan for the stadium originally involved its conversion into a 25,000- to 30,000-seat athletics stadium with a sports training, science and medicine centre following the 2012 Paralympics. Media reports, however, have suggested that several potential tenants were interested in moving to the stadium after the games, among them the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]], along with several London cricket, football and rugby clubs:

*[[England and Wales Cricket Board]], [[Kent County Cricket Club]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/6488406/Cricket-would-be-a-bad-fit-for-post-London-2012-Olympic-stadium.html | work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | first=Derek | last=Pringle | title=Cricket Would Be a Bad Fit for Post-London 2012 Olympic Stadium | date=3 November 2009}}</ref> [[Middlesex County Cricket Club]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/current/story/430736.html |title=London's Olympic Stadium a Potential T20 Venue |publisher=ESPNcricinfo  |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> [[Essex County Cricket Club]]:<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/essex/8620449.stm | publisher = BBC News | title=Essex Ponder Olympic Stadium Use | date=15 April 2010 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> The oval shape of the stadium is ideal for cricket, and the stadium's projected capacity post-Olympics is considerably higher than other comparable cricket venues.

*[[English 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid]]: London United, the body responsible for identifying which football stadia in London should be incorporated into a World Cup bid, had expressed serious interest in also using the stadium as a football venue.<ref>{{cite news|last=Herman |first=Martyn |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE5AD0WE20091114 |title=2012 Stadium Considered as 2018 Soccer World Cup Venue |publisher = Reuters |date= 14 November 2009|accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref>

*[[London Skolars|London Skolars R.L.F.C.]]: [[Rugby League]] [[Rugby League National Championship 1|Championship One]] side London Skolars have also expressed an interest to move into the stadium following the Olympics. This would form the basis of a [[Super League]] licence application, however no official moves have been made as of yet.

*The [[National Football League]] of [[American football]] had been looking at the potential of a franchise in London, and the stadium has been seen as a potential home venue.<ref name=nfl>{{cite news|title=Olympic Stadium's grand designs post-2012 ... before West Ham emerged as bid winners|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/8315611/Olympic-Stadiums-grand-designs-post-2012-...-before-West-Ham-emerged-as-bid-winners.html|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=www.dailytelegraph.co.uk|date=10 February 2011}}</ref> The as-built Olympic Stadium would easily meet the league's requirements for [[seating capacity]], and would have no trouble accommodating an American football field, which is about 5 metres longer than a FIFA-standard [[association football]] pitch but nearly 20 metres narrower. Having such a tenant has been seen as one of the ways that the stadium could make maximum surplus after the games, due to interest shown in the [[NFL International Series|International series]] played in London.

*[[Leyton Orient F.C.]]: The closest club geographically, Leyton Orient announced in November 2007 that they were in negotiations regarding permanent tenancy after the games.<ref name="bbc1">{{cite news | title = Hammers' Olympic Move Ruled Out |publisher= BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/6320267.stm | accessdate =7 February 2007  | date=7 February 2007}}</ref> This would allow for redevelopment of their existing [[Brisbane Road]] stadium and provide a regular use for the Olympic and Paralympic venue.

*[[Major League Baseball]]: Clive Russell of [[MLB International]] confirmed that stadium was under consideration as a possible venue for MLB games in Europe. Although the stadium's sight lines are a potential issue, MLB has measured the stadium and confirmed it is a suitable size for a baseball game.<ref name="si.com">{{cite news | title = MLB Eyeing London's Olympic Stadium for Games | work = [[Sports Illustrated]] | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/baseball/mlb/03/28/mlb.europe.ap/index.html?sct=mlb_t2_a11 | accessdate =30 March 2012 | date=28 March 2011}}</ref>

Despite several rounds of negotiations with potential tenants, [[LOCOG]] has elected to adhere to its bid commitment to provide a legacy for athletics at the stadium, with capacity reduced to a more financially viable 25,000. However, the newly elected Mayor of London, [[Boris Johnson]], has stated that all parties need to look carefully at the legacy plans for the stadium and has not ruled out use by either a professional football or rugby team. This in mind, the contract for building the stadium clearly stated that it must stay as a usable athletics track available for competition and training at any time.

After receiving and pre-screening over 100 expressions of interest, the formal bidding process of selecting the post-Olympics user of the stadium opened on 18 August 2010. It was to run until 30 September, after which the OPLC would draw up a shortlist, with a view to selecting a tenant by the end of the financial year, by 31 March. The winning bidder is required to support the regeneration of the area, and retain the stadium as a "distinctive physical symbol".<ref name=SkyNews8Aug2010HopefulsEnterNextRound>{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Business/Olympic-Stadium-Bidding-Process-Begins-For-London-Games-Arena-West-Ham-And-AEG-Frontrunners/Article/201008315695208?lpos=Business_First_Buisness_Article_Teaser_Region_0&lid=ARTICLE_15695208_Olympic_Stadium_Bidding_Process_Begins_For_London_Games_Arena%3A_West_Ham_And_AEG_Frontrunners|title=Olympic Stadium Hopefuls Enter Next Round |publisher= [[Sky News]] |date=18 August 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=BBC18Aug2010BiddingBegins>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11005965 |title=London 2012 Olympic Games Stadium Bidding Begins |publisher= BBC News |date=18 August 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref>

===Decision===
On 11 February 2011, the OPLC selected [[West Ham United]] & [[Newham Council]] as the preferred bidder to take over the stadium after the 2012 Games. The decision in favour of West Ham's bid was unanimous.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12424549 |title= West Ham Chosen as Preferred Olympic Stadium Tenant |publisher= BBC News |date= 11 February 2011|accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref> However, [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] complained that the stadium is too close to their ground and would breach FA rules.

===Judicial review and independent investigation===
Tottenham Hotspur F.C. and Leyton Orient applied for a judicial review to overturn the OPLC's decision; however, this appeal was rejected in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirk|first=Tristan| date = 25 June 2011 | title=Spurs Judicial Review Bid over Olympic Stadium Rejected by Judge|url=http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/topstories/9104745.Spurs__Olympic_Stadium_challenge_rejected_by_judge/|work=Haringey Independent|accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref> Tottenham Hotspur then appealed the decision not to have a review on 29 June 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/13964363.stm | publisher = BBC News | title=Spurs Lodge Fresh Stadium Appeal | date=29 June 2011}}</ref>

The Olympic Legacy Company announced on 5 July 2011 that an independent review into the awarding of the Olympic Park Stadium to [[West Ham United]] was to be carried out following the discovery on 30 June 2011 that an employee, Dionne Knight had been engaged by West Ham United to carry out consultancy work relating to the stadium without permission of the OPLC. Knight had already declared to the OPLC that she was in a personal relationship with a director of West Ham United, and was suspended whilst a possible conflict of interest was investigated.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14034618 "London 2012: OPLC Reviews Olympic Stadium Bid Process"]. [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 16 July 2011.</ref> On 22 August 2011, the independent investigation ruled that the process was not compromised and thus the bid process will not be reopened.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/14612877.stm |publisher = BBC News | title=2012 Stadium Bid Not Compromised | date=22 August 2011}}</ref>

On 23 August, the day before Tottenham Hotspur were due in court, they staged "intense negotiations" with the office of the Mayor of London, and looked set to drop all claims for a review and be offered funding for their own stadium.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14641254 |publisher = BBC News | title=Tottenham 'To Drop 2012 Olympic Stadium Legal Bid' | date=23 August 2011}}</ref> However, the next day Tottenham did attend court despite being close to striking a deal about their own stadium, thus allowing West Ham to move into the Olympic Stadium by 2014. Tottenham and Leyton Orient won a review of the decision, being told that they had an arguable case.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14646806 | publisher = BBC News | title=Spurs Win Right To Challenge 2012 Stadium Decision | date=24 August 2011}}</ref> The review was scheduled to take place on 18 October 2011. Even if Tottenham had abandoned the review, due to being granted a new stadium, Orient were expected to continue, with its owner [[Barry Hearn]] calling the decision to grant a review "a great day for the little man".<ref name="review"/> It had been reported that if the judicial review had ordered a re-run of the bidding process then a clause would have been inserted stipulating that the winning bidder must retain a running track within the stadium itself.<ref>{{cite news|author= Wilson, Neil |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/olympics/article-2022925/London-2012-Olympics-Coe-insists-track-stay-Olympic-Stadium.html |title=London 2012 Olympics: Coe Insists Track Will Stay at Olympic Stadium |work= [[Daily Mail]]  |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref>

In July 2012 the Olympic Park Legacy Company submitted a bid to England Rugby 2015 to host some matches of the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]]. It was mooted that the stadium could hold pool matches and even the third place play<U+2013>off. However the main sticking point would be whether it could meet the [[International Rugby Board]]'s demands for the tournament including free from advertising. If successful the stadium would be likely to replace the [[Emirates Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Rugby World Cup |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/rugby-world-cup/9373873/London-2012-Olympics-Stratford-Stadium-makes-pitch-to-host-Rugby-World-Cup-2015-matches.html |title=London 2012 Olympics: Stratford Stadium makes pitch to host Rugby World Cup 2015 matches |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> In September 2012 it was confirmed that if the stadium had a tennant by the time the stadia are chosen then it could appear.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roan |first=Dan |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/19628404 |title=BBC Sport - London's Olympic Stadium may host 2015 Rugby World Cup |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>

By September 20 the famous pixels had already been removed as they were only on load from Crystal, however according to Paul Kelso "reinstating the system would help establish the Olympic Stadium as a concert venue in competition with Wembley and Twickenham." Kelso also learnt that the triangular floodlights could be removed when the new roof is fitted as the cost of keeping them is too great. However West Ham want to keep the lights as they would like to keep the stadium looking as it did during the Games, and may consider keeping the wrap on the outside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9551404/West-Ham-keen-to-keep-Olympic-Stadiums-iconic-triangular-floodlights-despite-London-Mayor-Boris-Johnsons-efforts.html |title=West Ham keen to keep Olympic Stadium's iconic triangular floodlights despite London Mayor Boris Johnson's efforts |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>

===2017 World Athletics championships===
London originally bid to host the [[2015 World Championships in Athletics|2015 World Athletics Championships]] using the Olympic Stadium.
