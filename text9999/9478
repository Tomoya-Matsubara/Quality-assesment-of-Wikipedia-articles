'''Jack the Bulldog''' is the official [[mascot]] of the [[Georgetown University]] [[Georgetown Hoyas|Hoyas]] athletics teams. Jack has been the name of at least four live [[Bulldog]]s since 1962, when the name first came into use.<ref name=reynolds>{{cite journal |url= http://library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/dogs.htm |title= The Dogs of Georgetown |journal= Georgetown Magazine |month= September-October |year= 1983 |first= Jon K. |last= Reynolds |accessdate= 2008-07-17}}</ref> The current incarnation of Jack is an English Bulldog born in 2003 whose full name is John S. Carroll. Jack is also portrayed by a [[costumed character]] Bulldog mascot, a tradition dating to 1977. Jack was not always the name of the Georgetown Hoyas' mascot, nor was the mascot always a bulldog, as other types of dogs, particularly [[Bull Terrier|bull terriers]], were associated with the sports teams before 1962. Today, Georgetown is among thirty-nine American universities to use a bulldog as their mascot.<ref name=journalism>{{cite web |url= http://journalism.georgetown.edu/kingajanik.html |title= Bulldogs Best at Bolstering School Spirit? |first= Kinga |last= Janik |date= [[July 6]], [[2007]] |work= Georgetown Journalism |accessdate= 2008-07-22}}</ref>

==History==
Dogs have been associated with the school's sports teams on an unofficial basis since the late nineteenth century. Early dog mascots may have included a mutt called Hoya, a [[Borzoi]] named Richmond Jack in 1906, and a Boston [[Bull Terrier]] in 1911.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Paul|coauthors=Paul K. Williams|title=Georgetown University|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, SC|date=2003|series=The College History Series|pages=63|isbn=0738515094}}</ref> At this time, the mascot was primarily associated with the school's football team.

[[Image:StubbyTheGeorgetownTerrier.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sergeant Stubby]] began as mascot in 1921]]
[[Sergeant Stubby]], a part bull terrier and a decorated [[World War I]] [[war dog]], came to campus in 1921 with J. Robert Conroy who was attending [[Georgetown University Law Center]] at the time. The school football team used Stubby as a popular [[halftime show]] where he would push a football across the field.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/node/11106 |title= From Mascot to Military, Stubby Left Pawprints on Hilltop and Beyond |first= Derek |last= Richmond |date= [[November 4]], [[2003]] |work= [[The Hoya]] |accessdate= 2008-07-17}}</ref> After his death in 1926, he was replaced by the team with Jazz Bo, brought to campus by [[Georgetown College (Georgetown University)|Georgetown College]] student Paul Van Laanen. Jazz Bo, another bull terrier, was called "Hoya" by the students, after the traditional "Hoya Saxa" school cheer. The athletic teams are possibly named, in turn, for this dog.<ref name=reynolds/>

Other bull terriers filled in as mascot until [[World War II]], when athletics at the school paused during the war. After the war, a [[Great Dane]] named Butch was the mascot.<ref name=history>{{cite web |url= http://traditions.georgetown.edu/jack/history.html |title= History of GU Dogs |work= Georgetown University |date= [[February 14]], [[2008]] |accessdate= 2008-07-17}}</ref> [[William Peter Blatty]], author of ''[[The Exorcist]]'', was one of the students to care for Butch. A bull terrier costume was also briefly used by the school.<ref name=reynolds/> From 1951 to 1962, the school suspended the football program as part of a larger backlash against university sports.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Paul|coauthors=Paul K. Williams|title=Georgetown University|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, SC|date=2003|series=The College History Series|pages=90|isbn=0738515094}}</ref>

==Bulldogs==
[[Image:Hoya mascot.jpg|thumb|upright|The costumed personification of Jack the Bulldog at a basketball game.]]
In 1962, with the resumption of a football team, students Stan Samorajczyk and John Feldmann, editors of ''[[The Hoya]]'' campus newspaper, founded a committee to raise money for the purchase of a new mascot dog in time for the first new games in 1964.<ref name=history/> This committee chose a [[purebred]] English Bulldog as the dog which would represent Georgetown students because of their "tenacity."<ref name=reynolds/> Samorajczyk also followed the sports team jerseys, which may have previously had an image of a bulldog on them.<ref name=tricks/> In this same year, 1962, the school adopted as the official logo of the athletics program a new drawing in blue and gray school colors of the bulldog. This logo dog wears a cap typical of the [[beanie]] which other freshman at the time had to wear.<ref name=cstv>{{cite web |url= http://guhoyas.cstv.com/trads/gu-hoya.html |title= What is a Hoya? |work= Georgetown Athletics |date= 2008 |accessdate= 2008-07-17}}</ref>

For $150 the committee bought a two-year-old blue-ribbon-champion [[show dog]] named "Lil-Nan's Royal Jacket," named because the colors of his [[Coat (dog)|coat]] looked like a jacket.<ref name=tricks>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/node/15110|title=Teaching a New Dog Old Tricks|last=McDevitt|first=Caitlin|date=[[January 24]], [[2008]] |work=[[The Hoya]]|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> This dog was to be renamed "Hoya" like his 1926 predecessor, but refused to respond to any name other than his call name "Jack."<ref name=wp>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/29/AR2007032902362.html |title= Hoyas' Mascot Laps Up The Love |first= Susan |last= Kinzie |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date= [[March 30]], [[2007]] |accessdate= 2008-07-17}}</ref> Jack lived outside [[New South Hall]] in a heated [[doghouse]].<ref name=tricks/> In 1967, Royal Jacket retired and was replaced by a second bulldog who continued under the simple name "Jack."<ref name=cstv/> In 1977, the costumed mascot took over duties as Jack.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Paul|coauthors=Paul K.

In 1998, Michael Boyle, Austin Martin, and Kathleen Long, co-founders of the Hoya Blue fan club began a campaign to revive the tradition of an official live mascot with the assistance of English professor Father [[Scott R. Pilarz]], S.J.<ref name=history> The "Bring Back Jack" Campaign initially sought to find a suitable dog among the students and faculty, as the university did not want to use school funds for the purchase.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/node/3852 |title= Efforts to Buy Bulldog Mascot Meet Opposition |date= [[December 8]], [[1998]] |first= Jean |last= Weinberg |work= [[The Hoya]] |accessdate= 2008-07-17}}</ref> Ultimately, Hoya Blue raised $1500 to purchase a new puppy named Jack and placed in the care of Father Pilarz on [[February 16]], [[1999]].<ref name=hoya/> Pilarz left Georgetown in 2003 to be president of the [[University of Scranton]] in [[Pennsylvania]], and took Jack with him. Donations from Hoya Blue, the Hoya Hoop Club, the Office of the President, and alumni allowed for the purchase of the current incarnation of Jack.<ref name=history/>

==John S. Carroll==
[[Image:Jack the Bulldog bed.jpg|thumb|Jack spends much of his days resting in Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence.]]
Jack was born [[May 3]], [[2003]] at Brookhollow Kennel in [[Freehold, New Jersey]], son of champion bulldog Copper Kid and a relation of Rocky the 1983 bulldog.<ref name=tricks/> He was brought to campus on [[July 19]], [[2003]] and placed in the care of Father Christopher Steck, S.J., a theology professor. His official name, as registered with the [[American Kennel Club]] is Brookhollow's John S. Carroll, which allows for the nickname Jack.<ref name=stats>{{cite web |url= http://traditions.georgetown.edu/jack/statistics.html |title= Vital Statistics |work= Georgetown University |date= [[February 14]], [[2008]] |accessdate= 2008-07-17}}</ref> This refers to Georgetown founder [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], while "S." stands for Steck. Similarly the previous mascot was officially John P. Carroll, for Pilarz. He is also infrequently referred to as Jack IV, as the school is unsure of the exact number of dogs used as Jack in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1417713#/note.php?note_id=2215141458 |title= Jack's name |date= [[October 27]], [[2006]] |work= [[Facebook]] |accessdate= 2008-07-17}}</ref>
