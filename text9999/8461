==College career==

Sanchez was well regarded upon his arrival at USC.<ref name=SI011905>Stewart Mandel, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/stewart_mandel/01/18/mandel.011805/ Next in line?

===2006===
[[File:091507-USCNeb-MarkSanchez.jpg|thumb|upright|80px|left|Sanchez in 2007]]

In April 2006, Sanchez was arrested after a female USC student accused him of [[sexual assault]].  He was released from jail the following day and suspended, but on June 3, 2006, the [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]]'s office announced no charges would be filed, and Sanchez was reinstated, remaining subject to team-related discipline for underage drinking and using fake identification on the night he was arrested.<ref name=ABC1>[http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=local&id=4209059 USC Quarterback Won't Face Sexual Assault Charges], Los Angeles ABC 7, June 3, 2006, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2468540 USC QB Sanchez won't face sexual assault charges], [[Associated Press|AP]] at [[ESPN.com]], June 3, 2006, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2472859 "Report: USC reinstates QB Sanchez"], [[ESPN.com]], June 6, 2006, Accessed March 18, 2010.</ref><ref name=LAT102307bd>Bill Dwyre, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/23/sports/sp-dwyre23 This USC call should be clear], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 23, 2007, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref><ref>Matt Hayes, [http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=394151 A safe haven, not a Trojan war: USC's QB battle], ''Sporting News'', April 1, 2008, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref>

For the [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006 season]], Sanchez competed for the starting quarterback position; however, once junior [[John David Booty]] underwent back surgery after the first day of spring practice, Sanchez ran the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recuperated. Coaches stated Booty would be regarded as the starting quarterback when he returned for fall training camp.<ref name=LAT101207>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/12/sports/sp-usc12 Call for Backup], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 12, 2007, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref> During the 2006 season Sanchez played in 6 games completing 3 of 7 passes for 63 yards and 1 interception. He also saw playing time in [[2006 USC Trojans football team|USC's]] games against Arizona, [[2006 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[2006 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] but he did not throw a pass.

===2007===
In fall practice before [[2007 USC Trojans football team|USC's]] [[2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2007 season]], Sanchez broke the thumb in his throwing hand, missing the first game against [[Idaho Vandals football|Idaho]]; he returned the following week and the redshirt sophomore again served as the primary backup to senior [[John David Booty]]. Mid-season, Sanchez was moved up to starting quarterback for the game against [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona]] after Booty suffered a broken finger in his throwing hand during a 24&ndash;23 upset loss to [[2007 Stanford Cardinal football team|Stanford]].<ref name=LAT101207>Gary Klein, http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/12/sports/sp-usc12 Call for Backup], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 12, 2007, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref> 

On October 13, Sanchez led USC to a 20&ndash;13 victory, overcoming a shaky first half where he threw two key interceptions, allowing Arizona to tie the game going into halftime. During the second half, Sanchez completed 11 of 15 passes for 74 yards and a touchdown and had a key 10-yard run for a first down, ultimately finishing the game 19 for 31 passing with 130 yards and averaged 4.2 yards a play for one touchdown, two interceptions, and was [[Quarterback sack|sacked]] three times.<ref name=LAT101407bb-san>Ben Bloch, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/14/sports/sp-uscside14 Sanchez overcomes shaky start for USC], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 14, 2007, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref>

With Booty still recovering, USC elected to start Sanchez for a second straight week, this time at [[2007 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]]; he made significant improvements, completing 21 of 38 passes for 235 yards and four touchdowns and no interceptions.<ref name=LAT102107gk1>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/21/sports/sp-usc21 Heroes and zeros for Trojans], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 21, 2007, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref>

On October 27, Sanchez started for the final time in place of the injured Booty, at an away game against [[2007 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]]. The game resulted in a 24&ndash;17 defeat for USC, with Sanchez having two passes intercepted by Oregon [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] Matthew Harper in the second half. The first interception led to a fourth-quarter touchdown that gave Oregon a 14 point lead; the second interception ended USC's final chance for a comeback.<ref name=LAT102807gk1>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/28/sports/sp-usc28 Hope takes holiday], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 28, 2007, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref> He publicly accepted the blame for the loss.<ref name=ESPNtM081108>Jorge Arangure Jr., [http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3511275 <U+00A1>VIVA SANCHEZ!], ''ESPN The Magazine'', August 11, 2008, Accessed July 31, 2008. (published/accessed discrepancy due to delay between online posting and publication)</ref> 

The following week, against [[2007 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]], Booty returned as USC's starting quarterback, with Sanchez resuming his position as Booty's backup.<ref>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/02/sports/sp-booty2 Booty keeps eyes on what<U+2019>s next], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 2, 2008, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref>  Sanchez passed for 695 yards and seven touchdowns with five interceptions over the season.<ref name=AP011509a>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/draft09/news/story?id=3835329 Sanchez will enter NFL draft], Associated Press, January 15, 2009, Accessed January 15, 2009.</ref> Sanchez started only three games for the Trojans in the 2007 season.

Sanchez entered spring practice after the [[2008 USC Trojans football team|2008 season]] as the front-runner to take over the starting quarterback position, but faced strong competition from [[Arkansas Razorbacks|Arkansas]]-transfer and former Razorback starter [[Mitch Mustain]] and redshirt freshman [[Aaron Corp]]; Mustain, like Sanchez a year earlier, was the top quarterback in the nation coming out of high school in 2006.<ref name="SI041808"/><ref name=LAT032608>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/26/sports/spw-uscfoot26 USC plans to have starting quarterback in place by summer], ''Los Angeles Times'', March 26, 2008, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref><ref name=ESPN022708b>Tim Griffin, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3266832 Quarterback battles, defensive replacements key to Pac-10 spring practices], ESPN.com, February 27, 2008, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref><ref name=SI030608>Stewart Mandel, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/stewart_mandel/03/05/spring.questions/index.html?eref=T1 Spring primer], SI.com, March 6, 2008, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref>  By the end of spring practice, the USC coaching staff announced that Sanchez would be the designated starting quarterback going into fall camp.<ref name=LAT041608>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/16/sports/sp-usc16 Sanchez gets the nod at USC], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 16, 2008, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref><ref name=DT041608>Josh Jovanelly, [http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2008/04/16/Sports/Sanchez.Gets.Nod.As.Starting.Quarterback-3327890.shtml Sanchez gets nod as starting quarterback], ''Daily Trojan'', April 16, 2008, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref><ref name=SI050108>Cory McCartney, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/cory_mccartney/05/01/winners.losers/index.html Spring's biggest winners and losers], SI.com, May 1, 2008, Accessed July 31, 2008.</ref><ref name=ESPN072408>Ted Miller, [http://myespn.go.com/blogs/pac10/0-1-82/Once-anointed-as-USC-QB--Sanchez-asserted-himself.html Once anointed as USC QB, Sanchez asserted himself], ESPN.com, July 24, 2008, Accessed July 28, 2008.</ref> During the first week of fall camp, Sanchez suffered a dislocated left kneecap while warming up for practice; trainers were able to immediately put the kneecap back into place.<ref name=LAT080908>Gary Klein, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-sanchez9-2008aug09,0,2472162.story Mark Sanchez's knee injury muddies waters at USC], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 9, 2008, Accessed August 11, 2008.</ref>  After missing nearly three weeks, Sanchez was cleared to play in the opener against [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] on the final scrimmage of fall camp.<ref name=LAT081008>Gary Klein, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-usc10-2008aug10,0,2265071.story Mitch Mustain, Aaron Corp battle for starting spot], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 10, 2008, Accessed August 11, 2008.</ref><ref name=LAT082708>Gary Klein, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-usc27-2008aug27,0,5692225.story USC quarterback Mark Sanchez has uneven practice, is cleared to play], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 27, 2008, Accessed August 27, 2008.</ref>  Before the opener, Sanchez was contacted by USC's previous three quarterbacks under Carroll<U+2014>[[Carson Palmer]], [[Matt Leinart]] and Booty<U+2014>who wished him well and offered general advice.<ref name="LAT083008"/>

After the Rose Bowl, Sanchez said it would be "hard" to leave USC for the [[NFL]] and "probably couldn't do it;  He also mentioned that the New York Jets were a possible to team to sign with.   Though he would have entered his redshirt senior year if he had stayed. However, with the subsequent announcement that other NFL-caliber quarterbacks, such as [[Sam Bradford]], [[Tim Tebow]] and [[Colt McCoy]], had decided to stay in school for their junior and senior seasons respectively, rumors arose that Sanchez would use the opportunity to be one of the first two quarterbacks selected in the [[2009 NFL Draft]].<ref name=ESPN011409>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/draft09/news/story?id=3833465 Father: Sanchez still undecided], ESPN.com, January 14, 2009, Accessed January 14, 2009.</ref><ref name=LAT011509a>Gary Klein, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-sanchez-usc-nfl15-2009jan15,0,687615.story USC's Mark Sanchez appears headed to NFL], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 15, 2009, Accessed January 15, 2009.</ref><ref name=WRSC011409a>Brian Matthews, [http://wearesc.com/news/story.php?article=1774 Sources: Sanchez Leaning Toward the NFL], WeAreSC.com, January 14, 2009, Accessed January 14, 2009.</ref>  On January 15, Sanchez announced his plans to forgo his final year of college eligibility and enter the [[2009 NFL Draft]], although he continued as a USC student and finished his degree in the Spring of 2009 while preparing for the draft.<ref name="AP011509a"/><ref name=LAT011509b>Gary Klein and Mike Hiserman, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-sanchez-usc-nfl16-2009jan16,0,1474049.story USC's Mark Sanchez to enter NFL draft], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2009, Accessed January 16, 2009.</ref>  During the press conference, Carroll made it clear that he did not agree with Sanchez' decision, and that he advised him of the low success-rate of quarterbacks who left the college game early to enter the NFL, and suggested he attend graduate school to use his final year of collegiate eligibility.<ref name="LAT011509b"/>  Despite the public disagreement, the two remained close afterward.<ref name=OCR021309>Michael Lev, [http://usc.freedomblogging.com/2009/02/13/nfl-draft-the-mark-sanchez-interview-part-1-of-3/10201/ NFL draft: The Mark Sanchez interview (Part 1 of 3)], ''Orange County Register'', February 13, 2009, Accessed February 17, 2009.</ref>  Sanchez was the first USC quarterback to turn pro before exhausting his eligibility since [[Todd Marinovich]] did so after the 1990 season.<ref name="LAT011605a"/>

Jets Head Coach [[Rex Ryan]] noted that he viewed training camp as an open competition between the two for the eventual starting position for the 2009 season.<ref name=NYDN073109>Rich Cimini, [http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2009/07/31/2009-07-31_jets_open_rex_ryan_era_at_sunycortland.html Jets open Rex Ryan era at SUNY-Cortland], ''New York Daily News'', July 31, 2009, Accessed July 31, 2009.</ref> On August 26, 2009 Sanchez was named the starter.<ref name="Sources:Mark Sanchez named New York Jets starting qb">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp09/news/story?id=4423136 Chris Mortenson]</ref>

On September 13, 2009, Sanchez started his first regular season NFL game against the [[Houston Texans]], throwing his first touchdown pass to [[Chansi Stuckey]]. Sanchez and the Jets won the game 24<U+2013>7, with Sanchez throwing for 272 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He was named the Pepsi Rookie of the Week for his performance in the game.  He played his first home game a week later versus the [[New England Patriots]], a 16<U+2013>9 victory; it was also his first division game and his first [[Rivalries in the National Football League|rivalry game]]. It was the Jets first victory over New England at home since 2000.  With a 24<U+2013>17 victory over the [[Tennessee Titans]] in week 3, Sanchez became the first rookie quarterback to start and win his first three games of an NFL season. However, he had a pass picked off for a 97-yard touchdown return, and fumbled another attempted pass in his end zone for another touchdown, as the Jets fell to the [[New Orleans Saints]] in week 4. These two plays were enough to spoil an otherwise great outing from the Jets defensive unit as they dropped to 3<U+2013>1 on the year. Following the loss to New Orleans, Sanchez received criticism for losses to AFC East rivals Miami Dolphins (31 - 27) and Buffalo Bills (16 - 13), where Sanchez threw a total of 5 interceptions.<ref name="test">[http://www.newyorkjets.com/schedule/season-schedule.html],</ref> The following game Sanchez received even more criticism when during a 38-0 blow out of the Oakland Raiders, he was seen eating a hot dog on the Jets' bench in the fourth quarter.<ref name="test">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/26/mark-sanchez-hot-dog-vide_n_334262.html],</ref>

On Thursday, December 3, 2009, Sanchez sprained his PCL in a game against the [[Buffalo Bills]]. Sanchez was then benched for the game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on December 13, 2009 as the Jets wanted to ensure Sanchez made a full recovery.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink |coauthors= |title=Mark Sanchez Frustrated With Rex Ryan's Decision |url=http://www.nesn.com/2009/12/mark-sanchez-frustrated-with-rex-ryans-decision.html |work=NESN |publisher= |date=December 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref>

On Sunday, December 27, 2009, Sanchez led the Jets to a win against the then-undefeated Indianapolis Colts 29<U+2013>15 after Colts head coach [[Jim Caldwell (American football)|Jim Caldwell]] controversially rested team starters in the third quarter with only a five-point lead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nfl/story/?id=303749|title=Jets End Colts' Perfect Season After Indy Pulls Starters|work=The Sports Network|date=2009-12-27|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref>

On Sunday, January 3, 2010, Sanchez led his team to the playoffs, completing just eight of sixteen passes for sixty-three yards en route to a 37<U+2013>0 win over the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], who, already having clinched the AFC North title and a playoff berth, rested starters and held back tactics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/sports/football/09vecsey.html|title=Eight Teams That Will Try Their Best.

Sanchez finished up his rookie regular season with 12 touchdowns and 20 interceptions.

On January 9, 2010, the Jets, led by Sanchez, won the wild card game against the Cincinnati Bengals in Cincinnati, 24<U+2013>14.  Sanchez was 12 of 15 in passing and threw for 182 yards, 1 touchdown and 0 interceptions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/sports/football/10jets.html?ref=football|title=Feeling Like Favorites, the Jets Play Like It|date=2010-01-09|work=New York Times|accessdate=2010-01-10 | first=Greg | last=Bishop}}</ref> Sanchez had a 139.4 [[passer rating]].

On January 17, 2010, Sanchez, along with the help of [[Shonn Greene]] the Jets defeated the highly favored San Diego Chargers 17-14 to go the Jets' 3rd ever [[AFC Championship game]]. Sanchez became only the second rookie quarterback to win two consecutive playoff games, after [[Joe Flacco]]. 

The Jets then lost to the Colts on January 24, 2010, the AFC Championship game. The score was 30 - 17.

Following the 2009 season Sanchez was named to [[Sporting News]]'s All-Rookie team.<ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/article/2010-01-14/sporting-news-2009-nfl-all-rookie-team]</ref>

Sanchez is a third-generation [[Mexican-American]].<ref name="OCW082108"/> Sanchez' great-grandfather, Nicholas Sanchez, was born in [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]], [[Mexico]]; he later moved to south [[Texas]] and, in 1911, to California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] where he and his wife worked as fruit pickers and raised a family of six children.<ref name="ESPNtM081108"/>  Nicholas Sanchez settled in the Palo Verde section of [[Ch<U+00E1>vez Ravine]], but was displaced when the government cleared the land for public housing, only to build [[Dodger Stadium]].<ref name="OCW082108"/>  Another of Sanchez' great-grandparents, Pedro Moreno of [[Jalisco]], moved to [[Bisbee, Arizona]] and became a successful real estate investor before moving to Los Angeles with his wife and 16 children in 1925.

When Sanchez was elevated to prominence at USC, he found himself a symbol of Mexican-American identity and a role model for children.<ref name="LAT122908"/><ref name="ESPNtM081108"/>  Being at USC put him in the center of the spotlight in Los Angeles, a metropolitan area populated with more than 4.6 million [[Hispanics]], three-quarters of whom are Mexican.<ref name="LAT122908"/>  He began getting attention from the media in [[Mexico]].<ref name=SB111508>Paul Gutierrez, [http://www.sacbee.com/sports/story/1399922.html USC quarterback is a cultural icon], ''Sacramento Bee'', November 15, 2008, Accessed January 16, 2009.</ref>  While there had been previous, successful Mexican-American quarterbacks such as [[Jim Plunkett]], [[Joe Kapp]], [[Jeff Garcia]], [[Tony Romo]], and [[Marc Bulger]], unlike his predecessors, Sanchez was a third-generation, full-blooded Mexican-American.<ref name="OCW082108"/>  USC fans began playing up Sanchez' ethnicity by wearing items such as [[sarape]]s, [[lucha libre]] masks and homemade "<U+00A1>Viva Sanchez!"
