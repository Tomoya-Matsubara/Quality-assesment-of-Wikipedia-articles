The '''Greater Romania Party''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Rom<U+00E2>nia Mare}}, PRM) is a [[Romania]]n  ultra-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] political party, led by [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]]. The party is sometimes referred to in English as the '''Great Romania Party'''.  

It promotes strongly [[nationalism|nationalist]] policies and is seen as the most right-wing of the major Romanian parties. The party's philosophy has often been characterized as [[xenophobia|xenophobic]], anti-[[Hungarian minority in Romania|ethnic Hungarian]], [[Antiziganism|anti-Roma]], [[homophobia|homophobic]], [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]], and [[irredentism|irredentist]]. PRM's rhetoric has also focused extensively on Romania's pervasive problem of high level corruption, a top concern of many average Romanians and an issue that has gained votes for the PRM, even from those who do not wholly agree with the party's strongly nationalistic ideology. 

It briefly participated in government from 1993 to 1995 (in [[Nicolae V<U+0103>c<U+0103>roiu]]'s cabinet). In 2000, Tudor received the second largest number of votes in Romania's presidential elections, partially as a result of  protest votes lodged by Romanians frustrated with the fractionalization and mixed performance of the 1996-2000 [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] government. Tudor's second place position ensured he would compete in the second round run-off against former president and [[Romanian Social Democratic Party]] (PDSR) candidate [[Ion Iliescu]], who won by a large margin. Parallels are often drawn with the situation in [[France]] two years later, when far right [[Front National (France)|Front National]] Party leader [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] similarly drew the second largest number of votes and was elevated, but defeated, in the presidential run-off against [[Jacques Chirac]]. 

Although Tudor clearly remained the central figure in the PRM, in March 2005 he briefly stepped down from the party presidency in favour of [[Corneliu Ciontu]]. A primary objective of the move was to provide the appearance of a shift  toward the political center and to attempt to align PRM with the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) bloc in the [[European Parliament]].  During this period the PRM also briefly changed its name to the ''Greater Romania's People Party''.   EPP, however, rejected the PRM as a potential member.  Tudor stated he refused to join the EPP because of its lack of identity. In June 2005, Tudor asserted that he had decided the new leadership had distanced itself from the founding principles of the party, and he sacked the new leadership and reverted the party's name back to simply the "Greater Romania Party". In November 2005, Ciontu, along with a small faction of the PRM, formed their own party, the [[People's Party (Romania)|People's Party]], which has since merged with the [[New Generation <U+2013> Christian Democratic Party]].

As of January 2007, with Romania's accession to the E.U., it was reported that Rom<U+00E2>nia Mare's five [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s were set to join a group of [[far-right]] parties in the European Parliament that includes the French [[National Front (France)|National Front]] and Austrian [[Freedom Party]], giving them sufficient numbers to form an official bloc, called [[Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Traynor |title=Romania's first gift to the European Union - a caucus of neo-fascists and Holocaust deniers |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/eu/story/0,,1984948,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=19 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[January 8]], [[2007]]}}</ref>

==History and ideology==
{{Politics of Romania}}
The party was founded in [[1991]] by Tudor and his literary mentor, the writer [[Eugen Barbu]], one year after Tudor launched the ''Rom<U+00E2>nia Mare'' weekly magazine, which remains the most important propaganda tool of the PRM. Tudor subsequently launched a companion daily newspaper called ''Tricolorul''. The historical expression ''[[Greater Romania]]'' refers to the idea of recreating the former [[Kingdom of Romania]] which existed during the interwar period. Having been the largest entity to bear the name of ''Romania'', the frontiers were marked with the intent of uniting most territories inhabited by [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] into a single country; and it is now a rallying cry for Romanian nationalists. Due to internal conditions under [[Communist Romania|Communism]] after [[World War II]], the expression's use was forbidden in publications until [[1990]], after the [[1989 Romanian Revolution]].) 

[[Image:Greater Romania histprov.svg|thumb|right|250px|Greater Romania]]Both the ideology and the main political focus of the Greater Romania Party are reflected in frequently strongly nationalistic articles written by Tudor. For example, in his magazine there is a permanent column called simply ''Unguri'' ("Hungarians"), in which he fights alleged anti-Romanian conspiracies of the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania|ethnic Hungarian party]].  

In 2003, Tudor said he would no longer engage in discourse against [[Jews]] and [[Judaism]] or deny [[the Holocaust]] (''see [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]]''). He also said that he had become, in his own words, a "[[Philo-Semitism|philo-Semite]]". In subsequent months he and some of his supporters traveled to [[Poland]] to visit the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]; and, despite strong objections from the family of slain [[Israel]]i [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and many Jewish organizations,<ref>{{cite news |title=Dedication of Romanian Statue of Rabin a Ploy |url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASInt_13/4442_13.htm |work=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |date=[[January 16]], [[2004]]}}</ref> Tudor illegally erected a statue in memory of Rabin in the city of [[Bra<U+015F>ov]] (for which he was found guilty and fined). During this period, Tudor hired [[Nati Meir]], a Jewish advisor, who ran and won as a PRM candidate for the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies]]. Tudor also hired an Israeli public relations firm, Arad Communications, to run his campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_yad/press_room/press_releases/arad.html |title=Yad Vashem has issued the following statement regarding the business relationship between Israeli public relations entrepreneur Eyal Arad and the leader of the Greater Romania party, Vadim Tudor: |date=[[March 14]], [[2004]] |work=[[Yad Vashem]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romanianjewish.org/en/index_fcer4_06.html |title=APPEAL |work=The Romanian Jewish Community}}</ref> In 2005, Meir resigned from the PRM, stating he had discovered that Tudor and the party remained [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]].  Throughout this period, PRM publications continued to include articles that denied the Holocaust in Romania and took deliberately antagonistic positions toward Romanian Roma, ethnic Hungarians, and other minority groups.
