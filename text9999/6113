'''Tungsten''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>t<U+028C><U+014B>st<U+0259>n}}), also known as '''wolfram''' ({{IPA|/<U+02C8>w<U+028A>lfr<U+0259>m/}}), is a [[chemical element]] with the chemical symbol '''W''' and [[atomic number]] 74.

A steel-gray [[metal]], tungsten is found in several [[ore]]s, including [[wolframite]] and [[scheelite]].  It is remarkable for its robust physical properties, especially the fact that it has the highest [[melting point]] of all the non-[[alloy]]ed metals and the second highest of all the elements after [[carbon]].<ref name="daintith">{{cite book| author = Daintith, John | title = Facts on File Dictionary of Chemistry, 4th ed. | publisher = New York: Checkmark Books | year =  2005}}</ref> Tungsten is often [[brittle]]<ref>{{cite book | title = Tungsten: properties, chemistry, technology of the element, alloys, and chemical compounds | first = Erik | last = Lassner | coauthor = Schubert, Wolf-Dieter| publisher = Springer | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780306450532 | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=foLRISkt9gcC&pg=PA20 | page = 256 | chapter = low temperature brittleness | pages = 20&ndash;21}}</ref> and hard to [[metalworking|work]] in its raw state; however, if pure, it can be cut with a [[hacksaw]].<ref name="albert">{{cite book| author = Stwertka, Albert | title = A Guide to the elements, 2nd ed. | publisher = New York: Oxford University Press |year = 2002}}</ref> The pure form is used mainly in electrical applications, but its many compounds and alloys are used in many applications, most notably in [[light bulb]] filaments, [[X-ray tube]]s (as both the filament and target), and [[superalloys]].

==History==
In 1781, [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] discovered that a new [[acid]], [[tungstic acid]], could be made from [[scheelite]] (at the time named tungstenite). Scheele and [[Torbern Bergman]] suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid.<ref name="SaundersN"/> In 1783, [[Jos<U+00E9> Elhuyar|Jos<U+00E9>]] and [[Fausto Elhuyar]] found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, in [[Spain]], the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with [[charcoal]], and they are credited with the discovery of the element.<ref name="ITIAnews_0605">{{cite news|url=http://www.itia.info/FileLib/ITIA_Newsletter_June05.pdf|title=ITIA Newsletter|date=June 2005|publisher=International Tungsten Industry Association|accessdate=2008-06-18|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="ITIAnews_1205">{{cite news|url=http://www.itia.info/FileLib/ITIA_Newsletter_December05.pdf|title=ITIA Newsletter|date=December 2005|publisher=International Tungsten Industry Association|accessdate=2008-06-18|format=PDF}}</ref>

In [[World War II]], tungsten played a significant role in background political dealings. [[Portugal]], as the main European source of the element, was put under pressure from both sides, because of its deposits of wolframite ore. Tungsten's resistance to high temperatures and its strength in alloys made it an important raw material for the weaponry industry.<ref name="portugal">{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Donald G.|year=1999|title=World War II Economic Warfare: The United States, Britain, and Portuguese Wolfram|journal=The Historian|publisher=[http://www.questia.com Questia]|url=http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=LY1PyzmCc1D256Gvh5wpbhxKyTyvcm2FHpMwpcs2wW2XyytCh4pW!956463030?docId=5001286099}}</ref>

===Etymology===
The name "Tungsten" (from the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and  [[Danish language|Danish]]  ''tung sten'', meaning "''heavy stone''") is used in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and many other languages as the name of the element. Tungsten was the old Swedish name for the mineral [[scheelite]]. The other name "wolfram" (or "volfram"), used for example in [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and in both [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], is derived from  the mineral [[wolframite]], and this is also the origin of its chemical symbol, '''W'''.<ref name="albert"/> The name "wolframite" is derived from German "''wolf rahm''" ("wolf soot" or "wolf cream"), the name given to tungsten by [[Johan Gottschalk Wallerius]] in 1747. This, in turn, derives from "''Lupi spuma''", the name [[Georg Agricola]] used for the element in 1546, which translates into English as "wolf's froth" or "cream" (the etymology is not entirely certain), and is a reference to the large amounts of [[tin]] consumed by the mineral during its extraction.<ref name="sweetums">{{cite web

==Characteristics==
===Physical===
In its raw form, tungsten is a steel-gray [[metal]] that is often [[brittle]] and hard to [[metalworking|work]]. But, if pure, it can be worked easily.<ref name="albert"/> It is worked by [[forging]], [[drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]], [[extrusion|extruding]], or [[sinter]]ing. Of all metals in pure form, tungsten has the highest [[melting point]] (3,422&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]], 6,192&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]), lowest [[vapor pressure]] and (at temperatures above 1,650&nbsp;<U+00B0>C, 3,002&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) the highest [[tensile strength]].<ref name="desu">{{cite book| author = C. R. Hammond |title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81th edition| publisher =CRC press| isbn = 0849304857}}</ref> Tungsten has the lowest [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of any pure metal. Alloying small quantities of tungsten with [[steel]] greatly increases its toughness.<ref name="daintith"/>

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of tungsten}}
Naturally occurring tungsten consists of five [[isotope]]s whose [[half-life|half-lives]] are so long that they can be considered [[stable isotope|stable]]. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 ([[hafnium]]) by [[alpha emission]], but only <sup>180</sup>W has been observed <ref>{{cite journal| author = C.

Another 30 artificial [[radioisotope]]s of tungsten have been characterized, the most stable of which are <sup>181</sup>W with a [[half-life]] of 121.2&nbsp;days, <sup>185</sup>W with a half-life of 75.1&nbsp;days, <sup>188</sup>W with a half-life of 69.4&nbsp;days, <sup>178</sup>W with a half-life of 21.6&nbsp;days, and <sup>187</sup>W with a half-life of 23.72 h.<ref name=isotopes/> All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives of less than 3&nbsp;hours, and most of these have half-lives below 8&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=isotopes/> Tungsten also has 4&nbsp;[[meta state]]s, the most stable being <sup>179m</sup>W (''T''<sub><U+00BD></sub> 6.4&nbsp;minutes).

Elemental tungsten resists attack by [[Oxidization|oxygen]], [[acid]]s, and [[alkali]]s.<ref name = "emsley"/>

The most common formal [[oxidation state]] of tungsten is +6, but it exhibits all oxidation states from -1 to +6.<ref name="emsley">{{cite book| author = Emsley, John E. | title = The elements, 2nd ed.| publisher = New York: Oxford University Press | year = 1991}}</ref> An oxidation state of -2 has also been reported in 2008.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1021/om701189e}}</ref> Tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow [[tungsten trioxide|tungstic oxide]], WO<sub>3</sub>, which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions, WO{{su|b=4|p=2&minus;}}.

[[Tungsten carbide]]s (W<sub>2</sub>C and WC) are produced by heating powdered tungsten with [[carbon]] and are some of the hardest [[carbide]]s, with a melting point of 2770&nbsp;<U+00B0>C for WC and 2780&nbsp;<U+00B0>C for W<sub>2</sub>C. WC is an efficient [[electrical conductor]], but W<sub>2</sub>C is less so. Tungsten carbide behaves similarly to unalloyed tungsten and is resistant to chemical attack, although it reacts strongly with [[chlorine]] to form [[tungsten hexachloride]] (WCl<sub>6</sub>).<ref name="daintith"/>

Aqueous tungstate solutions are noted for the formation of heteropoly acids and [[polyoxometalate]] [[anion]]s under neutral and acidic conditions. As tungstate is progressively treated with acid, it first yields the soluble, [[metastable]] "paratungstate A" [[anion]], {{chem|W|7|O}}{{su|b=24|p=6&minus;}}, which over time converts to the less soluble "paratungstate B" anion, {{chem|H|2|W|12|O}}{{su|b=42|p=10&minus;}}.<ref name="SmithBJ">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bradley J.|year=2000|title=Quantitative Determination of Sodium Metatungstate Speciation by 183W N.M.R.

The metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten-[[oxygen]] [[octahedron|octahedra]] known as the [[Keggin structure|Keggin]] anion. Many other polyoxometalate anions exist as metastable species. The inclusion of a different atom such as [[phosphorus]] in place of the two central [[hydrogen]]s in metatungstate produces a wide variety of [[heteropoly acid]]s, such as [[phosphotungstic acid]] H<sub>3</sub>PW<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>.

==Biological role==
Tungsten is an [[essential nutrient]] for some bacteria. For example, [[enzyme]]s called [[oxidoreductase]]s use tungsten similarly to [[molybdenum]] by using it in a tungsten-[[pterin]] complex. These enzymes reduce free carboxylic acids to aldehydes. <ref name="tungsten_orgs">{{cite book|last=Lassner|first=Erik|title=Tungsten: Properties, Chemistry, Technology of the Element, Alloys and Chemical Compounds|publisher=Springer|year=1999|pages=409<U+2013>411|isbn=0306450534|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=foLRISkt9gcC&pg=PA409&lpg=PA409&dq=tungsten+nutrient+organisms&source=web&ots=-rtHF9sWBY&sig=CoCD7Wp0HS-QRzQEoiPCisLaP04&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result}}</ref>.

In soil, tungsten metal oxidizes to the [[tungstate]] anion.  It may substitute for [[molybdenum]] in certain [[enzyme]]s, and in such cases the resulting enzyme would be inert.  The soil's chemistry determines how the tungsten polymerizes; [[alkaline]] soils cause monomeric tungstates; [[acidic]] soils cause polymeric tungstates.<ref>[[Chemical & Engineering News]], 19 Jan. 2009, "Unease over Tungsten", p. 63</ref>

[[Sodium tungstate]] and [[lead]] have been studied for their effect on [[earthworm]]s.  Lead was found to be lethal at low levels and sodium tungstate was much less toxic, but the tungstate completely inhibited their [[Reproduction|reproductive ability]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = Tungsten effects on survival, growth, and reproduction in the earthworm, eisenia fetida| author = Inouye, L.

==Production==
[[Image:Tungsten (mined)2.PNG|thumb|right|Tungsten output in 2005]]
Tungsten is found in the [[mineral]]s [[wolframite]] ([[iron]]-[[manganese]] tungstate, FeW[[oxygen|O]]<sub>4</sub>/MnWO<sub>4</sub>), [[scheelite]] ([[calcium]] tungstate, (CaWO<sub>4</sub>), [[ferberite]] and [[h<U+00FC>bnerite]]. These are mined and used to produce about 37,400 tons of tungsten concentrates per year in 2000.<ref name="production">{{cite news|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/680400.pdf|title=Tungsten|last=Shedd|first=Kim B.|year=2000|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2008-06-18|format=PDF}}</ref> [[China]] produced over 75% of this total, with most of the remaining production coming from [[Austria]], [[Bolivia]], [[Portugal]], and [[Russia]].<ref name="production"/>

Tungsten is extracted from its ores in several stages.  The ore is eventually converted to [[tungsten(VI) oxide]] (WO<sub>3</sub>), which is heated with [[hydrogen]] or [[carbon]] to produce powdered tungsten.<ref name="SaundersN">{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nigel|title=Tungsten and the Elements of Groups 3 to 7 (The Periodic Table)|publisher=Heinemann Library|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]]|month=February | year=2004|isbn=1403435189}}</ref> It can be used in that state or pressed into solid bars.

Tungsten can also be extracted by hydrogen reduction of [[Tungsten hexafluoride|WF<sub>6</sub>]]:

:WF<sub>6</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub> <U+2192> W + 6 HF

or [[pyrolysis|pyrolytic decomposition]]:<ref name="manny"/>

:WF<sub>6</sub> <U+2192> W + 3 F<sub>2</sub> (<U+0394>H<sub>r</sub> = +)

Tungsten prices are tracked on the London Metals exchange.  The price for pure metal is around $20,075 per tonne as of October 2008.<ref>{{cite web| title = Metal Bulletin | url = http://www.mineralprices.com| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>

==Applications==
[[Image:Tungsten filament in halogen lamp.JPG|thumb|Closeup of a tungsten filament inside a [[halogen lamp]].]]
Because it retains its strength at high temperatures and has a high [[melting point]], elemental tungsten is used in many high-temperature applications,<ref>{{cite book| author = DeGarmo, E. Paul | title = Materials and Processes in Manufacturing, 5th ed. | publisher = New York: MacMillan Publishing | year = 1979}}</ref> such as [[light bulb]], [[cathode-ray tube]], and [[vacuum tube]] filaments, [[heating element]]s, and [[rocket engine]] nozzles.<ref name="albert"/> Its high melting point also makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high-temperature uses such as electrical, heating, and welding applications, notably in the [[gas tungsten arc welding]] process (also called tungsten inert gas -TIG- welding).

Due to its conductive properties, as well as its relative chemical inertia, tungsten is also used in [[electrode]]s, and in the emitter tips in electron-beam instruments that use [[field emission gun]]s, such as [[electron microscope]]s. In electronics, tungsten is used as an interconnect material in [[integrated circuit]]s, between the [[silicon dioxide]] [[dielectric]] material and the transistors. It is used in metallic films, which replace the wiring used in conventional electronics with a coat of tungsten (or [[molybdenum]]) on [[silicon]].<ref name="manny">{{cite book| author = Schey, John A. | title = Introduction to Manufacturing Processes, 2nd ed. | publisher = McGraw-Hill, Inc | year = 1987}}</ref>

The electronic structure of tungsten makes it one of the main sources for [[X-ray]] targets,<ref name="patent">{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6428904/description.html|title=US Patent 6428904 - X-ray target|date=[[August 6]], [[2002]]|publisher=[http://www.patentstorm.us/ PatentStorm]|accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> and also for shielding from high-energy radiations (such as in the [[radiopharmaceutical]] industry for shielding radioactive samples of [[FDG]]). Tungsten powder is used as a filler material in [[plastic]] composites, which are used as a nontoxic substitute for [[lead]] in [[bullet]]s, shot, and radiation shields. Since this element's thermal expansion is similar to [[borosilicate glass]], it is used for making glass-to-metal seals.<ref name="desu"/>

The hardness and density of tungsten are applied in obtaining [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] [[alloy]]s. A good example is [[high speed steel]], which may contain as much as 18% tungsten.<ref name="w-apps">{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1264|title=Tungsten Applications - Steel|date=2000-2008|publisher=[http://www.azom.com/ azom.com]|accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> [[Superalloy]]s containing tungsten, such as [[Hastelloy]] and [[Stellite]], are used in [[turbine]] blades and wear-resistant parts and coatings. Applications requiring its high density include [[heat sink]]s, weights, counterweights, ballast keels for yachts, tail ballast for commercial aircraft, and as ballast in race cars for [[NASCAR]] and [[Formula 1]]. It is an ideal material to use as a [[bucking bar]] for [[riveting]], where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar. In armaments, tungsten, usually alloyed with [[nickel]] and [[iron]] or [[cobalt]] to form heavy alloys, is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s as an alternative to [[depleted uranium]] but may also be used in cannon shells, [[grenade]]s and [[missile]]s to create supersonic shrapnel. High-density alloys of tungsten may be used in [[darts]] (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for [[fishing lure]]s (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Some types of [[Strings (music)|strings]] for musical instruments are wound with tungsten wires. Its density, similar to that of gold, allows tungsten to be used in jewelry as an alternative to [[gold]] or [[platinum]].<ref name="albert"/> Its hardness makes it ideal for [[ring (finger)|rings]] that will resist scratching, are [[hypoallergenic]], and will not need polishing, which is especially useful in designs with a brushed finish.<ref name="popsci">{{cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2008-03/how-make-convincing-fake-gold-bars|title=How to Make Convincing Fake-Gold Bars|last=Gray|first=Theo|date=[[March 14]], [[2008]]|publisher=[[Popular Science]]|accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref>

Tungsten compounds are used in [[catalyst]]s, inorganic pigments (e.g. [[tungsten oxide]]s), and as high-temperature [[lubricant]]s ([[Tungsten(IV) sulfide|tungsten disulfide]]). [[Tungsten carbide]] (WC) is used to make wear-resistant [[abrasive]]s and cutters and knives for drills, [[circular saw]]s, [[Milling machine|milling]] and [[Lathe (metal)|turning]] tools used by the metalworking, woodworking, [[mining]], [[petroleum]] and construction industries<ref name="daintith"/> and accounts for about 60% of current tungsten consumption.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Canadian Encyclopaedia| url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008159| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref> Tungsten oxides are used in [[ceramic]] glazes and [[calcium]]/[[magnesium]] tungstates are used widely in [[fluorescent lighting]]. Crystal [[tungstate]]s are used as [[scintillator|scintillation detectors]] in [[nuclear physics]] and [[nuclear medicine]]. Other salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and [[tanning]] industries.<ref name="desu"/>
