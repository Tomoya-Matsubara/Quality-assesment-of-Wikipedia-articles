The '''Socialist Left Party''' ({{lang-no|Sosialistisk Venstreparti}}, {{lang-sme|Sosialistalas Gurutbellodat}}) or '''SV''', is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[left-wing]] [[political party]]. It became the fourth largest political party in Norway for the first time in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2001|2001 parliamentary election]], and has been so ever since, and at one point being one of the smalles party's in parliament. In 2005, the party managed for the first time to become a governing party, participating in the [[Red-Green Coalition]] with the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour]] and the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]], before that it was frequently turned down by the Labour Party.

Founded in 1973 as the ''[[Socialist Electoral League]]'', an electoral coalition with the [[Communist Party of Norway|Communist Party]], [[Socialist People's Party (Norway)|Socialist People's Party]], [[Information Committee of the Labour Movement against Norwegian membership in the European Community|Democratic Socialists <U+2013> AIK]] and independent socialists; in 1975 the coalition was turned into an electoral party. While currently having the official ideology of [[Democratic socialism|democratic]] [[socialism]], the party has also increasingly profiled itself on support for [[pro-feminism]] and [[environmental policy]], a call for stronger [[public sector]], more [[Mixed economy|government involvement in the economy]] and a strengthening of the [[social welfare]] net. Since 1997 the moderate faction of the party has held the leading positions.

Currently the party has over 9500 members and is facing the same problem as other major parties in Norway having difficulties with the steady decrease in membership, with the Labour<ref>{{cite news | title = Lettvint fra Lahlum | page = 36 | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | author = [[Helga Pedersen  (Norway)|Pedersen, Helga]] | date = November 3, 2009 }}</ref> and the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] being the only parties to experience a steady continuous increase in membership.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Carl_I_Hagen/utdypning | title = Carl I Hagen | publisher = [[Store Norske Leksikon|Store Norske Leksikon.no]] | first = Gudleiv | last = Forr | authorlink = Gudleiv Forr | accessdate = March 20, 2010 }}</ref> The current leader of the Socialist Left is [[Kristin Halvorsen]], who has been the party's candidate for [[Prime Minister of Norway]] since the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2001|2001 parliamentary election]].

== Ideology ==
===Position===
The Socialist Left is a left-wing party like both of its predecessors, the [[Socialist People's Party (Norway)|Socialist People's Party]] and the [[Information Committee of the Labour Movement against Norwegian membership in the European Community]], which favours the [[welfare state]] and taxation upon the wealthy. Former leader of the Socialist People's Party, [[Finn Gustavsen]], believed that the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]] were not [[socialists]], and the only socialist force in parliament were members from the [[Socialist Electoral League]]. He was one of the main opponents of Norwegian membership in the [[European Community]] (EC), saying the organization showed how "evil and stupid" [[capitalism]] really was.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Finn Gustavsen|Gustavsen, Finn]] | title = Finn Gustavsen | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = November 1, 2009 | page = 4 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> According to their official webpage, this is a belief the party still holds.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.sv.no/Forside/Siste-nytt/Innlegg/Nei-siden-trenger-SV-i-regjering | title = Nei-siden trenger SV i regjering| publisher = SV.no | first = Robert | last = Kippe | date = September 4, 2009 | accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> According to a measurement poll done in 2002, one out of four members in the Socialist Left wanted Norway to join the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web | title = <U+00C9>n av fire i SV sier ja til EU | work = [[Aftenposten]] | author = Salvesen, Geir| date = February 18, 2002 | page = 4 | accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref>

During the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2001|2001 parliamentary election]], the party's election program stated that the party was a "socialist party" with a vision of a Norway without social injustice.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = Sosialistisk framgang men kva s<U+00E5>? | work = [[Klassekampen]]  | date = September 11, 2009 | page = | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> Since its inception, the party has continued promoting itself as socialists.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = <U+00AB>Sosialistene<U+00BB> Ap-SV-Sp | work = [[Adresseavisen]]  | date = June 6, 2005 | page = 23 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> In later years, the party has been portrayed as "[[Social democracy|social democrats]]" by the Norwegian left and [[right-wing]] media,<ref>{{cite web | date = August 17, 2009 | author = <U+00D8>slie, Jan-Erik | url = http://www.frifagbevegelse.no/dagens_kommentar/article4521257.ece | title = "Det blir ikke revolusjon i <U+00E5>r heller" | publisher = [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions|Frifagbevegelse.no]] | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 18, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date = September 16, 2003 | author = Christensen, Per Aage Pleym | url = http://www.liberaleren.no/2003/09/16/populistene-vant-ansvaret-tapte/ | title = Populistene vant, ansvaret tapte. | publisher = Liberaleren.no | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 18, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date = March 5, 2003 | author = Aab<U+00F8>, Stein | url = http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2003/03/05/363153.html | title = R<U+00F8>de tall smitter | work = [[Dagbladet]] |accessdate = December 18, 2009 | language = Norwegian }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date = June 9, 2004 | author = Lode, Veslem<U+00F8>y | url = http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/article109244.ece?service=articlePrint | title = R<U+00F8>de Oslo-folk | language = Norwegian | work = [[Dagsavisen]] |accessdate = December 18, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date = June 5, 2005 | author = Ulstein, Hege | url = http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/article264809.ece?service=articlePrint | title = H<U+00E5>per SV og Ap blir ett parti etter samarbeid | work = [[Dagsavisen]] | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 18, 2009 }}</ref> and as [[democratic socialist]]s.<ref>{{cite news | author = Larsen, Christiane Jordheim; Sj<U+00F8>li, Hans Petter | title = Kamp: SVs venstrefl<U+00F8>y g<U+00E5>r | work = [[Klassekampen]]  | date = November 14, 2009 | page = 4 | language = Norwegian|accessdate = December 18, 2009 }}</ref> The party has also been categorized as an [[eco-socialist]] party by media abroad.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parties-and-elections.de/norway.html|title = Norway|publisher = Parties and Elections in Europe|accessdate = December 18, 2009 }}</ref> The present [[deputy leader]], [[Audun Lysbakken]], is a self-proclaimed [[revolutionary]], socialist and [[marxist]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Johansen, Marianne; Thun<U+00E6>s, Bj<U+00F8>rn | url = http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=110048 |title = SV-nestleder vil fjerne b<U+00F8>rsen Vil ogs<U+00E5> ta makten fra R<U+00F8>kke og Spetalen | date = November 29, 2005 | work = [[Verdens Gang]] |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> While still a self-proclaimed marxist and revolutionary, he believed the party to be a democratic socialist one.<ref>{{cite news | author = Johansen, Marianne; Thun<U+00E6>s, Bj<U+00F8>rn; Mosveen, Eirik | page = 17 | title = Illsint Siv Jensen | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = September 30, 2009 | accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref>

====Education====
[[File:B<U+00E5>rd Vegar Solhjell 05.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Solhjell was Minister of Education and Research before Halvorsen took over the office]]
Education has been one of main campaign issues since Kristin Halvorsen became party leader.<ref>{{cite web | author = | title = SV tror p<U+00E5> minst 10 prosent velgeroppslutning | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | date = August 4, 2001 | page = | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 20, 2010 }}</ref> [[<U+00D8>ystein Djupedal]] was elected [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research|Minister of Education and Research]], and held that position for two years.<ref>{{stortingetbio|OKD}} February 20, 2010.</ref> He was replaced by fellow Socialist Left politician, [[B<U+00E5>rd Vegar Solhjell]].<ref>{{stortingetbio|BVS}} February 20, 2010.</ref> Kristin Halvorsen took over the ministry in late 2009.<ref>{{stortingetbio|KHA}} February 21, 2010.</ref> The first assignment of Djupedal while still in office, was granting {{NOK|10 million}} to "even out social differences" between [[ethnic minorities]]. The party believes that everyone has the right to free access to [[kindergarten]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Halvorsen, Bj<U+00F8>rn Egil | title = <U+00D8>ystein Djupedal gir 10 millioner i startpakke | work = [[Dagsavisen]] | date = November 15, 2005 | page = 10 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 20, 2010 }}</ref> [[Anders Folkestad]], leader of the [[Confederation of Unions for Professionals, Norway|Confederation of Unions for Professionals]], was not pleased with Djupedals efforts during his term in office, saying; "Djupedal has created much uncertainty and a mess after he became Minister of Education and Research. Many had great expectations, but he is sure lagging behind from the time when he was a sideliner". Djupedal, since taking office, was heavily criticised by the Norwegian media for his controversial and bizarre statements.<ref>{{cite web | author = Holmelid, Kristin | title = Mageplask p<U+00E5> mageplask av Djupedal; fakta/minister i minefelt | work = [[Bergens Tidende]] | date = November 30, 2005 | page = 7 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 20, 2010 }}</ref> In late 2005, it was estimated that students studying general, business and administrative studies would save up to {{NOK|11,978}} under the [[Red-Green Coalition]], seeing as [[school book]]s became free when the coalition took power.<ref name="senere">{{cite web | author = Veslem<U+00F8>y, Lode; Larsen-Vonstett, <U+00D8>ystein | title = Din Nye Hverdag | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = September 13, 2005 | page = 8 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 20, 2010 }}</ref>

The party wants to reduce the number of [[private school]]s, with Djupedal claiming them to be of no use.<ref>{{cite web | author = Natland, Jarle | title = Ny kunnskapsminister:- L<U+00E6>reren er viktigst i den norske skolen | work = [[Stavanger Aftenblad]] | date = October 24, 2005 | page = 8 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 20, 2010 }}</ref> In a later more thorough interview, Solhjell believed government funded schools helped "smoothing social inequality". He further stated; "Many of those who remain outside the labor market have received lack of training from school. It prevents them from contributing to the community. Parties on the right often confuse [[social security]] and welfare schemes as the problem; however we tend to look at why they are struggling. There are systematic connections between social background and lack of training - it is a class question where something is needed to be done."<ref>{{cite web | author = Bredeveien, Jo Moen | title = <U+2013> Problemet er <U+00AB>kenguruskolen<U+00BB> | work = [[Dagsavisen]] | date = February 25, 2009 | url = http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/article400435.ece | language = Norwegian |accessdate = March 17, 2010 }}</ref> However, others believe that the party should [[nationalize]] non-public schools. [[Torbj<U+00F8>rn Urfjell]], former leader of the [[Socialist Youth (Norway)|Socialist Youth]] chapter in [[Vest-Agder]], said; "School and adolescence is too important to be left to the market. Therefore, they should be taken back".<ref>{{cite web | author = Lorentsen, Olaf  | title = Het debatt om utdanning | work = [[F<U+00E6>drelandsvennen]] | date = September 7, 2005 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 20, 2010 }}</ref> During the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 election]], the party promised to increase resources to [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s, believing that more money would provide fewer pupils per teacher, and thus more individualized and personal instructions.<ref>{{cite web | author = Beck, Christian W. | title = Friskoler som ideal | work = [[Dagbladet]] | date = December 22, 2005 | page = 34 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 20, 2010 }}</ref>{{-}}

==== The environment ====
[[File:Kristin Halvorsen - World Economic  Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008.jpg|left|thumb|Halvorsen said the environmental policies of the Red-Green Coalition were among the "most radical in Europe"]]
[[Erik Solheim]] has since 2005 held the office of [[Minister of the Environment (Norway)|Minister of the Environment]], taking over the office from fellow Socialist Left member [[Helen Bj<U+00F8>rn<U+00F8>y]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = Vi m<U+00E5> f<U+00F8>rst ha kunnskap | work = [[Stavanger Aftenblad]] | date = February 4, 2010 | page = 26 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 6, 2010 }}</ref> During the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 parliamentary election]], the party promoted itself as the "biggest" and "strongest" [[green party]] in Norway. The party struggled, despite the strong focus on the [[green movement]] and [[global warming]] by the public, the party failed to gather new voters and instead looked at one of there worst elections in years.<ref name="ett"/> By August 2009, varuous opinion polls gave the party 10%, the party however lost most of its voters to the Labour Party during the last days of the election.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = SV i siget p<U+00E5> ny meningsm<U+00E5>ling | work = [[Kommunal Rapport]] | date = August 31, 2009 | page = | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 6, 2010}}</ref> The party was highly vocal against [[oil drilling in Lofoten and Vester<U+00E5>len]] during their election campaign, which led to the short-time revival mentioned previously.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = Delseier til SV | work = [[Dagbladet]] | date = September 27, 2009 | page = 2 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 6, 2010}}</ref> However, a large minority within the party are opposed by the conservation plan, with the majority of them coming from [[Nordland]]; the county where the drilling is taking place.<ref>{{cite news | author = Nedreb<U+00F8>, Rune | title = SV-arar opne for retrett om oljeboring i Lofoten | work = [[Stavanger Aftenblad]] | date = September 24, 2009 | pages = 12<U+2013>13 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 6, 2010}}</ref>

The party's strong emphasize on [[green politics]] and its failure in capturing new voters, has led to debate among electoral researchers. [[Frank Aarbot]] when commenting on the situation, said; "it is interesting that both the Socialist Left and the Liberals has this bad turnout, when the environmental conference is taking place in Copenhagen".<ref name="ett">{{cite news | author = Skard, Kristian | title = Milj<U+00F8>partiene sliter med troverdigheten | work = [[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] | date = December 17, 2009 | page = 20 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 6, 2010}}</ref> Halvorsen felt the environmental policies of the [[Soria Moria II|second Soria Moria declaration]] showed a clear level of commitment from the party's coalition partners. She called the environmental policies of the government one of the "most radical in Europe".<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = SV: Milj<U+00F8> gjennomsyrer hele plattformen | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | date = October 7, 2009 | page = | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 6, 2010 }}</ref>

==== Feminism ====
[[File:Audun Lysbakken 2009.jpg|right|thumb|Lysbakken as seen on February 12, 2009]]
In later years, the party has promoted itself as a [[feminist]] party.<ref>{{cite news | author = H<U+00E5>land, Asta Beate | title = Kvinner og andre minoriteter | work = [[Klassekampen]]  | date = December 31, 2005 | page = | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 21, 2009 }}</ref> In one of the Socialist Left's brochures published in 2005, it said "The Socialist Left is a feminist party. We are fighting for a society where women and men have equal opportunities. This means that women should earn as much as men, that there must be more women in the top positions and that there are welfare schemes that provide equality in the workplace".<ref>{{cite news | author = St<U+00F8>, Ane | title = Damenes vals? | work = [[Klassekampen]]  | date = September 26, 2005 | page = | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 21, 2009 }}</ref> During the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], one of the four main issues raised by party's youth wing was fighting against [[sexual harassment]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Ueland, Margunn; Minge, Anders| title = Tar opp seksuell trakassering i skolen i debatt | work = [[Stavanger Aftenblad]]  | date = August 28, 2005 | page = 5 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 21, 2009 }}</ref> In January 2005 ''[[Klassekampen]]'' asked 150 of the 169 representatives in parliament if they considered themselves feminist. The opinion survey showed that the Socialist Left and the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal Party]] were according to the survey the two most feminist, while The [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] became the least feminist party in parliament.<ref>{{cite news | author = Thorenfeldt, Gunnar | title = Feminist?

==== Immigration ====
In 1992, [[Carl I. Hagen]] of the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]], accused the party of supporting [[free immigration]] to Norway, after a proposal made by [[Lisbeth Holand]]. She wanted to give immigrants from non-European countries the same immigration policies as immigrants who have their origins from countries who are members of the [[European Economic Area]]. While Hagen was highly critical, she felt that it would offer housing and job for non-Europeans who needed it.<ref>{{cite news | author = | page = 10 | title = Ingen st<U+00F8>tte til <U+00F8>kt innvandring | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = December 3, 1992 | accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> In an opinion poll, it showed that 82.9% of the Socialist Left members were open to more immigration, making the party the most immigrant-friendly party in parliament, but less than the non-parliamentary [[Red Electoral Alliance]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Salvesen, Geir | title = Flertall for mer jobb-innvandring | page = 37 | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = March 6, 1999 | accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> In a measurement done before [[New Years Eve]] in 2009, the Socialist Left became again the party least hostile to immigrants, this time behind the newly-established party [[Red (Norway)|Red]].<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = Frykten for islam Det er ingen annen farbar vei inn i det nye <U+00E5>ret enn | page = 2 | work = [[F<U+00E6>drelandsvennen]] | date = December 31, 2009 | accessdate = January 3, 2009 }}</ref>

Another poll showed that almost one third of Socialist Left voters would not want to live in an area with a high share of immigrants. Social geographer Karl Fredrik Tangen responded that it is easy for the typical intellectual Socialist Left voter, living in [[upper class]] areas, to agree to a, for them, hypothetical question.<ref>{{ cite news | url = http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/oslo/article3443552.ece | title = Nei til flerkulturelt nabolag | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = December 30, 2009 | first = Andreas | last = Slettholm | accessdate = February 6, 2010}}</ref> Recent surveys also show that the support for the party by immigrants plummeted from 25% in 2005, to 6% in 2009. [[Somali people|Somali]] author [[Amal Aden]] explained that "we do not earn anything from the policies of the Socialist Left. They say that everyone is okay, and that does not work".<ref>{{ cite news | url = http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/valg/article2700203.ece | title = Innvandrere svikter SV | work = [[Nettavisen]] | date = September 4, 2009 | accessdate = February 6, 2010 }}</ref>

The party is open to more immigration, believing Norway will evolve into a more [[multiculturalism|multicultural society]]. The party openly believes the only way to create [[social equality]] is to create ethnic equality in Norway.<ref>{{cite news | author = Haugan, Bj<U+00F8>rn | title = Innvandring | page = | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = September 9, 1997 | accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> By 2009, Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] said his government would tighten the then-present immigration policy, which would make it harder for immigrants to be granted asylum in Norway. The Socialist Left, along with the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal Party]] and the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]], felt the new policy was too strict.<ref>{{cite news | author = Kristoffersen, Svein | title = Ap og Frp enige om asylinnstramning | page = 13 | work = [[Klassekampen]] | date = March 14, 2009 | accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref>

The military action in [[Kosovo]] was a controversial issue within the party; the party leadership supported the military interventionism saying the [[ethnic cleansing]] in Kosovo had to be stopped. The support included Kristin Halvorsen, who favored [[NATO]]'s air strikes, but a large group within the party vehemently opposed such support arguing that violence would only lead to more violence.<ref>{{cite web | author = Harbo, Hilde; Johansen, Per Anders | title = Halvorsen og Solheim trosser eget parti | url = http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/kosovo/d74732.htm | work = [[Aftenposten]]  | date = March 25, 1999 | page = | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 21, 2009 }}</ref> The party's chapter in [[Akershus]] called the attack a "NATO led terrorist bombing" and believed the bombing marked the the first time that Norway had declared war on another nation.

==Organization and structure==
===Organs===
The party is split into five different power organs; the first being the [[national convention]] held every second year, the Country Board, the [[Central Committee]], Municipal and Local Chapters and the Party Representatives.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.sv.no/Forside/Partiet/Partiets-organer|title=Partiets organer |publisher=SV.no|date=|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref> The national convention works as a democratic body for the party, were members representing there county or municipal can elect new national representatives for the party, one example of this is the [[party leader]] who stands for election every second year.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.sv.no/Forside/Partiet/Partiets-organer/Landsmote-2009|title=Landsm<U+00F8>te 2009|publisher=SV.no|date=|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref> 

The Country Board is the party's higest decision-making body in the years seperating the national conventions. The Board consists of 19 members elected by each county, six members are directly elected during the national convention, and the permanent members of the Country Board. In total there are 36 members. The board meets approximately six times a year to deal with current political and organizational issues. Among the countries the board task is to adopt the party's budget, and to select the party's permanent political representatives.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.sv.no/Forside/Partiet/Partiets-organer/Landsstyret|title=Landsstyret|publisher=SV.no|date=|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref> The Central Committee manages the party in the interime period of the Country Board meetings. Members of the board are elected by the national convention, and consists of the [[party leader]], the two [[deputy leader]]s, [[party secretary]], [[parliamentary leader]], leader of the [[Socialist Youth (Norway)|Socialist Youth]] and five other members. The board holds meetings every [[Monday]], with some exceptions.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.sv.no/Forside/Partiet/Partiets-organer/Sentralstyret|title=Sentralstyret|publisher=SV.no|date=|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref> The Municipal and Local Chapters organ works as "communication" body between the chapters and the national party.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.sv.no/SV-der-du-bor|title=Fylke- og lokallagsinndeling|publisher=SV.no|date=|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref>

The last body, the Party's Representative organ consists of nine national party offices that serves as an advisory body for the party. The offices work alongside the party's [[parliamentary group]], the government apparatus and the rest of the party organization of its legal fields, and also have contact with organizations and communities in their local area. The offices normally meet four to six times a year, and consists of party members from all over the country with any special expertise. The offices are elected by the national convention.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.sv.no/Forside/Partiet/Partiets-organer/Utvalg|title=Utvalg|publisher=SV.no|date=|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref>

===Offices===
In total, there are twelve party offices which all have there office in the party's headquarter in Akersgate 35, Oslo. These offices are the main administrative organs of the party. The headquarter is open from Monday to Friday from 8.30 AM to 16 PM.

After losing all its parliamentary seats in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1969|1969 parliamentary election]], the [[Socialist People's Party (Norway)|Socialist People's Party]] sought to create an election coalition between various left-wing parties.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = Farvel til SF | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = September 9, 1969 | page = 2 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> While previously being sceptical of working with the [[Communist Party of Norway]], the party eventually became a member of the coalition along with the [[Information Committee of the Labour Movement against Norwegian membership in the European Community]] and various non-party aligned independent socialists.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = Allianser og perspektiver | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = April 18, 1973 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> [[Reidar T. Larsen]], leader of the Communist Party, said the members who met up at the party's [[national convention]] unanimously elected "yes" to be a member of the coalition, which would later go by the name of the Socialist Electoral League.<ref name="SocValg">{{cite news | author = | title = Sosialistisk Valgforbund | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = April 13, 1973 | page = 6 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref>

It took 16 days to negotiate a settlement between the groups. The members agreed that this coalition would be the only way of getting a "socialist government" in Norway.<ref name="SocValg"/> By 1973, the Labour Party had suffered a decrease in popular support, which at that time was estimated to around 100 thousand. Many speculations arose that these voters had left the Labour Party for the newly created Socialist Electoral League.<ref name="lostvotestoSV">{{cite news | author = Norvik, Erling | title = De Borgerlige Krefter M<U+00E5> Samles | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = April 16, 1973 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> Early predictions by the Labour Party believed that the Electoral League would dissolve itself because of internal strife. [[Reiulf Steen]] later stated that he had more "respect" for the [[Maoist]] party, the [[Red Electoral Alliance]] than the Electoral League.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = Fjerde gang gjelder det | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = August 23, 1973 | page = 5 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> The coalition managed to gain 11.2% of the popular vote and 16 seats in parliament in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1973|1973 parliamentary election]].<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = Sp<U+00F8>rsm<U+00E5>l og svar | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = March 23, 2007 | page = 2 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> 

The party now known as the Socialist Left was founded in 1975. The Communist Party did not want to dissolve itself to become a member of the Socialist Left Party, and therefore voted against membership. This led to an internal struggle within the party, with the party's official newspaper, ''[[Friheten]]'', strongly suggesting the party cannot dissolve itself, because it would mean the death of the [[revolutionary]] movement. The official newspaper of the Socialist People's Party, ''[[Orientering]]'', attacked what they called the "hard-core" leaders of the Communist Party.<ref>{{cite news | author = Stemland, Jens Henrik | title = Orientering trommer til kamp| work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = June 21, 1975 | page = 4 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref> Without the Communist Party, the other parties voted to dissolve the coalition and to replace it with a political party.<ref>{{cite news | author = | title = Fakta om Sosialistisk Venstreparti | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]]  | date = October 20, 2000 | page = | language = Norwegian |accessdate = December 19, 2009 }}</ref>

=== Early years (1976<U+2013>1997)===
[[File:Erik Solheim juni 09 A.jpg|thumb|right|[[Erik Solheim]], party leader from 1987<U+2013>1997, as seen in June 2009]]
The first years were not successful, as the party lost many of its seats in Parliament,<ref name="<U+00E5>ttinitotusenogni"/><ref name="secondelection"/> but under the leadership of [[Berge Furre]] during the 1980s, the party's popularity rose again.<ref name="<U+00E5>ttinitotusenogni"/> At the same time, internal conflicts within the party escalated, with rumours claiming that then sitting [[deputy leader]] [[Steinar Stjern<U+00F8>]] was trying to throw out the [[social democratic]] wing of the party.<ref>{{cite news | author = Kleivan, Kare; Iversen, Arne | title = ''Klassekampen'' lanseres fraksjonskamp i SV | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = September 11, 1976 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian |accessdate = February 24, 2010 }}</ref> A more serious problem for the party was that two of the party's [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] had been [[legal purge in Norway after World War II|convicted of country betrayal]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]], the most notable being [[Hanna Kvanmo]].

In the beginning of the 1990s, under [[Erik Solheim]], its popularity again declined,<ref name="manyelections"/> and losing most of its no to EU voters to the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]], when the party again fought actively against Norwegian membership in the [[European Union]], and when [[Norwegian EU referendum, 1994|Norwegians again voted against membership in a referendum]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Fred of forsoning for SV | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | author = Wettrejohnsen, Egil | date = November 29, 1994 | page = | accessdate = February 21, 2010 }}</ref> Solheim's tenure as leader<U+2014>while praised by some<U+2014>was seen as very controversial. The socialist wing in the party, the "Museum Guardians" as they were called, were worried that Solheim was moving the party to much to the [[centrism|centre]]. Outside critics of Solheim said his policies had led to a "grey-blue social democratic" party with little or no differences from the Labour Party. Solheim also tried to re-orientate the party's aim, wanting it to form a coalition government with the Labour and the Centre Party.<ref>{{cite web | title = Stormfullt partnerskap | work = [[Aftenposten]] | author = Spence, Thomas | date = June 8, 1995 | page = 19 | accessdate = March 20, 2010 }}</ref> Solheim was forced to resign in 1997, with the party seeing him as the main reason for the new power struggle within the party; now between the left and right-wing faction of the party.<ref>{{cite web | title = SV: Et n<U+00F8>dvendig lederskifte | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | author = Kristoffersen, Svein | date = April 24, 1997 | page = | accessdate = March 20, 2010 }}</ref>

=== Early leadership of Halvorsen (1997<U+2013>2005)===
With the election of Kristin Halvorsen as new party leader in 1997, the party's popularity rose again. Under her leadership, the main focus for the party became education, and the slogan "children and youth first" was coined.<ref>{{cite web | title = Valg97 SV vil snu valgkampen: - En uke med barn og ungdom f<U+00F8>rst | work = [[Aftenposten]] | author = Berit, Aalborg | date = September 8, 1997 | page = 2 | accessdate = February 21, 2010 }}</ref> The party steadily built up its voter base during the Labour [[Stoltenberg's First Cabinet]] which moved the Labour Party more to centre<U+2014>involving the [[privatization]] of government-held assets. This led to a historic high voter turnout for the Socialist Left, earning 12.5% of the national vote in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2001|2001 election]]. On the other side, the Labour Party earned a record-low turnout, earning only 24.3% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web | title = Stoltenberg sitter p<U+00E5> oppsigelse | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | author = Kristoffersen, Svein | date = September 11, 2001 | page = | accessdate = March 20, 2010 }}</ref> The turnout only worsened the inner struggle within the party, with party leader [[Thorbj<U+00F8>rn Jagland]] and [[Jens Stoltenberg]] using there time accusing each other. At the same time, the right-wing faction of the party wanted the party to continue to move further to the centre, while the left-wing faction wanted to move the party closer to the Socialist Left.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ap i gang med oppvasken | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | author = <U+00D8>verby, Arve | date = September 20, 2001 | page = 2 | accessdate = March 20, 2010 }}</ref> By early 2005, various opinion measurement polls showed that over 20% of Norwegian voters would vote for the Socialist Left.<ref>{{cite web | title = Den st<U+00F8>rste utfordringen | work = [[Ny Tid]] | author = Horn, Anders | date = April 1, 2005 | url = http://www.nytid.no/arkiv/artikler/20050331/den_storste_utfordringen/ | accessdate = March 20, 2010 }}</ref>

[[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]] from the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]] believed the three parties were "unclear" and "vague" when talking about the Red-Green Coalition idealogical and political position. However, after discussing the [[state budget of Norway|national budget]] with the Socialist Left and the Centre Party, Jens Stoltenberg agreed with Halvorsen that they needed to create a free [[day care]] service for everyone.<ref>{{cite news | page = 9 | title = Vil ha avtale f<U+00F8>r valget | author = Krossli, Jan Inge | date = January 28, 2005 | work = [[Dagsavisen]] | language = Norwegian | accessdate = January 7, 2010 }}</ref> By February 2005, an opinion poll measurement gave the coalition 96 of 169 seats in parliament, with the Socialist Left increasing with 3.9%.<ref>{{cite news | page = | title = Rekordm<U+00E5>ling for de r<U+00F8>dgr<U+00F8>nne | author = | date = February 22, 2005 | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | language = Norwegian | accessdate = January 7, 2010 }}</ref> Later in February, a small faction within the party called the future coalition the Red-Grey Coalition, believing the environmental policies of the Labour and the Centre Party were not "radical enough".<ref>{{cite news | page = | title = SV frykter at r<U+00F8>dgr<U+00F8>nn kan bli r<U+00F8>dgr<U+00E5> | author = Olsen, Einar | date = February 12, 2005 | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | language = Norwegian | accessdate = January 7, 2010 }}</ref> 

Before the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], Deputy Leader [[<U+00D8>ystein Djupedal]] said that the Socialist Left would not contribute to any radical changes if they earned a position within the government.<ref>{{cite news | page = | title = Ingen br<U+00E5> endringer med SV i regjering | author = | date = August 23, 2005 | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | language = Norwegian | accessdate = January 7, 2010 }}</ref> [[Erna Solberg]], leader of the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]], accused the party of being "[[communist]]", because some of its present and earlier connections to communist organizations around Europe.<ref>{{cite news | page = | title = Beskylder SV for <U+00E5> v<U+00E6>re i Kommunist-Selskap | author = Johansen, Marianne; Mosveen, Eirik; Johansen Bjarne, Alf; V<U+00E5>genes, Hallgeir | date = August 28, 2005 | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | language = Norwegian | accessdate = January 7, 2010 }}</ref> By early August, the Socialist Left was the party having the most progress in the opinion polls, but around 17% of who voted the Socialist Left previously was unsure what party they would vote for in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 election]].<ref>{{cite news | page = | title = SV best inn i valgkampen | author = Horn, Anders | date = August 5, 2005 | work = [[Klassekampen]] | language = Norwegian | accessdate = January 7, 2010 }}</ref> However, by late August the party was labelled one of the "big losers" in the election, along with the Conservative Party.

In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 parliamentary election]], the party lost four seats and was left with 11, but a three-seat gain by the Labour Party secured the Red-Green Coalition an 86<U+2013>83 majority. The shift of power within the coalition resulted in losing one Socialist Left cabinet minister, leaving them with four, the same as the Centre Party. The Socialist Left and Halvorsen conceded the influential Department of Finance to the Labour Party in order to keep control of the Ministry of Education and Research.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article3325486.ece | title = Halvorsen g<U+00E5>r av som finansminister | last = Halvorsen Kemp | first = Ida | coauthors = Hegtun, Halvor | date = October 18, 2009 | work = [[Aftenposten]] | language = Norwegian | accessdate = January 7, 2010 }}</ref>
