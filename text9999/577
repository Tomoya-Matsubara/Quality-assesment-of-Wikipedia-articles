They are the first of the traditional Pok<U+00E9>mon role-playing games for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[video game console]]. The games were earlier released in [[Japan]] in [[2006 in video gaming|2006]]. ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Pearl'' had the most successful launch week of games in the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' series in Japan, and the best launch week for any Nintendo DS game in Japan.<ref name="sales">{{ja icon}}{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/10/03/103,1159869995,61194,0,0.html|title=Famitsu - Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pok<U+00E9>mon Pearl record sales|publisher=[[Famitsu]]|date=[[2006-10-03]]|accessdate=2006-10-04}}</ref> Additionally, the games set the record of being the fastest selling ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games in Japan within three months of sales.<ref name="5_million_copies">{{ja icon}}{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/12/27/103,1167202517,65081,0,0.html|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl reach 5 million units in sales |publisher=Famitsu|date=[[2006-12-27]]|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> Set in the fictional region of [[Sinnoh]], the games cover the adventure of a single protagonist embarking on a quest to capture and train Pok<U+00E9>mon while simultaneously thwarting the agenda of the criminal organization [[Team Galactic]].

==Setting and plot==
<!--Do not change the Pok<U+00E9>mon names in this article unless you are absolutely sure your version is official.-->
''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' are set in the region of Sinnoh, which is based upon the [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] prefecture of Japan. Sinnoh is characterized by both mountainous and snow-covered areas, and contains three lakes central to the plot.

The game contains 107 new Pok<U+00E9>mon and chronicles the adventures of a new Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer who vies to become the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon League]] Champion, collecting and training various species of Pok<U+00E9>mon along the way. As do most games in the series, ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' feature eight [[Pok<U+00E9>mon gym]]s led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type]]. Gym Leaders serve as [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] and reward skilled trainers with [[Pok<U+00E9>mon gym#Pok<U+00E9>mon Gym Badges|badges of merit]], key to the advancement of the plot.
{{spoiler}}
''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' begin in [[Sinnoh#Locations|Twinleaf Town]]. After viewing a television report about disturbances at a distant lake by a [[shiny Pok<U+00E9>mon|red]] [[Gyarados#Red Gyarados|Gyarados]], the protagonist and his/her rival travel together to investigate the local lake. They spot [[Professor Rowan]], an expert in Pok<U+00E9>mon evolution, and the protagonist<U+2019>s second rival, who is the playable character not selected. After a short discussion the pair exits from the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild [[Mukkuru]], the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice between three Pok<U+00E9>mon found in the briefcase, [[Naetle]], [[Hikozaru]] or [[Pochama]]. After defeating the Mukkuru, they return the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his/her chosen Pok<U+00E9>mon, Rowan offers it to him/her, asking that he embark on a journey and fill his/her [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]].

As the plot continues, the protagonist encounters Team Galactic, and their motives are made clear. Team Galactic captures [[Yuxie]], [[Agnome]] and [[Emrit]], of Sinnoh<U+2019>s three lakes, and imprisons them, making it the player<U+2019>s responsibility to free them. Upon releasing the trio, he/she is able to travel to the sacred shrine atop Tengan Mountain and enter the cave, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens either [[Dialga]], in ''Diamond'', or [[Palkia]] in ''Pearl''. Dialga or<!--is there a reason this <U+201C>or<U+201D> was an <U+201C>and<U+201D> before?--> Palkia<U+2019>s powers begin to <U+201C>overwhelm<U+201D> Sinnoh, causing the newly free Yuxie, Agnome and Emrit to attempt to stop it. It is then that the player is able to engage in a battle with the version-appropriate legendary Pok<U+00E9>mon.
==Gameplay==
[[Image:Dp 060615 29.gif|thumb|left|Female [[Scizor]] have larger [[abdomen]]s than males.]]
Gameplay is very similar to previous Pok<U+00E9>mon RPGs, but there are several changes and additions.

Within each species, Pok<U+00E9>mon now feature varying levels of [[sexual dimorphism|gender dimorphism]], including aspects such as differently sized or absent distinctive physical features. For example, a female [[Wooper]] has smaller antennae than its male counterpart and a male [[Scizor]] has a smaller abdomen than a female.<ref name="intro">{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond/Pearl|publisher=Serebii.net}}</ref> As in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Crystal]]'' and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald|Emerald]]'', opposing Pok<U+00E9>mon each have a short animation (e.g., a [[Geodude]] will flex its arms) when entering battle. New [[Pok<U+00E9>mon ability|abilities]], such as <U+201C>Belligerence<U+201D> and <U+201C>Natural<U+201D>, have been added. [[Baby Pok<U+00E9>mon]] in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', such as [[Roselia]]<U+2019>s pre-evolution [[Subomie]], can be found in the wild, whereas in previous generations attaining one usually required breeding. Pok<U+00E9>mon also hatch from their eggs at [[experience point#Level-based progression|Level]] 1, rather than Level 5 as in the previous games.

Pok<U+00E9>mon Contests, events where one<U+2019>s Pok<U+00E9>mon compete in a show of sorts to win ribbons, return from ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' as <U+201C>Super Contests<U+201D>, with similarities and differences.<ref name="contests" /> Super Contests consist of three rounds. In the Visual Judgment round, players utilize the Nintendo DS<U+2019>s stylus to place accessories and objects on their Pok<U+00E9>mon to appeal to a particular trait, such as <U+201C>Cool<U+201D> or <U+201C>Cute<U+201D>, and earn points. In the Dance Judgment round,  Pok<U+00E9>mon compete with opponents in a test of rhythm and balance. The final round, Performance Judgment, is identical in premise to Pok<U+00E9>mon Contests of the third generation of games; Pok<U+00E9>mon use their techniques strategically to appeal to the judges and crowd. Assuming the same role as Pok<U+00E9>blocks in the 3rd generation, a baked substance called Pofin can be made through use of the touchscreen and fed to Pok<U+00E9>mon in order to increase certain traits and, consequently, the likelihood of success in a relevant Contest.

First introduced in ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold'' and ''Silver'', ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' features sensitivity to the time of day and day of the week, which is reflected in a number of facets, such as the lighting of the [[overworld]] and locations of [[non-player character]]s, the availability of certain species of Pok<U+00E9>mon, and even the lighting during battles. The scale of the day and night cycle has grown from the original cycle of morning, day, and night; ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'''s cycle features five different time periods: morning, day, afternoon, evening and night.<ref name="time">{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/time.shtml|publisher=Serebii.net|title=The time of day|accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref>

A new device called the [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon items#Pok<U+00E9>tch|Pok<U+00E9>tch]], resembling a wristwatch, can be obtained and plays host to a wide variety of features, including a time management system, a calculator, a map, a counter, a wireless link up search, and drawing pad.<ref name="poketch">{{cite web|url=http://serebii.net/diamondpearl/poketch.shtml|publisher=Serebii.net|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond/Pearl - The Pok<U+00E9>tch}}</ref>

Below Sinnoh is a large underground area, used for [[multiplayer game|multiplayer]] gaming. Players can create and decorate <U+201C>secret bases<U+201D> (first featured in ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'') and participate in [[minigame]]s, one of which will allow the player to unearth [[fossil|fossilized]] Pok<U+00E9>mon. Initially, only one fossil can be found in each game; the <!--DO NOT CHANGE-->Shield<!--This is the correct fossil according to all available sources like Serebii.net and Bulbapedia. In the absence of a reliable source saying otherwise, LEAVE IT ALONE.--> Fossil ([[Zugaidos]]) in ''Diamond'', and the <!--DO NOT CHANGE-->Helmet<!--This is the correct fossil according to all available sources like Serebii.net and Bulbapedia. In the absence of a reliable source saying otherwise, LEAVE IT ALONE.--> Fossil (new Pok<U+00E9>mon [[Tatetops]]) in ''Pearl''. However, after unlocking the National Pok<U+00E9>dex it is possible to find the Dome Fossil ([[Kabuto (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Kabuto]]), the Helix Fossil ([[Omanyte]]), Old Amber ([[Aerodactyl]]), Claw Fossil ([[Anorith]]), or the Root Fossil ([[Lileep]]) in both versions.<ref name="secret_bases">{{cite web|url=http://serebii.net/diamondpearl/underground.shtml|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond/Pearl - Shinou Underground|publisher=Serebii.net|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>

''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' employ support for the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], allowing players to trade, battle and communicate through <U+201C>[[voice chat]]<U+201D> online.<ref name="voicechat" /> The main system for trade is the Global Trade Station trading system. This allows trainers to search for any Pok<U+00E9>mon they have seen on a worldwide scale, with the resulting list showing people around the world who are willing to trade that Pok<U+00E9>mon, as well as the Pok<U+00E9>mon they want in return for it.<ref name="GTS">{{cite web|url=http://pokemon.kids.yahoo.co.jp/dp/news/system/system006/system006.html?page=0|title=Global Trade Station trade system|publisher=Yahoo! Kids Japan|date=[[2006-08-11]]}}</ref> The trade does not have to be instant and an offer can be left for other players to browse and complete, even while the player is offline. Some centers serve different purposes - one allows the player to enter battles against friends over an internet connection, while another allows the player to enter the Pok<U+00E9>mon Union, a chat room in which the player can communicate with others on the player's Friends List.<ref name="GTS2">{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/736/736588p1.html|title=IGN: Pokemon (''sic'') Pearl Preview|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2006-09-29]]}}</ref>

Along with the 50 existing [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon items#Technical Machines|Technical Machines]] (TMs), which teach Pok<U+00E9>mon a new [[Pok<U+00E9>mon moves|move]], 42 new TMs have been added to the game while the previous 50 have been retained, bringing the total to 92. This marks the first time an entire 50-TM set has been left intact between generations, and the first time the total number has exceeded 50 (58 counting HMs). Two of the eight [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon items#Hidden Machines|Hidden Machines]] (HMs), which, like TMs, teach Pok<U+00E9>mon a new move (but permanently), have also been changed, and one former HM has been downgraded to a TM.

==Connectivity to other games==
''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' boast compatibility with many other Pok<U+00E9>mon games. They can connect with the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (video games)#Game Boy Advance era|Game Boy Advance ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' RPGs]] after earning the National [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]], when the Pok<U+00E9>mon Game Boy Advance cartridge is inserted into slot 2 (the [[Game Boy Advance]] [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]] and accessory slot of the Nintendo DS) while ''Diamond'' or ''Pearl'' is in slot 1 (the DS card slot). After uploading six Pok<U+00E9>mon, players go to an area called Pal Park and must capture them in the wild.<ref name="pal_park">{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/palpark.shtml|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond/Pearl - Pal Park|publisher=Serebii.net|accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref> Pok<U+00E9>mon uploads are restricted to six per day per GBA cartridge, and the player will have to re-capture such transferred Pok<U+00E9>mon in Pal Park with a special Park Ball that has 100% chance of capture before transferring from another GBA game. Pok<U+00E9>mon cannot be transferred from an English GBA game to a Japanese DS game, and the player cannot transfer any of the Pok<U+00E9>mon back to the GBA cartridge once they are transferred to ''Diamond'' or ''Pearl''.

Certain Pok<U+00E9>mon transferred from a foreign GBA Pok<U+00E9>mon game to a Japanese GBA game that are then uploaded via Pal Park will have extra Pok<U+00E9>dex descriptions matching the language of the foreign game.<ref name="foreign_dex_entries">{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/foreign.shtml|title=Foreign Pok<U+00E9>mon and foreign Pok<U+00E9>dex entries|publisher=Serebii.net}}</ref> A new function added to the player<U+2019>s Pok<U+00E9>dex with that specific Pok<U+00E9>mon allows switching of the descriptions between different languages. These languages include [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].

The use of Pal Park is necessary if a player wishes to obtain the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon game mechanics#Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon|starter]] or [[legendary Pok<U+00E9>mon]] from a previous generation of Pok<U+00E9>mon games.<ref name="unobtainable_Pokemon_species">{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/unobtainables.shtml|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl - Unobtainable Pok<U+00E9>mon|publisher=Serebii.net|accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref> All other Pok<U+00E9>mon can be found and caught/obtained in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', however some are only available while the player has a Game Boy Advance ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' RPG inserted in Slot 2 of the Nintendo DS.<ref name="GBA_Pokemon_insertion">{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/gbapokemon.shtml|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl - GBA Pok<U+00E9>mon Insertion|publisher=Serebii.net|accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref>

In addition, ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' are able to connect to ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranger]]''. Using this feature a player will be able to send a [[Manaphy]] egg from ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranger'' to ''Diamond'' or ''Pearl'' after completing a special mission in ''Ranger''.<ref name="Connectivity with Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranger">{{cite web|url=http://www.manaphy.com|title="Manaphy Official website|publisher=Pok<U+00E9>mon USA|accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref> ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' also feature [[Wi-Fi]] connectivity with the [[Wii]] Pok<U+00E9>mon title ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Battle Revolution]]''.<ref name="connectivity">{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/711/711636p1.html|title=IGN: New Pokemon (''sic'') Announced|publisher=IGN|date=[[2006-06-07]]}}</ref>
==Pok<U+00E9>mon==
:''See also: the [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon]] and [[:Category:Fourth-generation Pok<U+00E9>mon|Category:Fourth-generation Pok<U+00E9>mon]]''
On [[May 14]], [[2004]], the first Pok<U+00E9>mon of the fourth generation, [[Munchlax]], was revealed. Following the pre-evolved form of [[Snorlax]], several other new Pok<U+00E9>mon to appear in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' were revealed in articles in ''[[CoroCoro Comic]]''. Early in production, it was intended that Pok<U+00E9>mon introduced in previous generations of the series would receive new, pre-evolved forms; Pok<U+00E9>mon available from as far back as ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'' can now be bred to produce new infantile species, such as [[Mr. Mime]] who is preceded by [[Mime Jr.]] and [[Chansey]] by [[Pinpuku]]. Pok<U+00E9>mon have been given new, further evolved forms; for example, [[Electabuzz]] can now evolve into [[Elekible]] and [[Roselia]] can now evolve into [[Roserade]]. The games introduce more legendary Pok<U+00E9>mon than any set of games before them.

The ''[[de facto]]'' mascots of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' were confirmed as <!--These are the OFFICIAL English names as far as we know, DO NOT CHANGE THEM.-->[[Dialga]]<!--DO NOT CHANGE.--> and <!--DO NOT CHANGE.-->[[Palkia]]<!--These are the OFFICIAL English names as far as we know, DO NOT CHANGE THEM.-->, like [[Groudon]] and [[Kyogre]] or [[Ho-Oh]] and [[Lugia]] before them, when [[Computer and video game packaging|video game packaging]] for the games was released in late June 2006; as their names suggest, Dialga represents ''Diamond'', and Palkia represents ''Pearl''.{{Endspoiler}}
