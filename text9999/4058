Several volcanoes produce plumes of [[sulfur]] and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as {{convert|500|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} above the surface. Io's surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive compression at the base of the moon's silicate crust. Some of these peaks are taller than Earth's [[Mount Everest]].<ref name="Schenk2001">{{cite journal |last=Schenk |first=P. |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2001 |title=The Mountains of Io: Global and Geological Perspectives from ''Voyager'' and ''Galileo'' |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=106 |issue=E12 |pages=33201<U+2013>33222 |doi=10.1029/2000JE001408 }}</ref> Unlike most satellites in the outer Solar System, which are mostly composed of water ice, Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core. Most of Io's surface is characterized by extensive plains coated with sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost.

Io's volcanism is responsible for many of that satellite's unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the surface in various shades of yellow, red, white, black, and green, largely due to [[Allotropes of sulfur|allotropes]] and compounds of sulfur. Numerous extensive lava flows, several more than {{convert|500|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in length, also mark the surface. These volcanic processes have given rise to a comparison of the visual appearance of Io's surface to a pizza. The materials produced by this volcanism provide material for Io's thin, patchy atmosphere and Jupiter's extensive [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|magnetosphere]]. Io's volcanic ejecta also produce a large [[Gas torus|plasma torus]] around Jupiter. 

Io played a significant role in the development of astronomy in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was discovered in 1610 by [[Galileo Galilei]], along with the other Galilean satellites. This discovery furthered the adoption of the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican model]] of the Solar System, the development of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s laws of motion, and the first measurement of the speed of light. From Earth, Io remained nothing more than a point of light until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it became possible to resolve its large-scale surface features, such as the dark red polar and bright equatorial regions. In 1979, the two ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' spacecraft revealed Io to be a geologically active world, with numerous volcanic features, large mountains, and a young surface with no obvious impact craters. The ''Galileo'' spacecraft performed several close flybys in the 1990s and early 2000s, obtaining data about Io's interior structure and surface composition. These spacecraft also revealed the relationship between the satellite and Jupiter's magnetosphere and the existence of a belt of radiation centered on Io's orbit. Io receives about 3,600 [[R<U+00F6>ntgen equivalent man|rem]] of radiation per day.<ref>http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~fringwal/w08a.jup.txt</ref>

Further observations have been made by [[Cassini<U+2013>Huygens]] in 2000 and [[New Horizons]] in 2007, as well as from [[Earth]]-based telescopes and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] as their technology has advanced.

While [[Simon Marius]] is not credited with the sole discovery of the Galilean satellites, his names for the moons have stuck. In his 1614 publication ''[[Simon Marius|Mundus Iovialis anno M.DC.IX Detectus Ope Perspicilli Belgici]]'', he proposed several possible names for the innermost of the large moons of Jupiter, including ''The Mercury of Jupiter'' or The First of the "Jovian Planets".<ref name="Marius">{{cite book |last=Marius |first=S. |authorlink=Simon Marius |year=1614 |title=Mundus Iovialis anno M.DC.IX Detectus Ope Perspicilli Belgici |trans_title=The World of Jupiter discovered in the year 1609 by Means of a Belgian spy-glass |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1916Obs....39..367./0000367.000.html }}</ref> Based on a suggestion from Johannes Kepler in October 1613, he also generated a naming scheme so that each moon was given its own name based on the lovers of the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] [[Zeus]] or his [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. In this case, he named the innermost large moon of Jupiter after the Greek mythological figure [[Io (mythology)|Io]].<ref name="Marius"/><ref name="Marius2">{{cite journal |last=Marius |first=S. |authorlink=Simon Marius |year=1614 |title=Mundus Iovialis anno M.DC.IX Detectus Ope Perspicilli Belgici |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/marius.html }} (in which he [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/jupiter_satellites.html attributes the suggestion] to Johannes Kepler)</ref> The most common adjectival form of the name is ''Ionian''.

In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Io is simply referred to by its [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] designation (a system introduced by Galileo) as "'''{{nowrap|Jupiter I}}'''", or simply as "the first satellite of Jupiter".

Features on Io are named after characters and places from the Io myth, as well as deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, and thunder from various myths, and characters and places from [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'', names appropriate to the volcanic nature of the surface.<ref name="NameCategories">{{cite web | last=Blue | first=Jennifer | date=October 16, 2006 |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append6.html | title=Categories for Naming Features on Planets and Satellites | publisher=USGS | accessdate= 2007-06-14 }}</ref> Since the surface was first seen up close by ''[[Voyager 1]]'' the [[International Astronomical Union]] has approved 225 names for Io's volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and large albedo features.

{{Main|Exploration of Io}}
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|150 px|left|[[Galileo Galilei]], the discoverer of Io]]
The first reported observation of Io was made by [[Galileo Galilei]] on January 7, 1610 using a [[Refracting telescope#Galileo's telescope|20x-power, refracting telescope]] at the [[University of Padua]]. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] due to the low power of his telescope, so the two were recorded as a single point of light. Io and Europa were seen for the first time as separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jupiter system the following day, January 8, 1610 (used as the discovery date for Io by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]).<ref name="IAUMoonDiscoveries">{{cite web |last=Blue |first=Jennifer |date=November 9, 2009 |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append7.html |title=Planet and Satellite Names and Discoverers |publisher=USGS | accessdate= 2010-01-13}}</ref> The discovery of Io and the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter was published in Galileo's ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' in March 1610.<ref name="IobookChap2">

For the next two and a half centuries, Io remained an unresolved, 5th-magnitude point of light in astronomers' telescopes. During the 17th century, Io and the other Galilean satellites served a variety of purposes, such as helping mariners determine their [[longitude]],<ref>{{cite web

Improved telescope technology in the late 19th and 20th centuries allowed astronomers to [[Optical resolution|resolve]] (that is, see) large-scale surface features on Io. In the 1890s, [[Edward Emerson Barnard|Edward E. Barnard]] was the first to observe variations in Io's brightness between its equatorial and polar regions, correctly determining that this was due to differences in color and [[albedo]] between the two regions and not due to Io being egg-shaped, as proposed at the time by fellow astronomer [[William Henry Pickering|William Pickering]], or two separate objects, as initially proposed by Barnard.<ref name="Barnard1894">

The [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' spacecraft]] arrived at Jupiter in 1995 after a six-year journey from Earth to follow up on the discoveries of the two ''Voyager'' probes and ground-based observations taken in the intervening years. Io's location within one of Jupiter's most intense radiation belts precluded a prolonged close flyby, but ''Galileo'' did pass close by shortly before entering orbit for its two-year, primary mission studying the Jovian system. While no images were taken during the close flyby on December 7, 1995, the encounter did yield significant results, such as the discovery of a large iron core, similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner solar system.<ref name="Anderson1996">{{cite journal | last=Anderson |first=J.

Despite the lack of close-up imaging and mechanical problems that greatly restricted the amount of data returned, several significant discoveries were made during ''Galileo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s primary mission. ''Galileo'' observed the effects of a major eruption at Pillan Patera and confirmed that volcanic eruptions are composed of silicate magmas with magnesium-rich [[mafic]] and [[Ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] compositions with sulfur and sulfur dioxide serving a role similar to water and [[carbon dioxide]] on Earth.<ref name="Mcewen1998b">{{cite journal |title=High-temperature silicate volcanism on Jupiter's moon Io |journal=Science |last=McEwen |first=A.

The ''Galileo'' mission was twice extended, in 1997 and 2000. During these extended missions, the probe flew by Io three times in late 1999 and early 2000 and three times in late 2001 and early 2002.

=== Subsequent observations ===
[[File:Iosurface.jpg|thumb|300 px|Changes in surface features in the eight years between ''Galileo'' and ''New Horizons'' observations]]
Following ''Galileo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fiery demise in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, [[adaptive optics]] imaging from the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck telescope]] in [[Hawaii]] and imaging from the Hubble telescope have allowed astronomers to monitor Io's active volcanoes.<ref name="Marchis2005">{{cite journal | last=Marchis |first=F. |coauthors=''et al.'' |title=Keck AO survey of Io global volcanic activity between 2 and 5 <U+03BC>m |journal=Icarus |volume=176 |issue= |pages=96<U+2013>122 |year=2005 |url= |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.12.014 }}</ref><ref name="SpencerBlog02232007">{{cite web |url=http://planetary.org/blog/article/00000874/ |title=Here We Go! |accessdate=2007-06-03 |last=Spencer |first=John |coauthors= |date=2007-02-23 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic activity on Io, even without a spacecraft in the Jupiter system.

There are currently two forthcoming missions planned for the Jupiter system. ''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]],'' scheduled to launch in 2011, has limited imaging capabilities, but it could provide monitoring of Io's volcanic activity using its near-infrared spectrometer, JIRAM. The [[Europa Jupiter System Mission|Europa/Jupiter System Mission]] (EJSM), a joint NASA/ESA project approved in February 2009 and scheduled to launch in 2020, would study Io using two spacecraft, NASA's ''[[Jupiter Europa Orbiter]]'' and [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s ''[[Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter]]''.<ref name="EJSMJSR">{{cite web |url=http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/files/EJSM%20Summary%20Report%20Final%20for%20Print_090120_rk.pdf |format=PDF|title=Europa Jupiter System Mission Joint Summary Report |accessdate=2009-01-21 |last=Joint Jupiter Science Definition Team |first= |coauthors=NASA/ESA Study Team |date=January 16, 2009 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=NASA/ESA |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> While most of the observations of Io would be acquired from a distance as both spacecraft focus primarily on the icy Galilean satellites, the ''Jupiter Europa Orbiter'' would perform four close flybys of Io in 2025 and 2026 prior to going into orbit around Europa.

== Orbit and rotation ==
[[File:Galilean moon Laplace resonance animation.gif|thumb|301px|right|Animation showing Io's [[Laplace resonance]] with Europa and Ganymede]]
Io orbits Jupiter at a distance of {{convert|421,700|km|mi|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} from the planet's center and {{convert|350,000|km|mi|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} from its cloudtops. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, its orbit lying between those of [[Thebe (moon)|Thebe]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. Including Jupiter's inner satellites, Io is the fifth moon out from Jupiter. It takes 42.5 hours to revolve once (fast enough for its motion to be observed over a single night of observation). Io is in a 2:1 mean-motion [[orbital resonance]] with Europa and a 4:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], completing two orbits of Jupiter for every one orbit completed by Europa, and four orbits for every one completed by Ganymede. This resonance helps maintain Io's [[orbital eccentricity]] (0.0041), which in turn provides the primary heating source for its geologic activity (see the "[[#Tidal heating|Tidal heating]]" section for a more detailed explanation of the process).<ref name="Peale1979a"/> Without this forced eccentricity, Io's orbit would circularize through [[Tidal acceleration|tidal dissipation]], leading to a geologically less active world.

Like the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter and the Earth's [[Moon]], Io rotates [[Tidal locking|synchronously]] with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's [[prime meridian]] intersects the north and south poles, and the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter is known as the subjovian hemisphere, while the side that always faces away is known as the antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in the direction that the moon travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, while the side that always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.<ref name="Lopes2005">{{cite journal |title=Io after ''Galileo'' |journal=[[Reports on Progress in Physics]] |last=Lopes |first=R.

== Interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere ==

Io plays a significant role in shaping the [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|Jovian magnetic field]]. The magnetosphere of Jupiter sweeps up gases and dust from Io's thin atmosphere at a rate of 1&nbsp;[[tonne]] per second.<ref name="IobookChap11">{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=N.

These materials, depending on their ionized state and composition, ultimately end up in various neutral (non-ionized) clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter's [[magnetosphere]] and, in some cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.

Surrounding Io (up to a distance of 6 Io radii from the moon's surface) is a cloud of neutral sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and potassium atoms. These particles originate in Io's upper atmosphere but are excited from collisions with ions in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[torus]] (discussed below) and other processes into filling Io's [[Hill sphere]], which is the region where the moon's gravity is predominant over Jupiter. Some of this material escapes Io's gravitational pull and goes into orbit around Jupiter. Over a 20-hour period, these particles spread out from Io to form a banana-shaped, neutral cloud that can reach as far as 6 Jovian radii from Io, either inside Io's orbit and ahead of the satellite or outside Io's orbit and behind the satellite.<ref name="IobookChap11"/> The collisional process that excites these particles also occasionally provides sodium ions in the plasma torus with an electron, removing those new "fast" neutrals from the torus. However, these particles still retain their velocity (70&nbsp;km/s, compared to the 17&nbsp;km/s orbital velocity at Io), leading these particles to be ejected in jets leading away from Io.<ref name="Burger1999">{{cite journal | last=Burger |first=M.

Io orbits within a belt of intense radiation known as the Io plasma torus. The plasma in this [[doughnut]]-shaped ring of ionized sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine originates when neutral atoms in the "cloud" surrounding Io are ionized and carried along by the Jovian magnetosphere.<ref name="IobookChap11"/> Unlike the particles in the neutral cloud, these particles co-rotate with Jupiter's magnetosphere, revolving around Jupiter at 74&nbsp;km/s. Like the rest of Jupiter's magnetic field, the plasma torus is tilted with respect to Jupiter's equator (and Io's orbital plane), meaning Io is at times below and at other times above the core of the plasma torus. As noted above, these ions' higher velocity and energy levels are partly responsible for the removal of neutral atoms and molecules from Io's atmosphere and more extended neutral cloud. The torus is composed of three sections: an outer, "warm" torus that resides just outside Io's orbit; a vertically extended region known as the "ribbon", composed of the neutral source region and cooling plasma, located at around Io's distance from Jupiter; and an inner, "cold" torus, composed of particles that are slowly spiraling in toward Jupiter.<ref name="IobookChap11"/> After residing an average of 40 days in the torus, particles in the "warm" torus escape and are partially responsible for Jupiter's unusually large [[magnetosphere]], their outward pressure inflating it from within.<ref name="Krimigis2002">{{cite journal | last=Krimigis |first=S.

Jupiter's [[magnetic field]] lines, which Io crosses, couples Io's atmosphere and neutral cloud to Jupiter's polar upper atmosphere through the [[Faraday's law of induction|generation]] of an [[electric current]] known as the Io [[flux tube]].<ref name=IobookChap11/> This current produces an auroral glow in Jupiter's polar regions known as the Io footprint, as well as aurorae in Io's atmosphere. Particles from this auroral interaction act to darken the Jovian polar regions at visible wavelengths. The location of Io and its auroral footprint with respect to the Earth and Jupiter has a strong influence on Jovian [[radio]] emissions from our vantage point: when Io is visible, radio signals from Jupiter increase considerably.<ref name=Bigg1964/><ref name=IobookChap11/> The ''Juno'' mission, planned for the next decade, should help to shed light on these processes. The Jovian magnetic field lines that do get past Io's ionosphere also induce an electric current, which in turn creates an induced magnetic field, within Io's interior. Io's induced magnetic field is thought to be generated within a partially molten, silicate magma ocean 50 kilometers beneath the moon's surface.<ref name="KerrInducedField">{{cite journal| last=Kerr |first=R.

== Structure ==
Io is slightly larger than Earth's [[Moon]]. It has a mean radius of {{convert|1,821.3|km|mi|sigfig=5|abbr=on}} (about five percent greater than the Moon's) and a mass of 8.9319{{e|22}}&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] (about 21 percent greater than the Moon's). It is a slight [[ellipsoid]] in shape, with its longest axis directed toward Jupiter. Among the [[Galilean moons|Galilean satellites]], in both mass and volume, Io ranks behind [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] but ahead of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].

=== Tidal heating ===
Unlike the Earth and the Moon, Io's main source of internal heat comes from [[Tidal force|tidal]] dissipation rather than radioactive [[isotope]] decay, the result of Io's orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede.<ref name=Peale1979a/> Such heating is dependent on Io's distance from Jupiter, its orbital eccentricity, the composition of its interior, and its physical state.<ref name=IobookChap5/> Its [[orbital resonance|Laplace resonance]] with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io's eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit. The resonant orbit also helps to maintain Io's distance from Jupiter; otherwise tides raised on Jupiter would cause Io to slowly spiral outward from its parent planet.<ref name=Yoder1979>{{cite journal | last=Yoder |first=C.

=== Surface ===
[[File:Io from Galileo and Voyager missions.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Io's surface map.]]
Based on their experience with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous [[impact crater]]s in ''Voyager 1''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first images of Io. The density of impact craters across Io's surface would have given clues to the moon's age. However, they were surprised to discover that the surface was almost completely lacking in impact craters, but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various shapes and sizes, and volcanic lava flows.<ref name=Smith1979/> Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's surface was covered in a variety of colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten [[orange (fruit)|orange]] or to [[pizza]]) from various sulfurous compounds.<ref name=Britt2000>{{cite news| last=Britt | first=Robert Roy | title=Pizza Pie in the Sky: Understanding Io's Riot of Color | publisher=[[Space.com]] | date=March 16, 2000| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/galileo_io_volcanoes_000316.html | accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref> The lack of impact craters indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury craters as they are produced.

Io's colorful appearance is the result of various materials produced by its extensive volcanism. These materials include [[silicate]]s (such as [[Pyroxene|orthopyroxene]]), [[sulfur]], and [[sulfur dioxide]].<ref name="IobookChap9">{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=R.

This radiation damage produces Io's red-brown polar regions.<ref name=Barnard1894/>

[[Volcanism on Io#Plumes|Explosive volcanism]], often taking the form of umbrella-shaped plumes, paints the surface with sulfurous and silicate materials. Plume deposits on Io are often colored red or white depending on the amount of sulfur and sulfur dioxide in the plume. Generally, plumes formed at volcanic vents from degassing lava contain a greater amount of S<sub>2</sub>, producing a red "fan" deposit, or in extreme cases, large (often reaching beyond {{convert|450|km|mi|sigfig=2|disp=or|abbr=on}} from the central vent) red rings.<ref name="Spencer2000b">{{cite journal |title=Discovery of Gaseous S<sub>2</sub> in Io's Pele Plume |journal=Science |last=Spencer |first=J. |coauthors=''et al.'' |pages=1208<U+2013>1210 |volume=288 |issue= 5469|year=2000 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5469.1208 |pmid=10817990}}</ref> A prominent example of a red-ring plume deposit is located at Pele.

The tidal heating produced by Io's forced [[orbital eccentricity]] has led the moon to become one of the most volcanically active worlds in the Solar System, with hundreds of volcanic centres and extensive [[Lava|lava flows]]. During a major eruption, lava flows tens or even hundreds of kilometres long can be produced, consisting mostly of [[basalt]] silicate lavas with either [[mafic]] or [[Ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] (magnesium-rich) compositions. As a by-product of this activity, sulfur, sulfur dioxide gas and silicate [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] material (like ash) are blown up to {{convert|200|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} into space, producing large, umbrella-shaped plumes, painting the surrounding terrain in red, black, and white, and providing material for Io's patchy atmosphere and Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere.

Io's surface is dotted with volcanic depressions known as ''paterae''.<ref name="Radebaugh2001">{{cite journal |title=Paterae on Io: A new type of volcanic caldera? |journal=J. Geophys.

Lava flows represent another major volcanic terrain on Io. Magma erupts onto the surface from vents on the floor of paterae or on the plains from fissures, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at [[K<U+012B>lauea|Kilauea]] in Hawaii. Images from the ''Galileo'' spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major lava flows, like those at [[Prometheus (volcano)|Prometheus]] and [[Amirani (volcano)|Amirani]], are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava flows on top of older flows.<ref name="Keszthelyi2001">{{cite journal |title=Imaging of volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io by Galileo during the Galileo Europa Mission and the Galileo Millennium Mission |journal=J.

For example, the leading edge of the Prometheus flow moved {{convert|75|to|95|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} between ''Voyager'' in 1979 and the first ''Galileo'' observations in 1996. A major eruption in 1997 produced more than {{convert|3500|km2|sqmi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of fresh lava and flooded the floor of the adjacent Pillan Patera.<ref name="Mcewen1998b"/>

[[File:Tvashtarvideo.gif|left|thumb|Five-image sequence of ''[[New Horizons]]'' images showing Io's volcano Tvashtar spewing material 330&nbsp;km above its surface.]]
Analysis of the ''Voyager'' images led scientists to believe that these flows were composed mostly of various compounds of molten sulfur. However, subsequent Earth-based [[infrared]] studies and measurements from the ''Galileo'' spacecraft indicate that these flows are composed of basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic compositions. This hypothesis is based on temperature measurements of Io's "hotspots", or thermal-emission locations, which suggest temperatures of at least 1300&nbsp;K and some as high as 1600&nbsp;K.<ref name="Keszthelyi2007">{{cite journal |title=New estimates for Io eruption temperatures: Implications for the interior |journal=Icarus |last=Keszthelyi |first=L. |coauthors=''et al.'' |pages=491<U+2013>502 |volume=192 |issue= |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.008}}</ref> Initial estimates suggesting eruption temperatures approaching 2000&nbsp;K<ref name="Mcewen1998b"/> have since proven to be overestimates since the wrong thermal models were used to model the temperatures.<ref name="Keszthelyi2007"/>

The discovery of plumes at the volcanoes [[Pele (volcano)|Pele]] and [[Loki (volcano)|Loki]] were the first sign that Io is geologically active.<ref name="Morabito1979"/> Generally, these plumes are formed when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching 1&nbsp;km/s (0.6&nbsp;mps), creating umbrella-shaped clouds of gas and dust.

Plumes formed in this manner are among the largest observed at Io, forming red rings more than {{convert|1,000|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in diameter. Examples of this plume type include Pele, Tvashtar, and [[Dazhbog Patera|Dazhbog]]. Another type of plume is produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide frost, sending the sulfur skyward. This type of plume often forms bright circular deposits consisting of sulfur dioxide. These plumes are often less than {{convert|100|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} tall, and are among the most long-lived plumes on Io. Examples include Prometheus, Amirani, and [[Masubi (volcano)|Masubi]].

Despite the extensive volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its mountains are tectonic structures, and are not produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian mountains form as the result of compressive stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io's crust through [[thrust fault]]ing.<ref name="SchenkBulmer1998">{{cite journal | last=Schenk |first=P.

Mountains on Io (generally, structures rising above the surrounding plains) have a variety of morphologies. [[Plateau]]s are most common.<ref name="Schenk2001"/> These structures resemble large, flat-topped [[mesa]]s with rugged surfaces. Other mountains appear to be tilted crustal blocks, with a shallow slope from the formerly flat surface and a steep slope consisting of formerly sub-surface materials uplifted by compressive stresses. Both types of mountains often have steep [[Escarpment|scarps]] along one or more margins. Only a handful of mountains on Io appear to have a volcanic origin.

Other shield volcanoes with much shallower slopes are inferred from the morphology of several of Io's volcanoes, where thin flows radiate out from a central patera, such as at [[Ra Patera]].<ref name="Schenk2004"/>

Nearly all mountains appear to be in some stage of degradation. Large [[landslide]] deposits are common at the base of Ionian mountains, suggesting that [[mass wasting]] is the primary form of degradation. Scalloped margins are common among Io's mesas and plateaus, the result of sulfur dioxide [[Groundwater sapping|sapping]] from Io's crust, producing zones of weakness along mountain margins.<ref name="Moore2001">{{cite journal | last=Moore |first=J.

Gas in Io's atmosphere is stripped by Jupiter's magnetosphere, escaping to either the neutral cloud that surrounds Io, or the Io plasma torus, a ring of [[ion]]ized particles that shares Io's orbit but co-rotates with the magnetosphere of Jupiter.

High-resolution images of Io acquired while the satellite is experiencing an eclipse reveal an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]-like glow.<ref name="Geissler1999">{{cite journal | last=Geissler |first=P. E. |coauthors=''et al.'' |title=Galileo Imaging of Atmospheric Emissions from Io |journal=Science |volume=285 |issue= |pages=870<U+2013>874 |year=1999 |url= | doi=10.1126/science.285.5429.870 |pmid=9651251}}</ref> As on Earth, this is due to radiation hitting the atmosphere, though in this case the charged particles come from Jupiter's magnetic field rather than the [[solar wind]]. Aurorae usually occur near the magnetic poles of planets, but Io's are brightest near its equator. Io lacks an intrinsic magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter's magnetic field near Io directly impact the satellite's atmosphere. More electrons collide with the atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to the satellite (i.e., near the equator), since the column of gas they pass through is longer there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to rock with the changing orientation of Jupiter's tilted magnetic dipole.<ref name="Retherford2000">{{cite journal | last=Retherford |first=K. D. |coauthors=''et al.'' |title=Io's Equatorial Spots: Morphology of Neutral UV Emissions |journal=J. Geophys.
