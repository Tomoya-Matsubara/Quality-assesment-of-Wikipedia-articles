== California ==
{{main|Same-sex marriage in California}}

On May 15, 2008, the Supreme Court of California overturned the ban on same-sex marriage, making California the second state, behind Massachusetts, to allow full marriage rights for same-sex partners.
Citing a 1948 California Supreme Court decision that reversed interracial marriages ban, the Republican-dominated California Supreme Court, (in a 4-3 ruling, penned by Chief Justice [[Ronald M. George|Ronald George]]) struck down California's 1977 one-man, one-woman marriage law and a similar voter-approved 2000 law (passed with 61%). Marriage licenses for same-sex couples will be available starting June 17, 2008.  The 2006 census figures indicate that California has an estimated 108,734 same-sex households.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080516/ap_on_re_us/gay_marriage news.yahoo.com, California's top court legalizes gay marriage]</ref>

The California Office of Vital Records announced on May 28, 2008 that it planned to start issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, 2008.[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/29/us/29gays.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1212077106-jTPmIQ0KjbR7Sj+zy7X72g] The Office of Vital Records chose the date of June 17 to be prepared if the May 15, 2008 decision of the Supreme Court of California is not stayed.

In a one-page Resolution, the California Supreme Court on [[June 4]], 2008 forthwith denied all petitions for rehearing and to reconsider the May 15 ruling, as it removed the final obstacle to same-sex marriages starting on [[June 17]]. It further rejected moves to delay enforcement of the decision until after the November election, when voters will decide whether to reinstate a ban on same-sex nuptials. [[Chief Justice]] Ronald George and Justices Joyce Kennard, Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Carlos Moreno, voted for the resolution, while dissenting or voting to reconsider the judgment, were Justices Marvin Baxter, Ming Chin and Carol Corrigan.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-gay-marriagejun05,0,6075700.story  chicagotribune.com, Calif. court refuses to stall gay marriage]</ref>The judgment stated: <U+201C>The decision filed on May 15, 2008, will become final on June 16, 2008, at 5 p.m.<U+201D> San Francisco Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] announced that marriages would be held  <U+201C>5:01<U+201D> on June 16.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/us/politics/05stay.html?ref=us nytimes.com,  Court Won<U+2019>t Delay Same-Sex Marriages]</ref><ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-marriage5-2008jun05,0,7825437.story latimes.com, California Supreme Court refuses to delay gay marriage]</ref> Moreover, a field poll in late May, reported that "51% of registered voters in the state favored the right of same-sex couples to marry, with 42 percent opposed.".<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Same-sex marriage opponents gathered sufficient signatures to place a constitutional amendment on the November 2008 ballot to define marriage as between a man and woman, [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]].  Although final certified results are pending, the proposition passed, leaving the status of approximately 18,000 same-sex marriages uncertain.<ref>[http://cbs2.com/local/Gay.Marriage.Status.2.857408.html Gay Marriages Now Uncertain After Prop. 8 Passes]</ref>

== Connecticut ==
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Connecticut}}

On October 10, 2008, the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]] issued a 4-3 ruling that denial of same-sex marriage is a violation of the Connecticut state constitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection. This makes Connecticut currently the second state in which same-sex marriage is legal, following Massachusetts. The ruling, which cannot be appealed to a federal court because it deals only with state constitutional issues, took effect on October 28. While the state could amend the state constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage, sentiment in both the state Republican and Democratic party is that this is unlikely.<ref>{{cite news

* Unresolved. The debate over same-sex marriage in [[Washington, D.C.]] is complicated by the fact that the [[United States Congress]] has ultimate authority over laws passed by the [[Council of the District of Columbia]]. Despite support from D.C. residents and elected officials in favor of same-sex marriage, the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]] restricts the District from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The Omnibus Domestic Partnership Equality Amendment Act of 2008, passed unanimously by the D.C. Council, provides the highest degree of legal protections akin to marriage for same-sex couples as possible without running afoul of federal law.<ref name='blade2008'>{{cite news |first=Lou |last=Chibbaro |coauthors= |title=D.C.

[[1971]]: The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] rules against the contention of plaintiffs Jack Baker and Mike McConnell that absence of a specific prohibition on same-sex marriage signified a legislative intent to recognize them. The court found that "The institution of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book of [[Genesis]]".<ref name="buddybuddy" /> This decision was appealed to the United States Supreme Court (see ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]''), but was dismissed for failure to present a federal question. Such a dismissal constitutes a holding that the claimed Federal right--a Constitutional mandate to treat same-sex and opposite-sex couples identically--does not exist.

== Oklahoma ==
[[May 13]], [[2004]]: A lesbian couple from [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] obtained a marriage application in the [[Cherokee]] tribal headquarters in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]]. The Cherokee Nation issues marriage applications, rather than licenses. Couples obtaining a license have it signed by the individual performing the ceremony before returning to tribal court to have the application certified. [[Cherokee Principal Chief]] [[Chad "Corntassel" Smith]] stated that he believes that same-sex marriages are not allowed under Cherokee law, and the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council unanimously approved language that defined a union as between one man and one woman.

July 2005: The tribe's Judicial Appeals Tribunal upheld the couple's right to marry, confirming that if they should refile for certification, it would be granted.<ref>[http://www.gaywired.com/article.cfm?section=9&id=6803 GayWired.com - Cherokee Court Gives Approval for Lesbian Marriage<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Although Oklahoma does not recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, Oklahoma ''does'' recognize all Cherokee marriages. It is unclear how Oklahoma would react if the Cherokee tribal courts decide that this marriage is valid.

Feb. 5, 2007: Senator Laughlin introduced SJR 21. This resolution would amend the state constitution to read, "Civil unions between persons of the same gender shall be prohibited in this state. Civil unions between persons of the same gender granted in another state shall not be recognized as valid and binding in this state."
