After a prolonged [[marketing campaign]] comprising the creation of a website from the point of view of the main character, Jackson Curtis,<ref name="atlantis" /> and a [[viral marketing]] website on which filmgoers could register for a lottery number to save them from the ensuing disaster,<ref name="first" /> the film was internationally released on 13&nbsp;November&nbsp;2009. It received generally mixed reviews from critics and its worldwide theatrical revenue reached approximately $770&nbsp;million.<ref name="box" />

==Plot==
In 2009, Adrian Helmsley ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]), an American [[geologist]], visits [[astrophysicist]] Dr. Satnam Tsurutani ([[Jimi Mistry]]) in India and learns that [[neutrino]]s from a massive [[solar flare]] are causing the temperature of the Earth's core to increase. Adrian gives a report on this to [[White House Chief of Staff]] Carl Anheuser ([[Oliver Platt]]) who ends up taking Adrian to meet the [[President of the United States]].

In 2010, President Thomas Wilson ([[Danny Glover]]) and other international leaders begin a secret project to ensure humanity's survival. Approximately 400,000 people are chosen to board "arks" that are constructed at Cho Ming, [[Tibet]], in the [[Himalayas]]. At the same time as the [[People's Liberation Army]] are gathering volunteers, a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk named Nima ([[Osric Chau]]) is evacuated while his brother Tenzin ([[Chin Han]]) joins the workers in the Ark project. Additional funding for the project is raised by selling tickets to the private sector for [[Euro|<U+20AC>]]1&nbsp;billion per person. By 2011, humanity's valuable treasures are moved to the Himalayas under the guise of protecting them from terrorist attacks with the help of art expert and [[First Family of the United States|First Daughter]] Dr. Laura Wilson ([[Thandie Newton]]).

In 2012, Jackson Curtis ([[John Cusack]]) is a science fiction writer in [[Los Angeles]] who works part-time as a limousine driver for the Russian billionaire, Yuri Karpov ([[Zlatko Buri<U+0107>]]). Jackson's ex-wife, Kate ([[Amanda Peet]]) and their children Noah ([[Liam James]]) and Lilly ([[Morgan Lily]]) live with Kate's boyfriend, plastic surgeon Gordon Silberman ([[Thomas McCarthy (entertainer)|Thomas McCarthy]]).

Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. After an encounter with Helmsley, they meet Charlie Frost ([[Woody Harrelson]]), who hosts a radio show from the park. Charlie plays a video of [[Charles Hapgood]]'s theory that [[polar shift]]s and the [[Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar]] predict that the [[2012 phenomenon]] will occur. He has a map of the ark project in addition to information about officials and scientists from around the world who were murdered after planning to alert the public. The family returns home as [[seismic activity]] vastly increases along the [[west coast of the United States]]. Jackson grows suspicious and rents a plane to rescue his family. He collects his family and Gordon as the [[Cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis|Earth crust displacement]] begins, and they narrowly escape Los Angeles as the city slides into the [[Pacific Ocean]].

As millions die in catastrophic earthquakes worldwide, the group flies to Yellowstone to retrieve Charlie's map, escaping as the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] erupts. Charlie stays behind to broadcast the eruption and is killed in the blast of the expulsion of an [[Volcanic ash|ash cloud]]. Learning that the arks are in [[China]], the group lands in [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] to find a larger plane. They meet Yuri, his twin sons Alec and Oleg (played by Alexandre and Philippe Haussmann), girlfriend Tamara ([[Beatrice Rosen]]) and pilot Sasha ([[Johann Urb]]). The group secures an [[List of fictional aircraft#Commercial|Antonov 500]] aircraft and they depart for China. Also heading for the arks aboard [[Air Force One]] are Anheuser, Helmsley and Laura Wilson. President Wilson remains in [[Washington, D.C.]] to address the nation one last time. With the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] dead and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] missing, Anheuser assumes ''de facto'' leadership. A [[megatsunami]] then capsizes the Genesis cruiseship, killing Helmsley's father. President Wilson is killed by another [[megatsunami]] that sends the aircraft carrier [[USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)|USS ''John F. Kennedy'']] crashing into the [[White House]].

Arriving in China in a crash landing that kills Sasha, the group is spotted by the [[People's Liberation Army]]. Yuri and his sons, possessing tickets, are taken to the arks, leaving Tamara and the others behind. They are picked up by Nima and are taken to the arks with his grandparents ([[Lisa Lu]] and Chang Tseng). They stow away on the ark with the help of Tenzin. As a megatsunami approaches the site, an [[impact driver]] becomes lodged between the gears of the ark's Hydraulics Chamber, preventing a boarding gate from closing and rendering the ship unable to start its engines. In the ensuing chaos Yuri, Gordon and Tamara are killed, Tenzin is wounded, and the ark is set adrift. Jackson and Noah dislodge the impact driver and the crew regains control of the ark before it can impact [[Mount Everest]].

After flood waters from the tsunamis recede, the arks travel to the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in [[South Africa]] where the [[Drakensberg]] Mountains have risen in relation to sea level and become the tallest mountains in the world. Jackson is rejoined with his family and Helmsley starts a relationship with Laura.

==Production==
The credits cite the bestselling book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' by author [[Graham Hancock]] as inspiration for the film,<ref name="2012-credit-list">{{cite web |url= http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf |title=2012 (2009) - Credit List |accessdate=2009-11-25 |work=chicagoscifi.com }}</ref> and in an interview with the London magazine [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] Emmerich states: "I always wanted to do a biblical flood movie, but I never felt I had the hook.

Director Emmerich and composer-producer [[Harald Kloser]] had an extremely close relationship and also co-wrote a [[spec script]] entitled ''2012'', which was marketed to major studios in February&nbsp;2008. Nearly all studios met with Emmerich and his representatives to hear the director's budget projection and story plans, a process that the director had previously gone through with the films ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' (2004).<ref>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981155.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Studios vie for Emmerich's ''2012'' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=| date=February 19, 2008 | accessdate=July 14, 2008 }}</ref>
Later that month, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] won the rights for the [[spec script]], planning to distribute it under [[Columbia Pictures]]<ref>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981245.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Sony buys Emmerich's ''2012'' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=| date=February 21, 2008 | accessdate=July 14, 2008 }}</ref> and was produced for less than budgeted.

Although the film depicts the destruction of several major cultural and historical icons around the world, Emmerich stated that the [[Kaaba]] was also considered for selection. Kloser opposed the idea out of fear that a [[fatw<U+0101>]] might be issued against him.<ref>{{cite news |title= Emmerich reveals fear of fatwa axed 2012 scene |author= Ben Child |date= November 3, 2009 |work= [[The Guardian]] |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/nov/03/roland-emmerich-2012-kaaba | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/movie-talk-roland-emmerich-fatwa.html |title=The One Place on Earth Not Destroyed in '2012' |author=Jonathan Crow |publisher= Yahoo!

===Marketing===
The film was promoted in a marketing campaign by a fictional organization, the "Institute for Human Continuity"; this entailed a fictitious book written by Jackson Curtis entitled ''Farewell Atlantis'',<ref name="atlantis" /> and [[streaming media]], [[blog|blog updates]] and [[radio|radio broadcasts]] from the [[Zealotry|apocalyptic zealot]] Charlie Frost on his website ''This Is The End''.<ref name="atlantis" />

On November&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2008, the new studio released the first teaser trailer for ''2012'' that showed a [[tsunami]] surging over the [[Himalayas]] and interlaced a purportedly scientific message suggesting that the world would end in 2012, and that the world's governments were not preparing its population for the event. The trailer ended with a message to viewers to "find out the truth" by searching "2012" on search engines. ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the marketing effectiveness as "deeply flawed" and associated it with "websites that make even more spurious claims about 2012".<ref>{{cite news | last=Pickard | first=Anna | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/25/2012-ronald-emmerich | title=''2012'': a cautionary tale about marketing | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=November 25, 2008 | accessdate=December 10, 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

The studio also launched a [[viral marketing]] website operated by the fictional Institute for Human Continuity, where filmgoers could register for a lottery number to be part of a small population that would be rescued from the global destruction.<ref name="first">{{cite news | last=Billington | first=Alex | url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/11/15/roland-emmerichs-2012-viral-institute-for-human-continuity/ | title=Roland Emmerich's ''2012'' Viral <U+2014> Institute for Human Continuity | work=FirstShowing.net | date=November 15, 2008 | accessdate=December 10, 2008 }}</ref> David Morrison of [[NASA]] received over 1000 inquiries from people who thought the website was genuine, and condemned it. "I've even had cases of teenagers writing to me saying they are contemplating suicide because they don't want to see the world end," he said. "I think when you lie on the internet and scare children to make a buck, that is ethically wrong."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/relax-the-end-isnt-nigh-1804340.html |title=Relax, the end isn't nigh |last=Connor|first=Steve |date=17 October 2009 |work=The Independent |accessdate=October 20, 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Another viral marketing website promotes ''Farewell Atlantis'', a fictional suspense novel by the film's lead protagonist, about the events of 2012.<ref name="atlantis">{{cite web | url=http://farewellatlantis.com/ | title=Farewell Atlantis by Jackson Curtis - Fake website | publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] | accessdate=June 30, 2011}}</ref>

[[Comcast]] had also organized a "roadblock campaign" to promote the film, where a two-minute scene from the film was broadcast across 450 American commercial television networks, local English and Spanish language stations, and 89 cable outlets within a ten-minute window between 10:50&nbsp;PM [[Eastern daylight time|EDT]]/[[Pacific Daylight Time|PDT]] and 11:00&nbsp;PM EDT/PDT on October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2009.<ref name="2012block">{{cite news|url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009036.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562 |title=Sony readies 'roadblock' for 2012 |last=Graser|first=Mark |date=September 23, 2009 |work=Variety |accessdate=2009-09-29}}</ref> The scene featured the destruction of Los Angeles and ended with a cliffhanger, with the entire 5-minute-38-second clip made available on Comcast's [[Fancast]] web site. The trade newspaper ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' estimated that, "The stunt will put the footage in front of 90% of all households watching ad-supported TV, or nearly 110&nbsp;million viewers. When combined with online and mobile streams, that could increase to more than 140&nbsp;million".<ref name="2012block"/>

The release date was changed to November&nbsp;2009 to move out of the busy summer schedule into a time frame that the studio considered to have more potential for financial success. According to the studio, the film could have been completed for the summer release date, but the date change would give more time to the production. The film was released on November&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2009. It was released on Friday November&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2009 in [[Sweden]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Mexico]], [[India]] and the [[United States]], and was released on November&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2009 in [[Japan]].<ref name="worldwide-release-dates">{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/2012/international/ |title=2012 Worldwide Release Dates |accessdate=2009-11-12 |work=sonypictures.com }}</ref>

===North Korean ban===
[[North Korea]] has reportedly banned possession or viewing of the film. The year 2012 is the 100th anniversary of the birth of the nation's founder, [[Kim Il-sung]], and has been designated by the North Korean government as "the year for opening the grand gates to becoming a rising superpower".  Thus, a movie which depicts the year in a negative light is found to be offensive by the North Korean government. Several people in North Korea have reportedly been arrested for possessing or viewing pirated copies of the movie and charged with "grave provocation against the development of the state."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201003250328.html |title=Watching '2012' a no-no in N.

==Television spin-off==
{{Anchor|Sequel}}
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' announced that there was a plan for a spin-off television series entitled ''2013'' that would have served as a follow-up to the film.<ref name="ewee">{{cite web | url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/03/02/abc-passes-2012-tv-show | title=ABC passes on '2012' TV show | publisher=''Entertainment Weekly'' | date=March 2, 2010 | accessdate=July 3, 2011 | author=Rice, Lynette}}</ref> Executive producer of ''2012'', [[Mark Gordon]] told ''EW'' that "ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after Lost ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film. After the movie, there are some people who survive and the question is how will these survivors build a new world and what will it look like. That might make an interesting TV series."<ref name="ewee" /> However on March&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2010, it was announced that ABC decided to pass on the television spin-off of the film.<ref name="ewee" />
