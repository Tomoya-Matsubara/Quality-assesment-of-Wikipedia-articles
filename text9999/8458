'''North America''' ({{lang-es|Am<U+00E9>rica del Norte}} or ''Norteam<U+00E9>rica''; {{lang-fr|Am<U+00E9>rique du Nord}}) is the northern [[continent]] of the [[Americas]],<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/418612/North-America|title = North America|publisher = [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]}}</ref> situated in the [[Earth]]'s [[northern hemisphere]] and in the [[western hemisphere]]. It is bordered on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]], on the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]], on the southeast by the [[Caribbean Sea]], and on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]]; [[South America]] lies to the southeast. North America covers an [[area]] of about 24,709,000 square kilometers<!--spelled out per WP:MOSNUM --> (9,540,000 square miles), about 4.8% of the planet's surface or about 16.5% of its land area. As of July 2008, its [[population]] was estimated at nearly 529 million people. It is the [[Continent#Area and population|third-largest]] continent in area, following [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], and the fourth in population after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe]].

==Etymology==
The Americas are generally accepted as having been named after the [[Italy|Italian]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] by the German cartographers [[Martin Waldseem<U+00FC>ller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]]. Vespucci, who explored South America between 1497 and 1502, was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not the [[East Indies]], but a different landmass previously unknown by Europeans. In 1507, Waldseem<U+00FC>ller produced a world map, in which he placed the word "America" on the continent of South America, in the middle of what is today Brazil. He explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book ''Cosmographiae Introductio'',

:''ab Americo inventore ... quasi Americi terram sive Americam'' (from Americus the discoverer ... as if it were the land of Americus, thus America).<ref>p. 9, [http://books.google.com/books?id=3bOg4Nroos4C ''The Cosmographi<U+00E6> Introductio of Martin Waldseem<U+00FC>ller in Facsimile''], translated by Edward Burke and Mario E. Cosenza, introduction by Joseph Fischer and Franz von Wieser, edited by Charles George Herbermann, New York: The United States Catholic Historical Society, 1907.</ref>

For Waldseem<U+00FC>ller, no one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer. He used the Latinized version of Vespucci's name (Americus Vespucius), but in its feminine form "America", following the examples of "Europa" and "Asia".

Later, when other mapmakers added North America, they extended the original name to it as well: in 1538, [[Gerard Mercator]] used the name America to all of the Western Hemisphere on his world map.<ref name="Cohen">[http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html The Naming of America: Fragments We've Shored Against Ourselves]. By Jonathan Cohen</ref>

Some argue that the convention is to use the surname for naming discoveries except in the case of royalty and so a derivation from "Amerigo Vespucci" could be problematic.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=John |authorlink=John Lloyd (writer) |coauthors= John Mitchinson |title=The Book of General Ignorance |publisher=Harmony Books |isbn=978-0-307-39491-0 |pages=95 |quote=New countries or continents were never named after a person<U+2019>s first name, but always after the second... |year=2006 }}</ref> Ricardo Palma (1949) proposed a derivation from the "Amerrique" mountains of Central America<U+2014>Vespucci was the first to discover South America and the ''Amerrique'' mountains of Central America, which connected his discoveries to those of [[Christopher Columbus]].

Alfred E. Hudd proposed a theory in 1908 that the continents are named after a Welsh merchant named [[Richard Amerike]] from Bristol, who is believed to have financed [[John Cabot]]'s voyage of discovery from England to Newfoundland in 1497. A minutely explored belief that has been advanced is that America was named for a Spanish sailor bearing the ancient [[Visigothic]] name of 'Amairick'. Another is that the name is rooted in a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] language.<ref name="Cohen"/>

{{Main|History of North America}}

===Paleohistory===
North America is the source of much of what humanity knows about [[geologic time]] periods.<ref name="dinopedia-american" /> The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of [[dinosaur]]s than any other modern country.<ref name="dinopedia-american" /> According to [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history.<ref name="dinopedia-american" /> Much of the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]] is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent.<ref name="dinopedia-american">Dodson, Peter (1997).

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Chichen-Itza El Castillo.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Chich<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>]], Mexico.]]
Scientists have [[Models of migration to the New World|several theories as to the origins]] of the [[Paleo-Indians|early human population of North America]]. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples of North America]] themselves have many [[creation myth]]s, by which they assert that they have been present on the land since its creation.

[[Pre-Columbian|Before contact with Europeans]], the natives of North America were divided into many different [[Body politic|polities]], from small [[Band society|bands]] of a few families to large [[empire]]s. They lived in several "[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|culture areas]]", which roughly correspond to [[Geography of North America|geographic and biological zones]] and give a good indication of the main [[lifeway]] or occupation of the people who lived there (e.g. the [[Plains Bison|Bison]] [[hunter-gatherer|hunters]] of the [[Plains Indian|Great Plains]], or the [[farmer]]s of [[Mesoamerica]]). Native groups can also be classified by their [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language family]] (e.g. [[Athabaskan languages|Athapascan]] or [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]]). It is important to note that peoples with similar languages did not always share the same [[material culture]], nor were they always [[allies]].

Scientists believe that the [[Inuit]] people of the high [[Arctic]] came to North America much later than other native groups, as evidenced by the disappearance of [[Dorset culture]] artifacts from the [[archaeological record]], and their replacement by the [[Thule people]].

During the thousands of years of native inhabitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. Archaeologists often name different cultural groups they discover after the site where they are first found. One of the oldest cultures yet found is the [[Clovis culture]] of modern [[New Mexico]]. A more recent example is the group of related cultures called the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]] (e.g. the [[Fort Walton Culture]]), found in the [[Mississippi river]] valley. They flourished from 300 BC to the 150s AD.

The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the [[domestication]] of many common [[Crop (agriculture)|crops]] now used around the world, such as [[tomato]]es and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the world's major staples, [[maize]] (corn).

===History===
As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many important cultural advances were made there. For example, the [[Maya civilization]] developed a [[Maya script|writing system]], built [[Mesoamerican pyramids|huge pyramids and temples]], had a [[Maya calendar|complex calendar]], and developed the concept of zero around 400 CE, a few hundred years after the Mesopotamians.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sciam.com/math/article/id/what-is-the-origin-of-zer | title = What is the origin of zero? How did we indicate nothingness before zero? | author = Robert Kaplan | publisher = [[Scientific American]] | date = January 16, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref> The Mayan culture was still present when the [[Conquistadors|Spanish]] arrived in [[Central America]], but political dominance in the area had shifted to the [[Aztec Empire]] further north.

Upon the arrival of the Europeans in the "[[New World]]", Native American population declined substantially, primarily due to the introduction of European diseases to which the Native Americans lacked immunity.<ref>pp. 42<U+2013>46, ''A Concise History of World Population: An Introduction to Population Processes'', Massimo Livi Bacci, Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing, 2001, 3rd ed., ISBN 0-631-22335-5.</ref> Native peoples found their culture changed drastically. As such, their affiliation with political and cultural groups changed as well, several linguistic groups went [[Language death|extinct]], and others changed quite quickly. The names and cultures that Europeans recorded for the natives were not necessarily the same as the ones they had used a few generations before, or the ones in use today.

The continent is generally delimited on the southeast by the [[Dari<U+00E9>n Gap|Dari<U+00E9>n watershed]] along the [[Colombia]]-[[Panama]] border, or at the [[Panama Canal]]; according to other sources, its southern limit is the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], [[Mexico]], with [[Central America]] tapering and extending southeastward to South America. Before the Central American isthmus was raised, the region had been underwater. The islands of the [[West Indies]] delineate a submerged former [[land bridge]], which had connected North America and South America via what are now [[Florida]] and [[Venezuela]]. Much of North America is on the [[North American Plate]].

The continental coastline is long and irregular. The [[Gulf of Mexico]] is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by [[Hudson Bay]]. Others include the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the [[Gulf of California]].

There are numerous [[island]]s off the continent<U+2019>s coasts: principally, the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Arctic Archipelago]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Turks & Caicos]], the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], the [[Aleutian Islands]] (some of which are in the [[eastern hemisphere]] proper), the [[Alexander Archipelago]], the many thousand islands of the [[British Columbia Coast]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Greenland]], a self-governing [[Denmark|Danish]] island, and the [[list of islands by area|world's largest]], is on the same [[tectonic plate]] (the [[North American Plate]]) and is part of North America geographically. [[Bermuda]] is not part of the Americas, but is an oceanic island which was formed on the fissure of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] over 100&nbsp;million years ago. The nearest landmass to it is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]], and it is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to [[Virginia]] and other parts of the continent.

===Physical geography===
[[File:North america rock types.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[:Image:North america rock sedimentary.jpg|Sedimentary]], [[:Image:North america rock volcanic.jpg|volcanic]], [[:Image:North america rock plutonic.jpg|plutonic]], [[:Image:North america rock metamorphic.jpg|metamorphic]] rock types of North America]]

The vast majority of North America is on the [[North American Plate]]. Parts of [[California]] and western [[Mexico]] form the partial edge of the [[Pacific Plate]], with the two plates meeting along the [[San Andreas fault]]. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] lie on the [[Caribbean Plate]], whereas the [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] and [[Cocos Plate|Cocos plates]] border the North American Plate on its western frontier.

The continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the [[Great Plains]] stretching from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]]; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Great Basin]], [[Geography of California|California]] and [[Alaska]]; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the [[Canadian Shield]] in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the [[Florida]] peninsula. Mexico, with its long [[plateau]]s and [[American cordillera|cordilleras]], falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.

The western mountains are split in the middle and into the main range of the Rockies and the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coast ranges]] in California, [[Oregon]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[British Columbia]] with the Great Basin<U+2014>a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts<U+2014>in between. The highest peak is [[Denali]] in Alaska.

The [http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Geographic%20Centers United States Geographical Survey] states that the geographic center of North America is "6&nbsp;miles west of [[Balta, North Dakota|Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota]]" at approximately {{Coord|48|10|N|100|10|W}}, approximately 15&nbsp;miles (25&nbsp;km) from [[Rugby, North Dakota]]. The USGS further states that <U+201C>No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 States, the conterminous United States, or the North American continent.<U+201D> Nonetheless, there is a 15-foot (4.5&nbsp;m) field stone [[obelisk]] in Rugby claiming to mark the center.

===Human geography===

The prevalent [[languages in North America]] are [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]]. The term [[Anglo-America]] is used to refer to the [[English language|anglophone]] countries of the Americas: namely [[Canada]] (where English and French are co-official) and the [[United States]], but also sometimes [[Belize]] and parts of the [[Caribbean]]. [[Latin America]] refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the United States) where the [[Romance language]]s, derived from [[Latin language|Latin]], of [[Spanish Language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (but [[French Language|French]] speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of [[Central America]] (but not always [[Belize]]), part of the [[Caribbean]] (not the Dutch, English or French speaking areas), [[Mexico]], and most of South America (except [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]] ([[France|FR]]), and The Falkland Islands ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).

The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the province of [[Quebec]] and is co-official with English in the province of [[New Brunswick]]. Other French-speaking locales include the province of [[Ontario]] (the official language is English, but there is an estimated 500,000 Franco-Ontarians), the [[French West Indies]] and [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]], as well as the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]], where French is also an official language. [[Haiti]] is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak [[Haitian Creole language|Creole]] and French. Similarly there remains small segments in [[Saint Lucia]] and the [[Commonwealth of Dominica]] that speak unique French and creole languages alongside their English speaking majorities.

Socially and culturally, North America presents a well-defined entity. Canada and the United States have a similar culture and similar traditions as a result of both countries being [[British America|former British colonies]]. A common cultural and economic market has developed between the two nations because of the strong economic and historical ties. Spanish-speaking North America shares a common past as former [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]]. In Mexico and the Central American countries where civilizations like the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] developed, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] preserve traditions across modern boundaries. Central American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean nations have historically had more in common due to geographical proximity and the fact that, after winning independence from [[Spain]]. Northern Mexico, particularly cities such as [[Monterrey]], [[Tijuana]], [[Ciudad Ju<U+00E1>rez]], and [[Mexicali]] are strongly influenced by the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] and [[American way|way of life of the U.S.]] [[Immigration to the United States]] and [[Immigration to Canada|Canada]] remains a significant attribute of many nations close to the southern border of the U.S. As the [[British Empire]] and its influences declined, the [[Anglophone Caribbean|Anglophone Caribbean states]] have witnessed the economic influence of northern North America increase on the region. In the Anglophone Caribbean this influence is in part due to the fact that the majority of English-speaking Caribbean countries have populations of less than 200,000 people and many of these countries now have [[expatriate]] diasporas living abroad that are larger than those remaining at home.

Economically, Canada and the United States are the wealthiest and most [[developed country|developed nations]] in the continent, followed by Mexico, a [[newly industrialized countries|newly industrialized country]]; the countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of development. The most important [[trade bloc]]s are the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM)]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)]], and the recently signed [[Central American Free Trade Agreement|Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA)]]<U+2014>the last of these being an example of the economic integration sought by the nations of this sub-region as a way to improve their financial status.

Demographically, North America is a racially and ethnically diverse continent. Its three main racial groups are [[White people|Whites]], [[Mestizo]]s and [[Black people|Blacks]] (chiefly [[African-American]]s and [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbeans]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} There is a significant minority of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[Asian people|Asians]] among other less numerous groups.

North America is often divided into subregions but no universally accepted divisions exist. Central America comprises the southern region of the continent, but its northern terminus varies between sources. [[Geophysics|Geophysically]], the region starts at the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in Mexico (namely the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Campeche]], [[Chiapas]], [[Tabasco]], [[Quintana Roo]], and [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110092/Central-America Encyclopaedia Britannica, "Central America"]</ref>). The [[United Nations geoscheme]] includes Mexico in Central America; conversely, the [[European Union]] excludes both Mexico and [[Belize]] from the area.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} [[geopolitics|Geopolitically]], Mexico is frequently not considered a part of Central America.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/8/C0200800.html The American Heritage Dictionary, "Central America"]</ref>

[[Northern America]] is used to refer to the northern countries and territories of North America: Canada, the United States, Greenland, Bermuda, and St. Pierre and Miquelon. They are often considered distinct from the southern portion of the Americas, which largely comprise [[Latin America]]. The term [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] is sometimes used to collectively refer to Mexico, the nations of [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]].

===Historical toponymy===
<!--MERGED IN FROM [[New World]] ON 22 OCT 2007, SOURCES MAY BE OVER THERE-->

North America, in whole or in part, has been historically referred to by other names:
* Spanish North America ([[New Spain]]) was often referred to as ''[[Northern America (disambiguation)|Northern America]]'', and this was the [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|first official name]] given to Mexico.
* The Spanish called North America ''[[Florida]]''<ref>{{cite book |title=The De Soto Chronicles: The Expedition of Hernando De Soto to North America in 1539<U+2013>1543 |last= Clayton|first=Lawrence |authorlink=Lawrence A. Clayton, Vernon James Knight, Jr., and Edward C. Moore|year=1993 |publisher= University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama}}.</ref>, which eventually became more focused on its present location.
* The English called their portion of North America ''[[Virginia]]'' The name Virginia was first applied by Queen Elizabeth I and Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584.<ref>In 1584 [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] sent [[Philip Amadas]] and [[Arthur Barlowe]] to lead an exploration of what is now the [[North Carolina]] coast, and they returned with word of a regional "king" named "Wingina." This was modified later that year by Raleigh and the Queen to "Virginia", perhaps in part noting her status as the "Virgin Queen;" {{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last= Stewart|first=George |authorlink=George R. Stewart|year=1945 |publisher= Random House|location=New York |page= 22}}</ref> [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] pushed to call it ''[[Atlantis]]'' (inspired by [[Plato]]).
* The northern part of North America was often referred to as ''[[Norumbega]]''.
* The northeastern part of what would become the [[United States]] was named ''[[New England]]'' in 1616 in [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]]'s book of that year.
* Western North America was named ''[[Nova Albion]]'' by [[Francis Drake]] as he repaired his boat (''[[Golden Hind]]'') a short distance north of present day [[San Francisco]].
* Areas of past [[Great Britain|British]] control were called [[British North America]].
* Regions under control of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] was called [[Rupert's Land]], which eventually made up a large portion of the [[Dominion of Canada]], the modern [[country]] of Canada.
