'''SMS ''Moltke'''''<ref group=A>"SMS" stands for "Seiner Majest<U+00E4>t Schiff", or "His Majesty's Ship" in  German.</ref> was the [[lead ship]] of the [[Moltke class battlecruiser|''Moltke''-class]] [[battlecruiser]]s of the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]], named after the 19th century German field marshal [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]]. Commissioned on 30 September 1911, the ship was the second battlecruiser commissioned into the Imperial Navy.

''Moltke'', along with her [[sister ship]] [[SMS Goeben|''Goeben'']], was an enlarged version of the previous German battlecruiser design, [[SMS Von der Tann|''Von der Tann'']]. The ship was very similar to ''Von der Tann'', but had increased armor protection and two more main guns in an additional turret. Compared to her British rivals&mdash;the [[Indefatigable class battlecruiser|''Indefatigable'' class]]&mdash;''Moltke'' and her sister ''Goeben'' were significantly larger and better armored.<ref group=A>The ''Indefatigable''-class ships displaced 22,100&nbsp;tons at full load, compared to 25,400&nbsp;tons for ''Moltke''. The ''Indefatigable''-class ships had an armored belt between 4&ndash;6&nbsp;in (10.2&ndash;15.24&nbsp;mm), while ''Moltke''{{'}}s belt was 11&ndash;3&nbsp;in (280&ndash;76.2&nbsp;mm) thick.(Gardiner, pp. 26, 152)</ref>

The ship participated in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the German Navy during the [[First World War]], including the Battles of [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]] in the North Sea, and the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] and [[Operation Albion]] in the Baltic. ''Moltke'' was damaged several times during the war: the ship was hit by heavy caliber gunfire at Jutland, and torpedoed twice by British submarines while on fleet advances. 

Following the end of the war in 1918, ''Moltke'', along with most of the [[High Seas Fleet]], was interned at [[Scapa Flow]] pending a decision by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end when she was [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled]], along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet, in 1919 to prevent them from falling into British hands. The wreck of ''Moltke'' was raised in 1927 and scrapped at [[Rosyth]] from 1927 to 1929.

==Development==
In a conference in May 1907, the Germany Navy Office decided to follow up the unique<ref group=A>The ''Von der Tann'' was unique in that she was the only ship built of her design. All other German battlecruisers came from different [[Ship class|classes]].</ref> [[SMS Von der Tann|''Von der Tann'']] battlecruiser with an enlarged design.<ref name="Staff 11"> Staff, p. 11</ref> 44&nbsp;million marks were allocated for the 1908 fiscal year, which created the possibility of increasing the main guns to 30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) in diameter, instead of the 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) weapons on the preceding design. However, Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], along with the Construction Department, argued that increasing the number of guns from 8 to 10 would be preferable instead of increasing the size of the previous [[Artillery battery|battery]].<ref name="Staff 11" /> The General Navy Department held that for the new design to fight in the [[Line of battle|battle line]], 30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) guns were necessary. Ultimately, Tirpitz and the Construction Department won the debate, and ''Moltke'' was equipped with ten 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) guns. It was also mandated by the Construction Department that armor protection was to be at least as good as that of ''Von der Tann''. The ship was also to have a top speed of at least {{convert|24.5|kn|km/h}}.<ref name="Staff 11" />

During the design process, the ship's weight continued to grow due to the increase in the size of the citadel, armor thickness, the additions to the ammunition stores, and the rearrangement of the boiler system.<ref name="Staff 11" /> The naval arms race between Germany and Britain put a great deal of stress on the Navy design staff, and prompted the decision to build two ships of the new design. They were assigned under the contract names of "Cruiser G" and "Cruiser H." [[Blohm + Voss|Blohm & Voss]] received both contracts in 1908; "Cruiser G" was assigned to the 1908&ndash;1909 building year, while "Cruiser H" was assigned to 1909&ndash;1910.<ref name="Gardiner 152">Gardiner and Gray, p. 152</ref> The contract for "Cruiser G" was awarded on 17 September 1908, under building number 200. The [[keel]] was laid on 7 December 1908, and the ship was launched on 7 April 1910. "Cruiser G" was commissioned on 30 September 1911, as SMS ''Moltke''.<ref name="Staff 12" />

==Service record==
===Pre-war===
At the launching of the ship on 7 April 1910, [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]] christened the ship after his uncle [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]],<ref>R<U+00FC>ger, p. 160</ref> the Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army in the mid 19th century.<ref name="Staff14" /> On 11 September 1911, a crew composed of dockyard workers transferred the ship from [[Hamburg]] to [[Kiel]] through the [[Skagen]].<ref name= "Staff 15"> Staff, p. 15</ref> On 30 September, the ship was commissioned, under the command of ''Kapit<U+00E4>n zur See'' von Mann,<ref name="Staff14" /> and replaced [[SMS Roon|SMS ''Roon'']] in the Reconnaissance Unit. Sea trials continued until 1 April 1912.<ref name= "Staff 15" />

[[File:SMS Moltke Hampton Roads 1912.jpg|thumb|''Moltke'' visiting [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] in 1912]]
She was the first and only German [[capital ship]] to ever visit the [[United States]]. On 11 May 1912 she left Kiel, accompanied by the [[light cruiser]]s [[SMS Stettin|''Stettin'']] and [[SMS Bremen|''Bremen'']], and arrived off [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]], on 30 May 1912. After touring the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] for two weeks, she returned to Kiel on 24 June.<ref name= "Staff 15" />

In July 1912, ''Moltke'' escorted [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II's]] yacht to [[Russia]]. Upon returning, ''Moltke''{{'}}s commander was replaced by ''KzS'' Magnus von Levetzow,<ref name="Staff14" /> and the ship became the Reconnaissance Force flagship until 23 June 1914, when the commander's flag was transferred to the new battlecruiser [[SMS Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']].<ref name= "Staff 15" /> There was some consideration given to deploying ''Moltke'' to the Far East in order to replace the armored cruiser {{SMS|Scharnhorst||2}}, but the plan was abandoned when it became apparent that {{SMS|Goeben||2}} needed replacement in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. ''Moltke'' was then scheduled to transfer to replace her sister ship, but this plan was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I.<ref name= "Staff 15" />

===World War I===
As was the case with almost all German capital ships during [[World War I]], ''Moltke''{{'}}s action was somewhat limited. However, she did participate in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the [[High Seas Fleet]]. At the start of the war, the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of [[Franz von Hipper|Rear Admiral Franz Hipper]].<ref name= "Staff 15" />

====Battle of Heligoland Bight====
{{Main|Battle of Heligoland Bight}}

Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, on 28 August 1914, ''Moltke'' participated in the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]]. During the morning, British cruisers from the [[Harwich Force]] attacked the German destroyers patrolling the Heligoland Bight. Six German light cruisers&mdash;[[SMS K<U+00F6>ln|''K<U+00F6>ln'']], [[SMS Strassburg|''Strassburg'']], [[SMS Stettin|''Stettin'']], [[SMS Frauenlob|''Frauenlob'']], [[SMS Stralsund|''Stralsund'']], and [[SMS Ariadne|''Ariadne'']]&mdash;responded to the attack and inflicted serious damage to the British raiders. However, the arrival at approximately 13:37 of the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]],  quickly put the German ships at a disadvantage.<ref>Tarrant, p. 26</ref>

Along with the rest of the I Scouting Group battlecruisers, ''Moltke'' was stationed in the [[Wilhelmshaven]] Roads on the morning of the battle. By 08:50, Rear Admiral Hipper had requested permission from Admiral [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]], the commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet, to send ''Moltke'' and ''Von der Tann'' to relieve the beleaguered German cruisers.<ref> Massie, p. 107 </ref> ''Moltke'' was ready to sail by 12:10, but the low [[tide]] prevented the ships from being able to pass over the [[Shoal|sand bar]] at the mouth of the [[Jade Estuary]] safely. At 14:10, ''Moltke'' and ''Von der Tann'' were able to cross the Jade bar; Hipper ordered the German cruisers to fall back to his ships, while Hipper himself was about an hour behind in the battlecruiser [[SMS Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']]. At 14:25, the remaining light cruisers<U+2014>''Strassburg'', ''Stettin'', ''Frauenlob'', ''Stralsund'', and ''Ariadne''<U+2014>rendezvoused with the battlecruisers.<ref>Strachan, p. 417</ref> ''Seydlitz'' arrived on the scene by 15:10, while ''Ariadne'' succumbed to battle damage and sank. Hipper ventured forth cautiously to search for the two missing light cruisers, [[SMS Mainz|''Mainz'']] and [[SMS K<U+00F6>ln (1909)|''K<U+00F6>ln'']], which had already sunk. By 16:00, the German flotilla turned around to return to the Jade Estuary, arriving at approximately 20:23.<ref> Massie p. 114 </ref>

====Bombardment of Yarmouth====
{{Main|Raid on Yarmouth}}
On 2 November 1914, ''Moltke'', Rear Admiral Hipper's flagship ''Seydlitz'', ''Von der Tann'', and ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' along with four [[light cruiser]]s left the Jade Estuary and steamed towards the English coast.<ref name="Tarrant30">Tarrant, p. 30</ref> The flotilla arrived off [[Great Yarmouth]] at daybreak the following morning and bombarded the port, while the light cruiser [[SMS Stralsund|''Stralsund'']] laid a minefield. The British submarine [[HMS D5|''D5'']] responded to the bombardment, but struck one of the mines laid by ''Stralsund'' and sank. Shortly thereafter, Hipper ordered his ships to turn back to German waters. However, while Hipper's ships were returning to German waters, a heavy fog covered the Heligoland Bight, so the ships were ordered to halt until visibility improved so they could safely navigate the defensive minefields. The [[armored cruiser]] [[SMS Yorck|''Yorck'']] left the Jade without permission, and while en route to [[Wilhelmshaven]] made a navigational error that led the ship into one of the German minefields. ''Yorck'' struck two mines and quickly sank; the coastal defense ship {{SMS|Hagen||2}} was able to save 127 men of the crew.<ref name="Tarrant30" />

====Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby====
{{main|Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby}}
It was decided by Admiral von Ingenohl that another raid on the English coast was to be carried out, in the hopes of luring a portion of the [[Grand Fleet]] into combat, where it could be destroyed.<ref name="Tarrant30" /> At 03:20 on 15 December, ''Moltke'', ''Seydlitz'', [[SMS Von der Tann|''Von der Tann'']], [[SMS Derfflinger|''Derfflinger'']], and [[SMS Bl<U+00FC>cher|''Bl<U+00FC>cher'']], along with the light cruisers ''Kolberg'', ''Strassburg'', ''Stralsund'', and ''Graudenz'', and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade.<ref name="Tarrant31">Tarrant, p. 31</ref> The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, until they reached the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet, consisting of 14 [[dreadnought]]s and 8 [[pre-dreadnought]]s and a screening force of 2 armored cruisers, 7 light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats, departed to provide distant cover.<ref name="Tarrant31" />

On 26 August 1914, the German light cruiser [[SMS Magdeburg|''Magdeburg'']] had run aground in the [[Gulf of Finland]]; the wreck was captured by the Russian navy, which found code books used by the German navy, along with navigational charts for the North Sea. These documents were then passed on to the Royal Navy. [[Room 40]] began decrypting German signals, and on 14 December, intercepted messages relating to the plan to bombard Scarborough.<ref name="Tarrant31" /> However, the exact details of the plan were unknown, and it was assumed that the High Seas Fleet would remain safely in port, as in the previous bombardment. Vice Admiral Beatty's four battlecruisers, supported by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and the [[Grand Fleet#1st Light Cruiser Squadron|1st Light Cruiser Squadron]], along with the [[Grand Fleet#2nd Battle Squadron|2nd Battle Squadron]]'s six dreadnoughts, were to ambush Hipper's battlecruisers.<ref name="Tarrant32">Tarrant, p. 32</ref>

During the night of 15 December, the main body of the High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat.<ref name="Tarrant32" /> Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. ''Seydlitz'', ''Moltke'', and ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' went north to shell Hartlepool, while ''Von der Tann'' and ''Derfflinger'' went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby.<ref name="Tarrant33">Tarrant, p. 33</ref> During the bombardment of Hartlepool, ''Moltke'' was struck by a 6&nbsp;in (15.2&nbsp;cm) shell from a coastal battery,<ref name="Staff 15" /> which caused minor damage between decks, but no casualties.<ref name="Tarrant33" /> ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was hit six times and ''Seydlitz'' three times by the coastal battery.<ref name="Tarrant33" /> By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.<ref> Scheer, p. 70 </ref>

[[Image:Scheer's illustration of I SG disposition 16 Dec. 1916 en.SVG|thumb|300px|The High Seas Fleet's disposition on the morning of 16 December]] 

By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II&nbsp;Scouting Group began to pass through the British forces searching for Hipper.<ref name="Tarrant34"> Tarrant, p. 34 </ref> One of the cruisers in the [[Grand Fleet#2nd Light Cruiser Squadron|2nd Light Cruiser Squadron]] spotted ''Stralsund'' and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however those were some 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi) ahead.<ref name="Tarrant34" /> The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions.<ref group=A>Beatty had intended to retain only the two rearmost light cruisers from [[William Goodenough|Goodenough's]] squadron; however, [[HMS Nottingham (1913)|''Nottingham'']]'s signalman misinterpreted the signal, thinking that it was intended for the whole squadron, and thus transmitted it to Goodenough, who ordered his ships back into their screening positions ahead of Beatty's battlecruisers.</ref> This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.<ref name="Tarrant34" />

Both the British and the Germans were disappointed that they failed to effectively engage their opponents. Admiral Ingenohl's reputation suffered greatly as a result of his timidity. The captain of the ''Moltke'' was furious; he stated that Ingenohl had turned back "because he was afraid of eleven British destroyers which could have been eliminated...under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing."<ref name="Tarrant35">Tarrant, p. 35</ref> The official German history criticized Ingenohl for failing to use his light forces to determine the size of the British fleet, stating: "he decided on a measure which not only seriously jeopardized his advance forces off the English coast but also deprived the German Fleet of a signal and certain victory."<ref name="Tarrant35" />

====Battle of Dogger Bank====
{{Main|Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)}}

In early January 1915, it became known that British ships were conducting reconnaissance in the [[Dogger Bank]] area. Ingenohl was initially reluctant to destroy these forces, because the I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while ''Von der Tann'' was in drydock for periodic maintenance. However, ''Konteradmiral'' [[Richard Eckermann]], the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet, insisted on the operation, and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank.<ref name="Tarrant36">Tarrant, p. 36</ref>

On 23 January, Hipper sortied, with his flag in ''Seydlitz'', followed by ''Moltke'', ''Derfflinger'', and ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', along with the light cruisers ''Graudenz'', ''Rostock'', ''Stralsund'', and ''Kolberg'' and 19 torpedo boats from V Flotilla and II and XVIII Half-Flotillas. ''Graudenz'' and ''Stralsund'' were assigned to the forward screen, while ''Kolberg'' and ''Rostock'' were assigned to the starboard and port, respectively. Each light cruiser had a half-flotilla of torpedo boats attached.<ref name="Tarrant36" />

Again, interception and decryption of German wireless signals played an important role. Although they were unaware of the exact plans, the cryptographers of Room 40 were able to deduce that Hipper would be conducting an operation in the Dogger Bank area.<ref name="Tarrant36" /> To counter it, Beatty's [[Grand Fleet#1st Battlecruiser Squadron|1st Battlecruiser Squadron]], Rear Admiral Archibald Moore's [[Grand Fleet#2nd Battlecruiser Squadron|2nd Battlecruiser Squadron]] and Commodore [[William Goodenough]]'s [[Grand Fleet#2nd Light Cruiser Squadron|2nd Light Cruiser Squadron]] were to rendezvous with Commodore [[Reginald Tyrwhitt]]'s [[Harwich Force]] at 8:00 on 24 January, approximately {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the Dogger Bank.<ref name="Tarrant36" />

At 08:14, ''Kolberg'' spotted the light cruiser [[HMS Aurora (1913)|HMS ''Aurora'']] and several destroyers from the Harwich Force.<ref name="Tarrant38">Tarrant, p. 38</ref>''Aurora'' challenged ''Kolberg'' with a search light, at which point ''Kolberg'' attacked ''Aurora'' and scored two hits. ''Aurora'' returned fire and scored two hits on ''Kolberg'' in retaliation. Hipper immediately turned his battlecruisers towards the gunfire, when, almost simultaneously, ''Stralsund'' spotted a large amount of smoke to the northwest of her position. This was identified as a number of large British warships, steaming towards Hipper's ships.<ref name="Tarrant38" /> 

Hipper turned south to flee, but was limited to {{convert|23|kn|km/h}}, which was the maximum speed of the older armored cruiser ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''. The pursuing British battlecruisers were steaming at {{convert|27|kn|km/h}}, and quickly caught up to the German ships. At 09:52, [[HMS Lion (1910)|''Lion'']] opened fire on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' from a range of approximately 20,000&nbsp;yards (18,300&nbsp;m); shortly thereafter, [[HMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] and [[HMS Tiger (1913)|''Tiger'']] began firing as well.<ref name="Tarrant38" /> At 10:09, the British guns made their first hit on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''. Two minutes later, the German ships began returning fire, primarily concentrating on ''Lion'', from a range of 18,000&nbsp;yards (15,460&nbsp;m). At 10:28, ''Lion'' was struck on the waterline, which tore a hole in the side of the ship and flooded a coal bunker.<ref name="Tarrant39">Tarrant, p.39</ref> At 10:30, [[HMS New Zealand (1911)|''New Zealand'']], the fourth ship in Beatty's line, came within range of ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' and opened fire. By 10:35, the range had closed to 17,500&nbsp;yards (16,000&nbsp;m), at which point the entire German line was within the effective range of the British ships. Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to engage their German counterparts.<ref group=A>Thus, ''Lion'' on ''Seydlitz'', ''Tiger'' on ''Moltke'', ''Princess Royal'' on ''Derfflinger'', and ''New Zealand'' on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''.</ref> However, confusion aboard ''Tiger'' led the captain to believe  he was to fire on ''Seydlitz'', which left ''Moltke'' able to fire without distraction.<ref name="Tarrant39" />

At 10:40, one of ''Lion''{{'}}s {{convert|13.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} shells struck ''Seydlitz'' causing nearly catastrophic damage that knocked out both of the rear turrets and killed 159 men.<ref name="Tarrant40">Tarrant, p. 40</ref> Disaster was averted when the executive officer ordered the flooding of both magazines to avoid a flash fire that would have destroyed the ship.<ref group=A>This was to have far-reaching consequences, for immediately after the battle, the German Naval Command launched an investigation which resulted in the adoption of anti-flash measures that prevented the type of spectacular explosions that resulted in the destruction of ''Indefatigable'' and ''Queen Mary'' at [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]] a year later.(Tarrant, p. 40) </ref> By this time, the German battlecruisers had zeroed in on ''Lion'' and began scoring repeated hits. At 11:01, an {{convert|11|in|cm|abbr=on}} shell from ''Seydlitz'' struck ''Lion'' and knocked out two of her dynamos. At 11:18, ''Lion'' was hit by two {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} shells from ''Derfflinger'', one of which struck the waterline and penetrated the belt, allowing seawater to enter the port feed tank. This shell eventually crippled ''Lion'' by forcing the ship to turn off its engines due to seawater contamination.<ref name="Tarrant40" />

By this time, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was severely damaged after having been pounded by heavy shells. However, the chase ended when there were several reports of U-boats ahead of the British ships; Beatty quickly ordered  evasive maneuvers, which allowed the German ships to increase the distance to their pursuers.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 40&ndash;41</ref> At this time, ''Lion''{{'}}s last operational dynamo failed, which dropped her speed to 15&nbsp;knots. Beatty, in the stricken ''Lion'', ordered the remaining battlecruisers to "Engage the enemy's rear," but signal confusion caused the ships to solely target ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', allowing ''Moltke'', ''Seydlitz'', and ''Derfflinger'' to escape.<ref>Tarrant, p. 41</ref> By the time Beatty regained control over his ships, after having boarded ''Princess Royal'', the German ships had too far a lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, he broke off the chase.<ref>Tarrant, p. 42</ref>

====Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft====
{{Main|Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft}}

''Moltke'' also took part in the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24&ndash;25&nbsp;April. Hipper was away on sick leave, so the German ships were under the command of Konteradmiral [[Friedrich B<U+00F6>dicker]]. The German battlecruisers ''Derfflinger'', {{SMS|L<U+00FC>tzow||2}}, ''Moltke'', ''Seydlitz'' and ''Von der Tann'' left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 on 24 April, and were supported by a screening force of 6 light cruisers and two torpedo boat flotillas.<ref name= "Tarrant 52"> Tarrant, p. 52 </ref> The heavy units of the High Seas Fleet sailed at 13:40, with the objective to provide distant support for B<U+00F6>dicker's ships. The British Admiralty was made aware of the German sortie through the interception of German [[wireless]] signals, and deployed the Grand Fleet at 15:50.<ref name="Tarrant 52" /> 

By 14:00, B<U+00F6>dicker's ships had reached a position off [[Norderney]], at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of [[Terschelling]]. At 15:38, ''Seydlitz'' struck a [[naval mine]], which tore a 50-foot (15&nbsp;m) hole in her hull, just abaft of the starboard broadside torpedo tube, allowing 1,400&nbsp;short tons (1,250&nbsp;long tons) of water to enter the ship.<ref name="Tarrant 52" /> ''Seydlitz'' turned back, with the screen of light cruisers, at a speed of {{convert|15|kn|km/h}}. The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, ''Seydlitz'' was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow B<U+00F6>dicker to disembark. The torpedo boat {{SMS|V28||2}} brought B<U+00F6>dicker to ''L<U+00FC>tzow''.<ref name="Tarrant 53"> Tarrant, p. 53</ref>

At 04:50 on 25 April, the German battlecruisers were approaching Lowestoft when the light cruisers [[SMS Rostock|''Rostock'']] and [[SMS Elbing|''Elbing'']], which had been covering the southern flank, spotted the light cruisers and destroyers of Commodore Tyrwhitt's Harwich Force.<ref name="Tarrant 53" /> B<U+00F6>dicker refused to be distracted by the British ships, and instead trained his ships' guns on Lowestoft. The German battlecruisers destroyed two 6&nbsp;in(15&nbsp;cm) shore batteries and inflicted other damage to the town. In the process, a single 6&nbsp;in shell from one of the shore batteries struck ''Moltke'', but the ship sustained no significant damage.<ref name= "Staff 15" />

At 05:20, the German raiders turned north, towards Yarmouth, which they reached by 05:42. The visibility was so poor that the German ships fired one [[salvo]] each, with the exception of ''Derfflinger'', which fired fourteen rounds from her main battery. The German ships turned back south, and at 05:47 encountered for the second time the Harwich Force, which had by then been engaged by the six light cruisers of the screening force. B<U+00F6>dicker's ships opened fire from a range of 13,000&nbsp;yards (12,000&nbsp;m).<ref name="Tarrant 54">Tarrant, p. 54</ref> Tyrwhitt immediately turned his ships around and fled south, but not before the cruiser [[HMS Conquest (1915)|''Conquest'']] sustained severe damage. Due to reports of British submarines and torpedo attacks, B<U+00F6>dicker broke off the chase and turned back east towards the High Seas Fleet. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the Grand Fleet's sortie from Scapa Flow, turned back towards Germany.<ref name="Tarrant 54" />

====Battle of the Gulf of Riga====
{{main|Battle of the Gulf of Riga}}

On 3 August 1915, ''Moltke'' was transferred to the Baltic with I Reconnaissance Group (AG) to participate in the foray into the [[Gulf of Riga|Riga Gulf]].  The intention was to destroy the Russian naval forces in the area, including the [[pre-dreadnought]] [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']], and to use the minelayer {{SMS|Deutschland|1914|2}} to block the entrance to Moon Sound with naval mines. The German forces, under the command of Vice Admiral Hipper, included the four [[Nassau class battleship|''Nassau''-class]] and four [[Helgoland class battleship|''Helgoland''-class]] battleships, the battlecruisers ''Moltke'', ''Von der Tann'', and ''Seydlitz'', and a number of smaller craft.<ref>Halpern, p. 196</ref>
  
On 8 August, the first attempt to clear the gulf was made; the old battleships [[SMS Braunschweig|''Braunschweig'']] and [[SMS Elsa<U+00DF>|''Elsa<U+00DF>'']] kept the ''Slava'' at bay while minesweepers cleared a path through the inner belt of mines. During this period, the rest of the German fleet remained in the Baltic and provided protection against other units of the Russian fleet. However, the approach of nightfall meant that ''Deutschland'' would be unable to mine the entrance to Moon Sound in time, and so the operation was broken off.<ref>Halpern, pp. 196&ndash;197</ref>

On 16 August, a second attempt was made to enter the gulf. The dreadnoughts [[SMS Nassau|''Nassau'']] and [[SMS Posen|''Posen'']], four light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats breached the defenses to the gulf.<ref>Halpern, p. 197</ref> ''Nassau'' and ''Posen'' engaged in an artillery duel with ''Slava'', resulting in three hits on the Russian ship that prompted her withdrawal. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the gulf on 19 August, but reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the gulf the following day.<ref>Halpern, pp. 197&ndash;198</ref>

Throughout the operation, ''Moltke'' remained in the Baltic and provided cover for the assault into the Gulf of Riga. On the morning of the 19th, ''Moltke'' was torpedoed by the British [[British E class submarine|E class]] submarine [[HMS E1|HMS ''E1'']]. The torpedo was not spotted until it was approximately 200&nbsp;yards (183&nbsp;m) away; without time to maneuver, the ship was struck in the bow torpedo room. The explosion damaged several torpedoes in the ship, but they did not detonate themselves. Eight men were killed, and {{convert|435|t|ST}} of water entered the ship. The ship was repaired at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, between 23 August and 20 September.<ref name= "Staff 15" />

====Battle of Jutland====
{{main|Battle of Jutland}}
''Moltke'', and the rest of Hipper's battlecruisers in the I Scouting Group, lay anchored in the outer Jade Roads on the night of 30 May 1916. The following morning, at 02:00&nbsp;[[Central European Time|CET]],<ref group=A>It should be noted that the times mentioned in this section are in [[Central European Time|CET]], which is congruent with the German perspective. This is one hour ahead of [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], the time zone commonly used in British works.</ref> the ships slowly steamed out towards the  [[Skagerrak]] at a speed of {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}.<ref name="Tarrant62">Tarrant, p. 62</ref> ''Moltke'' was the fourth ship in the line of five, ahead of ''Von der Tann'', and to the rear of ''Seydlitz''.<ref name="Tarrant62" /> The II Scouting Group, consisting of the light cruisers [[SMS Frankfurt|''Frankfurt'']], Rear Admiral [[Friedrich B<U+00F6>dicker|B<U+00F6>dicker]]'s flagship, [[SMS Wiesbaden|''Wiesbaden'']], [[SMS Pillau|''Pillau'']], and [[SMS Elbing|''Elbing'']], and 30 torpedo boats of the II, VI, and IX Flotillas, accompanied Hipper's battlecruisers.<ref name="Tarrant62" /> 

An hour and a half later, the High Seas Fleet under the command of Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer|Scheer]] left the Jade; the force was composed of 16 dreadnoughts.<ref group=A>{{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig Albert}} was in dock at the time.</ref> The High Seas Fleet was accompanied by the IV Scouting Group, composed of the light cruisers {{SMS|Stettin||2}}, {{SMS|M<U+00FC>nchen||2}}, {{SMS|Hamburg||2}}, {{SMS|Frauenlob||2}}, and {{SMS|Stuttgart||2}}, and 31 torpedo boats of the I, III, V, and VII Flotillas, led by the light cruiser ''Rostock''. The six pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron had departed from the Elbe roads at 02:45, and rendezvoused with the battle fleet at 5:00.<ref name="Tarrant62" />

Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force encountered Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty's]] battlecruiser squadron. The German ships were the first to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards(14,000&nbsp;m).<ref>Bennett, p. 183 </ref> When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in ''Moltke'' being engaged by both ''New Zealand'' and ''Tiger''.<ref group=A>''Tiger'' misread the "distribution of fire" signal hoisted by Beatty's flagship ''Lion''.</ref> The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. At 16:52, ''Moltke'' hit ''Tiger'' with two main gun shells, but neither of these hits caused any significant damage. ''Moltke'' then fired a further four shells, two of which hit simultaneously on the midships and after turrets, knocking both out for a significant period of the battle.<ref>Tarrant, p. 92</ref>

[[File:HMS Indefatigable sinking.jpg|thumb|left|The destruction of ''Indefatigable'']]
Approximately 15&nbsp;minutes later, the British battlecruiser [[HMS Indefatigable (1909)|''Indefatigable'']] was suddenly destroyed by ''Von der Tann''. Shortly thereafter, ''Moltke'' fired four torpedoes at ''Queen Mary'' at a range between 11,500&ndash;10,400&nbsp;yards (10,515&ndash;9,509&nbsp;m).<ref>Tarrant, p. 95</ref> This caused the British line to fall into disarray, as the torpedoes were thought to have been fired by U-boats. At this point, Hipper's battlecruisers had come into range of the V Battle Squadron, composed of the new [[Queen Elizabeth class battleship|''Queen Elizabeth''-class battleships]], which mounted powerful {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} guns. At 17:06, [[HMS Barham (04)|''Barham'']] opened fire on ''Von der Tann''. She  was joined a few minutes later by [[HMS Valiant (1914)|''Valiant'']], [[HMS Malaya (1915)|''Malaya'']], and [[HMS Warspite (03)|''Warspite'']]; the ships concentrated their fire on ''Von der Tann'' and ''Moltke''.<ref>Tarrant, p. 96</ref> At 17:16, one of the 15&nbsp;in shells from the fast battleships struck ''Moltke'', where it pierced a coal bunker, tore into a casemate deck, and ignited ammunition stored therein. The explosion burned the ammunition hoist down to the magazine.<ref name="Tarrant97">Tarrant, p. 97</ref>

''Von der Tann'' and ''Moltke'' changed their speed and direction, which threw off the aim of the V Battle Squadron and earned the battered ships a short respite.<ref name="Tarrant97" /> While ''Moltke'' and ''Von der Tann'' were drawing the fire of the V Battle Squadron battleships, ''Seydlitz'' and ''Derfflinger'' were able to concentrate their fire on the British battlecruisers; between 17:25 and 17:30, at least five shells from ''Seydlitz'' and ''Derfflinger'' struck ''Queen Mary'', causing a catastrophic explosion that destroyed the ship.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 100&ndash;101</ref> ''Moltke''{{'}}s commander, [[Captain at Sea|''Kapit<U+00E4>n zur See'']] von Karpf, remarked that "The enemy's salvos lie well and close; their salvos are fired in rapid succession, the fire discipline is excellent!"<ref>Hawkins, p. 157</ref>

By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, which was by that point pursuing the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack.<ref>Tarrant, p. 150</ref> However, he had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered the main body of the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire.<ref>Tarrant, p. 152</ref> Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 152&ndash;153</ref>

''Moltke'' and the other battlecruisers<ref group=A>With the exception of ''L<U+00FC>tzow'', which had lost speed and was unable to keep up</ref> followed the move, which put them astern of ''K<U+00F6>nig''.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 155&ndash;156</ref> Hipper's badly battered ships gained a temporary moment of respite, and uncertainty over the exact location and course of Scheer's ships led Admiral [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Jellicoe]] to turn his ships eastward, towards what he thought was the likely path of the German retreat.<ref>Tarrant, p. 163</ref> The German fleet was instead sailing west, but Scheer ordered a second 16-point turn, which reversed course and pointed his ships at the center of the British fleet.<ref>Tarrant, p. 165</ref> The German fleet came under intense fire from the British line, and Scheer sent ''Moltke'', ''Von der Tann'', ''Seydlitz'', and ''Derfflinger'' at high speed towards the British fleet, in an attempt to disrupt their formation and gain time for his main force to retreat.<ref>Tarrant, p. 173</ref> By 20:17, the German battlecruisers had closed to within 7,700&nbsp;yards (7,040&nbsp;m) of [[HMS Colossus (1910)|HMS ''Colossus'']], at which point Scheer directed the ships to engage the lead ship of the British line.<ref>Tarrant, p. 179</ref> However, three minutes later, the German battlecruisers turned in retreat, covered by a torpedo boat attack.<ref>Tarrant, p. 181</ref>

A pause in the battle at dusk allowed ''Moltke'' and the other German battlecruisers to cut away wreckage that interfered with the main guns, extinguish fires, repair the fire control and signal equipment, and ready the searchlights for nighttime action. During this period, the German fleet reorganized into a well-ordered formation in reverse order, when the German light forces encountered the British screen shortly after 21:00. The renewed gunfire gained Beatty's attention, so he turned his battlecruisers westward. At 21:09, he sighted the German battlecruisers, and drew to within 8,500&nbsp;yards before opening fire at 20:20.<ref name="Tarrant193">Tarrant, p. 193</ref> The attack from the British battlecruisers completely surprised Hipper, who had been in the process of boarding ''Moltke'' from the torpedo boat {{SMS|G39||2}}. The German ships returned fire with every gun available, and at 21:32 hit both ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'' in the darkness.<ref name="Tarrant195">Tarrant, p. 195</ref> The maneuvering of the German battlecruisers forced the leading I Battle Squadron to turn westward to avoid collision. This brought the pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron directly behind the battlecruisers, and prevented the British ships from pursuing the German battlecruisers when they turned southward. The British battlecruisers opened fire on the old battleships; the German ships turned southwest to bring all of their guns to bear against the British ships.<ref name="Tarrant195" />

By 22:15, Hipper was finally able to transfer to ''Moltke'', and then ordered his ships to steam at {{convert|20|kn|km/h}} towards the head of the German line.<ref>Tarrant, p. 213</ref> However, only ''Moltke'' and ''Seydlitz'' were in condition to comply; ''Derfflinger'' and ''Von der Tann'' could make at most 18&nbsp;knots, and so these ships lagged behind. ''Moltke'' and ''Seydlitz'' were in the process of steaming to the front of the line when the ships passed close to ''Stettin'', which forced the ship to drastically slow down to avoid collision. This forced ''Frauenlob'', ''Stuttgart'', and ''M<U+00FC>nchen'' to turn to port, which led them into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; at a range of 800&nbsp;yards (751&nbsp;m), the cruisers on both sides pummeled each other. Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]] decided to attempt to lure the British cruisers towards ''Moltke'' and ''Seydlitz''. However, nearly simultaneously, the heavily damaged British cruisers broke off the attack.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 213&ndash;214</ref> As the light cruisers were disengaging, a torpedo fired by [[HMS Southampton (1912)|''Southampton'']] struck ''Frauenlob'', and the ship exploded.<ref name="Tarrant214">Tarrant, p. 214</ref> The German formation fell into disarray, and in the confusion, ''Seydlitz'' lost sight of ''Moltke''. ''Seydlitz'' was no longer able to keep up with ''Moltke''{{'}}s 22&nbsp;knots, and so detached herself to proceed to the Horns Reef lighthouse independently.<ref name="Tarrant214" />

By 23:30 on her own, ''Moltke'' encountered four British dreadnoughts, from the rear division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. ''Moltke''{{'}}s commander ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>n]]'' von Karpf ordered the ship to swing away, hoping he had not been detected. The British ships in fact had seen ''Moltke'', but had decided to not to open fire in order to not reveal their location to the entire German fleet.<ref name="Tarrant215">Tarrant, p. 215</ref> At 23:55, and again at 00:20, ''Kapit<U+00E4>n'' von Karpf tried to find a path through the British fleet, but both times was unable to do so. It was not until 01:00, after having steamed far ahead of the Grand Fleet, that ''Moltke'' was able to made good her escape.<ref name="Tarrant215" /> 

[[File:Seydlitz badly damaged.jpg|thumb|right|The severely damaged ''Seydlitz'' returning to port after the battle]]
Close to the end of the battle, at 03:55, Hipper transmitted a report to Admiral Scheer informing him of the tremendous damage his ships had suffered. By that time, ''Derfflinger'' and ''Von der Tann'' each had only two guns in operation, ''Moltke'' was flooded with 1,000&nbsp;tons of water, and ''Seydlitz'' was severely damaged.<ref name="Tarrant255">Tarrant, p. 255</ref> Hipper reported: "I Scouting Group was therefore no longer of any value for a serious engagement, and was consequently directed to return to harbour by the Commander-in-Chief, while he himself determined to await developments off Horns Reef with the battlefleet."<ref name="Tarrant255" />

During the course of the battle, ''Moltke'' had hit ''Tiger'' 13 times, and was hit herself 4 times, all by {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} shells. The starboard No.&nbsp;5 15&nbsp;cm gun was struck by one of the 15&nbsp;in shells and put out of action for the remainder of the battle. The ship suffered 16 dead and 20 wounded, the majority of which were due to the hit on the 15&nbsp;cm gun. Flooding and counter-flooding efforts caused 1,000&nbsp;tons of water to enter the ship.<ref name="Staff16">Staff, p. 16</ref>

====Later operations====
During the fleet advance on 18&ndash;19&nbsp;August, the I&nbsp;Scouting Group was to bombard the coastal town of [[Sunderland]] in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. As ''Moltke'' was one of only two remaining German battlecruisers still in fighting condition in the Group (''Von der Tann'' being the other), three dreadnoughts were assigned to the Group for the operation: [[SMS Markgraf|''Markgraf'']], [[SMS Gro<U+00DF>er Kurf<U+00FC>rst (1913)|''Gro<U+00DF>er Kurf<U+00FC>rst'']], and the newly commissioned [[SMS Bayern (1915)|''Bayern'']]. Admiral Scheer and the rest of the High Seas Fleet, with 15 dreadnoughts of its own, would trail behind and provide cover.<ref> Massie, p. 682 </ref> The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11&nbsp;weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.<ref> Massie, p. 683 </ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-017-32, Besetzung Insel <U+00D6>sel, Linienschiff und Zeppelin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Moltke'' during Operation Albion, with a [[zeppelin]] overhead]]
In September 1917, ''KzS'' von Karpf left ''Moltke''; ''KzS'' Gygas assumed command of the ship. Between September and October 1917, the ship took part in [[Operation Albion]] supporting the German invasion of the Russian islands of [[Saaremaa|<U+00D6>sel]], [[Hiiumaa|Dag<U+00F6>]], and [[Muhu|Moon]] (in present-day [[Estonia]]). Following the successful operation in the Baltic, ''Moltke'' was detached to support the II Reconnaissance Group (II AG), but did not actively participate in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]].<ref name="Staff16" />

Late 1917 saw the High Seas Fleet beginning to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, two British convoys to Norway were intercepted and destroyed by German cruisers and destroyers, prompting Beatty, now the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys.<ref>Massie, p. 747</ref> This presented to Admiral Scheer the opportunity for which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet.<ref name="Massie748">Massie, p. 748</ref>

At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the High Seas Fleet left harbor with the intention of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation.<ref name="Massie748" /> At 05:10 on 24 April, ''Moltke'' suffered machinery failure: the starboard propeller had fallen off the shaft, and before the turbine could be stopped, a gear wheel was destroyed.<ref name="Massie748" /> The destroyed wheel flung pieces of steel into an auxiliary condenser, which flooded the engine room and stopped the operation of the center and starboard engines. Saltwater entered the boilers, reducing the ship's speed to a mere four knots; by 08:45, the captain of ''Moltke'' reported to Scheer that his ship was "out of control",<ref name="Massie748" /> and that the ship would need to be towed. At 09:38, the cruiser [[SMS Strassburg|''Strassburg'']] attempted to take the ship under tow, but was unable to do so. At 10:13, the dreadnought [[SMS Oldenburg (1910)|''Oldenburg'']] was detached from the battle fleet to tow ''Moltke'' back to port.<ref name="Staff17">Staff, p. 17</ref> At 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters. By 17:10, ''Moltke''{{'}}s engines had been repaired, and the ship was able to steam at a speed of 17&nbsp;knots.<ref name="Staff17" /> At 19:37, the British submarine [[HMS E42|''E42'']] spotted the ship and fired a torpedo into ''Moltke''. The ship took in 1,800&nbsp;tons of water, but was able to reach harbor under her own power.<ref>Massie, p. 749</ref> Repairs were carried out in Wilhelmshaven in the Imperial Dockyard, between 30 April and 9 September 1918.<ref name="Staff17" />

Following repairs, ''Moltke'' took part in training operations in the Baltic from 19 September to 3 October. Starting on 1 November, the ship served as the I Scouting Group flagship for Rear Admiral von Reuter.<ref name="Staff17" />

===Fate===
[[Image:German battlecruisers steaming to Scapa.jpg|thumb|right|''Seydlitz'' leading the German battlecruisers into internment; ''Moltke'' is the second ship in the line]]
''Moltke'' was to have taken part in what would have amounted to the "death ride" of the High Seas Fleet shortly before the end of World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; [[Reinhard Scheer|Scheer]]&mdash;by now the ''[[Grand Admiral|Gro<U+00DF>admiral]]'' of the fleet&mdash;intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 280&ndash;281</ref> However, while the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, war-weary sailors began deserting en masse. As ''Von der Tann'' and [[SMS Derfflinger|''Derfflinger'']] passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven's inner harbour and roadstead, some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore.<ref> Massie, p. 775</ref> 

On 24 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on several battleships [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|mutinied]]; three ships from the III&nbsp;Squadron refused to weigh anchors, and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships [[SMS Th<U+00FC>ringen|''Th<U+00FC>ringen'']] and [[SMS Helgoland|''Helgoland'']]. The order to sail was rescinded in the face of this open revolt. A month later, the [[German Revolution of 1918<U+2013>19|German Revolution]]  began; it toppled the monarchy and led to the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]] that ended the war.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 281&ndash;282</ref>

The vessel was surrendered with the rest of the High Seas Fleet on 24 November 1918 and interned at [[Scapa Flow]], under the command of ''Kapit<U+00E4>n-Leutnant'' Wollante.<ref>Reuter, p. 154</ref> Believing that the [[Treaty of Versailles]] had been signed and his fleet was about to be seized by the British, Rear Admiral von Reuter ordered the [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttling]] of the High Seas Fleet on 21 June 1919, while the British Grand Fleet was away on exercises.  The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes.<ref>Reuter, p. 153</ref> ''Moltke'' was raised in 1927 and scrapped at [[Rosyth]] in 1929.<ref>Hore, p. 72 </ref>
