'''Mahmoud Asgari''' ({{PerB|<U+0645><U+062D><U+0645><U+0648><U+062F> <U+0639><U+0633><U+06AF><U+0631><U+064A>}}) and '''Ayaz Marhoni''' ({{PerB|<U+0639><U+064A><U+0627><U+0636> <U+0645><U+0631><U+0647><U+0648><U+0646><U+064A>}}) were [[Iran|Iranian]] teenagers from the province of [[Khuzestan]] who were [[hanging|hanged]] in Edalat (Justice) Square in [[Mashhad]], northeast [[Iran]], on [[July 19]] [[2005]]. The case attracted international attention due to the age of the boys, and the claim that they were put to death for consensual [[gay]] [[sex]].

The [[execution (legal)|execution]]s were first reported in English by the [[United Kingdom|British]] campaigning group [[OutRage!]], who claimed that the [[Iranian Students' News Agency]], in an online article on the day of the executions, indicated that the two were executed because they had been caught having sex with each other. This claim has been challenged by Hadi Ghaemi, [[Human Rights Watch]]'s Iran researcher and a native [[Persian language|Persian]] speaker, who said that the ISNA article was titled "Lavat beh Onf." He translated the title as "homosexual act by coercion".  [http://isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-556874]

==Background==
Most interpretations of [[Sharia|Shari'a]] (Islamic Law), calls for the [[death penalty]] for homosexual acts, but the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], of which Iran is a signatory, forbids the execution of [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]]s. According to Asgari's lawyer, Rohollah Razaz Zadeh, "death sentences handed to children by Iranian courts are supposed to be commuted to five years in jail," [http://www.nyblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=1786], but the [[Supreme Court]] in [[Tehran]] upheld the [[death sentence]]. The ages of the boys remains unclear, with some sources claiming they were fourteen and sixteen at the time of their arrests and sixteen and eighteen when executed, and others claiming that the older boy, Marhoni, was already nineteen, and therefore not a [[minor (law)|minor]], when the alleged crime(s) took place.

On [[July 20]] [[2005]] the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|National Council of Resistance]] released a press release about the executions, stating that: "The victims were charged with disrupting public order among other things" [http://www.ncr-iran.org/content/view/222/69/]. No other charges were indicated. OutRage sent out a press release based on a mistranslation of an Iranian news agency story, claiming they were gay. Because of this, and the highly emotive photographs, it became - perhaps wrongly - a gay "cause celebre".

==International concern==
On [[July 22]] [[2005]], [[Amnesty International]] issued a news release saying:

<blockquote>According to reports, they were convicted of sexual assault on a 13-year-old boy and had been detained 14 months ago. Prior to their execution, the two were also given 228 lashes each for drinking, disturbing the peace and theft" [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE130382005].</blockquote> The claim that they raped a 13 year old boy while drunk and holding a knife to his throat, and then stole his bicycle, is supported by the alleged victim's father.

In Tehran, Nobel Peace laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]] decried the imposition of the death penalty on minors and discounted the government's allegation that the two had raped younger boys in the northeastern part of the country. [http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/07/072505Iran.htm]

[[OutRage!]], the [[London]]-based [[gay rights]] campaigning group, also disputed these allegations about the hanged boys, citing "clandestine gay and lesbian activists inside Iran, members of the democratic and left Iranian opposition, and the websites of pro-government news agencies in Iran" as sources. [http://outrage.nabumedia.com/pressrelease.asp?ID=303] OutRage! member [[Peter Tatchell]] pointed to the executions of over four thousand Iranian [[lesbian]]s and gay men since 1979, and stated the executions were "... just the latest barbarity by the Islamo-fascists in Iran." [http://outrage.nabumedia.com/pressrelease.asp?ID=302].

Both [[Sweden]] and The [[Netherlands]] responded to the executions by announcing that they will immediately halt extraditions of gays to Iran.  The Dutch government also announced that its Ministry of Foreign Affairs would investigate the treatment of gays and lesbians in the Islamic state, and would immediately halt all extraditions of gay Iranian asylum-seekers.  Civil rights groups in the US, [[United Kingdom]] and [[Russia]] have also called for the creation of  similar policies [http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/07/073105holland.htm].

Not all groups, however, agreed that the case was one of anti-gay persecution: Paula Ettelbrick, executive director of the International Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission has stated, "It was not a gay case." [http://www.nyblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=1786]. [[United States|U.S.]] [[Congressman]] [[Tom Lantos]], on the other hand, characterized the executions as violations of Iran's obligations under international law and a sign of bias against gays:

<blockquote>"This sickening episode shines a bright light on the severe shortcomings of the Iranian legal system. No matter what legal sources or traditions a country bases its law upon, there is no justification for whipping and executing people amid an angry mob <U+2014> particularly not when the convicts committed offenses while they were minors, who are specifically protected under international law. And in this case, authorities apparently chose to play on deep-seated feelings of bigotry toward homosexuality." [http://www.nyblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=1786]</blockquote>

Others were concerned as to why this incident had got so much western coverage, and saw it as part of a right-wing propaganda effective, preparing for a US/Israel attack on Iran. 
They asked about gay rights in Saudi Arabia, Cameroon, Poland, Egypt, and why these weren't give equal prominence.

== Aftermath ==
"It was not a gay case," said Paula Ettelbrick, executive director of the International Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission, taking issue with the Human Rights Campaign<U+2019>s statement that was quick to condemn the execution as anti-gay. "We would welcome HRC<U+2019>s involvement in demanding that our government speak out on human rights violations. It was just the wrong case,<U+201D> she said.[http://www.washblade.com/2005/7-29/news/worldnews/iran.cfm]

Ettelbrick said she was also disturbed by the racially charged language used by some gay rights groups to condemn the execution, such as when Peter Tatchell of Outrage said in a statement, "This is just the latest barbarity by the Islamo-fascists in Iran."[http://www.washblade.com/2005/7-29/news/worldnews/iran.cfm] . 

In March 2006 Dutch Immigration Minister [[Rita Verdonk]] ("Iron Rita") proposed an end to a moratorium on deporting gay asylum-seekers to Iran, stating that it was now clear "that there is no question of executions or death sentences based solely on the fact that a defendant is gay", adding that homosexuality was never the primary charge against people.[http://www.handsoffcain.org/archivio_news/index.php?iddocumento=8309665&mover=0]. Under parliamentary pressure she was forced to extend the moratorium on deportation for a further six months. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/03/08/nether12776.htm]

According to the immigration minister the Iranian government had made it clear that the teenagers were not hanged because they were homosexual but because they were found guilty of the [[abduction]] and [[rape]] of a minor.[http://www.handsoffcain.org/archivio_news/index.php?iddocumento=8309665&mover=0]

The one year anniversary of the hangings in Mashad was designated an International Day of Action Against Homophobic Persecution in Iran by [[OutRage!]]{{fact}} and IDAHO (the International Day Against Homophobia), with vigils planned for Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Frankfurt, London, Marseille, Mexico City, Moscow, New York, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Stockholm, Tehran, Toronto, Vancouver, Vienna, Warsaw, and Washington, D.C., and with hearings planned in the British House of Commons. <U+201C>Men and women suspected of homosexual conduct in Iran face the threat of execution,<U+201D> affirmed Scott Long of Human Rights Watch<U+2019>s gay-rights program. <U+201C>We have documented brutal floggings imposed by courts as punishment, and torture and ill treatment, including sexual abuse, in police custody.<U+201D> Outrage organised a meeting at the House of Common led by Chris Bryant, a pro-war gay Labour MP. Exiled gay Iranians have asked how the call from the right for western states to condemn Iranian homophobia will help homosexuals in Iran.

Whilst it is possible and plausible Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni were executed for "being gay", no one in the west has been able to provide any evidence for this.

== Trivia ==
The new album by [[Pet Shop Boys]], ''[[Fundamental (Pet Shop Boys album)|Fundamental]]'' (released on [[May 22]], [[2006]]), is "Dedicated to Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni".
