'''Alexandra of Denmark''' (Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia; 1 December 1844 <U+2013> 20 November 1925) was [[List of British consorts|Queen of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]] and [[Empress of India]] from 1901 to 1910 as the [[Queen consort|consort]] of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]].

Her family had been relatively obscure until [[Christian IX of Denmark|her father]] was chosen with the consent of the [[great power]]s to succeed [[Frederick VII of Denmark|his distant cousin]] to the Danish throne. At the age of sixteen she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the heir of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. They married eighteen months later. As [[Princess of Wales]] from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, she won the hearts of the British people and became immensely popular; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women. Although she was largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of ministers and her family to favour her relations who reigned in [[Greece]] and [[Denmark]]. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work.

On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, Albert Edward became [[King-Emperor]] as Edward VII, with Alexandra as Queen-Empress consort. From Edward's death in 1910 until her own death, she was the [[Queen Mother]], being a queen and the mother of the reigning monarch, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], though she was more generally styled ''Her Majesty'' '''Queen Alexandra'''. She greatly distrusted her nephew, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]], and supported her son during [[World War I]], in which Britain and its allies defeated Germany.

==Early life==

'''Princess Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia''', or "'''Alix'''", as her immediate family knew her, was born at the [[Yellow Palace]], an 18th-century town house at 18 Amaliegade, right next to the [[Amalienborg Palace]] complex in [[Copenhagen]].<ref name="Eilers"/> Her father was [[Christian IX of Denmark|Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl<U+00FC>cksburg]] and her mother was Princess [[Louise of Hesse-Cassel]].<ref name="bp">[[Hugh Massingberd|Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh (ed.)]] (1977). ''Burke's Royal Families of the World'', Volume 1. (London: [[Burke's Peerage]]). ISBN 0-220-66222-3. pp. 69<U+2013>70</ref> Although she was of royal blood,<ref>Her mother and father were both great-grandchildren of King [[Frederick V of Denmark]] and great-great-grandchildren of King [[George II of Great Britain]].</ref> her family lived a comparatively normal life. They did not possess great wealth; her father's income from an army commission was about [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]800 per year and their house was a rent-free [[grace and favour]] property.<ref>Duff, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref> Occasionally, [[Hans Christian Andersen]] was invited to call and tell the children stories before bedtime.<ref>Duff, p. 18</ref>

In 1848, King [[Christian VIII of Denmark]] died and his only son, [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick]] ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, had been through two unsuccessful marriages, and was assumed to be infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both [[Denmark]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]], and the succession rules of each were different. In Holstein, the [[Salic law]] prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of [[Prussia]]. In 1852, the [[great power]]s called a conference in [[London]] to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl<U+00FC>cksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own [[Princess Louise Charlotte of Denmark|mother-in-law]], [[Frederick William of Hesse|brother-in-law]] and wife) were surrendered.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 8</ref><ref>[[Michael Maclagan|Maclagan, Michael]]; Louda, Ji<U+0159><U+00ED> (1999). ''Lines of Succession'' (London: Little, Brown). ISBN 0-85605-469-1. p. 49</ref>

Prince Christian was given the title Prince of Denmark and his family moved into a new official residence, [[Bernstorff Palace]]. Although the family's status had risen, there was no or little increase in their income and they did not participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick's third wife and former mistress, [[Louise Rasmussen]], because she had an illegitimate child by a previous lover.<ref>Duff, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref> Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dagmar]] (later Empress of Russia), made her own clothes and waited at table along with her sisters.<ref name="priestley">Priestley, p. 17</ref> At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught [[English language|English]] by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was [[Confirmation|confirmed]] in [[Christiansborg Palace]].<ref>Duff, p. 21</ref> Alexandra was devout throughout her life, and followed [[High Church]] beliefs.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 125 and 176</ref> Alexandra, together with her sister Dagmar, was given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of swimming for women, [[Nancy Edberg]].<ref>[http://www.ub.gu.se/fasta/laban/erez/kvinnohistoriska/tidskrifter/idun/1890/pdf/1890_15.pdf  Idun (1890): Nr 15 (121) (Swedish)]</ref>

==Marriage and family==
[[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and her husband, [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]], were already concerned with finding a bride for their son and heir, Albert Edward, the [[Prince of Wales]]. They enlisted the aid of their daughter, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia]], in seeking a suitable candidate. Alexandra was not their first choice, since the Danes were at loggerheads with the Prussians over the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] and most of the [[British royal family]]'s relations were German. Eventually, after rejecting other possibilities, they settled on her as "the only one to be chosen".<ref>Prince Albert quoted in Duff, p. 31</ref>

On 24 September 1861, Crown Princess Victoria introduced her brother Albert Edward to Alexandra at [[Speyer]], but it was not until almost a year later on 9 September 1862 (after his affair with [[Nellie Clifden]] and the death of his father) that Albert Edward proposed to Alexandra at the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]], the home of his great-uncle, King [[Leopold I of Belgium]].<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 27<U+2013>37; Bentley-Cranch, p. 44 and Duff, p. 43</ref>

[[Image:AlexandraGravesend.jpg|thumb|right|''The Landing of H.R.H. the Princess Alexandra at Gravesend, 7 March 1863'', by [[Henry Nelson O'Neil]] (1864, [[National Maritime Museum]])]]

A few months later, Alexandra travelled from Denmark to the United Kingdom aboard the royal yacht [[HMY Victoria and Albert II|''Victoria and Albert II'']] and arrived in [[Gravesend, Kent]], on 7 March 1863.<ref>[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp05859&rNo=0&role=sit ''The Landing of HRH The Princess Alexandra at Gravesend, 7th March 1863''], National Portrait Gallery, retrieved on 16 July 2009</ref> Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]] composed music for her arrival and [[Alfred Tennyson]], the [[Poet Laureate]], wrote an ode in Alexandra's honour:

{{quote|Sea King's daughter from over the sea,<br />
Alexandra!<br />
Saxon and Norman and Dane are we,<br />
But all of us Danes in our welcome of thee,<br />
Alexandra!
|''A Welcome to Alexandra'', [[Alfred Tennyson]]}}

The couple were married on 10 March 1863 at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]] by [[Charles Longley|Thomas Longley]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Her bridesmaids were The Ladies [[Lady Diana Huddleston|Diana Beauclerk]], [[Victoria Kerr, Marchioness of Lothian|Victoria Montagu-Douglas-Scott]], [[Lady Victoria Howard|Victoria Howard]], [[Elma Hovell-Thurlow-Cumming-Bruce, Baroness Thurlow|Elma Bruce]], [[Lady Agneta Montagu|Agneta Yorke]], [[Emily Russell, Baroness Ampthill|Emily Villiers]], [[Eleanor Heneage, Baroness Heneage|Eleanor Hare]] and [[Feodora Bertie, Viscountess Bertie of Thame|Feodora Wellesley]].</ref> The choice of venue was criticised in the press (as it was outside London large public crowds would not be able to view the spectacle), by prospective guests (it was awkward to get to and, as the venue was small, some people who had expected invitations were not invited) and the Danes (as only Alexandra's closest relations were invited). The court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac or mauve.<ref>Duff, pp. 48<U+2013>50</ref> The couple were seen off on their honeymoon at [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] by the schoolboys of neighbouring [[Eton College]], who included [[Lord Randolph Churchill]].<ref>Duff, p. 60</ref>

[[Image:C19 interior 009.jpg|thumb|left|1863 bust of Alexandra, in [[Halifax Town Hall]]]]
By the end of the following year, Alexandra's father had ascended the throne of Denmark, [[George I of Greece|her brother George]] had become [[King of the Hellenes]], [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|her sister Dagmar]] was engaged to the [[Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia|Tsarevitch of Russia]],<ref>Nicholas died within a few months of the engagement and she married his brother, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander]], instead.</ref> and Alexandra had given birth to her first child. Her father's accession gave rise to [[Second War of Schleswig|further conflict over the fate of Schleswig-Holstein]]. The [[German Confederation]] successfully invaded Denmark, reducing the area of Denmark by two-fifths. To the great irritation of Queen Victoria and the Crown Princess of Prussia, Alexandra and Albert Edward supported the Danish side in the war. The [[Prussia]]n conquest of former Danish lands heightened Alexandra's profound dislike of the Germans, a feeling which stayed with her for the rest of her life.<ref name=purdue>Purdue, A. W.

Alexandra's first child, Albert Victor, was born two months premature in early 1864. Alexandra was devoted to her children: "She was in her glory when she could run up to the nursery, put on a flannel apron, wash the children herself and see them asleep in their little beds."<ref>Mrs. Blackburn, the head nurse, quoted in Duff, p. 115</ref> Albert Edward and Alexandra had six children in total: [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Albert Victor]], [[George V of the United Kingdom|George]], [[Princess Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Louise]], [[Princess Victoria Alexandra of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], [[Maud of Wales|Maud]], and [[Prince Alexander John of Wales|John]]. All of Alexandra's children were apparently born prematurely; biographer [[Richard Hough]] thought Alexandra deliberately misled Queen Victoria as to her probable delivery dates, as she did not want the Queen to be present at their births.<ref>Hough, p. 116</ref> During the birth of her third child in 1867, the added complication of a bout of [[rheumatic fever]] threatened Alexandra's life, leaving her with a permanent limp.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 82<U+2013>86 and Duff, pp. 73 and 81</ref>

In public Alexandra was dignified and charming, and in private affectionate and jolly.<ref name="priestley" /><ref>Battiscombe, pp. 127, 222<U+2013>223</ref> She enjoyed many social activities, including dancing and ice-skating, and was an expert horsewoman and [[Combined driving|tandem driver]].<ref>Duff, p. 143</ref> She also enjoyed [[hunting]], to the dismay of [[Queen Victoria]], who asked her to stop, without success.<ref>Hough, p. 102</ref> Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some friction between the Queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the Queen's partiality towards them.<ref name=purdue/>

[[File:Alexandra of Denmark02.jpg|right|thumb|Alexandra, circa 1889]]
Albert Edward and Alexandra visited Ireland in April 1868. After her illness the previous year, she had only just begun to walk again without the aid of two walking sticks, and was already pregnant with her fourth child.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 94</ref> They undertook a six-month tour taking in [[Austria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]] over 1868<U+2013>9, which included visits to her brother, King [[George I of Greece]], the [[Crimea]]n battlefields and, for her only, the harem of the [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]]. In [[Turkey]] she became the first woman to sit down to dinner with the Sultan ([[Abd<U+00FC>l<U+00E2>ziz]]).<ref>Duff, pp. 93<U+2013>100</ref>

Albert Edward and Alexandra made [[Sandringham House]] their preferred residence, with [[Marlborough House]] their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage was in many ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of [[typhoid fever]] (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation.<ref>Duff, p. 111 and [[Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|Philip Magnus]] quoted in Battiscombe, pp. 109<U+2013>110</ref> This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 110</ref> Nevertheless, Edward was severely criticized from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with [[rheumatic fever]].<ref>Hough, pp. 132-134</ref> Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, among them the actress [[Lillie Langtry]]; [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick]]; humanitarian [[Agnes Keyser]]; and society matron [[Alice Keppel]]. Most of these were with the full knowledge of Alexandra, who later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the King as he lay dying.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 271 and Priestley, p. 18 and 180</ref> Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 100<U+2013>101</ref>

An increasing degree of deafness, caused by hereditary [[otosclerosis]], led to Alexandra's social isolation; she spent more time at home with her children and pets.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 88 and Duff, p. 82</ref> Her sixth and final pregnancy ended in tragedy when her infant son died after only a day of life. Despite Alexandra's pleas for privacy, Queen Victoria insisted on announcing a period of court mourning, which led to unsympathetic elements of the press to describe the birth as "a wretched abortion" and the funeral arrangements as "sickening mummery".<ref>Duff, p. 85</ref>

For eight months over 1875<U+2013>6, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain on a tour of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The Prince had planned an all-male group and intended to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the Prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, [[Earl of Aylesford|Lord Aylesford]], was told by his wife that she was going to leave him for another man: [[George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough|Lord Blandford]], who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir [[Knollys (family)|William Knollys]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|the Duchess of Teck]], Alexandra informed the Queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The Prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 132<U+2013>135</ref>

Alexandra spent the spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of the Hellenes.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 136</ref> During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877<U+2013>1878)]], Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a revision of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 150<U+2013>152</ref> Alexandra and her two sons spent the next three years largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 155<U+2013>156</ref> In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to [[Saint Petersburg]] after the assassination of [[Alexander II of Russia]], both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister, who was now the [[Tsaritsa|Tsarina]].<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 157<U+2013>160 and Duff, p. 131</ref>

Alexandra undertook many public duties; in the words of Queen Victoria, "to spare me the strain and fatigue of functions. She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals in my place&nbsp;... she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty."<ref>Queen Victoria quoted in Duff, p. 146</ref> She took a particular interest in the [[London Hospital]], visiting it regularly. [[Joseph Merrick]], the so-called "Elephant Man", was one of the patients whom she met.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 257<U+2013>258 and Duff, pp. 148<U+2013>151</ref> Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously,<ref>Battiscombe, p. 166</ref> but during a visit to Ireland in 1885, she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the [[City of Cork]], a hotbed of [[Irish nationalism]]. She, and her husband, were booed by a crowd of two or three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags. She smiled her way through the ordeal, and the British press still portrayed the visit in a positive light, describing the crowds as "enthusiastic".<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' quoted in Battiscombe, p. 168</ref> As part of the same visit, she received a Doctorate in Music from [[Trinity College, Dublin]].<ref>Battiscombe, p. 167</ref>

The death of her eldest son, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]], in 1892 was a serious blow to the tender-hearted Alexandra, and his room and possessions were kept exactly as he had left them, much as those of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] were left after his death in 1861.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 189<U+2013>193, 197 and Duff, p. 184</ref> She said, "I have buried my angel and with him my happiness."<ref>Alexandra quoted in Duff, p. 186</ref> Surviving letters between Alexandra and her children indicate that they were mutually devoted.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 141<U+2013>142</ref> In 1894, her brother-in-law, [[Alexander III of Russia]], died and her nephew, [[Nicholas II of Russia]] became [[Tsar]]. Alexandra's widowed sister, [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|the Dowager Empress]], leant heavily on her for support; Alexandra slept, prayed and stayed beside her sister for the next two weeks until Alexander's burial.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 205 and Duff, pp. 196<U+2013>197</ref>

==Queen Alexandra==

===Queen Consort===
With the death of her mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, in 1901, Alexandra became queen-empress consort to the new king. Just two months later, her surviving son George and daughter-in-law [[Mary of Teck|Mary]], left on an extensive tour of the empire, leaving their young children in the care of Alexandra and Edward, who doted on their grandchildren. On George's return, preparations for the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of Edward and Alexandra were well in hand. Just a few days before the scheduled coronation in June 1902, however, Edward became seriously ill with [[appendicitis]]. Alexandra deputised for him at a military parade, and attended [[Ascot Racecourse|the Royal Ascot races]] without him, in an attempt to prevent public alarm.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 243<U+2013>244</ref> Eventually, the coronation had to be postponed and Edward had an operation to drain the infected appendix. After his recovery, Alexandra and Edward were crowned together in August: he by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Frederick Temple]], and she by the [[Archbishop of York]], [[William Dalrymple Maclagan]].<ref>Battiscombe, p. 249</ref>

Despite now being queen, Alexandra's duties changed little, and she kept many of the same retainers. Alexandra's [[Woman of the Bedchamber]], [[Charlotte Knollys]], served Alexandra loyally for many years. On 10 December 1903, Charlotte, the daughter of Sir William Knollys, woke to find her bedroom full of smoke. She roused Alexandra and shepherded her to safety. In the words of [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge|Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], "We must give credit to old Charlotte for ''really'' saving [Alexandra's] life."<ref>Battiscombe, p. 253</ref>

Alexandra again looked after her grandchildren when George and Mary went on a second tour, this time to [[British India]], over the winter of 1905<U+2013>6.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 258</ref> Her father, King Christian IX of Denmark, died that January. Eager to retain their family links, to both each other and to Denmark, in 1907 Alexandra and her sister, the Dowager Empress of Russia, purchased a villa north of Copenhagen, Hvid<U+00F8>re, as a private getaway.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 262 and Duff, pp. 239<U+2013>240</ref>

Biographers have asserted that Alexandra was denied access to the King's briefing papers and excluded from some of the King's foreign tours to prevent her meddling in diplomatic matters.<ref>Duff, pp. 225<U+2013>227</ref> She was deeply distrustful of Germans, and invariably opposed anything that favoured German expansion or interests. For example, in 1890 Alexandra wrote a memorandum, distributed to senior British ministers and military personnel, warning against the planned exchange of the British [[North Sea]] island of [[Heligoland]] for the German colony of [[Zanzibar]], pointing out Heligoland's strategic significance and that it could be used either by Germany to launch an attack, or by Britain to contain German aggression.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 176<U+2013>179</ref> Despite this, the exchange went ahead anyway. The Germans fortified the island and, in the words of [[Robert Ensor]] and as Alexandra had predicted, it "became the keystone of Germany's maritime position for offence as well as for defence".<ref>Ensor, p. 194</ref> The ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' was outspoken in its condemnation of Alexandra and her sister, the Dowager Empress of Russia, saying that the pair were "the centre of the international anti-German conspiracy".<ref>Quoted in Duff, p. 234</ref> She despised and distrusted her nephew, [[Wilhelm II of Germany]], calling him in 1900 "inwardly our enemy".<ref>Duff, pp. 207 and 239</ref>

In 1910, Alexandra became the first queen consort to visit the [[British House of Commons]] during a debate. In a remarkable departure from precedent, for two hours she sat in the Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the [[Parliament Act 1911|Parliament Bill]], a bill to reform the role of the [[House of Lords]], was debated.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 269</ref> Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 278</ref> Shortly afterward, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in [[Corfu]]. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe.<ref>Duff, pp. 249<U+2013>250</ref> She told [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby|Frederick Ponsonby]], "I feel as if I had been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all."<ref>Ponsonby's memoirs quoted in Duff, p. 251</ref> Later that year, she moved out of [[Buckingham Palace]] to [[Marlborough House]], but she retained possession of Sandringham.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 274 and Windsor, p. 77</ref> The new king, Alexandra's son [[George V of the United Kingdom|George]], soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported the King's decision to help force the bill through Parliament at the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s request but against the wishes of the House of Lords when the reforming party won elections to the House of Commons.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 277<U+2013>278</ref>

===Queen Mother===
[[Image:Alexandra of Denmark.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Queen Alexandra, 1923]]
She did not attend her son's coronation in 1911 since it was not customary for a crowned queen to attend the coronation of another king or queen, but otherwise continued the public side of her life, devoting time to her charitable causes. One such cause included [[Alexandra Rose Day]], where artificial roses made by the disabled were sold in aid of hospitals by women volunteers.<ref>Duff, pp. 251<U+2013>257 and 260</ref><ref>The [[Alexandra Rose Day]] fund still exists; its patron is [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy]], Alexandra's great-granddaughter.</ref> During the [[World War I|First World War]], the custom of hanging the banners of foreign princes invested with Britain's highest order of knighthood, the [[Order of the Garter]], in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], came under criticism, as the German members of the Order were fighting against Britain. Alexandra joined calls to "have down those hateful German banners".<ref name="banners">Alexandra to King George V, quoted in Battiscombe, p. 285</ref> Driven by public opinion, but against his own wishes, the King had the banners removed but to Alexandra's dismay he had down not only "those vile Prussian banners" but also those of her relations who were, in her opinion, "simply soldiers or vassals under that brutal German Emperor's orders".<ref name="banners" /> On 17 September 1916, she was at Sandringham during a [[Zeppelin]] air raid,<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 291<U+2013>292</ref> but far worse was to befall the royalty of Europe. In Russia, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] was overthrown and he, his wife and children were killed by revolutionaries. The Dowager Empress was rescued from Russia in 1919 by [[HMS Marlborough (1912)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and brought to England where she lived for some time with her sister, Alexandra.<ref>Duff, pp. 285<U+2013>286</ref>

Alexandra retained a youthful appearance into her senior years,<ref>e.g. [[Mary Gladstone]] and [[Robert Wynn Carrington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], quoted in Battiscombe, p. 206; [[Margot Asquith]], quoted in Battiscombe, pp. 216<U+2013>217; [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher]] quoted in Battiscombe, p. 232</ref> but during the war her age caught up with her.<ref>Alexandra herself and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] quoted by Battiscombe, p. 296</ref> She took to wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup, which was described by gossipy women as having her face "enamelled".<ref name="priestley" /> She made no more trips abroad, and suffered increasing ill-health. In 1920, a blood vessel in her eye burst, leaving her partially blind temporarily.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 299</ref> Towards the end of her life, her memory and speech became impaired.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 301<U+2013>302</ref> She died on 20 November 1925 at [[Sandringham House|Sandringham]] after suffering a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and was buried in an elaborate tomb next to her husband in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].<ref name="Eilers">Eilers, Marlene A., ''Queen Victoria's Descendants'', p. 171</ref>

==Legacy==
{{See|Royal eponyms in Canada}}
[[File:Queen Alexandra Memorial CCC.jpg|right|thumb|The Queen Alexandra Memorial, situated opposite [[St. James's Palace]]]]
The Queen Alexandra Memorial by [[Alfred Gilbert]] was unveiled on 8 June 1932 (Alexandra Rose Day) at Marlborough Gate, London.<ref>Dorment, Richard (January 1980). "Alfred Gilbert's Memorial to Queen Alexandra" ''The Burlington Magazine'' vol. CXXII pp. 47<U+2013>54</ref> An ode in her memory, [[Queen Alexandra's Memorial Ode|"So many true princesses who have gone"]], composed by the then [[Master of the King's Musick]] Sir [[Edward Elgar]] to words by the [[Poet Laureate]] [[John Masefield]], was sung at the unveiling and conducted by the composer.<ref>"Alexandra The Rose Queen" ''[[The Times]]'', 9 June 1932 p. 13 col. F</ref>

Alexandra was highly popular with the British public.<ref name="priestley" /><ref>Battiscombe, pp. 66<U+2013>68, 85, 120, and 215, and Duff, p. 215</ref> Unlike her husband and mother-in-law, she was not castigated by the press.<ref>Duff, pp. 113, 163 and 192</ref> Funds that she helped to collect were used to buy a river launch, called ''Alexandra'', to ferry the wounded during the [[Mahdist War|Sudan campaign]],<ref>Battiscombe, p. 169</ref> and to fit out a hospital ship, named ''The Princess of Wales'', to bring back wounded from the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].<ref>Battiscombe, p. 212<U+2013>213 and Duff, p. 206</ref> During the Boer War, she also founded Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, later renamed [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]].

She had little understanding of money.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 72</ref> The management of her finances was left in the hands of her loyal [[Comptroller]], Sir [[Dighton Probyn]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], who undertook a similar role for her husband. In the words of her grandson, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] (later the Duke of Windsor), "Her generosity was a source of embarrassment to her financial advisers. Whenever she received a letter soliciting money, a cheque would be sent by the next post, regardless of the authenticity of the mendicant and without having the case investigated."<ref>Windsor, pp. 85<U+2013>86</ref> Though she was not always extravagant (she had her old stockings darned for re-use and her old dresses were recycled as furniture covers),<ref name="b203">Battiscombe, p. 203</ref> she would dismiss protests about her heavy spending with a wave of a hand or by claiming that she had not heard.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 293</ref>

She hid a small scar on her neck, which was likely the result of a childhood operation,<ref>[[Christian Friedrich Freiherr von Stockmar|Baron Stockmar]], who was a doctor, quoted in Duff, p. 37</ref> by wearing [[choker]] necklaces and high necklines, setting fashions which were adopted for fifty years.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref> Alexandra's effect on fashion was so profound that society ladies even copied her limping gait, after her serious illness in 1867 left her with a stiff leg.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 92</ref> She used predominantly the London fashion houses; her favourite was [[Redfern (couture)|Redfern's]], but she shopped occasionally at [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Doucet]] and Fromont of Paris.<ref name="b203"/>

Queen Alexandra has been portrayed on British television by [[Deborah Grant (actress)|Deborah Grant]] and Helen Ryan in ''[[Edward the Seventh]]'', Ann Firbank in ''Lillie'', [[Maggie Smith]] in ''[[All the King's Men (TV programme)|All the King's Men]]'', and [[Bibi Andersson]] in ''[[The Lost Prince]]''. In a 1980 stage play by [[Royce Ryton]], ''Motherdear'', she was portrayed by [[Margaret Lockwood]] in her last acting role.
