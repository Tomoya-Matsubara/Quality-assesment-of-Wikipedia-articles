'''''Bruhathkayosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|r|u<U+02D0>|<U+02CC>|h|<U+00E6>|<U+03B8>|k|e<U+026A>|.|<U+0275>|<U+02C8>|s|<U+0254>r|<U+0259>|s}}; meaning "huge bodied lizard") might have been the largest [[dinosaur]] that ever lived. The accuracy of this claim, however, has been mired in controversy and debate. All the estimates are based on Yadagiri and Ayyasami's 1989 paper, which announced the find.<ref name="YadagiriAyyasami"/> 

The authors originally classified the dinosaur as a [[Theropoda|theropod]], a member of a large group of [[biped]]al, mostly [[carnivore|carnivorous]] dinosaurs that includes ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', but several unpublished opinions beginning in 1995 suggested that the remains actually belonged to a [[sauropod]] (probably a [[titanosaur]]), a member of a very different group of [[quadruped]]al, [[herbivore|herbivorous]] dinosaurs with long necks and tails. In 2006, the first published reference to ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' as a sauropod appeared in a survey of [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] [[vertebrate]]s by David Krause and colleagues.<ref name="krauseetal2006">Krause, D.W., O'Connor, P.M., Curry Rogers, K., Sampson, S.D., Buckley, G.A., and Rogers, R.R. (2006). "Late Cretaceous terrestrial vertebrates from Madagascar: Implications for Latin American biogeography." ''Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden'', '''93'''(2): 178-208.</ref>

Until the remains are properly described, the validity of the genus and any size estimates will be questionable.

==Discovery==
''Bruhathkayosaurus'' was found near the southern tip of [[India]], specifically in the [[Tiruchirappalli]] district of [[Tamil Nadu]], to the northeast of Kallamedu village. It was recovered from the rocks of the Kallemedu Formation, which are dated to the Maastrichtian [[faunal stage]] of the late [[Cretaceous]] period. It lived toward the end of [[Mesozoic]] Era, about 70 [[million years ago]]. The fossilized remains include [[hip]] bones (the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] and [[ischium]]), part of a leg bone ([[femur]]), a shin bone ([[tibia]]), a forearm ([[radius (bone)|radius]]) and a tail bone (part of a [[vertebra]], specifically a platycoelous caudal centrum). The remains were originally classified as belonging to a [[carnosauria|carnosaur]].<ref name="YadagiriAyyasami">Yadagiri, P. and Ayyasami, K. (1989). "A carnosaurian dinosaur from the Kallamedu Formation (Maestrichtian horizon), Tamilnadu." In M.V.A. Sastry, V.V. Sastry, C.G.K. Ramanujam, H.M. Kapoor, B.R. Jagannatha Rao, P.P. Satsangi, and U.B. Mathur (eds.), ''Symposium on Three Decades of Development in Palaeontology and Stratigraphy in India. Volume 1. Precambrian to Mesozoic. Geological Society of India Special Publication'', '''11'''(1): 523-528.</ref> The name chosen, ''Bruhathkayosaurus'', is derived from ''bruhath'' ([[South India]]n transliteration of [[Sanskrit]] ''b<U+1E5B>hat'' {{lang|inc|[[:wikt:<U+092C><U+0943><U+0939><U+0924><U+094D>|<U+092C><U+0943><U+0939><U+0924><U+094D>]]}}, 'huge, heavy') and ''k<U+0101>ya'' (<U+0915><U+093E><U+092F> 'body'), plus the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''sauros'' ([[lizard]]).

==Classification==
The ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' [[genus]] has only one known [[species]],  ''Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi''. The species is represented by the [[holotype]] specimen GSI PAL/SR/20, which was described by Yadagiri and Ayyasami in 1989 (not 1987, as some sources indicate). It was originally classified as a [[carnosauria|carnosaur]] (like ''[[Allosaurus]]''), of an unknown (''incertae sedis'') [[family (biology)|family]]. It was later recognized as a [[sauropoda|sauropod]].

The original publication described little in the way of diagnostic characteristics and was only supported by a few line drawings. This has led to speculation that the bones might actually be [[petrified wood]], akin to the way the original discoverers of ''[[Sauroposeidon]]'' initially believed their find to be [[fossil]]ized tree trunks.

==Size estimates==
According to the published description, the shin bone ([[tibia]]) of ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' is 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft) long. This is 29&nbsp;percent larger than the tibia of  ''Argentinosaurus'', which is only 1.55&nbsp;m (5.08&nbsp;ft) long. Comparing the bones in the upper forelimb gives a similar result. While the [[humerus]] of ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' is incomplete, it is extrapolated to have been 2.34&nbsp;m (7.68&nbsp;ft) long. This is 30&nbsp;percent larger than the humerus of ''Argentinosaurus'', which is 1.81&nbsp;m (5.94&nbsp;ft) long.

No total body size estimates for ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' have been published, but paleontologists and researchers have posted tentative estimates on the [[Internet]]. One early estimate by Mickey Mortimer estimated that ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' could have reached 40<U+2013>44&nbsp;m (130<U+2013>145&nbsp;ft) in length and to have weighed 175<U+2013>220 tons.<ref name="mortimer2001a">Mortimer, M.

Accessed 23 May 2008.</ref> However, Mortimer later retracted these estimates, reducing his estimated length of ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' to 28<U+2013>34&nbsp;m (90<U+2013>110&nbsp;ft), and declined to provide a new weight estimate, describing the older mass estimates as inaccurate.<ref name="mortimer2001b">Mortimer, M.

Accessed 23 May 2008.</ref> In a May 2008 article for the [[weblog]] ''Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week'', paleontologist Matt Wedel used a comparison with ''Argentinosaurus'' and calculated the weight of ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' at up to 139 tons.<ref name="wedel2008">Wedel, M.

Accessed 23 May 2008.</ref>

By comparison, the titanosaur ''Argentinosaurus'' is estimated to have reached 34.6&nbsp;m (114&nbsp;ft) in length, and to have weighed 80<U+2013>100 tons. Another huge titanosaurid, ''[[Paralititan]]'', was probably 31.9&nbsp;m (105&nbsp;ft) long, and weighed 65<U+2013>80 tons.<ref name=Smithetal>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=J.B. |coauthors=Lamanna, M.C.; Lacovara, K.J.; Dodson, P.; Smith, J.R.; Poole, J.C.; Giegengack, R.; and Attia, Y. |year=2001 |title=A giant sauropod dinosaur from an Upper Cretaceous mangrove deposit in Egypt |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5522 |pages=1704<U+2013>1706 |doi=10.1126/science.1060561 |pmid=11387472}}</ref> All of these sauropods are known only from partial or fragmentary remains, so the size estimates are uncertain. Length is calculated by comparing existing bones to the bones of similar dinosaurs, which are known from more complete skeletons and scaling them up isometrically. However, such extrapolation can never be more than an educated guess and the length of the tail, in particular, is often hard to judge. Determining mass is even more difficult, because little evidence of soft tissues survives in the [[fossil record]]. In addition, [[isometric]] scaling is based on the assumption that body proportions remain the same, which is not necessarily the case. In particular, the proportions of the titanosaurs are not well known, due to a limited number of relatively complete specimens.

If the size estimates for ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' are accurate, the only other animal approaching its size would be the [[Blue Whale]]. Mature Blue Whales can reach 30&nbsp;m (98&nbsp;ft) in length,<ref>{{Cite book
| title = Blue Whales
| author = J. Calambokidis and G. Steiger
| year = 1998
| publisher = Voyageur Press
| isbn = 0-89658-338-4}}</ref> which is a little shorter than ''Bruhathkayosaurus'', but the record-holder Blue Whale weighed in at 176 tons,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/question687.htm | title = What is the biggest animal ever to exist on Earth? | publisher = How Stuff Works | accessdate = 2007-05-29}}</ref> which is probably heavier than ''Bruhathkayosaurus''.

Among the dinosaurs, only another poorly known specimen may approach or exceed ''Bruhathkayosaurus'' in size. [[Edward Drinker Cope]]'s ''[[Amphicoelias]] fragillimus'' would have been longer, reaching 56<U+2013>62&nbsp;m (185<U+2013>200&nbsp;ft) in length, but it was a slender [[diplodocid]], weighing only 120 tons. However, the only bone recovered (a massive vertebra) is now missing, and only a description and drawing of the specimen remain.<ref name="carpenter2006">Carpenter, K. (2006).
