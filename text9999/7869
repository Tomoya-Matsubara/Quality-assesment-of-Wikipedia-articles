'''El Ni<U+00F1>o''' is the warm phase of the [[El Ni<U+00F1>o Southern Oscillation]] (commonly called ENSO) and is associated with a band of warm ocean water that develops in  the central and east-central equatorial Pacific (between approximately the [[International Date Line]] and 120<U+00B0>W), including off the Pacific coast of South America.  [[El Ni<U+00F1>o Southern Oscillation]] refers to the cycle of warm and cold temperatures, as measured by [[sea surface temperature]], SST, of the tropical central and eastern Pacific Ocean.  El Ni<U+00F1>o is accompanied by high [[Surface pressure|air pressure]] in the western Pacific and low air pressure in the eastern Pacific.  The cool phase of ENSO is called "La Ni<U+00F1>a" with SST in the eastern Pacific below average and air pressures high in the eastern and low in western Pacific.  The ENSO cycle, both El Ni<U+00F1>o and La Ni<U+00F1>a, causes global changes of both temperatures and rainfall.<ref name="CPC ENSO">{{cite web | author = [[Climate Prediction Center]] | publisher = [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]] | title = Frequently Asked Questions about El Ni<U+00F1>o and La Ni<U+00F1>a | url = http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#DIFFER | date = 2005-12-19 | accessdate = 2009-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

Developing countries dependent upon agriculture and fishing, particularly those bordering the Pacific Ocean, are the most affected. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the capitalized term "El Ni<U+00F1>o" refers to the [[Child Jesus|Christ child]], Jesus (literal translation "The (male) Child"). La Ni<U+00F1>a, chosen as the 'opposite' of El Ni<U+00F1>o, literally means "The (female) Child). El Ni<U+00F1>o was so named because periodic warming in the Pacific near [[South America]] is often noticed around [[Christmas]].<ref name="DFG">{{cite web |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/marine/elnino.asp |title=El Ni<U+00F1>o Information |work=California Department of Fish and Game, Marine Region}}</ref>

==Definition==
El Ni<U+00F1>o is defined by prolonged warming in the Pacific Ocean [[sea surface temperature]]s when compared with the average value. The U.S [[NOAA]] definition is a 3 month average warming of at least 0.5&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (0.9&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in a specific area of the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean, other organizations define the term slightly differently. Typically, this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of two to seven years, and lasts nine months to two years.<ref name="autogenerated2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#HOWOFTEN|title=ENSO FAQ: How often do El Ni<U+00F1>o and La Ni<U+00F1>a typically occur?|accessdate=2009-07-26|date=2005-12-19|author=[[Climate Prediction Center]]|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]}}</ref> The average period length is five years.

El Ni<U+00F1>o's warm rush of nutrient-poor water heated by its eastward passage in the Equatorial Current, replaces the cold, nutrient-rich surface water of the [[Humboldt Current]]. When El Ni<U+00F1>o conditions last for many months, extensive ocean warming and the reduction in easterly trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water, and its economic impact to local fishing for an international market can be serious.<ref name="deadfish">{{cite web|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/eln/home.rxml|title=El Ni<U+00F1>o|date=1998-04-28|accessdate=2009-07-17|author=WW2010|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}}</ref>

More generally, El Ni<U+00F1>o can affect commodity prices and the macroeconomy of different countries - and not always for the worst. It can constrain the supply of rain-driven agricultural commodities; reduce agricultural output, construction, and services activities; create food-price and generalised inflation; and may trigger social unrest in commodity-dependent poor countries that primarily rely on imported food.<ref name="University of Cambridge">{{cite web |title=Study reveals economic impact of El Ni<U+00F1>o|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-economic-impact-of-el-nino|date=2014-07-11|accessdate=2014-07-25|publisher=University of Cambridge}}</ref> A University of Cambridge Working Paper shows that while Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa face a short-lived fall in economic activity in response to an El Ni<U+00F1>o shock, other countries may actually benefit from an El Ni<U+00F1>o weather shock (either directly or indirectly through positive spillovers from major trading partners), for instance, Argentina, Canada, Mexico and the United States.

==Effects of ENSO warm phase (El Ni<U+00F1>o)==

===South America===
Because El Ni<U+00F1>o's warm pool feeds thunderstorms above, it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern Pacific Ocean, including several portions of the South American west coast. The effects of El Ni<U+00F1>o in South America are direct and stronger than in North America. An El Ni<U+00F1>o is associated with warm and very wet weather months in April<U+2013>October along the coasts of northern [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]], causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme.<ref>{{cite web |title=Atmospheric Consequences of El Ni<U+00F1>o | publisher =University of Illinois |url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/eln/atms.rxml |accessdate=2010-05-31}}</ref> The effects during the months of February, March, and April may become critical. Along the west coast of [[South America]], El Ni<U+00F1>o reduces the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water that sustains large [[fish]] populations, which in turn sustain abundant sea birds, whose droppings support the [[fertilizer]] industry. The reduction in upwelling leads to [[fish kill]]s off the shore of Peru.<ref name="deadfish"/>

The local fishing industry along the affected coastline can suffer during long-lasting El Ni<U+00F1>o events. The world's largest fishery collapsed due to overfishing during the 1972 El Ni<U+00F1>o [[Peruvian anchoveta]] reduction. During the 1982<U+2013>83 event, [[mackerel|jack mackerel]] and anchoveta populations were reduced, [[scallop]]s increased in warmer water, but [[hake]] followed cooler water down the continental slope, while [[shrimp]] and [[sardines]] moved southward, so some catches decreased while others increased.<ref name="Pearcy1987">{{cite journal |last1=Pearcy |first1=W.

Shifting locations and types of fish due to changing conditions provide challenges for fishing industries. Peruvian [[sardine]]s have moved during El Ni<U+00F1>o events to [[Chile]]an areas. Other conditions provide further complications, such as the government of Chile in 1991 creating restrictions on the fishing areas for self-employed fishermen and industrial fleets.

The ENSO variability may contribute to the great success of small, fast-growing species along the Peruvian coast, as periods of low population removes predators in the area. Similar effects benefit [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds that travel each spring from predator-rich tropical areas to distant winter-stressed nesting areas.

Southern [[Brazil]] and northern [[Argentina]] also experience wetter than normal conditions, but mainly during the spring and early summer. Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall, and the Peruvian-Bolivian [[Altiplano]] is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events. Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the [[Amazon River]] Basin, [[Colombia]], and [[Central America]].

The synoptic condition for the Tehuantepecer is associated with [[high-pressure system]] forming in [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca|Sierra Madre]] of Mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front, which causes winds to accelerate through the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts, between October and February, with a summer maximum in July caused by the westward extension of the Azores-Bermuda high pressure system.

It may be that the observed phenomenon of more frequent and stronger El Ni<U+00F1>o events occurs only in the initial phase of the global warming, and then (e.g., after the lower layers of the ocean get warmer, as well), El Ni<U+00F1>o will become weaker than it was.<ref name="Meehl2006">{{cite doi|10.1007/s00382-005-0098-0}}</ref> It may also be that the stabilizing and destabilizing forces influencing the phenomenon will eventually compensate for each other.<ref name="Philip2006">{{cite doi|10.1029/2006GL026196}}</ref> More research is needed to provide a better answer to that question.

==Health and social impacts of El Ni<U+00F1>o==
Extreme weather conditions related to the El Ni<U+00F1>o cycle correlate with changes in the incidence of [[epidemic]] diseases. For example, the El Ni<U+00F1>o cycle is associated with increased risks of some of the diseases transmitted by [[mosquito]]es, such as [[malaria]], [[dengue]], and [[Rift Valley fever]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}. Cycles of malaria in [[India]], [[Venezuela]], [[Brazil]], and [[Colombia]] have now been linked to El Ni<U+00F1>o. Outbreaks of another mosquito-transmitted disease, Australian encephalitis ([[Murray Valley encephalitis virus|Murray Valley encephalitis]]<U+2014>MVE), occur in temperate south-east Australia after heavy rainfall and flooding, which are associated with La Ni<U+00F1>a events. A severe outbreak of Rift Valley fever occurred after extreme rainfall in north-eastern Kenya and southern Somalia during the 1997<U+2013>98 El Ni<U+00F1>o.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allcountries.org/health/el_nino_and_its_health_impact.html |title=El Ni<U+00F1>o and its health impact |work=Health Topics A to Z |accessdate=2011-01-01}}

An early recorded mention of the term "El Ni<U+00F1>o" to refer to climate occurred in 1892, when Captain Camilo Carrillo told the geographical society congress in [[Lima]] that Peruvian sailors named the warm north-flowing current "El Ni<U+00F1>o" because it was most noticeable around Christmas. The phenomenon had long been of interest because of its effects on the [[guano]] industry and other enterprises that depend on biological productivity of the sea.

[[Charles Todd (astronomer)|Charles Todd]], in 1893, suggested droughts in India and Australia tended to occur at the same time; [[Norman Lockyer]] noted the same in 1904. An El Ni<U+00F1>o connection with flooding was reported in 1895 by Pezet and Eguiguren. In 1924, [[Gilbert Walker]] (for whom the Walker circulation is named) coined the term "Southern Oscillation".

The major 1982<U+2013>83 El Ni<U+00F1>o led to an upsurge of interest from the scientific community. The period 1991<U+2013>1995 was unusual in that El Ni<U+00F1>os have rarely occurred in such rapid succession.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trenberth |first1=Kevin E. |author2=Hoar, Timothy J. |year=1996 |title=The 1990<U+2013>1995 El Ni<U+00F1>o<U+2013>Southern Oscillation Event: Longest on Record |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=57<U+2013>60 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1996/95GL03602.shtml |doi=10.1029/95GL03602 |bibcode=1996GeoRL..23...57T}}</ref> An especially intense El Ni<U+00F1>o event in 1998 caused an estimated 16% of the world's reef systems to die.

In 1997, the comedian [[Chris Farley]] performed his last skit for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which he personifies El Ni<U+00F1>o as a 'bombastic professional wrestler',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/449795metro04-08-06.htm |title=Scientist Forecasts 'super El Ni<U+00F1>o'  |work=Albuquerque Journal |author=John Fleck |date=April 8, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> saying "I am El Ni<U+00F1>o. El Ni<U+00F1>o is Spanish for<U+2026> the Ni<U+00F1>o".

== Climate networks ==
Analysis of El Ni<U+00F1>o events using climate networks shows the dynamics of the climate network is very sensitive to El Ni<U+00F1>o events.
