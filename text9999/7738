The '''Beagle B.121 Pup''' is a 1960s [[United Kingdom|British]] 2-4 seat single-engined training and touring aircraft built by [[Beagle Aircraft|Beagle Aircraft Limited]] at [[Shoreham Airport]] and [[Rearsby]] Aerodrome.

==History==
The Pup was designed as a single-engined all-metal two-seat aerobatic aircraft or a four-seat touring aircraft. The prototype Pup (a Series 1 G-AVDF) first flew from [[Shoreham Airport]] on 8 April 1967. The second (G-AVLM) and third (G-AVLN) aircraft were Series 2 aircraft fitted with an enlarged rudder which became standard on all production aircraft.
G-AVLM was converted during 1968 to become the series 3 prototype aircraft with a further enlarged rudder. 

Beagle Aircraft Ltd chose to build the Pup following a market survey which demonstrated a global requirement for a 2-4 seat training/touring aircraft to replace aging [[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moths]] and [[Piper Aircraft|Pipers]] used by flying clubs.<ref name="Design Journal 1968">Carr, Richard: ''Pup, up and away'', Article 11, pages 44-47.

The first delivery (a Series 1) was to the Shoreham Flying School on 12 April 1968. The aircraft was popular and sold to flying clubs and private users worldwide. A Series 3 variant, a four-seater, was developed for the Iranian Civil Air Training Organisation. By 1969 production had increased at Shoreham to one Pup a day, aircraft were flown to either [[Rearsby]] Aerodrome or [[Cambridge Airport]] for painting and finishing. One aircraft was evaluated by the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] in 1969, but was not ordered. Deliveries were made to civilian operators in several countries including Australia, Sweden and Switzerland. 

In December 1969 the government withdrew financial support for Beagle and the company was placed in receivership. Over 250 Pups were on order but production ceased with the 152nd aircraft. Some remaining nearly completed aircraft were finished at a variety of locations, the last being completed G-BCGV (s/n B121-176) was first registered 17 June 1974.

The Pup was more spacious than its direct competitors and was more of a "pilot's aeroplane"; it was a more complex design to manufacture and was also corrosion proofed throughout (usually then only an option on US-built competitors).  For these reasons it was correspondingly more expensive to build, yet was sold at a competitive price.  Its maintenance requires more care (i.e. expense) and its early days were troubled by issues with the doors and spares availability.  

A military version of the Pup was developed as the [[Scottish Aviation Bulldog|Beagle B.125 Bulldog]] with a {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} Lycoming engine. Only one prototype aircraft was built by Beagle (with another largely complete) before it ceased operations; the design and production was taken over by [[Scottish Aviation]].

==Variants==
* '''Pup Series 1''' (also known as the '''Pup 100''') powered by a {{convert|100|hp|abbr=on}} Rolls-Royce [[Continental O-200]]A engine
