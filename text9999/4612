'''William Ford Gibson''' (born March 17, 1948) is an [[United States|American]]-[[Canada|Canadian]] writer who has been called the "noir prophet" of the [[cyberpunk]] subgenre of [[science fiction]].<ref name="modern boys">{{cite news |first=William |last=Gibson |title=Modern boys and mobile girls |url= http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,466391,00.html |work=The Japan issue |publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' |date=2001-04-01 |accessdate=2007-10-28 }}</ref><ref name="smh"/> Gibson coined the term "[[cyberspace]]" in his short story "Burning Chrome" and later popularized the concept in his debut novel, ''[[Neuromancer]]'' ([[1984 in literature|1984]]). In envisaging cyberspace, Gibson created an iconography for the [[information age]] before the ubiquity of the [[Internet]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schactman |first=Noah | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |title=26 Years After Gibson, Pentagon Defines 'Cyberspace' |url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/05/pentagon-define.html |date=2008-05-23}}</ref> He is also credited with predicting the rise of [[reality television]] and with establishing the conceptual foundations for the rapid growth of virtual environments such as [[videogame]]s and the Web.

Having changed residence frequently with his family as a child, Gibson became a shy, ungainly teenager who often read science fiction. After spending his adolescence at a private boarding school in Arizona, Gibson [[draft dodger|dodged the draft]] during the [[Vietnam War]] by emigrating to Canada in 1968, where he became immersed in the [[counterculture]] and after settling in [[Vancouver]] eventually became a full-time writer. He retains dual citizenship.<ref name="seattle pi"/> Gibson's early works are bleak, [[noir]] near-future stories about the effect of [[cybernetics]] and [[computer network]]s on humans <U+2013> "lowlife meets high tech".<ref name="Leary">

</ref> The short stories were published in popular science fiction magazines. The themes, settings and characters developed in these stories culminated in his first novel, ''Neuromancer'', which garnered critical and commercial success, virtually initiating the [[cyberpunk]] literary genre.

Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained associated with ''Neuromancer'', his work has continued to evolve. After expanding on ''Neuromancer'' with two more novels to complete the dystopic [[Sprawl trilogy]], Gibson became an important author of another science fiction sub-genre<U+2014>[[steampunk]]<U+2014>with the 1990 [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', written with [[Bruce Sterling]]. In the 1990s he composed the [[Bridge trilogy]] of novels, which focused on sociological observations of near-future urban environments and late capitalism. His most recent novels<U+2014>''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'' (2003) and ''[[Spook Country]]'' (2007)<U+2014>are set in a contemporary world and have put his work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.

Gibson is one of the most well known North American science fiction writers,<ref name=litencyc /> f<U+00EA>ted by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1999 as "probably the most important novelist of the past two decades". Gibson has written more than twenty short stories and nine critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), and has contributed articles to several major publications and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers and musicians. His thought has been cited as an influence on science fiction authors, design, academia, [[cyberculture]], and technology.

Through Shirley, Gibson came into contact with science fiction authors [[Bruce Sterling]] and [[Lewis Shiner]]; reading Gibson's work, they realised that it was, as Sterling put it, "breakthrough material" and that they needed to "put down our preconceptions and pick up on this guy from Vancouver; this [was] the way forward."<ref name="shiner"/><ref name="nomaps"/> Gibson met Sterling at a science fiction convention in [[Denver, Colorado]] in the autumn of 1981, where he read "[[Hackers (short stories)#"Burning Chrome"|Burning Chrome]]"&nbsp;<U+2013> the first cyberspace short story&nbsp;<U+2013> to an audience of four people, and later stated that Sterling "completely got it".<ref name="nomaps"/>

==Literary career==
=== Early short fiction ===
{{details|Burning Chrome}}
Gibson's early writings are generally near-future stories about the influences of [[cybernetics]] and [[cyberspace]] (computer-simulated reality) technology on the human race. His themes of hi-tech [[shanty town]]s, recorded or broadcast stimulus (later to be developed into the "sim-stim" package featured so heavily in ''[[Neuromancer]]''), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are already evident in his first published short story, "[[Fragments of a Hologram Rose]]" (1977).<ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/> The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and fellow author, [[Bruce Sterling]], in the introduction of Gibson's short story collection ''[[Burning Chrome]]'', as "Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech."<ref>{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=William |coauthors=[[Bruce Sterling]] | chapter= Introduction | title=[[Burning Chrome]] |year=1986 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0060539828 |oclc = 51342671}}</ref>

In the early 1980s, Gibson's stories appeared in ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' and ''Universe 11'', wherein his fiction developed a [[film noir]], bleak feel. He consciously distanced himself as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt "an aesthetic revulsion", expressed in "[[The Gernsback Continuum]]"), to the extent that his highest goal was to become "a minor cult figure, a sort of lesser [[J. G. Ballard|Ballard]]."<ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/> When [[Bruce Sterling]] started to distribute the stories, he found that "people were just genuinely baffled... I mean they literally could not parse the guy's paragraphs... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just beyond peoples' grasp."<ref name="nomaps"/>

While [[Larry McCaffery]] has commented that these early short stories displayed flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic [[Darko Suvin]] has identified them as "undoubtedly [cyberpunk's] best works", constituting the "furthest horizon" of the genre.<ref name="storming"/> The themes which Gibson developed in the stories, [[the Sprawl]] setting of "[[Hackers (short stories)#"Burning Chrome"|Burning Chrome]]" and the character of [[Molly Millions]] from "[[Johnny Mnemonic]]" ultimately culminated in his first novel, ''[[Neuromancer]]''.<ref name="storming"/>

The Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with [[Bruce Sterling]]. Set in a technologically advanced [[Victorian era]] Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1991 and the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]] in 1992, and is often cited as a central novel of the [[steampunk]] genre.<ref name="steampunkt">{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Bebergal | title = The age of steampunk | url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/26/the_age_of_steampunk/ | publisher = [[The Boston Globe]] | page = 3

===Literary collaborations===
Three of the stories that later appeared in ''[[Burning Chrome]]'' were written in collaboration with other authors: "[[The Belonging Kind]]" (1981) with [[John Shirley]], "[[Red Star, Winter Orbit]]" (1983) with [[Bruce Sterling]],<ref name="looking glass">{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Garreau |title=Through the Looking Glass |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/05/AR2007090502582_pf.html |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=[[2007-09-06]] |accessdate=2007-10-30 }}</ref> and "[[Hackers (anthology)#"Dogfight"|Dogfight]]" (1985) with [[Michael Swanwick]].

===Film adaptations, screenplays, and appearances===
Gibson was first solicited to work as a [[screenwriter]] after a [[film producer]] discovered a waterlogged copy of ''Neuromancer'' on a beach at a [[Thailand|Thai]] resort.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details: For Men]] |url=http://www.textfiles.com/sf/cyberlit.txt |title=Cyber Lit |year=1992 |month=June |first=Gavin |last=Edwards |issue=134 |accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref> His early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as finished product; "Burning Chrome" (which was to be directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]]) and "Neuro-Hotel", for example, were two attempts by the author at film adaptations that were never made.<ref name="salza">{{cite interview |last=Gibson |first=William |interviewer=Giuseppe Salza |city=Cannes |year=1994 |month=May |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/235 |accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of ''[[Alien<U+00B3>]]'' (which he later characterized as "[[Andrei Tarkovsky|Tarkovskian]]"), few elements of which survived in the final version.<ref name="salza"/>
Gibson's early involvement with the film industry extended far beyond the confines of the [[Hollywood]] blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] director [[Rashid Nugmanov]] after an American [[film producer|producer]] had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Russian-Korean star [[Victor Tsoi]].<ref name="victor tsoi">{{cite web |url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_03_01_archive.asp#90416069

Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended after Tsoi's death in an automotive accident, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel ''[[Let's Put the Future Behind Us]]'' and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]''.<ref name="victor tsoi"/> A similarly doomed fate befell Gibson's mooted collaboration with Japanese filmmaker [[Sogo Ishii]] in 1991,<ref name="storming"/> a film they plotted on shooting in the [[Walled City of Kowloon]] until the city was demolished in 1993.<ref name="sogo">{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115354123358489417 |title=Burst City Trailer |first=William |last=Gibson |date=[[2006-07-21]] |accessdate=2007-11-26}}</ref>

===Exhibitions, poetry, and performance art===
[[Image:La Fura Dels Baus Dreams In Flight.jpg|thumb|upright|Gibson has often collaborated with [[performance art]]ists such as theatre group [[La Fura dels Baus]], here performing at the [[Singapore Arts Festival]] in May 2007.]]
Gibson has contributed text to be integrated into a number of [[performance art]] pieces. In October 1989, Gibson wrote text for such a collaboration with acclaimed sculptor and future ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' director [[Robert Longo]]<ref name="remembering">{{cite journal |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/gibson.html |title=Remembering Johnny |accessdate=2008-01-10 |last=van Bakel |first=Rogier |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |year=1995 |month=June | issue=3.06}}</ref> titled ''Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes'', which was displayed in Royce Hall, [[University of California Los Angeles]]. Three years later, Gibson contributed original text to "Memory Palace", a performance show featuring the theater group [[La Fura dels Baus]] at Art Futura '92, [[Barcelona]], which featured images by [[Karl Sims]], [[Rebecca Allen]], [[Mark Pellington]] with music by [[Peter Gabriel]] and others.<ref name="skier"/> It was at Art Futura '92 that Gibson met Charlie Athanas, who would later act as dramaturg and "cyberprops" designer on Steve Pickering and Charley Sherman's adaptation of "Burning Chrome" for the Chicago stage. Gibson's latest contribution was in 1997, a collaboration with critically acclaimed Vancouver-based [[contemporary dance]] company [[Holy Body Tattoo]] and Gibson's friend and future webmaster Christopher Halcrow.<ref name="holybody">{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_05_01_archive.asp#200367789 |title=Holy Body Tattoo |last=Gibson |first=William |date=[[2003-05-31]] |accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

In 1990, Gibson contributed to "Visionary San Francisco", an exhibition at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] shown from June 14 to August 26.<ref>{{cite book | last = Polledri | first = Paolo | title = Visionary San Francisco | publisher = Prestal | location = Munich | year = 1990 |oclc=22115872 | isbn = 3791310607 }}</ref> He wrote a short story, "[[Skinner's Room]]", set in a decaying [[San Francisco]] in which the [[San Francisco <U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge]] was closed and taken over by the [[homeless]] <U+2013> a setting Gibson then detailed in the [[Bridge trilogy]]. The story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, [[solar power|solar-powered]] towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge.<ref name="architecture"/> The architects exhibit featured Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from "Skinner's Room".<ref name=skier>{{cite web|url= http://www.skierpage.com/gibson/biblio.htm |title=William Gibson Bibliography / Mediagraphy |accessdate = 2008-02-09 |author = S.

A particularly well-received work by Gibson was ''[[Agrippa (a book of the dead)]]'' (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem that was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist [[Dennis Ashbaugh]] and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr.<ref>{{cite book

In his early short fiction, Gibson is credited by Rapatzikou in ''The Literary Encyclopedia'' with effectively "renovating" [[science fiction]], a genre at that time considered widely "insignificant",<ref name="litencyc"/> influencing by means of the postmodern [[aesthetic]] of his writing the development of new perspectives in [[science fiction studies]].<ref name="hollinger">{{cite journal |last=Hollinger |first=Veronica |year=1999 |month=July |title=Contemporary Trends in Science Fiction Criticism, 1980<U+2013>1999 |journal=Science Fiction Studies |volume=26 |issue=78 |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/78/hollinger78art.htm |accessdate= 2007-11-06 }}</ref> In the words of filmmaker Marianne Trench, Gibson's visions "struck sparks in the real world" and "determined the way people thought and talked" to an extent unprecedented in science fiction literature.<ref name="mystic">Trench, Marianne and Peter von Brandenburg, producers. 1992.
