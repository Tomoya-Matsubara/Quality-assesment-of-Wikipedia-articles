"'''Queer'''" is a song written and produced by [[alternative rock]] band [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] for the band's [[Garbage (album)|self-titled debut album]]. The song started as a [[Demo (music)|demo]] during sessions between band members [[Butch Vig]], [[Duke Erikson]] and [[Steve Marker]], and had its composition finished after singer [[Shirley Manson]] joined the band. Manson rewrote the sexualized lyrics to be more ambiguous, and rearranged the song into a subdued [[trip-hop]] and [[rock music|rock]] [[Crossover (music)#Crossover as a mix of genres|crossover]] structure.

In 1995, "Queer" was issued as the band's fourth [[single (music)|single]] in the United Kingdom and second internationally. The song quickly became a modern rock success for the fledgling band, with positive reviews from music journalists, and becoming their first top 20 hit in both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. It also earned attention with its music video by [[St<U+00E9>phane Sednaoui]], which featured Manson detaining, stripping and shaving a man from a [[first-person perspective]]. The video earned much airplay on [[MTV]] and was nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award <U+2013> Breakthrough Video|Breakthrough Video]] at the [[1996 MTV Video Music Awards]].

==Composition==
"Queer" began as a rough [[Demo (music)|demo]] around January 1994, recorded during informal studio sessions between [[Butch Vig]], [[Duke Erikson]] and [[Steve Marker]] in Marker's home basement [[recording studio]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Malins|first=Steve|title=What's Our Problem?|work=Q|location=Detroit, Michigan|pages=50<U+2013>53|date=1996-09-01}}</ref> The band had been [[jam session|jamming]] using an [[ADAT]] [[Multitrack recording|eight-track]], [[AKAI]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], and a small [[drum kit]].<ref name="BVGearslutz">{{cite web|url=http://www.gearslutz.com/board/q-butch-vig/398209-garbage.html|title=Garbage (Butch Vig Q&A)|publisher=GearSlutz|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> The band had written around five songs that they felt were pretentious and lyrically simple and literal. They did not want Erikson to sing, even though he was a competent singer, because they wanted to avoid sounding like their previous band [[Spooner (band)|Spooner]]. Vig and Marker were uncomfortable with their vocals so tended to bury them deep in the mix or distort them with effects; on "Queer", Vig recorded a "scratch vocal" consisting of him screaming his way through. The recorded work was later discarded, which Vig explained was because the trio discovered that the musical experiments they were attempting "[don't] work when you're trying to write a song and put it in a context that works".<ref name=Rise>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|title=Garbage Rise From The House That Grunge Built|url=http://www.garbage.net/garbage/articles/@rise.htm|publisher=[[Addicted to Noise]]|accessdate=2011-07-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/200012081244/http://www.garbage.net/articles/@rise.htm|archivedate=2000-12-08|year=1995}}</ref> Vig's inspiration for "Queer" came from a novel he had read about "about this woman who was hired to go and make this guy's son a 'man'.

After Marker saw [[Shirley Manson]]'s group [[Angelfish (band)|Angelfish]] on ''[[120 Minutes]]'', the band invited her to Vig and Marker's [[Smart Studios]] to sing on a couple of songs. One of the compositions was "Queer", whose incomplete lyrics forced Manson to [[ad-lib]] in an audition that was described as "dreadful". The singer afterwards returned to Angelfish, which folded shortly later.<ref name="behindthemusic">"''Garbage: [[Behind The Music]]'', [[VH1]], aired March 31, 2002"</ref><ref name=Serendipitous>{{cite journal|last=Borzillo|first=Carrie|title=Garbage's Serendipitous Success; Popularity Falls into Place for Almo Act|date=1996-03-23|journal=Billboard|location=Los Angeles|pages=9, 97|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iQ8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA97&dq=Garbage%20Only%20Happy%20When%20it%20Rains&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second audition, and then begun working on the songs Vig, Marker and Erikson had created.

She also re-sung the "Queer" vocal in an understated style.<ref name=Rise/> It was then that the band knew that Garbage was going to work.<ref name=Scene/> 

Garbage incorporated a [[sample (music)|sample]] of the [[drumline]] from [[New Zealand]] band [[Single Gun Theory]]'s track "Man of Straw" on "Queer";<ref>{{cite web|title=AOL Garbage Interview|url=http://www.garbage.net/garbage/articles/@aol.htm|publisher=AOL Online|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090413123322/http://www.garbage.net/garbage/articles/@aol.htm|archivedate=2009-04-13|date=1995-08-20|quote=QUEER is several different loops- There is loop from the Single Gun Theory, Clyde Stubblefield - a a great drummer who played with James Brown and lives in Madison,}}</ref> this [[loop (music)|loop]] was [[multitrack recording|layered]] with an additional drum part performed by Madison [[percussionist]] [[Clyde Stubblefield]], who was known for being the most sampled drummer in history for his uncredited part on [[James Brown]]'s "[[Funky Drummer]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Aaron|first=Charles|title=Disco-techs and the Sex-O-Lette|publisher=[[Spin (magazine){{!}}Spin]]|location=USA|pages=56<U+2013>58, 60, 62, 64, 128<U+2013>129|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=774lMJwGjVcC&lpg=PA27&dq=garbage%20disco%20techs&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=1997-06-01}}</ref> Vig opted to hire Stubblefield to play on the record rather than sample him as "you don't use a sample when the genius who played the sample lives down the street from you", and the drummer also contribted to album cut "Not My Idea".<ref>{{cite web|title=THE COALITION FOR CLYDE STUBBLEFIELD|url=http://clydestubblefield.chipin.com/clyde-stubblefield|publisher=Chip In|accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> [[Bass guitar]] parts were completed by [[Milwaukee]] session bassist Mike Kashou.<ref name=liner/> The band wanted to sample a [[clarinet]] part from a [[Frank Sinatra]] record, but the licensing for the sample would have been prohibitively expensive.

Manson later explained, "It's not, as you might think, to do with being [[gay]], but tolerance. My granny has the expression 'Or's queer, except thee and me, and sometimes even thee's queer', that is that you think you are normal and the rest of the world is freaky, but we're all equally to blame".<ref>{{cite book|last=Aston|first=Martin|title=Scary!

There's been enough exposure to [[Gay_community#Human_and_legal_rights|gay issues]] in the [[mainstream media]] that people are finally ready to deal with it.

Initially, [[Mushroom Records]] had scheduled "Queer" to be the [[lead single]] for the UK release of  the debut album ''Garbage'', matching the international single release strategy.

===Collector's format===
As the band had received significant attention from the special packaging of their first three releases, "Queer" was also released in this manner.<ref name="recordcollector"/> Mushroom's [[product manager]] had a longer time to design the package than the other singles; this was a result of "Queer" being held back three months so that "Only Happy When It Rains" could launch the album.<ref name=HBM/> Garbage's original suggestion for "Queer" was to create a jade [[velvet]] box, but Mushroom vetoed the idea over the cost.<ref name=HBM>{{cite book|title=Gar-barge Press Conference|publisher=Here Be Monsters|location=London, UK|date=1995-07-25|quote=As told by Butch Vig}}</ref> The label sourced a plastics company to create the case, which was made from [[Injection molding|injection-molded]] [[polystyrene]], similar to the process of manufacturing [[CD and DVD packaging#Jewel case|jewel cases]]. The company charged Mushroom <U+00A3>10,000 to have the mould created. The end product was finished with [[Frosting (decorative arts)|frosted effect]] for the "G" logo, which was stickered, and within placed the vinyl record in a card picture sleeve; this cost Mushroom <U+00A3>2.21 per unit (a loss of 95p for each sale). This special single had only 5,000 copies issued.<ref name="recordcollector"/>

==Critical reception==
Upon both the release of ''Garbage'' and the release of "Queer" as a single, the song received a positive reception from [[music journalists]]. Leo Finlay, in a ''[[Music Week]]'' article highlighting the campaign for the debut album's release wrote, "'Queer' is eerily reminiscent of [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]'s stranger moments".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finlay|first=Leo|title=Talent; Garbage|journal=[[Music Week]]|date=1995-09-30}}</ref> A reviewer for ''[[NME]]'' wrote that the single was "an ode to recognising and tolerating those mis-shapen ones among us",<ref>{{cite news|title=Single Reviews; Queer|newspaper=[[New Musical Express]]|location=UK|date=1995-11-11}}</ref> and when reviewing the album, their own Shannon O'Connell wrote, "there is a bit of [[Pat Benatar]] in [this songs] back-alley swagger".<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=Shannon|title=What A Waste!|journal=[[New Musical Express]]|location=UK|date=1995-09-30}}</ref> A reviewer for ''[[Vox (magazine)|VOX]]'' described "Queer" as "[[Voice of the Beehive]] roughing up [[L7 (band)|L7]]",<ref>{{cite journal|title=Album Reviews; Garbage|journal=[[Vox (magazine)|VOX]]|location=UK|date=1995-10-01}}</ref> Jackie Hinden of ''[[Hot Press]]'' wrote that the song was "a slinky [[work-out]] against a restrained [[work-to-rule]] [[Industrial music|industrial]] backing",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Binden|first=Jackie|title=Dump It Up|journal=[[Hot Press]]|location=Ireland|date=1995-09-27}}</ref> and the publication later made it their Single of the Fortnight, describing it as "Almost indecently brilliant.

''[[Kerrang!]]'' rated "Queer" as their Single of the Week, stating "an incredible knee-trembling fuck tune... the dirtiest pop tune you'll hear all year.

==Track listings and formats==
"Queer" was the first Garbage single to include [[remix]]es as a commercial b-side; Mushroom spread four across the UK formats.

==Music video==
[[File:Garbage-Queervideo.JPG|thumb|left|Garbage attacking the detained protagonist of the "Queer" video.]]

The [[music video]] for "Queer" directed by [[St<U+00E9>phane Sednaoui]] for [[Propaganda Films]] and was filmed in July 1995 in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=queervideo/> Sedanoui's video concept developed from his own personal experience of being "shredded into pieces" by a beautiful woman. Garbage loved his [[storyboard]] for "Queer", feeling it matched the ambiguous nature of the song.<ref name="Sednaoui"/> Manson had chosen Sednaoui as director after she saw the "[[Big Time Sensuality]]" music video he directed for [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]], and later said that Sednaoui "doesn't just take an idea an apply it to different artists, he seems to be able to figure out where the artist is coming from and make the photographs and the videos unique to that group."<ref name="Sednaoui">{{cite video|title=Stephane Sednaoui & Shirley Manson: Filming 'Queer' | people =[[St<U+00E9>phane Sednaoui]] & [[Shirley Manson]]|date = 2005|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGj6lSfk6Qw|location= ''[[Director's Label]]: The Work of Director St<U+00E9>phane Sednaoui'' | accessdate = 2006-09-23|medium = DVD| publisher = PALM Pictures}}</ref>

The black and white storyline of the video saw a young male's [[First-person narrative|first person perspective]] of exiting an elevator onto a Los Angeles street and meeting Manson. She coyly entices him to follow her to her home where the men from Garbage are waiting. They detain him inside, forcing him up onto the second-level of the house, where Manson throws him to the floor, strips him of his clothing and blinds him with [[gaffer tape]]. He recovers to find Manson shaving his head, before she drags him outside by his legs. He is then seen strangely happy, and in full colour, leaving the street.<ref name=queervideo>{{cite journal|last=Atwood|first=Brett|title=Bowie Gets Graphic, Garbage Clips 'Queer'; Garbage in, Garbage out|date=1995-09-16|journal=Billboard|location=Los Angeles|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6Q0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=RA1-PA82&dq=Garbage%20Queer&pg=RA1-PA82#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> 

[[File:Queermakingof.png|thumb|right|Director [[St<U+00E9>phane Sednaoui]] shot the whole video himself with a [[hand-held camera]]. Here singer [[Shirley Manson]] spins him.]]

Sednaoui operated the camera for the whole shoot.<ref name="Sednaoui"/> To capture the victim's struggle, Sednaoui positioned the camera at ground-level facing upwards towards Garbage, who were standing on a rotating platform. To suggest the victim was almost hallucinating, [[strobe lighting]] was combined with the rotation of the platform, however the effect caused the band to suffer from [[vertigo]] after a number of takes.<ref name=queervideo/> Manson later claimed that the video helped establish her group; "He really defined for us who we were visually. St<U+00E9>phane was able to look at the band and listen to the music and figure out what was the perfect visual partner for the band. People think we're a very stylish band, and it's all to do with him". She added, "I'm really proud of "Queer", I think it's one of our best videos."<ref name="Sednaoui"/>

The "Queer" video premiered on North American networks on August 14, 1995;<ref>{{cite web|title=Queer / Stephane Sednaoui|url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=6&ti=1,6&Search_Arg=Garbage%20Queer&Search_Code=FT*&CNT=100&PID=712KLENMU8ga4Oo5WObkqsf7m0f&SEQ=20110727114244&SID=2|publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]]|accessdate=2011-07-27|date=1995-08-14|quote=PA0000704796; Queer / Stephane Sednaoui; Videocassette; 3/4 in; Music video performed by Garbage; Almo Sounds}}</ref> where it was given heavy support by MTV, who certified it a [[Buzz Bin|Buzz Clip]].<ref name=Serendipitous/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Aston|first=Martin|title=New to Q; Garbage|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|location=UK|pages=23|date=October 1995}}</ref> MTV requested an edit to [[fade (filmmaking)|obscure the shot]] of Manson blinding the video's protagonist before playlisting it.<ref name=queervideo/> The music video for "Queer" was nominated in the [[MTV Video Music Award <U+2013> Breakthrough Video|Breakthrough Video]] category at the [[1996 MTV Video Music Awards]],<ref name="MTVVMAs">{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wgcEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA79&dq=Garbage%20Queer&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q=Garbage%20Queer&f=false |title=Pumpkins Lead Video Music Award Noms |journal=Billboard magazine|date=1996-08-12|first=Brett|last=Atwood|pages=76|accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref> losing to [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' "[[Tonight, Tonight (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Tonight, Tonight]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=MTV Video Music Awards {{!}} 1996|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1996/|publisher=Viacom, MTV|accessdate=2011-07-27|quote=Among the awards they nabbed were Breakthrough Video and Video of the Year for "Tonight, Tonight,"}}</ref> The silver dress Manson wore in the video was later donated to the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel & Casino]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] for indefinite display.<ref name="fastfacts">{{cite web | url=http://www.garbage.com/press/articles/fastfacts.html | title=Garbage Fast Facts | publisher=Garbage.com | accessdate=2007-05-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20001007074107/http://www.garbage.com/press/articles/fastfacts.html |archivedate = 2000-10-07 |quote=On October 6, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV received a donated piece of Garbage memorabilia.
