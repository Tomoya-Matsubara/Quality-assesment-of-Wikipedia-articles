'''''Piperia yadonii''''', also known as '''Yadon's Piperia''' or '''Yadon's rein orchid''',  is an endangered [[orchid]] [[endemic]] to a narrow range of [[coast]]al [[habitat]] in northern [[Monterey County, California]].  In 1998 this plant was designated as an [[endangered species]] by the [[United States]] government, the major threat to its survival being continuing land development from an [[overpopulation|expanding human population]] and associated habitat loss.<ref>[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], ''Endangered and threatened wildlife and plants: Final rule listing five plants from Monterey County, California as endangered or threatened''. [[Federal Register]] 63: 43100<U+2013>43116 (1998)</ref> One of the habitats of Yadon<U+2019>s Piperia, the [[Del Monte Forest]] near [[Monterey, California]], is the subject of a federal lawsuit, based upon endangerment of this organism along with several other endangered species.  

This [[wildflower]] may lie dormant in a given year and not emerge above the soil surface from its tuberous substructure.  After leafing out in the spring, it will produce flowers on erect spikes, each flower possessing both green and white petals.  It prefers sandy soils, and subsists on [[nutrient]] extraction from intermediate [[fungus|fungal]] [[organism]]s.

==Description==

Along with most other orchids ''P. yadonii'': (a) is a [[bisexual]] [[perennial]] nongreen plant that grows from buried [[tuber]]s;   manifests a fruit capsule bearing numerous minute seeds; (b) exhibits [[pollen]] that is sticky, and which is removed as [[sessile]] [[anther]] [[sac]]s; and (c) has a [[stigma]] fused with its [[style]] into a column. 

There are a total of eight species in the genus ''Piperia'', which is named for American [[botanist]] [[Charles V. Piper]]. The genus members manifest generally cylindrical spikes or [[raceme]]s.  As with other ''Piperia'', Yadon's Piperia exhibits a single veined flower one to two millimeters in width and a [[basal]] [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] leaf formation.  

The subsurface architecture of this terrestrial wild orchid consists of a [[rhizome]] structure, from which emanate [[tuber]]s.  The rhizome extracts nutrients from fungal intermediates and may also store some of these nutrients.  A basal rosette of leaves develops from the tuber at the surface of the soil, each of the two or three leaves being [[lanceolate]] in shape.<ref name="Morgan">Morgan & Ackerman, Lindleyana 5:205<U+2013>211 (1990)</ref> Each leaf ranges from 10&nbsp;to 15&nbsp;centimeters in length and 20&nbsp;to35&nbsp;millimeters in width.  Leaves of younger plants are often more diminutive in size. 

The dense [[inflorescence]] is borne on a single erect vertical spike varying from 12&nbsp;to 55&nbsp;centimeters in height.<ref>''The Jepson manual: higher plants of California'', Hickman, JC, ed., University of California Press,  Berkeley, Ca. (1993)</ref>  Each flower has a spur of length 1.5&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;millimeters, short compared to other members of the genus.  Yadon<U+2019>s Piperia typically presents three upper [[tepal]]s, each of which contains both green and white pigmentation; moreover, there are three lower tepals that are white only.  The earliest blooming time is June.  When ''P. yadonii'' blooms, as late as August, all of its sepals and petals may be purely white.

Another key identification feature is the characteristically abbreviated  [[spur (botany)|spur]], which typically measures 1.5&nbsp;to 6.0&nbsp;millimeters in length. ''P. yadonii''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s  leaves usually wither by blooming time, except for a small percentage of very large individuals. The geographic range of ''P. yadonii'' overlaps that of ''P. elegans'', ''P. elongata'', ''P. michaelii'', and ''P. transversa''; consequently, ''P. yadonii'' is clearly distinguished from them only in the flowering stage. [[Sympatric]] occurrences in mixed populations with ''P. elongata'' and ''P. elegans'' are noted in the literature.

==Reproduction and symbiosis==

[[Reproduction]] is carried out by [[insect]] [[pollination]], leading to a [[seed]] devoid of any [[nutrient]] sac.<ref>T.C. Wells, ''Population ecology of terrestrial [[orchid]]s: The biological aspects of rare plant conservation'', H. Synge, John Wiley & Sons. Ltd: 281<U+2013>295 (1981)</ref>   These extremely small capsule-like seeds must come in contact with appropriate soil [[fungus|fungi]] in order to [[germination|germinate]].  Such a [[symbiosis|symbiotic association]] actually occurs when an appropriate  fungus attacks the seed or its resulting seedling by attaching the extremely slender [[hyphae]] into the plant or seed tissue.<ref>''Plant Surface [[Microbiology]]'', edited by Ajit Varma, Lynette Abbott, Dietrich Werner, Rudiger Hampp, Springer Verlag, Berlin, (2004) ISBN 3-540-00923-X</ref> ''P. yadonii'' then extracts nutrients through the hyphae, while the fungus receives a flux of [[Carbon fixation|carbon fixed]] compounds (sugars, [[lipid]]s, starches) in return.  This type of symbiosis is termed a [[mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal association]].   Rhizomal propagation also occurs.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Del monte forest.jpg|thumb|260px|Del Monte Forest, [[Monterey Peninsula]], showing encroachment of [[golf course]] development toward habitat of ''Piperia yadonii''.]]
Yadon<U+2019>s piperia is confined to a handful of locations in the coastal area of north [[Monterey County]] including the [[Del Monte Forest]] on the [[Monterey Peninsula]]; the [[Prunedale]] Hills; and an isolated southernmost population on [[Rocky Creek]] Ridge (Cushing Mountain) at [[Big Sur]].  Specific places of occurrence within those areas are the S.F.B. Morse Botanical Reserve; Manzanita County Park; and the [[Nature Conservancy]]<U+2019>s Blohm Ranch Nature Preserve.  Each colony is rather small in patch size, measured on the order of tens of acres or less.  All of the occurrences are below 150&nbsp;meters above mean sea level and all are within six miles of the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Yadon<U+2019>s Piperia prefers sandy soils or even sandstone outcrops.  These geological structures are typically on ancient marine terraces<ref>''Jepson Manual'', Regents of the University of California, University of California Press (1993)</ref> and underlain by [[clay]] [[hardpan]].  This wild orchid is typically found above [[bedrock]] of decomposed [[granite]] in soils that are [[acid]]ic and highly leached.  The organism<U+2019>s geographic distribution is along the coastal region of [[Monterey County, California]], although it does not occur above 150&nbsp;meters in elevation.  ''Piperia yadonii'' is normally found within about six miles from the [[Pacific Ocean]], in a climate that is marine driven.

Yadon<U+2019>s Piperia is generally restricted to three habitats: (a) California [[Northern coastal scrub]], with dwarfed Hooker<U+2019>s [[manzanita]] (''[[Arctostaphylos]] hookeri ssp. hookeri'') or [[Alice Eastwood|Eastwood<U+2019>s]] manzanita (''Arctostaphylos glandulosa''); (b) [[Monterey pine]] (''Pinus radiata'') [[forest]], often with Gowen<U+2019>s cypress (''[[Cupressus goveniana]] ssp. goveniana''); and (c) [[Monterey cypress]] (''[[Cupressus macrocarpa]]'') forest. The colonies in woodland settings are found under partial canopy in an open, primarily [[herbaceous]] [[understory]] shape.

The Monterey Peninsula and northern Big Sur areas are influenced by a [[marine (ocean)|marine]] climate that is pronounced due to the [[upwelling]] of cool water from the [[Monterey Canyon|Monterey submarine canyon]]. Rainfall is 40&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;centimeters per year, but summer fog-drip is a primary source of moisture for Yadon<U+2019>s Piperia and other plants that would otherwise not be able to persist with such low [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].

==History and conservation==

''Piperia yadonii'' was named for Vern Yadon, former longtime director of the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History.  The [[Monterey Peninsula]], where all colonies of Yadon<U+2019>s Piperia occur, is recognized to have a high degree of species [[endemic (ecology)|endemicism]].  Species with more northern ranges often reach their southern limits on the Peninsula; species with more southern affinities reach their northern limits there as well.  On the Monterey Peninsula some taxa comprising habitat for ''P. yadonii'', such as the coastal closed-[[conifer cone|cone]] [[pine]]s and [[Cupressus|cypress]]es are [[relict]] stands, e.g. species that once extended more widely in the [[mesic]] climate of the late [[Pleistocene]] period, but then retreated to small pockets of cooler and wetter conditions along the coast ranges during the hotter, drier early [[Holocene]] period between 6000&nbsp;and 2000&nbsp;BC.<ref>C.I. Millar, ''Reconsidering the Conservation of Monterey Pine''. Fremontia 26(3):12<U+2013>16 (1998)</ref>

Yadon<U+2019>s Piperia, along with certain other threatened species in the northern [[California Floristic Province]], has been designated as a species meriting protection by the U.S. Government, State of California, local governments and private conservation groups.  These designations have led to blueprints for protection of Yadon's piperia in the form of official endangerment classifications and a species [[Recovery Plan]],<ref>''Notice of Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for Five Plants From Monterey County, CA'', Federal Register: May 13, 2002, Volume 67, Number 92, Pages 32003<U+2013>32004</ref> the latter promulgated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].  Even with all these efforts, the total current population is not necessarily above the [[Minimum Viable Population|minimum viable population]] without further elements of protection.  

The listing as a federally endangered species occurred in 1998, prompted<ref>U.S. [[Federal Register]]: August 2, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 148, Pages 39326<U+2013>39337)</ref> by a study conducted by Earth Metrics for the [[Monterey, California|city of Monterey]], which found the colony in the Del Monte forest to be threatened by proposed land development.<ref>C.M. Hogan, G. Deghi, M. Papineau et. al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Pebble Beach Properties project by Del Monte Forest'', Earth Metrics Inc. Prepared for the city of Monterey and State of California Clearinghouse (1992)</ref>  Subsequently in 1995 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) acted on this new information regarding Yadon<U+2019>s piperia, and promulgated a [[public notice|notice of intent]] to classify the species as endangered.

Monitoring [[population]]s of Yadon's Piperia is challenging since each [[tuber]] does not produce emergent leaves or flowers in a given year.  To complicate matters further, the plant can only be identified conclusively in its flowering stage, and yet, even when the plant leafs out, it may not necessarily produce a flower in a given year.  Furthermore, by the time a flower is produced, the leaves have typically [[Plant senescence|senesced]]; thus, a survey conducted during the flowering season will miss plants that have leafed out but not flowered.
