A '''quantum computer''' is any device for [[computation]] that makes direct use of distinctively [[quantum mechanical]] phenomena, such as [[quantum superposition|superposition]] and [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], to perform operations on data. In a classical (or conventional) computer, the amount of [[data]] is measured by bits; in a quantum computer, it is measured by [[qubit]]s. The basic principle of quantum computation is that the quantum properties of particles can be used to represent and structure data, and that quantum mechanisms can be devised and built to perform [[Instruction (computer science)|operation]]s with these data.<ref>"[http://www.media.mit.edu/physics/publications/papers/98.06.sciam/0698gershenfeld.html Quantum Computing with Molecules]" article in [[Scientific American]] by [[Neil Gershenfeld]] and [[Isaac L. Chuang]] - a generally accessible overview of quantum computing.</ref>

Though quantum computing is still in its infancy, experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on a very small number of qubits. Research in both theoretical and practical areas continues at a frantic pace, and many national government and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes, such as [[cryptanalysis]]. <ref>[http://qist.lanl.gov/qcomp_map.shtml Quantum Information Science and Technology Roadmap] for a sense of where the research is heading.</ref>
(See [[Timeline of quantum computing]] for details on current and past progress.)

It is widely believed that if large-scale quantum computers can be built, they will be able to solve certain problems faster than any classical computer. Quantum computers are different from classical [[computers]] such as [[DNA computer]]s and computers based on [[transistor]]s, even though these may ultimately use some kind of quantum mechanical effect (for example [[covalent bond]]s). Some computing architectures such as [[optical computer]]s may use classical superposition of electromagnetic waves, but without some specifically quantum mechanical resource such as [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], they do not share the potential for computational speed-up of quantum computers.

==The basis of quantum computing==
{{unsolved|physics|Is it possible to construct a practical computer that performs [[calculation]]s on [[qubit]]s (quantum bits)?}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], the state of a physical system (such as an [[electron]] or a [[photon]]) is described by a vector in a mathematical object called a [[Hilbert space]]. The realization of the Hilbert space depends on the particular system. For instance, in the case of a single particle system in three dimensions, the state can be described by a complex-valued function defined on '''R'''<sup>3</sup> (three-[[dimension|dimensional]] space) called a [[Wavefunction|wave function]]. As described in the article on [[quantum mechanics]], this function has a probabilistic interpretation; of particular significance is that [[quantum state]]s can be in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the [[Orthonormal basis|basis states]]. The [[time evolution]] of the system state vector is assumed to be [[unitary operator|unitary]], meaning that it is reversible (it costs no energy). Note that this is true only if the system is isolated and the phenomenon of [[decoherence]] does not occur.

A classical computer has a memory made up of [[bit]]s, where each bit holds either a one or a zero. The device computes by manipulating those bits, i.e. by transporting these bits from memory to (possibly a suite of) [[logic gate]]s and back. A quantum computer maintains a set of [[qubit]]s. A qubit can hold a one, or a zero, or a superposition of these. A quantum computer operates by manipulating those qubits, i.e. by transporting these bits from memory to (possibly a suite of) [[quantum gate|quantum logic gate]]s and back.

Qubits for a quantum computer can be implemented using particles with two [[spin (physics)|spin]] states: "up" and "down" (typically written <math>|0\rangle</math> and <math>|1\rangle</math>) in fact, any system possessing an [[observable]] quantity ''A'' which is ''conserved'' under time evolution and such that ''A'' has at least two discrete and sufficiently spaced consecutive [[eigenvalue]]s, is a suitable candidate for implementing a qubit, since any such system can be mapped onto an effective [[spin-1/2]].

For discussion of foundational aspects of quantum computing, see the article on [[quantum circuit]]s.

==Bits vs qubits ==
Consider first a classical computer that operates on a 3 bit [[Processor register|register]]. At any given time, the bits in the register are in a definite state, such as 101.  In a quantum computer, however, the qubits can be in a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of all the classically allowed states.  In fact, the register is described by a [[wavefunction]]:
:<math>|\psi \rangle = a|000\rangle + b|001\rangle + c|010\rangle + \ldots</math>
where the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'',... are [[complex number]]s whose amplitudes squared are the probabilities to measure the qubits in each state.  Consequently, <math>|c|^2</math> is the probability to measure the register in the state 010.  That these numbers are complex is important because the [[Phase (waves)|phases]] of the numbers can constructively and destructively interfere with one another, an important feature for quantum algorithms.[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/270/5234/255]

For an ''n'' qubit [[quantum register]], recording the state of the register requires 2<sup>''n''</sup> complex numbers (the 3-qubit register requires 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 numbers). Consequently, the number of classical states encoded in a quantum register grows exponentially with the number of qubits.  For ''n''=300, this is roughly 10<sup>90</sup>, more states than there are atoms in the [[known universe]].  Note that the coefficients are not all independent, since the probabilities must sum to 1.  The representation is also non-unique, since there is no way to physically distinguish between a particular quantum register and a similar one where all of the amplitudes have been multiplied by the same [[Phase (waves)|phase]] such as &minus;1, ''i'', or in general any number on the complex [[unit circle]].
One can show the [[dimension]] of the set of states of an ''n'' qubit register is 2<sup>''n''+1</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2. See [[Bloch sphere]].

== Initialization, execution and termination ==
In our example, the contents of the qubit registers can be thought of as an 8-dimensional complex [[coordinate vector|vector]]. An algorithm for a quantum computer must initialize this vector in some specified form (dependent on the design of the quantum computer). In each step of the algorithm, that vector is modified by multiplying it by a [[unitary operator|unitary]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The matrix is determined by the physics of the device. The unitary character of the matrix ensures the matrix is invertible (so each step is reversible).

Upon termination of the algorithm, the 8-dimensional complex vector stored in the register must be somehow read off from the qubit register by a quantum [[measurement]]. However, by the laws of quantum mechanics, that measurement will yield a [[random]] 3 bit string (and it will destroy the stored state as well). This random string can be used in computing the value of a function because (by design) the [[probability distribution]] of the measured output bitstring is skewed in favor of the correct value of the function. By repeated runs of the quantum computer and measurement of the output, the correct value can be determined, to a high probability, by majority polling of the outputs. See [[quantum circuit]] for a more precise formulation. In brief, quantum computations are probabilistic.

A quantum algorithm is implemented by an appropriate sequence of unitary operations. Note that for a given algorithm, the operations will always be done in exactly the same order. There is no "IF THEN" statement to vary the order, since there is no way to read the state of a qubit before the final measurement.  There are, however, conditional gate operations such as the controlled NOT gate, or CNOT.

For more details on the sequences of operations used for various algorithms, see [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]]. Also refer to the growing field of [[quantum programming]].

==The power of quantum computers==
[[Integer factorization]] is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large numbers that are the product of two [[prime number]]s of roughly equal size (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes). By comparison, a quantum computer could solve this problem relatively easily. If a number has ''n'' bits (is ''n'' digits long when written in the [[binary numeral system]]), then a quantum computer with just over 2''n'' qubits can use [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. It can also solve a related problem called the [[discrete logarithm]] problem. This ability would allow a quantum computer to "break" many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a relatively fast ([[polynomial time]] in ''n'') algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] could be much more quickly broken, including forms of [[RSA]], [[ElGamal encryption|ElGamal]] and [[Diffie-Hellman]]. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security. The only way to increase the security of an algorithm like [[RSA]] would be to increase the key size and hope that an adversary does not have the resources to build and use a powerful enough quantum computer. It seems plausible that it will always be possible to build classical computers that have more bits than the number of qubits in the largest quantum computer. If that's true, then algorithms like [[RSA]] could be made secure by ensuring that keylengths exceed the storage capacities of quantum computers.

There is one [[digital signature]] scheme that is secure against quantum computers: [[Lamport signature scheme|Lamport signatures]].

Perhaps not as surprisingly, quantum computers could also be useful for running simulations of quantum mechanics. This idea goes back to [[Richard Feynman]] (1982) who observed that there is no known algorithm for simulating quantum systems on a classical computer and suggested to study the use of quantum computer for this purpose. The speedup achieved by quantum computers could be just as large as for factoring. This could be a great boon to [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[nanotechnology]], [[biology]] and [[medicine]], all of which are limited today by the slow speed of quantum mechanical simulations.  

This dramatic advantage of quantum computers is currently known to exist for only those three problems: factoring, discrete logarithm, and quantum physics simulations. However, there is no proof that the advantage is real: an equally fast classical algorithm may still be discovered (though some consider this unlikely). There is one other problem where quantum computers have a smaller, though significant (quadratic) advantage. It is ''quantum database search'', and can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]]. In this case the advantage is provable. This establishes beyond doubt that (ideal) quantum computers are superior to classical computers.

Consider a problem that has these four properties:
# The only way to solve it is to guess answers repeatedly and check them,
# There are ''n'' possible answers to check,
# Every possible answer takes the same amount of time to check, and
# There are no clues about which answers might be better: generating possibilities randomly is just as good as checking them in some special order.
An example of this is a [[password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password for an [[encrypted]] file (assuming that the password has a maximum possible length).

For problems with all four properties, it will take an average of (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2 guesses to find the answer using a classical computer. The time for a quantum computer to solve this will be proportional to the square root of ''n''. That can be a very large speedup, reducing some problems from years to seconds. It can be used to attack [[symmetric cipher]]s such as [[Triple DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] by attempting to guess the secret key. But it is also easy to defend against, by doubling the size of this key. There are also more complicated methods for secure communication, such as using [[quantum cryptography]].

Regardless of whether any of these problems can be shown to have an advantage on a quantum computer, they nonetheless will always have the advantage of being an excellent tool for studying quantum mechanical interactions, which of itself is an enormous value to the scientific community.

There are currently no other practical problems known where quantum computers give a large speedup over classical computers. Research is continuing, and more problems may yet be found.

==Problems and practicality issues==
There are a number of practical difficulties in building a quantum computer, and thus far quantum computers have only solved trivial problems. David DiVincenzo, of IBM, listed the following requirements for a practical quantum computer:[http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002077]
* scalable physically to increase the number of qubits
* qubits can be initialized to arbitrary values
* quantum gates faster than decoherence time
* [[Turing-complete]] gate set
* qubits can be read easily

To summarize the problem from the perspective of an engineer, one needs to solve the challenge of building a system which is isolated from everything ''except'' the measurement and manipulation mechanism.  Furthermore, one needs to be able to turn off the coupling of the qubits to the measurement so as to not decohere the qubits while performing operations on them.

===Quantum decoherence===
One major problem is keeping the components of the computer in a coherent state, as the slightest interaction with the external world would cause the system to [[quantum decoherence|decohere]]. This effect causes the unitary character (and more specifically, the invertibility) of quantum computational steps to be violated. Decoherence times for candidate systems, in particular the transverse relaxation time T<sub>2</sub> (terminology used in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/270/5234/255] The issue for optical approaches are more difficult as these timescales are orders of magnitude lower and an often cited approach to overcome it uses [[Debabrata Goswami|optical pulse shaping approach]].  Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much quicker than the decoherence time. If the error rate is small enough, it is possible to use quantum error correction, which corrects errors due to decoherence, thereby allowing the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time. An often cited (but rather arbitrary) figure for required error rate in each gate is 10<sup>&minus;4</sup>. This implies that each gate must be able to perform its task 10,000 times faster than the decoherence time of the system.

Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L''<sup>4</sup> and ''L''<sup>6</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of bits in the number to be factored. For a 1000 bit number, this implies a need for 10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>18</sup> qubits. Fabrication and control of this large number of qubits is non-trivial for any of the proposed designs.

One approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a [[topological quantum computer]] with [[anyon]]s, quasi-particles used as threads and relying on [[knot theory]] to form stable logic gates.

===Candidates===
There are a number of quantum computing candidates, among those:
#[[Superconductor]]-based quantum computers (including [[SQUID]]-based quantum computers)
#[[Trapped ion quantum computers]]
#[[Electrons on helium quantum computers]]
#"[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] on [[molecule]]s in [[solution]]"-based
#"[[Quantum dot]] on surface"-based
# "[[Cavity quantum electrodynamics]]" ([[CQED]])-based
#"[[Molecular magnet]]"-based
#[[Fullerene]]-based ESR quantum computer
#Solid state NMR [[Kane quantum computer]]s
#Optic-based quantum computers ([[Quantum optics]])
#[[Topological quantum computer]]

In 2005, researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] built a [[semiconductor chip]] which functioned as an [[ion trap]]. Such devices, produced by standard [[lithography]] techniques, may point the way to scalable quantum computing tools. [http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?Releases/2005/Dec05/r121205b] An improved version was made in 2006.

==Quantum computing in computational complexity theory==
This section surveys what is currently known mathematically about the power of quantum computers. It describes the known results from [[computational complexity theory]] and the [[theory of computation]] dealing with quantum computers.

The class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers is called '''[[BQP]]''', for "bounded error, quantum, polynomial time". Quantum computers only run randomized algorithms, so '''BQP''' on quantum computers is the counterpart of '''[[BPP]]''' on classical computers. It is defined as the set of problems solvable with a polynomial-time algorithm, whose probability of error is bounded away from one quarter (Nielsen & Chuang 2000). A quantum computer is said to "solve" a problem if, for every instance, its answer will be right with high probability. If that solution runs in polynomial time, then that problem is in '''BQP'''.

'''BQP''' is suspected to be disjoint from [[NP-complete]] and a strict superset of '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', but that is not known. Both [[integer factorization]] and [[discrete logarithm problem|discrete log]] are in '''BQP'''. Both of these problems are '''NP''' problems suspected to be outside '''BPP''', and hence outside '''P'''. Both are suspected to not be [[NP-complete]]. There is a common misconception that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. That is not known to be true, and is generally suspected to be false.

An operator for a quantum computer can be thought of as changing a vector by multiplying it with a particular matrix. Multiplication by a matrix is a [[linear transformation|linear]] operation. It has been shown that if a quantum computer could be designed with ''nonlinear'' operators, then it could solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. It could even do so for [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]] problems. It is not yet known whether such a machine is possible.

Although quantum computers are sometimes faster than classical computers, ones of the types described above can't solve any problems that classical computers can't solve, given enough time and memory (albeit possibly an amount that could never practically be brought to bear). A [[Turing machine]] can simulate these quantum computers, so such a quantum computer could never solve an [[undecidable]] problem like the [[halting problem]]. The existence of "standard" quantum computers does not disprove the [[Church-Turing thesis]] (Nielsen and Chuang 2000).

Very recently, [[Debabrata Goswami|some researchers]] have begun to investigate the possibility of using quantum mechanics for [[hypercomputation]] - that is, solving undecidable problems. Such claims have been met with very considerable skepticism as to whether it is even theoretically possible; see the [[hypercomputation]] article for more details.
