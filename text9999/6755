The '''Battle of the Audierne Bay''' took place on 23 August 1944 and was an engagement between [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and [[Allied powers of World War II|Allied]] naval flotillas. Three Allied warships, had already established control off the coast of Brittany and were lurking off [[Audierne]] in south of the invested fortress of Brest, intercepted and sank eight German vessels of an armed convoy. This was the conclusion of Operation Kinetic; an allied plan to intercept shipping and hinder Germans besieged at Brest.<ref name=OHara232>{{cite book|last=O'Hara|title=The German Fleet at War|page=232}}</ref> 

==Background==
By 11 August, the [[Operation L<U+00FC>ttich|Mortain counter-offensive]] had ground to a halt. To the east, US forces took [[Argentan]] on 13 August while British and Canadian forces closed in toward [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] from the north, thus initiating the drive to encircle and destroy two German armies inside the [[Falaise Pocket]]. As the siege of the Breton ports continued, the focus of the war was quickly shifting further east.<ref name=autogenerated0>German pg. 161 </ref>

Operation ''Kinetic'' had been set up by the Royal [[Navy Command Headquarters]]; the objective of which was to eliminate the German navy all along the French Atlantic ports.<ref name=autogenerated>Paterson pg 264</ref> Of three Forces of Kinetic - Force 27 under the command of William Davis, consisting of the light cruiser [[HMS Mauritius (80)|HMS ''Mauritius'']] and the destroyers [[HMS Ursa (R22)|HMS ''Ursa'']] and  [[HMCS Iroquois (G89)|HMCS ''Iroquois'']], departed [[Plymouth]] on 13 August to carry out a new patrol along the central section of the [[Biscay]] coast. With the Germans under the command of [[Marinegruppenkommando West]] on the move to evacuate by sea, the ongoing ''Kinetic'' had already scored two successes and was finalizing  for the naval offensive in the [[Bay of Biscay]] to complete the success.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=James A.|title=The Biscay Blockade: Canadian Tribal Class Destroyers in Operation Kinetic|pages=|journal=The Northern Mariner / Le marin du nord|date=2003|volume=13|issue=Canadian Nautical Research Society/Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> canadienne pour la recherche nautique|pages=42-47|url=http://www.cnrs-scrn.org/northern_mariner/|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>

On the night of 22/23 August, under orders from naval intelligence the cruiser HMS ''Mauritius'' and the destroyers HMCS ''Iroquois'' and HMS ''Ursa'' were patrolling Audierne Bay between Brest and Lorient and radar soon picked up a large contact heading towards them.<ref>{{cite book|last=H<U+00FC>mmelchen|first=Gerhard|title=Chronology of the War at Sea, 1939-1945: 1943-1945  Volume 2|date=1972|publisher=Allan|location=University of Michigan|pages=441-42|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Chronology_of_the_War_at_Sea_1939_1945_1.html?id=O6MgAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>

Davis ordered ''Iroquois''; the ship closest to the contact, commanded by [[James Calcutt Hibbard]] to use the [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 293 radar|Type 293 radar]] and relay the information to the rest of the force.<ref name=autogenerated0/> Hibbard placed so much confidence in the radar that he decided to direct the opening moves from the [[Operations room|Action Information Centre]] rather than the bridge, and then gave the order to illuminate with [[starshell]]. As a result ''Force 27'' was able to close undetected and launched a surprise attack on the known convoy which were three ships.<ref name=OHara232/>

At 0213 ''Iroquois'' scored the first hit on [[Vorpostenboot|flak ship]], which was subsequently set on fire. A second flak ship was quickly destroyed by the heavy guns from ''Mauritius'', while another was set on fire and driven onto the shoals. Only nineteen minutes after opening fire, all three German ships had been put out of action, with two sunk and the third aground and burning.<ref name=autogenerated0/>

In a second action two hours later, ''Iroquois'' detected another convoy of four ships departing from the harbour of Brest: an [[M-class minesweeper (Germany)|M-class minesweeper]], two flak ships and a converted mine-destructor ship, or "[[Sperrbrecher]]".<ref name=autogenerated1/> Using the radar on ''Iroquois'' again, Force 27 stalked the convoy at long range until 0408, when the German ships were illuminated with starshell. Upon opening fire, the British and Canadians quickly overwhelmed the convoy sinking two vessels and causing two others to collide in the confusion and burst into flames as they raced for shore, with surviving crew members jumping over the side as they went. One of these vessels capsized and sank while the other drove onto the rocks at full speed and exploded.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

At dawn, Force 27 continued with another sweep around Audierne Bay in order to confirm the destruction of the German convoy.<ref name=OHara232/> In the process a minesweeper came into view and was pounded with gunfire and driven onto a reef near Port Audierne. ''Iroquois'' finished off the minesweeper with a torpedo, while ''Ursa'' sent on a boarding party onto the other grounded vessel to grab eleven prisoners. The other one hundred and fifty survivors who were able to swim to shore were subsequently taken prisoner by the [[French Resistance]]. This was the last part of the action and the force consolidated and reviewed the damage they had caused.<ref name=autogenerated0/>

==Aftermath==
The final tally for the night was eight ships destroyed: one minesweeper driven ashore and heavily damaged, a flak ship, five armed trawlers, and the Sperrbrecher.<ref name=OHara232/> ''Iroquois'' alone had fired a total of 1,197 rounds of 4.7-inch along with 231 rounds of starshell. Davis in his report attributed the success of the night's action to two principal causes: "some lucky guesses, and the excellence of ''Iroquois''' radar and plotting teams". <ref name=autogenerated1/> Although not known to Davis, it was actually [[Ultra]] intelligence that bore some responsibility for the luck of those guesses.<ref name=autogenerated0/>

In the last week of August, another naval operation commenced this time Operation Assault, the cruiser HMS ''Bellona'' patrolled along the Biscay coast from [[Belle <U+00CE>le|Belle Isle]] near Lorient to [[Arcachon Point]], south-west of [[Bordeaux]]. Continuing these sweeps through the remainder of the month, the Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy patrolled off the coast and sent landing parties ashore on the French mainland and outlying islands to secure them. eliminated as a potential base of logistical supply. The blockade of these Biscay ports, however, achieved impressive results independent of the campaign on land.<ref name=autogenerated1/> 

By the close of the Operation Kinetic, the combined Allied naval and air offensive resulted in the collapse of Marinegruppenkommando West and all the Kriegsmarine in Western France which became extinct as an organized formation of the German Navy.<ref name=autogenerated/>
