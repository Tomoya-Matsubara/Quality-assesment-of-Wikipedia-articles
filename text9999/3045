It has about 1,500 members and hosts about 1,400 people each week at its three Sunday services.

==History==
Tenth Presbyterian Church dates back to the early nineteenth century when [[Philadelphia]] was the second largest city in the country. The original Tenth Church, founded in [[1829]], was located on the northeast corner of Twelfth and Walnut Streets. It established a daughter church in [[1855]]-[[1856]] called the West Spruce Street Presbyterian Church on the southwest corner of Seventeenth and Spruce Streets. The two churches worked together, with the ministers exchanging pulpits each week. Due to membership decline in the original Tenth Church caused by population shifts, the two churches merged in [[1893]] at the Seventeenth and Spruce Streets location, taking the name of the older church (Tenth Presbyterian Church).

Tenth Church was designed by John McArthur, Jr., the architect who later had the distinction of being chosen to design City Hall. In 1893, the notable Frank Miles Day was hired to perform major alterations in the structure and the interior decoration.
