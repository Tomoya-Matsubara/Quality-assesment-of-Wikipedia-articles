The '''Yugoslav destroyer ''Beograd''''' was a [[destroyer]] built for the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in 1937. During the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she was captured by the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) and saw active service under the name '''''Sebenico'''''. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was captured by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Kriegsmarine|Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kriegsmarine}}) and redesignated '''''TA43'''''. She was sunk at [[Trieste]] by [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] [[artillery]] fire on 30 April 1945. She was raised in June 1946, probably to remove her as a navigation hazard, only to be scuttled a month later.

==Description and construction==
The ''Beograd''-class were developed from the French [[Bourrasque-class destroyer|''Simoun''-class destroyers]], and the first of class ''Beograd'' was built by [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] at [[Nantes]], France.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}

The ship had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|98|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.45|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a normal draught of {{convert|3.18|m|ft|abbr=on}}. While her standard displacement was {{convert|1210|LT}}, she displaced {{convert|1655|LT}} fully loaded. The crew consisted of 145 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] (''Beograd'' Curtis) [[steam turbine]]s driving two propellors, using steam generated by three [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} The turbines were rated at {{convert|44000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} and she was designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|37|kn|km/h}}. She carried {{convert|120|LT}} of fuel oil to give her a range of {{convert|1000|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=106}}

'''Beograd''' was originally armed with four single mount {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, four double mount {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, two [[machine gun]]s and two triple mount {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]]. As built, she could also carry 30 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}

==Career==
In April 1941, Yugoslavia was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Axis powers]], and ''Beograd'' was captured by the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) and was operated by them under the name ''Sebenico''. When the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Kriegsmarine|Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kriegsmarine}}) seized ''Sebenico'' in the port of [[Venice]] and renamed her ''TA43''.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}

While in German service her anti-aircraft armament was improved using space provided by removing one of the triple torpedo mounts. She subsequently carried seven {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns in one double and five single mounts, as well as two single mount {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns.{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=106}} ''Beograd'' was launched on 23 December 1937.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}

She was sunk at [[Trieste]] by [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] [[artillery]] fire on 30 April 1945. She was raised in June 1946, probably to remove her as a navigation hazard, only to be scuttled a month later.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}
