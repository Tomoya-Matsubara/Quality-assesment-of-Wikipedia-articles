*[[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] ({{by|2005}}<U+2013>present)
}}
'''Scott Wynne Feldman''' (born February 7, 1983, in {{city-state|Kailua|Hawaii}}) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[right-handed]] [[starting pitcher]] for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. 

After going 25<U+2013>2 in his first two years of [[college baseball]], he was drafted in the 30th round by the Rangers in 2003. Feldman had [[Tommy John surgery]] later that year. He followed it up with a minor league career in which he had a 2.70 ERA, and held batters to only 6.6 hits per 9 [[Innings pitched|innings]], pitching almost exclusively in [[relief pitcher|relief]].  

After pitching out of the bullpen while bouncing back and forth between Texas and its [[AAA (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate in 2005<U+2013>07, Feldman converted to a [[starting pitcher|starter]] in 2008. He established himself in 2009 with a breakout season for the Rangers.

==Early life and high school==
The 6' 5" Feldman was big from an early age.  His father recalled with a chuckle: "His second-grade teacher made a comment to my wife that it was like '[[Alice in Wonderland]],' because Scott was always too big for his seat."<ref name=sf>{{cite web|last=Schwab|first=Matt|title=Ex-CSM star aiming for majors: Scott Feldman thriving after elbow surgery|publisher=''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]''|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/10/PNGQKD4KS21.DTL|date=6/10/05|accessdate=8/17/09}}</ref>

As for Feldman's road to the major leagues, "The dream started off like any other kid," Feldman said. "You<U+2019>d think about it as you were watching games in front of the TV, and you<U+2019>d think about it playing in the neighborhood park with your friends.  You always hope, but you just don<U+2019>t know if it<U+2019>s ever going to happen."<ref name="Lee">{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Emmanuel|title=Former CSM star hits the big time|publisher =''[[The San Mateo Daily Journal]]''|date=4/6/06|url=http://www.smdailyjournal.com/article_preview.php?id=56981&eddate=04/06/2006|accessdate=4/15/07}}</ref>

His father, Marshall, an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]] who grew up in a Pennsylvania coal mining town and played college baseball at [[Duquesne]], coaching Feldman in youth baseball in North California.<ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080607&content_id=2861259&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Feldman carries lots of respect for dad; Long nights playing catch in park helped shape life in Majors," ''[[MLB.com]]'', 6/13/08, accessed 7/20/09]</ref>

Feldman attended [[Burlingame High School]] in [[Burlingame, California]], where he pitched a [[no-hitter]].<ref name=swe>{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=T.R.|title=Rangers look to Feldman to stop sweep|publisher=''MLB.com''|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080413&content_id=2522944&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex|date=4/13/08|accessdate=8/15/09}}</ref>  He was known more for his hitting than his pitching during high school.<ref name="Lee"/>  A [[left-handed]] hitter, Feldman led the Peninsula Athletic League in [[batting average]] as a junior, and nearly matched the feat as a senior.<ref name="Schwab">{{cite web|last=Schwab|first=Matt|title=Ex-CSM star aiming for majors|publisher=''The San Francisco Chronicle''|date=6/10/05|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/10/PNGQKD4KS21.DTL|accessdate=4/15/07}}</ref>  He was also overweight; at one point in high school he was up to 265 pounds.<ref name=sf/><ref name="Lee"/>

==College==
He lost 40 pounds before the start of his freshman year at the [[College of San Mateo]], and ended up [[Walk-on (sports)|walking on to the team]] without a college scholarship.<ref name="Lee"/><ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080503&content_id=2635879&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Feldman ready to pitch near home," ''MLB.com'', 5/4/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  There, in two seasons he went 25<U+2013>2 (his only [[Loss (baseball)|losses]] coming in the state "final four"), with a 1.30 [[Earned run average|ERA]] and a [[strikeout]]-to-[[Base on balls|walk]] ratio of 8-to-1.<ref name="Lee"/>  "When Feldman pitched," said Bulldogs coach Doug Williams, "the game was 95% over."<ref>[http://www.smdailyjournal.com/article_preview.php?id=58682 Lee, Emanuel, "CSM suffers heartbreaking loss," ''The San Mateo Daily Journal'', 5/15/06, accessed 8/14/09]</ref>  He earned '''Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year''' honors both as a freshman in 2002 and as a sophomore in 2003, and was also an [[All American]] both years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scott Feldman <U+2014> Player File|publisher=''MLB.com''|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=444857|accessdate=4/15/07}}</ref>  "He has a gift," Williams said.<ref name=sf/>

Picked in the 41st round (the 1,241st pick overall) of the [[2002 Major League Baseball Draft]] by the [[Houston Astros]], he did not sign.  He was then drafted again, in the 30th round (886th overall) of the [[2003 Major League Baseball Draft|2003 Draft]] by the Texas Rangers, 13 rounds behind future teammate [[Ian Kinsler]], and this time he signed with the Rangers after they offered him "6th-round money."<ref name="Lee"/><ref name=brb>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Scott Feldman stats|publisher=Baseball Reference|url= http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/feldmsc01.shtml|date=|accessdate=8/17/09}}</ref>

==Minor leagues==
Feldman underwent reconstructive elbow surgery for a torn [[ulnar collateral ligament]], also known as "Tommy John surgery", in October 2003.<ref name=sf/><ref name="Schwab"/><ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article/article?f=/c/a/2004/07/23/PNGF07OO3T1.DTL Lee, Emanuel, "Seven CSM baseball vets win scholarships," ''The San Francisco Chronicle'', 7/23/04, accessed 8/14/09]</ref>  It limited him to four appearances in 2004 for the [[Arizona League Rangers]] in the [[Arizona League]], in which he pitched seven scoreless innings.<ref name=min>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Scott Feldman: Minor League Stats|publisher=''[[Baseball Reference]]''|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=feldma001sco|date=|accessdate=8/14/09}}</ref>  

He began the 2005 season with the [[Single-A]] [[Bakersfield Blaze]], but after nine scoreless innings in relief was quickly promoted to the [[Double-A]] [[Frisco RoughRiders]].<ref name=min/>

On July 28, Feldman and two teammates combined for a [[perfect game]], as the RoughRiders defeated the [[Corpus Christi Hooks]] 3<U+2013>0.  It was only the third nine-inning perfect game in the [[Texas League]]'s 117-year history, and the first combined one.  Feldman was tasked with getting the last three outs, and with two outs in the ninth he let the count get to 3<U+2013>1.<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/minors/050729dish.html "Baseball America's Daily Dish," ''[[Baseball America]]'', 7/29/05, accessed 8/14/09]</ref>  "I was just telling myself, 'Don't walk him,'" Feldman said. "Once it got to 3-1, I threw it right down the middle.  If they got a hit, they got a hit.  But they're not going to break up a perfect game on a walk."  The batter grounded out.<ref>[http://www.caller.com/ccct/hooks/article/0,1641,CCCT_17996_3963027,00.html Rajan, Greg, "Pitchers perfect:  It's 27 up, 27 down as CC falls to Frisco," ''[[Corpus Christi Caller-Times]]'', 7/29/05, accessed 8/14/09]</ref>  On July 31, the three pitchers shared the '''Texas League Pitcher of the Week''' Award.<ref>[http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3863364 "Texas League Update," ''OurSports Central'', 7/13/09, accessed 8/16/09]</ref>

With the RoughRiders, he held opposing batters to a .202 batting average in 46 relief appearances, led the team with 14 [[Save (baseball)|saves]] (which tied for fifth-most in the league), and had a 2.36 ERA.<ref name=min/><ref name=mlb>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Scott Feldman bio|publisher=''MLB.com''|url=http://rangers.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=444857|date=|accessdate=8/17/09}}</ref>  For the 2005 season, between the two teams he had a 2.06 ERA and 17 saves in 52 appearances, all in relief.<ref name=min/> ''[[Baseball America]]'' tabbed him as having the best control of all minor league pitchers in the Rangers' organization.<ref name=mlb/>

Prior to the 2006 season, ''[[MLB.com]]'' beat reporter T.R. Sullivan opined that Feldman was the Rangers' top minor league relief prospect.<ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060211&content_id=1310123&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Mailbag: Will Rangers 'pen be reliable?:  Beat reporter T.R. Sullivan answers fans' questions," ''MLB.com'', 2/13/06, accessed 8/14/09]</ref>  In 2006, in 23 relief appearances for the Rangers' Triple-A  affiliate, the [[Oklahoma RedHawks]], he had a 1.98 ERA, and in 2007 in 21 relief appearances for the team he had a 4.50 ERA.<ref name=min/>  Later in 2007, he pitched in the [[Arizona Fall League]], to work on a new three-quarters delivery.<ref>[http://padres.scout.com/a.z?s=315&p=2&c=709292 Cole, Jason, "Winterball Roundup," ''[[Scout.com]]'', 12/5/07, accessed 4/15/09]</ref>  

In 2008, as the Rangers decided to convert Feldman to a starter, he started and won a game for Frisco, taking a perfect game into the fifth and a no-hitter into the seventh ("For my first start, it was a lot of fun," Feldman said).<ref name=swe/>  He also started and won the two games that he pitched for Oklahoma.<ref name=swe/><ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080413&content_id=2523281&vkey=pr_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex "Rangers recall RHP Scott Feldman; Option RHP Kazuo Fukumori to Triple-A Oklahoma," ''MLB.com'', 4/13/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref><ref name=min/><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/baseball/articles/20080329/1021958-p.html "Kason Gabbard throws 4 perfect innings for Rangers before struggling in 5th," ''[[The Sporting News]]'', 3/29/08, accessed 4/15/09]</ref>

Overall, through 2008 Feldman had a minor league career ERA of 2.70 in 153.1 innings in 105 games (all but 6 as a reliever), and gave up on average only 6.6 hits per every 9 innings.<ref name=min/>

==Major leagues==
===Texas Rangers (2005<U+2013>present)===
====2005: Breaking in====
Feldman was a late-season call-up in 2005.  The first time he walked into the Rangers<U+2019> locker room was with a sense of awe: "The night before, I didn<U+2019>t sleep a minute. I didn<U+2019>t know what to expect, but when I walked in, I saw a lot of the guys I had seen on TV all these years, and was like, 'Holy cow, I<U+2019>m in the big leagues.'"<ref name="Lee"/>  

He made his major league debut against the [[Chicago White Sox]] on August 31, 2005.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DIQM-hoYYhcC&pg=PA132&dq=%22scott+feldman%22+-%22judy+scott+feldman%22+baseball#v=onepage&q=%22scott%20feldman%22%20-%22judy%20scott%20feldman%22%20baseball&f=false Sox: Icon Group International, Inc., "Webster<U+2019>s Facts and Phrases (2008), p. 132, ''ICON Group International'', ISBN 0546669298, ISBN 9780546669299]</ref>  In 8 relief appearances with the Rangers, he compiled a record of 0<U+2013>1, with an ERA of 0.91 in 9.1 innings of work.<ref name=brb/>

====2006: Brawl==== 
Towards the end of the [[spring training]] in 2006, Feldman was feeling confident that he was going to make the parent club's [[25-man roster]].  A week before [[opening day]] he was called into [[Manager (baseball)|Manager]] [[Ron Washington]]'s office.  But instead of telling Feldman he had made the team, for the first 10 minutes Washington and the team's pitching coach spoke on and on about how Feldman had had a solid spring training <U+2014> but needed to work on some things.  Feldman couldn't believe it, but eventually thought, "Holy smoke, I<U+2019>m going down [to the minors]."  Suddenly, unable to continue the prank any longer, Washington burst out laughing.  "Pack your bags rookie, you<U+2019>re coming with us!" he said.<ref>[http://www.smdailyjournal.com/article_preview.php?id=91357 Lee, Emmanuel, "Former Bulldog takes mound for Rangers," ''The San Mateo Daily Journal'', 5/5/08, accessed 7/16/09]</ref>

During the regular season, Feldman bounced back and forth between the Rangers and Oklahoma.

The national spotlight shone briefly on Feldman on August 16, 2006, when he sparked a [[bench-clearing brawl]] in the ninth inning of a game between the Rangers and the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. Tensions between the two division rivals were already high, as two Rangers starting pitchers <U+2014> [[Adam Eaton]] and [[Vicente Padilla]] <U+2014> had been ejected in previous games that month for throwing at Angels batters, along with Texas manager Buck Showalter. Prior to Feldman taking the mound, on a night with a game-time temperature of 101 degrees, two Angels pitchers ([[Kevin Gregg]] and [[Brendan Donnelly]]) had already been thrown out of the game for hitting Rangers batters, and Angels' manager [[Mike Scioscia]] and acting manager/bench coach [[Ron Roenicke]] had been ejected as well.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=qLAvTy_-ePwC&pg=PA142&dq=%22scott+feldman%22+-%22judy+scott+feldman%22+baseball#v=onepage&q=&f=false Vrusho, Spike, "Benchclearing: Baseball's Greatest Fights and Riots" (2008),  p. 142, ''Globe Pequot'', [[ISBN]] 1599210525, ISBN 9781599210520, accessed 8/16/09]</ref>

In 36 relief appearances in 2006, he had an ERA of 3.92.<ref name=brb/> In games that were late and close, Feldman did not give up any hits while facing 16 batters.<ref name=brb/>
[[File:ScottFeldmanSidearm.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Feldman pitching in April 2007|alt=Pitcher in blue cap delivering a sidearm pitch to the plate]]

====2007: First win====
Feldman was in the Rangers' 2007 spring training camp, and won the final spot in the Texas bullpen.<ref>[http://story.scout.com/a.z?s=283&p=2&c=630885 "Rangers make trio of roster moves," ''Scout.com'', 3/29/07, accessed 4/15/07]</ref>  He picked up his first Major League victory on April 11 in his 47th big-league appearance.  "I'll always remember it, no doubt about it," Feldman said.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070410&content_id=1890788&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Sullivan, T.R., "Offense powers Rangers over Rays," ''MLB.com'', 4/11/07, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>

He was sent down, however, on May 1. That began a trend, as he was called up and send down five more times during the season.<ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/article/2007-08-23/texas-recalls-feldman-designates-melhuse-assignment "Texas recalls Feldman, designates Melhuse for assignment

He made some changes in his delivery in September.  Instead of throwing sidearm, he raised his arm angle and threw from a three-quarters delivery, which pitching coach [[Mark Connor]] observed gave him more sink on his fastball and downward movement on his breaking ball.  "This has a chance to be pretty good," Connor said. "He was busting his fastball 94<U+2013>95, the ball was sinking, and his four-seamer was cutting."<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070904&content_id=2189042&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Sullivan, T.R., "Notes: Loe to miss his next start," ''MLB.com'', 9/4/07, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  

He was 1-2 for the season, with a 5.77 ERA in 29 games.<ref name=brb/>  He held the first batter he faced in each game to a .160 batting average, and his "ground ball:fly ball ratio" of 1.39 was the highest on the team.<ref name=brb/>

====2008: Conversion to starter====
In spring training in 2008, Feldman changed his release point, and used the three-quarter delivery that he had begun to use late in 2007.  Manager Ron Washington noted: "It makes his ball heavier, and his movement a little more pronounced."<ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080225&content_id=2389249&vkey=spt2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Notes: Narron back in the fold," ''MLB.com'', 2/25/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>

In late March, he was one of three pitchers vying for one [[Long reliever|long relief]] spot on the team, though the Rangers also began experimenting with converting him to be a starter.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/031808dnsporanglede.3ac67f0.html Grant, Evan, "Jason Jennings picks up pace for Texas Rangers," ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' 3/18/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  General Manager [[Jon Daniels]] observed:  "Toward the end of spring training something clicked with his new [three-quarter] arm slot."<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080411&content_id=2516404&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Sullivan, T.R., "Feldman to make the start Sunday: Right-hander will be called up from Double-A to face Jays," ''MLB.com'', 4/11/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  On March 22, despite Feldman's success with his new, higher arm angle, the Rangers optioned him to Oklahoma, where he was a starter.<ref>[http://www.rotoworld.com/content/playerpages/playerbreakingnews.asp?sport=MLB&id=4280&line=231618&spln=1 "Fantasy Baseball Breaking News:  Scott Feldman: Rangers cut Feldman, Shelton," ''[[Rotoworld]]'', 3/22/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  In April he bounced back and forth between Texas and Frisco.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080414&content_id=2527850&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Bump, Larry, "Texas boosts 'pen by recalling Littleton," ''MLB.com'', 4/14/08, accessed 7/25/09]</ref>  

In his first Major League start, on April 13, he allowed three runs in six innings and did not receive a decision. "Feldman was outstanding," manager Washington said. "He hung in there and battled."<ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080413&content_id=2523474&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Rangers fall in extras to Blue Jays:  Feldman gives solid effort in no-decision as Texas gets swept," ''MLB.com'', 4/13/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  Feldman recorded his first major league [[Hit (baseball)|hit]] on June 13 against [[<U+00D3>liver P<U+00E9>rez]] of the [[New York Mets]].  

On August 13, against the [[Boston Red Sox]], he allowed a franchise-record 10 runs in the first inning.  He also became the first major league pitcher in 90 years to give up at least 12 runs in a game and not take the loss (the prior one being [[Gene Packard]] of the St. Louis Cardinals on August 3, 1918).<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080813&content_id=3300396&vkey=news_bos&fext=.jsp&c_id=bos Petraglia, Mike, "Records galore set in Fenway slugfest: Red Sox, Rangers match league mark for runs scored in game," ''MLB.com'', 8/13/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref><ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/dailypitch/2008-08-13-yanks-injuries_N.htm Bloch, Teddy, "Fading Yankees see injuries as their downfall," ''[[USA Today]]'', 8/13/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>

T.R. Sullivan of ''MLB.com'' wrote towards the end of the season: "He's going to win the bronze medal for innings pitched on the Rangers this season....

For the season, he was 6-8 in 25 starts and 3 relief appearances, over 151.1 innings <U+2014> just two innings fewer than he had pitched in his entire minor league career.  He also led the Rangers' pitching staff in [[quality start]]s (13), quality start percentage (52%), strikes looking (29%), "grounded into double plays" (24), and "grounded into double play rate" (21%).<ref name=mlb/><ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/29/SPDE16NSU5.DTL&hw=nolan&sn=030&sc=118 Shea, John, "Rangers dangerous, but are they armed?," ''The San Francisco Chronicle'', 3/29/09, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  His 13 unearned runs tied for the third-highest total in the AL.<ref name=mlb/>

During the off-season, club president [[Nolan Ryan]] emphasised conditioning for the Rangers pitchers.  Feldman and nine other of the team's top young pitchers were brought to Arlington in November for a week-long conditioning camp.  "It's different," Feldman said. "In the past, it was a little more of 'this is what you need to do, now go out and do it.' Most guys would do it, but this is their way of overseeing it and making sure everybody is ready."<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081111&content_id=3674627&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb&partnerId=rss_mlb Sullivan, T.R., "Pitchers get taste of Rangers' new plan: Team is turning up intensity of conditioning regimen," ''MLB.com'', 11/11/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>

====2009: Breakout season====   
As the Rangers' [[middle relief]] became a concern during spring training, it was decided that Feldman would begin 2009 as a reliever, and [[Kris Benson]] would start for Texas.  "Feldman makes us a better team in the bullpen," explained Washington.  "He goes down there with better stuff than he had before."<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090401&content_id=4101800&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp Sullivan, T.R., "Feldman headed to Rangers' bullpen," ''MLB.com'', 4/1/09, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  Feldman, for his part, admitted to being disappointed about his move from the rotation to the pen.<ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090402&content_id=4112736&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Feldman finishes spring strong:  Righty allows just one run in four innings; Fox belts three-run homer," ''MLB.com'', 4/2/09, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>

Within a month Benson was injured, however, and Feldman took his place in the rotation on April 25.  "I'm excited," said Feldman. "I love starting."<ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090424&content_id=4407116&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Feldman wants to make most of start," ''MLB.com'', 4/24/09, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  He pitched well using a new full windmill [[Pitching position|windup]], rather than the compact delivery he had used before, and remained in the rotation thereafter.<ref>[http://www.kxii.com/sports/headlines/43705807.html "Rangers hit 4 homers, beat Baltimore 6-5," ''[[KXII]]'', 4/25/09, accessed 8/15/09]</ref><ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090425&content_id=4423768&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Sullivan, T.R., "Feldman delivers as Rangers pop off: Spot starter feels at home in rotation, keeps Orioles at bay," ''MLB.com'', 4/25/09, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  In early May, Washington noted: "He has real life on his fastball, his slider is harder than it has been, his breaking ball is much crisper, and he's getting a good feel for his changeup. He's got four pitches he can throw over the plate."<ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090505&content_id=4577580&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Feldman holds his own in rotation," ''MLB.com'', 5/5/09, accessed 8/15/09]</ref> 

Feldman began the 2009 season 5<U+2013>0.  He sported better mechanics and a different repertoire (a new and improved [[cut fastball]]), threw 1<U+2013>2 [[mph]] harder, and kept the ball down <U+2014> forcing more [[ground ball]]s.  "Scott Feldman has been great since we put him in the starting rotation," said Manager Washington. "He always does what you need him to do, keep you in the ballgame."<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/2009-06-04-2794059203_x.htm "Feldman bests Pettitte as Rangers reclaim AL's best record," ''USA Today'', 6/4/09, 8/17/09]</ref>

At the All Star break, despite not having moved into the starting rotation until nearly a month into the season, Feldman was 8<U+2013>2, led the AL in won-lost percentage (.800), and was 9th in [[hits per nine innings]] (7.75) and [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|walks + hits per inning pitched]] (1.18).  On July 20, Nolan Ryan opined that, taking into consideration Feldman's age and the fact that he had changed his arm angle only two years prior, "he's going to get better."<ref>[http://www.bbtia.com/the-clubhouse/2009/7/20/the-nolan-ryan-live-chat-transcript.html Matschulat, Joey, "The Nolan Ryan Live Chat Transcript," ''Baseball Time in Arlington'', 7/20/09, accessed 8/16/09]</ref>

On July 25, Feldman outpitched Kansas City All Star and AL ERA leader [[Zack Greinke]] with eight innings of four-hit, shutout ball, leading the Rangers to a 2<U+2013>0 victory.  "Feldman matched the best pitcher in baseball," Washington said. "I<U+2019>m so happy for him. Two pitchers went at it pretty good, and our's won the battle."<ref name=ace >{{cite web|last=Andro |first=Anthony  |title=Texas Rangers trump AL ace for highest mark since <U+2019>04 |publisher=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/284/story/1505959.html |date=  7/24/09|accessdate=9/7/09}}</ref>  The eight innings were Feldman<U+2019>s major-league high, as he mixed in a changeup, curveball, and slider with his fastball.<ref name=ace/>

As of the end of July, opposing batters were hitting .228 against Feldman (and only .217 in his starts), the fourth-lowest batting average in the league <U+2014> the only three pitchers who kept opposing batters to lower batting averages were [[Edwin Jackson]] (.216), [[Matt Garza]] (.222), and [[Jarrod Washburn]] (.224).<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090728&content_id=6104898&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Feldman: The rock of the rotation," ''MLB.com'', 7/29/09, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  In his starts through the end of July he had a 3.04 ERA, and 12 of his 17 starts were quality starts.<ref>[http://www.sbrforum.com/Free+Picks/MLB/11662/feldman-texas-rangers-108-complete-sweep-against-detroit-tigers.aspx Fargo, Matt, "Feldman, Texas Rangers +108 complete sweep against Detroit Tigers," ''SBR Forum'', 7/29/09, accessed 8/16/09]</ref>

After he beat the [[Seattle Mariners|Mariners]] on short (three days') rest at the beginning of August for the team lead in wins, Seattle manager [[Don Wakamatsu]] said:  "I thought Feldman was awfully tough. I have seen this kid, and he gets better every year.

As of mid-August, Feldman had the most effective cut fastball in all of baseball in 2009 <U+2014> more effective even than those of [[Mariano Rivera]] and [[Roy Halladay]].<ref name=fg>{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Erik|title=The Evolution of Scott Feldman|publisher=''Fangraphs''|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/the-evolution-of-scott-feldman|date=8/12/09|accessdate=8/15/09}}</ref>  And it was the third-most-effective pitch in the major leagues, behind only [[Tim Lincecum]]<U+2019>s change-up and [[Clayton Kershaw]]<U+2019>s fastball.<ref name=fg/>  While in 2008 he used his cutter 13.4% of the time, in 2009 he was throwing it 30.4% of the time.<ref name=fg/>  The only starting pitchers who were throwing cutters more often were [[Brian Bannister]], [[Doug Davis]], and Halladay.<ref name=fg/>

The press began to take notice.  On August 14 [[Matthew Berry]] of ''[[ESPN]]'' noted that: "since April 25, when Scott Feldman ... rejoined the Rangers' rotation, only [[Justin Verlander]] has more wins than Feldman's 12."<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/baseball/flb/story?page=tmr090814 Berry, Matthew, "Vlad still ov-er-at-ed," ''[[ESPN]]'', 8/14/09, accessed 8/16/09]</ref>  And two days later, Phil Rogers wrote for ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'': "Scott Feldman is creeping into consideration for the bottom of [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] ballots."<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-16-rogers-rankings-aug16,0,5455779.column Rogers, Phil, "Phil Rogers' baseball power rankings," ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', 8/16/09, accessed 8/16/09]</ref>

On August 23, Feldman threw 7 shutout innings in a victory over the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], allowing only four hits, to improve to 13<U+2013>4 on the season.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/241655-feldman-spectacular-as-rangers-beat-rays Poust, Nick, "Rangers-Rays: Feldman Spectacular as Rangers Beat Rays," ''Bleacher Report'', 8/24/09, accessed 8/24/09]</ref>  The win put the Rangers two games up on the Rays in the AL [[wild card]] standings, and one game behind the Red Sox.  His 13th win tied him for third in the AL, only 1 victory behind league-leaders [[Josh Beckett]] and [[CC Sabathia]].

==Pitching==   
Feldman is a three-quarters pitcher with a [[Sinker (baseball)|sinker]], a low-to-mid-90s [[fastball]], a hard [[slider]] with extreme downward movement, a [[curveball|curve]], a [[changeup]], and a [[cut fastball]].<ref>[http://www.bbtia.com/the-clubhouse/2009/5/8/random-scott-feldman-observation.html Matschulat, Joey, "Random Scott Feldman Observation," ''Baseball Time in Arlington'', 5/8/09, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>

Since September 2007, when he raised his arm angle from [[sidearm]] to three-quarters, his sinker has had more bite, and he has also developed his cut fastball.  Both pitches come in on the same level and at the same speed, but they have late break in different directions <U+2014> the cutter goes in on lefties, while the sinker drops down and away on them.<ref>[http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080510&content_id=2677193&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex Sullivan, T.R., "Rangers pitchers key to winning streak," ''MLB.com'', 5/10/08, accessed 8/15/09]</ref>  In August 2009 a scout described him has having three "above-average pitches," and a "filthy" cutter.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/sportsnation/chat/_/id/28133 Law, Keith, "Chat with Keith Law," ''ESPN'', 9/3/09, accessed 9/7/09]</ref>
