'''HMS ''Dido''''' was an [[Eclipse class sloop|''Eclipse''-class]] wooden screw [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in 1869.  She was the fourth ship of the [[Royal Navy]] to bear the name.  She was reclassified in 1876<ref name=WL>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowShip.php?id=111|title=HMS ''Dido'' at William Looney website|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> as a [[corvette]], and in 1906 renamed ''Actaeon II''.  She served as a mine depot ship and was merged into the Torpedo School at Sheerness,<ref name=BCD/> being sold for breaking in 1922.<ref name=RW/>

==Design==

Designed by [[Edward James Reed|Edward Reed]],<ref name=RW>{{winfield}}</ref> the Royal Navy [[Director of Naval Construction]], the hull was of wooden construction, with iron cross beams.  A [[ram bow]] was fitted.<ref name=RW/>

===Propulsion===

Propulsion was provided by a two-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine by Humphrys, Tennant & Company driving a single screw.<ref name=RW/>

===Sail Plan===

All the ships of the class were built with a [[ship rig]], but this was altered to a [[barque]] rig.

===Armament===

The ''Eclipse'' class was designed with two 7-inch (6<U+00BD>-ton) muzzle loading rifled guns mounted in traversing slides and four 64-pounder muzzle loading rifled guns.<ref name=RW>{{winfield}}</ref> They were re-classified as corvettes in 1876, carrying 12 guns.

==History==
===Launch and Commissioning===

''Dido'' was launched at Portsmouth Dockyard on 23 October 1869 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 20 April 1871 for service on the West Coast of Africa, leaving England on 6 May.<ref name=T1/>

===West Africa Station (1871)===

''Dido'' called at [[Madeira]], arriving at Sierra Leone on 9 June.  She relieved [[HMS Sirius (1868)|HMS ''Sirius'']] at [[Bioko|Fernando Po]] on 16 July. ''The Times'' of Thursday 8 June 1876 tells the story of her next adventure:

{{cquote|Three months later, war having broken out afresh between the kingdoms of [[New Calabar]], [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], and Ekrika, thereby bringing all European trade in the rivers to a standstill, Capt. Chapman, acting under instructions from the Admiralty, proceeded with the squadron under his orders up the [[Bonny River]] - one of the mouths of the [[Niger River|Niger]] - to settle the native disputes, using force, if necessary, to open up the rivers for trade. This he accomplished most satisfactorily in conjunction with the British Consul, Capt. Hopkins, by prevailing on the contending parties to meet on board the ''Dido'', where their mutual grievances were adjusted and peace re-established at a palaver which lasted four days. The result proved a lasting benefit to the European merchants as well as to the native Kings and Chiefs, the oil trade soon reaching the large proportions of nearly half a million per annum.<ref name=T1/>}}

In December 1871 ''Dido'' arrived at [[Simonstown]], where Captain Chapman was to act as the Senior Officer during the absence of the Commodore on the West Coast. Five months later, on 16 May 1872, she left the Cape for [[Sydney]], having been ordered to join the Australian Station.<ref name=T1/>

===Australia Station (1872 - 1875)===

On her way to Sydney ''Dido'' paused at [[<U+00CE>le Saint-Paul|St. Paul's]], where the remains of [[HMS Megaera (1849)|''Megaera'']] were still to be seen. She arrived at Sydney on 3 July 1872, and then spent nine months in [[New Zealand]], followed by a journey to [[Fiji]] in February 1873.  The islands of Fiji were in a state of chaos, with the relationship between the government of King Cakabau and the European settlers brought to crisis point by the murder of the Burns family.  The Times relates what happened:

{{cquote|Bloodshed would have ensued had not Capt. Chapman, at considerable risk, taken the ''Dido'' through an intricate passage for 80 miles among the coral reefs to the Ba river, and, having invited a large number of the disaffected settlers on board, prevailed upon them to lay down their arms, the Government granting a general amnesty to all concerned, with the exception of the two ringleaders, who were detained on board for a short time in order to prevent the authorities from taking any steps against them.<ref name=T1/>}}

After remaining in Fiji for six months she left for Sydney, pausing at the islands of the [[New Hebrides]], [[Solomon Islands|Solomon]], [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], and [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] to return kidnapped South Sea Islanders.  After a stay of six months in Sydney, where a new cylinder was made, the ship returned to Fiji in July 1874, having called at [[Norfolk Island]] on her way. On 17 July news arrived of the wreck of the French warship ''L'Hermite'' at [[Wallace Island]], and ''Dido'' at once went to her assistance.  In September, Sir [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Hercules Robinson]], the Governor of New South Wales, arrived in [[HMS Pearl (1855)|HMS ''Pearl'']] to reopen negotiations for the cession of the islands. The ship took a prominent part in the ceremony which marked the final cession of Fiji to Great Britain on 10 October 1874, during which the ex-King presented the Fijian flag to Captain Chapman, when it was hauled down for the last time to make room for the [[Union Flag]]. ''Dido'' carried King Cakabau to Sydney to visit the Governor of New South Wales, and returned with him to Fiji a month later. Some sources ascribe to this visit the introduction of measles among the native population.  Having no immunity to the disease, large loss of life resulted.<ref name=BCD/> On 7 February 1875 she again left Fiji and, calling at [[New Caledonia]], she sailed for [[Auckland]].  After five months in and around New Zealand ''Dido'' returned to Sydney, where she learnt of the death of [[James Graham Goodenough|Commodore Goodenough]] from poisoned arrows in the [[Santa Cruz Islands]]. Captain Chapman received his appointment as Commodore by telegram from the Admiralty.

During her last days on the Australian Station ''Dido'' visited [[Tasmania]], leaving Sydney on 2 December for [[Melbourne]], where Commodore Chapman relinquished command of the station to Captain Hoskins.  [[HMS Sapphire (1874)|HMS ''Sapphire'']] arrived to relieve her, and she sailed for home.

{{cquote|A good passage was made to within 200 miles of Cape Pillar. Here, on 20 February, was encountered one of the most furious gales over experienced by any one on board. Although the ship was put under storm canvas, consisting of a close-reefed maintopsail and storm forestaysail, both were blown away, and soon followed by the fall of the fore and main topmasts and jibboom; the barometer fell to 28.15, the wind increased to a hurricane, and rapidly raised a tremendous sea. Fortunately the gale did not remain at its height f or more .than four hours, and, soon abating, the ship was enabled, to proceed on her voyage, and entered the Straits of Magellan, where she refitted; but, being unable to obtain spars at Sandy Point, she called at Montevideo for that purpose, as well as for provisions. The Dido left the River Plate on the 1st of April, crossed the line on the 27th, touched at Fayal (Azores) on the 21st of May, experienced successive calms and light winds until the 2d of June, and arrived at Spithead on the 6th.|20px|20px|''[[The Times]]'', 8 June 1876<ref name=T1>''[[The Times]]'', Thursday 8 June 1876</ref>}}

===Out of commission (1876 - 1879)===

On 6 June 1876 ''Dido'' returned to [[Spithead]] after a five-year commission on the [[West Africa Squadron|West Africa Station]] and [[Australian Station]],<ref name=BCD/> during which she covered over {{convert|60000|nmi|km}} in 616 days at sea.<ref name=T1/> She recommissioned at Portsmouth on 27 May 1879, now as a 12-gun corvette, commanded by Captain Arthur Richard Wright.<ref name=WL/>

===West Africa Station and the First Boer War (1879 - 1881)===

[[Image:Compton Edward Domvile.jpg|thumb|right|Compton Edward Domvile in a [[Leslie Ward]] caricature]]''Dido'' served on the West Africa Station, where Captain Wright died in command on 19 August 1879.<ref name=WL/> He was succeeded by Captain [[Compton Edward Domvile]] on 19 September 1879.

In 1881 ''Dido'' contributed 50 men and two field guns to a [[Naval Brigade]], which went to the front under Lieutenant Henry Ogle.<ref name=BCD/>  ''Dido'' lost 3 killed and 3 wounded at the [[Battle of Majuba Hill]] on 27 February.  Captain Compton Domvile went to the front to take charge of the Naval Brigade, but no further action took place before the end of the war on 23 March.<ref name=BCD/>

===North America and West Indies Station (1881 - 1886)===

The ship was re-assigned to the [[North America and West Indies Station]] in October 1881, and on 16 February 1883 paid off at Barbados<ref name=WL/>  On recommissioning Captain Frederick Samuel Vander-Meulen commanded her on the station until 1886, when she returned home to Portsmouth.

===Hulk (1886)===

On 25 September 1886 ''Dido'' paid off at Portsmouth and her sea-going equipment was removed so that her hull could be used for accommodation and storage.  She served as a mine depot in the [[Firth of Forth]], and in 1906 her name was changed to ''Actaeon II''.<ref name=RW/>  She became part of the Torpedo School at Sheerness.

==Disposal==
''Actaeon II'' was sold to J B Garnham for breaking on 17 July 1922.<ref name=RW/>
