A '''cell survival curve''' is a curve used in [[radiobiology]].

It depicts the relationship between the fraction of cells retaining their reproductive integrity and the absorbed dose. 

Conventionally, the surviving fraction is depicted on a logarithmic scale, and is plotted on the [[y-axis]] against dose on the [[x-axis]].
