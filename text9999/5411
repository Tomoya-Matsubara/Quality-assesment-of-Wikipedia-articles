'''George Pierce Doles''' ([[May 14]], [[1830]] &ndash; [[June 2]], [[1864]]) was a [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]] businessman and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general during the [[American Civil War]]. His men played a key role on the first day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in driving back the [[Union Army|Union]] [[XI Corps (ACW)|XI Corps]].

George Doles was born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], the son of Josiah and Martha (Pierce) Doles. His father was a tailor by occupation. Doles was educated in the town's common schools. He became a successful businessman in Milledgeville and was elected [[captain]] of the "Baldwin Blues," a local [[militia]] company.

With the [[secession]] of Georgia and the start of the Civil War in 1861, Doles enlisted in the Confederate army along with most of his militia unit. He was commissioned a captain in the 4th Georgia Infantry and stationed at [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. In May 1862, he was appointed [[colonel]] of the regiment and led it during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] as a part of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. He was wounded at the [[Battle of Malvern Hill]].  

During the 1862 [[Maryland Campaign]], his regiment was a part of Ripley's Brigade in [[D. H. Hill]]'s Division. It helped in the defense of [[Battle of South Mountain|South Mountain]] before withdrawing towards [[Sharpsburg, Maryland]]. When General [[Roswell Ripley]] fell with a wound at the [[Battle of Sharpsburg]] defending the "Bloody Lane," Doles assumed temporary command of the brigade. This was made official in November 1862 with his promotion to [[brigadier general]]. He led the brigade with efficiency during the battles of [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] and [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]].

During the 1863 [[Gettysburg Campaign]], Doles' Brigade formed part of [[Robert E. Rodes]]'s Division. On [[July 1]], [[1863]], Doles attacked the line of the Union XI Corps in fields near Rock Creek north of Gettysburg, driving their adversaries back over a mile. Pressure from Doles, as well as from fellow Georgia [[John B. Gordon]] and other brigades, eventually forced much of the XI Corps to collapse and retire to [[Cemetery Hill]]. Doles' men did not see any significant action the rest of the battle, nor in the subsequent [[Bristoe Campaign|Bristoe]] or [[Mine Run Campaign]]s.

In 1864, Doles led his brigade during the [[Overland Campaign]], fighting in the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and at [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], where his brigade played a role in recapturing the "Mule Shoe" [[salient]]. During the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]] in June, a Union [[sharpshooter]] instantly killed Doles as he was inspecting the Confederate entrenchments near Bethesda Church, Virginia.

He was buried in [[Memory Hill Cemetery]] in Milledgeville, Georgia.
