Captain '''John Donnell Smith''' (born [[1829]], died [[1928]]) of [[Baltimore, Maryland]] was a [[Biologist]] and [[Taxonomist]].

In January 1906, he presented his [[herbarium]] consisting of more than 100,000 mounted specimens and his botanical library of over 1600 bound volumes to the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  The books pertain mostly to the systematic botany of Mexico and Central America and remain in Baltimore.  The herbarium now forms part of the U.S. [[National Museum of Natural History|National Herbarium]] reference.
