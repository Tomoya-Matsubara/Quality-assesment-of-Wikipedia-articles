'''Patrick "Pat" Fenlon''' (born [[March 15]] [[1969]], [[Dublin, Republic of Ireland]]) is an Irish former footballer and currently a football manager.

==Management Career==
===Shelbourne FC=== 
Before becoming manager of the [[Derry]] club, Fenlon managed [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] of [[Dublin]]. He is a former player of the same club, having joined Shelbourne in 1997 from [[Dublin]] rivals [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] where he had scored 5 goals in 38 appearances. Fenlon took over the reigns at [[Tolka Park]] in a [[Player-manager|player/manager]] capacity from [[Dermot Keely]] in 2002 and guided the club to second place in his inaugural season in charge.

By the start of the 2003 season, Fenlon had hung up his boots to focus solely on the management of the club. During the off-season, he had decided to retire from the playing side of the game, and direct his efforts toward the management of Shelbourne. The rewards were immediate, and Fenlon took the club to their first ever back-to-back league titles, in [[2003]] and [[2004]]. 

The 2004 season also saw Fenlon lead his squad past [[Croatia|Croatian]] high-flyers, [[Hajduk Split]] and into the Third Qualifying Round of the [[UEFA Champions League]], where his Shelbourne side were eventually overturned by [[Spain|Spanish]] giants [[Deportivo la Coru<U+00F1>a]]. Following this amazing run, and participation in the First Round of the [[UEFA Cup]] against [[Lille OSC]], Fenlon was rewarded with a contract extension. 

[[2005]] promised big things for Pat Fenlon and Shelbourne. However, things did not go exactly as planned. In spite of several big name signings, Shelbourne staggered past the season's finishing-line in a disappointing third place. One of Fenlon's former clubs, [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], also beat Shelbourne in the first [[Setanta Cup]] final.

[[2006]] saw the return of success. Dogged by continuous rumours involving a move from [[Tolka Park]] during the 2006 season, Fenlon guided the club to their third league title in 4 years on [[17 November]] [[2006]], with a 2-1 victory over rivals [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]], which saw the Dubliners claim the title on goal difference. The media in Ireland had initially been linking Fenlon with the vacant management position at [[Dalymount Park]], however this long-standing rumour was put to rest when [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] appointed [[Sean Connor]] as their new manager on [[November 17]] [[2006]]. This was followed by reports linking Fenlon to the vacant hot-seat at [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] left by [[Stephen Kenny (football)|Stephen Kenny]], who had departed the [[Brandywell Stadium]] to take up the managers position at [[Scotland|Scottish]] side [[Dunfermline Athletic]].

Fenlon resigned from his position as Shelbourne manager on [[December 5]] [[2006]]<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/2006/1205/shelbourne.html Fenlon Resigns As Shelbourne Manager]</ref> and the reports proved true when [[Derry City F.C]]. concluded an agreement with him within four days.

===Derry City FC===
Fenlon took the managerial spot at the club that, with [[Shelbourne FC]], he beat to first position in the 2006 [[eircom League]] Premier Division on [[08 December]], 2006. With regard to the new installation, [[Derry City FC|Derry City's]] chief executive, Jim Roddy, stated, "Pat has a wealth of [[eircom League]] experience and the chairman and board of [[Derry City FC|Derry City Football Club]] are delighted to have appointed a manager of such calibre." In response, Fenlon stated his high hopes for the future: "Derry City are a highly successful and ambitious club and I<U+2019>m really looking forward to working with the players and everyone at the club."

In January, 2007, Fenlon was awarded the [[eircom]]/Soccer Writers Association of Ireland (SWAI) 'Personality of the Year' award after his success during the 2006 season with [[Shelbourne FC]]. His new team-captain at Derry City, [[Peter Hutton (footballer)|Peter Hutton]], was also included in the shortlist of six nominees for the award, as well his old team-captain at Shelbourne, [[Owen Heary]], and the man he replaced at Derry, [[Stephen Kenny (football)|Stephen Kenny]].

However, results did not favour Fenlon and he resigned his position after just five months.<ref>[http://www.derrycityfc.net/season/07/news/displaystory.php?storyid=103 Official Club Statement: Resignation of Pat Fenlon], ''CityWeb'', [[2007-05-22]]. Retrieved on [[2007-05-22]].</ref>
