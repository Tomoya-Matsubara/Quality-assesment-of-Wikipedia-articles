'''Commonwealth Securities''' is [[Australia]]'s largest discount [[stockbroking]] firm operated by the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]], one of Australia's top four [[bank]]s. The brokerage arm started operations in 1995 and launched its share trading website in 1997.<ref>[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/comsec.com.au Site Description for comsec.com.au]</ref><ref>[http://richardlees.com.au/Documents/Intel_Microsoft_Commsec_final_june2006.pdf Investment in 64-bit Itanium 2 Servers pays returns for CommSec]</ref>

Commonwealth Securities, also known as "CommSec" or "ComSec", has been highly successful as a discount broker attracting many "mums and dads" (retail) investors. It offers a telephone based brokerage service and advisory service, though its Internet trading platform constitutes the vast majority of its business.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/investment/big-is-beautiful-for-online-brokers/2006/03/27/1143441084612.html?page=3 Big is beautiful for online brokers]</ref>

CommSec initially offered only Australian [[stock|equities]] trades, but has since expanded into [[Derivative_%28finance%29|derivative products]], international equities, [[Active_management|managed funds]], Self Managed Super Fund administration, [[Contract_for_difference|Contracts-For-Difference]] and [[Margin_%28finance%29|margin lending]]. The firm's large retail customer base has also allowed it to successfully market a number of [[initial public offering]] (IPO) fund raisings.

While standard CommSec traders use the static website, frequent equities and options traders use one of the realtime trading platforms. ''CommSecIRESS'' is a web-based solution being developed by [[Iress Market Technology]] (ASX:[http://www.asx.com.au/asx/research/CompanyInfoSearchResults.jsp?searchBy=asxCode&allinfo=on&asxCode=CBA&companyName=&principalActivity=&industryGroup=NO IRE])) and based on the [[Java_(programming_language)|Java]] runtime environment, while the software, stand-alone platform ''Professional Trader'' or ''ProTrader'' runs on [[Microsoft|Microsoft]]'s [[.NET_Framework|.NET framework]]. These platforms combine all the features of the website, while adding more advanced features and streaming live data from the [[Australian Securities Exchange]].

In 2008 CommSec became the first Australian brokerage firm to offer a brokerage website specifically designed for a portable-device.<ref>[http://www.cnet.com.au/mobilephones/phones/0,239025953,339290515,00.htm?feed=pt_log CommSec launces iPhone trading app]</ref> It created CommSec iPhone Edition for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone|iPhone]], the first home-grown iPhone application in Australia. 

==Mergers and Acquisitions==

CommSec has retained and increased its significant marketshare in retail broking through both CBA's acquisition of other banks and its own acquisition of other broking firms<ref>[http://www.investordaily.com.au/archive/IDD00037452.xml CommSec snaps up direct funds firm]</ref>. CommSec now performs broking operations for Colonial First State<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s133221.htm Commonwealth Bank takes over Colonial Mutual]</ref>, TD Waterhouse<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2003/04/15/tdwaterhouse_030415.html TD Bank selling Australian discount brokerage operations]</ref>, AOT<ref>[http://forum.incrediblecharts.com/messages/12/385253.html AOT swallowed by CBA]</ref><ref>[http://www.commsec.com.au/Public/News.aspx?ID=594 FAQs FOR AOT OPTIONS CLIENTS]</ref>, Neville Ward Direct<ref>[http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/729344/fromItemId/633054 Commonwealth Securities Limited (Commsec) - acquisition of Neville Ward Direct Pty Limited]</ref><ref>[http://images.comsec.com.au/funds/ManagedFunds/Prospectus/PDFs/nwsandcommsecletter.pdf Neville Ward Direct and CommSec <U+2014> two strong teams united]</ref>, Auckland Savings Bank (ASB)<ref>[http://www.commbankuk.co.uk/moving_to_new_zealand/ Welcome to the ASB Bank of New Zealand]</ref>, and IWL (Westpac Broking, Sanford and Avcol)<ref>[http://www.investordaily.com.au/3630.htm CommSec takes over Sanfor clients]</ref>. The addition of IWL gave CommSec significant market share in wholesale broking to compliment its existing retail presence<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22173877-664,00.html Commsec unfazed in IWL purchase]</ref>.

==Cash Management==
In 2008 CommSec diversified into the short term deposit sector with the introduction of its Cash Management product.<ref>[http://www.investordaily.com.au/cps/rde/xchg/id/style/4482.htm?rdeCOQ=SID-3F579BCE-2210FDA3 Better cash management from CommSec]</ref> The product consists of two distinct accounts the CommSec Cash Account (CCA) and the CommSec Investment Account (CIA). The CCA is designed to both be the source of funds for stock trading and also an everday transaction account, with a linked debit [[Mastercard|MasterCard]]. The CIA is designed as a high interest cash deposit distinguished by its lack of tiers and that cash can only be transfered to and from the CCA.
