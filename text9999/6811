==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Afghanistan}}
The name ''Afgh<U+0101>nist<U+0101>n'', [[Persian language|Persian]]: <U+0627><U+0641><U+063A><U+0627><U+0646><U+0633><U+062A><U+0627><U+0646> {{IPA-fa|av<U+0263><U+0252>nest<U+0252>n|}},<ref>Cowan, William and Jaromira Raku<U+0161>an. Source Book for Linguistics. 3rd ed. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 1998.</ref> means the ''"[[-stan|Land of Afghans]]"'', originating from the word ''[[Afghan (name)|Afghan]]''.

===Origin of the name===
{{Main|Afghan (ethnonym)}}
The first part of the [[Afghan (ethnonym)|name ''"Afghan"'']] designates the [[Pashtun people]] since ancient times, the founders of Afghanistan and the largest [[Ethnic groups in Afghanistan|ethnic group of the country]].<ref name="Afghan">{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ch. M. Kieffer |url=http://www.iranica.com/articles/afgan-in-current-political-usage-any-citizen-of-afghanistan-whatever-his-ethnic-tribal-or-religious-affiliation |title=Afghan |encyclopedia=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica |edition=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica Online |publisher=Columbia University |date=December 15, 1983}}</ref> This name is mentioned in the form of ''Abgan'' in the 3rd century CE<ref name="Britannica-Abgan">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/129450/History?anchor=ref261360|title=History of Afghanistan|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> and as ''Avagana'' or ''[[Afghana]]'' in the 6th century CE.

The [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica]] states:{{quote|''From a more limited, ethnological point of view, "Af<u>gh</u><U+0101>n" is the term by which the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan (and the non-Pa<U+0161>t<U+014D>-speaking ethnic groups generally) designate the Pa<U+0161>t<U+016B>n. The equation [of] Afghan [and] Pa<U+0161>t<U+016B>n has been propagated all the more, both in and beyond Afghanistan, because the Pa<U+0161>t<U+016B>n tribal confederation is by far the most important in the country, numerically and politically. The term "Af<u>gh</u><U+0101>n" has probably designated the Pa<U+0161>t<U+016B>n since ancient times. Under the form Avag<U+0101>n<U+0101>, this ethnic group is first mentioned by the Indian astronomer [[Varahamihira|Var<U+0101>ha Mihira]] in the beginning of the 6th century CE in his [[B<U+1E5B>hat Sa<U+1E43>hit<U+0101>|Brihat-samhita]]''.<ref name="Afghan"/>}}

A people called the ''"Afghans"'' are mentioned several times in a 10th century [[Guide book|geography book]], [[Hudud al-'alam]]. [[Al-Biruni]] referred to them in the 11th century as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the [[Indus River]], which would be the [[Sulaiman Mountains]].<ref name="EofI">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morgenstierne|first=G.|title=AF<u>GH</u><U+0100>N|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|edition=CD-ROM Edition v. 1.0|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|year=1999}}</ref> [[Ibn Battuta]], a famous [[Morocco|Moroccan]] travelling scholar visiting the region in 1333, writes:
{{quote|''We travelled on to [[Kabul]], formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of Persians called ''Afghans''...''<ref name="Routledge"/>}}

[[Firishta|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah]] (Ferishta) explains extensively about the Afghans in the 16th century. For example, he writes:
{{quote|''The men of K<U+00E1>bul and [[Khilji dynasty|Khilj]] also went home; and whenever they were ques<U+00AD>tioned about the Musulm<U+00E1>ns of the Kohist<U+00E1>n (the mountains), and how matters stood there, they said, "Don't call it Kohist<U+00E1>n, but Afgh<U+00E1>nist<U+00E1>n; for there is nothing there but Afgh<U+00E1>ns and dis<U+00AD>turbances." Thus it is clear that for this reason the people of the country call their home in [[Pashto language|their own language]] Afgh<U+00E1>nist<U+00E1>n, and themselves Afgh<U+00E1>ns.''<ref name="Firishta"/>}}
[[File:Afghan royal soldiers of the Durrani Empire.jpg|130px|thumb|Afghan soldiers of the [[Durrani Empire]]. The [[name of Afghanistan|name ''"Afghaunistan"'']] is printed on this 1847 [[lithography|Lithograph]] by James Rattray.]]

By the 17th century, it seems that some Pashtuns themselves were using the term as an ethnonym <U+2013> a fact that is supported by traditional [[Pashto literature]], for example, in the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]:{{quote|''Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtuns, Pashtuns are Afghans!''<ref>''extract from "Passion of the Afghan"'' by [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]; translated by C. Biddulph in ''"Afghan Poetry Of The 17th Century: Selections from the Poems of Khushal Khan Khattak''", London, 1890.</ref>}}

The last part of the name, ''[[-stan|-st<U+0101>n]]'' is a Persian suffix for "place", prominent in many languages of the region. The [[name of Afghanistan|name ''"Afghanistan"'']] is described by the 16th century Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] in his [[Baburnama|memoirs]] as well as by later Mughal scholar [[Firishta]], referring to territories south of Kabul that were inhabited by Pashtuns (called ''"Afghans"'' by them).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&ct=92|title=Events Of The Year 910|accessdate=August 22, 2010|author=[[Babur|Zahir ud-Din Mohammad Babur]]|work=[[Baburnama|Memoirs of Babur]]|publisher=[[Packard Humanities Institute]] |year=1525}}</ref> Until the 19th century the name Afghanistan was used for the traditional [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun territory]], between the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains and the [[Indus River]], while the kingdom as a whole was known as the ''[[Kabulistan|Kingdom of Kabul]]'', as mentioned by the British statesman and historian [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]].<ref>[[Mountstuart Elphinstone|Elphinstone, M.]], ''"Account of the Kingdom of Cabul and its Dependencies in Persia and India"'', London 1815; published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme & Brown.</ref> In 1857, in his review of [[John William Kaye|J.W. Kaye's]] ''The Afghan War'', [[Friedrich Engels]] describes "Afghanistan" as:
{{quote|''[...] an extensive country of Asia [...] between [[Iran|Persia]] and the Indies, and in the other direction between the [[Hindu Kush]] and the Indian Ocean. It formerly included the Persian provinces of [[Khorasan Province|Khorassan]] and [[Quhistan|Kohistan]], together with [[Herat Province|Herat]], [[Balochistan|Beluchistan]], [[Kashmir|Cashmere]], and [[Sindh|Sinde]], and a considerable part of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] [...] Its principal cities are Kabul, the capital, [[Ghazni|Ghuznee]], [[Peshwar|Peshawer]], and [[Kandahar]].''<ref name="Engels"/>}}

Other parts of the country were at certain periods recognized as independent kingdoms, such as the ''Kingdom of Balkh'' in the early 18th century.<ref>[[Emanuel Bowen]], ''"A New & Accurate Map of Persia"'' in ''A Complete System Of Geography'', Printed for W. Innys, R. Ware [etc.], London 1747.</ref> With the expansion and centralization of the country, Afghan authorities adopted the name "Afghanistan" for the entire kingdom, after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties between the [[British Raj]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajarid Persia]], referring to the lands subject to the Pashtun [[Barakzai dynasty]] of Kabul.<ref>E. Huntington, ''"The Anglo-Russian Agreement as to Tibet, Afghanistan, and Persia"'', Bulletin of the American Geographical Society, Vol. 39, No. 11 (1907).</ref> Afghanistan became the official internationally recognized name in 1919 after the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]] was signed to regain the country's independence from the British,<ref>M.

It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the [[Ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within large regional empires, among them the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]], the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]], the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic Empire]] and the [[Sassanids|Sassanid Empire]]. Many kingdoms have also risen to power in what is now Afghanistan, such as the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Kabul Shahi]]s, [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Kartids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and finally the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] and [[Durrani Empire|Durrani]] dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state of Afghanistan.

During this turbulent period, Kabul had many temporary rulers until Fateh Khan's brother, Dost Mohammad Khan, captured Kabul in 1826.<ref>{{cite book |title=Afghanistan: A Military History from Alexander the Great to the War against the Taliban |last=Tanner |first=Stephen |year=2009 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0306818264 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J3pUS_-uD-oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=126 }}</ref>

====Barakzai dynasty and European influence====

[[William Brydon]] was the sole survivor of a group of 3,600 soldiers of the [[British Raj|British]] [[44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot|44th Regiment of Foot]] and 12,400 [[camp follower]]s, who were attacked between [[Kabul]] and [[Jalalabad]] while heading to what is now [[Pakistan]].]]

[[File:Zaher Shah Kennedy.jpg|thumb|King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] and wife with US President [[John F. Kennedy]] and sister [[Eunice Shriver|Eunice]] in the United States]]
During the 19th century, following the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] and the ascension of the [[Barakzai dynasty]], Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to [[British India]]. Ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the 1893 [[Durand Line]], an action which would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and British India (later the new state of Pakistan). The United Kingdom exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until the reign of King [[Amanullah Khan]] in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained independence over its foreign affairs after the signing of the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]].

King Amanullah moved to end his country's traditional isolation in the years following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]]. He established [[Foreign relations of Afghanistan|diplomatic relations with major states]] and, following a 1927<U+2013>28 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's first constitution (declared through a [[Loya Jirga]]), which made elementary education compulsory.<ref>"Education in Afghanistan", published in ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica'', volume VIII <U+2013> pp. 237<U+2013>241...[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EPS/people/Shorish-Education_in_Afghanistan.htm UIUC.edu]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}.</ref> Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional Muslim [[veil]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Habibullah Kalakani in October 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation. In 1933, however, he was assassinated in a revenge killing by a Kabul student.

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. In 1953, he was replaced by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]], nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports and other vital infrastructure. By the late 1960s, many Western travelers were using these as part of the [[hippie trail]]. In 1973, Zahir Shah's brother-in-law, Daoud Khan, launched a bloodless coup and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]] while Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit. Daoud Khan tried to implement some much needed reforms especially in the economic sector.

====Saur revolution and Soviet war====
{{Main|Saur Revolution|Soviet war in Afghanistan}}
[[Image:Day after Saur revolution in Kabul (773).jpg|thumb|Outside the Palace Gate (Arg) in [[Kabul]], the day after [[Saur Revolution]] on April 28, 1978.]]
In 1978, a prominent member of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA), [[Mir Akbar Khyber]], was allegedly killed by the Daoud government. Leaders of the PDPA feared that Daoud was planning to dismantle them because many were being arrested. [[Hafizullah Amin]] along with other PDPA members managed to remain at large and organised an uprising. The PDPA, led by [[Nur Mohammad Taraki]], [[Babrak Karmal]] and Hafizullah Amin, overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was assassinated along with his family during the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]]. Taraki was declared President, [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and General Secretary of the PDPA. Once in power, the PDPA implemented a socialist agenda. It moved to carry out an ill-conceived [[land reform]], which was misunderstood by virtually all Afghans.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofnations.net/asia/afghanistan.html |title=History of Afghanistan |publisher=Historyofnations.net |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}</ref> They also imprisoned, tortured or murdered thousands of members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment, and the intelligentsia.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> They also prohibited [[usury]]<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0028) |title=Afghanistan |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}</ref> and made a number of statements on [[women's rights]], by declaring equality of the sexes<ref name=autogenerated4 /> and introducing women to political life. [[Anahita Ratebzad]] was one of several female Marxist leaders and a member of the Revolutionary Council.

As part of its [[Cold War]] strategy, the [[White House]] in the United States began recruiting, financing and arming [[Mujahideen]] fighters during [[Operation Cyclone]] in 1979, which was aimed to defeat the Soviets. President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s National Security Advisor, [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], warned at the time that this might prompt a Soviet intervention (in an interview published in the 15<U+2013>21 January 1998 issue of the French journal ''Le Nouvel Observateur'', Brzezinski claimed that these measures were in fact specifically designed to provoke a Soviet military intervention.<ref>[http://contreinfo.info/article.php3?id_article=1403%E2%80%B3 ''ContreInfo'', published 6 November 2007; the interview is not available on the ''Le Nouvel Observateur'' website)]</ref> In March 1979, Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister, retaining the position of [[field marshal]] and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the army until September 14 when he was killed.

To bolster the [[Parcham]] faction, the Soviet Union decided to intervene on December 24, 1979, when the [[Red Army]] invaded its southern neighbor. Over 100,000 Soviet troops took part in the invasion, which was backed by another one hundred thousand [[Military of Afghanistan|Afghan military]] men and supporters of the Parcham faction. In the meantime, Hafizullah Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal. In response to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] in the U.S. increased arming and funding of the Mujahideen who began a guerilla war thanks in large part to the efforts of [[Charles Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer [[Gust Avrakotos]]. Early reports estimated that $6<U+2013>20 billion had been spent by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia<ref name="greenleft">{{cite web|year=2001 |url =http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/24198 |title = How the CIA created Osama bin Laden| publisher = greenleft.org.au}}</ref> but more recent reports state that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia provided as much as up to $40 billion<ref name="The Brunei Times">{{cite web|year=2009 |url =http://www.bt.com.bn/analysis/2008/12/17/story_of_us_cia_and_taliban|title =Story of US, CIA and Taliban| publisher = [[The Brunei Times]]}}</ref><ref name="The Nation">{{cite web|year=1999 |url =http://www.thenation.com/article/cost-afghan-victory?page=0,1|title =The Cost of an Afghan 'Victory' | publisher = [[The Nation]]}}</ref> in cash and weapons, which included over two thousand [[FIM-92 Stinger]] [[surface-to-air missiles]], for building up Islamic groups against the Soviet Union. The U.S. handled most of its support through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]. [[Saudi Arabia]] was also providing financial support.

Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989. Their withdrawal from Afghanistan was seen as an ideological victory in America, which had backed some Mujahideen factions through three U.S. presidential administrations to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]]. The [[USSR]] continued to support President [[Mohammad Najibullah]] (former head of the Afghan secret service, ''[[KHAD]]'') until 1992.<ref name="Columbia:Afghanistan:History">[http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0856490.html Afghanistan: History], ''Columbia Encyclopedia''.</ref>

After the fall of the communist [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]]-regime in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The Peshawar Accords created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an [[interim government]] for a transitional period, under President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:
{{blockquote|The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the [[Soviet]]-backed Najibullah government.

Due to the sudden initiation of the war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly-created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. Atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos as described in reports by Human Rights Watch and the Afghanistan Justice Project.<ref name="Human Rights Watch (4)"/><ref name="Afghanistan Justice Project">{{cite web |year=2005|url=http://www.afghanistanjusticeproject.org/warcrimesandcrimesagainsthumanity19782001.pdf |title =Casting Shadows: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity: 1978<U+2013>2001 | publisher = Afghanistan Justice Project}}</ref> Because of the chaos, some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their (sub-)commanders.<ref name="Human Rights Watch (5)">{{cite web |year=|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-01.htm#P81_13959|title =II.

Southern Afghanistan was under the control of neither foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and their militias. In 1994, the [[Taliban]] (a movement originating from [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the [[tyranny]] of the local governor.<ref name="Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25">Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994<U+2013>1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref> [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] started his movement with fewer than 50 armed [[madrassah]] students in his hometown of Kandahar.<ref name="Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25"/> When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities.<ref name="Human Rights Watch (5)"/> In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.

The [[Politics of Afghanistan|government of Afghanistan]] is an [[Islamic republic]] consisting of three branches, executive, legislative and judicial. The nation is currently led by the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] with [[Hamid Karzai]] as the President and [[Afghan Transitional Administration|leader]] since late 2001. The [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|National Assembly]] is the legislature, a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] body comprising of two chambers, the [[House of the People (Afghanistan)|House of the People]] and the [[House of Elders]].

==Political divisions==
{{Main|Provinces of Afghanistan|Districts of Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is administratively divided into [[provinces of Afghanistan|34 provinces]] (''[[wilayah|wilayats]]''), with each province having its own capital and a provincial administration. The provinces are further divided into about [[districts of Afghanistan|398 smaller provincial districts]], each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The [[list of current governors of Afghanistan|provincial governors]] are appointed by the [[President of Afghanistan]] and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors. The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils which are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years.<ref>[http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&cnid=24 Explaining Elections, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan]</ref> The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, [[mayor]]s of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. As for the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.

The following is a list of all the 34 [[provinces of Afghanistan]] in alphabetical order and on the right is a map showing where each province is located:

[[File:Bazaar Scene of Kabul.jpg|thumb|Local market scene in 2007]]
One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million [[Afghan diaspora|Afghan expatriates]], who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. A number of small factories began operating in different parts of the country in recent years, which not only provide revenue to the government but also create jobs. The [[Afghan rug]]s have become a popular product again and this gives the large number of rug weavers in the country a chance to earn better income. While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations.

The [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Finance]] is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. Since 2003, over 16 new banks have opened in the country, including [[Afghanistan International Bank]], [[Kabul Bank]], [[Azizi Bank]], [[Pashtany Bank]], [[Standard Chartered Bank]], [[First Micro Finance Bank]], and others. [[Da Afghanistan Bank]] serves as the central bank of the nation and the [[Afghan afghani|"Afghani"]] (AFN) is the national currency, with an exchange rate of 50 Afghanis to 1 US dollar.

Afghanistan is a member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], [[Economic Cooperation Organization|ECO]] and the [[Economy of the OIC|OIC]]. It is known for producing some of the finest [[pomegranate]]s, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits, including nuts.<ref>[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49291 Exporting Afghanistan], by P.J.

[[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] is the national carrier, with domestic flights between Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif. International flights include to [[Dubai]], Frankfurt, [[Istanbul]] and a number of other Asian destinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyariana.com/schedules.php# |title=Ariana |publisher=Flyariana.com |date= |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}</ref> There are also limited domestic and international flight services available from the locally owned [[Kam Air]], [[Pamir Airways]] and [[Safi Airways]].

The country has [[Rail transport in Afghanistan|limited rail service]] with Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the north. As of 2011, two other railway projects are in progress with neighboring nations, one is between Herat and Iran while another is to connect with [[Pakistan Railways]]. Citizens who travel far distances use bus services. Newer automobiles have recently become more widely available after the rebuilding of roads and highways. Vehicles are imported from the [[United Arab Emirates]] through Pakistan and Iran. [[Postage stamps and postal history of Afghanistan|Afghanistan's postal]] and package delivery services such as [[FedEx]], [[DHL]] and others are found in major cities and towns.

Telecommunication services in the country are provided by [[Afghan Wireless]], [[Etisalat]], [[Roshan (telco)|Roshan]], [[MTN Group]] and [[Afghan Telecom]]. In 2006, the [[Ministry of Communications (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Communications]] signed a $64.5 million agreement with [[ZTE]] for the establishment of a countrywide [[optical fiber cable]] network.

Afghanistan is a [[multiethnic society]]. The population of the country is divided into a wide variety of [[ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups. Because a systematic census has not been held in the nation in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are unvailable.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3717092.stm Afghan poll's ethnic battleground]  October 6, 2004. BBC</ref> In this regard, the [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] states:{{quote|''No national census has been conducted in Afghanistan since a partial count in 1979, and years of war and population dislocation have made an accurate ethnic count impossible. Current population estimates are therefore rough approximations, which show that Pashtuns comprise somewhat less than two-fifths of the population. The two largest Pashtun tribal groups are the Durrani and Ghilzay. Tajiks are likely to account for some one-fourth of Afghans and Hazara nearly one-fifth. Uzbeks and Chahar Aimaks each account for slightly more than 5 percent of the population and Turkmen an even smaller portion.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |title=(Ethnic groups) |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}</ref>}}

Afghans display pride in their culture, nation, ancestry, and above all, their religion and independence. Like other highlanders, they are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to use force to settle disputes.<ref name="Heathcote">Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) "The Afghan Wars 1839<U+2013>1919", Sellmount Staplehurst.</ref> As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. Tony Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.<ref name="Heathcote" /> There are an estimated 60 major [[Pashtun tribes]],<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445546/Pashtun Pashtun (people)]".

The nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars.<ref>G.V. Brandolini. ''Afghanistan [[cultural heritage]]''. Orizzonte terra, [[Bergamo]]. 2007. p. 64.</ref> The two famous [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as [[idolatry|idolatrous]]. Other historical places include the cities of [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], Ghazni and Balkh. The [[Minaret of Jam]] in the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] valley is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]]. A cloak reputedly worn by Islam's Prophet [[Muhammad]] is stored inside the famous [[Mosque of the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed]] in Kandahar, a city founded by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] and the first capital of Afghanistan. In the city of Herat in the west, the [[citadel]] of Alexander  has been renovated in recent years and is a popular attraction for tourists.

Although literacy level is low, classic [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Pashto literature and poetry|Pashto poetry]] play an important role in the Afghan culture. [[Poetry of Afghanistan|Poetry]] has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Some notable poets include [[Rumi]], [[Rabi'a Balkhi]], [[Sanai]], [[Jami]], [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Khalilullah Khalili]], and [[Parwin Pazhwak]].<ref>[http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/cpoets.html Classical Dari and Pashto Poets]</ref>

The city of Kabul has been home to many musicians in the past, who were masters of both traditional and modern [[Music of Afghanistan|Afghan music]], especially during the [[Nowruz]] (New Year) and [[Afghan Independence Day|National Independence Day]] celebrations. Most Afghans are accustomed to watching [[Bollywood]] films from India and listening to its [[filmi]] hit songs. Several Bollywood films such as [[Dharmatma]], [[Khuda Gawah]], [[Escape from Taliban]] and [[Kabul Express]] have been shot inside Afghanistan.

Afghans are participants in many kinds of [[sport in Afghanistan|sports]], including soccer, cricket, basketball, volleyball, [[taekwondo]], boxing, and bodybuilding. [[Buzkashi]] is a traditional sport, mainly among the northern Afghans. It is similar to [[polo]], played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a goat carcass. [[Afghan hound]]s (a type of running dog) originated in Afghanistan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The [[Media of Afghanistan|Afghan media]] began in the early 20th century, with the first newspaper published in 1906. By the 1920s, [[Radio Kabul]] was broadcasting local radio services.

Education in the country includes [[K<U+2013>12 (education)|K-12]] and Higher, which is supervised by the [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Education]] and [[Ministry of Higher Education (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Higher Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mohe.gov.af/?lang=en&p=home |title=Afghanistan's Ministry of Higher Education |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}</ref> The nation's education system fell apart due to the wars after 1978, but it began reviving after the new [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] came to power in late 2001. More than five million male and female students were enrolled in schools as of 2009. However, there are still significant obstacles to education in Afghanistan, stemming from lack of funding, unsafe school buildings and cultural norms. Furthermore, there is a great lack of qualified teachers, especially in rural areas. A lack of women teachers is another issue that concerns some Afghan parents, especially in more conservative areas. Some parents will not allow their daughters to be taught by men.<ref name="asmp">Mojumdar, Aunohita: "Afghan Schools' Money Problems", BBC News, 2007. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6533379.stm News.BBC.co.uk]</ref> What Afghanistan needs is NATO supported scholarship programs to take massive number of students abroad so that when they return after finishing studies they can move their nation forward and quickly catch up with the rest of the world.

Following the start of the U.S. mission in late 2001, [[Kabul University]] was reopened to both male and female students. In 2006, the [[American University of Afghanistan]] also opened its doors, with the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan. Many other universities were inaugurated across the country in recent years, such as [[Kandahar University]] in the south, [[Herat University]] in the northwest, [[Balkh University]] in the north, [[Nangarhar University]] and [[Khost University]] in the eastern zones, and others. The [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]] has been set up to train and educate Afghan soldiers.

UNICEF estimates that more than 80 percent of females and around 50 percent of males lack access to education centers. According to the UN, 700 schools have been closed in the country because of poor security.<ref name="chicagotribune.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-tc-nw-afghan-schools-0107jan08,0,457737.story |title=ChicagoTirbune.com |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date=November 10, 2010 |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}</ref> Literacy of the entire population is estimated at 34%.

==Crime and law enforcement==

[[File:ANP moving in vehicles in 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Afghan National Police]]]]
The [[National Directorate of Security]] (NDS) is the nation's domestic [[intelligence agency]], which operates similar to that of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) and has between 15,000 to 30,000 employees. The nation also has about 126,000 [[Afghan National Police|national police]] officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 160,000. The [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) is under the [[Ministry of Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Interior]] in Kabul, which is headed by [[Bismillah Khan Mohammadi]]. The [[Afghan National Civil Order Police]] is part of the Afghan National Police, which is divided into five Brigades, each commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, [[Gardez]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Every province of the country has a provincial [[Chief of Police]] who is appointed by the Ministry of Interior and is responsible for [[law enforcement in Afghanistan|law enforcement]] in all the districts within the province. 

Although they are being trained by [[NATO]] countries and through the [[Afghanistan Police Program]], there are still problems with the force. According to a 2009 news report, large percent of Afghan police officers are illiterate and are accused of demanding bribes.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121559123&ps=cprs For U.S., Vast Challenge To Expand Afghan Forces : NPR<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> Jack Kem, deputy to the commander of NATO Training Mission Afghanistan and Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan, stated that the literacy rate in the ANP will reach over 50 percent by January 2012. What began as a voluntary literacy program became mandatory for basic police training in early 2011.<ref name=Pellerindate>{{cite web |url=http://www.defense.gov//news/newsarticle.aspx?id=64044 |title=Afghan Security Forces Grow in Numbers, Quality |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |work=American Forces Press Service |first=Cheryl |last=Pellerindate |date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}</ref> Approximately 17 percent of them test positive for illegal drugs.

The south and eastern parts of Afghanistan are the most dangerous due to their distances from Kabul and their flourishing drug trade. These areas in particular are often patrolled by [[Taliban insurgency|Taliban insurgents]], and in many cases they plan attacks by using suicide bombers and planting [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) on roads. Every year [[list of Afghan security forces fatality reports in Afghanistan|many Afghan police officers are killed]] in the line of duty. The [[Afghan Border Police]] are responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the [[Durand Line]], which is a disputed border often used by criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. Reports in 2011 appeared suggesting that up to 3 million people in Afghanistan are involved in the illegal drug business, many of the attacks on government employees and institutions are carried out not only by the Taliban militants but also by powerful criminal gangs.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110625/ap_on_re_us/us_us_afghanistan_corruption While US talks withdrawal, Afghan corruption soars], by Bradley Klapper, Associated Press. June 2011.</ref> Drugs from Afghanistan are exported to Iran, Pakistan, Russia, India, the United Arab Emirate, and the European Union. The [[Ministry of Counter Narcotics (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics]] which is supported by the international community is dealing with this problem.

|valign="top"|The [[Government of India]] also considers Afghanistan to be a bordering country. This is because it considers the entire state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to be a part of India including the portion bordering Afghanistan. A ceasefire sponsored by the UN in 1948 froze the positions of Indian and Pakistani-held territory. As a consequence, the region bordering Afghanistan is in [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]].
