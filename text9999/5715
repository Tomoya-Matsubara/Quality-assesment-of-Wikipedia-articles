"'''Sparks Fly'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her third studio album ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010). It was written and produced by Swift, with additional production helmed by [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. Swift wrote the song when she was sixteen years old, prior to the release of her debut single "[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]" in 2006. Following a 2007 live performance of the song, "Sparks Fly" grew in popularity among Swift's fanbase. While ''Speak Now'' was under production, she received requests from fans to include the song on the album. The song was serviced to country radio in the United States by [[Big Machine Records]] on July 18, 2011, as the fifth single from ''Speak Now''. A [[Compact disc single|CD single]] was released on Swift's official store for a limited time on August 10, 2011.

"Sparks Fly" received generally positive reviews by [[music journalism|music critics]], who praised it for its upbeat tempo. Others praised Swift's lyrics of the song and have claimed that the song is a [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] between country and pop. Following the release of ''Speak Now'', the song debuted at number seventeen on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and at number twenty-eight on the [[Canadian Hot 100]], due to strong digital sales. After the song was released as a single, it re-entered the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 at eighty-four. It peaked at number one at the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart and was certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of 500,000 copies. "Sparks Fly" was used as the opening song for the [[Speak Now World Tour]] (2011<U+2013>12). A music video for the song was released, featuring clips of various performances during the Speak Now World Tour.

According to Swift, the song is about "falling for someone who you maybe shouldn't fall for, but you can't stop yourself because there's such a connection and chemistry."<ref name="taste" />

== Critical reception ==
"Sparks Fly" generally received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised Swift's vocals on "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice in such an upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/speak-now-20101026|title=Taylor Swift Speak Now Big Machine|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 26, 2010|publisher=[[Wenner Media]]|accessdate=October 26, 2010}}</ref> Rahul Prabhakar of ''[[The Oxonian Review]]'' considers it "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/taylor-swift-needs-a-gap-year/ |title=Taylor Swift Needs a Gap Year |work=Rahul Prabhakar |date=November 1, 2010|publisher=[[The Oxonian Review]]|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}</ref> Jonathan Keefe of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' calls the song "the purest iteration of Swift<U+2019>s template and repertoire", also saying that it "could turn things around for Swift, as it<U+2019>s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." He concluded by stating that the song "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase can be in the right context. To that end, <U+201C>Sparks Fly<U+201D> plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and it<U+2019>s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right."<ref name="Keefe" /> Bobby Peacock of ''Roughstock'' claims that he gets "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little  burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the ''Billboard'' charts. While I don't think this song has that ''je ne sais quoi'' to get her another '[[You Belong with Me]]'-level  hit, I still think that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen."<ref name="Peakcock" /> Blake Boldt of ''Engine 145'' praised Swift, saying "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (<U+201C>Drop everything now,<U+201D> she insists) and earnestness (<U+201C>Take away the pain,<U+201D> she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, not so much as a distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, {{sic|wiling}} away the hours before he calls her again."<ref name="boldt" /> Amanda Hensel of ''Taste of Country'' claimed the song is "just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift."<ref name="taste" /> Erin Thompson of ''Seattle Weekly'' stated he wasn't to "hot on" the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, "[[Fearless (Taylor Swift song)|Fearless]]", "Hey Stephen", and "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning to think she watches ''[[The Notebook (film)|The Notebook]]'' every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/2011/11/taylor_swifts_speak_now_track.php|title=Taylor Swift's Speak Now Track "If This Was A Movie" Is Better Than Her Upcoming New Single|work=Erin Thompson|date=November 25, 2011|publisher=Seattle Weekly|accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref> Mikael Wood of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, "Long Live".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.kr/books?id=J7EuavrzL9kC&pg=PA80&dq=Taylor+Swift+Sparks+Fly&hl=ko&sa=X&ei=K1zJT5DbJpLh0wHdosyIAQ&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Taylor%20Swift%20Sparks%20Fly&f=false |title=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |publisher=Spin Media LLC|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref>
