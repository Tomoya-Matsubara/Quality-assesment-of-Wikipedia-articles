'''Slovenia''' chose its entry for the '''Eurovision Song Contest 2006''' on 29 January in their selection, EMA 2006, when 14 songs competed for the votes of the public and a panel of experts. The three voting groups would determine the winner. EMA veteran [[Sa<U+0161>a Lendero]] and her ethnic dance song "Mandoline", won both the televoting and SMS votes while in the end, the jury decided the outcome and [[An<U+017E>ej De<U+017E>an]] with the song ''Plan B'' won the competition, causing much controversy. More dispute was caused when accusations were made that the song was a copy of a song called ''Santa Maria'' sung by [[Austria]]n singer Simone, therefore breaking the contest rules. The [[European Broadcasting Union]], however, did not see it as a copy, and therefore the song was not disqualified. The song is written by Ur<U+0161>a Vla<U+0161>i<U+010D> and composed by Matja<U+017E> Vla<U+0161>i<U+010D>. 

The song, performed in [[English language|English]] in Athens as "Mr Nobody", did not come in the top 10 in the semi-final, finishing 16th with 49 points, therefore not qualifying for the final.

18 year old An<U+017E>ej De<U+017E>an born on the 17 June 1987 in Celje, will be one of the youngest performers in Athens. He was a newcomer to this year EMA, but has past experience by providing the backing vocals to Slovenian superstar [[Nu<U+0161>a Derenda]]'s song in 2005. He originally came to fame on 'Bitka talentov,' the same talent show which discovered Slovenia's 2005 Eurovision singer Omar Naber. An<U+017E>ej has already recorded a duet with EMA runner-up Sa<U+0161>a Lendero. An<U+017E>ej is a very style conscious young man, and goes through more image and hairstyle changes in a couple of years, than most people manage in a lifetime.
