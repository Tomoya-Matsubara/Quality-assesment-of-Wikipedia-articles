'''Television''' ('''TV''') is a [[telecommunication]] [[mass-media|medium]] for transmitting and receiving moving images that can be [[monochrome]] ([[black-and-white]]) or colored, with or without accompanying sound. "Television" may also refer specifically to a [[television set]], [[television program]]ming, or [[Transmission (telecommunications)|television transmission]].

The etymology of the word has a mixed Latin and Greek origin, meaning "far sight": Greek ''tele'' ({{lang|grc|{{Unicode|<U+03C4><U+1FC6><U+03BB><U+03B5>}}}}), far, and Latin ''visio'', sight (from ''video, vis-'' to see, or to view in the first person).

[[History of television#Television sets|Commercially available since the late 1920s]], the television set has become commonplace in homes, businesses and institutions, particularly as a vehicle for [[advertising]], a source of entertainment, and [[news]]. Since the 1950s, television has been the main medium for molding [[public opinion]].<ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"/> Since the 1970s the availability of [[video cassettes]], [[laserdisc]]s, [[DVD-Video|DVDs]] and now [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, have resulted in the television set frequently being used for viewing recorded as well as broadcast material. In recent years [[Internet television]] has seen the rise of television available via the [[Internet]], e.g. [[iPlayer]] and [[Hulu]].

Although other forms such as [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) are in use, the most common usage of the medium is for [[broadcast television]], which was modeled on the existing [[radio broadcasting]] systems developed in the 1920s, and uses high-powered [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] transmitters to [[broadcasting|broadcast]] the television signal to individual TV receivers.

The [[broadcast television system]] is typically disseminated via [[radio]] transmissions on designated channels in the 54<U+2013>890 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[band (radio)|frequency band]].<ref>[http://www.csgnetwork.com/tvfreqtable.html ''Television Frequency Table''], CSGNetwork.com., a Division of Computer Support Group.</ref> Signals are now often transmitted with [[stereo]] or [[surround sound]] in many countries. Until the 2000s broadcast TV programs were generally transmitted as an [[analog television]] signal, but in 2008 the USA went almost exclusively digital.

A standard [[television set]] comprises multiple internal [[electronic circuit]]s, including those for [[Tuner (electronics)|receiving]] and decoding broadcast signals. A visual [[display device]] which lacks a [[tuner (television)|tuner]] is properly called a [[video monitor]], rather than a television. A television system may use different technical standards such as [[digital television]] (DTV) and [[high-definition television]] (HDTV). Television systems are also used for surveillance, industrial process control, and guiding of weapons, in places where direct observation is difficult or dangerous. Some studies have found a link between infancy exposure to television and ADHD.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/04/040406090140.htm Study Finds Link Between Television Viewing And Attention Problems In Children] retrieved 19 July 2012</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of television}}

In its early stages of development, television employed a combination of [[optics|optical]], mechanical and [[electronics|electronic]] technologies to capture, transmit and display a visual image. By the late 1920s, however, those employing only optical and electronic technologies were being explored. All modern television systems relied on the latter, although the knowledge gained from the work on electromechanical systems was crucial in the development of fully electronic television.

[[Image:Braun HF 1.jpg|thumb|right| [[Braun (company)|Braun HF 1]] television receiver, Germany, 1958]]

The first images transmitted electrically were sent by early mechanical [[Fax#History|fax]] machines, including the [[pantelegraph]], developed in the late nineteenth century. The concept of electrically powered transmission of television images in motion was first sketched in 1878 as the [[telephonoscope]], shortly after the invention of the telephone. At the time, it was imagined by early science fiction authors, that someday that light could be transmitted over copper wires, as sounds were.

The idea of using [[Image scanner|scanning]] to transmit images was put to actual practical use in 1881 in the pantelegraph, through the use of a [[pendulum]]-based scanning mechanism. From this period forward, scanning in one form or another has been used in nearly every image transmission technology to date, including television. This is the concept of "[[rasterization]]", the process of converting a visual image into a stream of electrical pulses.

In 1884 [[Paul Gottlieb Nipkow]], a 23-year-old university student in Germany <ref> http://www.bairdtelevision.com/nipkow.html </ref>, patented the first electromechanical television system which employed a [[Nipkow disk|scanning disk]], a spinning disk with a series of holes spiraling toward the center, for rasterization. The holes were spaced at equal [[angle|angular]] intervals such that in a single rotation the disk would allow light to pass through each hole and onto a light-sensitive [[selenium]] sensor which produced the electrical pulses. As an image was focused on the rotating disk, each hole captured a horizontal "slice" of the whole image. <ref> http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/baird_nipkow_television.html </ref>

Nipkow's design would not be practical until advances in [[amplifier]] [[vacuum tube|tube]] technology became available. The device was only useful for transmitting still "[[halftone]]" images<U+2014>represented by equally spaced dots of varying size<U+2014>over [[telegraph]] or [[telephone line]]s. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Later designs would use a rotating mirror-drum scanner to capture the image and a [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) as a display device, but moving images were still not possible, due to the poor sensitivity of the [[selenium]] sensors. In 1907 Russian scientist [[Boris Rosing]] became the first inventor to use a CRT in the receiver of an experimental television system. He used mirror-drum scanning to transmit simple geometric shapes to the CRT.<ref name='crthistory'>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/CathodeRayTube.htm |title=History of the Cathode Ray Tube |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=About.com }}</ref>
[[Image:Zworykin kinescope 1929.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Vladimir Zworykin]] demonstrates electronic television (1929).]]
Using a Nipkow disk, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] succeeded in demonstrating the transmission of moving silhouette images in [[London]] in 1925,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/World-TV-Standards/index.html#Timeline|title=World Analogue Television Standards and Waveforms <U+2013> section <U+2013> Timeline|publisher=Histrorical television data 2011|accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref> and of moving, [[monochrome|monochromatic]] images in 1926. Baird's scanning disk produced an image of 30 lines resolution, just enough to discern a human face, from a double spiral of [[Photographic lens|lense]]s.<ref>R. W. Burns, ''John Logie Baird: television pioneer'', IET, 2000
ISBN 0-85296-797-7 pp. 73, 88</ref> This demonstration by Baird is generally agreed to be the world's first true demonstration of television, albeit a mechanical form of television no longer in use. Remarkably, in 1927 Baird also invented the world's first [[video recording]] system, "[[Phonovision]]": by modulating the output signal of his [[Professional video camera|TV camera]] down to the audio range, he was able to capture the signal on a 10-inch wax audio disc using conventional audio recording technology. A handful of Baird's 'Phonovision' recordings survive and these were finally decoded and rendered into viewable images in the 1990s using modern digital signal-processing technology.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mr ali283280 says: |url=http://www.tvdawn.com/ |title=World's First TV Recordings |publisher=Tvdawn.com |date=8 October 2009 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>

In 1926, Hungarian engineer [[K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n Tihanyi]] designed a television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements, and employing the principle of "charge storage" within the scanning (or "camera") tube.<ref>{{cite web | title = Hungary <U+2013> [[K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n Tihanyi|K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n Tihanyi's]] 1926 Patent Application 'Radioskop' | work = Memory of the World | publisher = [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] | url = http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23240&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html| accessdate =22 February 2008}}</ref><ref name=US2133123>United States Patent Office, Patent No. 2,133,123, Oct. 11, 1938.</ref><ref name=US2158259>United States Patent Office, Patent No. 2,158,259, May 16, 1939</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/zworykin.html |title=Vladimir Kosma Zworykin, 1889<U+2013>1982 |publisher=Bairdtelevision.com |date= |accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref>

On December 25, 1926, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. <ref>[http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/ ''Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television''], NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), 2002, retrieved 2009-05-23.</ref> This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver. Takayanagi did not apply for a patent.<ref>[http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Development_of_Electronic_Television,_1924-1941 Milestones Development of Electronic Television, 1924-1941 - GHN  IEEE Global History Network.htm]</ref>

By 1927, Russian inventor [[L<U+00E9>on Theremin]] developed a mirror-drum-based television system which used [[interlacing]] to achieve an [[image resolution]] of 100 lines.<ref>Glinsky, Albert. ''Theremin: ether music and espionage''. University of Illinois Press, 2000. pg. 46.</ref>

Also in 1927, [[Herbert E. Ives]] of [[Bell Labs]] transmitted moving images from a 50-aperture disk producing 16 frames per minute over a cable from Washington, DC to New York City, and via radio from [[Whippany, New Jersey]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Ives used viewing screens as large as 24 by 30&nbsp;inches (60 by 75&nbsp;cm). His subjects included [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
[[File:Philo T Farnsworth.jpg|thumb|150px|Philo Farnsworth]]
In 1927, [[Philo Farnsworth]] made the world's first working television system with electronic scanning of both the pickup and display devices,<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/philo.html "Philo Taylor Farnsworth (1906<U+2013>71)"], ''The Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco''</ref> which he first demonstrated to the press on 1 September 1928.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name="EGF_DV">Farnsworth, Elma G., ''Distant Vision: Romance and Discovery on an Invisible Frontier'', Salt Lake City, PemberlyKent, 1989, p. 108.</ref>

[[WRGB]] claims to be the world's oldest [[television station]], tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on January 13, 1928, broadcasting from the [[General Electric]] factory in [[Schenectady, NY]], under the call letters W2XB.<ref> [http://books.google.com/books?id=iuIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA177&dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=F1pgTsXYNInUgQfhoo2PAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&sqi=2&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=true "The First Television Show" ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1930, pp. 177-179]</ref> It was popularly known as "WGY Television" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, [[General Electric]] started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]], and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll, rotating on a turntable, was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years, as new technology was being tested by the engineers.

In 1936 the [[Olympic Games]] in Berlin were carried by cable to television stations in Berlin and Leipzig where the public could view the games live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv |title=TV History |publisher=Gadgetrepublic |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref>

In 1935 the German firm of [[Fernseh|Fernseh A.G.]] and the United States firm Farnsworth Television owned by [[Philo Farnsworth]] signed an agreement to exchange their television patents and technology to speed development of television transmitters and stations in their respective countries.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=td4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24&dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=keosTr74FKLDsQLpvbGKCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&sqi=2&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=true "Exchange of Patients Speed Home Television" ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1935 pp.24-25]</ref>

On 2 November 1936 the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.<ref>http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm Teletronic <U+2013> The Television History Site</ref> It therefore claims to be the birthplace of television broadcasting as we know it today.

In 1936, [[K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n Tihanyi]] described the principle of [[plasma display]], the first [[flat panel display]] system.<ref>http://ewh.ieee.org/r2/johnstown/downloads/20090217_IEEE_JST_Trivia_Answers.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.scitech.mtesz.hu/52tihanyi/flat-panel_tv_en.pdf</ref>

Mexican inventor [[Guillermo Gonz<U+00E1>lez Camarena]] also played an important role in early television. His experiments with television (known as telectroescop<U+00ED>a at first) began in 1931 and led to a patent for the "trichromatic field sequential system" [[color television]] in 1940,<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=sQBkAAAAEBAJ&dq=2296019  Patent 2296019 Chromoscopic Adapter for Television Adapter. Google patents]</ref> as well as the remote control.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Although television became more familiar in the United States with the general public at the [[1939 World's Fair]], the outbreak of [[World War II]] prevented it from being manufactured on a large scale until after the end of the war. True regular commercial [[television network]] programming did not begin in the U.S. until 1948. During that year, legendary conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] made his first of ten TV appearances conducting the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], and ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'', starring comedian [[Milton Berle]], became television's first gigantic hit show.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Since the 1950s, television has been the main medium for molding [[public opinion]].<ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53">Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [http://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48</ref>

[[Amateur television]] (''ham TV'' or ''ATV'') was developed for [[non-commercial]] experimentation, pleasure and public service events by [[amateur radio]] operators. Ham TV stations were on the air in many cities before commercial TV stations came on the air.<ref>[http://www.earlytelevision.org/1940_home_camera.html Kowalewski, Anthony, "An Amateur's Television Transmitter"], ''Radio News'', April 1938.

In 2012, it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies' revenues than film.<ref name=wrap120606>{{cite news | url = http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/why-television-trouncing-film-major-media-companies-42751 | title = Why Television Is Trouncing Film at Major Media Companies | first = Brent | last = Lang | work = TheWrap.com | date = June 06, 2012 }}</ref>

===Programming===
{{See also|Television program|Category:Television genres}}
Getting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways. After production the next step is to market and deliver the product to whatever markets are open to using it. This typically happens on two levels:

#'''Original Run''' or '''First Run''': a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or [[television network|network]] which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the [[television producer]]s to do the same.
#'''[[Broadcast syndication]]''': this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run). It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer. In many cases other companies, [[TV stations]] or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work, in other words to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders, in most cases the producers.

First run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the U.S., but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic [[free-to-air]] (FTA) elsewhere. This practice is increasing however, generally on digital-only FTA channels, or with subscriber-only  first-run material appearing on FTA.

Unlike the U.S., repeat FTA screenings of a FTA network program almost only occur on that network. Also, [[affiliate]]s rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centred around [[local programming]].

Around the globe, broadcast television is financed by either government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription or any combination of these. To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscription payers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as '''free to air''' or '''FTA'''.

In 2009 the global TV market represented 1,217.2 million TV households with at least one television, and total revenues of 268.9 billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008).<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html Global TV 2010 <U+2013> Markets, Trends Facts & Figures (2008<U+2013>2013)] International Television Expert Group</ref> North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39%, followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%) and Africa and the Middle East (2%).<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/global-tv-revenues-2008-2009.html Global TV Revenues (2008<U+2013>09)] International Television Expert Group</ref>

Globally, the different TV revenue sources divide into 45 to 50% TV advertising revenues, 40 to 45% subscription fees and 10% public funding.<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html iDate's Global TV Revenue Market Shares] International Television Expert Group</ref><ref>[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/international_television_market_report_2009.html OFCOM's Global TV Market Report 2009] International Television Expert Group</ref>

====Advertising====
Television's broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. Many television networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers ("sponsors") in order to fund their programming.<ref name="Hornick">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml Karen Hornick] "That Was the Year That Was" ''American Heritage'', Oct. 2006.</ref>

=====United States=====
Since inception in the U.S. in 1941 <ref> http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html </ref>,  [[television commercial]]s have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. During the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. This, in turn, gave great creative license to the [[advertiser]]s over the content of the show. Perhaps due to the [[quiz show scandals]] in the 1950s <ref> http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande07.html </ref>, networks shifted to the magazine concept introducing [[advertising]] breaks with multiple advertisers.

U.S. advertising rates are determined primarily by [[Nielsen ratings]]. The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a television commercial can cost. For example, the highly popular [[American Idol]] can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time; while the same amount of time for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and the [[Super Bowl]] can cost several million dollars. Conversely, lesser-viewed [[time slot]]s, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of [[infomercials]] which is less expensive.

In recent years, the paid program or [[infomercial]] has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. Some [[Pharmaceutical company|drug companies]] and other businesses have even created "news" items for broadcast, known in the industry as [[video news release]]s, paying [[program director]]s to use them.<ref>[[Jon Stewart]] of "[[The Daily Show]]" was mock-outraged at this, saying, "That's what we do!", and calling it a new form of television, "infoganda".</ref>

Some TV programs also weave advertisements into their shows, a practice begun in film {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} and known as [[product placement]]. For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular [[Restaurant chain|chain restaurant]], or driving a certain make of car. (This is sometimes very subtle, where shows have vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost, rather than wrangling them.) Sometimes a specific brand or [[Trademark|trade mark]], or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (This excludes guest appearances by artists, who perform on the show.)

=====United Kingdom=====
The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]], likened the broadcasting licence as being a "licence to print money".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&sectioncode=1 |title=Kenneth Roy Thomson |publisher=Press Gazette |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: [[ITV]], [[Channel 4]], and [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural breaks where the UK company has edited out the breaks intended for US advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs program, documentaries, and programs for children. Nor may advertisements be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any [[religious broadcasting]] service or other devotional program, or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements.

The [[BBC]], being strictly [[non-commercial]] is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from [[television license]] fees (see below) and [[broadcast syndication]], the sale of content to other broadcasters.

=====Ireland=====
The [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]] ('''BCI''') ({{lang-ga|Coimisi<U+00FA>n Craolach<U+00E1>in na h<U+00C9>ireann}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.ie/ |title=BCI :: Introduction to the BCI |publisher=Bci.ie |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> oversees advertising on television and radio within Ireland on both private and state owned broadcasters. Similar to other European countries, advertising is found on both private and state owned broadcasters. There are some restrictions based on advertising, especially in relation to the advertising of alcohol. Such advertisements are prohibited until after 7pm. Broadcasters in Ireland adhere to broadcasting legislation implemented by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the [[European Union]]. [[Sponsor (commercial)|Sponsor]]ship of current affairs programming is prohibited at all times.

As of October 1, 2009 the responsibilities held by the BCI are gradually being transferred to the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]].

====Taxation or license====
Television services in some countries may be funded by a [[television licence]] or a form of taxation which means advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. For example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:
* Australia ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]])
* Japan ([[NHK]])
* Norway ([[NRK]])
* Sweden ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]])
* United Kingdom ([[BBC]])
* United States ([[PBS]])
* Denmark ([[Danmarks Radio|DR]])
The [[BBC]] carries no [[television advertising]] on its UK channels and is funded by an annual [[television license]] paid by all households owning a television. This television license fee is set by government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by government.

The two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90 percent of the population each week and overall have 27 per cent share of total viewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&requesttimeout=500&flag=viewingsummary |title=viewing statistics in UK |publisher=Barb.co.uk |date= |accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref>  This in spite of the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |title=The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report <U+2013> Digital TV, Q3 2007 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 June 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625013029/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}</ref> The licence that funds the seven advertising-free BBC TV channels currently costs <U+00A3>139.50 a year (about US$215) irrespective of the number of TV sets owned. When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels, the BBC always attracts the lion's share of the [[audience]], indicating viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising.

The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) carries no advertising (except for internal promotional material) as it is banned under the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/all/search/8B104AA963F8AB9FCA25718D002260DC ABC Act 1983]. The ABC receives its funding from the Australian Government every three years. In the 2008/09 Federal Budget the ABC received A$1.13 Billion.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/documents/budget2008-09.pdf ]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>  The funds assist in providing the ABC's Television, Radio, Online and International outputs. The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC Shops across Australia. However funded by the Australian Government the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law.

In France and Ireland government-funded channels carry advertisements yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax ("la redevance audiovisuelle").<ref>[http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html Ministry of Finance]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>

In Japan, [[NHK]] is paid for by license fees (known in Japanese as {{nihongo|'''reception fee'''|<U+53D7><U+4FE1><U+6599>|Jushinry<U+014D>}}). The Broadcast Law which governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture.

====Subscription====
Some TV channels are partly funded from [[subscription]]s therefore the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch [[pay television]] or [[specialty channel]]s. Most subscription services are also funded by [[advertising]].

===Genres===
Television [[List_of_genres#TV_genres|genre]]s include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually drama and dramatic [[miniseries]]. However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs.

[[Popular culture]] entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows. As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as [[medical drama]]s and daytime [[soap opera]]s. [[Science fiction]] shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure. Comedy is a popular genre which includes [[situation comedy]] (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as ''[[South Park]]''.

The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are [[game show]]s, [[talk show]]s, [[variety show]]s, and [[Reality television]]. Game shows show contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows feature interviews with film, television and music celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers such as comedians and magicians introduced by a host or [[Master of Ceremonies]]. There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows, because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments.
''Reality TV'' shows "regular" people (''i.e.'', not [[actors]]) who are facing unusual challenges or experiences, ranging from arrest by police officers (''[[COPS (TV series)|COPS]]'') to weight loss (''[[The Biggest Loser]]''). A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (''[[The Osbournes]]'', ''[[Snoop Dogg's Father Hood]]'') or doing manual labor (''[[The Simple Life]]'').

==Social aspects and effects on children==
{{Main|Social aspects of television}}
Television has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including [[media violence research]]. In 2010 the [[iPlayer]] incorporated a [[social media]] aspect to its [[internet television]] service, including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].<ref>[http://www.onlinesocialmedia.net/20100909/new-bbc-iplayer-integration-with-facebook-and-twitter/ New BBC iPlayer: Integration with Facebook and Twitter]</ref>

==Environmental aspects==
With high [[lead]] content in [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]], and the rapid diffusion of new, flat-panel display technologies, some of which ([[LCD]]s) use lamps which contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], there is growing concern about [[electronic waste]] from discarded televisions. Related [[occupational health]] concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing [[copper]] wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing [[electrical energy]] requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/uploads/documents/aboutest/Riseofthemachines.pdf |publisher=Energy Saving Trust |title=The Rise of the Machines: A Review of Energy Using Products in the Home from the 1970s to Today |date=July 3, 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=31 August 2007}}</ref>
