'''Pirah<U+00E3>''' (also '''Pirah<U+00E1>''', '''Pirah<U+00E1>n''') is a [[language]] spoken by the [[Pirah<U+00E3> people|Pirah<U+00E3>]] &mdash; an indigenous people of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], [[Brazil]], who live along the [[Maici river]], a tributary of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]].

Pirah<U+00E3> is believed to be the only surviving member of the [[Muran languages|Mura]] language family, all other members having become extinct in the last few centuries. It is therefore a [[language isolate]], without any known connection to other living languages. Despite having only approximately 150 speakers as of 2004, in eight villages along the Maici, it is not itself in immediate danger of extinction, as language use is vigorous and the Pirah<U+00E3> community is monolingual. 

The Pirah<U+00E3> language has a number of linguistic features that are claimed by some linguists to be unusual, though others have argued that they are found in other languages as well. The most significant source for Information about the grammar of Piraha is Everett (1986) and more than two dozen additional articles by the same author.

== Linguistic features ==
Noteworthy features of Pirah<U+00E3> are alleged to include:

* One of the smallest [[phoneme]] inventories of any known language (perhaps surpassed only by [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]]), and a correspondingly high degree of [[allophone|allophonic]] variation, including two very rare sounds, {{IPA|[<U+027A><U+0361><U+027A><U+033C>]}} and {{IPA|[t<U+0361><U+0299><U+0325>]}}.
* The pronunciation of several phonemes depends on the speaker's sex. Female speakers use seven consonants and three vowels, while male speakers have one consonant more at their disposal.
* An extremely limited [[clause]] structure.
* Limitation of [[numeral]]s to "one" or "two" (though in recent work Everett has claimed that Pirah<U+00E3> lacks even these numerals); the closest are general quantity words like "many".
* No abstract [[color]] words other than terms for light and dark (though this is disputed in commentaries by [[Paul Kay]] and others on Everett (2005)).
* Few specific [[Kinship and descent|kin terms]]; one word covers both "father" and "mother". 
* The entire set of personal pronouns appears to have been borrowed from [[Nheengatu]], a [[Tupi language|Tupi]]-based [[lingua franca]]. Although there is no documentation of a prior stage of Pirah<U+00E3>, the close resemblance of the Pirah<U+00E3> pronouns to those of [[Nheengatu]] makes this hypothesis plausible.
* Pirah<U+00E3> can be [[whistled language|whistled]], hummed, or encoded in [[music]]. 

However, some of these claims are controversial.

== Phonology ==
The Pirah<U+00E3> language is one of the [[phonology|phonologically]] simplest languages known, claimed to have as few as ten [[phonemes]] (one fewer than [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]]). However, this requires analysing [k] as an [[underlying representation|underlying]] /hi/. If this analysis is not accepted, then Pirah<U+00E3> women have ten phonemes, but Pirah<U+00E3> men have eleven, equal to Rotokas and [[Hawaiian (language)|Hawaiian]]. ([[Ian Maddieson]] has found in researching Pirah<U+00E3> data that /k/ indeed has an unusual distribution).

The 'ten phoneme' claim also does not consider the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s of Pirah<U+00E3>, at least two of which are phonemic (marked by an [[acute accent]] and either unmarked or marked by a [[grave accent]]).  Sheldon (1988) claims three tones, high (<U+00B9>), mid (<U+00B2>) and low (<U+00B3>). In Everett's work only two tones are recognized. 

=== Phoneme inventory ===
When languages have inventories as small and [[allophonic]] variation as great as in Pirah<U+00E3> and Rotokas, different linguists may have very different ideas as to the nature of their phonological systems.

The number of phonemes is thirteen if {{IPA|[k]}} is counted as a phoneme and there are just two tones; if {{IPA|[k]}} is not phonemic, there are twelve phonemes, one more than the number found in Rotokas. (English, by comparison, has about thirty to forty-five, depending on [[dialect]]). However, many of these sounds show a great deal of [[allophone|allophonic]] variation. For instance, vowels are nasalized after the glottal consonants {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/<U+0294>/}} (written ''h'' and ''x''). Also,

*{{IPA|/b/}} {{IPA|[b, <U+0299>, m]}}: the nasal {{IPA|[m]}} after a pause, the trill {{IPA|[<U+0299>]}} before {{IPA|/o/}}.

*{{IPA|/g/}} {{IPA|[g, n, <U+027A><U+0361><U+027A><U+033C>]}}: the nasal [n] after a pause (an [[apical consonant|apical alveolar nasal]]); {{IPA|[<U+027A><U+0361><U+027A><U+033C>]}} is a lateral alveolar-linguolabial double flap that has only been reported for this language, where the tongue strikes the upper gum ridge and then strikes the lower lip. However, it is only used in certain special types of speech performances, and so might not be considered a normal speech sound. 

*{{IPA|/s/}} {{IPA|[s, h]}}: in women's speech, {{IPA|/s/}} occurs as {{IPA|[h]}} before {{IPA|[i]}}, and "sometimes" elsewhere. 

*{{IPA|/k/}} {{IPA|[k, p, h, <U+0294>]}}: in men's speech, word-initial {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[<U+0294>]}} are interchangeable. For many people, {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[p]}} may be exchanged in some words. The sequences {{IPA|[hoa]}} and {{IPA|[hia]}} are said to be in [[free variation]] with {{IPA|[k<U+02B7>a]}} and {{IPA|[ka]}}, at least in some words. 

Because of its variation, Everett states that {{IPA|/k/}} is not a stable phoneme. By analysing it as {{IPA|/hi/}}, he is able to theoretically reduce the number of consonants to seven. 

Because of the consonant chart above, Pirah<U+00E3> is sometimes said to be one of the few languages without [[nasal]]s. However, an alternate analysis is possible. By analysing the {{IPA|[g]}} as {{IPA|/n/}} and the {{IPA|[k]}} as {{IPA|/hi/}}, it could also be claimed to be one of the very few languages without [[velar]]s:{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===The bilabial trill===

In 2004, linguist D. L. Everett discovered that the language uses a [[voiceless dental bilabially trilled affricate]], {{IPA|[t<U+0361><U+0299><U+0325>]}}.  He conjectures that the Pirah<U+00E3> had not used that phone in his presence before because they were ridiculed whenever non-Pirah<U+00E3> heard the sound. The occurrence of {{IPA|[t<U+0361><U+0299><U+0325>]}} in Pirah<U+00E3> is all the more remarkable considering that the only other languages known to use it are the unrelated [[Chapacura-Wanham languages]] [[Oro Win language|Oro Win]] and [[Wari<U+2019> language|Wari<U+2019>]], spoken some 500 km west of the Pirah<U+00E3> area. Oro Win too is a nearly extinct language (surviving only as the second language of a dozen or so members of the [[Wari<U+2019>]] tribe) which was discovered by Everett in 1994.<ref>[http://www.pitt.edu/utimes/issues/27/101394/16.html University Times VOLUME 27 NUMBER 4 OCTOBER 13, 1994]</ref>

==Lexicon==

Pirah<U+00E3> has a few loan words, mainly from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Pirah<U+00E3> "k<U+00F3><U+00F3>po" ("cup") is from the Portuguese word "copo", and "bikagogia" ("business") comes from Portuguese "mercadoria" ("merchandise").

=== Kinship terms ===
The Pirah<U+00E3> culture has the simplest known [[kinship]] system of any human culture. A single word, ''ba<U+00ED>xi'' (pronounced {{IPA|[m<U+00E0><U+00ED><U+0294><U+00EC>]}}), is used for both ''mother'' and ''father'', and they appear not to keep track of relationships any more distant than biological [[sibling]]s.

=== Numerals ===
According to Everett (1986), Pirah<U+00E3> has word for 'one' and 'two', but more recently he has claimed that Piraha has no words for [[numerals]] at all.  There are apparently only three words that roughly describe [[quantity]], somewhat akin to "a few", "some", and "many." There is no grammatical distinction between [[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]], even in pronouns (see below). 

=== Color terms ===
There is also a claim that Pirah<U+00E3> lacks any [[color]] terminology, being one of the few cultures (mostly in the Amazon basin and New Guinea) that only have specific words for ''light'' and ''dark''.<ref>[http://ling.man.ac.uk/Info/staff/DE/culturalgrammar.pdf Linguistics and English Language]</ref>  Although the Pirah<U+00E3> glossary in D. L. Everett's Ph. D. thesis includes a list of colors words (page 346), Everett (2006) now claims that the items listed in this glossary are not in fact words but descriptive phrases, based on his subsequent additional twenty years of field research.

== Syntax ==
===Pronouns===
The basic Pirah<U+00E3> personal [[pronoun]]s are ''ti'' "I", ''g<U+00ED>xai'' {{IPA|[n<U+00ED><U+0294><U+00E0><U+00EC>]}} "you (singular)", ''hi'' "s/he, they". These can be serially combined: ''ti g<U+00ED>xai'' or ''ti hi'' to mean "we" ([[inclusive we|inclusive]] and [[exclusive we|exclusive]]), and ''g<U+00ED>xai hi'' to mean "you (plural)". There are several other pronouns reported, such as 'she', 'it' (animal), 'it' (aquatic animal), and 'it' (inanimate), but these may actually be nouns. The fact that different linguists come up with different lists of such pronouns suggests that they are not basic to the grammar. In two recent papers, Everett cites Sheldon as agreeing with his (Everett<U+00B4>s) analysis of the pronouns.

Sheldon (1988) gives the following list of pronouns:
:''ti<U+00B3>'' "I"
:''gi<U+00B9>xai<U+00B3>'' "you" (sing.)
:''hi<U+00B3>'' "he" (human)
:''i<U+00B3>'' "she" (human)
:''i<U+00B9>k'' "it", "they" (animated non-human non-aquatic)
:''si<U+00B3>'' "it", "they" (animated non-human aquatic)
:''a<U+00B3>'' "it", "they" (non-animated)
:''ti<U+00B3>a<U+00B9>ti<U+00B3>so<U+00B3>'' "we"
:''gi<U+00B9>xa<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>ti<U+00B3>so<U+00B3>'' "you" (pl.)
:''hi<U+00B3>ai<U+00B9>ti<U+00B3>so<U+00B3>'' "they" (human?)

Pronouns are prefixed to the verb, in the order SUBJECT-INDOBJECT-OBJECT where INDOBJECT includes a preposition "to", "for", etc. They may all be omitted.<!--Not clear how they are identified when less than three are present--> E.g. ''hi<U+00B3>-ti<U+00B3>-gi<U+00B9>xai<U+00B3>-bi<U+00B2>i<U+00B3>b-i<U+00B3>ha<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>'' "he will send you to me".

For possession, a pronoun is used: 

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''pait<U+00E1>''||''hi''||''xit<U+00F3>hoi''
|-
| ||Paita||s/he||testicles
|}
:"Paita's testicles"

===Verbs===
Pirah<U+00E3> is [[agglutinative]], using a large number of affixes to communicate grammatical meaning. Even the 'to be' verbs of existence or equivalence are suffixes in Pirah<U+00E3>. For instance, the Pirah<U+00E3> sentence "there is a [[paca]] there" uses just two words; the "is" is a suffix on "paca": 

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''k<U+00E1>ixih<U+00ED>xao-xaag<U+00E1>''||''g<U+00E1>ih<U+00ED>''
|-
| ||paca-exists||there
|}
:"There's a paca there"

Pirah<U+00E3> also uses suffixes which communicate [[evidentiality]], a category which English grammar lacks. One such suffix, ''-x<U+00E1>agah<U+00E1>'', means that the speaker actually observed the event in question:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''hoagax<U+00F3>ai''||''hi''||''p<U+00E1>xai''||''kaop<U+00E1>pi-sai-x<U+00E1>agah<U+00E1>''
|-
| ||Hoaga'oai||s/he||[a fish]||catch-ing-(I saw it)
|}
:"I saw Hoaga'oai catching a ''pa'ai'' fish"

(The suffix ''-sai'' turns a verb into a noun, like English '-ing'.) 

Other verbal suffixes indicate that an action is deduced from circumstantial evidence, or based on hearsay. Unlike in English, in Pirah<U+00E3> a speaker must state their source of information: they cannot be ambiguous. There are also verbal suffixes that indicate desire to perform an action, frustration in completing an action, or frustration in even starting an action. 

There are also a large number of verbal [[aspect]]s: [[perfective]] (completed) vs. [[imperfective]] (incompleted), [[Telicity|telic]] (reaching a goal) vs. atelic, continuing, [[Frequentative|repeated]], and commencing. However, despite this complexity, there appears to be little distinction of [[transitivity]]. For example, the same verb, ''xobai'', can mean either 'look' or 'see', and ''xoab'' can mean either 'die' or 'kill'. 

According to Sheldon (1988), the Pirah<U+00E3> verb has 8 main suffix slots, and a few sub-slots:
:Slot A:
:: intensive ''ba<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>''
:: <U+00D8>
:Slot B:
:: causative/incompletive ''bo<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>''
:: causative/completive ''bo<U+00B3>ga<U+00B9>''
:: inchoative/incompletive ''ho<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>''
:: inchoative/completive ''hoa<U+00B3>ga<U+00B9>''
:: future/somewhere ''a<U+00B2>i<U+00B3>p''.
:: future/elsewhere ''a<U+00B2>o<U+00B3>p''
:: past ''a<U+00B2>o<U+00B3>b''
:: <U+00D8>
:Slot C:
:: negative/optative ''sa<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>'' + C1
::: Slot C1: 
:::: preventive ''ha<U+00B3>xa<U+00B3>''
:::: opinionated ''ha<U+00B3>''
:::: possible <U+00D8>

:::: interrogative2/progressive ''o<U+00B9>xoi<U+00B9>hi<U+00B9>ai<U+00B9>''
:::: interrogative1 ''i<U+00B9>hi<U+00B9>''
:::: interrogative2 ''o<U+00B9>xoi<U+00B9>hi<U+00B9>''
:::: <U+00D8>
:Slot D:
:: continuative ''xii<U+00B3>g''
:: repetitive ''ta<U+00B3>''
:: <U+00D8>
:Slot E:

:Slot F:

:: <U+00D8>
:Slot G:
:: desiderative ''so<U+00B3>g''
:: <U+00D8>
:Slot H:
:: causal ''ta<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>o<U+00B3>''
:: conclusive ''si<U+00B3>bi<U+00B3>ga<U+00B3>''
:: emphatic/reiterative ''koi'' + H1
:: emphatic ''ko<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>'' + H1
:: reiterative ''i<U+00B3>sa<U+00B3>'' + H1
:: <U+00D8> + H1
::: Slot H1:
:::: present ''i<U+00B3>hi<U+00B9>ai<U+00B3>''
:::: past ''i<U+00B3>xa<U+00B9>a<U+00B3>ga<U+00B3>''
:::: pastImmediate ''a<U+00B3>ga<U+00B3>ha<U+00B9>''

These suffixes undergo some phonetic changes depending on context. For instance, the continuative ''xii<U+00B3>g'' reduces to ''ii<U+00B3>g'' after a consonant, e.g. in ''ai<U+00B3>t-a<U+00B9>b-xii<U+00B3>g-a<U+00B9>'' <U+2192> ''ai<U+00B3>ta<U+00B9>bii<U+00B3>ga<U+00B9>'' "he is still sleeping".

Also an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel gets inserted between two suffixes if necessary to avoid a consonant cluster; the vowel is either ''i<U+00B3>'' (before or after ''s'', ''p'', or ''t'') or ''a<U+00B3>'' (other cases), e.g. ''o<U+00B3>ga<U+00B3>i<U+00B9> so<U+00B3>g-sa<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>''  <U+2192> ''o<U+00B3>ga<U+00B3>i<U+00B9> so<U+00B3>gi<U+00B3>sa<U+00B3>i<U+00B9>'' "he possibly may not want a field".

Conversely, when the junction of two morphemes creates a double vowel (ignoring tones), the vowel with lowest tone is suppressed: ''si<U+00B3>-ba<U+00B9>-bo<U+00B3>-ga<U+00B3>-a<U+00B9>''  <U+2192> ''si<U+00B3>ba<U+00B9>bo<U+00B3>ga<U+00B9>'' "he caused the arrow to wound it". 

For further details, see Sheldon's 1988 paper.

===Embedding===
In order to embed one [[clause]] within another, the embedded clause is turned into a noun with the ''-sai'' suffix seen above:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''hi''||''ob-<U+00E1>ax<U+00E1>i''||''kaha<U+00ED>''||''kai-sai''
|-
| ||s/he||knows-really||arrow||make-ing
|}
:"He really knows how to make arrows" (literally, 'he really knows arrow-making')

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''ti''||''xog-i-ba<U+00ED>''||''g<U+00ED>xai''||''kaha<U+00ED>''||''kai-sai''
|-
| ||I||want-this-very.much||you||arrow||make-ing
|}
:"I'd really like you to make arrows" (lit., 'I really like/want your arrow-making')

Everett claims that this structure does not really constitute embedding, but is an instance of [[parataxis]], but this has been disputed by other linguists.<ref> [http://ling.auf.net/lingBuzz/000411 Piraha Exceptionality: a Reassessment]  
Andrew Ira Nevins , David Pesetsky , Cilene Rodrigues 
March 2007</ref> Everett responds to these criticisms in with the claim that -sai marks  'old information' and does not nominalize.<ref> [http://ling.auf.net/lingBuzz/000427 Cultural Constraints on Grammar in PIRAH<U+00C3>: A Reply to Nevins, Pesetsky, and Rodrigues (2007)]

==Pirah<U+00E3> and the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]==
The Pirah<U+00E3> do not count with numerals. They use only approximate measures, and in tests were unable to consistently distinguish between a group of four objects and a similarly-arranged group of five objects. When asked to duplicate groups of objects, they duplicate the number correctly on average, but almost never get the number exactly in a single trial.

Being (correctly) concerned that, because of this cultural gap, they were being cheated in [[trade]], the Pirah<U+00E3> people asked Daniel Everett, a linguist that was working with them, to teach them basic [[numeracy]] skills.  After eight months of enthusiastic but fruitless daily study, the Pirah<U+00E3> concluded that they were incapable of learning the material, and discontinued the lessons.  Not a single Pirah<U+00E3> had learned to count up to ten or even add 1 + 1.<ref name="Everett_2005_CulturalConstraintson Grammar">Everett, Daniel L. (2005) "Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirah<U+00E3>", Cultural Anthropology, v 46 n 4, http://www.pnglanguages.org/americas/brasil/PUBLCNS/ANTHRO/PHGrCult.pdf</ref>

Everett argues that test subjects are unable to count for two cultural reasons and one formal linguistic reason. First, they are nomadic hunter/gatherers with nothing to count and hence no need to practice doing so. Second, they have a cultural constraint against generalizing beyond the present which eliminates number words. Third, since numerals and counting are based on  recursion in the language according to some researchers, then the absence of recursion in their language predicts a lack of counting.  That is, it is the lack of need which explains both the lack of counting ability and the lack of corresponding vocabulary. Everett does not claim that the Pirah<U+00E3>s are cognitively incapable of counting.

== Knowledge of other languages ==

Everett claims that most of the remaining Pirah<U+00E3> speakers are monolingual, knowing only a few words of Portuguese. The anthropologist Marco Antonio Gon<U+00E7>alves, who lived with the Piraha for 18 months over several years, writes that "Most men understand Portuguese, though not all of them are able to express themselves in the language. Women have little understanding of Portuguese and never use it as a form of expression. The men developed a contact <U+2018>language<U+2019> allowing them to communicate with regional populations, mixing words from Pirah<U+00E3>, Portuguese and the Amazonian [[L<U+00ED>ngua Geral]] known as [[nheengatu]]."<ref>[http://www.socioambiental.org/pib/epienglish/piraha/ling.shtm Encyclopedia <U+2014> Indigenous Peoples of Brazil]</ref> In recent work, Jeanette Sakel of the [[University of Manchester]] is studying the use of Portuguese by Pirah<U+00E3> speakers. Everett's claim is that the Pirah<U+00E3>s use a very rudimentary Portuguese lexicon with Pirah<U+00E3> grammar when speaking Portuguese, though their Portuguese is so limited to very specific topics that they are rightly called monolingual, without contradicting Gon<U+00E7>alves (since they can communicate on a very narrow range of topics using a very restricted lexicon).   Although Gon<U+00E7>alves quotes whole stories told by the Pirah<U+00E3>, the Portuguese in these stories is not a literal transcription of what was said, but a free translation from the pidgin Portuguese of the Pirah<U+00E3>.
