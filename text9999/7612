On 20 October 1990, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United Football Club]] faced [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]] in a [[Football League First Division]] fixture at [[Old Trafford]], during the [[1990<U+2013>91 Football League First Division|1990<U+2013>91]] season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. [[The Football Association]] (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs and penalising both accordingly.

The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder [[Anders Limpar]]. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender [[Denis Irwin]]; Limpar's team-mate [[Nigel Winterburn]] made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. In all, 21 of the 22 players on the field were involved, but it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee [[Keith Hackett]] chose only to book Limpar and Winterburn for their actions.

Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]]. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs <U+00A3>50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1989.<ref name="footli">{{cite web |title=Points deductions, demotions and expulsions |url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/Articles/DidYouKnow29.htm |work=footballsite |accessdate=8 February 2014 }}</ref> This did not impact on their title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

As of 2014, it is the only instance in [[English football league system|English league football]] history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct.<ref name="footli"/> The match is considered to have instigated the [[Arsenal F.C.<U+2013>Manchester United F.C. rivalry|rivalry between the two clubs]], who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.

===Summary===
United created the first significant opportunity of the game, around the midway point of the first half, when a header from [[Steve Bruce]] was inadvertently cleared by his own team-mate McClair in the Arsenal goal.<ref name="tims">{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=James |title=Brawl film paints ugly picture |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=22 October 1990 |page=36 }}</ref> In the meantime, Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] spotted that the marking in midfield was poor. Graham got his instructions across to his players <U+2013> Limpar and Rocastle were told to push forward, while striker [[Paul Merson]] was given a [[Playmaker|deeper role]] to follow [[Mike Phelan]].<ref name="tims"/> Arsenal took the lead two minutes before half-time; Limpar made a run across United's penalty area to receive [[Paul Davis (footballer born 1961)|Paul Davis]]' corner from the right hand side. United "clearly believed this was a dummy run", hence why Phelan made no attempt to challenge.<ref name="guad">{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Bierley |title=FA to act over 21-man brawl |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=22 October 1990 |page=16 }}</ref> Davis passed the ball short to Limpar, who turned and curled it into the penalty area with his left foot. Although goalkeeper [[Les Sealey]] "did well to get down to the ball", he was unable to hold it; referee [[Keith Hackett]] deemed the ball to have crossed the goal line and gave the goal.<ref name="Obs1990"/> Ferguson offered no complaints about Hackett's decision afterwards: "The video showed quite clearly the referee was right and the ball crossed the line."<ref name="Obs1990"/>

Arsenal missed a chance to double their advantage in the second half; Limpar's pass split the home side's defence and sent Rocastle chasing for the ball. He looked certain to score, but Sealey blocked his effort.<ref name="sunt">{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Glanville |title=Arsenal win a clash of rough justice |newspaper=The Sunday Times |location=London |date=21 October 1990 |accessdate=6 March 2014 |page=74}}</ref> United brought on [[Mark Robins]] after the 66th minute mark, "but it was essentially a gesture of desperation", said [[Brian Glanville]].<ref name="sunt"/> It reshaped their attack and meant they ran the risk of further Arsenal counter-attacks.<ref name="sunt"/>

====Brawl====
{{Quote box |width=260px |bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |quote="I couldn't believe what I'd just done. The worst thing of all was watching myself on television behaving very badly." |salign=left |source=[[Brian McClair]] on the incident.<ref name="indybra">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Fleming |title=Battle Grounds: The history of Arsenal and United's emnity |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/battle-grounds-the-history-of-arsenal-and-uniteds-emnity-2239630.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=12 March 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2014 }}</ref>}}
The brawl started after the hour mark; Winterburn made a lunging tackle on Irwin, who was challenging Limpar for the ball. McClair and Irwin retaliated against Winterburn and Limpar, whom Ince pushed onto the advertising hoardings.<ref name="guad"/> All 11 United players and 10 Arsenal players on the pitch partook in the melee (goalkeeper [[David Seaman]] was the only player not to get involved), though most were attempting to calm the situation.<ref name="les2003">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Hart |title=1990 <U+2013> the brawl to end them all |url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/1990--the-brawl-to-end-them-all-6952813.html |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=25 September 2003 |accessdate=8 February 2014 }}</ref> The fracas lasted less than 20 seconds; once it died down, Hackett [[Foul (association football)#Yellow card (caution)|booked]] Limpar and Winterburn for their involvement, while the United players escaped punishment.<ref name="Obs1990"/> [[Tony Adams]], praised by ''[[The Guardian]]'' correspondent Stephen Bierley for his role in defusing matters, avoided a caution for a professional foul on McClair later on.<ref name="guad"/>

==Post-match and aftermath==
Stuart Jones of ''[[The Times]]'' concluded that [[The Football Association]] (FA) were given no choice, "but to charge Arsenal and Manchester United with misconduct and with bringing the game into disrepute."<ref name="tims"/> United took immediate action by conducting an internal enquiry.<ref>{{cite news |first=Russell |last=Thomas |title=United take a lead as the FA charge brawling clubs |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 October 1990 |page=16 }}</ref> Ferguson ordered his players to the training ground, where they re-watched the match.
