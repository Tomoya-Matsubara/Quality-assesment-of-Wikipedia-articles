'''Lakeshore East''' is a master planned mixed use [[urban development]] being built in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in {{city-state|Cook County|Illinois}}, [[United States]].  It is located in the northeastern part of the Loop, which along with [[Illinois Center]] is called the [[Chicago Loop#New Eastside|New Eastside]]. The development is bordered by [[Wacker Drive]] to the north, [[Columbus Drive (Chicago)|Columbus Drive]] to the west, [[Lake Shore Drive]] to the east, and East [[Randolph Street]] to the south. [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] designed the master plan.<ref name=port>{{cite web|url=http://www.magellandevelopment.com/portfolio-current.html|title=Portfolio|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=magellan development|date=2007}}</ref>  The development is scheduled for completion in 2011.<ref name=LEMP>{{cite web|url=http://www.som.com/content.cfm/lakeshore_east_master_plan|title=Lakeshore East Master Plan|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=[[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP]]}}</ref>  Although the majority of the buildings in the neighborhood will be 21st-century constructions resulting from the master plan, some of the current buildings were built as early as the 1960s and 1970s.  Thus, the term Lakeshore East refers only to the components of the new master plan, while the term New Eastside refers to the greater neighborhood surrounding Lakeshore East that extends westward to [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100200|title=New Eastside|accessdate=2008-06-10|publisher=[[Emporis.com]]}}</ref>  However, there is little distinction between buildings in the masterplan and other buildings in the region because the pre-existing buildings are referred to as being located in the Lakeshore East area.<ref name=SrwviLE/>

The neighborhood features several of the [[List of tallest buildings in Chicago|tallest buildings in Chicago]] and will include a few of the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|tallest buildings in the United States]].  The overall planned development, the park and several of the individual buildings have won awards for [[architecture]] or [[urban planning]].  The buildings are planned for various types of residential use ([[condominium]]s, [[apartment]]s, or [[hotel]]s).  Due to the neighborhood's proximity to both [[Lake Michigan]] to the east and the [[Chicago River]] to the north, many of the buildings are named with aquatic or nautical themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoarchitecture.info/Building/913/Aqua.php|title=Aqua|accessdate=2008-05-28|publisher=Artefaqs Corporation|work=Chicago Architecture Info}}</ref>

Previous to this urban development, the Lakeshore East area had been used by [[Illinois Central Railroad]] [[rail yards|yards]].<ref name=SrwviLE/>  After [[World War II]], the railroads sold [[airspace]] rights north of [[Randolph Street]].<ref name=FGoLM>{{cite web|url=http://www.asla.org/lamag/lam04/november/feature3.html|title=Fair Game on Lake Michigan|accessdate=2008-06-01|date=November 2004|publisher=[[American Society of Landscape Architects]]|work=Landscape Architecture Magazine|author=Freemen, Allen}}</ref> For several years after the rail yards were vacated, the site was used as a 9-hole [[golf]] course.<ref name=SrwviLE/>  [[Pete Dye]] designed the course, known as Metro Golf at Illinois Center, which was completed in 1994 and closed in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegolfcourses.net/golfcourses/IL/14535.htm|title=Metro Golf at the Illinois Center (semi-private)|accessdate=2008-05-30|publisher=Thegolfcourses.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldgolf.com/courses/usa/illinois/chicago/metro-golf-at-the-illinois-center-semi-private.html|title=Metro Golf at the Illinois Center - Semi-Private|accessdate=2008-05-30|publisher=WorldGolf.com}}</ref> The area was originally planned for development as part of the [[Illinois Center]],<ref name=SrwviLE/> and one of the challenges to the new development was to integrate itself into the inherited [[Multilevel streets in Chicago|triple-level street system]] while creating a visually appealing and pedestrian friendly neighborhood.<ref name=SrwviLE>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-re-apt-lakeshore-east-0511may11,0,7571299.story|title=Spacious rooms with views in Lakeshore East|accessdate=2008-05-26|date=[[2008-05-11]]|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Rosenberg, Janice}}</ref> The solution was to stagger ground-level amenities and building entrances from the upper level at the perimeter to the lower level at the interior. Thus the multilevel street grid is utilized around the edges, with large parking structures in the podiums, while a large park at the lowest level forms the core of the development.<ref name=SrwviLE/>
