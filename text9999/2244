The '''Gay Nigger Association of America''' (often referred to as the '''GNAA''') is an anti-[[blogging]] [[Internet trolling]] organization that aims to disrupt the Internet. They take their name from the 1992 Danish movie ''[[Gayniggers from Outer Space]]'', and do not promote racism or homophobia. They have trolled several prominent websites and Internet commentators, including members of blogging culture, [[Slashdot]], [[Wikipedia]], and [[CNN]]. They have also released software products and leaked information about operating systems. In addition, they maintain a wiki-based site dedicated to Internet commentary in a style parodying Slashdot posts and offer a [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]]-based software repository containing various GNAA coding projects.

Members of the GNAA also founded [[Goatse Security]], a [[Ethical Hacking|white hat]] information security group. Members of Goatse Security released information in June 2010 about a vulnerability located on [[AT&T]]'s website that notably affected the privacy of people who pre-ordered the [[iPad]]. After the information was released, the then-president of the GNAA, [[weev]], and GNAA member "JacksonBrown" were arrested.

==Origins and purpose==
The group claims to have been founded in 2002.<ref name="about" /> Little is known about the group's structure. New media researcher [[Andrew Lih]] has claimed that it is unclear whether there was initially a clearly defined group of GNAA members, or if founding members of the GNAA were online troublemakers united under the name in order to disrupt websites.<ref name="nobodies" /> However, an article on [[Boing Boing]] notes that the group is often perceived to be a very unified tightly-knit organization.<ref name="tightknit" />
The group's name has been controversial. According to Lih it causes "immediate alarm in anyone with a semblance of good taste," and an article in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' characterized it as "spectacularly offensive." However, the group claims that it promotes neither racism nor homophobia. The name "Gay Nigger Association of America" is often perceived as [[racism|racist]] and offensive, mainly because of the word "[[Nigger (word)|nigger]]." GNAA members deny allegations of actual racism, implying that these statements are made only to elicit angry responses and to subvert or otherwise challenge long-standing social [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], and note that the name of the organization came from the 1992 Danish satirical [[blaxploitation]] film ''Gayniggers from Outer Space''.<ref name="GLS" /> 

The group's aim is to sow disruption on the Internet. They are particularly antagonistic towards blogs,<ref name="GLS" /> but have also aimed to disrupt online communities such as Wikipedia. On Wikipedia the group has adhered to every rule in order to use the site's system against itself.<ref name="nobodies" /> Though they have disrupted online communities, the group does not organize [[denial of service]] attacks.<ref name="dailytech" />

Several members of the GNAA with expertise in white hat<ref name="ipadsec" /> security research began releasing information about security vulnerabilities under the name "Goatse Security." They chose a new name to publish their work under because they were worried that their work would not get noticed if published by the "Gay Nigger Association of America."<ref name="dailytech" />

==Trolling==
Members of the GNAA have engaged in a variety of types of trolling. One tactic is flooding weblogs with a massive amount of repeated words and phrases, sometimes referred to as "crapflooding."<ref name="GLS" /><ref name="scotsman" /> They have also produced shock sites and used links to redirect Internet users to the sites.<ref name="GLS" /> One such site, "Last Measure," contained malware that opened up pop-up windows containing shocking pictures.<ref name="porndotcom" /> On Wikipedia, members of the group created pages with a controversial and offensive names, in order to shock community members.<ref name="nobodies" />

They have also participated in [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel [[Internet Relay Chat flood|disruption]]. They have used obscure methods to force IRC users to execute commands after visiting websites containing malware.<ref name="ffbug" /> They also have used bugs in [[Firefox]] to crapflood IRC channels.<ref name="netwerk" /> They have also performed [[proof of concept]] demonstrations.<ref name="IRC" /><ref name="obamabug" /> These actions have occasionally interrupted the normal operation of popular websites such as Slashdot, even forcing some websites (such as [[4chan]]) to shut down temporarily.<ref name="4chan" /> As such, targeted communities generally consider GNAA crapfloods to be a serious matter and frequently respond with technological and social anti-trolling measures such as moderation systems to limit future disruption.<ref name="tightknit" />

In [[July 2004]], two GNAA members submitted leaked [[screenshot]]s of the forthcoming [[operating system]] [[Mac OS X v10.4]] to the popular [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] news website [[MacRumors]], which read "With [[Worldwide Developers Conference|WWDC]] just days away, the first Tiger information and screenshots appears to have been leaked. According to sources, Apple will reportedly provide developers with a Mac OS X 10.4 preview copy at WWDC on Monday. The screenshots provided reportedly come from this upcoming developer preview."<ref name="macrumors-tiger" /> Later, when accusations were raised that the images were fabricated, the GNAA released a press release which claimed that the screenshots were genuine and stated that they had "trolled" the Apple community.<ref name="gnaatiger" />

In [[June 2005]], the GNAA claimed to have created a [[Mac OS X]] Tiger release for [[Intel x86]] processors which caught media attention from various sources.<ref name="macdailynews" /><ref name="wild" /><ref name="cultofmac" /> The next day, the supposed leak and was mentioned on the [[G4 (television)|G4]] show ''[[Attack of the Show!|Attack of the Show]]''.<ref name="aots" /> The DVD image released via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] merely booted an image of [[Goatse|hello.jpg]]<ref name="rubygoldmine" /> instead of the leaked operating system as many were led to believe.<ref name="bandwagon" /> and the remaining gigabytes of space on the DVD were filled with a repetition of the text "GNAAGNAA..."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On February 3, 2007, the GNAA successfully convinced CNN reporter [[Paula Zahn]] that "one in three Americans" believe the [[September 11, 2001]] terror attacks were carried out by Israeli agents.<ref name="CNN3" /> CNN subsequently ran a story, erroneously reporting this, including screenshots of the GNAA-owned website "jewsdidwtc.com." The story involved a round-table discussion regarding antisemitism and an interview with the father of a Jewish 9/11 victim.<ref name="CNN2" /> The GNAA-owned website included claims that "over 4,000" Jews were absent from work at the World Trade Center on 9/11.<ref name="CNN2" />

==Goatse Security==
[[File:Goatse Security Logo.png|thumb|Goatse Security logo]]
{{Main|Goatse Security}}
In June 2010, Goatse Security attracted mainstream media attention for their disclosure of 114,000 [[email address]]es<ref name="npripad" /> registered to Apple [[iPad]] devices for early adopters of Apple's 3G iPad service.<ref name="Atlantic" /><ref name="sapo" /> The data was aggregated from [[AT&T]]'s own servers by feeding a publicly available script with [[HTTP]] requests containing randomly generated [[ICC-ID]]s, which would then return the associated email address. The [[FBI]] soon investigated the incident. This investigation led to the arrest of then-GNAA President,<ref name="courtcase" /> Andrew '[[weev]]' Auernheimer, on unrelated [[Drug possession|drug charges]] resulting from an FBI search of his house.<ref name="dailytech" /><ref name="cnetdrugs" /> Auernheimer and fellow GNAA member Daniel Spitler (also known as "JacksonBrown") were also mentioned in connection with the hack. A spokesman for Goatse Security expressed outrage over Auernheimer's arrest, stating:
{{Quote|The [[Search warrant|warrant]] was executed without [[probable cause]], as there is no way a reasonable and educated person could believe a crime was committed.|Goatse Security|<ref name="outrage" />}}

 | quote= Then I got a comment from the GNAA or Gay Nigger Association of America, a group of organized anti-blogging trolls who take their name from a 1992 Danish movie, ''Gay-Niggers from Outerspace''. GNAA claims that it promotes neither racism nor homophobia but aims rather to sow disruption on the internet. The comment on my blog was a minor instance of their more extensive disruptive practices (like "crapflooding" a site with a massive amount of text or data with no meaning or relevance: for example, a word, phrase, or group of letters repeated over and over, or producing hoax or shock sites and inserting links or code that redirect viewers to the site). }}
