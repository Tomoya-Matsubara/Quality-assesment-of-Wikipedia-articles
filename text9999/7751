The '''2010 Giro d'Italia''' was the 93rd&nbsp;edition of the [[Giro d'Italia]], one of cycling's [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. The Giro started off in [[Amsterdam]] on 8&nbsp;May and stayed in the [[Netherlands]] for three stages, before leaving the country.<ref>{{cite web |title=2010 Giro to start in Amsterdam|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/more/05/31/giro.2010.start.ap/index.html |date=May 31, 2009|publisher=AP |accessdate=2009-06-26}}</ref> The route included climbs such as [[Monte Zoncolan]], [[Plan de Corones]], the [[Passo del Mortirolo]] and the [[Passo di Gavia]] before ending in [[Verona]] with an [[individual time trial]].<ref name="all-inclusive">{{cite news

Principal favorites for overall success in the Giro included [[Ivan Basso]] of the {{ct|LIQ|2010}} team, [[Cadel Evans]] for {{ct|BMC|2010}}, and {{ct|CTT|2010}}'s [[Carlos Sastre]]. After three weeks of racing, it was Basso who claimed his second Giro d'Italia title, after also winning in [[2006 Giro d'Italia|2006]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/may/30/ivan-basso-giro-ditalia-cycling|title=Ivan Basso wins Giro d'Italia for second time to delight of home fans|date=2010-05-30|work=Guardian|accessdate=2010-05-31}}</ref> [[David Arroyo]] from {{ct|GCE|2010}} and Basso's teammate [[Vincenzo Nibali]] rounded out the podium. Australian riders won all the lesser jersey awards, with Evans taking the [[points classification in the Giro d'Italia|points classification]], {{ct|OLO|2010}}'s [[Matthew Lloyd]] the winner of the [[mountains classification in the Giro d'Italia|mountains classification]], and [[Richie Porte]] of {{ct|SAX|2010}} the Giro's [[young rider classification in the Giro d'Italia|best young rider]].

The road race stages in the Netherlands were both marred by repeated crashes, which led to some unexpected big time gaps before the transfer to Italy. The [[General classification in the Giro d'Italia|overall standings]] were very turbulent in the first week, with four different riders holding the [[pink jersey statistics|race leader's pink jersey]]. The 11th stage greatly re-shaped the overall standings, when several riders, including Sastre, gained almost 13&nbsp;minutes against the remainder of the field. Porte took the pink jersey after this stage. Two days later, Arroyo took the jersey, and kept it for five days. He eventually lost it to Basso on the first of two very difficult mountain stages to close out the Giro. Success was fairly widespread among the Giro's 22&nbsp;teams, as 17 of them came away with either a stage win, classification win, or stint in the pink jersey.

{{main|List of teams and cyclists in the 2010 Giro d'Italia}}
The 22&nbsp;teams in the race were announced on 22&nbsp;March. Sixteen teams were guaranteed a place in the race by virtue of a September 2008 agreement between the UCI and the organizers of the season's three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. Those guaranteed a place are those who were members of the [[UCI ProTour]] at the time of the agreement.<ref>

The Giro was often described as being wide open in terms of who had the best chance to win it. This is because many notable riders, including the past three champions, did not enter. [[2007 Giro d'Italia]] champion [[Danilo Di Luca]], who originally finished second in the [[2009 Giro d'Italia]], was suspended by his national federation in February for a [[2009 Giro d'Italia#Aftermath|doping incident in the 2009 Giro]].<ref>

The Giro's 21 stages were divided into the following classifications by race organizers [[Gazzetta dello Sport]]: four [[time trial]]s (three [[individual time trial|individual]] and one [[team time trial|team]]), seven flat stages, five mixed stages, and six mountain stages.<ref name="tappe">

Five stages ended with climbs, with most coming in the race's last week. The first was stage 8 to [[Monte Terminillo]], a {{convert|16.1|km|1|abbr=on}} long climb gaining {{convert|1672|m|abbr=on}} of vertical elevation for an average gradient of 7.3 percent, one of the most difficult climbs in the [[Appenines]] in the region of [[Abruzzo]]. The next was [[Monte Zoncolan]] in the [[Carnic Alps]], which at {{convert|10.5|km|1|abbr=on}} in length was shorter than some of the other climbs in the race, but with {{convert|1210|m|abbr=on}} of vertical gain in that time, its 20 percent maximum gradient made it one of the most difficult. The Stage 16 individual time trial went to [[Plan de Corones]], on a course identical to the one used in the [[2008 Giro d'Italia]]. In {{convert|12.9|km|abbr=on}}, this stage gained over {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} and featured a section with 24 percent gradients in the final kilometer. The Giro's last two road race stages were especially climbing-intensive, including the [[Passo del Mortirolo]], rising {{convert|1250|m|abbr=on}} in {{convert|12.8|km|1|abbr=on}} for an average gradient of 10 percent, and the [[Passo di Gavia]], known for being climbed during the [[1988 Giro d'Italia]] in the middle of a driving blizzard. The Gavia was also the ''Cima Coppi'', the race's highest point, and Stage 20, in which it featured, was considered the [[queen stage]].<ref name="ESPN" /> Other climbs during the race included the [[Passo del Bratello]], [[Monte Grappa]], the [[Passo delle Palade]], the [[Passo di Santa Cristina]], the [[Forcola di Livigno]], and the last climb of the race, the [[Passo del Tonale]]. Most of these climbs also featured difficult descents.<ref>

The route was noted to appeal to many types of riders, be they [[climbing specialist|climbers]], [[cycling sprinter|sprinters]], or time trialists. The race had seven flat stages which figured into end in mass sprints, and the hilly mixed stages were inviting for breakaways.<ref name="all-inclusive" /><ref name="varied" /> Sastre, one of the first riders to announce he would ride the Giro, commented that the route was much harder than that of the 2009 Giro, and would demand a very strong climber to be its champion.<ref>

Crashing and, consequently, falling away from the leading group on the road, meant different things for different riders.

Stage 11 into [[L'Aquila]] provided for major changes to the overall standings. More than 50 riders formed the day's escape group, and they quickly took 20 minutes advantage. Among them were Sastre, Wiggins, and {{ct|SAX|2010}}'s [[Richie Porte]], who was holding the white jersey as [[young rider classification in the Giro d'Italia|best young rider]] and, at sixth overall, was the best-placed man in the group. Sastre, Wiggins, and Porte all had multiple support riders with them in the breakaway who set strenuous paces to keep the group away. The main field, containing the Giro's top favorites, pulled back a little time but was still nearly 13 minutes behind stage winner [[Evgeni Petrov]] at the finish. The day's result massively shuffled the overall classification. Porte was the only rider who had been in the top ten before the stage who remained there afterward, and took the pink jersey. Sastre and Wiggins, who entered the Giro as contenders but had fallen well back in the overall standings before this stage, both moved back into the top ten.<ref name="stage11">{{cite web

After a stage each for the breakaway and the sprinters, during which there were no major changes to the overall standings, the riders were faced with the very climbing-intensive final two road stages. The {{ct|LIQ|2010|nolink=yes}} team rode a very hard tempo in stage 19 over the [[Passo del Mortirolo]], which eventually whittled that group down to just Basso, Nibali, and Scarponi. They crossed the Mortirolo more than two minutes ahead of Arroyo, which was nearly enough time to make Basso the virtual race leader. Arroyo, noted as a far better descender than Basso, took very aggressive lines coming down the Mortirolo and caught up with Vinokourov, Sastre, Evans, and [[John Gadret]], who had been between him and the leading trio. Basso's group had only 30 seconds on Arroyo's at the start of the stage-concluding [[Aprica]] climb, but they took more and more time as the climb went on and finished three minutes ahead, giving Basso the pink jersey with two days left to race.<ref name="stage19">{{cite web

==Classification leadership==
In the 2010 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the [[general classification]], calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner was considered the winner of the Giro.<ref name="demystified">{{cite web

Additionally, there was a [[points classification]], which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. Unlike in the better known [[points classification in the Tour de France]], the type of stage had no effect on what points were on offer &ndash; each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The win earned 25&nbsp;points, second place earned 20&nbsp;points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.<ref name="demystified" /> 

There was also a [[mountains classification]], the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The ''Cima Coppi'', the race's highest point of elevation, awarded still more points than the other first-category climbs.<ref name="demystified" />

The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1985 were eligible.<ref name="demystified" />

There were also three classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20&nbsp;placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team;<ref name="demystified" /> and the Fair Play classification rewarded those teams that best avoided penalty points for minor technical infringements. 

The rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.

===Minor classifications===
Other less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour.<ref name="finalstandings" /><ref name="demystified" /> Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the ''Traguardo Volante'', or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known in previous years as the "Intergiro" and the "Expo Milano 2015" classification.<ref name="demystified" /> It was won by [[Tom Stamsnijder]] of the {{ct|RAB|2010|nolink=yes}} team.<ref name="finalstandings" />

Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Mountains classification winner [[Matthew Lloyd]] won this award.<ref name="finalstandings" /><ref name="demystified" /> The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were only awarded for the top three finishers in each stage. It was won, like the closely associated points classification, by [[Cadel Evans]].<ref name="finalstandings" /><ref name="demystified" /> Additionally, the ''Premio della Fuga'' rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. {{ct|QST|2010|nolink=yes}}'s [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Pineau]] was first in this competition.<ref name="finalstandings" /><ref name="demystified" /> Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. {{ct|LIQ|2010|nolink=yes}} was most successful in avoiding penalties, and so won the Fair Play classification.<ref name="finalstandings" /><ref name="demystified" />

===World Rankings points===
The Giro was one of 26&nbsp;events throughout the season that contributed points towards the [[2010 UCI World Ranking]]. Points were awarded to the top 20&nbsp;finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in each stage.<ref>{{cite web
