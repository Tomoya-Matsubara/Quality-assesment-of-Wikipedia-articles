'''Cordell Hull''' ([[October 2]], [[1871]] <U+2013> [[July 23]], [[1955]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] from the State of [[Tennessee]].  He is best-known as the longest-serving [[United States Secretary of State]], having held the position for eleven years ([[1933]]-[[1944]]) in the administration of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], a period that included [[World War II]].  Hull received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1945 for his role in establishing the [[United Nations]], and was referred to by President Roosevelt as the "Father of the UN."

Hull was born in a log cabin in Olympus, which is now part of [[Pickett County, Tennessee]], but had been incorporated from [[Overton County, Tennessee]].  Hull became the elected chairman of the [[Clay County, Tennessee|Clay County]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] at the age of 19.  

In 1891, he graduated from [[Cumberland School of Law]] at [[Cumberland University]] and was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]]. He served in the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] from 1893 to 1897. During the [[Spanish-American War]], Hull served in [[Cuba]] as a captain in the Fourth Regiment of the Tennessee Volunteer Infantry.

He served 11 terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]] (1907-1921 and 1923-1931) and claimed authorship of the federal [[income tax]] laws of 1913 and 1916 and the [[inheritance tax]] of 1916.  After an electoral defeat in 1920, Hull served as chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]].  He was elected to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1930, but resigned upon being named Secretary of State in 1933.

In 1933 Hull was appointed [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]; he served 11 years until he retired from public office.  Hull became the underlying force and architect in the creation of the [[United Nations]], drafting, along with his staff, the "[[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]" in mid-1943.  He resigned as Secretary of State in November 1944 because of failing health.  

Hull died in 1955 in [[Washington, D.C.]] and is buried in the vault of the [[Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea]] in the [[Washington National Cathedral]], which is an [[Episcopal]] church

There is now a Cordell Hull Museum located near his birthplace in [[Byrdstown, Tennessee]], which houses his papers and other memorabilia.  

==Early life and family==
Hull was born in Olympus, [[Pickett County, Tennessee]], third of the five sons of William Paschal Hull (1840-1923) and Elizabeth (Riley) Hull (1841-1903). His brothers were named Orestes (1868), Sanadius (1870), Wyoming (1875), and Roy (1881). He attended college from 1889 until 1890. At the age of 19, Hull became the elected chairman of the [[Clay County, Tennessee|Clay County]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In 1891, he graduated from [[Cumberland School of Law]] at [[Cumberland University]] and was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]]. He served in the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] from 1893 to 1897.

During the [[Spanish-American War]], Hull served in [[Cuba]] as a captain in the Fourth Regiment of the Tennessee Volunteer Infantry.

Hull married Rose Frances (Witz) Whitney (?1875-1954) in 1917; the couple had no children.

==Early national career==
From 1903 to 1907, Hull served as a local judge; later he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] where he served 11 terms (1907-1921 and 1923-1931) totaling 22 years. After his defeat in 1920, he served as chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. As a member of the powerful [[U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means committee]], he fought for low tariffs and claimed authorship of the federal income tax laws of 1913 and 1916 and the [[inheritance tax]] of 1916. Hull was influential in advising [[Albert Gore, Sr.]], then a state legislator, to run for the U.S. Congress in 1938.

==U.S. Senate, Secretary of State==
He was elected to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1930. In 1933, Roosevelt named him Secretary of State.  Roosevelt often ignored Hull in making major foreign policy decisions, leaving the Secretary, in the opinion of most historians, to play the role of a highly popular empty suit. Hull did try to enlarge foreign trade and lower tariffs. In 1943, Hull served as United States delegate to the [[Moscow Conference]]. 

Hull chaired the [[Advisory Committee of Postwar Foreign Policy]], created in February 1942.

When the [[Free French Forces]] of [[Charles de Gaulle]] liberated the islands of [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]] (located south of [[Newfoundland]]) in December 1941, Hull lodged a very strong protest and even went as far as referring to the Gaullist naval forces as "the so called Free French." His request to have the Vichy governor reinstated was met with strong criticism in the American press. The islands remained under the Free French movement until the end of [[World War II]].

Hull was the underlying force and architect in the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|creation]] of the [[United Nations]], as recognized by the 1945 Nobel Prize for Peace, an honor for which Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated him. During World War II Hull and Roosevelt spent tireless hours working toward the development of a world organization to prevent a third World War.  Hull and his staff drafted the "[[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]" in mid-1943. 

Never one to sit idly by if American interests were (in his view) threatened, Hull would think nothing of dressing down close allies, such as what happened to [[New Zealand]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Peter Fraser]] in early 1944, over U.S. objections to the [[Canberra Pact]] (a military treaty of alliance between Australia and New Zealand made in February 1944 without U.S. consultation).

==Later years==
Hull resigned as Secretary of State in November 1944 because of failing health. Roosevelt described Hull, upon his departure as "the one person in all the world who has done his most to make this great plan for peace (the United Nations) an effective fact". The [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] honored Hull with the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1945 in recognition of his efforts for peace and understanding in the [[Western Hemisphere]], his trade agreements, and his work to establish the United Nations.  Hull was the longest-serving Secretary of State: 11 years, nine months.

==Legacy==

Hull died in [[Washington, D.C.]], and is buried in the vault of the [[Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea]] in the [[Washington National Cathedral|Washington Cathedral]]. His memory is preserved by Cordell Hull Dam on the [[Cumberland River]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee]]. Hull was portrayed by veteran actor [[George Macready]] in the 1970 film ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''

[[Cumberland School of Law]] continues to honor Cordell Hull with a Cordell Hull Speaker's Forum and the pictured [[Moot Court]] Room.

A segment of [[Kentucky]] highway routes 90, 63, and 163, from [[Interstate 65]] at  [[Mammoth Cave National Park]] south to the Tennessee State Line, is named "Cordell Hull Highway."

The Shoreline School District in [[Shoreline, Washington]], had a Cordell Hull Middle School, which was renamed in the mid-1990s to Meridian Park Elementary, after a renovation.

There is a [[Cordell Hull Lake]], covering approximately 12,000 acres, in the vicinity of [[Nashville]].

== Fictional appearance ==
In the [[Worldwar]] series of [[alternate history]] novels by [[Harry Turtledove]], Hull becomes president at some point in 1944, following the deaths of first Vice-President Wallace and then President Roosevelt.
