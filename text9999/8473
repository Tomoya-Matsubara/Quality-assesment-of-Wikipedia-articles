<!--first para - general note on etymology and importance and severity of condition -->
'''Major depressive disorder''' (also known as '''clinical depression''', '''major depression''', '''unipolar depression''', or '''unipolar disorder''') is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by a pervasive [[depression (mood)|low mood]], low [[self-esteem]], and [[anhedonia|loss of interest or pleasure]] in normally enjoyable activities.  The term "major depressive disorder" was selected by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] for this [[syndrome|symptom cluster]] under [[mood disorder]]s in the 1980 version of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-III) classification, and has become widely used since. The general term '''depression''' is often used to describe the disorder, but as it is also used to describe  a [[depression (mood)|depressed mood]], more precise terminology is preferred in clinical and research use. Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, approximately 3.4% of people with major depression commit [[suicide]], and up to 60% of all people who commit suicide have depression or another mood disorder.

 <!-- diagnosis -->
The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the patient's self-reported experiences, behavior reported by relatives or friends, and a [[Mental status examination|mental status exam]]. There is no laboratory test for major depression, although physicians generally request tests for physical conditions that may cause similar symptoms.  The most common time of onset is between the ages of 30 and 40 years, with a later peak between 50 and 60 years. Major depression is reported about twice as frequently in women as in men, although men are at higher risk for suicide.

 <!--treatment and course -->
Most patients are treated in the community with [[antidepressant]] medication and some with [[psychotherapy]] or counseling. Hospitalization may be necessary in cases with associated  [[self-neglect]] or a significant risk of harm to self or others. A minority are treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT), under a short-acting [[general anaesthetic]]. The course of the disorder varies widely, from one episode lasting months to a lifelong disorder with recurrent [[major depressive episode]]s. Depressed individuals have shorter [[Life expectancy|life expectancies]] than those without depression, in part because of greater susceptibility to medical illnesses.  Current and former patients may be [[Social stigma|stigmatized]].

 <!-- history and discussion of nature and causes-->
The understanding of the nature and causes of depression has evolved over the centuries, though many aspects of depression remain incompletely understood and are the subject of discussion and research. [[psychology|Psychological]], [[Social psychology|psycho-social]], [[evolution]]ary and [[biology|biological]] causes have been proposed. Psychological treatments are based on theories of personality, interpersonal communication, and [[learning theory]].  Most biological theories focus on the [[monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamine]] chemicals [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]] that are naturally present in the [[Human brain|brain]] and assist communication between [[Neuron|nerve cells]]. Monoamines have been implicated in depression, and most antidepressants work to increase the active levels of at least one.

{{main|Biology of depression}}

====Monoamine hypothesis====
Most [[antidepressant]]s increase [[Chemical synapse|synaptic]] levels of serotonin, one of a group of [[neurotransmitter]]s known as monoamines. Serotonin is hypothesized to help regulate other neurotransmitter systems; decreased serotonin activity may allow these systems to act in unusual and erratic ways.<ref name="IntegrativeSerotonin">{{Harvnb|Barlow|2005| p=226}}</ref> According to this "permissive hypothesis", depression  arises when low serotonin levels promote low levels of norepinephrine, another monoamine neurotransmitter.<ref>{{cite web |author=Shah N, Eisner T, Farrell M, Raeder C | year=1999 |month=July/August |url=http://www.pswi.org/professional/pharmaco/depression.pdf |title=An overview of SSRIs for the treatment of depression |work=Journal of the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin |accessdate=2008-11-10| format=PDF}}</ref> Some antidepressants  enhance the levels of norepinephrine directly, whereas others raise the levels of dopamine, a third monoamine neurotransmitter. These observations gave rise to the [[monoamine hypothesis]] of depression. In its contemporary formulation, the monoamine hypothesis postulates that a deficiency of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for the corresponding features of depression: "Norepinephrine may be related to alertness and energy as well as anxiety, attention, and interest in life; [lack of] serotonin to anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions; and dopamine to attention, motivation, pleasure, and reward, as well as interest in life."<ref name="pmid18494537">{{cite journal |author=Nutt DJ |title=Relationship of neurotransmitters to the symptoms of major depressive disorder |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=69 Suppl E1 |pages=4<U+2013>7 |year=2008 |pmid=18494537}}</ref> The proponents of this theory recommend the choice of an antidepressant with mechanism of action that impacts the most prominent symptoms. Anxious and irritable patients should be treated with SSRIs or [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s, and those experiencing a loss of energy and enjoyment of life with norepinephrine and dopamine enhancing drugs.<ref name="pmid18494537"/>

Synapses are specialized gaps between neurons. [[Action potential|Electrical impulses]] arriving at the axon terminal trigger release of packets of chemical messengers ([[neurotransmitter]]s), which diffuse across the synaptic cleft to [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on the adjacent dendrite temporarily affecting the [[Postsynaptic potential|likelihood that an electrical impulse]] will be triggered in the latter neuron. Once released the neurotransmitter is rapidly metabolised or pumped back into a neuron. Antidepressants influence the overall balance of these processes.]]

In the past two decades, research has revealed multiple limitations of the monoamine hypothesis, and its explanatory inadequacy has been criticized within the psychiatric community.<ref name="pmid10775017">{{cite journal |author=Hirschfeld RM |title=History and evolution of the monoamine hypothesis of depression |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=61 Suppl 6|pages=4<U+2013>6 |year=2000 |pmid=10775017}}</ref> Intensive investigation has failed to find convincing evidence of a primary dysfunction of a specific monoamine system in patients with major depressive disorders. The medications [[tianeptine]] and [[opipramol]] have long been known to have antidepressant properties despite lacking any effect on  the monoamine system. Experiments with pharmacological agents that cause depletion of monoamines have shown that this depletion does not cause depression in healthy people nor does it worsen symptoms in depressed patients<U+2014>although an intact monoamine system is necessary for antidepressants to achieve therapeutic effectiveness.<ref name="pmid10775018">{{cite journal |author=Delgado PL |title=Depression: The case for a monoamine deficiency |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=61 Suppl 6|pages=7<U+2013>11 |year=2000 |pmid=10775018}}</ref> According to an essay published by the [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS), the monoamine hypothesis, already limited, has been further oversimplified when presented to the general public.<ref name="PLoS">{{cite journal |author=Lacasse J, Leo J |title=Serotonin and depression: A disconnect between the advertisements and the scientific literature |journal=[[PLoS Medicine|PLoS Med]] |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=e392 |year=2005 |pmid=16268734 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392.g001|url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

====Other theories====
[[MRI]] scans of patients with depression  have reported a number of differences in brain structure compared to those without the illness. Although there is some inconsistency in the results, [[meta-analyses]] have shown there is strong evidence for smaller [[hippocampus|hippocampal]]<ref>{{cite journal| author=Videbech, P and Ravnkilde| title=Hippocampal volume and depression: A meta-analysis of MRI studies| journal=American Journal of Psychiatry| volume=161|pages=1957<U+2013>66.| year=2004| pmid=15514393}}</ref> volumes and increased numbers of [[hyperintensities|hyperintensive lesions]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Videbech, P| title=MRI findings in patients with affective disorder: a meta-analysis| journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica| volume=96| issue=3 |pages=157<U+2013>68| year=1997| doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1997.tb10146.x}}</ref> Hyperintensities have been associated with patients with a late age of onset, and have led to the development of the theory of [[Subcortical ischemic depression|vascular depression]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Herrmann LL, Le Masurier M, Ebmeier KP |title=White matter hyperintensities in late life depression: a systematic review|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |volume=79|pages=619<U+2013>24 |year=2008|doi=10.1136/jnnp.2007.124651|pmid=17717021}}</ref>

There may be a link between depression and [[neurogenesis]] of the [[hippocampus]],<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=brain-pathway-may-underlie-depression |title=Brain pathway may underlie depression |accessdate=2008-09-13 |author=Mayberg H |date=July 6, 2007 |journal=[[Scientific American]]|volume=17|issue=4|pages=26<U+2013>31}}</ref> a center for both mood and memory. Loss of hippocampal [[neuron]]s is found in some depressed individuals and correlates with impaired memory and dysthymic mood.

The level of BDNF in the blood plasma of depressed subjects is drastically reduced (more than threefold) as compared to the norm. Antidepressant treatment increases the blood level of BDNF. Although decreased plasma BDNF levels have been found in many other disorders, there is some evidence that BDNF is involved in the cause of depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressants.<ref name="pmid18571629">{{cite journal |author=Sen S, Duman R, Sanacora G |title=Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor, depression, and antidepressant medications: Meta-analyses and implications |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=527<U+2013>32 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18571629 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.05.005}}</ref> 

Major depression may also be caused in part by an overactive [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) that is similar to the neuro-endocrine response to stress. Investigations reveal increased levels of the hormone [[cortisol]] and enlarged pituitary and adrenal glands, suggesting disturbances of the [[endocrine system]] may play a role in some psychiatric disorders, including major depression. Oversecretion of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] from the [[hypothalamus]] is thought to drive this, and is implicated in the cognitive and arousal symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Monteleone P |url=http://www.co-psychiatry.com/pt/re/copsych/abstract.00001504-200111000-00020.htm;jsessionid=JWdDsz1T6hhjhpsR47xrbhpTjhxhpdS64Yh8QzptbqR1rrNkmVfF!1600976923!181195628!8091!-1 (abstract) |title=Endocrine disturbances and psychiatric disorders |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. |year=2001 |volume=14|issue=6|pages=605<U+2013>10|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |issn=0951<U+2013>7367}}</ref>

[[Image:Biological clock human.PNG|thumb|left|350px|Depression may be related to the same brain mechanisms that control the cycles of sleep and wakefulness.]] Depression may be related to abnormalities in the [[circadian rhythm]], or biological clock. For example, the [[Rapid eye movement (sleep)|REM stage of sleep]], the one in which [[dream]]ing occurs, may be quick to arrive, and intense, in depressed people. REM sleep depends on decreased serotonin levels in the [[brain stem]],<ref name="pmid12531125"/> and is impaired by compounds, such as antidepressants, that increase serotoninergic tone in brain stem structures.<ref name="pmid12531125"/> Overall, the serotonergic system is least active during sleep and most active during wakefulness. Prolonged wakefulness due to [[sleep deprivation]] activates serotonergic neurons, leading to processes similar to the therapeutic effect of antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Depressed individuals can exhibit a significant lift in mood after a night of sleep deprivation.  SSRIs may directly depend on the increase of central serotonergic neurotransmission for their therapeutic effect, the same system that impacts cycles of sleep and wakefulness.<ref name="pmid12531125">{{cite journal |author=Adrien J. |title=Neurobiological bases for the relation between sleep and depression|journal=Sleep Medicine Review |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=341<U+2013>51 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=12531125 |pmc= |doi=}}</ref>

Research on the effects of [[light therapy]] on treating [[seasonal affective disorder]] suggests that light deprivation  is related  to decreased activity in the serotonergic system and to abnormalities in the sleep cycle, particularly insomnia. Exposure to light also targets the serotonergic system, providing more support for the important role this system may play in depression.<ref name="pmid17964200">{{cite journal |author=Terman M |title=Evolving applications of light therapy|journal=Sleep Medicine Review |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=497<U+2013>507 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17964200 |pmc= |doi=}}</ref> Sleep deprivation and [[light therapy]] both target the same brain neurotransmitter system and brain areas as antidepressant drugs, and are now used clinically to treat depression.<ref name="pmid17689120">{{cite journal |author=Benedetti F, Barbini B, Colombo C, Smeraldi E |title=Chronotherapeutics in a psychiatric ward|journal=Sleep Medicine Review |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=509<U+2013>22 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17689120 |pmc= |doi=}}</ref> Light therapy, sleep deprivation and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being used in combination quickly to interrupt a deep depression in hospitalized patients.<ref name="pmid17964200"/>

The hormone [[estrogen]] has been implicated in depressive disorders due to the increase in risk of depressive episodes after puberty, the antenatal period, and reduced rates after [[menopause]].<ref name="pmid12810759"/> Conversely, the premenstrual and postpartum periods of low estrogen levels are also associated with increased risk.<ref name="pmid12810759"/> The use of estrogen has been under-researched, and although some small trials show promise in its use to prevent or treat depression, the evidence for its effectiveness is not strong.<ref name="pmid12810759"/> Estrogen replacement therapy has been shown to be beneficial in improving mood in [[Menopause#Perimenopause|perimenopause]], but it is unclear if it is merely the menopausal symptoms that are being reversed.<ref name="pmid12810759">{{cite journal |author=Cutter WJ, Norbury R, Murphy DG |title=Oestrogen, brain function, and neuropsychiatric disorders |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=837<U+2013>40 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12810759 |pmc=1738534 |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12810759}}</ref>

Other research has explored potential roles of molecules necessary for overall [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] functioning: [[cytokine]]s and [[essential nutrient]]s.

American psychiatrist [[Aaron T. Beck]] developed what is now known as a cognitive model of depression in the early 1960s.

From a [[counseling psychology]] viewpoint, the therapist may see depression, not as a biochemical illness or disorder, but as "a species-wide evolved suite of emotional programmes that are mostly activated by a perception, almost always over-negative, of a major decline in personal usefulness, that can sometimes be linked to guilt, shame or perceived rejection".<ref name="Carey05">{{cite journal |title=Evolution, depression and counselling |journal=Counselling Psychology Quarterly | year=2005 |author=Carey TJ |volume=18 | issue=3 |pages=215<U+2013>22 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/ccpq/2005/00000018/00000003/art00005 |doi=10.1080/09515070500304508}}</ref> This suite may have manifested in aging hunters in humans' [[foraging]] past, who were marginalized by their declining skills, and may continue to appear in [[Social alienation|alienated members]] of today's society.

Additionally, in a manner analogous to that in which [[pain|physical pain]] has evolved to hinder actions that may cause further injury, "[[suffering|psychic misery]]" may have evolved to prevent hasty and maladaptive reactions to distressing situations.<ref name="Mashman97">{{cite journal | last = Mashman| first = RC | title = An evolutionary view of psychic misery | journal = Journal of Social Behaviour & Personality | volume = 12| pages = 979<U+2013>99 |year=1997|issn=0886-1641}}</ref>

=== DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria ===

The most widely used criteria for diagnosing depressive conditions are found in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s revised fourth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV-TR), and the [[World Health Organization]]'s ''[[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' (ICD-10) which uses the name '''recurrent depressive disorder'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf30.htm+f33|title=ICD-10:|publisher=www.who.int|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref>  The latter system is typically used in European countries, while the former is used in the US and many other non-European nations,<ref>{{Harvnb |Sadock|2002| p=288}}</ref> and the authors of both have worked towards conforming one with the other.<ref name=APA372>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=xxix}}</ref>

Major depressive disorder is classified as a mood disorder in DSM-IV-TR.<ref name=APA345>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=345}}</ref> The diagnosis hinges on the presence of a single or recurrent [[major depressive episode]].<ref name=APA349/> Further qualifiers are used to classify both the episode itself and the course of the disorder. The category [[Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified|Depressive disorder not otherwise specified]] is diagnosed if the depressive episode's manifestation does not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. The [[ICD-10]] system does not use the term ''Major depressive disorder'', but lists very similar criteria for the diagnosis of a depressive episode (mild, moderate or severe); the term ''recurrent'' may be added if there have been multiple episodes without mania.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online2005/fr-icd.htm?gf30.htm |title=Mood (affective) disorders |accessdate=2008-10-19 |work=ICD-10, Chapter V, Mental and behavioural disorders |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) |year=2004}}</ref>

==== Major depressive episode ====
{{main|Major depressive episode}}

A major depressive episode is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed mood that persists for at least two weeks.<ref name=APA349/> Episodes may be isolated or recurrent and are categorized as mild (few symptoms in excess of minimum criteria), moderate, or severe (marked impact on social or occupational functioning). An episode with psychotic features<U+2014>commonly referred to as ''[[psychotic depression]]''<U+2014>is automatically rated as severe. If the patient has had an episode of [[mania]] or [[hypomania|markedly elevated mood]], a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]] is made instead.<ref name=APA372>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=372}}</ref> Depression without mania is sometimes referred to as ''unipolar'' because the mood remains at one emotional state or "pole".<ref>{{Harvnb |Parker|1996| p=173}}</ref>

DSM-IV-TR excludes cases where the symptoms are a result of [[bereavement]], although it is possible for normal bereavement to evolve into a depressive episode if the mood persists and the characteristic features of a major depressive episode develop.<ref name=APA352>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=352}}</ref> The criteria have been criticized because they do not take into account any other aspects of the personal and social context in which depression can occur.<ref name="Wakefield07">{{cite journal |author=Wakefield JC, Schmitz MF, First MB, Horwitz AV |title=Extending the bereavement exclusion for major depression to other losses: Evidence from the National Comorbidity Survey |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=433<U+2013>40 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17404120 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.4.433 |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/64/4/433|laysummary=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/02/AR2007040201693.html |laysource=The Washington Post|laydate=2007-04-03}}</ref> In addition, some studies have found little empirical support for the DSM-IV cut-off criteria, indicating they are a diagnostic convention imposed on a continuum of depressive symptoms of varying severity and duration:<ref name="Kendler98">{{cite journal |author=Kendler KS, Gardner CO |title=Boundaries of major depression: An evaluation of DSM-IV criteria |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=172<U+2013>77 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9464194 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/155/2/172 |day=01}}</ref> excluded are a range of related diagnoses, including [[dysthymia]] which involves a chronic but milder mood disturbance,<ref name="harvnb">{{Harvnb |Sadock|2002| p=552}}</ref> [[Recurrent brief depression]] which involves briefer depressive episodes,<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=778}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Carta MG, Altamura AC, Hardoy MC, ''et al.'' |year=2003|title=Is recurrent brief depression an expression of mood spectrum disorders in young people? |journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience |volume=253 |issue=3 |pages=149<U+2013>53 |doi=10.1007/s00406-003-0418-5}}</ref> [[minor depressive disorder]] which involves only some of the symptoms of major depression,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rapaport MH, Judd LL, Schettler PJ, ''et al.'' |year=2002|title=A descriptive analysis of minor depression |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=159 |issue=4 |pages=637<U+2013>43 |pmid=11925303 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.4.637}}</ref> and [[Adjustment disorder|adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] which involves low mood resulting from a psychological response to an identifiable event or [[Stress (biological)|stressor]].<ref name="psychiatric355">{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=355}}</ref>

==== Subtypes ====

The DSM-IV-TR recognizes five further subtypes of MDD, called ''specifiers'', in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:

* '''[[Melancholic depression]]''' is characterized by a loss of pleasure in most or all activities, a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of [[grief]] or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early morning waking, [[psychomotor retardation]], excessive weight loss (not to be confused with [[anorexia nervosa]]), or excessive guilt.<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| pp=419<U+2013>20}}</ref>
* '''[[Atypical depression]]''' is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant [[weight gain]] or increased appetite (comfort eating), excessive sleep or sleepiness ([[hypersomnia]]), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived [[social rejection|interpersonal rejection]].<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=421<U+2013>22}}</ref>
* '''[[Catatonia|Catatonic depression]]''' is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms. Here the person is mute and almost stuporose, and either remains immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements. Catatonic symptoms also occur in [[schizophrenia]] or in manic episodes, or may be caused by [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| pp=417<U+2013>18}}</ref>
* '''[[Postpartum depression]]''' (Mild mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, not elsewhere classified in ICD-10<ref>

* '''[[Seasonal affective disorder]]''' (SAD) is a form of depression in which depressive episodes come on in the autumn or winter, and resolve in spring. The diagnosis is made if at least two episodes have occurred in colder months with none at other times, over a two-year period or longer.<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=425}}</ref>

=== Differential diagnoses ===

To confer major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, [[Differential diagnosis|other potential diagnoses]] must be considered, including dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood or bipolar disorder. [[Dysthymia]] is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as ''double depression'').<ref name="harvnb"/> [[Adjustment disorder|Adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.<ref name="psychiatric355"/> [[Bipolar disorder]], previously known as ''manic-depressive disorder'', is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of mania or [[hypomania]]. Although depression is currently categorized as a separate disorder, there is ongoing debate because individuals diagnosed with major depression often experience some hypomanic symptoms, indicating a mood disorder continuum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Akiskal HS, Benazzi F |year=2006 |month=May |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent [major] depressive and bipolar II disorders: Evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=45<U+2013>54 |pmid=16488021 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
{{For|a fuller discussion of standard, rarely used, and more experimental treatments|Treatment for depression}}
The three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for people under 18, while electroconvulsive therapy is only used as a last resort. Care is usually given on an [[Psychiatry#Outpatient treatment|outpatient]] basis, while treatment in an [[Psychiatry#Inpatient treatment|inpatient]] unit is considered if there is a significant risk to self or others.

Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition.<ref name=Patel04>{{cite journal |author=Patel V, Araya R, Bolton P ''et al.'' |year=2004|month=April|title=Editorial: Treating depression in the developing world|journal=Tropical Medicine & International Health|format=Subscription required|volume=9|issue=5 |pages=539<U+2013>41|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118806521/HTMLSTART?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 (fulltext)|accessdate=2008-10-05 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01243.x}}</ref>

The most studied form of psychotherapy for depression is [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), thought to work by teaching clients to learn a set of useful cognitive and behavioral skills.

[[Interpersonal psychotherapy]] focuses on the social and interpersonal triggers that may cause depression. There is evidence that it is an effective treatment. The therapy takes a structured course with a set number of weekly sessions (often 12), the focus is on relationships with others.

=== Antidepressants ===
Prescription antidepressants are as effective as psychotherapy, although more patients cease medication than cease psychotherapy, most likely due to [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] from the medication.

To find the most effective antidepressant medication with tolerable or fewest side effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and, if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50<U+2013>75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to remission, when the patient is back to their normal self.<!--this study is from 2000- is there not something more recent?--><ref name=apaguidelines/> Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimise the chance of recurrence.<!--this study is from 2000- is there not something more recent?

====Criticism====
The effectiveness of antidepressants continues to be questioned.  They have not been conclusively shown to be more effective than [[placebo]], especially when unpublished studies are taken into account.  Their effectiveness has been shown to increase with the severity of the depression, and to reach clinical significance only in studies involving the most severely depressed, perhaps because the very severely depressed had a decreased response to the [[Placebo_effect#Placebo_effect|placebo effect]] rather than an increased response to the medication.<ref name="Kirsch08">{{cite journal |author=Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT |title=Initial severity and antidepressant benefits: A meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e45 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18303940 |pmc=2253608 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 |url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045&ct=1}}</ref>  An editorial in the ''[[BMJ]]'' drew attention to bias in the publication of studies showing antidepressant efficacy compared to unpublished studies where the data did not support efficacy.

Recurrence is more likely if symptoms have not fully resolved with treatment. Current guidelines recommend continuing antidepressants for four to six&nbsp;months after remission to prevent relapse.

Depression and [[pain]] often co-occur.  One or more pain symptoms is present in 65% of depressed patients, and anywhere from five to 85% of patients with pain will be suffering from depression, depending on the setting; there is a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics.

== History ==
{{main|History of depression}}

The Ancient Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] described a syndrome of melancholia as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms; he characterized all "fears and despondencies, if they last a long time" as being symptomatic of the ailment.<ref>Hippocrates, ''Aphorisms'', Section 6.23</ref> It was a similar but far broader concept than today's depression; prominence was given to a clustering of the symptoms of sadness, dejection, and despondency, and often fear, anger, delusions and obsessions were included.<ref name="Radden2003">{{cite journal |last=Radden |first=J |year=2003 |month=March |title=Is this dame melancholy?

The term ''depression'' itself was derived from the Latin verb ''deprimere'', "to press down".<ref>depress. (n.d.). Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved June 30, 2008, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress Dictionary.com]</ref> From the 14th&nbsp;century, "to depress" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author [[Richard Baker (chronicler)|Richard Baker's]] ''Chronicle'' to refer to someone having "a great depression of spirit", and by English author [[Samuel Johnson]] in a similar sense in 1753.<ref>{{cite news |author= Wolpert, L |title=Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> The term also came in to use in [[depression (physiology)|physiology]] and [[depression (economics)|economics]]. An early usage referring to a psychiatric symptom was by French psychiatrist [[Louis Delasiauve]] in 1856, and by the 1860s it was appearing in medical dictionaries to refer to a physiological and metaphorical lowering of emotional function.<ref name="pmid3074848">{{cite journal |author=Berrios GE |title=Melancholia and depression during the 19th&nbsp;century: A conceptual history |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=153 |pages=298<U+2013>304 |year=1988 |month=September |pmid=3074848 |doi=10.1192/bjp.153.3.298}}</ref> Since [[Aristotle]], melancholia had been associated with men of learning and intellectual brilliance, a hazard of contemplation and creativity. The newer concept abandoned these associations and, through the 19th&nbsp;century, became more associated with women.<ref name="Radden2003"/>

Although ''melancholia'' remained the dominant diagnostic term, ''depression'' gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as ''depressive states''.<ref name="Davison2006">{{cite journal |last=Davison |first=K|year=2006|title=Historical aspects of mood disorders |journal=Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115<U+2013>18 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1476179306700246}}</ref>

Sigmund Freud likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper ''Mourning and Melancholia''. He theorized that [[object (philosophy)|objective]] loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[narcissism|narcissistic]] process called the ''libidinal [[cathexis]]'' of the [[ego]]. Such loss results in severe melancholic symptoms more profound than mourning; not only is the outside world viewed negatively, but the ego itself is compromised.<ref name="Carhart-Harris08">{{cite journal |author=Carhart-Harris RL, Mayberg HS, Malizia AL, Nutt D |title=Mourning and melancholia revisited: Correspondences between principles of Freudian metapsychology and empirical findings in neuropsychiatry |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |volume=7|pages=9 |year=2008 |pmid=18652673 |pmc=2515304 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-7-9}}</ref> The patient's decline of self-perception is revealed in his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Richards A ''(ed.)'' |last=Freud|first= S|title=11.On Metapsychology: The Theory of Psycholoanalysis |chapter=Mourning and Melancholia|pages=245<U+2013>69 |publisher=Pelican |location=Aylesbury, Bucks |year=1984 |isbn=0-14-021740-1}}</ref> He also emphasized early life experiences as a predisposing factor.<ref name="Radden2003"/> Meyer put forward a mixed social and biological framework emphasizing ''reactions'' in the context of an individual's life, and argued that the term ''depression'' should be used instead of ''melancholia''.<ref name="Lewis1934">{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=AJ| year=1934|title=Melancholia: A historical review |journal=Journal of Mental Science |volume=80 |pages=1<U+2013>42|doi= 10.1192/bjp.80.328.1 |url= }}</ref> The first version of the DSM (DSM-I, 1952) contained ''depressive reaction'' and the DSM-II (1968) ''depressive neurosis'', defined as an excessive reaction to internal conflict or an identifiable event, and also included a depressive type of manic-depressive psychosis within Major affective disorders.<ref name="DSMII">{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-II |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |year=1968 |chapter=Schizophrenia |url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/DSMPDF/dsm-ii.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-03 |unused_data=|pp. 36<U+2013>37, 40}}</ref>

In the mid-20th century, researchers theorized that depression was caused by a [[chemical imbalance theory|chemical imbalance]] in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of [[reserpine]] and [[isoniazid]] in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Schildkraut | first = JJ|year=1965|title = The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: A review of supporting evidence |journal = American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=122 |issue=5| pages = 509<U+2013>22|pmid=5319766}}</ref>
