'''Intelligent design''' ('''ID''') is a form of [[creationism]] promulgated by the [[Discovery Institute]], a politically conservative [[think tank]] based in the [[U.S.]]<ref name="PM 09" /> The Institute defines it as the proposition that "certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as [[natural selection]]."<ref name=DI-topquestions>

Scientific acceptance of Intelligent Design would require redefining science to allow [[supernatural]] explanations of observed phenomena, an approach its proponents describe as theistic realism or [[theistic science]].

|quote=The intelligent design movement claims there are aspects of the natural world that are so intricate and fit for purpose that they cannot have evolved but must have been created by an 'intelligent designer'. Furthermore they assert that this claim is scientifically testable and should therefore be taught in science lessons. Intelligent design lies wholly outside of science. Sometimes examples are quoted that are said to require an 'intelligent designer'. However, many of these have subsequently been shown to have a scientific explanation, for example, the immune system and blood clotting mechanisms. Attempts to establish an idea of the 'specified complexity' needed for intelligent design are surrounded by complex mathematics. Despite this, the idea seems to be essentially a modern version of the old idea of the "God-of-the-gaps". Lack of a satisfactory scientific explanation of some phenomena (a 'gap' in scientific knowledge) is claimed to be evidence of an intelligent designer.}}</ref><ref>

==History==

===Origin of the concept===
{{See also|Teleological argument|Watchmaker analogy}}
The  [[teleological argument]], also known as the design argument, is one of three basic religious arguments for the existence of God which have been advanced for centuries (the others being the [[ontological argument]] and the  [[cosmological argument]]). In the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that natural things act to achieve the best result, and as they cannot do this without intelligence, an intelligent being must exist, setting the goal and providing direction, and this being is God. The version formulated in 1802 by the [[theology|theologian]] [[William Paley]] used the [[watchmaker analogy]] to argue that complexity and [[adaptation]] in nature demonstrated God's benevolent and perfect design, for the good of humans. Paley's [[natural theology]] strongly influenced scientists of the time, including [[Charles Darwin]], who began with the assumption that God had designed nature and were open to a [[deism|deistic]] interpretation that this design was implemented by laws. While Darwin's [[natural selection]] explained complexity and adaptation without the need for a designer, he was still inclined to think that everything resulted from designed laws,<ref>{{cite book | last = R.T. | first = Pennock, | title = Tower of Babel: the evidence against the new creationism | publisher = MIT Press | location = City | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-262-66165-9 |pages=60, 68<U+2013>70, 242<U+2013>245}}<br />{{cite court

}}, [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 24 of 139|Ruling pp. 24<U+2013>25]].</ref> by which Nature's God shaped life.  Intelligent design has Paley's religious argument from design at its centre, but unlike Paley's openness to deistic design through God given laws, the point of intelligent design is to seek scientific confirmation of repeated miraculous interventions in the history of life.<ref name="PM 09" />

By 1910 evolution was not a topic of major religious controversy in America, but in the 1920s [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] engaged in the [[Fundamentalist<U+2013>Modernist Controversy]] took up opposition to evolution,<ref name="PM 09" /> and effectively suspended teaching of evolution in U.S. public schools. In the 1960s, after evolution was reintroduced into the curriculum, [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationists]] promoted [[Creation Science]] as "an alternative scientific explanation of the world in which we live", which frequently invoked the design argument to explain complexity in nature. These explanations prefigured the intelligent design arguments of [[irreducible complexity]], even featuring the bacterial [[flagellum]]. Attempts to introduce this in schools led to court rulings that Creation Science is religious in nature, and thus cannot be taught in public school science classrooms. Intelligent design is also presented as science invoking Paley's religious argument from design. It shares other arguments with Creation Science but differs in avoiding overt literal Biblical references such as the age of the Earth and [[Noah's Flood]].<ref name="SM 07" />

[[Barbara Forrest]] writes that the intelligent design movement began in 1984 with the publication by Jon A. Buell's the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] of ''The Mystery of Life's Origin'' by [[Charles B. Thaxton]], a chemist and creationist. Thaxton held a conference in 1988, "Sources of Information Content in DNA", which attracted creationists such as [[Stephen C. Meyer]].<ref>Forrest, Barbara. [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/3/11/8448/52824 Know Your Creationists: Know Your Allies]</ref>

In March 1986, a review by Meyer used information theory to suggest that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell show "specified complexity" specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.<ref name="meyermolo">{{vcite web |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/meyer/sm_notalone.htm |title=We Are Not Alone |accessdate=2007-10-10 |author=Stephen C.

==Concepts==

===Irreducible complexity===
{{Main|Irreducible complexity}}
[[Image:MichaelBehe.jpg|thumbnail|right|The concept of irreducible complexity was popularised by [[Michael Behe]], in his 1996 book, ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]''.]]
The term "irreducible complexity" was introduced by biochemist [[Michael Behe]] in his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', though he had already described the concept in his contributions to the 1993 revised edition of ''Of Pandas and People''.<ref name="pandafounds" /> Behe defines it as "a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning".<ref>Behe, Michael (1997): ''Molecular Machines: Experimental Support for the Design Inference'' [http://www.apologetics.org/MolecularMachines/tabid/99/Default.aspx]</ref>

Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to illustrate this concept. A mousetrap consists of several interacting pieces<U+2014>the base, the catch, the spring and the hammer<U+2014>all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work. Removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Intelligent design advocates assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex systems, because the selectable function is present only when all parts are assembled. Behe argued that irreducibly complex biological mechanisms include the bacterial flagellum of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', the blood clotting cascade, [[cilia]], and the adaptive [[immune system]].<ref>Irreducible complexity of these examples is disputed; see Kitzmiller, pp. 76<U+2013>78, and [http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/01/ken_miller_webc.html Ken Miller Webcast]</ref><ref>The Collapse of "Irreducible Complexity" Kenneth R. Miller Brown University [http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/design2/article.html]</ref>

Critics point out that the irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary and therefore could not have been added sequentially.<ref name="reducibly complex mousetrap,Ussery"/> They argue that something that is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary as other components change. Furthermore, they argue, evolution often proceeds by altering preexisting parts or by removing them from a system, rather than by adding them. This is sometimes called the "scaffolding objection" by an analogy with scaffolding, which can support an "irreducibly complex" building until it is complete and able to stand on its own.<ref group="n">For example, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/312/5770/97 Bridgham ''et al.''] showed that gradual evolutionary mechanisms can produce complex protein-protein interaction systems from simpler precursors. {{vcite journal |author=Bridgham ''et al.'' |year=2006 |title=Evolution of Hormone-Receptor Complexity by Molecular Exploitation |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5770 |pages=97<U+2013>101 |doi=10.1126/science.1123348 |pmid=16601189 |last2=Carroll |first2=SM |last3=Thornton |first3=JW}}</ref>
Behe has acknowledged using "sloppy prose", and that his "argument against Darwinism does not add up to a logical proof".<ref group="n">{{vcite news | last=Orr | first=H. Allen | title=Devolution | work=[[The New Yorker]] | date=May 30, 2005 | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/30/050530fa_fact}} This article draws from the following exchange of letters in which Behe admits to sloppy prose and non-logical proof: {{vcite web |last=Behe |first=M. |coauthors=Dembski, Wells, Nelson, Berlinski |title=Has Darwin met his match?

Dover Area School District|Dover trial]], the court held that "Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large".<ref name="Kitzmiller v p. 64"/>

===Specified complexity===
{{Main|Specified complexity}}
In 1986 [[Charles Thaxton]], a physical chemist and creationist, used the term "specified complexity" from [[information theory]] when claiming that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell were specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.<ref name="meyermolo" />
The intelligent design concept of "specified complexity" was developed in the 1990s by mathematician, philosopher, and theologian [[William Dembski]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallis |first=Claudia |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1090909-3,00.html |title=The Evolution Wars |publisher=TIME |date=2005-08-07 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref> Dembski, Research Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Center for Cultural Engagement at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, states that when something exhibits specified complexity (i.e., is both complex and "specified", simultaneously), one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. He provides the following examples: "A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A [[Shakespearean]] [[sonnet]] is both complex and specified".<ref>Dembski. Intelligent Design, p. 47</ref> He states that details of living things can be similarly characterized, especially the "patterns" of molecular sequences in functional biological molecules such as [[DNA]].

[[Image:Dembski head shot.jpg|thumbnail|left|140px|[[William Dembski]] proposed the concept of [[specified complexity]].<ref>William Dembski, Photo by Wesley R. Elsberry, taken at lecture given at University of California at Berkeley, 2006/03/17.</ref>]]
Dembski defines [[complex specified information]] (CSI) as anything with a less than 1 in 10<sup>150</sup> chance of occurring by (natural) chance. Critics say that this renders the argument a [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]: complex specified information cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus, so the real question becomes whether or not CSI actually exists in nature.<ref>

===Fine-tuned Universe===
{{Main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
Intelligent design proponents have also occasionally appealed to broader teleological arguments outside of biology, most notably an argument based on the [[Fine-tuned universe|fine-tuning of universal constants]] that make matter and life possible and which are argued not to be solely attributable to chance. These include the values of [[fundamental physical constants]], the relative strength of [[nuclear force]]s, [[electromagnetism]], and [[gravity]] between [[fundamental particles]], as well as the ratios of masses of such particles. Intelligent design proponent and [[Center for Science and Culture]] fellow [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] argues that if any of these values were even slightly different, the universe would be dramatically different, making it impossible for many [[chemical elements]] and features of the [[Universe]], such as [[galaxies]], to form.<ref>

===Intelligent designer===
{{Main|Intelligent designer}}

Intelligent design arguments are formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid identifying the intelligent agent (or agents) they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Dembski, in ''[[The Design Inference]]'', speculates that an alien culture could fulfill these requirements. ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' proposes that [[SETI]] illustrates an appeal to intelligent design in science. In 2000, philosopher of science [[Robert T. Pennock]] suggested the [[Ra<U+00EB>lian beliefs and practices|Ra<U+00EB>lian]] [[UFO]] religion as a real-life example of an extraterrestrial intelligent designer view that "make[s] many of the same bad arguments against evolutionary theory as creationists".<ref>{{cite book | last = R.T. | first = Pennock, | title = Tower of Babel: the evidence against the new creationism | publisher = MIT Press | location = City | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-262-66165-9 |pages=229<U+2013>229, 233<U+2013>242}}</ref> The authoritative description of intelligent design,<ref group="n">

Beyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, [[Jerry Coyne]] asks why a designer would "give us a pathway for making [[vitamin C]], but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes" (see [[pseudogene]]) and why he or she would not "stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species". Coyne also points to the fact that "the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different" as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer.<ref name="CoyneTNR">

Previously, in ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', Behe had argued that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer's motives, so such questions cannot be answered definitively. Odd designs could, for example, "have been placed there by the designer ... for artistic reasons, to show off, for some as-yet undetectable practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason". Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, "either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved".<ref name="CoyneTNR" />

Intelligent design proponents such as [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul Nelson]] avoid the [[Argument from poor design|problem of poor design in nature]] by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design. Behe cites Paley as his inspiration, but he differs from Paley's expectation of a perfect Creation and proposes that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can. Behe suggests that, like a parent not wanting to spoil a child with extravagant toys, the designer can have multiple motives for not giving priority to excellence in engineering. He says that "the argument for imperfection critically depends on a psychoanalysis of the unidentified designer. Yet the reasons that a designer would or would not do anything are virtually impossible to know unless the designer tells you specifically what those reasons are." This reliance on inexplicable motives of the designer makes intelligent design scientifically untestable. [[Phillip E. Johnson]] puts forward a core definition that the designer creates for a purpose, giving the example that in his view [[AIDS]] was created to punish immorality and was not caused by [[HIV]], but such motives cannot be tested by scientific methods.<ref name="Pennock 245">{{cite book | last = R.T. | first = Pennock, | title = Tower of Babel: the evidence against the new creationism | publisher = MIT Press | location = City | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-262-66165-9 |pages=245<U+2013>249, 265, 296<U+2013>300}}</ref>

''"The social consequences of materialism have been devastating. As symptoms, those consequences are certainly worth treating. However, we are convinced that in order to defeat materialism, we must cut it off at its source. That source is scientific materialism. This is precisely our strategy. If we view the predominant materialistic science as a giant tree, our strategy is intended to function as a 'wedge' that, while relatively small, can split the trunk when applied at its weakest points. The very beginning of this strategy, the 'thin edge of the wedge,' was Phillip Johnson's critique of Darwinism begun in 1991 in Darwinism on Trial, and continued in [[Reason in the Balance]] and Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds. Michael Behe's highly successful Darwin's Black Box followed Johnson's work. We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID). Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions".''

The [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|Discovery Institute's intelligent design campaigns]] have been staged primarily in the United States, although efforts have been made in other countries to promote intelligent design. Leaders of the movement say intelligent design exposes the limitations of scientific orthodoxy and of the [[secular]] philosophy of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Intelligent design proponents allege that science should not be limited to naturalism and should not demand the adoption of a naturalistic [[Philosophy of science|philosophy]] that dismisses out-of-hand any explanation that includes a supernatural cause.

It's falsified by all of the evidence and the logic is terrible. When you realize that, the next question that occurs to you is, well, where might you get the truth? [...] I start with John 1:1.

Nearly all intelligent design concepts and the associated movement are the products of the Discovery Institute, which guides the movement and follows its [[wedge strategy]] while conducting its [[Teach the Controversy]] campaign and their [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|other related programs]].

Leading intelligent design proponents have made conflicting statements regarding intelligent design. In statements directed at the general public, they say intelligent design is not religious; when addressing conservative Christian supporters, they state that intelligent design has its foundation in the [[Bible]].<ref name=PJC group="n"/> Recognizing the need for support, the institute affirms its Christian, evangelistic orientation: "Alongside a focus on influential opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians. We will do this primarily through apologetics seminars. We intend these to encourage and equip believers with new scientific evidences that support the faith, as well as to 'popularize' our ideas in the broader culture."<ref name=wedge_doc group="n"/>

[[Barbara Forrest]], an expert who has written extensively on the movement, describes this as being due to the Discovery Institute's obfuscating its agenda as a matter of policy. She has written that the movement's "activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious world-view that undergirds it".<ref>

===Reaction from other creationist groups===
Not all creationist organizations have embraced the intelligent design movement. According to Thomas Dixon, "Religious leaders have come out against ID too. An open letter affirming the compatibility of Christian faith and the teaching of evolution, first produced in response to controversies in Wisconsin in 2004, has now been signed by over ten thousand clergy from different Christian denominations across America. In 2006, the director of the Vatican Observatory, the Jesuit astronomer George Coyne, condemned ID as a kind of 'crude creationism' which reduced God to a mere engineer."<ref>{{Cite book | last = Dixon | first = Thomas | title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2008 | location = Oxford | page = 82 | isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}</ref> [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]] of Reasons to Believe, a proponent of [[Old Earth creationism]], believes that the efforts of intelligent design proponents to divorce the concept from Biblical Christianity make its hypothesis too vague. In 2002 he wrote: "Winning the argument for design without identifying the designer yields, at best, a sketchy origins model. Such a model makes little if any positive impact on the community of scientists and other scholars<U+2026> The time is right for a direct approach, a single leap into the origins fray. Introducing a biblically based, scientifically verifiable creation model represents such a leap."<ref>

Likewise, two of the most prominent [[Young Earth creationism]] organizations in the world have attempted to distinguish their views from intelligent design. Henry M. Morris of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) wrote, in 1999, that ID, "even if well-meaning and effectively articulated, will not work! It has often been tried in the past and has failed, and it will fail today. The reason it won't work is because it is not the Biblical method." According to Morris: "The evidence of intelligent design<U+2026> must be either followed by or accompanied by a sound presentation of true Biblical creationism if it is to be meaningful and lasting."<ref>

A series of Gallup polls in the United States from 1982 through 2008 on "Evolution, Creationism, Intelligent Design" found support for "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced formed of life, but God guided the process" of between 35% and 40%, support for "God created human beings in pretty much their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so" varied from 43% to 47%, and support for "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in the process" varied from 9% to 14%.

===Film===
The film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' sparked further controversy in 2008. This [[documentary]] [[film]], hosted by [[Ben Stein]], presents allegations that the mainstream science establishment, in a conspiracy to keep God out of science laboratories and classrooms, suppresses academics who believe they see evidence of intelligent design in nature or criticize evidence of evolution.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news | author=[http://www.sej.org/confer/pitts/04Bios.htm Cornelia Dean] |title=Scientists Feel Miscast in Film on Life's Origin |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/science/27expelled.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin |work= |publisher= [[The New York Times]] |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-08 }}</ref> The film includes interviews with scientists and academics who were misled into taking part by misrepresentation of the topic and title of the film. [[Michael Shermer]] describes his experience of being repeatedly asked the same question without context as "surreal". Review screenings were restricted to churches and Christian groups, and at a special pre-release showing, one of the interviewees, [[PZ Myers]], was refused admission. The production company, Premise Media, also has helped finance some religious films such as ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] denounced the film's allegation that evolutionary theory influenced [[The Holocaust]].<ref>{{vcite web

Further criticism stems from the fact that the phrase ''intelligent'' design makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable intelligence, a concept that has no [[scientific consensus]] definition. William Dembski, for example, has written that "Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature". The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be observable without specifying what the criteria for the measurement of intelligence should be.  Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.<ref group="n">"For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon [[empirical evidence]] that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies".<U+2014>{{cite court

===Arguments from ignorance===
[[Eugenie Scott]], along with Glenn Branch and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent design proponents are [[Argument from ignorance|arguments from ignorance]].
In the argument from ignorance, a lack of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that "we don't know yet" is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science. Particularly, [[Michael Behe]]'s demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a [[false dichotomy]], where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. Scott and Branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.<ref name="2002-09-10">

In his conclusion to the Kitzmiller trial, Judge Jones wrote that "ID is at bottom premised upon a false dichotomy, namely, that to the extent evolutionary theory is discredited, ID is confirmed." This same argument had been put forward to support [[creation science]] at the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' trial which found it was "contrived dualism", the false premise of a "two-model approach". Behe's argument of irreducible complexity puts forward negative arguments against evolution but does not make any positive scientific case for intelligent design. It fails to allow for scientific explanations continuing to be found, as has been the case with several examples previously put forward as supposed cases of irreducible complexity.<ref>{{cite court

===Theological issues===
The insistence of intelligent design on repeated miraculous interventions rather than designed laws raises theological difficulties for those who believe that God's design must be perfect and should not need such changes. The claim to be scientific implies that science can test religion, and the [[problem of evil]] raises the issue of a lack of miraculous intervention to reduce suffering.<ref name="PM 09">{{cite doi|10.1042/bj20081534}} [http://www.biochemj.org/bj/417/0029/4170029.pdf .pdf]</ref> Intelligent design proponents avoid the problem of [[Argument from poor design|poor design in nature]] by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design, or by proposing that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can, and may have unknowable motives for their actions.<ref name="Pennock 245" />

=== God of the gaps ===
Intelligent design has also been characterized as a [[God of the gaps|God-of-the-gaps]] argument,<ref name="Stanford--GodoftheGaps">Del Ratzsch (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleological-arguments/#4.3 "Teleological Arguments for God's Existence", Section 4.3, The "Intelligent Design" (ID) Movement], in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</ref> which has the following form:
:*There is a gap in scientific knowledge.
:*The gap is filled with acts of God (or [[intelligent designer]]) and therefore proves the existence of God (or intelligent designer).<ref name="Stanford--GodoftheGaps"/>

A God-of-the-gaps argument is the [[theological]] version of an [[argument from ignorance]]. A key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers outstanding questions with explanations (often [[supernatural]]) that are unverifiable and ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable questions.<ref>See, for instance: {{vcite journal

[[History of science|Historians of science]] observe that the [[astronomy]] of the earliest [[civilization]]s, although astonishing and incorporating [[mathematics|mathematical construction]]s far in excess of any practical value, proved to be misdirected and of little importance to the development of science because they failed to inquire more carefully into the mechanisms that drove the [[astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] across the sky.<ref>Colin A. Ronan. ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the World's Science''. p. 61.</ref> It was the [[Greek civilization]] that first practiced science, although not yet a mathematically oriented experimental science, but nevertheless an attempt to rationalize the world of natural experience without recourse to divine intervention.<ref>Colin A.

==Kitzmiller trial==
{{Main|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District}}
''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' was the first direct challenge brought in the [[United States federal courts]] against a public school district that required the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to [[evolution]]. The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of [[creationism]], and that the school board policy thus violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name="NCSE 2008-17-10">[http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/intelligent-design-trial-kitzmiller-v-dover Intelligent Design on Trial: Kitzmiller v.

Eleven parents of students in [[Dover, Pennsylvania|Dover]], [[Pennsylvania]], sued the [[Dover Area School District]] over a statement that the school board required be read aloud in ninth-grade science classes when evolution was taught. The plaintiffs were represented by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] (AU) and [[Pepper Hamilton LLP]]. The [[National Center for Science Education]] (NCSE) acted as consultants for the plaintiffs. The defendants were represented by the [[Thomas More Law Center]].<ref>

On December 20, 2005, Judge Jones issued his 139-page [[finding of fact|findings of fact]] and decision, [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al.|ruling that]] the Dover mandate was unconstitutional, and barring intelligent design from being taught in Pennsylvania's Middle District public school science classrooms. The eight Dover school board members who voted for the intelligent design requirement were all defeated in a November 8, 2005, election by challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class, and the current school board president stated that the board does not intend to appeal the ruling.<ref>

In his finding of facts, Judge Jones made the following condemnation of the [[Teach the Controversy]] strategy:
<blockquote>"Moreover, ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a [[Wikt:canard#Noun|canard]]."</blockquote>

===Reaction===
Judge Jones himself anticipated that his ruling would be criticized, saying in his decision that:
<blockquote>"Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an activist judge. If so, they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court. Rather, this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill-informed faction on a school board, aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID, who in combination drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy. The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial. The students, parents, and teachers of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom, with its resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources."<ref name="kitz137">

As Jones had predicted, [[John G. West]], Associate Director of the [[Center for Science and Culture]] at [[Discovery Institute]], said:
<blockquote>"The Dover decision is an attempt by an activist federal judge to stop the spread of a scientific idea and even to prevent criticism of Darwinian evolution through government-imposed censorship rather than open debate, and it won't work. He has conflated Discovery Institute's position with that of the Dover school board, and he totally misrepresents intelligent design and the motivations of the scientists who research it."<ref>

In the first, David K. DeWolf, John G.

In April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K-12 Public Schools in the United States'', which included guidance that [[Creation Science]] or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as "Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning." However, they, as well as other "worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others."<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |date=July 23, 2010 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |quote= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref>

==Status outside the United States==

===Europe===
In June 2007 the [[Council of Europe]]'s "Committee on Culture, Science and Education" issued a report, ''The dangers of creationism in education'', which states "Creationism in any of its forms, such as 'intelligent design', is not based on facts, does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes."<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11297.htm |title=The dangers of creationism in education |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> In describing the dangers posed to education by teaching creationism, it described intelligent design as "anti-science" and involving "blatant scientific fraud" and "intellectual deception" that "blurs the nature, objectives and limits of science" and links it and other forms of creationism to [[denialism]]. On October 4, 2007, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly approved a resolution stating that schools should "resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion", including "intelligent design", which it described as "the latest, more refined version of creationism", "presented in a more subtle way". The resolution emphasises that the aim of the report is not to question or to fight a belief, but to "warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science".<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2007/10/council-europe-approves-resolution-against-creationism-001200 |title=NCSE Resource<U+2014>Council of Europe approves resolution against creationism |publisher=National Center for Science Education |date=October 4, 2007 |accessdate=2009-11-18}}

It's not the tasks of the politics to introduce new ideas, that's task and goal of science."<ref>De Morgen, May 23, 2005</ref>

===Relation to ISKCON===
In 2010 the [[ISKCON]] Bhaktivedanta Book Trust published an intelligent design book titled ''Rethinking Darwin: A Vedic Study of Darwinism and Intelligent Design'' chapters included contributions from intelligent design advocates [[William Dembski]], [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]] and [[Michael Behe]] as well as from Hindu creationists Leif A. Jansen and [[Michael Cremo]].<ref>[http://www.bbt.se/publication_others_RD.html Rethinking Darwin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Australia===
The status of intelligent design in Australia is somewhat similar to that in the UK (see [[Education in Australia]]). When the former Australian Federal Education Minister, [[Brendan Nelson]], raised the notion of intelligent design being taught in science classes, the public outcry caused the minister to quickly concede that the correct forum for intelligent design, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.<ref>
