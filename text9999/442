'''Vladim<U+00ED>r Remek''' (born 26 September 1948) is a Czech [[politician]] and [[diplomat]] as well as a former [[cosmonaut]] and [[Pilot (aircraft)#Military|military pilot]]. He flew aboard [[Soyuz 28]] from 2 to 10 March 1978, becoming the first Czechoslovak in space and the only Czech in space. As the first cosmonaut from a country other than the [[Soviet space program|Soviet Union]] or the [[NASA|United States]], and with the entry of the [[Czech Republic]] into the [[European Union]], Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the [[European Union]]. Remek was a member of the [[European Parliament]] between 2004 and 2013 and is also the current Czech Ambassador to Russia.
