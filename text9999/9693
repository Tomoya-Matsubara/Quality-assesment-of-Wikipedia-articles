'''Eduard Heis''' (born February 18, 1806, [[Cologne]]; died June 30, 1877 in [[M<U+00FC>nster]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] and [[astronomer]].

He completed his education at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1827, then taught mathematics at a school in Cologne. In 1832 he taught at [[Aachen]], and remained there until 1852. He was then appointed by [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|King Frederick William IV]] to a chair position at the [[University of M<U+00FC>nster|Academy of M<U+00FC>nster]] in 1852. In 1869 he became [[rector]] of the Academy.

While at the academy he made a series of observations of the night sky, including the [[milky way]], [[zodiacal light]], [[star]]s, and [[meteor|shooting stars]]. These were published in the following works, among others:

* ''Atlas Coelestis Novus'', Cologne, 1872.
* ''Zodiakal-Beobachtungen''.
* ''Sternschnuppen-Beobachtungen''.
* ''De Magnitudine'', 1852.

His star atlas, which was based on the ''Uranometria Nova'', helped define the [[constellation]] borders in the northern sky. His other publications included a treatise on the eclipses during the [[Peloponnesian war]], [[Halley's comet]], and some mathematical text books.

He was also the first person to record a count of the [[Perseid meteor shower]] in 1839, giving an hourly rate of 160. Observers have recorded the hourly count every year since that time.
