The first '''USS ''Essex''''' of the [[United States Navy]] was a 36-gun <ref>http://www.visit1812.com/historic-sites/usnm.html</ref> or 32-gun<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/robotti-essex.html</ref> [[sailing frigate]] that participated in the [[Quasi-War]] with France, the [[First Barbary War]], and in the [[War of 1812]], during which she was captured by the British in 1814 and served as '''HMS ''Essex''''' until sold at public auction on 6 June 1837.

The frigate was launched on 30 September 1799 by [[Enos Briggs]], [[Salem, Massachusetts]], at a cost of $139,362 subscribed by the people of Salem and [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]]. On 17 December 1799 she was presented to the United States Navy and accepted by Captain [[Edward Preble]].

==Service history==
With the United States involved in naval action against France on 6 January 1800, ''Essex'', under the command of Captain Edward Preble, departed [[Newport]], Rhode Island in company with {{USS|Congress|1799|2}} to rendezvous with a convoy of merchant ships returning from [[Jakarta|Batavia]], Dutch East Indies. Shortly after commencement of her journey, ''Essex'' became the first U.S. Naval Ship to cross the Equator.  ''Congress'' was dismasted only a few days out, and ''Essex'' was obliged to continue her voyage alone, making her mark as the first U.S. man-of-war to double the [[Cape of Good Hope]], both in March and in August 1800 prior to successfully completing her convoy mission in November.

===First Barbary War===
Captain [[William Bainbridge]] commanded ''Essex'' on her second cruise, whereon she sailed to the Mediterranean with the squadron of Commodore [[Richard Dale]]. Dispatched to protect American trade and seamen against depredations by the [[Barbary pirate]]s, the squadron arrived at [[Gibraltar]] on 1 July 1801 and spent the ensuing year convoying American merchantmen and blockading Tripolitan ships in their ports. Following repairs at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] in 1802, ''Essex'' resumed her duties in the Mediterranean under Captain [[James Barron]] in August 1804. She participated in the [[Battle of Derne]] on 27 April 1805, and remained in those waters until the conclusion of peace terms in 1806.

Returning to the Washington Navy Yard in July, she was placed [[in ordinary]] until February 1809 when she was recommissioned for sporadic use in patrolling American waters and a single cruise to Europe.

===War of 1812===
[[File:Uss essex.jpg|thumb|left|''Essex'' capturing the ''Alert''.]]
When war was declared against Britain on 18 June, 1812, ''Essex'', commanded by Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], made a successful cruise to the southward. On 11 July near [[Bermuda]] she fell in with seven British (the {{HMS|Silverside}} being one) transports and by moonlight engaged and took one of them as a prize. On 13 August she encountered and captured the sloop [[HMS Alert (1804)|HMS ''Alert'']] after an engagement. By September when she returned to New York, ''Essex'' had taken ten prizes.

''Essex'' sailed in South Atlantic waters and along the coast of [[Brazil]] until January 1813, decimating the British [[whaling]] fleet in the Pacific. Although her crew suffered greatly from a shortage of provisions and heavy gales while rounding Cape Horn, she anchored safely at [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]], Chile, on 14 March, having seized whaling schooners ''Elizabeth'' and ''Nereyda'' along the way. In the next five months, the ''Essex'' captured thirteen British whalers, including {{USS|Essex Junior||2}}, (ex-''Atlantic'') which cruised in company with her captor to the Island of [[Nuku Hiva|Nukahiva]] for repairs. Porter put his executive officer [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]] in command of that ship.

In January 1814, ''Essex'' sailed into neutral waters at Valpara<U+00ED>so, only to be trapped there for six weeks by the British frigate, {{HMS|Phoebe|1795|2}} (36 guns) and the sloop-of-war {{HMS|Cherub|1806|2}} (18 guns) under Captain [[James Hillyar]]. On 28 March 1814, Porter determined to gain the open sea, fearing the arrival of British reinforcements. Upon rounding the point, ''Essex'' lost her main top-mast to foul weather and was [[USS Essex vs HMS Phoebe|brought to action]] just north of Valpara<U+00ED>so.<ref name="navy.mil">http://www.navy.mil/search/display_word.asp?story_id=37263</ref> <ref name="Porter">[http://inportercounty.org/Data/PorterCountyCentennial/Sec1-4_PorterCoCenn-DavidPorterDiagram.html Account of Captain Porter's heroics], http://inportercounty.org/Data/PorterCountyCentennial/Sec1-4_PorterCoCenn-DavidPorterDiagram.html .</ref> For 2<U+00BD> hours, ''Essex'', armed almost entirely with powerful, but short range carronades (which Porter had complained to the Navy about on several occasions), resisted the enemy's superior fighting power and longer gun range. A fire erupted twice aboard the ''Essex'', at which point about fifty men abandoned the ship and swam for shore; only half of them landing. Eventually, the hopeless situation forced the frigate to surrender. The ''Essex'' suffered 58 dead and 31 missing of her crew of 154,<ref name="navy.mil"/> while the British casualties were 5 dead, 10 wounded.  One the crew members of the ''Essex'' present at this action was 12 year old Midshipman [[David Farragut]], the foster son of Captain Porter, who would rise to the rank of Admiral and achieve renown during the [[American Civil War]].

==British service==
''Essex'' was repaired and taken into the [[Royal Navy]] as HMS ''Essex'', and in 1833 served as a [[prison ship]] at [[D<U+00FA>n Laoghaire|Kingston, Ireland]]. On 6 June 1837 she was sold at public auction. During some recent resurfacing work on the east pier of D<U+00FA>n Laoghaire harbour the permanent mooring anchor of the ''Essex'' was discovered embedded in the pier.<ref>http://www.dlharbour.ie/content/history/essex/</ref>

==In literature and popular culture==
[[Herman Melville]] wrote about the ''Essex'' in "Sketch Fifth" in ''[[The Encantadas]]'', focusing on an incident off the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]] with an elusive British ship.  The story was first published in 1854 in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]''.

The story of the ''Essex'''s attack on British whalers was adapted by [[Patrick O'Brian]] for his novel ''[[The Far Side of the World]]''. The film adaptation of the novel, ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'', changed the American ship to a French one, presumably to help box office in the U.S.
