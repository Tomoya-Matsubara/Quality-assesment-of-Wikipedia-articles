"'''Everybody's Fool'''" is a song by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Evanescence]]. [[Wind-up Records]] released the song on June 7, 2004, as the fourth single from their debut studio album, ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]''. It was written by [[Amy Lee]] and [[Ben Moody]] and it was produced by [[Dave Fortman]]. According to Lee the song talks about celebrities like [[Britney Spears]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], who strip and sell their bodies. Inspired by her sister's love for music artists who had false images, Lee wrote the song five years before the release of the album. 

Critical reception towards "Everybody's Fool" were mixed to positive with critics praising the [[nu-metal]] sound of the song. The accompanying [[music video]] for "Everybody's Fool" was filmed in April, 2004 and it was directed by Philipp St<U+00F6>lzl. It showed Lee in the role of a model who had a completely false image for her life. It focused on the struggles that Lee's character suffers because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle. "Everybody's Fool" was added to the [[set list]] of the band's tour, Fallen Tour. A live version was also available on their first [[live album]], ''[[Anywhere but Home]]'' (2004).

==Background and release==
"Everybody's Fool" was written by [[Amy Lee]], [[Ben Moody]] and [[David Hodges]] and produced by [[Dave Fortman]].<ref name="windupbook" /> The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song.<ref name="windupbook" /> According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images.<ref name="cheesy" /> It has been misinterpreted as a message against [[Christianity|Christian]] faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band.<ref name="christianity" /> During an interview, Lee explained: "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song."<ref name="cheesy" /> She later revealed that the song was written for American [[pop music|pop]] singers [[Britney Spears]] and [[Christina Aguilera]]<ref name="mylastbreath" /> adding, "At this point, everybody knows that Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's about a lot of people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody looks like that. It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?".<ref name="age" /> According to the sheet music published by [[Alfred Music Publishing]] at the website Musicnotes.com, "Everybody's Fool" is written in the key of [[F major]].<ref name="sheet" /> It is set in a time signature of common time and performed in a [[tempo (music)|tempo]] of 92 beats per minute.<ref name="sheet" /> Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of [[A (musical note)|A<sub>3<sub>]] to the note of [[D (musical note)|D<sub>5<sub>]].<ref name="sheet" /> After the third single from ''Fallen'', "[[My Immortal]]" continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that "Imaginary" would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, "I think it's very epic. It's one of those big [[Aerosmith]] or [[Black Sabbath]] kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song."<ref name="mtv1483876" /> However, the release of "Imaginary" was scrapped and "Everybody's Fool" was released as the fourth single from ''Fallen'' on June 4, 2004,<ref name="release" /> while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.<ref name="maxi" /> 

==Reception==
{{Double image|left|Britney-Spears Boys.jpg|150|CA2010PREIMRE.jpg|127|During several interviews, Amy Lee and Ben Moody stated that "Everybody's Fool" was written five years before the release of ''Fallen'' and the theme behind the song were the lives of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.<ref name="mylastbreath" />}}
Johnny Loftus of [[Allmusic]] classified "Everybody's Fool" as a [[nu-metal]] song.<ref name="amg review" /> Adrien Begrand of [[PopMatters]] concluded that the song "take[s] things to a more over-the-top, theatrical level."<ref name="popmatters" /> Scott Juba of ''[[Web.com#Company history and acquisitions|The Trades]]'' rated the song with A, and wrote: "As far as the band's single, 'Everybody's Fool', is concerned, it is a song about the stinging betrayal of deception and the refusal to become blinded by deceit any longer. There is a defiance in Lee's voice that gives the track a bold edge, and the song's heavy drums and soaring guitars further enhance the strong sound. The band surely has another chart topping hit on their hands."<ref name="trades" /> Simon Cusens of [[ABC Online]] gave the song 3 out of 5 stars calling it "a cold, sad and angry song that I would only like to listen to without it being repeated again."<ref name="abc" /> Joe D'Angelo of [[MTV News]] wrote that "rolling acoustic guitar and billowing synthesizers pave the way for the harsh power chords that open the song" adding that Lee's voice was "disembodied" in the opening lines "Perfect by nature/ Icons of self-indulgence/ Just what we all need/ More lies about a world that/ Never was and never will be."<ref name="mtv1486942" /> The song peaked at number 36 on ''Bilboard''{{'}}s [[Alternative Songs]] chart on May 8, 2004.<ref name="Billboard-Alt" /> On June 13, 2004, "Everybody's Fool" debuted at number 23 on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]] which later became its peak position.<ref name="ausdeb" /> It spent five weeks on the chart appearing at number 42 in its last week on July 11, 2004.<ref name="auslast" /> On the [[UK Singles Chart]], "Everybody's Fool" debuted at number 24 on June 12, 2004 which later became its peak position.<ref name="chartstats" /> The next week, it fell at number 40<ref name="uksingles09-19" /> and it was last seen on the chart on June 26 at number 49.<ref name="chartstats" /> It also charted in other European countries upon its release.<ref name="eur" />

==Music video==
The accompanying [[music video]] for "Everybody's Fool" was directed by Philipp St<U+00F6>lzl and it was filmed in [[Los Angeles, California]] in mid-April 2004.<ref name="mtv1486942" /> Talking about the filming and the development of the video, Lee said: "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'"<ref name="cheesy" /> Lee added that the message of the video is in the name of the products her character is representing which is called, "Lies." because according to her "[... the] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie."<ref name="cheesy" /> 

Lee conceptualized the video around the lyrics to the song: "It's kind of about exposing that it's fake. And the video's more along the lines of exposing the real behind-the-scenes [lives] of some of these people. It's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed, selfish misery behind it. [...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out. But I still think it's relevant."<ref name="cheesy" /> Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that "fans will get to see Amy Lee like never before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon."<ref name="mtv1486942" /> Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called "Lies".<ref name="mtv1486942" /> The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.<ref name="mtv1486942" /> 

Before the music begins, Lee appears with blond hair, a baby-blue blouse and a long white skirt and emerges from the kitchen holding a fresh-from-the-oven frozen pizza, in a TV commercial. She presents the pizza to her family and, as the camera zooms in for a close-up, the brand name on the pizza box is visible and it is called Lies. "There is nothing better than a good lie," Lee says cheerily, through a smile.<ref name="mtv1486942" /> Scenes of Lee in her hotel room follow as she removes her makeup. Those scenes are followed by Lee wearing a "luxurious auburn tresses and dangling diamond earrings" as she plays a glamorous spokesmodel who violently scratches out her picture in magazines after the photo shoot has finished.<ref name="mtv1486942" /> She also portrays a motorcycle girl in a commercial who drinks a soft drink called "Lies" that affords its drinker the opportunity to "Be somebody."<ref name="mtv1486942" /> 

In another Japanese commercial she plays a Barbie with pink hair. Each scene ends with Lee crying. During the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], two girls are seen laughing at the model's appearance, stating that she looks much older than they thought she was. Another segment shows her breaking a mirror with her bare hand, which starts to bleed uncontrollably. In the final scene, she stands on the balcony of a building, crying and screaming at a billboard featuring one of her advertisements, saying that the model side of her isn't "real and you can't save me", and that everybody is oblivious to how she really lives.

==Live performances==
The song was part of the [[set list]] of Evanescence's first worldwide tour, Fallen Tour.<ref name="tour" /> An acoustic version is performed on the behind-the-scenes section on their first [[live album]], ''[[Anywhere but Home]]'' (2004) and another live version of the song from [[Le Z<U+00E9>nith]], [[Paris]] is also placed on the album.<ref name="anywhere" /><ref name="anyall" /> Johnny Loftus of Allmusic said that "when the guitars do show up (like on 'Everybody's Fool'), Lee matches their power easily."<ref name="anyall" />
