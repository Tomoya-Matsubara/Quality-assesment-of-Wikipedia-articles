The '''King Vulture''', ''Sarcoramphus papa'', is a large [[bird]] found in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. It is a member of the [[New World vulture]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Cathartidae]]. This vulture lives predominantly in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern [[Mexico]] to northern [[Argentina]], though some believe that [[William Bartram|William Bartram's]] [[#Bartram's "Painted Vulture"|Painted Vulture]] of [[Florida]] may be of this species. It is the only surviving member of the genus '''''Sarcoramphus''''', although fossil members are known.

Large and predominantly white, the King Vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail [[feather]]s. The head and neck are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The King Vulture has a very noticeable yellow fleshy [[Wattle (anatomy)|caruncle]] on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King Vultures have been known to live for up to 30 years in captivity.

King Vultures were popular figures in the [[Mayan codices]] as well as in local folklore and medicine. Although currently listed as Least Concern by the [[IUCN]], they are decreasing in number, due primarily to [[habitat loss]].

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The King Vulture was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' as ''Vultur papa'',<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=[[Systema naturae|Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

There are two theories on how the King Vulture earned the "King" part of its common name.

The exact [[systematic]] placement of the King Vulture and the remaining six species of [[New World vulture]]s remains unclear.<ref name="SACC"/> Though both are similar in appearance and have similar [[Ecological niche|ecological roles]], the New World and [[Old World vultures]] evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to [[storks]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Charles Sibley|Sibley, Charles G.]]; Monroe, Burt L..|year=1990|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300049692 |title= Distribution and Taxonomy of the Birds of the World|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-04969-2 |accessdate=11 April 2007}}</ref> More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order [[Falconiformes]] along with the Old World vultures<ref>[[Charles Sibley|Sibley, Charles G.]], and [[Jon Edward Ahlquist|Ahlquist, Jon E.]]. 1991.

=== Fossil record and evolution ===
The genus ''Sarcoramphus'', which today contains only the King Vulture, had a wider distribution in the past. The Kern Vulture (''Sarcoramphus kernense''), lived in southwestern [[North America]] during the mid-[[Pliocene]] ([[Piacenzian]]), some 3.5<U+2013>2.5 million years ago). It was a little-known component of the [[Blancan]]/[[Delmontian]] [[faunal stage]]s. The only material is a broken [[distal]] [[humerus]] [[fossil]], found at [[Pozo Creek]], [[Kern County, California]]. As per [[Loye H. Miller]]'s original description, "[c]ompared with [''S. papa''] the [[type (biology)|type]] conforms in general form and curvature except for its greater size and robustness."<ref name = miller1931>Miller, Loye H. (1931): Bird Remains from the Kern River Pliocene of California. ''[[The Condor (journal)|The Condor]]'' '''33'''(2): 70<U+2013>72. [http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v033n02/p0070-p0072.pdf PDF fulltext]</ref> The large span in time between the existence of the two species suggests that the Kern Vulture might be distinct, but as the fossil is somewhat damaged and rather non-diagnostic, even assignment to this genus is not completely certain.<ref name=Fisher44>Fisher, Harvey L.

Little can be said of the [[evolution]]ary history of the genus, mainly because remains of other [[Neogene]] New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The [[teratorn]]s held sway over the [[ecological niche]] of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern Vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the [[Great American Interchange]], and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in [[Central America]].<ref name = miller1931 /> The Kern Vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the ''S. fisheri <U+2013> S. papa'' lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral King Vultures and South American Condors separated at least some 5 [[mya (unit)|mya]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilbur | first = Sanford | title = Vulture Biology and Management | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1983 |page=6| isbn = 0-520-04755-9 }}</ref>

=== Bartram's "Painted Vulture" ===
[[Image:KingVultureBerlin.JPG|thumb|At [[Zoologischer Garten Berlin]]]]
A "'''Painted Vulture'''" ("'''''Sarcoramphus sacra'''''" or "'''''S. papa sacra'''''") is described in [[William Bartram]]'s notes of his travels in [[Florida]] during the 1770s. This bird's description matches the appearance of the King Vulture except that it had a white, not black, tail.<ref name="Harper">{{Cite journal  | last = Harper  | first = Francis  | authorlink = Francis Harper (biologist)  | title = The ''Vutlur sacra'' of William Bartram  | journal = Auk  | volume = 53  | issue = 4  | pages = 381<U+2013>392  | publisher = American Ornithologist<U+2019>s Union  | location = Lancaster, PA  | date = October 1936  | url = http://extinct-website.co.uk/pdf/p0381-p0392.pdf| accessdate = 2010-11-15 }}</ref> Bartram describes the bird as being relatively common and even claimed to have collected one.<ref name="Harper"/> However, no other naturalists record the Painted Vulture in Florida and sixty years after the sighting its validity began to be questioned, leading to what [[John Cassin]] described as the most inviting problem in North American ornithology.<ref name="Harper"/>

While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, [[Joel Asaph Allen]] argued that the Painted Vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed elements of different species to create this bird.<ref name="Harper"/> Allen pointed out that the birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara's.<ref name="Harper"/> For example, Bartram observed the birds following [[wildfire]]s to scavenge for burned insects and [[box turtle]]s. Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged King Vultures are not well adapted for walking. This bird was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is notably absent from Bartram's notes if the Painted Vulture is accepted as a ''Sarcoramphus''.<ref name="Harper"/> However, [[Francis Harper (biologist)|Francis Harper]] argued that the bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.<ref name="Harper"/>

Harper noticed that Bartram's notes were considerably altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the detail of the white tail appeared in print for the first time in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong.<ref name="Harper"/> Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a King Vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of [[extinct]]ion and finally disappeared during a cold spell.<ref name="Harper"/><ref name=" Day">Day, David (1981): ''The Doomsday Book of Animals'': Ebury, London/Viking, New York. ISBN 0-670-27987-0</ref> Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the Painted Vulture was a subspecies of the King Vulture.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = McAtee  | first = William Lee | title = Bartram<U+2019>s Painted Vulture  | journal = Auk  | volume = 59  | issue = 1  | page = 104  | publisher = American Ornithologist<U+2019>s Union  | location = Lancaster, PA  | date = January 1942  | url = http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v059n01/p0104-p0104.pdf| accessdate = 15 November 2010}}</ref>

=== Diet ===
The King Vulture eats anything from cattle carcasses to beached fish and dead lizards. In forests, it is likely to eat sloth. Principally a carrion eater, there are isolated reports of it eating injured animals, newborn calves and small lizards.<ref name=RotW/><!-- cites both previous sentences -->

Although it locates food by vision, the role smell has in how it specifically finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been that it does not detect odours, and instead follows the smaller [[Turkey Vulture|Turkey]] and [[Greater Yellow-headed Vulture]]s, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass,<ref name=HBW/><ref name="Strike ">{{cite journal| author =Beason, Robert C.| title = Through a Birds Eye: Exploring Avian Sensory Perception|publisher =University of Nebraska| year= 2003| url =http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=birdstrike2003| format = PDF| accessdate = 11 September 2007}}</ref> but a 1991 study demonstrated that the King Vulture could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an [[Olfaction|olfactory]] sense.<ref name=" Foraging ">{{Cite journal| last = Lemon| first = William C| title = Foraging behavior of a guild of Neotropical vultures| journal = Wilson Bulletin| volume = 103| issue = 4| pages = 698<U+2013>702| date= December 1991| url = http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Wilson/v103n04/p0698-p0702.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=13 March 2009}}</ref> The King Vulture primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a carcass, the King Vulture displaces the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill.<ref name=HBW/> However, when it is at the same kill as the larger [[Andean Condor]], the King Vulture always defers to it.<ref name=" EoC ">{{cite web| title = Ecology of Condors| url =http://www.ecology.info/condors.htm| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20061001235133/http://www.ecology.info/condors.htm| archivedate =1 October 2006| accessdate = 5 October 2006}}</ref>  Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh carcass. This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a carcass, access to the carcass after the King Vulture has fed.<ref name=HBW/><!-- cites two previous sentences --> The vulture<U+2019>s tongue is [[rasp]]-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass<U+2019>s bones.<ref name="Who"/> Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal.<ref name="ADW"/> The King Vulture has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the [[Moriche Palm]] when carrion is scarce in [[Bol<U+00ED>var (state)|Bol<U+00ED>var state]], Venezuela.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schlee, Marsha|title=King vultures (''Sarcoramphus papa'') forage in moriche and cucurit palm stands|journal=Journal of Raptor Research| volume=39|issue=4|pages=458<U+2013>61|year= 2005|url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/jrr/v039n04/p00458-p00461.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>

=== Breeding ===
The reproductive behaviour of the King Vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity,<ref name=deroy98>{{cite journal|author=de Roy, Tui|year=1998|title=King of the Jungle|journal=International Wildlife|issue=28|pages=52<U+2013>57|issn=0020-9112}}</ref> particularly at the Paris Menagerie.<ref name=schlee94>{{cite journal|author=Schlee, Marsha A. |year=1994|title=Reproductive Biology in King Vultures at the Paris Menagerie|journal=International Zoo Yearbook|issue=33|pages=159<U+2013>75}}</ref> An adult King Vulture sexually matures when it is about four or five years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males.<ref name = "Grady">{{Cite book  | last = Grady  | first = Wayne| title = Vulture: Nature<U+2019>s Ghastly Gourmet  | publisher = Sierra Club Books  | year = 1997  | location = San Francisco  | page = 47  | isbn =0-87156-982-5 }}</ref> The birds mainly breed during the dry season.<ref name="ADW"/> King Vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white [[egg (biology)|egg]] in its nest in a hollow in a tree.<ref name=" Howell "/> To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling.<ref name=deroy98/> Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-[[altricial]]<U+2014>they are helpless when born but are covered downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.<ref name=schlee94/><!-- cites previous six sentences -->

== Conservation ==
This bird is a species of Least Concern to the [[IUCN]], with an estimated range of 14&nbsp;million&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (5.4&nbsp;million&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>) and between 10,000 and 100,000 wild individuals. However, there is evidence that suggests a decline in population, though it is not significant enough to cause it to be listed.<ref name="BirdLife"/> This decline is due primarily to [[habitat destruction]] and [[poaching]].<ref name=" Eureka "/> Although distinctive, its habit of perching in tall trees and flying at altitude render it difficult to monitor.<ref name=HBW/>
