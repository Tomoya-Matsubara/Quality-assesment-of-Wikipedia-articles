'''Another Rainbow Publishing''' is a company dedicated to the re-publication and greater recognition of the work of [[Carl Barks]] that was created in 1981 by Bruce Hamilton and [[Russ Cochran (publisher)|Russ Cochran]]. Its name references Barks's saying that there would be "always another rainbow" for his character [[Scrooge McDuck]], which also became the title of one of Barks's oil paintings of the richest duck in the world<ref>[http://www.carlbarks.ws/images/armini/alwaysanotherrainbow.html ''Always another rainbow''], oil painting by Carl Barks</ref>. Its subsidiary division "[[Gladstone Publishing]]", founded in 1985, for non-Barks Disney comics several times throughout the 1980s and 1990s became the major to only publisher of Disney comics in the USA.

Having finished the thirty-volume ''[[Carl Barks Library]]'', Another Rainbow Publishing is no longer an active publisher, although they still sell previously published works.

== Publications ==

In 1983 Another Rainbow published the entire [[Disney comics|Disney comic book]] works of Barks<U+2014>over 500 stories in all<U+2014>in the ten-set, thirty-volume ''Carl Barks Library''. These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks' pages in pristine black and white [[line art]], as close as possible to the way he had originally drawn them, and included many special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, and critiques. This project was completed in mid-1990. Another Rainbow subsidiary Gladstone publishing completed the re-publication of Barks's entire work, this time in color, from 1992 to 1998.

Another Rainbow Publishing also produced and issued the award-winning book ''The Fine Art of Walt Disney's Donald Duck by Carl Barks'', a comprehensive collection of the Disney duck paintings of this artist and storyteller. Not long after, the company began producing [[fine art]] lithographs of many of these paintings, in strictly [[Special edition|limited editions]], all signed by Barks, who eventually produced many original works for the series. 

== Disney Figurines ==

Having established itself as a publisher of specialty books and lithographs based on the works of Carl Barks, Another Rainbow launched an ambitious project of creating limited edition bone-china figurines based on Barks Disney characters - especially "Uncle" Scrooge McDuck and Donald Duck. Connoisseur of Malvern (UK), which also produced figurines for Buckingham Palace and the Whitehouse, manufactured 7 of these figurines (Under Carl Barks direction) which ranged in price from $1980 to $19,500. The earlier releases sold out rapidly - although, there were a number of later editions unsold by the time Another Rainbow's license with Disney expired. 

In 2001, all of these figurines were destroyed due to a licensing disagreement with the new management at the [[Walt Disney Company]].<ref>[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&m=1&c=34&s=265&ai=41499&arch=y&ssd=7/27/2002%2012:01:00%20PM ''Destruction Under Another Rainbow''], at ''Scoop: Where the magic of collecting becomes alive!''

== Gladstone Publishing ==

In 1985 a new division was founded, "[[Gladstone Publishing]]", which took up the then-dormant Disney comic book license. Gladstone published Disney comic books by Barks, [[Paul Murry]], and [[Floyd Gottfredson]], and also presented the first works of modern Disney comics masters [[Don Rosa]] and [[William Van Horn]]. Gladstone's books were also among the first in the United States to regularly include Disney comics produced in Europe. The company was based in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], but moved in 1987 to [[Prescott, Arizona]].
