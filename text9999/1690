[[File:Bottomley-trafalgar-square.jpg|thumb|Horatio Bottomley addressing a wartime public meeting in [[Trafalgar Square]]]]
'''Horatio William Bottomley''' (23 March 1860&nbsp;<U+2013> 26 May 1933) was a British financier, swindler, journalist, editor, newspaper proprietor, and [[Member of Parliament]]. He is best known for his editorship of the popular magazine ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull]]'', and for his patriotic oratory during the First World War. His career came to a sudden end when, in 1922, he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.

Bottomley spent five years in an orphanage before beginning his career, aged 14,  as an errand boy. Subsequent experience as a solicitor's clerk gave him a useful knowledge of English law, which he later put to effective use in a number of court appearances. After working as a shorthand writer and court reporter, at 24 he founded his own publishing company which launched numerous magazines and papers including, in 1886, the ''[[Financial Times]]''. He overreached himself with an ambitious [[Initial public offering|public flotation]] of his company, which led to his first arraignment on fraud charges  in 1893. Despite evidence of malpractice, Bottomley, who defended himself, was acquitted. He subsequently amassed a fortune as a promoter of shares in gold-mining companies.

In 1906 Bottomley entered parliament as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] member for [[Hackney South (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South]]. In the same year he founded the popular magazine ''John Bull'', which became a platform for Bottomley's trenchant populist views. Financial extravagance and mismanagement continued to blight his career, and in 1912 he had to resign from parliament after being declared bankrupt. The outbreak of war in 1914 revived his fortunes; as a journalist and orator Bottomley became a leading propagandist for the war effort, addressing well over 300 public meetings. His influence was such that it was widely expected that he would enter the War Cabinet, although he received no such offer.

In 1918, having been discharged from bankruptcy, Bottomley re-entered parliament as an Independent member. In the following year he launched his fraudulent "Victory Bonds" scheme which, when exposed, led to his conviction,  imprisonment and expulsion from parliament. Released in 1927, he attempted unsuccessfully to relaunch his business career, and eked a living by lecturing and appearances in music halls. His final years before his death in 1933 were spent in poverty.

Bottomley was born on 23 March 1860, at 16, St Peter's Street, [[Bethnal Green]] in London, the second child and only son of William Bottomley, a tailor's cutter, and Elizabeth, n<U+00E9>e Holyoake.<ref name= ODNBhb>{{cite web|last= Morris|first= A.J.A.|title= Bottomley, Horatio William|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31981?docPos=1|publisher= The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|date= January 2011|accessdate= 16 June 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> William Bottomley's background is obscure, but Elizabeth belonged to a family of well-known radical agitators<U+2014>her brother [[George Jacob Holyoake]] was a founder of the [[Secularism|Secularist]] movement  and in later life  a leading figure in the growth of [[History of the cooperative movement|Co-operative societies]].<ref>Messinger, p. 201</ref><ref name= ODNBgjh>{{cite web|last= Royle|first= Edward|title= Holyoake, George Jacob|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33964?docPos=1|publisher= The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|date= January 2011|accessdate= 16 June 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> Among Holyoake's close associates was [[Charles Bradlaugh]], who founded the National Republican League and became a controversial Member of Parliament.<ref name= ODNBcb>{{cite web|last= Royle|first= Edward|title= Bradlaugh, Charles|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3183?docPos=1 |publisher= The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|date= January 2011|accessdate= 16 June 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio's biological father<U+2014>a suggestion that Bottomley, in later life, was prone to encourage.<ref>Symons, p. 15</ref> The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.<ref>Hyman, pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref><ref name= P80>Parris, p. 80</ref>

William Bottomley died in 1864 and Elizabeth  a year later. Horatio and his elder sister, Florence, were initially looked after by their uncle William Holyoake, an artist living in the   London district of [[Marylebone]]. After a year they were boarded out to foster-parents, at their uncle George Jacob's expense. This arrangement lasted until 1869, when  Florence was formally adopted by her foster-family. At this point Holyoake felt unable to continue supporting Horatio financially, and arranged for him to be admitted to [[Josiah Mason]]'s  orphanage in [[Erdington]], [[Birmingham]].<ref name= P80>Parris, p. 80</ref><ref>Hyman, pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref> This was Horatio's home for the following five years. Some biographers have emphasised the  cruelty and humiliation of his time there;<ref name= ODNBhb/><ref name= P80/> however, while discipline was certainly harsh, Horatio received a useful basic education, and won prizes for sporting activities. In later life he showed no resentment towards the institution, which he often visited, telling the children that "any success I have achieved in life started at this place."<ref>Hyman, pp. 13<U+2013>16</ref>

In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due to leave the orphanage, he ran away without waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill<U+2014>his mother's sister<U+2014>who lived in nearby [[Edgbaston]], gave him a home, while he worked   as an errand boy in a Birmingham building firm. This arrangement lasted only a few months before Horatio,  impatient  to be reunited with his sister from whom he had been separated for six years, went to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.<ref name= R18>Hyman, pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref>

===Early career===

====First steps====
Bottomley soon gave up his apprenticeship, and after a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a [[City of London|City]] firm of [[solicitors]]. Here he picked up a working knowledge of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior.<ref>Hyman, p. 20</ref> With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].<ref>Hyman, p. 21</ref> Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.<ref>Messinger, p. 202</ref>

In 1880 Bottomley married Eliza Norton, the daughter of a debt collector. Bottomley's biographers have tended to regard this early, unambitious marriage as a mistake on his part; she was not equipped, intellectually or socially, to help him advance in the world.<ref name= S17/>  In the same year, Bottomley left his job to become a full-time shorthand writer for Walpole's, a firm that provided recording and transcription services for the law courts. His competence impressed his employers sufficiently for them, in 1883, to offer him a partnership, and the firm became Walpole and Bottomley.<ref>Hyman, pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref><ref name= M203>Messinger, p. 203</ref> As Bottomley emerged from adolescence to maturity he began to show signs of the characteristics that would be much in evidence in his later life: greed for fleshly pleasures, a thirst for fame, spontaneous generosity, combined with a charm that, according to his biographer [[Julian Symons]], could "tempt the banknotes out of men's pockets".<ref name= S17>Symons, p. 17</ref>

====Publishing entrepreneur====

Bottomley's association with Bradlaugh had awakened his interests in publishing and politics, and in 1884 he launched his first entrepreneurial venture, a magazine called the ''Hackney Hansard''. This journal recorded the business of Hackney's local "parliament"<U+2014>essentially a debating society that mirrored the proceedings at Westminster. Advertisements from local tradesmen kept the paper mildly profitable. Bottomley  produced a sister-paper, the ''Battersea Hansard'', covering that borough's local parliament, before merging the two into ''The Debater''.<ref>Hyman, p. 28</ref> In 1885 he formed the Catherine Street Publishing Association and, using borrowed capital, acquired or started several magazines and papers. These included, among others, the ''Municipal Review'', a prestigious local government publication; ''Youth'', a boy's paper on which [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Alfred Harmondsworth]], the future press magnate Lord Northcliffe, worked as a sub-editor; and the ''[[Financial Times]]''.<ref>Symons, pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref> The last-named was set up to rival the ''[[Financial News]]'', London's first specialist business paper, which had been started in 1884 by Harry Marks, a former sewing-machine salesman.<ref>Robb, p. 116</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Porter|first= Dilwyn|title= Marks, Harry Hananel|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47898|publisher= The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|date= January 2011|accessdate= 17 June 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> In 1886 Bottomley's company acquired its own printing works through a merger with the printing firm of MacRae and Co., and after the absorption of another advertising and printing firm, became MacRae, Curtice and Company.<ref>Hyman, p. 29</ref>

At the age of 26, Bottomley became the company's chairman.<ref>Symons, p. 3</ref> His advance in the business world was attracting wider notice, and  in 1887 he was invited by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] to be their candidate in a parliamentary by-election. He accepted, and although defeated, fought a strong campaign which won him a congratulatory letter from [[William Gladstone]].<ref name= M203/> His business affairs were proceeding less serenely; he quarrelled with his partner Douglas MacRae, and the two decided to separate. Bottomley described the "Quixotic impulse" that led him to let MacRae divide the assets: "He was a printer, and I was a journalist<U+2014>but he took the papers and left me the printing works".<ref name= H30>Hyman, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref>

====Hansard Publishing Union====
[[File:Sir henry hawkins.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir Henry Hawkins, the judge before whom Bottomley appeared, and was acquitted, on fraud charges in 1893]]
Undismayed by the loss of his papers, Bottomley embarked on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of  a lucrative contract to print the [[Hansard]] reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, [[Initial public offering|floated]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]] with a capital of <U+00A3>500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor-elect of London]],<ref name= T218>Taylor 2013, p. 218</ref> Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|Evening News]]'',<ref>Cook, p. 80</ref> and [[Roper Lethbridge|Sir Roper Lethbridge]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[Kensington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Kensington North]].<ref name= H30/> This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of  several printing businesses<U+2014>he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions.<ref name= H31/> He also persuaded the board to give him <U+00A3>75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired.<ref>Symons, p. 7</ref> These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of <U+00A3>40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.<ref name= H31>Hyman, pp. 31<U+2013>35</ref>

The funds for the dividend payment were raised by a [[debenture]] of <U+00A3>50,000. By the end of 1890 many City figures were suspicious of the Hansard Union, and were calling it "Bottomley's swindle". Despite Bottomley's outward optimism,  in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the debenture holders  petitioned for the company's compulsory winding-up.<ref name= T218/> In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least <U+00A3>100,000 from the company, filed a petition for [[Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom|bankruptcy]]. Under examination by the [[Official Receiver]], he could not say where the money had gone, and professed total ignorance of the company's book-keeping. After further enquiries, the [[Board of Trade]] instituted prosecutions for fraud against Bottomley, Isaacs and two others.<ref name= H31/>

The trial began in the [[High Court of Justice]] on 30 January 1893, before [[Henry Hawkins, 1st Baron Brampton|Sir Henry Hawkins]]; Bottomley conducted his own defence.<ref>Hyman, p. 36</ref> To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable.<ref name= ODNBhb/><ref name= H31/> It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for far less than the prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and  had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed  him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company.<ref name= T219>Taylor  2013, p. 219</ref><ref name= S26>Symons, pp. 26<U+2013>33</ref> On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.<ref>Hyman, pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref>

===Company promoter, newspaper proprietor, would-be politician===
The Hansard Union case, far from damaging Bottomley's reputation, had left a general impression that he was a financial genius.<ref>Symons, p. 36</ref> He avoided the stigma of bankruptcy by arranging a scheme of repayment with his creditors,<ref>Symons, p. 48</ref> and swiftly embarked on a new career promoting Western Australian gold mining shares.<ref name= H56>Hyman, p. 56</ref>  The discovery of gold in [[Kalgoorlie]] and adjoining areas in the early 1890s had created an easily exploitable investment boom; as Bottomley's biographer Alan Hyman observes, "A hole in the ground&nbsp;... could be boosted into a very promising gold-mine, and investors only found that they had backed a loser after the mine had been floated as a public company and they had paid hard cash for their shares".<ref name= H56/> By 1897, through skilful exploitation of demand and by frequent reconstruction of failing companies, Bottomley had accumulated a considerable personal fortune. It was, the historian [[A. J. A. Morris|A.J.A. Morris]] asserts, "a truly amazing success story, the product of reckless audacity, astonishing energy, and extreme good fortune".<ref name= ODNBhb/> Bottomley won plaudits when he announced that he would pay <U+00A3>250,000 to the creditors of the Hansard Union; the bulk of this payment, however, was offered in shares in one or other of his mining promotions.<ref>Hyman, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref>
[[File:St Bedes UpperDicker.jpg|thumb|Bottomley's country home, "The Dicker", photographed in 2010. It forms part of St Bede's School.]]
As his wealth increased, Bottomley adopted an increasingly ostentatious lifestyle. In London he lived in a luxurious apartment  in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]. He took numerous mistresses, whom he visited in a number of discreet flats in different districts of London.<ref>Hyman, pp. 59 and 61</ref> He owned several racehorses, who achieved prestigious victories<U+2014>the [[Stewards' Cup (Great Britain)|Stewards' Cup]] at [[Goodwood Racecourse|Goodwood]], and the [[Cesarewitch Handicap|Cesarewitch]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]]<U+2014>but he often lost large sums through unwise bets.<ref>Symons, pp. 41<U+2013>42</ref> Quite early in his rise to wealth he bought a modest property in [[Upper Dicker]], near [[Eastbourne]] in [[East Sussex]]. He called it "The Dicker", and over the years  extended and developed it into a large country mansion, where he entertained extravagantly.<ref>Hyman, p. 58</ref>

Bottomley had retained his parliamentary ambitions and in 1890, before the Hansard Union crash, had been adopted as the Liberal candidate for [[Islington North (UK Parliament constituency)|North Islington]]. According to Symons, when he resigned the candidature on the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, he had the constituency in his pocket.<ref>Symons, p. 20</ref> By 1900 his star was again in the ascendant, and he was invited by the [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|South Hackney]] Liberals  to be their candidate in that year's [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|general election]]. He lost by only 280 votes, after a bitterly fought campaign in which Bottomley was described in a newspaper article as a "bare-faced swindler&nbsp;... [whose]&nbsp;... place is at the Old Bailey, not at Westminster". He was subsequently awarded <U+00A3>1,000 libel damages against the writer, Henry Hess.<ref>Hyman, pp. 72<U+2013>74</ref>

By the turn of the 19th<U+2013>20th centuries the boom in speculative shares had abated; some of Bottomley's fellow promoters, such as [[Whitaker Wright]], were facing charges of fraud and misrepresentation.<ref name= R110>Robb, p. 110</ref> Bottomley ceased his operations, and resumed his earlier role of newspaper proprietor. In 1902 he bought a failing London evening paper, ''[[The Sun (1893<U+2013>1906)|The Sun]]'',<ref name= H80>Hyman, pp. 80<U+2013>82</ref> to which he contributed a regular column, "The World, the Flesh and the Devil". Another feature was Bottomley's employment of celebrity guest editors for special edition; among these were the comedian [[Dan Leno]], the cricketer [[Ranjitsinhji|Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji]] and the labour leader [[Ben Tillett]].<ref>Symons, pp.&nbsp;64<U+2013>65</ref> The paper was not a financial success, and   Bottomley   sold it in 1904.<ref name= H80/> He had not given up altogether on speculative money-making schemes, and in 1905 he began an association with the financier [[Ernest Terah Hooley|Ernest Hooley]]. Among their joint enterprises was the promotion of the defunct, dry [[Basingstoke Canal]] as a major inland waterway, the "London and South-Western Canal".<ref name= R110/> Bottomley later made a substantial out-of-court settlement of an action brought by investors who had bought worthless shares in the canal.<ref>Symons, pp. 112<U+2013>13</ref>{{#tag:ref|Hooley's and Bottomley's paths would cross several times in future years; they were inmates together in Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1922.<ref>Searle 1987, p. 11</ref>| group=n}}

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election of January 1906]] Bottomley was again the Liberal candidate for Hackney South. After a vigorous campaign he defeated his Conservative opponent by more than 3,000<ref>Symons, p. 70</ref><U+2014>the largest Liberal majority in London, he informed the House of Commons in his maiden speech on 20 February 1906.<ref name= Hansard06/> According to Hyman, this speech was received in "chilling silence" by a House that was well aware of Bottomley's chequered reputation.<ref>Hyman, p. 76</ref> Over the following months and years he overcame much of the initial hostility, partly by his self-deprecating good humour (as when he described himself as "more or less honourable")<ref name= ODNBhb/> but also because his populist approach to legislation was attractive. He proposed rational reforms of the betting industry and of licensing hours, and the introduction of state Old Age Pensions.

[[File:Ernest Terah Hooley Vanity Fair 1896-12-17.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.7|Ernest Hooley, the financier who was Bottomley's partner in a number of schemes]]

Alongside his parliamentary duties, Bottomley was engaged in launching his biggest and boldest publishing venture, the weekly news magazine ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull]]'', half of the initial capital for which was provided by Hooley.<ref>Symons, p. 75</ref> From its first issue on 12 May 1906 ''John Bull'' adopted a [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] style that, despite occasional lapses in taste,  proved immensely popular.<ref>Hyman, pp. 83<U+2013>84</ref> Among its regular features, Bottomley revived his "The World, the Flesh and the Devil" column from ''The Sun'', and also adapted that paper's slogan: "If you read it in John Bull, it is so".<ref>Symons, p. 78</ref> Bottomley persuaded [[Julius Elias, 1st Viscount Southwood|Julius Elias]], managing director of [[Odhams Press|Odhams Limited]], to handle the printing, but chaotic financial management meant that Odhams were rarely paid. This situation was resolved when  the entire management of the magazine, including the handling of all receipts and payments, was transferred to Elias,<ref>Hyman, p. 94</ref><ref>Symons, pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref> leaving Bottomley free to concentrate on editing and journalism. Circulation rose rapidly, and by 1910 had reached half a million copies.<ref>Symons, p. 79</ref>

In June 1906 Bottomley announced the John Bull Investment Trust, in which, for a minimum subscription of <U+00A3>10, investors could share "that special and exclusive information which is obtainable only as the result of extensive City experience".<ref>Hyman, p. 86</ref> However, Bottomley's earlier City activities were coming under scrutiny, particularly the multiple reconstructions of his now-bankrupt Joint Stock Trust Company. After a long investigation, which Bottomley did all he could to frustrate, in December 1908 he was summoned to appear  at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall Justice Room]], before a court of aldermen.{{#tag:ref|Under English law, the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the City of London were empowered to act as magistrates.<ref>Halsbury, p. 575</ref> | group=n}} As with the Hansard prosecution, the case against Bottomley appeared overwhelming; share issues in the Joint Stock Trust had been repeatedly re-issued, perhaps as many as six times. Once again, however, Bottomley succeeded in obscuring the details and, by the power of his courtroom oratory, persuaded the court that the summons should be dismissed.<ref>Symons, pp. 87<U+2013>96</ref><ref>Taylor 2013, p. 255</ref>

One of the prosecuting team at the Guildhall observed that it would be a long time before anyone risked another prosecution against Bottomley: "But he might&nbsp;... grow careless, and then he will fail".<ref>Hyman, p. 119</ref>  Despite the adverse publicity, Bottomley was returned by the electors of Hackney South at each of the two 1910 general elections; his tactics included recruiting men in   boots tipped and heeled with iron, who marched outside his opponent's meetings and rendered the speeches inaudible.<ref name= Spec>{{cite journal|last= Parris|first= Matthew|title= He was a shameless liar and thief.

Bottomley's parliamentary ambitions were suddenly halted in 1912, when he was successfully sued for <U+00A3>49,000 by one of his Joint Stock Trust victims. Unable to pay, and with massive debts, he was bankrupted with liabilities totalling <U+00A3>233,000.<ref>Hyman, p. 130</ref> Since bankrupts are ineligible to sit in the House of Commons, he had to resign his seat; after his departure the future [[Lord Chancellor]], [[F.

Searle has observed that Smith, later Lord Birkenhead, always had a soft spot for Bottomley, in whom he may have seen certain of his own characteristics.<ref>Searle 1987, p. 341</ref>| group=n}} Prior to his bankruptcy, Bottomley had ensured that his main assets were legally owned by relatives or nominees, and was thus able to continue his extravagant lifestyle.<ref name= R110/><ref>Symons, pp. 134<U+2013>35</ref> ''John Bull'' remained an ample source of funds, and Bottomley boasted that although nominally bankrupt, "I never had a better time in my life<U+2014>plenty of money and everything else I want as well".<ref>Hyman, p. 134</ref>

===Sweepstakes and lotteries===
After leaving the House of Commons, Bottomley denounced parliament in the pages of ''John Bull'' as a "musty, rusty, corrupt system" that urgently needed replacement.<ref name= ODNBhb/> Through his newly formed Business League he addressed large crowds as he called for government run by businessmen not politicians.<ref>Hyman, pp. 133<U+2013>34</ref> As always, Bottomley's lifestyle required fresh sources of income, and in 1912 ''John Bull'' began to organise  competitions for cash prizes.<ref name= Mess206/> Bottomley successfully sued the secretary of the Anti-Gambling League for suggesting that many of the prizewinners were ''John Bull'' nominees or employees, but received only a [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] in damages.<ref>Symons, pp. 137<U+2013>39</ref>{{#tag:ref|The farthing was the smallest coin in UK legal tender, worth one quarter of a [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pre-1971 penny]].

Bottomley insisted this was a  coincidence; years later, it was revealed that all but <U+00A3>250 of the  prize had been paid into a bank account controlled by Bottomley.<ref>Symons, pp. 145<U+2013>149</ref>

===First World War:  orator and propagandist===
[[File:BottomleyDaily Mirror1915.jpg|thumb|left| Front page of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 10 September 1915, illustrating Bottomley's public meetings on behalf of the war effort.]]
Bottomley initially misread the international crisis that developed during the summer of 1914. After the murder of the Austrian [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] on 28 June in [[Sarajevo]], allegedly with [[Serbia]]n complicity, ''John Bull''  described Serbia  as "a hotbed of cold-blooded conspiracy and subterfuge",  and called for it to be wiped from the map of Europe. When Britain declared war on the [[Central Powers]] on 4 August, Bottomley quickly reversed his position, and within a fortnight was demanding the elimination of Germany. ''John Bull'' campaigned relentlessly against the "Germhuns", and against British citizens carrying German-sounding surnames<U+2014>the danger of "the enemy within" was a persistent Bottomley theme.<ref>Searle 2004, p. 723</ref> On 14 September 1914 he addressed a large crowd at the [[Peacock Theatre|London Opera House]],  the first of many mass meetings at which he deployed his trademark phrase, "the Prince of Peace, pointing to the Star of Bethlehem that leads us on to God"<U+2014>words which according to Symons moved many hearts.<ref>Symons, pp. 173<U+2013>74</ref><ref>Messinger, p. 208</ref> At the "Great War Rally" at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 14 January 1915, Bottomley was fully in tune with the national temper when he proclaimed: "We are fighting all that is worst in the world, the product of a debased civilisation".<ref>Wussow, p. 74</ref><ref>Searle 1987, p. 241</ref>

During the war, in his self-appointed role as spokesman for the "man in the street",<ref name= Monger234>Monger, p. 234</ref> Bottomley addressed more than 300 public meetings, in all parts of the country.<ref>Searle 2004, p. 768</ref> For recruitment rallies he provided his services free; for others, he took a percentage of the takings.<ref name= M209>Messinger, pp. 209<U+2013>10</ref>{{#tag:ref|Hyman quotes a summary, provided by ''The Daily News'', of the financial details of a meeting in Swindon. Total takings after Entertainment Tax were <U+00A3>125, of which <U+00A3>88 went to Bottomley and the balance (<U+00A3>37) to a servicemen's benevolent fund.<ref>Symons, p. 183</ref> Messinger records that Bottomley generally pocketed between 65 and 85 per cent of the proceeds of these meetings.<ref name= M209/>| group=n}} His influence was enormous; the writer [[D.H. Lawrence]], who detested Bottomley, thought that he represented the national spirit and that he might become prime minister.<ref>Wussow, p. 73</ref> In March 1915 Bottomley began a regular weekly column for the ''[[Sunday Pictorial]]''.<ref>Hyman, p. 162</ref> On 4 May, after the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sinking of the ''Lusitania'']], he used this column to label the Germans as "unnatural freaks", and called for their extermination. Britain's war effort, he maintained, was being hampered by squeamish politicians; he reserved particular venom for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leaders, [[Keir Hardie]] and [[Ramsay Macdonald]], who opposed the war, and demanded they be tried for high treason. Macdonald's riposte<U+2014>to label Bottomley "a man of doubtful parentage who had lived all his life on the threshold of jail"<U+2014>backfired when the latter published Macdonald's birth certificate which showed that the Labour leader was himself illegitimate.<ref>Symons, pp. 168<U+2013>69</ref>

Although the government was wary of Bottomley it was prepared to make use of his influence and popularity. In April 1915 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[David Lloyd George]] asked him to speak to shipworkers on the [[River Clyde]], who were threatening industrial action. After Bottomley's intervention the strike was averted.<ref name= M209/> In 1917 he visited the front in France, where after dining  with [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field-Marshal Haig]] he was a considerable success with the troops, as he was later when he visited the [[Grand Fleet]] at [[Scapa Flow]].<ref>Symons, pp. 199<U+2013>200</ref> He hoped that these morale-boosting activities would lead to a formal government position, but although from time to time there were rumours of a Cabinet post, no appointment was announced.<ref name= M211>Messinger, p. 211</ref><ref>Hyman, p. 192</ref> In the later stages of the war Bottomley was a regular critic of the National War Aims Committee (NWAC), a cross-party parliamentary body formed in 1917 to revitalise Britain's commitment to victory and to underline the justice of its cause.<ref>Monger, p. 235</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Purdue|first= A.W.|title= ''Book review'': Patriotism and Propaganda in First World War Britain: The National War Aims Committee and Civilian Morale|url= http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/421808.article|journal= The Times Higher Education Supplement|date= 15 November 2012}}</ref> Bottomley described the committee as "a dodge for doctoring public opinion", and in January 1918 told Lloyd George, who had become prime minister in December 1916, that NWAC had failed in its purpose and should be replaced by a Director of Propaganda<U+2014>but to no avail.<ref name= Monger234/>

===Postwar career===

====Parliament again====
Although in 1912 Bottomley had  expressed contempt for parliament, he privately hankered to return.<ref>Hyman, p. 133</ref> When the war ended in November 1918 and a general election was announced, he knew that to be a candidate in that election he needed a discharge from his bankruptcy. A payment of <U+00A3>34,000 in cash and bonds, and some hasty reorganisation of outstanding debts, was sufficient for an acquiescent Official Receiver to grant the discharge just in time for Bottomley to hand in his nomination papers in South Hackney.<ref>Symons, p. 205</ref> In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|general election on 14 December 1918]] he stood as an Independent, under the slogan "Bottomley, Brains and Business", and achieved a massive victory, with almost 80 per cent of the votes cast. "I am now prepared to proceed to Westminster to run the show", he informed a local newspaper. He would be, he said, the "unofficial prime minister&nbsp;... watching the government's every move" to ensure that it acted in the interests of "our soldiers, sailors and citizens".<ref>Hyman, pp. 194<U+2013>95</ref>

The 1918 parliament was dominated by [[Lloyd George ministry|Lloyd George's Liberal-Conservative coalition]], which faced a fragmented and unorganised opposition.<ref name= S222>Symons, pp. 222<U+2013>24</ref> In May 1919 Bottomley announced the formation of his "People's League", which he hoped would develop into a fully-fledged political party with a programme opposing both organised labour and organised capital.<ref name= Cow53>Cowling, p. 53</ref> No mass movement emerged, but Bottomley joined with other Independent MPs to form the [[Independent Parliamentary Group]], with a distinct  policy stance including the enforcement of war reparations, the superiority of Britain over the [[League of Nations]], exclusion of undesirable aliens, and "the introduction of business principles into government".<ref name= S222/> The group was reinforced through by-election victories of other Independents<U+2014>including [[Charles Frederick Palmer]], ''John Bull''{{'}}s deputy editor, until his premature death in October 1920.<ref>Symons, p. 221</ref> Bottomley was, at least for a year or so, a diligent parliamentarian who spoke on a range of issues, and from time to time teased the government as when, during the [[Irish War of Independence|Irish Troubles]], he asked whether, "in view of the breakdown of British rule in Ireland, the government will approach America with a view to her accepting the mandate for the government of that country".<ref>{{cite journal|journal= Hansard|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1920/may/03/government-policy#S5CV0128P0_19200503_HOC_213|title= Government Policy|volume= 128|pages= col. 1701|date= 3 May 1920}}</ref> On other occasions he helped the government, as when in January 1919, he was called upon in his role of "Soldier's Friend" to help pacify troops in [[Folkestone]] and [[Calais]] who were in a state of mutiny over delays in their demobilisation.<ref>Taylor 1970, p. 187</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Sewell|first= Rob|title= 1919: Britain on the Brink of Revolution|url= http://www.marxist.com/1919-britain-on-the-brink-of-revolution.htm|publisher= International Marxist Tendency|date= 16 May 2013|accessdate= 30 June 2014}}</ref>

====Downfall====
[[File:JohnBullCartoon1919.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.2|''John Bull'' advertises Bottomley's "Victory Bonds" scheme, 12 July 1919]]
In July 1919  Bottomley announced his "Victory Bonds Club", based on the government's latest issue of [[War Bond|Victory Bonds]]. Normally, these bonds cost <U+00A3>5; in Bottomley's club, subscribers bought units for a minimum payment of <U+00A3>1, and participated in an annual draw for prizes<U+2014>up to <U+00A3>20,000, he said<U+2014>funded from  accrued interest.<ref>Hyman, pp. 195<U+2013>96</ref> Contrary to Bottomley's public statements, not all the money subscribed was used to buy bonds. He had ambitions to become a press baron, to rival such as the Lords [[Viscount Rothermere|Rothermere]] and [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]]. In October 1919 he used  War Bonds funds to buy two obscure newspapers, the ''National News'' and the ''Sunday Evening Telegram''. The papers  were not financially successful, and in 1921 Bottomley closed the ''Telegram'' and changed the name of the ''National News'' to ''Sunday Illustrated''.<ref name= S213>Symons, pp. 213<U+2013>14</ref> To bolster its fortunes, he transferred his ''Sunday Pictorial'' column to the ''Illustrated'', and mounted an expensive promotional campaign, but with little benefit. The paper languished, while  Bottomley lost the large income and readership that went with the ''Pictorial''.<ref>Hyman, p. 212</ref> His fortunes declined further when, in 1920, Odhams revoked the pre-war partnership agreement and took full control of ''John Bull''. Bottomley was made editor for life, but a year later Odhams terminated this arrangement with a final pay-off of <U+00A3>25,000, which ended Bottomley's  connection  with the paper.<ref>Symons, pp. 230<U+2013>31</ref><ref>Hyman, p. 232</ref>

Meanwhile, dogged by poor administration and inadequate accounting, the Victory Bonds Club was sliding into chaos.  Public unease grew, and soon hundreds of subscribers were demanding their money back<U+2014>slipshod record-keeping meant that some were repaid several times over.<ref>Hyman, pp. 197<U+2013>98 and 208<U+2013>09</ref> Bottomley's position worsened when he fell out with Bigland, after refusing to finance his former associate's scheme for turning water into petrol.<ref>Robb, p. 111</ref> The two had quarrelled during the war, when Bigland had attacked Bottomley in print.<ref>Hyman, pp. 168<U+2013>69</ref> They had later reconciled,<ref>Hyman, pp. 181<U+2013>82</ref> but after their second dispute Bigland turned vengeful.  In September 1921 he published a leaflet describing the War Bond Club as Bottomley's "latest and greatest swindle".<ref>Symons, p. 236</ref> Against the advice of his lawyers, Bottomley sued for criminal libel, and brought other charges against Bigland of blackmail and extortion.<ref>Parris, p. 83</ref> The preliminary hearing, at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] in October 1921, at which Bottomley's methods were revealed, proved disastrous to his credibility.<ref name= ODNBhb/> Nevertheless, Bigland was committed for trial at the [[Old Bailey]] on the libel charge, and to Shropshire Assizes on charges of attempted extortion.<ref>Hyman, p. 231</ref> The libel trial began on 23 January 1922; to prevent further damaging disclosures in court, Bottomley's lawyers offered no evidence, and Bigland was discharged.<ref>Symons, p. 243</ref> The extortion case went ahead in [[Shrewsbury]] on 18 February 1922, at the end of which it took the jury only three minutes to find Bigland not guilty.  Bottomley, himself now under police investigation, was ordered to pay the costs of the trial. A few days afterwards, he was summoned to appear at Bow Street, on charges of fraudulent conversion of Victory Bond Club funds. After a brief hearing he was committed for trial at the Old Bailey.<ref>Hyman, pp. 249<U+2013>51</ref>

===Final years===
[[File:Bottomley-court.jpg|thumb|left|Bottomley in court, after his sentencing; a depiction by the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]
Bottomley's trial began on 19 May 1922, before [[Arthur Salter (judge)|Mr Justice Salter]]. As the case was beginning, Bottomley secured the agreement of the prosecuting counsel, [[Travers Humphreys]], to a 15-minute adjournment each day so that he, Bottomley, could drink a pint of champagne, ostensibly for medicinal purposes.<ref>Humphreys, p. 219</ref> He faced 24 fraud charges, involving amounts totalling <U+00A3>170,000.<ref>Hyman, pp. 253 and 272</ref> The prosecution produced evidence that he had regularly used Victory Bonds Club funds to finance business ventures, private debts and his expensive lifestyle.<ref>Symons, pp. 249<U+2013>51</ref><ref>Hyman, p. 255</ref> Bottomley, who defended himself, claimed that his legitimate expenses in connection with the club, and repayments made to Victory Bonds Club members, exceeded total receipts by at least <U+00A3>50,000: "I swear I have never made a penny out of it. I swear before God that I have never fraudulently converted a penny of the Club's money".<ref>Hyman, p. 258</ref> The weight of evidence suggested otherwise; Salter's summing up, described by a biographer as "masterly; lucid and concise, yet complete",<ref>{{cite web|last1= Hanbury|first1= H.G.|last2= Mooney|first2= Hugh|title= Salter, Sir Arthur Clavell|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35918?docPos=2|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|accessdate= 2 July 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> went heavily against Bottomley, and the jury required only 28 minutes to convict him on all but one of the charges. He was sentenced to seven years' [[Penal labour|penal servitude]].<ref>Symons, p. 254</ref> Humphreys commented later: "It was not I that floored him, but Drink".<ref>Humphreys, p. 218</ref>

After the dismissal of his appeal in July, Bottomley was expelled from the House of Commons. The [[Leader of the House of Commons|Leader of the House]], [[Sir Austen Chamberlain]], read out a letter in which Bottomley insisted that, however unorthodox his methods, he had not been guilty of  conscious fraud; he accepted, however, that his predicament was entirely his own fault. Chamberlain then moved Bottomley's expulsion, which was carried without dissent. One member expressed regret, "remembering the remarkable position which he [had] occupied in the country".<ref>{{cite journal|journal= Hansard|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1922/aug/01/mr-horatio-bottomley-expelled-the-house|title= Mr Bottomley Expelled the House|volume= 157|pages= col. 1285<U+2013>88|date= 1 August 1922 }}</ref> Bottomley spent the first year of his sentence in [[Wormwood Scrubs]] where he sewed mailbags,{{#tag:ref|Bottomley's stint sewing mailbags is the source of what Symons terms the best-known of all Bottomley stories. A visitor, variously described as a Home Office inspector, a personal friend, a prison chaplain, etc., observed him at work, and remarked "Ah, Bottomley, sewing?" <U+2013> to which he replied at once: "No, reaping". Symons believes that "in spite of its apocryphal sound", the story is essentially true, and illustrates Bottomley's wit and resilience.<ref>Symons, p. 260</ref><ref>Hyman, p. 279</ref>| group=n}} and the remainder in [[HM Prison Maidstone|Maidstone prison]] where, although conditions were squalid, he was given lighter work.<ref>Hyman, p. 280</ref> He was released on 29 July 1927, after serving just over five years, and returned to The Dicker, still his family home.<ref>Symons, p. 262</ref><ref name= H282>Hyman, pp. 282<U+2013>83</ref>

Although now 67 years old and in indifferent health, Bottomley tried to resurrect his business career. He raised sufficient capital to start a new magazine, ''John Blunt'', as a rival to ''John Bull'', but the new venture lasted little more than a year before closing, having lost money from the start.<ref>Hyman, pp. 286<U+2013>87</ref> In September 1929 he began an overseas lecture tour, which failed utterly, as did an attempt at a British tour during which he was received with indifference or hostility. By 1930 he was again bankrupt; his wife Eliza died that year, after which Bottomley's former son-in-law Jefferson Cohn evicted him from The Dicker.<ref name= S270>Symons, pp. 270<U+2013>71</ref>{{#tag:ref|In 1979 The Dicker was acquired by [[St Bede's School, Sussex|St Bede's School]] to house the newly established St Bede's Senior School.<ref>{{cite web|title= Why Does Anyone Want To Go To Your School?|url= http://www.hmc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/St-Bedes-leaflet-11.pdf|publisher= The [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]|accessdate= 3 July 2014}}</ref> | group=n}} For the remaining years of his life he lived with his long-time mistress, the actress Peggy Primrose, whom Bottomley, in his years of riches, had vainly tried to promote to stardom.<ref>Hyman, pp. 199<U+2013>200 and 288</ref>

Bottomley's last public venture was an engagement at the [[Windmill Theatre]] in September 1932, where he performed a monologue of reminiscences that, according to Symons, puzzled rather than amused his audience.<ref name= S270/> Following a health breakdown, he lived with Primrose in quiet poverty until his final illness. He died in the [[Middlesex Hospital]] on 26 May, and was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] a few days later. A large crowd heard the Revd Basil Bourchier express the hope that "no one here today will forget what Mr Bottomley did to revive the spirits of our men at the Front".<ref>Hyman, pp. 289<U+2013>90</ref> Four years later, in accordance with Bottomley's wishes, Primrose scattered the ashes on the [[South Downs|Sussex Downs]].<ref>Symons, p. 273</ref>

==Appraisal==

{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote= If [Bottomley] had a humbug of his own, he made mincemeat of the humbug of others, excoriating the more extreme claims made on behalf of the League of Nations, dismissing most forces in international politics except those based on power and ridiculing the naivest sorts of Labour claim to have discovered an inexhaustible supply of wealth and wages.|salign = left|source= Maurice Cowling: ''The Impact of Labour: 1920<U+2013>1924''.<ref name= Cow53/>  }}
Bottomley's obituaries dwelt on the common theme of wasted talent: a man of brilliant natural abilities, destroyed by  greed and vanity. "He had personal magnetism, eloquence, and the power to convince", wrote his ''[[Daily Mail]]'' obituarist. "He might have been a leader at the Bar, a captain of industry, a great journalist. He might have been almost anything".<ref>''Daily Mail'' obituary, May 1933, quoted in Hyman, p. 290</ref> ''[[The Straits Times]]'' of Singapore thought that Bottomley could have rivalled Lloyd George as a national leader: "Though he deserved his fate, the news of his passing will awaken the many regrets for the good which he did when he was Bottomley the reformer and crusader and the champion of the bottom dog".<ref>{{cite news|title= Death of Horatio Bottomley|url= http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19330527.2.77.aspx|newspaper= The Straits Times|date= 27 May 1933|page= 13}}</ref> A later historian, [[Maurice Cowling]], pays tribute to Bottomley's capacity and industry, and to his forceful campaigns in support of liberty.<ref name= Cow53/> In his sketch for the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'',   Morris  delivers a different judgement: "[H]e claimed to serve the interests of others, but sought only his own gratification".<ref name= ODNBhb/>

Among Bottomley's principal biographers, Hyman suggests that his financial fecklessness and disregard for consequences may have originated from his deprived background and sudden acquisition of wealth in the 1890s. "Success went to his head and he started spending money like a drunken sailor and could never break the habit." It was a wonder, says Hyman, that he stayed out of prison as long as he did.<ref>Hyman, pp. 291<U+2013>92</ref> Searle speculates that Bottomley was protected from prosecution because of his knowledge of wider scandals in the government, particularly after Lloyd George's coalition assumed power in 1916.<ref>Searle 1987, p. 338</ref> Symons acknowledges Bottomley's "wonderfully rich public personality" but suggests that there was no substance behind the presentation: throughout his adult life, Bottomley was "more a series of public attitudes than a person".<ref>Symons, p. 274</ref> [[Matthew Engel]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' notes his ability to charm the public  even while swindling them; one victim, cheated of <U+00A3>40,000, apparently insisted: "I am not sorry I lent him the money, and I would do it again". If London had had a mayor in those days, says Engel, Bottomley would have won in a landslide.<ref>{{cite news|authorlink= Matthew Engel|last= Engel|first= Matthew|title= Absolute bounders we have loved|url= http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/30/archer.politics|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 30 November 1999}}</ref>

Bottomley was the subject of an episode in the 1972<U+2013>73 BBC television series ''The Edwardians'', transmitted on 28 November 1972. The part of Bottomley was played by [[Timothy West]], with Mitzi Rogers as Peggy Primrose and [[John Welsh (actor)|John Welsh]] as Mr Justice Hawkins.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Edwardians: Horatio Bottomley|url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1265368/|publisher= IMDb|accessdate= 4 July 2014}}</ref>
