==Critical reception==
Upon its release, "Russian Roulette" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Todd Martens of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described "Rihanna's command performance" as "[a] midtempo song without overbearing production, the single belongs all to Rihanna, and she makes the best of it <U+2013> a bit icy, a tad fearless, with the vocal strength to keep the orchestral flourishes at bay."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/10/rihanna-reveals-russian-roulette.html|title=Rihanna reveals new single, 'Russian Roulette'|last=Martens|first=Todd|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher= [[Tribune Company]]|date= 2009-10-20|accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref> [[MTV News]] stated "it retains the same sort of attitude and atmosphere that has made Rihanna such a definitive artist."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/10/20/rihanna-russian-roulette-poll/ |title=Is Rihanna<U+2019>s <U+2018>Russian Roulette<U+2019> A Keeper?

However, Andy Kellman of [[Allmusic]] stated that in the song Rihanna had a sudden desire to provoke: "Even with the realization that it is metaphorical, the song startles with its hesitant gasps, spinning cylinders, and verses that are glacially paced, where a cold piano line and the slight inflections in Rihanna's voice are front and center."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/rated-r-r1700065|title= ''Rated R'' <U+2013> Rihanna|last= Kellman|first= Andy|work= [[All Music]]|publisher= [[All Media Guide]] ([[Rovi Corporation|Rovi]])|accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref> [[Pitchfork]]'s Ryan Dombal suggested that "the single is a bad [[C<U+00E9>line Dion]] song with barrel-turning revolver noises that actually sound like a can of spray paint being shook up".<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11578-russian-roulette/|title=Rihanna <U+2013> Russian Roulette <U+2013> Review|last=Dombal|first=Ryan|work=[[Pitchfork]]|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=2009-10-22|accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref> Rob Harvilla of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' also stated that "Russian Roulette" is a spare, suspenseful, violent torch song, that makes for profoundly unpleasant listening.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-11-24/music/sympathy-for-lady-vengeance-rihanna-s-rated-r/|title= Review: ''Rated R''|last= Harvilla|first= Rob|work= [[The Village Voice]]|publisher= [[Village Voice Media]]|date=2009-11-24|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>
