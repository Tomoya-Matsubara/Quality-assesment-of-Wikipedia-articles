'''Airport''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: <U+6A5F><U+5834>; [[Jyutping]]: gei1 coeng4; [[pinyin]]: j<U+012B> ch<U+00E1>ng) was the western [[terminal station|terminus]] [[List of Hong Kong MTR stations|station]] on '''[[Airport Express (MTR)|<font color="#119190">Airport Express</font>]]''' of [[Hong Kong]]'s [[MTR]], before the opening of the [[AsiaWorld-Expo (MTR)|AsiaWorld-Expo]] station on [[20 December]] [[2005]]. It serves the [[Hong Kong International Airport]]. The station is integrated with the Passenger Terminal of the airport, and for the convenience of the travellers, no exit or entry gates are installed. Therefore, travellers can walk straight into the terminal building through the exit for their check-in procedures. (If they have not completed In-Town Check-in.) Ticket baskets are provided on the departure level for the travellers to dump their used tickets in. A souvenir shop is also found there.

Platform 3 has been constructed opposite to platform 1 to allow for access to [[Hong Kong SkyCity|SkyPlaza]] and Terminal 2. The new platform started operation on February 28, 2007<ref>http://mtr.com.hk/eng/corporate/file_rep/PR-07-012-E.pdf Press Release for Platform 3 opening</ref> when the additional check-in facilities opened at Terminal 2. Airport Express trains stopping at the station now opens its two doors simultaneously for both platforms - doors on the left opens for travellers going to Terminal 1, and doors on the right opens for travellers going to SkyPlaza (Terminal 2).
