'''Games Day''' is a yearly run convention sponsored by [[Games Workshop]]. It has its origins in [[1975]], following the indefinite shelving of another games convention scheduled for August that year and a decision by Games Workshop to fill the resulting gap by running a gaming day of their own.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jackson | first = Steve | authorlink = Steve Jackson (UK) | title = Ed's Page | journal =[[Owl and Weasel]] | issue = 4 | pages = 7 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = May 1975 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Pardoe | first = Darroll | authorlink = | title = Wargames | journal =Checkpoint | issue = 60 | pages =  | publisher =  | date = March 12, 1975 | url = http://checkpoint.ansible.co.uk/cp060.html | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2008-08-28 }}</ref> As a result, after some delays, the first Games Day was held at Seymour Hall, [[London]] on [[December 20]], [[1975]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Games Day Programme | journal =[[Owl and Weasel]] | issue = 11 | pages = | publisher = Games Workshop | date = Dec 1975 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref>

Following this successful start and encouraged by mainstream media coverage<ref name="Times751222">{{Cite newspaper The Times|section=The Times Diary|articlename=Play time|day_of_week=Mon|date=Dec 22 1975|page_number=10|issue=59584|column=G}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Livingstone | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Livingstone | title = Games Day | journal =[[Owl and Weasel]] | issue = 12 | pages = 3 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = Jan 1976 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref>, the second Games Day was held at a different venue, [[Chelsea]] Town Hall, London, on [[February 12]], [[1977]] - somewhat delayed again owing to the logistics of running a rapidly expanding business - followed rapidly by a separate "[[Dungeons and Dragons|D&D]] Day" at [[Fulham]] Town Hall on [[March 12]]; this being their core funding stream at that time.

Nowadays, much like the [[Grand Tournament]], it is an event that enthusiasts of Games Workshop's three main games ([[Warhammer 40,000]], [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|Warhammer]], [[Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game|Lord of the Rings]]) can attend and play games. The event also includes presentations by special guests from the Games Workshop head office in [[Nottingham]].

The dealer's area includes products from [[Citadel Miniatures]], and commonly have displays of armies for all the systems scheduled for release in the next month or two.  

The [[Golden Demon]] painting competition is held during Games Days. Typically, other competitions of varying degrees of seriousness are also run such as the Scrap Demon competition. Competitors in this event are supplied with plastic sprues and are expected to make a model based on a category given. 

The United Kingdom event has been held regularly at the [[National Exhibition Centre]], [[Birmingham]].

Within the US, Games Days are held at [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]; [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; and [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

In [[Canada]], the venue is the Queen Elizabeth Building at Exhibition Place in [[Toronto, Ontario]].
