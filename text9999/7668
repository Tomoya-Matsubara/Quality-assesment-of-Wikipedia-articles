'''SM ''U-70''''' was a [[German Type U 66 submarine|Type U 66]] [[submarine]] or [[U-boat]] for the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during the [[World War I|First World War]]. She had been [[keel laying|laid down]] in February 1914 as '''''U-11''''' the final boat of the [[U-7 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-7'' class]] for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und K<U+00F6>nigliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}) but was sold to Germany, along with the others in her class, in November 1914.

The submarine was ordered as ''U-11'' from [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] of [[Kiel]] as the last of five boats of the ''U-7'' class for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Navy became convinced that none of the submarines of the class could be delivered to the [[Adriatic]] via [[Gibraltar]]. As a consequence, the entire class, including ''U-11'', was sold to the German Imperial Navy in November 1914. Under German control, the class became known as the U 66 type and the boats were renumbered; ''U-11'' became ''U-70'', and all were redesigned and reconstructed to German specifications. ''U-70'' was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in July 1915 and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed in September. As completed, she displaced {{convert|791|MT|ST}}, surfaced, and {{convert|933|MT|ST}}, submerged. The boat was {{convert|228|ft|m}} long and was armed with five torpedo tubes and a [[deck gun]].

A part of the [[IV Flottille|4th Flotilla]] throughout the war, ''U-70'' sank 53 merchant ships with a combined [[gross register tonnage]] (GRT) of 137,775. Included in that total was {{SS|Southland||2}}<U+2014>at {{GRT|11,899}}, one of the largest ships of the war sunk by a U-boat<U+2014>sunk in June 1917. In addition she sank one British {{sclass2|Flower|sloop|1}} and damaged four merchant ships ({{GRT|20,369}}). On 20 November 1918, nine days after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], ''U-70'' was surrendered to the British. She was broken up at [[Bo'ness]] in 1919<U+2013>20.

== Design and construction ==
After the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] had competitively evaluated three foreign submarine designs, it selected the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] 506d design, also known as the Type UD, for its new ''U-7'' class  of five submarines.<ref name=Con-340>Gardiner, p. 340.</ref> The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.<ref name=Con-343 />

The ''U-7'' class was seen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]], which was also a Germaniawerft design.<ref name=Con-343 /><ref group=Note>The [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3''-class]] submarines, however, were less than half the displacement and nearly {{convert|90|ft|m}} shorter than the ''U-7'' design. See: Gardiner, pp. 342<U+2013>43.</ref> As designed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the boats were to [[displace (ship)|displace]] {{convert|695|MT|ST}} on the surface and {{convert|885|MT|ST}} while submerged. The [[hull (submarine)|doubled-hulled]] boats were to be {{convert|228|ft|m}} long ([[length overall|OA]]) with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20|ft|8|in|m}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|5|in|m}}. The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin [[diesel engine]]s ({{convert|2300|bhp}} total) for surface running at up to {{convert|17|knots|km/h}}, and twin [[electric motor]]s ({{convert|1240|shp}} total) for a maximum of {{convert|11|knots|km/h}} when submerged.<ref name=Con-343 /> The boats were designed with five {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes; four located in the bow, one in the stern. The boats' armament was to also include a single 66<U+00A0>cm/26 (2.6<U+00A0>in) [[deck gun]].<ref name=Con-343 />

''U-11'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 11 February 1914, the final boat of the class begun.<ref name=allU66s>Helgason, Gu<U+00F0>mundur. [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=66 WWI U-boats: U 66], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=67 WWI U-boats: U 67], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=68 WWI U-boats: U 68], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=69 WWI U-boats: U 69], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=70 WWI U-boats: U 70]. ''U-Boat War in World War I''. Uboat.net. Retrieved on 9 December 2008.</ref> Her construction was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months.<ref name=Con-343 />

Neither ''U-11'' nor any of her [[sister boat]]s were complete when World War I began in August 1914.<ref name=allU66s /> With the boats under construction at [[Kiel]], the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past [[Gibraltar]], a British territory.<ref name=Con-343 /><ref group=Note>The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]'s Germaniawerft-built [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]] boats had been towed from [[Kiel]] to [[Pula|Pola]] via [[Gibraltar]] in 1909. See: Sieche, p. 19.</ref> As a result, ''U-11'' and her four sisters were sold to the [[Imperial German Navy]] on 28 November 1914.<ref name=Con-177 /><ref group=Note>In April 1915, just five months later, the German {{SMS|U-21||2|sub=y}} successfully entered the Mediterranean through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], proving that delivery would have been possible after all. See: Gardiner, p. 343.</ref>

''U-11'' was renumbered by the Germans as ''U-70'' when her class was redesignated as the Type U 66.  The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards, which increased the surface displacement by {{convert|96|MT|ST}} and the submerged by {{convert|48|MT|ST}}. The torpedo load was increased by a third, from 9 to 12, and the deck gun was upgraded from the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun originally specified to an {{convert|88|mm|in|abbr=on}} one.<ref name=Con-177 />

== Service career ==
''U-70'' was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 20 July 1915.<ref name=Con-177 /> On 22 September, SM ''U-70'' was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' under the command of ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' [[Otto W<U+00FC>nsche]].<ref name=U-70 />

In January 1916 ''U-70'' escorted the German blockade runner ''Marie'' through the [[North Sea]].<ref name=Gib-83>Gibson and Prendergast, p. 83.</ref> Early the next month, ''U-70'' was assigned to the [[IV Flottille|IV. ''U-Halbflotille'']] in which she remained for the duration of the war.<ref name=Tar-34>Tarrant, p. 34.</ref> Later that same month, ''U-70'' again served as an escort, this time for the German [[merchant raider]] {{SMS|Greif||2}}.<ref name=Gib-83 /><ref group=Note>{{SMS|Greif||2}} and British [[armed merchant cruiser]] {{SS|Alcantara|1913|2}} met and sank each other on 29 February in the [[North Sea]].</ref>

''U-70''{{'}}s next success came in December when she sank the 5,587-ton British steamer ''Pascal'' on 17 December.

''U-70'' had no successes during May 1917, but her captain, Otto W<U+00FC>nsche, was awarded the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI U-boat commanders: Otto W<U+00FC>nsche | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/415.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 9 December | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> ''U-70'' kicked off another productive month by sinking the [[American Line]] ocean liner {{SS|Southland||2}} on 4 June.

In total ''U-70'' sank 54 ships with a combined tonnage of 139,065 and damaged four with a tonnage of 20,369 in her twelve war patrols.
