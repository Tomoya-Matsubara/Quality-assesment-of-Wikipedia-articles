A '''Fibonacci word''' is a specific sequence of [[Binary numeral system|binary]] digits (or symbols from any two-letter [[alphabet]]). The Fibonacci word is formed by repeated [[concatenation]] in the same way that the [[Fibonacci number]]s are formed by repeated addition.

It is a paradigmatic example of a [[Sturmian word]].

The name <U+201C>Fibonacci word<U+201D> has also been used to refer to the members of a [[formal language]] ''L'' consisting of strings of zeros and ones with no two repeated ones. Any prefix of the specific Fibonacci word belongs to ''L'', but so do many other strings. ''L'' has a Fibonacci number of members of each possible length.

== Definition ==

Let <math>S_0</math> be "0" and <math>S_1</math> be "01". Now <math>S_n = S_{n-1}S_{n-2}</math> (the concatenation of the previous sequence and the one before that). 

The infinite Fibonacci word is the limit <math>S_{\infty}</math>.

== The Fibonacci words ==

We have:

<math>S_0</math> &nbsp;&nbsp; 0

<math>S_1</math> &nbsp;&nbsp; 01

<math>S_2</math> &nbsp;&nbsp; 010

<math>S_3</math> &nbsp;&nbsp; 01001

<math>S_4</math> &nbsp;&nbsp; 01001010

<math>S_5</math> &nbsp;&nbsp; 0100101001001

...

The first few elements of the infinite Fibonacci word are:

0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, ...

== Closed-form expression for individual digits ==
The n<sup>th</sup> digit of the word is <math>2+\left\lfloor {\left( {n + 1} \right)\,\varphi} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor {\left( {n + 2} \right)\,\varphi } \right\rfloor</math> where <math>\varphi</math> is the [[golden ratio]] and <math>\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor</math> is the [[floor function]] {{OEIS|A003849}}.

== Substitution rules ==

Another way of going from ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> to ''S''<sub>''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sub> is to replace each symbol 0 in ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> with the pair of consecutive symbols 0, 1 in ''S''<sub>''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sub>, and to replace each symbol 1 in ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> with the single symbol 0 in ''S''<sub>''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sub>.

Alternatively, one can imagine directly generating the entire infinite Fibonacci word by the following process: start with a cursor pointing to the single digit 0. Then, at each step, if the cursor is pointing to a 0, append 1, 0 to the end of the word, and if the cursor is pointing to a 1, append 0 to the end of the word. In either case, complete the step by moving the cursor one position to the right.

A similar infinite word, sometimes called the '''rabbit sequence''', is generated by a similar infinite process with a different replacement rule: whenever the cursor is pointing to a 0, append 1, and whenever the cursor is pointing to a 1, append 0, 1. The resulting sequence begins
:0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...
However this sequence differs from the Fibonacci word only trivially, by swapping 0's for 1's and shifting the positions by one.

== Discussion ==
The word is related to the famous sequence of the same name (the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]]) in the sense that addition of integers in the [[inductive definition]] is replaced with string concatenation.  This causes the length of ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> to be ''F''<sub>''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub>, the (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2)th Fibonacci number.  Also the number of 1s in ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> is ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> and the number of 0s in ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> is ''F''<sub>''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sub>.

== Other properties ==
* The infinite Fibonacci word is not periodic and not ultimately periodic.
* The last two letters of a Fibonacci word are alternately "01" and "10".
* Suppressing the last two letters of a Fibonacci word, or prefixing the complement of the last two letters, creates a [[palindrome]]. Example: 01<math>S_6</math> = 0101001010 is a palindrome.
* In the infinite Fibonacci word, the ratio (number of letters)/(number of zeroes) is <math>\phi</math>, the [[golden ratio]], as is the ratio of zeroes to ones.
* The infinite Fibonacci word is "balanced": Take two [[Substring|factors]] of the same length anywhere in the Fibonacci word.  The difference between the number of "0" in any of them and the number of "0" in the other one never exceeds 1.
* The subwords ''11'' and ''000'' never occur.
* The [[complexity function]] of the infinite Fibonacci word is ''n''+1: it  contains ''n''+1 distinct subwords of length ''n''. Example: There are 4 distinct subwords of length 3 : "001", "010", "100" and "101". Being also non-periodic, it is then of "minimal complexity", and hence a [[Sturmian word]],<ref name=deluca1995>{{Citation |  journal=Information Processing Letters |  volume=54 | year=1995 |  issue=6 | pages=307<U+2013>312 | doi=10.1016/0020-0190(95)00067-M | title=A division property of the Fibonacci word | first=Aldo | last=de Luca |  postscript=. }}</ref> with slope <math>1/\phi^2</math>.  The infinite Fibonacci word is the [[Sturmian_word#Discussion|standard word]] generated by the [[Sturmian_word#Discussion|directive sequence]] (1,1,1,....).
* The infinite Fibonacci word is recurrent; that is, every subword occurs infinitely often.
* If <math>u</math> is a subword of the infinite Fibonacci word, then so is its reversal, denoted <math>u^R</math>.
* If <math>u</math> is a subword of the infinite Fibonacci word, then the least period of <math>u</math> is a Fibonacci number.
* The concatenation of two successive Fibonacci words is "almost commutative". <math>S_{n+1}=S_nS_{n-1}</math> and <math>S_{n-1}S_n</math> differ only by their last two letters.
* As a consequence, the infinite Fibonacci word can be characterized by a cutting sequence of a line of slope <math>\phi</math> or <math>\phi-1</math>. See figure above.
* The number 0.010010100..., whose decimals are built with the digits of the infinite Fibonacci word, is [[Transcendental number|transcendental]].
* The letters "1" can be found at the positions given by the successive values of the Upper Wythoff sequence (OEIS A001950): <math>\lfloor n\phi^2\rfloor</math>
* The letters "0" can be found at the positions given by the successive values of the Lower Wythoff sequence (OEIS A000201): <math>\lfloor n\phi\rfloor</math>
* The infinite Fibonacci word can contain repetitions of 3 successive identical subwords, but never 4. The infinite Fibonacci word contains at most <math>2+\phi=3.618</math> repetitions. It is the smallest index (or critical exponent) among all Sturmian words.
* The infinite Fibonacci word is often cited as the [[worst case]] for algorithms detecting repetitions in a string.
