'''Kelly Rowland''' (born '''Kelendria Trene Rowland''' on [[February 11]], [[1981]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[actor|actress]], and one of the founding members of the successful musical group [[Destiny's Child]]. Rowland has won four [[Grammy Award]]s &ndash; three with Destiny's Child and one as a solo artist.

==Destiny's Child==
{{main|Destiny's Child}}

Destiny's Child was originally signed by [[Elektra Records]] in 1995, but were dropped before they could release their debut album.  The quartet was signed to [[Columbia Records]] the following year, and their career took off.  Destiny's Child rose to fame in 1998 with the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top 10 hit, "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No Part 2]]."

Even after much publicized turmoil involving group members, Destiny's Child (eventually a trio consisting of original members Rowland and Knowles, with [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]]), managed to become one of the most successful R&B/[[pop music|pop]] acts in the late '90s/early '00s, earning four ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one [[single (music)|singles]], several top 10's, and two [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] number-one albums. The group also earned number-ones on various other ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and non-Billboard charts.

Rowland and Destiny's Child toured as an opening act for [[Christina Aguilera]] after their 1998's Platinum-selling self-titled debut album ''Destiny's Child'' was released. Their debut album was produced by [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Jermaine Dupri]] and featured the Platinum-selling single "No, No, No Part 2." Destiny Child's second album, ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'', released in 1999, featured two number-one hits: "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]" and "[[Say My Name]]." "[[Bug a Boo]]" and "[[Jumpin' Jumpin']]" were also popular singles from the album. "Say My Name" won two awards at the [[Grammy Awards of 2001|2001 Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]" and "[[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]]" &ndash; the latter of which was awarded to the songwriters, which included Rowland.

Their next album, ''[[Survivor (album)|Survivor]]'', proved to be another smash, going to number one on both the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, as well as the [[Canada|Canadian]] albums chart. Two singles from the album went to the top of the Hot 100: "[[Independent Women Part I]]" and "[[Bootylicious]]," with the album's title track reaching number two. "Independent Women Part I" had been the theme song for ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' in late 2000, before the album's 2001 release. The title track "[[Survivor (song)|Survivor]]" would win the group their third Grammy for "Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals." The album's fourth single, "[[Emotion (song)|Emotion]]," was a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Bee Gees]]' hit of the same name; it continued the group's impressive string of top 10 hits.

After the three year hiatus that involved concentration on individual solo projects, Rowland rejoined Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles and Michelle Williams for Destiny's Child's fourth (and final) studio album, ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]'', released November 2004. The album hit number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 and spawned the hits "[[Lose My Breath]]," "[[Soldier (song)|Soldier]]," "[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]," and "[[Cater 2 U]]." The album's title itself was a hint that ''Destiny Fulfilled'' may in fact be the last Destiny's Child album and indeed that was to be the case.

Rowland and the other two-thirds of Destiny's Child embarked on a world tour sponsored by [[McDonald's]] titled [[Destiny Fulfilled and Lovin' It]], in 2005, visiting over 70 cities throughout [[Australia]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]] from April to September. Shortly before the end of the European leg of the tour, at a concert in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]] on [[June 13]] [[2005]], Kelly announced that the group was to go their separate ways the following September.

In October 2005, the group released their final album, entitled ''[[Number 1's (Destiny's Child album)|#1's]]'', including all of Destiny's Child's number-one hits and most well-known songs. The collection also included three new tracks, one of which is the final single "[[Stand up for Love|Stand Up for Love]]." It debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart and number six on the [[UK Albums Chart|UK Top 75 Singles]].

At the 2005 [[World Music Award]]s, Destiny's Child were given the award for the biggest-selling girl group of all time with record sales of over 50 million.

She and Michelle Williams are to appear in Beyonce's "Get Me Bodied" video, appearing on her DVD to the B-day re-release.

==Solo career==
===''Simply Deep''===
[[Image:Simply deep (album).jpg|thumb|left|''Simply Deep'' (2002)]]
Rowland's first solo album, ''[[Simply Deep]]'' was released in [[October 2002]] domestically and in [[February 2003]] internationally. The album featured a range of "alternative R&B music", widely influenced by [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]], and yielded the BAM & Ryan number-one hit "[[Dilemma (song)|Dilemma]]," a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning ("[[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]" in [[Grammy Awards of 2003|2003]]) duet with rapper [[Nelly]], which eventually spent ten weeks on top of the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]]. Other production was among contributed by Robert "Big Bert" Smith, [[Rich Harrison]], [[Solange Knowles]], [[Alonzo Jackson]], and Damon Elliot. While the album entered the top 10 on the majority of the charts it appeared on, and peaked at number 12 on the [[Billboard 200]], eventually receiving a [[gold certification]] for more than 500,000 copies sold; ''Simply Deep'' reached number-one in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and was moreover certified [[gold]] in [[Ireland]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Canada]] and other countries.

Though the lead single "[[Stole (song)|Stole]]" reached the top ten in several countries, and peaked within the top five in the [[UK]], Australia, and New Zealand, it never reached the top 20 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]] chart. Follow-up song "[[Can't Nobody]]" barely made it to the top 10 on most charts, but peaked at number 4 on the [[UK singles chart]]; the album's final single, "[[Train on a Track]]" received limited international release, and thus failed to chart or sell noticeably. 

In 2005, Rowland appeared on rapper [[Trina]]'s song called "[[Here We Go]]," which impacted radio in [[September 2005]] and became another top 20 success for both artists in New Zealand, Finland, the United States, and the UK.
