'''Franeker''' ({{lang-fry|Frjentsjer}}) is one of the eleven [[City rights in the Low Countries|cities]] of [[Friesland]] and capital of the municipality of [[Franekeradeel]].  It is located about 20 km west of [[Leeuwarden]] on the ''Van Harinxma Canal''.  As of 1 January 2006, it had 12,996 inhabitants.  The city is most famous for the [[Eise Eisinga Planetarium]].

==History==

Franeker was founded around [[800]] as a [[Carolingian]] stronghold.  The name probably derives from ''Froon-acker'', meaning "country of the king"; the oldest street in the city is still called Froonacker.  Beginning around the 11th century, Franeker developed into the administrative center [[Westergoa]].

Franeker received [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in [[1374]].  In the 15th century, [[Albert, Duke of Saxony]] established himself in Franeker. The city appeared for a time to be growing into the primary city of Friesland, but was eventually overshadowed in this role by Leeuwarden.

During the period of the [[Dutch Revolt]], the town sided early on with [[William the Silent|William I]].

From 1585 to 1811, the city housed the [[University of Franeker]], which was the second university in the Netherlands. It was closed shortly after the incorporation of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] into the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. A successor institution, the ''Rijksatheneum'', was founded in 1815, but in 1847 it, too, closed.

The [[Krystkongres]] (Christmas Congress), usually held in Franeker, is the annual convention for Frisian students living in Dutch student towns.

==Culture==

The city contains two major museums, the [[Eise Eisinga Planetarium]] and the [[Museum Martena]]. The Planetarium is an [[orrery]] built by a local wool carder to explain a [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)| conjunction]] of the planets and to help mitigate local fears of what would happen during the planets' alignment. Built in Eisinga's own living room, it is one of the oldest operating orreries in the world. <ref> Royal Eise Eisinga Planetarium [http://www.planetarium-friesland.nl/engels.html]</ref> The Museum Martena, opened in 2006, is housed in a manor house built in 1498 and is devoted to the history of the city and the region.

==Railways==
[[Franeker railway station]] is a station on the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen|NS]] line between [[Leeuwarden]] and [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]]. It also had a station on the [[North Friesland Railway]] which was the terminus of a branch from Tzummarum. The line opened in October 1903 and closed in October 1933. The station building survives.

== Sports ==
Since 1852 Franeker is the home of the [[:nl:PC (kaatsen)|PC]], the most important tournament in [[Frisian handball]].

Being one of the Frisian cities, Franeker is also on the route of the {{convert|200|km|mi}} ''[[Eleven-cities Tour|Elfstedentocht]]'' (Eleven-cities Tour), an endurance skating event held at irregular intervals depending on weather conditions.
