'''New York State Route&nbsp;171''' ('''NY&nbsp;171''') is a [[state highway]] running east to west through [[Herkimer County, New York]], in the United States. It connects the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Gulph in the [[Frankfort (town), New York|town of Frankfort]] to the [[Frankfort (village), New York|village of Frankfort]] by way of the Frankfort Gorge. Its western end is at the junction of [[County Route 145 (Herkimer County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;145]] (CR&nbsp;145) and [[County Route 185 (Herkimer County, New York)|CR&nbsp;185]] southeast of Gulph. The eastern end is {{convert|5.69|mi|2}} to the east at an intersection with Main Street in Frankfort village. NY&nbsp;171 is a narrow, two-lane highway for its whole length.

NY&nbsp;171 is the only signed state highway in New York that does not intersect another signed state route. However, this was not always the case. It was originally assigned as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]], Main Street in Frankfort was part of [[New York State Route 5S|NY&nbsp;5S]]. A new freeway alignment for NY&nbsp;5S was constructed between [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[Ilion, New York|Ilion]] in the late 1960s, isolating NY&nbsp;171 from the remainder of the state highway system. Frankfort's interchange with NY&nbsp;5S is now at Cemetery Street, {{convert|0.75|mi|2}} to the west.

NY&nbsp;171 begins at an intersection with [[County Route 145 (Herkimer County, New York)|CR&nbsp;145]] (Ball Road) and [[County Route 185 (Herkimer County, New York)|CR&nbsp;185]] (Gulph Road) southeast of the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Gulph, New York|Gulph]]. The route heads eastward, passing through a dense forest in the [[Frankfort (town), New York|town of Frankfort]]. The forest surrounds NY&nbsp;171 for a substantial distance, separating it from more developed areas of the town. The highway eventually turns to the northeast, following a winding, curve-filled route that leads through the Frankfort Gorge towards the [[Frankfort (village), New York|village of Frankfort]]. As it heads through the valley, NY&nbsp;171 intersects with [[County Route 13 (Herkimer County, New York)|CR&nbsp;13]], known locally as Furnace Road. CR&nbsp;13 and NY&nbsp;171 parallel for a short distance as CR&nbsp;13 climbs the north face of the gorge and then turns northward at its top.<ref name="yahoo">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=43.038526&lon=-75.068693&zoom=17&q1=43.008987%2C-75.157206&q2=43.039545%2C-75.071353 |title=overview map of NY 171 |accessdate=May 9, 2009}}</ref> 

The route then passes under a series of power lines, loosely paralleling the more northerly [[County Route 96 (Herkimer County, New York)|CR&nbsp;96]] (Higby Road) to the outskirts of the village of Frankfort. Here, NY&nbsp;171 intersects with several roads of local importance before crossing over the [[New York State Route 5S|NY&nbsp;5S]] freeway to enter the village itself. On the eastern side of the highway, NY&nbsp;171 becomes South Litchfield Street and passes through areas that are mostly residential. It continues to the village's central business district.<ref name="yahoo" /> State maintenance of the route ends at a junction with Canal Street. but the route continues as a village-maintained highway for one more block to an intersection with Main Street.<ref name="inv-herkimer">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_herkimer.csv |title=Herkimer County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=December 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="ilion quad">{{cite map |url=http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=p38 |title=Ilion Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1978 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=December 20, 2010}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:NY 171 bridge in Frankfort.jpg|right|thumb|NY&nbsp;171 crossing a bridge in Frankfort]]
Most of what is now NY&nbsp;171 was improved to state highway standards as part of a project contracted out by the state of New York on July&nbsp;12, 1916. The work covered the {{convert|5.10|mi}} of the route outside of the Frankfort village limits. The reconstruction was completed in the 1920s, and the Frankfort Gorge road was added to the state highway system as [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] State Highway&nbsp;1346 (SH&nbsp;1346) by 1926.<ref name="1920book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Sj4CAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA266 |author=New York State Department of Highways |title=Report of the State Commissioner of Highways |year=1920 |publisher=J.
