The '''55th Boat Race''' took place on 24 March 1898.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Oxford, the reigning champions and leading overall, went into the race with a marginally heavier crew than Cambridge.  They won "easily" as Cambridge's boat became waterlogged in strong winds and inclement conditions.  It was their ninth consecutive victory and took them to an overall lead of 32&ndash;22 in the event.  The winning time of 22 minutes 15 seconds was the slowest since the [[The Boat Race 1878|1878 race]].

Oxford were coached by G. C.

According to George Drinkwater, former rower and author, "Fletcher turned out a crew well above the average of previous years."<ref name=drink105>Drinkwater, p. 105</ref>   Conversely, Oxford "did not develop as it should have done" and was "by no means up to the average of those that went before it."<ref name=drink104/>  

The umpire for the race for the tenth year in a row was [[Frank Willan (rower)|Frank Willan]] who won the event four consecutive times, rowing for Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1866|1866]], [[The Boat Race 1867|1867]], [[The Boat Race 1868|1868]] and [[The Boat Race 1869|1869 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 59</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 7&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (79.2&nbsp;kg), {{convert|0.5|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.<ref name=burn66>Burnell, p. 66</ref>  Cambridge's crew contained two participants with Boat Race experience: Adam Searle Bell who was rowing in his fourth contest and [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] Edward Caesar Hawkins steering in his second appearance.  [[Claude Goldie]], son of [[John Goldie|John]] rowed at number seven for the Light Blues.<ref>Burnell, p. 41</ref>  Oxford saw six members of the previous crew return, including [[Charles Burnell]] and R. Carr, both of whom were making their fourth consecutive appearance in the race.  Eight of the nine crew Oxford crew had studied at [[Eton College]].<ref name=burn66/>  R. O. Pitman, rowing at [[Bow (rowing)|bow]] for Oxford, was the third of his siblings to participate in the Boat Race, with his bothers [[Frederick I. Pitman]] rowing for Cambridge between 1884 and 1886 and C. M. Pitman who rowed for Oxford between 1892 and 1895.<ref>Burnell, p. 40</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater, "there was a gale blowing ... which met a spring tide, so that the water was very rough from the start."<ref name=drink105/>  Oxford, the slight pre-race favourites,<ref name=drink105>Drinkwater, p. 105</ref> won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the rougher Surrey side of the river to Cambridge.<ref name=burn66/>  Willan started the race at 3:47 p.m. but within four strokes, the Cambridge boat was "half-full of water".<ref name=drink105/>  

Oxford steered towards the shore for shelter, with Cambridge following, but they had taken on so much water that "only the bladders which had been placed under their seats kept them afloat".<ref name=drink105/>  Although the Dark Blues had shipped a fair amount of water, they were able to continue, and with Cambridge waterlogged, the race was effectively ended as a contest.  Oxford won "easily",<ref>Dodd, p. 313</ref> to secure their ninth consecutive victory in the slowest winning time since the [[The Boat Race 1878|1878 race]].<ref name=results/>
