'''''Psittacosaurus''''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation]]: {{IPA|[,s<U+026A>.t<U+00E6>.ko<U+028A>'so<U+028A>r.<U+0259>s]}}, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for "parrot lizard") is a [[genus]] of [[psittacosaurid]] [[ceratopsia]]n [[dinosaur]] from the Early [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] of [[Asia]], about 130 to 100 million years ago. It is notable for being the most [[species]]-rich dinosaur genus. At least eight [[extinct]] species are recognized from [[fossil]]s found in different regions of [[China]] and [[Mongolia]], with possible additional species from [[Thailand]] and [[Russia]].

All species of ''Psittacosaurus'' were [[gazelle]]-sized [[biped]]al [[herbivore]]s characterized by a high, powerful [[beak]] on the upper jaw. At least one species had long, quill-like structures on its tail and lower back, possibly serving a display function. Psittacosaurs were extremely early ceratopsians, and while they developed many novel adaptations of their own, they also shared many anatomical features with later ceratopsians, such as ''[[Protoceratops]]'' and the [[elephant]]-sized ''[[Triceratops]]''.

''Psittacosaurus'' is not as familiar to the general public as its distant relative ''Triceratops'', but it is one of the most completely known dinosaur genera. Fossils of over 150 individuals have been collected so far, including many complete skeletons. Most different age classes are represented, from nestling through adult, which has allowed several detailed studies of ''Psittacosaurus'' growth rates and [[reproductive]] [[biology]]. The abundance of this dinosaur in the [[fossil record]] has led to its use as an [[index fossil]] for Early Cretaceous sediments of [[central Asia]].

==Description==
Different species of ''Psittacosaurus'' varied in size and specific features of the [[skull]] and skeleton, but shared the same overall body shape. The best-known species, ''P. mongoliensis'', reached 2&nbsp;[[meter]]s (6.5&nbsp;ft) in length.<ref name="sereno97">Sereno, P.C. 1997. Psittacosauridae. In: Currie, P.J. & Padian, K.P. (Eds.).

''P. ordosensis'' was the smallest known species, 30% smaller than ''P. mongoliensis''. The largest was ''P. lujiatunensis'', which was 30% larger than ''P. mongoliensis''. <ref name="brinkmanetal01">Brinkman, D.B., Eberth, D.A., Ryan, M.J., Chen P., 2001.

The skull of ''Psittacosaurus'' was highly modified compared to other [[ornithischia]]n dinosaurs. The skull was extremely tall and short, with an almost round [[profile]] in some species. The portion in front of the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] (eye socket) was only 40% of total skull length, shorter than any other known ornithischian. Both upper and lower jaws sported a pronounced beak, formed from the ''rostral'' and ''predentary'' bones, respectively. The bony core of the beak may have been sheathed in [[keratin]] to provide a sharp cutting surface for cropping [[plant]] material. ''Psittacosaurus'' skulls shared several adaptations with more [[derived]] ceratopsians, such as the unique rostral bone at the tip of the upper jaw, and the widely flared [[jugal]] (cheek) bones. However, there was still no sign of the bony neck frill or prominent facial horns which would develop in later ceratopsians.<ref name="youdodson04">*You H. & Dodson, P. 2004. Basal Ceratopsia. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., & Osmolska, H. (Eds.). ''The Dinosauria'' (2nd Edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 478-493.</ref>

''Psittacosaurus'' postcranial skeletons were much more typical of a "basic" bipedal ornithischian. In ''P. mongoliensis'', similarly to other species, the forelimbs were only 58% as long as the hindlimbs, indicating that these animals were almost totally bipedal in life. There were only four digits on the hand, as opposed to the five fingers found in almost all other ornithischians (including more derived ceratopsians). Overall, the four-toed hindfoot was very similar to many other small ornithischians.<ref name="youdodson04"/>

==Taxonomy==
''Psittacosaurus'' was named in 1923 by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], [[paleontologist]] and president of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] (AMNH). The generic name is composed of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words '''<U+03C8><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>''' (''psittakos''; "parrot") and '''<U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>''' (''sauros''; "lizard"), suggested by the superficially [[parrot]]-like beak of these animals and their [[reptile|reptilian]] nature.<ref name="osborn23">Osborn, H.F. 1923. Two Lower Cretaceous dinosaurs of Mongolia. ''American Museum Novitates'' 95: 1-10.</ref>

Pp. 480-516.</ref> This is the highest number of valid species currently assigned to any single dinosaur genus (not including [[bird]]s). In contrast, most other dinosaur genera are ''monospecific'', containing only a single known species. The difference is most likely due to quirks of the fossil record. While ''Psittacosaurus'' is known from dozens of fossil specimens, most other dinosaur species are known from far fewer, and many are represented by only a single specimen. With a very high sample size, the diversity of ''Psittacosaurus'' can be analyzed more completely than that of most dinosaur genera, resulting in the recognition of more species. Most [[extant]] animal genera are represented by multiple species, suggesting that this may have been the case for extinct dinosaur genera as well, although most of these species may not have been preserved. In addition, most dinosaurs are known solely from [[bone]]s and can only be evaluated from a [[morphology|morphological]] standpoint, whereas extant species often have very similar skeletal morphology but differ in other ways which would not be preserved in the fossil record. Therefore actual species diversity may be much higher than currently recognized in this and other dinosaur genera.<ref name="archibald97">Archibald, J.D. 1997. Species.

===Classification===
''Psittacosaurus'' is the [[type genus]] of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923.<ref name="osborn23"/> Only one other genus, ''[[Hongshanosaurus]]'', is currently classified in this family alongside ''Psittacosaurus''.<ref name="youetal03">You H., Xu X. & Wang X. 2003. A new genus of Psittacosauridae (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) and the origin and early evolution of marginocephalian dinosaurs. ''Acta Geologica Sinica'' (English edition) 77(1): 15<U+2013>20.</ref> Psittacosaurids were [[basal]] to almost all known ceratopsians except ''[[Yinlong]]'' and perhaps ''[[Chaoyangsaurus]]''.<ref name="youdodson04"/><ref name="xuetal06">Xu X., Forster, C.A., Clark, J.M., & Mo J. 2006. A basal ceratopsian with transitional features from the Late Jurassic of northwestern China. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences''. doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3566 [published online]</ref> While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, ''Psittacosaurus'' itself was probably not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a [[plesiomorphy]] or primitive trait, whereas all species of ''Psittacosaurus'' had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the ''antorbital fenestra'', an opening in the skull between the eye socket and [[nostril]], was lost during the [[evolution]] of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other [[archosaur]]s. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would [[evolve]] a second time.<ref name="youdodson04"/>

==Provenance==
''Psittacosaurus'' is known from over 150 individual specimens, of which over 75 belong to the type species, ''P. mongoliensis''.<ref name="youdodson04"/> All ''Psittacosaurus'' fossils discovered so far have been found in [[Early Cretaceous]] sediments in Asia. The most common age of [[geologic formation]]s bearing ''Psittacosaurus'' fossils is [[Aptian]]-[[Albian]], or approximately 125 to 100 [[million years ago]]. However, specimens attributed to this genus have also been recovered from slightly older [[strata]], such as the [[Yixian Formation]], which is considered to date from the [[Hauterivian]] through [[Barremian]] stages of the Early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 136 to 125 million years ago. The genus may therefore have existed for more than 30 million years. Nearly all [[sedimentary]] formations of Barremian to Albian age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of ''Psittacosaurus'', leading to its use as an index fossil for the region.<ref name="lucas06">Lucas, S.G. 2006. The ''Psittacosaurus'' biochron, Early Cretaceous of Asia. ''Cretaceous Research'' 27: 189-198.</ref>

==Paleobiology==
''Psittacosaurus'' is extremely well-known and represented by hundreds of specimens, allowing a more detailed analysis of its life history than is possible for the vast majority of dinosaurs.

===Diet===
Psittacosaurs had self-sharpening teeth that would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. However, unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used [[gastrolith]]s, stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Gastroliths, sometimes numbering more than fifty, are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a [[gizzard]], as in modern birds.<ref name="sereno97"/>

===Integument===
[[Image:Psittacosaurus.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A picture of ''Psittacosaurus'' showing the integumentary structures on the tail and hips.]]
The [[integument]], or body covering, of ''Psittacosaurus'' is known from a Chinese specimen, which most likely comes from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning. The specimen, which is not yet assigned to any particular species, was illegally exported from China, in violation of Chinese law, but was purchased by a [[Germany|German]] [[museum]] and arrangements are being made to return the specimen to China.<ref name="mayretal02">Mayr, G., Peters, D.S., Plodowski, G., Vogel, O. 2002. Bristle-like integumentary structures at the tail of the horned dinosaur ''Psittacosaurus''. ''Naturwissenschaften'' 89: 361<U+2013>365.</ref> 

Most of the body was covered in [[Scale (zoology)|scales]]. Larger scales were arranged in irregular patterns, with numerous smaller scales occupying the spaces between them, similarly to skin impressions known from other ceratopsians, such as ''[[Chasmosaurus]]''. However, a series of what appear to be hollow, tubular bristles, approximately 16&nbsp;centimeters (6.4&nbsp;in) long, were also preserved, arranged in a row down the [[dorsal]] (upper) surface of the tail. The structures appear similar to the [[feather|protofeathers]] found on numerous [[theropod]] dinosaurs from the same formation, although they may or may not be [[homology (biology)|homologous]]. As the structures are only found in a single row on the tail, it is unlikely that they were used for [[thermoregulation]], but they may have been useful for [[animal communication|communication]] through some sort of display.<ref name="mayretal02"/>

===Growth rate===

[[Image:Psittacosaurus2.jpg|thumb|left|A ''Psittacosaurus'' skeleton.]]

Several juvenile ''Psittacosaurus'' have been found. The smallest is a ''P. mongoliensis'' hatchling in the AMNH collection, which is only 11 to 13&nbsp;[[centimeter]]s (4-5&nbsp;in) long, with a skull 2.8&nbsp;centimeters (1&nbsp;in) in length. Another hatchling skull at the AMNH is only 4.6&nbsp;centimeters (1.8&nbsp;in) long. Both specimens are from Mongolia.<ref name="coombs82">Coombs, W.P. 1982. Juvenile specimens of the ornithischian dinosaur ''Psittacosaurus''. Palaeontology 25: 89-107.</ref> Juveniles discovered in the Yixian Formation are approximately the same age as the larger AMNH specimen.<ref name="mengetal04">Meng Q., Liu J., Varrichio, D.J., Huang, T., Gao C. 2004. Parental care in an ornithischian dinosaur. ''Nature'' 431: 145-146.</ref> Adult ''Psittacosaurus mongoliensis'' approached 2&nbsp;meters (6.5&nbsp;ft) in length.

A [[histology|histological]] examination of ''P. mongoliensis'' has determined the growth rate of these animals. The smallest specimens in the study were estimated at three years old and less than 1&nbsp;kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb), while the largest were nine years old and weighed almost 20&nbsp;kilograms (44&nbsp;lb). This indicates relatively rapid growth compared to most reptiles and [[marsupial]] mammals, but slower than modern [[bird]]s and [[placental]] mammals.<ref name="erickson00"/>

===Parental Care===
An extemely well-preserved specimen found in the Yixian Formation of [[Liaoning Province]], China provides some of the best evidence for parental care in dinosaurs. This specimen consists of an adult ''Psittacosaurus'' (not assigned to any particular species), which is closely associated with 34 articulated juvenile skeletons, all preserved in [[three dimensions]]. The young ''Psittacosaurus'', all approximately the same age, are intertwined in a group underneath the adult, although all 34 skulls are positioned above the mass of bodies, as they would have been in life. This suggests that the animals were alive at the time of burial, which must have been extremely rapid, perhaps due to the collapse of a [[burrow]].<ref name="mengetal04"/>

The juvenile bones are very small but are well-[[endochondral ossification|ossified]]. This has been taken as evidence of extensive parental care, as the young must have been in the nest long enough for their bones to become ossified. The sheer number of offspring in the nest suggest that they did not all belong to the preserved adult, indicating that ''Psittacosaurus'' may have engaged in some sort of communal [[nest]]ing, perhaps similar to [[ostrich]]es.<ref name="mengetal04"/> However, even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been [[precocial]], although this does not rule out continued parental care.<ref name="coombs82"/>

===Predation===
Another fossil from the Yixian Formation provides direct evidence of ''Psittacosaurus'' as a [[prey]] animal. One skeleton of ''[[Repenomamus|Repenomamus giganticus]]'', a large, aquatic [[triconodont]] mammal, is preserved with the remains of a juvenile ''Psittacosaurus'' in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the [[carnivore|carnivorous]] mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of [[Mesozoic]] mammals preying on live dinosaurs.<ref name="huetal05">Hu Y., Meng J., Wang Y., & Li C. 2005. Large Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs. ''Nature'' 433: 149-152.</ref> Heavy predation on juvenile ''Psittacosaurus'' may have resulted in [[R/K selection theory|R-selection]], the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.
